In Season 3, Lily was just a guest star.[1] She was originally a student at East High School, but after being rejected by Miss Jenn in playing the lead on their musical, she asked to be transferred to North High School to get her revenge on East High. in Season 2, she was cast as Belle in North High School's spring production of Beauty and the Beast. She is portrayed by Olivia Rose Keegan.\n\nBackground[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nLily is an energetic and adorable Former East High freshman whose sweetness masks her insecurity and highly competitive nature.[2]\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nShe has long curly blonde hair, blue eyes and very defined facial features. She is described as looking and singing like a \"Disney Princess\" by Ashlyn in Typecasting.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nLily was born sometime between 2004-2005 and attends North High School.\n\nSeason Two[]\n\nTypecasting[]\n\nWhile the Drama Club sits together in the school's canteen, Lily walks up to them and told them how she can't believe she's standing in front of Ricky and E.J. who both played Troy Bolton last semester's musical. She talks to them about how she was inspired by them to try out this semester since she is basically brand new to theater. Lily tells them that they are all talented and asks if they can all take a selfie.\n\nDuring the first part of the auditions, she emerges on stage and sings a solo part in \"Belle\" and surprised everybody on how good her voice is. While on break, she goes up to Gina and tells her that she was amazing during the audition, Gina says the same to her, especially for someone who never did theater. Lily explained to her that she did theater before, but not \"local theater\". She tells Gina that they are the only real contenders in this audition for the lead in which Gina responds that her friends are talented as well. Lily sarcastically replies that she didn't know that this was a friendship circle leaving Gina annoyed. At the second part of the auditions, Lily watches the others' performances as she laughs at them and call them amateurs.\n\nAfter the auditions, Carlos posted the cast list and Lily finds out that she didn't get a role, she glares at Ashlyn in jealousy and walks out. Miss Jenn then talks to her about how she got an amazing voice and tells her that the reason she didn't get a role was because of her attitude towards the others, Lily leaves in her annoyance.\n\nAs the Drama Club celebrates at Salt Lake Slices, Lily stands outside and calls North High, foreshadowing that she'll be leaving East High soon.\n\nValentine’s Day[]\n\nLily stops by Miss Jenn’s office on Valentine’s Day and tells her that she is moving up North suggesting that she would be transferring in North High. Miss Jenn gave her regards to Lily but left quickly, leaving Miss Jenn thinking scared a little.\n\nThe Quinceañero[]\n\nLily and Zack Roy ran into Miss Jenn at a Coffee Shop, revealing that she finally transferred to North High. She ordered a scalding hot coffee and drank it with ease which surprised Zack. During Carlos' Quinceañero, Miss Jenn watches Zack's new video as he announce that North High will be doing Beauty and the Beast as well, Lily will also be co-directing and teared up in happiness.\n\nYes, And...[]\n\nThe East High students watches North High's new video with Lily in her Belle dress announcing their Beauty and the Beast musical. Lily and Antoine went to Salt Lake Slices to spy on East High thinking that they were plotting something against them. They left after Lily took one of the chili flakes bottle and leaving Antoine's food unfinished. North High School's Drama Club posts a Promo video for their musical where Lily is dressed as Belle.\n\nThe Field Trip[]\n\nLily sees Gina and E.J. in the hallway and texted her clubmates that East High is in their school. Lily and the others found the others in their costume shop. They were accusing them of stealing their Beast mask but explained that they are a different league from East High to be stealing from them. Lily challenges them to a dance-off to a Beauty and the Beast song chosen at random. East High refused at first but later agreed after Lily provoked them by insulting Miss Jenn and Ashlyn.\n\nBefore the dance-off started, Lily talked to Ricky and \"complimented\" him on how he's handling his girlfriend Nini stabbing him on his back. Ricky asked her what she was talking about and Lily told him that the lyrics of Nini's Rose song sounded like she wants some space from Ricky. She then suggested that he should date her instead.\n\nLily walks up to the stage to choose the song at random they'll be performing and asks her clubmates to open the curtain, revealing their Beauty and the Beast set to East High. She smirks after seeing Ricky and Nini quarrel.\n\nDuring the performance, Ashlyn almost fell but was catched by Antoine and decided to stop the dance-off. As East High leaves, Lily goes up to them and tell them they won the dance-off, they disagreed and insisted they'll just settle their score with them in the Menkies, telling her that they have Nini's Rose Song. Lily chuckles and reveals to them that they can't perform the song in the musical because they'll get disqualified if they do. Nini said that they should still do it and take the risk, but Carlos didn't want to take that risk and let North High win, Ricky agreed and said that maybe the song doesn't really fit in the musical. Nini walks out and the others followed as Lily looks at them leaving.\n\nSpring Break[]\n\nLily makes a video for North High's Drama Club Instagram talking about how North High is preparing for the musical by spending their Spring Break by watching shows on Broadway in New York City.\n\nThe Transformation[]\n\nTBA\n\nShowtime[]\n\nTBA\n\nSecond Chances[]\n\nTBA\n\nSeason Three[]\n\nHappy Campers[]\n\nTBA\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFriendships[]\n\nAntoine[]\n\nLove Interests[]\n\nRicky Bowen[]\n\nSee also Lily and Ricky\n\nEnemies[]\n\nGina Porter[]\n\nIn Typecasting Lily told Gina that she was amazing during the auditions and Gina said that lily also was, especially for a beginner.

Lily leaves after telling Gina that it was an audition not a friendship circle. Later Lily unintentionally encourages Gina to audition with Ashlyn and Kourtney by laughing at them.\n\nMiss Jenn[]\n\nIn Typecasting, when Lily sings during Belle, she stands out positively to Miss Jenn. However, the attention turns negative when she laughs and insults other auditioneers during their performance. When Lily is visibly crushed about not having received a part in the musical, Miss Jenn explains to her that she was not a fit for their drama department, because they \"don't laugh at people who put themselves out there\", much to Lily's dismay.\n\nSongs[]\n\nBelle\n\nThe Mob Song\n\nHome (Lily's Version)\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nTypecasting (appears)\n\nValentine’s Day (appears)\n\nThe Quinceañero (appears)\n\nYes, And...
