Mumford (film) A psychologist named Dr. Mumford hangs out his shingle in a small town that also happens to be named Mumford and begins dispensing no-nonsense advice to an array of quirky locals. Included are a shop-by-mail-addicted housewife, an eccentric young billionaire, and a mild-mannered pharmacist with delusions of lascivious grandeur. Dr. Mumford’s unique style of therapy has a surprising effect on the community, sparking romance in some of the most unlikely places. A Touchstone Picture. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan.
