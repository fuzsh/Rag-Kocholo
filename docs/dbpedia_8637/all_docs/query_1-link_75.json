        "meta_description": "As a relative newcomer to an Oregon town that bears his name, Dr. Mumford seems charming and skillful to his neighbors and patients. His unique, frank approach to psychotherapy soon attracts patients away from the two therapists already working in the area. Soon he is treating a variety of conditions, ranging from the obsession of one man with erotic novels to an unhappily married woman and her compulsive shopping. Mumford befriends a billionaire computer mogul and a cafe waitress and attempts to play matchmaker. He also begins to fall for a patient who suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome. Together with an attorney (Martin Short) whom Mumford had rejected as a patient because of his narcissism, the rival therapists conspire to find skeletons in Mumford's closet, hoping to destroy his reputation. Meanwhile, Mumford's inherent likability causes his life to become intertwined with much of the rest of the town.",

        "text": "Release date: September 24th, 1999\n\nStay Calm and Carry On.\n\nDoctor Mumford moves to and then starts up a Psychologist therapy practice in the rural city of Mumford.\n\nHe is a calm, pragmatic, and insightful physician, and the town takes a liking to him.\n\nThe story has some intrigue, but not anything controversial enough to make the local evening news. You can earn bonus points if you remember the television series ‘Unsolved Mysteries'.\n\nThe thing I like about this film (which I have seen numerous times) is the small town atmosphere and how problems can be solved when you say the “quiet part” out loud.\n\nThis could be a Preston Sturges film from 1940, with the addition of sexual innuendos.…\n\nIt’s like the ultimate film to watch during the day. Sunny, small-town drama without too much conflict and a lot of wholesome self-discovery. There’s a therapist named Mumford in a town also called Mumford, who helps out a lot of local people with their problems simply thanks to listening. His unorthodox style and sympathetic ear is nice, and once it turns out that he’s familiar with personal problems and fresh starts, it’s easy to see where his empathetic side comes from. All most people need is someone to lend an ear and allow them to articulate their problems, and that’s often the first step to significant change. Watching characters here slowly get better thanks to their own words or simple…\n\nYou know the place:\n\nThe picturesque main street–hardware store, diner and fire station.\n\nThe locals who are friendly but mildly eccentric.\n\nThe unhurried atmosphere, in a world without much worry or stress.\n\nIt’s Hollywood’s small-town backdrop for a late-90s romantic comedy, introduced with a suitably chipper score.\n\nForcible quaintness pushes my buttons. And small-town characters that are little founts of ingenuousness and charm.\n\nMumford, written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, pushed those buttons hard. To my surprise, I didn’t hate the movie in the end. It is just such a mild and trifling thing that I will forget it by this afternoon.\n\nThe premise is modestly interesting, almost as if Kasdan saw the first Bob Newhart series and the second…\n\nSuch an intriguing film from writer/director Lawrence Kasdan, Mumford initially feels like a Preston Sturges flick — psychiatrist with mysterious origins starts a practice in a small town, working to cure the patients who truly deserve it, while bluntly ignoring or callously redirecting the ones that don’t (not in an arrogant manner but one which implies that this is the treatment they need if there’s any hope for them). Along the way, he forms friendships, makes enemies, and even possibly falls in love. Then there’s such a ballsy amount of risk-taking that happens that I was honestly astonished. There’s no way to prepare yourself for what this movie is. While not perfect, it is truly special in its architecture. …"
