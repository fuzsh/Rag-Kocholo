        "text": "As Lisa, Lena Kaminsky takes charge of the material with great aplomb. We can easily believe these are her experiences she’s recounting, and her way of working the material—Lisa is a somewhat captious host quite often—redounds to the success of this production, directed by Zoë Golub-Sass. The pacing snaps as Lisa confides and mocks and reveals. The main dramatic crux is that, in the midst of her straight-forward recounting of events, Lisa may come to weigh her experiences differently, as she does when she has to admit to a surprising flood of emotion at her brother’s wedding, or may even come to question why she’s trying to tell us what she’s telling us, as when she finds her descriptive powers tested by having to recreate the visit to Auschwitz. At that point, we could say she isn’t simply recreating, she’s reliving, and her distress becomes palpable.\n\nBut that’s also when we may become acutely aware that Kaminsky isn’t Kron, so that a scripted breakdown doesn’t quite play the same as one that could be coming directly from the author. That’s not likely to bother most viewers, but it did give the play, for me, an odd double-focus. First, on the question of how well Kron’s script conveys what she wants to say; second, how well Kaminsky plays Lisa. A theatrical monologue can be by an entirely fictional character, of course (see David Cale’s Sandra, now playing a few blocks away at TheaterWorks, Hartford, for instance), and so we know the actor onstage has adopted the role of the narrator/character. But when the monologue must render some aspects of the speaker’s relations with actual family members we might find ourselves thinking how fixed and undeviating this little slice of life has become. And we might become more aware of how structured the monologue is, especially as Kron likes to jump back and forth between Cedar Point and Auschwitz as though they should have some relation other than that furnished by visiting both with her aging father. Or so as to make one visit’s comic elements offset the creeping horror of the other visit, which becomes a bit of a crutch.\n\nLisa’s relation to her father is really what’s at issue here, but she keeps distracting us with other aperçus, as for instance the vapidity of a superstore in Michigan, or the lack of real pizza in Poland, or—more interesting—her mother’s refusal to be photographed from the time her children ceased to be infants, or the different roller-coasters and how it feels to ride them with an elderly man who might suffer a physical problem during their oh-so-fast flight. We might wish she’d concentrate more on this old man, though she makes it clear she finds it hard to do so. She began by trying to make a video documentary in which he could speak his memories, but the format didn’t work and that caused her a bit of soul-searching.\n\nAnd that attempt is a telling failure because it lets us know that 2.5 Minute Ride is another attempt, in a very different medium, to tackle the problem. It’s up to viewers if it works, but I’d say the real takeaway, with regard to her father, is his comment about his time as a youth in Germany where he wonders if, had he not been a Jew, he could’ve resisted becoming a Hitler Youth, the way one German boy he knew did. Later, as an interrogator with the U.S. Army, stationed in Germany, Kron’s dad gets a man to admit he was actually with the Gestapo, though he had lived in denial of that fact. The admission comes freighted, we might say, with the man’s grievance against history. Had the Nazis won, his actions as a Gestapo officer would’ve been praised. Instead, he’s a criminal. Kron’s dad sympathizes.\n\nThe poignancy and pointedness of Mr. Kron’s statements simply bubble up and subside within the busy texture of Lisa Kron’s need to dramatize her relation to this man. I found myself trying to imagine what a monologue in her father’s voice might have sounded like. But that would’ve meant Kron stepping outside her own experience to attempt to recreate someone else’s. At one point, she admits the limits of her method: ''When I try to tell his stories, I begin to hyperventilate, and I don't know why. I can feel the myth, the awe creep into my voice, and it makes me feel sick because what does that have to do with him?'' The fact that the question is rhetorical doesn’t mean Kron needn’t try to answer it.\n\nSandra, played with unwavering, forthright earnestness by Felicia Curry, is in her forties, separated from a husband who seems through with a marriage she might try to salvage, and runs a Brooklyn café called Sandra’s. She also seems to be the most isolated café owner one could ever imagine. Apart from that estranged husband whom we meet briefly in the later going (Curry enacts all Sandra’s interlocutors), Sandra has a co-worker/employee who hazards opinions, and knows a couple glimpsed briefly as a fleeting plot-point. Her entire life, it seems, is focused on Ethan, a younger, gay pianist/composer who gifts her a CD of his music before departing for Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, whilst remarking, “I feel like disappearing from my life.”\n\nDisappear he does, and Sandra, an emergency contact person for Ethan, gets a call asking if she knows his whereabouts three weeks later. And there are authorities questioning her too. Her solution: head to Puerto Vallarta and try to find his trail.\n\nI have to confess I did not attend Sandra thinking I was going to watch “a thriller.” The fact that Curry delivers the voices of all the other characters in a jokey way and plays Sandra as the type we’re most familiar with from clueless romantic comedies, made me imagine I was watching a play in which Sandra, sleuthing after the perhaps deliberately vanished Ethan, would learn way more about him (and perhaps herself) than she bargained for, and that her search in Mexico would include a wealth of odd-ball characters—like Beauford (a seventy-ish Tennessee Williams wanna-be who seems to base his life on Suddenly Last Summer) whom she meets briefly, or Luca, the quintessential sleazy/sexy Latin lover, by way of Sicily (his seduction of Sandra while Curry plays both parts definitely indicated rom-com). That play would all be in the interests of romance the way most trips to faraway places are.\n\nBut no, tensions mount when Sandra finds evidence, such as Ethan’s handwriting on a note launched in a bottle by a long-haired blonde dude who had accompanied Beauford to the bar where she met him, but who departed when the elderly gent had to take his insulin shot. And so now Sandra isn’t looking for Ethan as much as for this long-haired, nameless dude. And if she finds him?\n\nThrillers, of course, tend to be the movies you love to shout at because their protagonists so often do the wrong thing or have motives and/or knowledge that are only gradually revealed or which have to surface just to make something implausible slightly less so. And it may be that Cale and company had in mind a send-up of the genre that would have audiences laughing over wild coincidence met by the steady can-do positivity that fuels many an amateur sleuth’s success. But long before Sandra recounts arrests, testimony, witness protection programs and the like you may find yourself wishing she’d take a moment and reflect or philosophize or give us tips on airflight (she goes back and forth between Mexico and Brooklyn a lot), or anything we might want an engaging narrator to do. Instead, it’s all plot all the time, underscored by the fact that—as she’s left alone to tell the tale to us on a stage—we know Sandra won’t meet with an untimely end. And so we might well ask: why are you telling us this?\n\nAnd what does seeing the play do that simply reading it wouldn’t? Well, there is the immediacy of having Felicia Curry, an Emmy-nominated actor, speak things for us as though just realizing them, which is somewhat harder for a narrator to do in writing, and there is Camilla Tassi’s atmospheric projections, many of Puerto Vallarta itself, which include the ebb and flow of surf seen from above, the text of computer searches, and, in the play’s most dramatic moment, a looming shadow. All visuals are aided by the intricacy of the lighting design by co-lighting designers Amith Chandrashaker and Alex Fetchko. And there are Ethan’s lovely, stately piano compositions (by Matthew David Marsh) which might make you wish a friend more concerned with who Ethan is than where he is had been given a voice to recall him.\n\nPreview of Webster’s Bitch, New Haven Theater Company\n\nA live mic picks up a slur spoken by the boss of a dictionary-editing team, setting his office of lexicographers working to define a troubling word, and maybe—when the remark goes “viral”—navigating the damage. Laughs ensue, but also issues about office politics, sexism, cancel culture, the internet, censorship, and who gets to say what we get to say.\n\nBrooks Appelbaum of Connecticut Critics Circle, reviewing the play’s premiere at Playhouse on Park in West Hartford almost a year ago, said that Jacqueline Bircher’s Webster’s Bitch “hits many topical notes in a sharp and entertaining way and introduces us to a world we may know little to nothing about: the world of lexicography, or of keeping dictionaries correct and current.”\n\nFor the New Haven Theater Company, Webster’s Bitch is a match made in heaven: a single-location set, a small cast of five that stretches from elders, in their fifties, to juniors, in their thirties, and a lone twentysomething who plays gadfly to her elders. And action that is dialogue-driven, and smart, funny, and relevant, about “issues that interest the company.”\n\nCompany member Susan Kulp, who proposed the play to the NHTC, was unable to take part due to the fact that she’s been busy acting in productions all over the state (Beauty and the Beast at Legacy Theater, Grumpy Old Men at Seven Angels Theatre, and currently The Executioner’s Wife at Milford Arts Council). The other Company members who might fit the parts best were also unavailable (most of them had already been involved this year in NHTC’s highly successful, sold-out run of Cry It Out). And so, an occurrence unprecedented in NHTC’s long life: the majority of the cast was secured through auditions.\n\nNHTC member Ralph Buonocore plays Frank, the boss; Buonocore was last seen at NHTC in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest as Mancini; the other cast-members are making their debut at NHTC: Lillian Garcia, a regular actor at Square One in Stratford, plays Joyce, Frank’s chief assistant at the office; Abby Klein, an actor newly returned to New Haven and the stage, plays Gwen, a lexicographer also in charge of social media; Gavin Whelan, an actor whose past work mostly took place in Indiana, plays Nick, another lexicographer; and Lisa DeAngelis, who acted recently in Fairview with Collective Consciousness Theatre and in Angels in America at Madison Lyric Stage, plays Ellie, Gwen’s younger sister. A recently departed third lexicographer is never seen but her successful brokering of a published novel is a topic of discussion.\n\nCompany stalwarts Margaret Mann and John Watson direct, having joined forces four times before for NHTC, co-directing the productions of The Dumb Waiter, Retreat from Moscow, Love Song and, most recently, Goldfish. One could say that all the plays they’ve worked on together have been focused on intense interrelations, sometimes in a family, or between a couple or, as here, among co-workers, or, in The Dumb Waiter, between hitmen waiting to hear from their boss. The co-directors work well together, Mann said, because their “sensibilities are very different”; Mann who approaches directing from an actor’s perspective, is concerned about “what feels right”; Watson, while building on his training, likes to encounter “new ideas” from collaboration.\n\nTheir camaraderie can be easily grasped in how comfortable they are in talking about the play, which they both found fascinating as a treatment of how language evolves and changes, and how individuals react differently to provocative language. Ellie, as a catalyst, has no filter, and Watson suspected that older viewers might find themselves in sympathy with Joyce who has to keep things running smoothly regardless of personal feelings.\n\nBoth co-directors felt that the two lexicographers—especially Gwen—set the tone for what the play is getting at, though as Watson pointed out, the play’s conclusion is “open-ended, leaving the audience hanging between competing agendas.” Whether dictionaries or other linguistic authorities should be descriptive—changing as language usage changes—or prescriptive—indicating what is correct and therefore unchanging. Mann said the play makes us “think about how many usages” there can be for any word, and, as Watson added, “where and who uses it.” He noted that those “deeply offended by bad language” may find the script a bit off-putting. “It’s not about vulgarity,” he quickly added, “but about what’s offensive and what’s not and why.”\n\nA matter of taste, or a task for the policing of personal expression?\n\nWebster’s Bitch plays at New Haven Theater Company, 839 Chapel Street, next Thursday, May 9, 7:30 pm, and Friday, May 10, and Saturday, May 11, at 8 pm; those three shows have been listed as Sold Out, as is the show Thursday, May 16, 7:30 pm; tickets are still available for the shows at 8 pm on Friday, May 17, and Saturday, May 18. Go here for tickets.\n\nEach time we step out of that quiet, very English garden into Mrs. Jarrett’s flights (whether of fantasy or witness or prophecy we are never altogether sure) we are met first with a booming sound and blinding lights illuminating the audience. The device certainly creates tension, but undermines what I feel certain are meant to be comical elements in Mrs. Jarrett’s speeches. In Diamond’s production, LaTonya Borsay’s delivery has an almost unvarying pitch of barely suppressed panic. But even panic can become monotonous, and that may well be why the paucity of our imaginations is nowhere more pertinent than in the previsioning of apocalyptic scenarios. Churchill’s are richer than the norm but you’ll really have to concentrate to perceive her throughlines.\n\nWithin the garden, conversation moves agreeably amidst a range of topics, mostly small talk that serves to orient Mrs. Jarrett within the longstanding rapport of the other three, which allows them to speak in half-phrases and asides and addendums. The orchestration of the dialogue is brilliantly handled throughout. The play runs for under an hour, but you may find you would like to visit with these amiable women for much longer.\n\nThere are comments about grandchildren, former occupations, getting out of the house (or not), and acute observations (such as how neighboring countries are more likely to be antagonistic). The interplay of topics can sometimes put one or another on the spot, as when Sally talks about her testimony on behalf of Vi, when the latter was accused of murdering her husband. Such matters crop up with a comical matter-of-factness that is also speculative, as if the settled nature of these routine lives can be quite easily disrupted by a word or two too wide or too pointed.\n\nAnd that of course is how these cursory topics relate to Mrs. Jarrett’s speeches, Churchill providing a verbal barrage that shows how we chatter upon a precipice and how hard it is to make speech work for us as more than directed sounds, as Lena puts it: “why move your mouth and do talking?”\n\nReview of Cry It Out, New Haven Theater Company\n\nA play that looks at the expectations that drive and surround motherhood, Molly Smith Metzler’s Cry It Out is funny and touching, and thought-provoking. The story focuses on two new mothers inhabiting different social levels but sharing a joyful preoccupation with their newfound roles. Both are on maternity leave from work, but Lina (Deena Nicol-Blifford), a cheery and earthy medical worker, already knows when her time will be up. Jessie (Jenny Schuck), a lawyer who may be up for partnership, is wrestling with her desire to remain a fulltime mom and not return to the workforce, despite the plans of her husband, Nate (never seen).\n\nThe play’s action takes place in the adjacent backyards of the women’s homes where the duo relax during nap times with coffee and confidences. We learn a lot about how these women see themselves and the issues and joys of parenthood, and their rapport is heartening and entertaining. Lina, while she can take potshots aplenty at the tastes and assumptions of her friend (“Whole Foods? The nightmare is complete.”), seeks mainly to put Jessie at ease and to find and be a genuine friend. Her life is fraught with a mother and a stepmother who each in her way is a trial, and she knows that without her continued income the family will sink. Jessie, who has more options in life, has to wrestle with Nate’s longing for a home in Montauk next to his well-heeled parents, and her own traumatic memories of a birth that nearly didn’t happen.\n\nInto this inviting give-and-take intrudes Mitchell (Ruben Ortiz), an awkward visitor from the much fancier neighborhood on the hill that overlooks the backyard (literally overlooks, as Mitchell has a telescope for watching the cozy coffee klatch). His reason? He is worried about his wife Adrienne and, in his view, her problems with new motherhood. His solution? To get her to mix with these fiercely fun moms and learn the ropes.\n\nJessie’s OK to that plan is the first rift between the friends, though Lina tries to put a good face on it (while not for a minute swallowing her ill will or disbelief). Nicol-Blifford’s Lina can be depended on to indicate all her feelings and to laugh off, mostly, what can’t be helped. She’s a hearty, engaging character that could have been written for this actress, so naturally does Nicol-Blifford seem to grasp her mannerisms and speech rhythms. Shuck’s Jessie is more tightly wound and careworn. She seems to get through life by not expressing her real feelings and so her ability to voice profanity with Lina is the kind of license to be herself that she’s long been seeking. But it’s a given that Adrienne will be more like her than like Lina.\n\nAdrienne (Melissa Anderson), it turns out, isn’t much like either. She has no problem expressing her utter disdain, asserting her professional status—as a jewelry designer soon to be carried by Barney’s—and denying any maternal anxiety such as her husband fears; in any case, unlike the other two, she has a support staff to help her. In fact, the other two women have already met Adrienne’s daughter’s nanny and the little girl herself, a telling indication of the social norms of child-raising in this zip code.\n\nAs played with a coiled bitterness by Anderson, Adrienne is a welcome riposte to the easy assumptions about home and husbands shared by the other two. Because we meet Mitchell without seeing the spouses of the other two women, we are privy (as are they) to the “he said/she said” nature of relations between Mitchell and Adrienne. And when Adrienne turns up again, she has a read on the situation that completely offsets Mitchell’s as well as Jessie’s diagnosis. That’s when the glass houses nature of these relations becomes fraught for all, and for us as we look on at the privacy of parenting made public.\n\nAs usual, NHTC, in this lively production directed by Marty Tucker (in his directing debut with the troupe), plays to its strengths. A single set, two main characters and two ancillary characters—all fully inhabited and easy to confuse with the actors themselves, the performances feel so natural—and a swift run-time of 90 minutes with no intermission.\n\nThere are many blackouts for quick changes, during which some kind of kid-friendly sing-song plays, the sort of thing I would mock incessantly to my own daughter, but that’s just me. My only cavil about the production is that Mitchell seems to collapse in tears before a stranger a bit too readily for the type he seems to be. But his renovation in the last scene is handled very capably by Ortiz, so much so that we might expect to see Cry It Out 2: Daddy’s Home, where working moms leave the little ones in the newly aware care of stay-at-home dads.\n\nComic and thoughtful and closely observed, NHTC’s Cry It Out cries out to be seen. Two additional shows have been added to the initial run.\n\nCry It Out\n\nBy Molly Smith Metzler\n\nDirected by Marty Tucker\n\nCast: Melissa Anderson, Deena Nicol-Blifford, Ruben Ortiz, Jenny Schuck\n\nNew Haven Theater Company\n\nFebruary 22, 23, 24, 29; March 1, 2, 8, 9, 2024\n\nPreview of Cry It Out, New Haven Theater Company\n\nThis coming week the New Haven Theater Company returns with a spirited production of Molly Smith Metzler’s popular play, Cry It Out. You might think the title refers directly to the parenting philosophy which advocates leaving a child to “self-soothe” by crying until the child learns to settle into sleep. In fact, the “cry” in “cry it out” has more to do with what Jessie and Lina, two mothers of small children, are feeling as they try to navigate motherhood and working careers.\n\nMarty Tucker has acted with New Haven Theater Company before—most notably in their production of Marjorie Prime in 2019 and in White Rabbit, Red Rabbit last year—but this show will be his debut as a director with NHTC, though he has directed many other shows (mostly Shakespeare). He said that he had been planning to direct a different play for NHTC, but the play required a larger cast than was readily available. In the NHTC method, any member can suggest a play for the company, who then all read it and discuss what might work best. Cry It Out came up for consideration and Tucker immediately loved it.\n\n“I was laughing as I read it,” he said, and felt certain he could find the right actors for the roles. Besides the two friends—from different backgrounds, with different paygrades in their working lives—there is an additional woman, Adrienne, a neighbor who visits, goaded by her husband, Mitchell, who feels his wife needs a sort of motherhood support group. A four-character play is familiar territory for NHTC, which has also mounted several classic two-handers, such as Zoo Story and The Dumb Waiter.\n\nTucker knew he wanted NHTC member Deena Nicol-Blifford for Lina, so much so that her participation was key to his taking on the play. Jenny Schuck, who has played in some of NHTC’s larger cast productions, such as Almost, Maine in 2013 and Rumors in 2018, as well as taking on one night of White Rabbit, Red Rabbit, plays Jessie, the principal role. “Jenny as Jessie, Deena as Lina . . . it had to be,” Tucker joked. Melissa Anderson, who played Walt Disney’s daughter in Lucas Hnath’s A Public Reading of an Unproduced Screenplay on the Death of Walt Disney at NHTC in 2017, takes on what Tucker called “the difficult role” of Adrienne, and, in another NHTC debut, Ruben Ortiz, the Artistic Director of New Haven’s A Broken Umbrella Theater, plays Mitchell.\n\n“The cast is so good together,” Tucker enthused, “there is camaraderie, bantering, and they are so very generous.” He also complimented his cast’s work ethic: even though rehearsals have had to be restricted to weekends for the most part, the cast clearly works over material when not together. “Any suggestions I make are already incorporated the next time we meet,” he said with a kind of awe, “there is a lot of rapport and that helps to make the characters likeable. Because if they’re not likeable, you’re in trouble.”\n\n“This one is going to be special,” Tucker said, “I’m thrilled” that the very entertaining play is being fully realized by this talented team. He noted how, when he first read the text, he was still thinking about it three days later. “At some point you go ‘wow,’ and think how awful and poignant” the characters’ situations are. It’s a play that offers much to think about, but with much heart, compassion, and laughter.\n\nIn terms of set, the play also works to NHTC strengths: a good all-purpose space that has considerable intimacy. The action takes place in Jessie’s backyard, but, Tucker said, the floorboards of the NHTC stage wouldn’t be convincing. They put down Astroturf only to have a very fake-looking lawn. NHTC member Trevor Williams then painted the turf, giving the set “the look of the kinds of winter lawns you see around here” (or until the recent snow covered them).\n\nA play about parenting that, in NHTC’s words, “takes an honest look at the absurdities of being home with a baby, the power of female friendship, the dilemma of going back to work, and the effect class has on parenthood in America.” Cry It Out is a play about coping, and might help us cope with winter in Connecticut, providing a welcome warmth.\n\nCry It Out\n\nBy Molly Smith Metzler\n\nDirected by Marty Tucker\n\nNew Haven Theater Company\n\nFebruary 22, 23, 24, 29 (sold out); March 1 (sold out), March 2\n\nNote: February 22 and 29 at 7:30 p.m.; all other shows at 8 p.m.\n\nFor tickets: Cry It Out\n\nThe New Haven Theater Company is: Melissa Andersen, Ralph Buonocore, Sara Courtemanche, Drew Gray, Erich Greene, George Kulp, Susan Kulp, Margaret Mann, Deena Nicol-Blifford, Sandra Rodriguez, Steve Scarpa, Jenny Schuck, J. Kevin Smith, Aleta Staton, John Strano, Marty Tucker, John Watson, Jodi Williams, and Trevor Williams\n\nSimona remains isolated by her trauma; her attempt to seek help is handled by a very facile and uninterested doctor (Rodrigo) who views her on-again, off-again haunting by a shadowy figure in her imagination as an hallucination. For Simona, it can only be a residual image of an interrogator who brutalized her father during an inferred incarceration. In a sense, Simona’s unwavering interpretation of what is causing her suffering becomes a form of obsession. The play starts to feel like listening to a recounting of personal and familial grief at an AA meeting, without being able to intervene or ask questions or even offer solace.\n\nBensussen does all she can to interject visual and theatrical interest into such a heavily verbal play: Hartford Stage’s space is put to good use with lively choreography by Shura Baryshnikov and projections by Yana Biryukov that can be both lovely—the blossoms—and eerie—that shadowy figure; Yu Shibagaki’s scenic design makes the shows few props seem to have metamorphic properties, while the lighting design by Aja M. Jackson and the sound design by Aubrey Dube are superb.\n\nThe show’s best theatrical moment is an interlude with a romantically inclined, French-accented, human-sized lab rat (Olivera Gajic, costume design) who steals the show. As the rat, Christopher Bannow shows yet again what a versatile actor he is, always a major asset to any production he’s in (as for instance last year’s Wolf Play at MCC in New York). The scene works because of the careful choreography and because of a sense of absurdity, fun, and weirdness—the flipside, I suppose, of a traumatic visitation.\n\nWhatever we make of such an interlude is up to us as viewers, which is a lot better than having someone onstage telling us what everything must mean. I left the play not so much impressed by Simona’s search for the truth as cautioned by her certainty.\n\nWhat keeps us in the story is the fine work by this ensemble of actors. As Boseman Senior, Julian Elijah Martinez fully inhabits a part that can be a bit underwritten. He doesn’t get major speeches, but works the small, intense moments of interaction, like mocking and helping his son while the latter has trouble with his bootlaces. A great scene later in the play has Senior and Junior one-upping each other on chin-ups: it’s wonderfully indicative of how they do and don’t get along, and how much they are cut from the same cloth. As Nedra, Toni Martin has to walk a fine line: she’s encouragement itself to her son but at the same time has to be believable as a woman who is living a lie. It’s a tough sell, and we could use a few scenes that let us see her as she really is. In supporting roles as the women trying to get to know the somewhat taciturn Boseman Salvages, Mikayla LaShae Bartholomew keeps us guessing about Paulina: she likes dumping on brunchers, regales Junior with lines from King Lear at will, and is able to get through Senior’s wall when necessary (and so seems like she was simply written to inhabit this play with no other purpose in life); McKenzie Chinn, as Elinor, is more upfront: she meets Senior, likes what she sees, goes for it, and then must confront the suppressed story that hangs over the family. She’s the one who, ultimately, must be won over if any good is going to be salvaged from the situation the Salvages are in.\n\nThe other two characters onstage in this four-woman show are Lizzie’s older sister Emma (Courtney Bassett) who mainly stirs the cauldron that is Lizzie’s seething nerves, and Brigid (Nora Schell), aka Maggie, the Irish tell-all servant who keeps an eye on everyone and has her own view of what’s really going on. She’s a bit of a Greek chorus but, as such, her role could be more developed as a consistent perspective on the events is what the show lacks. Brigid could be a welcome touch of realism to act as foil to the authors’ Lizzie fantasies.\n\nAs with most rock operas worthy of the name—such as Jesus Christ Superstar and Tommy—there are songs that are plot devices and there are songs that can detach from the story and stand on their own, more or less. Here, standout instances of the former would be “Why Are All These Heads Off” or “What the Fuck, Lizzie?\" while of the latter would be the rocker \"Sweet Little Sister,” with Emma as lead, and Alice’s plaintive but lovely “Will You Stay?”. All four performers in the show are distinctive and entertaining and fun to listen to—as is that rocking band, with particular mention for drummer Molly Plaisted. Onah puts a lot of soul in her singing which helps considerably as do Schell’s upper range blasts. Shepherd brings the requisite rock star wail to her sound which—if you’re of a certain age—may have you reliving some of those Heart fantasies you had as a teen. Meanwhile, Bassett—in the show’s latter going—fully rocks her couture, looking the type of woman David Bowie may have wished he was on occasion.\n\nAn unexpected high point is the choral song “Watchmen for the Morning” which at least points to a higher common cause for the Borden sisters; the song lets us stand for a moment in that space where one’s legal guilt or innocence is a matter of what others determine, and where—maybe—one’s existential guilt or innocence can be left to the Lord’s plan.\n\nAll in all, it’s an entertaining show, though its details could be considered a bit harrowing and it’s not “all in fun.” Real people really died in the house of Borden, and Lizzie either had real grievances that drove her to murder, or else imagined ones, or else . . . she didn’t do it at all. But Lizzie’s Lizzie, who has grievances and a lover and a sister and motives and opportunity, is still claiming she didn’t do it—in the play—while asserting—rock concert-style—she sure did, fuck yeah. Uplifting? Maybe. Uplifted, at least—like an axe to grind.\n\nHaving said all that, there’s not a lot more to say, in terms of story. Which is why I mentioned “sit-com”: the predominant feeling is that we are spending time with these characters, getting to know them as they get to know each other and (as in your favorite workplace comedy) what we learn will be sometimes amusing—as for instance, Rafael’s BB gun bank hold-up—and sometimes wrenching, as for instance Montrellous’ tale of a bad decision followed by a real act of sacrifice. The main plot point, I’d say, is whether or not Clyde will relent and actually try one of Montrellous’s unique sandwich productions.\n\nClyde constantly puts down the crew—individually and collectively—and won’t entertain any notion that they are earning respect (not even after a newspaper write-up designates the kitchen’s productions as “sublime”) nor that any of them should have any feeling but a squalid sort of humble gratitude to her for giving them jobs and keeping them on. She’s a bully and an asshole and she loves it. Latonia Phipps luxuriates in the part but I have to say it got a bit one-note. It may be the point that Clyde doesn’t soften or sympathize (“I don’t do pity,” she boasts), but that only means we—like her employees—get sick of her that much quicker. In the words of that Nobel Laureate: “I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes: you’d know what a drag it is to see you.” (The only thing that makes us glad to see Clyde again? the costume changes! Alexis Carrie, Costumes.)\n\nBut aren’t bosses often a drag? I can attest it’s so, and so it is here. Do we like the other characters? Yes, and it’s fun seeing/hearing who gets feedback—as cheers, laughs, applause—from the live audience. That “you are there” element works to great effect in TheaterWorks’ small theater and small but very lively stage. I’ll say my favorite character the night I saw the show was Kashayna Johnson’s Letitia (wonderfully filing in as an understudy); she has the best vantage on her co-workers, seeming to have the insight to grasp who they really are and who they’re trying to become, even as she herself is working to be better. She’s the soul of the place even more than Montrellous. As the latter, Chenevert has the requisite thoughtfulness and measured movements of a man who could’ve been so much more and might yet be, but his detachment doesn’t make him as sympathetic. Gómez's Rafael is winning and outgoing, and his outbursts of feeling do a lot to drive up the drama. As Jason, Patterson broods well but also has a great sense of comic timing, making Jason’s arc of change the most fun to watch.\n\nBut don’t take my word for it: get into TheaterWorks and spend some time watching this crew for yourself—if you can tear yourself away from the latest from Christopher Nolan and Greta Gerwig. Anyway, those films will likely be here for weeks.

What helps sustain our interest in this collection of actors--Wiletta Mayer (Heather Alicia Simms), Sheldon Forrester (Michael Rodgers), Bill O’Wray (James Joseph O’Neil), Judy Sears (Sarah Lyddan), Millie Davis (Chelsea Lee Williams), and John Nevins (Sideeq Heard)—is the way they play with the parts in the Belleville play and play their own roles in the process of creating theater. So, while Judy might seem at first a perky airhead, that’s partly because her ingenue role expects it of her; meanwhile, a practiced dissembler like Sheldon Forrester—the elder in the company—knows how to act “the darkie” in a way that puts white egos at ease, while also asserting himself—via voice and histrionic presence—as an actor in the grand manner. Bill O’Wray, a soap opera star, treats every role as a job he pretty much plays the same way, not interested in interacting with the cast or exploring method; Millie Davis shows off gaudy jewelry to convince her colleagues she doesn’t really need to act, so well-off is her husband, and so maintains a certain aloofness; John Nevins is the newbie, earnest and ingratiating but his ambition—to use the play as a vehicle to launch his career—is as real as anything. Then there’s Wiletta Mayer, who reluctantly emerges as the conscience of the cast, a role for which she hasn’t fully explored all the implications.\n\nWe first meet Wiletta as she arrives earliest to rehearsal. This gives her the opportunity to interact with Henry, an aging theater-hand who remembers a grand theatrical moment in her past career—for which he designed the lighting. With that exchange, Childress stresses her sense of theater: it’s ephemeral even at its best, and yet—as an experience—it can create a longstanding awareness shared by these two who achieved something together even if only meeting for the first time. The tension between who they are at their best—in the theater—and who they are otherwise (just folks) is clear from the start. That contrast inspires mostly comic deliveries, but Betts downplays Childress’ satire as though the target of playing at playing is too easy and too readily assessed. What does emerge is that “Tomming”—assuaging white egos by playing up to them, like an “Uncle Tom”—is key to success for black actors but that some version of such dissembling (kissing-ass) is an element generally present wherever hierarchies preside. So that Eddie (Adam Langdon), the white put-upon assistant to the white director Al Manners (John Bambery) is pretty much always “Tomming,” as is Henry.\n\nIn my view, the biggest problem with the Hartford Stage production of this intriguing play is John Bambery’s Al Manners. Having seen a very nuanced rendering of this character in another production, I have a hard time getting a read on why Manners is so incessantly tiresome. Bambery approaches his lines as if hacking away at blocks of ice, whereas the character—as a director who feels he’s actually progressive while having to deal with indignities on all sides (from an ex-wife, from his producers, from his cast, and his underlings)—has a trajectory to run: from seeming to know how this works to not having a definite conviction any longer. It’s worth mentioning the weak point of the production because it seems to me that the strength of the real director’s approach is Christopher Betts’ willingness to push this play until “not having a definite conviction” is a state of affairs that can’t really be improved and can only be endured.\n\nEarly on, Manners tries to lord it over Wiletta, after she sings a song in the play with the kind of subdued, spiritualist fervor she knows he wants. Not content, he eggs her on with “word association” and other Method techniques to make her question and “justify” her choices. The next rendition has a different register, much closer to “we shall overcome,” a rallying cry. Manners rejects the innovation at once and so the cast (and us) see that he’s all bluster, not really wanting to find new possibilities in trite material. It’s a fully present moment, convincingly played.\n\nMore questionable is a key moment in Act Two: the play—Chaos in Belleville—is an “anti-lynching” play in which a young black man gets lynched (though other outcomes might be possible). Someone says that none present have ever seen a lynching and that’s when Sheldon Forrester speaks up. He has, and proceeds to describe what he saw. In Rodgers’ delivery as Forrester, the tale takes on a rhapsodic feel, working against the excruciating detail of what he tells. It’s as if Betts has chosen to let Forrester—a thoroughly theatrical presence—turn actual oppression into aria (as theater will do again and again). The point is that Childress’s play, in openly questioning, through Wiletta Mayer, all the givens of a play like Chaos in Belleville, with its crowd-pleasing and guilt-assuaging BS, also questions how to render the theatrical reality of her own play, a question that Betts’ production worries to the end.\n\nAccording to Arminda Thomas’ account in the show’s playbill, the play’s ending continued to be an issue. When the play was bound for Broadway, Childress baulked at the suggested ending (the actors all agree with Wiletta against Manners) and the play was not produced; as late as 1992, for a London production, Childress reworked the ending. The problem of the ending, we could say, is that the play can’t solve it. No actor, no director hired to put on a particular play can really change it to make it their own play. What is needed is a black female playwright able to write a better play than Chaos in Belleville, and—while she knows she is that playwright—Childress chooses to write a play that dramatizes that need rather than resolving it. At play’s end, it’s not Wiletta we have to believe in but in Childress, in Lorraine Hansberry, in Adrienne Kennedy, in Suzan-Lori Parks. We know they are coming, but they’re not there yet (in the play).\n\nBy restaging this early confrontational play, Betts lets us work through the problems that won’t go away: How to authentically enact what you never experienced when so many want to own a particular history? The cast becomes more and more convinced that they don’t know how the play should be rendered, as if in a proto “We Are Proud to Present a Presentation…” (which Betts directed while a graduate student), and Childress knows there is real drama in that realization. Or: How to put audiences on the hook and then let them off the hook so that they go away feeling vindicated for their sensitivity? That element—which we can say is still the earmark of the successful play able to enact uplift from suffering—is already questioned by Wiletta’s different renderings of a song, or by her choice at the end of making a speech where the principal of radical theater requires her not to do it “in character,” but however she happens to feel right now, as we conclude. And how we feel about that is all about whether or not we are with her as she grapples with the constraints and the freedoms her playwright and her director (Childress and Betts) put upon her.\n\nThe “trouble” of Trouble in Mind is that it’s purpose is to trouble the waters, not resolve the issues. Our task is to watch the agitation and think through its implications. To keep all that trouble in mind, until it does someone some good.\n\nTrouble in Mind\n\nBy Alice Childress\n\nDirected by Christopher D. Betts\n\nScenic Design: Baron E.

Much of the interest comes from the quirkiness of Soleimanpour, who speaks in the script in his own voice, describing his situation (in 2010) when he could not leave Iran because he refused to perform military service. His play traveled the globe in his stead. What’s more, the problem of how to reach distant audiences is answered, sort of, by making them interact with his play. And so much of his play is about the theatrics themselves, making the space we inhabit during the play potentially very lively.\n\nThemes do surface, such as: who’s in charge here? Is it incumbent upon the audience to do whatever the Actor voicing the script asks? Does the Actor have to do whatever the script says? Are participants allowed to ad lib? Soleimanpour gives out his email address during the play and wants the audience to keep their phones on (though not to take calls!) so that they can send him updates if they choose.\n\nMuch of what concerns the play has to do with the element of risk in theater, but also a further contextual risk that Soleimanpour feels as a citizen without full freedom of movement or speech. Soleimanpour spends a lot of time telling us about experiments in which white rabbits come to accept the convention of attacking, first, a rabbit who gets dyed red for climbing a ladder to get a carrot, and, later, any rabbit that climbs the ladder.\n\nSoleimanpour, we see, spends a lot of time thinking about who gets singled out for attack.\n\nHe also spends time thinking about how a play can be like a gun, aimed to bring about a certain outcome, by coercion, by threat, but also a prop you can play Russian Roulette with. And that’s an important element in the play’s conclusion.\n\nThat much is safe to say, but to go into any more particulars about the play I’d have to put in a Spoiler Alert. Mind you, there’s no particular reason why you (as potential audience member) should know as little about the play as the Actor does, but it does make for a more interesting evening. I can say that because I saw a production of the play at Yale Cabaret over a decade ago, when the play was new, and seeing it again, with New Haven Theater Company, I didn’t feel the same uneasy “where is this going?” feeling that is perhaps key to what makes this such an interesting night of theater. If you know where it’s going and what questions it turns on, it’s much easier to just sit back and watch what happens.\n\nBut the play, with all its unpredictable audience participation, works to generate a feeling that what is happening is happening right now and might not happen again. At least not with the particular Actor (who might just die!) and the particular audience (which may or may not find that daring) of any particular performance.\n\nSteve Scarpa, the night I saw the show, was a good-natured stand-in for us. That’s how I felt about it. Like we were all in this together: he had the task of reading the script to us and doing some daffy things, and also bringing members of the audience up and getting them to do some minimal or questionable things, and we had the task of cheering him on. And some of us were asked to do certain things on cue. (I liked the guy with a cane who seemed to be ready to just ad lib the thing away from Scarpa’s patient master of ceremonies.) I have to admit, too, that I took over the role of the final “red rabbit” who reads the script aloud after the Actor is told to relinquish it. That part, I should think, will play very differently each night, depending on how the Actor reacts to what’s asked of him or her at the end.\n\nWhen I saw it before, in an atmosphere fostered by late night theater among a lot of students, the feeling was lighter, with the audience glad to have opportunities to intervene. At NHTC on Saturday night, that interventionist element was absent and there was a much more casual feeling, at least until Scarpa’s very serious demeanor after he went “off book.” At that point the silence of the Actor is striking as he becomes what some audience members have been at times: someone asked to do something on cue. Each Actor will have to play the last scene in their own way.\n\nWhat will it be like with the remaining three Actors? Head down to New Haven Theater Company and get in the act.\n\nWhite Rabbit, Red Rabbit\n\nBy Nassim Soleimanpour\n\nNew Haven Theater Company\n\nMay 11-20, 2023\n\nChristina Anderson’s evocative memory play, the ripple, the wave that carried me home is long on exposition, layering in a lots of details across a range of eras to give context and political implication to much of what Janice, who speaks directly to the audience a good deal of the time, wants to impart to us. Jennean Farmer presents Janice in a forthright, engaging way but we might sometimes wonder why she’s telling us all this; that question is effectively offset by the fact that Janice herself is not altogether sure. She’s navigating her past, looking for where the flow of memory snags, as it were. Farmer is particularly adept at rendering the very fluid ages in which we see Janice and their different contexts.\n\nThe scenic elements of the play—most involving her parents Edwin (Marcus Henderson) and Helen (Chalia La Tour) and Aunt Gayle (Adrienne S. Wells)—play as enacted recollections which lends them a kind of detachment that, as the play goes on, even begins to supply a certain element of wish fulfillment. Janice is trying to figure out the past, to find a relation to her father and mother that lives up to the truth but which also lets her find meaning she can value. And that’s the throughline that holds us: because there are some rough patches Janice has to cope with and how they register will say much about their ultimate status in her sense of herself. The way “who we were when” tends to."
