        "text": "Case MM\n\nBiography\n\nMM is a 63-year-old, right-handed, never-married man who was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. He was an only child whose parents divorced when he was young. His father was an artist and his mother worked as a staff member at U.S. embassies around the world before she married. Neither of his parents was known to have unusual memory abilities. MM has a paternal half-sister who he met for the first time in 2012. MM has no contact with extended family.\n\nThe subject was raised by his mother and reports an unremarkable early development. He attended Catholic schools and graduated high school in 1970. He attended one year of college before dropping out. He held a number of clerical and customer service positions, the longest of which was 4 years. MM reports being occupationally disabled since age 40 by major depressive disorder with prominent anxiety. He is treated with sertraline, aripiprazole, and weekly psychotherapy. He has no history of neurological disorder.\n\nOther than one year as a young adult, MM has lived his entire life in Baltimore. He has changed residences very frequently, mostly due to roommate or financial problems, and admits to being homeless for short periods of time. He currently lives alone in a rented apartment and subsists on Social Security payments. He doesn’t drive and does not own a computer or use the Internet. MM has six close friends, both male and female, with whom he socializes, but he spends most of his days alone.\n\nOn a typical day, MM awakens around 11:00 a.m. or noon. He eats the same breakfast every day. He will then listen to news or talk radio for about three hours before enjoying a light lunch of fruit. In the afternoon, he typically listens to classical music while doing household chores until 5:00 or 6:00 p.m., and then he will go out. He will walk around his neighborhood, shop at local stores, or visit the library. Three evenings a week, he visits local taverns where he will have one beer or a soft drink, converse with the “regulars,” strike up conversations with strangers, and compete in trivia contests. He adamantly denies ever drinking excessively. Other evenings, he will return from errands, watch movies on TV, and telephone friends. He eats dinner alone at 10:00 p.m., and will then read before going to sleep around 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. He enjoys Shakespeare and seeks out low-cost, community theater productions. He also follows local collegiate sports teams and attends their games.\n\nMemory Abilities\n\nMM contacted the first author after hearing him on a public radio program concerning memory disorders. He reported an uncanny ability to remember historical facts and dates, sports statistics, and popular culture trivia. He provided copies of local newspaper articles about him dating from the early 1980s, when he was dubbed “the Amazing Memory Man” after pointing out an erroneous date on a major historical monument. A former long-distance runner, MM has a particular interest in athletic events, especially the Olympic Games. He can rattle off the names of athletes, winning times/scores, and medal winners (and losers) with ease. He also can report the historical significance of random dates. For example, given “May 18,” he will tell you “that was the birthdate of both Pope John Paul II, in 1920, and Baltimore Oriole [baseball player] Brooks Robinson, in Arkansas, in 1937. It was also that date that the Mt. Saint Helens volcano erupted in 1980.”\n\nMM expresses surprise that he remembers little about his life before the age of 7. As a youngster, he had a special interest in American history. He first became aware of his special memory ability at age “29 and 9 months,” when he compiled a list of all the historical facts that he could remember. He surprised himself (and others) by how long and detailed it was. Unlike the famous mnemonists “S” (Luria, 1968), Professor Aitken (Hunter, 1977), or “TE” (Gordon et al., 1984), each of whom could describe vividly the strategies or intellectual connections by which he learned and retained immense lists of material, MM is at a loss to explain his unusual memory abilities. Although he enjoys reading about topics of interest, he does not study, take written notes, employ elaborate mnemonics, or attempt to memorize facts. In his words, “they just stick.” Unlike autistic persons with savant syndrome, many of whom have exceptional memories (Neumann et al., 2010; O’Connor & Hermelin, 1991; Treffert, 2009), MM does not have calendrical or other extraordinary calculating skills. He also denies synesthesia, eidetic imagery, or the capacity to reexperience most days of his adult life in perceptual detail (e.g., clothes worn, meals eaten).\n\nWhen asked how he understands his talent, MM replies “it’s just something I can do.” He feels his memory is, on balance, a “gift,” but he also acknowledges that it is sometimes a handicap:\n\nThe sad and horrible things that have happened to me [e.g., the death of his mother, with whom he was very close; a mugging] are always in my mind. … Whenever the anniversary dates come up, they cause me sadness.\n\nMM reports no diminution of his memory abilities over the years. He stated, “If anything, I’m getting better at it.” He does not perceive any association between his memory and his mood disorder, nor any of the medications he has taken for it. Although some of the psychotherapists he has seen over the 27 years since his first mental health contact have encouraged retrospection and reminiscence, others have not.\n\nClinical Neuropsychological Findings\n\nWith his enthusiastic consent, MM was seen on multiple occasions in 2016 and early 2017 for interviewing and the administration of standardized neuropsychological tests and specialized tasks. Because this single case study is essentially an expanded clinical examination, it was exempted from review by our institutional review board.\n\nCognitive tests.\n\nMM’s global intellect is solidly average, with better verbal comprehension than perceptual reasoning (see ). His mental processing is very slow, and his constructional praxis (block construction and design copying) is poor. His new learning ability, as measured by the Wechsler Memory Scale and Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, is solidly average. His memory for auditory–verbal material is better than his memory for visual-spatial material. MM’s prospective memory is normal; he needed no reminders to ask for the return of a borrowed item at the end of the testing session (Bakker, Schretlen, & Brandt, 2002).\n\nTable 1\n\nTest and scorePercentile for ageWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (4th ed.)

He obtained scores within one standard deviation of the mean in all five domains: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness. In contrast to his slowed processing speed on neuropsychological testing and his reserved, solitary lifestyle, he describes himself as a warm and gregarious “go-getter,” with high scores in the facets of competence and achievement striving. On a psychopathology assessment, the Personality Assessment Inventory (Morey, 2007), MM generated an entirely valid profile. There was no indication that he attempted to present himself in an overly positive or negative light. None of the 11 clinical scales was elevated into the clinically significant range. He reported mild, subclinical, physical health concerns and anxiety, but no gross psychopathology.\n\nMM’s social history, quirkiness, obsessional features and pre-occupations have a savant-like character, his normal intellect notwithstanding (O’Connor & Hermelin, 1991; Treffert, 2009). Therefore, we screened for traits associated with high-functioning autism and Asperger’s syndrome. His overall score on the Autism Spectrum Questionnaire (AQ; Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley, 2001; Ruzich et al., 2015) is high normal. His only notably elevated trait score is on attention to detail. On the Cambridge Behavior Scale (“Empathy Questionnaire” [EQ]; Baron-Cohen & Wheelwright, 2004), his score is solidly in the normal range. Finally, MM was administered the Friendship Questionnaire (FQ; Baron-Cohen & Wheelwright, 2003) to assess the extent to which close, supportive, peer relationships are important to him. His score was typical for normal men and much higher than that of persons with Asperger’s syndrome or high-functioning autism. Based on the AQ and EQ, as well as multiple interviews with MM over many months, the Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA; Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Robinson, & Woodbury-Smith, 2005) was completed. MM was far from meeting diagnostic criteria for Asperger’s syndrome.\n\nDetailed Memory Assessment\n\nSeveral tasks exploring memory for the past, including both autobiographical events and generic, world knowledge, were administered to MM:\n\nAutobiographical memory.\n\nAutobiographical Memory Interview (AMI; Kopelman, Wilson, & Baddeley, 1989).\n\nThe AMI is one of the very few formal, semistandardized methods for assessing a subject’s recollection of his or her own life. Under optimal circumstances, a knowledgeable informant would be available to confirm the subject’s reports. However, MM assured us that he would say “I don’t know” or “I can’t remember” if he were unable to retrieve information from his past. However, this was never the case (see ). MM displayed excellent memory for both general semantic information about his life (i.e., facts) and specific, highly detailed, autobiographical incidents (i.e., episodes).\n\nTable 2\n\nPersonal semanticsAutobiographical incidentsPerformanceChildhoodEarly adulthoodRecent lifeChildhoodEarly adulthoodRecent lifeRaw score1920.521 9 9 9% of max. score 90.5% 97.6%100%100%100%100%\n\nSurvey of Autobiographical Memory (SAM; Palombo, Williams, Abdi, & Levine, 2013; Sheldon, Farb, Palombo, & Levine, 2016).\n\nThis well-validated instrument assesses self-reported memory on trait-like dimensions. Its 26 items measure a person’s preference for, and tendency to engage in, four particular types of autobiographical remembering: episodic, semantic, spatial, and projection into the future. MM’s standard scores (with means of 100) were Episodic = 123, Semantic = 123, Spatial = 112, and Future remembering = 91. Clearly, MM appreciates that his memory for personally experienced life events and general knowledge are both exceptional, whereas his imaging the future is only average.\n\nPersonal Residences Inventory.\n\nThere is good experimental evidence that residential relocations can serve as an organizing “scaffold” for autobiographical memory (Enz, Pillemer, & Johnson, 2016). In this newly developed task, MM was asked to report the complete address of every location where he resided for at least six months, starting with his current abode. As shown in , he could confidently recall the addresses of all 15 of his homes, occasionally forgetting only zip codes. His performance exceeds that of seven of the authors’ colleagues.\n\nGeneric memory.\n\nPresidents Test (Hamsher & Roberts, 1985; Roberts, Hamsher, Bayless, & Lee, 1990).\n\nWhen most American adults attempt to recall the names of U.S. presidents, either in chronological order or not, they generate the well-known serial position curve (with a “blip” for the 16th president, Abraham Lincoln; Roediger & Crowder, 1976; Roediger & DeSoto, 2014). Most normal subjects, of any generation, can recall the first 3 or 4 presidents and the most recent 7 or 8, but neglect to report those in between. Subject MM was asked to name all the U.S. presidents in reverse order, starting with the then-incumbent (Barack Obama). Not only was he able to recall all 44 presidents, in reverse order and without error, but he often sprinkled his reporting with amusing esoterica about them.\n\nRecognition of Celebrity Faces.\n\nMM was shown a grid of 20 color photographs of celebrities from the Northwestern University Famous Faces Test (Gefen et al., 2013) and asked to name them. The persons depicted include entertainers (e.g., Barbra Streisand, Sammy Davis, Jr.), world leaders (e.g., Condoleeza Rice, Pope John Paul II), and other cultural icons (e.g., Muhammad Ali, Princess Diana). MM named all of them with ease, hesitating only on Bill Gates. In addition, he volunteered the date of birth (and, where applicable, the date of death) for most of them. His accuracy was verified with Wikipedia and other Internet resources.\n\nOscar Test (Brandt & Benedict, 1993).\n\nMM was asked to match the title of each year’s Academy Award-winning Best Picture with the year that it won the award. His performance, compared with that of 25 neurologically normal persons averaging 69 years old (SD = 7), is shown in . His overall superior performance is obvious. For every movie in the nine hemidecades between the early 1940s and the early 1990s, MM’s dating was absolutely perfect. His poor performance for the most recent time period was due largely to a single gross error: he had never heard of the movie “Birdman,” and guessed that it was from 1930.\n\nDate Significance.\n\nMM was given 30 random dates (e.g., February 20, November 12), and asked to describe the importance of that date in history. Well-known holidays and other dates of historic significance (e.g., July 4, September 11) were avoided. An informal survey of our colleagues produced zero correct responses. MM was successful for 27 of the 30 dates. He often produced more than one correct historical fact for each date, and he occasionally supplemented these with personal memories. For example, for “July 21,” he paused, his eyes welled up with tears, and he said, “That’s the day my mom died, in 1987.” He then added, “The first major battle of the Civil War, the Battle of Bull Run, was on that date in 1861. Also, Cat Stevens, who wrote my favorite song, ‘Morning Has Broken,’ was born on July 21, 1948.” For one of the 30 dates, he was partially correct. He reported that November 26 was the date in 1963 that Albert DeSalvo, the accused Boston Strangler, murdered Joann Graf, his last victim. Actually, the correct date was November 23, 1963, and Ms. Graf was his next-to-last victim. For the two dates for which he could produce no historically important events, MM produced only personal memories (his grade school and high school graduations).\n\nFact Retrieval.\n\nMM was asked to provide one-word answers to 75 world knowledge questions. The questions were randomly sampled from among the 300 general information items originally compiled and normed by Nelson & Narens (Nelson & Narens, 1980) and more recently updated and renormed by Tauber and colleagues (Tauber, Dunlosky, Rawson, Rhodes, & Sitzman, 2013). MM’s accuracy as a function of item difficulty is compared with samples of college undergraduates in . Even for questions sampled from among the most difficult items, where the median probability of recall by college students was zero, MM was able to supply the correct answer 63.5% of the time. To provide an indication of his metamemory, MM was asked to rate the confidence of each of his responses (see ). When he was correct, he was very confident of his responses, regardless of item difficulty. When he stated he was just guessing or was incorrect, his rated confidence was lower overall, and was associated with item difficulty. This suggests intact memory monitoring ability.\n\nBrain Imaging\n\nTo explore the cerebral basis for his extraordinary memory, subject MM participated in two neuroimaging sessions. These were performed on a 3-Tesla Phillips scanner located at the F.M. Kirby Center for Brain Imaging at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. Scanning was conducted using a 32-channel head coil with higher order shims and SENSE (sensitivity encoding), and included both structural and functional MRI scans. The acquisitions were optimized to evaluate the anatomical features and functional contribution of the structures of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), and included a high-resolution structural scan of hippocampal subregions bilaterally.\n\nStructural imaging.\n\nStructural acquisitions consisted of: 1) a T1-weighted whole brain MP-RAGE scan with 231 oblique slices and a 0.65 mm isotropic resolution, 2) a T2-weighted structural scan consisting of 327 slices, an in-plane resolution of 1×1 mm and a slice thickness of 0.55 mm, and 3) a standard FLAIR MRI scan consisting of 24 slices, an in-plane resolution of 0.45 × 0.45 mm and a slice thickness of 4 mm with a 1 mm gap.\n\nInitial evaluation of the structural scans was performed by a clinical neuroradiologist, who reported “no gross structural abnormality. Multiple punctate white matter FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical regions, likely reflecting small vessel ischemic change.” However, careful review of MM’s high-resolution MP-RAGE scan revealed some peculiar features of his cerebral anatomy in two separate locations within the left MTL. First, the collateral sulcus, defining the anterior boundary of the perirhinal cortex, appears much deeper than typically observed ( ). Significant variation in the depth of the collateral sulcus is not unusual. In fact, a standard atlas of the mesial temporal cortex (Insausti et al., 1998) describes three categories: a “regular” sulcus (10–15 mm deep) was observed in 82% of cases, whereas a “shallow” sulcus (<10 mm deep) was observed in 16% of cases, and a “deep” sulcus (>15 mm deep) was observed in only 2% of cases. MM’s collateral sulcus was very deep, at 16.25 mm. In addition, whereas the collateral sulcus is usually fairly narrow, MM’s left sulcus appears much wider in the coronal view than is typical. Second, in the left perirhinal and entorhinal cortex, approximately 14 mm posterior to the most anterior boundary of the hippocampus, a circular band of white matter is seen encircling a ring-like section of gray matter ( ). As this area typically contains a clearly defined collateral sulcus demarcating the perirhinal and entorhinal banks of the collateral sulcus, it is difficult to determine if this ring-like inclusion represents either entorhinal or perirhinal cortex. These unusual anatomical features were observed only in MM’s left temporal lobe; his right medial temporal anatomy was entirely unremarkable and consistent with the typical MTL described in the Insausti atlas.\n\nTo evaluate the MTL with volumetric quantification methods, we manually segmented the structures of interest using the high-resolution MP-RAGE scan following previously described methods (Bakker, Kirwan, Miller, & Stark, 2008; Bakker et al., 2012; Kirwan, Jones, Miller, & Stark, 2007). Briefly, using the atlas by Duvernoy (Duvernoy, 2005), hippocampal subfields were defined on eight coronal slices along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Representative coronal slices that closest match the atlas were selected and segmented according to the atlas description. The intermediate slices were then segmented in both directions slice-by-slice to provide a smooth transition across slices. The labels for the CA3 region and the dentate gyrus (DG) are combined, as it remains difficult to tease apart these subfields on 3T MRI scans. The entorhinal and perirhinal cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus were segmented according to the delineations described by Insausti (Insausti et al., 1998). (See examples of the manual segmentation in .) The resulting segmentation across the full length of the bilateral MTL was then used to provide a quantification of the volume of these structures. Results from subject MM were compared with that of five age-matched neurologically normal men. Volume of both the left and right hippocampal subregions—including the DG/CA3, CA1 and subiculum—were comparable in subject MM and the control sample ( ). However, the volume of the temporal polar cortex was considerable larger in MM than in the control sample, particularly on the right. In addition, MM’s right perirhinal cortex was lower in volume than average; the left entorhinal cortex was possibly smaller as well. These differences do not appear to be the result of differences in overall brain size, as MM’s total intracranial volume was indistinguishable from that of the control group ( ). Volumes of the left perirhinal cortex, right entorhinal cortex and bilateral parahippocampal cortex were no different between MM and the control sample ( ).\n\nFunctional imaging.\n\nFunctional acquisitions consisted of two resting state functional MRI scans with high-resolution echoplanar images collected using an acquisition matrix of 96 × 96, a repetition time of 3,000 msec., an echo time of 30 msec., a flip angle of 70°, a SENSE factor of 2, and an isotropic resolution of 1.5 mm with no gap. Images were collected for a total of 10 min. per run during which subject MM was asked to focus on a black plus sign centered on a white background. A seed-style connectivity analysis was conducted using these resting-state fMRI data using SPM8. Following standard methods, volumes were slice-time corrected, realigned, normalized and smoothed. Brain anatomy was segmented into gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Using the connectivity toolbox (Whitfield-Gabrieli & Nieto-Castanon, 2012), temporal covariates were created using subject-specific white matter and CSF masks and the motion parameters obtained from motion correction. Spatial and temporal filtering was first applied to remove linear trends. Nuisance variables and their first order derivatives, including head motion, mean global signal, and ventricular and white matter mean signal, were then removed. A left hippocampus seed region of interest (ROI), in MNI coordinate space, was generated among all subjects using the WFU PickAtlas (Maldjian, Laurienti, Kraft, & Burdette, 2003). A seed-to-voxel analysis was then performed using this left hippocampus ROI as the primary seed region. This approach provides an analysis of the correlation between activity in each voxel and the mean time course in the seed region.\n\nUsing this approach, functional connectivity measures were generated and compared between subject MM and the sample of five neurologically normal age-matched male control subjects. Clusters of significant functional connectivity were defined using a voxelwise p value of 0.05 and a cluster threshold of 20 or more contiguous voxels. This very liberal criterion for significance was deemed acceptable given the exploratory nature of this case study. The analysis resulted in six areas of increased functional connectivity with the left hippocampus in subject MM compared with control subjects: the left inferior prefrontal cortex (lIpFG: t = −4.43, p < .05), the left IFC pars opercularis (lIFC: t = −3.95, p < .05), the left premotor cortex (lPMC: t = −2.7, p < .05), the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC: t = −2.45, p < .05), the left retrosplenial cingulate cortex (lRCC: t = −2.41, p < .05) and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC: t = −2.41, p < .05; see ). In addition, three areas of decreased functional connectivity with the left hippocampus seed region were observed: the left posterior entorhinal cortex (IPRC: t = 3.07, p < .05), the left perirhinal cortex (lPRC: t = 3.47, p < .05), and the right perirhinal cortex (rPRC: t = 2.86, p < .05).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn some ways, MM is similar to other subjects with HSAM (Ally et al., 2013; LePort et al., 2012, 2017; Parker et al., 2006). He has a phenomenal memory for events and dates from his personal past, but only average performance on clinical tests and laboratory tasks of new learning capacity. He does not try to memorize material or employ specific mnemonic strategies. These features make MM and other HSAM subjects different from contestants in national and international memory competitions (Maguire et al., 2003; “U.S.A. Memory Championship,” 2016; “World Memory Championship,” 2016). In addition, MM is not autistic, as he has friendships and relatively broad interests, and he does not possess synesthesia or eidetic imagery. However, MM differs from other HSAM subjects in that his extraordinary memory applies to historical events that he did not personally experience (including those long before his birth) and to general world knowledge. Most HSAM subjects have little interest in thinking about events from dates before they were born (McGaugh & LePort, 2014). Thus, the range of material for which MM has exceptional memory appears to be much broader than that of HSAM subjects previously described (see ). In addition, whereas some HSAM subjects are able to recollect vivid details of most days of their adult lives (including, e.g., weather conditions and meals eaten; Parker et al., 2006; Patihis, 2016), MM does not have this ability.\n\nTable 3\n\nAmnestic syndromeMnemonistsHSAMSubject MMEpisodic↓↓↓↑↑↑——New learningWechsler Memory Scale, Rey–OsterriethProcedural———?Facts/Semantics↓—↑↑↑Auto-biographicAMI Personal Semantics, Personal ResidencesIncidents/Episodes↓↓—↑↑↑↑↑↑AMI Autobiographical IncidentsPrior memoriesWorld Knowledge/Semantics—↑↑↑↑↑↑↑Fact Retrieval, Date SignificanceFamous People↓——↑↑↑GenericCelebrity Faces, PresidentsPublic Events/ Episodes↓—↑↑↑↑↑Oscar Test, Date Significance\n\nHow are we to understand the phenomenal recall ability of this man of otherwise just average general intellect and lower-than-average mental processing speed? It has been proposed that autobiographical memory is hierarchically organized, from personally relevant epochs, to general life events, to specific episodes (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). MM appears to mentally travel up and down these levels of memory with exceptional ease. He has very strong tendencies to (a) infuse recollections of personally experienced events with descriptions of their historical or cultural context, and (b) insert his own life events into answers to general information questions. This suggests that, for him, the boundaries between facts and episodes, and between the personally experienced and the historical, are especially fluid.\n\nIt is tempting to speculate on the relationship between MM’s mental health challenges and his extraordinary memory. In fact, many mnemonists and HSAMs suffer from depression or possess obsessional traits (if not full-blown obsessive-compulsive disorder; LePort et al., 2012; McGaugh & LePort, 2014). MM does have longstanding anxiety and depression, but he is receiving treatment and his symptoms are under reasonable control. He is perhaps preoccupied with historical and sports trivia, but he does not have true obsessions or compulsions, and his PAI profile is not indicative of any psychiatric disorder. Some investigators have raised the possibility that excessive anxiety is associated with especially strong memory consolidation, perhaps mediated by high levels of epinephrine (Burke & Mathews, 1992; Patihis, 2016). Nonetheless, any tight linkage between MM’s psychiatric condition and his memory abilities remains elusive.\n\nIn spite of our many interviews with MM, it remains unclear why he is unable to be gainfully employed. Perhaps his extremely slow processing speed is to blame. Luria’s S—who for periods of time had been a journalist, an efficiency expert and vaudeville actor—was also unable to parlay his memory talent into career success. In his case, he was so distracted by images and synesthetic experiences that he was unable to think abstractly or reason conceptually. He ultimately became a stage mnemonist, until this too became impossible, as material from his many performances blended into each other. However, the case of Professor A.C. Aitken, a brilliant mathematician and musician with a phenomenal memory—including for unrelated test stimuli he learned in the psychology lab 27 years earlier— confirms the fact that being a mnemonist does not preclude great intellectual and occupational accomplishment (Hunter, 1977). McGaugh comments that many of the HSAM subjects he has studied lead successful social and professional lives, and include several people in the entertainment industry (McGaugh & LePort, 2014).\n\nIt seems natural for neuropsychologists to look to brain structure and function for answers to questions about exceptional cognitive ability. Standard clinical evaluation of MM’s brain MRI images revealed no structural abnormalities. In addition, MM’s total brain and hippocampal subregion volumes were unremarkable. This is consistent with most of the previous literature. Although Maguire and colleagues (Chadwick, Bonnici, & Maguire, 2014) found that volume of hippocampal subregion CA3 was associated with degree of confusion about past memories in normal subjects, they also found that winners of international memory competitions had undistinguished brains on structural MRI scans (Maguire et al., 2003). However, neuroanatomical differences have often been observed between HSAM subjects and their normal-memory peers. Although the literature is far from unanimous, among the most consistently found differences have been in the uncinate fasciculus, forceps major, and parahippocampal gyrus (LePort et al., 2012). The first two of these structures are white matter tracks connecting the anterior temporal cortex with the orbital frontal cortex, and the left and right occipital cortices, respectively.\n\nCareful measurement of MM’s MTL structures revealed a larger right temporal pole and smaller right perirhinal cortex and left entorhinal cortex compared with men his age with average recall performance. Furthermore, two morphological curiosities were observed: MM’s left collateral sulcus is much deeper and wider than what is typically seen and a circular band of white matter surrounding a ring-like section of gray matter is seen on the boundary of his left perirhinal and entorhinal cortices. Although unusual, and confined to structures of the left MTL known to be important for the type of explicit memory in which MM excels, it is impossible to assign functional significance to these observations.\n\nA perhaps more direct approach to assessing a possible neural basis of MM’s exceptional memory is the use of connectivity measures derived from functional MRI. This analysis examined patterns of correlated activity across brain regions and time. We discovered nine brain areas that showed altered functional connectivity with the left hippocampus in MM when compared with control subjects. Three areas of reduced functional connectivity were observed, all within the hierarchically organized structures of the MTL. However, the six areas of increased functional connectivity extended to the premotor cortex, frontal cortex and retrosplenial cingulate cortex. Increased correlations between activity in the hippocampus and these areas may suggest greater than ordinary involvement of circuits associated with executive control and modulation of memory function. Specifically, functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal circuit has been implicated in memory integration, the process by which related memories become interconnected (Schlichting, Mumford, & Preston, 2015; Schlichting & Preston, 2015). The increased functional connectivity observed between the left hippocampus seed and the frontal cortex in subject MM could underlie his remarkable tendency to form connections between unrelated, though coincidental, personal and public events. Furthermore, PET imaging studies have revealed increased metabolism specifically of the right prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate in participants who are in the “episodic retrieval mode” (Buckner, Andrews-Hanna, & Schacter, 2008; Philippi, Tranel, Duff, & Rudrauf, 2015; Spreng & Grady, 2010). This may help explain why many previous HSAM subjects have described “uncontrollable remembering” and “thinking about the past all the time” (Parker et al., 2006; Patihis, 2016); in essence being “stuck” in an autobiographical remembering mode.\n\nOverall, our imaging findings in MM are consistent with converging evidence that hyperconnectivity among hubs in an expanded memory network, rather than significant anatomical differences, may underlie extraordinary memory abilities. This is further supported by studies in which damage to this network, which overlaps considerably with the so-called default mode network (Buckner et al., 2008; Spreng & Grady, 2010), was shown to disrupt autobiographical retrieval (Philippi et al., 2015). Of course, our findings of increased functional correlation of hippocampus with frontal and retrosplenial cortical regions must be considered highly tentative. The comparison of a single subject with a small group of control subjects greatly increases the chance of a false-positive finding, especially using unadjusted p values as in the present study. However, the areas we found to have either increased or decreased functional connectivity with the left hippocampus are all well known to play a role in memory function broadly. If the areas of altered connectivity were truly chance observations, a more random distribution of brain areas would be expected. Although the interpretation of clinically normal neuroimaging in a single case may be treacherous, it is likely that extraordinary feats of cognition, such as MM’s exceptional memory, are the result of relatively subtle variations in functional connectivity."
