I finally decided that current information is probably best posted on a month-by-month basis so for current information search this site for the name of the month you are looking for and the word “event” (for example March 2024 Laura Ingalls Wilder Events).\n\nLet me know if I’m missing any. Most of these events are annual but check with the group hosting the event for exact dates for following years. There are a few events that no longer exist.\n\nI have enough information that I want to post what I have for 2024. The events I haven’t gotten dates for yet still have 2023 dates and are italicized. I’ll update them as I get more information.\n\nCHECK BACK! for changes throughout the year. I make changes and updates on this page and not on any individualized posts.\n\nListen to our Looking Ahead Episode\n\nhttps://www.blogtalkradio.com/trundlebedtales/2024/05/05/ep-151-looking-ahead-at-laura-ingalls-wilder-fandom-2024\n\nOr find it wherever you get your podcasts under Trundlebed Tales.\n\nPepin WI\n\nLaura Ingalls Wilder’s 157th birthday is February 7, 2024.

This is a cooperative activity of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Memorial Society, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Days Committee, and the Austin Tea Party Players.\n\n50th Anniversary Cast Reunion Event – Villa Bellezza Winery and Vineyards in Pepin, WI – May 10-11, 2024, LaCrosse WI – May 12, 2024 (See more detail under cast reunion)\n\nLaura Days – September 14 & 15, 2024\n\nThis is their big Laura event of the year. Traditionally they include the most participants (including adults) who dress in prairie clothes (so wear yours!), a regional fiddle contest, and a Traditional Crafts demonstration area.\n\nHours\n\nIndependence KS\n\nThis year Prairie Days has been changed into a cast reunion event. There is more information under the reunion events section.\n\n50th Anniversary Event – Independence, KS – Prairie Days-A LHOTP Cast 50th Celebration on May 31 – June 2, 2024\n\nCarrie Ingalls Swanzey’s Birthday Party – Saturday August 3, 2024 – 1:00 pm – 5:00 pm\n\nHours\n\nOpen March 15th – November 1st, 2024 – 10:00 pm – 5:00 pm everyday.\n\n[Opening and closing dates not confirmed.]\n\nWalnut Grove MN\n\nOnline Laura Ingalls Wilder Birthday Special – February 4, 2024 – 3:00 pm –\n\nThe Walnut Grove pageant will have another online celebration of Laura’s birthday. This time focused on the actresses who played Nellie Oleson in the pageant over the years. The interviews will be live, recorded, or read. Due to time constraints, they are interviewing the Nellie actresses who had been in the Walnut Grove Laura Ingalls Wilder Pageant for 5 years or more. They would still like to hear from any Nellie actress in the form of a short bio of what you are up to now and any thoughts on acting as Nellie Oleson in our production.\n\nFind-a-Grave Presentation – April 18, 2024\n\nBonnie Caldwell will present about grave hunting.

The first in the trilogy will be closest to traditional Fragments of a Dream so they did the 2nd one last year. This year it’s the third one, Dream Fulfilled.\n\nJuly 12-13, 2024\n\nJuly 19-20, 2024 (Reunion Weekend)\n\nJuly 26-27, 2024\n\nFamily Festival held in Walnut Grove City Park on pageant Saturdays, July 12, 19, and 26, 2024. The festival goes from 11:00 am to 6:00 pm Check the Walnut Grove website for full schedule and more details as it gets closer.\n\n2024 will be the 50th Anniversary of the Little House on the Prairie TV show (NBC). Walnut Grove is the homesite that has had the most to do with the TV show and has announced they will definitely be following up their 40th and 45th reunions with one this year. They are still rolling out information. If you plan on going look for where you want to stay now because they aren’t many spaces yet.\n\n50th Anniversary Cast Reunion Event – Walnut Grove, MN – July 19-21, 2024 (Scroll up to Walnut Grove section for more information)\n\nThis is not one of the repeating productions and so will be done differently. This is Paul Valenti’s report on Facebook in January: “You DO NOT need an advance ticket to attend the reunion events being held within Walnut Grove. Autograph/Meet & Greet tickets will be available when you arrive in Walnut Grove. It is also not expected that tickets for the evening pageants will sell out, there is always more room ‘on the hill’ for that particular event. I DO expect that there will be a brunch and a dinner event held that weekend for which you WILL need an advance ticket. So all that the fans should concern themselves with right now, in regards to the Walnut Grove Reunion, is finding lodging and transportation, everything else will be announced in plenty of time for those of you who are looking to participate in the various events taking place that weekend.”\n\nThat is good advice, except I would pre-buy the pageant tickets as soon as possible to get good seats. Some people prefer to sit on a blanket on the hill though so it’s up to you. The pageant will be the play put on by the townspeople every year and a pre- pageant Q and A session with the TV show cast. You do not have to pre-buy a ticket to the Autograph/Meet & Greet sessions. They will also have a photo with the cast on Sunday. This is my playlist of videos from when I attended their event in 2014. I’ve got it cued up to video 3 which is when I made it to Walnut Grove.\n\nFriday, July 19: Bruncheon ($70)\n\nSaturday, July 20: Luncheon ($70)\n\n-Your ticket includes a meal, a photo of you & others at your table with the Star, and a Gift Bag with exclusive items.\n\n-You are only allowed to attend one of these events. You cannot attend both the bruncheon and luncheon.\n\n-Additional information will be released by April 1st. Pre-sale date and times will be announced at that time.\n\nSunday, July 21 Photo Opportunity ($25)\n\n10:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. Community Center\n\nYou will have an opportunity to get a photograph with all of the Stars attending our reunion. The Stars will be seated and staged for you to join their photo. The photos will be taken on your personal device.\n\nHere is their current page about the reunion event it’s got all the information you’ll need. Here is their regular pageant page, click Pageant at the top and it will give you more options for details.\n\nAlison Arngrim (Nellie Oleson)\n\nDean Butler (Almanzo Wilder)\n\nCharlotte Stewart (Miss Beadle)\n\nPatrick Labyorteaux (Andy Garvey)\n\nWendi Lou Lee (Grace Ingalls)\n\nSidney Greenbush (Carrie Ingalls)\n\nPamela Roylance (Sarah Carter)\n\nDavid Friedman (Jason Carter)\n\nJennifer Donati (Baby Rose Wilder)\n\nLeslie Landon (Etta Plum, also Landon’s daughter)\n\nMichael Landon, Jr. (Jim, also Landon’s son)\n\n2024 Walnut Grove Museum Hours Schedule – Republished With Permission\n\nBurr Oak IA\n\nNormally Burr Oak has a lot of smaller events throughout the year.
