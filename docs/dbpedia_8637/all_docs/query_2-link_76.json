        "text": "This ranking was originally published in 2018. It has since been updated and revised. The 2024 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony will be held in Cleveland on October 19, shown live on Disney+, and then streamed on Hulu. This year’s inductees — a slate including Cher, the Dave Matthews Band, Foreigner, Kool & the Gang, Peter Frampton, Mary J. Blige, Ozzy Osbourne, and A Tribe Called Quest — have been added below.\n\nThis year’s slate of inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame shows us again that the Founder’s Era of the institution is definitely over. That crew, led by Ahmet Ertegun, the legendary mogul, and Jann Wenner, the former publisher of Rolling Stone magazine, had many faults, including in-clubbiness, inconsistency, and blinders when it came to certain musical styles. However, the hall accepted that rock and roll was a thing apart from pop music, and for the most part tried to recognize the artists who best personified this mongrel and very much compromised genre.\n\nBut Ertegun died in 2006, and over the next ten years or so, pressure on Wenner grew. A watershed: The induction, in 2018, of Bon Jovi, a hair band no critic had ever celebrated. O ver the last half-decade, this tendency has accelerated, and now simple commercial success, even in the face of widespread critical indifference or even hostility, has taken over. (Wenner, who had already stepped back in the organization, got booted for good last year after giving what seemed to be a very stoned interview to the New York Times in which he tried to argue that celebrated white male performers were “philosophers of rock” in a way that female and black performers weren’t.)\n\nIn the last few years, an even worse tendency at the hall has manifested itself: We now seem to be in the pet rock era. Increasingly, we are seeing the induction of minor artists who might have had a time of celebrity long ago but somehow manage to pro voke twinges of affection first in the souls of the hall’s nominating committee and then the much less discriminating voting committee. (And, not incidentally, help put keisters through the turnstiles at the museum in Cleveland.) In these cases, any consideration of artistic quality, importance, or influence goes out the window. Hence Pat Benatar and Duran Duran, for example, in 2022, and Peter Frampton and others in 2024.\n\nIn both cases, the common factor is celebrity and commercial success, two things not mentioned in the hall’s original statements of intent. The music industry spends a lot of time honoring such achievements: There are best-selling charts, gold and platinum records, oodles of cheesy awards shows, TV appearances, multimillion-dollar contracts and endorsement deals, and all of the other louche means this very louche industry has at its disposal to make their lives even nicer.\n\nIdeally, there might be one place — a Hall of Fame, say — where something other than simple celebrity is recognized. In Cleveland, not so much anymore.\n\nThere’s one other important tendency that has manifested itself with vengeance this year. As I explain in detail below, when we talk about inductees to the Hall of Fame, we’re talking about a nominating committee that offers a slate of potential inductees to the key “performers” category each year. A much larger voting committee culls this group down to seven or eight. Increasingly, the former has found itself unable to get important artists through that second hurdle.\n\nIn response, the hall has taken a category devoted to supporting players and producers and turned it into an “Award for Musical Excellence” in an end run around the process. And you can frequently see lists of the inductees each year that blurs the distinction between actual inductees and the “musical excellence” people. Recently, LL Cool J and Chaka Khan got into the hall this way — and this year they are giving this “award” to Jimmy Buffett, the MC5, and Dionne Warwick. (Norman Whitfield, a Motown producer and songwriter, is in there as well, a better example of what a side category inductee should be — someone who made an indelible contribution to the music but doesn’t quite fit the performer category.) What the hall should be doing is let the nominating committee have the power to put actual important artists in, keeping the prestige of the performers category intact, and route the various subpar folks into a “commercial sensation” subcategory or something like that. Instead, I increasingly see lists of the year’s inductees that don’t break the categories down, giving off the impression that LL Cool J, say, is in the “real” hall.\n\nWhat follows is a list of all of the regular inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, listed in order from best to worst. Along the way, we’ll look at the organization’s origins and how i t has evolved, with comments from members of the selection committees past and present. (My interview with Wenner was conducted years before his comments in the Times.) The list is revised each year; changes in rankings and things like the resolution of oversights are duly noted where appropriate.\n\nThe rankings below are for the most part made on the basis of the appropriateness of each artist’s induction based on stated hall criteria, not their baseline quality or my personal fondness for the artists in question. Were the acts influential? Were they the first? Are they simply brilliant at whatever it is they do? (There are a few bands I personally like a lot on the bottom half of the list.) I know there aren’t enough women; more on that anon.\n\nIndividual inductees with previous careers in bands (Lou Reed, Paul McCartney, etc.) are ranked on the basis of their solo work alone. That’s why Stevie Nicks, for example, is ranked where she is; her solo career — i.e., aside from her work in Fleetwood Mac, which was great and for which she’s already in the hall — is marginal. There are also some categories, for important country or blues progenitors, or for people like Dick Clark; I have not included those in this list. Let me know of any mistakes or grievous errors of opinion in the comments or at Bluesky at @hitsville.bsky.social.\n\nFinally, let’s acknowledge that the nominating committee does have a difficult task. The hall execs I spoke to all made this point: Every music fan has his or her opinion when it comes to what makes a great or important artist. It’s all based on several sliding scales of relative worth, or even interest. Perhaps you weren’t the best at something … but you were the first. Maybe you weren’t about songs, per se, but a sound. Some bands sold no records and were highly influential; others sold so many — and play the PR game in general and suck up to hall folks in particular so well — that they get inducted even though they are highly derivative and blandly attitudinal, don’t write their own songs, base their act almost entirely on the lead singer’s hair, and have not a thing to say.\n\nBut enough about Bon Jovi. Let’s go to the inductees!\n\n1. Chuck Berry (1986)\n\nHe is one of the three or four people who laid out one of the original pieces of the rock puzzle. He decisively introduced real lyric writing to pop music. And he first articulated rock’s sense of itself, creating a foundation for the music — tied to a better world and the promise of America — that even rock and roll’s bleakest moments tacitly acknowledge. As a person, he was less than ideal. But still: One of the most consequential American cultural figures of the 20th century.\n\nAs we go through the list, I’ll fill you in one some of the details of the hall’s founding and how it works. In the beginning, long before the plans for an actual rock museum in Cleveland were hatched, a group headed by Rolling Stone’s Jann Wenner and Atlantic Records’ Ahmet Ertegun started off the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with two induction ceremonies-cum-concerts, in 1986 and 1987, bringing in a total of 25 blues-and-rock groundbreakers primarily from the ‘50s, including Berry, Little Richard, Elvis Presley, and so forth.\n\n2. The Beatles — George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr (1988)\n\nA joyous sound that turned ever inward, leading the way for just about everyone who followed — and, with Elvis, the epitome of pop stardom.\n\nThe third hall of fame induction numbered only five acts and included ‘60s stars like the Beatles, Dylan, the Beach Boys, the Supremes, and the Drifters. (The Stones didn’t get in until the following year.)\n\n3. Bob Dylan (1988)\n\nDylan took rock lyrics to places they hadn’t been before and haven’t been since. He remains not just the nonpareil avatar of pure artistry with all its peevish, unadulterated glory — and missteps, stumbles, stubbornness, and exasperations — but also the ideal of the artist for whom those missteps, stumbles, stubbornness and exasperations are part of the point. Blood on the Tracks is the best rock album ever made. Not even the Beatles can compete with the sheer quantity of his essential songs.\n\n4. Elvis Presley (1986)\n\nHe is rock’s greatest personal presence, shaking a country with a single-handed nuclear fusion of country, gospel, and the blues. Limited only by not having been a songwriter and, whatever his psychic vitality, lacking something — something, perhaps, in his soul, but perhaps just the brains — to run his life, much less career, effectively.\n\n5. James Brown (1986)\n\nComing from one of the music’s bleakest backgrounds, he was a coiled figure of impenetrable gravity. He invented funk, and performed with a blistering focus that had never been seen before and never would again.\n\nBack to our story: But Wenner and Ertegun weren’t the ones who came up with the idea for the hall originally. In Sticky Fingers, his recent delectably dirt-filled biography of Wenner, Joe Hagan says the hall of fame was first conceived by a cable entrepreneur, Bruce Brandwen, who outlined the basic structure of the hall, proposed an annual TV show, and enlisted Ertegun.\n\nErtegun, if you don’t know, at his romanticized best was the epitome of rock cool, and very rich. Beginning in the 1940s, his label, Atlantic, recorded Ray Charles, the Coasters, the Drifters, Joe Turner, and Ruth Brown; and in the ‘60s everyone from Aretha to Cream. Ertegun later signed the Stones, Led Zeppelin, and CSN, and in the ‘80s Atlantic still had hits with everyone from AC/DC to INXS to Debbie Gibson. Ertegun moved through these decades like the son of the Turkish diplomat he was; he lived, as Hagan notes in his book, at a sex-and-drugs-and-rock-and-roll-drenched apogee of suavity, wealth, and power. (Robert Greenfield’s oral history on Ertegun’s life is titled The Last Sultan.) A certain rock-magazine publisher was looking on with interest.\n\n6. Prince (2004)\n\nPrince has to come after Brown, but it should be noticed that he could do virtually everything Brown did — and also wrote cosmic songs, and also played guitar just about as well as anyone on this list, and also sang like both an angel and devil, and also was a venturesome and sure-footed rock, pop, and soul producer and songwriter. Prince kidnapped rock’s pretensions to perversion, skinned them and fashioned them into a frock coat he pulled out on special occasions or just because. “Mick Jagger,” Robert Christgau once wrote, “should just fold up his penis and go home.” At the induction, Prince said, soberly, “Too much freedom can lead to the soul’s decay.” He died, shockingly, in 2016.\n\n7. Ramones — Dee Dee Ramone, Joey Ramone, Johnny Ramone, Marky Ramone, and Tommy Ramone (2002)\n\nAmong other things, these guys were rock critics — meaning that they thought the rock of the day sucked. They thought a good song should be fast, ironic, witty, ideally evocative of the girl-group sound, and have the vocals mixed way up high. And one more thing: You didn’t have to know how to play your instrument to be in a rock-and-roll band. The Ramones showed us that every once in a while rock needed to be rebuilt from scratch. And — not passing judgment either way, just making the observation — they pretty much removed the blues from a strain of rock. Johnny gave George Bush a shout-out at the induction. Now that’s punk rock.\n\n8. Nirvana — Kurt Cobain, Dave Grohl, and Krist Novoselic (2014)\n\nWith the Sex Pistols the most influential and consequential band since the 1960s; with Public Enemy the most powerful and uncompromising ditto. Leader Kurt Cobain is as iconic a figure as rock has produced, painfully and tragically seeking honesty and authenticity — and, to hear him tell it, fruitlessly. Finally convincing himself that he didn’t have a future, he committed suicide in 1994. The psychological honesty of Cobain’s songs were groundbreaking; sonically, they blew a hole in the radio and wrenched the entire recording industry sideways, roiling radio playlists, MTV and, as a consequence, the sales charts, making the 1990s a colorful and unexpectedly venturesome musical decade.\n\n9. Buddy Holly (1986)\n\nA gentle soul who died far too soon. His lyrics were nowhere near Berry’s, but there was a power and logic undergirding his songs that everyone from the Beatles to Springsteen recognized and would build on. Look at film of his band and you notice something else that is elemental, at this point nearly archetypal: four figures — two guitars, bass, and drums — playing the singer’s songs, a picture of a rock band that would stand for half a century. And his evolving growth makes his heartbreakingly early death (at 21!) hard to think about. (He, Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, and Cobain are rock’s greatest tragedies.)\n\nSome people these days don’t know much about Jann Wenner. He started Rolling Stone in 1967; within a few years, it had placed itself at the center of the counterculture. Much to Wenner’s credit, in fits and starts he gave critics a lot of freedom and he paid writers to do expansive, sometimes daring reporting. The magazine became a significant cultural force and one of a small handful of the most celebrated publications of the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThat’s what we saw on the outside. The inside, as Hagan tells it, was less pretty. Sticky Fingers, the Wenner bio, is a damning tale of a striver of almost infantile ambition who, while he did encourage (and pay for) reams of honest journalism, had so many moral screws loose that he left decades of wounded and bitter friends, employees, and artists in his wake. For example: Rolling Stone has so heavily identified itself with John Lennon over the years it’s surprising to read that Lennon was so pissed off by an early Wenner betrayal that he never spoke to him again after a 1970 interview; after Lennon’s death, Yoko Ono somewhat cynically let the grudge slide to keep Lennon’s Rolling Stone stock high. And stories abound of Wenner letting his rock- and movie-star buddies vet their profiles. The magazine went through several financial crises in the 1970s, but during the booms of the ‘80s and ‘90s it started throwing off profits in the seven and eight figures. With that money and the mechanisms of his magazine’s PR power, Wenner was, after decades of peering in from the outside, finally able to definitively insinuate himself into the world of rock-star (and soon movie-star) hyperprivilege.\n\n10. Muddy Waters (1987)\n\nWaters is probably the greatest of the Chess Records stable, and indeed, all urban blues artists, and was an avatar for early rockers like Chuck Berry. His authorship of a song called “Rollin’ Stone,” stinging guitar work, and molten presence looms over all of rock. Waters’s labelmates Howlin’ Wolf and Willie Dixon, a key songwriter and producer at Chess Records, are in the hall in an “Influencers” category. Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a sensational performer, was inducted in 2018 in this category.\n\n11. Otis Redding (1989)\n\nRock’s greatest balladeer and one of its greatest rockers; the first four seconds of his debut commercial recording, “These Arms of Mine,” are among the most beautiful things ever produced by man. His emotional dynamic range is unmatched. One of his albums is entitled Complete and Unbelievable: The Otis Redding Dictionary of Soul MY-MY-MY, which pretty much sums it all up. He died in a plane crash in 1967.\n\n12. Little Richard (1986)\n\nSqueals of lust and desire, a recklessly extravagant piano attack, and a devilish energy were what Richard brought to rock and roll. He was one of the chief architects of the music. He was capable of more routine blues, and even calm songs. But at his best, he was a personification of priapism and kink on a scale that made all who came after, even Prince, mere pretenders. (His band, Richard would recall fondly, had an orgy after every show.) But in 1959, saying he’d made a million dollars on the devil’s music, he said he was going to “make peace with Jesus.” He quit the business, and while there were many backslides and comebacks, he was never an artistic force again.\n\n13. The Rolling Stones — Mick Jagger, Brian Jones, Keith Richards, Ian Stewart, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Ronnie Wood, and Bill Wyman (1989)\n\nWith the Yardbirds, the most deliberately blues-based early rockers, who in their classic period (until 1972) never went too far from the blues’ recognizable core. And yet the dense maelstrom slabbed beneath the rhythms of their best late-’60s material were experiments in sound, but always grounded by a strong rhythm section, quite a rhythm guitarist, and a singer who was both a hedonist and an intellectual. Their Beggar’s to Exile run is probably unmatched by any other band. (I had the Stones originally two steps lower, below Zeppelin and the Pistols, just to make the point that all three were radical and influential in their own way, but I think it’s fair to put them first.)\n\nOver the years, there have been any number of peculiarities in the hall’s inductions. Notice anything odd about the Stones’ lineup listed above? Ian Stewart was the group’s original keyboardist, but was removed from the official lineup because his image didn’t fit with the rest of the Stones’. He played on their records and became their road manager. It’s a good example of an issue that has bedeviled the hall from the start: What members of a long-running band should be included? I’m as big a Stones fan as anyone (and no relation to the bassist), and I like the idea of the hall including folks from behind the scenes. But it’s hard for me to discern where keyboards were anything other than an incidental part of the band’s sound in the 1960s — and in the 1970s, the best keyboard parts (“Time Waits for No One,” “Memory Motel”) were played by others. Many other nonofficial band members much more important to a particular artist’s sound or success — Bernie Taupin, say, to Elton John, or the Bomb Squad to Public Enemy — have gone unnoticed by the hall. It’s why the hall has been accused of bowing to outside pressures. I don’t think anyone on the nominating committee was saying, “Well, we simply have to include Ian Stewart!” It seems obvious to me that the Stones insisted on it and the hall didn’t have the wherewithal to say no; this all happened in the third year of inductions, setting off an unfortunate precedent.\n\n14. Led Zeppelin — John Bonham, John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant (1995)\n\nZeppelin were a decisive turning point in rock, in which the blues were beaten into submission by a larger-than-life guitarist and his sidekick singer, a Viking. They unapologetically purveyed the heaviest of heavy metal. They eschewed the single, forcing fans to buy their albums or see them live. Producer Page’s venturesome techniques mastered rock, the blues, and psychedelia; he’s one of a small handful of the music’s most influential producers. Nothing too profound in the songs, but on balance they probably have the least embarrassing lyrics of any hard-rock band.\n\nBack to our story: In Hagan’s reporting, Ertegun and Wenner conspired together to wait out the five-year contract Brandwen had, and then took the organization over. Wenner later dismissed Brandwen as part of “a bunch of hucksters.” The inevitable lawsuit was settled out of court. Bruce Conforth, the hall’s first curator, told me that an early benefit concert featuring the Who and billed as a benefit for the hall actually raised money to pay off that settlement. I asked Jann Wenner if that was the case. “No, we didn’t allocate that money to that purpose. The funds went to our general account. The money that went to [Brandwen & Co.] wasn’t from any source. It would be incorrect to say it was used directly for that settlement.” How much was the settlement? “Honestly, I don’t remember,” Wenner replied. “It was not big. My guess would be in the one or two hundred thousand range.”\n\n15. Sex Pistols — Paul Cook, Steve Jones, Glen Matlock, John Lydon, and Sid Vicious (2006)\n\nThe band released one studio album and played a total of eight American shows in a single disaster of a tour. And yet even today, 40 years later, their record feels as harsh and uncompromising as it did originally. Their punk derision could easily accept the money-minting reunion tour, but not even Johnny Rotten’s boundless cynicism would let the band appear before the ruling poltroons of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Upped five notches because they remain the one band that has refused to dignify their induction with anything more than a raspberry. Must read: Rotten’s fax to the hall, so contemptuous as to not even include punctuation. (“Were not coming.“)\n\n16. Ike & Tina Turner (1991)\n\nTina Turner was called “the female Mick Jagger” until someone got it right: Jagger was the male Tina Turner. She is the preeminent blues-rock singer. Most people have heard about Ike Turner because of his monstrous treatment of his wife and others. Rock scholars argue that his “Rocket 88,” recorded at Sun Studios and released on Chess in 1951, may be the first true rock-and-roll record. Turner was 20 at the time. And with James Brown and the Stones, they may be the music’s greatest live act. All you need to know about this outfit is right here.\n\n17. The Clash — Terry Chimes, Topper Headon, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon, and Joe Strummer (2003)\n\nThey stood up, as Whitman did, for the stupid and crazy. Building on the promise of the Ramones and the ferocity of the Pistols, the Clash brought a high intelligence, a rigid but for the most part warmhearted politics, and songs songs songs (to be specific: as many great songs as the Rolling Stones) in a tumultuous, too-short career. The plan, originally, was to tear down everything that came before and build a better world. Then Mick Jones decided he was a rock star.\n\n18. Bo Diddley (1987)\n\nDiddley was a big man with a gigantic sound — tribal, insistent, but somehow always good-natured — in some ways unequaled to this day. He was a comedian, too (“Say Man,” “Say Man, Back Again”) and pulled off all manner of other songs as well. I put Diddley above people like Jerry Lee because without his crazy breadth and humor married to his primal, juggernaut of a beat, rock would not be what it is today.\n\n19. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five — Melvin “Melle Mel” Glover, Nathaniel “The Kidd Creole” Glover Jr., Eddie “Scorpio” Morris, Joseph “Grandmaster Flash” Saddler, Robert Keith “Keef Cowboy” Wiggins, and Guy Todd “Rahiem” Williams (2007)\n\nAmid groundbreaking production and musical coups (courtesy of Flash) and a cyclone of verbiage (courtesy of Mel) these guys helped create something new under the sun, as iconoclastic as Bo Diddley, as engaging as Fats Domino, and yet darker than the Stones or Marvin Gaye at his most political, laying down elements that, like the Beatles, opened doors of possibility that would influence decades of innovators to come and, like the Ramones, finding a new primal bottom for the music to build on once again.\n\nOver the years, there have been many rumors about behind-the-scenes fiddling with votes at the hall. One oft-repeated tale involving Grandmaster Flash was originally reported by Roger Friedman, at the time a fairly well-sourced Hollywood online columnist for Fox News. He said that Wenner had disregarded some late-arriving votes for the Dave Clark Five in order to insure that the hall finally inducted a hip-hop artist. I asked Joel Peresman, who as CEO of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation is the organization’s top exec, whether it was true. “What Roger Friedman says and what the truth is are genuinely two different things,” Peresman said sharply. I asked Wenner about it as well. “Bullshit,” he said. “That’s the last thing I would do.” I recently spoke to a longtime industry insider who flatly said he saw one bit of chicanery: He was there as the nominating committee concluded its discussions and read out that year’s nominees — but when the actual nominations list was sent out, it included an extra name of a multiplatinum band, which then was duly voted into the hall.\n\n20. Aretha Franklin (1987)\n\nA singer whose artistry transcends the music. The voice she was born with could pierce glass, and her own technique embellished everything she recorded. A lot of her work isn’t that interesting, but when Ertegun and Atlantic super-producer Jerry Wexler put her together with the right musicians and songs, magic resulted.\n\n21. David Bowie (1996)\n\nRock’s high priest of archness and the polymophously perverse, our first great art-rock star, creating pop (“Changes”) and rock (“Ziggy Stardust”) ineffability from a highly detached but ever-curious perch.\n\nThe hall gets attacked on a lot of fronts — there’s not enough women, etc., etc. One of the more glaring, and curious, is its wariness of the effete and glam side of rock. Being nominated in your first year of eligibility is a big deal with the hall, and we’ve recently seen acts like the Foo Fighters and Biggie swept right in. Bowie had to wait four years, and wasn’t even nominated (!) in two of those years. Other glammy artists like Roxy Music, T. Rex, and Todd Rundgren waited much longer, and acts like the New York Dolls and Mott the Hoople are still on the outside, while just about every hirsute assemblage of spandexed wankers with cucumbers pushed down the front of their jeans from the interim decades have been ushered right in. It’s obvious that the hall has a tacit discomfort with stars who don’t inhabit traditional male rock-star roles — and male stars who sleep with men, too. (Lou Reed didn’t get into the hall until 2015, nearly 20 years after his eligibility.) I didn’t go deep into this with Wenner. (After years of relationships with both sexes, Wenner came out in middle age.) But I did ask him if there was discomfort with this side of rock on the part of the hall. “I don’t believe so,” he replied. “It’s never occurred to me.”\n\n22. The Jimi Hendrix Experience — Jimi Hendrix, Mitch Mitchell, and Noel Redding (1992)\n\nHendrix’s guitar excursions were of course never matched. His early death makes for one of rock’s saddest stories, and was probably the single coolest person in the history of the music. Forgive me a short digression on exactly how collected Hendrix was. In an unforgettable scene from ’Scuse Me While I Kiss the Sky, David Henderson’s intimate Hendrix bio, we find Hendrix with Marianne Faithfull, then Mick Jagger’s girlfriend, at a club. Hendrix is carefully explaining to her why she shouldn’t be going out with Jagger — he was, as Hendrix put it, “a cunt” — while Jagger was sitting at the table with them.\n\nNote that the inductee here is not Hendrix but his band. Another hall pressure point is what to do with stars like Janis Joplin, Hendrix, Tom Petty, or Bob Seger, who did some or all of their most important work with a particular backing band. Why are Petty’s Heartbreakers in the hall but not Seger’s Silver Bullet Band? It makes no sense. The decision to include the players in Hendrix’s power trio is a puzzle too. Mitchell and Redding did their job well, but that job was just to provide a showcase for Hendrix’s work and … neither did anything of note after the Experience.\n\n23. Joni Mitchell (1997)\n\nShe made her career with a pop song prettier (and probably more meaningful) than “Blowin’ in the Wind” — “Both Sides Now” — and then through the 1970s created album after album of wrenchingly rigorous lyrics and music. The 1980s were awkward, after which she headed out into a jazz odyssey understood only to her. She remains one of the music’s most austere and uncompromising artistic presences. She backed out of the ceremony, apparently at the last minute, after being newly reunited with a daughter she had given up for adoption before she’d become a star.\n\n24. Elvis Costello & the Attractions — Elvis Costello, Steve Nieve, Bruce Thomas, and Pete Thomas (2003)\n\nYou have to remember he was originally the angriest of angry young men, his name a pointed deflation of a sacred rock icon. Under the anger were exceptional melodies and rhythms, and a lyricist who was a lover of words with some scores to settle, sometimes with the mass media and the military-industrial complex but more often with women. He had huge ambition and ways of looking at love and society rock hadn’t seen before. At a time when punk had roiled the music’s reigning intelligentsia — could these bands really be as good as the Stones?!?! — he was plainly, as has been said ad nauseam and yet still irrefutably, the music’s best songwriter since Dylan. He is now a rock elder, not exactly pompous but a little overeager to share his (intelligent but numerous and sometimes tedious) thoughts about anything. His critical corner is so polite it doesn’t mention he hasn’t recorded a great song since 1986 or so.\n\n25. Marvin Gaye (1987)\n\nHe was a solid Motown star in the 1960s, offering hit after hit with Tammi Terrell and others and delivering a worldwide smash with his version of “Heard It Through the Grapevine.” Pained and unleashed, he began to soar, finding Brian Wilson–level beauty in his funereal political songs and ever-more-carnal excursions. His angelic whispers and distracted murmurs are now indelible parts of the music; the somewhat overlooked Here My Dear is one of the great pop-soul breakup albums. He was shot by his father in a family fight in 1984.\n\n26. Run-DMC — Darryl “D.M.C.” McDaniels, Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell, and Joseph “Rev Run” Simmons (2009)\n\nThis was a transformative band, upending hip-hop by refocusing its world back to the street in its most quotidian meaning in both lyrics and fashion. The guitars on “Rock Box” were very tough, but in a weirdly Elton John–ish way, Run-DMC were ingratiating and not really threatening, yet never so craven as to undermine the integrity of their art. And so, serious and not serious, they defined an early, genial hip-hop that broke barriers cultural and racial and musical in America and around the world. And while I didn’t need the Adidas commercial, I did need “King of Rock,” a preposterous boast on paper that, on record, remains one of the most thrilling moments of recognition in rock-and-roll history. It was a different time, back in the 1980s: People forget that Newsweek put the harmless pothead Tone Loc on its cover under the headline “RAP RAGE.” In fact, rappers weren’t angry. Yet.\n\n27. Sly and the Family Stone — Greg Errico, Larry Graham, Jerry Martini, Cynthia Robinson, Freddie Stone, Rose Stone, and Sly Stone (1993)\n\nAn utterly sensational rock-pop-funk ensemble under the visionary, spangled leadership of Stone. Perhaps too attuned to the times, the rhythms and music got darker, culminating in the flattened funk of There’s a Riot Goin’ On, a groundbreaking hypnotic meditation on the American (not just African-American) condition.\n\n28. Stevie Wonder (1989)\n\nHis simplest songs still resonate; his productions and arrangements radiate a kaleidoscope of sounds yet somehow make up a consistent picture of an artist, befitting one of the first people to write, perform, and produce his own records. He’s not a philosopher. But his songs in some way blanket the 1970s, more varied and more sophisticated in their expansive humanism and tasteful musicality than anyone else’s.\n\n29. Van Morrison (1993)\n\nA mystic and unsatisfied explorer with a voice capable of great power and nuance. Before he was 25 he had given us one of the era’s most primal rock excursions (“Gloria”) and one of pop radio’s blithest and most indelible songs (“Brown Eyed Girl”). He then created an immortal song cycle of elusive dreamscapes (Astral Weeks) and then a definitive piece of rock-pop-jazz (Moondance). And yet he was still unhappy and by every indication remains unhappy today. His wild sound and unapologetic mysticism would heavily influence folks like Springsteen and Patti Smith. Like Neil Young and Stevie Wonder, he had a very good ‘70s, and since then has followed a by turns romantic and dyspeptic muse — and refused to show up for the induction. In the decades since he has grown increasingly ill-tempered. During the pandemic this evolved into a sad toxicity. His antivax rants and conspiracy theories have permanently damaged his reputation. (See also: Clapton, E.)\n\n30. Public Enemy — Flavor Flav, Professor Griff, Terminator X, and Chuck D (2013)\n\nOne time at a PE concert I heard Flavor Flav say this: “I stand behind Chuck D. 100 percent. The brother be right a lot of the time.” Nothing captures this group better. The most visionary hip-hop band of all time married groundbreaking collagist sonic schemas, courtesy of the production team known as the Bomb Squad, with the words of Chuck D, who could ultimately have been the music’s greatest lyricist after Dylan. But negotiating the thresher of stardom is difficult, and he couldn’t handle the controversy over anti-Semitic remarks by the idiot Griff, which threw the band into a tailspin and undermined Chuck’s moral authority. Which he then compounded by ruining what could have been his greatest song, “Welcome to the Terrordome,” by including some tendentious attacks of his own at Jews. (Uh, Chuck, it wasn’t just the “so-called Chosen” who were “frozen” at Griff’s remarks.) Note the words “could have been,” again. Anyway, I love PE but I think the music and history has passed them by.\n\n“The hall’s notion of rock is very expansive,” one voter told me. “They’ve been very receptive to being open to hip-hop acts even during their first years of eligibility.” That’s not not-true, but it’s not entirely right either. Its view of the music is plainly superficial and leans to the pop-commercial side. I’m not sure why Eric B & Rakim, at the very least, weren’t brought in years ago; the hall falls all over itself to slide Biggie in on his first year of eligibility, while overlooking the early hip-hop artists who made him possible.\n\nHip-hop is of course not just rappers. There has also been far too little recognition of the folks who originally constructed its sonic force. Afrika Bambaataa — who I would argue stands with Lonnie Donegan (more on him later) as the most influential person in pop-music history not in the hall — was nominated back in 2008 but didn’t get past the voting committee. He has since been forgotten. (Hard to see this changing, though; Bambaataa’s reputation is now permanently tarnished after multiple sexual assault allegations from young men.)\n\nAnd then there’s the issue of hip-hop producers. P.E.’s Bomb Squad is long overdue for induction just on artistic grounds. The hall side category dubbed the Ahmet Ertegun Award, which recognizes industry folks and producers, has been awarded only once to a figure from the rap world: Sylvia Robinson, of Sugarhill Records. Sad!\n\nRobinson had a remarkable career, but that’s still pretty shabby handling of music that’s been around now for a half-century. Russell Simmons is the most obvious candidate; given the multiple rape and assault allegations against him as well this seems unlikely, but remember this is the organization that welcomed Phil Spector back to the nominating committee even after he’d shot a woman in the face, so stay tuned. DJ Premier, of Gang Starr, might be a good choice. It’s now been 30 years since the release of The Chronic, one of a handful of the most influential releases in rock history; in what universe are, say, the Foo Fighters more influential than Dr. Dre? The hall should really recognize some of the African-American producers who built the sound before inevitably turning its attention to Rick Rubin.\n\n31. Jerry Lee Lewis (1986)\n\nHellfire was the title of Nick Tosches’s Lewis biography, and hellfire seemed always to be burning at his feet. Demonic piano boogie and declaimed words (“whole lotta shakin’ goin’ on” etc. etc.) created a carnal maelstrom. Lewis was precocious in both the positive and negative sense even by the standards of rock’s early geniuses. Consider that he was thrown out of church as a teen for turning spirituals into boogie woogie — and that, when it came out that, at the age of 21, he’d married his 13-year-old cousin, he was on his third wife. Lewis, the last of the top-tier ‘50s rock-and-roll innovators, died this year.\n\n32. Parliament-Funkadelic — Jerome “Bigfoot” Brailey, George Clinton, William “Bootsy” Collins, Raymond Davis, Tiki Fullwood, Glenn Lamont Goins, Michael “Kidd Funkadelic” Hampton, Clarence “Fuzzy” Haskins, Eddie Hazel, Walter “Junie” Morrison, Cardell Mosson, William “Billy Bass” Nelson, Garry M. Shider, Calvin “Thang” Simon, Gene Grady Thomas, and Bernie Worrell (1997)\n\nIn a genre of music that was created and often defined by sui generis oddballs, this group was led by the sui generis-est oddball of them all, astral traveler and funk paragon George Clinton; the result was James Brown crossed with Frank Zappa crossed with a three-ring circus, disguising some pretty heavy themes down below. Clinton was an underrated producer — his tracks teem with sonic inventiveness, humor, and hooks. For the record, he didn’t create that many actual great songs; and his star would be brighter today if he hadn’t ruined his rep by becoming a highly unreliable live performer. But a great presence. At the band’s induction, incidentally, the P-Funk crew, more than any other outfit, took the time to give kind shout-outs to their many other fellow players over the years.\n\n33. Bob Marley (1994)\n\nHe lived a life unrecognizable to most rockers, and got shot by real criminals, not millionaire Scarface wannabes sending out posses. His music changed the world, and brought international recognition to a poor little island no one outside of it cared about. “Redemption Song” is as good a composition as “Imagine”; he is one of the music’s greatest singers and most visionary bandleaders; and just about every track he recorded in his classic period is worth hearing. Marley died of cancer in 1981.\n\nI’ve mentioned the nominating committee a couple of times. How does the hall’s voting process work? As the hall was set up, Wenner and Ertegun and a bunch of other record-industry guys (they were virtually all men) got together once a year to vote on a slate of nominees. (Artists become eligible 25 years after their first record release; it’s a hall “thing” that the perceived value of the nomination goes down as the years pass.) Anyway, these nominees would then be sent out to a larger pool of voters — the “voting committee” — who would vote on their favorites. The top five to seven vote-getters get inducted.\n\nTraditionally, the nominating committee meets in a Rolling Stone conference room, generally in September. Over lunch, each nominating member gets to make the case for two potential inductees. Joel Peresman was a longtime industry veteran who spent many years running Madison Square Garden’s concerts arm before joining the Hall of Fame Foundation ten years ago. He spent some time on the phone with me to describe the process, and not without enthusiasm: “They need to be an advocate,” he said. “They need to create a story to sell to the others in the room.” The group votes, and a short list is created. This can be ten to twenty names. This is sent out to the much-larger voting committee, a somewhat amorphous group of journalists and industry weasels along with all of the previous hall of fame inductees up to that point. (More on the implications of that later.)\n\nThis group gets a ballot in the mail, complete with a self-addressed, stamped envelope, to put his or her five proposed inductees. These are sent back to the hall. Peresman says the foundation will call voters who filled their ballots out incorrectly, and make some calls to bring in late ballots, too. There’s no official formal published list of the nominating committee by the hall, incidentally; my source for a lot of the factual details in this story is a website called futurerocklegends.com, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame–obsessed website, overseen with scrupulous fairness and attention to detail by Neil Walls. A lot of the data on the hall in this article I have taken from him, either from the site or a recent phone chat we had.\n\n34. Pink Floyd — Syd Barrett, David Gilmour, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright (1996)\n\nInventing progressive rock was a dumb idea, but it was their dumb idea. Their improbable journey included penny-loafer cut-rate psychedelia to the sonic ‘70s landmarks that fuel their legend to this day, and talent so irrepressible they had some of the most unusual hit singles of the era.\n\n35. Neil Young (1995)\n\nA rock-and-roll seeker dogged by mental demons — and a goofy avatar of rock authenticity. He created organic psychedelia out of country rock with his first big band (“Broken Arrow”) and then went off on his own, probably crafting more great albums in the 1970s than anyone else save perhaps Marley, and then oscillating freely, wildly, sometimes erratically, in the (many) years since. He mastered the high art of creating rock songs that, while often slightly impenetrable on paper, often conveyed deep meanings on records (“After the Gold Rush,” “Cinnamon Girl”); unlike all but a very few artists, he created his best work more than ten years into his career, with a trio of uniquely powerful albums — Tonight’s the Night, On the Beach, Zuma — and then, after a break and just to make his magisterial command of the music clear, Rust Never Sleeps; at which point he stood as the greatest, most defiant, and unbowed of all the 1960s survivors. No one can gainsay Young’s erratic muse, his guitar playing (as primal as a Clyfford Still painting), his keening voice, highly moving even into the 21st century. His work since has been absurdly overrated by critics (he won the Pazz & Jop poll in 1988), but for decades more he has stomped like a stallion on stages around the world, and his inherent distrust of cant, fakeness, and inauthenticity remains a force in some parts of the music world, as with, for example, Jack White. Long may he run.\n\n36. Fats Domino (1986)\n\nAnother of the disparate folks who invented rock and roll in different ways, with different styles, and in different places; Domino, in partnership with songwriter and producer Dave Bartholomew, produced (very big) hits from the early ‘50s, creating a magnanimous, inoffensive, and hugely enjoyable form of rolling, expansive pop; deeply ethnic, but so open-hearted as to include the world in its infectiousness and enthusiasm. The world liked it back. Of the great ‘50s rock stars, only Elvis Presley did better on the pop charts.\n\n37. The Velvet Underground — John Cale, Sterling Morrison, Lou Reed, and Maureen Tucker (1996)\n\nThe idea, the legend, of the Velvets is probably better than their actual output. They were pretentious and quite often unlistenable. But the force of Lou Reed’s deep, deep songs and Cale’s environment of sound and cacophony were something not yet dreamt of in rock’s philosophy. Nor was the band’s studied disregard for popularity, at least initially.\n\n38. The Band — Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel, and Robbie Robertson (1994)\n\nA group of instrumental misfits, all but one from Canada, who came together as the Hawks under Ronnie Hawkins and then were propelled to an unexpected fame due to the songwriting beauty of Robbie Robertson and then a stint as the backing band for one … [shuffles papers] B. Dylan. Robertson got some bad press after he went Hollywood after The Last Waltz, but let’s remember those songs, from the hardy mysticism of “The Weight” to “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,” a sympathetic tale told from the wrong side of the Civil War. He was an unflappable performer, able to hold his own onstage with Dylan or Clapton — and did I mention he wrote “The Weight”? The Band don’t have all that great of a recorded career after the first album or two, but their initial record provided the rock establishment with almost a reverse shock of recognition: “Oh yeah: This is what the music, at least partly, is about.” Stories abound of folks like Clapton and Van Morrison making pilgrimages to Woodstock just to play with these guys. At the induction ceremony, Hudson took the microphone and spoke for ten minutes, reciting the names of an almost unending string of people he apparently felt the need to thank.\n\n39. Smokey Robinson (1987)\n\nA lovely voice, a striking songwriter, and an indelible influence on pop, rock, and soul. Motown’s secret weapon; his good taste and stylistic elegance reverberates in pop music to this day. If you’ve never watched a hall induction ceremony, each new member is “inducted” by some famous person. Robinson was inducted by Hall & Oates, artistically slight but big stars at the time. This is a hall pattern. Contemporary stars who lend their luster to the hall early on get inducted a bit too easily themselves years later.\n\n40. The Kinks — Mick Avory, Dave Davies, Ray Davies, and Pete Quaife (1990)\n\nA highly creditable British Invasion band which, among other things, can lay claim to establishing the power chord (“All Day and All of the Night,” “You Really Got Me”), taken into the pantheon by the both acidic and whimsical writerly fancies of Ray Davies (“Waterloo Sunset,” “The Village Green Preservation Society”). All that said, the highly prolific Ray has definitely thrown more inferior product out to fans than any of his contemporaries. And no band has had worse album covers, period. The Kinks’ story overall is not a happy one. Davies has a history of mental problems; his leadership was toxic, and various Kinks were known to have tried to kill one another (literally.) Besides all that, at a certain point Davies’s art became a bit, ah, broad, let’s say; but for the record through the 1970s (Misfits) and into the ‘80s (“Come Dancing”), the Kinks produced at least occasionally substantive records — and hits.\n\n41. Roxy Music — Brian Eno, Bryan Ferry, John Gustafson, Eddie Jobson, Andy Mackay, Phil Manzanera, Graham Simpson, Paul Thompson (2019)\n\nGiven that they’d been eligible for 20 years plus, this was the most glaring omission in the hall’s history. Roxy was one of the most challenging bands of its time, mixing glam, art rock, and some species of highly emotional European chanteuserie (courtesy of leader Bryan Ferry) that, back in the day, could reduce impressionable teens to tears, though I’m not mentioning any names [coughmycollegeroommatedavecough]. Through this the band layered postmodern rock imagery; a decayed, regretful sexuality; and venturesome soundscapes (courtesy of founding member Brian Eno). Brassy early releases gave way to several art-rock classics (Country Life, Stranded) and then shifted around the time of Manifesto into haute global pop, in Flesh and Blood and Avalon, that arguably has never been equaled. You can hear Roxy’s influence throughout punk, New Wave, post-punk, the New Romantic Era, and beyond.\n\nRoxy is on a pedestal with Bowie in the U.K.; the hall clearly doesn’t have ears for this sort of stuff. It’s also evidence of how unquestionably Amer-centric the nominating committee is. Publicist Bob Merlis, who was on the nominating committee for many years, argued for Johnny Hallyday, a rock star whose popularity in France has really no equivalent in the Western world.\n\n42. The Stooges — Dave Alexander, Ron Asheton, Scott Asheton, Iggy Pop, and James Williamson (2010)\n\nThe Stooges are Ur–almost everything noisy and confrontational that came after them, dumb metal to punk. Iggy is an unnerving icon and true seeker, from the gutter to Dinah to his later life as a leathery-thin showman, raconteur, and pretensioso. These guys don’t speak to me, but they did whatever it was they did with a fervor — deaf, literally and figuratively, to the pleas of anyone who told them to do something different.\n\n43. R.E.M. — Bill Berry, Peter Buck, Mike Mills, and Michael Stipe (2007)\n\nThese guys epitomized a style of American rock-and-roll postmodernism that carefully replaced the music’s macho verities with deliberate and evocative art. They produced album after album of highly melodic, rhythmically serious, lyrically mystifying Smart Songs for all the best rock girls and boys. (I was one.) It culminated in “It’s the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine),” one of the most enjoyable singles of the era, and an album called Automatic for the People, a confounding masterpiece of ecstasy, heaven, and regret.\n\n44. John Lennon (1994)\n\nAs the Beatles fractured he concocted some fiery singles (“Cold Turkey,” “Instant Karma”); Plastic Ono Band is in a class by itself; and “Imagine” is a song as pretty as “Yesterday.” Lennon grew as a man and a person in the 1970s, and grappled with that and everything else in public, not afraid to look ridiculous, and hoo boy he did that a lot. There are groovy songs on all of his solo albums save Some Time in New York City, but it must be said they are generally erratic, and not improved by the contributions of his wife. He came back at the end of the ‘70s with a new hello, Double Fantasy, and you know what happened after that.\n\n45. Al Green (1995)\n\nWith the production partner of Memphis’s Willie Mitchell, Green glided through a seemingly unending string of blithe on-the-three-beat soul singles. His distinctive singing style rarely fell into the mannered; he was reservedly carnal, cautiously joyous. Green also produced respectable soul long-players, at least one of them, Belle, exquisite. I wish he’d remained a proud pop star, but personal demons and tragedies put him into gospel, where his talents don’t shine as brightly. Seventies pop radio would have been much less textured without him.\n\n46. Johnny Cash (1992)\n\nThe greatest country rocker of them all, if you’re using the term to mean country stars who came to rock and roll. A gracious albeit haunted presence to the end.\n\n47. Miles Davis (2006)\n\nDavis was the most badass of the badass jazz men of the 1940s and ‘50s, rising over time to craft a tough jazz-rock fusion; like Waters in blues and Cash in country, he’s a titanic enough figure to be an honorary rock star. (The hall should consider inducting Richard Pryor on the same grounds — but not Steve Martin, for chrissakes.) He’s about as iconoclastic as Dylan, with the added edge of having had a career much different from that of a middle-class Jewish kid who was famous and rich by the time he was 22 — like the time Davis was beaten up by a group of NYC cops for the crime of smoking a cigarette outside of Birdland, where he was headlining.\n\n48. Ray Charles (1986)\n\nA graceful, elegant presence over decades. Reinvented soul, and came close to reinventing country, too.\n\n49. Sam Cooke (1986)\n\nIf Redding’s voice accepted darkness, Cooke’s almost never did; its magnanimous flutiness embodied his songs, which seemed happy even when they were sad. His breadth as a pop-blues-soul songwriter was almost unequalled, from “Another Saturday Night” to “Twisting the Night Away” to “You Send Me” to “A Change Is Gonna Come.” He had the makings of a great man and could have become a major figure in the Civil Rights Era, but was killed in a bizarre shooting in 1964, leaving behind one of rock’s most unfulfilled careers.\n\n50. The Who — Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle, Keith Moon, and Pete Townshend (1990)\n\nLed by the deep songwriting of Townshend, with lyrics more twisted, revealing, and coherent than Jagger’s, this band has always been a bit chaotic — until Tommy they didn’t really put out regular albums like most of their coevals, and their hits were all off-kilter, particularly to American ears. (Fun fact: The band had only one top-ten hit in the U.S. over its entire career, “I Can See for Miles,” which went to No. 9.) But anyone can hear now the melodic and lyrical sensitivity of “The Kids Are All Right,” the obsession in “I Can See for Miles,” the maturity and self-loathing in “Who Are You.” And Tommy, well Tommy only grows over the years; the unrelenting musicality and Townshend’s critique of both rock and religion — two different and yet similar systems of belief — deserves all props. With Who’s Next and Live at Leeds they showed precisely how heavy rock on this side of Zeppelin could be, with the added brilliance of Townshend’s pioneering work with keyboard programming, which for pure sonic rockist force has not been equaled to this day. The band went on a remunerative, much-ballyhooed farewell tour in 1989, and through the 30-plus years since Townshend and Daltrey have kept returning to the road with twists on the theme. Watch it, guys — one of these days we’re all going to get wise.\n\n51. Bruce Springsteen (1999)\n\nJersey guy, nice wife. (He met her at work.) More than any other great star, he is a recombinant concoction of his forebears: Van Morrison, Dion, Presley, Spector, just about everything else he listened to growing up. It is a tribute to his vision, work ethic, and perfectionism that he looks good in their presence. And his albums from Born to Run to Born in the U.S.A. are effectively produced.\n\nOne thing you hear hall folks talk about when considering acts for inclusion is props like, “… and they are still out there playing!” This is exactly the wrong approach. Bands should be given more credit for quitting early and keeping their percentage of top-quality work high. In theory, this could encourage great artists to consider retiring from recording rather than foisting mediocre and labored work on their fans year after year, late into their career. (It would also save Rolling Stone critics from having to figure out ways to tell us how artists like Springsteen and the Stones are back in top rock-and-roll form and have, amazingly, released yet another five-star album.) In Springsteen’s case, the debate could go, “Hey, he wrote ‘Born in the U.S.A.’” And in response someone could say, “I got two words for you: ‘Outlaw Pete.’”\n\nNote that Springsteen was inducted without the E Street Band. His manager, Jon Landau, is a major figure at the hall, and of course Springsteen himself has lent his name to it for years. Hard to believe that his solo induction wasn’t what he and Landau insisted on, which strikes me as a bit ungenerous. The E Streeters, including Steve Van Zandt, were clumsily brought in in a subcategory a few years ago.\n\n52. The Beach Boys — Al Jardine, Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson, and Dennis Wilson (1988)\n\nThe rest of the band didn’t do much, save for Mike Love’s lyrics in the earliest of the band’s hits, which were monomaniacal in their focus and in a way held Brian Wilson’s vision back. (Compare Love’s “Little Deuce Coupe” with “Don’t Worry Baby,” which had an outside lyricist.) Still, to virtually everyone they were the biggest American “band” of the 1960s, first denizens of a nearby faraway place of love, sand, and sun, and then voyagers to heavenly places with “Good Vibrations” and Pet Sounds. And Wilson’s singular vision — his pursuit of “teenage symphonies to God” — to this day personifies the troubled genius.\n\nThe Beach Boys had many later members; Bruce Johnston played from ‘65 or ‘66 on, and that’s Blondie Chaplin, for example, singing “Sail On, Sailor,” but they, unlike later, useless members of the Grateful Dead, weren’t inducted into the hall. The Beach Boys’ 1988 induction ceremony featured one of the first and greatest public inductee meltdowns, this one from Mike Love, who is one wound-up old Republican.\n\n53. Randy Newman (2013)\n\nRock’s bleakest-funniest singer songwriter, iconoclastic even by an iconoclast’s standards; his best album has a bouncy song about a dancing bear and a winsome song about the slave trade, his second-best album is a song cycle about the South with chorus after chorus that resonate, bleakly and horrifically, today. And now he writes songs for Pixar movies.\n\n54. Radiohead — Colin Greenwood, Jonny Greenwood, Ed O’Brien, Philip Selway, Thom Yorke (2019)\n\nThe band’s leap forward with OK Computer was a wild ride indeed; “Paranoid Android” was one of the great rock freak-outs since the 1960s, scaling up to a guitar attack to end all guitar attacks. They haven’t looked back, grappling both with artistic evolution and how to dampen a fame that threatened to overwhelm them. And they may go down in history as the last great rock band. Radiohead was voted in on its second year of eligibility, which is fine, and this despite the band’s public disparagement of the whole affair.\n\n55. The Pretenders — Martin Chambers, Pete Farndon, James Honeyman-Scott, and Chrissie Hynde (2005)\n\n“Talk of the Town,” “Back on the Chain Gang,” “Brass in Pocket, “2000 Miles” … they are all as sophisticated as rock gets, and they pass as pop songs, too. Hynde is also one of our most precise and meaningful vocalists, from that pure emotional vibrato to those dark whispers.\n\n56. Talking Heads — David Byrne, Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison, and Tina Weymouth (2002)\n\nAlong with Jonathan Richman, they showed early on that punk was a thing not a sound; austere and questioning at first, then with a darkened postmodern paranoia, and then on to an ecstatic, highly mental funk, elevated by a top-tier rhythm section. Leader Byrne’s post-Heads artistic excursions, largely tedious, are far too assiduously attended to by fans and compliant chroniclers.\n\n57. Steely Dan — Walter Becker and Donald Fagen (2001)\n\nThey merged New York hipster intellectualism to Southern California anomie, and first flecked it with and then immersed it all into a persuasive haute jazz sheen. In later albums the sheen took over, but the stuff up to and including Gaucho remains some of rock’s most substantively suave work.\n\nBecker and Fagen engaged in some high-level trolling of the hall of fame for a year before their induction, posting various demands on their website and mocking the hall in various ways. (My favorite: They started a ballot of what musicians should be inducted into the hall as part of Steely Dan, including the names “Juliana Hatfield” and “Illinois Elohainu.”) At the ceremony, Becker delivered this kiss-off: “We’re persuaded it’s a great honor to be here tonight.” In 2001, on the other hand, the pair lapped up their ridiculous win of the Record of the Year Grammy for the far-past-their-prime Two Against Nature. They probably expected less from NARAS.\n\n58. U2 — Bono, Adam Clayton, The Edge, and Larry Mullen Jr. (2005)\n\nThey were inevitable stars as much as anyone on this list, though it probably didn’t seem that way to them at the time. Even more than Pearl Jam, they are good at being rock stars: They behave intelligently and responsibly and deliver the goods live. U2 put out pretty great albums (like Achtung Baby) long after it was expected and, once the great albums stopped coming, continue to play the PR game so well people don’t really notice. Their presence is so large now, we forget they were kids from one of the most fucked-up cities in the Western world who liked the Ramones. Not a bad rhythm section, and you have to give the Edge credit for expanding the sound of rock guitar, generally at the service of riffs riffs riffs. Yes, I am aware the lead singer has become annoying. Embarrassing scene in Jared Kushner’s new memoir: The afternoon he and Ivanka and Rupert Murdoch, yachting on the French Riviera with Billy Joel in tow, motored to shore for lunch at Bono’s villa.\n\n59. Little Willie John (1996)\n\nThis is what the hall of fame is useful for: Those who know of John know that he recorded the original version of “Fever”; he was also a wunderkind who played with Count Basie when he was 15, recorded lots of seminal R&B-slash-rock tracks and was an inspiration to a generation of Motown singers. He was convicted of manslaughter and died in prison at the age of 30.\n\n60. Willie Nelson (2023)\n\nNelson’s effortless and ruminative songwriting, guitar playing, singing, and overall behavior each exist on a remarkable level. His rambling journey to stardom was part Tristram Shandy, part Gulliver’s Travels, worthy of induction into the Rock Hal on its own. He came to national attention when he was 42, followed by his picaresque evolution in the decades since, parts of which you’ve probably heard about (pot, Farm Aid, more pot, touring, “To All the Girls I’ve Loved Before,” IRS trouble, etc. etc. etc.).\n\n61. Michael Jackson (2001)\n\nJackson’s strident fans insist he is a pop phenomenon on par with the Beatles or Elvis. His mid-1980s stardom was phenomenal, and he spurred it on with various tactics, some clever, some Trumpian, and of course many self-destructive. All that said, let’s put it into context. In 1983, the year of Thriller, Jackson had been a presence in American life for nearly 15 years; he had just come off a multiplatinum album and was offering nothing but impeccable pop music. In other words, he was a big known star who suddenly got very big.\n\nElvis and the Beatles by contrast offered confrontational, controversial music — music of the world to come, not the world they were in. As I noted above, virtually everyone who bought a Presley or Beatles record was stepping into a new world. That’s different from what Jackson’s fans were doing. That said, as a pop artist Jackson was certainly innovative, and set new standards. And as a Presley-like pop archetype of failed potential, very rock and roll. Right now, though, Jackson’s legacy is compromised; it’s hard for me to imagine anyone who’s watched the Leaving Neverland movie being able to view Jackson the person the same way again. (The hall, however, says his two inductions will stay put).\n\nBack to the museum in Cleveland: From the start, Conforth says, said, his work was hampered by a division between the Cleveland folks, who’d put up the money and had the best interests of Cleveland and the hall’s success in mind, and the New York people, most of whom didn’t want the hall in Cleveland in the first place. “The people from New York thought their shit didn’t stink,” Conforth says. “They were rich New York elite artsy-fartsy hip people who knew what was going on. They figured the Cleveland people were a bunch of rubes who couldn’t tell the time of day. The Cleveland people hated the New York people because they didn’t give the Cleveland people any respect and were always telling Cleveland people what to do, even though the Cleveland folks came up with all the money. The two boards really, really hated each other.”\n\n62. Elton John (1994)\n\nJohn unquestionably is a pop-rocker not a rocker. He was flamboyant, but he was also someone you could take home to mother. But there has always been an unmistakable integrity to both his music and persona; with an erratic but prolific lyricist in Bernie Taupin, he ruled ‘70s rock and put out more good-to-great albums during this period than Paul McCartney and Billy Joel combined, though not Stevie Wonder. He bravely came out in the mid-1970s. He also has something Joel doesn’t have and that is somehow irrelevant to McCartney, which is good taste. His melodrama never goes overboard and his pop instincts were always natural and flowing.\n\nJohn is a remarkable person on his own, of course, but I think the hall could have initially included Taupin, who wrote the lyrics to John’s first decade or so of albums. (Note that Taupin did get in in 2023, through the the Musical Excellence Award side category.) So many inconsequential and latter-day figures have been piled in with so many mediocre bands that it seems nuts to leave out people like Taupin, who was unquestionably a key part of John’s art.\n\nThe hall has never figured out how to deal with the fact that a lot of rock acts are really something more than the folks in the PR photos. I don’t think the Monkees should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, for example, but if they were going to be, it would be insipid to include just the band members. They were actors, after all, hired to play a band on TV with a team of producers behind them (sometimes warring) who hired songwriters and called the day-to-day shots of the operation. A quaint fiction in the music industry remains that keeps attention focused on the public face. Back in 1990, there was a scandal when a disposable dance-pop duo with the atrocious name Milli Vanilli won a Best New Artist Grammy … after which it was revealed that the two guys hadn’t sung on the record, and the award was rescinded. Fine. But wasn’t this basically just a case of inaccurate musician credits? Shouldn’t the award have then gone to whoever did sing on the record? Weren’t they still the Best New Artist?\n\n63. The Supremes — Florence Ballard, Diana Ross, and Mary Wilson (1988)\n\nDiana Ross has now been a star for nearly 60 years, floating on a magical (projected) personality and a dulcet voice. (I know the other Supremes had spectacular voices as well, but the rules are different for a superstar, which is what Ross is.) The trio (with a lot of help from Berry Gordy, the stable of songwriters and the Motown production teams) radiated a sophistication and a glamour that never clashed with the urgent emotions and happy stories they sang out. For the record, they were probably the second-biggest band of the ‘60s, after the Beatles. Ross herself is not in the hall as a solo artist, though her personal emergence into an iconic ‘70s and ‘80s solo career was a lot bigger than those of many other post-’60s-group inductees, and her well-known uber-Diva from Hell status makes her iconic and notable in an entirely different way.\n\n64. The Drifters — Ben E. King, Rudy Lewis, Clyde McPhatter, Johnny Moore, Bill Pinkney, Charlie Thomas, and Gerhart Thrasher (1988)\n\nDon’t shoot me if I don’t have this precisely right, but the long history of the Drifters comprises three entirely different operations recording under the name; McPhatter sang on the hit “Money Honey”; King on “Save the Last Dance for Me”; and Lewis on the aggregation’s most timeless performances, “Up on the Roof” and “On Broadway.” This artistic trichotomy obviously creates issues for the hall. They went with the easiest way out and threw everyone in together, but you could make the argument that the groups were so different they should have been in essence considered separately, with the edition featuring Lewis (whose name is somewhat forgotten) winning out, and McPhatter and King getting their own individual induction consideration. But I take the point it was a mess, however it was resolved.\n\n65. The Everly Brothers — Don Everly and Phil Everly (1986)\n\nEarly exemplars of the potent emotional beauty the music was capable of conveying, spurred by the cosmic fraternal mix of their voices. Among other things, like the rhythm guitar work, they were the perfect showcase for the songs of Boudleaux and Felice Bryant. The Everlys’ delivery of “I’m young, I know / But even so” in Boudleaux’s “Love Hurts” is a master class on how rock was learning to flood oceans of meaning into the slightest of words.\n\n66. Patti Smith (2007)\n\nSmith is an interesting figure, a bit too hippieish and too accepting of shamanism and religiosity for my taste. She’s also one of the most pretentious artists in the history of rock and roll. But albums one and three — Horses, Easter — were sprawling and daring, more daring than anything else at the time. She also re-injected Van Morrisonian levels of exaltation and ecstasy to the music, which then lived on in the work of R.E.M., among others. And on the more mature Wave there are timeless songs like “Frederick” and (speaking of ecstasy) “Dancing Barefoot.” Nothing she’s done in the 40-plus years since is comparable.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the hall: I asked Conforth for an example of how the Cleveland–New York division manifested itself. He said that one day shortly after he started work he was abruptly summoned to meet with Wenner, so he dutifully boarded a plane to New York. “It was an official audience,” Conforth says drily. “It was at the new Rolling Stone’s offices [on Sixth Avenue]. Jann’s office was in the corner; it has glass windows on two sides; quite large, but sparsely decorated, with a huge desk in the corner. I was allowed to enter the inner sanctum. There’s Jann, barefoot. He sits down behind this huge desk, puts his bare feet up on the desk, looks at me, pulls out a cigarette, lights it, and says, ‘Now do you see where the real power lies?’”\n\n67. The Coasters — Carl Gardner, Cornell Gunter, Billy Guy, and Will “Dub” Jones (1987)\n\nThese guys, with their blaring, irresistible novelty numbers, were an important transitional act between R&B and rock. Most of the songs were written by Leiber and Stoller, who took the group with them to Ertegun’s Atlantic Records. I don’t care that much about novelty songs, much less novelty acts, but the Coasters’ hits are much more complex and nuanced than they had to be.\n\n68. Eddie Cochran (1987)\n\nThere is something irresistible about Eddie Cochran. Presley always seemed a bit Olympian; Cochran was rough and ready, but never distant. He looked like a biker with a heart of gold, and he had the good humor and self-awareness to pull off something like “20 Flight Rock,” the talent to provide the surprising melodies and lilts in hits like “Something Else.” He could play a lot of instruments and sometimes recorded tracks by himself. In Cochran songs, the rhythms just don’t stop. But this is another tragic rock story: Cochran was killed at 21 in a car crash while on tour in the U.K.\n\n69. Beastie Boys — Michael “Mike D” Diamond, Adam “Ad-Rock” Horovitz, and Adam “MCA” Yauch (2012)\n\nWith lots of help from producer Rick Rubin, they made their mark with extreme brattiness married to highly artful and meaningful samples. There are authenticity issues here — they’re all Manhattan rich kids acting like Bowery Boys and exploiting an ethnic music from a much-more-attenuated socioeconomic plane to boot, but they evolved quickly enough into sonic extremes to make it clear their intents were loftier, and managed to take an audience along with them. PR Smart enough, too, to formally distance themselves from early anti-women behavior.\n\n70. Janis Joplin (1995)\n\nA viscerally exciting performer with a mighty voice and a magnanimous and supple mind. She was the first female rock star; among nonblack artists, you could argue that she had been the most persecuted, and endured the most humiliations for her art, having grown up creative, gay, and odd in Texas. She got driven out twice before finding her voice in an unexpected stardom; besides an ongoing ménage à trois with Peggy Caserta and Kris Kristofferson (to hear Caserta tell it), however, Joplin’s life wasn’t happy, or pretty, and she died tragically just three years into her recording career, in 1970.\n\n71. B.B. King (1987)\n\nI have to bow to the blues experts on this. He is a lovable character; a friendly, articulate guitarist; and beyond that a brilliant musician and networker. (He took Ike Turner to Sun Records.) He is considered by all to be a, if not the, quintessential bluesman, but to me lacks something. His signature song, “The Thrill Is Gone,” came late in his career. But over the years his name has become so iconic you can’t really argue about it.\n\n72. Roy Orbison (1987)\n\nAnother of the music’s true oddballs, with a heavenly voice, a reverberating psyche, and lots of hits.\n\n73. Donna Summer (2013)\n\nShe fought hard to emerge from a Eurodisco enclave and became, for a time, a glamorous pop-disco superstar whose luscious gatefold albums penetrated deep into the consciousness of suburban America, culminating in Bad Girls, a powerful rock-disco triumph.\n\nSummer got in late (nearly a decade and a half after she was eligible), but she’s still a good example of how the hall has been pretty welcoming to women — at least when it comes to inductees. There are actually two important but separate issues when it comes to women and the hall. The one getting the most attention of late, led by the laudable work of critic and academic Evelyn McDonnell, is that a pathetically small percentage of the hall’s nominees are women. (You can read her full Longreads essay here.)\n\nThat’s an objectively true observation, but I respectfully disagree somewhat with McDonnell’s analysis. The hall has plainly treated women better than it has gay men, for example. The nominating committee has gone out of its way to bring in all the folks you’d expect, from Ruth Brown to the Pretenders, as well as slightly off-kilter figures like Laura Nyro, Nina Simone, and Brenda Lee. There are several female artists who plainly shouldn’t be in the hall, Joan Jett and Pat Benatar among them, and, of course, Stevie Nicks’s solo-career induction is hall cronyism at its worst. But that’s a good thing. There are a lot of unqualified male artists in the hall, too, and it should be acknowledged that the powers that be have extended the same opportunity to some unqualified women.\n\nTo my mind, in recent years, the most glaring oversight involved major figures who were already in the hall as part of a group but whose solo careers had not yet been recognized — like Carole King and Tina Turner. In the last few years, the first two of those were finally inducted, and with (presumably) Sykes kicking ass behind the scenes, we’ve seen the overdue induction of the Go-Go’s. There have, in fact, been a dozen or more female or female-led acts inducted in just the last two years. If you’re counting, that brings the total up to about 45 female or female-fronted acts, or about one-sixth of the total. (If you count individual inductees, of course, the percentage is much worse, given the large percentage of rock bands with a lot of guys in them.) You could (and should) induct another half-dozen female artists tomorrow but, considering the nature of both the music and the hall, it wouldn’t move the percentages much. Right now the more glaring female absences as far as inductees go are Diana Ross and maybe the Carpenters and PJ Harvey.\n\nThe real scandal at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is the paucity of women on the nominating committee. The numbers fluctuate, but about 10 percent of committee members over the years have been women. One of the big changes under Peresman is that the number of women on the nominating committee has been growing and currently seems to be eight or nine, which is a slight improvement over the four and five we would see in the 2010s. But that’s still not enough. If you wanted to, you could make the argument that there are fewer women than men inducted into the hall because there were more male rock artists than female. Fine — but it’s ludicrous to claim that there aren’t as many female fans as male fans or that there aren’t as many women qualified to nominate Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members. The exclusion of women from the nominating committee is disgraceful. If you want to target the hall’s sexism, focus on that.\n\n74. Big Joe Turner (1987)\n\nTurner had an unmistakable and infectious voice and used it, irresistibly, to turn blithe not-quite-blues, not-quite-rock songs into highly enjoyable romps. One of them, “Shake, Rattle and Roll,” from 1954, is one of the most undeniable early proto-rock tracks. Recorded by Atlantic’s Ahmet Ertegun — and also ripped off by him — Turner was one of many Atlantic artists who did not receive royalties, or royalty statements, for decades. (More about this under Ruth Brown, below.) Ertegun paid for Turner’s funeral, but could certainly have done more for Turner when he wasn’t, you know, dead.\n\n75. Jackie Wilson (1987)\n\nAn early R&B pioneer with a heavenly voice; a fearless and dynamic showman. A little frenetic for my taste but connoisseurs say he’s one of the greats. Famously had a heart attack onstage while singing the words, “My heart is crying!” which ended his career.\n\n76. The Allman Brothers Band — Duane Allman, Gregg Allman, Dickey Betts, Jai Johanny Johanson, Berry Oakley, and Butch Trucks (1995)\n\nThe epitome of southern rock, with an unexpected and often thrilling jazz undertow that utterly transcended the genre. Duane Allman, who died in a motorcycle accident before he turned 25, was quite a guitarist (that’s him rolling with Clapton on “Layla”), and his brother Gregg is a good singer and wrote some great songs. The talented Betts stepped up big time after Duane’s death and the band rocked on credibly through the 1970s. At their best, which is to say on At Fillmore East and on a surprisingly large percentage of their classic-era studio cuts, heady as it got. And probably the only rock band that should have two drummers.\n\n77. The Shirelles — Shirley Alston Reeves, Addie Harris, Doris Kenner-Jackson, and Beverly Lee (1996)\n\nThey were the thinking-person’s girl group, not overseen by Phil Spector. Deservedly, the first of the girl groups to be inducted.\n\n78. Paul McCartney (1999)\n\nFree of the Beatles, McCartney’s first solo album was a dandelion wisp of nothingness; in its own way it was sort of a punk-rock thing to do. He then became an awesome hit-making machine and was probably the best-selling artist of the ’70s. Band on the Run remains a strong album. I find McCartney refreshingly one-dimensional and dependable, save for this one thing: He is both industrious and lazy. There are great songs strewn throughout his albums from this period, and slighter, highly enjoyable ones, too, but way too many throwaways. But, as with so many other things in McCartney’s life, it just doesn’t matter. One day when he had nothing better to do he recorded a single called “Mull of Kintyre,” which became the biggest-selling single ever in Britain to that point. That’s the way his life goes. You don’t have to like him. He still likes you.\n\n79. ZZ Top — Frank Beard, Billy Gibbons, and Dusty Hill (2004)\n\nRock’s purest power trio and arguably its most iconoclastic practitioners of whatever variant of the blues it is exactly they work in. In the 1970s, this band, along with maybe AC/DC, in effect kept mainstream pre-punk rock honest, eschewing Zeppelin-like flamboyance for a heady, steady, implacable guitar attack. In their own way, subtle. Then they became MTV stars. I don’t find that ‘80s shit interesting, but it’s pretty clear no one’s ever told them what to do. Mnemonic device: The guy who doesn’t have a beard is named Beard. Hill died in 2021.\n\n80. T. Rex (2020)\n\nT. Rex is one of the hall’s most long-overdue inductions. The music’s the definitive manifestation of glam. Marc Bolan’s stop-and-start story through the latter half of the 1960s parallels Bowie’s with the admixture of an almost Spinal Tap–like odyssey of changing musical approaches, intermittent penury, and aesthetic belly flops — all of which should have centrifuged him out of the culture. But if Bolan was one thing, he was a star. Fey, intelligent, gritty, and seemingly without self-consciousness, he finally found himself, inserted that new persona into the rock landscape, and became a sensation — in England at least. After a few albums of outrageous folk rock under the name Tyrannosaurus Rex (one of the least appropriate rock names ever), he finally went electric, changed his band’s name to T. Rex, and ascended with a deranged rant called “Bang a Gong (Get It On).” That was basically it in the U.S., but in the U.K., he personified gender-bending outrageousness and silkily irresistible riffs and had lots of hits before a car accident killed him in 1977. Here he is in full, uh, flower.\n\n81. The Jackson 5 — Jackie, Jermaine, Marlon, Michael, and Tito Jackson (1997)\n\nThey came late in Motown’s classic period, and their initial celebrity was short, but they sold a lot of records, and with “I Want You Back” were the voices on arguably Motown’s purest pop concoction. And the youngest had a lot of potential. Later recorded as the Jacksons.\n\nIs the hall of fame voting process rigged? No one I spoke to said it definitely was, but no one jumped to the hall’s defense to say it couldn’t be, either. Particularly in the early years, no one I spoke to could particularly recall how the votes of the nominating committee were taken down; nor did any one know how the votes from nominating committee members who weren’t there in person were brought into the mix. And no one had any idea how the votes from the voters at large were tabulated. The story about Wenner clinging to a penultimate vote count to sneak Grandmaster Flash into the hall in front of the Dave Clark Five surprised me in this way: Having read Sticky Fingers I had no expectations at all that any sort of count was kept in the first place. In the words of one industry vet who watched the process for years: “I am sure Jann put his finger on the scale whenever he could. He’s Jann Wenner: he did whatever he wanted.” Was the hall his “personal fiefdom,” as Hagan said it was? “That’s wrong and it’s certainly not the case in terms of who gets in or out,” Wenner said. Peresman said that ballots come in and are tabulated each day, and that Wenner, before he left the hall, had nothing to do with the counting.\n\n82. The Temptations — Melvin Franklin, Eddie Kendricks, David Ruffin, Otis Williams, Paul Williams, Dennis Edwards (1989)\n\nOne of the signature Motown acts and one of the best-selling groups of the 1960s; they expanded their brand in the ‘70s (“Ball of Confusion”), culminating in possibly the most daring and unusual track Motown ever recorded, “Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone.”\n\n83. The Yardbirds — Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Chris Dreja, Jim McCarty, Jimmy Page, Keith Relf, and Paul Samwell-Smith (1992)\n\nThis manic white-blues outfit, with the Stones, were the commercial face of the move from white-bluesmen wannabes to rock stars. The Yardbirds lacked the Jagger-Richards songwriting juggernaut; their early hits were written by outsiders. But they still had an outsize influence on the music, first with lead guitarist Jeff Beck, who was followed by Eric Clapton, and their later sonic experiments (like “Shapes of Things,” which they did write), groovy to this day. But arguments over direction, authenticity, and commercialism marked the band’s devolution and ultimately led to a conflicted Clapton’s departure. The group’s last guitarist, Jimmy Page, reconstituted the operation as the New Yardbirds and then changed its name to Led Zeppelin.\n\n84. Lou Reed (2015)\n\nHighly erratic post-Velvets as a solo artist, with four or five classic albums (two of them live) standing out among utter insanity (Metal Machine Music) and lots of odd, inconsistent, embarrassing stuff — and that’s during his heyday! But at his best, he expanded the idea and potential of rock with everything from his waspish personality to his perversion-laden demimonde to his best songs, some of them quite lovely, which took the music to places it had never been before, and to his personal life as well, including living with an on- and off-again trans girlfriend for several years during his ‘70s stardom. For all his faults, Reed’s solo career was striking and important; but he wasn’t inducted until two years after his death, some nearly 20 years after his eligibility, another example of the hall’s discomfort with stars who don’t play by traditional gender rules.\n\n85. Hank Ballard (1990)\n\nBallard & His Midnighters are the greatest rock band you’ve never heard of. Ballard co-wrote and performed some proto-rock tunes, notably “Work With Me Annie,” whose bland innuendos caught the imagination of a musical generation and inspired a raft of response songs. They have lots better work than that. It’s interesting to listen to the Midnighters’ stuff — it’s a great intro to early rock, with sax as the lead instrument, and they have oodles of great songs.\n\n86. Madonna (2008)\n\nHer controversies, from “Papa Don’t Preach” onward, have always been more than a bit épater le bourgeois, her proclamations of control manifestations of insecurity. Look closely and you see that she’s never written a number one hit on her own; and as her career has gone on she seems more and more ridiculous. But that’s not the critical consensus, which says she was a game changer, a master at pop marketing, a postmodern superstar. Whatever.\n\nOne of the difficulties the hall has grappled with is how it should take into account popularity; Madonna was, after all, one of the very biggest pop stars of all time. The hall’s original charter made little mention of popularity — and most of the hall’s principals over the years have said that excellence is the key criterion. There is an argument for excellence that gets overlooked in all sorts of artistic endeavors, so let me make it clear: Being popular gets you a lot of things. You get all the money, you get all the freedom, and, particularly in the rock world — forgive the sexist construct — you get all the girls, or boys. And yet there are always screeching partisans of that highly fortunate group that demands they get all the awards for excellence as well, just because they are popular. They don’t! Fuck off!\n\nAt the same time, there is a strata of rock bands that you wouldn’t say are defined by their popularity but over some significant professional career have been somewhat under-appreciated, let’s say, by critics. The Moody Blues are a great example. They pioneered a sort of orchestrated, lush, and it must be said ambitious rock but have never quite been taken seriously.\n\nWhat to do? The hall has been schizophrenic. Early on in the hall’s history, Tamarkin, the Goldmine editor, was on the hall nominating committee. He brought in a petition that had been signed by 5,000 people asking for the Moodys’ induction. Tamarkin recalls he was asked if he was an enthusiastic supporter of the band. He said he wasn’t — but thought the petitions mattered. The meeting moved on. Around the same time, he recalls, one label head was promoting the Moonglows, the doo-wop group; Tamarkin said another exec said, “They aren’t going to sell a single ticket to the dinner,” and that idea was dropped. (The Moonglows got in, eventually, in 2000; the Moodys in 2018.)\n\nIn recent decades at the hall, the long delay in inducting some of these bands, like the Moodies and Chicago, to some extent points to their second-tier status. Now it seems like the hall is rushing to usher in bands like the Foo Fighters in their first year of eligibility. I think the hall should resist these impulses, but at this point, that particular cruise ship from hell has sailed, and Lionel Richie and Jon Bon Jovi are manning the piano bar in the first-class lounge. As for Tamarkin, he said his stay on the nominating committee came to an end after he published an editorial in Billboard criticizing the hall. “I had the honor of being taken to task by Phil Spector in front of the entire nominating committee,” he said. He wasn’t asked back. He’s now the editor of a lively website, Bestclassicbands.com.\n\n87. Grateful Dead — Tom Constanten, Jerry Garcia, Donna Jean Godchaux, Keith Godchaux, Mickey Hart, Robert Hunter, Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh, Ron McKernan, Brent Mydland, Bob Weir, and Vince Welnick (1994)\n\nSome people like them, of course. The disinterested can see they have recorded only a handful of good songs (“Uncle John’s Band,” “Touch of Grey,” maybe one or two others) and that too many of the band’s “musical excursions” could also be described as “noodling.” And while the Dead’s amen corner has ooh’ed over the fact the band had an “outside lyricist” in Hunter for decades, the fact remains Hunter is a terrible writer. But. With the Airplane, the Dead personified the San Francisco psychedelic scene, such as it was; over time came to embody a chaotic communal independence, however mismanaged due to Garcia’s disconnectedness; and in their latter days provided a comfy hippie vibe for stadia of slumming yuppies.\n\nNote that the lineup of the band inducted into the hall includes several highly inessential members, ranging from the dubious (Constanten, Mydland) to the risible (Welnick, formerly of [checks notes] the Tubes, who merely appeared live with the band a few years before Garcia died). Tamarkin says he contacted the band for the hall — and that the Dead gave the hall an “all or none” ultimatum, and the hall caved. Garcia, being Garcia, was supposedly on his way but never made it to the ceremony.\n\n88. Tupac Shakur (2017)\n\nUnlike a lot of people on this list, he was a true star. Definitely a tragic figure (shot to death in 1996), a sometimes-principled lyricist, and fluid, not-too-show-offy rapper who tried to expand the music even as he kept one foot in its least estimable parts. I wish this smart man had been smart enough not to run with Suge Knight. Since he wasn’t — it’s incontrovertible that he participated in goon-squad violence both with Knight and on his own, and of course was duly convicted of rape — it’s hard to figure what his legacy would have been had he lived, and harder still to imagine him breaking free of his hypocritical sentimentality. Could he have become the man his biggest fans say he could have been? I’m skeptical but also sorry we’re not going to find out. By the way, it was a little unseemly for Snoop Dogg, in his introduction of Shakur, to talk about he and Shakur had “targets on [their] backs.” I mean, Snoop’s the guy who was driving the car in 1993 when his bodyguard shot a guy in the back.\n\nAgain, back to Cleveland. Conforth, the curator, is a highly entertaining interview. He was a scholar who’d done his dissertation at Indiana on the San Francisco scene. He turned out not to be a good fit for the hall. One mistake he made, he allows, is requesting to work in Cleveland, which he thought made sense at the time but led to many of his decisions being overruled from New York. Even two decades later he remains amused at his tenure. It was plain from the start, he says, what the hall of fame’s mission was: “Here’s another way we get to masturbate in public and show the world how great we are.” The difficulties he had working for Wenner & Co. were such an open secret by the time he left that he received a call from the producers of the Oprah Winfrey Show. They wanted him to appear for a segment on “When Dream Jobs Become a Nightmare.”\n\n89. Santana — José Chepito Areas, David Brown, Michael Carabello, Gregg Rolie, Carlos Santana, and Michael Shrieve (1998)\n\nSantana himself was a guitarist’s guitarist, fluid and — unusual back then — distinctively tough from the start, as well as a stalwart of the San Francisco sound. Santana the band’s Latino-psychedelic fusion was distinctive. Unlike a lot of their hall cohort, all of their early albums are worth hearing today; they are immensely varied and persuasive without being chaotic or unfocused. Santana was a heavy band — and, not for nothing, they could lay claim to delivering one of the signal performances of the Woodstock movie.\n\n90. Sam & Dave — Sam Moore and Dave Prater (1992)\n\nNo argument here. These guys are molten, as good as soul got in the 1960s.\n\n91. Tom Waits (2011)\n\nThis out-where-the-trains-don’t-run singer-songwriter began as a mildly parodic storyteller at a Lynchian nightclub; he was almost rock for a few years, and then became highly respectable in the avant music world, with sharply diminishing payback for casual listeners. Looking back, it’s plain he’s actually a species of art rocker à la Bowie, only coming out of a different demimonde. Also like Bowie, wrote lots of good songs, like “Jersey Girl,” “Time,” and “That Feel.”\n\n92. Eminem (2022)\n\nThis talented rapper, a mad white man-child, made his way in a Black business on his marked talents — including a spitting delivery, hair-trigger temper, and wowza technique that combines speed, lucidity, and, believe it or not, subtlety. His often blistering raps displayed a highly provoking combination of brattiness, humor, and satire. To demonstrate his street cred, I guess, these elements combined in his early years to produce so many shitty remarks that it’s hard in the end to forgive him, even though that’s what you have to do with men-children when they (finally) grow up. Again, he’s a rapper of the first rank, but it should be noted that many of his most delightful tracks are a bit solipsistic, which means they’re all about what a naughty boy he is and … yawn. Still, he remains off-and-on interesting to this day, even if his most lasting work may end up being the not solipsistic and positively rockist “Lose Yourself.” Again, I have to note that it feels off for the hall to be ushering in so outspoken a (white) disciple of someone like Rakim without having inducted Eric B. & Rakim themselves.\n\n93. Rod Stewart (1994)\n\nYou look at Rod Stewart and think, “How could this seemingly clueless jock accomplish such things?” But there is something there, way down deep inside Stewart — a cozy, almost kittenish, relaxation in his early work with the Faces, and then growing self-actualization and perspective. The stories he told, from his first solo album on, painted a picture of this boy-man’s growth into wisdom. He delivered terrific work — Every Picture Tells a Story, Never a Dull Moment — and then some poorly produced stuff, but even as he got goofier throughout the rest of the 1970s, he crafted memorable performances, both excavating old chestnuts (“It’s Not the Spotlight,” “This Old Heart of Mine”) and writing his own classics, too (“I Was Only Joking,” “The Killing of Georgie”). He’s been unafraid to be a fool in the years since, resting on solid commercial instincts, and somehow retains a princely charm to this day.\n\n94. Fleetwood Mac — Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, Christine McVie, John McVie, Stevie Nicks, and Jeremy Spencer (1998)\n\nEven in its first ten years, this band’s resilience was remarkable, genre after genre, front man after front man, finally accepting the admixture of a pair of Bay Area hippies in 1975 and concocting some of the biggest albums of the era. Stevie Nicks has her fan base of course, and is a strong songwriter, yet still she’s the slightest of the most celebrated version of the band’s principals. Christine McVie is one of the premiere British vocalists of her generation (and wrote lots o’ hits as well), and as for Lindsey Buckingham, well, he evolved to become a subtle orchestrator of pop ineffability, perhaps the most efficient and iconoclastic since Brian Wilson. Rumours deserved all its sales, and Tusk is a masterwork. The omission of Bob Welch, a significant member of the band in the early 1970s, is another of the hall’s inconsistent exclusions.\n\n95. Bob Seger (2004)\n\nThere are a lot of ‘70s leftover acts in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that don’t belong there. Is Seger different? I’d point to “2+2=?,” as potent a Vietnam protest song as the genre produced, and this was back in 1965. (If you haven’t heard it, you have a treat coming.) More than a decade later he edged into the popular consciousness with the terrific (and terrific-sounding) Night Moves, its title song heartland rock’s greatest moment, and then was a reliable purveyor of deeper-than-they-needed-to-be tunes (“Feel Like a Number”). As late as “Against the Wind” he delivered pathos and power, and wrote good songs almost to the ‘90s. He plays to this day in the same T-shirt and jeans he always did. All respect.\n\n96. Ricky Nelson (1987)\n\nNelson was part of the first two years of inductions into the hall, which I find bizarre. He played the son on his father’s (huge) ‘50s TV show The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, and used that to become a very bland teen idol. (To be fair, he was a very big star in his heyday.) Some of his early hits have become timeless, like “Hello Mary Lou,” and there were a lot of them, none of which he wrote. But he was hardly an influence and faded out of view save for a ‘70s hit, “Garden Party,” which he did write. It was, ironically enough, a somewhat petulant response to fans uninterested in his new sounds. The life of a teen idol is a real bitch. He died in a 1984 plane crash, which might have had the original hall of fame nominators in a nostalgic mood. (I originally ranked him much lower but, after thinking about it, had to admit that he’s certainly among the 100 most important rock artists.)\n\n97. Peter Gabriel (2014)\n\nFor years in the 1980s, post-Genesis, he was in his own way as radical as Reed or Bowie; his unexpected albums — all titled Peter Gabriel, weird in itself — matched disturbing soundscapes over sometimes disturbing subject matter. And yet, almost by force of will, he seemed to crawl out of his psychic pit toward a warmer and brighter humanism: “Solsbury Hill” and “Biko,” sure, but also “In Your Eyes,” which became in its live incarnation everything pop and rock could be. He later went multiplatinum and became somewhat less interesting, though his Womad tours occasionally captured the wild, pan-everything promise of his best work.\n\n98. AC/DC — Brian Johnson, Phil Rudd, Bon Scott, Cliff Williams, Angus Young, and Malcolm Young (2003)\n\nLike ZZ Top, possessors of a signature guitar sound that goes beyond the primal. Very dumb, very limited, they came out of a grimy ‘70s pockmarked with just a few unbelievably killer tracks (like “It’s a Long Way to the Top [If You Wanna Rock ’n’ Roll]”) before, out of some entirely mystifying burst of creativity, creating a pair of albums, Highway to Hell and Back in Black, whose production and song quality rocketed upward. They pursued a unique sound at a time when no one could have been expected to like it, and kept fucking doing it. And their live shows make Motorhead, say, sound prissy by comparison.\n\nThe hall started out, and basically remains, a boys’ club, and an older boys’ club at that. The hall has no interest, of course, in excluding women from the inductees, and hasn’t done a terrible job at it. The real problem is with the nominating committee. Over the years, it has tended to grow large, then go through a sudden purge; those purged speak darkly about the removal of older people from the group. This is perhaps true but only in the sense that, since virtually everyone on the committee is a white male over 50 — and, in most cases, far past even that — there’s really no one to jettison except older guys. This happened in 2007 and again in 2016.\n\nBesides that, the committee is New York centric. The critics on the committee have traditionally leaned heavily to the Rolling Stone crowd, a group whose critical discrimination atrophied years ago, and in any case over the years learned to be highly aware of the wants of their boss. Along with the increasing numbers of women, the end of Wenner’s influence in the hall seems likely to have an effect on the makeup of the committee and its nominations.\n\n99. The Cars — Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes, David Robinson, Ric Ocasek, and Benjamin Orr (2018)\n\nOne of the first big New Wave acts; hard to hear now, but in the Doobies ‘n’ Supertramp era their angular compositions, odd shifts in tone, and semi-postmodern musical touches were somewhat foreign sounding, and welcome. Then the world shifted a bit and they became cuddly ‘80s MTV reliables.\n\n100. The Police — Stewart Copeland, Sting, and Andy Summers (2003)\n\nThese were New Wave poseurs hiding a conventional"
