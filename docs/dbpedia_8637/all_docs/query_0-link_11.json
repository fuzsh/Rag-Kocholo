        "text": "Mumford (film) A psychologist named Dr. Mumford hangs out his shingle in a small town that also happens to be named Mumford and begins dispensing no-nonsense advice to an array of quirky locals. Included are a shop-by-mail-addicted housewife, an eccentric young billionaire, and a mild-mannered pharmacist with delusions of lascivious grandeur. Dr. Mumford’s unique style of therapy has a surprising effect on the community, sparking romance in some of the most unlikely places. A Touchstone Picture. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan. Released on September 24, 1999. Stars Loren Dean (Mumford), Hope Davis (Sofie Crisp), Mary McDonnell (Althea Brockett), Ted Danson (Jeremy Brockett), Martin Short (Lionel Dillard), David Paymer (Dr. Ernest Delbanco), Alfre Woodard (Lily), Pruitt Taylor Vince (Henry Follett), Jane Adams (Dr. Phyllis Sheeler), Jason Lee (Skip Skipperton). 112 min. Since no one town had all the elements required by the producers to pass for the town of Mumford, they filmed in a total of eleven California locations—St. Helena, Healdsburg, Santa Rosa, Petaluma, Sebastopol, Calistoga, Napa, Guerneville, Sonoma, Kenwood, and Tomales. Filmed in Cinemascope. Released on video in 2000."
