        "text": "Jason Sudeikis, Will Forte, Ed Hemls & Jason Batemen are... Mumford & Sons - \"Hopeless Wanderer\" (Sam Jones)\n\nMarcus Mumford, Winston Marshall, Ben Lovett, and Ted Dwane are four British chaps that have been making some pretty All-American-sounding Bluegrass and Folk Rock together since about 2007; While Mumford & Sons' sophomore album, Babel was released back in September 2012, Island/Glassnote Records are still earnestly pushing successful Modern Rock radio singles from it. Mumford & Sons don't even appear in their latest music video, \"Hopeless Wanderer\" ...instead, director Sam Jones quite ingeniously re-cast former SNL alum and Arrested Development funnymen Jason Sudeikis (Mumford), Will Forte (Dwane), Ed Helms (Lovett), and Jason Bateman (Marshall) as a slightly exaggerated, ramped up version of the band. Now, it could just be a mere coincidence, but Ed Helms & Jason Sudeikis, who I think kinda look alike, are also co-starring in the upcoming summer blockbuster, We're The Millers, along with middle-aged bombshell Jennifer Aniston.\n\nSam Jones and his rag-tag \"Mumford & Sons\" essentially manage to implement, embellish, and shit all over any sort of working-class, down-country public image that the band has established over the years. We're talkin' about some pretty CLASSIC, side-splitting imagery here: seemingly aimless piano pushing, moody acoustic-driven field performances, dusty dirt road slo-mo shots, some dude-on-dude action, and general calamity. Whether you're a die-hard Mumford & Sons fan or not, \"Hopeless Wanderer\" is pretty damn \"brave for a band to hire famous people to make their whole [deathlessly old-timey pose] look stupid in their own music video\" to paraphrase modern-day Shakespeare Tom Breihan (Stereogum). Frontman Marcus Mumford is supposedly working on a Folk-tinged soundtrack for the upcoming Coen Brothers flick, Inside Llewyn Davis with comeback kid Justin Timberlake, a movie which is currently scheduled for a December 20th release.\n\nLabels\n\nLana del Rey [Lizzy Grant] effectively became 2011's \"It Girl\" with the release of her phenomenal debut single, \"Video Games\" (Stranger) . Like many struggling singer-songwriters, Grant has been signed, dropped, and significantly changed her public image since bursting onto the scene (2009). With that said, it can be assumed that Lana del Rey has collected just as many \"haters\" as she has avid supporters. To be perfectly honest, the only other artist I can think of that made this much commotion... garnered so much wide-spread buzz/hate and critical acclaim -- right out of the gates -- with just one track is Britney Spears . And maybe in this post- Mike musical era, that's the true synthesis of Pop Culture: Britney Lynn Spears . After months of repeated teasing and speculation, Lana del Rey 's major label debut, Born 2 Die will [finally] be released this coming Jan. 30-31, 2012. Pitchfork reports that it will feature \"Off to The Ra\n\nLindsay Lohan essentially embodies exactly \"What NOT to Do In Hollywood :\" Fame, fortune, success... sex, drugs & Rock \"N\" Roll . Within a fairly short period of time, Lohan somehow managed to obtain a plentiful helping of POWER @ a very young age. This gradual rise-downfall was captured on film; Between 1998-2010, she portrayed a wide array of roles across the silver screen in movies including: Mean Girls, Bobby , Herbie Fully Loaded , Georgia Rule, Machete , and Freaky Friday . Between rapid-paced film shoots, Lindsay Lohan also found time to record 2 Pop Rock albums for Casablanca , Speak (2004) and A Litter More Personal-Raw (2005). Needless to say, Lindsay Lohan has gotten roped up in a lot of troubles and woes with the law over the last 3-5 years... a vicious cycle of drugs, arrest, court, rehab, \"daddy issues,\" jail time [Repeat]. That's the pure basics of it - But Google that shit for additional info, if necessary. Towards the end of\n\nChocolate & Cheese (1994) was one of the first albums I bought with my own money. I was in some sort of BMG Music Club , where you'd buy 5 CD's and then get 10 for \"FREE.\" It was all sent through mail order and you picked the titles from some special booklet. I'm almost positive that Chocolate & Cheese's side boob-baring album cover was what initially drew me in... mind you, I was 12-15 and the zany Ween logo/middle finger CD graphic really didn't hurt either. Honestly, I forget how I really felt about it @ the time, but a few years later, my older cousin Josh told me that Ween were this BIG college \"jam band.\" CKY did some sort pf 93.3 radio takeover to promote their new album and played \"Freedom of '76\" late that night on air. Needless to say, I re-visited Chocolate & Cheese @ about 20-something this go 'round and I fucking loved it! Ween were really weird, yet talented... almost too talented. I can vaguel"
