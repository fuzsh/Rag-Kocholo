        "text": "Usually good breeding counts for something. Conversely, when a\n\npedigree is offered and expectations are not met, the resulting let\n\ndown is an even greater disappointment. A great example of this is\n\n“Dreamcatcher.” The film is based on a Stephen King book, directed by\n\nLawrence Kasdan with Morgan Freeman playing one of the principle\n\nroles. All this promise means nothing, as “Dreamcatcher” is a\n\nslickly-produced, standard-issue, science fiction yawn more suited to\n\nbe a television movie than a theatrical release.\n\nSince I never read the source material, I don’t know how faithful\n\n“Dreamcatcher” is to King’s book. However, I do know the screenplay\n\nis the source of most of the film’s problems. The film causes a sense\n\nof deja vu due to the plot being a questionable blend of “Alien,”\n\n“Outbreak,” “Independence Day,” and “Men In Black.”\n\nBasically, “Dreamcatcher” tells the story of four friends Henry\n\n(Thomas Jane), Beaver (Jason Lee), Jonesy (Damian Lewis) and Pete\n\n(Timothy Olyphant), who received psychic gifts in their childhood\n\nwhen they rescued a seemingly retarded boy from bullies. These\n\npsychic abilities have not brought happiness or success to the\n\nfriends, who are now adults. In addition to their special link, the\n\nfriends also take an annual trip to a remote cabin in Maine where\n\nthey hunt, drink and play cards.\n\nWhile out hunting alone, Jonesy comes across a nearly frozen, lost\n\nand disoriented man. Taking him into the cabin, Jonesy and Beaver are\n\ndisturbed by the man’s deteriorating condition, which includes\n\nalarming indigestion. Unbeknownst to them, the man is one of many\n\nresidents in this remote area whose bodies are playing host to alien\n\ninvaders.\n\nThe cavalry arrives in the form of Col. Abraham Kurtz (Morgan\n\nFreeman) and Capt. Owen Underhill (Tom Sizemore). Kurtz and Underhill\n\nare members an elite offshoot of the Army dedicated to eradicating\n\ncrash-landed aliens. Like a throwback to the 1950s, all aliens in\n\n“Dreamcatcher” are evil, violent and hideous. The special effects,\n\nrelatively good examples of current technology, are definitely not\n\nfor the squeamish.\n\nKasdan has directed sensitive and moving personal dramas such as\n\n“Grand Canyon,” “The Accidental Tourist,” and “Mumford.” Kasdan has\n\nmanaged to get good performances from his actors and the movie has a\n\nhigh-quality feel. The director cannot really be faulted for the\n\nfilm’s shortcomings, other than agreeing to work on this fatally\n\nflawed project in the first place. I cannot recommend “Dreamcatcher”\n\nexcept for the most die-hard science fiction fans. For those so\n\ninclined, I suggest waiting for the release of “The Matrix Reloaded.”\n\nIf you do go to see “Dreamcatcher,” be prepared to think you’re in\n\nthe wrong theater as the film is preceded by an animated short “The\n\nLast Flight of the Osiris.” The technology of this added feature is\n\namazingly realistic right down to goose bumps on the characters’\n\nskin. However, the plot of “The Last Flight of the Osiris” is\n\nmaddeningly confusing and completely out of context to the following\n\nfeature.\n\n* VAN NOVACK, 48, is the director of institutional research at\n\nCal State Long Beach.\n\n‘Willard’ is a great, psychotic comedy\n\nB-movie fans, we have a winner. “Willard” is a classic\n\nhorror/comedy flick. This is a remake of a popular 1971 horror movie\n\nabout a guy who uses his massive horde of rat friends to get revenge\n\non people. If you like dark comedies full of sarcastic humor, this is\n\nyour movie.\n\nWillard Stiles is a painfully shy man whose self-esteem problems\n\nkeep him from reaching his full potential. He learns to accept and\n\nlove himself by making friends with the rats in his mom’s basement.\n\nIs there anything more beautiful than the relationship between a man\n\nand his rats?\n\nWillard’s life is divided between caring for his elderly mother\n\nand groveling in front of his tyrannical boss. Virtually everyone\n\ntells Willard that he’s a failure; fortunately, he has lots of little\n\nrodent friends who love him just the way he is. They’ll do anything\n\nhe asks, which is kind of empowering in a dysfunctional, psychotic\n\nsort of way.\n\nCrispin Glover seems at home portraying the creepy introvert\n\nWillard. He’s got a physical presence that’s both pitiful and eerie.\n\nThink of a cross between George McFly (“Back to the Future”) and\n\nNorman Bates (“Psycho”). It’s not hard to believe he’d rather share\n\nhis pillow with a rat than a woman.\n\nJackie Burroughs and R. Lee Ermey deliver great supporting\n\nperformances as Willard’s overly needy mother and dictatorial boss.\n\nBurroughs is hilarious as Willard’s mother. Her character is so frail\n\nthat her skin barely hangs on her bones, but she still manages to\n\nbully Willard and crush any ounce of ego he starts to develop. Ermey\n\nseems typecast as Willard’s loud, abusive supervisor. His character\n\nis similar to the Marine drill sergeant he portrayed in “Full Metal\n\nJacket,” but is even more intense and sadistic. Burroughs’ and\n\nErmey’s characters are so far over the top that they’re both more\n\nlaughable than scary. To enjoy the humor you’ve got to have a fairly\n\nhigh threshold for psychological trauma, but they’re both hysterical.\n\nThe Web site (www.willardmovie.com) has a bizarre clip of Crispin\n\nGlover singing the 1972 hit, “Ben.” I’ve always thought that a song\n\nabout a young boy’s affection for a killer rat was a pretty strange\n\nconcept, but considering that Michael Jackson sang the original ...\n\nit just doesn’t seem that shocking.\n\nIf you want to see “Willard” in a theater, you’re going to have to\n\nhurry. I was the only person in the audience for the show I saw. This\n\nwill probably be gone from the theaters in week or so, and out on DVD\n\nby May or June. It will be a great rental. Learning how they trained\n\nthe 500 plus live rats used in this movie will be an interesting DVD\n\nextra.\n\n* JIM ERWIN, 40, is a technical writer and computer trainer.\n\n“View from the Top” charms, lacks logic\n\n“View from the Top” is a comedy about a young woman named Donna\n\nwho comes from rural, modest beginnings. Played by Gwyneth Paltrow\n\n(“Shakespeare in Love”), Donna has high hopes for her future. She\n\ndreams of becoming a first class international flight attendant and\n\nis willing to work hard and make sacrifices to ensure that her dreams\n\ncome true. Along the way she discovers love and betrayal, and finds\n\nherself following ideals that no longer reflect her true desires.\n\nBrazilian director Bruno Barreto tries in earnest to make cohesive\n\nthe script supplied by Eric Wald, but to no avail. Full of holes and\n\ncontrived circumstances, the film does not know what form of comedy\n\nit’s aiming to be, and as a result, it falls into uncertainty. From\n\nnonexistent employee positions at Big Lots to impossible security\n\nbreaches at airports, the story also makes frequent layovers into\n\nunreality. The pace is slow and comedies should never drag as this\n\none does.\n\nTo their credit, the actors all attempt to make something out of\n\nthe poorly structured story. As a result, the film ends up being\n\nsweet, yet convoluted.\n\nPaltrow as Donna further demonstrates her ability to handle\n\nblue-collar material in a role similar to the one she played in\n\n“Duets.” Christina Applegate is amusing, as Donna’s insecure and\n\njealous friend. Candice Bergen is genteel and laid back as a Southern\n\ncharmer and renowned flight attendant turned motivational speaker and\n\nauthor. Mark Ruffalo (“You Can Count On Me”) is endearing as Donna’s\n\nlove interest.\n\nKelly Preston and Rob Lowe, however, are surprisingly underused in\n\nwhat amounts to bit parts. While ironically, Joshua Malina, the actor\n\nwho recently replaced Rob Lowe as a regular cast member of TV’s “The\n\nWest Wing,” has more screen time as a gay flight attendant. Mike\n\nMyers, is occasionally over the top, and at times uncommonly\n\nreserved, lending to the overall uneven feeling of this movie.\n\nThis film was made more than a year ago and was delayed in its\n\nrelease due to the political climate regarding the lack of humor in\n\nair travel after Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nSadly, being “dated” hampers this film’s basis in reality. It is\n\nobvious the script is pre-Sept. 11 yet incongruously, the story seems\n\nto be set in the present day.\n\n“View from the Top” does supply an escape from reality and there\n\nare occasional situation-induced laughs to be had. What the film\n\nfeatures, if somewhat annoying at times, is charm. Even if you don’t\n\nenjoy the story, you might enjoy the soundtrack that spans a range of\n\nhappy hits, some related to flight, from the 70s and 80s.\n\nIt will never reach the “top” but you could “view” worse.\n\n* RAY BUFFER, 33, is a professional singer, actor and voice-over\n\nartist.\n\n“View from the Top” nothing but rot\n\nCan a small town girl realize her dreams of becoming a glamorous\n\ninternational flight attendant without love getting in her way? Is\n\nthere enough Maalox in the world to prevent me from barfing when I\n\nthink about this kind of story? “View from the Top” is a very simple\n\nromantic comedy that offers some laughs, but doesn’t actually deliver\n\nvery much as a movie.\n\nThis is the kind of unimaginative pseudo-romantic story that’s\n\nreally easy to rip to shreds; however, I know that there are people\n\nwho really enjoy these Doris Day fantasy movies. If you enjoy movies\n\nlike “Sweet Home Alabama,” then you’ll like this. If you think cheese\n\nmeans individually wrapped slices of processed American cheese, this\n\nis probably a move you’ll love. For me, the plot is saccharine and\n\npainfully predictable; the characters are two dimensional and bland;\n\nand the general theme of how life is lonely when you have the “View\n\nfrom the Top” is a moronic cliche.\n\nThe cast includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Candice Bergan, Michael Myers\n\nand Christina Applegate. There’s also some familiar faces making\n\ncameo appearances including Rob Lowe. These performers are all much\n\nbetter than this movie and I’m still wondering why any of them\n\nappeared in this.\n\nMyers carries this movie. He takes some pretty average material\n\nand creates some really funny scenes. It’s nice to see Applegate get\n\nroles in larger movies, but she needs to find a way to break out of\n\nher stupid bimbo (via “Married ... With Children’s” Kelly Bundy)\n\ntypecast. Paltrow’s main function is to walk around in short skirts\n\nlooking pure and innocent. Bergan plays Paltrow’s mentor. She’s the\n\ngreatest flight attendant in history. Bergan’s character brings some\n\nsubtle humor into the movie that can fly right by you if you aren’t\n\npaying attention.\n\nMy biggest complaint is one of my pet peeves about movies in\n\ngeneral. There were several scenes that I remember seeing in TV\n\ncommercials and in the trailers that were not included in the story.\n\nFor example, the T-shirt line dancing scene shown in the commercials\n\nis just one of the outtakes shown behind the credits, it’s not\n\nactually part of the movie. It’s not that I was desperate to see any\n\nof those scenes, I just don’t like it when scenes featured in the\n\ntrailers aren’t part of the movie.\n\nThroughout “View from the Top” are a lot of visual jokes related\n\nto fashion, sweaters and hair. These kinds of things are all symptoms\n\nof a movie being a total chick flick. Likewise, the painfully\n\npredictable break-up/make-up romances (will they ever get back\n\ntogether?) also go with that turf. When Paltrow cried I wasn’t sure\n\nwhether to say, “Awwwwwwww,” or make a sound kind of like that into\n\nmy popcorn box. The fact that Hostess Twinkies are still popular\n\ntells me that there’s an audience for this kind of empty-headed love\n\nstory, but it’s just not my cup of tea.\n\n* JIM ERWIN, 40, is a technical writer and computer trainer."
