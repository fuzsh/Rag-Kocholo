        "text": "American actress and musician (born 1980)\n\nZooey Claire Deschanel ( ZO-ee day-shə-NEL; born January 17, 1980[1][2]) is an American actress and musician. She made her film debut in Mumford (1999) and had a supporting role in Cameron Crowe's film Almost Famous (2000). Deschanel is known for her deadpan roles in comedy films such as The Good Girl (2002), The New Guy (2002), Elf (2003), The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), Failure to Launch (2006), Yes Man (2008), The Happening (2008), 500 Days of Summer (2009) and Our Idiot Brother (2011).[3][4][5] She has also ventured into dramatic film territory with Manic (2001), All the Real Girls (2003), Winter Passing (2005), Bridge to Terabithia (2007) and The Driftless Area (2015).[6][7] From 2011 to 2018, she starred as Jess Day on the Fox sitcom New Girl, for which she received nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and three Golden Globe Awards.\n\nFor a few years starting in 2001, Deschanel performed in the jazz cabaret act If All the Stars Were Pretty Babies with actress Samantha Shelton.[8] In 2006, Deschanel teamed up with M. Ward to form She & Him, and subsequently released their debut album, Volume One, in 2008. They have since released six albums: Volume Two (2010), A Very She & Him Christmas (2011), Volume 3 (2013), Classics (2014), Christmas Party (2016), and Melt Away: A Tribute to Brian Wilson (2022). She received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Song Written for Visual Media for \"So Long\", which was featured on the soundtrack of the 2011 film Winnie the Pooh. Besides singing, she plays keyboards, percussion, banjo, and ukulele.\n\nDeschanel is also a co-founder of the female-focused website HelloGiggles, which was acquired by Time Inc. in 2015.[9]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nZooey Claire Deschanel was born in Los Angeles, California on January 17, 1980,[2] the younger daughter of cinematographer and director Caleb Deschanel and actress Mary Jo Deschanel (née Weir). Her paternal grandfather was French, from Oullins, Rhône, and her paternal grandmother came from a Quaker family; she also has Swiss, Dutch, English, Irish, and other French ancestry.[10][11] She was named after Zooey Glass, the protagonist of J. D. Salinger's 1961 novella Franny and Zooey.[12] Her older sister is actress Emily Deschanel, who starred in the Fox crime comedy-drama series Bones.[13][14]\n\nDeschanel lived in Los Angeles, but spent much of her childhood traveling because her father shot films on location; she later said that she:[15]\n\n... hated all the traveling... I'm really happy now that I had the experience, but at the time I was just so miserable to have to leave my friends in Los Angeles and go to places where they didn't have any food I liked or things I was used to.\n\n— Zooey Deschanel\n\nShe attended Crossroads, a private preparatory school in Santa Monica, where she befriended future co-stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Kate Hudson.[12][16][time needed] She sang throughout high school, planning to pursue a career in musical theatre and attending French Woods Festival of the Performing Arts.[11] She attended Northwestern University for nine months before dropping out to pursue acting.[15][17]\n\nActing career\n\n[edit]\n\n1997–2002: Early acting credits\n\n[edit]\n\nDeschanel had a guest appearance on the television series Veronica's Closet in 1998. She made her film debut in Lawrence Kasdan's comedy Mumford (1999), revolving around the neurotic residents in a small town and co-starring Hope Davis, Jason Lee, Alfre Woodard and Mary McDonnell.\n\nThat same year, she appeared in a non-singing role in the music video for The Offspring's single \"She's Got Issues\", which premiered on September 27, 1999.[18] Deschanel was a judge for the ninth Independent Music Awards.[19] In 2005, she modeled for Chanel and Clements Ribeiro, and in 2010, she signed to represent Rimmel.[20]\n\nDeschanel co-starred in Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical Almost Famous (2000), where she played Anita Miller, the rebellious older sister of a teenage journalist. Despite a modest box office response, the film received critical praise,[21] winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Film – Musical or Comedy. Deschanel appeared in the independent drama Manic (2001), as the love interest of a troubled teen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). The film was screened at the Sundance Film Festival and received a limited theatrical release. The New York Times found Deschanel to be \"particularly spontaneous, unaffected and emotionally direct\" in her role.[22]\n\nFollowing early notice, Deschanel took on supporting parts in four feature films released throughout 2002: Big Trouble, The New Guy, The Good Girl, and Abandon. In the comedy Big Trouble, with Tim Allen and Rene Russo, she played the daughter of a devoted and reluctant woman, and in the teen comedy The New Guy, starred as a guitar player in a band. Deschanel portrayed a cynical, plain-spoken young woman working in a big-box store in the black dramedy The Good Girl, opposite Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gyllenhaal. The psychological thriller Abandon saw her play the roommate of a woman involved in her boyfriend's disappearance. Deschanel also made a one-episode appearance in Frasier, as Roz's out-of-control Cousin, Jen. The New York Times reported that Deschanel was \"one of Hollywood's most sought-after young stars\",[12] in 2002, and the Los Angeles Times wrote in early 2003 that Deschanel had become a recognizable type, due to \"her deadpan, sardonic and scene-stealing [film] performances\" as the protagonist's best friend.[11] Deschanel objected to her typecasting, arguing, \"A lot of these roles are just a formula idea of somebody's best friend, and it's like, I don't even have that many friends. In high school, I stayed home all the time, so I don't know how I'm everybody's best friend now.\"[11]\n\n2003–2010: Breakthrough\n\n[edit]\n\nDeschanel obtained her first leading film role debut in the independent drama All the Real Girls (2003) as Noel, a sexually curious 18-year-old virgin who has a life-changing romance with an aimless 22-year-old. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was an arthouse success. Her performance received wide critical acclaim,[11] and Variety remarked: \"Performances are all credible and naturalistic, but standing out from the rest is Deschanel's work, which evinces an impressively direct connection to her character's emotions. The actress does a wonderful job presenting a young woman who is trying, with varying degrees of success, to give voice to all sorts of things she has never felt or expressed before\".[23] She received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Actress.[24] Also in 2003, Deschanel starred opposite Will Ferrell in the Christmas comedy Elf as a deadpan department store worker and the love interest of a man raised by Santa's elves.[25] Reviewers found the film to be a \"spirited, good-natured family comedy\" as part of an overall positive critical response;[26] and, budgeted at US$33 million, Elf made US$220.4 million worldwide.[27]\n\nIn 2004, Deschanel starred in Eulogy, and in 2005 played Trillian in the film adaptation of Douglas Adams's science fiction novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. She acted in Winter Passing (2005), co-starring Will Ferrell. Deschanel next appeared in Failure to Launch (2006), as the neurotic roommate of Sarah Jessica Parker's character. She also had a recurring role in four episodes of the Showtime television series Weeds from 2006 to 2007 where she played Kat, Andy Botwin's ex-girlfriend. In September 2006, it was announced that Deschanel had signed on to play 1960s singer Janis Joplin in the film The Gospel According to Janis, to be co-written and directed by Penelope Spheeris.[28] The film was scheduled to begin shooting in 2006, but was then postponed indefinitely;[29] it was then resurrected again, with a planned release date of 2012, before being cancelled altogether in 2011. Deschanel expressed frustration with the cancellation, saying she had spent three years working on imitating Joplin's scratchy singing voice.[30]\n\nIn 2007, Deschanel played a music teacher in Bridge to Terabithia, and the voice of a penguin in the animated film Surf's Up. She had a small role as Dorothy Evans in the revisionist Western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and starred in the B comedy Flakes, which was released in only one theater.[31] Deschanel starred as DG in the Syfy miniseries Tin Man, a re-imagined science fiction version of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. It aired in December 2007. Deschanel also narrated the children's book Players in Pigtails.[32][third-party source needed] She voiced Mary, Cletus's daughter in three episodes of The Simpsons since debuting on the April 27, 2008, episode, \"Apocalypse Cow\".[33]\n\nIn M. Night Shyamalan's thriller The Happening (2008), she starred opposite Mark Wahlberg as a couple trying to escape from an inexplicable natural disaster. Despite largely negative reviews, critic Roger Ebert felt that Wahlberg and Deschanel's performances \"bring a quiet dignity to their characters\",[34] and globally, the film made US$163 million.[35] She starred in the independent comedy Gigantic (2008), which screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and was distributed for a limited release in certain parts of the United States only. In the comedy Yes Man (also 2008), she played an unorthodox singer and the girlfriend of Jim Carrey's character.[36] The film grossed US$223.1 million around the world.[37]\n\nDeschanel reunited with Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the independent romantic drama about the development and demise of a relationship (500) Days of Summer (2009).[38] The film garnered critical acclaim and became a \"sleeper hit\", earning over $60 million in worldwide returns, far exceeding its $7.5 million budget.[39][40][41] Mark Adams of the Daily Mirror found the film to be a \"modern romance for grown-ups\" and a \"sweet-natured, funny, deeply-romantic tale\" blessed with \"top-notch performances by Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt, who are both charming and have real chemistry\".[42] In December 2009, Deschanel guest-starred in a Christmas episode of the Fox crime procedural comedy-drama Bones, which was the first-ever on-screen pairing of the Deschanel sisters.[43][44]\n\nSince 2010: New Girl and other projects\n\n[edit]\n\nDeschanel was originally the top choice for Janet van Dyne / The Wasp in an early draft of Joss Whedon's The Avengers in which she would have played a prominent role. However, once Scarlett Johansson was cast as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, Deschanel was no longer in consideration to portray the Wasp with Janet's daughter Hope van Dyne taking up the mantle in the Infinity Saga, played by Evangeline Lilly.[45] Deschanel starred in the comedy Our Idiot Brother (2011) as the independent and bisexual sister of a dimwitted but idealistic man (Paul Rudd). The production was screened at the Sundance Film Festival, to a generally positive critical reception.[46] She played Belladonna in the stoner fantasy-comedy Your Highness (2011), with Danny McBride and James Franco.[47] The film received negative reviews and bombed at the box office.[48] Describing her role, Roger Ebert noted in its review for the film: \"[Deschanel is] brought onstage, quickly kidnapped by an evil sorcerer, spends a good deal of time as a captive in his lair, is rescued and lives happily ever after. She might as well be a mannequin, for all she's given to say and do. This intelligent, nuanced actress, standing there baffled. Used as a placeholder\".[49]\n\nDeschanel signed on to star as a bubbly and offbeat teacher Jessica \"Jess\" Day on the Fox sitcom New Girl, created by Elizabeth Meriwether. She became a producer on the show and helped build the character,[50] which she has described as a part of her, especially in regards to \"the sort of enthusiasm and optimism\" of her youth.[51] The series premiered in September 2011, and USA Today described her performance as \"a role tailored to launch her from respected indie actor to certified [television] star, Deschanel soars, combining well-honed skills with a natural charm\".[52] She has received an Emmy Award nomination and three Golden Globe nominations for her role.[53][54] The series finale ran on May 15, 2018.[55]\n\nDeschanel hosted Saturday Night Live on February 11, 2012.[56] That same year, she was featured in a commercial for the iPhone 4S (Siri).[57]\n\nIn Rock the Kasbah (2015), she played a Los Angeles singer taken to Afghanistan by her former manager (Bill Murray). Despite a US$15 million budget, the comedy only made US$3 million at the North American box office.[58] She obtained the role of a mysterious woman in the neo-noir drama The Driftless Area (2015), screened at the Tribeca Film Festival and released on video on demand and home media.[59] She voiced a kind-hearted Bergen, Bridget, in the animated family comedy Trolls (2016), which grossed US$344 million worldwide.[60]\n\nIn December 2020, Deschanel appeared in the music video for Katy Perry's song \"Not the End of the World\".[61] In 2021, she co-hosted the ABC television series The Celebrity Dating Game with Michael Bolton.[62]\n\nIn January 2022, she began cohosting Welcome to Our Show, a New Girl rewatch podcast with co-stars Hannah Simone and Lamorne Morris, distributed by IHeartRadio.[63] Deschanel appears as Kelly in season 3 of Physical released on August 2, 2023[64] and Nancy in Dreamin' Wild, released on August 4, 2023.

Patrick Caldwell of the Austin American Statesman wrote: \"The album gently rambled through 13 tracks of sun-dappled pop, with a gentle Orbisonian charm and sweet, wistful vocals from Deschanel.\"[70]\n\nDeschanel recorded \"The Fabric of My Life\" for a 2009 advertising campaign for Cotton Incorporated.[71] On March 23, 2010, the second She & Him album, Volume Two, was released.[72] Deschanel and M.
