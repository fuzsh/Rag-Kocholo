        "text": "Hello, I'm Jason Bateman.\n\nThis is my career timeline.\n\n(upbeat music)\n\n♪ Oh those Golden Grahams ♪\n\n♪ Taste like honey grahams ♪\n\nIt's a delicious honey graham taste.\n\nSo things started out in commercials\n\nas a lot of careers do.\n\nI loved doing it because I got to skip school.\n\nAnd often times I got to sort of fun stuff,\n\ngo kart riding or bike riding and then eat a lot\n\nof sugary cereal and get all hopped up.\n\nThat was fun for me as a kid.\n\nI remember I had to kind of go down a hill\n\nin kind of a soap box derby for one of these commercials\n\nor show that I could follow a tape X on a stick\n\nI remember for this Honey Nut Cheerios commercial.\n\nMy skillset was pretty high pretty early\n\nand you could tell.\n\n♪ Try those Golden Grahams and have a golden day ♪\n\n(footsteps on stairs)\n\nLittle House on the Prairie\n\nwas sort of my first big type of thing.\n\nI was on that show for a year, got adopted into that family.\n\nI just remember them being a really nice group of people.\n\nAnd Michael Landon was directing\n\nand acting and writing the shows\n\nand that was a great first experience\n\nto have as a little kid.\n\nSeeing that it's not a scary place the set.\n\nI want you to come live with us.\n\nGee, Mr. Ingalls, gee.\n\nMiss Summers?\n\nChicago may be the windy city,\n\nbut when you arrive it will be breathless.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nAfter Little House on the Prairie went on to Silver Spoons\n\nand a few other sitcoms for years after that.\n\nAgain, skipping school was a big part of the draw.\n\nI wasn't too focused on money at the time,\n\ndidn't have to spend on a lot of things.\n\nYou know I was a kid, somehow those clothes and food\n\njust magically appears in the house.\n\nSo it was all about skipping school\n\nand in this case playing in front of a live audience.\n\nIt was a lot of fun to play, at least Silver Spoons\n\nfor an established character named Derek.\n\nI'm sorry, it's just this darn puberty.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\n[TV Announcer] Sunday on Knight Rider,\n\na shocking accident destroys kid's memory.\n\nStay away from me.\n\n[TV Announcer] Can guest star Jason Bateman\n\nhelp Michael save him?\n\nThere was an episode of Knight Rider I remember\n\nwhere I was 15 so I couldn't yet legally drive\n\nbut I got to drive the Kit car, the Knight Rider car,\n\nI remember that was even more excited than skipping school.\n\nI got to drive this Trans Am.\n\nAnd of course, David Hasselhoff being there\n\nwas pretty sweet too.\n\nSkip school and drive a car and chum it up with The Hoff.\n\nWhat's this?\n\n(beeping)\n\nAnd I know we've all given up a lot.\n\nBrian here lost a girlfriend\n\nand well Gurney had to give up the track team\n\nand well, me, I've lost a lot of sleep\n\nbetween dating Brian's old girlfriend\n\nand the track team practices.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nAfter Silver Spoons there was a show called It's Your Move\n\nwhere I got to play an even more devilish character,\n\na sort of a conniving con man,\n\nbut in school.\n\nNow in junior high we made pocket money\n\nselling hall passes, doctors notes\n\nand even the pimple cream we made out of Crisco and sand.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nThat was a lot of fun.\n\nThat only lasted about a year\n\nbecause NBC was getting notes\n\nfrom parents across the country\n\nthat their kids were starting to do the same things\n\nthat they were writing my character to do,\n\nbuild schemes on how to teach kids how to cheat in school\n\nand steal your neighbor's stuff\n\nand how to make a copy of a key that says Do Not Copy.\n\nSo they had to shut it down.\n\nNow we need that $500 to pay the band.\n\nAll my money's tied up in municipal bonds.\n\n♪ Hand in hand we face our fears ♪\n\n♪ Together through the years ♪\n\nAfter It's Your Move was a show called,\n\nwell it started out being called Valerie\n\nand then it was called Valerie's Family\n\nand then they switched it to The Hogans\n\nand then The Hogan Family.\n\nSo in five and half years there were four titles,\n\nit was one of my favorite jobs of my career, my life\n\nand I love all those people.\n\nThat was a really, felt like a really safe cave we were in.\n\nLike we all had a job and it was gonna last forever\n\nand then you realize things go away.\n\nThe Hogan Family, that was my first chance to direct.\n\nIt's a multi-camera show where there's studio audience\n\nyou shoot it like a play.\n\nAnd it was a lot of fun and very challenging to work out\n\nsort of the puzzle of making sure each camera's\n\npointed at the next actor who's about to speak,\n\nit was a lot of fun to sort of not drop the ball\n\nfor all these adults that were working there\n\nand giving this kid this responsibility.\n\nSo that was important that I had this positive\n\ninitial experience with directing\n\nand led to my passion, it's such a crappy word,\n\nbut that's why I love directing today\n\nbecause I didn't have a bad experience then.\n\n(howling)\n\n[TV Announcer] Jason Bateman is Teen Wolf Too.\n\nHe's going through a few changes.\n\nI don't howl.\n\nYou don't see any fangs do ya?\n\nI did my first film when I was 18, I think I was,\n\nit was Teen Wolf Too.\n\nWinner of three separate Academy Awards,\n\nBest Picture, Best Actor and I think we got Director too.\n\nAlthough I might be confused,\n\nbut definitely Actor and Picture.\n\nThat was a great decision obviously.\n\nAnd boy, we just had fun on that.\n\nIt didn't feel like we were doing something\n\nAcademy Award winning but boy were we wrong.\n\nCheck it out, you'll see what we made.\n\nWe've arrived.\n\n(howling)\n\n[TV Announcer] Toby Kellogg's been away from his family.\n\nWhile I was gone, they moved.\n\nBack in those days, there was a movie every week\n\nthat the networks would make called The Movie of the Week.\n\nThere was one called Moving Target\n\nthat I remember had a lot of action, running around,\n\nI remember jumping off a bridge,\n\nthis bridge in Century City,\n\nso still to this day every time I drive under it,\n\nI remember shooting that day, that was kinda cool.\n\nAnother one where I played my sister's brother.\n\nTies Justine Bateman\n\nand Jason Bateman in an unforgettable performance.\n\nI have been outside looking into the real world\n\nfor so long.\n\n[TV Announcer] Can you feel me dancing, Monday.\n\nShe played a blind woman in that.\n\nWhat do I have to do to get some attention around here?\n\nGo blind?\n\nShe was great at that except for one day,\n\nshe put her hand through a plate glass window\n\nand cut a nerve.\n\nI think she still does not have feeling\n\nin one of her pinkies to this day.\n\nWatch it, don't take the blind roles.\n\nWhere's my family?\n\n[TV Announcer] Jason Bateman is a Moving Target,\n\nMonday after Alf.\n\nI want you to meet my brother Simon.\n\nAlright.\n\nFireworks.\n\nMaybe he's on to something.\n\nThere was a sitcom called Simon\n\nthat was right at the beginning of the WB\n\nwhen that was first coming out.\n\nAnd we were so low rated\n\nthat we were 109th out of 111 shows\n\nmaybe that were on TV at the time.\n\nWe had hats made for everybody as a Christmas gift\n\nthat just said 109 on it.\n\n♪ Well come on ♪\n\n♪ Come on ♪\n\n♪ Baby don't you want to go ♪\n\nChicago Sons was show that I did\n\nwhere I played one of three brothers that live in Chicago.\n\nAnd I remember Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls\n\nand Gabby Reece, they were both guest stars on that.\n\nI thought that was awesome, I'm a big sports fan.\n\nDavid Krumholtz and D.W. Moffett, we were all brothers\n\nand love those guys.\n\nWe had a really good time.\n\nWhy don't you and I go in the kitchen and...\n\nAnd what?\n\nAnd be in the kitchen.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nGeorge and Leo was another show that I did.\n\nI played the son of Bob Newhart\n\nwhich was an incredible honor and thrill.\n\nI remember being able to see Bob Newhart\n\ndo a five minute set of stand up comedy\n\njust for that studio audience every Friday\n\nwhen we would shoot the show.\n\nThat was pretty cool.\n\nWhat do you say?\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, slow it down.\n\nWhen it comes to letting people into my apartment\n\nI have very strict requirements.\n\nI got first and last months rent.\n\nAnd you've met them all, Vern, refreshments.\n\nSome of My Best Friends was a show\n\nthat was a sitcom on CBS which was about a gay man\n\nliving with a straight man as roommates\n\nand the hysterics that would come from something like that.\n\nNowadays, diversity is much much better represented\n\non television.\n\nI don't think people would think\n\nthat was such a mind blowing concept,\n\nbut at the time, I guess it was\n\nand we definitely had some fun.\n\nIt wasn't a long lasting show though\n\nfor one reason or another.\n\nWhat about wrestling?\n\nI really like to watch wrestling.\n\nSo do I.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nTell me truth, okay,\n\n'cause there's been a lot of lying in this family.\n\nAnd a lot of love.\n\nMore lies.\n\nArrested Development was a show\n\nthat was clearly a huge huge help to me and my career,\n\nthat was a big life preserver for me.\n\nThat was an audition that came my way,\n\nan ex-agent, an old agent of mine, called and said,\n\nhey, I'm looking at the breakdown\n\non this casting for this show\n\nand I see you haven't read for this show,\n\nyou should ask your new agents.\n\nSo I asked my new agents to send me in on that.\n\nAnd they said, yeah, you're not gonna want to read for that.\n\nThat shows never gonna get on the air.\n\nIt's sort of, it's like a mocumentary\n\nadd there's a narrator,\n\nRon Howard's gonna do the narrating\n\nand I don't even know if they're ever\n\ngonna be able to get him.\n\nAnd apparently there's no dressing rooms,\n\nthere's no lights, there's no makeup, it's a mess.\n\nI said, well, can I read it?\n\nThey said, sure you can read it if you want.\n\nSo I read the script.\n\nOf course it was incredibly funny to read\n\nand I went in and read for it.\n\nAnd ended up just sort of guessing right\n\nto what they might want out of that role of Michael Bluth.\n\nThe guy, the boss, Mitch Hurwitz,\n\nfollowed me out of the room and said,\n\nhey, you're auditioning tomorrow for this other show\n\nthat I'm producing, but this one, you like this.\n\nI said yeah, I'd love to do this show.\n\nHe said, great, don't come in for that show tomorrow.\n\n'Cause I don't want that network to see you.\n\nI want you to do this one.\n\nAnd I was like, did this guy just give me the job?\n\nThat was a very exciting day for me and my career.\n\nAnd of course the show turned out\n\nto be one of my favorite things ever\n\nand I owe a lot to Mitch Hurwitz.\n\nNow, do you want to steer?\n\nOr are you too old to sit on your pop's lap and drive?\n\nI think I might be.\n\nOkay.\n\nHi, Mark Loring, I'm the husband.\n\nAnd this of course is Juno.\n\nLike the city in Alaska?\n\nNo.\n\nJuno was a film that was really helpful to my film career\n\nbecause a lot of people loved that movie\n\nand it kind of took off a bit\n\nand it was nominated for Best Picture I believe.\n\nJason Reitman was a very nice man to put me in that film.\n\nAnd it was a really fun, positive, high-quality experience.\n\nI work mostly from home, I'm a composer.\n\nLike Johannes Brahms or?\n\nMore commercial stuff.\n\nLike what?\n\nCommercials.\n\nIf I don't get before eight, she puts on the sweatpants\n\nand once the sweatpants are on, I get nothing.\n\nHi.\n\nHon.\n\nExtract was a film that I did.\n\nA Mike Judge film that I just thought\n\nwas just a really really funny script, a really funny movie.\n\nMike Judge is one of the nicest people\n\nyou could ever hope to work with.\n\nKristen Wiig was in it, Mila Kunis, Ben Affleck.\n\nI highly recommend it.\n\nThat one sort of was under the radar a bit.\n\nI get paranoid when I smoke pot.\n\nIf you smoke a little.\n\n(laughing and coughing)\n\n♪ So when your hopes on fire ♪\n\nI've even done a music video for Mumford and Sons.\n\nJason Sudeikis called me or emailed me or something\n\nand he said, hey, me and Ed Helms and Will Forte\n\nare gonna get together and play the band Mumford and Sons.\n\nThat's kind of all I really needed to hear.\n\nIt just sounded ridiculous and we got to play\n\nbanjos and be real jackasses\n\nand that was put together beautifully well.\n\nThe spelling bee is meant for kids.\n\nRule number 24, the speller have not have passed\n\nbeyond the eighth grade on or before February 1st,\n\nas you can see there,\n\nI have not passed the eighth grade, not ever.\n\nI've always wanted to direct a movie.\n\nI wanted to be father, a husband and direct a movie.\n\nThose are the three things I wanted to do\n\nbefore I got hit by a bus.\n\nThe film was Bad Words.\n\nI'm really happy with it, proud of it,\n\nfew people have seen it, they seem to like it.\n\nAlthough the people that didn't like it,\n\nthey're not stopping me on the street\n\nand telling me I suck and that that was garbage\n\nso, I'm in a little bit of a bubble.\n\nA lot of people might hate that movie,\n\nI just don't know about it.\n\nBut, I'm hearing from those that did.\n\nThere's at least a dozen.\n\nMaybe a bakers.\n\nHey moms, let's break out the rubber pillowcases tonight,\n\nlittle pricks are gonna be counting tears not sheep.\n\nWho's next?\n\nAnd I want to put all $7,945,400 into a hot tub,\n\nget buck naked and play Scrooge McDuck,\n\nthat is 100% my business.\n\nNow where's my money?\n\nThe directing and the acting\n\ngot progressively more comfortable for me\n\ngoing into Ozark, which to me,\n\nI was excited about the challenge of directing\n\nlike a 600 page movie.\n\nI wanted to give it a try and for better or worse,\n\nI couldn't work enough time to prep all the episodes\n\nand ended up just directing four of the 10,\n\nthe first two and the last two.\n\nBut that's just something I'm really really proud of\n\nbecause there's just so many people that I managed\n\nto find, talk into coming to work on that show,\n\ncast and crew and Netflix giving us\n\nsuch a nice generous push and support with it all.\n\nAnd letting us create kinda this tone and atmosphere\n\nand moodiness and dangerousness and chilling elements\n\nthat are all there in the script.\n\nAnd then trying to figure out what that looks like\n\nand what it sounds like was my job as director and EP\n\nwhere you make all these choices\n\nto kind of build this environment.\n\nAnd it's been really really rewarding.\n\nI feel very very fortunate.\n\nSir, there's no business opportunities\n\nthat require that much cash.\n\nNot legal ones.\n\nWell, I agree to disagree.\n\nStaying employed is tough,\n\nsuccess or relevance is paper thin.\n\nAnd you've got to try to align yourself\n\nwith as many talented and kind people as you can\n\nbecause you need them.\n\nThis is not an individual game,\n\nit takes a team and so working with quality people\n\non quality things is what I think fuels longevity.\n\nAnd if you want to stay in it for awhile,\n\nlook for the good people."
