        "text": "American actor, producer, writer, photographer and skateboarder\n\nFor other actors, see Jason Lee (disambiguation) § Entertainment.\n\nJason Michael Lee (born April 25, 1970) is an American actor, filmmaker, photographer, and former professional skateboarder. He is known for playing Earl Hickey in the television comedy series My Name Is Earl, for which he was nominated for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy TV series in 2005 and 2006 by The Golden Globes. He is also known for his roles in Kevin Smith films such as Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), Dogma (1999), Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), Jersey Girl (2004), Clerks II (2006), Cop Out (2010), and Jay and Silent Bob Reboot (2019). Lee won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male for his performance in Chasing Amy.\n\nHis other notable film roles include starring in Mumford (1999), Almost Famous (2000), Heartbreakers (2001), Big Trouble (2002), Dreamcatcher (2003) and Columbus Circle (2011). His voice acting credits include Syndrome in The Incredibles (2004), Bones in Monster House (2006) and the title character in Underdog (2007). Lee starred as Dave Seville in the live-action/animation Alvin and the Chipmunks films (2007-2015).\n\nA former professional skateboarder, Lee is the co-founder and co-owner of Stereo Skateboards, founding the company in 1992 with fellow skateboarder Chris \"Dune\" Pastras.[1] Since 1992, Stereo manufactures and distributes skateboard decks, equipment and apparel, as well as producing skate videos.[1]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLee was born in Santa Ana, California, on April 25, 1970.[2] His father, Greg Lee, was a car dealership manager and his mother, Carol Lee, a homemaker.[3][4] He has an older brother, James (b. 1968). Lee was raised in Huntington Beach and attended Ocean View High School.[5] A hyperactive and energetic child, Lee took up skateboarding after his mother bought him a skateboard with the hope that he would use it to burn off excessive energy.[citation needed] Hooked on the art of skateboarding, Lee spent the majority of his time perfecting his craft, that would eventually lead to him dropping out of Ocean View High School so he could turn pro.[6]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nSkateboarding\n\n[edit]\n\nLee was a professional skateboarder in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1992, he founded Stereo Sound Agency, known as Stereo Skateboards, with fellow skater Chris \"Dune\" Pastras. In 2003, after it had been defunct for a few years, the pair successfully revived the company.[7][8] As of October 2013, Lee and Pastras remained on the professional \"Classics\" team roster.[9]\n\nLee was featured in the skateboarding promotional video, Video Days (1991), filmed for the skateboarding company Blind Skateboards.[10] In 2004, Lee's skateboarding was featured in Way Out East!, a film produced by Stereo Skateboards.[11][12]\n\nIn August 2012, Lee was also featured in a brief video on the skateboard website The Berrics entitled \"Jason Lee decided to come to the park.\"[13]\n\nIn August 2012, Lee participated in the ninth annual Stand-Up for Skateparks Event, which he chaired with Tony Hawk.[14] The event is held annually by the Tony Hawk Charitable Foundation and seeks to \"help create free, quality public skateparks for youth in low-income communities.\"[15]\n\nIn October that same year, a video was released by the Keep A Breast Foundation, featuring various skateboarding identities, including Lee, together with Pastras. The video, contributing to the Foundation's aim to prevent and raise awareness of breast cancer, promotes the \"I Love Boobies\" bracelet. It also features Clint Peterson (Stereo) and Giovanni Reda (WESC), who are both teammates of Lee.[16]\n\nLee later worked with Tony Hawk when he lent his voice and likeness to Tony Hawk's Project 8 to become a playable character.[17] Lee then voiced Coach Frank, a character created during the development of Stereo, in video game Skate 3.[18][19]\n\nProfessional skateboarder and owner of the Girl and Lakai Limited Footwear skateboard brands Mike Carroll[20] has cited Lee as one of his skating influences.[21]\n\nLee has been particularly cited for his 360 flips, which even the trick's inventor, Rodney Mullen, credits him with stylizing and popularizing.[22][23][24][25][26]\n\nActing\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter taking some minor acting roles in 1992–1994 (including the music video for the Sonic Youth single \"100%\", a small part in Mi Vida Loca, and a bit part as a dance instructor on Chance and Things), Lee left professional skateboarding for a full-time acting career.[27] His first major film role was in Kevin Smith's Mallrats, which became a cult hit.[27][28] This started a friendship that subsequently led to appearances in many of Smith's films, including Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Clerks II, Cop Out, and Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. Lee won an Independent Spirit Award for his role in Chasing Amy as Banky Edwards.\n\nLee graduated to leading man roles in Heartbreakers, Stealing Harvard, and A Guy Thing.[29][30][31] He has had supporting roles in Vanilla Sky, Almost Famous, Dreamcatcher, Big Trouble, The Ballad of Jack and Rose, and Mumford, as well as a minor role in Enemy of the State. Lee also voiced Syndrome in The Incredibles and Jack-Jack Attack. He reprised the role as a \"robot copy\" of Syndrome in Disney Presents Pixar's The Incredibles in a Magic Kingdom Adventure.[32] Lee is also the voice of Underdog in Underdog and portrays Dave Seville in the live-action/CGI films starring Alvin and the Chipmunks.[33]\n\nIn 2005, Lee was offered the lead role in the television series My Name Is Earl.[34] According to interviews on the first-season DVD, he passed on the series twice before finally agreeing to read for the pilot. In the series he stars as Earl Hickey. Lee received two Golden Globe nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy in 2006 and 2007, as well as a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series in 2006.[35][36][37] NBC cancelled My Name is Earl after four seasons.[38]\n\nOn June 22, 2010, Memphis Beat premiered. Lee stars alongside Alfre Woodard[39] and portrays Dwight Hendricks.[39] In October 2011, it was announced the series was not renewed for a third season. He guest-starred in 2010 and 2013 episodes of Raising Hope, created by My Name is Earl creator and producer Greg Garcia.[40][41][42]\n\nAs of December 2011, Lee appeared in Up All Night,[43] but after its second season, it was officially cancelled on May 9, 2013. In June 2013, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip (2015), a fourth and final film in the Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise, was announced by 20th Century Fox; its release date was December 18, 2015.[44]\n\nLee is in the Amazon Studios 49-minute pilot of Cocked, where he plays the character of Grady Paxson, one of three men who run a family company, manufacturing guns. The show premiered on January 15, 2015, and also stars Brian Dennehy, Diora Baird, Dreama Walker, and Sam Trammell.[45] On January 25, 2015, The Hallmark Channel premiered Away & Back, a Hallmark Hall of Fame film starring Lee, Maggie Elizabeth Jones and Minka Kelly.[46]\n\nPhotography\n\n[edit]\n\nLee began shooting photos regularly in the early 2000s, and became interested in instant photography.[47] He released his first photo book through Refueled Magazine. It consists of \"184 pages of Polaroid & Fuji Instant Film photographs from 2006-2016\", printed in an edition of 500 copies.[48] In 2018 he published, A Plain View, a photo book consisting of color 4×5 photographs from his exploration of rural and urban America.[49] From June to December 2019, his photographs of Oklahoma were exhibited in exhibit OK: Jason Lee Photographs in Philbrook Museum of Art.[50] These works are scheduled to be released as the book OK in 2022.[51] In December 2020, British publishing house Stanley/Barker released In the Gold Dust Rush, consisting of black and white photographs of rural America.[52] In 2021, Lee released Galveston, commissioned by the Galveston Historical Foundation.[51] He is inspired by work of New Topographics movement, notably by Henry Wessell. He photographs on film.[53]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLee married actress and photographer Carmen Llywelyn in 1995. They divorced in 2001. Llywelyn later accused Lee of alcoholism and domestic abuse[54] and claimed that his commitment to Scientology was the principal cause for their separation.[55] Llywelyn wrote that their relationship collapsed when she revealed to her talent manager and fellow Scientologist, Gay Ribisi (mother of actor Giovanni Ribisi), that she had read A Piece of Blue Sky, a book about the reality of Scientology. Two days after her conversation with Ribisi, Llywelyn received a one-paragraph \"disconnection letter\" from Lee and was labeled a suppressive person.[56][57]\n\nFollowing his divorce from Llywelyn, Lee became engaged to actress Beth Riesgraf. Together, they have a son, Pilot Inspektor, born in 2003. Lee states their son's name was inspired by \"He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot.\" by rock band Grandaddy.[58]\n\nLee married Turkish model Ceren Alkaç in California in July 2008. A month later, Alkaç gave birth to a daughter named Casper.[58][59][60] The couple had their second child, a son named Sonny, in 2012.[61] Their third child, a daughter named Alberta 'Birdy' Lee, was born in 2017.[62]\n\nIn 2016, Lee revealed he is no longer a Scientologist.[63][64] When asked by The Guardian why he became a Scientologist he said, \"Everybody wants answers, everybody wants to feel less depressed or less anxious or they want to try to understand some issue that they might have with themselves.\" He added: \"Ultimately, it was just not for me. That's it. I wasn't really involved going back many, many years now.\"[65]\n\nLee currently resides in Los Angeles, California, with his family after living in Denton, Texas, for four years.[65] He is a 1/5th co-owner of the restaurant Barley and Board.[63][66]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1991 Video Days Himself Blind Skateboards 1993 A Visual Sound Stereo Skateboards Mi Vida Loca Teenage Drug Customer 1994 Chance and Things Dance Instructor on the Television 1995 Mallrats Brodie Bruce 1996 Drawing Flies Donner Tincan Folklore Himself Stereo Skateboards 1997 Chasing Amy Banky Edwards Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male A Better Place Dennis Pepper 1998 Kissing a Fool Jay Murphy American Cuisine Loren Collins Enemy of the State Daniel Zavitz 1999 Dogma Azrael Mumford Skip Skipperton 2000 Almost Famous Jeff Bebe Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Cast\n\nNominated – Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actor – Drama/Romance\n\nNominated – Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture 2001 Heartbreakers Jack Withrowe Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back Brodie Bruce /\n\nBanky Edwards Vanilla Sky Brian Shelby 2002 Big Trouble Puggy Stoked: The Rise and Fall of Gator Himself Documentary Stealing Harvard John Plummer 2003 A Guy Thing Paul Morse Dreamcatcher Beaver Clarendon I Love Your Work Larry Hortense 2004 Oh, What a Lovely Tea Party Himself Documentary Jersey Girl PR Exec #1 The Incredibles Buddy Pine / Syndrome Voice 2005 Jack-Jack Attack Voice, short film The Ballad of Jack and Rose Gray Drop Dead Sexy Frank 2006 Clerks II Lance Dowds Rising Son: The Legend of Christian Hosoi Himself Documentary Monster House Bones Voice 2007 Underdog Shoeshine / Underdog The Man Who Souled the World Himself Documentary Alvin and the Chipmunks David \"Dave\" Seville 2009 Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel 2010 Cop Out Roy 2011 Noah's Ark: The New Beginning Japheth Voice The Other Side Mortimer Flybait Columbus Circle Charlie Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked David \"Dave\" Seville 2014 Behaving Badly Father Krumins Tell Ray 2015 Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip David \"Dave\" Seville Nominated – Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor 2017 Growing Up Smith Butch Brunner 2019 Jay and Silent Bob Reboot Brodie Bruce 2020 We Bare Bears: The Movie Charlie Voice TBA Diamond Billy Curtis Also producer and writer\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1997 Weapons of Mass Distraction Phillip Messenger Television film 2005–2009 My Name Is Earl Earl Hickey Nominated – Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy (2006–2007)\n\nNominated – Satellite Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy (2005–2006)\n\nNominated – Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nNominated – Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series (2006–2007)\n\nNominated – Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actor – Comedy (2006) 2005 Saturday Night Live Host / various roles 1 episode 2006, 2016 American Dad!
