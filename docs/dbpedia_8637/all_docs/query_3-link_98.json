        "text": "For their latest music video, Mumford & Sons teamed up with the acclaimed British actor Idris Elba (The Wire, Prometheus). He directed and starred in the clip for \"Lover of the Light,\" from the band's latest release, Babel. The video follows Elba's character, a blind man, through his rigid morning routine, which he disrupts suddenly when he leaves his walking stick on a coathanger and bounds out into the world on his own. Elba's four senses take him on a wild journey through fields and woods and right towards the edge of a cliff – and set to Mumford & Sons' stirring song, the video is as poignant and triumphant as you'd expect."
