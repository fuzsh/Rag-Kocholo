It is set in a small town where a new psychologist (Loren Dean) gives offbeat advice to the neurotic residents. Both the psychologist and the town are named Mumford, a coincidence that eventually figures in the plot. The film co-stars Hope Davis, Jason Lee, Alfre Woodard, Mary McDonnell, Martin Short, David Paymer, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Ted Danson, and Zooey Deschanel in her film debut.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nDr. Mumford is a relative newcomer to the small Oregon town that bears his name, but his boundless enthusiasm for interacting with his neighbors and forging meaningful working relationships have enabled him to be readily accepted by the community. Over the course of just a few short months, word of Dr. Mumford and his skillful psychotherapy meets practice has quickly spread amongst the town's residents. His honest and open approach to mental health treatment has made him an attractive option to those seeking help, even if it means taking clients away from established therapists Ernest Delbanco and Phyllis Sheeler. Patients can be sure of receiving the utmost attention and care from the doctor, as he works hard to ensure that his therapies and approaches are tailored to the person's individual needs and are completely tailored to their own individual experiences. Dr. Mumford's presence in the town has been a positive one, giving hope and optimism to those facing anxiety and other issues, and helping to make the town a better place for all those living within it. Dr. Mumford is an invaluable asset to those looking for an experienced psychologist in the Oregon area.\n\nWith an expert understanding of psychology and a personable attitude, he is able to help people in diverse and meaningful ways. People trust him and value his assistance, whether it is traditional talk therapy, life coaching, or incorporating cognitive and behavioral strategies. All of these approaches are utilized in order to enable Dr. Mumford's clients to develop meaningful insight into their daily lives and experiences. As a result, he has become increasingly popular and sought after in the Oregon area. Whether it is to help with the effects of stress and anxiety, to learn manners in which to better cope with personal issues or to mount a long-term strategy for self-development, individuals will be aided by Dr. Mumford’s services. His knowledge, insight, and uniquely personalized attitude make him a highly sought after and respected psychologist in the Oregon region.\n\nDr. Mumford is an extraordinarily busy man. Although keeping up with the hectic schedule of running his full-time practice can be tiring, he loves his job. On any given day, his medical practice features a variety of cases and individuals, from Henry Follett who is obsessed with reading erotic novels to Althea Brockett who is trapped in an unhappy marriage along with her compulsive shopping habits, to Skip Skipperton, who recently joined from the offices of a computer mogul. Most recently, Lily and a harried cafe waitress and Sofie Crisp and a patient suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome, have added to the ever-growing list of patients Dr. Mumford is responsible for. Despite the constant hustle and bustle of patients and their ailments, Dr. Mumford never fails to help and provide them with the care and attention they need.\n\nDr. Mumford was determined to do whatever he could to help the trio of teens he had recently been entrusted to care for Skip, Lily, and Sofie. His experience in the field had taught him how important positive social interactions are for a person's recovery, so he decided to try something out of the ordinary act as a matchmaker between Skip and Lily. After a few unsuccessful attempts, he noticed the obvious chemistry between the two teens, and was pleased to have been able to help. However, this newfound task had also unintentionally revealed to him how attractive he found Sofie. He wasn't sure what to make of it, or how to deal with his conflicting emotions. On one side, there was his professional duty to his patients to make sure that Skip and Lily remain happy and healthy - and on the other, the new feelings he had developed for Sofie. Dr. Mumford had to find a way to reconcile his feelings, while still being a responsible doctor and doing what was best for his patients. It definitely wasn't an easy task, but the doctor was will to do whatever it took make sure that everyone was in good spirits.\n\nLionel, the attorney whom Dr. Mumford had previously refused as a patient due to his narcissism, teams up with his rival therapists in an attempt to ruin Mumford’s reputation. They set out to dig up any dark secrets or hidden skeletons from Mumford's past, in order to use them against him. Despite their malicious plot, Mumford's warmth and charm endear him to the rest of the townspeople, and it isn't long before his life becomes intertwined with the lives of the citizens. His openness and understanding draw people to him and soon he is seen as someone who can be trusted. Although Mumford has been placed in the middle of a conspiring rivalry, his positive qualities seem to be carrying him through.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nLoren Dean as Dr. Mumford\n\nHope Davis as Sofie Crisp\n\nJason Lee as Skip Skipperton\n\nAlfre Woodard as Lily Thompson\n\nMary McDonnell as Althea Brockett\n\nPruitt Taylor Vince as Henry Follett\n\nZooey Deschanel as Nessa Watkins\n\nMartin Short as Lionel Dillard\n\nDavid Paymer as Dr. Ernest Delbanco\n\nJane Adams as Dr. Phyllis Sheeler\n\nKevin Tighe and Dana Ivey as Mr. and Mrs. Crisp\n\nTed Danson as Jeremy Brockett\n\nJason Ritter as Martin Brockett\n\nElisabeth Moss as Katie Brockett\n\nRobert Stack as himself\n\nSimon Helberg as College Roommate\n\nThe film also includes future Dancing with the Stars contestant and winner Kelly Monaco in a small nonspeaking role.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nMumford was met with mixed reviews. Many critics expressed a general approval, but questioned the unpleasant back story (which contrasted with the overall tone of the film). The film has a 57% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 82 reviews, with an average rating of 5.92/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"Memorable moments are few and far between.\"[2] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[3]\n\nRoger Ebert gave a favorable review: \"There are no earth-shaking payoffs here. No dramatic astonishments, vile betrayals or sexual surprises. Just the careful and loving creation of some characters it is mostly a pleasure to meet. And at its deepest level, profoundly down there below the surface, it is something more, I think: an expression of Kasdan's humanist longings, his wish that people would listen better and value one another more. It is the strangest thing, how this movie sneaks up and makes you feel a little better about yourself.\"[4]\n\nThe film, based on a $28 million budget,[1] was a commercial failure, earning only $4,555,459 in the US.[5]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
