They must find a new home and they end up at Dave's house. The only thing that makes them different is that they can talk and even sing. Dave Seville (Jason Lee) is a struggling song writer who has a great idea about making the chipmunks a new show act, singing his songs. The only thing is that you must remember is that they are chipmunks and they act like chipmunks by tearing up Dave's house and interrupting his love life. However, they also begin to bond as a family with Dave becoming like a Dad. The chipmunks become a big hit and superstars with cute voices and fancy dance moves. The record company executive Ian (David Cross) sees big money in his future and takes over the act and pushes Dave to the side. Dave must try to save his little family before they becomes a show biz disaster. (My Comment) I enjoyed this movie because it brought back good memories. I can't believe that their first song was recorded 50 years ago. They have that certain sound that just makes you smile when you hear them. You recognize their sound immediately. The animated characters of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are lovable now as they were 50 years ago. I always liked it when Dave would scream the name of \"Aaaaalviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnn!!!\" and Alvin would say \"OooooK!!!\" Those two words just make you smile. Children of all ages can see this movie without any problem. I am sure that all the parents will like it, and I know your child will, because it is a fun movie.

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry's \"The Trouble with Harry\" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), \"Armen's Theme\" and \"Gotta Get to Your House.\" In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit \"Witch Doctor\" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single \"The Chipmunk Song\" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. \"Alvin's Harmonica\" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of \"The Chipmunk Song\" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early '60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964. Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the '60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn't enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the '90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998's A-Files: Alien Files. In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009's Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011's Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015's Alvin and the Chipmunks 4. A revival of the TV series was also planned to premiere on Nickelodeon in early 2015. ~ John Bush, Rovi Related Artists\n\n{ \"last_modified_datetime\": \"2024-02-04T17:15:47.217000\" }\n\ntc_2_9\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel – EW.com Comedy, Kids and Family We gave it a C- If only for the sake of adults, couldn’t the folks behind the Alvin films have had the good grace to turn Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel into a musical? Like the original big-screen Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007), this new one is a slapstick pacifier, the kind of movie that features gags like Simon getting three-point-shotted into a wastebasket by an angry jock. Yes, griping about intentionally stupid jokes in an intentionally silly sequel seems like a churlish and rather pointless thing to do. Yet when Alvin, Simon, and Theodore take the stage to perform a number like “You Really Got Me” (sounding more like a pip-squeak Van Halen than the Kinks), or when they twirl around on top of a blender and toss off a smokin’ a cappella version of “You Spin Me Round (Like a Record),” it’s funky, charming, and — yes — irresistible. In the age of Glee and American Idol, when even little kids groove on the pop of different eras, the songs in Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel are natural-born showstoppers. The trouble is, there are only three or four of them in the whole movie. My hopes were raised with the appearance of the Chipettes, a trio of Bambi-lashed female chipmunks who mail themselves to L.A. in a FedEx packet and sign a contract with Ian Hawk (David Cross), the evil agent-promoter from the first film. But they get to do exactly one song (it’s a goodie, “Single Ladies”). Mostly, we’re stuck with a lame plastic plot that has Alvin and his boys going to high school, plus Zachary Levi (from NBC’s Chuck, essentially taking over for Jason Lee, who makes only a token appearance) doing sub-Adam Sandler routines as the chipmunks’ caretaker. Will kids eat up this cutely fractious claptrap? Of course they will. They’ll eat up whatever you put in front of them. But that doesn’t make The Squeakquel good for them.

He is the leader of the group as well as the self-proclaimed \"awesomest\" one. Alvin greatly relishes his role as band front man and his antics and ego regularly get him and his brothers (sometimes even Dave ) into trouble. Contents Biography 60s Series Alvin, the shortest of the Chipmunk brothers, is always scheming, whether it be because he wants to get out of chores ( Overworked Alvin ) or is just trying to find a place to relax ( Alvin's Cruise ). Alvin has much musical talent; he not only sings, but also plays the harmonica. He loves his harmonica and will play it any time he can, even if it ends up messing up the song (\" Alvin's Harmonica \"). Alvin has trouble grasping other languages or their cultures but enjoys traveling the world anyway (\" I Wish I Could Speak French \", \" Comin' Thru' the Rye \"). He can be lazy when it comes to working, but he is very imaginative ( Sir Alvin ). He doesn't take lightly to people insulting him and his brothers' music ( Squares ), and sometimes even resorts to violence when dealing with people he dislikes (Daisy Bell in \"Three Blind Mice\"). He will also manipulate people when his fame is at stake ( Disc Jockey ). At times the selfish side of Alvin can take over, but, in the end, he always returns to help his brothers and Dave ( Alvin's Alter-Ego ). Alvin's interest in girls isn't as strong as in later incarnations, but he definitely is a charmer (\" August Dear \"). 80s Series Alvin is the oldest, as revealed in the episode Grounded Chipmunk after making the statement, \"I've never been alone, except those five minutes before Simon was born.\" Alvin is charming, musical (able to play guitar, piano, and harmonica, among many others), and full of animal magnetism. He always seems to make up hare-brained schemes to accomplish whatever his goal at the time is; whether it be trying to help his brothers, keeping Dave from figuring something out, or getting out of a sticky situation. However, Simon seems to refer to his often illogical or crazy plans as challenging the ordinary. Alvin has always possessed an impulsive behavior which has, at times, irritated or angered others around him, most obviously Dave. At times Alvin's determination can be viewed as being thoughtless, greedy, or manipulative. As a result of his constant habit of reacting to opportunity, Alvin has gotten his brothers or himself in trouble quite a few times such as the balloon race in The Chipmunk Adventure and a large number of episodes. Although Alvin is very much self-centered, he does care about his brothers. In Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman, Alvin helped Theodore temporarily get a bully off his case, causing the principal to remark, \"I'll say this for Alvin: he sticks up for his little brother.\" Alvin is an emotional roller coaster: his enthusiasm endless and despair bottomless. Alvin is often shown to be quite self-absorbed and greedy, but is also seen to be selfless and giving such as when he gives away his harmonica, one of his most prized possessions, to a child with a terminal illness in A Chipmunk Christmas . In A Chipmunk Reunion , Alvin has a difficult time forgiving his mother for leaving them until the end. Alvin is commonly portrayed as the charming member of the trio. In the Dr. Simon and Mr. Heartthrob episode, he dresses stylishly and attempts to attract a group of visiting girls before being usurped by Simon, who drank a special kind of elixir which granted him natural magnetism and charm. CGI Films Alvin retains some of the traits he possessed from the 80s such as his impulsiveness, desire for fun, and charm as seen in Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel where he manages to capture the attention of a group of girls using his cute looks and as well as the French language (e.g. he called Becca Mademoiselle after kissing her finger). Nevertheless, he has difficulty at showing affection toward Dave such as in the first film, Alvin and the Chipmunks, where he struggles at telling Dave that he loves him as a father, but less so with his brothers such as the time Alvin tried to kiss Simon to cheer him up in the second film. CGI Series Alvin contains much of his traditional personality: charming, impulsive, and self-centered. He continues to flirt with women such as the principal ( Principal Interest ) or have crushes on famous individuals ( Mister Manners ). Though he acts in his self-interest, he recognizes when his schemes go too far and does what's necessary to make up to the one he hurt ( To Serve And Protect ). He's still protective of his brothers ( Bully For You ) and has familiar emotional attachment at times ( Warbie ). Alvin retains his sporty lifestyle of the 80s, frequently seen on his skateboard ( What A Gem ), though tends to go too far when others are concerned ( Mutiny ). Appearance Alvin's signature appearance has changed over the years. Before The Alvin Show, Alvin looked like a normal chipmunk somewhat similar to his CGI films appearance. Alvin wears just a red shirt with the letter 'A'. After The Alvin Show was created Alvin was given more human features. His red shirt with his signature yellow 'A' is lengthen to go down to his new black shoes. Alvin was also given a red baseball cap and is the shortest of his brothers. In Chipmunk Punk , Alvin wears clothes similar to The Alvin Show with the red sweater and matching hat but now wears white and dark blue shoes, since the album was released Alvin has a box cut instead of his regular hair as to match the visual style of the cover. When the Alvin and the Chipmunks series was created, Alvin wore a red sweater with his signature yellow 'A' and a baseball cap. He also wore white and blue pattern shoes. In the early episodes, Alvin's eye color is black but as the series progressed, his eye color changed to blue. In some episodes, Alvin wears light red footie pajamas with an 'A' on it, while in others, he wears a red t-shirt with a yellow 'A' on it along with red pajama pants. In the CGI/live-action films, Alvin only wears a red hoodie with a yellow 'A' on it. His appearance was modified to look more closely to a real life chipmunk and has brown eyes. In the 2007 Alvin and the Chipmunks, Alvin is only seen wearing his cap twice; the first time on a magazine cover and the second at the end of the movie. In ALVINNN!!! and The Chipmunks , he wears a red and blue-hooded sweater with his signature yellow \"A\" on it, which also has a hole in the left sleeve (right in the promotional images), blue jeans, and red/orange/white converse shoes. Alvin regains his signature red baseball cap as a common accessory, but it now has green under the visor and orange on the top-visor. He also has light orange-brownish fur. Relationships Dave The relationship between Alvin and Dave is frustrating for the two of them at times. Frequently Alvin won't cooperate which makes Dave scream his signature catchphrase \"ALLLVIIINNNN!!!!\", to which Alvin replies with a loud \"OKAY!!\" Although they can both irritate each other, they really love and care for each other. Simon Although the two of them are brothers, Alvin and Simon argue a lot of times because of their differences. In The Alvin Show, Alvin and Simon didn't fight too much or have a developing relationship until in the 1980's series. Alvin and Simon have a large bonding relationship in Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman while trying to find a cure for Theodore. It is obvious Alvin cares for Simon because in Bully For You , he wanted to help save Simon from Derek , the school bully. Theodore Alvin's relationship with Theodore can sometimes be hard for Theodore. Sometimes Alvin enjoys playing pranks and teasing Theodore, which usually upsets Theodore, sometimes Alvin doesn't realize that he would hurt Theodore's feelings. Although Alvin enjoys pranking Theodore, he cares and stands up for him because in Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman , he saved Theodore from Nathan , the school bully. Alvin: Are you in, or...in? - ( Meet the Wolfman ) Alvin: That's it! I can't take this anymore. I can't! I give up!

This has been written by aliens. - ( Un-Send! ) Trivia The origin of his name comes from Alvin Bennett . [1] Over the years, he had crushes (or interests) on many human female characters. Some examples include Miss Fancy from the 60s episode Fancy , Sandy the Babysitter and his math teacher Miss Stone from the 80s series episode Romancing Miss Stone , Dena from Funny, We Shrunk the Adults , Becca in The Squeakquel , and The Principal from the ALVINNN!!! series. Even though Alvin is the oldest by five minutes (as stated in the 80s episode Grounded Chipmunk ), many fans believe that he is younger than Simon since Simon is taller and more mentally mature. Alvin's age is unknown in the CGI/live-action films. Alvin refers to himself as the \"middle child\" in the ALVINNN!!! series episode The Sub . In the CGI/live-action films, Alvin has only worn his baseball cap in the 2007 movie (in a magazine and at the end). In the CGI/live-action films, Alvin is also depicted as having the ability to speak basic French unlike in both the 1980's animated series and The Alvin Show in which he is shown to be unable to speak French in \"Petit Papa Noel\" from A Very Merry Chipmunk , and he is shown to wish he could speak French in The Alvin Show musical segment \" I Wish I Could Speak French .\" According to Romancing Miss Stone, Alvin says that his birthday is nearby and he is turning nine years old (along with his brothers). However, later on in the series, they are stated to be eight years old several times. Alvin's attire has changed many times throughout the franchise with him wearing the most clothes in the new CGI series and him wearing the least amount of clothes in the live action/CGI films. During the 2000-era, Alvin was, and is, known as the self-appointed \"leader\" of the group. And, presumably meaning The Alvin Show , he suffered from small \"munk\" complex and tried to make up for it with his grand schemes and animal magnetism. In the CGI/live-action films, Alvin is shown to have great hands when catching: in The Squeakquel (when he joins the football team and makes a game-winning touchdown catch), Chipwrecked (he catches a pocket knife with one hand in mid-air), and The Road Chip (he catches a ring with one hand in mid-air, with a fully-extended body).

For other specials with the same title, see A Christmas Story (disambiguation) . A Christmas Story is a 1983 American/Canadian comedy film based on the short stories and semi-fictional anecdotes of author and raconteur Jean Shepherd , including material from his books In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash and Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories. Directed by Bob Clark, the film has since become a holiday classic and is known for being shown numerous times on television during the Christmas season. In 2012, the Library of Congress recognized the film and was chosen for preservation into its National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\" [1] Contents Synopsis SPOILER: Plot details or story follow. The film is set in the fictional city of Hohman (based on real-life city of Hammond, Indiana). 9-year-old Ralph \"Ralphie\" Parker wants only one thing for Christmas: \"an official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model air rifle with a compass in the stock, and this thing which tells time.\" Between run-ins with his younger brother Randy and having to handle school bully Scut Farkus, and his sidekick Grover Dill, Ralphie does not know how he will ever survive long enough to get the BB gun for Christmas. Ralphie Parker, the film's protagonist. The plot revolves around Ralphie's overcoming a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to his owning the precious Red Ryder BB gun: the fear that he will shoot his eye out (the classic BB gun mother's block, \"You'll shoot your eye out.\") In each of the film's three acts, Ralphie makes his case to another individual; each time he is met by the same retort. When Ralphie asks his mother for a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas, she says, \"No, you'll shoot your eye out.\" Next, when Ralphie writes a theme about wanting the BB gun for Mrs. Shields, his teacher at Warren G. Harding Elementary School, Ralphie gets a C+, and Mrs. Shields writes \"P.S. You'll shoot your eye out\" on it. Finally, when Ralphie asks an obnoxious department store Santa Claus for a Red Ryder BB gun, he responds, \"You'll shoot your eye out, kid. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho!\", before pushing Ralphie down a long slide with his boot. One day after he gets the C+ on his composition, Ralphie is struck in the face with a snowball thrown at him by the bully Scut Farkus who then begins to tease and taunt Ralphie. Ralphie finally reaches his breaking point and then charges at Farkus knocking him down, and after knocking down Grover Dill, who tries to intervene for his pal, proceeds to beat Scut's face bloody. During the fight, Ralphie begins to swear non-stop as he lands blow after blow to the squealing Farkus. Ralphie's mother shows up and pulls her son off the bully, and takes him home. This part of the film occurs shortly after a scene where Ralphie gets into trouble for swearing while helping his father fix a flat tire. Ralphie is worried about the swearing and is sure he will be in big trouble when his father gets home from work. Instead, Ralphie's mother tells his father about the fight casually at the dinner table. She then changes the subject of the conversation to an upcoming Chicago Bears game, distracting his father and getting Ralphie off the hook in the process. On Christmas morning, Ralphie looks frantically for a box that would hold the BB gun to no avail. He and his brother have quite a few presents, but he is disappointed because he did not get the gun. His disappointment turns to joy as his father points out one last half-hidden present, ostensibly from Santa. As Ralphie unwraps the BB gun, Mr. Parker explains the purchase to his none-too-thrilled wife, stating that he had one himself when he was 8 years old. Ralphie goes out to test his new gun, shooting at a paper target perched on top of a metal sign, and predictably gets a ricochet from the metal sign. This ricochet ends up hitting just below his eye, which causes him to flinch and lose his glasses. While searching for the glasses, Ralphie ends up stepping on them, breaking them. However, he concocts a story to his mother about an icicle falling on him and breaking his glasses, which she believes. Suddenly, a horde of the next door neighbor's dogs, which frequently bother Ralphie's father, manages to get into the house, trash the kitchen and eat the turkey that was prepared for that evening's meal. Making a last-minute decision, Ralphie's father takes everyone out to a Chinese restaurant where they have a hilarious time eating what the narrator calls \"Chinese Turkey\" (in reality, Peking Duck, cooked complete with the head). At the end of the story, we see Ralphie lying in bed on Christmas night with his gun by his side. Randy is holding the toy zeppelin he received. The voiceover states that this was the best present he received or would ever receive. Subplots Several subplots are incorporated in the body of the film, based on other separate short stories by Shepherd. The most notable involves the Old Man winning a \"major award.\" He entered a trivia contest out of the newspaper, which asked for the name of The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse (thanks to his wife, who supplied the answer: Victor). A large crate arrived and inside was a lamp shaped like a woman's leg wearing fishnet stockings, much to Mrs. Parker's displeasure. Just two days later, Mrs. Parker broke the lamp, infuriating the Old Man. The leg was the logo of the contest's sponsor, the Nehi bottling company (the details of the contest were not necessarily made clear in the movie). Other vignettes include: Ralphie's friends Flick and Schwartz disputing over whether a person's tongue will stick to a frozen flagpole. Schwartz ultimately issues Flick a \"triple dog dare\" (the most serious of those used by the kids), and Flick's tongue gets stuck to the pole, much to his terror. A suction tube within the flagpole was used to simulate the freezing of Flick's tongue to the pole. Ralphie receiving his Secret Society decoder pin from the Little Orphan Annie radio show. After weeks of anxious waiting, and missing out on the daily \"secret message\" (which to a kid appeared very important) Ralphie finally is able to participate. *However, he learns a lesson in being ripped off, as the secret message turned out to be an Ovaltine radio commercial. Ralphie and his friends dealing with the neighborhood bully, Scotty Farkus (Zack Ward). The Old Man's legendary battles with the aging and malfunctioning furnace. Ralphie letting slip the dreaded \"Queen Mother of Dirty Words\", the \"F-dash-dash-dash word\" (censored with the word \"Fudge\" after his father knocks a hubcap from his hands, spilling its contents, the lug nuts from a flat tire) and later, when asked where he'd heard the bad word, falsely blaming his friend, Schwartz, and not pointing out that his father utters the word daily. After Ralphie's mother telephones Schwartz's mother to inform her that her son had been responsible for passing along the bad word to Ralphie, we hear Schwartz getting what appears to be the thrashing of his life at the hands of his hysterical mother. Ralphie himself gets a bar of soap in the mouth for saying the word. To keep it censored, Billingsly says \"fudge\" on camera (the narration points out that he really didn't say \"fudge\"). The numerous smelly and bothersome bloodhounds of the next door neighbors, the Bumpuses, including the dogs destroying the Christmas turkey (prompting the family to go out and have Peking duck instead, resulting in a giggling fit by the mother and the boys). Several fantasy sequences depict Ralphie's daydreams of glory and vindication, including the vanquishing of a small army of villains dressed in stereotypical burglar costume of flat caps, black masks and striped shirts with his Red Ryder BB gun obtaining his parents' gratitude, an extremely good grade for his written theme about the BB gun, and parental remorse over a case of \"soap poisoning\" (related to his cursing). Mrs. Parker's misadventures in overly bundling Randy up for the winter weather by wrapping him in sweaters and a jacket so tightly he is unable to put his arms down, then Randy getting inadvertently knocked down and unable to get up under his own power (his only defense when they are confronted by Scotty Farkus.) Randy's refusal to eat a meal on his own incites hilarity between him and his mother at the dinner table. Spoilers end here. Drew Hocevar One of the Two Christmas Elves In the DVD commentary, director Bob Clark mentions that Jack Nicholson was considered for the role of the Old Man; Clark expresses gratitude that he ended up with Darren McGavin instead, who also appeared in several other Clark films. He cast Melinda Dillon on the basis of her similar role in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Peter Billingsley was already a minor star from co-hosting the TV series Real People; Clark initially wanted him for the role of Ralphie, but decided he was \"too obvious\" a choice and auditioned many other young actors before realizing that Billingsley was the right one after all. Ian Petrella was cast immediately before filming began. Tedde Moore had previously appeared in Clark's film Murder by Decree, and Jeff Gillen was an old friend of Clark's who had been in one of his earliest films. Shepherd provides the movie's narration from the perspective of an adult Ralphie, a narrative style later used in the dramedy The Wonder Years . The film's writers, Jean Shepherd and Bob Clark. have cameo appearances in the film; Shepherd plays the man who directed Ralphie and Randy to the back of the Santa line, and Clark plays Swede, the neighbor the Old Man was talking to outside during the Leg Lamp scene. History and related works Origin Three of the semi-autobiographical short stories on which the film is based were originally published in Playboy magazine between 1964 and 1966. Shepherd later read \"Duel in the Snow, or Red Ryder nails the Cleveland Street Kid\" and told the otherwise unpublished story \"Flick's Tongue\" on his WOR Radio talk show, as can be heard in one of the DVD extras. Bob Clark states on the DVD commentary that he became interested in Shepherd's work when he heard \"Flick's Tongue\" on the radio in 1968. Additional source material for the film, according to Clark, came from unpublished anecdotes Shepherd told live audiences \"on the college circuit.\" Critical reception Initially overlooked as a sleeper film, A Christmas Story was released a week before Thanksgiving 1983 to moderate success, earning about $2 million in its first weekend. Critics were severely divided on the film, with the majority of reviews on the negative side. Leonard Maltin proclaimed it a \"Top screen comedy,\" while Roger Ebert proclaimed it \"Funny and satirical ... a sort of Norman Rockwell crossed with MAD magazine. Vincent Canby's mostly negative New York Times review echoed the more common response. Critics seemed focused on the fact that Bob Clark, director of the critically reviled Porky's was the man behind the camera, and could not grasp the concept of Clark coming up with an instant classic like A Christmas Story The film would go on to win two Genie Awards, for Bob Clark's screenplay and direction. Years later, Ebert would re-evaluate the film, this time more favorably, writing that \"some of the movie sequences stand as classic.\" By Christmas 1983, the film was no longer playing at most venues, but remained in about a hundred theaters until January 1984. Gross earnings were just over $19.2 million. In the years since, due to television airings and home video release, A Christmas Story has become widely popular and is now a perennial Christmas special. Originally released by MGM, Warner Bros. (through Turner Entertainment Co.) now has ownership of the film due to Ted Turner's purchase of MGM's pre-1986 library and Time Warner's subsequent purchase of Turner Entertainment. Television A Christmas Story first aired on television on HBO during the mid-eighties and quickly attracted a growing following. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the film began airing quietly on then-SuperStation WTBS and WGN America (then known as Superstation WGN). From 1988 to 1992, the film had a short-lived tradition of airing on the American Thanksgiving night (or the night after Thanksgiving) to open the holiday television season. In 1988, then-fledgling FOX network aired the movie the night after Thanksgiving. In 1989 and 1990, TBS showed it on Thanksgiving night, and in 1991 and 1992, they aired it the night after. Turner, now a part of Time Warner 's umbrella of cable networks, has maintained ownership of the broadcast rights, and since the mid-1990s, airing the movie increasingly on TBS, TNT and TCM . By 1995, it was aired on those networks a combined six times over December 24-25-26, and in 1996, it was aired eight times over those three days. Due to the increasing popularity of the film, in 1997, TNT began airing a 24-hour marathon dubbed \"24 Hours of A Christmas Story,\" consisting of the film shown twelve consecutive times beginning at 7 or 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve and ending Christmas Day. This was in addition to various other airings earlier in the month of December. In 2004, after TNT switched to a predominantly drama format, sister network TBS, under its comedy-based \"Very Funny\" moniker, took over the broadcast rights for the marathon. Clark stated that in 2002, an estimated 38.4 million people tuned into the marathon at one point or another, nearly one sixth of the country. TBS reported 45.4 million viewers in 2005, and 45.5 million in 2006. In 2007, new all-time ratings records were set, with the highest single showing (8 p.m. Christmas Eve) drawing 4.4 million viewers. Viewership increased again in 2008, with 8 p.m. Christmas Eve drawing 4.5 million viewers, and 10 p.m. drawing 4.3 million. In 2007, the original tradition was revived as TNT aired A Christmas Story twice the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend (November 25). In 2011, the 24-hour marathon is scheduled to continue on TBS, for the 15th overall year, starting at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT on Christmas Eve. Home video releases Settings Locations The movie is set in a fictional town in Indiana, strongly resembling Hammond, Indiana where writer Jean Shepherd grew up. Local references in the film include Warren G. Harding Elementary School, and Cleveland Street (where Shepherd spent his childhood years). Other Indiana references in the dialogue include a mention of a person \"swallowing a yo-yo\" in nearby Griffith, Indiana, the Old Man being one of the fiercest \"furnace fighters in northern Indiana\" and that his obscenities were \"hanging in space over Lake Michigan,\" a mention of the Indianapolis 500, and the line to Santa Claus \"stretching all the way to Terre Haute.\" The Old Man is also revealed to be a fan of the Bears (who he jokingly calls the \"Chicago Chipmunks\") and White Sox, consistent with living in northwest Indiana. The school scenes were shot at the Victoria School in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. The school was sold to developers in 2005 and has been remodeled into a women's shelter. The Christmas tree purchasing scene was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, as it was the only location that still used red PCC streetcars - in fact, TTC streetcars can be seen during the scene. Ralphie beating up the neighborhood bully was also filmed in Toronto, as was the soundstage filming of interior shots of the Parker home. The St. Catharines' Museum owns some props used in the film, including two pairs of Ralphie's glasses (one of which is the smashed pair), and two scripts. Director Bob Clark reportedly sent location scouts to twenty cities before selecting Cleveland, Ohio, as the principal site for filming. Higbee's department store in downtown Cleveland was the stage for three scenes in A Christmas Story. The first is the opening scene in which Ralphie first spies the Red Ryder BB Gun. The second is the parade scene, filmed just outside Higbee's, on Public Square, at 3 AM. The final scene is Ralphie and Randy’s visit to see Santa which was filmed inside Higbee's. Higbee's kept the Santa slide that was made for the movie and used it for several years after the movie’s release. Higbee's was known for decades as a cornerstone of Public Square, as well as for its elaborate child-centered Christmas themes and decorations (e.g. the Twigbee Shop), with Santa as the centerpiece, until the store, which became Dillard's in 1992, closed for good in 2002. Higbee's was exclusive to Northeast Ohio—there were no Higbee's stores in Shepherd's hometown. As such, he was most likely referring to Goldblatts in downtown Hammond (with the Cam-Lan Chinese Restaurant three doors down on Sibley Ave.) The parade was filmed at night for one reason. The producers wanted to film during day, but at this time, the BP Tower was under construction and during the daytime you could see the 1960s Erieview Tower and Federal Building from the Public Square. The exterior shots (and select interior shots, including the opening of the leg lamp) of the house and neighborhood where Ralphie lived were filmed in the Tremont section of Cleveland's West Side. The house used as the Parker home in these scenes has been restored, reconfigured inside to match the soundstage interiors, and opened to the public as A Christmas Story House . The \"...only I didn't say fudge\" scene was filmed at the foot of Cherry Street in Toronto. In 2008, two fans from Canada released a fan film documentary that visits every location used in the movie. Their film, Road Trip for Ralphie, was shot over two years and includes footage of the film makers saving Miss Shields's black board from the dumpster on the day the old Victoria School was gutted for renovation, discovering the antique fire truck that saved Flick, locating all the original costumes from the movie and tracking down the real-life location of the movie's Chop Suey Palace in Toronto. Many years after the film was shot one of the old schools used in St. Catharines was demolished. During demolition, one of the movie scripts was found in the bleachers. It had scribbling on it from the directors. Vehicles Cleveland car buffs donated the use of a number of vintage vehicles for the film, which helped to enhance the authenticity of the production despite a limited budget. During filming in downtown Cleveland, members of a local antique automobile club, following a preset route, repeatedly circled the square. At the end of filming each day, the cars were thoroughly washed to remove road salt, and parked underground beneath the Terminal Tower. The Parker family car was a 1937 Oldsmobile Model F-37 four-door trunkback sedan. It is made clear early on the Old Man's bittersweet relationship with his car, as revealed in the lines: \"Some men are Baptist, others Catholic; my father was an Oldsmobile man;\" \"That hot damn Olds has froze up again;\" \"That [SOB] would freeze up in the middle of summer on the equator!\". Transit fans will notice several Toronto pcc streetcars in a couple scenes. Ralphie's Red Ryder BB Gun The Red Ryder BB gun was available beginning in 1938 and for many years afterward (and indeed, still is), but never in the exact configuration mentioned in the film. The Daisy \"Buck Jones\" model did have a compass and a sundial in the stock, but these features were not included in the Red Ryder model. The compass and sundial were placed on Ralphie's BB gun but on the opposite side of the stock due to Billingsly being left-handed. Tributes and parodies In a segment produced for A Very Cartoon Cartoon Fridays Holiday Special , Dexter dares Johnny Bravo to stick his tongue on the TV monitors behind them, because Johnny thinks his tongue will not stick to them. In another segment of the broadcast, Chicken complains that he did not get the BB gun that he wanted, to which everyone replies, \"You'll shoot your eye out!\" At the beginning of The Powerpuff Girls Christmas special, 'Twas the Fight Before Christmas , Buttercup worries that she will not get an official Red Raider carbine-action two-hundred-shot range-model air rifle. Princess Morbucks responds, \"Who would want a stupid old BB gun? Besides, you'll shoot your eye out.\" In the Back at the Barnyard Christmas episode, It's an Udderful Life , Eugene \"Snotty Boy\" Beadie wants a Red Ryder Reindeer Tazer as his Christmas gift. Ralphie and the kid with goggles make a cameo in Grace Goodwin 's flashback in Prep & Landing: Naughty vs. Nice . Dating the story Director Bob Clark stated in the film's commentary CD that he and author Shepherd wished for the movie to be seen as \"amorphously late 30's, early 40's.\" The film is not specifically about a given year, it is about a particular time in American family life. The film appears to be set roughly around the tail end of the Great Depression but before the United States involvement in World War II. There are references throughout the film that viewers enjoy linking to particular years, and if one connects a reference to a particular year, the movie can be \"dated\" as being as early as 1935 or as late as 1947. Some of the other \"year clues\" include - but are by no means limited to - the following: 1935: In the scene where Ralphie and his friends peer into the Higbee's toy store window, Lionel's model of the Union Pacific M-10000 can be seen running around a loop of track. That model was made from 1935-1941. Pre-1937: The tin Zeppelin mentioned in the original story (\"it rolls and it beeps\"), and appearing unremarked under the Christmas tree. Zeppelin travel ended for all intents and purposes with the Hindenburg disaster on May 6, 1937. 1937: Reference in the newspaper quiz to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , released by Disney that year. Snow White can also be seen in the Higbee's window. The Parker family car. 1938: The color comics on Christmas Day - implying a Sunday. Christmas fell on a Sunday in 1938. 1939: Characters from The Wizard of Oz , released that year, appear in the Christmas parade. 1940: The license plates on the cars are silver (white) on a black field. Those were the colors of the Indiana license plates that year. Each year, Ovaltine brought out a different model for this decoder ring. The Radio Orphan Annie secret decoder model used in the movie is the 1940 model. The Red Ryder Daisy BB gun with \"Golden Bands\" was offered only in the first year of its manufacture. Christmas 1940 would be accurate for the Goden Band model. Scenes in the movie clearly show the rifle had golden bands. Additionally the 1940 Daisy pre-Christmas ads shown in the movie feature the gold banded rifle. In short the Red Ryder Daisy with \"gold bands\" ties the movie to Christmas 1940. 1943: The Bing Crosby/Andrews Sisters recordings of \"Jingle Bells\" and \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\" are both very clearly heard on the living room radio (both recorded on September 27, 1943). 1946: Ralphie's father complains in the movie that \"the Sox traded Bullfrog!\" which is a reference to Chicago White Sox pitcher Bill Dietrich, who was in fact released from the Sox, not traded, in 1946. 1947: The police car in the schoolyard scene. Many other \"year specific\" references can be found in the film, as 1939-40 is slightly later than author Jean Shepherd's own childhood (he was 19 years old in 1940) but earlier than that of director Bob Clark (who was born in 1939). While Shepherd was age 10 in 1931, Clark was age 10 in 1949 - a separation of 18 years. If the consensus between Shepherd and Clark was to find a \"middle-ground\" for their youths, they may well have divided the difference in half (9), then added that amount of years to the earliest date (1931), thereby arriving at 1940. These minor contradictory items only indicate what director Bob Clark said in his commentary, as previously stated above: The film is set in the \"amorphously later Thirties, early Forties.\" The movie is intended as a credible, warm and thoroughly inviting memory of an innocent American Christmas around the World War II era. The individual viewer can elect to \"date\" the film to any year they wish, but for whatever year they choose, many contradictions occur within the film, and this fits exactly with the writer and directors idea of \"around 1940\". Sequel In 1994, a sequel with the same characters, but none of the same cast, was released. Titled It Runs In The Family (or My Summer Story), it told some further adventures of Ralphie and his family. While available on DVD, both it and its connection to the holiday classic are nearly unknown. A more direct sequel, a direct-to-video film titled A Christmas Story 2 , was released by Warner Bros. on October 30, 2012. Soundtrack Ralphie's Revenge & the \"F\" Word Joy To the World & Silent Night The Bumpus Hounds Make Their Rounds Glorious, Beautiful Christmas (closing credits music) Silent Night - Mormon Tabernacle Choir A Christmas Story House Home Hunting The house that was used as the Parker residence is located in Cleveland, Ohio For the film adaptation of these stories, Bob Clark chose Cleveland, Ohio because of Higbee's Department Store. Scouts had been unsuccessful in finding a department store that was willing to be part of the film. Higbee's vice president Bruce Campbell agreed to take on the project on the condition he be allowed to edit the script for cursing (namely \"the Queen Mother of Dirty Words\"). Appropriately, the fictional boyhood home of Ralphie Parker is on Cleveland Street, the name of the actual street where Shepherd grew up. In addition to the house exteriors, Cleveland was the location used for the scenes involving Higbee's department store, despite the fact that there were no Higbee's stores in Shepherd's hometown. Restoration and reconfiguration In December 2004, Brian Jones, a San Diego entrepreneur and fan of the film since childhood, bought the house used by the producers as the Parker home on eBay for $150,000. Jones used revenue from his business, The Red Rider Leg Lamp Company, which manufactures replicas of the \"major award\" Ralphie's father won in the film, for the down payment. The previous owners had reconfigured installing modern windows, and covered the original wood siding with blue vinyl. Watching the movie frame by frame, Jones drew detailed plans of the interiors — which had been filmed on a Toronto sound stage — and spent US $ 240,000 to gut the structure, reconfigure it to a single-family dwelling, transform it into a near-replica of the movie set, and restore the exterior to its appearance in the film. A Christmas Story House Museum Jones purchased the house across the street and converted it into A Christmas Story House Museum, which contains some of the props from the movie, including Randy's snow suit, the Higbee's window toys, and hundreds of behind the scenes photos. The house to the left of the museum features a gift shop with movie memorabilia, which opened to the public on November 25, 2006, with original cast members attending the grand opening, and the site drew 4,300 visitors during its first weekend. Related promotions According to their official web site , the official Christmas Story Chinese Restaurant is \"The Pearl of the Orient.\" The Renaissance Cleveland Hotel offers a package deal for two that includes overnight accommodations and tickets to the House. As a bonus, the film is aired in the room 24 hours a day. Patty LaFountaine-Johnson, a local actress who portrayed one of the Higbee Santa's elves, hand-sews and autographs red-and-green felt hats similar to her movie costume and sells them at the house's gift shop. Broadway musical In 2012, a musical version of the holiday classic, co-executive produced by Peter Billingsley, ran during the holiday season at the Lunt-Fontaine Theatre. The show was revived at The Theatre at Madison Square Garden for 2013.\n\n{ \"last_modified_datetime\": \"2024-02-04T17:15:47.217000\" }\n\ntc_2_22\n\nChip and Dale | Disney Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia [Source] Chip and Dale are a pair of cunning and mischievous chipmunks. Although the duo have similar looks and rarely appear separately, they each have distinct personalities and a few distinguishing physical features. Chip can be identified by his small black \"chocolate chip\" nose and a single front tooth, whereas Dale has a larger nose which is red and two adjacent front teeth. Chip is also usually the more logical, positive, and cunning of the two, with Dale being the less intelligent. Contents Background Personalities Chip is the brains of the duo and thus is shown to be clever, fearless and somewhat bossy. Unlike his best friend, he's a quick thinker. When dealing with Donald, Chip shows to be much more of a threat than Dale, both mentally and physically. He is also no-nonsense and becomes easily frustrated with Dale's incompetence. In Rescue Rangers, Chip constantly thinks about being on duty to the point where he is thought to not know how to be fun; because of such, Dale's blundering causes him nothing but headaches. Dale is sometimes lazy, dim-witted and clumsy, and can be a little more sensitive. In earlier appearances, he was completely foolish to the point where he can truly be called an idiot. In later years, that aspect of his personality was toned down to just being carefree, fun-loving, and goofy. In Rescue Rangers, Dale wears a Hawaiian shirt, possibly to show how relaxed his personality is; he gets along easier with Monterey Jack and Zipper than Chip. While the two are nearly inseparable and count each other as their closest friends, the one thing that can tear them apart is a romantic interest. They have been known to have feelings for the same girl most of the time and battle each other for the affections of the girl in question. In Rescue Rangers, both are in love with Gadget, but can't seem to be open about their feelings, nor does she notice at all. Voices The classic voices of Chip and Dale were mostly provided by Helen Silbert, Dessie Flynn /Dessie Miller and James MacDonald . The earliest voices of the chipmunks were provided by female office staff, without credit. In Private Pluto , the chipmunks' speech was created by speeding up sound clips of normal speech. In a number of the shorts that followed, many of these same sound clips were re-used again and again, though later shorts used new dialogue specifically recorded for them. At one point in Winter Storage , Chip and Dale get into an argument while caught in a trap. When the scene switches to an outside view of the box (with Donald Duck sitting on the box), the dialogue being heard is actually a sped-up segment of the voice-over narration from the Goofy short A Knight for a Day . Since 1988 , Chip has been voiced by Tress MacNeille and Dale has been voiced by Corey Burton . However, in Mickey Mouse Works, House of Mouse, the first season of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and the Have a Laugh! versions of the classic shorts, Tress voiced both chipmunks. History Chip and Dale in their first appearance, Private Pluto . Chip and Dale first appeared in a 1943 Pluto cartoon titled Private Pluto . In this appearance, they look a lot more like realistic chipmunks and did not have names. The two then-nameless twin chipmunks were never intended to be used again after that short, but when Walt Disney needed new characters to challenge Donald Duck , a decision was made to revive the two chipmunks, leading them to acquire their now-familiar names and personalities. Their names are a pun on the name \"Chippendale\" (a reference to furniture-maker Thomas Chippendale ). This was suggested by Bill \"Tex\" Henson, a screenwriter at the studio. As mentioned, Chip and Dale began their careers in Private Pluto. In that cartoon, Pluto is a part of the army and runs into trouble when it appears that two nameless chipmunks are hanging around the site in a pillbox. In this appearance, the two were completely indistinguishable in terms of both appearance and personalities. Afterward, the two would later appear in several of Pluto's cartoons, as well as those including Mickey Mouse . They did not get their names until the short Chip an' Dale . In that short, they meet their new nemesis Donald Duck, whom they would make countless appearances with, even beyond the animated short films. The chipmunks became far more famous for antagonizing Donald and are possibly best known for appearing in his shorts, having gained their trademark appearances and personas when dealing with the hot-tempered duck. Chip and Dale became so popular that they were able to star in their own series of cartoons, joining Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck , Goofy and Pluto . Only three shorts were created in that series. The first was Chicken in the Rough , where Dale becomes trapped in a chicken coop and needed to be rescued. The next and most famous one was Two Chips and a Miss , where they go out to a nightclub and battle for the attention of a female chipmunk named Clarice . The last was The Lone Chipmunks , where Chip 'n' Dale foil the outlaw Pete . Quite often in these shorts, their tails flicker and sometimes they are both seen running on all fours, much like actual chipmunks. An interesting note is that, in earlier shorts, they had the appearance of more realistic chipmunks (much like the woodland creatures in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ), only to gain their iconic, far more cartoony designs once their popularity and screen time grew. Appearances Walt Disney anthology series In a 1959 episode of the anthology series entitled \" The Adventures of Chip 'n' Dale \", Walt Disney was unable to host the show personally. Instead, he left a message on his tape recorder informing viewers of his arrangements to have Chip and Dale host in his place. The chipmunks use the time to go through an old book which holds memories of their fondest exploits. Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers Chip and Dale and the other main characters as they appeared in Rescue Rangers. After the success of DuckTales , Chip and Dale starred in their own series, Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers . They were friends of a famous retiring police dog, whose owner was framed by a crime boss for stealing a ruby. Through the adventure to retrieve the ruby and prove the cop's innocence, they met and recruited Gadget Hackwrench , Monterey Jack , and Zipper , forming the Rescue Rangers officially. They also get new enemies, most notably Fat Cat and Professor Norton Nimnul . Chip serves as the unspoken leader of the group, while Dale tends to provide most of the comic relief, though Dale does end up becoming the hero at times. Both chipmunks possess a crush on Gadget, becoming rivals for her affections. A running gag in the show has Chip being constantly interrupted when he attempts to tell Gadget his feelings for her. The two have even been love interests themselves. In \" Adventures in Squirrelsitting \", a squirrel named Tammy falls in love with Chip, and in \" Good Times, Bat Times \", a bat named Foxglove falls in love with Dale. Both of them apparently don't return these affections. A live-action/CGI feature film based on the series is currently in development. Chip and Dale in Mickey Mouse Works . Chip and Dale are recurring characters in Mickey Mouse Works , where they are recast as enemies of Donald Duck once again. One of the duo's most notable appearances in the series is in the short \" Mickey's Mixed Nuts \", where the chipmunks battle Mickey Mouse (someone that they didn't usually pester in past productions) for the last bag of nuts at a supermarket. Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas Chip and Dale appear in the segment Donald Duck: Stuck on Christmas. The two are briefly seen several times throughout the story. At the beginning, they are seen opening their presents. They appear again when they are hit with a snowball by Huey Duck, who then gets hit back by Chip. Their next appearance occurs near the end when an object is thrown into their home and it turns out to be a bag of nuts wrapped as presents from Huey, Dewey, and Louie . At the end, they are last seen throwing away their Christmas decorations and cleaning up. Chip and Dale in House of Mouse Chip and Dale have recurring roles in House of Mouse , primarily as guests at the club. Both chipmunks are seen shaking hands with Donald Duck in the show's intro. The episode \" Chip 'n' Dale \" is centered around the chipmunks as they spend their evening stealing bags of nuts from the guests while evading Donald. At the end of the episode, an advertisement is shown in which they seem to have their own storage organization where they store \"everything you don't need\". In \" Ladies' Night \", Minnie hires them to perform an act as the \"Chip and Dale Dancers\". In \" Ask Von Drake \", the chipmunks can be briefly seen during Ludwig Von Drake's headcount of all the Disney character guests . The duo also appears in \" House of Turkey \", where Donald complains about how he can't understand what they're saying, only for Daisy to retaliate by saying that she can't understand him either. They also appear briefly in Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse . Right after Pluto's Christmas Tree is shown, Chip and Dale pop out of a small artificial tree and catch Pluto's attention. Pluto starts barking at them, but in a reprise of the closing gag from the preceding short, they slap a \"Do not open till Christmas\" sticker over his mouth. Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Chip and Dale are recurring characters in this computer animated series. They are some of Mickey's friends. Unusually, the two don't seem to have a rivalry with Donald and Pluto. Most of the chipmunks' roles in the series are minor with the exception of the episode \" Goofy's Coconutty Monkey \", where they are the culprits behind the mysterious disappearance of the jungle's coconuts. In the end, they returned their stash, thinking they were giant nuts. They play another significant role in the episode \" Goofy's Thinking Cap \" where Mickey, Donald, and Goofy need twelve nuts for Clarabelle's scavenger hunt, to which the chipmunks gladly oblige. Chip and Dale with Mickey in Mickey Mouse. Chip and Dale appear in the episode \" Space Walkies \". During a voyage in outer space, Mickey and Pluto step out of their spacecraft to allow Pluto a chance to relieve himself. After which, Mickey tries to rush Pluto back to the ship by using a miniature spacecraft resembling a frisbee disk. The disk, it turns out, is a craft owned by an annoyed Chip and Dale, who berate Mickey for toying with their craft before their appearance catches the attention of Pluto, and vice versa. Almost instantly, Pluto attacks the chipmunks, and a chase through space follows. On the rings of a planet, however, Chip and Dale are able to elude Mickey and Pluto, giggling at their success and their adversaries' misfortune. Cameos In Fun and Fancy Free , Chip and Dale briefly appear, laughing at Bongo the Bear 's failed attempt to climb a tree. In Mickey's Christmas Carol , Chip and Dale make a cameo appearance dancing at Fezziwig 's Christmas party in Scrooge's past. Dale makes a brief cameo appearance in the Quack Pack episode \" Hit the Road, Backwater Jack \" when a man is trying to empty things in his pockets. Video Games Chip and Dale are recurring characters in the Kingdom Hearts video game series .

There doesn't seem to be any massively terrible pop songs I need to review right now. Well, I suppose I can finish off that Top 10 Worst Songs List of 19--[Suddenly his Skype alert goes off] Lupa? Lupa? [Instead it's Film Brain] Todd: [dejected] Oh... Hi, Matthew. FB: So Todd, the fourth year anniversary's coming up. Do you wanna do another crossover? Todd: Oh absolutely, I really enjoyed watching Sunday School Musical. Okay, maybe not enjoyed... FB: Don't you wanna wait and see what movie I have planned? Todd: No it's cool, I trust your judgement. What is it? FB: Oh, nothing. Just [taking out the DVD of...] Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel. Todd: [he takes out a shotgun and cocks it] Bring it on. [Now we get to the opening of Bad Movie Beatdown while we hear Todd playing a piano version of Ready To Roll. The opening contains additional clips of Todd this time.] [After the opening finishes, suddenly Todd busts into FB's hotel room, but without the shotgun] FB: Aah! Todd: Let's do this! FB: Didn't you have...a weapon? Todd: They would not let me take it on the plane. So, why did you pick that movie to review? Cause of its butchering of decent pop songs? FB: [smiling] No, I just like seeing my fellow contributors in pain. Todd: Yeah, I figured after the whole Rap Critic thing with Big Mama's House and all that. How can you stand all this crap? FB: [steepling his hands] Because I'm insane. Todd: Yeah, no shit. Well, let's get this over with. [Image of Ross Bagdasarian] Todd (VO): In 1958, struggling songwriter Ross Bagdasarian found himself a winning gimmick after discovering he could make his voice sound funny by increasing the speed of the recording. [cover of \"Christmas with The Chipmunks\", slowly zooming out] He built three cartoon characters to fit the high pitch: Alvin, Simon and Theodore, The Chipmunks. They were a big hit in the '50s, [brief clip of '80s TV show] a big hit again during the '80s, [brief clip of \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" (2007) movie trailer] and revived one more time by a live-action movie in 2007. [clips from the first movie play] And despite a terrible marketing campaign that prominently featured a scene where Alvin eats shit, I actually didn't think that movie was that bad. It actually had a few funny jokes, had a decent running plotline about making fun of the miserable behind the scenes machinery of teen pop stardom, and it was self aware about the silliness of making a live-action Chipmunks movie. Now keep in mind there's no way it could've actually been \"good\", per se, but when you got the movie versions of [posters of...] Garfield , Underdog or The Smurfs to compare it to, I maintain you could do worse. FB (VO): I agree, and I largely put this down to ex-Simpsons writer Jon Vitti being one of the writing team. I've watched it twice: once as a review candidate and once for this review before you harp on me, and it's harmless. It's not exactly great, but you could certainly do far worse. And honestly the kids loved it because it made a whopping $360 million dollars worldwide, so a sequel was inevitable. FB: Enter [holds up DVD case] the Squeakquel, which is exactly what you think the first one would be and then some. And as someone who's watched all three Alvin and the Chipmunk movies, I can tell you that this, by far, is the worst. Todd: You actually saw the third one? Is that even out on dvd yet? FB: [puts down DVD] I saw it in the theater in a professional capacity. Todd: Are you sure you're not obsessed-- FB: You shut up! I'm not obsessed with Alvin and the Chipmunks! Todd: ...Why don't we go on to the review? [We start off at the Regency logo] Todd (VO): So the movie begins... [Suddenly a chipmunk laugh is heard, then a guitar chord] Chipmunk: We're baaack! Todd: Well that's unnerving. FB: I think that sent a chill down every parents' spine. FB (VO): So the movie begins at a charity festival in Paris where the Chipmunks, full-fledged pop sensations are performing to a sell out crowd. Chipmunks: [singing The Kinks, \"You Really Got Me\"] Girl, you really got me now/You got me so I don't know what I'm doing Girl, you really got me going/You got me so I can't sleep at night Todd: Well that was a brutal murder of a perfectly good song. God, what did Ray Davies ever do to you, Squeakquel? FB (VO): In fact they're so famous, they're even being broadcasted around the world. Todd (VO): Oh look, the eskimos are watching in their igloo. That's nice, movie. Never too young to introduce the kids to embarrasingly inaccurate stereotypes, I always say. FB (VO): Also back this time is Dave Seville, played once again by Jason Lee, wearing that pained look of someone who knows the phrase \"contractual obligation\" all too well. Alvin starts getting extremely into this gig, and because the chipmunks have throwing arms that would make Superman jealous, manages to get up into the scaffolding, pulling out some wiring by accident. [This makes a cardboard cutout of Alvin snap off and swing toward Dave] Alvin: Dave! Look out! Todd: Lot of punch in that cardboard cutout. Is Dave made of styrofoam or what? [Dave's now in traction in a hospital bedroom] FB (VO): That's right, Jason Lee so does not want to be in this movie that barely three minutes have passed before they start writing him out as he's stuck in a Parisian hospital bed. He tells the Chipmunks, voiced pointlessly by Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney. not that you can tell, that they'll be in the care of Aunt Jackie. Dave: I want you guys to go home and live a normal childhood. I even made arrangements for you to go to school. Chipmunks: School? FB: I think that cardboard cutout seriously injured Dave's brain. I mean these are chipmunks, not children. They should be having normal chipmunk lives. I mean for goodness sake, what do they need to go to school for? Are you training them to be the next chipmunk lawyers, chipmunk scientists? FB (VO): And bye, Jason Lee. The Chipmunks are to be escorted out when Alvin predictably starts causing trouble. [Alvin jumps onto the bed remote which makes it go up and down, rocking Dave] Doctor: The more stress you put on Monsieur Seville, the longer it'll take him to recover! Alvin: You'll never take me! I'm not going anywhere without Daaa--[suddenly the doctor shoots Alvin with a tranquilizer, making him go loopy] Daydream believer and a homecoming queen. [And Alvin drops onto the bed all conked out] Simon: Maybe we should give him another shot. Todd: Yeah, one more shot in that tiny body might actually kill him. Go right ahead. FB: I mean that's not one, but two scenes where he's caused grievous bodily harm. This movie's dark, man. FB (VO): So the Chipmunks fly back to America and this is where they meet Aunt Jackie. You know Dave, I don't think an elderly woman in a wheelchair is going to keep up with these tornadoes of destruction. Also with her is Toby, an aggravating gobshite played by that guy from Chuck. [Zachary Levi] Aunt Jackie: The luggage, get the luggage. Toby: Yeah, let me get those. [Toby brushes against Aunt Jackie, making her go back] Aunt Jackie: Toby! Alvin: Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes! Theodore: Abandon wheelchair! [Aunt Jackie then starts going down the stairs and then gets hit by a cart] Todd: God, how many victims are the chipmunks gonna claim? One more and they're officially serial killers. FB: I mean nothing says \"good clean family entertainment\" like two people being hospitalized in the first ten minutes. FB (VO): So with Dave and Aunt Jackie taking permanent residence in hospitals for most of the remaining running time, it's up to Toby to take care of the Chipmunks. [sarcastic] Oh deep joy. Toby: You guys have nothing to worry about seriously because I'm not gonna be anything like Dave. You know, Dave's gone. Theodore: Gone? Toby: Not gone! Not \"gone\" gone. He's-he's-he's not dead, he's very much alive. He's completely coming back! Todd: When he wants another paycheck. FB: With each syllable this guy utters, the more I miss Jason Lee's unenthusiasm. [Alvin comes out of a cupboard with a bag of cheese balls] Alvin: Holla! The cheese balls are in the hizouse! [singing Bee Gees, \"Stayin' Alive\"] Well you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a cheese balls man, no time to talk! Staying aliiiiiiii--[he holds that note for a long time] FB: [shutting his ears] Oh god! Todd: [facepalming] Um, this really doesn't need a musical number. [Alvin jumps up to kick a pan down off the rack to pop the bag open] Alvin: --iiiiiiiive! Bingo! Todd: Wouldn't that just crush the cheese balls? Two people in the hospital and the cheese balls are okay? FB: Todd, Todd, Todd. If you've learned anything from the first ten minutes of the movie, it's that physics operates differently in the presence of talking chipmunks. FB (VO): And from one irritating shoehorned pop song to another. [The Chipmunks are riding in a bowl in a blender at high speed] Chipmunks: [singing Dead or Alive, \" You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) \"] You spin me right round baby right round like a record baby right round round round. [The group soon gets flung across the room] FB: Well at least it's better than the Flo Rida cover. Todd: Hey, fun fact. Did you know that you could fit all three chipmunks in a blender? I certainly did. [The phone rings and Alvin and Simon answer it] Chipmunks: Hello? Alvin: [he hangs up on Dave] Yup, nobody does that better than him. Todd: No, actually, he's quite terrible at it. Too panicky. Watch and learn. [We get a clip of the 50's cartoon] Dave: Okay, Alvin? Alvin? [Alvin's trying to open presents] ALVIN!! [that makes Alvin jump to the mike] Todd: Note the threat of implied violence. That's how it's done. Todd (VO): Okay, so they go to school. High school, to be precise. Hang on, even in-universe, they're obviously way younger than high schoolers, so what the hell's going on? FB (VO): And I'm certainly not going to question Dave's judgement in sending three tiny chipmunks into a bustling school where they run the daily risk of being crushed, run over and stampeded on a daily basis for a completely pointless education. [Rolling down the halls on a skateboard is a kid in an Eagle mascot costume] Mascot: Go Eagles! Theodore: Eagle! [he turns tail and tries to run, but the mascot jumps over him, and then falls down a flight of stairs while the Chipmunks look on] FB: And that's another hospital well accounted for. Todd: I'm noticing a theme. Maybe we should just keep Alvin locked in a cage. That way no one gets killed. FB (VO): The Chipmunks are taken to their class where the girls instantly fawn over them. Oh yeah, I forgot. They're world famous singing chipmunks, so any normality is out of the window anyway. Some jocks are none too pleased about their lady stealing powers. Ryan Edwards: Somebody's gonna have to knock those guys down to size. [Todd just sighs at that statement] FB: Okay, if you're sexually threatened by something you can carry in your back pocket, you've got some serious self confidence issues. FB (VO): The jock bullies show what big meanies they are by chasing the Chipmunks across the school, even giving Simon a dreaded swirlie. Ryan: It's swirlie time! Simon: Oh come on guys this is so 1980's! Aaah! Please, please! [and he gets swirlied] Todd: Just because you point out that it's an outdated cliché doesn't excuse it. FB: Well I guess they figured the audience was so young enough that they wouldn't notice. Besides, is this really necessary? I think that toilet is enough to drown that chipmunk. Ryan: It's the fatty ratty. [the kids are poking at Thedore who's on a locker] Theodore: Cut it out! Todd: What the hell could have happened there? FB: All I know is I'm firmly guarding my testicles. Todd (VO): Uh-oh, now they're in trouble. But the principal is willing to cut them a deal. You see their music program is gonna be shut down unless the school wins a music competition. God that sounds familiar... FB: I'm pretty sure there's a black Christian choir who could help you out with that. FB (VO): It turns out the principal is also a bit of a fan. Dr. Rubin: I just cannot believe that you're actually sitting in my office! I have all of your CDs. I even went to see you last year in Denver! Todd (VO): Is she flirting with them? They're her students. And rodents. This is wrong on so many levels. FB: But you see, we're having a two-for-one sale on pedophilia and bestiality. Buy now and we throw in necrophilia absolutely free! Todd (VO): Meanwhile at JETT Records, the evil record producer from the first movie, Ian Hawke, played by David Cross, swears vengeance on the Chipmunks that ruined his career. He's apparently homeless and spends his time eating garbage from the company dumpster and fighting a rat for muffins. Todd: I feel like this is a metaphor of some kind for David Cross' participation in this franchise. FB: It's like the writers thought to themselves, \"How can we demean David Cross more than we already have?\" FB (VO): Somehow sneaking aboard a FedEx truck, enter the Chipettes; Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor, pointlessly voiced by Christina Applegate, Anna Faris and Amy Poehler, who are hit so hard by the pitch shifting you can't even tell them apart. They've come to see Ian because they think he can make them stars like Alvin and the Chipmunks. I know it's a minor point, but where on earth did Jeanette get those glasses? In the first film, Simon's glasses were actually explained, whereas here they come right out of the packet. Todd: Are you sure you're not taking this too seriously? FB: It's a point about laziness, okay? Todd: ...Okay. Todd (VO): Ian takes them to his \"office\" on the roof where the Chipettes show off their skills. Chipettes: [singing Corinne Bailey Rae, \"Put Your Records On\"] Girl, put your records on/Tell me your favorite song/You go ahead, let your hair down Todd: They're naked. This is bothering me. FB: Thank you! I'm glad I'm not the only one. I mean I know they're chipmunks, but they're so anthropomorphic that seeing them without clothes kind of freaks me out. Todd: Yeah, the furries might like this. I don't. Todd (VO): To make the chipmunks not think he's a homeless loser, he breaks into a model apartment with a grand piano? Todd: You do realize the realtor has to show up at some point, right? FB (VO): The following day we see...the Chipmunks playing dodgeball? Whose bright idea was that? Alvin: Remember your five D's: dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge! FB: So Justin Long is Alvin, making a reference to Dodgeball, which Justin Long was in, and...oh shit. (This meta realization has made the gamma go up!) Todd: Oh look what you did, you made the universe divide by zero again. FB: Sorry? Ryan: You're next, furball! Alvin: You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? I'm the only one here, so you must be talkin' to me. [Todd's facepalming] FB: Ah yes, a reference to that popular well-known children's movie, Taxi Driver. Todd: Hey, how do you think it would smell if you pressed Alvin in a George Foreman grill? I'm guessing delicious. [FB's nodding with a grin] Sorry, go on. FB (VO): It turns out that Alvin's got a good catching and throwing arm, and that the jocks actually want him for their football team. FB: Their football team? He's 8\" tall! Todd: Let it go, man. It's Chipmunk Town. FB (VO): And thus, Alvin becomes the most popular kid in school. Even has the pussy on demand if he wanted it. Of course if you already forgot... Todd (VO): I did. FB (VO): Quiet, you. The Chipmunks are joining the music competition which Ian sees in the newspaper. Todd (VO): So this is Ian's evil plan: he's going to use the Chipettes to steal the Chipmunks' fame by entering the Chipettes into the same school where Alvin and company promptly fall for their female counterparts. Todd: So, the school has two sets of singing chipmunks wandering around. FB: Surely the principal wouldn't allow this considering they might be a threat to the music contest? Todd (VO): And sure enough, Ian and his chest hair shows up to position the Chipettes as rivals to the Chipmunks in the contest. Brittany: [singing \" Hot N Cold \" by Katy Perry] You change your mind like a girl changes clothes. Chipettes: [singing] And you know that you're no good for me, yeeaahh! Cause you're hot and you're cold/You're yes then you're no/You're in and you're out/You're up and you're down. Brittany: Yeah yeah yeaaaahhh! [Meanwhile Ian's flailing around with lights strapped to his suit while a thought bubble saying \"KILL ME\" is put over him] Todd: You notice they skipped the line about PMSing like a bitch. Hey here's a riddle everybody; What's Kidz Bop, but worse? FB (VO): Ian convinces the principal to a public vote. Both groups will perform on Friday and whoever gets the most applause represents the school in the contest. That's if the Chipmunks can get their act together because Alvin and Simon are beginning to fall out over Alvin's popularity. This makes Theodore nervous, and he goes to sleep with Toby. Theodore: Can I sleep with you? Toby: [sleepily] Sure, okay. [Theodore gets under the covers, but not before Toby blasts a fart] Theodore: Dutch oven! Not the Dutch oven! Oh, anything but the Dutch oven! Must find fresh air before it's too late! Aah! It's too late! It burns! Ohh, mama! [he gets out of the covers and passes out] Todd: [facepalming again] Oh good, the obligatory fart joke. FB: [imitating a kid] Daddy, what's a Dutch oven? Todd: Cause Dave never farted in bed. Colon like daisies, that man. FB (VO): Speaking of Dave, the writers remembered that Jason Lee was in their movie as Toby answers Dave's call from Paris and lets slip that he's the one taking care of the kids. Dave immediately tries to get out of the hospital as soon as possible. Presumably around the point he discovered that My Name Is Earl was cancelled. [Dave tries to use the bed remote to lift his leg up, but pushes it too much that it lifts him off the bed] Dave: Nurse! Get me out of here! Help! Todd: Okay, that one wasn't Alvin's fault, he's just an idiot. FB (VO): There's also a completely stupid filler scene here where the jock bullies tell Simon that he's a litter monitor, and then laugh at him as he takes his nonexistant position seriously. I thought Simon was supposed to be the smart one. Surely he'd see right through this blatant prank? Todd (VO): Well Simon gets thrown in the garbage and Alvin goes to help him, but they're pissed off at each other, especially when Alvin admits he may not be singing against the Chipettes because he has a football game at the same time. [Todd's facepalming again] FB: Oh, so it's becoming High School Musical. Todd: Okay, let me sum up the situation so far. Todd (VO): Alvin is in conflict with the other Chipmunks, who are in conflict with the school bullies, and they're all in conflict with the guy from Chuck, as well as with the Chipettes and with David Cross, who is taking advantage of the Chipettes as well as, for the record, setting the Chipettes in conflict with each other. Todd: Got all that? [FB shakes his head] Neither do I. What the hell is the plot of this movie? Todd (VO): So Alvin debuts on the football field in a stupendously stupid sequence. Alvin: I'm taking you down, Jennifer! Linebacker: You're the one going down, rat face. Alvin: I'm gonna crack you like an acorn, and eat you for dinner. With some fava beans and a nice Chianti. [And then proceeds to flick his tongue like Hannibal Lecter] FB: A Silence of the Lambs reference? Yeah, that's a film the kids should be aware of. Todd: Hey, maybe they'll reenact the mangina sequence next. [Todd gives FB a creepy smile, which makes him scooch away from him] FB (VO): They throw the ball with Alvin on it, which I'm pretty sure is cheating, but there you go. [the ball lands down on top of Alvin] Ooh, he's dead! [Of course, Alvin's alive and well] No, of course not, but he ends up scoring the winning touchdown, if you call it that, and is his usual irritating self. Alvin: That's what I'm talkin' about! Don't hate the player, hate the game! And I love how awesome I am! Uh-huh! FB (VO): Urge to kill rising! Todd (VO): Did you know that thousands of small rodents are killed every year by farming combines? Just a little piece of trivia, don't know why that popped in my head. FB (VO): At the same time during the sing-off, Alvin still hasn't arrived, and the Chipettes are up first. Brittany: [singing Beyonce, \" Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It) \"] All the single ladies. (All the single ladies) All the single ladies. (You put your hands up) Up in the club, just broke up, doing my own little thing. Decided to dip, now you wanna trip, cause another brother noticed me. Chipettes: [singing] If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it. If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it. Todd: Oh good. Because Single Ladies wasn't enough of an annoying tuneless mess anyway, why not do it with chipmunk voices? FB: By the way, chipmunks in sexy dresses telling me that if I like it I should put a ring on it? Do not want! FB (VO): And because Toby is completely useless, he still hasn't found Alvin, and the Chipmunks have to forfeit, meaning the Chipettes win by default. Todd: [sarcastic] Oh no, this is horrible. Now they won't be able...to... FB: To see who would sing in a contest to save the school's music department. Todd: A what? FB: To save the school's music department. Todd: Oh, right. FB: Yes, don't worry about it. FB (VO): Alvin arrives late to realize he's a bit of a prick. Worse still during the night, Theodore, feeling upset over the lack of family unity, has run away to the zoo. Todd (VO): Whoa Matthew, you might wanna explain this for the people who haven't seen the movie. FB (VO): Good point. In one of the numerous sub-plots competing against each other in this mess, Theodore's inexplicably become a fan of the show Meerkat Manor, hence he has ran of to join the meerkats. FB: Well hopefully he won't get a cameo from this guy. [Quick clip from a Compare The Market commercial] Aleksandr: Simples! Todd: What the hell was that? FB: It's a UK thing. Trust me, they found that hilarious. Todd: ...I'll take your word for it. Todd (VO): At the zoo, Theodore enters what he thinks is the meerkat exhibit, but has now been changed into the birds of prey exhibit instead, even though those wild animals would easily be able to fly out of the enclosure. Todd: And why would a talking animal want to live with a number of non-talking animals? And for that matter, can Theodore not read? And if he can't, why did he think meerkats were gonna be there in the first place? FB: It's so he can get rid of his fear of eagles, Todd. You know, the other asinine Theodore thing we've been skipping over cause there's so much crap in this movie. Todd: Oh yeah, right, we totally skipped that. Wow, there is a lot of shit in this. FB: There sure is. Todd (VO): Alvin, Simon and Toby come to the rescue--Okay, not so much in Toby's case, he's a moron--and Alvin talks to a distinctly uninterested eagle. Alvin: I get why you want Theodore. I do. But, I'm sorry. I can't let that happen. He's my brother. Not that you'd know that, because I've been such a big jerk lately. Todd: You know, I don't think there's much use talking to a non-talking animal. FB: I bet that eagle's thinking to himself, \"Mmm, tasty chipmunk! Om nom nom nom!\" Theodore: I gotcha, Alvin! [Theodore slips between the eagle's legs, stomps on it's foot to no effect, then runs with Alvin. Alvin slips through the screen, only for Theodore to get stuck.] Theodore: Help! [Alvin and Simon pull him out, then run away to the gate just as Toby finally got in] Toby: Guys, that was huge! Todd: No, it really wasn't. Todd (VO): Also the Chipettes have captured the record company's attention and got a gig opening for Britney Spears. But oh no, they'll miss the competition, and Ian threatens them if they, or more specifically Brittany, don't sing. Todd: Are we really supposed to care about the fate of the music program? FB: And maybe I'm misreading this, but does Ian have a thing for Brittany? Please tell me he's not after some chipmunk tail. Todd (VO): Okay, competition's happening, got a few sub-Kidz Bop performances and for some reason, the Chipmunks are there even though they're not performing. Brittany calls Alvin, Ian's locked them in a cage. FB: And thus concludes the Chipettes doing a mini-remake of the first film. Todd: Oh no, if the kids don't arrive on time, they'll never be able to save the...what is it, the gym? The orphanage? FB: Close enough. FB (VO): So Alvin comes to the rescue on a toy motorbike, and with Simon's help, they break out of the cage and escape while Ian isn't looking. They hop onto the motorbike whilst Ian watches in horror and gives chase. Alvin: Don't worry! I'm gonna get a little help from my friend, Digger! Whoo! [Coming out of the sewer is a gopher named Digger] Digger: Roger that, Alvin! Whoa! Feels like I'm back at the racetrack! Todd: Who the heck was that? FB: That's...[he consults his notes on this] Digger, the NASCAR gopher. Todd: Who? No. Why? FB: Maybe it's to set up his own movie? Todd: Did he get one? FB: No. [Todd double facepalms while FB tosses his notes in the air] Todd (VO): Ian chases them with a toy helicopter, for some reason, and then Alvin and the Chipettes hop onto said helicopter, for some reason, they throw their helmets at Ian, forcing him to throw the plane's remote into the air which the Chipettes catch. And then the toy motorbike runs right into Ian's nuts. FB: It wouldn't be a lowest common denominator kids movie without some testicle smashing. Todd: I just want to point out that David Cross' memoirs are titled \"I Drink For A Reason.\" This is the reason. FB (VO): The two remaining Chipmunks are waiting for Alvin to return, so to stall, *fake gasp* wait, is Toby taking the stage? Todd (VO): Okay, here's another thing we forgot to mention. The school music teacher was the guy from Chuck's crush in high school. So now he's taken the stage, confessed his love/horribly embarrassed her. Sorry we skipped over that, but trust me if you blinked, you wouldn't have missed it anyway. Toby: [singing badly] Ever since I met you, I want to be your guy. / But as you probably noticed, I'm...pathologically shy. / Standing on this stage right now I think I'd rather die, / so I'm just gonna start by saying...hi. FB: Your problem isn't that you're \"pathologically shy.\" It's that you're a stupid, filthy, jobless moron. Get off the stage! FB (VO): Luckily Alvin and the Chipettes fly in through a conveniently open window and join up with Simon and Theodore. Together they perform this completely unrehearsed, yet completely choreographed performance of [singing it] \"We Are Family.\" And look who's decided to show up five minutes from the end, it's Dave! Todd (VO): And the school wins the competition, saving the music department. Todd: And those music departments for all those other schools in the competition? Shut down. Todd (VO): As for the Britney Spears opener, uh, well... [Sticking out of the curtain is a sock puppet] Ian: [doing bad imitations] \"Hey everyone. I'm Jeanette.\" \"And I'm Eleanor.\" [he comes out on stage in make-up and a dress] And I'm Brittany! And we're the Chipettes! Todd: Poor David Cross. FB: I bet he drinks Jack Daniels by the crate. Todd: We should do that after we're done. FB: You're damn right we should. Todd (VO): So Dave's returned and everything's back to normal. Dave even adopts the Chipettes alongside the Chipmunks. FB: So they're both adopted sisters and love interests? Both: Eeewwww! [Dave turns the light off, but Alvin turns it back on] Alvin: Not tired! Dave: Alvin, come on, it's time for bed. [he turns the light off again and Alvin turns it on again] Alvin: Still not tired! [Another round of off and on] More awake! Dave: Alvin, that's it, don't make me come over there! Alvin: Okay! [Alvin turns the light off, only for Dave to trip on a skateboard, falling down once again. Alvin turns the light on once more.] Todd: Well that's Dave back in the hospital again. FB: Alvin's a shit. Todd (VO): And if you stick around during the credits you see the comeuppance for the jock bullies and David Cross being humiliated further still by being thrown into a dumpster. Again. You know, stuff they couldn't resolve in the main narrative. Todd: And why should they? They don't care. They made a shitload of money. FB: Almost half a billion dollars worldwide. Todd: ...I hate people. [Clips of the movie play as they give the closing summary] FB (VO): They just didn't care. The whole thing feels rushed because there are so many plot elements to throw into the mix here that it never falls into a cohesive storyline. It is a film filled with almost unparralelled annoyance. You want Alvin to die because he's so arrogant, you want to inflict pain on Zachary Levi for being so insufferable, and you want to slap some dignity into David Cross. The only wise person here is Jason Lee, who knew to sit out most of this dungheap for a borderline cameo appearance. His straight man presence is sorely missed. Todd (VO): This was a pointless embarrassment. The first movie was sort of admirable in how it at least poked fun at the stupidity of its own premise, but the Squeakquel--god that word sounds stupider everytime you say it--the Squeakquel has no interest in doing so whatsoever. It's just as stupid, but now it's given up trying to be clever about it, and the plotting is unruly half-assed. They introduce a conflict in one scene, completely ignore it for hour long stretches, then resolve it. This sucked. Screw you, Matt. Screw you. FB: I love you, too. I'm Matthew Buck, beating down bad movies everywhere. Todd: And I'm Todd in the Shadows saying, come on Matt, you only did this review because you love Alvin and the-- FB: I AM NOT OBSESSED WITH ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS!! [He tackles Todd to the floor, then we go to credits]\n\n{ \"last_modified_datetime\": \"2024-02-04T17:15:47.217000\" }\n\ntc_13_0\n\nJamie Lee Curtis - IMDb IMDb 17 January 2017 4:34 PM, UTC NEWS Actress | Director | Soundtrack Jamie Lee Curtis was born on November 22, 1958 in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of legendary actors Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis .
