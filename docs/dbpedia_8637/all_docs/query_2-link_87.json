It was one thing when their contemporaries Noah & The Whale and Laura Marling plugged in, but now that the mega-selling, suspender-sporting, double bass-wielding quartet with the antiquated band name have forsaken their acoustic roots, it’s all over bar the “Judas” chants. Indeed, that very electric guitar is being played by Winston Marshall, once dubbed Britain’s “first ‘banjo rock star.’ ”\n\n“By whom?” says singer Marcus Mumford with a laugh, at the other end of a couch from the quietly grinning Marshall, doing press in a Toronto hotel. “What motherf–ker’s saying that?”\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAre Mumford & Sons folk's new Judas?

By 2013, their foot-stomping image had become so pervasive that they parodied it in the video for “Hopeless Wanderer,” in which comic actors Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Ed Helms pose as the band members and indulge in over-the-top homoerotic folk-rock excess. Despite their super-earnest music, they were self-aware. And they already knew they were going to go electric.\n\nMumford and Marshall are currently promoting their new, entirely banjo-free album, Wilder Mind (released May 4 by Universal); the next night, they, along with bassist Ted Dwane, keyboardist Ben Lovett, and a touring drummer, will play most of it at a secret show at Toronto’s 600-capacity Lee’s Palace. Their insecurity about rocking out will be reflected by a heavy handed decision to have security pre-emptively confiscate fans’ phones at the door so no images or music might escape. Onstage, Mumford will say, “It feels like we’re playing to family” — if so, he’s something of an autocratic patriarch.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut offstage, he and Marshall are likable blokes. In their hotel suite, Mumford has his leg up on with his foot taped up from a soccer injury — “He kicked a fan,” Marshall quips. They talk about how they deal with “moments of pride or doubt or success” with humour. At the end of the interview, Marshall, who has taken improv lessons, will dish out the meta-joke, “Do you know what the key to comedy is timing,” to Mumford’s peals of laughter — and then unintentionally bash his head against a lamp when he rises from the couch, provoking further mirth: standup comedy indeed. Both are keen to deflate pretence.\n\nSo when the story comes up of how, as Lovett told NME, The National’s guitarist/songwriter inspired Wilder Mind one night while on tour in Chicago (“we managed to convince Aaron to give us some of his time, his wisdom and his experience”), Mumford begs to differ. “We didn’t talk about music at all that night. We got in trouble with his tour manager the next day for getting him too drunk, and he had to play, and he was really in a bad state. … He was a friend who had some amplifiers in the right place at the right time and had really good knowledge on how to use them.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIt can be f–king brutal for the people you’re writing about\n\nHaving played electric instruments individually before they’d formed the band in 2007, the quartet band decamped to Dressner’s Brooklyn studio to write Wilder Mind, and let their hair down (in Marshall’s case, literally — he now looks less Judas than Jesus). They enlisted producer James Ford (Florence & The Machine), who, Marshall notes, was intrigued by their new direction and “tactful enough not to explicitly say what he didn’t like about the other stuff.” Where in the past the band had relied on Mumford’s one-man-band kick drum skills, as he and Marshall strummed and plucking frantically, on Wilder Mind, Ford sat down behind a full kit. Having a drummer gave them space, as Mumford says, “to just play a cool tremolo chord on your guitar and sing. It does change the atmosphere of the song totally. … We’re having a f–king great time now.” And where previously, says Mumford, “the recording process was a bit of an arse that we had to get through in order to go and play more shows,” he now wants to “go and make a lot more records.”\n\nThat said, beyond the textural variation on Wilder Mind, there’s still the traditionally Mumford-esque assertive sincerity. Says Marshall, “You write in songs what you’re too scared to write in real life, and then you sing the songs to loads of people instead of telling it to the person you should be telling it to. … Songs are a great way of dealing with those issues, but kind of a coward’s way as well.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“And it can be f–king brutal for the people you’re writing about,” chimes in Mumford, who’s married to actress Carey Mulligan.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nNational Post Sessions: The Last Internationale have Rage on their side\n\nMumford & Sons fans unhappy with the band’s Wednesday concert offered a refund\n\nAdds Marshall: “Yeah, I don’t think you should date a musician.”\n\nMumford: “And definitely don’t date Taylor Swift.”\n\nIf there’s anything these four want to get off their collective chests — they’ve long refused to answer questions about relationships — it’s couched in layers of elusive, sometimes self-contradictory lyrics, cobbled together from ideas brought forth by the band as a whole. Mumford says, “There are romantic moments on [Wilder Mind], but it’s like there are melancholic moments on it, but there’s also pretty euphoric moments on it too, so it’s autobiographical still pretty much, apart from some instances where we borrow emotions off other people in songs, but I’d say it’s a relational record.”\n\nEr, right. The music, however, is immediate, and the fans that pack Lee’s Palace for the show are enraptured especially by album standouts “The Wolf,” a cathartic rocker, and “Only Love,” a surging, affirmative track that finds the whole venue clapping with religious fervour.\n\nThe one wag who shouts, “Where are the banjos?” is met with Mumford’s order to “Get out!” — but neither has to pretend they’re in earnest.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
