        "text": "Sterling K. Brown, 'This Is Us'\n\nIn the first season of This Is Us, Sterling K. Brown’s Randall Pearson went on a road trip with his newly discovered birth father, William (Ron Cephas Jones), to learn more about his roots. The episode, “Memphis,” won Brown his first lead actor Emmy. In the seasons since, Randall has struggled with his identity as a father, as a son and as a Black man raised in a white family. But he was always missing a piece of the puzzle: What about his birth mother, Laurel (Jennifer C. Holmes), whom he thought died during his childbirth?\n\nHe finally got the answers he was seeking — and some closure — in the season five episode “Birth Mother,” written by Kay Oyegun and Eboni Freeman and helmed by Oyegun in her directorial debut. It told the story of Laurel’s life: Raised in a well-off Louisiana family, she had a star-crossed teenage love and lost her brother in Vietnam, leading to a drug habit that put her in prison after Randall’s birth. Ashamed and afraid to make contact with her son after her release, she moved back to Louisiana instead. By the time Randall learned of her existence, it was too late.\n\nOyegun and Brown spoke to THR about the emotional episode, which ended with a cathartic imagined conversation between Randall and the woman he never got to meet.\n\nKAY OYEGUN In [season one episode] “The Big Day,” where we go back to the birth of the Big Three with Rebecca and Jack, we had conversations early on about seeing the birth of Randall also. We were going to parallel those two birthing experiences. I’ll be very candid about it: I remember the early conversations of that. The version that was discussed was really not ideal. It was an exercise in what’s the battle, what’s the hill, all that kind of stuff. I was just sort of like, “I think this is tragedy porn in a way that we don’t need to do.” So it was kiboshed then because it wasn’t humanizing the experience. We knew so little about anyone in that space and, frankly, we didn’t have anyone on the show at that point to be able to tackle that storyline with an element of grace.\n\nAs we were fleshing out what [Randall’s] journey was going to be [in season five], this one organically came out and then we built out the stories from there. So it was always a desire in our hearts to do, but we wanted to do it two-pronged: We wanted to honor the human being that Laurel is, and we wanted to make sure that it answered a question that Randall was having.\n\nBROWN I remember when you guys pitched it to me, but when was the decision made that Laurel lived? Because the original lore was that she had passed in childbirth.\n\nOYEGUN There was a conversation about, “What if William had a narrative of that period that was actually wrong?” That’s all we were thinking, but it was one [idea] that we just wrote on a notecard and put on the board. It was understanding the realities of what he was experiencing at that time. Could he have known everything? Is there a world where there was something he didn’t know? Our lens, the way we look at the show and the way we talk about the show and craft it, is that everyone’s narrative is their own. A lot of times you can be in a room with someone and they’re having an entirely different experience than you. That’s where that came from in season three.\n\nWe finished season four a little bit early as far as writing, and then we were talking about Laurel deeper. I had watched the HBO show Watchmen, and I made Dan watch Watchmen, Dan made you watch Watchmen, Eboni and I watched Watchmen again together, and we were obsessed. The episode that walked through Regina King’s father’s life was something that we were so amazed by and so thrilled by and so inspired by that it kind of married to the things that we had been thinking about in season three, where we were trying to figure out what if William didn’t know what he thought he knew. It was a season four final decision, but it had been a season three birthing of an idea and a notion.\n\nBROWN Normally I get a chance to be in the writers room. I come as much as I can. I love seeing how the sausage gets made. So this is the first time where I’ve been out of the writers room because we had COVID and you guys were meeting virtually on Zoom. I’m popping in to the Zoom like, “What’s up, talk to me about the season. What’s going on this year?” And then you were like, “Randall’s mother is alive,” and I’m like, “What you talkin’ ’bout, Willis? We’ve made four solid seasons where there’s no sharks to be jumped. Talk to me about how this works.” I was about to be like no, she can’t be alive, because if she is, that fucks up everything for me. What really cemented it for me is that this is the first time Randall got a chance to think of her as an individual and not just as his mother.

Williams and Jonathan Majors have never experienced a relationship quite like the one they shared making Lovecraft Country. The HBO drama series, boasting 18 Emmy nominations, is anchored by legacy and generational trauma, with Williams and Majors at the center of that. The show not only saw characters exorcising demons — those born from racism and the supernatural — within the narrative, but offscreen as well.\n\nMajors, who is up for outstanding lead actor in a drama, and Williams, up for outstanding supporting actor in a drama, reunited over Zoom to talk about their experience on the show and the bond they formed. In an emotional conversation between the two, the actors opened up about allowing themselves to be vulnerable with one another and fulfilling roles in each other’s lives beyond the set.\n\nLovecraft Country is not the first time you two have worked together. Was When We Rise the first time the two of you met?\n\nJONATHAN MAJORS Yeah, it was. It was wonderful.\n\nMICHAEL K. WILLIAMS We played a real person. His name was Ken Jones. We recently just lost him. He passed earlier this year. I just wanted to let his family know, if they see this, we lift him up and we send our condolences.\n\nWhat did you learn from each other, playing the same person at different points in his life?\n\nWILLIAMS Well, I was jealous because the young Ken was handsome, young, robust! I got to play the Ken Jones in the part of his life where he was struggling. I would look at Jonathan in the military uniform and I’d be like, “Dang!” (Laughs.)\n\nMAJORS I think the moment that for me was the most beautiful, and where I learned the most, was in San Francisco over dinner. We had a whole night together, with our late brother Ken Jones. It was the three Kens. This was my very first job ever and Mike took care of the whole thing. I was a brother he didn’t even know well. But he took us both under his wing and really walked us through the process of making the film, and telling the story, and brought that same energy to our collaboration. He showed me that the learning and the process of being a great actor is one of servitude and humility. And that’s something I took in. When we met up in Lovecraft, we both brought that same energy.\n\nDid that previous experience make it easier to play off each other once again in Lovecraft Country, this time as father and son?\n\nMAJORS I just want to jump in, if I may, Pop, and say that the process of Montrose Freeman and Atticus Freeman began, I believe, at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association party at TIFF. It was my first kind of outing like that, and I remember being very nervous just to be there. I saw Mike. I was trying to get to his area, and I finally did, and he hugged me. He gave me all of this encouragement and love. And there was a covenant that was made in my ear in the middle of all of this vulgarity. There was this peace and connection between two men of different generations. He made a promise to me. Mike, you said, “I’ve got your back. We’re going to bring it. We’re here for each other.” That was the gist of it. And we both were emotional. I was just like, “Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.” Mike also says “Yes, sir” to me, even though he is the elder. It’s odd, but I think that’s just how we were raised. And that plays into our relationship as Atticus and Montrose, where in the scene, spiritually, Atticus and Montrose can switch from being the father to the son.\n\nWILLIAMS I’d never heard of Lovecraft Country or anything about H.P. Lovecraft. All I knew was that I wanted another opportunity to work with Jonathan. Most of our connection in When We Rise was offscreen and off-set as brothers, but we didn’t actually share a frame together until Lovecraft Country. I was eager to get that opportunity, especially after what I’d seen him do with young Ken Jones in When We Rise.

He spoke with The Hollywood Reporter as part of its Drama Actor Roundtable.\n\nLet’s start easy. If a fan is coming at you, what is he or she most likely to say, do and recognize you from?\n\nI get people who smile and then don’t really know where to pin me. They come up and start saying, “You’re the guy.” And you’re like, “Yeah.” And then they say, “Go on, what, what is it?” And then you’ve got to decide in, like, a split second whether you’re going to share your entire CV. Mine’s not massive, but still, it’s a predicament. (Laughs.)\n\nJosh, you came onto The Crown when the series was already a phenomenon. So you go in, eyes wide open, about what will likely happen to your career. How do you prepare yourself and your family for that?\n\nYeah, it was sort of a surprise, but not a surprise because we knew what happened to those [actors]. To me, my family, my friends, people around me, it was less about “Oh, your life’s going to change” and more about just being cautious and supportive and understanding of the times that you have to look out for each other. I was thinking about this recently because it was Mental Health Awareness [Month], and one of the things I feel very fortunate about in our industry is that there’s this sense of family. I don’t know if everyone else feels it, but I’ve always felt a sense of support. Because what we put ourselves through when we explore character is actually a very tricky mental flex, and so [you need that] support network. And [it’s not only when you’re] playing characters but also with all the trimmings that go along with being an actor and in the public eye. So I suppose what I’m saying here is that I feel very lucky to have these [men here] and everyone else in our industry to pick up the pieces when I’m having a mild breakdown.\n\nJosh, you may not be interested in the Royal Family, but much of the world is. There was certainly heavy interest in the interview Prince Harry and Meghan Markle gave to Oprah earlier this year. I’m curious, do you consume media about the Royal Family as Josh O’Connor or as the guy who’s been playing Charles? And if the latter, are you defensive of him as you watch or read?\n\nI suppose I do feel defensive in a certain way, I guess. But really, I’m the worst person to talk about the Meghan interview. I didn’t watch it and I don’t think I will, to be honest. So any conversation about, “Gee, what did you think about what Charles said last week?” I’m like, “Guys, I have no idea.” (Laughs.)\n\nWhat would you love to do, if only Hollywood was offering?\n\nI feel like all the roles that I’m always like, “God, I’d love to have a go at that,” I think you have to be in your 70s to do. (Laughter.) I don’t know why I’ve got a strange sort of obsession with [playing older]. When I was auditioning for drama school, you were supposed to pick one classical speech, like from Shakespeare, and one modern speech, and my drama teacher and I didn’t know what to pick. You were supposed to pick something roughly your age. I was 18 years old. … I did a speech from Lear. (Laughs.) And then I did a speech from an Alan Ayckbourn play, where I was a guy in his 80s in a retirement home. Those were my speeches. And all the drama schools were like, “You are crazy.” Anyway, I got into one. So, maybe, like, if Gandalf came along today …\n\nWhat do you wish you’d known or done differently when you were first starting out?\n\nHonestly, my first paycheck was for two lines in Doctor Who, and it covered my rent for a month and I was so excited. Matt Smith [was the Doctor]. I had two lines, and it was at the beginning of the episode, and then I was strangled to death. I had my entire family, a whole lot of them, gathered around one TV set to watch it, and the way it works on Doctor Who is you have this little opening bit and then [I’m] strangled, dead, and then the credits come up for the beginning of the episode. So [the strangling] happened, and then I got this text from my mum going, like, “Really good so far, I’m looking forward to seeing more.” About 50 minutes later, it’s just a text going, “That was it, wasn’t it?” They’d watched the entire episode. They didn’t even like Doctor Who.

He spoke with The Hollywood Reporter as part of its Drama Actor Roundtable.\n\nRegé, I’ve seen you say that there was a conversation early on as Bridgerton was coming together that the show would feature a diverse cast but it would not be colorblind casting and that was important to everyone involved. What were those conversations?\n\nWell, yeah, and they’re the same conversations I’ve had since the beginning of my career. I had it on Roots, which was a story predominantly about people of color. [On Bridgerton,] it’s about how do we go into the past and look at the images we already have and spotlight joy within that? Where are our opportunities to spotlight Black joy, because otherwise you go into the past and you think that it’s Black folks’ job to suffer for a while, carry a moral for the white folks, and then we all move on. And finding opportunities for us to be splendid and spectacular and joyous and romantic was the theme of my involvement from the very beginning. And Sylvie’s Love came out at the same time, and it was exactly the same conversations: Where’s our old-school Hollywood love story? Where’s our folks just falling in love?\n\nYou’ve also acknowledged that you sent several warning texts and flashing red light emojis to your family’s Whatsapp group — were they sufficiently prepared for the show’s racier scenes?\n\nNo one was sufficiently prepared. I wasn’t sufficiently prepared, and I was there. (Laughs.) I think people were grateful for the intensity of the romantic aspects of Bridgerton; I’m not sure how grateful I was to watch it for myself. It was overwhelming. But I think people were looking to be overwhelmed. My family doesn’t want to be overwhelmed by my backside, specifically, too often, but they’ll take it on this occasion because everyone seems to be terribly happy.\n\nRegé, you hosted Saturday Night Live and leaned into this reputation you now have as a sex symbol. We often ask women, but rarely ask men, what’s your comfort level with that? And do you ever want to scream, “I’m a highly trained actor, I can do other things, too”?\n\nI don’t think I need to scream, because hopefully I can do that in the work. And to the last question, there is a responsibility to my family. I think I owed them that side of things because I know that, for instance, my brother finds it incredibly hard to watch Roots, he can’t do it. And I need to look after my family in the more traumatizing work, as much as I look after them when they’re going to have a couple of blushes. I thought that I owed them that for putting them through the previous trauma. And there’s always a conversation with the people you love watching you go through these empathy bridges we’re talking about, these very far removed experiences that are massive — and I keep myself honest by imagining the rest of the audience is my family, and I owe them balance in that experience, too. There was also a personal circle that got completed for me on Bridgerton. The scene in particular that my brother can’t watch [from Roots has me] dragged away from my family in this carriage and sold into bondage in the U.K. I never thought that I’d do many parts in the 19th century, and then I’m back in the 19th century on Bridgerton, and there’s a moment on set where I’m rolling down the street in this lord’s carriage and I’m like, “Oh shit, I own this now.” That’s what I felt I owed my family at the other end of that circle.\n\nWhat would you love to do, if only Hollywood was offering?\n\nOh man, I always try to avoid anything that I can already imagine. I want the thing that I don’t even know exists.\n\nYou’re now contending with Bond rumors. …\n\nYeah, [because] it gets clicks. It’s got nothing to do with me — nothing to do with anything that has happened in any rooms or any meetings. It’s literally just a thing for people to talk about. So it’s flattering, but it’s just a game. It’s much more fun to hear John throw out things.

Now, after a Peabody Award and landmark Emmy win for star Billy Porter, Pose signs off by honoring the queer men of color and HIV/AIDS crusaders who fought for visibility and access to life-saving medication.\n\nThe finale saw Blanca (Mj Rodriguez) and Pray Tell (Porter) fight for access into a clinical trial that, in a stark reminder of the racial injustices that continue to exist today, favorited white men. After Pray comes close to death, the cocktail prolongs his life long enough for him to reunite with his ex-boyfriend, Ricky (Dyllon Burnside). Ultimately though, Pray sacrifices his own life so Ricky can survive and create his own legacy as Ricky had no idea that Pray was giving up his own meds to save his life.\n\nFollowing Pray’s death, Blanca, Ricky and the rest of their chosen family spread part of Pray’s ashes as part of an Act Up protest to fight for access to life-saving medication. The series ends in a hopeful note as Blanca imparts Pray’s words of wisdom to a new generation of kids who have arrived on the ballroom scene and are struggling to achieve their own success. The series also had a nod to Sex and the City and featured Blanca, Elektra (Dominique Jackson), Angel (Indya Moore) and Lulu (Hailie Sahar) meeting for drinks as they celebrate their professional accomplishments in a scene that culminated the fight for survival and acceptance that Pose also represented.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter caught up with Porter and Canals over Zoom to discuss the show’s creative conclusion, how Pray Tell’s death sped up Porter’s plans to break his 14-year silence about his HIV status and their hopes for Pose‘s lasting legacy. Here are excerpts from that interview.\n\nBilly, you spoke openly in the tremendous THR cover story about starting trauma therapy during the pandemic. What was it like to film Pray Tell’s death having done that work on your on yourself?\n\nPorter: Having done the work on myself, that was the self-care component of being an actor that we don’t always get the opportunity to understand that we need. I’m grateful for the trauma therapy because I was able to already have my mind in the right space and understand that Pray Tell has been, and continues to be down to the very end, a proxy for my healing. When that is the conscious objective, you can hold on to your sanity. How does that bear out in real time? What does that mean? Well, Steven can tell you that for episode two of season three — when we were shooting the break-up scene with Ricky, I pulled him aside and said, “I don’t have more than two takes in me.” In seasons one and two, I would have done it however many times somebody asked me to do it.\n\nBilly, you said that before you went in to film this last episode, you called your mother and told her about your HIV status. Did filming Pray’s passing influence that decision at all?\n\nPorter: The reality is, it was logistical. When I went in to film the death scene, I said to the whole set — remember, Steven? — I said: “This is the death of Pray Tell, and the rebirth of Billy.” I was very clear about this journey because I have lived too long to not let this moment be the moment that it’s supposed to be. This character was sent to me for a reason. Logistically, I have a memoir that coming out Oct. 19 and I was talking to my publicist, the brilliant Simon Halls of Slate PR, going through the year — there’s new music and then my memoir is coming out October and I’m going to reveal to the world that I’m HIV positive. I had planned on doing it inside of my book but he said, “Billy, you can’t play Pray Tell in Pose, die of AIDS and not say it then, because, unfortunately, the cynical cancel culture will come after you. It’s not fair, it’s not right but they will.” I was like, “Alright, what do you think I should do?,” and he said, “Well, you should do it now.” Within 24 hours, Simon and Ryan Murphy crafted this space for me to come out as positive in the way that I did. I had already done the work and I had already built myself up to doing it. I had already decided with my sister, our mother is not dying, so I’m going to have to tell her. We’re going to have to tell her we had planned on doing all of this with the timeline set for October. We just had to push it up six months.\n\nPose has meant so much to so many different communities. When you think back about the entirety of this historic series what are you most proud of?\n\nPorter: That we have been able to make the invisible, visible. I have felt invisible for a really long time, and that’s hard to believe because I’m actually one of the lucky ones. I went to drama school and worked in this business in various forms and I was completely invisible. The totality of who I am was completely dismissed. I’m proud to say that that is no longer the case.

I never watched it, because I was a kid, but there were reruns in the U.K., and I remember it was always on. I had that thing where I was mixing them all up: “Is he in a white suit? Is it that guy?” No, that’s Ironside. And then I was like, “Isn’t his name Matlock?” No, that’s Matlock. So I was aware of this gargantuan, long-running courtroom drama where you don’t even know how you knew everyone confessed on the [witness] stand, but it was like it’s in your DNA. He’s the guy who gets everyone on the stand. And then they were like, “What’s your favorite episode?” I don’t think I’ve ever watched one. It was huge here, as it was in the States, but it was more my grandparents’ show, not mine.\n\nOnce you got the role, did you go back to the Erle Stanley Gardner stories or the old show at all to get an idea of the character’s origins?\n\nI didn’t, for several reasons. I know if I was to watch any of the show, whether it was conscious or not, I know I would start imitating him, just through sheer osmosis. I know what I’m like — I’m like part mynah bird, part parrot. I can’t help myself but to imitate. When I see an adaptation of a book, I’ve stopped reading the source material because twice I’ve done an adaptation and I tend to play stuff that isn’t necessarily in the script, but it is in the original book. I remember a director going, “No, that’s in the book, that’s not in the script. The audience won’t know what you’re doing.” So I’m of the opinion that you just deal with the script. It makes life so much simpler.\n\nGardner’s Perry Mason stories famously have next to no backstory. What did you and the writers talk about in giving him a life outside the courtroom?\n\nThat was part of the big pitch for me. When I sat down with them, I was a bit trepidatious, but the first thing they said was that the big thing for us is backstory as to why does Perry Mason become Perry Mason. What is it that drives him to become an attorney? Then I was kind of interested — what is the origin story, that is interesting. Then, by episode five, he’s still not an attorney. I was like, “Guys, when is this going to happen? You’ve only got three episodes left!” They said, “If this goes, you’ll have seasons of being an attorney. Don’t rush getting there.” Give him a very interesting background as to why he becomes that person, and if you can set that up strongly, it pays off. What they did with him being a veteran, what happened to him in the First World War, what he endured, really feeds this sense of justice he has. So they were huge on backstory, and I think every element then fed what you saw.\n\nCan you discuss how the show layered in some issues, like Della’s (Juliet Rylance) lesbian relationship and the racism that Paul (Chris Chalk) faces, that are relevant to the present day?\n\nThat was [executive producer] Robert Downey [Jr.]. What he was interested in is, you have these three outsiders. He wanted them bonded by the fact that all three were sort of outsiders — Mason, when we first find him, isn’t really settled anywhere. He’s not one thing or the other. He has this farm he’s trying to protect out of familial duty more than anything. He’s drifted into this job. He’s an outsider, and I think that’s what makes him a good private investigator. Paul Drake is a Black cop, and Della is gay — these are three outsiders, and that kind of bonds them.

And the intense year that was 2020 gave the series’ Emmy-nominated seventh season plenty of material to work with.\n\n“We’re a show that takes place and exists in the same world we all do,” Black-ish showrunner and executive producer Courtney Lilly says during a roundtable conversation with THR Presents, powered by Vision Media, that also included his Emmy-nominated leads: executive producer Anthony Anderson, who plays Andre “Dre” Johnson, and producer Tracee Ellis Ross, who plays Rainbow Johnson.\n\nIn this most recent season, the show touched upon the November election, Black Lives Matter and the coronavirus pandemic. The latter was especially important, Lilly says, because Rainbow is a doctor and “she’s somebody who would have seen a side of the pandemic that a lot of us … didn’t get to see.”\n\nLilly and others also wanted to find ways to mine pain for comedy. In the episode “What About Gary?,” the well-meaning cousin (Rob Huebel) of Rainbow, who is bi-racial, took the path of many white progressives and asked Dre to help educate him on his own biases. At the end, Dre films a video telling those with similar questions to ask Google instead of him.\n\n“I got the phone call just like a lot of us did,” Anderson says, adding that “I enjoyed the episode because Gary was invited to the picnic and you’re always invited to the picnic until you put your foot in the mouth.”\n\nThe show has been airing long enough that audiences have seen the family grow. They welcomed a new baby a couple seasons ago and sent eldest child Zoey (Yara Shahidi) off to college. And Jack and Diane, the characters played by Miles Brown and Marsai Martin, started the show as tweens and are now fully into their teenage years. In the season’s “Babes in Boyland” episode, the show used the dynamic of having a boy and a girl who were the same age to explore inherent gender biases in our culture. Jack was celebrated for posting a shirtless Instagram photo while Diane was punished for having a secret account.\n\nThe episode ends with both Dre and Rainbow checking their own stigmas — and with Jack and Diane both grounded. Because this is, ultimately, a comedy, the parents laughed and celebrated their decision.\n\n“You think you’re entering into an episode that’s about a fake Instagram account and our daughter hiding something from us,” Ross says. “But instead, unexpectedly, you walk into this landmine of gender politics and how parents raise their kids. And then, of course, in typical Black-ish style, our answer — Dre and I — is that we decide to punish them equally.” Continue reading. — Whitney Friedlander\n\nWilliam H. Macy, 'Shameless'\n\nAfter 11 seasons and 134 episodes, Showtime’s Shameless wrapped its run in April with a series finale that was directly impacted by the global coronavirus pandemic in two key ways.\n\nUltimately, Frank’s (William H. Macy) past catches up with him as a combination of COVID-19 and the effects of alcoholic dementia prove to be more than he can handle and the character dies alone in a hospital.\n\nAs showrunner John Wells tells The Hollywood Reporter, the plan was always to have Frank face consequences of his addictions and horrible parenting — an agreement he made with his Emmy-nominated star Macy. While Wells had to rewrite the entire first half of the final season after production was stalled because of the pandemic, the prolific writer-producer (ER, The West Wing) added in Frank’s COVID-19 demise in a bid to accurately reflect the struggles of an economically challenged community like the South Side of Chicago.\n\nBelow, Wells talks with THR about the fate of Frank, a role that earned Macy a nomination for best lead actor in a comedy series.\n\nWhat went into the decision to kill off Frank — with COVID — after he was diagnosed with alcoholic dementia?\n\nWe planned on alcoholic dementia when we were only a few days from shooting when everything shut down in March [2020]. Bill [Macy] and I had always made deal that there would have to be consequences for all of Frank’s abuse to his body, between the drugs and alcohol. We arrived at alcoholic dementia and had written more than half the season when we shut down. With all the comorbidity that Frank had, Bill and I both talked about it and said, “It would be unrealistic to not have anybody in this community actually suffer severe consequences of the pandemic.” And Frank seemed like the logical choice. It could have been one of many things; it was the last thing that pushed him over the cliff, but he was barely hanging on. It’s not like we took out the healthiest individual you’ve ever seen. It seemed unrealistic to do something about the South Side of Chicago and people living barely above the poverty line and not have anybody succumb to this horrible pandemic.\n\nAnd he certainly had a number of preexisting conditions …\n\n(Laughing.) Oh yeah.\n\nNot only does Frank die, but he does so alone and the series ends without his family knowing about it.\n\nI lost a close family member who had been ill in December of COVID, despite following the COVID protocols. That’s an experience many people have had with relatives who have died of COVID. You really don’t get to connect. You find out later about them. It seemed appropriate for Frank. I really didn’t want to play the more sentimental version of them having to react to his death. I like keeping it with the audience’s imagination of who would react and how when they finally discover that he’s gone.\n\nSo sorry for your loss. My family can relate to that experience of not being able to say goodbye and not being there when it happened.\n\nMillions of people have been going through this experience this past year.\n\nNot that there’s ever a good transition after that, but focusing on the episode … Frank rises above the South Side on his bar stool, beer in hand, looking back on his life. What do you hope viewers take away from those scenes?\n\nEven for Frank there can be a grace and joy in the passing, at least that’s what I hope — that we can go out a little more gracefully. That’s what I felt. Frank can still make you smile even as he’s dying. He had that great ability. And Bill playing the part was such a huge part of that. To make you appalled and make you smile at the same time. Even when he was dogging his own kids in his own suicide note, he’s still making us laugh because he’s still Frank.

Coming hot off a triumphant week of 20 Emmy nominations, the Lasso team had more than one cause for celebration.\n\nAnd while the rest of the world can’t get enough of the show, the cast and crew sang the praises of the man behind the title — Jason Sudeikis himself. They pinned Sudeikis as their very own Ted Lasso, as he leads the ship with an unwavering positivity, not much unlike his character.\n\n“He sets the tone,” said Brendan Hunt, who serves as an executive producer on the show, in addition to playing Coach Beard.\n\n“And he’s just way too talented. It’s very annoying,” added cast member Jeremy Swift, who plays Higgins. Hunt and Swift both received Emmy nominations for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series.\n\nMarcus Mumford, lead singer of folk-rock band Mumford and Sons, was also in attendance, celebrating his recent Emmy nomination for outstanding original main title theme music. Mumford composed the show’s music along with composer Tom Howe and revealed that it was his friendship with Sudeikis that led to his involvement on the show in the first place.\n\n“I said yes [to the show] because of the person Jason is,” the musician said, citing Sudeikis’ optimism, truthfulness and complexity as some of the many qualities the actor brings to the Lasso character. “And I love him to bits.”\n\nAs for Ted’s own celebration in the event of an Emmys victory, Sudeikis claimed that he doesn’t think the character would indulge at all.\n\n“I think he’d let [the team] celebrate and just enjoy and clamor around them,” he said. Executive producer Bill Lawrence agreed, stating that Ted “would be happy that the people around him were happy, but he wouldn’t care all that much.”\n\nAnd for Sudeikis’ own potential Emmy wins come September, the actor-comedian said he “won’t even think about that until the moment it happens or doesn’t happen.”\n\n“I’ll live in the moment,” Sudeikis — wearing a black sweatshirt with the names “Jadon, Marcus and Bukayo,” a reference to Black English soccer stars Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Bukayo Saka who have faced racist social media abuse following England’s loss in Euro 2020 — affirmed.\n\nRegarding future seasons and storylines for Lasso and the AFC Richmond team, executive producer and writer Bill Wrubel claimed it’s all under wraps — in Jason Sudeikis’ head, that is.\n\n“The only way to retrieve that information would be to do a brain scan of Jason Sudeikis, so if you can somehow make him unconscious and, like the movie Inception, get inside his head, that’s how you can do it,” Wrubel joked.
