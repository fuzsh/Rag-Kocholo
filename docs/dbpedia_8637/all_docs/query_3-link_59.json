        "text": "Down Is Better\n\nAfter heroically saving a mother and newborn baby from a rooftop fire, Kidd (Miranda Rae Mayo) receives surprising news when she discovers she is being transferred out of the firehouse. Severide (Taylor Kinney) and Casey (Jesse Spencer) believe something is off about the turn of events, prompting them to investigate the situation. Otis (Yuri Sardarov) and Herrmann (David Eigenberg) discuss the possibilities of taking over a rundown bar and Dawson's frustration with her father, Ramon (Daniel Zacapa), reaches a boiling point.\n\nAn Even Bigger Surprise\n\nLt. Casey (Jesse Spencer) gets off on the wrong foot with Sam Mullins (guest star John Gatins), a temporary Chief who is filling in for Boden (Eamonn Walker) at House 51 for the morning. When Casey later makes a risky move in an attempt to save a distraught man from jumping off a building, Mullins has a surprise that Casey does not expect. Mouch (Christian Stolte) flies in Cruz's (Joe Minoso) brother Leon (guest star Jeff Lima) as a birthday surprise, but the rest of the squad struggles to keep it a secret. Meanwhile, Brett (Kara Killmer) is caught off guard when she learns new information about her hometown friend Hope (guest start Eloise Mumford).\n\nSacred Ground\n\nIn the season 8 premiere, the mattress factory fire spirals out of control. Truck and squad lay it on the line in hopes of getting the trapped victims out alive.\n\nIt Wasn't Enough\n\nWith most of the squad still trapped inside the burning warehouse fire, Chief Boden (Eamonn Walker) makes a risky last minute decision in an effort to save his men. Dawson (Monica Raymund) continues to deal with her father (guest star Daniel Zacapa), who has new plans for himself. Brett's (Kara Killmer) childhood friend Hope (guest star Eloise Mumford) visits the Windy City and strikes the attention of someone within the firehouse, while Kidd (Miranda Rae Mayo) goes head to head with her landlord. Meanwhile, a fire at a high school hits close to home for Boden.\n\nIgnite on Contact\n\nAfter learning the school fire wasn't an accident, Chief Boden (Eamonn Walker) turns up the pressure on Severide (Taylor Kinney) and Casey (Jesse Spenser) to investigate the cause of the fire that trapped his wife. Fueled by a competitive bet against Firehouse 87, Mouch (Christian Stolte) pushes all of the wrong buttons in his need to win the competitive challenge known as the firefighter muster. Meanwhile, as Kidd (Miranda Rae Mayo) settles into her new living arrangement, her unresolved feelings prompt her to question the intentions of newcomer Hope (guest star Eloise Mumford)."
