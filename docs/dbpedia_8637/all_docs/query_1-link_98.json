        "meta_description": "An immensely likable semi-screwball comedy from the director of &quot;The Big Chill,&quot; &quot;Mumford&quot; follows the adventures of an engaging charlatan psychotherapist (Loren Dean) fleeing a sleazy former life, who names himself after the town (Mumford) in which he settles and helps a lot of troubled people, even though he is without credentials. His most endearing client (Jason Lee) is a warm, fuzzy billionaire computer nerd who loves to skateboard but finds it's lonely at the top. Mumford's moral ambiguity (he's both a hero and a fraud) keeps this delightful Frank Capraesque fable of self-invention from becoming too sappy. &#151; Stephen Holden",

        "text": "Lawrence Kasdan's likable semi-screwball comedy ''Mumford'' has two big pluses on its side. In tackling psychotherapy, a subject Hollywood has traditionally treated with a quaking solemnity, it sustains a tone that is refreshingly commonsensical and irreverent.\n\nThe movie's enigmatic hero (Loren Dean), who renamed himself Mumford after the town to which he has moved to start a new life as a therapist, is almost as astonished as his clients are by how quickly he is able to change their lives for the better. But as he admits halfway into the movie, he is a charlatan with no therapeutic training. The credentials on his office wall are as bogus as his name.\n\nIn creating a heroic therapist who turns out to be a fraud but still ends up a good guy, ''Mumford'' is paradoxically subversive. While the movie appears to be enthusiastically pro-therapy (Mumford's intuitive, offbeat approach to people's problems works wonders), it is also anti-therapist in its implication that in the age of ''Oprah'' any sensitive person who is a good listener could conceivably establish a successful practice without the benefits of training or certification.\n\nThe film's other big plus is Mumford's endearing star client, Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee). A bushy-haired billionaire man-child whose company produces 23 percent of the world's modems, Skip is the very model of a computer nerd who is richer than God. A perpetual adolescent, Skip likes to whiz around the town on a skateboard. The headquarters of his company, Panda Modem (named after his favorite animal), has its own elaborately contoured skateboarding area.\n\nIf ''Mumford'' were a 40's movie, you could imagine Skip being played by the gangly young James Stewart with every other phrase out of his mouth a quaveringly sincere ''gosh'' or ''aw shucks.'' (Mumford would have to be played by Cary Grant.) But Skip isn't quite that naive. He's canny enough to recognize that women have pursued him for his money but pure enough at heart not to be tempted. He is also desperately lonely: so lonely, in fact, that he has set about devising a technological solution to his romantic travails. His top-secret work in progress is a line of robotic sex surrogates that are virtually indistinguishable from flesh-and-blood humans.\n\nAs it happens, all the townspeople seeking Mumford's counsel are sexually and romantically blocked. The movie opens in a delightfully off-kilter way with a black-and-white 1950's-style film-noir spoof that turns out to be the pulp-fiction fantasy of one of Mumford's clients, Henry Follett (Pruitt Taylor Vince). Follett is in despair that real life can never match his Barbara Stanwyck meets Frederick's of Hollywood vision of down-and-dirty pleasure. Whenever the movie threatens to become too serious, it dips back into Follett's overheated fantasies for the sheer fun of it.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
