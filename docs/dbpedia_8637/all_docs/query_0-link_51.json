        "text": "With the unfortunate instance of one-season-wonder My Name Is Earl defeating five-season-epic Angel in the Best EVER TV Show 2006 Tournament, I'm left with conflicted feelings. I'm never actually watched an episode of Earl (I hate watching TV as it doesn't cater to my schedule and I'm not rich enough to afford the high end TV stuff that andythesaint has) but I've always been a Jason Lee fan. He's one of those actors that can tip the scales for me when it comes to desiring to watch a movie. \"Stealing Harvard? Isn't Tom Green in that? Didn't Freedy Got Fingered suck ass?\" \"Yeah, but Jason Lee stars in it!\" \"Really? Hmmm... maybe I DO want to see it.\"\n\nAnyways, here's my Top Five Jason Lee Movies list. Hopefully it doesn't seem too similiar to andythesaint's two year old list. Feel free to contribute your own Top Five (Insert Actor / Actress' Name Here) List too! You don't even have to be as anal-retentive with links like I am.\n\nHonourable Mentions - Mumford, Dogma, Kissing A Fool\n\n5. The Incredibles - Combine the animation geniusosity over at Pixar with Lee's unabashed appreciation for geekdom and you have a part tailor-made to Lee's trademark delivery style. A bit nasally, a bit over-wordy, louder than a normal person, but still infused with that boyish charm that Lee is known for. Playing the evil super-villain Syndrome as tongue-in-cheek as the script called for is one thing, but being completely believable as a young boy is another. Kudos to the animation team for giving Syndrome some of Lee's mannerisms whilst speaking.\n\nMy review\n\n4. Almost Famous - Generally a band is only as strong as its lead singer appears to be. With Lee's Jeff Bebe at the mic, Stillwater were primed to climb to the top of the charts in Cameron Crowe's autobiographical love letter to his rock journalism youth. Bebe's both charismatic and an asshole, but you still can't hate him because Lee always brings the everyman quality to his roles. Plus, you'll find it tough to hate a character that seems to be getting the short end of the stick when it comes to the popularity of his own band.\n\nMy review\n\n3. A Guy Thing - Loving stupid romantic comedies is one of many guilty pleasures I have when it comes to movie watching. Lee stars oppostie Julia Stiles and (ugh) Selma Blair in a rom-com all about a regular guy that lets one little white lie turn into a ball of ridiculous half-truths. It's a fun little movie, but it would be absolutely nothing without Lee's over the top performance as Paul Morse, a guy who finds himself questioning his own romantic choices while heading to the altar. Extra credit to Lee for not mugging throughout the movie ala Jim Carrey.\n\nMy review\n\n2. Mallrats - Much like Ben Affleck, Lee's best performances are more often than not in a Kevin Smith film. With only one previous acting credit behind him, Lee left the pro skateboarding circuit (or whatever the hell it's called) to play Brodie Bruce, a comic book-loving, Sega-hockey playing, women-scorning idiot. Lee hits all the right notes - and volumes - as he treks around the mall on a mission to forget the girl that just broke up with him. If only he had a better straight man to play off of.\n\nMy review\n\n1. Chasing Amy - Speaking of straight men to play off of, Lee finds his acting partner in Ben Affleck in Kevin Smith's best movie (to date, as Clerks II doesn't open 'til this weekend). Playing Banky Edwards, a comic book tracer inker who works with his childhood friend Holden McNeil (Affleck) in publishing a fan-favourite independent comic book. Dealing with Holden's burgeoning romance with lesbian Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams) and dealing with questions about his own sexuality, Lee's Banky is a man of many faces. A wise-cracking sidekick, a misogynistic homophobe, a bile-spewing well-meaning friend, or just a guy who hasn't figured himself out yet, Lee is convincing and entertaining throughout the entire film.\n\nKeywords:jason_lee, lists, movies\n\nMood:depressed\n\nSites and Sounds:Dwight Yoakam - Watch Out"
