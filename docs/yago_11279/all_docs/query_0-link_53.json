        "text": "In the Old Hollywood era of well-dressed leading men, Edmund Lowe stood out as a gentleman with a quip, at ease in films of society or everyday life. Often Lowe portrayed detectives or lawyers in crime dramas. However, he played a variety of roles with a skill for comedy. Some of his most remembered movies are those he made with Victor McLaglen. No matter the role, Edmund Lowe’s characterizations had a well-mannered personality and a touch of sarcasm, combining eloquence and humor.\n\nAn Artistic Beginning\n\nEdmund Lowe didn’t come from a show business family, but he had an education early in life. He was born in San Jose, California and according to his obituary in the New York Times, he was one of 13 children and his father was a lawyer and judge. With a namesake reportedly chosen by his mother, after Edmund Dantes from the novel The Count of Monte Crisco by Alexander Dumas, culture appeared to be part of his upbringing. He graduated from Santa Clara University with a Bachelor of Arts at the age of 18, as reported by Time magazine in 1930. After completing his Jesuit education, he taught English there for a year. A growing interest in acting led him to change careers.\n\nLowe joined a stock company in San Francisco to learn his craft and later performed supporting roles on Broadway. While he made his film debut in 1915, he didn’t gain recognition until the 1920s. In 1924, he signed a contract with Fox and despite the absence of sound, emitted a heartfelt impression. He starred alongside well-knowns of the period, including Warner Baxter, Corrine Griffith, Colleen Moore and George O’Brien. San Pedro News Pilot on August 28, 1926, called Lowe “one of the most sincere screen players in America.” That same year he co-starred in What Price Glory (1926) as WWI marine Sergeant Quirt, with Victor McLaglen, who portrayed Captain Flagg, as friendly rivals competing for the affection of Dolores del Rio. The movie originated the quip “Sez you!” “Yeah! Sez me!”\n\nFinesse of a Leading Man\n\nThe transition to sound boosted Lowe’s career. Even when he played troubled characters, Lowe gave them a combination of believability and grace. As a gambler in Transatlantic (1931), featuring Myrna Loy, Healdsburg Tribune noted his ability to be “convincing as the light-hearted and light-fingered gentleman who lives by his wits.” Throughout the 1930s, Lowe starred in several mysteries, yet he wasn’t the typical detective. Sometimes he was a magician, such as The Spider (1931) and Chandu the Magician (1932). Other times he was an insurance investigator or movie star detective, as seen in Grand Exit (1935) co-starring Ann Sothern and Mad Holiday (1936) co-starring Elissa Landi respectively. His movies with McLaglen were also memorable with sequels of Quirt and Flagg. Others included The Great Hotel Murder (1935) with McLaglen as a detective and Lowe as a mystery novelist, while Under Pressure (1935) had the two as underground construction workers, known as sand hogs.\n\nIn 1935, Lowe experienced tragedy when his wife, film actress and former Ziegfeld Follies dancer, Lilyan Tashman, died from cancer at the age of 37. Earlier they had been known as a fashionable Hollywood couple, but Lowe was private about his grief for most of his life. He told the Long Island Daily Press on December 29, 1935, “We were—if I may say so—a perfect balance for each other. She was impetuous, vibrant with life, always eager for experience, tremendously emotional. I am calmer, slow at making decisions, more cautious. Yet we had an enormous amount in common. We loved the same things, art, music, animals, even football. We liked smart places, beautiful clothes, the simple thrill of the out-of-doors, long morning canters in the hills or sailing before a stiff breeze. . . ”\n\nBeyond the “Gentleman” Typecast\n\nOff-screen, Edmund Lowe enjoyed sports and music. In 1928, San Pedro News Pilot reported that Lowe played handball in between scenes with director Dave Butler. Also, Corsair in 1932 reported he played the piano, oboe and clarinet. Later, Edmund Lowe participated in a charity baseball game at Wrigley Field in July 1939 by playing on the Leading Men team, with Gene Raymond as captain and Preston Foster as manager. The opposing team was Comedians with Buster Keaton as captain and Jimmy Durante as manager.\n\nIn the 1940s, Lowe continued to be seen in crime dramas. Some of the comedies he also appeared in include the William Powell and Myrna Loy vehicle I Love You Again (1940) as Powell’s old friend and Double Date (1941) as a widower considering marriage opposite Una Merkel. One of his most notable movies was the 10th starring feature with McLaglen, Call Out the Marines (1942), as characters resembling Quirt and Flagg, who re-enlist and uncover a spy ring. The Australian Riverine Herald summarized the duo as “the team to signal fast action and fun.” From 1941-42, Lowe and McLaglen were heard on Sunday evenings on the NBC radio show, Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt."
