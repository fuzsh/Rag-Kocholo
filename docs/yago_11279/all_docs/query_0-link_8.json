        "text": "Edmund Lowe was an American actor. Although known for his somewhat flamboyant personality and purple ties (1920's code for homosexual), he was also married three times - and for fairly decent lengths of time. Historian William J. Mann noted that Lowe's second marriage to Lilyan Tashman (1925-1934), was a \"lavender marriage\" of convenience - both being at least bi-sexual if not homosexual. Further research will be needed.\n\nDocuments:\n\nNewspaper Articles:\n\nOakland Tribune (Oakland, California) - August 12, 1926\n\nScreen Actors to Sail on Honeymoon\n\nLOS ANGELES, Aug. 12. -(AP)- Edmund Lowe and his wife, Lilyan Taschman, who were married over a year ago, will leave here Friday for a European tour on a belated honeymoon. The screen stars will sail from New York to England and intend to visit France, Italy, Spain and Germany\n\nOakland Tribune (Oakland, California) - May 17, 1931\n\nEdmund Lowe and Lilyan Lowe, nee Tashman, want to pick up art objects in Spain, Italy and France. Lilyan also desires to improve her French as she has had numerous opportunities to play roles where perfection in the language would have improved her work.\n\nCensus Records:\n\n2102 California Street, San Francisco, California - April 23, 1910\n\nSurname Given Name Relation Age Status Born Father Born Mother Born Immigration Occupation Industry L'Hommedieu Gertrude Head 37 single California New York Ireland .
