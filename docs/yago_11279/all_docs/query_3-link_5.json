        "text": "Lilyan Tashman was an American stage, silent movie, and early \"talkie\" actress. She was born in New York City. She won notice as a vaudevillian in the Zeigfield Follies. Her first movie was Experience in 1921. This was followed by many others. She often played the bitchy \"other woman\". Tashman was a lesbian and looked for sex with other women in public restrooms.[1] She had a long term affair with Greta Garbo.[2] She married vaudevillian Al Lee and, later, openly gay actor Edmund Lowe. Their parties were the talk and the scandal of early Hollywood. Tashman died of cancer in 1934. Her last film, Frankie and Johnny, was released after her death in 1936.\n\nOther websites\n\n[change | change source]"
