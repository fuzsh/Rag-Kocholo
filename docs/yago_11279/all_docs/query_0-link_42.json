        "text": "Edmund Dantes Lowe (March 3, 1890 – April 21, 1971) was an American actor. His formative experience began in vaudeville and silent film.\n\nSpouses:\n\nEsther Miller (div. 1925)\n\nLilyan Tashman (1925–1934) her death\n\nRita Kaufman (1936–1950)\n\nHe was born in San Jose, California. His father was a local judge. His childhood home was at 314 North 1st Street, San Jose. He attended Santa Clara College and entertained the idea of becoming a priest before starting his acting career.\n\nHe died in Woodland Hills, California of lung cancer.\n\nFilm career\n\nEdmund Lowe's career included over 100 films in which he starred as the leading man. He is best remembered for his role as Sergeant Quirt in the 1926 movie, What Price Glory. (Lowe reprised his role from the movie in the radio program Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt, broadcast on the Blue Network September 28, 1941 - January 25, 1942, and on NBCFebruary 13, 1942 - April 3, 1942.) Making a smooth transition to talking pictures he remained popular but by the mid '30s he was no longer a major star although he occasionally played leading man to the likes of Jean Harlow, Mae West, and Claudette Colbert. He remained a valuable supporting actor at the major studios while continuing in leads for such \"Poverty Row\" studios as Columbia Pictures where his skills could bolster low budget productions. He also starred in 35 episodes of the 1950s television show, Front Page Detective and appeared as the elderly lead villain in the first episode of Maverick opposite James Garner in 1957.\n\nMarriages\n\nAfter his first marriage to Esther Miller ended in early 1925, Lowe met Lilyan Tashman (1896–1934) while filming Ports of Call. Lowe and Tashman were wed on September 21, 1925. The wedding occurred before the release of the film. The two made their home in Hollywood.\n\nLowe's third wife was costume designer Rita Kaufman (1888–1968). They were married from 1936 to 1940.\n\nPartial filmography"
