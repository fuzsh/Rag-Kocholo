Her very life was a sky-rocket; she rose suddenly in brilliance, shone against the clouds – and disappeared when the brilliance was at its height.”.... Photoplay Managing Editor Margaret E. Sangster\n\nLilyan Tashman was born October 23, 1896 in Brooklyn, New York. She was the tenth and final child born to Maurice and Rose Tashman. Blessed with striking features, large, smouldering eyes, brassy blond hair and a beaming smile, throughout her teens she worked as a model for both fashion magazines and artists.\n\nTashman first appeared on the vaudeville stage also when she was in her late teens and quickly became a very skilled performer, earning a spot in the Ziegfeld Follies. She remained with the Follies until her screen debut in 1921, the film now presumed lost, Experience with Richard Barthelmess.\n\nLilyan chose to free-lance throughout the 1920s, just appearing in the films that she chose. Naturally gifted with a confident air of nonchalant sophistication, unabashed sexiness and a snarky wit, Lilyan in supporting roles became known and much in demand for her scene-stealing film performances. She eventually signed a contract with Paramount Studios in 1931.\n\nLilyan married fellow actor Edmund Lowe in 1925, the pair became the 'darlings' of Hollywood reporters and their gossip magazines. The couple were known for their lavish parties, “Hollywood wouldn’t be Hollywood if Eddie and Lilyan Tashman didn’t give at least one swell party every month,” one columnist quipped.\n\nThey also had lively gatherings at their Malibu beach house which, like their Beverly Hills home, was celebrated for its striking modern décor.\n\nAlways drawing attention when out-and-about the fashionable pair were described as “...the epitome of what the smart man and woman should wear”, Lilyan the “undisputed queen of chic”.\n\nLilyan received her first rave review for her role in Bright Lights (1925) now a lost film... “one of the screen’s most beautiful blondes and in her first comedy role, gives a finished performance”. Now in hot demand, over the next three years the popular starlet appeared in over 20 films.\n\nWith the onset of the talkies, Lilyan made a smooth transition, having a distinctive throaty drawl which was perfectly suited for the wise-cracking early 1930s film femme, she went on to make 28 talking pictures. In 1932 Lilyan suddenly slowed down her cinematic career, anaemic and continually underweight her physical health was slowly deteriorating. Sadly abdominal cancer had progressed far beyond the best of help.\n\nLilyan Tashman passed away on March 21, 1934 in New York City. She was only 37 years old, her burial in Brooklyn's Washington Cemetery attracted a bursting crowd of 10,000 grieving fans and mourners...\n\nDo you have any film favourites or thoughts to share on Lilyan Tashman?...\n\nMurder by the Clock (1931) an old house mystery populated by creepy characters, notably Irving Pichel’s Philip Endicott and dark story elements. The film is dominated by Lilyan Tashman’s twisted character often described as a modern Lady Macbeth. Slinking through several different costumes, each more formfitting than the last, the sultry villainess manipulates and masterminds a series of crimes having teased and lured the male characters into a frenzied state.\n\nTashman’s blatant use of sex to get what she wants was years ahead of the times, her daring performance here possibly the most voluptuous classic film femme fatale of all...\n\nGirls About Town (1931) from George Cukor is a delightful Pre-code comedy that features a stellar cast. Lilyan Tashman stars alongside Kay Francis, the pair of gold-digging escorts are wonderfully styled in Travis Banton gowns, Tashman's expressive last line exemplifies her on and off screen persona..."
