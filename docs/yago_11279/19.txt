Edmund Lowe was an American actor. Although known for his somewhat flamboyant personality and purple ties (1920's code for homosexual), he was also married three times - and for fairly decent lengths of time. Historian William J. Mann noted that Lowe's second marriage to Lilyan Tashman (1925-1934), was a "lavender marriage" of convenience - both being at least bi-sexual if not homosexual. Further research will be needed.
