Film career

Making a smooth transition to talking pictures he remained popular but by the mid '30s he was no longer a major star although he occasionally played leading man to the likes of Jean Harlow, Mae West, and Claudette Colbert. He remained a valuable supporting actor at the major studios while continuing in leads for such "Poverty Row" studios as Columbia Pictures where his skills could bolster low budget productions. He also starred in 35 episodes of the 1950s television show, Front Page Detective and appeared as the elderly lead villain in the first episode of Maverick opposite James Garner in 1957.
