        "text": "This doctoral dissertation seeks to describe and explain the human factors that influenced the spatial distribution of Arab settlements in the Plain of Sharon and Samaria/Jabal Nablūs (hereinafter: Jabal Nablūs), which together form its area of study (hereinafter: AoS). More specifically, it explores the geographical, social and economic features of the Arab settlements in the AoS between the years 1700 – 1948 CE. In doing so, the study outlines the settlement processes, identifying the places of origin of the settlers and clarifying the circumstances of their arrival in the AoS. Furthermore, it describes the tenurials of land ownership, possession and use at the family, village and regional levels. The work won the Middle East & Islamic Studies Association of Israel (MEISAI)'s 2023 award for outstanding Ph.D. dissertation.\n\nThe following PhD project deals with the Arab settlement processes in the Sharon Plain and Western Samaria during the Late Ottoman and British Mandate Periods. Following two hundred years of demographic decline, in the eighteenth century, these regions experienced a prolonged period of settlement expansion, involving multiple population movements from diverse origins, village formation and abandonment. The precise causes of these transformations have yet to be satisfactorily explained. The state of current research: Traditionalist Israeli scholarship has portrayed the Sharon prior to Zionist colonization as a barren land, dotted here and there by Bedouin tents and a few scattered hamlets. The Zionist project is regarded as the principal source of progress, technological development, and socioeconomic modernization. More recently, other conceptualizations have emerged, describing the region as having significant native populations, or as the prime destination for external migrations from the mountainous hinterland or from other coastal and steppe peripheries. Due to the perceived paucity of accessible native sources, researchers have long relied on Western Travelers' Literature and other foreign sources as a staple for their craft. Over the last decades, however, increased corpora of native evidence became recognized or accessible. These sources contain rich cartographic, archaeological, archival and ethnographic evidence, which still awaits scholarly attention.\n\nCombining historical sources with the survey data we document the Bedouin transition from pastoralism to an economy based more on agriculture than animal husbandry. The construction of structures, first baikas and later houses, is evidence for a presumed reduction in mobility. This shift towards an agricultural economy was in part facilitated by the Fellahin/villagers who were hired by the Bedouin to assist in the harvest. This shift and consequential decline in mobility, however, is voluntary and not a result of direct coercion by the Mandate government.\n\nThe Bedouin of the Middle East have been one of the region's most marginalized groups in modern times. This study assesses the interplay between state policies and the Bedouin in the last 150 years, from a comparative standpoint. We examine the development of land laws in the Middle East as they have affected the Bedouin, from the enactment of the Ottoman land laws of 1858 up to the present. Moreover we explore whether the land laws and the fate of the Bedouin are associated with the characteristics of the regime in each country. We find that the imposition of land laws and policies directed at nomadic and sedentarizing Bedouins has depended on disparate factors such as the origins of the leadership of countries (i.e. Bedouin or non-Bedouin) and the social and economic models embraced. Regimes with origins in the tribal-Bedouin fabric of the Middle East have pursued land policies that were favorable to the Bedouin, whereas regimes drawing their strength from urban elites and with socialist outlooks encouraged very different policies. We also consider whether the case of the Bedouin in Israel is unique or reflects a larger regional context."
