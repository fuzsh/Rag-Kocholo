I then give an analysis of the papyrus text. I sometimes give more lines for context than there are in the papyrus, as papyri are so often torn at an inconvenient place in the text.\n\nI follow several somewhat arbitrary but generally accepted conventions. I print both texts with lowercase script except for proper names; accents and breathing marks, including in reconstructed portions of text; iota adscript instead of subscript; and the two forms of lowercase sigma. Square brackets ([ ]) indicate where the papyrus has been torn away; a dot under a letter indicates that its reading is not certain. Sometimes there is an extended portion of a line where no letters can be made out; in such a case the space will be either blank or filled with dots, corresponding roughly to the number of “missing” letters. In these cases I also bracket the English translation, as an approximate way of showing how much (but rarely which actual Greek words) of a particular line is missing in the papyrus.\n\nI indicate where the papyrus reading differs from the Teubner by underlining all differences, including any “plus verses,” and this both in the Greek and in the English. This allows the reader to see easily not only the “plus verses,” but also how much other variation there is in the immediate context. Of course we cannot always be certain of the correctness of a particular reconstruction—it is quite possible that if we had more of a particular line of a papyrus surviving, it might differ substantially from our current conjecture, hence resulting in a papyrus even more “eccentric” than we had previously supposed.\n\nNeedless to say, my “defense” of some of these seemingly “eccentric” readings is not going to change the mind of anyone who has already decided in advance, as evidently had Bolling and van der Valk, that there could never be more than one “correct” reading in a given passage. But for those who have come to agree with Parry and Lord’s understanding of oral poetry, its composition, performance, and transmission, the following analyses should seem hardly surprising or threatening; rather, I see them as a case of the evidence supporting the theory, and vice versa.\n\nThere are several questions that I have discussed previously, and which come to the fore now as we look at these passages of the Iliad. What does it mean to say that a line has been “interpolated”? We may have an idea of how and why it came to be in this specific location, but does that mean that it does not “belong” there now? How do the canons of textual criticism apply in these situations? For Bolling and others, the external evidence has nearly always seemed to be primary. But why should internal evidence be downplayed? And if the passage seems to read “better” without a given line and “worse” with it, should this, in the case of Homer, automatically mean that the line gets cut from the text? Don’t performers perform “better” on some occasions than others, and while we may have a preference, is that the same as judging a reading to be “right” or “wrong”? For some these questions may have easy and decisive answers. But back to the text.\n\nThe reconstruction of the beginning of line 302 ὣς ἔφαν εὐχόμενοι, ‘thus they spoke, praying’, occurs only in Iliad X 295 (although the singular participle occurs much more frequently): there Odysseus and Diomedes pray specifically to Athena, at some length, and she hears and in effect answers their prayers. Here the prayers are to Zeus, for any breaking of the oaths to be avenged. The “vulgate” has no mention of prayer, nor of Zeus thundering, just his reluctance to grant fulfillment to their wishes. In the papyrus, it appears that the poet continues with the idea of prayer; the verb κτυπέω is fairly rare, and generally seems to indicate trouble for one group, and maybe success for the other. But in Iliad XV 377, Zeus hears the prayer of Nestor, then ἔκτυπε ‘crashed, thundered’ to show he has heard his prayer; however he then gives help to the Trojans rather than the Greeks.\n\nLine 302d has Priam as its subject; the Trojan preparation for the oaths has occurred in lines 245–258, so again it is not incongruous that Priam has finished his oath at this point. What is more interesting is the way in which the papyrus seems to emphasize Priam’s fear of seeing his son Paris fight against Menelaus. In line 304 the papyrus has Priam talking only to Trojans and Trojan allies, as opposed to both Trojans and Greeks in the “vulgate.” 304a adds a personal touch about Priam’s internal unease, and in 306 the papyrus uses a potential optative rather than the future indicative, seeming to contribute to the emotional instability of Priam.\n\nThinking of the two versions from a performance perspective, one can imagine a singer on a particular occasion getting a heightened sense of the drama of the upcoming duel—it is clear after all that Paris is the weaker fighter; he has been allotted first strike, meaning he is going be the loser, so to speak; and so our particular singer gives Paris two spears, as well as making not Menelaus but his armor “warlike”; and then giving Menelaus four lines instead of one for his arming. These are variations that would seem perfectly natural as a way of performing this particular episode at a higher emotional level than on some other occasion.\n\nIn line 286, Hecuba, rather than just μολοῦσα ‘going’, rather does not disobey, and quickly calls her maidservants, intensifying the more mundane “vulgate” version. The formulaic phrase οὐδ᾽ ἀπίθησ᾽ occurs about twenty-five times in Homer, generally of Hera, Iris, Thetis, and Zeus, but also of humans such as Achilles and Agamemnon. The only other human female it is used of is Eurycleia in Odyssey xxii 492, after being ordered by Odysseus to assist with cleaning the hall after the deaths of the suitors. For a listener familiar with that story this has to add to the power of the phrase being used in this present context. One is also reminded of Telemachus and Penelope, but even then Penelope is not spoken of as ‘not disobeying’ her son.\n\nIn the two following lines, 287 and 288, we notice two seemingly minor textual variants (I pass over κηωίεντα for now): ἀόλλισσαγ κατὰ and θάλαμογ κατεβήσετο. These are clear examples of spelling reflecting pronunciation (in these two cases assimilation of a nasal to the following velar stop), in a way that presumably would not happen if the lines were being dictated slowly and carefully. Rather I suggest that these spellings convey the memory of a live performance, with all its speed and dramatic intensity.\n\nLine 288b and the following lines recall Odyssey xv 104, where Helen is taking the finest robe from her treasure chests as a gift for Telemachus. She too is called there δῖα γυναικῶν; and there is the added connection that Hecuba’s robes came from the same journey that Paris was on when he brought back Helen to Troy. It is as if the poet, aware that he will soon be telling of the finest robe that Hecuba must give to Athena, the one that ἀστὴρ δ᾽ ὣς ἀπέλαμπεν ‘shone like a star’ and ἔκειτο δὲ νείατος ἄλλων ‘lay underneath all the rest’ (Iliad VI 295), makes a link to the robe of Helen with those same words (Odyssey xv 108), and hence Hecuba becomes like Helen for a brief moment. But what pains Helen brought to Hecuba! And those pains are being brought into the present context by means of the allusion to Priam in Iliad book XXIV.\n\nI note without comment the several small variations in lines 569–573; although in line 578 we see another example of assimilation, this time τόρ ῥα for τόν ῥα, reflecting the realities of oral performance rather than scribal dictation.\n\nThe charming fly simile is virtually the same in both versions; but when we get to the body of Patroclus, the papyrus has given Patroclus the epithet μεγαλήτορι ‘great hearted’, as well as the words τὸν δὲ κίχανεν//κείμενον ‘and he reached him//as he lay there’. There seems to be some special care being shown towards Patroclus, although dead; there are four separate verbs relating to standing, reaching, going, as well as the comment that the ‘din of weapons arose around him’, to stress the fight going on for his body. Finally we get the spear throw that has been “delayed” from the second half of line 574 to the second half of line 574b.\n\nAs with Patroclus, the papyrus version seems to emphasize the pathos of the death of Podes, although since the papyrus stops at line 578b we cannot be sure whether the word φόβονδε was in the next few lines. But the slightly more detailed description of the shield not stopping the spear, and of the spear going through Podes’ lower belly, suggest a somewhat greater emotional involvement on the part of the poet.\n\nNote: 17.578ab = 5.538–539, which refer to the killing of Deïcoön son of Pergasus, by Agamemnon. In each case the warrior killed is honored greatly, and his death evokes some amount of pity. I also note several cases of acoustical assimilation: ἐγ for ἐν in 569 and 578b; μιμ for μιν in 574a; τόρ for τόν in line 578. As suggested previously, these represent the way the language was heard rather than seen, and so hold clues as to performance aspects of the Iliad and Odyssey.\n\nIn this short examination of a handful of so-called “eccentric” Ptolemaic texts, we have seen that, far from being the result of careless scribal activity, what we are looking at can be viewed as functioning as a transcript of a live performance, and not only that, but a performance in which the “performer” could and did choose to heighten the emotional level by means of such things as variation in word choice, and intertextual links to other Homeric episodes; since a line of verse does not “operate” in isolation (or a vacuum), “importing” it into what may appear to be a “new” location has the effect of bringing with that line all of its thematic connections and connotations, which, in the “hands” of a skilled performer, can add power and emotion to an already dramatic performance. So our Ptolemaic papyri preserve much more than variant readings; they contain indications of the reality of live performances, of a performer’s ability to “vary” his performance―in short, of multitextuality.\n\nFootnotes"
