        "text": "The newly discovered Es Sbeita visitors book includes the signatures of a number of people who visited the Colt excavations in Shivta between 1934 and 1937. Many of these visitors were H. Dunscombe Colt’s colleagues and friends who previously worked with him in Sir Flinders Petrie's excavation at Tell el-Ajjul such as James Leslie Starkey, the excavator of Tel Lachish and his assistant, Olga Tufnell. Other scholars included Dominican researchers from the École Biblique in Jeruaslem and groups of German researchers, among them most notably Fritz Frank in 1934, as well as members of the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum. One of the most interesting aspects of the visitors book is the number of Arab nationalist leaders such as Aref al Aref and George Antonius and educators who visited the site, whom, according to Colt’s correspondence, he encouraged in order to disassociate his expedition from the caustic political developments of the mid-1930s that culminated in the events of 1938, the year that the expedition house at Shivta was burned and looted. It is notable that only one Jewish archaeologist, Michael Avi-Yonah, recorded his name. The pro-Zionist Scotsman, P.L.O. Guy, visited the site as director of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, with his wife, Yemima, the daughter of Eliezer Ben Yehuda, the person credited with the modern revival of the Hebrew language. Guy's anti-Zionist rival, Ernest T. Richmond, the head of the Palestine Department of Antiquities, was known to be closely associated with fellow visitor, L.H. Vincent, as well as Hajj Amin al Husseini, an Arab nationalist leader whose elevation to Mufti of Jerusalem Richmond had aided years earlier. The visitors book presents a virtual parade of diplomats and British colonial administrators visiting Shivta, including none other than the high commissioner of Palestine and Transjordan and commander in chief, Sir Arthur Grenfell Wauchope and his aides. The Es Sbaita visitors book sheds new light on the history of archaeological research in the region when it was still in a rather early stage of development, as well as the political and professional relationships of the many visitors to these isolated ruins in a particularly volatile era."
