        "text": "Egypt had a reputation in the Greco-Roman Mediterranean region as a gateway for disease—a source of pestilence that originated south of Egypt and spread north via the Nile River, an important transport axis, from the regions of inner Africa south of the first Nile cataracts or through the Red Sea (Fig. 1). Thucydides was not the first to attribute the origin of an epidemic to northeast Africa, specifically Aithiopia, but his narrative inspired subsequent ancient authors who imitated his account when reporting on the “plagues” of their time. It is important to investigate the veracity of those later accounts that also point to “Aithiopia” as the origin of pestilence. This is only possible with thorough investigation of all available sources, including the latest archaeological and archaeogenetic discoveries, as well as analysis of the Egyptian papyrological evidence.\n\nOf special significance is the role Egypt and the Red Sea most likely played in the spread of the Justinianic Plague (541–544 c.e.), the initial wave of the First Plague Pandemic. Archaeogenetics [End Page 163]\n\n[End Page 164]\n\nhave confirmed that the pathogenic agent of the Justinianic Plague and the First Plague Pandemic in the centuries that followed was true plague (either in bubonic, pneumonic, or septicemic form), caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. Knowledge of the pathogen responsible for the pandemic allows confident hypotheses relating to the epidemiology and ecology of plague, including environmental parameters, carriers, vectors, and the bacterium’s ultimate origin. Conversely, cases where the responsible pathogen is unknown, such as the Antonine Plague, rely heavily on limited and speculative analyses using ancient written evidence for retrospective diagnosis.1\n\nThis article delves into the discussion about disease events in the ancient Mediterranean region, with a specific focus on Egypt and civilizations of the western Indian Ocean (including the Red Sea). Critically examining the archaeology and scientific findings, exhaustively considering the papyrological sources, and disentangling literary topoi from actual observations significantly improves our understanding of Egypt’s role in the circulation of pathogens between Asia, Africa, and the Mediterranean.\n\n________\n\nAncient Egypt was considered disease-ridden by several of its neighboring cultures, including the Hittites, the Israelites, and the Greeks, who believed that epidemics were imported from Egypt. The disease that infected the Hittite king, Šuppiluliuma I, and his son remains unidentified, as is the pathogen responsible for the epidemic at the workmen’s village of Amarna. It could be that the Ebers medical papyrus from the second millennium b.c.e. [End Page 202] is describing bubonic plague, and the references to incurable and lethal “boils of Egypt” in Exodus and Deuteronomy might be doing the same. Rufus of Ephesus was almost certainly describing outbreaks of bubonic plague in early Roman Libya, Egypt, and Syria, as was Aretaeus in Cappadocia in the second century c.e. None of these regional epidemics developed into pandemics, as far as we know.\n\nThucydides’ narrative about the Plague of Athens and its origin in “Aithiopia” was particularly influential, with later authors describing contemporary pestilences by drawing on his account. The Antonine and Cyprianic plagues were similarly linked to Egypt or Aithiopia, but the evidence does not strongly tie their origins to northeast Africa, and nor has archaeogenetic research yet helped to answer where they emerged, let alone identify their pathogenic culprits. Conversely, the collective evidence for the Justinianic Plague does indeed point to the pandemic having first passed through Egypt on its way to the Mediterranean.\n\nThe papyri improve our understanding of ancient disease events in Egypt, but they do not significantly alter ongoing debates about societal or economic impacts of the pandemics or their origins. The papyri do, however, shed light on how epidemic events were documented in antiquity, that there were no references to disease (using loimos specifically) in the Hellenistic period, and that there is an apparent increase in mentions of pestilence starting in the early second century c.e.\n\nWe have on the one hand a powerful literary topos begun by Thucydides’ description of the Plague of Athens, and on the other, sufficient evidence from the beginning of history down to late antiquity that, in some cases, Egypt may in fact have acted as a gateway for pathogens spreading from south Asia, southern Arabia, or East Africa, by way of the Nile and/or Red Sea routes, northward to neighboring regions like Libya, the Levant, and the wider Mediterranean. It is thus important to consider the details of ancient disease events to discern whether authors relied on Thucydides’ description for origin and symptomatology or if references to Aithiopia as an epidemic’s birthplace align with other evidence.\n\nThat true plague reached northeast Africa long before the outbreak at Pelusium in 541 c.e. seems probable. Even though the Justinianic strain of Y. pestis probably emerged in the first [End Page 203] few centuries of the Common Era, accounts from ancient physicians lend to the idea that earlier strains may have passed through the Red Sea/northeast Africa. The descriptions suggest that the peoples of Egypt and Libya experienced symptoms that are highly suggestive of bubonic plague in late Hellenistic or early Roman times—an early period of contact between Egypt, Southern Arabia, and South Asia. Thus plague could have reached Egypt in the sixth century either directly from South Asia through Indian Ocean trade or from an African focus established in the early Roman period. Sixth-century authors may indeed have been recording accurate details on the origin of the Justinian Plague and not merely copying Thucydides.\n\nRecent research in archaeogenetics has narrowed historical gaps and provides pathways to investigate the interplay between human agency and environment. Genetic research on remains of presumed victims of the First Plague Pandemic illustrate the potential of molecular investigations in altering historiography. Similar analyses on human remains, particularly from Egypt, that are tentatively linked to other ancient pestilences, such as the Athenian, Hadrianic, Antonine, Septimian, and Cyprianic disease events, could provide information about ancient disease agents and the societies they influenced, as well as contribute to our collective understanding of pathogen evolution and epidemiology over time and space.
