        "text": "Practice Champions is a feature that debuted in November 2019 and appears in the AAAAI’s Practice Matters newsletter. It is a collaboration between the AAAAI Office of Practice Management and the Federation of Regional, State and Local Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Societies (RSLAAIS) Assembly. A Practice Champion is a community-based allergist / immunologist who has made a significant contribution to our specialty/community by any number of means. Allergist / immunologists will be recognized for their contributions above and beyond their everyday work. Allergist / immunologists are recognized for:\n\n• community service\n\n• care of patients with respect to housing, nutrition, employment and safety\n\n• initiatives to educate and facilitate any allergy treatment to patients in the community.\n\nNominate a Practice Champion today.\n\nAs of February 2024, Practice Champions will be named once per quarter rather than each month, but nominations are always welcome.\n\nEvery year, a Practice Champion of the Year is selected by a five member task force, to be recognized at the AAAAI Annual Meeting. The Practice Champion of the Year receives the same benefits as other AAAAI Honorary Award recipients: five night’s hotel lodging; two airfares and expense reimbursement, with complimentary registration fees at the AAAAI Annual Meeting.\n\nContinue reading for a list of the allergists who have been named Practice Champions:\n\nJune 2024\n\nBarbara Stark Baxter, MD, FAAAAI\n\nAn enlightening experience with an athletic injury at age 13 inspired Barbara Stark Baxter, MD, FAAAAI, to explore a career in medicine. A Smith College music major, Dr. Baxter performed in choral and piano concerts while in medical school at Columbia. A rotation in her fourth year of medical school introduced her to Robert Appleby, a pediatrician with a thriving practice who had launched a free clinic, inspiring her to explore service alongside her own medical practice.\n\nDr. Baxter graduated from Columbia in 1979 and moved to Dallas, TX, to train in internal medicine at UT Southwestern. She has served on the Board of Directors of Los Barrios Unidos Community Clinic almost continuously since 1983. That same year, she founded the Agape Clinic in the basement of Grace United Methodist Church. It has grown into a seven day per week operation in a 10,000 sq. ft. building with 10 full-time employees.\n\nAgape will provide more than 15,000 visits this year to a patient population that is 85% minority working poor, with many undocumented. The organization has won significant recognition for its work. It offers both primary and specialty care including allergy / immunology, women’s health, pediatrics, behavioral health, dental, LGBTQ care, vaccinations, eye care and dermatology, and provides outpatient teaching clinics to over 500 future healthcare professionals annually. Dr. Baxter has been medical director for 40 years.\n\nIn addition to her work at Agape, Dr. Baxter has served as volunteer faculty for allergy / immunology at UT Southwestern for 39 years and operates a solo practice in allergy / immunology in Dallas, where she has run clinical trials in her office for 12 years. Believing that every physician should be involved in addressing our obesity epidemic, Dr. Baxter also offers physician-supervised weight loss.\n\nMarch 2024\n\nGeorge R. Green, MD, FAAAAI, 1934-2024\n\nThe AAAAI mourns the loss of a great champion of independent practice, both in allergy / immunology and across medicine. Dr. George Green, MD, FAAAAI, served his patients and communities well beyond his own as a physician and allergist / immunologist for more than 50 years. He was a dedicated mentor to many through his practice, his involvement in related organizations and through his support of graduate medical education. An extraordinary volunteer and leader in state, local and national medical and specialty societies, Dr. Green served as a well-known and much-loved member of the American Medical Association House of Delegates (HOD) on behalf of the AAAAI for 25 years. Dr. Green worked tirelessly on behalf of allergist / immunologists, notably including efforts to protect in-office compounding of allergen extracts and small specialties’ engagement in the HOD.\n\nDr. James Sussman, DO, FAAAAI, nominated Dr. Green to be recognized as a Practice Champion: “He was an inspiring mentor as an internist and allergist during my residency, and we always enjoyed catching up during the AAAAI Annual Meeting. He frequently came to New Mexico in the summer to volunteer at the Gallup, NM Indian Health Service Hospital. He flew all the way from Philadelphia with his wife, piloting a small plane he shared with another doctor. Once getting to Albuquerque, his wife insisted on driving the last three hours to Gallup, because the heat rising from the desert floor created a much too exhilarating roller coaster ride in their small plane! On one visit, George graciously gave a dinner talk at our New Mexico Allergy Society meeting.”\n\nDr. Green’s legacy as a committed volunteer and representative of the specialty will not be forgotten.\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nJeffrey Leipzig, MD, FAAAAI\n\nMeet Practice Champion Jeffrey Leipzig, MD, FAAAAI. He is an advocate for his patients, his community, for the practice of allergy / immunology and for the ancient “Hopewell” Fortified Hill earthworks in Butler County, Ohio.\n\nDr. Leipzig was a solo practitioner at Alleviate Allergy & Asthma in Butler County, Ohio for 20 years. He strove to maintain a cutting-edge allergy practice and never forgot the importance of putting his patients first. \"Dr. Leipzig strives for excellence in every aspect of the practice. He is very liked and popular in the community. He demonstrates compassion for his patients and is an excellent teacher,” said his nominator.\n\nHe has thoroughly enjoyed being a clinical instructor for 3rd and 4th year medical students from Ohio University Heritage College of Medicine. Until recently, Dr. Leipzig was affiliated with Family Allergy & Asthma.\n\nDr. Leipzig graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio before earning a medical degree from The Ohio State University. He trained in pediatrics at the University of Louisville. He completed his fellowship at Saint Louis University under the direction of Dr. Raymond Slavin, a magnificent role model of the physician-scientist-educator. He is a diplomat of the American Board of Allergy Immunology. He has been a member of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology since 1995.\n\nDr. Leipzig has diligently served in organized medicine at both the local and state levels. As a First District Delegate of the Ohio State Medical Society, he has attended annual meetings since 2007. In 2015, Dr. Leipzig was instrumental in crafting changes in drug compounding regulations by the Ohio State Board of Pharmacy. In 2019, Dr. Leipzig joined with other physicians in Ohio to support the Epinephrine Accessibility Act to ease access to epinephrine auto-injectors. Currently, he is the chairman of the focused task force on state legislation for the OSMA. Dr. Leipzig was past president of the Cincinnati Allergy and Asthma Society and past president of Butler County Medical Society.\n\nDr. Leipzig is a devoted community leader and volunteer. For 25 years, he has been a member of the Great Miami Valley YMCA board of trustees and was past chairman. He was a member of the board of Community First Solutions, American Red Cross and local Head Start and volunteers for the summer concert series at RiversEdge amphitheater.\n\nAs a recipient of the Distinguished Historian Award, granted by the Butler County Historical Society, Dr. Leipzig was recognized for spearheading extraordinary efforts to preserve the ancient \"Hopewell\" Fortified Hill earthworks in Butler County, Ohio. The site is considered a Native American cultural treasure, similar to newly designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Ohio.\n\nWhether Dr. Leipzig is advocating for his patients, his community, the practice of allergy / immunology or for preservation of the past, Dr. Leipzig is a Practice Champion!\n\nDecember 2023\n\nAlice Hoyt, MD FAAAAI\n\nAlice Hoyt, MD FAAAAI, feels called to serve, “so food allergy families can live with less stress and more joy.” She is the founder of the Louisiana-based Hoyt Institute of Food Allergy, chair of the nationally recognized non-profit organization Code Ana and host of the top-ranked food allergy podcast Food Allergy and Your Kiddo. “The fear that food allergy is a mortality condition is very real because, in some patients, food allergy is a cause of death; and no matter how few patients that is, if your child has a food allergy, you likely worry that your child will be one of those few.” said Dr. Hoyt. “We as allergists and other allergy-informed healthcare providers can and must help these families.\"\n\nPrior to medical school, Dr. Hoyt earned a degree in nutrition, so she is well versed in navigating the complexities of food allergies. She then completed training and earned board-certifications in internal medicine, pediatrics and allergy / immunology.\n\nDuring her fellowship at the University of Virginia, Dr. Hoyt launched Code Ana, a now national allergy-focused non-profit organization. Code Ana offers medical emergency response training and epinephrine training to schools, centers and other organizations – vital services sought in 2015 by a school nurse in Charlottesville, VA. Through Dr. Hoyt’s work with this campus, the need for not just anaphylaxis and epinephrine education but also for school-focused, comprehensive medical emergency response planning was realized and led to the creation of Code Ana. Through its work with childcare centers, schools, parents and other organizations, along with its publications in academic medical journals and presentations at local, regional and national conferences, Code Ana is working on behalf of families everywhere. Through her volunteer work with Code Ana, Dr. Hoyt has become an expert on emergency medications in schools and has co-authored legislation in Ohio, Connecticut and Louisiana, advocating for increased access to stock epinephrine and evidence-based anaphylaxis education. She has shared her expertise with the AAAAI through her collaboration on \"The Need for Required Stock Epinephrine in All Schools: A Work Group Report of the AAAAI Adverse Reactions to Foods Committee,” found in JACI: In Practice, and led the development of the AAAAI’s \"Stock Epinephrine Toolkit” with Dr. Andrea Pappalardo. “All schools should have stock epinephrine auto-injectors,” says Dr. Hoyt.\n\nDr. Hoyt also hosts the top-ranked food allergy podcast Food Allergy and Your Kiddo, a source for tactical, family-focused, evidence-based food allergy information that offers its listeners peace of mind. “Top notch, expert analysis combined with friendly, inviting presentation. You’ll enjoy the information while feeling like you just had a conversation over tea with your neighbor,” offered one listener. Its recently featured articles and podcast episodes include \"Food Allergies and Shared Decision-Making: What Parents Must Know;\" \"The Risks of SLIT and OIT in Food Allergy – What You Need to Know;” and \"How to be a Food Allergy-Informed Parent.\"\n\nThe Hoyt Institute of Food Allergy offers its patients an online learning portal for evidence-based, family-focused, food allergy education, and Code Ana has served over 15,000 childcare and school professionals through Code Ana's Online Learning Portal. When asked what she’s most proud of, Dr. Hoyt says she is “most proud of our learners. I give so much because I’ve seen families go through so much. Food allergy is a 24/7 condition. I use my tools and talents to improve the lives of others.”\n\nNovember 2023\n\nSusan Laubach, MD, FAAAAI\n\nChildren living with food allergies and asthma in San Diego County and attending any of its 42 school districts benefit because Susan Laubach, MD, FAAAAI, lives nearby. “Standardizing the care children get is an important first step in improving equity. My passion is working with teams and coalitions to affect and improve the lives of those living in my community,” said Dr. Laubach. She is a physician in the Allergy / Immunology Division at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego and an associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics at UC San Diego. Dr. Laubach makes a difference, wherever she is, and is an AAAAI Practice Champion.\n\nIn 2018, Dr. Laubach convened a coalition of pediatricians and specialists, school nurses, parents and FARE colleagues to disseminate the AAP Allergy & Anaphylaxis Emergency Plan (AAEP) in San Diego County so all students at risk for anaphylaxis would receive the same care. To increase its use outside the public school system, Dr. Laubach has offered to write stock epinephrine prescriptions for private and charter schools that use the form. The AAEP was so widely accepted that school nurses asked for similar help with standardizing school asthma plans. The coalition modeled the new form, cleverly titled the Asthma Symptom Action Plan (ASAP), after the AAAAI School-based Asthma Management Program (SAMPRO™) Emergency Treatment Plan. Dr. Laubach worked tirelessly to make both forms accessible via electronic medical records which has helped standardize the care for over half a million children and ease the back-to-school burden for parents, schools and medical practices alike.\n\nOriginally from Stockton, California, Dr. Laubach graduated with honors from Stanford University with a degree in human biology before earning her medical degree from UC San Francisco School of Medicine. Moving to the east coast, she trained in pediatrics at New York’s Mount Sinai Medical Center and made a difference there. Dr. Laubach founded a palliative care service for children with life-threatening illnesses, fueled by a passion she developed as a counselor at Camp Okizu, a camp for children with cancer and their siblings in northern California.\n\nFollowing her fellowship at Duke University, Dr. Laubach was honored to serve active duty, dependent and retired military service members in the Department of Allergy/Immunology at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC. In 2011, she joined the Allergy & Asthma Medical Group and Research Center in San Diego, which became affiliated with UC San Diego and Rady Children's Hospital in 2014. Since that time, her patients, and those of her colleagues have contributed to research and clinical trials and have witnessed the advent of new medications to treat allergy, based upon this clinical work.\n\nOctober 2023\n\nLee S. Clore, Jr., MD, FAAAAI\n\nLee S. Clore, Jr., MD, FAAAAI, specializes in adult and pediatric allergy, asthma and immunology and has practiced in Owensboro, Kentucky and surrounding counties since 1998. In 2000, Dr. Clore started “Camp Wheeze Away,” a free camp for children with asthma, ages 6-10. Since then, he has served as the medical director for the not-for-profit asthma camp for children. Dr. Clore collaborates with local nutritionists, respiratory therapists and fitness instructors to provide a fun and educational experience for the campers every year in June. Campers learn how to recognize triggers, symptoms, the correct inhaler technique and the importance of taking care of your body by exercising safely and eating nutritiously. “Parents tell me firsthand that after attending camp, their children leave the house, pursue sports and participate in outside activities. They no longer believe asthma affects only them.”\n\nDr. Clore’s family physician, who also cared for his mother and grandmother, inspired his career in medicine. “He was my mentor.” Dr. Clore received his undergraduate degree in chemistry from the University of Kentucky in 1989 and his medical degree from the University of Kentucky in 1993. From 1993 to 1996, he undertook his internship and residency in pediatrics at Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters in Norfolk, Virginia. He completed a fellowship in pediatric and adult allergy immunology at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta in 1998.\n\nSince 2009, Dr. Clore has served as the executive secretary of the Southeastern Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Society. In 2001 and 2003, Dr. Clore was the recipient of the American Red Cross real hero award nomination for outstanding service. When he is not working, he enjoys UK basketball, Cincinnati Reds baseball and spending time with his wife and three sons.\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nJohn Ramey, MD, FAAAAI\n\n“My faith is my inspiration for patient care,” said John Ramey, MD, FAAAAI. “It has led me on medical missions throughout the world, including Honduras, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Romania to help underserved communities.” Recently, he has enjoyed going on trips with One World Health because they partner with communities in third world countries to bring permanent, sustainable healthcare to the chronically underserved. He is always looking for other allergists to join him on trips.\n\nDr. Ramey’s desire for medical training led him to the Medical University of South Carolina, where he embarked on a journey that would span nine years of rigorous study. As a distinguished member of the medical honor society Alpha Omega Alpha, he thrived in this academic environment. His medical expertise was further strengthened through an internal medicine residency at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, followed by an allergy / immunology fellowship at the University of South Florida in Tampa.\n\nFor 17 years, Dr. Ramey has practiced at National Allergy & ENT, founded by Dr. Charles Banov in 1961 and the first allergy group in SC. While at National Allergy & ENT, he has enjoyed seeing hundreds of patients with difficult to treat chronic urticaria and angioedema while being mentored by Dr. Allen Kaplan. In addition to seeing patients, he is past president of the Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Society of SC, a testament to his leadership in the field. He has actively participated in over 300 pharmaceutical clinical trials, delving into critical areas such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria, chronic itch, hereditary angioedema and immune deficiencies. His involvement in organizations like the American Lung Association and the Asthma and Allergy Foundation further showcases his commitment to improving patient outcomes.\n\nBeyond medicine, Dr. Ramey treasures his role as a family man. Married to his college sweetheart, he is the proud father of two sons and two daughters. Notably, he founded DrMoves.com, a platform that assists healthcare professionals with the process of relocation and developing passive streams of income. Dr. Ramey acquired his real estate license over 17 years ago in order to invest in real estate as a hobby and to help his wife in the leadership of Healthy Realty, one of the top real estate companies in Charleston, SC.\n\nWith a distinguished career marked by exceptional education, groundbreaking research, and a deep commitment to community service, Dr. Ramey’s journey exemplifies the intersection of medical expertise, entrepreneurship, leadership and compassionate care.\n\nAugust 2023\n\nJordan E. Scott, MD\n\nJordan Scott, MD, FAAAAI, is a lifelong resident of Massachusetts and graduate from Boston University Medical School. He brings compassion and care to the patients he serves, a commitment to the best practice of allergy/immunology, and a business acumen to the field of medicine.\n\nAfter completing a residency in pediatrics at UMASS/Memorial, Dr. Scott trained in allergy/immunology at Boston Children’s Hospital with adult allergy training at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. In July 2006, Dr. Scott acquired the allergy practice of Geraldine Feldman, MD, to form Northeast Allergy, Asthma and Immunology with three employees.\n\n“I care for others the way I hope others would care for my loved ones,” said Dr. Scott. “Urgent care is treated the same day, or next. And, I take the time to treat conditions – even if it may mean running late the rest of the day.”\n\nDr. Scott takes pride in training future physicians. He is a clinical instructor in community medicine for the UMASS/Memorial family practice program. He has also guest lectured to second year medical students at Boston University on “the business of health care,” reviewing with student market forces and compensation models influencing medicine and healthcare.\n\nAt the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, Dr. Scott successfully sustained his practice, now dispersed among six offices with 65 employees. He also shared his insights and strategies with other practitioners to do the same. During the pandemic, Dr. Scott offered a virtual lecture to members of the New England Allergy Society on ways to remain accessible to patients and financially viable. He’s also represented the interests of board-certified allergist/immunologists in interactions with major New England insurers to ensure coverage for necessary care and procedures.\n\nDr. Scott treats patients of all ages. He evaluates and manages a wide array of allergic/immunologic conditions including: recurrent sinus disease and other recurrent infections; chronic cough; indoor/outdoor allergies; difficult to control asthma; severe eczema; chronic hives; food allergies; drug allergies; recurrent anaphylaxis; latex allergies; bee sting reactions; and primary immunodeficiency.\n\nJuly 2023\n\nEdward Peters, MD\n\n“It’s daunting to get health care when the cost of an inhaler is more than the rent,” said Edward Peters, MD, who has worked for decades in clinics for underprivileged patients. “These are hardworking, pleasant people, without health insurance, who often live paycheck to paycheck.”\n\nDr. Peters is a multi-board specialist, trained in critical care, pulmonology, and allergy / immunology who credits his early mentor Thomas Platts-Mills, MD, PhD, FAAAAI, for his introduction to the practice of allergy / immunology. “Nobody gets the big picture because the comprehensive plan is often very difficult,” he said. His patients at the Community Care Center get a “two-fer,” and the care most patients would require from a variety of specialists.\n\nSince the advent of monoclonal anti-body treatment, and patient access to these medications afforded by pharmaceutical companies, hospitalizations have decreased and quality of life has increased, according to Dr. Peters. “These patients are employable.”\n\nDr. Peters is affiliated with Allergy & Asthma Consultants in Austin, TX, has authored or co-authored 33 peer-reviewed articles in medical literature, as well as scores of posters, presentations, and abstracts, and taught countless residents and medical students.\n\nJune 2023\n\nLinda Cox, MD, FAAAAI\n\nLinda Cox, MD, FAAAAI, past AAAAI President in 2013, is a Practice Champion. Formerly an allergist in solo private practice in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and a clinical associate professor of medicine at Nova Southeastern University, she now resides in Casper, Wyoming and is affiliated with the Asthma & Allergy Center.\n\n“Ours is the specialty of last resort. We treat the most challenging and complex patients.” said Dr. Cox. “I always knew that I’d have an interesting day.”\n\nAs a strong advocate for her patients’ health and well-being, Dr. Cox recalled an elderly gentleman whom she had treated for years, who began experiencing significant signs of dementia. Contacted by his daughter who had expressed concerns about his living situation, Dr. Cox assisted the family in relocating him to a safer place. In her over 30 years of practice, she treated up to four generations of the same family.\n\nAs patients from around the world sought her clinical care, many observed, “My past provider didn’t do what you do,” she said. She describes her philosophy for patient care as one of shared decision-making, necessary to ensure the patient is compliant in their treatment.\n\nDr. Cox recently published “Dance is a Healing Art MCI: mild cognitive impairment RCT: Randomized-controlled trials,” an opinion piece featured at the World Health Organization in May 2023. She also recently completed a two-year dance program in fine arts, and enjoys painting and writing.\n\nHer leadership has stretched far beyond her service to the allergy/immunology specialty. Dr. Cox co-lead a Girl Scout troop, taught Sunday School, served Bethesda by the Sea church as a reader, and was a parent advisory committee member at her children’s school.\n\nMentored by many, she acknowledged Hal Nelson, MD, FAAAAI, Lanny Rosenwasser, MD, FAAAAI, the late Lou Mendelson, MD, FAAAAI, Jim Li, MD, PhD, FAAAAI, Richard Lockey, MD, FAAAAI, and Tom Casale, MD, FAAAAI, and others who have inspired her interest in leadership, research and writing.\n\nMay 2023\n\nManav Singla, MD, FAAAAI\n\nManav Singla, MD, FAAAAI, is managing partner of Allergy Asthma Specialists of Maryland, home to five doctors and two nurse practitioners in four Baltimore, MD office locations. Dr. Singla strives “to collaborate and make shared decisions.” He’s vested in understanding the patient’s goals for treatment, helping them achieve them, and offering them insight into what well-managed asthma allergy can look like.\n\n“One of the most satisfying aspects of being an allergist is the long-term relationships with individuals, families, and extended families. I love understanding how families operate and see so much of this by getting to know the greater family when caring for patients. This has been especially present, challenging, and rewarding during the COVID-19 Era, when families were increasingly stressed,” he said.\n\nDr. Singla has served as the principal investigator in dozens of clinical trials and has been the principal teaching allergist for three different residency programs, including in pediatrics at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore Children’s Hospital; internal medicine at MedStar Baltimore and family practice at MedStar Franklin Square Hospital. He is also Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and Assistant Professor of Clinical Pediatrics at Georgetown University School of Medicine. Dr. Singla is an American Board of Allery & Immunology Diplomate, and Maryland Allergy and Asthma Society leader who frequently speaks at hospital grand rounds.\n\nWhen teaching other physicians, Dr. Singla said, “you're constantly forcing yourself to be better. You must keep up with the most recent information and be prepared to be challenged by others. It also holds you to a higher standard, at all levels, and is such a wonderful way to give back to the same system which educated me. I've had the privilege of working with hundreds of residents and students over the years, and then watched them flourish in the community in their own practices.”\n\nDr. Singla acknowledges that work-life balance can be challenging for the practicing allergist but strives to make it a priority. “I think it's important to declare your priorities early and then create a work environment that reflects those priorities. It's very easy to approach your career with the goal of working hard and being the best. However, by doing that it's easy to leave out yourself and your family and to forget to take care of yourself.” His hobbies and personal interests include a deep love for music, live shows, and being outdoors with family and friends.\n\nApril 2023\n\nNina C. Ramirez, MD, FAAAAI\n\n\"Becoming an allergist was the best career decision of my life, and I'm still looking forward to new adventures,\" said Nina C. Ramirez, MD, FAAAAI.

Subscribing to her father’s philosophy, “If you save a life, it is the equivalent of saving the world”, she treats many patients for whom English is a second language, and serves a community that suffers the second highest rate of asthma (after the Bronx in New York City). Dr. Weissman tries her best to never turn anyone away, and gets tremendous satisfaction from serving others.\n\nAs an example of how her community embraces her, sometimes patients gift her food and small tokens of appreciation, reflective of their cultures. She does not assume others will provide complete medical care, and strives to deliver the finest in medical care to all of her patients.\n\nDr. Weissman, a 1985 Meharry Medical College graduate with more than 37 years of medical experience, is affiliated with Mount Sinai Morningside, Mount Sinai West and other research and academic institutions.

Baker, MD, FAAAAI, was born and raised in Wisconsin. He attended the University of Washington where he received a bachelor’s degree in chemistry. After graduating from the University Of Wisconsin School Of Medicine in 1970, he completed a pediatric internship at the University of Vermont then returned to the University of Wisconsin for a pediatric residency. In 1972, Dr. Baker became chief resident and earned the Student Teaching Award. Under Charles Reed, MD, FAAAAI, one of the foremost allergists in the country, Dr. Baker completed an allergy and immunology fellowship before entering into private practice in 1974 with Michael Noonan, MD.\n\nFor his 42 years of service in the Portland area, his colleagues named him “one of Portland’s finest” physicians. In the early 1990s, he and Dr. Noonan were involved with FENO research. Their first device filled part of an exam room and ultimately became the technology behind NIOX.\n\nDr. Baker helped to start Camp Christmas Seal, an asthma camp in 1978 and is currently an advisor for Camp Blue Spruce, a food allergy camp for kids in the greater Portland metro. During his years of practice, he and Dr. Noonan have also mentored over 100 pre-med students who later gained admission to medical school.\n\nOutside of the office, Dr. Baker was the assistant baseball coach for Wilson High School for 18 years. The team won two state championships during that time.

He continues to be an avid golfer and fly fisherman.\n\nAt this point in his career, he still does not know when or how to quit the practice of medicine. He enjoys what he does and cannot imagine what he would do in its place. In the words of Dr. Baker, “Medicine is the greatest show on earth and I had a front row seat.”\n\nOctober 2022\n\nJeffrey M. Factor MD, FAAAAI\n\nJeffrey M. Factor MD, FAAAAI, is a community allergist and pediatrician who trained at Albert Einstein. He is a partner at Connecticut Asthma and Allergy and the New England Food Allergy Treatment Center, both in West Hartford. He has served as President of the Connecticut Allergy Society for many years. While it’s a role that demands a good deal of his spare time, he has served with unwavering dedication and enthusiasm. Dr. Factor also stepped up along with the Connecticut Allergy Society and made a donation to the AAAAI Foundation as part of the RSL Challenge. Of all the societies canvassed for this cause in Region 1 (Northeast), Dr. Factor and Connecticut stood tall and responded immediately.\n\nThe Connecticut Allergy Society was started about 50 years ago by Louis M. Mendelson, MD, FAAAAI, who was a mentor to Dr. Factor. Initially Dr. Factor was treasurer for a number of years. Presently he is the only officer and is looking for a younger member to carry on as president after 2023. As the employed physician workforce increases in numbers, it is becoming increasingly difficult to gather as specialists in an organization outside of our day-to-day commitments to clinic work and our patients. Yet, it is very important for allergists to interact with colleagues and derive support, empathy and an antidote to burnout, which is pervasive in our current medical practice environment. To help, the Connecticut Allergy Society recently had a meeting with pharmaceutical sponsors and networking between allergists in Connecticut.\n\nThank you Dr. Factor for your years of service to our specialty and to the allergists of Connecticut. You are definitely a Practice Champion!!\n\nSeptember 2022\n\nMichael Goldman, MD, FAAAAI\n\nMichael Goldman MD, FAAAAI, is managing physician at the Allergy & Asthma Center of Central Maryland. Dr. Goldman did his undergraduate and medical school at Cornell University and residency in Internal Medicine at The New York Hospital.

His practice frequently employs college graduates for 1-2 years before they move on to nursing, PA or medical school. Dr. Goldman inspires these motivated individuals with his positive attitude, his example of evidence-based medicine and his anecdotes of life as a physician. He always encourages them to consider a career in allergy, a hidden gem among medical specialties.\n\nOne current medical student wrote, “I reflected on what type of physician I was aspiring to be, and Dr. Goldman really helped me idealize what it means to put patients first. Dr. Goldman has given me confidence in my abilities, encouragement to keep pushing through and motivation to be my best self.” Two of his post-bacs presented abstracts at the 2021 AAAAI Annual Meeting on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on allergy shots and oral immunotherapy protocols. Dr. Goldman’s philosophy of creating a work culture where individuals thrive through teamwork, creates a positive clinical environment for staff, providers, and most importantly, patients.\n\nAugust 2022\n\nHugh H.
