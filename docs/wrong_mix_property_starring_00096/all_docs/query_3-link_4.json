They are trustworthy employees that are loyal to their bosses and co-workers. They enjoy being in charge and may struggle to delegate chores or share authority. ESTJs are loyal and helpful, but they can also be rigid and opinionated. Tradition and order are important to them, and they have a strong need for control. Maintaining a healthy order in their daily lives assists them in maintaining their balance and peace of mind. They have sound judgment and mental fortitude in times of stress. They are fervent defenders of the legislation and serve as role models. Executives are eager to learn about and raise awareness of social issues, enabling them to make good judgments. Because of their methodical and good people skills, they can arrange events and initiatives in their communities. It's typical to have ESTJ friends, and you'll respect their drive. The only negative is that they may ultimately expect people to reciprocate their gestures and be disappointed when they do not.\n\nWhich Enneagram Type is Tom Noonan?\n\nTom Noonan appears to be an Enneagram type 5, known as the Investigator. This is due to his reserved, introspective nature and his focus on acquiring knowledge and understanding. He is often seen as detached and analytical, preferring to observe and gather information before making decisions. This type's tendency towards isolation and autonomy is evident in his choice to write, direct and star in his own works. His passion for understanding the intricate workings of the human mind in his performances further supports the likelihood of his Enneagram type 5 . While these observations cannot provide an absolute determination of his Enneagram type, they strongly suggest that he fits the traits commonly associated with this type."
