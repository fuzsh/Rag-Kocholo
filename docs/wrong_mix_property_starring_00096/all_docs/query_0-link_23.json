        "text": "We're thrilled to announce that Marc Gorlin has been selected as the newest inductee into the Technology Hall of Fame. Gorlin will be honored at the Georgia Technology Summit on March 28 at the Signia Hotel in Atlanta. Sponsored by PwC since its inception in 1993, the Technology Hall of Fame of Georgia includes a long list of visionaries, including technology industry leaders Tom Noonan, David Cummings, and Kyle Porter. “Marc Gorlin, a remarkable business leader and the driving force behind Roadie, has made significant contributions to revolutionizing the logistics industry,” stated Kevin Kelly, PwC Atlanta Office Managing Partner. “It is an honor to welcome him into the Technology Hall of Fame of Georgia. Marc’s innovative spirit exemplifies the thriving tech community in Georgia, inspiring future leaders in the industry.” As the founder and CEO of Roadie, a groundbreaking crowdsourced delivery platform launched in 2014, Gorlin has revolutionized the delivery industry. Notably, Roadie became a wholly-owned subsidiary of UPS in 2021, further solidifying its position in the industry. Before his venture with Roadie, Marc co-founded Kabbage Inc., a company specializing in providing working capital to small and medium-sized businesses. The company’s success led to its acquisition by American Express in 2020. “Georgia is a key piece of the magic that created Roadie, Kabbage and the other companies I’ve helped found. Georgia is the pot in which the rest of the ingredients simmer,” said Gorlin. “There’s nowhere like this state, this tech community, when it comes to making something out of nothing and getting it to grow. Our community nurtures its own.” Additionally, Gorlin played a pivotal role as co-founder and chairman of VerticalOne Corporation, a content personalization service that was acquired by S1 Corporation for an impressive $166 million. In 1996, he was a co-founder and original board member of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). Marc’s leadership was instrumental in launching PGP and overseeing its financing, growth, and eventual sale to Network Associates in 1997. He’s a graduate of the University of Georgia and continues to pay it forward to his community. “We’re thrilled to honor Marc Gorlin, as he has established himself as a highly successful entrepreneur in Atlanta during this transformational time by driving our technology industry forward,” said TAG’s President & CEO, Larry K. Williams. “His impact on our ecosystem is profound, as evident by his record of launching multiple startups with successful acquisitions. Marc is more than deserving to be in the Georgia Technology Hall of Fame.” Read more in the full press release, and join us for Marc's induction ceremony at the Georgia Technology Summit on March 28."
