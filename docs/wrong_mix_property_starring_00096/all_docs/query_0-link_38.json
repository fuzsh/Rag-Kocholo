        "text": "We have reached another Don Bluth animation classic! The Pebble and The Penguin. Another cult classic that 90s babies and kids hold near and dear to their hearts! The Pebble and the Penguin is a 1995 American independent animated musical comedy-adventure film directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman. The film stars the voices of Martin Short, Jim Belushi, Tim Curry, and Annie Golden. Based on the true life mating rituals of the Adélie penguins in Antarctica, the film focuses on a timid, stuttering penguin named Hubie who tries to impress a beautiful penguin named Marina by giving her a pebble that fell from the sky and keep her from the clutches of an evil penguin named Drake who wants Marina for himself. Towards the end of production, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer significantly changed the film, forcing Don Bluth and Gary Goldman to leave their film and demand to have their names taken off the film. The two would later start working at Fox Animation Studios. The film was released in the United States on April 12, 1995, by MGM/UA Distribution Co., receiving negative reviews from critics and being a box office bomb, grossing only $3.9 million against a $28 million budget. It is the final film to be produced by Sullivan Bluth Studios before the studio went bankrupt and ceased operations.\n\nClick to Subscribe: https://bit.ly/Youtube-Subscribe-SoapDirt In a recent episode of The Bold and the Beautiful, there's significant casting news that has fans abuzz. The CBS soap opera is introducing Crew Morrow, the son of legendary soap actor Joshua Morrow.

The role was previously played by Finnegan George and Heather Tom's real son, Zain Acor. Crew Morrow's debut is slated for August 1st. In other casting updates, there's speculation about Hope Logan's (Annika Noelle) health after she demonstrated some concerning behaviors. Jamison Belushi, daughter of Jim Belushi, is cast as a lab tech, April, working with Li Finnegan (Naomi Matsuda) and her son Finn (Tanner Novlan) at the hospital. Fans suspect that Hope might be the subject of April's tests. Additionally, there's a possibility of a new character named Sabrina, as the show is casting a sophisticated, leading lady aged 45 to 50. Whether Sabrina is a new character or a recasting of an existing one like Taylor Hayes (Krista Allen) or Quinn Fuller (Rena Sofer) remains to be seen.

This time, they're revisiting the golden era of Arnold Schwarzenegger's filmography, kicking off with a deep dive into the 1988 buddy cop comedy, \"Red Heat.\"Picture this: Arnold Schwarzenegger as Ivan Danko, a Soviet Union cop sent on a special assignment to the chaos of Chicago, USA. His partner in this odd couple adventure? The hilarious Jim Belushi as Art Ridzik. It's a fish-out-of-water story with a touch of the buddy cop dynamic that defined the era.While \"Red Heat\" might seem like a goofy comedy at first glance, the brothers reveal its hidden layers. The film cleverly explores the cultural clash between Danko's Soviet background and Ridzik's Chicago upbringing, emphasizing the surprising similarities between the two. Set against the backdrop of the dwindling Cold War tensions and the impending dismantling of the Soviet Union, the movie captures a unique moment in history.But that's not all—the plot thickens with Ed O'Ross playing Viktor Rosta, the notorious USSR drug pusher and big bad guy. The narrative weaves a subplot involving the Cleanheads, a Black liberation movement, drawing intriguing parallels between Black liberation in America and socialist principles in the USSR. It's a dense and captivating plot that unfolds against the backdrop of East meeting West.\"Red Heat\" is a classic tale with an ensemble cast that's nothing short of iconic—Gina Gershon, Laurence Fishburne, Peter Boyle, and more. The movie surprises with its depth and intriguing layers, making it a classic worth revisiting. So, join the brothers as they unravel the intricacies of this Schwarzenegger gem in \"Second Chance Schwartzy.\" It's a blast from the past that promises to be a great and surprising ride!\n\nThis week Ken welcomes esteemed, accomplished director and author of the field guide/memoir \"Adventures in the B-Movie Trade\", Brian Trenchard-Smith to the show.

Talk about a stocking stuffer!! LOLLL!!!!! We begin somewhat heavy with a dramatic child welfare incident outside of Gold's Gym Venice, where I desperatel wish the Punisher was real. I went to the \"Roast Of LA\" 'comedy' show with the mighty T Dog, and share my thoughts & observations on that. I ruminate on the politics of ATM card charges at mom & pop Los Angeles establishments. I lament the lack of portionality at Chipotle of late, and the unequitable charges for double meat. (Which now gives you the amount of meat/chicken you USED to get) Hear about the dramatic incident at LA Fitness, where a hapless fool threatened us all with a 2 ton leg press. I revisit Mission Impossible 4, Ghost Protocal, and the motion picture \"K9\" starring the quite tactless \"not John Beushi.\" Finally, I recall the saga of my Sony studios FX3 adventure, starring rock star cinematographer Jacques Jouffret, and the the guy that directed \"Lights Out,\" whuuuut!!\n\nJim Kouf is a writer, director, producer & showrunner.
