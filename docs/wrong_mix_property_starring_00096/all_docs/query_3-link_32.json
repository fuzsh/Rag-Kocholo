        "text": "VOICE OVER: Phoebe de Jeu WRITTEN BY: Matt Klem\n\nGood luck getting the theme song out of your head! Welcome to WatchMojo, and today we're catching up with what the X-Files cast have been up to since the show's end. Our list includes actors Tom Noonan, Steven Williams, Robert Patrick and more!\n\nWelcome to WatchMojo, and today we’re catching up with what the X-Files cast have been up to since the show’s end. Which of your favorite “The X-Files” characters do you love spotting in current shows and movies these days? Let us know in the comments below!\n\n#20: Annabeth Gish\n\nMonica Reyes\n\nIn season eight, “The X-Files” switched up the cast. David Duchovny had left the show, and Annabeth Gish was brought on as Special Agent Monica Reyes, and Robert Patrick as her partner John Doggett. Reyes, who was similar to Mulder in her desire to believe, remained with the show until it ended, even appearing in the final moments of the series finale. Since the show’s end, Gish has kept very busy, with roles in a slew of notable TV shows. They include “The West Wing”, “The Bridge”, “Sons of Anarchy”, “Halt and Catch Fire”, and “Succession”.\n\n#19: Terry O'Quinn\n\nLt. Brian Tillman\n\nLong before he ever met Michael Emerson on “Lost”, the two actors both appeared in separate episodes of “The X-Files”. Originally appearing in season two’s “Aubrey”, O’Quinn also popped up for a brief moment in “The X-Files: Fight the Future” motion picture, and in season nine’s “Trust No 1”. O’Quinn would go on to become known as Mr. Ten Thirteen after appearing in “Harsh Realm” and “Millennium”, both of which, like “The X-Files”, were created by Chris Carter. O’Quinn continues to be a very busy actor, flourishing on television without a break since his time on the paranormal drama.\n\n#18: Brad Dourif\n\nLuther Lee Boggs\n\nBy the time he appeared in the “X-Files” first season episode “Beyond the Sea”, Brad Dourif was already a well-known and established actor. He’d received an Oscar nomination for his role in 1975’s “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest”, and was famous as the voice of Chucky in the “Child’s Play” franchise. As Luther Lee Boggs, Dourif put Scully’s skepticism to the test, adding a much needed layer to her character. Since then, he’s had many, many roles both in TV and film, winning particular acclaim for his portrayal of Doc Cochran in “Deadwood”. He’s also been reprising his role as Chucky in the TV series of the same name.\n\n#17: Cary Elwes\n\nBrad Follmer\n\nPerhaps best known for his portrayal of Westley in “The Princess Bride”, Cary Elwes came to “The X-Files” with an expansive filmography under his belt. Introduced in season 9, his character Brad Follmer was a former love interest of Monica Reyes. Although he only appeared in six episodes, Elwes did a great job being morally ambiguous and acting as a foil to Doggett. Since the show ended, he’s appeared in a slew of notable shows, including “The Art of More” and “Stranger Things”. Perhaps his most memorable work, however, has been as Lawrence Gordon from the original “Saw” movie and its 3D sequel.\n\n#16: Tom Noonan\n\nJohn Lee Roche\n\nSome of the most memorable characters on “The X-Files” became that way only because of the actor who brought them to life. Such was the case for John Lee Roche, a serial killer who Mulder put behind bars during his earlier years at the FBI. Actor Tom Noonan was instrumental in crafting a performance that elevated the creep factor. With his calm and understated demeanor, Noonan used his impeccable talent to bring Roche to life. The actor continues to impress and chill audiences with his abilities both in front of and behind the camera. One of his most notable roles has been the Pallid Man in the TV series “12 Monkeys”.\n\n#15: Lucy Lawless\n\nShannon McMahon\n\nLucy Lawless had already made quite a name for herself starring in “Xena: Warrior Princess” before she appeared on “The X-Files”. Originally intended to be a recurring character, Shannon McMahon’s story arc was reduced when Lawless became pregnant. Nonetheless, she made quite an impression as a former colleague of John Doggett’s and one of the first alien super-soldiers featured in the series. Since her time in the paranormal drama, Lawless has appeared in other notable sci-fi and fantasy shows including a major role in “Battlestar Galactica” and “Ash vs. Evil Dead”. She’s also an active member of Greenpeace, participating in protests against oil exploration in the Arctic.\n\n#14: Steven Williams\n\nX\n\nMulder and Scully may have done their best to find the truth out there, but they wouldn’t have gotten as far as they did without a little help. Starting in the second season, Mulder began to mark the letter X in his apartment window with tape to signal a mysterious man for help. Steven Williams’ played this unnamed character for several seasons, giving fans a stark contrast to Mulder’s contact Deep Throat. Despite appearing in countless other television programs since then, Williams’ would once again become affiliated with paranormal television when he landed a recurring role as Rufus Turner on “Supernatural”. Today, he continues to appear in both television and film roles, not all of them otherworldly.\n\n#13: Chris Owens\n\nJeffrey Spender\n\nFans of the show will remember Chris Owens for his portrayal of Jeffrey Spender, son of the Cigarette Smoking Man. But before taking on that role, he also played a young version of the Cigarette Smoking Man, and - buried beneath layers of prosthetics and makeup - the Great Mutato. In the time between the original series finale and his return in season 11, Owens kept a lower profile, but continued to work steadily in both film and TV. Appearing at conventions from time to time, he still speaks quite fondly of his time on “The X-Files”.\n\n#12: Laurie Holden\n\nMarita Covarrubias\n\nAn informant character who was intended to replace Steven Williams' X, Marita Covarrubias was a member of the shadowy Syndicate, until she betrayed them. She and Alex Krycek even went as far as attempting to take out the Cigarette Smoking Man. While the role was met with mixed reviews, Laurie Holden went on to portray many other intriguing characters on TV in shows like “The Shield” and “The Americans”. Perhaps most famously, she portrayed Andrea Harrison in “The Walking Dead”. She can also be seen playing the Crimson Countess on Amazon’s “The Boys”.\n\n#11: Doug Hutchison\n\nEugene Victor Tooms\n\n“The X-Files” may have originally been set up as a UFO-conspiracy-based show, but the introduction of the character Eugene Victor Tooms changed all of that. Appearing in the episode “Squeeze”, actor Doug Hutchison set the stage for all future “monster of the week” storylines with his creepy, cannibalistic mutant. He reprised the role again in the episode “Tooms”. Hutchison continued to squeeze into roles in other notable works, including “The Green Mile” and “Lost”. He also formed a production company called Dark Water Inc. At 51, he drew significant criticism when he married then 16-year old singer Courtney Stodden. The couple have since divorced.\n\n#10: James Pickens Jr.\n\nAlvin Kersh\n\nAlvin Kersh made quite a first impression on fans when he first appeared on “The X-Files”. Replacing Walter Skinner as Mulder and Scully’s boss, he became a new obstacle to their work in the paranormal. Kersh was relentless in his adversarial attitude, until he finally showed a more caring side and helped break Mulder out of prison. Fans may not have liked the character, but James Pickens Jr. thoroughly enjoyed his time on the show. Today, you’ll find Pickens performing as Richard Webber on ABC’s “Grey’s Anatomy” where he’s been a regular since the hospital drama began.\n\n#9: Bruce Harwood, Tom Braidwood & Dean Haglund\n\nThe Lone Gunmen\n\nAs conspiracy theorists the Lone Gunmen, Melvin Frohike, John Fitzgerald Byers, and Richard 'Ringo' Langly were always a source of entertainment and questionable information for the FBI duo. They went on to star in their own spin-off. Bruce Harwood, who portrayed John Fitzgerald Byers, has appeared in several TV shows since, and co-founded Vancouver’s Bard on the Beach Shakespeare Festival. Tom Braidwood, the man behind Melvin Frohike, took on a handful of other acting and production roles, but retired from his work in the industry in 2010, although he came back for the 2016 “The X-Files” revival. Dean Haglund, who played Richard Langly, moved to Australia in 2015, where he hosts a podcast.\n\n#8: Robert Patrick\n\nJohn Doggett\n\nDespite his impressive resume, Robert Patrick is probably best known for playing the T-1000 in 1991’s “Terminator 2: Judgment Day”. During his time on “The X-Files” he played John Doggett, who came in to assist with the search for Mulder, and ultimately joined the X-Files unit. As much as fans wanted to hate him, Patrick’s portrayal of a multifaceted Doggett won them over. It’s no surprise that he’s continued to be a staple in both television and films ever since. With major roles on “Scorpion”, “Peacemaker” and “True Blood”, Patrick has certainly kept himself busy! He’s also a dedicated motorcycle enthusiast.\n\n#7: Jerry Hardin\n\nDeep Throat\n\nJerry Hardin’s Deep Throat was the first, and possibly most important, secret informant to help Mulder in his search for the truth. Much of the reason fans enjoyed this character so much came from Jerry Hardin’s performance, which added a sense of conflict and gravitas. A highly respected character actor, Hardin’s career has spanned 150 appearances in film and TV - which we’re not going to try to list here! His wife and daughter are also actors. You probably know his daughter Melora from “The Office”, “Monk”, and “Transparent.”\n\n#6: Nicholas Lea\n\nAlex Krycek\n\nAnother character the fans loved to hate was Alex Krycek, portrayed by Canadian actor Nicholas Lea. Starting out as an FBI agent poised to assist Mulder, Krycek went on to become a character who switched loyalties whenever it served his own needs. After “The X-Files”, actor Nicholas Lea racked up a considerable number of other credits, especially in TV. One of his most notable roles was as Tom Foss on the sci-fi series “Kyle XY”. He has also guest starred on numerous shows, such as “CSI”, “Men in Trees”, “V”, “Continuum”, and “Arrow”.\n\n#5: Bryan Cranston\n\nPatrick Crump\n\nWe all know what Bryan Cranston went on to do after his time on “The X-Files”! But you might not know he even appeared on the cult paranormal show at all. Well, back in ‘98, Vince Gilligan wrote an episode inspired by the movie “Speed”. He insisted that Cranston be cast as the villain, Patrick Crump. The episode garnered great reviews and served as a pivotal moment in both Cranston and Gilligan’s careers. Gilligan would later insist on hiring Cranston for his new show “Breaking Bad”, despite opposition from producers who only saw Cranston as a comedic actor from his time on “Malcolm in the Middle”. Lucky for both, Gilligan got the Walter White he wanted.\n\n#4: Mitch Pileggi\n\nWalter Skinner\n\nPortraying the on-again/off-again boss of agents Mulder and Scully was Portland-born actor, Mitch Pileggi. Audiences wanted to believe that Walter Skinner was on his agents’ side, but would quite often find him led astray. Skinner appeared in episodes throughout both the original and revival run of the show, becoming a fan-favorite character. Pileggi himself continued working steadily in television with big roles in “Stargate Atlantis”, “Sons of Anarchy”, and “Dallas. He can also be seen as Bonham Walker in the “Walker, Texas Ranger” reboot “Walker” on The CW.\n\n#3: William B. Davis\n\nCigarette Smoking Man\n\nHis character didn’t even speak a single word during his first episode appearance. But from that moment came another 42 appearances across both the original run and its 2016 revival. Described as the Darth Vader of the show by the series’ director Kim Manners, Cancer Man became the most infamous character in the show. The actor behind the puffs of smoke, William B. Davis, has continued to act, appearing on shows like “Continuum” and “Upload”. He’s also founded his own acting school. Outside of showbiz, he finds time to water-ski, give lectures on skepticism, and advocate for action on climate change.\n\n#2: Gillian Anderson\n\nDana Scully\n\nGillian Anderson was a relatively unknown actress when she started on “The X-Files”. Today, Dana Scully is just one of countless memorable roles she’s portrayed. This has included roles in “The Fall”, “Hannibal”, “The Crown”, and “Sex Education”, among many, many others. On the way, she’s picked up two Primetime Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and four Screen Actors Guild Awards! While continuing to find success in her acting career, Anderson has also been very busy in activism and charity work. She’s an honorary spokesperson for the Neurofibromatosis Network, and has been an outspoken supporter of women’s, children’s, and indigenous rights.\n\n#1: David Duchovny\n\nFox Mulder\n\nDavid Duchovny had already been in several TV shows and films before starring in “The X-Files”. But it was his portrayal of Fox Mulder that ensured his place in pop culture history. He’s acted steadily since the end of the show, most notably as Hank Moody in “Californication.” But he’s also expanded his interests into other areas. His first novel, “Holy Cow: A Modern-Day Dairy Tale” was published in 2015; he’s since published four other books. Duchovny also took an interest in music, releasing his debut album “Hell or Highwater” in 2015, as well. These days, when he’s not writing or singing, he continues to appear in film and television, while also advocating for environmentalism and electric cars."
