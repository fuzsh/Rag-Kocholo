        "text": "American actor, screenwriter and producer (1921–1968)\n\nFor other people named Tommy Noonan or similar, see Tom Noonan (disambiguation).\n\nTommy Noonan (born Thomas Patrick Noone;[1] April 29, 1921 – April 24, 1968) was a comedy genre film performer, screenwriter and producer. He acted in a number of high-profile films as well as B movies from the 1940s through the 1960s; he is best known for his supporting performances as Gus Esmond, wealthy fiancé of Lorelei Lee (Marilyn Monroe), in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), and as musician Danny McGuire in A Star Is Born (1954).\n\nBorn in Bellingham, Washington,[2] Noonan was the younger half-brother of actor John Ireland.[2]\n\nHe was the son of Michael Joseph Noone and Gracie Ferguson. His father was a vaudeville comedian and a native of Garrafrauns, Dunmore, County Galway, Ireland. His mother, a piano teacher, was from Glasgow, Scotland.[2] He attended New York University.[3]\n\nIn 1934, Noonan and Ireland made their stage debuts with a New York-based experimental theater.[4] They later appeared together in three films, including I Shot Jesse James (1949).\n\nNoonan had a repertory company of his own prior to the Second World War.[4] On Broadway, he appeared in How to Make a Man (1960) and Men to the Sea (1944).[5]\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, he made his film debut in George White's Scandals (1945).[4]\n\nHe teamed with Peter Marshall to form a comedy team in the late 1940s. (Noonan's half-brother John Ireland was married to Marshall's sister Joanne Dru.) Their performances were limited because they continued their individual careers, \"working together only when both were available at the same time\".[4] As Noonan and Marshall, they appeared on television, nightclubs, and in the films Starlift, FBI Girl (both 1951), The Rookie (1959), and Swingin' Along (1962). They also wrote for other comics, including Rowan and Martin, which led to Marshall holding a lifelong grudge against Dan Rowan after Noonan fell ill near the end of his life and Rowan paid Noonan almost no attention.[6] The duo went their separate ways after the release of Swingin' Along.\n\nIn 1953, Noonan appeared in the musical Gentlemen Prefer Blondes as Gus Esmond, the nerdy fiancé of Marilyn Monroe's character Lorelei Lee. The following year, he played Danny McGuire, Judy Garland's bandmate, accompanist and friend, in the Warner Brothers film A Star Is Born. He also played a voyeuristic bank manager in the Richard Fleischer film noir melodrama Violent Saturday [3] in 1955.\n\nIn 1961, Noonan appeared on the CBS courtroom drama Perry Mason as the defendant and episode's title character, comedian Charlie Hatch, in \"The Case of the Crying Comedian\".\n\nIn the early 1960s he appeared in a few B movies, including Promises! Promises! (1963) with Jayne Mansfield and 3 Nuts in Search of a Bolt (1964) with Mamie Van Doren, which he also directed, wrote and produced. His last effort as a producer was Cottonpickin' Chickenpickers (1967), which was also Sonny Tufts' last movie.\n\nNoonan was married five times. His last wife was actress Carole Langley, whose stage name was Pocahontas Crowfoot;[2] they were married 16 years and had four children. Noonan also had a daughter from his first marriage and son from his second marriage.[3][7]\n\nEight months after an operation for a brain tumor, Noonan died in 1968 at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital, just a few days before his 47th birthday.[3][7]\n\nBiography portal\n\nUnited States portal\n\nComedy portal\n\nFilm portal\n\nTelevision portal\n\nTheater portal"
