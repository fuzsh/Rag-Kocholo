His parents divorced when he was an infant, and he was raised by his mother in Ottawa, Ontario. She later married Keith Morrison, a television journalist who is a correspondent for NBC’s Dateline, and John Bennett Perry wed writer Debbie Doyle. Matthew Perry’s family later included five half-siblings.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThat ’90s Quiz\n\nPerry was a high-ranking junior tennis player while growing up in Ottawa and had dreams of becoming a professional athlete. However, at age 15 he went to live with his father in Los Angeles, and there he became interested in acting. While attending the Buckley School, he took improv classes at the comedy theater LA Connection. In 1979 Perry made his TV debut, appearing in an episode of 240-Robert, a police drama that starred his father. In the mid-1980s Perry had minor roles on such shows as Charles in Charge, Silver Spoons, and The Tracey Ullman Show.\n\nPerry graduated from Buckley in 1987, and that year he appeared in his first starring role, in the sitcom Second Chance (later renamed Boys Will Be Boys), which ran for one season. In 1988 Perry made his big-screen debut in A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon, a coming-of-age film that starred River Phoenix. The following year Perry had a memorable role on the hit sitcom Growing Pains, playing a boyfriend of Carol Seaver (Tracey Gold) who dies in a drunk-driving accident. Perry later was a series regular on the short-lived Sydney (1990), cast as a rookie cop whose sister (Valerie Bertinelli) is a private detective. He then had guest appearances on Who’s the Boss and Beverly Hills, 90210 before starring in the family comedy Home Free (1993), another series that was quickly canceled.\n\nFriends\n\nMainstream success eluded Perry until he won the role of Chandler Bing on Friends. The sitcom, which is set in New York City, follows six young adults as they search for jobs, relationships, and fulfillment. Perry’s Chandler is a well-paid professional who uses sarcasm and self-deprecation to hide his insecurities. His best friends are Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), who is his roommate, and Ross Geller (David Schwimmer). The other main characters are Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), and Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow).\n\nFriends debuted in 1994 and was an immediate sensation, Perry’s Chandler being especially popular with fans. The largely unknown cast became international stars, and, by the last two seasons, Perry and his costars were earning $1 million per episode. The show’s finale, which aired in 2004, drew an audience of more than 52 million viewers. During its 10-season run, Friends received a number of accolades, and Perry garnered an Emmy Award nomination (2002). The sitcom later became a staple in syndication and on streaming services, finding new generations of fans. In 2021 the Friends cast reunited for a TV special in which they discussed the show.\n\nOther credits: The Whole Nine Yards and The West Wing\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The rom-coms Fools Rush In (1997), Three to Tango (1999), and Serving Sara (2002) failed to find an audience. More successful was The Whole Nine Yards (2000), a popular comedy in which he played a dentist whose new neighbor (Bruce Willis) is a gangster. He reprised the role in the 2004 sequel, The Whole Ten Yards.\n\nDuring this time Perry also appeared in several episodes of Ally McBeal and The West Wing. On the latter show, a political drama created by Aaron Sorkin, he was cast as a Republican lawyer working in a Democratic administration, and for his performance Perry earned two Emmy nominations (2003 and 2004). In addition, in 2004 he made his directorial debut, helming an episode of the medical comedy Scrubs; he also appeared alongside his father in the episode.\n\nPerry’s later career was largely focused on television, with only occasional film appearances. His notable credits include the TV movie The Ron Clark Story (2006), a biopic about a teacher at a Harlem school. For his portrayal of the title character, Perry earned another Emmy nomination. He later starred in Sorkin’s comedy-drama Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (2006–07), playing the head writer for a live comedy show similar to Saturday Night Live. Although expected to be a hit, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip was canceled after one season.\n\nPerry continued to take lead roles in sitcoms, but success remained elusive. He cocreated and starred in Mr. Sunshine (2011–12), a comedy focusing on the manager of a sports arena. The project initiated a bidding war, which was won by ABC. However, Mr. Sunshine aired for only 13 episodes before being pulled because of low ratings. In 2012–13 Perry starred as a sportscaster dealing with the death of his wife in Go On, but the comedy series was also canceled after one season. He then reunited with Cox for an episode (2014) of the latter’s series Cougar Town.\n\nPerry later served as cocreator and costar of The Odd Couple (2015–17), a remake of the classic 1970s sitcom that was inspired by Neil Simon’s play about ill-matched roommates. Perry starred as the untidy divorced sportswriter Oscar Madison opposite Thomas Lennon as the fussy Felix Unger. In 2017 Perry had a recurring role on The Good Fight and appeared as Ted Kennedy in the miniseries The Kennedys After Camelot.\n\nPersonal life: substance abuse and death\n\nPerry struggled with substance abuse for a number of years. He began drinking when he was 14 years old and later became addicted to such pain medications as Vicodin and OxyContin. His addictions led to numerous other health issues, and in 2018 he was in a coma for two weeks. In his memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing (2022), Perry wrote candidly about his substance abuse, noting that he spent an estimated $9 million trying to beat his addictions and that he had been clean and sober since early 2021. The book received positive reviews and was a New York Times bestseller.\n\nOn October 28, 2023, Perry died at his home in Los Angeles."
