        "text": "Tom Noonan joined the Austin Convention & Visitors Bureau on May 16, 2016 as President & CEO. Prior to that date, Tom was the President & CEO of Visit Baltimore for over nine years starting in January of 2007. Tom was responsible for promoting the Baltimore region as a destination for conventions, meetings, leisure visits, day trips, group tours and family reunions.\n\nUnder Tom’s leadership, Visit Baltimore produced historic convention booking levels from 2009-2015. His leadership was instrumental in the formation of Synchronicities, a three city sales, service, and marketing partnerships with the Anaheim and San Antonio DMO’s. Additionally, Baltimore InSite, the first virtual destination sales tool, was launched in 2012. In his final year, Visit Baltimore also launched the Visit Baltimore Education and Training Foundation that will provide scholarships/training in hospitality industry to those children with high academic levels without the means to afford college.\n\nTom is an established leader in the tourism industry and has hosted many meetings industry events such as MPI, AIBTM, PCMA, IAEE and several events for ASAE.\n\nPrior to Baltimore, Tom spent 18 years at the Dallas Convention & Visitors Bureau as a Sales, Services, and Convention Marketing Executive. Tom is a graduate of Luther College in Decorah, Iowa where he studied business management and speech communications. Those disciplines have served him well in a destination marketing career that has progressed steadily within the DMO industry for the last 28 years.\n\nTom and his wife Mindy have one son Reed, and are thrilled to be returning to their roots in Texas; and especially to the City of Austin which is one of America’s most admired destinations."
