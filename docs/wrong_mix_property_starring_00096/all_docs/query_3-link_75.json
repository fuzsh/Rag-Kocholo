        "text": "I have to be honest, I’m not a very big James Bond fan. Perhaps it’s because I wasn’t exposed to the films at a young age, so seeing Roger Moore kick ass on the moon with a 1970s film budget really didn’t blow my mind at the age of seventeen. I’ll admit that Goldfinger is a classic though, and I loved two out of three of the Daniel Craig re-boot Bonds. Quantum of Solace was a prime example of the horrors of the 2007 writer’s strike, but Casino Royale and Skyfall were great films. Skyfall in particular, with it’s stunning cinematography by Roger “God” Deakins and non-campy performances, didn’t even feel like a Bond film. Going into Sam Mendes’ follow-up Spectre I was concerned it couldn’t live up to the precedent set by Skyfall, but I honestly wasn’t expecting one of the worst Bond films I’ve ever seen. That is not to say that Spectre is a bad film, it’s just pretty mediocre. That is also not to say that it’s necessarily one of the worst of the series, because I’ve only seen twelve Bond films and eight were Brosnan and Craig installments.\n\nThe problems start in the opening credit sequence, one of the least exciting I’ve seen in the series. Casino Royale gave us this pulse-pounding roof-top chase and Skyfall gave us that riveting train sequence. This gives us Daniel Craig suavely changing out of a Dia de Los Muertos suit and a surprisingly calm helicopter take-over. Judi Dench’s M is gone, and Ralph Fiennes has taken over as Bond’s handler. Fiennes is a fine actor, but him and Craig don’t possess the chemistry that Craig shared with Dench. Their back-and-forths are awkward and seem forced, and Naomi Harris’ Moneypenny is presented a lot quirkier here than she was in Skyfall. In fact, everything is much more in keeping with the groovy one-liner campiness of the earlier Bond films and it just doesn’t work with a Bond we already established as more hardened and realistic.\n\nThe misogynist women-are-objects aspect also rears it’s ugly little head as well, with the Bond girl (the criminally underused Lea Seydoux) swooning to a man that basically tells her what to do. It would be nice to see a lesbian Bond in the future or at least a Bond girl that actually has a personality and doesn’t drop her panties to the site of Bond violently murdering someone. “What does one do after they kill someone?” Ralph Fiennes’ M asks in the movie. Craig provides an answer, grab a woman and start stabbing her with your dick. Maybe I’m being too harsh, the character of the suave, ladykiller Bond was created in a time where no one really thought twice about it being demeaning to women. It just seems odd that Sam Mendes would have Bond fall into old habits if the last three movies worked towards re-shaping him for the twenty-first century.\n\nI expected the high-point of the movie to be Christoph Waltz as the villain, but he’s barely used and incredibly underwhelming. Javier Bardem and Mads Mikkelsen underplayed their villains as well but they had a piercing level of aggressiveness under their characters’ cool surface. Waltz just comes across as boring.\n\nThis review might make it seem like I absolutely loathed Spectre, but I did in fact enjoy most of the action sequences. A car chase sequence involving Dave Bautista had me on the edge of my seat. It was very well-choreographed. However, thirty minutes of combined action sequences don’t make up for two solid hours of clunky exposition that isn’t clever. I suppose the film is less of a action/thriller and more of a mystery, though. The mystery being that if creating a more realistic and vulnerable Bond made Casino Royale and Skyfall so successful, why would a seasoned Academy Award winning director fall back on shit that hasn’t worked since the eighties. Grade: C+\n\nDaniel Craig’s Dia de Los Muertos Suit Grade: A\n\nIt’s been seven long years since a Charlie Kaufman movie has been released. His last film and directorial debut, Synecdoche, New York, was brilliant but a box office failure. This prompted him to launch a kickstarter to get Anomalisa, his stop-motion feature about a depressed customer service guru trying to make sense of life, made. The process came with both creative advantages and budgetary disadvantages, the biggest advantage being that Kaufman didn’t have any studio restrictions when crafting something this unique and bizarre. It’s pretty incredible Anomalisa got made without any studio interference, but it’s an absolute miracle it came out more polished and concise than Kaufman’s previous efforts that had an endless amount of outside tinkering.\n\nAnomalisa opens on a plane with a barely famous customer service guru Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis). He’s flying to Cincinnati to speak about his book on customer service and the passenger next to him (voiced by Tom Noonan) won’t leave him alone. When he gets off the plane, he has to deal with a pesky cab driver that insists he has time to see the Cincinnati zoo because it’s only zoo-sized (also voiced by Tom Noonan) before dealing with a bunch of other drone-like customer service representatives all voiced by Tom Noonan. This is to show Michael’s perception of the rest of the world’s population. Everyone is the same with the exception of him. Yeah, it’s next-level narcissism. Even his wife and eight-year-old are voiced by Tom Noonan, which is great because hearing Tom Noonan nonchalantly voice an eight-year-old is among the funniest things I’ve ever heard. All of this changes when he meets Lisa (voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh), who for some reason sounds and looks different than everybody else. She’s an anomaly and her name is Lisa.\n\nAnomalisa is a tightly structured 90-minute character study that centers solely around Michael. Kaufman has made his most simple movie yet and I’d wager, his best. The first stretch of Anomalisa is the funniest film I’ve seen all year, but it slowly morphs into a very poignant and painfully realistic film about human nature. I’ve never seen stop-motion puppets emote in the way Kaufman’s emote. There’s also nothing manipulative about Anomalisa, especially in it’s love story between Michael and Lisa. Studio interference might have made Lisa incredibly intelligent and quirky or might have made Michael’s wife a horrible witch so the audience could justify him having an affair. Thankfully, Anomalisa doesn’t fall into these tropes. Lisa is a fairly stupid character and her sweetness is primarily built on her practically non-existent self-esteem. Michael’s wife isn’t cruel or demanding, even if his eight-year-old is kind of a little prick. And Michael doesn’t have Lisa’s best interests at heart, it seems at times he’s just using her as a vessel to try and cure his unhappiness.\n\nIf Anomalisa sounds terribly cynical and depressing, it is and it isn’t. While not the type of animated film that critics would call “life-affirming”, it doesn’t completely disappear up it’s own asshole and wallow in it’s own pessimism. I don’t want to say the film pulls any of it’s punches, but I do think that the puppets help soften the blow of some of the more upsetting moments. Some might find this diluted, but this actually makes it’s characters more accessible. Part of this is due to the extraordinary voice work by David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh and especially Tom Noonan, who somehow manages to create dozens of wholly different characters while restrained to giving them all the same voice.\n\nWhile it’s certainly less of a downer than the gaping black hole of misery that was Synecdoche, New York, parts of Anomalisa are definitely more uncomfortable to watch than any other Kaufman film. Co-directed by Duke Johnson, who helmed the excellent stop motion Community episode, Anomalisa looks beautiful which wonderfully contrasts with the darker parts of the story. Truly one of the most unique filmgoing experiences I’ve ever had in my life, Anomalisa is a technical marvel as well as a masterstroke in storytelling. You can’t afford to miss it when it opens in theaters December 30th. Grade: A\n\nFat Girl (2001/dir. Catherine Breillat/France) – In his review, Roger Ebert summed up the point of this movie perfectly. “Young love is idealized as sweet romance, but early sexual experiences are often painful and clumsy and based on lies. It is not merely that a boy will tell a girl almost anything to get her into bed, but that a girl will pretend to believe almost anything, because she is curious, too.” More about curiosity than love, Breillat’s film is unbelievably uncomfortable in it’s examination of an overweight but intelligent 12-year-old girl and her model-esque but dim 15-year-old sister. Her 15-year-old sister falls in love with an older college boy on vacation, and ends up being sexually manipulated. The sex scenes in Fat Girl are long, drawn-out and extremely difficult to watch. They’re also incredibly, painfully realistic. It’s painful for the 15-year-old sister who is being coerced by some college horn dog but it’s equally as painful for the 12-year-old who is forced to witness her sister essentially being raped by the hard knocks of life. While all of this has the makings of an excellent film, a few elements completely spoil it. First of all, the musical score is extremely inappropriate for the material and completely undercuts the weight of some paramounts scenes. Also, the ending is totally fucking bonkers and not in a good way. It’s a revoltingly blunt, uncreative and dishonest way to cap off a film so rooted in honesty. Available for streaming on HuluPlus. Grade: B\n\nHard Boiled (1992/dir. John Woo/Hong Kong) – This was John Woo’s last Chinese film before he starting working in the United States, and he certainly treated it as such. Featuring a near forty-five minute hospital shoot-out scene and about a dozen other action sequences sprinkled through-out it’s two-hour runtime, Hard Boiled doesn’t give you much of a chance to come up for air. Woo’s direction is impressive, the best it’s ever been. There isn’t much of a plot, but Woo knows this would only bog down the enjoyment factor. Chow Yun-Fat is back as a cop itching for revenge against the Triads that murdered his partner in a glorious tea house shoot-out that opens up the picture. This is such a far-fetched film that has absolutely no plausibility, but that’s the point. Most American action films are pretty unrealistic anyway, Woo just goes that extra mile by having a shot person fly through the air like a crouching tiger or hidden dragon. Hard Boiled is two full hours of relentless entertainment. Out of Print. Grade: A-\n\nHouse of Games (1987/dir. David Mamet/USA) – I’m an enormous David Mamet fan. Glengarry Glen Ross is my favorite play. However, for all of it’s acclaim, I’ve never really been a fan of his debut feature House of Games. I thought watching it again after college (when I first saw it) would give me a greater appreciation for it, but it didn’t. This isn’t to say the movie is bad, it’s actually a good movie, it’s just not what one would expect from David Mamet. While the acting is outstanding, Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna give career-best performances, and the dialogue is crisp, the plotting is really predictable. It’s strange that a movie about con men is so utterly predictable, but there are no real surprises in House of Games. The other problem I had with House of Games is that it gets fairly misogynistic towards the end, especially in the handling of Lindsay Crouse’s character. Grade: B\n\nWhen it comes to filmmaking, there is a very big difference between warm and sentimental. Sentimental filmmaking tends to underestimate it’s audience’s intelligence by oversimplifying complicated issues in order to ensure that they are all on the same page. Warm filmmaking takes a leap of faith and assumes it’s audience is intelligent by being completely realistic about issues without succumbing to cynicism. While I myself have a certain affinity for cynicism, a film doesn’t have to be cynical in order to be honest. Lenny Abrahamson’s Room does a beautiful job of mining human dignity and decency out of a horrific situation lesser films would seek to exploit.\n\nTrue to it’s title, Room opens on a room. In the room is Ma (Brie Larson) and her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). It’s a run-down but clean living space that Ma has been forced to live in against her will by Old Nick (Deadwood’s Sean Bridgers) for the past seven years. And so it is revealed that Jack is the product of Ma’s abduction and rape, but Ma understandably refuses to accept him as her son’s father. Every night, Old Nick comes into the room and proceeds to rape Ma while Jacob pretends to sleep in the closet, not really knowing what’s going on. Eventually Jack and Ma are able to escape the clutches of Old Nick, and the rest of the film focuses on them struggling to adapt to world much bigger and more complicated than their room.\n\nThis is a film that rises and falls on the strength of the performances and they are all fantastic. Brie Larson delivers an incredibly complex and emotionally resonant performance as Ma, the best performance given by any actor this year. The young Jacob Tremblay is just as effective as Jack, an anything but typical five-year-old, delivering one of those child performances that’s so good it’s almost bewildering it came from someone that young. Joan Allen is excellent in a supporting role as Ma’s mother and the always great William H. Macy shows up briefly as Ma’s father. Lenny Abrahamson’s script is fantastic with the exception of some distractingly unrealistic cop characters, but his tender and intuitive direction more than makes up for it.\n\nAfter Ma and Jack escape Old Nick, we never hear from him again except that he’s caught. This might aggravate some viewers used to vigilante justice or serial killer stories. A lesser movie would have seen Ma force Old Nick to apologize before gunning him down or make the character of Old Nick more twisted and disgusting and explore him in a Buffalo Bill-type fashion. Nothing against those kinds of movies, but Room isn’t about that. Old Nick doesn’t matter in this story. This is a story about recovery and possessing impressive emotional strength against all odds. It’s about the most powerful bond of all — a parent and their child. Grade: A-\n\nBeing John Malkovich (1999/dir. Spike Jonze/USA) – One of the best Criterion Collection purchases I’ve ever made, Being John Malkovich is truly one of the best films ever made. Seriously, I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. It’s absolutely bat-shit crazy premise involves a desperate puppeteer (John Cusack), his animal-obsessed wife (Cameron Diaz) and his sexually manipulative co-worker (Catherine Keener) discovering a portal into actor John Malkovich’s brain. You know, John Malkovich? From that jewel heist movie? It had been five long years since I last saw this masterpiece and it’s even better than I remembered. Completely ridiculous yet surprisingly profound, Being John Malkovich is unlike anything ever committed to celluloid. The amazing Criterion Collection features include an audio commentary track by Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind director Michel Gondry, who remarks in a thick French accent, “Being John Malkovich? What the fuck is this?! I didn’t do this movie!” He talks about he loves but resents Spike Jonze for making such a strong debut feature and randomly talks about actor/director Vincent Gallo (The Brown Bunny, Buffalo ’66) being an arrogant asshole for some reason. Grade: A\n\nHouse (1977/dir. Nobuhiko Obayashi/Japan) – Speaking of absolutely bat-shit crazy, the comedic (?) horror (?) classic House might have Being John Malkovich beat in the bizarre department. Not an easy feat, but if you’ve seen House, you’ll most likely agree that films don’t get more bananas BANANAS BANANAS BANANAS. I can see how a lot of parochial viewers would see this as indecipherable trash, but I absolutely love this film. It’s one of the most relentlessly fascinating and uncompromising visions I’ve ever seen brought to film. Even if it doesn’t have a point, it’s a hilarious blast to look at for 88 minutes. For best results, sit back, relax and let it completely wash over you. Careful of that goddamn cat! Now Streaming on HuluPlus Grade: A-\n\nThe Long Good Friday (1979/dir. John Mackenzie/UK) – A jarringly 70s grind house music score punctuates John Mackenzie’s glacially-paced but ultimately effective crime drama. The Long Good Friday follows gangster Harry Shands’ (the late great Bob Hoskins) battle with the IRA to stay top dog in London. Unfortunately, the Criterion Collection (printed in 1998) doesn’t come with subtitles, so much of the actors’ thick Cockney got lost on these yankee ears. Even with not completely understanding them (I go the gist of what they were saying), it’s an easy story to follow due in part to Berrie Keefe’s remarkably uncomplicated and basic screenplay. This ends up being one of the film’s biggest downfalls as well as the amateurish direction. Despite these crucial shortcomings, the two lead performances are solid. Helen Mirren is wonderful as Shands’ cunning femme fatale wife and Bob Hoskins delivers one of the best performances of his career (and that’s an amazing career) as the angry bulldog-esque crime boss. Hoskins is absolutely riveting and his work in the final scene is among the finest bits of acting I’ve ever seen. Out of Print. Grade: B\n\nCronos (1993/dir. Guillermo Del Toro/Mexico) – Guillermo Del Toro’s sentimental vampire film is the kind of debut feature that perfectly encapsulates the strengths and weaknesses of the filmmaker. Del Toro excels with imaginative visual images and likable characters but his downfall is often striking a good balance between serious and campy elements of his pictures. He also has problems with pacing. Cronos might be awkward at times, but it’s consistently compelling thanks tot he strong relationship between the protagonist and his granddaughter. The film also marks the beginning of Ron Perelman’s long-standing relationship with Del Tore. Here, Perelman plays a delightfully sinister villain. In a fantastic interview on the Criterion DVD, Perelman reveals he was the only English-speaker on set and that Guillermo Del Toro tried to solve every problem with food.

John Woo/Hong Kong) – Before the incredible Cage-gasm that was Face/Off, John Woo directed this ultra-violent, ultra-cheesy and relentlessly entertaining shoot-em-up about a double-crossed assassin (the delightful Chow Yun-Fat) teaming up with a down-on-his-luck police man (Danny Lee) to fuck up some Triad boss. They should have titled this The Over-Killer, because each victim gets shot a minimum of ten times with handguns that magically hold a hundred bullets per clip. It’s anything but believable, but plenty of aggressively unsubtle Catholic imagery, poor green screen shots, the same awful longue song played a million times and random freeze frames that punctuate the friendship of the two leads make this upbeat bullet buffet absolutely unforgettable. OUT OF PRINT. Grade: B+\n\nTopsy-Turvy (1999/dir. Mike Leigh/UK) – Arthur Sullivan (Allen Cordurner) hates the musicals he and librettist W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) write. Sullivan sees them as “ridiculous topsy-turvydom” having no weight or substance to them. He dreams of writing a grand opera and threatens to break his contract with the theater company producing his and Gilbert’s work. Sullivan’s threat and awful reviews force Gilbert to come up with The Mikado, an opera about Japanese culture (essentially a yellow-face Minstrel show) that still remains popular today. Gorgeous costume and set decoration, along with fantastic looking musical numbers make this one of Mike Leigh’s most technically impressive films. However, there are several pacing problems and musical numbers go on far too long. Jim Broadbent and Allen Cordurner are excellent in their roles, but the real stand-out is Leigh favorite Timothy Spall (Mr. Turner, Harry Potter) as on the theater’s most popular actors. Grade: B+\n\nBiopics are a tricky bitch. If you’re too matter-of-fact, the resulting film is boring, and if you take too many liberties with the truth, you get a giant soap opera. One of the aspects I really admire about Steve Jobs, is that it abandons the traditional biopic structure and instead chooses to only focus on three major events in the life of Apple messiah Steve Jobs. We meet Jobs in 1984 at the launch of Macintosh’s first personal computer, then again in 1988 where Jobs, exiled from the company, launches a giant piece of shit called NeXT and finally we end up in 1998, where Jobs is about to launch the iMac.\n\nThis is a really interesting and effective way to tell the story of Steve Jobs, but the film suffers from Aaron Sorkin’s ham-fisted and overly-dramatic dialogue. Characters speak like they are in a Shakespearean tragedy, adding philosophical weight to everything they say. In once scene, Steve Wozniak (a not good Seth Rogen) tells Jobs, “Life is not binary. You can be decent and gifted at the same time.” In another scene, Jobs is being confronted by his teenage daughter about being an absentee father. Jobs counters with, “I’m just poorly made.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest eye-rolling moment comes after Jobs is told off by Wozniak right before an important launch. Jobs takes a deep breath, realizing he’s wrong. As soon as he does this, the presentation screen above him flashes, “Think Different.” This is Apple’s tagline and coincidentally what Jobs is doing at that exact moment. There’s also this ongoing occurrence where John Scully (a fantastic Jeff Daniels), the former CEO of Apple, keeps asking Jobs why he feels rejected instead of chosen for being adopted as a child. This allows Jobs to talk in detail about how he feels about such a life-defining event, but it seems odd to me that his boss would keep inquiring about this. It seems like it’s just a sloppy and uncreative way to get Jobs to monologue about abandonment issues.\n\nProblems with the writing aside, there is one major saving grace of Steve Jobs, Michael Fassbender. He sheds all of his regular mannerisms to completely transform into Jobs. It’s a compelling and incredibly empathetic performance that completely transcends cheesy dialogue. The actor is a very large and imposing force, but miraculously succeeds in presenting himself as physically unthreatening. While Seth Rogen is basically playing Seth Rogen in a wig, the rest of the cast shine.\n\nKate Winslet is great as Job’s longtime assistant Joanna Hoffman and it’s amazing to see Michael Stuhlbarg go from playing the cunning and nasty crime boss Arnold Rothstein on HBO’s Boardwalk Empire to playing the nervous, bumbling tech nerd, Andy Herzfeld. Jeff Daniels is worthy of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his work here. The film’s best scene brilliantly edits three or four arguments between him and Jobs into this compelling montage that deftly covers half an hour worth of plot in five minutes.\n\nDanny Boyle’s direction is top-notch as are the film’s editing and cinematography. The first two-thirds of the film, set in the 1980s, really look like they were filmed in the 1980s. Boyle and crew perfectly capture the bright but muted colors. Steve Jobs is a good movie if not just for the mind-blowing work of Michael Fassbender and the rest of the cast not consisting of Seth Rogen. The dialogue is most likely an anything but honest portrayal of how events actually happened, but it’s impossible to deny that the film isn’t entertaining and compelling from beginning to end. Grade: B\n\nThe incredibly talented Cary Joji Fukunaga wisely opted out of the abysmal second season of True Detective to write, direct and act as DP on this Netflix Original Movie. The film has already garnered a lot of controversy for both the film and it’s director, but not because of objectionable content. Movie theater chains are outright refusing to screen Beasts of No Nation because of it’s premiere on Netflix and the online streaming services vs. movie theater war currently in progress. Movie theater chains fear that they will soon follow Blockbuster into extinction, thanks in part to the convenience of screening a two hour plus movie about genocide in the cozy confines of your own home. Not many people would have left a show as popular as True Detective to venture off into such a situation, but Fukunaga’s gamble pays off with an extremely powerful Beasts of No Nation that’s sure to score a couple of Oscar (yes, it’s eligible) nominations.\n\nBeasts of No Nation follows a seemingly average West African child named Agu (Abraham Attah.) Agu has a loving family and home, all of which changes when a violent anti-government group led by the cruel and calculating Commandant (the always brilliant Idris Elba) recruit him as a child soldier. Agu slowly witnesses his humanity fade away as murder, torture and rape become the daily routine for him. Vying for his commandant’s affections, Agu is manipulated and brainwashed into doing horrible things one of which is only hinted at half-way through but will leave you with a gigantic knot in your stomach.\n\nFukunaga’s cinematography is absolutely gorgeous in capturing the spirit and culture of West Africa and his direction actually succeeds True Detective. The performances Fukunaga is able to get out of his cast are miraculous, especially in the case of young Abraham Attah in the leading role. Most of the time, leading child characters are just a canvas to absorb the atrocities of the story, but Attah brings Agu to life with the kind of maturity and insight usually only a middle-aged veteran would possess. One amazing scene features a teacher trying to prod Agu for answers about being a child soldier. Agu states that she is treating him like he’s a baby and she’s an adult, when in reality taking into consideration everything he’s experienced, she’s the little girl and he’s an old man. This line ends up seeming completely unnecessary, because Attah expresses this so perfectly with his eyes.\n\nAll of the technicals from the editing to the sound mixing to the costume design are all outstanding. The only downside to Beasts of No Nation is the story structure. While the dialogue is sharp and overflowing with honesty, most of the beats in the story are predictable and the opening act, which introduces Agu and his family unit, is overlong. This would normally be a deal-breaker, but every other element of Beasts of No Nation is so strong that it can make the most tired of story structures seem completely fresh. I can’t wait to see what Fukunaga brings us next. Grade: A-\n\nCrimson Peak, Guillermo Del Toro’s latest gothic horror film, looks beautiful. The costumes, the set decoration, the cinematography and editing are all very impressive. Everything is put together in such a pretty package. However, when you strip away all of those elements, you’re left with nothing particularly noteworthy. A convoluted, uninteresting story played out by four completely static characters speaking soap-opera quality dialogue.\n\nMia Wasikowska plays Edith Cushing, a naive young woman oozing with white privilege who aspires to be a respected female author in a time when it was unseemly for a lady to do so. You’d expect Edith to be a strong protagonist given her brazen defiance of the status quo, but unfortunately she collapses in tears at the sight of most curveballs. She falls in love with an ambitious British inventor Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddelston) who takes her to live with him and his cold sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain) at some creepy mansion in the middle of Cumberbatch or Cumberland or some fucking place in the English countryside. Ghosts start to appear and threaten to unravel a mystery for Edith. Also riding through this world, all alone, once again, is Charlie Hunnam sans facial hair. He plays a nice young doctor that is childhood friends with Edith.\n\nThe acting is really disappointing given the movie’ star power, and Mia Wasikowska is more annoying than anything else in the leading role. Charlie Hunnam isn’t given much to do and Jessica Chastain, shocking as it is, completely phones in her performance. The only decent performance in the film belongs to Tom Hiddleston, and it’s more than a little sad to see him struggle so hard to bring such a hollow character to life.\n\nIf you’re expecting a scary movie, you’ll be sorely disappointed. While certainly creepy at times, Del Toro seems to be interested in making the ghosts appear more sympathetic than spooky. I admire this very human approach, and it makes you think Crimson Peak might actually be about something at first glance. Maybe it’s about the infinite possibilities of life in contrast with the non-existent options of death, or maybe it’s about how as humans we are obsessed with the paranormal because it gives us hope that it all doesn’t fade to black when we expire. One of the reasons I loved Pan’s Labyrinth was because it used supernatural elements to illustrate how the worst and scariest evil is always human. Unfortunately, Crimson Peak is mostly about how striking the color red is on top of gloomy shades of grey and black. Grade: C+\n\nEraserhead (1977 / dir. David Lynch / USA)\n\nI can’t believe it took me this long to experience David Lynch’s debut film. While certainly not in the same league as Blue Velvet or Mulholland Drive, Eraserhead is full of mind-blowing imagery all built-around a story of the stresses of raising a child with no money and limited resources. Jack Nance (who was murdered by homeless people in a parking lot in real life) creates a wonderfully empathetic character to take us into this grotesque black and white world where claymation cornish game hens shit blood and swollen faced honeys sing about heaven. Eraserhead isn’t a powerful and cryptic allegory for anything, it’s just a beautifully shot, bizarre cult film. Now Streaming on HuluPlus Grade: B+\n\nShort Cuts (1993 / dir. Robert Altman / USA)\n\nOne of the best films I’ve ever seen in my life, this love letter to Los Angeles and humanity in general takes place over course of two days exploring the lives of twenty-two people. The intersecting vignettes are appropriately punctuated by jazz music seeing as though the dialogue is so realistic it often seems improvised itself. Along with wonderfully natural dialogue, Altman’s screenplay adapted from the short stories of the great Raymond Carver features beautifully written soliloquies brought to life by individual actors in one of the greatest ensemble casts ever assembled for a motion picture: Julianne Moore, Frances McDormand, Tim Robbins, Robert Downey, Jr., Lily Tomlin, Tom Waits, Bruce Davison, Andie McDowell, Matthew Modine, Huey Lewis (and his penis), Fred Ward, Anne Archer, Buck Henry, Annie Ross, Lori Singer, Chris Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Lily Taylor, Peter Gallagher, Jack Lemmon, Madeline Stowe and Lyle Lovett as a disgruntled pastry chef. Short Cuts may be over three hours long, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire runtime. Who knew Suburbanites going about their everyday lives could be so riveting. Grade: A\n\nSisters (1973 / dir. Brian DePalma / USA)\n\nDespite having one of the best uses of the split screen I’ve ever seen in cinema, Brian DePalma’s early effort Sisters is a jumbled mess of a movie. For almost an hour, the film is wonderfully suspenseful and entertaining. Brian DePalma perfectly manipulates the camera to provide the perfect level of dread, even if the acting is often mediocre at best. Once the film begins to explain it’s mystery, it begins to rapidly fall apart into a pretentious, incoherent mess. The late great hostage negotiator Charles Durning (Dog Day Afternoon) is predictably reliable here as a private investigator whose storyline helps create one of the most unnecessary and lackluster endings I’ve ever seen in a thriller.
