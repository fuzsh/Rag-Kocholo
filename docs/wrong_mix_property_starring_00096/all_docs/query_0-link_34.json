Personnel being transferred by helicopter require training to be prepared in case they need to escape the aircraft in the event of an emergency landing on water.\n\nReceipt of the MassCEC grant will allow the Academy’s Maritime Center for Responsible Energy (MCRE), in cooperation with training partner RelyOn Nutec, to move forward with construction of a HUET unit in the campus’ underutilized, Olympic-sized swimming pool. Construction is estimated to take two years, and upon completion the training unit will fall under the supervision of MCRE.\n\nThe Academy projects that it could train approximately 320 participants per year. Focus areas will be the Cape & Islands and the South Coast of Massachusetts with established partners and industry professionals seeking training. The Academy will have the ability to support participants from throughout the Commonwealth and beyond, allowing them to take advantage of the HUET unit.\n\n“The Academy has been a leader in offshore wind training, and this grant allows us to further expand our trainings while offering a complete approach to preparing people for careers in offshore wind development,” said Maritime Center for Responsible Energy (MCRE) Executive Director Captain Michael R. Burns, Jr.\n\n“Massachusetts needs to mobilize over 34,000 additional workers to meet our climate goals, and offshore wind is poised to become our largest source of clean energy,” said MassCEC CEO Dr. Emily Reichert. “MassCEC is supporting this industry through key investments in infrastructure, innovation, and workforce development. We’re investing in offshore wind port infrastructure in New Bedford and Salem, and we’re investing in people through programs like Offshore Wind Works. The organizations awarded today are building an equitable workforce that will have the skills and talent to make Massachusetts the national hub for the emerging East Coast offshore wind industry.”\n\n“We are grateful to the MassCEC and the Healey-Driscoll Administration for this substantial grant to build a HUET unit on our campus,” said Rear Admiral Francis X. McDonald, USMS, president of the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. “The need for helicopter underwater escape training has become increasingly important as offshore wind projects gain momentum in this country’s transition to cleaner energy sources.”\n\nAbout Massachusetts Maritime Academy : is a fully accredited, four-year, co-educational state university offering Bachelor and Master of Science degrees that are highly regarded in the worldwide maritime industry and beyond.

Young\n\nScholarship to be established in the name of World War I veteran\n\nBUZZARDS BAY, PROVINCETOWN, MA, ISSUED DECEMBER 4, 2023… Massachusetts Maritime Academy ( www.maritime.edu), a top-ranked public university with undergraduate degree programs focusing on science, engineering, technology, math, and business that blend academics and experiential learning, is the recent recipient of a $50,000 donation from the Provincetown VFW Post 3152 to establish an annual scholarship in tribute to Lewis Armstrong Young, a Provincetown native and World War I veteran who died in 1918.\n\nMerchant Marine Captain Allan Metcalfe, vice president of operations, represented the Academy during the October 15th check presentation.\n\nLewis Armstrong Young enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve Force as a machinist’s mate in July of 1917 and was assigned to the U.S.S. Marietta, a schooner-rigged gunboat engaged in convoy duty. In October of 1918 he died onboard the Marietta from the influenza pandemic. He was buried in France, at a plot assigned to the U.S. Navy; in 1920 he was brought home to Provincetown where he was buried with full military honors.\n\nIn the 1930s, charter members of the Provincetown Veterans of Foreign Wars named their post in honor of Young. The VFW building bearing Young’s name was razed in 2020 – that, coupled with a decline in membership has precipitated the dissolution of Post 3152. The $50,000 donation to the Academy served as one of the final acts of VFW Post 3152 before its closure.\n\n“The Lewis Armstrong Young Scholarship will keep the legacy of the Provincetown hometown hero alive,” said Captain Metcalfe, noting he was “deeply moved” by the recent check presentation. “The Academy is grateful to VFW Post 3152 not only for this significant donation, but also for its work over the many years as an advocate on behalf of local veterans.”\n\nAbout Massachusetts Maritime Academy: Massachusetts Maritime Academy is a fully accredited, co-educational, state university offering Bachelor and Master of Science degrees that are highly regarded in the worldwide maritime industry and beyond.

Through DEI programs, global learning, and inclusive leadership practices, we reflect on our past, acknowledge our present, and strive for a more equitable future. This is the only way to move forward as a society.”\n\n\"Through the Captain Paul Cuffe Center, the Academy will be able to further support this mission with a designated space for all students to tell their stories with a team that is ready to show its support to current and future cadets,” said 1/c Bridget Ruiz, regimental diversity and inclusion officer. \"When we come together and support a common cause or shared vision, our view broadens and we're able to recognize things that we never could have seen on our own. As proven here today we are not alone in our shared vision, and together as shipmates and as a community we can ensure cadets of all backgrounds have bright futures.\"\n\nDescendants of Captain Paul Cuffe, including 4th great grandson Robert Kelley, were guests of honor.

He went on to become a successful mariner, whaling captain, merchant, entrepreneur, and abolitionist, who used his influence to enact change for people of color in the maritime industry.\n\nHe also established the first integrated school, located in Westport, Massachusetts, where students of all races were welcomed to learn together. In 1812, Cuffe was one of the first Black men to formally meet with a sitting U.S. president (James Madison) and was likely the wealthiest Black man in America during the course of his life, making his fortunes sailing the Atlantic and New England coastline. The captain fought for change in the voting rights of Black men, and risked imprisonment and enslavement in his efforts toward social justice.\n\nIn striving for Inclusive Excellence, the Captain Paul Cuffe Center for Inclusion seeks to foster a sense of belonging and supportive environment for students of all backgrounds. Efforts include diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and events, international student services, education abroad experiences, bias incident response, The Women's Coalition, advice for first-generation students, and support for LGBTQ+ students.\n\nAbout Massachusetts Maritime Academy: Massachusetts Maritime Academy is a fully accredited, co-educational, state university offering Bachelor and Master of Science degrees that are highly regarded in the worldwide maritime industry and beyond.
