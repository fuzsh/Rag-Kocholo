        "text": "Think back to a distant time, a time when boy bands roamed the planet and Beanie Babies promised untold riches for those canny enough to see the value in mass-produced stuffed animals. It was 1993, and the two biggest films were Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park and Chris Columbus’ Mrs. Doubtfire. The two movies don’t have much in common (except that they both star relentless dinosaurs), but they do share one major thing: straightforward, un-ironic takes on their genres. Jurassic Park is a rousing adventure tale positing man vs. velociraptor without ambiguity or subtext, while Mrs. Doubtfire pitted Robin Williams against the venerable comic conceit of Robin Williams being funny.\n\nBut one of the more notable box office bombs of the year tried to do something a little different. Last Action Hero is both a full-on action movie and a satire of the same; it undermines the concept of invulnerable heroes, cool explosions and dastardly villains while still being the kind of movie that features them. For audiences clearly favoring movies wherein they could enter the theater and switch off, the balance between laughing at a genre and enjoying it at the same must have been a bit much, even when Arnold Schwarzenegger was the star. At the time, the once and future Governator was the preeminent action star, iconic while still well within his prime; while there was room enough for the Stallones and Van Dammes of the world (both of whom make cameos in Last Action Hero), there was no doubt that Schwarzenegger was the king of action. And more than that, Last Action Hero was directed by John McTiernan, who helmed Die Hard and Predator; it was written by Shane Black (of Lethal Weapon fame) and David Arnott. It also had uncredited work by William Goldman, that living incarnation of rewritten screenplays. That’s a lot of pedigree for a movie that quickly became a running joke for Columbia Pictures. So what happened?\n\nSimply put, Last Action Hero was ahead of its time. In 1993, the Die Hard and Lethal Weapon franchises were still going strong with their mixture of badass, stoic heroes and dark humor. Schwarzenegger had made successful forays into comedy, but Last Action Hero was the first time he had full-on parodied himself, and, by extension, the entire genre he represented. In Last Action Hero, Schwarzenegger plays a maverick cop named Jack Slater, constantly armed to the teeth, chomping a cigar and ready with a quip. Within the first few minutes of the film, there’s a slew of references to the action genre, including a skyscraper hostage situation on Christmas, Tom Noonan as a creepy villain and Slater’s African-American commanding officer bellowing ineffectual orders at him. Then the screen flickers out and we find it’s not as simple as that; in the world of Last Action Hero, Schwarzenegger is not Slater but actually Schwarzenegger, the star of a fictional film series about Jack Slater, movies which happen to be watched obsessively by a lonely boy named Danny (Austin O’Brien) in a rundown New York cinema.\n\nAt the time, meta-fiction wasn’t much in style, and self-parody of action wouldn’t reach the level of The Expendables for another 17 years. But Last Action Hero was determined to have its cake and eat it too, with Danny enjoying action movies for their cheesiness and catchphrases and while still being a character within a cheesy movie full of catchphrases. In the movie’s central (and thinnest) conceit, Danny is given a magic ticket once owned by Harry Houdini (who was a staunch lifelong opponent of the supernatural, but whatever) that allows him to enter Slater’s universe, essentially becoming a fictional character in a nested fictional world. There, the world operates on the rules of the action flick, so the bad guys always lose, Slater can survive a gunshot with only a flesh wound and every single woman in the world is a latex-clad supermodel. There’s even a cartoon cat detective named Whiskers (voiced by Danny DeVito) at whom no one except Danny even blinks.\n\nOn the surface, Last Action Hero is a thick slab of cheese stuffed with gunfire. Beneath the surface…well, it’s still pretty cheesy, but there are loving barbs and sly commentary on the genre throughout the whole film. When Danny and Slater arrive at his apartment, it’s completely blank and unfurnished, as befits a man who has no actual life outside of the action on the screen; similarly, his closet is filled with nothing but identical copies of his trademark outfit. When the main villain, a ruthless, one-eyed assassin named Benedict (Charles Dance, stealing every scene he’s in) escapes into the “real” world, he’s delighted to find himself in a city where, as he puts it, “the bad guys can win”. He promptly murders a man in cold blood and then announces what he’s done aloud to see if any cops come. None do. Similarly, Slater is astonished to find that when he shoots a taxi in the real world, it doesn’t immediately explode, as cars explode in his world for little to no reason. There’s even a running background gag in the film-within-a-film in which cop after cop is persistently matched with their exact opposite number, in true buddy cop movie fashion.\n\nAt the time, the world just wasn’t ready for their badass, bulletproof heroes to make fun of themselves or even highlight their weaknesses. Midway through the film, Schwarzenegger-as-Slater takes a surprisingly poignant moment to reflect on how everything around him just seems to get crazier as time goes on; as Danny points out, that’s because sequels always have to up the ante, and not to worry, he can’t die until the grosses begin to fall. Last Action Hero is a flawed movie, but it was prescient in many ways, predicting the action mash-ups that have become popular and skewering its own tropes. That, and it’s fun to watch taxis blow up and then mutter, “better catch a cab.”"
