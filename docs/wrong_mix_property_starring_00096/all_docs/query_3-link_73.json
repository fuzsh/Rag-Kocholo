        "text": "2.17\n\nC+\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\n“A movie with objective problems that gets the subjective benefit of the doubt, like Shane describes, can rise higher than a B+, but the subjective part has to be blinding in the face of objective weakness.”\n\nKissel said this on Tuesday when talking about our favorite movies compared to our best movies. I think this is a perfect starting point for judging Way of the Dragon. Can a kung fu movie ever be better than a B+?\n\nBefore we get to that, I want to throw this out there: A proper kung fu movie does not rely on computer or other special effects. Green screen background is one thing, but adjusting the way in which a person moves is boring. Computer imaging of Cameron Diaz doing flips is garbage. Give me Tony Jaa jumping off an elephant any day. Kung fu demands a certain physicality. So that’s where I am with categorizing a kung fu movie.\n\nSo, this is Bruce Lee’s debut as a director and writer and I’ll bring up some of his choices here before discussing his presence as a character.\n\nThe pacing of this movie is pretty solid in the beginning. Things are happening. This is something that Hart Man has made me more aware of. Even when we’re just getting to know the characters, is something interesting or amusing going on? Lee eating soup is interesting because it’s telling us something: Here is a stranger in a strange land. We see Lee get picked up but the hot Italian chick. We’re now told Lee is pretty desirable. I also love that scene because it crushed my normal bias going in. I just didn’t expect a woman to be hitting on an Asian dude. Now I know better. So just between two scenes that happen pretty quickly and could have been throwaways, we’ve learned something. Not to mention that Lee has enough timing to make this scenes kind of funny. Unfortunately, while the first 60 minutes balanced things happening and the growth of characters, the final 30 minutes happened too fast. This flick could have used an extra 10-15 minutes. I’m still not sure what to think of the uncle’s betrayal. The last third of the film was just too forced even though the fight scenes were damn near perfect.\n\nThe choreography for the fight scenes is done pretty well I think. Of course, that first set of thugs looks pretty goofy. But with the actors who know what they’re doing… Those are amazing. But reading interviews about Lee, he really hit the shit out of people. They tried minimizing it, but the guy was a beast. There’s also a lot that he had to dumb down. He was too dang fast for it to be believable. I’ve watched some of these scenes in slow-mo and when I think he’s whiffing on people, he’s actually hit them twice. But then again, that first set of thugs. Ouch. That was not impressive by normal movie standards. Additionally, I love how many empty cardboard boxes are just laying around Rome.\n\nLee also got a bit aggressive on the camera angles. Some were great, but some were just trying to be creative for creativity’s sake. I feel like he watched a few Spaghetti Westerns and attempted to recreate those scenes. Specifically, a scene at the Coliseum brought me directly back to The Good, The Bad, The Ugly. Kudos for going big, but still the execution failed in a few scenes.\n\nLee does a pretty good job here. He’s got great timing with the comedy and obviously the guy is physically out of this world. It’s hard to say how good his acting is overall because of the dubbing, however. I love Lee’s arrogance because he has the charisma and the skill to back it up.\n\nThe rest of the cast is likewise hard to judge. Were they good acting on a technical level? I have no idea. This ultimately can only hurt a movie, not help it.\n\nWe do have to talk about Chuck Norris because he’s Chuck Norris. His acting here is nearly as limited as his political analytical abilities. But he does OK here. RIP his chest hair. But at least with his fight, we finally get some stakes. Norris starts of as his equal before Lee just turns on the afterburners and kills him.\n\nBut let’s talk about the bad guy’s right-hand man. The presence of the actor playing it was pretty good. Is he 70’s pimp? Is he slick Chinese business man? Is he gay? I could say yes to all these things. The guy convinces me from a physical standpoint. The voice dubbing over him is hilarious and is what people copy now when they’re being racist. I love giving bonus points to movies that have made subtle cultural (low brow or high brow) additions. That guy’s voice is the same voice we’ve used or heard used during a racist joke about Asians.\n\n“I want to call… AMERICA.” I died on that line. I don’t know if it was a joke or serious.\n\nKung fu is the real star of the movie. That’s the movie’s strength and weakness. The moves, to me, are mesmerizing. Bruce Lee is incredibly fast. Chuck Norris added the element of power to the stealth. Watching those two fight was a pleasure. BUT, it’s limited. Kung fu isn’t a character. We can’t explore its depth. It has no motivation. It just is. Because it’s the focus, we end up with goofy plotlines with serious holes because we have to have the fighting. Forcing something is never healthy for a movie. The dialogue becomes bookends to prop up what the movie is about, which is badass martial artists doing their thing. The dialogue can never really –add- to the kung fu.\n\nBut visuals can be added. We see it in Way of the Dragon with some stylistic choices. The cat playing with a toy as Lee crushed Norris was a nice touch, though a bit corny by today’s standards. In Ong Bak, we see tons of colors and outfits that add to the fight. And seriously, Tony Jaa uses an elephant’s tusks the way a gymnasts uses the uneven bars. Entertaining, of course but it can never be emotional.\n\nSo, can a true kung fu movie ever be above a B+? I say probably not.\n\nWay of the Dragon: B+\n\nStray observations:\n\n-He really likes soup\n\n-The scene of him awkwardly figuring out if the girl looking for someone was the girl he was looking for. Great observational comedy.\n\n-He abused those toilets.\n\n-I like that it was dubbed into English, but he couldn’t read English.\n\n-He scared that kid into dropping his ice cream. For no reason. AWESOME.\n\n2.81\n\nC+\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\nWell, I chose The Fisher King because I was browsing the Netflix Robin Williams collection and noticed I hadn't ever watched it. Considering its favorable ratings and awards/nominations, I was pretty surprised I missed it. Glad we remedied that!\n\nRobin Williams was brilliant and it's no wonder why he was nominated for an Academy Award here. This is the kind of role I think he was best at. While there's some seriousness to the film, he really delivers the comedy. That's not to take away from Jeff Bridges, who did fine in the supporting role and was spot on with his deliver. There were a few moments where we had a glimpse what was coming from his as Lebowski. Mercedes Ruehl won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. I thought she played the character great and compliment Bridges really well in their relationship. I thought Michael Jeter and Tom Waits were outstanding in their minor parts... I didn't even know Waits was in it (apparently, it was uncredited)\n\nClocking in over 130 minutes, I was prepared for a long and stretched out movie. It was a pleasant surprise that the movie kept a decent pace and had my attention throughout. It had a good beginning with Jack in the studio, setting up his character as a shock jock radio personality that wasn't just playing the part on the air. We knew something was up with that last caller, and I think the scene was set up really well with Jack being as high on himself as anybody could be. I really liked the practicing of the sitcom line he was slated to deliver, 'forgive me!' just before everything came down with the news.\n\nOur introduction to Parry was even better. Forget a gradual lead in to his situation... we're given a full on attack with his mental issues at the forefront... gallantly doing his duty as a knight, saving Jack from the assault and himself. I really liked the way Parry's mind was presented to us. The Red Knight made his fear a priority... it highlighted his issues from the tragedy and made them, along with his quest, as real to us as they were to him. There was a nice lead up to his big confrontation with the incident, and it was a bit of a shock to see the shooting... but I think it really made an impact to see him go through it leading us into the sad moment when he was brutally attacked by the same two guys from earlier, and more so repressed memories.\n\nWhile we were served up a very convenient and happy ending... I liked it. I liked how Jack went about getting the Holy Grail (and that it was a simple trophy). I thought it was great that they included the line, \"thank god nobody looks up in this town\" answering any question from the audience of how nobody notices him. We have talked about multiple movies needing lines like thrown in... they're not absolutely necessary, but the add a little bit to the film.\n\nOne of the elements I like the most about The Fisher King is the call-backs. The most notable is Pinocchio... especially when Parry calls Jack out on the little lie about his girlfriend. (This also gave us a great, and fitting, joke... Where would King Arthur be without Guinevere?... Happily married, probably) Also, the continual clumsiness of Lydia... from the books, to the dumplings, to the movies and back to the dumplings with Parry. Even little lines such as when Jack sees the red knight on the stained glass window and says, \"I'm hearing horses now, Parry would be so pleased...\" I just thought it was really well done, and the timing with each was handled nicely. Even the ending an bringing them back to Central Park... It felt complete and right.\n\nI thought there were three scenes that really stood out... two of them really outstanding. One was the office scene with Michael Jeter singing to Lydia. While it wasn't an overly important scene to the movie, it was funny and entertaining and showed Jack's personality changing (smiling in the elevator, noticing himself that he's on on a first name basis with the homeless people) and how much he was looking to get Lydia to notice Parry. Mostly, just a fun scene with the singing. Now, the two best scenes for me were the waltz in Grand Central Station and the first scene in Central Park. The really gave us the best view of Parry, away from his demons. Both scenes were also played perfectly by Williams.\n\nWith all that, it wasn't a perfect movie and I have a couple minor gripes. I liked the use of 'Hit the Road Jack' and 'I've Got the Power,' but there were times when the score just didn't do it for me. That's probably more a product of it being out dated, and it wasn't so horrific that it ruined any scene for me... but once or twice I caught myself thinking 'eh' about the music. The other minor problem for me was with the editing/cut choices. A couple scene breaks seemed a little too sharp, but the thing that stuck out to me the most was the dinner scene. I think this was a good scene, that could have been great... even up there with the Central Park and Grand Central station parts. The problem I had was the use of the transition effect. I understand that it was used to show the passage of time, but it felt disconnect from the rest of the film... and it wasn't really the type of montage that called for the distinction. For me, at least, it would have been better with each cut showing us a wide view of the restaurant, more empty each time until we end on the final shot of the scene with the place looking bare other than the seemingly annoyed employees.\n\nOverall, I think it's pretty clear, I absolutely enjoyed The Fisher King. I'm sure there's more I could talk about (including the story of the Fisher King and the portrayal/message of homelessness, perhaps), but I want to wrap this up for now. With my minor complaints, I still loved the movie and it ends up slotting into, I think, the 2nd slot for Robin Williams movies for me, behind Dead Poet's Society and just a head of What Dreams May Come... pulling in a solid A grade. It also provides us with a strong Mediocre Best Actor candidate.\n\n2.50\n\nC+/b-\n\n\"\"\n\n\"\"\n\n\"\"\n\nRemember the Fox SNL knock-off MadTV? Remember the recurring skit \"Lowered Expectations?\" Maybe I should have watched a bunch of those before watching Manhunter. I only actually remembered the soft voiced intro and outro to the skits and not that they were about losers dating. I watched a few a minute ago to link onto this post but they were terrible so I won't link them as a courtesy to you all.\n\nI'm skipping the plot summary- if you're reading you watched it.\n\nLet's just bullet some complaints that all admittedly arrive directly from my expectations of the film based on my experience with the characters.\n\nHannibal Lecter, or Lecktor as its spelled in Manhunter is about my all-time favorite character and Manhunter gave him what seemed like 7 minutes or less of screen time.\n\nBrian Cox comes in a distant 3rd for me in Hannibal performances although I'm not sure it was his fault. I thought his greased back hair looked like a slack-jawed southerner instead of a regal gentleman like Hopkins.\n\nDennis Ferina is great as a tough recovering alcoholic NYC cop, unfortunately he doesn't work as Agent in Charge of the Behavioral Science Division of the FBI. He's an actor who is always on point reacting but totally unbelievable in a thinking mans role which this should be.\n\nI just don't like William Peterson I don't think he's a very good actor (CSI sucks) and I hated the way he portrayed Will Graham. Fun fact about Peterson- turned down the role of Henry Hill in Goodfellas- thank Christ! When he's introduced to us here he's apparently retired after a mental breakdown following the capture of Lecter and living in a million dollar beach house. His wife (hire Glenn Close- too expensive- hire Glenn Close like- done) must make huge money because I can't imagine former profiler pays that well. He doesn't play the part like someone on the verge of a breakdown- he shows no vulnerability, no fear, no signs that he is torn about re-entering the field other than saying that he doesn't want to go through it again. His interactions with Lecter are confrontational, he's using Hannibal who correctly points out that Will thinks he's smarter than him. Again, my expectations hurt the roles here because the give and take between Will and Hannibal on the NBC series is what makes the show so strong. Will is vulnerable, frail, mentally unstable but undeniably gifted and shares a mutal respect and admiration with Hannibal despite the fact they are adversaries.\n\nTom Noonan was fantastic. Totally believable, scary and creepy, all the good things. A+ performance as the Tooth Fairy.\n\nI think of the Hannibal series as Psychological Thriller- Manhunter I'd classify as more Intense Thriller which was probably due to some super 80s cocaine. I especially felt that when Will went charging headfirst through the picture window right into a beating from the Tooth Fairy. Made me smile thinking of (NBC series spolier alert) the exact opposite thing occurring when the guy who tried to be an animal charged into a shotgun blast from a waiting Will.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBWSocJMChA\n\nBased on my preconceived notions for everything I'd go C-, but I supposed it was an entertaining movie and had this been my introduction to the series it'd rate higher. I'll settle on C+.\n\n3.52\n\nA-\n\n\"\"\n\n\"\"\n\n\"\"\n\nWhere to begin? So much to discuss with this film. A good place to start is with the vetoes.\n\nI really wanted everyone to watch the 30 for 30 on Bo Jackson because he is the greatest athlete of all time. No one could play at that kind of elite level like Jackson and it probably would have been watched until Joe reared his head for the first time of the round to vindictively veto this good film because I vetoed his first choice. Yeah, I still refuse to purchase Amazon Prime for a documentary about soccer - unless it's about Pele. No ragrets!\n\nI had a feeling Joe would do that so I had another 30 for 30 in mind over the 2003 Bartman game. Since he couldn't veto again, I thought I was in the clear and then Bryan surprisingly appears to spend his veto. His reasoning was that he's seen some good movies and wanted to keep that going. Mind you, this comes from the guy who picked a movie worse than Drinking Buddies and said he would never veto. I think it is because my second pick was over the Cubs. That didn't bother me either but I thought it was great when he stated his displeasure of it (score!). I almost picked Four Days in October so Phil could veto but I think everyone had enough of the veto power and I didn't want to read Bobby argue nonsense about Mark \"I had one moment and a bunch of errors\" Bellhorn. Frickin' Bellhorn.\n\nThen I chose Boyz N the Hood. I saw this awhile ago but needed a refresher and was thrilled Netflix had it. I don't particularly pay attention to directors unless its Whedon, Spielberg, Bay, Bruckheimer, Burton, and Lucas. Outside of them, it matters little to me. \"Can you make a good film?\" is the only requirement directors have for me. In John Singleton's case, he made a cult classic.\n\nThree years ago NPR did a story on \"Morning Edition\" on Boyz N the Hood and John Ridley interviewed Singleton about the film. Singleton stated that while he loved the films from the 80s, they did not look like him or his situation. So what Singleton, who was taught directing by Francis Ford Coppola and was 22 years old, made was a film about a group of black friends growing up South Central Los Angeles. What came from it, well, not even Singleton could foretell.\n\nThe importance of Boyz N the Hood is opens up the eyes of suburbia, white America to life in of hoodlem, black America. Gang violence, crack heads, single motherhood were all out of surburbia, white America's mainstream in 1991. Watching the film nowadays, there is nothing shocking about it. If a young teen watched Boyz N the Hood today, he/she would think he watched everyday life. For me, on the other hand, growing up in Hicktown, Indiana, this was pretty surreal. I remember watching it for the first time in 1996 and I couldn't believe what I saw. High school students shooting each other because one felt disrespected? For real? For a 14 year old in Hicktown, Indiana, that question was on my mind.\n\nMostly, the movie had great acting. This film put Cuba Gooding, Jr., on the map. He was sensational. He owned the scene when was confronted by the black cop and returned to Brandi's house. His frustration with his inability to fight with the police glowed. The viewer could sense his anger in that scene. Another great part was when he felt compelled to lie to his father Furious about the girl he did not bang. Viewer had no clue that it was a lie until the next scene when Ricky gets in the blue slugbug.\n\nNext was Laurence Fishburne who absolutely nailed the part of Furious Styles. He wanted to be the father apparently he never had and/or what Doughboy, Ricky, or Chris never had. Was he a rough father? Absolutely but it was necessary. Furious knew what he had to do and he did it but did so in a positive way. You know Tre wanted to please Furious and that was evident when Tre returns home after leaving the car. He walks into the house, Furious sees him, Tre walks closer, Furious turns around into his room and slams the door. No words in that scene, just emotion of disappointment.\n\nIce Cube playing Doughboy, or Darren, was pretty fantastic. He nailed the hustler role probably because he came from Compton and rapped about it in the N.W.A. and his early recordings. He understood that role and life but more importantly than all of that was his ability to capture it on screen. This was Ice Cube's first acting role and there was no trace of it. I was able to put myself in Doughboy's shoes when he shot those two other guys. They took his brother away from him. When that happens, you want to pull the trigger and in this case he did. Good stuff from Ice Cube.\n\nAngela Basset's role was minor. She was Reva Styles, Tre's mother. She wanted to play a role in his life but she ultimately chose her career over her son. Yes, they had an agreement, which Tre violated, but she could have been there for him. What we don't see is the role she played from 1984 - 1991. We are led to believe, however, that she was absent from Tre's rearing. Basset is a fantastic actress and her best role is when she played Tina Turner in What's Love Got to Do with It?, which oddly enough Laurence Fishburne plays Ike. Definitely worth a view.\n\nThe aspect that bugged me was what I call the go betweens - when someone talks at one location and then the viewer sees another person saying something else in a different location but apparently they are saying it at the same time. For instance when Doughboy was talking to the crew about something I forget and Tre was talking to Brandi about their relationship, that sequence of go betweens was choppy and bad. It made me squirm and I couldn't deal with that. In its defense, it was 1989/1990 and that sequence can be fine tuned today but regardless, it annoyed me.\n\nI also didn't appreciate the misogynistic nature of Doughboy. Cube did fine playing it but it played up to the stereotype that black men are stupid sexists. Doughboy had a different upbringing than his half brother Ricky and maybe he felt slighted by his mother for that but that is no reason to consistently tell a woman those things.\n\nAll in all, it was a raw story that opened up the eyes of white America. This film came out before the O.J. trial, before the Rodney King incident, and before gangster rap emerged into mainstream radio. Boyz N the Hood was really good."
