        "text": "2024 PREAKNESS\n\nfirst edition\n\nWhen: Saturday, May 18\n\nWhere: Baltimore, Maryland\n\nTV: NBC at 7:01. Earlier races on CNBC or Fanduel (nee TVG)\n\nThe factual information contained herein is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\n*****\n\nThere are discussions — as there always are — of changing the Triple Crown schedule because of the view that today’s trainers are not willing to submit their horses to the compressed five-week schedule. I am all in favor of doing what is right by the horse. Indeed, that should be the sine qua non. But I think current routines, including the use of medications and supplements could be more of a factor than the fragility of the animal.\n\nWith the scratch of the horse likely to be the favorite with a real possibility of winning, we are looking at a field of only eight. I cannot say I am overwhelmed by excitement.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nHere is the field in post-position order with trainers and jockeys. The numbers in parentheses are Beyer speed figures where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number in the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) Mugatu (Jeff Engler/Joe Bravo) – His lone career win in 12 starts came on a synthetic track (62). He has yet to hit the board in three starts on a dirt surface, but his last effort earned a career best Beyer of 87 in the Grade 1 Blue Grass.\n\n2) Uncle Heavy (Robert E. Reid, Jr./Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – He has three career wins in five starts including the Grade 3 Withers on a muddy Aqueduct surface (84). His most recent start was an unimpressive fifth in the Grade 2 Wood Memorial (74).\n\n3) Catching Freedom (Brad Cox/Flavien Prat) – He ran a solid fourth in the Derby, finishing only 1 ¾ lengths back, and pairing up 97 Beyers in his last two starts.\n\n4) Muth – SCRATCHED\n\n5) Mystik Dan (Ken McPeek/Brian Hernandez, Jr.) – Only one other horse exited the Derby with two Beyers hitting 100’s and that one is not here. One of the triple digits was an eight-length win on a muddy Oaklawn surface which is not going to diminish his appeal here.\n\n6) Seize the Grey (Wayne Lukas/Jose Torres) – If you like racing partnerships with thousands of owners (seriously), this is the horse for you. He won a graded stake on the First Saturday in May at Churchill Downs but it was the Pat Day Mile. For that win he earned his career best Beyer of 88.\n\n7) Just Steel (Wayne Lukas/Joel Rosario) – Just when you think Wayne Lukas is going to retire, he trains 25 percent of the field in the Preakness. His Arkansas Derby Beyer of 95 was a career best, but the only one in 12 starts that exceeds 90.\n\n8) Tuscan Gold (Chad Brown/Tyler Gaffalione) – It’s always difficult to ignore a Chad Brown horse. This one has only three career starts with increasing Beyers, topping out with a 95 In the Louisiana Derby only 1 ¾ lengths in arrears to Catching Freedom.\n\n9) Imagination (Bob Baffert/Frankie Dettori) – A handicapping theory that often leads to nice scores is “don’t ignore the lesser half of the entry.” While Baffert no longer has the morning-line favorite who scratched, this guy warrants a close look. He was a million-dollar purchase as a yearling and has finished in the exacta in six career starts, earning a Beyer top of 96 in the Grade 2 San Felipe.\n\nTHE WEATHER\n\nThe track has been muddy and there is a chance for more rain.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nI can only see four possible winners here: Catching Freedom, Mystik Dan, Tuscan Gold and Imagination. As averse as I am to betting the chalk, I think the Derby winner is the best value at 3-1 as I post this.\n\n© Tom Noonan 2024\n\nKentucky Derby 2024\n\nFirst Edition\n\nWHEN: Saturday, May 4\n\nWHERE: Louisville, Kentucky\n\nTV: NBC/USA Network starting at noon; race off at 6:57\n\nThis is the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby. Despite its age, Churchill Downs is always seeking to grow the fan base, particularly among younger potential patrons. That must be why several years ago they introduced the concept of “seat license fees” where for a mere $2,000 one could purchase the “right” for five years to pay several hundred dollars for a seat on a metal bench in the open air exposed to the sun or the elements.\n\nThis year they constructed banks of seats around the renovated paddock. It is actually an attractive venue although I can only imagine the cost (to patrons, that is).\n\nThen there is the new themed restaurant. The theme is Sports Illustrated covers. For those of my generation, SI borders on a sacred institution. I have read countless narratives of how we used to eagerly await that week’s delivery of our subscription. Then they stopped publishing on a weekly basis, Then they started publishing AI-generated articles. Now they are awash in some kind of financial scandal. But nostalgia has its value, especially when you are celebrating 150 years of existence.\n\nBut if all of the above is a little too pricy to attract younger people, the call to the post this year will be made by Martha Stewart – really.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nThe factual information following is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\nI rely heavily on Beyer speed figures (published in the DRF, where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number within the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) Dornoch (Danny Gargan/Luis Saez) – The last time a horse won from the first hole was 1986 with Ferdinand. The theory is that in a large field, horses will be rushing to get to the rai, compromising the horse on the inside unless he can get out away from the field early. While that is this guy’s style, his Beyer top is a 91, albeit on a muddy track at Aqueduct.\n\n2) Sierra Leone (Chad Brown/Tyler Gaffalione) – He projects to be the second betting choice based on two wins in graded stakes including the Grade 1 Blue Grass where he ran his top Beyer of 98. His closing style of running would turn out to be an issue if he cannot work out a trip through the 20-horse field.\n\n3) Mystik Dan (Ken McPeek/Brian Hernandez, Jr) – Only one entrant has a higher Beyer than the 101 he got in Oaklawn’s Grade 3 Southwest – on a muddy track. (According to Randy Moss on the TDN Writers’ Room, he benefitted from a strong rail bias in play that day.) His next race resulted in an 89 Beyer finishing third in the Arkansas Derby 4 ¼ lengths behind Just steel.\n\n4) Catching Freedom (Brad Cox/Flavien Prat) – He won the Louisiana Derby at 1 3/16 miles, earning a 97 Beyer. He has some sharp morning works at Churchill and is going to post under the combo of one of the best trainers and jocks in the game.\n\n5) Catalytic (Saffie Joseph, Jr./Jose Ortiz) – He has three career starts with one win. After racing near the front in the Florida Derby he was inhaled by Fierceness, finishing 13 lengths back but earning his career best Beyer of 90.\n\n6) Just Steel (Wayne Lukas/Keith Asmussen) – He is the most experienced entrant with11 career starts and running for the most experienced trainer, the 88-year old “Coach.” He startled the Arkansas Derby running a solid second, earning a Beyer top of 95, but there is little else to recommend him.\n\n7) Honor Marie (Whitworth D. Beckham/Ben Curtis) – Talk about unknown connections. The trainer worked for Todd Pletcher and Chad Brown so he knows about winning. Jockey Curtis is a respected rider in Europe. The colt won Churchill’s Kentucky Jockey Club at two (92) and ran a good second in the Louisiana Derby (96).\n\n8) Just a Touch (Brad Cox/Florent Geroux) – Unraced at two but running increasing Beyers this year, culminating in a 96 with a second place in the Blue Grass.\n\n9) Encino – SCRATCHED\n\n!0) T O Password (Daisuke Takayanagi/K. Kimura) – One of two entrants from Japan, this guy is undefeated to two starts but has never faced accomplished foreign runners.\n\n11) Forever Young Yoshito Yahagi/R. Sakai) – The other Japanese entrant is also undefeated, nut among his five wins are solid wins in the Saudi Derby and the UAE Derby. My pattern with Timeform speed ratings is to subtract 12 from Timeform’s 107 and 101, still giving him respectable Beyer comps. But Randy Moss who knows even more than I do about Beyer numbers has computed 101 for each of the Gulf races.\n\n12) Track Phantom (Steve Asmussen/Joel Rosario) – He shows an increasing pattern of Beyers in seven career starts, culminating in 94’s in the Louisiana Derby and Risen Star. In the former he finished fourth by 21/2 lengths behind Catching Freedom and Honor Marie.\n\n13) West Saratoga (Larry Demerrite/Jesus Castanon) – This year’s “feel good” story features the trainer who has twice survived “you only haze x to live” diagnoses. Unfortunately the horse has nothing 16)\n\n14) Endlessly (Michael McCarthy/Umberto Rispoli) – This will be his first ever dirt race following four starts on the grass and two on a synthetic. His top Beyer of 91 came in the Jeff Ruby Steaks (sic).\n\n15) Domestic Product (Chad Brown/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – A top Beyer of 87 is usually sufficient for me to not even consider for the win spot. Then I look at the Brown-Irad combo; then I see a string of fast works; then I look at odds in excess of 30-1; then I see that he is the only entrant to have ever finished in front of Fierceness. My resolve is crumbled.\n\n16) Grand Mo the First (V. Barboza, Jr./E. Jaramillo) – He is looking for his first win on the dirt, but did finish only a neck back of Domestic Product in the Tampa Bay Derby (82).\n\n17) Fierceness (Todd Pletcher/John Velazquez) – The one thing we know for sure is that he will not be making history by becoming the first horse to win the Derby from post 17. That’s because the scratch inside of him moved him up to post 16. Nut he is still the best horse on paper with three dominating wins including the Grade 1 Florida Derby (110) and Grade 1 Breeders’ Cup Juvenile (105).\n\n18) Stronghold (Phil D’Amato/A. Fresu) – It’s a sign of the declining state of California racing that the Santa Anita Derby winner has a morning-line of 20-1. But you do not have many winners of one of the most productive Derby preps running a mere 89 Beyer.\n\n19) Resilience (Bill Mott/Junior Alvarado) – Speaking of the decline of major Kentucky Derby preps, it has been a long time since Aqueduct’s Wood Memorial has been a significant factor. It has even been downgraded to a Grade 2 and could be in line for a further cut. This guy ran a 90 Beyer, matching the fig he got when fourth in the Risen Star.\n\n20) Society Man (Danny Gargan/Frankie Dettori) – The son of Good Magic ran in his first stakes race after breaking his maiden (82) in March at the Big A. The stakes was the Wood (see above) and his odds were 107-1. He finished second with a Beyer of 87.\n\n21) Epic Ride (John Ennis/A. Beschizza) – His first dirt start resulted in a third, 5 1/4 lengths in arrears to Sierra Leone in the Blue Grass (90).\n\nWeather\n\nLast I saw, there is hope for a sunny day with possibly only passing showers. Unlike yesterday when the tracks were “sloppy/yielding”, today they are “good/good.”\n\nPicks\n\nAs I noted, I think Fierceness is the best horse and I will use him in any multi-race bets and 12th race exotics. But I cannot make win wagers on short-priced horses, although I think 5-2 is a fair price. I am underwhelmed by the likely second favorite horse, Sierra Leone. The horses I think provide the best value are Catching Freedom. Honor Marie, Just a Touch and Forever Young. But the one I have become increasingly interested in is Domestic Product. I will definitely place a win wager on him.\n\n©Tom Noonan 2024\n\n2023 BELMONT STAKES\n\nfirst edition\n\nWhen: Saturday, June 10\n\nWhere: Elmont, New York\n\nTV: FS1 begins its coverage at 11:00 with Fox kicking in at 4:00.\n\nThe race is scheduled to go off at 7:02.\n\nThe factual information contained herein is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\nSo locusts and pestilence must be next — strike that, we had and still have the pestilence. But racing in this Triple Crown season did not need another threat to the health and safety of its participants. Yet it is here in the form of smoke-filled skies coming from our neighbor to the north. As I write this, air quality has improved to the point where Belmont can conduct its Friday card, and hopefully air quality will remain at a level sufficient to allow racing (and normal activity) to happen on Saturday.\n\nRacing has been battered over the last five weeks. There are the still-unexplained fatalities at Churchill Downs followed by a fatal breakdown on the Preakness undercard. While much has been done to improve health and safety, we have not eliminated the tragic occurrences. I will write more about that in the upcoming weeks.\n\nIn addition to the feature, the New York Racing Association loaded up the card with eight other graded stakes – five of which are Grade I’s, — beginning at 12:29. Their explicit purpose was to make for a good day of racing even when a Triple Crown is not on the line. It has ruined many other weekend cards that lost their own graded stakes, but Saturday’s card is a beauty.\n\nIn addition to the feature, the must-see race is the 10th, the Metropolitan Handicap featuring Breeders’ Cup champion Cody’s Wish. If the powers-that-be in racing had a soul, he would have been last year’s Horse of the Year. I would wager that many of the readers of this cannot name the actual winner of that award. But he was an embodiment of the power of money in racing who, after an admittedly spectacular (but short) career, was retired to stud. But for a sport that could use all the favorable attention it can get, Cody’s Wish would have been a no-brainer choice. I defy anyone to watch the story of the horse with his namesake Cody and keep a dry eye.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nHere is the field in post-position order with trainers and jockeys. The numbers in parentheses are Beyer speed figures where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number in the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) Tapit Shoes (Brad Cox/Jose Ortiz) – In a race that may not have a lot of early pace, my suspicion is that trainer Cox entered this one to create a more favorable scenario for his two closers in the field. He has one career win from five starts, with his Beyer top of 91 coming in his last start, a second to Red Route One in Oaklawn’s ungraded Bath House Row (sic) Stake.\n\n2) Tapit Trice (Todd Pletcher/Luis Saez) – After his win in the Blue Grass Stakes (99) the conventional wisdom by the racing commentariat agreed that even if he did not win the Derby, he was a certainty to take this race. He had a difficult trip at Churchill, but finished seventh, 9 ¼ lengths back (94). That was his only off-the-board finish in six starts where he won four races.\n\n3) Arcangelo (Jena Antonucci/Javier Castellano) – He won the Peter Pan (97), the traditional prep for this race. It was only his fourth career win and his second straight W, in a pattern of increasing Beyer numbers.\n\n4) National Treasure (Bob Baffert/Jon Velazquez) – As a sign of the competitiveness of this race, the Preakness winner with a last-race Beyer (98) exceeded by only one entrant is the fourth morning-line pick at 5-1. While that was only his second career win, I think he has been under-estimated despite on-the-board finishes in four Grade 1 stakes.\n\n5) Il Miracolo (Antonio Sano/M. Meneses) – NYRA will be changing the name of this race to the Tapit Stakes for next year. This colt is one of six in this year’s field of nine who was either sired by Tapit or whose dam was. I just stated the only positive about his chances in this Grade 1 race. He has two wins, earning a total of $103K. His Beyer top is a 77, and in five career stakes he lost by a total of 79½ lengths.\n\n6) Forte (Todd Pletcher/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – While National Treasure may be under-estimated, I think this guy may be over-estimated. He is the morning-line favorite (at 5-2) just as he was in the Derby prior to being a vet scratch. He does have four Grade 1 wins (one a disqualificationfor a drug positive), but has not hit his two-year old Beyer top of 100 from the Juvenile.\n\n7) Hit Show (Brad Cox/Manny Franco) – He has won at three different tracks, has increasing Beyers in every start and was near the front in the Derby until he “flattened” out. He finished fifth, 6 ¼ lengths in arrears with his Beyer top of 98.\n\n8) Angel of Empire (Brad Cox/Flavien Prat) – The Kentucky Derby favorite (at 4-1) came from way back to finish third (104) only 1 ½ lengths back. He won the Arkansas Derby (94) for his fourth career win.\n\n9) Red Route One (Steve Asmussen/Joel Rosario) – While he has run creditably in graded stakes, his only dirt win came in Oaklawn’s ungraded Bath House Row Stakes (sic) where he matched his top Beyer of 92. He ran fourth in the Preakness (91), 4 ¾ lengths back.\n\nTHE WEATHER\n\nThe National Weather Service is predicting “mostly sunny” with a high of 78. An Air Quality Alert is in effect until at least midnight Friday.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe only entrants I cannot see winning are Tapit Shoes, Il Miracolo and Red Route One. National Treasure had everything his own way in the Preakness, and it is possible he will be the lone speed, but I think either Tapit Shoes and/or Il Miracolo may go with him. I did not like Forte in the Derby and still do not like him, particularly if he goes off as the favorite. Arcangelo’s “statement” win came in The Peter Pan at Belmont, but he only won by a head over a nondescript group.\n\nOf the remaining three, Hit Show’s morning-line odds of 10-1 makes him an appealing prospect for a win wager. I think Tapit Trice and Angel of Empire are “must use” in the multi-race wagers.\n\nROYAL ASCOT\n\nAn event I have become addicted to is the five-day meeting at Royal Ascot. I witnessed the Queen, whose perhaps only public responsibility is convening Parliament, being advised that the first post was coming up so she could leave on time. She is no longer with us, and I doubt her son has the same love of the sport. After all, he scheduled his coronation on Kentucky Derby Day. It is top quality and entertaining racing with tons of long-shots. Be sure to stay for the end-of-the-card sing-along. Make your prawn and cucumbers sandwiches and chill your champagne. I think it is NBC that broadcasts it, and it runs June 20 through June 24 in the morning on EST.\n\n© Tom Noonan 2023\n\n2023 PREAKNESS\n\nfirst edition\n\nWhen: Saturday, May 20\n\nWhere: Baltimore, Maryland\n\nTV: NBC at 7:01. Earlier races are on TVG/FDTV.\n\nThe factual information contained herein is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\n*****\n\nThere are discussions — as there always are — of changing the Triple Crown schedule because of the view that today’s trainers are not willing to submit their horses to the compressed five-week schedule. I am all in favor of doing what is right by the horse. Indeed, that should be the sine qua non. But I think current routines, including the use of medications and supplements could be more of a factor than the fragility of the animal. Having said that, we are looking at a field with only the Derby winner coming back from the first leg — last year the connections skipped the race.\n\nWith the scratch of the horse likely to be the second choice with a real possibility of winning, we are looking at a field of only seven. I cannot say I am overwhelmed by excitement.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nHere is the field in post-position order with trainers and jockeys. The numbers in parentheses are Beyer speed figures where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number in the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) National Treasure (Bob Baffert/John Velazquez) – Baffert is free of the ban by Churchill Downs and is bringing this colt and the overwhelming favorite for the Black Eyed Susan on Friday who was touted as the best three-year old in the country. She did not win, and despite my high hopes for this one last year, he continues to disappoint. He only has one career win, but has run Beyers in the mid-90’s in four consecutive graded stakes.\n\n2) Chase the Chaos (Ed Moger, Jr./Sheldon Russell) – This is an example of the racing office’s badgering trainers to enter horses in high profile races. His only two dirt races have been less than spectacular with a 73 fig finishing seventh by 17 lengths in Santa Anita’s Grade 2 San Felipe and a 40 on a muddy Canterbury track last August.\n\n3) Mage (Gustavo Delgado/Javier Castellano) – The Derby winner could not have picked a better spot to go for the Triple Crown in three weeks. His Derby Beyer of 105 far exceeds that of any other three-year old. It defies all historical trends that he was able to accomplish this with a prep schedule of three races in two months and a week. I am not going against him again.\n\n4) Coffeewithchris (J.E. Salzman, Jr./Jaime Rodriguez) – Another favor to the racing office. While he is the only entrant with a win at Pimlico, his Beyer top is an 88 for 12 career starts.\n\n5) Red Route One (Steve Asmussen/Joel Rosario) – There were high hopes for him early on, but he was winless in six straight graded stakes. He got off the stakes schneid with a win in the ungraded “BthHseRowL,” matching his Beyer top of 92.\n\n6) Perform (Shug McGaughey/Feargal Lynch) – The trainer must always be respected in stakes races, and this colt is coming off two straight wines. One, however, came in his sixth start as a maiden (79) and then in a Preakness prep, the Federico Tesio (82) where he won by a head at odds of 10-1.\n\n7) Blazing Sevens (Chad Brown/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – One of his two wins came in October’s Champagne during the Belmont at Aqueduct meet (91). He was fourth in the Juvenile (93) and third by six lengths in the Blue Grass (90).\n\n8) First Mission (Brad Cox/Luis Saez) – SCRATCHED\n\nTHE WEATHER\n\nChance of showers, but temps in the 70’s.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nMage is clearly the class of the field in which the balance of the seven horse field probably belongs in a Grade 2 stake (except for the two who are not graded stakes quality). The scratch of potential upsetter First Mission makes this an especially unappealing wagering proposition. I will use the favorite in multiple race bets. I also find a trifecta of the three sired by Good Magic (Mage, Perform and Blazing Sevens) worth a small investment.\n\n© Tom Noonan 2023\n\nKENTUCKY DERBY 2023\n\nOnly Edition\n\nWHEN: Saturday, May 6\n\nWHERE: Louisville, Kentucky\n\nTV: NBC/Peacock starting at noon; race off at 6:57\n\nThis is already one of the most unusual Derbies in recent history — and that is before the horses approach the starting gate. While there are often late scratches after the entries are drawn, the original field of 23 (including the “also eligibles”) is down to 18, with the latest being the scratch of the presumed favorite, Forte, Saturday morning. The three winners of the five major American prep races are all scratched.\n\nThe main development at Churchill this week, however, is a rash of fatalities in the week leading up to the event. Starting two Thursdays ago, four horses have died, including one entered in the field. Two others died “suddenly,” causing the Horse Racing Commission to rule out of the Derby the trainer of those two. I suspect the number of scratches (particularly of presumed favorite Forte) may be related.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nThe factual information following is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\nHere is the field in post-position order with trainers and jockeys. The numbers in parentheses are Beyer speed figures where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number within the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) Hit Show (Brad Cox/Manny Franco) – It’s become an article of faith that a horse breaking from the one-hole cannot win since the last to do it was Ferdinand in 1986. My understanding is that is because the starting gate almost forces horses to head to the rail when the gate opens. Now that the Derby has gone from a two-gate set-up to accommodate 20 horses to a much narrower single gate, I am not sure how valid the theory is. Nonetheless, this guy exits a remarkably unproductive prep, the Wood at Aqueduct. He has been the favorite in all five career starts, winning three, but losing to the 59-1 shot Rocket Can in his last. He has shown a pattern of increasing Beyers, topping out at a 93 in March.\n\n2) Verifying (Brad Cox/Tyler Gaffalione) – If you eliminate a sub-par effort in the Oaklawn slop (85), he is the only horse with back-to-back Beyers in the upper 90’s. He just missed in the Blue Grass (99) by a neck to Tapit Trice.\n\n3) Two Phil’s (Larry Rivelli/Jareth Loveberry) – He may be the most difficult horse to figure out in the field. While he was showing a pattern of increasing Beyers on dirt surfaces, his top fig was an 88 at the Fairgrounds. He then blew away the field on a synthetic surface in the Jeff Ruby Steaks Stakes, winning by 5 ¼, earning the field’s top last-race Beyer of 101. He has four career wins, and just worked a bullet 5 furlongs on the dirt track at Hawthorne.\n\n4) Confidence Game (Keith Desormeaux/James Graham) – As difficult as the preceding guy may be to figure out, he is next on that list. His top Beyer is a 94 on Oaklawn’s sloppy Rebel track where he earned a 94 in his win at 19-1. His prior top was an 83 on a fast Churchill strip. He was a $25,000 purchase at the Keeneland September sale even though his sire’s stud fee is $75.000. Trainer Desormeaux has an unorthodox approach to buying horses, ignoring standard things like pedigree and conformation. He liked this one and so far has been proven right, banking almost $800K. In addition, no one has looked better training in the morning at Churchill.\n\n5) Tapit Trice (Todd Pletcher/Luis Saez) – He figures to be one of the top two betting choices coming off four straight victories, including in the Blue Grass (99). His running style is a come-from-behind, which necessitates a good trip, something that can happen in a 19-horse field as we saw last year.\n\n6) Kingsbarns (Todd Pletcher/Jose Ortiz) – Only one horse has won the Derby after not running at two in the 140 years since Apollo did it in 1882. That lone horse was Justify, who completed an undefeated career by winning the Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes. This colt is also undefeated, winning his third race in the Grade 2 Louisiana Derby where be Beyered a 95.\n\n7) Reincarnate (Tim Yakteen/John Velazquez) – This is the remaining Derby contender in the stable of Bob Baffert who has been barred from Churchill for two years because of his multiple drug overages. He bought this colt for $775,000 and had him on the Derby trail until he was required to “outplace” him after his win in the Sham on January 8. He had a pattern of increasing Beyers until earning a 95 in the Sham. In two starts for Tim Yakteen, however, his Beyers have declined with a 90 in the Rebel, and then an 86 in the Arkansas Derby. Neither of those fields appeared to be all that strong. He returned from the Oaklawn races and has turned in solid works at Santa Anita, including a bullet on April 28.\n\n8) Mage (Gustavo Delgado/Javier Castellano) – He is the second horse in the field who will be attempting to win without racing at two. His three-year old schedule, however, is even more compressed than that of Kingsbarns, having first started on January 28. He ran a good second in the Florida Derby (94), finishing only a length behind the heavily-favored Forte.\n\n9) Skinner (John Shirreffs/Juan Hernandez) – SCRATCHED\n\n10) Practical Move (Tim Yakteen/Ramon Vazquez) – SCRATCHED\n\n11) Disarm (Steve Asmussen/Joel Rosario) – It seemed like every horse sired by Gun Runner won last year, including this guy in his Saratoga maiden win (86). This year, both the sire and this colt do not appear to be so dominating. He has yet to win this year, including defeats to less than stellar opponents in the Louisiana Derby (90) and the Lexington (90). He ran in the Lexington three weeks ago because he did not yet have sufficient qualifying points to crack the field.\n\n12) Jace’s Road (Brad Cox/Florent Geroux) – He has the look of a horse that was entered so his owners could say they had a Derby horse. He ran his best figure of 90 at the end of last year in an ungraded stake at the Fairgrounds. This year has been nothing to get excited about, with an 85 in the Louisiana Derby and a 76 in the Southwest.\n\n13) Sun Thunder (Ken McPeek/Brian Hernandez) – Trainer McPeek is always someone to be concerned about when he has horses in stakes that are longshots. This guy has only one career win, with his Beyers topping out at 89 (twice).\n\n14) Angel of Empire (Brad Cox/Flavien Prat) – His Arkansas Derby win (94) was the most visually impressive of any major prep races in this country. While his final Beyer was comparatively low, it follows a string of steadily increasing figures and he definitely looks like a horse with room for further improvement.\n\n15) Forte – (Todd Pletcher/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – SCRATCHED\n\n16) Raise Cain (Ben Colebrook/Gerrardo Corrales) – He won Aqueduct’s Grade 3 Gotham at odds of 24-1 where he earned his top Beyer of 90. From there he went to the Blue Grass, finishing fifth (89), almost seven lengths in arrears.\n\n17) Derma Sotogake (Hidetaka Otonashi/Christophe Lemaire) – “No horse from Japan has ever won the Derby, but until the 2021 Breeders’ Cup no horse from there ever won a Cup race. That year they won two, and continued their success when a grandson of Sunday Silence took the UAE Derby. The winner of that race has never been successful in Louisville on the First Saturday in May (or, September for that matter).” That is an edited version of what I wrote last year about that entrant from Japan. (Do you remember Crown Pride?) I discounted his chances because my calculation of his Beyer winning in Dubai worked out to a 92. This year’s comparison, however, earned a 97 which puts him in contention with the other top contestants. (I subtract 12 from the Timeform Rating to arrive at a Beyer equivalent.) He has now won four of his last five, including two at 1 1/8 and the UAE race at 1 3/16, which should allay concerns about his sire’s breeding (Mind Your Biscuits by Posse).\n\n18) Rocket Can (Bill Mott/Junior Alvarado) – This colt by Into Mischief has been sizzling in the morning breezes at Churchill and is adding blinkers for the race. He lost by 4 ½ to Forte in the Fountain of Youth (91), but regressed in the Arkansas Derby as the favorite, running fourth (86) behind Angel of Empire, King Russell and Reincarnate.\n\n19) Lord Miles (Saffie Joseph/Paco Lopez) – SCRATCHED\n\n20) Continuar (Yoshito Yahagi/Ryusei Sakai) – SCRATCHED\n\n21) Cyclone Mischief (Dale Romans/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – He has two career wins, with his Beyer top of 91 from finishing third in the Florida Derby.\n\n22) Mandarin Hero – (Terunobu Fujita/K. Kimura) – He has the best Beyer on dirt (100) of anyone in the field, finishing a close second in the Santa Anita Derby in what is traditionally the top Kentucky Derby prep race. He won his first four races in Japan, and is a neck away from being undefeated in six career starts.\n\n23) King Russell – (Ronald Moquett/Rafael Bejarano) – He broke his maiden in his fifth career start and then went to the Arkansas Derby, finishing second (87) at odds of 59-1.\n\nTHE WEATHER\n\nThe forecast is for a sunny warm day with little or no rain. The track was listed as fast in the early morning.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nI start this process by eliminating horses I do not think can win. By post-position order, that eliminates Hit Show, Confidence Game, Kingsbarns, Reincarnate, Mage, Disarm, Jace’s Road, Sun Thunder, Raise Cain, Rocket Can, Cyclone Mischief and King Russell. Great! We only have six left.\n\nWhile I think any of those six could win, I am truly excited about two. My top pick back in the day when there were 23 possibilities and an “also-eligible” list of three, was Mandarin Hero. If you follow racing, you know that horses from Japan are winning everywhere — and I do not mean on the East Coast and West Coast of this country. They have indeed won top races here, including in the Breeders’ Cup. But they also win in Europe, the Middle East and Australia. In Dubai’s World Cup this year they took the top four spots. Mandarin Hero has the only triple-digit Beyer on dirt. He earned his in the Santa Anita Derby, losing by a nose to Practical Move. It proved his form in Japan could translate here.\n\nBut I changed my top selection after listening to Andy Beyer in the “Writers’ Room” of The Thoroughbred Daily News. He explained that he has not had any success in computing Beyers for foreign races. He does not simply subtract 12 from the Timeform Rating as I do. But he was clear that the performance of Derma Sotogake in the UAE Derby far exceeded any of his competitors in this field, and even compared favorably to that of the older horses who ran in the World Cup the same day. That is good enough for me to pick the horses from Japan as the top two.\n\n© Tom Noonan 2023\n\n2022 BELMONT STAKES\n\nfirst edition\n\nWhen: Saturday, June 11\n\nWhere: Elmont, New York\n\nTV: NBC at about 5:30 with early coverage beginning on FS2 at 12;30, then moving to CNBC. The race is scheduled to go off at 6:44\n\nThe factual information contained herein is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\nThere is a potential superstar on the Saturday card at Belmont Park, but it is in the Metropolitan Mile, third jewel of the Triple Crown notwithstanding. The ninth race features two standout four-year-olds in Flightline and Speaker’s Corner, scheduled to go off at 4:43 on CNBC [sic].\n\nThe Belmont Stakes itself shapes up as an interest race with both the Kentucky Derby winner and two others who ran credible races in Louisville.\n\nIn addition to the features, the New York Racing Association loaded up the card with seven other graded stakes – only one of which is not a Grade I, beginning at 12:33. Their explicit purpose was to make for a good day of racing even when a Triple Crown is not on the line. It has ruined many other weekend cards that lost their own graded stakes, but Saturday’s card is a beauty, although the dirt races have small fields.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nHere is the field in post-position order with trainers and jockeys. The numbers in parentheses are Beyer speed figures where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number in the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) We the People (Rodolphe Brisset/Flavien Prat) – The morning line favorite (2-1) projects as the lone speed in a small field. He had a very impressive score in the Peter Pan (103), leading wire-to-wire to win by 10 ¼ lengths. He had a very disappointing finish against a mediocre field in the Arkansas Derby (73) at odds of 5-2, finishing seventh by 13 lengths.\n\n2) Skippylongstocking (Joseph Saffie, Jr./Manny Franco) – The colt did not embarrass himself in the Wood Memorial (91) with a third-place finish, 3 ¾ lengths behind Mo Donegal (today’s second choice on the morning line) and Preakness winner Early Voting. He did not show improvement in the Preakness, however, finishing fifth, 7 ½ back (94). He only has two wins in ten career starts.\n\n3) Nest (Todd Pletcher/Jose Ortiz) – Trainer Pletcher knows a thing or two about training and thinks that a mile-and-half is what this filly wants. She ran second by two lengths as the favorite in the Kentucky Oaks (91) in her last start. Her penultimate effort in Keeneland’s Ashland was an impressive tour-de-force, winning by 8 ¼, earning her her career-best Beyer at 92. She has won four of six lifetime starts.\n\n4) Rich Strike (Eric Reed/Sonny Leon) – He is getting more respect here than he did at 81-1 in the Kentucky Derby, but is still just the third choice in the morning line at 7-2. I am glad he won at Churchill since I now realize the “S. Leon” in his PP’s is not Sandy Leon, the name of the Red Sox’ former catcher. His two wins both came at Churchill Downs, with the first one being a 17-length score in which he was claimed for $30,000. That’s looking like a nice investment since he just has to finish today’s race to push his career earnings past the $2 million mark.\n\n5) Creative Minister (Ken McPeek/Brian Hernandez, Jr.) – The gray colt by Creative Cause is making his fifth career start (all this year) and demonstrating a pattern of improving Beyers, culminating in a 100 for his third-place finish in the Preakness. His two career W’s came on the slop at Keeneland (83) and then at Churchill on the First Saturday in May (96), albeit in an optional $80K claimer.\n\n6) Mo Donegal (Todd Pletcher/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – Breaking from the one-hole in the Kentucky Derby’s 20-stall starting gate is considered a major disadvantage because it forces your horse to head for the rail and to get squeezed back. Somehow, this guy ended up going 10-wide while the winner, Rich Strike, broke from the 20-hole and came up the rail weaving in and out of those in front of him. While that is one reason the Derby is often a chaotic event, but it is interesting how often horses that turn out to be good survive the event. This Uncle Mo colt is the only one with a win at Belmont, breaing his maiden there in October (82). He and Nest are the only entrants with wins in two graded stakes, with this guy winning the Remsen (90) and Wood Memorial (96).\n\n7) Golden Glider (Mark Casse/Dylan Davis) – You always have to respect trainer Casse, but the same need not be said about his entrant. In four graded stakes his only top three finish was a second in the Peter Pan, 10 lengths back where he matched his Beyer top of 87.\n\n8) Barber Road (John Ortiz/Joel Rosario) – The $15,000 yearling purchase has only won two of nine starts, but has banked $650,000 thanks to decent finishes in five stakes, including three graded. His Derby finish was not that bad either (94), ending up sixth, only 4 ¾ lengths back.\n\nTHE WEATHER\n\nThe National Weather Service is predicting a “slight chance of showers” after 2:00.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe only entrants I cannot see winning are Skippylongstocking and Golden Glider. I am not inclined to wager on either We the People or Nest because the odds will be too short. In the case of Nest she has not demonstrated she can run a Beyer needed to win this.\n\nI will wait for the final odds before wagering, but if I have to pick a winner, I will go with Mo Donegal, and play around with combinations of him, Rich Strike, Creative Minister and Barber Road.\n\nROYAL ASCOT\n\nAn event I have become addicted to is the five-day meeting at Royal Ascot. I witnessed the Queen, whose perhaps only public responsibility is convening Parliament, being advised that the first post was coming up so she could leave on time. She enters the track in a horse-drawn carriage accompanied by members of the royal family and assorted hangers-on, although her attendance this year is uncertain (at least to me). It is top quality and entertaining racing. Be sure to stay for the end-of-the-card sing-along. Make your prawn and cucumbers sandwiches and chill your champagne. I think it is NBC that broadcasts it, and it runs June 14 through June 18.\n\n© Tom Noonan 2022\n\n2022 PREAKNESS\n\nfinal edition\n\nWhen: Saturday, May 21\n\nWhere: Baltimore, Maryland\n\nTV: NBC at 4:00. Earlier races are on TVG. The race is scheduled to go off at 7:01.\n\nThe factual information contained herein is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\n*****\n\nIt’s wonderful to come out of a Kentucky Derby with no whiff of controversy, nor Bob Baffert – there may be a connection there – but one of racing’s truly great “feel good” stories. A horse that was claimed out of his first race and was trained by a low-key guy who went through a devastating barn fire, and was ridden by someone whose first name I did not know until after he won, took the biggest prize in American racing at odds of 80-1.\n\nThe connections of Rich Strike have decided to skip the Preakness, saying it was not in the best interests of their colt. Despite the blathering coming out of the racing commentariat about the need to change the spacing of the Triple Crown races, it is refreshing to hear the owners and trainer actually saying they are thinking of the horse. That’s in contrast to a certain high-profile figure who does not even know what medications are being given to his horses.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nHere is the field in post-position order with trainers and jockeys. The numbers in parentheses are Beyer speed figures where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number in the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) Simplifcation (Antonio Sano/John Velazquez) – The hot Derby pace played to his closing style, allowing him to get up for fourth, 3 ½ back of the winner. At 35-1, he was one of the best values in the Derby field, excepting a certain entrant who went off at 80-1. He is one of the field’s more accomplished runners, hitting the board in all four of his graded stakes, including the Derby (96), Florida Derby (92), the Fountain of youth (96) and Holy Bull (91).\n\n2) Creative Minister (Ken McPeek/Brian Hernandez, Jr.) – He is the only winner from the First Saturday in May at Churchill Downs to be entered in the Preakness. He did not get a garland of roses for his effort since his event was an $80,000 optional claimer for non-winners of a race other than his maiden. He does show some ability, with an increasing Beyer pattern (92, 83, 76).\n\n3) Fenwick (Kevin McKathan/Florent Geroux) – If you think a colt who took five starts to break his maiden (88), and then came back to finish last in the Blue Grass Stakes, 36 lengths back (44) is worth a wager, you will get a square price.\n\n4) Secret Oath (Wayne Lukas/Luis Saez) – She figures to be the most overbet entrant in the field. First, she is a filly taking on the boys. Second, there is her trainer, 86-year old Lukas, who has become something of horseracing’s elderly sage. There is no question that she is very talented. She won the Kentucky Oaks (94), topping what was widely considered the toughest field in that race’s history. She faced colts once before, finishing third, 3 ½ lengths back in the Arkansas Derby (87) as the 3-2 favorite. The winner of the race, Cyberknife, finished 18th in the Derby, 42 lengths back. The filly was entered in the field because it projected as the weakest of the major Derby preps. In fairness, the second horse ran decently at Louisville, finishing 6th, less than 5 lengths back. And the 7th place finisher at Oaklawn came back to win the Peter Pan Stakes impressively.\n\n5) Early Voting (Chad Brown/Jose Ortiz) – Trainer Brown kept him out of the Derby, fearing that the wealth of early speed would compromise his chances. So we know where he will be going coming out of the gate. He won the first two with that style (87, 76) and just got caught in the Wood Memorial (96) by Mo Donegal.\n\n6) Happy Jack (Doug O’Neill/Tyler Gaffalione) – In the Blue Ribbon Derby Analysis, we observed that in his three starts in graded stakes he had finished 50 lengths in arrears to the winners. Following his 14th place finish in the Derby (75), we can now make that 69 lengths in four graded stakes.\n\n7) Armagnac (Tim Yakteen/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – If you think Happy Jack is overmatched, this guy finished behind him in the Santa Anita Derby at odds of 72-1 (83). He came out of that event and wired a $100,000 optional claimer where he went to the post at 5-2 (93) — which may be all you need to know about the quality of that field. He is another temporary refugee from the Bob Baffert barn trained by Yakteen.\n\n8) Epicenter (Steve Asmussen/Joel Rosario) – He looked like a certain winner down the stretch in Louisville until a horse named Rich Strike, ridden by a jockey named Sonny Leon, nailed him. When your sire is Not This Time, it may have been an eerie foreboding of what transpired. He is the most accomplished entrant with four wins and two close seconds in his last six starts (100, 102, 98, 88, 87, 80). Four of those were in graded stakes, including wins in the two Derby preps at the Fair Grounds.\n\n9) Skippylongstocking (Saffie Joseph/Junior Alvarado) – He was finally able to crack 90 on the Beyer scale in his ninth career start, earning a 91 with a third-place finish in the Wood Memorial.\n\nTHE WEATHER\n\nHOT!!!\n\nANALYSIS\n\nWhen an 80-1 shot who was not even in the field early in the morning the day before wins America’s most prestigious race, one should be reluctant to categorize horses as having no shot. We’ll save that for the less intrepid.\n\nThat said, I cannot imagine Fenwick, Happy Jack or Skippylongstocking winning.\n\nTwo that would be major longshots, but not in the realm of, say, a Rich Strike, are Creative Minister and Armagnac.\n\nOf the remaining four, I think the most likely winner is Epicenter. But we are looking for value, and I do not think he represents that at a morning line of 6-5. Nor do Secret Oath ((9-2) or Early Voting (7-2). I think Simplification will go off at higher odds than the morning line of 6-1 and is worth taking a shot on.\n\n© Tom Noonan 2022\n\nKENTUCKY DERBY 2022\n\nFirst Edition\n\nWHEN: Saturday, May 7\n\nWHERE: Louisville, Kentucky\n\nTV: NBC starting at 2:30; race off at 6:57\n\nAs much as many of us would like to be rid of Bob Baffert and his psychodrama, he remains a big factor in this year’s Kentucky Derby. As a result of his suspension, he transferred two horses who could be major factors in this year’s race to Tim Yakteen, the trainer (for now) of Taiba and Messier.\n\nThis looks like one of the most competitive fields in some years with a number of lightly-raced and improving horses all capable of springing an upset.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nThe factual information following is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\nHere is the field in post-position order with trainers and jockeys. The numbers in parentheses are Beyer speed figures where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number within the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) Mo Donegal (Todd Pletcher/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – The Wood Memorial winner (96) has a pattern of increasing Beyers over his career (96, 90, 90, 82, 72). His closing style may not be what the Derby winner has displayed in recent years, and he will have to work through a crowded field as he breaks from the one hole. He finished 4 ½ lengths behind White Abarrio in the Holy Bull.\n\n2) Happy Jack (Doug O’Neill/Rafael Bejarano) – After breaking his maiden in his first start (75), he proceeded to lose his next three starts by a combined 50 lengths (83, 82, 61).\n\n3) Epicenter (Steve Asmussen/Joel Rosario) – The well-regarded son of Not This Time was installed as the second choice on Churchill’s morning line. He has won four of his last five starts, including wins in the Louisiana Derby (102) and the Risen Star (98) after breaking his maiden at Churchill (80). He has a pattern of increasing Beyers and figures to be near the front early.\n\n4) Summer Is Tomorrow (Bhupat Seemar/M. Barzalona) – He finished second in Crown Pride’s UAE Derby. He has no Beyer numbers, but I subtract “12” from the Timeform Ratings to yield Beyer equivalents of 87 in each of his last two starts.\n\n5) Smile Happy (Ken McPeek/Corey Lanerie) – He won both starts at two, winning at Keeneland (82) and then Churchill’s Grade II Kentucky Jockey Club (90). This year he has run second in two graded stakes losing to Epicenter (94) and Zandon (94).\n\n6) Messier (Tim Yakteen/John Velazquez) – He was a star in the barn of former trainer Bob Baffert, winning Santa Anita’s Robert B. Lewis by 15 lengths in February, earning a 103 Beyer that no entrant has surpassed. He was upset in the Santa Anita Derby by the rising star in former trainer Baffert’s stable, Taiba, where he ran a 99. He projects as part of the early pace.\n\n7) Crown Pride (Koichi Shintani/C. Lemaire) – No horse from Japan has ever won the Derby, but until the last Breeders’ Cup no horse from there ever won a Cup race. Last year they won two, and continued their success when this grandson of Sunday Silence took the UAE Derby. The winner of that race has never been successful in Louisville on the First Saturday in May (or, September for that matter). By all accounts, no one has looked sharper training at Churchill than this colt who worked a blistering 46 2/5 on April 22. The downside is that the Beyer equivalent of his Dubai win is only a 92 by my calculation.\n\n8) Charge It (Todd Pletcher/Luis Saez) – Ever since Justify broke the long-standing history of horses needing a race at two to win the Derby, lightly-raced animals have become a trend. This guy is one of four who made their first start at three, and one of seven (!) with four or fewer career starts. He only has one win (93), but ran a credible second in the Florida Derby (93) in just his third career start.\n\n9) Tiz the Bomb (Ken McPeek/Brian Hernandez, Jr.) – He is looking for his first win in a race originally carded for a dirt track. (His lone dirt win came in a race taken off the turf at Ellis Park in July (68)). Against dirt horses he ran two sevenths (65, 41).\n\n10) Zandon (Chad Brown/Flavien Prat) – His impressive win in the Blue Grass (98) vaulted him to prominence as the morning line favorite. He has that impressive pattern of increasing Beyers (98, 93, 90, 80), has strong works, and figures to be running late.\n\n11) Pioneer of Medina (Todd Pletcher/Joe Bravo) – He has that increasing Beyer pattern that is always a positive sign. Yet he only has two wins from six starts, the most recent of which was in a $50K optional claimer (80). He has finished on the board in his two graded stakes starts, a fourth in the Risen Star (93) and third in the Louisiana Derby (96).\n\n12) Taiba (Tim Yakteen/Mike Smith) – This is one extremely talented colt. There are not many who begin their racing career with two triple digit Beyers, ,meaning he now has one more than anyone else in the field, and as many as the rest of the field combined. But – and this is a really big but – those have been his only races. He first ran on March 5, winning by 7 ½ lengths (103) and then beating what was believed to be a very tough, albeit short, field in the Santa Anita Derby (102). No horse won the Derby during the 20th century who did not race at two. That historical reality was shattered when Justify won not only the Derby but the Triple Crown in 2018. In an article appearing in the Thoroughbred Daily News, Chelsea Hackbarth disclosed that the colt was placed on the vet list after the first race with the reason “unsound.” When trainer Yakteen was asked whether he was aware of the reason for this, he relied,”No.” This would mean that he is either grossly negligent and not concerned about the horse’s welfare, or he is lying. As a former employee of Bob Baffert, either possibility could be the case.\n\n13) Simplification (Antonio Sano/Jose Ortiz) – He is one of the more experienced entrants with seven career starts, including a 3 ½ length win in the Fountain of Youth (96). He then finished third, 2 ¼ back, as the favorite in the Florida Derby (92).\n\n14) Barber Road (John Ortiz/Rey Gutierrez) – His two wins came in low-level races facing claiming horses (75, 71). He then embarked on what – on paper – looks like an impressive resume, running second or third in five consecutive stakes, including a second in the grade I Arkansas Derby, earning $650,000(!) His Beyers, however – 88, 83, 86, 78, 84 – say more about the caliber of his opponents than on his chances of winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\n15) White Abarrio – (Saffie Joseph/Tyler Gaffalione) – He has four career wins, the same as Epicenter and one less than Tiz the Bomb. He was a comfortable winner by 4 ½ lengths in the Holy Bull (97) and then came from off-the-pace to score in the Florida Derby (96). His jockey may well be the most underrated top rider. In a jocks room with the likes of the Ortiz brothers, Luis Saez, Joel Rosario and Flavien Prat, he was nonetheless the top rider with 19 wins at the Keeneland spring meeting.\n\n16) Cyberknife (Brad Cox/Florent Geroux) – The Arkansas Derby winner exits what is generally regarded as the weakest of the preps even though Kentucky Oaks winner Secret Oath ran third in the event. His ran his Beyer top at 92. He closed the race by running the last thre furlogs in a glacial 39 seconds. He has two other career wins (87, 80).\n\n17) Classic Causeway (Brian Lynch/Julian Leparoux) – He was a late entrant to the field following his disappointing last-place finish, 21 lengths back, in the Florida Derby (64) after taking the early lead. His trainer’s less-than-compelling rationale for entering was that there was no reason not to. It looks like the owners wanted to. Nonetheless, he did win two graded stakes at Tampa Bay Downs, although neither of those Beyers (86, 88) matched his career best of 90 from his first career start in early September.\n\n18) Tawny Port (Brad Cox/Ricardo Santana, Jr.) – He needed qualifying points by winning Keeneland’s Lexington three weeks ago (89). In his lone start facing quality dirt horses, he finished fifth in the Risen Star (86), 7 ¾ lengths behind the likes of Epicenter and Zandon.\n\n19) Zozos (Brad Cox/Manny Franco) – Yet another member of the lightly-raced crew that did not race at two. Nonetheless, he has had an impressive start to his career, breaking his maiden (70), winning an optional $100K claimer by 10 lengths (92) and then running second to Epicenter in the Louisiana Derby (98). His running style indicates he will be gunned early to get near the front from the 19-hole.\n\n21) Rich Strike (Eric Reed/S. Leon) – Only made the field on Friday morning with the scratch of Wayne Lukas’ Ethereal Road. He has won at Churchill, but in a $30,000 maiden claimer (65). That is also his only win, and has been running on Turfway’s synthetic surface. His last dirt start was in a $99K stake at the Fair Grounds in which he finished fifth, 14 lengths in arrears (64).\n\nTHE WEATHER\n\nThe forecast is for a cloudy day with little or no rain. While the track was listed as sloppy in the early morning, my guess is that it will be fast for the Derby itself.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nI start this process by eliminating horses I do not think can win. By post-position order, that eliminates Happy Jack, Summer Is Tomorrow, Pioneer of Medina, Simplification, Barber Road, Cyberknife, Classic Causeway, Tawny Port, Zozos and Rich Strike. Great! We only have 10 left.\n\nI think Mo Donegal is compromised by his running style breaking from the 1 hole. Messier and Charge It are speed horses that I cannot see sticking around, particularly because of the other front runners in the field. It is hard to toss Tiz the Bomb because of the way he has been working on the Churchill strip in the morning, but he has a dismal record racing on dirt.\n\nI think there are too many questions surrounding Crown Pride and Taiba to warrant a bet.\n\nThat leaves Epicenter, Smile Happy, Zandon and White Abarrio. Smile Happy needs to pick up a couple of lengths on Epicenter and Zandon, and his price should warrant taking a risk.\n\n© Tom Noonan 2022\n\n2021 BELMONT STAKES\n\nfirst edition\n\nWhen: Saturday, June 5\n\nWhere: Elmont, New York\n\nTV: NBC at about 4:30 with early coverage beginning on NBC Sports Network at 2:30. The race is scheduled to go off at 6:49\n\nThe factual information contained herein is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\nI hate to be a downer on this, but drugs in horse racing has become an issue. You may have heard that the winner of the Kentucky Derby tested positive and is likely to be disqualified for illegal drugs for only the second time in the race’s history. Two of the trainers in this field have had recent positives. One is actually referred to on the backstretch as “Drug” instead of his given name of “Doug.” They trained the second and third Derby betting choices, which set up the prospect of a horrifying trifecta that could have been racing’s death knell. (Neither of their horses tested positive in the Derby; I am speaking only of the inevitable public outcry.)\n\nIf you want more on drugging, I have written about the Medina Spirit positive at tenoonan.com, but this is an interesting race. It may actually be one of the more fascinating Belmont’s in recent history, particularly since a Triple Crown is not on the line.\n\nIn addition to the feature, the New York Racing Association loaded up the card with eight other graded stakes, including seven Grade I’s, beginning at 12:47. Their explicit purpose was to make for a good day of racing even when a Triple Crown is not on the line. It has ruined many other weekend cards that lost their own graded stakes, but Saturday’s card is a beauty, although the dirt races have small fields.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nHere is the field in post-position order with trainers and jockeys. The numbers in parentheses are Beyer speed figures where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number in the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) Bourbonic (Todd Pletcher/Kendrick Carmouche) – This guy’s claim to fame is closing from way back to take the Grade II Wood Memorial at 72-1 (89). He also closed in the Derby but finished 13th, 16 lengths back (80). While a deep close may seem appealing in a 12-furlong race, tactical speed tends to be a more favorable approach in the Belmont.\n\n2) Essential Quality (Brad Cox/Luis Saez) – I did not care for this colt at 3-1 odds in the Derby, and the morning line of 2-1 here is no less unappealing. He finished fourth at Churchill, only one length back, breaking his unbeaten record. He has a pattern of increasing Beyers, culminating with a 100 in Louisville. He has also had two excellent works since then, and appears primed for a big effort.\n\n3) Rombauer (Mike McCarthy/John Velazquez) – His impressive win in the Preakness produced the field’s highest Beyer at 102, an improvement of 14 points over his prior top. In an interesting twist, his winning jockey at Pimlico is moving to another entrant, Hot Rod Charlie.\n\n4) Hot Rod Charlie (Doug O’Neill/Flavien Prat) – The Derby’s third-place finisher (100) won what appears to be the strongest Derby prep, the Louisiana Derby (99). He also, along with Essential Quality, has a pattern of increasing Beyers in each of his races.\n\n5) France Go de Ina (Hideyuki Mori/Ricardo Santana, Jr.) – He parlayed a sixth-place finish, by 10 ½ lengths in the UAE Derby into a seventh-place finish, by 17 ½ lengths, in the Preakness (77). It is difficult to come up with a rationale for backing this guy.\n\n6) Known Agenda (Todd Pletcher/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – He showed sufficient ability in the Florida Derby (94) to warrant serious attention in Kentucky, but went off at 10-1 and split the field, finishing ninth, 10 3/4 back (87). If his morning-line odds of 6-1 hold, there is no way I would bet him.\n\n7) Rock Your World (John Sadler/Joel Rosario) – He was my Derby pick but got in a world of trouble at the start, taking him out of his front-running game (69). That should not be an issue in a much smaller field.\n\n8) Overtook (Todd Pletcher/Manny Franco) – He is a million-dollar yearling purchase who has won just one race with career earnings of $131K. He has two placings in graded stakes, but his Beyer top is only 84.\n\nTHE WEATHER\n\nThe National Weather Service is predicting a “sunny” day with a high of 83°.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nI think this shapes up as a great horse race with, in my opinion, five potential winners. I am tossing Bourbonic, France Go de Ina and Overtook. If the 6-1 morning line on Known Agenda holds, I will definitely pass.\n\nI will wait for the final odds before wagering, but if I have to pick a winner, I will go with Hot Rod Charlie.\n\nROYAL ASCOT\n\nAn event I have become addicted to is the five-day meeting at Royal Ascot. I witnessed the Queen, whose perhaps only public responsibility is convening Parliament, being advised that the first post was coming up so she could leave on time. She enters the track in a horse-drawn carriage accompanied by members of the royal family and assorted hangers-on. It is a top quality and entertaining racing. Be sure to stay for the end-of-the-card sing-along. Make your prawn and cucumbers sandwiches and chill your champagne. I think it is NBC that broadcasts it, and it begins in the morning from June 15.\n\n© Tom Noonan 2021\n\n2021 PREAKNESS\n\nfinal edition\n\nWhen: Saturday, May 15\n\nWhere: Baltimore, Maryland\n\nTV: NBCSN at about 4:30 and then NBC. Earlier races are on TVG. The race is scheduled to go off at 6:47\n\nThe factual information contained herein is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\n*****\n\nIt seems that controversy and the First Saturday in May go together like – let’s say – bourbon over shaved ice with a sprig of mint. The 2018 Kentucky Derby did not seem controversial at first. It was then revealed that Justify, trained by Bob Baffert, tested positive for a drug following the Santa Anita Derby win that he needed just to get into the field for the Louisville event. In 2019, Maximum Security, the first horse to cross the finish line was DQ’d for interference, the only such occurrence in the race’s history. Oh, lest I forget, the disqualified horse was trained by Jason Servis who has since been indicted for multiple counts of drug violations under federal laws.\n\nThere were two more noteworthy drug positives on the First Saturday in May in 2020, but they occurred not at Churchill Downs which had its signature event postponed until September, but at Oaklawn Park. Charlatan, trained by Bob Baffert, tested positive following his win in the Arkansas Derby. Gamine, who went on to become the Eclipse-winning three-year-old filly and is also trained by Bob Baffert, tested positive after her winning race.\n\nYou may have heard that this year, Medina Spirit, trained by Bob Baffert, was first across the line but then tested positive for betamethasone. I wrote about Baffert’s duplicitous response in this post. And despite Baffert’s increasingly prolific record of drug positives, there are many who dismiss this one as inconsequential. A common thread is that it is a therapeutic medication that is not performance-enhancing.\n\nThis defense, however, ignores two important factors. The first is that a drug with therapeutic benefits is not permissible if it exceeds established threshold standards that are in a state’s regulatory framework. The other is that a medication that doesn’t “enhance performance” can still be a serious concern if it masks pain and causes a horse to exert itself when it should not be racing.\n\nI went back and looked at the 2019 Blue Ribbon and that year’s controversy, and found this:\n\n“It should be obvious at this point that there is nothing that occurs in America that cannot be the source of bitter controversy, no matter how ill-informed the disputants are. If you can have a public health crisis such as a measles outbreak and still have anti-vaxers, I guess that says it all.”\n\nHow quaint. There must have been a measles flare-up that year that brought out the same foolishness we are now witnessing for a life-threatening epidemic.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nHere is the field in post-position order with trainers and jockeys. The numbers in parentheses are Beyer speed figures where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number in the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) Ram (D. Wayne Lukas/Ricardo Santana, Jr.) – When one pays $375,000 for a yearling, one is anticipating running at Churchill Downs on the First Saturday in May, and this guy did, winning impressively. It wasn’t in the Derby, however, but in an allowance for “non-winners of 1-other-than” (81). He broke his maiden in his preceding start for a $50K tag (74), meaning the owners were prepared to take a substantial bath on their investment. Those are his two wins from nine starts.\n\n2) Keepmeinmind (Robertino Diodoro/David Cohen) – This Laoban colt showed a lot of promise as a two-year-old. He ran third, two lengths behind Essential Quality in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile (92). He then went to Churchill, breaking his maiden in the Grade II Kentucky Jockey Club (80). He hasn’t lived up to that promise this year. After finishing in front of only two horses in the Rebel (81), he was dusted in the Blue Grass, finishing 16 lengths behind the Juvenile champ (73). He ran seventh in the Derby (90) at 49-1.\n\n3) Medina Spirit (Bob Baffert/John Velazquez) – You may have heard he won the Kentucky Derby (102) going wire-to-wire. The odds-on favorite in the Santa Anita Derby was upset by Rock Your World, the 5-1 third choice, finishing second by 4 ¼ lengths (94). He was less than a length away from being undefeated in his first three starts (94, 99, 76), including the W in the Grade III Robert B. Lewis before running into a potential freak in stablemate Life is Good. He was second to that now-injured horse by eight lengths (95), but still was rated as the top entrant in what has been the leading Derby prep in recent years.\n\n4) Crowded Trade (Chad Brown/Javier Castellano) – This colt’s 95 Beyer in the Gotham has been surpassed only by Medina Spirit and Midnight Bourbon. Nonetheless, he disappointed in the Wood at 3-1 (87) where he was defeated by the 72-1 Bourbonic.\n\n5) Midnight Bourbon (Steve Asmussen/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – He won the Grade III Lecomte (93) at the Fair Grounds, ran third, 1 ¾ back of Mandaloun in the Risen Star (96), before battling Hot Rod Charlie down the stretch and finishing second (96), two lengths back in the Louisiana Derby. Those two ran second and third in Louisville.\n\n6) Rombauer (Michael McCarthy/Flavien Prat) – He has yet to win on the dirt, but did notch his Beyer top of 88 running third, 5 ¾ lengths back in the Blue Grass behind Essential Quality. He has a win on the turf and one on a synthetic in three combined starts. He does, however, have three exceptionally good works on Santa Anita’s dirt track.\n\n7) France Go de Ina (Hideyuki Mori/Joel Rosario) – It’s hard to get a read on this guy. He won a maiden and an allowance in Japan last year before running sixth, 10 ½ lengths back in the UAE Derby. His Timeform numbers do not suggest a horse who will be competitive here.\n\n8) Unbridled Honor (Todd Pletcher/Luis Saez) – He hit his Beyer top running on a sloppy Keeneland track, although he still finished second, 2 ¾ back of the winner King Fury. In three prior starts on a fast dirt track, his top was a 78.\n\n9) Risk Taking (Chad Brown/Jose Ortiz) – He looked like he was moving in the right direction, breaking his maiden (82) and then winning the Withers (89). But he was an immense disappointment in the Wood, finishing seventh (78), 6 ¾ lengths in arrears to the longshot Bourbonic as the favorite.\n\n10) Concert Tour (Bob Baffert/Mike Smith) – Baffert’s two entrants each have three wins, which is more than anyone else in the field. This colt has a profile similar to Medina Spirit’s. He went to the Arkansas Derby undefeated, two of his three wins coming in graded stakes (94, 94). But he disappointed as the odds-on favorite, finishing third (87), 2 ½ back of Super Stock.\n\nTHE WEATHER\n\nAs of Friday, the National Weather Service is predicting a sunny day with a high of 78°.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe Preakness is often won by a horse exiting the Derby even if it is not the Derby winner. Nonetheless, some hot prospects, including two fillies, have won the Second Jewel. I am not seeing such a hot prospect here, but I am not enamored of Medina Spirit.\n\nI do not think the following have much of a shot: Ram, Keepmeinmind, France Go de Ina, and Unbridled Honor.\n\nRisk Trading has yet to run a Beyer exceeding 89, but has been working in company with Crowded Trade, who I think has a shot.\n\nBaffert’s other entrant, Concert Tour, has a profile very similar to Medina Spirit’s pre-Derby record and is the only horse besides that one with three career wins.\n\nBut I am going to stick with the Louisiana Derby as the key prep and pick Midnight Bourbon on top. For a high-value and potential bomber, I will go with Rombauer.\n\n© Tom Noonan 2021\n\nKENTUCKY DERBY 2021\n\nFirst Edition\n\nWHEN: Saturday, May 1\n\nWHERE: Louisville, Kentucky\n\nTV: NBC at about 4:30 with early coverage on NBCSN at 1:00; race off at 6:57\n\nHorse racing is a sport that lends itself to controversy, whether it is the vocal fans on different sides of an issue, or disagreements between those fans and people on the outside opposed in principle to the very notion of racing. This year, however, presents the possibility that the winning owners of two of America’s most prestigious races will be ones accused of wrong-doing beyond a scale I have ever seen.\n\nSheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum is one of the most influential figures in racing on the international scene. He is the leader of Dubai and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates. He also owns the likely heavy favorite in the Kentucky Derby, Essential Quality.\n\nAccording to a report in the Lexington Herald-Leader: “the family division of the British High Court found that Sheikh Mohammed had arranged the kidnapping of two of his adult daughters and forcibly returned them to Dubai after they attempted to flee on different occasions. It also found the sheikh ‘conducted a sustained campaign of fear, intimidation and harassment’ of his now ex-wife, Princess Haya….”\n\nOne of the daughters, Sheikha Latifia, has released a video in which she claimed being held as a prisoner and feared for her life, according to a report in The New York Times. Human rights experts with the United Nations have made repeated requests to the Dubai government for proof that the Princess is “alive and well,” but have been stonewalled.\n\nThe UK High Court decision has led human rights lawyers in the United States to ask Kentucky’s Horse Racing Commission to ban Sheikh Mohamed and Essential Quality from the Derby. The attorneys had sought similar relief in 2019, but were denied because reports of the Sheikh’s human rights abuses were based only on media reports unlike the current situation where there is a judicial determination. According to NBC’s Oaks coverage, the KHRC denied relief this time because the Sheik’s behavior did not violate any of the state’s regulations. So I guess kidnapping – and perhaps murder – do not run afoul of the licensing requirement of “good character.”\n\nThe Kentucky Oaks has its own problem with a potential winning owner facing significant legal issues. According to Ray Paulick in The Paulick Report, Amer Abdulaziz of Phoenix Thorughbred III, owner of Oaks’ entrant Crazy Beautiful, has been “identified under sworn testimony in federal court as a conspirator to launder some of the estimated $4 billion scammed from people around the globe in a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme known as OneCoin.” Regulators around the world, including France, the UK, UAE and Australia have taken action to either prevent him from racing or to freeze his assets.\n\nAs Paulick said in his opinion piece, the Abdulaziz and Phoenix allegations are “not a good look for an industry that routinely seems to value money over ethics.” And let’s not forget that the first horse to cross the finish line in the 2019 Derby was Maximum Security, trained by Jason Servis who subsequently was indicted by the United States government for his involvement over several years in illegal drugging. (The indictment does not allege that the Derby was affected by the illicit doping.) Servis’ behavior, as well as that of fellow trainer Jorge Navarro, was widely suspected on the backstretch and by bettors, but it took the federal government to bring those charges.\n\nThat is the same Maximum Security whose owners shipped their horse to run in the Saudi Cup just after evidence that the ruler of Saudi Arabia had ordered the murder, dismemberment and disappearance of an American journalist.\n\nThere are many in racing, including a disturbing number in prominent positions, who prefer to ignore reality and go about life in their own isolated bubble. But racing continues to face crisis after crisis, many of our own making, but the failure to address significant issues of human rights abuses, as well as potentially massive fraud, will do little to restore the public confidence that is essential for our sport’s survival.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nThe factual information following is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\nHere is the field in post-position order with trainers and jockeys. The numbers in parentheses are Beyer speed figures where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number within the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) Known Agenda (Todd Pletcher/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – Over the years, the rail was the least desirable of the 20 stalls in the starting gate, often being referred to as “The Dreaded One Hole.” It’s the result of a large field of horses suddenly racing to get closer to the rail, thereby squeezing the horse in TDOH who had to use early speed to avoid literally being forced into the rail. Churchill implemented a new starting gate last year that no longer requires an auxiliary gate that was several feet from the main gate. That enables the new gate to be placed further away from the rail, so TDOH may no longer be TDOH. Going into the final round of the prep races, Todd Pletcher was not viewed as having any Derby contenders. When those races were over, he had four. This colt looks like the best of the bunch, and he will be ridden by perhaps the best jockey in America. He broke his maiden in his second start (79). He had a disappointing effort in the Remsen (80), took some time off before having another disappointing race in the Sam F. Davis (77). But blinkers were added and he returned with an 11-length win in an allowance (82). In the Florida Derby he pulled away to win by 2 ¾ lengths (94). He clearly has the look of a horse getting better at the right time.\n\n2) Like the King (Wesley Ward/Drayden Van Dyke) – Many people do not consider the Grade III Jeff Ruby Stakes (sic) a major Derby prep even though Churchill considers it a 100-point race and Barbaro won the big one coming from here. He looks more like a Grade III horse than a classic winner. The Jeff Ruby is his only stakes score (86). That was on a synthetic surface. His lone dirt start resulted in a 38 Beyer.\n\n3) Brooklyn Strong (Daniel Velazquez/U Rispoli) – Churchill Downs uses a point system to determine entries in the 20-stall starting gate. Points are awarded based on the quality of the race, with the major preps being worth 100 points for the winner, 40 for second and so on. In most years, it typically requires 50 points to get in. This year, 42 horses earned points, with this guy ranking 42nd. He only is in because of all the defections in front of him, including two more on the Sunday of Derby week. Having said that, he came to the Wood Memorial with three wins in four starts, breaking his maiden in a $40K maiden claiming (53), and two starts later winning a stake for NY-breds (77). He won the Grade II Remsen on a sloppy Aqueduct track (94), his last start before the Wood. He ran mid-pack all the way, finishing fifth, 4 ¾ lengths back (82) of the 72-1 Bourbonic.\n\n4) Keepmeinmind (Robertino Diodoro/David Cohen) – This Laoban colt showed a lot of promise as a two-year-old. He ran third, two lengths behind Essential Quality in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile (92). He then went to Churchill, breaking his maiden in the Grade II Kentucky Jockey Club (80). He hasn’t live up to that promise this year. After finishing in front of only two horses in the Rebel (81), he was dusted in the Blue Grass, finishing 16 lengths behind the Juvenile champ (73).\n\n5) Sainthood (Todd Pletcher/Corey Lanerie) – Has raced three times this year, breaking his maiden on February 13 (76) and then running second in the Jeff Ruby Stakes by a length (84).\n\n6) O Besos (Greg Foley/Marcelino Pedroza) – He is a horse exiting the Louisiana Derby who has demonstrated a pattern of increasing Beyers in every start. After his first start on a sloppy Churchill Downs strip (60), he broke his maiden (77), had an allowance score (83) before running fourth (88), 7 ½ back of Mandaloun in the Risen Star. He turned the tables on the Louisiana Derby fav, finishing third (96) at 29-1, almost 10 lengths in front of him.\n\n7) Mandaloun (Brad Cox/Florent Geroux) – His Louisiana Derby may be the biggest disappointment of any of the horses entered in the major preps. He had that pattern of increasing Beyers, has already won at Churchill, and after adding blinkers won the Grade II Risen Star (98). He sported three impressive works and went into the Louisiana Derby as the 3-2 favorite. He proceeded to run a dismal sixth, finishing 11 ¾ lengths in arrears (82). Since that race he has been burning up the Churchill strip in morning breezes.\n\n8) Medina Spirit (Bob Baffert/John Velazquez) – The odds-on favorite in the Santa Anita Derby was upset by Rock Your World, the 5-1 third choice, finishing second by 4 ¼ lengths (94). Trainer Baffert had three of the most highly rated Derby prospects in early March, but this is the only one going to Louisville. He was less than a length away from being undefeated in his first three starts (94, 99, 76), including the W in the Grade III Robert B. Lewis before running into a potential freak in stablemate Life is Good. He was second to that now-injured horse by eight lengths (95), but still was rated as the top entrant in what has been the leading Derby prep in recent years.\n\n9) Hot Rod Charlie (Doug O’Neill/Flavien Prat) – I like a pattern of increasing Beyers, no matter the caliber of the race, and this guy has shown that, with only a blip in his penultimate effort. In his last, he won the Louisiana Derby with a 99, a fig exceeded only once by another entrant. After breaking his maiden, he had the lead in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile (at odds of 94-1) before being edged by Essential Quality, losing by ¾ length (94). He was 5-2 in his next start, finishing third in the Robert B. Lewis by a neck (91) to one of Baffert’s stars, Medina Spirit. Taking the lead at the Fair Grounds as the second choice, he drew off to win by two.\n\n10) Midnight Bourbon (Steve Asmussen/Mike Smith) – Money Mike Smith takes the mount from Joe Talamo who had steered the colt to three consecutive good performances in graded stakes. He won the Grade III Lecomte (93) at the Fair Grounds, ran third, 1 ¾ back of Mandaloun in the Risen Star (96), before battling Hot Rod Charlie down the stretch and finishing second (96), two lengths back in the Louisiana Derby.\n\n11) Dynamic One (Todd Pletcher/Jose Ortiz) – He is a $725,000 Keeneland September purchase who took four starts to break his maiden (79) at 1 1/8 miles, a month before the Wood Memorial. Sent off at 16-1, he raced wide throughout the race before taking the lead only to get nailed at the wire by Bourbonic, earning a new Beyer top of 89.\n\n12) Helium (Mark Casse/Julien Leparoux) – If not for the inestimable trainer, I would suspect this is a case of the owners simply wanting to have a horse in the Derby as a marketing opportunity. While Bob Baffert proved with Justify that a lightly-raced horse can win the Derby, this entrant takes that notion a considerable step forward – or perhaps backwards would be a more apt description. He raced twice as a two-year-old, comfortably winning two seven furlong races (75, 76) on Woodbine’s synthetic surface. He was not seen in a starting gate for more than four months, returning in the Tampa Bay Derby on March 6. He won that event by ¾ length (84) over Hidden Stash, a horse projected to be one of the longest shots on the board. That means he will go to the Derby post off a single 1 1/16 mile race in over six months. It doesn’t strike me as a recipe for success.\n\n13) Hidden Stash (Vicki Oliver/Rafael Bejarano) – When a horse goes through the September Keeneland yearling sale and does not even bring the sire’s stud fee, it is not a good sign, indicating his physical conformation was not that good or there were suspect X-rays. This colt has nonetheless placed in two graded stakes, the Tampa Bay Derby (83) and Sam F. Davis (83) before running a distant fourth in Essential Quality’s Blue Grass, 10 lengths back (82). It is nearly impossible to come up with a single reason suggesting this guy could win.\n\n14) Essential Quality (Brad Cox/Luis Saez) – Godolphin is one the major players in international racing, if not the major player. They have long wanted to win this race, at one pointing predicting a victory within five years. That was many years ago and they have yet to have any notable success. But here they have the likely favorite, a winner of all five career starts including four graded stakes. Most recently he won the blue Grass Stakes as the odds-on favorite, but needing to dig in down the stretch to prevail by a neck over Highly Motivated. He has a consistent Beyer pattern, running 97, 96 and a 95 in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile.\n\n15) Rock Your World (John Sadler/Joel Rosario) – Only one horse has won the Derby without running at age two in the past 137 years. That horse was Justify who won in 2018 on his way to the Triple Crown. This guy almost ran at two, making his first start on January 1, winning at six furlongs (82) on Santa Anita’s turf. His next start was also on the weeds, taking an ungraded stake at a mile (82). A horse sired by Candy Ride (Arg) by an Empire Maker mare was probably going to handle dirt, and he won easily, besting Bob Baffert’s Medina Spirit by 4 ¼ lengths, earning the field’s top career Beyer with a 100.\n\n16) King Fury (Kenny McPeek/Brian Hernandez, Jr.) – SCRATCHED It’s unfortunate the Derby will not be run at 1 1/16 miles because this guy would have a significant experience edge. All six of his starts have been at that distance and he has won three of them, including two at Churchill Downs. He qualified for the Derby field with his win on April 10 in Keeneland’s sloppy Grade III Lexington Stakes (96) at odds of 18-1. I understand when you pay $950,000 for a Curlin yearling, you are expecting a Derby start, not a career at Parx. But his last race will be his only one in five months, and it is not as though his connections picked out a longer prep against some of the top three-year-olds.\n\n17) Highly Motivated (Chad Brown/Javier Castellano) – His owners, Klaravich Stables , wanted to sell him at the Keeneland September sale, but when the last bid did not even cover the money they had invested, they decided to race him. At two, he broke his maiden in his second career start (79) before winning an ungraded stake at Keeneland (96). He returned in Aquduct’s Grade III Gotham, finishing third (92) as the odds-on favorite, 1 ¾ lengths behind the winner. Moving on to the Blue Grass Stakes, he gave likely Derby fav Essential Quality all he could handle, leading throughout until being nicked at the wire by a neck (97).\n\n18) Super Stock (Steve Asmussen/Ricardo Santana, Jr.) – Each year the Arkansas Derby is one of the major preps for that race on the First Saturday in May. This year the $1 million Grade I event attracted a less-than-robust field of six. That may have been because it was a week closer to that other race, or it may have been because it was viewed as a mere training work for the 3-10 favorite Concert Tour from Bob Baffert’s barn. This colt’s only win came in August in a five and one-half furlong restricted stake at Lone Star (71). While it is not surprising that he was sent as the fourth choice in that small field at 12-1, it was surprising how easily he won. He hit a new Beyer top of 92. (Concert Tour, finishing three lengths back, has been declared from the Derby, as have three of the other finishers.)\n\n19) Soup and Sandwich (Mark Casse/Tyler Gaffalione) – Having raced at two used to be the sine qua non for a Derby winner until Justify came along. This colt is one of three in the field who first started at three, but he is really pushing the envelope, waiting until January 28 to begin his career. He broke his maiden in a Florida state-bred race (89) before beating two others in an allowance (84). He led early in the Florida Derby at 12-1 before being passed by Known Agenda (90). This is a talented horse, but I have serious reservations about his lack of seasoning.\n\n20) Bourbonic (Todd Pletcher/Kendrick Carmouche) – This colt paid a whopping $146.50 for winning the Wood Memorial, which is not too shabby for a horse trained by someone on his way to the Hall of Fame and ridden by the jock who was a leading rider in the winter meet. He had been two-for-two at the Big A, breaking his maiden in a $50K claimer in December (69) and coming back to score by a neck in an optional claimer (71). After finishing four lengths back in another optional claimer at Parx (76), owner and breeder Calumet Farm figured the next logical step was a Grade II with a purse of three-quarters of a million dollars. As DRF’s commentary said, he was in last, “loping along at his own pace” before making up ground while running “three to four wide,” and nailing stable mate Dynamic One at the wire, earning a new Beyer top of 89.\n\nTHE WEATHER\n\nThe track is fast and the turf firm on Friday. There is no rain in the forecast and the prediction is for sunny and mid-70’s.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe first time I wagered on a horse race was the 1986 Kentucky Derby. I purchased The Daily Racing Form as a souvenir, but had no idea what all those numbers and lines for each horse meant. I did some reading and latched onto two factors. No horse had ever won the Derby with a Dosage Index higher than a certain number. Remarkably that really narrowed down the list of “contenders.” And one of my contenders was not racing on drugs. So I picked Ferdinand, the last time a horse won from The Dreaded One Hole. As I continued to read and follow the sport, I came up with several other factors that a winner needed. Those disappeared one by one (starting with the Dosage Index), and most recently eliminated the need for a race at two.\n\nWhen the last two weekends of major preps were complete, I thought this was the most nondescript Derby in recent memory. The likely favorite is Essential Quality, an undefeated colt who won both the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile and the Blue Grass Stakes, although in the latter he won as the odds-on favorite by a neck in a fiercely contested stretch run. Here’s a summary of the achievements of the winners of the four other major Derby preps prior to that victory: five wins in sixteen dirt starts; the only stakes win on the dirt was a restricted event at Lone Star in August; top Beyer an 83. Yikes! But then I went back further and concluded that the most important preps were the Florida and Louisiana derbies.\n\nSo I started this process by eliminating horses I did not think could win based on Beyer numbers that were not competitive: Like the King, Brooklyn Strong, Keepmeinmind, Sainthood, Dynamic One, Helium, Hidden Stash, and Bourbonic. Great! We only have 11 left.\n\nI then eliminated Essential Quality from consideration as a win bet — but not necessarily from the top of trifectas or superfectas . I do not think he is worth a wager at odds that could be as low as 2-1. He simply does not stand out from the rest of the field to warrant that gamble.\n\nEliminating half the field is the easy part. Deciding among the remaining nine entrants is not so simple. This is, for the most part, a lightly-raced group, any of which could rise up and run a breakout race. The ones I think most likely to do that are Known Agenda, O Besos, Hot Rod Charlie, Midnight Bourbon, and Rock Your World.\n\nI think Rock Your World’s Santa Anita Derby was the most impressive of any of the preps, so I am going to go with him. I will also wait to see the final odds and spread win bets among the longest shots of the final grouping.\n\n© Tom Noonan 2021\n\n2019 BELMONT STAKES\n\nfirst edition\n\nWhen: Saturday, June 8\n\nWhere: Elmont, New York\n\nTV: NBC at about 4:30 with early coverage beginning on NBC Sports Network at 2:30. The race is scheduled to go off at 6:37\n\nThe factual information contained herein is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\nEven casual observers are aware that this year’s Belmont Stakes lacks any real pizazz. The Derby winner is not here, nor is the horse who crossed the finish line first. The second-place finisher is also taking a pass. Only three entrants have won graded stakes, and in the case of one, that came back on February 2.\n\nThe New York Racing Association loaded up the card with eight other graded stakes, including seven Grade I’s. Their explicit purpose was to make for a good day of racing even when a Triple Crown is not on the line. It has ruined many other weekend cards that lost their own graded stakes, but Saturday’s card is a beauty.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nHere is the field in post-position order with trainers and jockeys. The numbers in parentheses are Beyer speed figures where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number in the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) Joevia (Gregory Sacco/Jose Lezcano) – After running 7th in the Wood Memorial (78), 13 lengths behind Tacitus at odds of 52-1, he was the heavy favorite in wiring the four-horse field at Monmouth’s ungraded Long Branch Stake (89). Can’t see him stepping up big time to win this.\n\n2) Everfast (Dale Romans/Luis Saez) – After breaking his maiden in his first start at Ellis Park, he brings a 10-race losing streak into this race. He is presumably here because of his surprise second in the Preakness (96). That Beyer surpassed his prior top of 83 in February. His Preakness performance earned him a morning line of 12-1 which I think is way too low.\n\n3) Master Fencer (Koichi Tsunoda) – There are 111 horses entered at Belmont for Saturday. This guy is one of only two that will not be using Lasix. He finished seventh in the Derby (96), only four lengths behind Maximum Security and half-length in front of War of Will, who of course experienced significant interference but when on to win the Preakness. His two career wins came in Japan in a maiden and an allowance.\n\n4) Tax (Danny Gargan/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – After being claimed for $50K at Keeneland, he had Lasix added to his repertoire and ran well at Aqueduct. He ran third in the Remsen (93), won the Withers (96), and was second in the Wood (95). The betting public did not give him any love (or wagers), sending him off at 36-1 in the Derby where he finished 15 lengths back in 15th place. Switching to one of the nation’s top jockeys is not going to hurt him.\n\n5) Bourbon War (Mark Hennig/Mike Smith) – His claim to fame is a fast-closing second in the Fountain of Youth where he finished a half-length back in second (93). That made him 3-1 in the Florida Derby where he finished 7 ½ back (90), and 6-1 in the Preakness where he was 9 ½ in arrears (85). He loses jockey Irad Ortiz to Tax, but picks up a guy known to win an occasional big race.\n\n6) Spinoff (Todd Pletcher/Javier Castellano) – His pattern of increasing Beyers culminating in a second-place in the Louisiana Derby (95) came to a crashing halt with a 76 in the Derby where he finished 18th, 18 lengths back.\n\n7) Sir Winston (Mark Casse/Joel Rosario) – Seven contestants ran in the Derby and Preakness, but this colt is the only entrant with a three-digit Beyer in his career, running a 100 in Belmont Park’s Belmont prep, the Peter Pan – and he was only second. His prior tops were an 88 in the Withers, five lengths behind Tax, and 86 in the Tampa Bay Derby, finishing four back of Tacitus.\n\n8) Intrepid Heart (Todd Pletcher/John Velazquez) – He appears to be taking Justify’s route to the Belmont Stakes – not racing at two, limited racing at three. (Although. to be fair, Justify’s pre-Belmont route could better be described as strenuous.) This guy won his first two races as the fav (92, 85), started as the Peter Pan chalk, but finished third in a five-horse field, six back (95).\n\n9) War of Will (Mark Casse/Tyler Gaffalione) – Only Everfast has more career starts, but the Preakness winner has won four of his ten career starts. Three of those four wins have come on a fast dirt track. He is the only entrant to race in each of the Triple Crown races, and his Derby (95) is much better than his ultimate finishing place because of the interference by DQ’d first finisher Maximum Security. And he won the Preakness with a 99.\n\n10) Tacitus (Bill Mott/Jose Ortiz) – He is the somewhat surprising morning-line favorite. I assume it is because he finished ahead of War of Will in the Derby, although that competitor had his much-documented trouble with Maximum Security. This colt won the Tampa Bay Derby (93) and Wood Memorial (97) before being placed third at Churchill because of the disqualification.\n\nTHE WEATHER\n\nThe National Weather Service is predicting a “sunny” day with a high of 79°.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe two most accomplished entrants are likely to be the betting favorites. I will take War of Will over Tacitus. For a price play, I will take Master Fencer, the horse from Japan who was right in the mix at the Derby.\n\n© Tom Noonan 2019\n\n2019 PREAKNESS\n\nfirst edition\n\nWhen: Saturday, May 18\n\nWhere: Baltimore, Maryland\n\nTV: NBC at about 4:30 with early coverage beginning on NBC Sports Network at 3:00. The race is scheduled to go off at 6:48\n\nThe factual information contained herein is from The Daily Racing Form (drf.com). The analysis, including even that which turns out to be accurate, is mine unless otherwise noted.\n\n*****\n\n“The Preakness is always somewhat of an anticlimax. After months of build-up for the Derby, the Preakness is all about whether we will have a horse going for the Triple Crown – at the Belmont Stakes. Instead of the countless charts listing all the Derby possibilities, we are down to humdrum coverage focused only on whether [fill in the name] can get the second leg.”\n\nThat’s how I always begin the Preakness Blue Ribbon. Well here’s some news for you: neither the Derby winner nor the horse who finished first will be making an appearance at Old Hilltop this Saturday. Country House came down with an infection and Maximum Security was declared from the race early and may have his own medical issues. We will, however, have a 13-horse field, larger than most runnings of the race – last year only seven showed up to challenge Justify.\n\nThree of the entrants have a combined record of two wins from 24 starts, and the non-maiden in that group has now lost nine in a row. But there is also a gelding with six straights wins and a total of seven racing in Maryland (albeit all at Laurel Park). The race has certainly lost some of its lustre, but it shapes up to be a competitive group making for a great handicapping challenge. And if you think this race lacks appeal, wait until you see who shows up for the Belmont in three weeks.\n\nSo about that Derby…. It should be obvious at this point that there is nothing that occurs in America that cannot be the source of bitter controversy, no matter how ill-informed the disputants are. If you can have a public health crisis such as a measles outbreak and still have anti-vaxers, I guess that says it all.\n\nThe Derby was not the first time I lost money as a result of a disqualification, and if I continue to bet, it will not be the last. While I was initially skeptical, I think all the evidence is that Maximum Security interfered in a significant way. Those who agree rely on the Kentucky racing rule that compels this result. Those who disagree think that a different rule should have been in place. Of course there is litigation by the aggrieved owners in federal court. As much as I love to do a deep dive into detailed documents, my years of practicing law have taught me one thing – do not read a 126-page complaint that instinct tells me is frivolous.\n\nI do not think controversy is a bad thing for sport. The good news is that the interference by Maximum Security did not result in horses and jockeys going down with possibly catastrophic consequences. I wrote about the Santa Anita fatalities in the Derby Blue Ribbon. The last thing racing needs if it hopes to survive is an accident in the only race most Americans will watch this year (especially with no possibility of a Triple Crown) that results in additional fatalities.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nHere is the field in post-position order with trainers and jockeys. The numbers in parentheses are Beyer speed figures where the higher the figure the better. When there is more than one number in the parenthesis, the most recent comes first.\n\n1) War of Will (Mark Casse/Tyler Gaffalione) – Even though he crossed the line in 8th place (95), he became the best known entrant in the Derby because he was the colt with whom first-place finisher Maximum Security so egregiously interfered. Despite being forced out and having to check, he finished less than three lengths behind Country House and only 1 ¼ behind likely Preakness fav Improbable. And that was after having to break from the Derby’s most infelicitous starting post on the rail. He owns two of the entire field’s three graded stakes wins this year (90, 94). While he flopped badly as the favorite in the Louisiana Derby (78), he stands an excellent chance here.\n\n2) Bourbon War (Mark Hennig/Irad Ortiz, Jr.) – He was a fast-closing second, by one-half length, in Code of Honor’s Fountain of Youth (93). His closing style fell victim to Maximum Security’s slow-walking of the Florida Derby (90). He has been off since then, but is adding blinkers and has had several solid works.\n\n3) Warrior’s Charge (Brad Cox/Javier Castellano) – He is coming off two impressive wins at Oaklawn Park, breaking his maiden by six (89) and equaling that margin in a first-level allowance (97). He has America’s latest top-notch young trainer in Cox and has attracted the services of Castellano. While he has yet to face the best of his generation, he cannot be disregarded for a place in the exotic wagers.\n\n4) Improbable (Bob Baffert/Mike Smith) – He is the most accomplished member of the field, being undefeated at two, including a Grade I (96), and solid finishes in the Kentucky Derby (96), Arkansas Derby (99) and Rebel Stakes (95). But he crossed the line fifth in Kentucky as the favorite, and had none of the excuses of War of Will whom he barely beat by a length.\n\n5) Owendale (Brad Cox/Florent Geroux) – The best way of making money in this race is to bet fans they cannot name the horse with the top last-race Beyer. That would, of course, be this guy whose 98 in Keeneland’s Lexington tops the field, and he is the other graded stakes winner this year besides War of Will. In his only other graded stake start, he finished eighth, 10 lengths in arrears to the aforementioned War of Will.\n\n6) Market King (Wayne Lukas/Jon Court) – The Coach says “you can’t win it, if you’re not in it,” and he often pairs up with Calumet Farm to race horses that seem to be over-matched in a particular race. This colt certainly fits that profile. He has won once, and most recently ran"
