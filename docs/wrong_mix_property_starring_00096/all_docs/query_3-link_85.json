        "text": "Michael Mann’s 1986 crime thriller MANHUNTER remains one of the best efforts of his career. At the time he made the film, he was also producing the hit TV series Miami Vice and much of that show’s MTV style editing and contemporary aesthetic shows up. Based on the novel Red Dragon by Thomas Harris, Manhunter marked the first onscreen appearance of Hannibal Lecter, the character made most famous by Sir Anthony Hopkins in Jonathan Demme’s classic The Silence of The Lambs.\n\n“It’s just you and me now, sport. And I’m going to find you, God damn it.”"
