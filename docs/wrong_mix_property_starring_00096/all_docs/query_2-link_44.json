        "text": "CASPER, Wyo. (Wyoming News Now) - The Jefferson Awards honor those making a difference in communities across the state.\n\nNominee Tom Noonan has been a volunteer at Central Wyoming Hospice and Transitions for the past five years.\n\n“I’ve used the expression that I’m addicted to this place,” He says.\n\nTom specializes in working with veteran patients. A few years ago, he heard about the CWHT Honor Salute program. As a Vietnam War veteran himself, Tom felt compelled to join the team.\n\nHe says, “I find that these veterans don’t talk to a lot of people. I had to experience doing the Honor Salutes, that after it concluded I asked ‘Well what did you do?’ And they talk, they open up. I think a lot of it has to do with being a fellow vet, we speak the language.”\n\nThe Honor Salute program recognizes veteran patients for their service. During the ceremony, they are awarded with a Challenge Coin from the US senate, a plaque, and a star cut from a retired flag.\n\nOne of the most important parts of Tom’s work is providing companionship and support to those he serves and their families.\n\nHe says, “To be with them at the end of their life, to make sure they do not die alone, and they die with dignity… I’ve done that with two veterans, actually held their hand when they died, escorted them out the door to the hearse and gave them a final salute. It’s very, very rewarding.”\n\nHaving the honor to spend time with someone during their last moments is not something Tom takes for granted.\n\n“[It] makes me very grateful, humbling... The bad things [that] happen in your life, to go beyond that and look at the good side of life, and be part of that good side of life to other people,” He says."
