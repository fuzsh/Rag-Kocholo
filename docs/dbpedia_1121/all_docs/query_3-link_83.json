        "text": "Did you know Calvin Harris is not the DJ's real name? Did you know Bruno Mars isn't really called Bruno Mars? Check out 53 stars who have changed their real names and the stories behind their decisions.\n\n1. What is Camila Cabello's real name?\n\nSo half the planet seems to struggle with the pronunciation of the former 5H singers name (it's Cah-meela Cab-ay-o, FYI)... but that could all have been avoided if she just went by her birth name of Karla - although we reckon there'd still be problems with Estrabao... Picture: Getty\n\n2. What is Halsey's real name?\n\nHalsey was born Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, but is best known by her stage name of Halsey, derived from an anagram of 'Ashley' and a reference to Halsey Street Station on the New York Subway too. Picture: Instagram\n\n3. What is Blac Chyna's real name?\n\nBlac Chyna's real name is Angela Renée White and she gave herself the moniker after meeting a client in the strip club where she worked who was nicknamed Black China. She asked if she could use the name, stylised it by dropping the 'k' and the rest is history! Picture: Instagram\n\n4. What Is Jacob Sartorius' Real Name?\n\nHaving made his name using Vine and Musical.ly, Jacob Sartorius has more recently been linked to a budding romance with Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown, but it turns out his actual name is Rolf Jacob Sartorius! Picture: Instagram\n\n5. What is Zayn Malik's real name?\n\nFormer One D heartthrob Zayn Malik changed the spelling of his real first name when he became an X Factor star - but the reasons for the change still haven't been made clear. Picture: Getty\n\n6. What is Anne-Marie's real name?\n\n'Ciao Adios' and 'Alarm' singer Anne-Marie only dropped her surname for her stage name. Picture: Getty\n\n7. What is Sia's real name?\n\nNot only has Sia hidden her face from her stage persona, she also dropped her surname of Furler. Picture: Getty\n\n8. What is Rag'N'Bone Man's real name?\n\nDouble BRIT Award winner Rag'N'Bone Man is actually called Rory Graham. He originally went by \"Rag 'N' Bonez\" when he was 15 as part of a drum and bass crew, which apparently was inspired by the 1970s sitcom Steptoe And Son. Picture: Getty\n\n9. What is Dua Lipa's real name?\n\nBelieve it or not, Dua Lipa is actually the 'Future Nostalgia' singer's real name. Picture: Getty\n\n10. What is Calvin Harris' real name?\n\nCalvin Harris' real name is Adam Richard Wiles. He was born on 7th January 1984 in Dumfries, Scotland. He explained the change of name came from wanting to sound \"racially ambiguous\" as his early music was more soulful. Picture: PA\n\n11. What is Drake's real name?\n\nDrake's real name is Aubrey Drake Graham. He was born on 24th October 1986 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Picture: PA\n\n12. What is Bruno Mars' real name?\n\nBruno Mars' real name is Peter Gene Hernandez. He was born on 8th October 1985 in Honolulu, Hawaii. At age two, he was nicknamed Bruno by his father because of his resemblance to the wrestler Bruno Sammartino. Picture: PA\n\n13. What is Martin Garrix's real name?\n\nYou didn't think Garrix was his real surname did you? The Dutch DJ has a much more traditional full name - Martijn Garritsen. Picture: PA\n\n14. What is Tinie Tempah's real name?\n\nTinie Tempah's real name is Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu. He was born on 7th November 1988 in Plumstead, London. It was down to a thesaurus that Tinie came up with his stage name after he was looking for an alternative to \"angry\". Tinie Irate just doesn't have the same ring really does it? Picture: PA\n\n15. What is Avicii's real name?\n\nAvicii's real name is Tim Bergling. He was born on 8th September 1989 in Stockholm, Sweden. After deciding on the DJ name Avici a friend told him it was a level of Buddhist Hell. He was forced to add the extra 'i' as someone already had the name taken on MySpace. Picture: PA\n\n16. What is Katy Perry's real name?\n\nKaty Perry's real name is Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson. She was born on 25th October 1984 in Santa Barbara, California.

What is Rihanna's real name?\n\nRihanna's real name is Robyn Fenty. She was born on 26th February 1988 in Saint Michael Parish, Barbados. Picture: PA\n\n18. What is Pitbull's real name?\n\nPitbull's real name is Armando Perez. He was born on 15th January 1981 in Miami, Florida. His name is based on the dog breed because \"they bite to lock. The dog is too stupid to lose.\" Picture: PA\n\n19. What is Jason Derulo's real name?\n\nYou might be used to screaming his name as \"Jason Derulooooo\", but his surname ACTUALLY look a little more French than you're used to. His birth name is Jason Joel Desrouleaux. Picture: PA\n\n20. What is Usher's real name?\n\nUsher Terry Raymond IV was born on 14th October, 1978 in Dallas, Texas. Picture: PA\n\n21.
