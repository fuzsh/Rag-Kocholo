        "text": "Questioner\n\n...I'm actually a video game designer.\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nOh cool.\n\nQuestioner\n\nAnd the one thing that I kept thinking as I was reading The Stormlight Archive was \"Oh my god. I want to play that\" Is there any, kind of, y'know-- Do you see those moving in to some other media besides just books, or video games or...\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nExcellent question. So, other media. I like video games a lot. I remember-- You're going to get a lot of stories tonight, this is what happens, I'm a storyteller-- I was 11 years old, my father shipped me off to visit my uncle for the first time on my own. Got on the airplane and everything, went to Utah from Nebraska. And my dad gave me two hundreds, two one hundred dollar bills, he said \"Pay for your food\" and things like this... *laughter* You're laughing you know what happens. I just let my uncle pay for everything and at the end of it my conscience had gotten to me and I said \"Uncle [Don?] my dad gave me money, I should give this to you to pay for the food\". And he just laughed at it, like \"No you're not going to do that. We're going to the mall right now. We're going to spend that money because if you don't your dad will take it back\" And I went and I bought a Nintendo, original NES, with my two hundred dollars at KB Toys. And I came back with it and my dad was like \"Where did you get that?\"\n\nI love video games and I want to be involved-- Which is why, some of you have watched, I did the novellas for Infinity Blade, which is a video game. Which you can read online but if you havenit played the games they won’t make any sense. I'm just going to warn you right there. I am involved-- We have sold the rights to Mistborn as a video game, but we have entered some development problems, the video game industry is almost as bad as the movie industry when it comes to delays and things like this. You have studios fall through, get divided, all sorts of things. I'm still hoping but the deal was I got to write the story and all the dialogue for the video game. It's going to be-- We are going to do it-- an action RPG, the model I told them I wanted to use was Infamous, which was one of my favorites from lately, in the Mistborn world. If we can get that working then I bet I can get a Stormlight book turned into a video game.\n\nAs movies go, movies are even harder. I was on the phone with movie producers right before I came here. I got a phone call, and we're doing a lot of that, talking with them, we've sold a lot of rights, we've seen a lot of scripts, but nothing's ever been made. So right now we have Legion, Emperor's Soul, Mistborn, and Steelheart all have significant motion but far from actually done. And The Wheel of Time is kind of off-again, on-again, off-again, on-again with adaptations. I think television show is what they are currently working towards.\n\nQuestioner\n\nI want to know what process you follow through building your vocabulary. Also, do you use a thesaurus?\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nWhat process do I use for developing my vocabulary, and do I use a thesaurus. My vocabulary development comes through reading other people's books and seeing the cool words they use and writing them down. And I can often pinpoint who I learned which word from. Like miasma I learned from Anne McCaffrey. Things like this-- Just seeing the words they use and looking them up when I don't know them. That's my favorite way. Do I use a thesaurus? I do use a thesaurus but only to come up with a word I know I should be using. There's two times I use it. One, when I come to a word I know there's a word there but I don't know what it is yet. The other time I use a thesaurus, which is really useful, is when I'm naming something. Like when I was naming the Reckoners, I need a cool word for this team. One that Marvel or DC hasn't used yet *laughter* They used everything. So I may use a thesaurus, but using a thesaurus is dangerous. It's a good tool but it's a dangerous tool for a writer. Because you don't want to use a word because it sounds cool, usually you want to use the right word. That can be difficult to balance.\n\nQuestioner\n\nWe hear a lot in The Final Empire about various titles and such from the Steel Ministry. Can you give us very little as to their actual structure and what they do...\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nYeah I can talk about this.\n\nQuestioner\n\nThey only thing you can't is the ranks.\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nSo the Steel Ministry, in the Mistborn books. The interesting thing I considered when I was writing them was \"What is the purpose of the priesthood when god is there in the palace and everyone knows it? And if you disobey you just get your head cut off.\" So what do you do? I made the Steel Ministry more government, like the post office is run by priests. And a lot of what priests do is witness official business, take your money for doing so and give you a stamp that \"Yes I witnessed this\" and things like this, but they also run all the public works. It's not like they're cleaning the sewers themselves but overseeing the sewers, overseeing engineers, most of the engineers who built the city plans would be obligators.\n\nWhich by the way you named didn’t you? There he is, Nate Hatfield was in my writing group for many years. We were driving to writing group once and I wanted a cool word for a priest, because I was just using priests in the original version of Mistborn. I'm like \"I need a great word\" and he-- How did you even come up with that word?\n\nNate Hatfield\n\nYou really want to know?\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nYeah.\n\nNate Hatfield\n\nThesaurus. *laughter*\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\n...There's Nate. You can congratulate Nate on coming up with obligator. And was it you that came up with the Conventicle, or was that Peter? Conventicle was Peter.\n\nQuestioner\n\nSo when you are doing a kind of in-depth and very long story-- like The Stormlight Archive... Can you-- Do you tackle that, like, in short-- For like an outline?\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nOh good question.\n\nQuestioner\n\nDo you outline the entire thing? Do you outline one at a time, or two at a time?\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\n…So outlining. You picked the hardest one to outline, by far. Normally the outlining process for me is-- it goes like this, I sit down and I write Plot, Setting, Character in a new sheet. I put them in outline level one. And then I put all the things that I have been thinking in my head for a while, that I've been brainstorming with friends or-- Every book that I write I spent a long time planning it out, it's when ideas connect together that you know you have a great book. One idea is not a book, multiple ideas that influence each other in cool ways is a book, to me. So I write all this down and then I start looking for the structure and what are people's plots. The way I outline is I outline goal-based. Say I want to have an interesting relationship dynamic between these two characters, how can I achieve that? What's my goal at the end and what are my steps to get there? That is part of my outline. And I don't like-- And then I do another one. Okay, someone's got to learn to use the magic, what's my end goal, what are my steps to get there, what are cool scenes out of this? Those are all separate in my outline, it's not like in my outline there's \"Chapter one: this, this, this, and this\". It's Goal, with how to achieve. Goal, how to achieve it. Goal, how to achieve it. That's my normal outline process.\n\nNow The Stormlight Archive is a strange beast, because it is plotted as ten books, each focusing around a character. And for that what I did was I sat down and wrote out my outline more in prose form, my vision for the whole series and then I wrote a paragraph about each book. Then what I just told you, I did for the first book, then I wrote the first book. Then I went back and created a much bigger and more detailed outline for the rest of the series. So it's kind of this process. The really weird thing about the Stormlight books is that I actually plot each one like I plot a trilogy. So for instance, Words of Radiance you can find-- people have noticed them-- breakpoints between quote-unquote books, that this volume is actually written as three books with a short story collection as the interludes woven between. That's how I approach those books.\n\nMy publisher has a love/hate relationship with The Stormlight Archive because they feel they could publish them as four volumes and make four times as much money but I won't let them. But they don't want me to write other things because they really want more Stormlight because Stormlight is the one that sells the best out of everything. So they are like \"Write more Stormlight, but can we split it please?\" and I say \"No, you can't split it\" and they're like \"arghhh\" So they release them as these big volumes, as I told them to, even though they know they are each like these three volumes-- And anyway...\n\nThat's kind of the shorter version of it. If you guys are... writers, and you want some help, I have two resources. Ask when you come through the line. I have a podcast, with a bookmark that says where it is. Fifteen minutes of writing advice every week. It's called Writing Excuses. I also lecture at Brigham Young University, and part of my requirement for lecturing for them-- I don't take salary-- is that they have to let me put my lectures online for people to see. So my lectures, for the last few years, of my university course, are posted online.\n\nQuestioner\n\nDo you actually know what's wrong with Stephen Leeds?\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nDo I know what's wrong with Stephen Leeds? I do know what's wrong with Stephen Leeds. Thank you for promoting that one. Legion's another of these novellas I did. It's got a fun story behind it.\n\nSo I was in a writing group with mutual friend Dan Wells, he writes twisted books about people who are messed up, and he was doing a book about schizophrenia. He was deep into a schizophrenic’s mind, Dan does a lot of research hits these things really well and meanwhile I'm over here being me and I’m like “Oh this would make a great magic system” *laughter* I'm like “No, no, no, really if you had a schizophrenic and what if they heard voices and saw hallucinations, but the hallucinations helped them. Like their superpower was seeing hallucinations.\" He's like \"That's weird.\" I'm like \"No, you should write this” and I tried to convince him to write it and I tried to convince him to write and finally he said “Brandon, write the dumb book, it’s not my book it’s yours” So I wrote it, it’s called Legion.\n\nIt is indeed about a guy who is a genius and he can become an expert in any topic but that knowledge manifests as a hallucination that he sees, which can than talk him through things. Like if he studies, say, computer programming, he can't program computers, but a hallucination could walk him through programming a computer...\n\nI'm going to warn you, they only do limited editions of the hardcovers on most of these. So they're expensive. But if you buy that I will send you the ebook for free. The only thing I can do that on are my novellas, that and Emperor's Soul, but it is also online for a couple bucks as an ebook. Or you can buy the very nice edition by Subterranean Press.\n\nQuestioner\n\nSo he gets worse...\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\n*hesitates* Over the course of the series he is getting worse and worse, despite what he says.\n\nQuestioner\n\nCan you talk a little about your editing process? After you get through the first draft-- You go through it, you look at the acknowledgements in a lot of your books, and other books, there's this huge team of people that have been pouring over this thing.\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nYeah, so editing for me. Here's my drafting process. First draft I just write-- I write it straight through. I don't stop, I try not to let myself stop. If there is something major I need to change I just change it in the chapter and keep going forward. And then I can change it back later, like two chapters later if I think \"No that was the wrong thing\". So there will be a new character sometimes in my book that will just pop up for three chapters and everyone acts like they've always been there and then they vanish and no one talks about them not being there anymore. That's just so I can keep momentum and see what works. Draft number 2 I fix all of those things. Draft number 3, polishing draft. Line by line trying to cut 10%, get rid of the passive voice, make descriptions more active, and make sure that I'm finding the right words and things like that. Really Draft 4 is where it turns into true drafting, and by that point I've given it to my editor and my alpha readers which are basically my assistants, my good friends, my wife, people like that. They read it, they come back with comments for me and I've been thinking about the book, working in my writing group with it and I make a goal-based document, where it's like \"Here are the major issues. Here are the medium level issues. Here are the little things I need to fix.\" And I start on page one, read through with this open on the screen next to the book when I'm working on it and I try to like-- It's almost like a bug report for programming, I'm trying to clear things off the list. Major things I have to re-write the whole way through so I can't clear them off until the end. Medium issues are things I can put in two or three times to fix through a couple of chapters where they are wrong and then clear it. Little things are just fix this one little thing and it's easy to clear off the list. I do that, I don't get to everything. I move around things on this list, like I maybe [???] I move it down the list.\n\nThen I send the book out to beta readers, who are gathered by my assistant, he handles this, Peter Ahlstrom. Then they do a thing with us on a Google Doc, where it's chapter by chapter there is a document for each chapter and they all put their comments and interact with each other. It's like having a very large focus group, with like 15 people who are all reading the book at the same time and working on it. Once that is done and I've heard back from my editor on the new draft I will then make another draft. I will do this as many times as necessary to make the book good. Last draft is proofreading and those people are also drawn from fandom, usually, my assistant picks them off forums and things like that and people we've used before. And they are just looking for-- At that point we can't change anything really bigger than a line or two. They are looking for continuity and things like that. But my process is that goal-based \"I want to fix this let's see if I can do a draft where I fix this.\" And I'll do a couple more polishing drafts as I go along.\n\nQuestioner\n\nDo you care if all we read is audiobooks? Do you mind if people are like [???]\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nNo I don't mind. Whatever format you want to read in. I would love for them to-- Whatever you like to read in is the best. People sometimes say to me \"Well do you make money if I do this or this?\" And the true answer is \"Both\" but-- *laughter* The honest answer is I don't mind. Check them out from the library, buy a copy here, borrow it from a friend. If you read my fiction, more people will be talking about it, and more people will be interested in it. And that is going to generate momentum for me. So pick your favorite format and your favorite place to get it, whether it is Cousin Billy or whether it is buying it from UBooks, and read the books. I'm just glad people are reading my fiction.\n\nI mean I spent-- I wrote thirteen books before I sold one guys. That's how much I like doing this. I wrote over a dozen of them when no one was paying me to do it, right? And now that people actually are, it's just like so cool to be able to have things like the cosmere come together and everybody really be in on this thing. If you don't know a lot of my books are connected. There are characters from different books showing up in each other's books and fiddling with things and stuff.\n\nQuestioner\n\nSo with the cosmere, do you come up with stories and see if they fit? Or does the cosmere kind of lend itself to stories already?\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nIt's mostly the first. *audio obscured* When I come up with a story I'll ask, \"Does this fit the cosmere?\" and if not-- Like, for instance, this one, that I read tonight [Perfect State], just doesn't fit the cosmere. I don’t want to be doing far-future science fiction stuff yet in the cosmere, and when I do, virtual reality is not a cosmere thing. So I can't write that as cosmere. Or the Rithmatist which I bounced back and forth. Would have been, could have not been. I just eventually decided it didn't fit the story. When things do fit, I put them in.\n\nQuestioner\n\nIs that a really exciting moment? Or just sort of \"Ohhh that's nice\"\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nYeah, it's just like that. I like all my stories. The Cosmere-- One of my rules for myself is \"The Cosmere is not my entire body of work\" because then I would just be shoehorning things in and I've found sometimes when authors create a multiverse they shoehorn everything in. Stephen King did this, Asimov did this. It doesn't work. I think if it is an intentional thing I'm deliberately doing, then it gains more power, it's cooler than if I were trying to make everything connected.\n\nQuestioner\n\nHemalurgy is mentioned as something that has \"broad implications.\" But that's of Ruin, right? (Or now it is of Harmony.)\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nYes, but don't take the \"of Ruin\" and \"of Preservation\" too strongly, but yes.\n\nQuestioner\n\nBut, I mean, somebody couldn't just walk along with a metal spike on, say, Nalthis, and stab 'em and now they have the power, could they?\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nIf they knew where to stab them, yes, they could.\n\nQuestioner\n\nAnywhere in the cosmere?\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nYes.\n\nQuestioner\n\nYou can stab someone and get their power?\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nHemalurgy has been built in such a way that it rips off pieces of the soul. If you can rip off the right piece of the soul and attach it to somebody else, it will change your Identity, and it can rewrite anything that's attached to your soul. Identity, Connection, it can rewrite Investiture, all of this stuff it could potentially do.\n\nQuestioner\n\nAnd do the things you stab people with—are they always metal or does that depend on the planet?\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nNo, that's metal, that's—\n\nQuestioner\n\n*inaudble*\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nWell yes, you could make it do something like that. That is totally possible. But the metal— Yeah. Anyway.\n\nQuestioner\n\nWith the other Shards you kind of have to be near that Shard to get that—there's no Allomancy.\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nTo get it, yes. To have that part of your soul. But, for instance, Allomancy would work on other planets. The only one that's going to have trouble working on other planets, right now, are the ones on Sel because of the way that the magics are built."
