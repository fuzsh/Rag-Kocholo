The Voice Artists need to crush their performances during the Blind Auditions, Battles, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows to win. With their Coaches as a support system, they need to bring their A-game to every performance to guarantee they stay in the competition.\n\nHow to Watch\n\nWatch the Season 26 premiere of The Voice on Monday, September 23 at 8/7c on NBC and next day on Peacock.\n\nFans love The Voice partly because each season features a unique lineup of talented Artists ready to show they have what it takes to make it to the end.\n\nRELATED: Elevate Your Playlist With These Original Songs by Winners of The Voice\n\nAcross its many seasons, The Voice has had some seriously impressive winners — and Season 25 was no different.\n\nWho won The Voice last season?\n\nThe winner of The Voice Season 25 was Asher HaVon, who was on Coach Reba McEntire's team and helped her get her first win as Coach.\n\nRELATED: Everything to Know About The Voice's Asher HaVon\n\nThe Selma, Alabama-native was raised with gospel music, and got early encouragement from an elementary school teacher (according to The Selma Sun) and his mother (whom he still affectionately calls his “singing sergeant”). He earned wider attention in 2015 as the choir leader who performed for President Barack Obama in Selma to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches.\n\nHaVon earned a Three-Chair Turn (and an almost-immediate Turn from Chance the Rapper) during his Blind Audition with his cover of Adele's \"Set Fire to the Rain.” He cemented his place on the show as a serious contender during the Battles, edging out fellow Team Reba Artist Alyssa Crosby with a tag-team cover of Tina Turner’s “We Don’t Need Another Hero.”\n\nRELATED: “Wow, Wow, Wow”: How “Flawless” Asher HaVon’s “Insane” Range Won His Battle\n\nIn the Knockouts, Asher beat out eventual Dan + Shay steal Tae Lewis with an ambitious cover of Toni Braxton’s “Unbreak My Heart,” and in the Playoffs, he turned in a memorable performance of David Guetta’s “Titanium.\" He’s branched out even further during the Live rounds, performing the Boyz II Men’s 1990s classic “I’ll Make Love to You,” Coldplay’s “Fix You,” and Beyoncé’s “Irreplaceable.”\n\nIn the Finale, he and his Coach, McEntire, performed \"On My Own\" by Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald.\n\nPhoto: Tyler Golden/NBC\n\nFrom angelic country Artists to belting rock stars, the talents that have graced The Voice's stage are nothing short of jaw-dropping. Let's take a look back on all winners of The Voice to see how far the Emmy-winning series has come. Prepare to be awestruck.\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 1?\n\nThe Voice winner who sparked the sensation, Javier Colon, took home the first win back in 2011. The acoustic-soul singer was responsible for receiving the first four-chair turn from Adam Levine, CeeLo Green, Blake Shelton, and Christina Aguilera.\n\nAuditioning with a haunting rendition of Cyndi Lauper's power ballad, \"Time After Time,\" it was no surprise when the Coaches argued over who'd claim Colon for their team. Colon continued to deliver showstoppers until the very end, where he claimed the top spot and earned Levine the first Coach victory.\n\nFollowing his time on The Voice, Colon continued recording music and touring around the country. He's released two albums since his Team Adam tenure, 2011's Come Through For You and his 2016 album, Gravity. In 2023, Colon performed with The Hartford Symphony for their “Celebrate America” concert in Simsbury, Connecticut.\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 2?\n\nJermaine Paul had the honor of winning The Voice's sophomore season. He had joined the competition with experience: He'd previously recorded backing vocals for then-future Voice Coach Alicia Keys.\n\nThe R&B artist auditioned with a soulful rendition of Avril Lavigne's \"Complicated\" and immediately impressed the Coaches, ultimately choosing Team Blake to take him to the end. He ended up giving Shelton his first Coach win of many to come.\n\nRELATED: What Happened to The Voice Winner Jermaine Paul?\n\nAfter seizing the crown in Season 2, Shelton and Paul recorded a song together, the 2012 single “Soul Man”. The same year, Paul graced fans with the dance-worthy singles “I Believe In This Life” and \"Butterfly Kisses.\"\n\nHe has yet to release a full album but is the proud creator of several infectious pop hits, like 2015's \"Working Sista\" and his 2019 release \"Water.\" Paul continues to perform live, regularly posting his sets on his Instagram, like his 2022 tour with the Summertime Choir in Italy.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 3?\n\nThe first female winner of The Voice, Cassadee Pope, surprised no one with her Season 3 win. Joining Team Blake, the pop-punk artist entered the competition as the lead singer of the band Hey Monday. Pope was a bit of a sleeper agent during the first half of the season, but once she embraced the country genre, her game quickly elevated.\n\nHer live performance of Miranda Lambert’s “Over You” — a country ballad co-written by Shelton about the premature death of his brother — struck a chord with audiences and catapulted her to the top of the competition. Pope ultimately claimed the trophy, and she is widely regarded as one of the most successful singers to compete in the series.\n\nFollowing her Voice victory, Pope released the song “Wasting All These Tears” from her debut album Frame by Frame. In recent years, Pope has shifted back into her pop-punk origins, releasing the edgy-pop hit \"RSVP\" in 2022 and dropping the grunge-tacular bop \"People That I Love Leave\" in 2023.\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 4?\n\nDanielle Bradbery's charm and stunning vocals quickly solidified her frontrunner status in Season 4, later winning the competition as a member of Team Blake. Season 4 of The Voice featured an insane lineup of powerhouse country performers, which makes sense after seeing two wins from Shelton in a row.\n\nBradbery rocked the radio waves after the Live Playoffs with her cover of \"Maybe It Was Memphis\" by Pam Tillis. The country songstress made history at that point as the youngest Voice winner, claiming the title at just 16. She also scored Shelton a third consecutive win, a celebrated achievement for the country king.\n\nAfter crushing each of her Voice performances, Bradbery hit the ground running in the music industry, dropping a self-titled album in 2013 and working with the likes of Diplo, Thomas Rhett, and Nick Jonas, according to her website. In 2017, Bradbery dropped her hit singles \"Sway\" and \"Worth It\" for her second studio album of three to date, I Don't Believe We've Met. A decade after her victory, Bradbery is still recording: Her 2023 single \"A Special Place\" received adoration from veteran Coach Kelly Clarkson, who performed the track on her beloved Kellyoke segment on The Kelly Clarkson Show.\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 5?\n\nSeason 5 Voice winner Tessanne Chin was a sensation — especially after she managed to break Team Blake's three-season run.\n\nFrom her Blind Audition with Pink's \"Try\" (which scored Chin a four-chair turn) to the Live Shows, Chin impressed the Coaches with her versatile vocal range and perfect pitch, and was described as \"physically incapable of ever missing a note.\"\n\nJoining Team Adam, Chin took home the Season 5 title after her final performance of Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing.\" Houston had passed away just a year earlier, and Chin's incredible vocals gave new life to the timeless track.\n\nMonths following her Voice win, Chin released her first studio album, Count On My Love, with powerful reggaeton singles. She went on to release several stand-alone singles, including 2015's R&B-fueled \"Fire.\" In 2023, Chin released a collaboration with Natural High for the psychedelic single \"Surreal.\"\n\nPhoto: Tyler Golden/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 6?\n\nSeason 6 winner Josh Kaufman initially entered the competition as a part of Team Adam after his Blind Audition of George Michael's \"One More Try.\" After losing in the second Battle Rounds of that season, then-Coach Usher gave Kaufman one more try as a part of his team.\n\nThe decision was well-rewarded, with Kaufman delivering an unforgettable cover of Sam Smith's smash hit \"Stay With Me\" later that season. His Live Finale rendition of Adele's \"Set Fire to the Rain\" showcased his preternatural ability to cover the gamut of musical styles, and contributed to his crowning victory.\n\nAfter his Voice win, Kaufman released his self-titled debut album. In 2015, Kaufman took on the titular role in Pippin for the 2013 Broadway revival, where he closed out the run. Kaufman continues to perform and record new music, releasing an album, Ndoxo, Vol 1. a celebration of 80s and 90s music, in 2019.\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 7?\n\nThe Voice winner from lucky Season 7 was country crooner Craig Wayne Boyd, and he brought the Nashville heat. As the eternal nursery of country music, it's never surprising to see some of the amazing talents from Nashville, and Boyd was no exception. Serving mesmerizing vocals in the Blind Audition that felt straight out of the Grand Ole Opry, Boyd joined Team Blake.\n\nShelton, it seemed, just had to have another country-singing frontrunner in his rodeo, and Boyd didn't disappoint. Tackling smash hits by the likes of the Eagles, George Strait, and Johnny Cash, the crowds fell in love with Boyd's country charm and soaring vocals, sending him all the way to the end, where he won despite duking it out against three Team Adam Artists.\n\nAfter scoring his win on The Voice, Boyd released a grand-slam single, \"My Baby’s Got a Smile on her Face,” which debuted at No. 1 on the country charts that December, according to the Anchorage Daily News. In 2017, he released his studio album, Top Shelf, a continuation of his love for the country genre. In 2023, he dropped the romantic single \"One Last Line\" in honor of his wife for Valentine's Day.\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 8?\n\nSeason 8 winner Sawyer Fredericks was responsible for giving Coach Pharrell his first and only Coach win to date, back in 2015. For his Blind Audition, the blues singer-songwriter performed a hauntingly beautiful rendition of the traditional American folk song \"I'm a Man of Constant Sorrow.\"\n\nThe performance scored Fredericks a four-chair turn and set the tone for many incredible performances. From his Top 10 performance of Goo Goo Dolls' \"Iris\" to his Live Finale twist on Neil Young's \"Old Man,\" Fredericks' insane vocals impressed the crowds at home so much that he seized the crown.\n\nAfter winning The Voice, Fredericks kept up the momentum by performing all over the country. In 2015, he released a self-titled EP of singles, including the original tracks \"Take It All\" and \"4 Pockets.\" He followed up the release in 2016 with a full album, A Good Storm. Both of Fredericks' debut releases scored him placements on the Billboard Hot 200. Fredericks continues to record new music, and released the EP, The Golden Tree, in 2023.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 9?\n\nSeason 9 winner Jordan Smith made a sensational first impression on the Coaches by choosing Sia's \"Chandelier\" as his Blind Audition. It was a bold move, but Smith absolutely nailed it, earning him a four-chair turn. Smith joined Levine's team after the Maroon Five singer told him, \"I think you're the most important person that's ever been on this show.\"\n\nSmith made a name for himself in Season 9 by tackling songs originally recorded by vocal titans, like his performance of Beyoncé's \"Halo\" and his twist on Queen's \"Somebody to Love.\" Smith had an impeccable ability to take a powerhouse song to new heights, and it scored him the win for the season.\n\nWhile Smith earned the top spot in Season 9, that wasn't his last singing competition. In 2022, Smith also represented his home state of Kentucky in American Song Contest, making it to the Grand Final. Smith currently boast a three-album discography, including his Christmas album 'Tis the Season.\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 10?\n\nSeason 10 winner Alisan Porter was responsible for helping longtime Coach Aguilera score her first win. Before competing on The Voice, though, Porter was an acclaimed child actress, most known as the titular role in the 1991 comedy Curly Sue, as well as a lineup of beloved 80s and 90s television series.\n\nPerforming \"Blue Bayou\" for her Blind Audition, all four Coaches turned their chairs, but Porter ultimately chose Aguilera as her Coach. Aguilera was eager to fine-tune Porter's talent and powerful vocals, and it made for a winner-worthy combination.\n\nRELATED: How to Score Tickets to Christina Aguilera's \"Intimate\" Second Vegas Residency\n\nSince her incredible Voice run, Porter has released two music projects: her 2017 EP I Come in Pieces and the 2019 album Pink Cloud. Porter frequently updates her fans on her Instagram, and she is still performing live and releasing new music, including her 2023 single \"Meant for Me.\"\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 11?\n\nSeason 11 winner Sundance Head (whose given name is Jason Head) was Shelton's record-breaking fifth win. Head's Blind Audition of Otis Redding’s “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long” was a triumph, setting the tone for the amazing performances he'd later deliver.\n\nIt takes courage to perform Alicia Keys' \"No One\" in front of the artist (and rival Coach) herself, but Head tackled the track with flair during his Top 11 performance. He impressed the Coaches time and time again with his big heart, fantastic vocals, and unique renditions of soul classics. While the country crooner didn't get past the Top 16 for American Idol, his Voice run resulted in a victory he worked incredibly hard to earn.\n\nRELATED: Check Out These 14 Country Singers From The Voice Who Captivated Fans\n\nFollowing his victory on The Voice, Head continued to tear down the house with each performance, even opening for the Zac Brown Band. In 2019, Head dropped his debut album, Stained Glass and Neon, and followed that up in 2022 with the release of his second album, Starting Again. He also graced fans with the reflective single \"Bars and Churches.\"\n\nHe is touring in 2024, with tickets available on his website.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 12?\n\nSeason 12 winner Chris Blue was a whirlwind talent who defied the odds. It's never easy to be last in the lineup of Blind Auditions, and Blue was the final Artist to give everything he had for the Coaches that season.\n\nHis Blind Audition of \"The Tracks of My Tears\" by The Miracles was a showstopper, leading him to the ranks of Team Alicia. After several energizing performances — like his champion track \"Money on You\" — Blue claimed the title for the season and scored Keys her first Coach victory.\n\nRELATED: Alicia Keys and John Legend's Cover of \"Let It Be\" Is So Special\n\nFollowing The Voice, Blue continued to perform and record new music, updating his fans on his Instagram. He has released several singles since his run, including 2017's \"Blue Blood Blues\" and \"Humanity,\" as well as his 2019 release \"You Are My Heaven.\" Blue's most recent release was the 2021 single \"Moon,\" a pop-R&B bop.\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 13?\n\nSeason 13 champion Chloe Kohanski made a huge splash from her Blind Audition to the Live Finals, so it was no wonder she took home the victory. Fleetwood Mac's \"The Chain\" is always a bold audition choice, but Kohanski was not to be thwarted during Season 13. Turning three of four chairs, Kohanski was originally a member of former Coach Miley Cyrus' team but lost during the Knockouts.\n\nNo worries: Shelton rescued Kohanski from elimination with his save that season, and she continued to wow audiences with her mesmerizing vocals. In particular, she showcased her winner-worthy talent during the Semifinals with \"I Want To Know What Love Is\" by Foreigner. Kohanski's Season 13 trophy also added another win to Team Blake's impressive track record.\n\nAfter winning the competition, Kohanski returned to The Voice stage in Season 14 to perform her debut original single, \"Come This Far,\" during the Live Finale.\n\nIn 2019, Kohanski changed her stage name to “chloe mk”, releasing the single \"To Be Young\" under the new moniker, later accompanying the track with a full EP of songs titled Fantasy. She's released two singles since her 2019 EP: 2020's \"Cosmic\" and the 2022 track \"My Other Friend.\"\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 14?\n\nThe talented Brynn Cartelli has the honor of being the Season 14 winner. Taking home the trophy at 15 years old, she made history as the youngest female Artist to claim the title, replacing Season 3 champion Bradbery. Coach Kelly Clarkson hopped into the coaching chair for the first time in Season 14 and immediately snatched herself a winner with Cartelli.\n\nAfter her Blind Audition of \"Beneath Your Beautiful\" by Labrinth, Cartelli chose to join Team Kelly after both Clarkson and Shelton turned their chairs. The 15-year-old Artist later stunned audiences with her cover of Coldplay's \"Fix You\" and her Live Finale performance of \"Skyfall\" was so, so good. When Cartelli was announced the season's champion, Clarkson scored her first Team Kelly win of many to come.\n\nFollowing her smash run on The Voice, Cartelli opened for Clarkson on the latter's 2019 \"Meaning of Life\" Tour. Returning during Season 15 of The Voice as a guest, she performed her debut original single, \"Last Night's Mascara.\" After releasing several more singles, such as her beloved bop \"Girl Code,\" Cartelli released her first EP, Based on a True Story, in 2021. In 2023, Cartelli released two new singles: \"Secondhand Smoke\" and \"Lucky to Love You.\"\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 15?\n\nSeason 15 champion Chevel Shepherd helped Clarkson make Voice history: Clarkson became first female Coach with multiple victories under her belt. Shepherd's charm and hypnotizing vocals were an instant sell for Clarkson, who managed to snag her away from Shelton and then-Coach Jennifer Hudson after Shepherd's Blind Audition of \"If I Die Young\" by The Band Perry.\n\nShepherd continued to astound audiences with her gorgeous harmonies, singing country classics like The Judds' \"Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)\" and modern hits such as \"Space Cowboy\" by Kacey Musgraves. Performing her original song \"Broken Hearts\" during the Live Finale, the insanely talented country singer took home the win, proving country singers could see success on the show outside Team Blake.\n\nSince her turn on The Voice, Shepherd has released several must-hear singles, including her 2020 bop \"Just Like the Circus,\" co-written by Musgraves. She's also released two albums on Spotify: her 2020 holiday album, A Good Ol' Country Christmas; and 2021's Everbody's Got a Story. In 2023, Shepherd dropped another original single, \"Lookin' for Loretta.\"\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 16?\n\nIn Season 16 — which also brought John Legend to the Coaches' chairs — the powerhouse folk singer responsible for seizing the win was Maelyn Jarmon. Performing \"Fields of Gold\" by Sting, Jarmon impressed all the Coaches but ultimately chose Team Legend on which to stake her claim.\n\nRELATED: The Voice's Jershika Maple Says She Has a 'Lifelong Friendship' With Coach John Legend\n\nJarmon's haunting sound sent her soaring throughout the competition, with crowds falling in love with her take on \"The Scientist\" by Coldplay and her Top 8 set of Rihanna and Mikky Ekko's \"Stay.\" Jarmon's groundbreaking vocals and magnetic charm led her to victory, giving the \"All of Me\" singer the win in his debut season in the red chair.\n\nJarmon released the single “Wait For You\" upon being named the Season 16 winner of The Voice.

While many Artists audition for The Voice and receive four-chair turns, the Artists who surpass lower expectations often make for some of the most unforgettable wins. During his Blind Audition of \"When It Rains It Pours\" by Luke Combs, Hoot joined Team Kelly by default after only Clarkson turned her chair.\n\nDespite the lack of consideration early in his competition, Hoot continued to impress the Coaches and fans each week. Gaining traction with his spin on \"Desperado\" by the Eagles and Rhett Akins' \"That Ain't My Truck,\" Hoot eventually earned a spot in the finale and won the season title.\n\nSince defying the odds on The Voice, Hoot has continued to record new music and perform around the country. Some of his beloved singles include \"Tennessee Strong\" and \"I Would've Loved You\" — which featured his Clarkson and reached No. 3 on the iTunes Country Singles Chart, according to Hoot's website. In addition to Hoot's EP Love Out Of Time, he also released the cheer-inducing holiday single, \"It Wouldn't Be Christmas,\" in 2023.\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 18?\n\nSeason 18 winner Todd Tilghman was a star during every stage of the competition. Auditioning with the song \"We've Got Tonight\" by Kenny Rogers and Sheena Easton, all four Coaches wanted Tilghman for their team. Tilghman ultimately chose Team Blake, which proved to be a ticket to his success.\n\nThe pastor-turned-powerhouse tore down the house with each of his performances, captivating the crowds with his beautiful rendition of MercyMe's \"I Can Only Imagine\" and his stunning cover of \"Power of Love\" by Peter Cetera. Tilghman's bewitching vocals skyrocketed him through each stage of the race, ultimately scoring Team Blake yet another win.\n\nAfter achieving The Voice's highest honor, Tilghman returned to his small town in Mississippi and released several infectious hits as well as a holiday EP. Some of Tilghman's singles include 2022's “Worth It All,” “Home Wasn’t Built In A Day,” and “Fall”. That same year, Shelton invited Tilghman to join him for a performance at the legendary Grand Ole Opry in Nashville.\n\n2023 has graced Tilghman fans with the new singles “Dig My Grave” and \"Still to Come.\"\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 19?\n\nIt's always fun when records are broken on The Voice, and Carter Rubin made history in Season 19 as the youngest male artist to win the competition. For his Blind Audition, Rubin impressed the Coaches with his incredible twist on \"Before You Go\" by Lewis Capaldi. Turning two chairs, Rubin joined Team Gwen.\n\nDuring his Knockouts performance, the 15-year-old spoke out about his experience with bullying and stole the Coaches' breath away with his relevant cover of “You Say” by Lauren Daigle. Rubin upped the ante with his Semifinals performance of The Muppet's \"Rainbow Connection.\" Not only did Carter take home the grand prize, but he also earned Gwen Stefani her first victory as a Coach.\n\nFollowing Rubin's historic Voice run, the young singer has continued to write and record new music, releasing many singles since his Team Gwen tenure. Rubin frequently updates his fans with original music on his Instagram. His original single \"horoscope\" was dropped in 2021, with Rubin taking The Voice stage for a debut performance of the track in Season 20. Rubin followed that up with 2022's \"time machine,\" as well as 2023's \"mess me up\" and \"last time.\"\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 20?\n\nSeason 20 champion Cam Anthony delivered several unforgettable performances throughout his tenure. Anthony's Blind Audition prompted intense deliberation among the Coaches as the 20-year-old had the crowd in the palm of his hand with Sam Smith's 'Lay Me Down.\" Nick Jonas used his block on Legend, but Anthony ultimately decided to choose Shelton as his Coach for Season 20.\n\nAnthony tugged at the heartstrings with his Semifinals performance, a tear-jerking rendition of \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\" by Boyz II Men. Anthony later clarified that the performance was special due to his family's tradition of performing the song at the funerals of loved ones. Earning Shelton his eighth win as a Coach during the Live Finale, Anthony was just getting started.\n\nSince his tenure on The Voice, Anthony has had a successful career jam-packed with performances. In the years before auditioning for The Voice, Anthony had posted performance videos to his YouTube account, TheRealCamAnthony. Following his win, Anthony continues to share incredible covers with his 60K subscribers and counting. In 2023, he released the original sultry jazz track \"Keep It Between Us.\"\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 21?\n\nSeason 21 winners Girl Named Tom made history as the first musical group to ever win the competition. Stunning Coaches with their Blind Audition of \"Helplessly Hoping\" by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, the group instantly became threats with their haunting sibling harmonies. With four Coaches to choose from, the siblings went with Team Kelly.\n\nSiblings Caleb, Joshua, and Bekah Liechty were a tour-de-force of talent, making waves as the first competitors to earn four songs on the iTunes Top 10 at once. Girl Named Tom delivered enchanting harmonies during each stage of the competition until ultimately seizing the title of Season 21 victors and opening the door for other musical groups to win in future seasons.\n\nFollowing their victory, Girl Named Tom continued to amaze audiences with their jaw-dropping harmonies by going on tour in 2022. In December 2022, Girl Named Tom joined the a capella sensation Pentatonix for their \"A Christmas Spectacular\" tour, performing a tear-jerking set of Joni Mitchell's \"River.\" The same year, Girl Named Tom released a holiday album of Christmas hits, One More Christmas. They then released a debut original single, \"What a View,\" in 2023.\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC\n\nWho won The Voice in Season 23?\n\nSeason 23 champion Gina Miles proved she had star power with her explosive Blind Audition of \"The One That Got Away\" by Katy Perry. However, she also made everyone double-take after they heard her soft talking voice. Miles' larger-than-life vocals combined with her hushed speaking tone created a delightful surprise for everyone. As Coach Niall Horan settled into the red chair for the first time, he instantly spotted a champion, recruiting the paradoxical Miles for the first-ever Team Niall.\n\nRELATED: Gina Miles Performed Her Voice Audition Song Again and Somehow Sounded Even Better\n\nFrom her Blind Audition to her equally astounding Live Finale performance of \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" by Sinéad O'Connor, Miles' haunting high notes and incredible belt had a chokehold on crowds. Horan and Gina Miles' rousing duet of Billy Joel's \"New York State of Mind\" further established her as a class act. Miles was crowned the Season 23 champion, gifting Coach Horan with a win during his debut season.\n\nIn the short time since Miles achieved victory on The Voice, she's been a busy powerhouse.

Huntley's daughter, Stella, joined him on stage and made the call for him to join Team Niall. The rocker later dedicated his Playoffs set of \"Daylight\" by David Kushner to his daughter.\n\nHuntley continued to serve up captivating performances at each stage of the competition, his raspy yet powerful vocals leading him to embrace frontrunner status. Huntley's spin on Kaleo's \"Way Down We Go\" left the crowd awestruck, and his Live Finale performance of \"Higher\" by Creed took the track to new heights.\n\nSince winning, Huntley performed the national anthem at the December 2023 Buffalo Bills vs. Los Angeles Chargers game and then performed at the halftime show.
