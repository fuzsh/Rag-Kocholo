        "text": "Francesca Battistelli\n\nThe 2010 and 2011 Dove Awards Female Vocalist of the Year was born on May 18, 1985, in New York. Both of her parents were in a musical theater and she thought that was where her path would lie until, at 15, she became a member of the all-girl pop group Bella.\n\nAfter the group broke up, she started writing her own music and released an indie album, \"Just a Breath,\" in 2004. Her debut with Fervent Records (\"My Paper Heart\") hit stores in July 2008.\n\nFranny is married to Matthew Goodwin (Newsong). They welcomed their first child in October 2010 and their second in July 2012.\n\nFrancesca Battistelli Starter Songs:\n\n\"Time In Between\"\n\n\"Something More\"\n\n\"Lead Me To The Cross\"\n\nChristy Nockels\n\nChristy Nockels first hit the national spotlight as part of the Passion conferences. From there, she added to her musical resume by forming Watermark with her husband Nathan. After five albums with Rocketown Records and seven No. 1 hits, the husband and wife team decided to retire Watermark and focus on other areas of their ministry.\n\nChristy's first solo project came out in 2009 and she has been continuing to bless us with her voice ever since.\n\nChristy Nockels Starter Songs:\n\n\"Life Light Up\"\n\n\"The Wondrous Cross\"\n\n\"The Glory of Your Name\"\n\nTamela Mann\n\nTamela Mann isn't just a Dove Award-winning singer; this wife and mom is also an acclaimed actress and NAACP Image Award nominee.\n\nAfter starting her career in 1999 with Kirk Franklin and The Family, she has blossomed in all of her roles.\n\nAmy Grant\n\nBy the time she was 16, Amy Grant had released her first album and was on her way to becoming a dominant voice in the Christian music movement. Since then, she has sold 30+ million albums, including albums that have been certified double, triple and quadruple platinum by RIAA by selling 2 million, 3 million and 4 million copies each.\n\nShe has gone gold four times and platinum six times. She has won six Grammy's and 25 Dove's and has performed everywhere from the White House to Monday Night Football. Amy Grant has taken Christian music to a wider audience than any other artist in the Christian genre.\n\nAmy Grant Starter Songs:\n\n\"Better Than A Hallelujah\"\n\n\"El-Shaddai\"\n\n\"Baby, Baby\"\n\nAudrey Assad\n\nAt the age of 19, Audrey Assad answered God's call to take her walk to the next level, and for her, that meant leading Worship in the foyer of a church that she didn't even attend!\n\nLocal events and a demo CD came next. Then, at 25, a move to Nashville, a Christmas tour with Chris Tomlin and a five-song EP was on her path. That CD caught the attention of a Sparrow Records A&R exec. Shortly before Audrey's 27th birthday, her national debut, \"The House You're Building,\" hit stores.\n\nAudrey Assad Starter Songs:\n\n\"Restless\"\n\n\"Show Me\"\n\n\"For Love Of You\"\n\nBarlowGirl\n\nBecca, Alyssa, and Lauren Barlow are best known to the world collectively as BarlowGirl. The three sisters from Elgin, Illinois live together, work together, worship together and make incredible music together.\n\nAfter spending years singing with their dad, Fervent Records picked them up in 2003 and they have released five albums since, with one being a Christmas album. Although they officially retired in 2012, their music lives on.\n\nBarlowGirl Starter Songs:\n\n\"Beautiful Ending (Acoustic)\"\n\n\"Never Alone\"\n\n\"No One Like You\"\n\nBritt Nicole\n\nBritt Nicole grew up singing in a trio with her brother and cousin in her grandfather's church. By the time she was in high school, she was performing on the church's daily TV program. She was signed by Sparrow in 2006 and her debut release, \"Say It,\" came out to much acclaim.\n\nBritt Nicole Starter Songs:\n\n\"Welcome to the Show\"\n\n\"Believe\"\n\nDarlene Zschech\n\nBorn and raised in Australia, Darlene Zschech is known around the world as a singer, songwriter, speaker, and author. She led worship at Hillsong Church for 25 years and became very well known for her song, \"Shout to the Lord.\"\n\nDarlene Zschech Starter Songs:\n\n\"How Majestic Is Thy Name (Psalm 8)\"\n\n\"Shout To The Lord\"\n\n\"To You\"\n\nGinny Owens\n\nFrom being named as the Dove Awards New Artist of the Year to selling nearly a million albums, Ginny Owens has done it all and she has done it with grace. The Jackson, Mississippi native may have lost her sight as a young child, but she has never faltered in her drive or passion.\n\nGinny Owens Starter Songs:\n\n\"Free\"\n\n\"Pieces\"\n\nHeather Williams\n\nHeather Williams doesn't bring a picture perfect past to the table when she sings. Instead, she brings loss—the loss of her own childhood through abuse and the loss of her firstborn son six months after his birth. She also brings hope—the hope that can only be found when you completely give yourself to God. Heather also brings the kind honesty that is only found through wisdom.\n\nHeather Williams Starter Songs:\n\n\"Start Over\"\n\n\"Holes\"\n\n\"You Are Loved\"\n\nHolly Starr\n\nWith three albums under her belt by 2012, at 21, Holly Starr was really just getting started. Discovered by Brandon Bee on MySpace through some of the songs that she had recorded with her youth group, she has toured the country, sharing her music and her message with thousands.\n\nHolly Starr Starter Songs:\n\n\"Don't Have Love\"\n\nJaci Velasquez\n\nThis popular artist has had two Latin Grammy nominations, three English Grammy nominations, five Latin Billboard Award nominations, a Latin Billboard Female Pop Album of the Year award, and six Dove Awards.\n\nEven more, she got the El Premio Lo Nuestro Award for New Artist of the Year, Soul to Soul Honors, an American Music Award nomination, three RIAA-certified platinum albums, three RIAA-certified gold albums, 16 No. 1 radio hits and more than 50 magazine covers. What's most surprising is that this all happened before the age of 30!\n\nJaci Velasquez Starter Songs:\n\n\"On My Knees\"\n\n\"Sanctuary\"\n\n\"I WIll Rest In You\"\n\nJamie Grace\n\nThe daughter of two pastors, Jamie Grace has been making music since the young age of 11. Signed by Gotee Records in 2011, the talented young woman, who was discovered by TobyMac, added college graduate to her impressive resume in May 2012.\n\nJJ Heller\n\nJJ Heller has been performing full time since 2003 when she and her husband, Dave, took a leap of faith after graduating college and decided to fully pursue music. That leap paid off. By 2010, her music was being heard by millions of listeners.\n\nJJ Heller Starter Songs:\n\n\"Olivianna\"\n\n\"Only You\"\n\nKari Jobe\n\nThis worship pastor at Gateway Church in Southlake, Texas is also a member of Gateway Worship, the worship band associated with Gateway Church. Signed with Sparrow Records, Kari Jobe has won two Dove Awards. One was for Special Event Album of the Year and the other for Spanish Language Album of the Year.\n\nKari Jobe Starter Songs:\n\n\"Find You On My Knees\"\n\n\"Joyfully\"\n\n\"Nos Levantaremos\"\n\nKerrie Roberts\n\nWhen Kerrie Roberts first started singing in church, she was so young (age 5) that in order to be seen in the choir, she had to stand on a milk crate. Her parents, a pastor and his choir director wife, continued to nurture her love of music. This went on through Kerrie's degree in studio music and jazz vocal from the University of Miami to her move in 2008 to New York City. In 2010, when she was signed by Reunion Records, the entire family saw her dreams come to fruition.\n\nKerrie Roberts Starter Songs:\n\n\"No Matter What\"\n\n\"Lovable\"\n\nMandisa\n\nAfter graduating college with a degree in music, Mandisa worked as a backup singer for a wide variety of artists including Trisha Yearwood, Take 6, Shania Twain, Sandi Patty, and Christian author and speaker Beth Moore.\n\nAmerican Idol's fifth season changed her life, moving her from the background to the forefront. Though she didn't win American Idol, she did make it to the top nine, and after the Idol tour, she was signed by Sparrow Records in early 2007.\n\nMandisa Starter Songs:\n\n\"The Definition Of Me\" f/ Blanca from Group 1 Crew\n\n\"Just Cry\"\n\n\"Back To You\"\n\nMartha Munizzi\n\nAs a Pastor's daughter, Martha Munizzi grew up in Christian music, going on the road with her family's traveling music ministry at the age of eight.\n\nFrom Southern Gospel to Urban Gospel to Praise & Worship, she has done it all, and by blending all that she knew and loved, Munizzi went on to create her own personal style. That style won her the Best New Artist Award at the 2005 Stellar Awards - the first time a non-African American singer had taken home the trophy.\n\nMartha Munizzi Starter Songs:\n\n\"God is Here\"\n\n\"Because of Who You Are\"\n\n\"Glorious\"\n\nMary Mary\n\nThough they grew up singing in church choirs since 2000, sisters Erica and Tina Atkins have been wowing fans of Urban Gospel with some of the biggest hits in the genre. Seven Dove Awards, three Grammy Awards, 10 Stellar Awards and major mainstream success has followed them, and they just keep getting better!\n\nMary Mary Starter Songs:\n\n\"Survive\"\n\n\"Speak To Me\"\n\n\"Sitting With Me\"\n\nMoriah Peters\n\nGrowing up, Moriah Peters always loved music, but her \"life plans\" didn't include making it. The high school honor student planned to take the college route with a major in psychology and a minor in music, which would lead her to law school and a career as an entertainment lawyer. A simple prayer for God to use her and lead her in the direction He chose for her led her to music.\n\nAt an early audition, the American Idol judges told her to go out and get experience. She didn't stop following God. Instead, she made a demo and headed to Nashville with three songs and no experience. Several record labels made offers and she signed with Reunion Records.\n\nMoriah Peters Starter Songs:\n\n\"Glow\"\n\n\"All The Ways He Loves Us\"\n\n\"Sing in the Rain\"\n\nNatalie Grant\n\nNatalie Grant was only 17 when she got involved in music at her church. It wasn't long before she was singing with the group the Truth. She spent two years with them before heading to Nashville to pursue a solo career.\n\nShe signed with Benson Records in 1997 and released her self-titled debut album in 1999. A move to Curb Records came next—she has released six albums with them. Grant was the Dove Female Vocalist of the Year from 2006 - 2012.\n\nNatalie Grant Starter Songs:\n\n\"You Deserve\"\n\n\"Only You\"\n\n\"Song To The King\"\n\nNichole Nordeman\n\nNichole Nordeman got her start in Colorado Springs, Colorado playing piano in her home church. Her music minister told her about the GMA's Academy of Gospel Music Arts contest and suggested she enter.\n\nNichole took his advice and won the contest, getting the attention of the Vice President of Star Song records, John Mays. Her first album produced four hits on the Christian adult contemporary charts.\n\nNichole Nordeman Starter Songs:\n\n\"Legacy\"\n\n\"To Know You\"\n\n\"Holy\"\n\nPlumb\n\nPlumb (otherwise known as Tiffany Arbuckle Lee), first came into the national spotlight when her band got signed in 1997. Three years and two albums later, the band broke up and she made the decision to leave the stage and focus on songwriting instead.\n\nA fan's note about how her song had changed her life reversed her course and she started down the solo artist road, signing with Curb in 2003.\n\nPlumb Starter Songs:\n\n\"I Want You Here\"\n\n\"Chocolate & Ice Cream\"\n\n\"Sink n' Swim\"\n\nPoint of Grace\n\nSince 1991, the ladies of Point of Grace have shared their passion for the Lord with us through their music. Twelve albums, 27 No. 1 radio singles, and 9 Dove Awards show that they've been doing a fantastic job!\n\nPoint of Grace Starter Songs:\n\n\"There Is Nothing Greater Than Grace\"\n\n\"How You Live [Turn Up The Music]\"\n\n\"Circle Of Friends\"\n\nRebecca St. James\n\nRebecca St. James isn't just a Dove and Grammy award-winning singer and a songwriter; she is also an accomplished author, actress, and advocate for sexual abstinence until marriage, and pro-life.\n\nHer projects include nine albums, nine books, and 10 films. As a spokesperson for Compassion International, she has seen over 30,000 of her fans reach out to sponsor children in need at her concerts.\n\nRebecca St. James Starter Songs:\n\n\"Alive\"\n\n\"Beautiful Stranger\"\n\n\"Forever\"\n\nSara Groves\n\nSara Groves has written songs almost her entire life, but for years, she didn't really consider them as life-changing for anyone but herself. After college, she spent a few years teaching high school, singing during her off hours.\n\nIn 1998, she recorded her first album as a gift for her family and friends. Little did she know that her gift to her loved ones would give her a new career. For this wife and mom of three, that career has resulted in several albums, three Dove nods and the realization that her music does change lives by pointing people to God.\n\nSara Groves Starter Songs:\n\n\"Hiding Place\"\n\n\"Like A Lake\"\n\n\"This House\""
