        "text": "Do You Remember All The Winners?\n\nDo you remember who won each series of The X Factor? Perhaps you and your friends want to quiz each other?\n\nThe first name on our list is Steve Brookstein, the very first winner of The X Factor. Since his victory, Steve has kept a low profile and has been working on releasing three albums - the first of which was \"Heart and Soul.\" Certified Gold in the UK, it topped the charts at No. 1. Over the two decades since The X Factor, he's been keeping it real and reminding us why we fell in love with his music in the first place.\n\n2005: Shayne Ward\n\nNext up, we have Shayne Ward, whose smooth vocals captured our hearts back in 2005. Since winning The X Factor, Shayne has been hitting all the right notes, from releasing hit singles to starring in musicals like \"Rock of Ages.\" The shaved head has gone, replaced by shoulder-length brown hair. In 2023, Shayne was seen on the \"This Morning\" programme promoting his new series, \"The Good Ship Murder.\"\n\n2006: Leona Lewis\n\nAh, Leona Lewis, the queen of The X Factor! With her powerhouse voice and undeniable talent, Leona stole the show in 2006. Since then, she conquered the charts, won Grammy Awards, and even made her film debut in \"Walking on Sunshine\" in 2014.\n\n2007: Leon Jackson\n\nLeon Jackson may have won The X Factor in 2007, but he's been making waves ever since. With his soulful voice and charming personality, Leon has continued to captivate audiences with his music, releasing several singles and his album \"Right Now.\"\n\n2008: Alexandra Burke\n\nWho could forget the incredible Alexandra Burke? With her powerhouse vocals, Alexandra dominated The X Factor stage in 2008. Since then, she's released hit singles, starred in musicals such as \"The Bodyguard\" and \"Sister Act The Musical,\" and even won Strictly Come Dancing. In 2009, Alexandra became the face of a new fashion line for Dolce and Gabbana, modelling their clothes in her music videos.\n\n2009: Joe McElderry\n\nWith his infectious smile and amazing voice, Joe McElderry stole our hearts in 2009. Since winning The X Factor, Joe has released multiple albums, toured the world, and even appeared in musical theatre productions such as playing Joseph in \"Joseph and the Technicolour Dreamcoat.\" He is regularly found in panto, with his latest Christmas show being \"Pinocchio\" at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle.\n\n2010: Matt Cardle\n\nMatt Cardle was the heartthrob of The 2010 X Factor! With his soulful voice and rugged good looks, Matt won over audiences. Since then, he's released hit singles, toured the world, and even ventured into acting. He played the role of Pilate in the Barbican's run of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" in 2019 and has been working on music with his old band Seven Summers.\n\n2011: Little Mix\n\nLittle Mix burst onto the scene in 2011 and haven't looked back since. With their killer harmonies, these ladies took The X Factor crown by storm. They became one of the biggest girl groups in the world, with hit singles, sold-out tours, and even their own makeup line. Originally named Rhythmix, they changed their name to Little Mix to avoid confusion with a children's charity. Originally comprising Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards, and Jesy Nelson, Jesy left the group in 2020. By 2022, they decided to take time to pursue their solo careers\n\n2012: James Arthur\n\nWith his gritty vocals and raw talent, James Arthur won over audiences in 2012. Since then, he's released hit singles, toured the world, and even won a BRIT Award. He's definitely proven that he's here to stay.\n\n2013: Sam Bailey\n\nSam Bailey wowed us all with her powerhouse vocals and down-to-earth charm in 2013. Since then, she's released hit albums, starred in musicals, and even won Celebrity MasterChef. Talk about a talented lady!\n\n2014: Ben Haenow\n\nWith his rockstar attitude and amazing voice, Ben Haenow stole the show in 2014. Since then, he's released hit singles, toured the world, and even collaborated with some of the biggest names in music. Rock on, Ben!\n\n2015: Louisa Johnson\n\nLouisa Johnson may be the youngest winner of The X Factor, but she made a big impact. With her incredible voice and bubbly personality, Louisa won over audiences around the world. Her life since The X Factor has not always been easy, with health issues coming to the fore more recently.\n\n2016: Matt Terry\n\nMatt Terry charmed audiences with his smooth vocals and boy-next-door charm in 2016. Since then, he's released hit singles, toured the world, and even appeared in West End productions such as \"Madagascar - The Musical\" and \"How The Grinch Stole Christmas - The Musical.\" Matt released his latest single, \"Ghost of Me,\" in February 2024.\n\n2017: Rak-Su\n\nRak-Su brought something fresh and exciting to The X Factor stage in 2017. History was made when they went on to win The X Factor singing their own song. With their catchy tunes and infectious energy, these guys won over audiences worldwide. Since then, they've released hit singles, toured the world, and even won a BRIT Award. In 2020, Mustafa decided to take a break from the band due to ill health.\n\n2018: Dalton Harris\n\nLast but certainly not least, we have Dalton Harris, the winner of The X Factor in 2018. With his incredible voice and heartfelt performances, Dalton stole the show and captured our hearts. Since then, he's released hit singles, toured the world, and even collaborated with some of the biggest names in music before deciding to concentrate on regional theatre.\n\nThe X Factor's last winner, Dalton Harris joined forces with the 2012 winner James Arthur to produce a single Power of Love which reached number four in the chart.\n\nOf course, not winning the show did not mean the end of things for some. There are several big names that didn't quite make the number one spot on the night who went on to become successful household names - Stacey Solomon and One Direction are great examples and are more well known today than some of the actual winners."
