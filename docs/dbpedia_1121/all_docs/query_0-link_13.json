        "text": "The University Singers, the University of Virginia’s premiere choral ensemble, will take its first international concert tour in several decades, appearing in England, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Austria. The ensemble will present a program of a cappella and accompanied works featuring composers from Whitacre and Pärt, to Lukaszewski, Dvorak, Bruckner, Finzi, and Biebl, and also featuring several American folk songs and spirituals. Led by UVa faculty conductor Michael Slon, the ensemble will perform in London, Cambridge, Prague, Krakow, Brno, and Vienna – including a Choral Evensong with the UVa Chamber Singers and Jesus College Choir, Cambridge and a special joint concert with the Brno Philharmonic Choir. University of Virginia alumni in attendance will be able to join the Singers in the traditional UVa songs.\n\nThe University Singers began the 2014-2015 season singing for Les Misérables creators Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil during their UVa residency, and also performed before 10,000 at the Kevin Spacey President’s Arts Speaker event. Founded in 1957, the group performs a cappella and accompanied choral literature ranging from medieval chant to major choral-orchestral works, and the works of contemporary composers. Recent repertoire has included Beethoven’s Symphony no. 9, Bach's Mass in B minor, Handel’s Messiah, Bernstein’s Chichester Psalms, the Verdi Requiem, and Mendelssohn's Elijah, as well as premieres of works by Stephen Paulus, Forrest Pierce, Judith Shatin, and Eric Whitacre. Recent U.S. tours have taken the group to Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Charlotte, Charleston, Chicago, Cincinnati, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, Providence, Virginia Beach, and the National Cathedral in Washington D.C., as well as the campuses of other American universities for collaborative concerts. The group has also been heard on previous European tours in England, Italy, Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland. Other choral program highlights have included: concerts and workshops with Bobby McFerrin and Meredith Monk, a performance for Hillary Clinton, selection to perform for the 2010 Virginia Music Educators Association (VMEA) Conference, a 2012 workshop with members of the Tallis Scholars, a 2014 performance for Philip Glass, and frequent collaborations with the Charlottesville Symphony.\n\nStudents in the University Singers come from UVa's six undergraduate schools, including Arts and Sciences, Education, and Engineering, as well as several of the University's graduate and professional schools. While approximately 25-30% are music majors, the ensemble is open to any student by audition, and is a for-credit curricular class. Together, members enjoy an esprit de corps that arises from the pursuit of musical excellence, and the camaraderie the singers develop offstage.\n\nThe complete tour itinerary follows. Most concerts are free and open to the public; information for tickets to the London concert is included below.
