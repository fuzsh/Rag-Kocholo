        "text": "Singing competition shows have carved out their own niche within the reality TV zeitgeist in the past 20 years. Whereas some shows in that genre aim to document the ordinary — think the early successes of shows like The Real World or Big Brother, though the latter includes a competitive element to it — singing competitions wanted to transform normal people into overnight pop stars.\n\nMany now see American Idol and the worldwide Idol franchise as a pioneer of the singing competition format. The series, which launched in the early 2000s (first in the U.K. then breaking through in the U.S.), is perhaps one of the most important pieces of intellectual property that emerged from that decade, having generated more than $2.5 billion in revenue since its inception. But that series had a blueprint to work off of, another series that helped establish the genre's formula and prove that a show of that scale was possible. That series was called Popstars.\n\nIn 1999, New Zealand launched the Popstars franchise. Similar to Idol, The X Factor and another early success, Making the Band, Popstars was a series that focused on finding and creating the next big music star. Depending on the season, the goal was to discover a solo artist or have the winners form their own group. It was here that the audition process was born, a routine format that has become key to a show like Idol, which drew viewers in for its roulette edit of incredible performers next to people who can't remotely sing on key. That cringe factor that became one of the big selling points of both Popstars and Idol made it a car wreck you couldn't take your eyes off of, and sometimes being a bad singer would get a contestant just as much attention as a rising star in the making. Remember William Hung?\n\nPopstars was a hit in its home country, and its first season produced a five-member girl group named TrueBliss. Shortly after, the show's producer, Jonathan Dowling, licensed the concept to an Australian company, who later sold it to a network in Germany. As the Popstars brand began disseminating, Canadian television producer Michael Geddes flew across the globe to meet with the team behind the series. \"It was the early days of formatted television,\" Geddes explains to CBC Music. (Nowadays, most people refer to this as unscripted TV.) \"Very few projects had really gone around the world until Popstars came along.\"\n\nPopstars arrives in Canada\n\nGeddes was determined to bring Popstars to Canada, and while he obtained the format rights sometime between 1999 and 2000, selling the show to a network was just one of a few big obstacles he encountered. The show, according to Geddes, didn't qualify for Canadian tax credits or any funding grants. The concept of reality TV was just in its infancy, with Survivor and The Real World being the most high-profile examples on air. \"It was a very underappreciated genre at the time,\" Geddes notes, \"And at that time, reality TV was a dirty word. Other genres of television clearly dismissed it.\"\n\nIt wasn't scripted. Whatever footage they got was what they got.- Popstars contestant, Andrea Henry\n\nIn fact, Popstars and other shows that would fall under the reality umbrella at the time used a different term to describe itself: a docu-soap. Instead of producing contestants and judges, and feeding them lines to say to the camera, Popstars was more of a fly-on-the-wall experience, as contestant Andrea Henry recalls: \"It wasn't scripted. Whatever footage they got was what they got; I think the only thing I remember we had to do was we had to re-tape walking in somewhere. But it wasn't like what we were saying was rehearsed or anything.\"\n\nPopstars Canada eventually found a home on Global, and since a singing competition show had never been done here, Geddes was given a lot of leeway in terms of tailoring the series to a local audience. One of those tweaks was dedicating even more episodes to the audition process. The show held a number of auditions in major cities across Canada, and most of them were held at nearby Famous Players movie theatres. In total, almost 10,000 women showed up in hopes of landing a spot in a coveted girl group and getting signed to a major label. That was almost double what Geddes had anticipated. Since social media wasn't available back then, the show mostly relied on TV spots advertising the tryouts.\n\nThat surprise turnout resulted in hours of footage to go through. Geddes says that while everyone was commended for their courage to come out and sing for a panel of judges — which included Geddes alongside music industry professionals like radio personality Billie Holiday and then-senior vice president of A&R at Universal Music Canada, Alan Reid — most people didn't know how to actually sing.\n\n\"It was a bizarre thing to see,\" Geddes says, of the trainwreck factor of it all. He's quick to clarify that this aspect of the show wasn't meant to be mean-spirited or for viewers to laugh at, but that people's sheer boldness and tenacity made for compelling TV. He adds: \"Maybe we all think we can sing, just like we all think we have an opinion.\"\n\nThe birth of Sugar Jones\n\nHenry, who had been working at a summer camp when she heard about auditions taking place, was unsure of what the process would be like. The Hamilton singer had been to music tryouts before so she was comfortable singing a capella for judges, but had no expectations or assumptions beyond that.\n\n\"I was just taking it as it was coming because honestly I had no idea where it was going to lead to except for just that, the opportunity to perform,\" she says.\n\nMaiko Watson was another emerging artist who decided to try her hand at competing on the show. Watson, a teenager at the time of her audition, had seen the MTV series Making the Band prior to Popstars and was captivated by the concept of peeking behind the scenes of a pop group in the making. But even having that show as a template for what she was about to enter into, Watson wasn't prepared for the emotional roller-coaster ride she was about to embark on. She adds that having cameras follow them around constantly was \"one part that I never really liked,\" but knew that she just had to deal with it because it was \"part of the whole gig.\"\n\nWhile singing competition shows now typically stretch out auditions and their subsequent narrowing-down process to multiple weeks and episodes, Popstars was more of a miniature test run for today's more extended format. Instead, Watson and Henry both confirm that the entirety of their journey on the series — from tryouts, to a boot-camp round that narrowed the field to 25 contestants, to finalizing the group, recording a single, and unveiling the group to the public — took just about a month to complete.\n\n\"It felt like it was a year,\" Watson says, laughing at the acceleration of events. Shot mostly in 2000, Popstars Canada premiered in January 2001. By the time its finale aired, where the winning group made its public debut, the show was almost documenting events in real time. \"Real time and television time became very close and tight,\" Geddes says. \"And from a production point of view, that was a tremendous undertaking.\"\n\nWatson was one of the five winners selected — five being an optimal number for a girl group, à la Spice Girls — alongside Sahara MacDonald, Julie Crochetière and Mirella Dell'Aquila. (MacDonald, Crochetière and Dell'Aquila did not respond to CBC Music's requests for an interview.) A fifth person was originally chosen by the judges, but exited before the group's debut. Henry, who had already been informed that she didn't make the group, was brought back into the fold just in time to join the rest of the group in the studio. Both Henry and Watson's first reaction to seeing each other in the group was relief and elation, because Henry feared she would be the \"token Black girl\" of the group.\n\n\"We both wanted each other in the group because we knew it would affect the sound and the look,\" she says. \"This is Canada, why does it have to be just one Black girl? Plus, we have different vocal styles and each of us contributed to the sound of the group in our own way.\"\n\nIn the studio, all the members came together on a name for the group: Sugar Jones.\n\nBecoming real-time pop stars\n\nAs the space between real time and television time were closing in, the winning members had to keep their identities secret, something everyone took extremely seriously because of the growing interest in the show. (In its first season, Popstars became the no. 1 rated show in Canada.) \"There were all these confidentiality forms we had to sign,\" Watson remembers. (Watson, who grew up in Winnipeg, is friends with CBC Music host Odario Williams and sang on a song of his called \"Riding Shotgun\" prior to entering Popstars; as a result of her making it on Popstars, the track and music video were pulled so her name would remain exclusive to her new project.) \"We really couldn't talk to people so we really just had each other to go through this process with,\" she says.\n\nThat time was integral to the five women in terms of bonding and forming a dynamic because, as Henry says, \"None of us knew each other. It was almost like we went to college and these were our new roommates. I'm sure the whole experience was very different for each of us.\"\n\nWhile the show's profile grew, some critics in the music sphere felt suspicious of this newfound format for producing music stars. Almost immediately, there were claims that Sugar Jones was a manufactured act, a discriminatory label that was viewed as inauthentic and valueless in a time when pop acts were already dealing with enough scrutiny to begin with. But Henry didn't see it that way. In fact, she argues that some of her all-time favourite acts — Motown artists — were formed in a structured environment.\n\n\"[In the Motown camp] you had to rehearse, you had to hone your craft, you had to be able to perform live and be able to represent yourself,\" she contends. \"They had done that for years. With us, it was just a different approach. I get why we got that flack, but I don't think it's fair. You're going to be performing, you're going to be on tour, you're going to be on live TV. You're not just going to throw someone on there that doesn't know what they're doing.\"\n\nWatson adds: \"We would just hope that people would listen to the music and make a judgment based on that rather than having this preconceived idea of what we were going to be.\"\n\nSugar Jones recorded its debut, self-titled album at Metalworks in Mississauga, Ont. (Apparently the group crossed paths with *NSYNC there.) Watson jokes that the five members the show landed on ended up being \"a little more stubborn than they anticipated.\" Even though the show was called Popstars, most of the group pushed for a more R&B-leaning sound.\n\nAn example of such was their lead single, \"Days Like That,\" a cover of a song by a U.K. group named Fierce. When it was first presented to the group — a group of songwriters and producers were provided to them by the label, but the women were able to select the songs they wanted — \"Days Like That\" was a more uptempo, glossy number. But, at the insistence of Henry, Watson and others, the song was slowed down, allowing for the singers to really find a groove and sit in the pockets of the song instead of sounding like \"chipmunks,\" as Henry described it.\n\nThe result strayed away from dated pop tropes and instead feels timeless, likely to fit in with today's offering of pop-R&B hybrid artists. When it dropped in mid-2001, the track soared to the top of the Canadian music charts. Williams calls the hit \"a Canadian classic.\" On June 26, 2001, Sugar Jones' album debuted at no. 2 in Canada, and quickly went platinum.\n\nThe group went on to earn a best new group nomination at the 2002 Juno Awards and opened for a string of big-named acts, including Usher and Destiny's Child. (Henry jokes that her proximity to Beyoncé is now a fun piece of trivia that she's passed on to her five-year-old daughter, who loves the mega-star. (\"You know mommy was on the same stage as Beyoncé,\" Henry told her.)\n\nThat level of instant stardom feels commonplace now thanks to the internet, but back then, it was a jarring experience for Sugar Jones. Henry flashes back to a memory of walking into a bank in Toronto with MacDonald, and suddenly realizing that a group of fans were eagerly peering inside at them. \"It was trippy, to be honest,\" Henry says, adding that she felt the pressure to hide. After all, being a woman can be anxious enough in public, let alone a famous one.\n\nIn addition to navigating their new fame, Sugar Jones' members also found that the attention and resources that Popstars and Universal Music Canada had given them initially began to wane as the series geared up for a second season. \"It was a tough ride for them,\" admits Geddes, who had no experience in the music industry prior to creating this show. \"Once the show was over, we kind of took them off the nurturing and they were at the helm of their own destiny. It's pure commerce from that point on.\"\n\nIn total, Sugar Jones lasted almost five years together. Watson was the first to exit the group, leaving to focus on her personal life, which included singing in her then-husband Remy Shand's band. There were talks of recording a second album — Shand even joined them in the studio to pen some tracks — but it never came to fruition. Watson suggests Sugar Jones likely would've moved into a more \"soulful, adult contemporary\" direction instead of veering more toward pop. But Henry says Sugar Jones' now small, but powerful cult following is maybe more fervent today because they only put out one album, leaving fans clamouring for more.\n\nWatson wasn't the sole reason the group disbanded. Henry says it was a host of reasons, including the fact that Sugar Jones' members, while having weathered a lot together, were still ultimately strangers thrown together by chance. Most members went on to make music on their own, including Watson and Henry, who continue to work in music in addition to a number of other artistic mediums, including theatre and visual arts.\n\nTwenty years later, both Watson and Henry are grateful for the opportunity Popstars gave them. Thanks to it, they were able to learn the ropes from inside the music industry — at one point, standing in the eye of the storm as the most talked-about act in the country. That kind of knowledge is invaluable, and as Watson says, \"It was definitely a period of time that we can look back on and cherish.\"\n\nThe uncertain future of singing competition shows\n\nEven though it went on to inspire the creation of the Idol series, the legacy of Popstars has faded a lot in the past 15 or so years. Episodes have mostly been scrubbed from the internet because of expired music rights, and even though Popstars expanded to more than 50 countries, many of them only lasted a few seasons, quickly buckling under the outsized phenomenon of Idol. (Germany, an early adopter of the franchise, had the longest-running version, lasting 11 seasons that aired up until 2015.)\n\nEven in Canada, Popstars was axed by Global after three seasons just as CTV was revving up its own Idol offshoot, Canadian Idol. Geddes, who was tapped by Idol production company Freemantle to help develop its Canadian edition, decided to stay on \"the horse I was already on called Popstars.\" Canadian Idol went on to double Popstars Canada's run with six seasons. But looking back now, Geddes says he has no regrets.\n\n\"I don't think any of the acts that came out of [Canadian Idol] did anything close to what we did with Sugar Jones,\" he says.\n\nGeddes admittedly doesn't watch a lot of singing competition series now — he is particularly bewildered by the popularity of shows like The Masked Singer — but when asked what that genre is missing today, he points out its lack of focus on the most vital part of those shows: talent. \"They have a lot of star power attached to these shows now,\" Geddes points out. \"Whereas, when you look at the early seasons of American Idol, nobody knew the judges. Simon Cowell wasn't a celebrity; nobody in TV knew who Randy Jackson was and Paula Abdul was a D-lister. Now it's different.\" Now viewers are just as likely to tune in to watch Katy Perry judge Idol or John Legend turn his chair around for contestants on The Voice. That conversion rate of viewers turning into fans of the winning artist or group is much lower.\n\nBut as the success rate of singers on reality TV continues to dwindle, the idea of breaking out and finding overnight stardom is more accessible than ever before. In the years since Popstars and Idol debuted, the internet has become a bigger vehicle for musicians. YouTube, Vine and now TikTok wield just as much, if not more, power than a panel of judges on TV. Instead of flipping to a channel to watch someone become a star, all you have to do now is open an app and witness someone's reality transform into a pop star dream.\n\nMaybe in another 20 years, that pop star-making machine will evolve once again."
