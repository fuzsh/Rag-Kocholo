        "text": "Three composers, three librettists, and one dramaturg have been selected as Resident Artists to participate in the company’s nationally acclaimed Composer Librettist Development Program (CLDP) beginning in September 2024. The artists selected for this prestigious residency and training program are librettists Laura Barati, C.S. Hanson, and Sam Norman; composers Ivette Herryman Rodríguez, Kathleen Tagg, and Del’Shawn Taylor; and dramaturg Dezi Tibbs.\n\n“Every opera we love was once a new work,” says Edelson. “That cycle must continue. To be a catalyst for new opera, we must mentor diverse artists who have the potential to create our new American operatic repertoire. Historically, opera companies have dedicated significant resources to support and train emerging singers. Until recently, opera companies have not invested the same resources in the training of writers for the stage. ALT was among the ﬁrst to drive this change. In 2007, we created the Composer Librettist Development Program - the ﬁrst - and still the only - full-time, tuition-free, professional mentorship initiative for gifted emerging operatic writers in the country. The program trains both composers and librettists - as well as opera dramaturgs - and has served as a model of innovation to the ﬁeld. Alumni of the CLDP have written operas that have now been produced by over 70 companies internationally. We are thrilled to welcome seven new artists to the CLDP this season - artists who join our distinguished alumni on our collective journey to change the face of American opera.”\n\nThrough a combination of intensive mentorship and direct financial support, ALT provides a unique environment for artists to develop their craft, forge new collaborations, and take exciting risks. At the center of the CLDP is ALT’s core-curriculum, which consists of classroom training and hands-on workshops with some of the country’s leading working artists. For the 2024-25 season, faculty mentors will include composer/librettist Mark Adamo; composer Scott Davenport Richards; librettists Deborah Brevoort, and Mark Campbell; dramaturg Cori Ellison; mezzo soprano Adriana Zabala; stage director Lawrence Edelson; and conductor Kelly Kuo, who joined ALT as Associate Artistic Director in 2021.\n\nSeveral public events will be presented by ALT in New York City to introduce the work of Resident Artists to the public this season, including The Living Libretto, at The National Opera Center’s Scorca Hall on Sunday, March 2nd, 2025; and Opera in Eden, at Symphony Space’s Thalia Theater on Saturday, June 14th, 2025. Further details about these events and the rest of ALT’s performance season will be announced in late August.\n\nBiographies\n\nLAURA BARATI (she/her) is a librettist and deviser of new works.
