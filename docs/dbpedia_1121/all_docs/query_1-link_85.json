        "text": "You might have noticed Strictly Come Dancing has been dominating the headlines even more than usual lately.\n\nNot only is the long-running dance show currently under a BBC investigation following complaints made by several former celebrity contestants, at the same time, the broadcaster is currently gearing up for this year’s series, which is aiming to celebrate 20 years since the very first episode.\n\nSo yeah, safe to say there’s a lot going on.\n\nIn the lead-up to this year’s series, bosses have slowly begun unveiling the celebrity line-up, which so far includes people from across the world of TV, music, sport and beyond.\n\nHere are all the Strictly 2024 contestants that have been revealed at the time of writing, and make sure you keep checking back, as more are to be announced in the coming days…\n\nChris McCausland\n\nComedian Chris McCausland is set to make history as the first blind contestant to ever compete on Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nAfter becoming the first of this year’s celebrities to be unveiled, he joked: “I don’t dance, I haven’t danced, I can’t dance, I can’t see the dancing I will have to do. What can possibly go wrong?”\n\nJB Gill\n\nChart-topping singer JB Gill first rose to fame on The X Factor, as part of the boyband JLS. After finishing in second place, the group went on to score a string of hits, including five UK number ones, and two Brit Award wins.\n\nJB is no stranger to the dance floor, having won Strictly’s Christmas special back in 2012. He also competed in ITV’s short-lived Strictly rival Dance Dance Dance back in 2017, finishing in third place alongside his wife Chloe.\n\n“I danced in the Strictly Christmas special over a decade ago and loved it, so when I got the call to join Strictly this year, it was an immediate yes from me,” he revealed.\n\n“I’m raring to go to and looking forward to showing off some new skills to the JLS boys. From muddy wellies on the fields of my farm to sequins and Glitterballs – I’m here to embrace it all!”\n\nWynne Evans\n\nWhen Welsh performer Wynne Evans was revealed as the third celebrity on the Strictly Come Dancing line-up, he was referred to as a “broadcaster, presenter, and professionally trained opera singer”.\n\nAll of that is true, of course, but they failed to mention what we best know him for – portraying the operatic Gio Compario in the car insurance site Go Compare’s long-running ad campaigns.\n\nHe said he’d be representing “every portly, middle-aged father out there” on the Strictly dance floor, adding: “Me, taking part in Strictly Come Dancing?! I’m not entirely sure how I’ll get along, if all else fails I’ll just have to learn the art of distraction.\n\n“What I do know is I will give it my all and aim to make Wales proud. I’m definitely going to try and combine my love of Opera into one of my routines.”\n\nToyah Wilcox\n\nBritish music legend Toyah Wilcox is known for hits including It’s A Mystery, Thunder In The Mountains and I Want To Be Free.\n\nShe explained: “This is going to be a wild and wonderful ride, and I’m here for every sparkly second.”\n\n“I’m used to performing for big crowds but this is completely fresh for me. How I will do? It’s a mystery,” Toyah joked, adding: “I just want to get cracking and learn some dance routines now!”\n\nDr Punam Krishan\n\nGP-turned-TV-personality Punam Krishan will be a familiar face to viewers of the BBC’s Morning Live, where she’s the daytime show’s resident medical expert. She’s also the author of books including How To Be A Doctor And Other Life-Saving Jobs and the upcoming The Superhero’s First Aid Manual.\n\nPunam admitted her forthcoming Strictly stint “still doesn’t feel real”, revealing: “I am overjoyed to be a contestant on this year’s show. I have watched Strictly every year with my family and it feels extra special that it’s the 20th year, I can’t believe I will be the one getting Strictly-fied now.\n\n“This is so out of my comfort zone, but I’m up for the journey and will give it my absolute all.”\n\nTasha Ghouri\n\nTo most of us, Tasha Ghouri is best remembered for her stint on Love Island in 2021, making it all the way to the final alongside her boyfriend Andrew Le Page.\n\nBefore entering the Love Island villa, Tasha was already a trained dancer, appearing in one of MNEK’s music videos as part of a dance troupe made up entirely of performers who were deaf or hard of hearing. She also briefly dated departing Strictly professional Giovanni Pernice.\n\nShe said she hoped to “represent and make everyone proud” in the Strictly ballroom, sharing: “I’ve been watching the show since I was little – it’s a firm Ghouri family favourite - so this is a total dream come true.”\n\nPete Wicks\n\nReality star Pete Wicks first made a name for himself when he joined the cast of The Only Way Is Essex, remaining with the docusoap for seven years.\n\nHis other reality show appearances have included Celebs Go Dating, where he struck up a friendship with fellow media personality Sam Thompson, as well as Celebrity MasterChef, The Celebrity Island, Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls and two seasons of Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, after having to pull out of his first run due to an injury.\n\n“Dancing live in front of the nation every Saturday? Absolutely terrifying,” he confessed. “But anyone who knows me knows I love a challenge and trying new things, so I’m genuinely looking forward to getting stuck in.”\n\nTom Dean\n\nAfter his success at the Paris Olympics, the swimmer let slip that he had signed up for the new series of Strictly.\n\nThe gold medallist’s name also appeared on a leaked line-up published by The Sun ― after which Tom’s Strictly signing was finally confirmed on Matt Richardson and Mollie King’s Radio 1 show, to less-than-shocked fans.\n\nHe previously claimed: “I thought it would be really exciting to try something a bit different. I’ll be doing that and straight back into training after it. It’s something to look forward to.\n\n“I’ve not seen [fellow Olympic swimmer and Strictly alum Adam Peaty] yet. He did brilliantly on it so I’ll be getting a few tips from him, for sure.”\n\nIn the more formal (read: not accidental) announcement, Tom said, “I am taking part in Strictly Come Dancing 2024!”\n\nHe added: “You may have heard me accidentally say it poolside first… but now I can officially talk about how excited I am to get stuck into something new, meet some brilliant people and get dancing. Bring it on!”\n\nShayne Ward\n\nFormer X Factor winner and actor Shayne Ward has appeared on Coronation Street as Aidan Connor, and is currently the lead in Channel 5′s The Good Ship Murder.\n\nAnnouncing his upcoming Strictly appearance on Lorraine, the That’s My Goal singer said: “I’m buzzing to see all of the sparkles and magic that is Strictly in real life.”\n\nHe added: “I’m no stranger to live TV, but dancing Latin and Ballroom in front of millions is a whole new level.”\n\n“No promises on my dancing ability, but I will give it my best shot!”\n\nSarah Hadland\n\nYou probably know her best as Stevie in the hilarious sitcom Miranda (although if you loved CBBC’s Horrible Histories show as much as we did, you might recognise the actor from her long-running role in that, too).\n\nShe’s also appeared in The Job Lot, Quantum of Solace, and multiple plays.\n\nSarah told the world about entering Strictly in the same Lorraine interview as Shayne.\n\n“I cannot believe I am part of Strictly,” the star gushed. “I feel particularly excited to be part of such an iconic show in its 20th year. I’m so ready for the glitz, glam and glitter and hopefully I can make everyone watching at home proud!”\n\nJamie Borthwick\n\nThe actor, who plays Jay Brown on EastEnders, has already won the 2023 Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special ― so hopes are pretty high for his upcoming appearance on the show.\n\nLike Tom Dean’s announcement, the news was revealed on Matt and Mollie’s Show on BBC Radio 1.\n\nThe soap legend said: “I had a ball doing the Strictly Christmas special last year, so when I was asked to join for this series it was the easiest yes!”\n\nHe added: “This is a fresh challenge and it will be so different to be learning a new dance every week and for the public to have their say.”\n\n“I’m hoping to be Salsa-ing around Albert Square in no time and I’ll be asking my Walford Strictly alumni for some words of wisdom. See you on the dance floor!”\n\nMontell Douglas\n\nIf the name Montell Douglas doesn’t ring a bell, perhaps her Gladiators alter-ego Fire will.\n\nAs well as appearing in the hit BBC challenge show, Montell is also a celebrated athlete competing in the summer and winter Olympics in the sprinting and bobsled events, respectively.\n\nShe said: “Fire is here to light up the Ballroom. Wow I am so honoured to have been asked to do the show. It is such an amazing thing to be a part of and I can’t wait to get started.\n\n“Hopefully a few of my Gladiator moves will come in handy with the Tango or Paso Doble!”\n\nMORE STRICTLY:"
