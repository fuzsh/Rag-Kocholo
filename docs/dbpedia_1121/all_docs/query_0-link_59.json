Crochetière and her bandmates were chosen from thousands of aspiring singers who auditioned for the show before they released their major-label album Sugar Jones in 2001. Today, Crochetière is flying solo, cross-promoting her latest solo album Counting Dreams on her current tour, which pitstops at Dorval’s Auditorium Serge-Nolet on Jan. 29. Crochetière also got some good news this week: Her album Counting Dreams (which also features her signature cover of the Donny Hathaway classic For All We Know) was nominated for a 2015 Juno Award for Best Vocal Jazz Album of the Year. POP TART recently sat down with Julie for a quick Q&A.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nThere with you then.

On this album I also did what I always wanted to do. When I look back at other artists whom I fell in love with in the first place – people like Bill Withers, Roberta Flack and Carole King – that’s where I went with Counting Dreams.\n\nMusic critics are comparing you to Carole King.\n\nI don’t even know what to say, other than that’s the best compliment I could ever receive.\n\nWhen you think back on your Sugar Jones experience almost 15 years ago ….\n\nThe first word that comes to mind is catapulting! It was an incredible out-of-body experience. I don’t know if we really realized then how big the opportunity was. We got to be the opening act for Destiny’s Child in huge venues, radio was extremely supportive, everything was really big. It didn’t feel as big as it was, I think.\n\nWhat did you take away from that experience?\n\nWhat I’ve learnt is that you really have to cherish your relationships, love your team and appreciate the people you’re working with because [other] people change around you.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nDo you feel Sugar Jones was merely a music-industry pop confection to sell records?\n\nI know what you’re getting at and it’s true what you’re saying. But we were also five individual artists. Now as a solo artist I am able to express who I am and make the music I want to make, without having to blend it in with any other concept. It’s completely different.\n\nWhat was it like to open for Destiny’s Child?\n\nWhat’s funny was the way these girls would travel, when they come through the hallways with their four bouncers. Everybody had to leave and the girls would walk through! But we got to meet them in the cleared hallway, hung out for five minutes. Then they went and did their show!\n\nIf Beyonce was the break-out star of Destiny’s Child, is Julie Crochetière the break-out star of Sugar Jones?\n\nSure! Why not! [Julie laughs.]\n\nWhat’s the best part of performing live?\n\nIt’s always special to see and hear people in the audience singing along to my lyrics. That still feels completely surreal.\n\nJulie Crochetière opens for Ian Kelly at Auditorium Serge Nolet (1301 Dawson Ave.) in Dorval on Jan. 29 at 7:30 p.m. Click here for tickets, and here for the official Julie Crochetière website.\n\ntwitter.com/bugsburnett\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
