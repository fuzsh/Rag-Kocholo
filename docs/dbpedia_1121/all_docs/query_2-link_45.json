        "text": "Free Show – All Ages\n\nIowa’s premier water quality event this summer in the Iowa Great Lakes will culminate with a prestigious musical act on stage, X Ambassadors.\n\nX Ambassadors are a multi-platinum trio formed by brothers Sam Nelson Harris(vocals, guitar, saxophone, bass) andCasey Harris(piano, keys) while the pair were in high school in Ithaca, New York. Later joined by Adam Levin(drums) upon moving to Brooklyn, the trio have gone on to dominate the alternative charts over the last decade.\n\nForming in 2009, the band exploded with the success of their debut album,VHS(2015). The Platinum-certified album provides an intimate look into the childhood of Sam and Casey, and features massive hit singles “Unsteady” and “Renegades,” which have over 1.3 billion streams on Spotify combined and ledt he band to a three-year world tour. VHS was followed by ORION(2019), theBelongEP(2020), TheBeautiful Liar(2021) and (Eg)(2023), a series of collaborative singles featuring artists such as BRELAND, Teddy Swims & Jac Ross, Medium Build, and PAMÉ.\n\nMost recently, the band unveiled a new song, “DeepEnd,” which was written for and featured in the much-anticipated movie Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. The track is just the latest contribution the band has made to major films following “Torches”(Transformers), “Great Unknown” (The Call of theWild) and “Sucker for Pain” (Suicide Squad) among others.\n\nOutside of X Ambassadors, Sam Nelson Harrish as had an eclectic career as a songwriter and producer for artists such as D4VD, 21 Savage, Rihanna, Lizzo, Travis Scott, The Weeknd, SZA and Maren Morris. He has also collaborated with artists including Eminem, Jay-Z, Jacob Banks, K.Flay, grandson, The Knocks, Kygo, Illenium and Machine Gun Kelly. Sam has played the world’s biggest music festivals, headlined countless nationwide and world tours, celebrated a #1 song at Alternative radio and multiple songs in the Top 10. He has recently begun releasing his own solo music for the first time under the name of Sam Nelson.\n\nX Ambassadors will return with their new album Townie on April 5—an album that marks a compelling new chapter for the band as they return to their upstate New York roots. Across 12 deeply personal tracks, the group crafts an intricate portrait of their hometown’s most mundane aspects and the community that shaped them.\n\nTicketed Event (On Sale NOW | VIP – Sold Out) – All Ages\n\nA Tennessee native from a musical family, those instincts have always guided the singer-songwriter – all the way from church choir to coffee-house gigs and eventually Music Row itself. But following his gut wasn’t always so cut and dried. Taught piano early on, he took up drums in high school and formed his first band, trading athletic promise for the rush of the stage and growing into an intoxicating performer. A dynamic front man who lifts crowds up on his own wild-eyed energy, with a near superhuman ability to translate fluttering hearts into musical notation, Dickerson grew up in the shadow of Music City, a kid who counted himself a student of the ‘90s and 2000s country giants. And yet, it took forgetting everything he knew to find success.\n\nIt was just after graduating from Nashville’s Belmont University that Dickerson first hit the road. Wielding an independent spirit and a rich vocal – plus a drive to succeed and an SUV – he’d pack up and head out with his self-written songs, often relying on his wife Kailey for not just inspiration, but photography, video production and more. As the odometer racked up miles, though, it became tough figuring out “something country fans would like,” Dickerson admits. But still, he forged on.\n\n“I told myself ‘I’m just gonna keep going,” Dickerson explains. “‘I’m gonna keep driving my run down SUV all across America playing for 25 people and 250 bucks a night, until something happens.” Something did happen, of course, but not the way he expected. Dropping the idea he could figure out what fans wanted, Dickerson instead embraced what he liked, and 2015’s “Yours” was the result.\n\nFree Show – All Ages\n\nIn the beginning, there was Chicago Transit Authority. Danny Seraphine, along with his bandmates set out to change the face of Rock and Roll by creating a rock band with horns. During his tenure with Chicago, they scored 20 top 10 hits, (5 reaching #1) and 10 Grammy nominations. He is considered the father of jazz rock drumming. Rolling Stone magazine ranks him as one of the top 100 drummers of all time and Larry Thomas, the former CEO of Guitar Center, calls him one of the top 5 living drummers.\n\nDanny was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016. In 2020, he received the Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nIn 2006, Danny came full circle, forming California Transit Authority (CTA). Guitarist Marc Bonilla and Keyboardist Ed Roth have been with CTA since its inception. In 2022, former Chicago bassist/singer Jeff Coffey joined the lineup, making this iteration the most powerful and dynamic in the band’s history.\n\nCTA’s “Take Me Back to Chicago” tour features a dynamic horn section and the iconic hits of Chicago, including all-out rockers “25 or 6 to 4” and “I’m A Man,” pop hits “Saturday In The Park” and “Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is” and chart-topping ballads “Hard Habit To Break” and “You’re The Inspiration”. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, evidenced by all the Chicago cover bands out there. Why settle for an imitation when you can have the real deal!\n\nTicketed Event (On Sale NOW) – All Ages\n\nBoiling down life’s most challenging moments into digestible proclamations of faith is a cornerstone of the Casting Crowns brand. Singable truths that point to Jesus is what they’ve always been about and always will be about. But when setting out to write songs for their latest album, Healer, lead singer and primary songwriter Mark Hall was faced with a brand-new challenge. Like the rest of the world, he was stuck at home in the middle of a pandemic. Mark knew, given the circumstances, he needed to write songs for the moment. But the moment loomed so large, so global, it seemed an impossible task. Mark chose to stick to his signature straightforward truth and did the only thing he could do – he wrote from the heart. As he began crafting songs speaking to his own struggles, his own fears and uncertainty, an undeniable theme\n\nemerged.\n\nHealer, while sonically diverse, drives home one main idea – the need for Jesus the Healer to be the center of our lives. The title track, a sweeping. big-voiced plea-turned-prayer, speaks to the things we often try instead of turning to the Healer. “The point of this song is that healing is not going to come from the people we’re voting for or the people we’re following on screens,” Mark says. “It’s only going to come from Jesus. He is the Healer.”\n\nFree Show – All Ages\n\nThe Pork Tornadoes are without a doubt, the most well-known and loved party band of the Midwest.
