Contrary to the family variety shows of other broadcast stations, 'K-Pop Star 3' has a strong uphill with its totally different content.\"\"The contestants' names rose on portal site search rankings up until the day after the broadcast. We are thinking about it in a positive light. Although we would have to consider the comprehensive production elements for season 4, we are looking at it positively.\"\"The 4:30 PM time slot on Sunday is a time when it's hard to focus on a music program. If you consider that aspect, the viewer ratings are not low. Although I worked on variety shows for 20 years, it is my first time seeing the #1 weekend variety program in viewer ratings regularly changing.\"'Roommate' will be premiering following 'K-Pop Star 3'!http://www.allkpop.com/article/2014/04/sbs-hints-at-a-possible-season-4-of-k-pop-star-----“K-Pop Star” Season 4 to Start This June\n\n“K-Pop Star” is slated to start its fourth season this June.

As you can tell from looking at his agency artists Big Bang, 2NE1, and more, he prefers confidence, charisma, and natural talent.\"Jang Ha Na: \"CEO Yang Hyun Suk surprisingly likes when you groove along to the rhythm with cute motions.\"Kwon Jin Ah: \"Judge Yang Hyun Suk is a man with a soft spot for young contestants who he can't look at cold-heartedly like the 'daughter's fool' image that he shows on broadcast sometimes... He is surprisingly weak when it comes to aegyo.\"Judge J.Y. Park:Bernard Park: \"Showing that you're fixing the habits that they point out is important... Although it was always difficult to 'let your shoulders loose while singing', he looked fondly at the way I tried to fix it little by little, and it became a big help to honing my singing skills.\"Nam Young Joo: \"Judge J.Y. Park likes a person who takes responsibility for the stage rather than someone who sings well... Only when you make the stage your own with your feelings, expressions, and movements along to the song can you receive compliments.\"Heejun: \"[J.Y. Park] is the one who judges the music theory aspect [of the performance] the most meticulously, so if you miss a note, beat, or emotion, he points it out immediately... If you make eye contact with him while singing, you can lose your footing [musically], so the secret to success is avoiding eye contact with judge J.Y. Park.\"\n\nJudge Yoo Hee Yeol:Kwon Jin Ah: \"Judge Yoo Hee Yeol focuses on singing with emotion more, so that music technique... You need to share your story through the music rather than singing as if it was just for an audition.\"Jung Sae Woon: \"Judge Yoo Hee Yeol likes it the most when you sing your story honestly... I remember how he stressed the importance of defining what type of music you want to pursue.\"Heejun: \"If judge Yang Hyun Suk likes a unique image and J.Y. Park likes a correct image, then Yoo Hee Yeol places the most importance on a natural image... Showing judge Yoo Hee Yeol the reason why you want to pursue music and what kind of music you want to do is a very important point.\"\n\nhttp://www.allkpop.com/article/2014/06/k-pop-star-3-finalists-give-tips-to-contestants-of-the-upcoming-season-on-how-to-win-the-judges-hearts"
