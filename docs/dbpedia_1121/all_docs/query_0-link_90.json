        "text": "Hailing from Redlands, CA, Cruel Billie has established herself as an artist who brings bygone eras back to the present. She started off working closely with Riley Geare, formerly of Unknown Mortal Orchestra, who also provided vocals to “Kill Darling!” However, across her still-growing catalog is a strong interest in all things Americana, with a camp slant reminiscent of similar artists such as Lana Del Rey.\n\nUsing the framework of a track produced initially by Kahoots, “Kill Darling!” is a marriage between dream pop and rock that is more rockabilly than anything released in the past few decades. At the outset, Billie’s smoky, seductive vocals are the main reason the song works, tying the atmosphere together as if belonging to a femme fatale with mysterious intentions. Toward the end, a seething guitar hijacks the track, teasing the rise in intensity marked by drums embodying what it’s like to be paranoid in a noir film.\n\nAnother example of Billie’s image is her chosen visuals, ranging from the retro cover art of recent singles to some of the visuals on her YouTube channel. The lyric video for “Kill Darling!” features a montage of archival Las Vegas footage, a setting that would have been conjured while listening to the song with or without the visuals provided. That alone stands as a testament to her creative vision.\n\nOutside of her self-titled EP in 2020 and This Is Kismet, which was co-produced by Geare, Billie has kept to releasing singles these past four years. And while there are similarities to be drawn, even with those distinct starting points, Billie always finds a way to honor the originators of the sounds that inspire her. Whether it be showing what Nancy Sinatra would sound with a darker edge or tastefully adopting the aesthetics of that period, there’s no reason to doubt the quality heard in each release, which is a consistent and driving factor in her music.\n\nWords: David Sosa\n\n“Kill Darling!” by Cruel Billie is out now on all streaming services. For more on new music and potential shows, follow her on Instagram, Bandcamp, and TikTok.\n\nMUST-SEE UPCOMING CONCERTS IN LA!\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links.
