        "text": "Sound: Aggressive, pleading, emotional vocals that could just as easily front an alt band as an MSG-headlining pop outfit.\n\nBreakout Single: Aided by heavy promotion from Apple Music, the New Jersey-raised singer who was first discoveredâ€“where else?â€“via YouTube, exploded out of the gates with her debut single, \"New Americana.\" With its this-is-my-generation posturing and references to Biggie, Tupac, and Nirvana, the track instantly felt lived-in and familiar.\n\nWhy We Love Her: Halsey may only be 21, but the girl born Ashley Frangipane is a definite product of the '90s: \"My mom is 40 and she raised me listening to Nirvana and Courtney Love and Coldplay, Gin Blossoms, The Cranberries, and stuff,\" the 2015 ELLE Women in Music honoree told ELLE. \"My early, early memories are of being a little kid running around in floral skirts and Doc Martens, when I was, like, three.\"\n\nSound: Nineties R&B-meets-contemporary-EDM-infused pop; a power singer who isn't afraid to strip it down for a more gentle number when wielding an acoustic guitar.\n\nBreakout Single: While this year's swaggering \"Nobody Love\" officially launched her into the pop-music orbit, Kelly's acoustic cover of Frank Ocean's \"Thinking Bout You\" is what truly put the pitch-perfect singer on the map.\n\nWhy We Love Her: The former-American Idol contestant not only continues to unleash a slew of infectious singles at a manic clipâ€“see this year's Unbreakable Smile for proofâ€“but she's handled every momentous career moment, such as performing at the Grammy Awards (and performing a live acoustic set at the ELLE.com offices), with seeming ease. Yep, she's a total pro.\n\nSound: Smoky jazz lounge vocals recalling Amy Winehouse over sumptuous beats all biting with contemporary pop inflection.\n\nBreakout Single: The Canadian teenager began uploading covers of Winehouse and Adele songs to YouTube around age 13, but it was \"Here,\" a sullen take on a whack party that catapulted her to stardom and landed her a record deal with Def Jam.\n\nWhy We Love Her: Cara, who released her debut album, Know-It-All, this fall, smartly draws inspiration from the most badass of her musical peers. \"I remember when I heard Lorde's 'Royals' for the first time, it was like, 'Wow she's awesome,'\" she told ELLE.com. \"Not only was it coming from someone who's so young but what she was saying was so the opposite of what you expect to hear from pop stars.\"\n\nSound: Multitalented female rapper just as likely to break off a killer 16 bars as to sing a slinky, melodic hook or verse.\n\nBreakout Single: The Detroit emcee (and sometimes ELLE.com model) gained national attention for 2014's $ell Sole mixtape and, most notably, its hummable single \"Try Me,\" which received major love from Drake, Wiz Khalifa, and Nicki Minaj.\n\nWhy We Love Her: Standing just over five-feet tall, the woman born Deja Trimble may not cut an imposing physical presence, but hand her a mic and all of a sudden: \"Turn a bi*ch to some macaroni,\" she raps on \"Try Me.\" \"Tell me how you want it I'm on it/ I really mean it I'm just not recordin.'\"\n\nSound: Anthemic hooks and fist-raising tales of self-empowerment delivered by a Titanic-size voice.\n\nBreakout Single: You likely first met Steinfeld as the wise-beyond-her-years girl in True Grit, but the actress has always been a singer. The 18-year-old polymath's single \"Love Myself\" off of this fall's Haiz was an immediate radio hit; to date, its video has notched more than 50 million YouTube views on YouTube.\n\nWhy We Love Her: Sure, she counts Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift among her besties, but Steinfeld isn't afraid to admit that she's just as self conscious as the rest of us: \"There are times often where I'm walking around in the world trying to figure out where I belong,\" she told ELLE.com last month. \"Noticing times that I'm uncomfortable is something I've learned to do. I don't have to conform to being cool or to something I'm not.\"\n\nSound: Sassy, no-nonsense country with just the right amount of wide-eyed naivetÃ©.\n\nBreakout Single: \"Love Me Like You Mean It\" finds Ballerini playing the straight shooter: \"I don't have time to waste on the boys that are playing the games,\" she sings. \"And leaving the girls crying out in the rain.\"\n\nWhy We Love Her: Rather than pandering to conservative country values, the 22-year-old talent infused her debut album, The First Time, with a massive dose of feminism. Love that.\n\nSound: Breathy dance diva swagger of '80s-era Janet coupled with decidedly new-age hip-hop and R&B production.\n\nBreakout Single: Last year's critically acclaimed Aquarius brought the 2015 ELLE Women in Music honoree to the music industry forefront, but it was the Los Angeles native's single \"2 On\" that cemented her as a vocal force to be reckoned with.\n\nWhy We Love Her: Yes, she's got the voice, but this fast-rising star also has the vision: She wanted her video for \"All Hands on Deck,\" she told ELLE, \"to be like a movie, when they go to the club and have an epic dance battle.\" And so it was.\n\nSound: A trademark, sandpaper-like growl over rockabilly percussion and chugging electric guitar.\n\nBreakout Single: After cutting her teeth on the Williamsburg, Brooklyn open-mic scene, King broke out with her sassy \"Ex's and Oh's,\" which topped the Billboard Alternative charts nearly a year after its release off her early-2015 album, Love Stuff.\n\nWhy We Love Her: King is a bonafide fan of early female rock pioneers such as Wanda Jackson, with whom the 26-year-old newcomer recently had the chance to jam: \"She told me I need to act like a lady,\" King told Rolling Stone. \"She heard me doing a cover of hers, closed her eyes, and said that I sounded exactly like her.\"\n\nSound: Sizzling R&B with a burst of New Jack Swing-era Mary J. and vintage Brandy.\n\nBreakout Single: The former America's Got Talent alum's Cloud 19 mixtape got some attention, but her luminous video for the gritty \"FWU\"â€”not to mention her collaboration on \"The Way\" with Chance the Rapperâ€”made people sit up and take notice.\n\nWhy We Love Her: The Bay Area-bred singer is unequivocally proud of her sexuality: \"I'm not being [outspoken] to be different,\" she told Rolling Stone. \"I'm doing it because I genuinely have a message that needs to be told. I have young girls that are just like me, that have been through the same things that I have, and who need a voice.\"\n\nSound: Aggressive and confessional rap with killer pop hooks.\n\nBreakout Single: The South Side Chicago emcee has released five mixtapes to date â€“most notably last year's standout Winter Diary 2â€“but this year, after partnering with super-producer Timbaland, Tink dropped her most popular track yet: the four-on-the-floor \"Million.\"\n\nWhy We Love Her: She's equally beloved by hip-hop heads and indie snobsâ€“a widescreen fandom reflected in her choice of collaborators: Tink has worked with everyone from Rick Ross and Jay Z (\"Movin' Bass\") to Jeremih (\"Don't Tell Nobody\") and critical darlings Future Brown and Sleigh Bells.\n\nSound: Brash, no-apologies genre-destroyer with the cutting-edge sound of early MIA.\n\nBreakout Single: Signed to behemoth South Korean label YG Entertainment, she's the standout member of uber-famous K-Pop girl group 2NE1. And though CL is arguably one of the most famous international music stars, she's about to have her major moment Stateside with her kiss-off single, \"Hello Bitches.\"\n\nWhy We Love Her: She's the self-proclaimed \"Baddest Female\" and, to that end, she's not about to start limiting her potential. \"I don't actually like calling myself a rapper,\" CL told Rolling Stone. \"I'm more a performer. I don't like to box myself into anything, because I also sing and I love to dance; I do everything.\"\n\nSound: Playful pop music infused with a childlike giddiness and just a dash of hip-hop flair.\n\nBreakout Single: She first came to national attention by appearing on the third season of The Voiceâ€“she was on Team Adam and finished in sixth placeâ€“but Martinez's debut album, this year's Cry Baby, is her true statement of purpose. Stacked with sumptuous rhythms and smoky vocalsâ€“see her hot new single \"Soap\"â€”it's arguably the most considered, fully-developed pop album of the year.\n\nWhy We Love Her: While many performance artists have since downplayed the freak factor, Martinez isn't afraid to play the part: \"I've embraced it and taken on this character,\" she told Rolling Stone. \"The album is about half stuff that happened to me, and half whimsical fairytale.\"\n\nSound: No-frills, female-empowerment countryâ€“think early Dixie Chicksâ€“driven home by two of the most talented young voices in the genre (Tae Dye and Maddie Marlow).\n\nBreakout Single: The duo's debut single, \"Girl in a Country Song,\" not only hit number three on the Billboard Country chart, but also took dead aim at the bro-country objectification of women. The girls took home a CMA for the track's music video, which has been viewed over 29 million times on YouTube.\n\nWhy We Love Them: The tough-minded teens and longtime friends have a fire lit under their you-know-whats: \"Whenever we get to be creative, we get writing fever,\" Dye told Rolling Stone. \"With our songwriter brains, we are always thinking about writing.\""
