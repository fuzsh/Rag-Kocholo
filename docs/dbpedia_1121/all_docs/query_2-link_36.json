        "text": "Born on Vancouver Island, Toronto-based baritone Graham Robinson has established himself as a sought-after interpreter of song, oratorio, and opera from the baroque to the contemporary. Recent performances include Handel’s Messiah and J.S. Bach’s St. John Passion with the Cellar Singers, Corydon in Purcell’s The Fairy Queen with Confluence Concerts, and the Evangelist Quartet in Pärt’s Passio with The Elora Singers.\n\nGraham holds an undergraduate degree in music from the University of Victoria and a master’s degree in Vocal Pedagogy from the University of Toronto where he studied under Lorna MacDonald.

Graham is a founding member of both the Aspirare Vocal Collective and Toronto’s Trinity Bach Project.\n\nGraham keeps a private voice studio in Toronto’s downtown core where his pedagogical process focuses on singing as a narrative artform and utilizing the physiological mechanics of the human body to produce natural, uninhibited vocalization. His students have performed onstage at the Canadian Opera Company and been accepted into top tier post-secondary music programs.\n\nHailed in Opera News as possessing “one of the most beautiful lyric tenor instruments around,” Irish-Canadian tenor Michael Colvin has appeared to critical acclaim on opera and concert stages throughout Canada, the United States, the U.K., and Europe.
