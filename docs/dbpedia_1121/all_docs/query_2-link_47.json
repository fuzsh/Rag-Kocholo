        "text": "01 of 14\n\nRandy Jackson\n\nRandy Jackson started on American Idol in 2002 and was one of the original three judges on the panel. Known for his unique vocabulary and catchphrases on the show — \"it's a 'no' for me, dawg\" and \"pitchy\" — Jackson holds the record as the longest-serving judge in the show's history.\n\nPrior to hosting American Idol, he had a music career of his own, playing bass guitar as a sideman for the likes of Journey and Richard Marx while also serving as an A&R executive at Columbia Records and MCA Records.\n\nFollowing Idol, Jackson toured with Journey as bassist. He also made his Fox return for the network's reality reboot of Name That Tune in 2021, where he serves as the show's bandleader.\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Seasons 1–12\n\n02 of 14\n\nSimon Cowell\n\nSimon Cowell joined Jackson as one of the original three judges on the American Idol panel for its premiere in 2002. Despite his rather harsh and blunt critiques, Cowell was beloved and helped sculpt the careers of many who graced the stage — both on and off the show.\n\nBefore American Idol, Cowell saw success as an English record executive, producer and talent scout in the '80s and '90s. He also was part of the judging panel of British reality competitions Pop Idol and The X Factor UK.\n\nCowell continued his work in launching the careers of artists and bands, such as One Direction, Fifth Harmony and Leona Lewis, following his exit from Idol. He also has served as a judge on America's Got Talent since 2016.\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Seasons 1–9\n\n03 of 14\n\nPaula Abdul\n\nPaula Abdul completed the trio on the original American Idol judging panel, sitting alongside Cowell and Jackson. She was known for her sweet comments, in contrast to Cowell's often hard critiques.\n\nBefore joining American Idol, Abdul was a singer, dancer and performer known for choreographing music videos for Janet Jackson while topping Billboard Hot 100 charts with the 1988 hit singles \"Straight Up,\" \"Opposites Attract\" and \"Forever Your Girl,\" among others.\n\nAbdul continued her choreography career post-Idol while appearing as a judge on The X Factor, Live to Dance, So You Think You Can Dance and The Masked Dancer.\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Seasons 1–8\n\n04 of 14\n\nKara DioGuardi\n\nKara DioGuardi joined the American Idol judging panel as a fourth addition in 2009 for season 8. She opened up in her autobiography, A Helluva High Note, about her negative experiences on the show.\n\nBefore taking the judges' seat, DioGuardi was a successful singer, songwriter, producer and executive vice president of talent development at Warner Bros. Records.\n\nFollowing Idol, she continued her work in music production, expanding her song catalog to hundreds — while working with artists such as Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Clarkson and more.\n\nDioGuardi also made her Broadway debut in 2011, starring as Roxie Hart in Chicago.\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Seasons 8–9\n\n05 of 14\n\nEllen DeGeneres\n\nEllen DeGeneres joined the American Idol judging panel in 2010, replacing Abdul for the show's ninth season. A stand-up comic and host of her eponymous daytime talk show since 2003, DeGeneres brought that same comedic timing and humor to the judging panel. She was accompanied by DioGuardi as the second woman on the dais, alongside Jackson and Cowell.\n\nFollowing her one-season stint on Idol, she continued on as host of her eponymous daytime talk show since 2003, The Ellen DeGeneres Show — which wrapped its final episode in 2022 after a 19-season run.\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Season 9\n\n06 of 14\n\nSteven Tyler\n\nSteven Tyler joined the American Idol judging panel on season 10, replacing Cowell after his nine-season run. Known for his sense of humor and providing solid feedback, the newcomer sat alongside veteran Jackson.\n\nAs the frontman and lead singer of the Boston-based rock band Aerosmith, the multi-talented musician is also famous for his high-energy performances, onstage acrobatics and trademark scarves hanging from his microphone stand.\n\n\"Dream On\" and \"Sweet Emotion\" are among his catalog of chart-topping hits. Tyler and the band were set for a European tour in 2022 but canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Seasons 10–11\n\n07 of 14\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nJennifer Lopez joined Tyler as a newbie on the American Idol judging panel the same year. She stayed for two back-to-back seasons, took a hiatus and returned to the show for three more seasons to share her music knowledge with the contestants.\n\nBefore American Idol, Lopez had a string of success in rom-coms and other film genres, starring in Selena (1997), Out of Sight (1998), The Wedding Planner (2001), Enough (2002), Shall We Dance (2004), Monster-in-Law (2005) and more.\n\nShe is also known for her acclaimed music career, selling an estimated 80 million records worldwide as of September 2023, per Music Business Worldwide. The Grammy-nominated singer's smash singles include \"Let's Get Loud\" and \"Waiting for Tonight\" among others.\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Seasons 10–11, 13–15\n\n08 of 14\n\nMariah Carey\n\nMariah Carey stepped in for Tyler when he left on season 12, joining Jackson on the American Idol judging panel — alongside two additional newcomers, Keith Urban and Nicki Minaj, in 2012.\n\nHowever, Carey wasn't new to the singing competition, as she made a surprise appearance on the show on season 7 as a guest mentor for the contestants.\n\nCarey has had a wildly accomplished music career since her 1990 self-titled debut album. The multi-platinum recording artist, famous for her extensive vocal range and iconic holiday hit \"All I Want for Christmas Is You,\" has sold over 200 million albums, according to her official website.\n\nThe Grammy-winning singer-songwriter's most popular songs include \"Fantasy,\" \"Always Be My Baby\" and \"Vision of Love.\"\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Season 12\n\n09 of 14\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nMinaj joined Carey as a newcomer to the Idol judging panel for season 12, alongside Urban and Jackson. During her time on the show, she was known for giving contestants nicknames — \"Nicki Names\" — such as \"Finger Lickin' Good,\" \"Secret Squirrel\" and \"Joe Jumanji\" in an attempt to better remember their names.\n\nBefore joining the reality competition TV foray, the rapper released 2010's Pink Friday and 2012's Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded. The platinum-selling albums spawned hit singles such as \"Super Bass\" and \"Starships,\" among others.\n\nSince Idol, Minaj has continued to drop new music that has earned Grammy nominations, topped Billboard Hot 100 charts and collaborated with artists such as Ariana Grande, Katy Perry and Migos.\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Season 12\n\n10 of 14\n\nKeith Urban\n\nUrban completed the trio of new judges for season 12, alongside Jackson — who marked his final year on the American Idol panel after a 12-season-long run in 2013. Urban was known for his kind critiques and warm personality, providing expertise to the contestants who auditioned.\n\nNo stranger to singing competitions, Urban also sat on the judging panel for the Australian version of the reality singing show The Voice in 2011. He performed on Idol during the season 8 finale alongside that season's eventual winner, Kris Allen.\n\nFollowing his time as a judge on the show, the Grammy-winning artist jumped back into his successful career as a country musician. He returned to American Idol as a mentor for the season 21 finale in May 2023.\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Seasons 12–15\n\n11 of 14\n\nHarry Connick Jr.\n\nHarry Connick Jr. entered the show's competitive singing scene when he joined the American Idol judging panel alongside Urban and a returning Lopez for season 13. Though Connick Jr. had a sense of humor, his critiques sometimes came off a little harsh.\n\nHe previously served as a mentor on the show on season 9 before stepping into the judges' chair. Per Connick Jr's official website, the New Orleans-born crooner is credited for reviving the big band genre of music through his work in composing the soundtrack to the 1989 film When Harry Met Sally.\n\nIn addition to achieving success in both jazz and big band music, the Grammy winner has several acting credits, appearing on NBC's Will & Grace and in Copycat (1995), Independence Day (1996) and Hope Floats (1998), among others.\n\nFollowing his run on Idol, Connick Jr. signed on as producer and host of his eponymous talk show Harry on CBS in 2016 until its two-season run ended in 2018. He later played Daddy Warbucks in NBC's Annie Live! in 2021.\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Seasons 13–15\n\n12 of 14\n\nKaty Perry\n\nIn 2018, American Idol saw a completely new panel of judges — bringing in Perry, Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie. Perry has previously opened up about the process mirroring her own musical journey and inspiring her feedback during auditions and with hopeful contestants throughout the season.\n\nPerry served as a guest judge on season 9 and released hit songs such as \"I Kissed a Girl,\" \"Teenage Dream,\" \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\" before her judging debut. Shifting her focus back to music, Perry announced on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in February 2024 that she was leaving Idol and wouldn't be returning for season 23 in 2025.\n\n\"It's connected me with the heart of America, but I feel like I need to go out and feel that pulse to my own beat, you what I'm saying Jimmy?\" she told host Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nA few months later, the singer-songwriter released her empowering single, \"Woman's World,\" in July ahead of her forthcoming album 143 — set to drop in fall 2024.\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Seasons 16–22\n\n13 of 14\n\nLionel Richie\n\nRichie has been on the American Idol judging panel since his debut in 2018, delivering compassionate advice and feedback to the contestants.\n\nThe music legend rose to fame in the 1970s as the co-lead singer of the Commodores. Considered Motown royalty, he was a trailblazer in American soul and pop music alongside iconic artists such as Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross and Michael Jackson.\n\n\"Easy,\" \"Sail On,\" \"Three Times a Lady\" and \"Still\" are among the Grammy winner's hits. The 2024 Netflix documentary The Greatest Night in Pop showcased how Richie not only co-wrote \"We Are the World\" with Jackson but wrangled dozens of celebrities to record the mid-'80s anthem the same night he hosted the 1985 American Music Awards.\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Seasons 16–present\n\n14 of 14\n\nLuke Bryan\n\nBryan joined Perry and Richie on the American Idol judging panel on season 16. His friendly face and feedback have comforted the contestants over the years, and his fellow judges appear to enjoy his fun company.\n\nThe singer-songwriter had already made his mark in country music before joining the show, amassing 23 No. 1 hits and over 50 awards throughout his acclaimed career.\n\nAmong some of Bryan's top tracks across his studio albums are \"Country Girl (Shake It for Me),\" \"Drink a Beer\" and \"Drunk on You.\"\n\nAmerican Idol judge: Seasons 16–present"
