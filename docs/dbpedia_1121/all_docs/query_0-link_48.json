        "text": "Why is Scandinavia pop’s greatest construction line? Some say it’s because of a school system that actively encourages learning the craft of musicianship from a young age; others reckon that because winters are so long and dark, everyone spends ages indoors writing melancholy pop songs (even though, in Britain, that would just lead to endless Come Dine With Me marathons and games of Bananagrams). Some people say it’s the influence of Abba filtering down, perhaps via the drinking water. But that doesn’t explain the specific success of the female Scandinavian pop star, whose happy-sad, singalong pop bangers have been putting their male counterparts’ efforts to shame for decades. Sure there are some men – Erik Hassle, Eric Saade, Mavrick, the guy from A-ha – but look at the list of women making properly incredible and inventive pop music in recent years: Robyn, Lykke Li, Annie, Fever Ray, iamamiwhoami, Zhala, Tove Styrke, Tove Lo, Icona Pop, Mapei, Seinabo Sey, Elliphant, MØ – and that barely scratches the surface.\n\nThat is all very well, but what of the future? Is pop music likely to be dominated by effortlessly interesting and inexplicably cool Scandinavian women for the foreseeable future? Yes. Yes it is. And these are the best of the new crop.\n\nAwa\n\nThe Swedish version of The X Factor may have lasted for only one series (it was scrapped to make way for the returning Swedish Idol), but it lasted just long enough to discover – deep breath – 18-year-old Awa Matilda Isakine Santesson-Sey, AKA Awa. While her debut single Not Ready To Say Goodbye was a cute, PG-13 JoJo-esque R&B stomper, her summer single Obvious – with its percolating production, big soulful vocals and undercurrent of melancholy – utilises dance music’s current obsession with 90s house but bolts on a proper pop song.\n\nJi Nilsson\n\nToward the end of last year, Sweden’s blue-haired DIY-pop specialist Ji Nilsson got caught up in a blog storm involving Gwen Stefani, after fans helpfully pointed out the similarities between Nilsson’s Heartbreakfree and Stefani’s just-released and underappreciated comeback single Baby Don’t Lie, with Nilsson tweeting that she was happy the mild furore was at least exposing new people to her music. Taking fellow Swede’s jj’s template of minimal melancholia and bolstering the swirling melodies with hummable hooks, this year’s loved-up, OutKast-referencing Perfume was the summer anthem that never was.\n\nMarlene\n\nShe co-wrote Awa’s Obvious and collaborated with Nilsson on Love You Anyway, so Marlene seems to be the glue that holds this next wave of Scandi pop stars together. When she’s not helping out her mates, she’s making her own glistening, heart-bursting electropop, as showcased on last year’s excellent Indian Summer EP, which featured more ideas in five songs than most people can muster on a full-length album. One of those songs, I Do This For You, caught the attention of moustachioed living legend Giorgio Moroder, who reworked it for this year’s A-list-heavy album, Deja Vu.\n\nAlida\n\nWhen Norway’s Alida first arrived in 2013 with Feathers and Some of Us, she was a little too indebted to Scandipop’s modern-day deity, Robyn, occasionally forgetting to inject the crystalline production with some kind of emotional warmth. But her recent single When I Die – all strangely pitched vocals, odd time signatures and gloriously awkward metaphors (“Watering the weeds, what are you thinking?”) – feels much more representative of who she is, ie a more palatable iamamiwhoami. In fact, by the second, third and fourth listens the song’s strangely melancholic pull (the lyrical contents hinted at in the title) gets harder and harder to shake off.\n\nCilia\n\nThe beautiful thing about Swedish pop music in particular is how it never rests on its laurels. Take Cilia’s recent single Silhouettes in Slow Motion as an example; it starts with a minimal beat, suddenly goes a bit Ella Henderson circa Ghost, ushers in a beautiful chorus and, just when you think its brilliance has plateaued and we can all go home, a properly Swedish middle eight – one dripping in longing and on the brink of emotional exasperation – kicks in and the whole thing takes off again. It’s not even her best song, that honour going to Wilder Than the Wind, a song Leona Lewis would kill a horse for.\n\nDevon Seven\n\nWhile a lot of Scandinavian pop can often feel quite controlled and self-contained, there’s something almost menacing about the frayed double-time techno made by Denmark’s Devon Seven. Their dark breakup anthem The Real One – co-written by Paul de Homem-Christo, brother of Daft Punk’s Guy-Manuel, which recalls Zhala’s intoxicating debut album – feels slightly unhinged, as if it can’t quite work out what speed it should be played at or if it wants to kiss or kill you. That otherworldliness is also showcased in last year’s Where Light Shines Brighter, the video to which features a lot of strobe lighting, lungfuls of dry ice and some proper, Day-Glo-paint-on-the-face raving.\n\nMaja Francis\n\nWhile labelmate and fellow Swedish pop outsider Seinabo Sey underpins her music and visuals with darkness, Maja Francis’s aesthetic concerns itself more with oversized Day-Glo flowers, glittery far-off planets and a plethora of unicorns. But, as ever, there’s sadness bubbling beneath the surface, with her excellent debut single Last Days of Dancing focusing on not wanting to face the realities of growing up and trying to find one’s happy place. To hammer home the suspicion she might be someone who uses healing crystals, her newest single is called Space Invades My Mind. Of course it is.\n\nNoonie Bao\n\nHaving written songs with the likes of Charli XCX (the excellent Doing It), Carly Rae Jepsen (the excellent Run Away With Me) and Say Lou Lou (the excellent Games For Girls), the time feels right for the brilliantly named Noonie Bao to step into the spotlight with some excellent songs of her own. While her debut album, I Am Noonie Bao, had its moments, specifically Do You Still Care?, recent singles I’m In Love and the criminally catchy Pyramids (produced by Robyn collaborator Patrik Berger) showcase a bolder, more confident sound. She might need to start keeping those big bangers for herself in the future.\n\nRonya\n\nThe first example of Finnish pop star Ronya’s lyrical prowess came in the very first line of her debut single, Annoying, back in 2011. “Herpes and haemorrhoids, these are the things that you remind me of,” she mused, before adding: “You’re a pineapple in my yoo-hoo.” Lovely. Having taken a break from pop, however, she returned at the end of last year with the sophisticated R&B shuffle of Work Harder before following that up with August’s euphoric Great Escape, the video to which keeps some of that early rebellious spirit (she tries, and fails, to smash up a replica of the Mona Lisa).\n\nZara Larsson"
