        "text": "Paws up! ¡Dale!\n\nPitbull, the Miami-based rapper known as \"Mr. Worldwide\" and \"Mr. 305,\" signed a first-of-its-kind deal with Florida International for the naming rights of its football stadium Tuesday morning, August 6. The Panthers' field will be called Pitbull Stadium for at least the next five years. It's the first sports venue in the world named after a musical artist, according to the school.\n\nAs part of the $6 million deal, Pitbull's branded vodka also will be sold at the stadium, and as the \"Official Entrepreneur of FIU Athletics,\" he will write a new FIU anthem.\n\n“What we’re doing here is groundbreaking. We’re making history. This is history in the making,” Pitbull said at a ceremony on the campus Tuesday. “You’re going to see every other university wants to do the same thing. But the difference is we don’t do this for propaganda. We do it from the heart. We do it because it’s meaningful. We do it because I’m from the crib. I’m 305. This is my backyard.”\n\nHere's what to know about Pitbull and the FIU stadium deal:\n\nDetails of Pitbull-FIU stadium deal\n\nHere's what the agreement contains, according to ESPN:\n\nPitbull pays $1.2 million per year.\n\nPitbull gets naming rights to FIU football stadium through 2028 (with an option for Pitbull to renew the deal through 2033).\n\nPitbull's Voli 305 Vodka will be the preferred brand sold at the stadium.\n\nPitbull will get use of the stadium 10 days per year.\n\nPitbull gets two reserved suites for each home game.\n\nPitbull gets the title \"Official Entrepreneur of FIU Athletics.\"\n\nPitbull will write an anthem for FIU.\n\nWhat is Pitbull's name?

In fact, he didn't go to college at all, or even graduate from high school, the singer said at Tuesday's news conference. He did say he has ties to the school through “people that I love dearly.” He also emphasized that investing in education has become one of his passions.\n\nHow did Pitbull get famous?\n\nPitbull's first record deal came in 2001 when he signed with the company of Luther Campbell, founder of 2 Live Crew and one of the Miami Hurricanes' most famous boosters.

His concert tours and musical achievements are a big part of that, but Pitbull also has several endorsement deals and co-founded Bad Boy Latino records with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. He also was paid $1 million by Visit Florida in 2015 to promote the state.\n\nWhat are Pitbull's connections to sports?\n\nPitbull's music is ubiquitous across sports arenas and commercials. His song \"Timber\" featuring Kesha was used by ESPN throughout the 2014 NBA Playoffs, LeBron James' last season with the Miami Heat. He was also part of a group of singers featured in a Super Bowl commercial in 2020.\n\nPitbull also is co-owner of NASCAR team Trackhouse Racing and is scheduled to perform before the 2025 Daytona 500 (his 2024 pre-race concert was canceled because of rain).\n\nFIU stadium details, capacity, location\n\nPitbull Stadium, formerly known as FIU Stadium, has a capacity of about 20,000. It opened in 1995.\n\nThe stadium is located to the north of Tamiami Park south of the FIU campus in Miami. It's about 9 miles northwest of the University of Miami campus in Coral Gables, and about 26 miles southwest of Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, where the Miami Hurricanes and Miami Dolphins play their home football games.\n\nDoes FIU have Division I football? Is it FBS or FCS?\n\nFIU's first football season was in 2002, and it joined the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision in 2004.
