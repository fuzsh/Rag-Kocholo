        "text": "Our critics tip the biggest talents set to emerge this year in film, art, music, and the performing arts, including singer Laura Doggett, comedian Jonny Sweet, and actresses Alicia Vikander and Patsy Ferran\n\nEarnestly peachy face: Swedish actress Alicia Vikander (Picture: IBL/Rex)\n\nEvening Standard Critics9 January 2015\n\nMusic\n\nLaura Doggett\n\nHer first ever song was written for a cancer charity while she was doing her GCSEs, and six years later she’s soundtracking a murder. Laura Doggett’s music doesn’t shy away from the dark side — her low, powerful voice suits the shadows.\n\nThis week’s return of Broadchurch, ITV’s hit murder mystery series, has been using the Bath singer’s new single Old Faces on its trailer. “How does it feel when someone’s stripped you bare?” she sings over sparse piano chords while David Tennant and Olivia Colman look tense by the seaside. With an emotional chorus crashing in halfway, it sounds like she’s gunning for Adele’s audience already.\n\nIt’s been a rapid trajectory from edgier beginnings last summer, via an appearance as an unknown on Jools Holland and a tour supporting chart-topping soul man John Newman. Her introductory single, Phoenix, was produced by hip Vienna-based Londoner SOHN, who underpinned her smooth tones with skittering, restless electronics and created something extraordinary. Since then she’s been making tracks that are slightly less strange but still have that disorientating, middle-of-the-night feel, with Jamiroquai’s keyboard player Matt Johnson. Check their woozy single from last September, Moonshine.\n\nShe understands her power: “The first time I made someone cry with my music, it sounds a bit morbid but that just made me really realise that people wanted to listen to my voice,” she has said. Now it’s prominently positioned on a morbid crime drama, and can soon be heard first hand in an ideal space: the candlelit Jacobean theatre next door to Shakespeare’s Globe. The stage is set for a big year ahead.\n\nCheck her out: On January 19, at Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, SE1 (020 7401 9919, shakespearesglobe.com).\n\nOTHER ONES TO WATCH\n\nJames Bay\n\nThe BRITs Critics’ Choice winner is this year’s deadest of certs, with a weathered voice, chiselled looks and a selection of tearjerking arena-ready rock songs.\n\nSOAK\n\nSOAK — real name Bridie Monds-Watson — is just a cherubic-looking teenager, which makes her soft, gorgeous voice and sophisticated acoustic music all the more startling.\n\nDavid Smyth\n\nStars of 2015\n\nFilm\n\nAlicia Vikander\n\nAlicia Vikander is currently dating the actor Michael Fassbender. Which is not the most interesting thing about this 26-year-old Swede but is certainly going to make her earnestly peachy face even harder to avoid in 2015.\n\nVikander was already a star in Sweden when she was cast as confused Kitty, in Joe Wright’s Anna Karenina (she conveyed heart-break beautifully; we felt her shocked tears before they even reached her eyes). That performance helped get her the lead in Testament of Youth, an adaptation of Vera Brittain’s wrenching First World War memoir (released next Friday). As a pacifist facing the horrors of war, Vikander is required to be flinty as well as fragile. Again, she’s perfect.\n\nNext up is a starring role in Alex Garland's sci-fi thriller, Ex Machina. Vikander stars as a more than OK robot, alongside Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson. The trailer is most encouraging. In August, she can be also seen in Guy Ritchie’s The Man from U.N.C.L.E., as a British agent who likes cars (frankly, this part doesn’t sound too taxing).\n\nLast but not least, she’s the heroine in two movies that haven’t got release dates but are bound to be ginormous. The first is 17th-century romance Tulip Fever (written by Tom Stoppard and based on the Deborah Moggach novel), with Vikander as a married woman, in Amsterdam, who falls in love with an artist (Dane DeHaan). Then there’s The Light Between Oceans, about a woman and her husband (Fassbender), who raise a baby they find in a boat.\n\nBeing “hot” is a funny business. Right now, though, Vikander seems to have the situation well under control.\n\nCheck her out: Ex Machina opens on January 21\n\nOTHER ONES TO WATCH\n\nAlso coming to many cinemas near you: American actors Luke Grimes and Dakota Johnson, both in Fifty Shades of Grey. Twenty-five-year-old Johnson, who plays Anastasia, looks refreshingly down-to-earth but is actually Hollywood royalty, the daughter of Melanie Griffiths and Don Johnson. Grimes isn’t playing Christian Grey, but, guilty by association, is all but guaranteed to arouse pleasure.\n\nCharlotte O’Sullivan\n\nTheatre\n\nPatsy Ferran\n\nIt’s not often that an acting career is launched on the basis of a performer’s ability to carry a tray of drinks but this is what happened in the case of the terrifically talented Patsy Ferran. Appearing as a maid in a Rada production of High Society, she was spotted by an agent who thought she might be just what last year’s big-budget, Angela Lansbury-starring West End production of Blithe Spirit needed in the tray department. It turned out that she was and thus Ferran’s 2014 annus mirabilis started. “If I think about it too much, I’ll squeal,” she says happily.\n\nIf Blithe Spirit proved that Ferran, 25 (“but I look 14”), had a funny face, that most cherishable of gifts for an actor, her follow-up role, in James Graham’s political drama The Angry Brigade, showed that she could do passion. She needs this, in giant rum-sized bottles, for her current, towering part as Jim Hawkins in the National’s big-budget adaptation of Treasure Island.\n\nThe qualities she brings to the Olivier’s cavernous spaces are myriad: an alluring androgyny, a gift for suggesting thought and inner turmoil, as well as the sort of stage presence that makes you look at her even when she isn’t speaking. Maybe one day she’ll get to use her default language of Spanglish — her parents are Spanish and she was born there — professionally.\n\nCheck her out: Treasure Island runs until April 8 at the National Theatre, SE1 (020 7452 3000, nationaltheatre.org.uk)\n\nOTHER ONES TO WATCH\n\nAlistair McDowall\n\nPlaywright McDowall’s dystopian satire Pomona, at the Orange Tree, was the talking-point of the autumn theatre season. The 27-year-old is currently under commission to the Royal Court.\n\nMimi Ndiweni\n\nThe 23-year-old actress’s sparkling versatility across the RSC’s Midsummer Mischief festival was notable. America has spotted her talent too, and she features in the forthcoming Warner Brothers Tarzan film.\n\nFiona Mountford\n\nTerrifically talented: actress Patsy Ferran (Picture: Dan Wooller/Rex)\n\nRex\n\nSupreme elegance: artist Prem Sahib (Picture: Daniel Hambury)\n\nDaniel Hambury\n\nArt\n\nPrem Sahib\n\nAt first, Prem Sahib’s sculptures look like the height of minimal art: cool, precise, muted in colour. But it’s what they give up as you get close that makes him such an impressive artist.\n\nTake his installation at Frieze in 2013 — a white cube awkwardly sitting in the booth of his London gallery Southard Reid, from within which was pouring pumping dance music. The cube was made to the exact dimensions of his teenage bedroom: by combining the two elements, he triggered our imagination of the young artist, perhaps dreaming of nights out and all they can bring. He conjured, through minimal means, an entire world. Clubs loom large in Sahib’s world: along with fellow artists George Henry Longly and Eddie Peake, he runs the Anal House Meltdown night at Vogue Fabrics in Dalston. Peake and Sahib are recent graduates of the Royal Academy Schools, which have shaken off their fusty image to become London’s pre-eminent art school.\n\nThough Sahib’s work is essentially abstract, it always evokes the human body, often with erotic suggestions. He’s made mirror-like aluminium sheets which appear to be covered in sweaty condensation, again alluding to clubs or gym changing rooms, which are actually painstakingly created, bead by bead, with dots of resin. In other works, grids of tiles are pierced with constellations of fake diamond earrings.\n\nAnd the mood shifts: there’s humour, in a diffuser with protruding sticks containing not neroli or musk but the drug amyl nitrate; and pathos, in two blue discs on a white shelf, which mimic the dots found on a positive instant HIV test.\n\nIn referencing clubs, gyms, amyl nitrate and HIV, Sahib, 32, undoubtedly engages with queer culture. He says it’s part of exploring his own life rather than any overt political statement. Whatever, it’s all done with supreme elegance.\n\nCheck him out: His exhibition, Prem Sahib, is at the ICA, SW1 (ica.org.uk, 020 7930 3647), Sept 15-Nov 15\n\nOTHER ONES TO WATCH\n\nYuri Pattison\n\nOne quarter of the post-internet collective Lucky PDF, who’s making a big splash on his own. He creates strange, immersive online art and installations, reflecting and questioning digital and geopolitical issues. Has just taken on the Chisenhale Gallery/Create residency for 2014-16.\n\nMary Ramsden\n\nAnother Royal Academy Schools graduate, Ramsden’s an abstract painter for the digital age, her small but intense paintings are informed by the computer screen as much as the human figure and especially the textiles which clothe the body. She has a show at Pilar Corrias, W1, opening on January 23.\n\nBen Luke\n\nComedy\n\nJonny Sweet\n\nBrace yourselves for plenty of Sweet Smell of Success headlines — if there’s any justice, 2015 will see Jonny Sweet stepping into the limelight that he really should be basking in by now.\n\nThe Nottingham-born comedian was a member of the Cambridge Footlights with Simon Bird and Joe Thomas, and if his audition for one of the main roles in The Inbetweeners had worked out better he might now be a box office darling like them. Instead, the boyish 29-year-old is carving out a distinctive niche for himself as an eccentric posh bumbler on screen and in his live performances. Imagine a cross between a young Hugh Grant and idiosyncratic stand-up poet Tim Key.\n\nSweet reunited with Bird and Thomas for Sky 1’s Great War sitcom, Chickens, in 2013 and was most recently seen acting against type as police officer Tom Oliver in Channel 4’s Babylon. The big news, however, is that he is now due to star in his own self-penned sitcom, Together, based on his Radio 4 cult hit, Hard to Tell.\n\nSweet plays neurotic but nice Tom, who is trying to make his new relationship work despite the obstacles life lobs at him. If the radio series is any guide it will be an inventive, original take on the romcom format and it should finally put Sweet centre stage where he belongs.\n\nCheck him out: Together will be broadcast on BBC3 in the summer.\n\nOTHER ONES TO WATCH\n\nJavone Prince\n\nThis familiar TV comedy face is best known as wisecracking wannabe gangster Jerwayne in E4’s hit Phoneshop and is now developing his own BBC2 sketch series, The Javone Prince Show.\n\nAngela Barnes\n\nThe nurse-turned-stand up from Maidstone has quickly made a splash with her engaging stories of dating difficulties and her colourful family and could be dubbed the southern Sarah Millican. Her last live show was inspired by her father, who used to run a sex shop.\n\nBruce Dessau\n\nEccentric posh bumbler: comedian Jonny Sweet (Picture: Daniel Hambury)\n\nDaniel Hambury\n\nDance\n\nFrancesca Hayward\n\nShe’s already been tagged the next great British ballerina, so the pressure is on for Francesca Hayward, the 22-year-old from Sussex who joined the Royal Ballet in 2011 and is quickly rising through the ranks. She’s officially a soloist but is already dancing principal roles. Her performance in Frederick Ashton’s Rhapsody last February had critics rhapsodising about her poise, radiance and technical aptitude. She’s a natural in Ashton’s light, precise, breezily elegant “English style”, part of the core legacy of the Royal Ballet.\n\nHayward followed up Rhapsody with a star turn in Manon last Autumn, as the epoymous lead, a tragic heroine. In an emotionally exhausting role she proved not only a ravishing dancer but an intelligent one too, strong in her interpretation of a complex character.\n\nShe is up for two National Dance Awards on January 26, for Emerging Artist and Outstanding Performance (in Rhapsody). One way and another, 2015 is her year.\n\nCheck her out: On January 10 & 15 she leads the way down the rabbit hole in Christopher Wheeldon’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland at the Royal Opera House, WC2 (020 7304 4000, roh.org.uk)\n\nAakash Odedra\n\nAs a British Asian mixing Indian classical and contemporary dance, he’s bound to be labelled the new Akram Khan (whoops, we just did it) but his lean, animated style is all his own. He’s premiering new material at the Royal Opera House’s Linbury Studio on January 23-24.\n\nAjani Johnson-Goffe\n\nLyndsey Winship\n\nRead More\n\n50 awesome things to do in London in 2015\n\nStars of 2015: the hottest actors, singers, artists and performers to watch this year\n\nFay Maschler picks the best new London restaurants opening in 2015\n\nThe best films released in cinemas in early 2015\n\nBook now: six top London theatre shows to see in 2015\n\n5 hot London gigs to book for in early 2015\n\n5 unmissable London art exhibitions opening in early 2015\n\nCreate a FREE account to continue reading\n\nRegistration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.\n\nJoin our community where you can: comment on stories; sign up to newsletters; enter competitions and access content on our app.\n\n* FIRST NAME\n\n* LAST NAME\n\n* EMAIL\n\nYour email address\n\n* PASSWORD\n\nMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a number\n\n* YEAR OF BIRTH\n\nYou must be at least 18 years old to create an account\n\n* Required fields\n\nI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from Evening Standard.
