She was born on December 13, 1989 in Reading, Pennsylvania. With her musical journey starting at a young age, she moved to Nashville at the age of fourteen to pursue a career in country music and quickly gained attention for her talent. Swift's debut album Taylor Swift was released under Big Machine Records in 2006 when she was just sixteen years old. The album stirred up the music industry with its hit single \"Our Song\", making Swift the youngest person ever to write and perform a number-one song on Hot Country Songs chart. Her subsequent albums such as Fearless, Speak Now, and Red further cemented her status as a powerful voice within both country and pop genres. Particularly notable is her transition from country to mainstream pop with the release of 1989 which won three Grammy Awards including Album of the Year. Beyond music, Taylor Swift has also made significant contributions through philanthropic work focusing on disaster relief funds, education initiatives and support for arts education. In addition to this work off-stage, she is known for fostering close relationships with fans through social media platforms and surprise Secret Sessions prior to album releases. All these elements combined have shaped Taylor Swift into not just an artist but also an influential figure whose impact extends beyond music alone.\n\nAriana Grande, born Ariana Grande-Butera on June 26, 1993 in Boca Raton, Florida, is a celebrated American singer and actress. Her career started when she was cast as Cat Valentine on the Nickelodeon television series Victorious which ran from 2010 to 2013. This role provided her with an opportunity to showcase her talents and led to a spin-off show called Sam & Cat. However, it wasn't until she ventured into music that her fame skyrocketed. Grande's debut album Yours Truly, released in 2013 under Republic Records, went straight to number one on the US Billboard charts. The lead single from this album The Way became a top ten hit and set the tone for what would become an immensely successful career in pop music. She followed up with equally successful albums like My Everything (2014), Dangerous Woman (2016), Sweetener (2018) and Thank U Next (2019). Each of these albums solidified her status as one of pop's leading ladies due to their commercial success and critical acclaim. Despite being primarily known for her music career today, Grande has never abandoned acting entirely. Throughout the years she has made guest appearances on various TV shows including Scream Queens and had supporting roles in movies such as Zoolander 2. She has also been recognized with numerous awards including Grammy Awards, Brit Awards, and Billboard Music Awards making Ariana Grande an influential figure within both the music industry and pop culture as a whole.\n\nBillie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell (born December 18, 2001) is an American singer and songwriter.

Commercially successful, it reached the top 15 of record charts in numerous countries, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nDua Lipa (born August 22, 1995) is an English singer, songwriter, and model.
