        "text": "You better stop, better run away\n\nYou better listen to what I have to say\n\nI’ll keep you hanging on the line\n\nWith just one kiss I will blow your mind\n\nIt seemed so innocent back then, fun – exciting.\n\nLong before we’d become heartily sick of the World’s Smuggest Man, Simon Cowell, long before a generation of girl groups began slavishly following the Girls Aloud template to chart success, there was Bardot.\n\nIt’s hard to believe now, but when the first series of Australian Popstars featuring Bardot exploded across our scenes in early 2000 – and brought with it all the attendant hyperbole and controversy (did Chantelle really get thrown off the series for stealing from her fellow housemates?) – even Big Brother didn’t exist.\n\nIn many ways, Bardot – Chantelle Barry (soon replaced by Newcastle singer Tiffani Wood), Belinda Chapple, Sophie Monk, Sally Polihronas and Katie Underwood – were the start of the reality TV craze. If the Aussies hadn’t proven themselves so enthusiastic about the private lives of a bunch of women being moulded into future chart stars, then Idol, and X Factor, and Talent, and Kelly Clarkson, and all the rest of them might never have existed. Not bad for a one-off Channel Seven series aimed at under-12 girls (presumably the same girls who were considered the core Spice Girls audience).\n\nThe individual “personalities” were in place the moment the group had been formed. As Chapple told me at the time, Katie is “kooky”, Sally is “maternal”, Sophie is “very genuine”, Chantelle is “very quiet”, and “I’m hyper-active.” Kooky Bardot, Maternal Bardot, Genuine Bardot, Quiet Bardot and Hyper-Active Bardot. Hmm. Needs work, doesn’t it?\n\nYes, there had been one series of Popstars before: in New Zealand, where the charming multicultural TrueBliss emerged winners – but it was the runaway success of Bardot here in Australia (where Popstars even trumped Friends to reach the coveted most watched TV program spot) that proved the franchise had staying power. As of date, the format has been sold to more than 50 countries.\n\nThe song that took Bardot to the top – Poison – is a cracker. Owing more than a little to the Spice Girls formula of a few years earlier (in particular, the sensual slide and give-and-take of Say You’ll Be There), the mood of the lyrics is unapologetically assertive, warning off unfaithful suitors. There’s something about it too – maybe its sinuous grace, maybe the stutter and teasing hidden menace of the percussion – that somehow recalls INXS’s finer chart forays. Maybe it’s the women’s alluring confidence as they slink and sashay their way in and out of sight.\n\nThe members of Bardot sing their lines separately before joining together and intertwining on the chorus in true Spice Girls fashion. And they prove their vocal chops – at one point Underwood manages to fit in eight separate notes as she rolls her tongue around the word “blind”.\n\nThen there’s the ironic framing of the video itself: Bardot, portrayed as manufactured plastic dolls, in their own tiny rooms, being manipulated by an outside producer (rather like ‘N Sync’s Bye Bye Bye) – meanwhile in “real life” they were manufactured plastic singers, being manipulated by show producers.\n\n(And did the producers really intend for Underwood to be pictured pissing on her robot dog in that infamous press shot?)\n\nGirls Aloud may well have influenced everyone that came after, but the creation of Bardot directly inspired the creation of Girls Aloud (series two winners, 2002, ITV’s Popstars: The Rivals).\n\nReportedly, Bardot generated $30m from merchandise, records and concerts during their first six months. Once the 13-part TV series finished, however – and Seven stopped promoting the group – the bubble soon deflated. Bardot’s self-titled album and Poison may have entered the ARIA charts at #1, but the second single (I Should’ve Never Let You Go – released in the final week of Popstars) and third failed to live up to expectations.\n\nBy 2002 – following a second album that may or may not have been killer: no one heard it so it’s a moot point – the group had split. After two-and-a-half years, everyone had already forgotten them.\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nChantelle Barry is an actress and in 2008 played Naomi Clark’s mate in 90210, Nina.\n\nMost recently, Belinda Chapple directed the short-lived Sydney After Dark – a glitzy celebration of Australian culture and nightlife – in Las Vegas.\n\nKatie Underwood went through the obligatory celeb “my drug hell” year, and formed a corporate events and wedding band.\n\nSophie Monk is currently a co-host on 2DayFM’s Breakfast Show.\n\nUntil recently Sally Polihronas worked at Freemantle Media as a director and producer."
