It was always snowing at Christmas…”\n\nStep in from the cold and join us as we sprinkle some seasonal magic with our family-friendly concert of Christmas music and story-telling.\n\nAt the heart of the evening is a performance of Dylan Thomas’s delightful homage to the Christmases of his childhood, by Welsh actor Richard Harrington (Poldark, Hinterland, Lark Rise to Candleford). This enchanting prose poem, full of fun and memories, is illustrated with carols and seasonal music for brass and choir."
