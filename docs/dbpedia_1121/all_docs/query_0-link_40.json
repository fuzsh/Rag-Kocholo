        "text": "Pop radio is a funny thing. Sometimes great songs never amass the airplay one would expect, the best recent example being Carley Rae Jepsen’s not-much-of-a-comeback single “I Really Like You.” Other times (and far too often), a terribly mediocre track inexplicably tops the charts. And then, there’s the occasional odd duck such as Tove Lo’s “Habits,” a sublime tune that went largely ignored by American radio upon release in 2013, but somehow gained traction over a year later, ultimately peaking at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn the current pop landscape of bland songs and grating celebrity personalities, Tove Lo is a breath of fresh air. On the heels of her successful second single “Talking Body,” Tove Lo has mostly dodged the one-hit-wonder designation, but let’s hope she has a bit more staying power left in her. Thanks to Katy Perry, the pop music formula du jour has relied on forgettable verses framing an anthemic, shouted chorus. How refreshing, then, that Tove Lo writes honestly catchy songs without solely relying on stadium-stomping choruses to dig into your brain.\n\nTove Lo’s charm lies not only in her songs, but also in her approach to pop culture. Taylor Swift can try to convince us she’s a geeky outsider all she wants, but no one’s buying it anymore (we’ve seen you hanging out with Beyonce and Jay-Z, Tay Tay). Tove Lo may not be a stranger to the industry, but she doesn’t pretend to be. Standout track “Moments” begins “Grew up with a lot of green / nice things ‘round me / I was safe, I was fine”. It’s an almost disarmingly candid admission in a world that favors started-from-the-bottom narratives (no matter how contrived). Tove Lo’s honesty is one of the most endearing characteristics of her debut album Queen of the Clouds, as she recounts both the highs and lows (way lows) of a relationship. Poetry? Not quite. Relatable? Yup.\n\nBetter yet, Tove Lo is inclusive without pandering to audiences. Her latest video for “Time Bomb” depicts labile relationships between both gay and straight couples. It’s an earnest, thoughtful video that incorporates the LGBT community without clawing for the attention of young gay men (*cough* Lady Gaga *cough*). Further, her songs can be uplifting without resorting to the ingratiating preachiness of someone like Meghan Trainor.\n\nWith Tove Lo, we have a pop star who encompasses the allure of early Britney, the unabashed sentimentality of Robyn, and the songwriting chops of Sia. Her music is brazenly radio-friendly pop, and it’s commendable that she has yet to bring in any hip electronic artists for production work. Arca is great and all, but I’m not hoping to see his name on the liner notes of Tove Lo’s next album. On the aftermentioned “Moments,” Tove Lo sings “On good days I am charming as fuck”. That you are, Tove Lo.\n\nhttp://www.tove-lo.com/\n\nFollow Robert on Twitter"
