I was in a really, really different mental place.\"\n\nSabrina admitted to feeling lost amid her heartbreak, and it took her some time to recover from the setback.\n\nThe 'Almost Love' hitmaker - who is currently dating actor Barry Keoghan - said: \"Those instincts, like the trust in yourself, just the ability to move throughout a room without questioning if other people's opinions are more important than your own ... and it just comes with time and it comes with ease.\""
