Have an account? .\n\nMany singers have changed their names to break into the music industry.\n\nYou may not be familiar with how they ended up with their current monikers.\n\nLizzo and Miley's professional names are based off of nicknames. Others changed their birth names.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLady Gaga — Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta\n\nIn the October 2013 issue of Elle magazine the singer said she changed her name because Stefani is \"a perpetually tortured artist\" that she can't be in public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBad Bunny — Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio\n\nThe Puerto Rican singer told E! News in 2020 his stage name came from a childhood photo of himself wearing a bunny costume.\n\n\"I was so mad. That was Easter day in the school and the teacher picked me to dress up,\" he said.\n\nIn March 2023, he told James Corden during a Carpool Karaoke session that when he started out he wanted to hide his identity.\n\n\"I wanted to use like a bunny mask,\" the \"Titi Me Pregunto\" singer said. \"I never wanted to be so famous but then I just went with the flow.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B. — Belcalis Almanzar\n\nIn 2016, the singer tweeted that people called her Bacardi growing up because her sister's name is Hennessy.\n\n\"It was my Instagram name, Bacardi, Bacardi B.,\" the singer told Jimmy Fallon in 2017. She eventually shortened it.\n\n\"But for some reason, my Instagram kept getting deleted, and you know what, I think it was Bacardi that had something to do with it,\" she added. \"So I just shortened it to Cardi B.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLil Nas X — Montero Lamar Hill\n\n\"It's been my internet alias for a minute,\" said the artist in a 2019 interview with Beats 1, according to HotNewHipHop.com.\n\n\"The X wasn't included at first. It was just Lil Nas,\" he continued. \"It was Lil Nas because when I first started rapping I wasn't as serious so it was like, 'Okay, every rapper's name is starting with Lil lately.' So I kind of got stuck with it.\"\n\nHe said he added the \"X\" when he was more serious.\n\n\"It would stand for the amount of years, I felt, until I'm at the status where I'm considered legendary,\" said the rapper of the meaning behind the \"X.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalsey — Ashley Frangipane\n\n\"I didn't like being Ashley Frangipane,\" Halsey told Rolling Stone in 2016. \"It was a person I thought was weak and silly and sad.\"\n\nHalsey is an anagram of her first name. She came up with the name after seeing a subway stop in Brooklyn for Halsey Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Weeknd — Abel Makkonen Tesfaye\n\nMakkonen is The Weeknd's father's name, who, according to Rolling Stone, left when he was just 1 or 2 years old.\n\nIn a 2016 Reddit AMA, the singer said he disliked his name, and, after dropping out of school, and leaving home one weekend, he tried out the moniker.\n\n\"It sounded cool. I took out the 'e' because there was already a Canadian band named the weekend (copyright issues),\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharli XCX — Charlotte Emma Aitchison\n\nNo, the \"XCX\" aren't Roman numerals for 10,110. The British musician, born in 1992, told the Today show her stage name was born from an instant messenger handle.\n\n\"'Charli XCX' was actually my MSN screen name,\" the singer said in 2015. \"When it came 'round to thinking of an artist name, I was just really lazy, [and thought] 'I'll just use my online screen name.' And it kind of stuck.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Derulo — Jason Desrouleaux\n\nThe Haitian-American's last name is a phonetic spelling of his birth name, Desrouleaux. In 2018, the singer told Elvis Duran he believes he'll eventually just go by his last name.\n\n\"It's inevitable,\" said Derulo. \"It's all about when it's gonna happen. I think it's actually happening naturally. People will just call me Derulo, but it's kind of been through my entire life.\"\n\nDerulo mentioned by his senior year in high school that everyone was calling him by his last name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiley Cyrus — Destiny Hope Cyrus\n\nCyrus' father Billy Ray gave her the nickname \"Smiley\" to match her cheery persona.\n\nOver the years, the nickname became shortened to Miley. Cyrus legally changed her name in 2008.\n\nDrake — Aubrey Drake Graham\n\nWhen he played wheelchair-bound Jimmy Brooks on the Canadian TV show \"Degrassi,\" the actor went by the name Aubrey Graham. But when the Toronto native switched his career focus to rapping in 2009 after signing a recording contract with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment, he started using one name only: Drake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLizzo — Melissa Jefferson\n\nJefferson's nickname came after she formed a rap group with two classmates at age 14.\n\nAccording to an interview with The Cut, her friends shortened her first name to give her the nickname Lissa, but then changed it to Lizzo because Jay-Z's \"Izzo\" was \"popular at the time.\"\n\nRead more: 5 things you didn't know about Lizzo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlo Rida — Tramar Lacel Dillard\n\nThe rapper and songwriter was encouraged to come up with a new stage name after a friend told him he needed something better than Ruckus Pimp.
