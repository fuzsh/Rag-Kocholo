        "text": "SmarTone Telecommunications has named Tam Lok-man Norman (pictured) as executive director and deputy chief executive officer of the company with effect from 15 November 2021. Tam will report to Fung Yuk-lun Allen, executive director and deputy chairman of the board.\n\nWith a strong track record in growing and expanding businesses with focus in the technology and Internet space, Tam will provide the leadership required to take the company and its subsidiaries to an accelerated pace of expansion, in the age of 5G and beyond.\n\nTam is currently a vice president of Tencent Cloud International, vice president of JOOX Music, and the chief executive of WeChat Pay Hong Kong. He is a seasoned entrepreneur and executive with twenty-plus years of experience in product development, operation management, and startup investment in the Internet and technology sector.\n\nSince joining Tencent in 2010, Tam has been developing the international business of various areas including social networks, online advertising, digital payment, online entertainment and cloud computing. He has also been active in driving both B2B and B2C businesses expansion covering enterprises and mass consumers in his scope of responsibilities. Prior to his current employment, Tam has worked at two international investment banks and co-founded two Internet startups on education and gaming.\n\nAccording to a statement by the company, Tam is entitled to a projected cash emolument of HK$7.5 million per annum and a one-off compensation of HK$4.0 million, payable by two equal instalments in 2022 and 2023 for his loss of certain benefits from his current employment. He will also be granted share options to subscribe for 4,000,000 shares in the company under the terms of, and subject to required approval pursuant to, the share option scheme of the Company.\n\nFor the role as a director of the company, Tam will retire and be eligible for re-election at the next general meeting of the Company after his appointment. Tam will be entitled to a director's fee which is currently HK$144,000 per annum and is determined by the board under the authority granted by shareholders at annual general meetings.\n\nIn recent times, SmarTone has been actively pushing its 5G network. The brand recently launched a new TVC featuring actor Nick Cheung to showcase the capability of its 5G network.\n\nCheung, who has been a SmarTone customer for more than 20 years, stars in the TVC Trust the Best. The video starts with people suffering from slow speed internet connection due to a poor mobile network. Symbolising the 5G network of SmarTone, Cheung appears in the scenes, and with a flick of magic, he leverages the company's newly launched 5G MAX technology to bring forward the brand's 5G internet experience to everyone, telling the strengths of SmarTone’s 5G network coverage, real-time AI technology and Ericsson’s spectrum sharing that enables sharing of spectrum between 4G and 5G and more efficient use of its existing spectrum.\n\nPrior to that, it aired another TVC to celebrate the launch of its new 5G service and collaboration with foodpanda Hong Kong, featuring actor Sam Lee and her three-year-old daughter and baby influencer Lucy. The TVC portrays Lucy as an alien to help her father get rid of the landlines in traditional home broadband services as sharing home broadband among multiple devices may slow down internet speed. Lucy also tells the competitive price of SmarTone's latest 5G private broadband service.\n\nStrengthen your omnichannel marketing capabilities today with MARKETING-INTERACTIVE's Omnichannel Marketing Asia on 23 November.
