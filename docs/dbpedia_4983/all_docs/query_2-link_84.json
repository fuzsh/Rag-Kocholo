PPS Merchant Code Table\n\nMany Hong Kong merchants accept both PPS and FPS. FPS (Faster Payment System) lets you pay merchants and individuals with just an email address, FPS ID or mobile phone number. As FPS is widely used in Hong Kong nowadays, many organizations and merchants also allow payment by FPS.\n\nRegister for online payments through FPS via your online banking service to make payments online up to your own bankâ€™s daily limit. No need to find a PPS registration terminal - you can do it all from the comfort of home.\n\nEven better - no matter if you are living in Hong Kong or overseas you can use Wise FPS payments to send HKD easily. Cover any HKD bills you may have - and send money to friends and family, too - quickly and easily with Wise."
