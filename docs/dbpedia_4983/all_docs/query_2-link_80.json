        "text": "\"Our 5G network completely covers Hong Kong's major ports and provides an uninterrupted high-speed and smooth 5G network experience for busy inbound and outbound traffic,\" SmarTone said in a press release.\n\nThe first phase of the 5G network upgrade project at Hong Kong International Airport has been completed, including the departures and arrivals halls, baggage reclaim halls, and restricted areas. With the upgraded 5G network in place, both arriving and departing customers can easily connect to various intelligent facilities throughout the airport and enjoy smooth 5G network experiences.\n\nSmarTone has pioneered full 5G network coverage across the entire territory. Hong Kong's transportation hubs have been covered, including all 23 road tunnels, major routes, and MTR stations. By deploying the exclusive 850MHz frequency band within MTR stations, SmarTone significantly increased 5G network capacity. Thus, customers will have a high-quality, fast, and stable network experience on the go, even during peak hours.\n\nSmarTone will continue to expand its network coverage and improve network performance, with the goal of providing the most advanced network infrastructure to customers and Hong Kong, while also leading the development of Hong Kong's smart city initiatives."
