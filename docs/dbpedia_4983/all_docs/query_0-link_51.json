        "text": "With local listing activity having ground to a halt, this is likely to be one of Hong Kong's most keenly watched flotations of the year.\n\nBut the deal could be a hard sell amid a tough market environment.\n\nHutchison Telecom (Hong Kong), the mobile service run by HTIL, operates both 2G and 3G services, the latter under the brand-name '3'. The company won a high-profile contract to sell Apple's iPhone in Hong Kong last year.\n\nHowever, analysts said the operations had little room for growth in the city's saturated mobile and fixed-line telephony markets.\n\n'The fixed-line business in Hong Kong is a steadily declining market. The mobile side of the business is very saturated,' CLSA analyst Elinor Leung said.\n\nMs Leung estimated the fixed-line and mobile businesses together had an enterprise value of between HK$10 billion and HK$12 billion.\n\nHutchison Global Communications is the fixed-line business. The unit was taken private three years ago when minority shareholders were bought out for HK$2.4 billion.\n\nHong Kong is one of the most crowded and competitive mobile-telephone markets in the world. There are five mobile operators in the city sharing 11.48 million users, the Office of the Telecommunications Authority said. This represents 1.6 mobile phones for each resident.\n\nNet profit at SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings, one of Hong Kong's biggest mobile operators, plunged 68 per cent in the six months to December from a year earlier. SmarTone's management cited deteriorating market conditions.\n\nSome investors and bankers speculate that Mr Li wants to cash out of Hong Kong's mature telephony market and spend the money on cheap communications assets across Asia.\n\n'The spin-off could help HTIL realise the valuation of the Hong Kong business. I do think they would like to cash out [through the share offering] and then reinvest in the region, as everything is selling cheap in the market,' said Winson Fong, the managing director of SG Asset Management (Hong Kong).\n\nA local investment banker added: 'Assets are very cheap right now. So I would not take these spin-offs as evidence Hutchison needs more money to fund its own operations. The company is very well funded.'\n\nMr Li's approach to cashing out of Hong Kong's tough telecommunications market is markedly different from that of his son Richard Li Tzar-kai, the chairman of local telecommunications firm PCCW.\n\nThe younger Mr Li wants to take his business private so he can restructure it away from the public glare and potentially sell it to trade or private equity buyers when the local economy improves and company valuations are higher.\n\nRichard Li and China Unicom Group have offered HK$15.9 billion to minority shareholders in the buyout proposal. The scheme is hanging in the balance after a court challenge by the Securities and Futures Commission on allegations of improper share transfers.\n\nIt is uncertain how Li Ka-shing and Goldman Sachs will try to sell the Hong Kong telecommunications assets to the public. They could offer a high dividend.\n\nThe units have stable cash flows, but being very mature, they do not need to set a lot of money aside to invest in future growth.\n\nThis could make them a neat portfolio replacement for retail investors who are disappointed at the PCCW buyout. Many PCCW minority investors bought shares in Hong Kong Telecom - before that was taken over by Richard Li in 2000 - for its high and stable dividend.\n\nHTIL owns 100 per cent of the Hong Kong fixed-line business through HGC and operates the mobile business through Hutchison Telecom, with more than 2 million subscribers.\n\nIt announces its annual results on Wednesday, where it could also confirm the share-offer plans."
