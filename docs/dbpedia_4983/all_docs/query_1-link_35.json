        "text": "It is not uncommon to see companies perform well in the years after insiders buy shares. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So before you buy or sell SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings Limited (HKG:315), you may well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nWhat Is Insider Selling?\n\nIt is perfectly legal for company insiders, including board members, to buy and sell stock in a company. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.\n\nWe don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own companyâ€™s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'.\n\nSee our latest analysis for SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Chairman Ping-luen Kwok bought HK$460k worth of shares at a price of HK$9.13 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being HK$6.14). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. Ping-luen Kwok was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.\n\nYou can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nInsider Ownership of SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Our data suggests SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings insiders own 0.5% of the company, worth about HK$35m. We prefer to see high levels of insider ownership.\n\nSo What Do The SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nThe fact that there have been no SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Overall we don't see anything to make us think SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. Of course, the future is what matters most. So if you are interested in SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings, you should check out this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions."
