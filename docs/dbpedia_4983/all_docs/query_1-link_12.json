        "text": "What is the current Smartone Telecommunications Holdings market capitalization?\n\nThe current market capitalization of Smartone Telecommunications Holdings is 4.15 B HKD.\n\nWhat is market capitalization?\n\nThe market capitalization (German: Marktkapitalisierung, English: market capitalization, abbreviated as market cap, also known as stock exchange capitalization or market value) is the calculated total value of all shares of a publicly traded company like Smartone Telecommunications Holdings.\n\nHow has the market capitalization of Smartone Telecommunications Holdings developed in recent years?\n\nThe market capitalization of Smartone Telecommunications Holdings has increased/decreased by -14.63% compared to the previous year.\n\nWhat does market capitalization mean for investors?\n\nThe market capitalization of a company reflects the current market consensus on the value of the equity of a publicly traded company.\n\nWhy is market capitalization an important indicator for investors?\n\nThe market capitalization of a company reflects the current market consensus on the value of a publicly traded company's equity. It is determined by the supply and demand for the company's shares. Market capitalization is thus significantly influenced by expectations in the stock market regarding the future earnings power of the company, and as such, it can undergo significant fluctuations.\n\nWhy does the market capitalization fluctuate?\n\nThe market capitalization fluctuates along with the stock price, as the market capitalization is calculated based on the current price and the number of outstanding shares.\n\nWhat role does market capitalization play in the valuation of Smartone Telecommunications Holdings?\n\nIn order to compare the value of companies, it is helpful to consider not only the market capitalization but also the net debt of a company. A potential buyer of the entire company would also acquire the debts of the company. The enterprise value is the total value of a company or a stock corporation. The net financial indebtedness of the company is added to the market capitalization.\n\nDoes the market capitalization influence the performance of Smartone Telecommunications Holdings?\n\nThere is no verifiable long-term evidence or study that stocks with a specific market capitalization (whether Mega/Large/Mid/Small Cap) would consistently yield significantly higher returns than others. There are occasional small studies (few stocks, short investment period) suggesting that certain classes may perform better or have higher risk, but none of them are 1. conclusive (cause-effect relationship is unclear, experiment is not repeatable) or 2. generalizable (generalization is not possible due to small sample size and time period).\n\nDoes the market capitalization of Smartone Telecommunications Holdings have an influence on indices?\n\nSome stock indices use market capitalization as index weighting. Stocks with a higher market capitalization are also weighted higher in the index. This is in contrast to equally weighted indices (all stocks have the same weighting) and free float weighted indices (market capitalization weighting, but only with the number of shares in free float).\n\nHow much dividend does Smartone Telecommunications Holdings pay?\n\nOver the past 12 months, Smartone Telecommunications Holdings paid a dividend of 0.32 HKD . This corresponds to a dividend yield of about 8.53 %. For the coming 12 months, Smartone Telecommunications Holdings is expected to pay a dividend of 0.33 HKD.\n\nWhat is the dividend yield of Smartone Telecommunications Holdings?\n\nThe current dividend yield of Smartone Telecommunications Holdings is 8.53 %.\n\nWhen does Smartone Telecommunications Holdings pay dividends?\n\nSmartone Telecommunications Holdings pays a quarterly dividend. This is distributed in the months of December, April, December, April.\n\nHow secure is the dividend of Smartone Telecommunications Holdings?\n\nSmartone Telecommunications Holdings paid dividends every year for the past 23 years.\n\nWhat is the dividend of Smartone Telecommunications Holdings?\n\nFor the upcoming 12 months, dividends amounting to 0.33 HKD are expected. This corresponds to a dividend yield of 8.68 %.\n\nIn which sector is Smartone Telecommunications Holdings located?\n\nSmartone Telecommunications Holdings is assigned to the 'Communication' sector.\n\nWann musste ich die Aktien von Smartone Telecommunications Holdings kaufen, um die vorherige Dividende zu erhalten?\n\nTo receive the latest dividend of Smartone Telecommunications Holdings from 3/18/2024 amounting to 0.145 HKD, you needed to have the stock in your portfolio before the ex-date on 3/5/2024.\n\nWhen did Smartone Telecommunications Holdings pay the last dividend?\n\nThe last dividend was paid out on 3/18/2024.\n\nWhat was the dividend of Smartone Telecommunications Holdings in the year 2023?\n\nIn the year 2023, Smartone Telecommunications Holdings distributed 0.3 HKD as dividends."
