        "text": "Hong Kong’s SmarTone partners with Ding to add international top-up to its My SIM Account App.\n\nAs Ding continues to expand globally we’re delighted to welcome new DingConnect partner SmarTone! The company is a leading telecommunications provider with subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Macau, offering voice, multimedia and mobile broadband services, as well as fixed fibre broadband services.\n\nUsing DingConnect global airtime API, SmarTone is adding international mobile top-up to its product offering through the MySim Account App. This means SmarTone customers will be able to send international mobile top-up to family and friends back home in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, directly from their MySim Account App. The partnership gives SmarTone’s customer access to Ding’s network of 550+ mobile operators, covering 95% of the population.\n\nCommenting on the new partnership, Muhannad Hassan, Ding’s General Manager for Asia and the Middle East said: “This new partnership further strengthens Ding’s business in Asia and expands the services which are available to the foreign worker population who are supporting family back home.”\n\nHe added: “The transfer of airtime or data is a meaningful gift, particularly at this time when people are trying to stay connected to their families. We look forward to working with SmarTone to make it easier for their customers to stay connected.”\n\nThis new partnership will enable a wide range of expats living in Hong Kong to send the gift of international airtime to family and friends. In the Philippines for example, some 96% of mobiles phones are of the prepaid variety, with half out of credit at any one time, so there is a significant need to keep these phones topped-up with airtime and data.\n\nSmarTone CEO Anna Yip commented: “Service excellence has always been our forte in setting us apart from our competition. At SmarTone, we strive to provide customers with an optimal user experience – adding Ding to our App will allow us to offer our customers even more.\n\nAdding: “By partnering with Ding we will be able to provide our users with a simple, safe and secure way to send mobile airtime top-up back home and help them connect with their loved ones in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia”.\n\n– Ends –\n\nAbout SmarTone: SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings Limited (0315.HK) is a leading 5G telecommunications company with operating subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Macau, providing voice, multimedia and mobile broadband services, as well as fixed fibre broadband services for the consumer and corporate markets. Its goal is to deliver unbeatable and valuable experiences to customers through its powerful network, purposeful apps and passionate service. The company has been listed in Hong Kong since 1996.
