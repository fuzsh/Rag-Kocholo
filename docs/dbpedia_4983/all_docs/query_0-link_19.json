        "text": "For the past six years, SmarTone has had exclusive access to the UK-based Vodafone brand in Hong Kong. \"Although the marketing cooperation with Vodafone has been valuable to both parties over the years, our interests have diverged for some while and, after extended discussions, we agreed it best for each to pursue its own course,\" SmarTone CEO Douglas Li said in a statement.\n\nVodafone Asia-Pacific's regional brand and partner manager Dare Koslow told Campaign the SmarTone-Vodafone relationship was reassessed as part of Vodafone's \"regular review\" of its partners. He confirmed that Vodafone is in discussions with other parties to continue its presence in Hong Kong and in Asia.\n\nIn context, Singapore's M1 will also officially end its partner network agreement with Vodafone on 31 December. M1 spokesperson Petrina Teoh said their agreement no longer generated sufficient benefits for M1, given its costs.\n\nSmarTone-Vodafone subscribers were told they would not be affected as mobile and broadband services will continue unchanged and all agreements remain valid. SmarTone said it will continue to follow its strategy of \"creating and delivering differentiated service and product propositions\".\n\nKoslow clarified that there would be no impact on neither Vodafone’s marketing budget nor staff count in Hong Kong, but SmarTone media representatives did not manage to comment in time before Campaign's press deadline.\n\nFrom a branding point of view, Stefan Fillip, senior partner and head of Asia for Lippincott, said that Smartone on its own would be \"in a tough spot as the Smartone brand doesn't have much brand equity left\" since (the partnership) was dominated by the Vodafone brand and \"most people probably forgot what Smartone used to stand for as a brand\".\n\nLilian Leong, managing director of Leo Burnett Hong Kong chimed in to add the SmarTone-Vodafone brand positioning has been augmented to communicate attributes of being international and inspiring over the years, but the breakup raises questions about SmarTone's marketing direction in future. \"SmarTone is in an identity crisis now; it should revamp its whole brand image,\" she said.\n\nNotably, SmarTone-Vodafone, while they were still an item, is not a 4G licensee but is instead aimimg at launching LTE using re-farmed spectrum including the 1800MHz band.\n\nFillip continued that the spilt has more negative implications for SmarTone than for Vodafone. \"There is certainly a need for re-building that brand. Vodafone is a globally well respected brand, SmarTone isn't,\" he said."
