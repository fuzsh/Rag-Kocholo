        "text": "Cisco earnings, Ackman stake in Nike: Market Domination Overtime\n\nOn today's edition of Market Domination Overtime, Hosts Josh Schafer and Julie Hyman analyze the market close and cover some of the biggest stories from the trading day. Stock market averages (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) held on to Wednesday's gains and closed in the green after July's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report indicated easing inflation. Tim Murray, T. Rowe Price Capital Markets strategist of the Multi-Asset division, notes that markets showed little reaction to the CPI data, given its alignment with forecasts. However, he highlights a shift in focus, highlighting that \"worries have moved towards the labor market,\" though enough data will be available before the Fed meeting to assess labor market health. Cisco Systems (CSCO) reported fiscal fourth quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Adjusted earnings of $0.87 per share came in better than the expected $0.85. Revenue of $13.64 billion also topped the Bloomberg estimate of $13.53 billion. Morningstar Equity Analyst William Kerwin characterizes Cisco Systems' earnings results as \"generally positive,\" highlighting that the company's fiscal 2025 guidance suggests a return to growth, which he views as \"positive.\" Addressing the recently announced job cuts, Kerwin says he's \"not overly concerned with it,\" interpreting the move as a sign of the company's focus on profitability. July's Consumer Price Index (CPI) saw the cost of shelter increase 0.4% in the month. Meanwhile, mortgage applications surged 16.8% last week from 6.9% the week prior. Mphasis Digital Risk founder and managing director Jeff Taylor explains, \"What we saw in the refinance market was the biggest one-week jump in almost two years. And if we look at the broader [mortgage] rate market right now, we're down a full point to 6.5%, down from a high in April of 2024. And as the Fed has talked about over the course of the last couple of weeks, we're looking at potentially one to two rate cuts this year, maybe September, maybe December, maybe a total of 75 basis points.\" Shares of Nike (NKE) are rallying in after-hours trading following news that billionaire investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management has taken a new stake in the athletic apparel giant. A 13-F filing revealed that Pershing Square has acquired approximately 3 million shares, valued at around $229 million. Finally, Josh Schafer and Julie Hyman break down what to watch on Thursday, August 15, from Walmart earnings to the latest reading on mortgage rates. This post was written by Melanie Riehl\n\nMars, Kellanova deal 'makes a ton of sense': Analyst\n\nMars has announced plans to acquire Kellanova (K) in a $36 billion deal. Peter Galbo, BofA Securities senior food & beverage analyst joins Market Domination to discuss his outlook on the snack and beverage sector in light of this acquisition. Galbo believes that the deal \"makes a ton of sense\" for both companies. He describes it as \"a white space opportunity\" for Mars, which is primarily known for sweet snacks. This acquisition adds a salty component to their portfolio, allowing them to \"cover the waterfront in terms of snacking\" and become a more \"global competitor\" with increased scale. Addressing the consumer slowdown, Galbo acknowledges, \"It's been a pretty challenging calendar 2Q for a lot of the snack companies.\" However, he highlights that Kellanova \"was probably the one that stood out in a positive light,\" demonstrating continued volume growth amid sluggish customer interactions in the snack sector. Regarding investment opportunities within the snacking industry, Galbo highlights McCormick (MKC) as an attractive option for investors.
