Your assets are an investment and they are expected to last, so your tracking device.\n\nSmartOne Solar Alerts & Notifications\n\nThe SmartOne Solar uses motion sensors, comparative GPS positions, as well as custom configured sensors to acquire and transfer information to the GlobalStar satellite network.
