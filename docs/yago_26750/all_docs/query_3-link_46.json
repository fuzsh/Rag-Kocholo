        "text": "The empress and queen Maria Theresa Habsburg-Lorraine (May 13th, 1917-November 29th, 1780) bore sixteen children in the marriage with the emperor Franz I Stepha and was famous as \"mother-in-law of Europe\". Her brother Leopold died immediately after he was born, her sister Amalia died in the cradle and Maria Ana died of perinatal complications at the birth of a dead infant in 1744. The famous hereditary facial dysmorphia of the \"Hasburg jawe\" wasn't noticed in Maria Theresa's surviving children. In October of 1738, after giving birth to her daughter Ana, a manual lysis of the placenta was performed due to the retained placenta and postpartal bleeding. In 1741 her daughter Carolina died, and in 1767 her daughter Josepha died of small pox. Her daughter Elizabeth remained deformed by the pock marks, and Maria Christina got a puerperal sepsis, but surprisingly, didn't die. Maria Antoinette ended under a guillotine in France, along with her husband Luis XVI. Maria Theresa's father, Karl VI died of the cholecystopankreatitis and peritonitis, and her husband and co-ruler most probably died of acute coronary incident in August 18th, 1765. After her husband's death she started suffering from depression with steady necrophile obsessions. Maria Theresa suffered from a chronical obstructional pulmonary disease (asthma), rehumatic syndromes, hypertension and anxiodepressive syndromes. In 1767 she had small pox. In November 11th 1780 she caught a cold which grew into a pneumonia with high fever. She died of cardiopulmonal dedompensation preceded by pneumonia and asthma."
