        "text": "MARRIAGE OF THE KING OF\n\nSPAIN.\n\nOur London telegrams announced the\n\nmarriage of King Alfonso of Spain to\n\nthe Austrian Archduchess Marie Chris-\n\ntine Henrietta Desirdo, daughter of an\n\nuncle of the present Emperor by his mar-\n\nriage with a Princess Palatine of Hun-\n\ngary. The young Archduchess was born\n\nin 1858, and is consequently now of full\n\nage. She lost her father six years ago.\n\nHer mother, the Archduchess Elizabeth\n\nFrancoise Marie, was born January 17th,\n\n1831, and was a widow of the Archduke\n\nFerdinand Victor, of Este, when she mar-\n\nried the Archduke Charles Ferdinand, of\n\nHapsburg, on April 18th, 1854. Of this\n\nmarriage were issue four children, still\n\nliving. In direct descent the father of\n\nthe future Queen of Spain was a grandson\n\nof the Emperor Leopold of Aus-\n\ntria, who married the Infanta\n\nMaria Luisa, daughter of the most\n\nfamed of the Bourbon Kings, Charles III.\n\nThe Archduchess had entered one of the\n\norders of Chanoinesses, which exist in\n\nPrague for ladies of noble birth, and she\n\nis abhbes of her chapter, though not bound\n\nto remain in the order for life, no vows\n\nbeing required in these lay establishments.\n\nWithin their walls, in both Austria and\n\nGermany, the daughters of noble families\n\nlead a life of quiet and agreeable seclu-\n\nsion, returning to society when they\n\nchoose, and free to marry as they like.\n\nEach lady in the house of Prague enjoyed\n\nan income of twelve hundred marks a\n\nyear, and the Archduchess possessed\n\nabout fifteen thousand. It was in this\n\npeaceful existence, apart from the gay\n\ncapital of Austria, and away from the\n\nbrilliant Court of the Hapsburgs, that\n\nthe Princess was one day startled with\n\nthe intelligence that the Ministers of King\n\nAlfonso had cast their eyes on her as the\n\nsuccessor to Queen Mercedes. It seems\n\nthat when the Archduchess got the first\n\nintimation she was very irresolute, as it\n\ncame soon after the whole of Europe had\n\nbeen touched and painfully interested by\n\nthe untimely and premature death of\n\nQueen Mercedes, but her scruples were\n\novercome.\n\nThe Times of Sept. 3 says:-The young\n\nKing of Spain, who some eighteen months\n\nago, became a widower by the sad death\n\nof Queen Mercedes, to whom he was\n\nwarmly attached, and very lately lost a\n\nbeloved sister, is obliged, by reasons of\n\nState and the wishes of his subjects, to\n\nseek a new alliance. It is not too late,\n\nfor he is yet barely twenty-two years of\n\nage. For some months it has been ex-\n\npected, if not actually arranged, that the\n\nArchduchess Marie Christine of Austria,\n\ncousin of the Emperor, was to be the\n\nobject of his choice. That young lady\n\nand her mrother have been staying amid\n\nthe pine forests of Arcachon, a remote\n\nFrench watering-place near Bordeaux.\n\nKing Alfonso soon appeared on the scene,\n\nand created much perturbation among tIhe\n\ngrandees whom Spanish etiquette brought\n\nin his train, by carrying on his courtship\n\nin the most natural fashion, and pro-\n\nlonging his stay--which was barely a\n\nweek-beyond the allotted time. It\n\nseems that the amiable Archduchess, on\n\nher return by way of Paris, has found\n\ngreat favour with tho ex-Queen Isabella,\n\nwho promises--if permitted, which is\n\ndoubtful--to come to her son's second\n\nwedding."
