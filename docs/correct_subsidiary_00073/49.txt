Use of any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below: GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 1. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 2. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 3. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 1. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 2. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 3. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Use of any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below: THE OPEN GROUP PUBLIC LICENSE MOTIF GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE SOFTWARE THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS THE OPEN GROUP PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 1. DEFINITIONS "Contribution" means: 1. in the case of The Open Group, L.L.C. ("The Open Group"), the Original Program, and 2. in the case of each Contributor, i. changes to the Program, and ii. additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: i. are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, even if the separate modules are linked in binary form to the Program, and ii. are not derivative works of the Program. "Contributor" means The Open Group and any other entity that distributes the Program. "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. "Open Source" programs mean software for which the source code is available without confidential or trade secret restrictions and for which the source code and object code are available for distribution without license charges. "Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by The Open Group, including source code, object code and documentation, if any. "Program" means the Original Program and Contributions. "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS The rights granted under this license are limited solely to distribution and sublicensing of the Contribution(s) on, with, or for operating systems which are themselves Open Source programs. Contact The Open Group for a license allowing distribution and sublicensing of the Original Program on, with, or for operating systems which are not Open Source programs. 1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. 2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the limitations of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 3. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. 4. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 3. REQUIREMENTS A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and b. its license agreement: i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and iv. states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. When the Program is made available in source code form: a. it must be made available under this Agreement; and b. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program: Copyright (c) {date here}, The Open Group Ltd. and others. All Rights Reserved. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, subject to the limitations provided in Section 2, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a. promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b. allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defence and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation or other similar official proceedings to enforce patent rights against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such non-compliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. The Open Group may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than The Open Group has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. %%The following software may be included in this product: JACL/TCL.

Use of any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below: UNICODE 2.1 CHARACTER DATABASE Copyright (c) 1991-1998 Unicode, Inc. All Rights reserved. DISCLAIMER The Unicode Character Database "UNIDAT21.TXT" is provided as-is by Unicode, Inc. (The Unicode Consortium). No claims are made as to fitness for any particular purpose. No warranties of any kind are expressed or implied. The recipient agrees to determine applicability of information provided. If this file has been purchased on magnetic or optical media from Unicode, Inc., the sole remedy for any claim will be exchange of defective media within 90 days of receipt. This disclaimer is applicable for all other data files accompanying the Unicode Character Database, some of which have been compiled by the Unicode Consortium, and some of which have been supplied by other vendors. LIMITATIONS ON RIGHTS TO REDISTRIBUTE THIS DATA Recipient is granted the right to make copies in any form for internal distribution and to freely use the information supplied in the creation of products supporting the Unicode (TM) Standard. This file can be redistributed to third parties or other organizations (whether for profit or not) as long as this notice and the disclaimer notice are retained. EXPLANATORY INFORMATION The Unicode Character Database defines the default Unicode character properties, and internal mappings. Particular implementations may choose to override the properties and mappings that are not normative. If that is done, it is up to the implementer to establish a protocol to convey that information. For more information about character properties and mappings, see "The Unicode Standard, Worldwide Character Encoding, Version 2.0", published by Addison-Wesley. For information about other data files accompanying the Unicode Character Database, see the section of the Unicode Standard they were extracted from, or the explanatory readme files and/or header sections with those files. The Unicode Character Database has been updated to reflect Version 2.1 of the Unicode Standard, with two additional characters added to those published in Version 2.0: U+20AC EURO SIGN U+FFFC OBJECT REPLACEMENT CHARACTER A number of corrections have also been made to case mappings or other errors in the database noted since the publication of Version 2.0. And a few normative bidirectional properties have been modified to reflect decisions of the Unicode Technical Committee. The Unicode Character Database is a plain ASCII text file consisting of lines containing fields terminated by semicolons. Each line represents the data for one encoded character in the Unicode Standard, Version 2.1. Every encoded character has a data entry, with the exception of certain special ranges, as detailed below. There are five special ranges of characters that are represented only by their start and end characters, since the properties in the file are uniform, except for code values (which are all sequential and assigned). The names of CJK ideograph characters and Hangul syllable characters are algorithmically derivable. (See the Unicode Standard for more information). Surrogate characters and private use characters have no names. The exact ranges represented by start and end characters are: The CJK Ideographs Area (U+4E00 - U+9FFF) The Hangul Syllables Area (U+AC00 - U+D7A3) The Surrogates Area (U+D800 - U+DFFF) The Private Use Area (U+E000 - U+F8FF) CJK Compatibility Ideographs (U+F900 - U+FAFF) The following table describes the format and meaning of each field in a data entry in the Unicode Character Database. Fields which contain normative information are so indicated. Field Explanation ----- ----------- 0 Code value in 4-digit hexadecimal format. This field is normative. 1 Unicode 2.1 Character Name. These names match exactly the names published in Chapter 7 of the Unicode Standard, Version 2.0, except for the two additional characters. This field is normative. 2 General Category. This is a useful breakdown into various "character types" which can be used as a default categorization in implementations. Some of the values are normative, and some are informative. See below for a brief explanation. 3 Canonical Combining Classes. The classes used for the Canonical Ordering Algorithm in the Unicode Standard. These classes are also printed in Chapter 4 of the Unicode Standard. This field is normative. See below for a brief explanation. 4 Bidirectional Category. See the list below for an explanation of the abbreviations used in this field. These are the categories required by the Bidirectional Behavior Algorithm in the Unicode Standard. These categories are summarized in Chapter 4 of the Unicode Standard. This field is normative. 5 Character Decomposition. In the Unicode Standard, not all of the decompositions are full decompositions. Recursive application of look-up for decompositions will, in all cases, lead to a maximal decomposition. The decompositions match exactly the decompositions published with the character names in Chapter 7 of the Unicode Standard. This field is normative. 6 Decimal digit value. This is a numeric field. If the character has the decimal digit property, as specified in Chapter 4 of the Unicode Standard, the value of that digit is represented with an integer value in this field. This field is normative. 7 Digit value. This is a numeric field. If the character represents a digit, not necessarily a decimal digit, the value is here. This covers digits which do not form decimal radix forms, such as the compatibility superscript digits. This field is informative. 8 Numeric value. This is a numeric field. If the character has the numeric property, as specified in Chapter 4 of the Unicode Standard, the value of that character is represented with an integer or rational number in this field. This includes fractions as, e.g., "1/5" for U+2155 VULGAR FRACTION ONE FIFTH. Also included are numerical values for compatibility characters such as circled numbers. This field is normative. 9 If the characters has been identified as a "mirrored" character in bidirectional text, this field has the value "Y"; otherwise "N". The list of mirrored characters is also printed in Chapter 4 of the Unicode Standard. This field is normative. 10 Unicode 1.0 Name. This is the old name as published in Unicode 1.0. This name is only provided when it is significantly different from the Unicode 2.1 name for the character. This field is informative. 11 10646 Comment field. This field is informative. 12 Upper case equivalent mapping. If a character is part of an alphabet with case distinctions, and has an upper case equivalent, then the upper case equivalent is in this field. See the explanation below on case distinctions. These mappings are always one-to-one, not one-to-many or many-to-one. This field is informative. 13 Lower case equivalent mapping. Similar to 12. This field is informative. 14 Title case equivalent mapping. Similar to 12. This field is informative. GENERAL CATEGORY The values in this field are abbreviations for the following. Some of the values are normative, and some are informative. For more information, see the Unicode Standard. Note: the standard does not assign information to control characters (except for TAB in the Bidirectonal Algorithm). Implementations will generally also assign categories to certain control characters, notably CR and LF, according to platform conventions. Normative Mn = Mark, Non-Spacing Mc = Mark, Spacing Combining Me = Mark, Enclosing Nd = Number, Decimal Digit Nl = Number, Letter No = Number, Other Zs = Separator, Space Zl = Separator, Line Zp = Separator, Paragraph Cc = Other, Control Cf = Other, Format Cs = Other, Surrogate Co = Other, Private Use Cn = Other, Not Assigned Informative Lu = Letter, Uppercase Ll = Letter, Lowercase Lt = Letter, Titlecase Lm = Letter, Modifier Lo = Letter, Other Pc = Punctuation, Connector Pd = Punctuation, Dash Ps = Punctuation, Open Pe = Punctuation, Close Po = Punctuation, Other Sm = Symbol, Math Sc = Symbol, Currency Sk = Symbol, Modifier So = Symbol, Other BIDIRECTIONAL PROPERTIES Please refer to the Unicode Standard for an explanation of the algorithm for Bidirectional Behavior and an explanation of the sigificance of these categories. These values are normative. Strong types: L Left-Right; Most alphabetic, syllabic, and logographic characters (e.g., CJK ideographs) R Right-Left; Arabic, Hebrew, and punctuation specific to those scripts Weak types: EN European Number ES European Number Separator ET European Number Terminator AN Arabic Number CS Common Number Separator Separators: B Block Separator S Segment Separator Neutrals: WS Whitespace ON Other Neutrals ; All other characters: punctuation, symbols CHARACTER DECOMPOSITION TAGS The decomposition is a normative property of a character. The tags supplied with certain decompositions generally indicate formatting information. Where no such tag is given, the decomposition is designated as canonical. Conversely, the presence of a formatting tag also indicates that the decomposition is a compatibility decomposition and not a canonical decomposition. In the absence of other formatting information in a compatibility decomposition, the tag is used to distinguish it from canonical decompositions. In some instances a canonical decomposition or a compatibility decomposition may consist of a single character. For a canonical decomposition, this indicates that the character is a canonical equivalent of another single character. For a compatibility decomposition, this indicates that the character is a compatibility equivalent of another single character. The compatibility formatting tags used are: A font variant (e.g. a blackletter form). A no-break version of a space or hyphen. An initial presentation form (Arabic). A medial presentation form (Arabic). A final presentation form (Arabic). An isolated presentation form (Arabic). An encircled form. A superscript form. A subscript form. A vertical layout presentation form. A wide (or zenkaku) compatibility character. A narrow (or hankaku) compatibility character. A small variant form (CNS compatibility). A CJK squared font variant. A vulgar fraction form. Otherwise unspecified compatibility character.
