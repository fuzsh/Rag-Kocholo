        "text": "Space restrictions simply do not permit me to go into the depth of detail I would like on every company that participated in the early days of the CAD industry nor cover numerous in-house systems developed at major automobile and aerospace companies. Readers will have to be satisfied with the brief descriptions included in this chapter and even then, I have only been able to cover what I consider to be the companies that had the biggest impact. There are hundreds if not thousands of companies that at one time marketed engineering design software. Some of the companies described in this chapter offered just software while other provided both hardware and software. While many have changed names, I have decided to list them alphabetically based upon the name they are best been known by along with earlier and subsequent name changes.\n\nAdra Systems (Matrix One)\n\nAdra Systems was founded in Lowell, Massachusetts in July 1983 by William Mason, who had been at Applicon from 1973 to 1983, most recently as vice president of operations, James Stenzel, who had been vice president of engineering at Hastech, Inc., and Peter Stoupas, who had earlier been a regional sales manager at Adage and had also worked for Applicon. Mason became the president and CEO, Stenzel the vice president of product development and Stoupas the vice president of marketing. Between 1983 and 1986, the company raised $11.6 million of venture funding from a number of firms including American Research & Development, the company that also provided the initial funding for Digital Equipment Corporation.\n\nAdraâs initial product, introduced in January 1985, was a CADAM-compatible combination of hardware and software that was marketed by Adage, Inc as the CADStation 2/50. At the time, Adage was one of the major non-IBM manufacturers of graphic terminals used to support the mainframe CADAM software sold by IBM. The software component, which was called Cadra-1, emulated the look and feel of CADAM. It could extract a drawing from a mainframe database, work on the drawing and then refile it on the mainframe.\n\nCADAM, Inc. did not take kindly to this product introduction since it competed directly with the sale of CADAM. A lawsuit was filed against both Adage and Adra which settled out of court in 1987. CADAM, Inc. received a payment âin excess of one million dollarsâ and Adage agreed to no longer sell the CADStation 2/50 once its existing inventory was depleted.[1]\n\nThe company introduced the Adra 1000 system in November 1985. Similar to the CADStation 2/50, it consisted of a 10-MHz Motorola 68010 microprocessor with 2.5MB of main memory, UNIX, a custom graphics processor and a 19-inch 1024Ã1024 monochromatic or color monitor. No local hard disk was provided. Graphics performance, particularly pan and zoom operations, was very fast. The major difference from the earlier system was that the Adra 1000 with its Cadra-2 software was intended to be used as a standalone two-dimensional drafting system. The initial price for a basic system was $15,750.\n\nA year later, Adra Systems introduced the Adra 3000, similar to the 1000 except with a Motorola 68020 microprocessor, a higher performance graphics accelerator, better communication capabilities and an optional 20MB disk drive. With the companyâs Cadra-2 software, the Adra 3000 could be used as an adjunct to a CADAM system or as a low-cost alternative. These systems started at $14,750 for the monochromatic version and $18,750 for the color system. Meanwhile, the price of the Adra 1000 was dropped to $11,750.\n\nIn August 1988, Adra introduced a PC-based system called Acclaim. The key element was an external co-processor that included the companyâs bit-sliced graphics processor and 4MB of memory. The Cadra software actually ran in this co-processor which plugged into one of the PCâs parallel ports. The software and co-processor sold for $10, 795 while a complete system including a 16-MHz 386 PC and 19-inch monitor was priced at $21,190.\n\nEventually, Adra got out of the hardware end of the business and concentrated on the Cadra software. It positioned itself as providing a low-cost alternative to the large enterprise-type systems sold by Computervision, IBM Applicon, etc. The company stressed Cadraâs ease of use and the userâs ability to customize the software using a programming tool called âAutogeometry.â This latter software was also used to interface Cadra to systems other than CADAM. Both PCs and UNIX workstations were supported.\n\nBy 1996, the company had installed about 17,000 copies of its software at 1,500 to 1,600 customers. Adra offered a number of different packages at this point. Cadra Design Drafting was the companyâs flagship product. Selling for $3,995, it was no longer simply a CADAM clone. Adra had added many of its own concepts including intelligent dimensioning, variational and parametric editing, unlimited drawing size (this was one of the major limitations of CADAM), display of up to 200 views and license management that allowed copies of the software to be shared over a local network.\n\nThe software was available on most UNIX platforms as well as on Windows. To make the transition to Windows less painful for existing users, the company left the older user interface in the software and the user could select either the Windows paradigm or the older interface.\n\nAdra also developed a solids modeling package, Cadra Solids, based on the DesignBase geometric kernel from Ricoh Corporation. This was a hybrid modeler that allowed users to mix wireframe, surface and solid geometry. While other low-cost packages tended to use faceted surface geometry, Cadra Solids used precise B-REP techniques. Editing was done by grabbing a vertex, edge or surface with a mouse click and dragging it to a new location. The user could also directly modify a model by editing its history tree. Initially, Cadra Solids, which was only available on UNIX workstations, sold for $5,995, the same as the UNIX version of the basic Cadra package. Combined, the two packages cost $10,995. Several years later this price was down to $6,500 which was still nearly twice what SolidWorks sold for at the time. Adra also offered NC software as well as a package for electrical control and power system.\n\nIn 1992, Adra established a new operation in Shelton, Connecticut to develop product data management (PDM) software. This group, initially called the âLooking Glass Projectâ and subsequently the Matrix Division, was headed by Joseph Pieto who had previously developed IGOR[2], a document management package, at the Sikorsky Division of United Technology. The company introduced this software as a PDM product called Matrix. It used a relatively new object-oriented database, Objectivity DB from Objectivity, Inc. The system had impressive capabilities but like many other early objectoriented systems, suffered performance issues when it was scaled up to handle a large volume of data.\n\nLike Cadra, Matrix had an easy-to-use user interface, good document routing capabilities, a distributed database that eliminated the need for a centralized server and the ability to manage a wide range of documents. Mark OâConnell joined Adra as vice president of marketing in 1995. He had previously held a series of financial and marketing management jobs at Digital Equipment Corporation. OâConnell became president of Adra in 1996 and CEO in 1997.\n\nWithin a few years, the tail began to wag the dog. In an interview in 1996, Mason stated that the portion of the companyâs business represented by Matrix had gone from 15 percent in 1995 to 33 percent in 1996 and would be 50 percent in 1997. Eventually, he thought it would become 80 percent of Adraâs business.[3] It actually became 100 percent in 1998 when in May of that year Adra sold the design and manufacturing software portion of Adra Systems to SofTech for $11.4 million. At the time the Cadra product line was generating about $15 million in annual revenues while Matrix was responsible for $21 million.\n\nThe company used these funds to shift its PDM business into high gear. It changed its name to MatrixOne and the product became eMatrix to reflect its Internet focus. Sales increased to nearly $75 million in fiscal 2000 (the companyâs fiscal year ended July 1) and the company went public on March 6, 2000, selling 6.2 million shares at $25 per share. Almost immediately, the price increased to over $70.\n\nThe next year revenues nearly doubled to $145 million, resulting in profits of $8.8 million. This was the companyâs peak year. Revenue dropped over the next several years to $109 million in fiscal 2003 and 2004 and the company incurred substantial losses before heading back into the black in late 2004. By October 2002, the companyâs stock had lost over 95 percent of its value from its earlier high and only improved moderately over the next few years. On March 2, 2006, Dassault SystÃ¨mes announced that it was acquiring MatrixOne for $7.25 per share (approximately $408 million) or about 3.3 times revenue. The acquisition was completed on May 11, 2006 and MatrixOne became ENOVIA MatrixOne.\n\nAlibre\n\nAlibre was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1997 by J. Paul Grayson and Stephen Emmons. The company was initially called Entity Systems but changed its name to Alibre before any software was shown to the public. Grayson was the founder and former CEO of Micrografx, a vendor of low-cost PC graphics software including PC-Draw. Emmons was also formerly at Micrografix where he was the principal developer of Micrografix Designer. Grayson, who put up the initial funding for Alibre, was the CEO and Emmons chief technology officer. Over the next several years the company raised over $18 million in venture funding.\n\nDuring its first two years the company concentrated on developing a new mechanical design package that could be provided to users over the Internet. The delivery mechanism was referred to as an Application Service Provider or ASP. Users would access the software with nothing more than a web browser on their desktop or notebook computer. The actual application software resided on servers operated by Alibre.\n\nThe software, Alibre Design, was first shown publicly at the M/TECH â99 conference in Chicago in November 1999. It used Spatial Technologyâs ACIS kernel, DCubeâs constraint manager as well as component software from several other providers. Engineering Automation Report was fairly enthusiastic, probably overly so, about this new concept for providing CAD software:\n\nâJust when you figure that the mechanical CAD industry has more software vendors than it can rationally support, along comes a new company with new ideas that forces you to realize that there really is room for another vendorâ¦â¦ Since the software runs on servers managed by Alibre, there is no need to invest in expensive computer hardware. In addition, if a designer is visiting a supplier, he or she can log on to the service from any available computer. No need to have the design software locally loaded. Within a few years, you might be able to work on designs from your seat on an airplane. â¦â¦..The design software that we viewed seems to be comparable to the early stages of most other mid-range solutionsâ¦â¦. We have a gut feeling that this company is going to make it big. It is well financed and appears to have a strategy right on target. Many computer industry observers, including this newsletter, believe that ASPs are the wave of the future.â [4]\n\nThe software as provided in a âpreview versionâ a few months later differed somewhat from what had been presented at M/TECH. In addition to the pure ASP implementation described above, the company offered a version where the model creation and editing software was moved to the userâs desktop system and the ASP server was used to store and manage the userâs data. Initial performance was relatively slow, probably because the software was written in Java which still executed interpretively rather than in compiled mode. The software turned out to lack some of the capabilities users had come to associate with most mid-range packages such as variable radius fillets and free-form surfaces. In a significant change of focus, the company began shifting its marketing message from pure mechanical design to design collaboration.\n\nAlibre Design 1.0 went live on April 10, 2000. It was made available on a subscription basis at $100 per month per user or on a self hosted basis at a price of $5,000 for six months use. Virtually all of the companyâs sales and support activities were web based. Meanwhile the companyâs management team was growing rapidly. Tommy Steele, who had previously been president of Intergraph Software Solutions, was COO, Tom Kopinski, who had been with Autodesk and SolidWorks, was vice president of sales and Greg Milliken, who had been with Knowledge Revolution before it was acquired by MSC.Software, was vice president of marketing. Neither Steele nor Kopinski stayed long but Milliken eventually became president and CEO of the company.\n\nGrayson and company were strong believers in Microsoft technology and Alibre was one of the first applications to support Windows 2000. In fact, Bill Gates used it as a demonstration tool for the Windows 2000 launch.\n\nAlibre evolved into a four-tier product:\n\nA web browser-based client that handled the display and manipulation of wireframe and shaded models.\n\nAn application design server that supported model creation and editing as well as drawing production.\n\nA database server the handled access privileges, revision control and check in/out. This was often referred to as the repository server.\n\nAn administration server that tied this all together.\n\nThe separation of the browser-based client from the design and data management servers allowed the client to run locally while the design and data management services could be either local or remote. By October 2000, Alibre had changed its business model and was providing the modeler as a free 18MB download and charging for the collaboration services it was providing on a subscription basis. About the same time it released Alibre Design 2.0 which addressed some of the performance issues.\n\nAlibre got off to a slower start than expected. Although thousands of potential customer downloaded free trial software, less than 1,000 signed up for the companyâs subscription service as of February 2001. Those that were using it were probably more intrigued by the softwareâs collaboration capabilities than by its design prowess which lagged competitive packages such as SolidWorks. About this time, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems settled their dispute over Java and Microsoft introduced a new programming language, C# as its web-centric programming language of the future and Alibre stated that it would convert from Java to C# in the future.\n\nWith Alibre Design 4.0, released in May 2002, the software became a Windows application rather than being browser based. The software could be used either off-line or in a collaboration mode over the Internet.\n\nThe companyâs business model changed once again with the $100 monthly subscription fee dropped and replaced by a $995 annual fee. Then a $495 promotion, which was offered when 4.0 was released, soon became the new price point. Self-hosted licenses were also available at prices based on the number of users. By 2002, however, the company was no longer aggressively pushing this type of business. The software was provided either on a CD-ROM or as a 25MB download. Increasingly, the company emphasized its collaboration capabilities and the ability to work with data from other CAD systems.\n\nIn late 2002, the companyâs focus changed once again and Alibre began promoting its software as a low-cost alternative to competitive mid-range packages. An enhanced version of the software, Alibre Design Professional, was released in April 2003, priced at $995 for an annual license, while the basic version of the software was increased to $695 per year.\n\nOne of the more interesting aspects of the Alibre story was the outright theft of its software by a Russian programmer, Roman Voznyuk, who had been laid off in 2003 during a corporate reorganization. Voznyuk returned to Russia and began offering a slightly modified version of Alibre Design as RaceCAD Design Professional. Alibre filed lawsuits in both Russian and American courts claiming that RaceCAD was created directly from source code for Alibre Design, and that RaceCAD also incorporated software stolen from Spatial, D-Cubed, the OpenDWG Alliance, and others. Criminal charges were also filed.\n\nAccording to Grayson: âhe offered to âsettleâ with us and discontinue the English version if we gave him the Russian version. Clearly, the only thing he is going to get is a stiff penalty and likely jail time.â[5] While the lawsuits were never resolved, RaceCAD simply faded from the scene. Then in August 2007, Voznyuk was arrested in upstate New York as he attempted to enter the United States from Canada where he had been working.\n\nIn February 2004, Milliken became president and CEO while Grayson remained chairman of the board. One of Millikenâs first steps was to raise the price of the companyâs products to $795 annually for Alibre Design, $1,295 for Alibre Design Professional, and $1,795 for Alibre Design Expert, a newer more expanded version of the software. A free stripped down version, Alibre Design Xpress was launched in mid-2004. Xpress drew large numbers of prospective users to the companyâs web site and a significant number ended up as paying customers for Alibre Design.\n\nAlibre never became the $100 million business Grayson expected, but it did become a profitable business. It continues to be an interesting chapter in the evolution of the CAD industry. As this is written, the companyâs software is being sold by VARs as well as on-line although the on-line approach is the companyâs preferred sales and support vehicle. Its board of directors include individuals such as Jeremy Jaech, the founder of Visio and Mike Maples, a former executive vice president of Microsoft.\n\nAries Technology\n\nAries Technology was organized in Lowell, Massachusetts in November 1984 by Larry McArthur, Richard Miller and several other ex-Applicon and Computervision managers including Gerald Christopher, Peter Pritchard, Dr. Jack Horgan, Arthur McCray and Jerry Sabath. McArthur was the only one who had not previously worked for one of the early CAD vendors. He had been president and general manager of Gouldâs Measurement Systems Division.\n\nMcArthur was Ariesâ president and CEO, Miller headed up marketing, Christopher finance, Pritchard sales, Horgan product development McCray software development and Sabath hardware development. The company raised $22.5 million in venture funding over the next three years including an investment from Eastech Limited Partners, one of whose principals was Fontaine Richardson, a founder and former vice president of Applicon.\n\nThe companyâs objective was to provide software that could be used during the conceptual phase of product design. The term they used to describe this process was âpredictive engineering.â Two years after being founded, Aries introduced its first product, the IBM PC AT-based Aries ConceptStation, at AUTOFACT â86 in Detroit. Both bundled (AT200) and unbundled (AT1200) versions were sold with prices starting at $32,000 for the unbundled version and $49,900 for a bundled configuration. The early ConceptStation systems required a Aries-built Graphics Engine in order to achieve reasonable interactive performance on the PC AT.\n\nIn an attempt to provide an âopen systemâ Aries selected Microsoftâs Xenix implementation of UNIX as its PC operating system. The early Ariesâ application software included a precise solids modeler, kinematics analysis and finite element modeling as well as other analysis software. A Design Rule Processor enabled engineers to tailor this process to incorporate the design steps most applicable to the product being worked on. A lower cost version of the ConceptStation, the AT1100, was introduced a few months later with prices starting at $21,850.\n\nOver the next few years, Aries developed partnerships with a number of other software firms including Swanson Analysis Systems, Mechanical Dynamics Incorporated, MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation (MSC) and Autodesk. As a result of these relationships, Aries began to include subsets of analysis programs such as Swansonâs ANSYS and MDIâs ADAMS in its ConceptStation software. The company also began to support most commonly available UNIX workstations as well as Intelbased PCs. As the hardware performance increased, the need for a custom graphics accelerator decreased and Aries ceased manufacturing its proprietary Graphics Engine.\n\nIn August 1989, Aries signed an agreement with Ford Motor Company under which Ford invested $6 million in the company and agreed to purchase an unspecified amount of Aries software products. This turned out to be an important relationship in that Ford had previously established a major technology project, Alpha Simultaneous Engineering. This was a 450-person organization under the leadership of Dr. Howard Crabb[6] whose mission was to develop improved products and processes that could be transferred to the rest of the company. Much of their efforts centered around the use of ConceptStation as the conceptual design tool that could help the company significantly reduce design time as well as create better products.\n\nA major product change occurred in November 1991 when Aries announced that it would incorporate the ACIS solids modeling kernel in the ConceptStation, replacing its proprietary modeler. This turned out to be a problematic decision in that ACIS in 1991 was not ready for prime time. At this point in time, ConceptStation consisted of about a dozen software modules including:\n\nConceptSolids (ACIS-based solids modeler)\n\nConceptParametrics (parametric design)\n\nConceptFEM (finite element modeling with automatic mesh generation and post processing)\n\nConceptFEA (a subset of the ANSYS analysis package â¢ ConceptCompose (drawing production)\n\nConceptDraw (drawing dimensioning).\n\nIn July 1992, Aries signed a significant joint development and marketing agreement with MSC. A few months later, Miller was made executive vice president and chief operating officer of Aries. A number of new products were introduced that linked Aries and MSC software together more tightly than before.\n\nThe next big change occurred in September 1993 when Aries was acquired by MSC and became the MSC/Aries division of that company. McArthur moved to Los Angeles and assumed the title of chief operating officer for MSC and Miller continued to run the Aries division in Lowell. McArthur left MSC after about a year and worked for a period of time at SGI as director in mechanical industry marketing. Later, he became president and CEO of Saxonyx, a company that developed information management software for the drug industry. Miller stayed for another year before leaving to become an industry consultant.\n\nThe companyâs plan was to position MSC/Aries primarily as a graphic pre- and pos-processor for MSCâs analysis software. This concept changed after MSC acquired PDA Engineering about a year later. PDAâs PATRAN software for pre- and postprocessing FEA models was substantially more mature and had a larger installed base than did the Aries software. As a result, PATRAN became the more heavily promoted package and MSC/Aries faded into the background although some customers were still using it six or eight years later.\n\nAshlar\n\nAshlar was founded by Dr. Martin Newell in 1988 after he left Cadlinc, another company he help start in 1981 as described below. Newell had also worked at the CAD Center in Cambridge, England and then at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). He was well recognized as one of the industryâs leading authorities on graphical user interfaces. Other ex-Cadlinc managers who were involved in Ashlar included Grant Munsey and Dan Fitzpatrick. Ashlar was funded in part by Hambrecht and Quist which had high expectations for this new startup. Bill Hambrecht, the head of Hambrecht and Quist sat on Ashlarâs board of directors for a number of years.\n\nThe companyâs initial product, Ashlar Vellum, was significant predominately because of the packageâs user interface. Newellâs intent was to create a design package where the interaction between the user and the software flowed in a natural rhythm. The focal point of the Vellum software was patented technology the company called the Geometric Inference Engine. This software formed the basis for Vellumâs user interface which was referred to as the Drafting Assistant. It used a technique called a âSmart Cursorâ to speed user interaction by inferring what the user might want to do next. As an example, if the user placed one end of a line near a circle, the logical next step might be to make the line tangent to the circle. If the user had a different intention, this operation could easily be overridden.\n\nInitial versions of Vellum were implemented on the Apple Macintosh computer with a Windows PC version following in the early 1990s. Unfortunately, Apple owned a software group at the time called Claris which also sold a two-dimensional drafting package called Claris CAD. Therefore, it was not particularly interested in helping to promote the Ashlar software.\n\nThe first released version of Vellum handled two-dimensional design. It was followed in early 1992 by Vellum 3D, initially for the Macintosh and later that year in a Windows version. This new software soon became the companyâs primary focus. Vellum 3D extended the Drafting Assistant into the Z dimension, enabling users to create graphics on the equivalent of a three dimensional isometric grid. Ashlar also added a graphical trackball display. By rotating the trackball with a graphic cursor, the user could rotate the model being worked on in any combination of the three axes.\n\nThe major drawback of the software in the early 1992 time frame was the lack of any surface or solid geometry capabilities. Hidden lines had to be removed manually at a time when most competitive systems did it automatically. In addition, there was limited capability to create assemblies. The two-dimensional version of Vellum sold for $1,995[7] while the three-dimensional version was $2,495[8]. In the first three years, Ashlar sold about 5,000 copies of Vellum. Then in August 1993, the Claris Corporation subsidiary of Apple withdrew Claris CAD from the market and recommended that its customers purchase a low-cost upgrade to Vellum. This move provided Ashlar with several thousand new users.\n\nDuring the companyâs early years, Newell was both the companyâs chairman and chief technology officer while day to day operations were run by Jack Hendren, the companyâs president and CEO. Hendren had earlier been with CADAM, Inc. where he led that companyâs EDA business unit.. In November 1994, Frank Puhl, the former president of CADAM, Inc. joined Ashlarâs board of directors.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Vellum was a well respected product but one that still did not have a lot of market traction. Some users, including Burt Rutan, the designer of advanced aircraft at Scaled Composites including the recent Space Ship One, were enthusiastic about the softwareâs capabilities as a conceptual design tool. Ashlar simply could not match the marketing clout of Autodesk and as a result the company became a niche player in the industry.\n\nVellum 3D Version 3.0, introduced in 1996, boosted Ashlar into a new realm of design tools with NURBS surfaces, shading, hidden line removal, and interfaces to higher-end solid modeling products offered by other vendors. Ashlar was still a fairly small company with about 20 employees at its Sunnyvale, California headquarters and another 12 in Japan. There were also three to four people at CADSoft Solutions in Dallas, TX who were helping develop ACIS-based Vellum Solids, which was released in early 1998. It was priced at $4,995 when combined with Vellum 3D. The company, by then, was basically being run by Nathan (Nat) Natarajan, its executive vice president, who had joined the company in 1993 from Autodesk.\n\nIn 1994, Ashlar filed patent infringement suits against Structural Dynamics Research Corp. (SDRC) and Diehl Graphsoft. The suits alleged that the graphical user interfaces used in their respective products, I-DEAS Master Series and MiniCAD, violated a pair of patents held by Ashlar related to the Geometric Inference Engine and interactive drawing system technologies. Ashlar contended that the SDRCâs âDynamic Navigatorâ found in I-DEAS Master Series and Diehl Graphsoftâs âSmartCursorâ found in MiniCAD made inappropriate use of its technology. Ashlar had negotiated licensing agreements with a number of other companies regarding use of this technology.\n\nSDRC eventually won this case when the patents in question were ruled invalid although the case dragged on for years as Ashlar repeatedly appealed court verdicts.\n\nIn 2000 Ashlar moved its operations to Austin, Texas and new versions of the Vellum software were periodically released for both the Macintosh and Windows platforms. Robert Bou became president and then in early 2005, the company was acquired by Vellum Investment Partners which consisted of Bou and his wife Julie. This was followed by the opening of a software development office in Kiev, Ukraine.\n\nWhile the company name is still Ashlar Corporation, it tends to use the term Ashlar-Vellum when it describes itself. Ashlarâs products consist of Graphite ($995) for two dimensional drafting and Argon ($995), Xenon ($2,995) and Cobalt ($3,995) for three dimension design where the latter two incorporate solids modeling. Ashlarâs licensing agreement allows a user to install the software on multiple machines (i.e. a PC at work and a Apple computer at home) as long as only one license is being used at a time. For users who need the software for short periods of time, the company offers annual and monthly licensing agreements.\n\nAutomation Technology Products (CIMPLEX Corporation, Technology Answers) Automation Technology Products (ATP) was started in April 1983 by Robert Benders, the former president and CEO of Calma, John Benbow, vice president of product development at Calma and Lem Bishop, the chief financial officer at Calma.. Between 1983 and 1987, the company raised a substantial amount of venture funding from investors including The Mayfield Fund, Arthur Rock and Hambrecht & Quist. Benders was CEO of the new company, Benbow was senior vice president, technology and Bishop was vice president of finance and administration.\n\nATPâs plan was to develop a comprehensive design, analysis and manufacturing system based on parametric solids modeling that ran on IBM mainframe computers, initially using that companyâs VM operating systems and 5080 graphics terminals. The companyâs software was also one of the first products to incorporate the concept of feature-based design and manufacturing. Rather than developing this software in a vacuum, the company signed technical cooperation agreements with Ingersoll Milling Machine Company and the Vought Aero Products Division of LTV Corporation.\n\nThe software product was called CIMPLEX and it consisted of feature-based solids modeling, analysis, manufacturing and data management modules. The CIMPLEX software enabled the user to work with three-dimensional shaded and edge-highlighted solid models as well as with wireframe and hidden line removed images.\n\nIn retrospect, selecting IBM mainframes for the softwareâs primary platform may well have been a fatal mistake in that UNIX workstations were starting to make a significant impact on technical computing. At the time, ATP was led to believe that IBM was planning to introduce a VM workstation much as Digital eventually introduced VMS workstations. At IBM, it just never happened. The IBM mainframe decision was further complicated when prospects pushed the company into porting the software to the MVS/XA operating system. This turned out to be a substantial task and for a time involved a third of the companyâs R&D staff. Selecting PL/1 as the programming language also turned out to be a problem as it did at Applicon.\n\nFor the most part, ATP developed the entire CIMPLEX suite of software rather than licensing external components. This was probably an additional contributing factor to the companyâs eventual downfall. Developing solid modeling, finite element modeling, manufacturing and data exchange software would have filled any companyâs plate. But in support of these applications, the company also wrote its own database program, rewrote IBMâs disk handling routines and created its own VM and MVS command language. CIMPLEX was fairly expensive software. The mainframe version of the basic design module was priced at $100,000 while the entire suite was $350,000.[9]\n\nRalph Ezard, who was working for ICL in England, was recruited by Benbow in 1984 to run the companyâs consulting services business and Jay Orlando, previously with Computervision, was hired as vice president of sales. Peter Marks, formerly with SDRC where he was general manager of product planning and marketing, joined ATP in February 1985 as vice president of product planning and marketing. The company closed its first sale to Ingersoll in late 1985. Over the next several years its customers included Northrop, Sikorsky Aircraft, Boeing and Chrysler Corporation. As with earlier technical partners, these companies also worked closely with ATP in defining and testing the companyâs software.\n\nBenders resigned as CEO in June 1986 and subsequently became president and CEO of Megatek Corporation, a vendor of high performance graphics terminals owned by United Technologies, the same company that once owned Calma. Benders was replaced a few months later by Dr. Russell Henke, the president and general manager of Gould Incorporatedâs Imaging and Graphics Division. Henke had earlier been executive vice president of Applicon and president and COO at SDRC. (see chapters 7 and 17).\n\nA major task facing the company was porting the CIMPLEX software to UNIX. This was done in two steps. First, the software was modified to support Silicon Graphics workstations as an alternative to the IBM 5080. SGI produced a PL/1 compiler for its workstation systems that enabled ATP to port the full suite of CIMPLEX software to run in native mode on SGI workstations.\n\nIn 1987, Henke negotiated a $5 million investment in ATP by Chrysler for a 10 percent interest in the company. It was too little, too late, however. The company continued to struggle for the next two years before it finally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the latter part of 1989. By then, investors had poured a total of nearly $36 million into the company with very little return on their investment. One result of the bankruptcy proceedings was that ownership of the CIMPLEX software was transferred to a new company, CIMPLEX Corporation, which was financed by a $1 million investment from Morgan Stanley. The new CEO was Ted Sarbin who was new to the CAD industry.\n\nFor the next 15 years development of the CIMPLEX automated manufacturing software continued although at a somewhat reduced rate of investment. From 1990 until 1998 the companyâs president and CEO was Jerry Robertson. Up through at least 1996, this software was referred to as Manufacturing Analyst. CIMdata felt that the company had some of the leading software for what is referred to as generative machining but that CIMPLEX never seemed to be able to become a significant factor in the NC industry.[10] The company also developed some effective NC verification software under the direction of Peter Atherton.\n\nIn 1998 the CIMPLEX technology was acquired by Technology Answers, Inc. and the software was renamed Cimskil. The current version of the Cimskil allows a user to import a CAD model and using data describing the organizationâs NC machine capabilities, automatically generate optimized tool paths. The software does this by recognizing model features such as slots, bosses, pockets, etc and selecting the best tool and machining method for that feature. Users can override any aspect of the automatically generated tool path and insert their own tool selection and procedures.\n\nAn article in the April 2002 issue of Modern Machine Shop described one project where Cimskil was used to program a 5-axis machine tool for a set of parts that had previous been done on 3- and 4-axis machines. The results were impressive. Working with Cimskil, the part programming took from a third to a tenth of the time compared to conventional NC part programming and production time was also a half or less of the previously recorded time.[11] Much of the software development was done under contract to the U.S. Department of Defense which was interested in being able to rapidly produce aircraft spare parts.\n\nBruningCAD\n\nBruning was a division of AM International that sold engineering supplies and reproduction equipment. In April 1981 it began selling a low-cost drafting system called Easydraf2 that was based on two-dimensional drafting software licensed from Graphcon.\n\nA complete system, which sold for $69,500, included a Hewlett-Packard 9845B desktop computer with a 13-inch raster display.[12] This was subsequently replaced by HP 9000 Series 200 computers with either a 9-inch or 12-inch color display.\n\nGraphcon was started in 1977 by Livingston Daniels in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Its Easydraf software was available on Tektronix 4050 graphic systems as well as the HP 9800 series. AM International acquired Graphcon in July 1983 and Daniels became president and CEO of the renamed BruningCAD. In September 1983, Lou Epstein who had previously been with Tektronix and Intergraph, joined as vice president of sales and marketing.\n\nDuring the next several years, BruningCAD developed its own workstation built around a Motorola 68000 microprocessor, a 19-inch 16-color 1024Ã768 display and a 14.5MB disk. Two version of the software were offered, Easydraf2 Architectural and Easydraf2 Mechanical. Prices started at $41,900 which was considerably higher than comparable PC-based system.\n\nIn October 1984, AM International, which was in the process of emerging from bankruptcy, folded BruningCAD into the rest of the Bruning operation in order to reduce overhead expenses. A year later, the companyâs CAD-related staff had been reduced from 46 to just 15 people and the remnants of this activity were sold to Holguin Corporation of El Paso, Texas. At the time, there were perhaps 1,500 Easydraf2 systems installed worldwide, 900 of which were in the U.S. Mutoh Industry Ltd. acquired the Japanese rights to the software. Although Holguin maintained the staff in Tulsa for a period of time, the business eventually faded away.\n\nCadkey (Micro Control Systems, Baystate, Kubotek)\n\nThis company was founded in 1981 in Windsor, Connecticut by Livingston Davies and Peter Smith as Micro Control Systems. Its first product was a threedimensional digitizer called the Perceptor. This was followed by a similar device called the Space Tablet. In 1982 the company introduced a simple software package that enabled users to view the scanned data as three-dimensional isometric or perspective images. The package, which ran on both Apple II and IBM-compatible PCs, was called Space Graphics and sold for just $475.\n\nThe company launched CADKEY in 1985 as a PC/DOS program partially to utilize the data generated by its three dimensional scanners. It targeted mechanical designers, especially those who were creating products that involved NC manufacturing operations but were also interested in producing quality mechanical drawings. CADKEYâs share of the PC CAD market peaked in the late 1980s at about 14 percent, behind AutoCAD and VersaCAD. CADKEY was a functionally rich three dimensional wireframe design and drafting package. Many customers, including Boeing, purchased it to complement the high-end design systems they also used.\n\nBy 1992, the company was doing about $12 million per year and Livingston Davies recruited Malcolm Davies, who had recently left Autodesk, as president.[13] Livingston Davies and Peter Smith left their day-to-day management roles at the company although they remained members of its board of directors. In an attempt to jump-start its business momentum, the company reduced the list price of the CADKEY software from $3,500 to $495 and DataCAD (an architectural drafting package it had acquired several years earlier) from $2,000 to $150. This greatly increased the number of users. As an example, the DataCAD user base went from a few thousand to over 50,000 in less than 12 months.\n\nBy late 1994 it was obvious that the market was not as price-elastic as expected and overall revenue was not growing. Malcolm Davies left and Livingston Davies returned as president and the price of CADKEY edged up to $795. In early 1995, Cadkey released CADKEY for Windows and before the year was over shipped 25,000 copies.\n\nThe company also marketed several third party packages as part of its product line including FastSURF from a company by the same name that incorporated NURBS surfaces and DRAFT-PAK, a mechanical drafting symbol library developed by Baystate Technologies, one of the companyâs dealers. In late 1995 the company was also developing ADVANCED MODELER, a solid modeling program that used the Shapes geometric kernel from XOX Corporation. At the start of 1996 the company underwent a substantial retrenchment and shifted to a software publishing business model and CADKEY development was moved to India. Baystate was signed up as the master distributor for CADKEY.\n\nIn mid-1996, Baystate, headed by Robert Bean and located in Malborough, Massachusetts, acquired all rights to the CADKEY package and related Cadkey software products. At that point, there were about 200,000 copies of CADKEY in use. One of the first steps Bean took was to replace the XOX geometric kernel with ACIS from Spatial Technologies.[14] In March 1997, Baystate began selling CADKEY 97 that incorporated ACIS 2.1 solids modeling. The price was now $1,995, up substantially from a few years earlier but still half the cost of competitive systems such as SolidWorks or Autodesk Mechanical Desktop.\n\nA year later, Baystate acquired FastSolid and FastSURF from a joint venture consisting of FastSURF Incorporated and Advancing Geometrics. A combination of CADKEY, Draft-Pak, FastSolid and FastSURF was sold as the CADKEY DESIGN SUITE for $3,995 while the base package remained $1,995. Baystate changed its name to CADKEY Corporation later in 1998.\n\nWith CADKEY 99, the company had a reasonable modeling solution although it still did not incorporate parametric definitions nor was assembly modeling easy. The programâs modeling capabilities were quite fast since CADKEY 99 did not incorporate a history tree describing how the model was constructed. The downside was it increased the effort required to modify models. CADKEY also began using the Web as a sales vehicle in late 1999. In December 2001, the company announced a totally redesigned package called CADKEY GraphX Version 20 that incorporated object-oriented software techniques, the HOOPS graphics routines and ACIS 6.3.6.\n\nWhile its products were improving, the company itself hit a major snag in 2003.\n\nBack in 1991, Baystate had been sued by another vendor of add-on CADKEY software, Harold L. Bowers, who operated as HLB Technologies. HLB accused Baystate of copying one of its software products. The case dragged on for 12 years but was finally decided in HLBâs favor in 2003. Baystate was required to pay HLB $5.27 million ($3.87 million plus interest), money that Baystate did not have. In August 2003, Baystate filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nInitially, it was thought that International Microcomputer Software, Inc. (IMSI), the vendor of TurboCAD, would acquire the company. In November 2003, Kubotek, a Japanese company that had acquired a 17 percent interest in Baystate in 1996, purchased the company for $3.6 million. HLB got about $750,000 as a result of this deal. The company was renamed Kubotek USA with Naotake Kakishita as president and Bean as chief operating officer. The CADKEY product itself was renamed KeyCreator.\n\nCalComp Systems (ISICAD)\n\nCalComp Computer Products was founded by three engineers from Rockwellâs Autonetics Division in 1959. Initially focused on military research, the company launched the industryâs first incremental digital plotter in 1961. By the early 1970s it was the leading manufacturer of digital plotters and had expanded into other areas including plug-compatible peripherals for IBM mainframe computer. This latter activity involved the acquisition of Century Data Systems and was a financial disaster that is outside the scope of this book.\n\nThe data storage business was sold to Xerox in 1979 and the company, itself, was acquired by Sanders Associates in 1980. In addition to its own product line of graphics terminals, Sanders manufactured the 3250 display for IBM during the early and mid 1980s. This business eventually dried up when IBM introduced the 5080 raster graphics system. Most of the companyâs plotter sales were in support of other companiesâ CAD systems. Sanders grouped together the CalComp Systems business described below, the CalComp plotter business, the Talos digitizer business which it had also acquired and its own graphics terminal business in a single organization and marketed all these products under the CalComp brand name.\n\nCalComp began the development of its own CAD system in 1975. The companyâs first CAD product, the IGS-500, was introduced in 1979, about the same time that CalComp Systems was established. The IGS product line also included the IGS-300 and the IGS-400. These systems were based on a 16-bit minicomputer manufactured under license from a French electronics firm, SociÃ©tÃ© EuropÃ©enne de Mini-Informatique et de SystÃ¨mes (SEMS), a division of Thomson-CSF. Each terminal incorporated a high speed graphics processor called the Picture Processor which handled operations such as pan and zoom locally. Each terminal contained a 250KB high-speed memory that held the entire active drawing. The basic unit had a 15-inch monitor with 416 by 300 resolution. A 20inch unit was 1024 by 768 resolution was also available.\n\nThe basic IGS-300 was intended to be a satellite system to an IGS-500. It had a 192KB memory, a 40MB disk, a 15-inch low resolution graphics display, and a separate alphanumeric display. The IGS-400 incorporated a hard disk drive, dual floppy drives and supported one or two terminals. The IGS-500 was a more powerful system capable of supporting six or more local terminals or remote IGS-300 systems. A high resolution 20inch display was also available. Basic systems ranged from $90,000 to $160,000 while additional terminals cost $55,000 each with the smaller display. A color raster display was introduced in mid-1982 for $78,000.\n\nThe IGS software handled two-dimensional drafting fairly well. One problem was that the computer being used was not generally available to other commercial accounts and CalComp had to create its own operating system as well as a FORTRAN compiler. Another problem was that the company offered few task-specific applications other than architectural drafting and piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs).\n\nIn mid-1984, CalComp Systems introduced a new product line, the System 25. It was based on a Masscomp computer and the CalComp built Picture Processor. The initial Masscomp systems used dual 10-MHz Motorola 68000 microprocessors, UNIX and Ethernet. The typical configuration included an alphanumeric display, a 20MB disk and either a 20-inch monochromatic or 19-inch color display. The software supported basic drafting functions with an emphasis on facilities planning and architectural design.\n\nThe System 25 software was functionally identical to the earlier IGS software. Each Masscomp computer was capable of supporting two workstations. A single system with a monochromatic terminal and a CalComp 945 plotter had a list price of $95,000. A second workstation cost $$37,000.\n\nThe management staff in mid-1985 consisted in part of:\n\nWilliam Conlin â president of CalComp Computer Products\n\nLouis DeBartolo â vice president and general manager of CalComp Systems\n\nWilliam OâBrien â group vice president, marketing and sales\n\nJim Gowan â vice president and general manager, international\n\nDoyle Cavin â vice president, technology\n\nJoe Fornataro â vice president, system sales\n\nWarren Winterbottom â vice president, OEM product sales (previously vice president of marketing for the Systems division)\n\nConlin eventually joined SDRCâs board of directors after retiring from CalComp. OâBrien[15], Gowan and Cavin were all former Tektronix executives while Winterbottom went on to work for both Intergraph and Bentley Systems.\n\nCalComp Systems never had much more than about $30 million in annual revenues. In mid-1985, the CalComp Systems Division of Sanders Associates acquired the CADplan software product line from Personal CAD Systems (P-CAD) for $7.5 million and renamed it CADVANCE. This software initially sold for $2,500 per copy. The acquisition did not go well and Sanders sued P-CAD for $22 million claiming that the company had misled it about the financial health of its AEC business prior to the acquisition.[16] A major problem that CalComp faced trying to sell CAD systems and software was that it competed with turnkey CAD systems vendors who were some of CalCompâs largest customers for plotters and other peripheral devices. Sanders Associates was acquired in 1986 by Lockheed which also owned CADAM, Inc. When Lockheed ran into it own financial problems, it sold off several divisions including CADAM. It was expected that CalComp was also going to be sold but either no buyer emerged or Lockheed changed its mind and kept the company. For the next few years CalComp did fairly well as an independent division of Lockheed focused on plotters and other peripheral devices.[17]\n\nCalComp pulled out of the CAD systems business in May 1987 when it sold CalComp Systems to ISICAD based it Ellwangen, Germany and subsequently focused its resources on three primary product lines: plotters, printers and digitizers. ISICAD opened an office in Anaheim, California and marketed CADVANCE for a number of years. The president of the U. S. operation was John Arnold.\n\nCalComp continued to produce a wide range of plotters using just about every technology currently available including increasingly popular inkjet units that were quickly replacing pen plotters and expensive electrostatic devices. Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin.\n\nCalComp Computer Products and Summagraphics merged in July 1996 and became CalComp Technology, Inc. This new entity assumed Summagraphicsâ position on NASDAQ with Lockheed Martin owning about 90 percent of the new company. The next few years saw CalComp Technologyâs sales slowly decline as the company struggled with new inkjet technology and increased plotter competition from HewlettPackard. Trading in CalComp Technology stock was terminated in January 1999 and the company was liquidated in May 1999.\n\nCADVANCE software was acquired in 1995 from ISICAD by Furukawa Information Technology, Inc., a software distributor located in Anaheim, California. Founded by Takashi Furukawa, the company continues to sell CADVANCE, currently priced at $1,995 per copy. See section below on ISICAD.\n\nCimlinc(Cadlinc)[18]\n\nCadlinc was founded in April1981 by John West who had previously been involved with the sale of NC supplies and Mike Sterling, the founder of Systems Associates, a manufacturing consulting company established in 1973. The latter company was the U. S. distributor of an NC software package, Graphical Numerical Control (GNC) and a surface geometry package, Polysurf, both developed by the CAD Centre in Cambridge, England. The GNC software was also sold by Prime Computer. In the process of starting Cadlinc, Systems Associates was folded into the new company. West was primarily the public face of the company while Sterling became vice president of product development for the new company.\n\nThe third key member of the start-up team was Dr. Martin Newell who had earlier been associated with the CAD Centre in Cambridge and then at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) where he worked on interactive graphic systems with John Warnock who subsequently co-founded Adobe Systems. While Cadlinc was initially headquartered in Elk Grove, Illinois, Newell stayed in Palo Alto and ran the companyâs research center there while Sterling ran other software development from Troy, Michigan. Eventually, the companyâs operations were consolidated in Itasca, Illinois.\n\nIn four rounds of funding, the company raised $24 million in venture capital from a number of investment firms including Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers and The Hillman Group.[19] The companyâs early products fell into three categories. Initially, it manufactured its own UNIX workstations built around the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, Ethernet and a proprietary graphics processor. It also developed design and drafting software and adapted the GNC NC software to work on the Cadlinc workstation. It probably can lay claim to being the first vendor to sell turnkey CAD/CAM systems on networked UNIX workstations since the Apollo workstations being used by Auto-trol Technology and Calma were not true UNIX systems.\n\nAccording to Sterling, he knew Jim Clark, the founder of Silicon Graphics, and attempted unsuccessfully to get Cadlincâs financial backers to fund Clarkâs early graphics work. This was about six months after Auto-trol had likewise turned down an opportunity to work with Clark as discussed in Chapter 9.\n\nThroughout the 1980s Cadlinc invested considerable resources in its proprietary workstations at a time when other turnkey vendors such as Calma, Computervision and Auto-trol Technology were switching to industry standard workstations manufactured by Apollo Computer, Sun Microsystems and others. While, its workstations and user interface were fine tuned for its own software, building computer hardware, including a proprietary floating point processor, turned out to have a negative impact on the company. Cadlinc always seemed to be playing catch-up to other workstation vendors. For example, for some time after Apollo had switched to Motorolaâs 68020 microprocessor, Cadlinc was still using the 68000.\n\nThe companyâs systems were reasonably priced. In mid-1985, a CIM Station (a basic workstation with 2.5MB of memory, a 30MB disk and a 19-inch 256 color monitor) sold for $39,500. Basic design software was an additional $10,500 while surface design and NC software packages were $9,500 each. One can assume that packaged solutions sold for less than the sum of these prices. The company also sold the CIM Manager, a server with up to 800MB of disk storage. Very little third-party software was available.\n\nThe companyâs strongest marketing points were that West and Sterling had been involved in the NC business for over ten years and the softwareâs user interface was one of the best then on the market. West was a very dynamic individual and the company received substantial positive press coverage. In November 1985, the company changed its name to Cimlinc. The following year revenues reached $25 million with over 200 employees and everyone expected the company to go public. While the companyâs revenues subsequently increased to over $35 million (about half hardware and half software), the IPO never happened.\n\nIn 1986 the company changed the system nomenclature to Power CIM. The new workstation used a 68020 processor, a Motorola 68881 floating point processor and a separate 68000 to control input/output. The system had 4MB of memory, an 86MB disk (expandable to 2GB) and a 19-inch 1024 by 792 color display. This was one of the first systems where the user interface consisted primarily of on-screen menus and a mouse. The software was renamed CIM CAD and included solid modeling functions. The manufacturing software was called CIM CAM. Monochromatic workstations started at $11,990 and color workstations at $16,990. CIM CAD software was $4,495 while CIM CAM was $6,495.\n\nBy late 1987 the company realized that it could no longer compete in the workstation market and Cimlinc became a pure software vendor. PCs were coming on strong and the sales force was finding itself spending a considerable portion of its time defending the companyâs hardware strategy. Cinlinc ported its software to Sun Microsystems SPARCstations and in mid-1989 the company reduced its software prices by as much as 77 percent. A Sun workstation with basic CAD software sold for just $19,500.\n\nIn 1990 the company was split into two operating units, the AMT (Advanced Manufacturing Technology) division which continued to maintain its CAD/CAM applications and a new group that began to pursue information management applications. The design and NC packages were renamed ExpertCAD, ExpertCAM and ExpertCAD 3D with prices ranging from $2,995 to $8,995. The software was supported on both Sun UNIX workstations and on Windows PCs. AMT also offered a more advanced UNIX software solution for tool and die production called ToolDesigner that was initially priced at $10,000.\n\nGradually, Cimlinc began to refocus its energies in the data management area. Its target was managing the flow of design and manufacturing information with a product called LINKAGE which was introduced in 1991. This software was built around a macro language, ScriptLINK, used in its CAD/CAM software. LINKAGE ran on UNIX workstations at a time when it probably should have been ported to the PC. Mike Sterling left the company around 1995 due to the change in the companyâs direction.\n\nThe AMT division of Cimlinc was acquired for $6 million by Softech in late 1997 which it still operates it as this is being written. Among other products, Softech is also the current vendor of CADRA. By 2001, the data management portion of Cimlinc simply disappeared as a company.\n\nCoCreate (Hewlett-Packard Mechanical Design Division)\n\nHewlett-Packard was an early vendor of minicomputers and desktop graphics systems used for engineering design and analysis, either as a supplier to various turnkey systems vendors or by selling this equipment directly to end users. The two centers of activity for desktop computer systems were Fort Collins, Colorado and Boeblingen, Germany.\n\nFrom an application point of view, Fort Collins concentrated on electronic design and drafting, especially electronic schematics. HP spent a significant amount of energy trying to develop electronic CAE software internally. This effort, led by C. Richard Moore, who subsequently left to become CEO of Valid Logic, was terminated in October, 1984. HP then acquired Salt Lake City, Utah-based Cericor in late 1985 for $32.5 million. By 1990, this operation proved incapable of competing with companies such as Mentor Graphics and the EDA business was closed down.\n\nSeparately, HPâs facility in Boeblingen began developing mechanical software. The first product, introduced in 1980, was an object-oriented two-dimension package called HP Design. It used parametric techniques that proved to be hard to use. Although they added a FEA package from a software firm in England and a NC package from another vendor Germany, HP Design was not widely used outside of HP itself. This package focused on design tasks at a time when customers were looking for desktop drafting solutions. Some of the problems HP had with the parametric features of this software led it down a development path that avoided history-based software solutions as described below.\n\nIn late 1981, HP introduced a new product, HP Draft. This was a drafting package the company licensed from Skok Systems, a South African software firm. HP licensed the package for resale to mechanical users while Skok continued to sell it to AEC users. The HP development staff in Boeblingen, under the direction of Tillman Schad, worked from about 1981 to 1984 developing a new package specifically intended for mechanical drafting called ME Series 10.\n\nAt about the same time, HP restructured this operation as its Mechanical Design Division (MDD). In addition to ME 10, MDD also developed a three-dimensional design package using the Romulus solids modeler. Introduced in 1985 as ME Series 30, it was primarily an analytical modeler with no free-form surface capability. The price in the U. S. was $14,500.\n\nTo satisfy the need for three-dimensional surface modeling, HP introduced ME Series 50 in late 1985. This package was based on Graftek (a division of Burroughs at the time) software. (See section on Graftek below.) The timing was bad in that HP earnings had been declining and in a cost-savings move, ME 50 was withdrawn from the market within nine months of its introduction.\n\nA typical ME 10 systems sold for about $40,000 including an HP workstation. At the time, both MDD and the electronic CAE systems were managed by HPâs Design Systems Group which was also responsible the companyâs engineering workstation business. The company also sold a reduced function version of ME 10 called ME Series 5 which sold for about $20,000 including hardware. The latter product was not particularly successful in that there was growing interest in PC-based solutions such as Autodeskâs AutoCAD which sold for less than half the cost including hardware and software.\n\nThe Design Systems Group was managed by Bill Parzybok while the electronic engineering activity was run by Larry Porter and the mechanical engineering operation in Boeblingen was run by Tilman Schad. At about the same time, HP became a major player in the engineering plotter business and also acquired Apollo Computer, significantly increasing its share of the engineering workstation market.\n\nThe companyâs entry into the CAD software market put it on a collision course with many of Apolloâs OEM customers who were not particularly pleased to be competing with one of their primary suppliers. HP tried to dampen objections without much success by establishing a separate sales force for its CAD systems.\n\nIn early 1992, HP renamed the existing products Precision Engineering/ME 10 and Precision Engineering/ME 30. At the same time, it introduced a new solids-based system called Precision Engineering /SolidDesigner. This latter package was initially based upon Spatial Technologyâs ACIS geometric kernel. At the time, HP owned about a 10 percent interest in Spatial. Being an early adopter, HP had to develop a fair amount of add-on technology to ACIS, especially in the surface modeling area. HP proceeded down its own development path and never implemented newer releases of ACIS. Within several releases, little of the original ACIS code remained in SolidDesigner.\n\nSolidDesigner differed from most contemporary CAD systems that used history trees to maintain the relationships between graphic features. It used an approach called dynamic modeling that allows users to manipulate geometry irrespective of what was done to the model earlier. There are pros and cons of both approaches â suffice it to say that the HP approach was different than most other systems on the market. SolidDesigner retained many of the functional characteristics of ME 30 except that it no longer supported tablet menus. A multi-dial function box was used to pan, zoom and rotate shaded models on HP workstations. Detailed mechanical drafting continued to be done with ME 10. Solid Designer software prices started at $7,500 which was competitive with PTCâs Pro/ENGINEER.\n\nSeparately, the company marketed a PDM package called WorkManager which was an upgraded version of an earlier package called the Data Management System. WorkManager was implemented to work with data from design and drafting systems other than just the ones sold by HP. The intent was to provide a data management solution that did not require a dedicated system administrator.[20]\n\nThe friction between HP and its OEM customers in the mechanical CAD market eventually led HP to restructure MMD as a separate wholly-owned subsidiary in 1996 called CoCreate with Schad as president. In September 2000 CoCreate was acquired from HP by two European investment firms, 3i PLC and Triton Fund, and the companyâs employees. The two investment firms probably owned over 90 percent of the company. Schad continued as CEO of the newly independent company which was still located in Fort Collins, Colorado. The companyâs chief operating officer was Gert Deiss and vice president of product development was Ulrich Mahle, both of whom were long term HP and CoCreate employees.\n\nIn the late 1990s CoCreate began promoting a new collaborative engineering package called OneSpace that enabled engineers and others located at geographically separate locations to work together on the same design. One participant controlled the design review session while other participants viewed any changes made to the product model. This control could be shifted between participants although changes could only be made by someone who actually had the design software on their computer. Eventually Solid Designer was renamed Designer Modeling, ME 10 became Designer Drafting and WorkManager morphed into Model Manager. By 2006 the software was being fully developed using Microsoftâs .NET platform and it no longer retained any vestiges of its UNIX roots.\n\nSchad was replaced as CEO in March 2002 by William Gascoigne who had been vice president of worldwide marketing at Applicon and more recently executive vice president of worldwide operations at SDRC. Hansjoerg Pleggemars, who joined the company in 2000 as CFO was appointed COO in July 2006. At the same time, ownership of the company changed once again when HBK Investments L.P., a large U.S.-based hedge fund, acquired CoCreate.\n\nFrom 2000 through 2006, CoCreateâs revenues were in the $75 million per year range although profits improved significantly during the period. One reason revenues stagnated was that the company began offering its software on a monthly subscription basis in addition to selling fully paid-up licenses. While this generated many new customers, it did defer some revenue to future years. The companyâs headquarters were basically split between Fort Collins and Sindelfingen, Germany with its approximately 300 employees about evenly divided between Europe, The U. S. and Asia.\n\nOwnership of CoCreate changed once again in December 2007 when PTC completed the acquisition of the company for about $250 million. At the time it committed to continue support of CoCreateâs software as stand-alone products as well as integrate the technology with its own products. At the time of this latest acquisition, CoCreate had about 5,000 customers.\n\nCognition\n\nOther than the fact that it has exhibited impressive staying power and has been run by some of the CAD industryâs early pioneers, I probably would not have included Cognition in this chapter. Cognition Incorporated was founded in February 1985 by a group of 11 experienced industry managers led by Philippe Villers, a founder of Computervision as well as Automatix, a manufacturer of robotic and artificial vision systems. Villers had started Automatix in 1980 along with Mike Cronin who had been vice president of sales and later vice president of R&D at Computervision. In 1984, investors in Automatix felt a change in management was needed and Cronin replaced Villars as CEO of the company.\n\nVillars, being a serial entrepreneur, started Cognition to focused on the development and marketing of mechanical computer-aided engineering (MCAE) solutions. Among the other founders were George Stienke, vice president of marketing who was formerly executive vice president of marketing at Intergraph, Kenneth Schroeder, vice president of research and development who was formerly manager of General Electricâs Industrial Electronics Development Laboratory, Robert Light, product line manager for MCAE who was formerly technical manager of MITâs CAD Laboratory and Douglas Wilson, manager of systems architecture who was formerly a manager of MITâs project Athena, a 1,000 terminal computing network. Other founders and early employees had equally strong backgrounds.\n\nBased on Villers reputation within the financial community, the company was able to raise $15.5 million in two rounds of funding during its first two years including $2 million from the founders. One has to assume that much of the latter amount came from Villers. Investors included Harvard Management Corporation, MIT, and Eastech Limited Partnership. As mentioned above, Eastech was also an early backer of Aries Technology.\n\nThe companyâs initial product, Mechanical Advantage 1000 (MA1000) was introduced at AUTOFACT â85 in Detroit that November. The company planned to offer both unbundled software and complete turnkey systems that consisted of a Digital MicroVAX II host and up to five IBM PC AT workstations. The software enabled users to sketch, analyze and optimize conceptual designs. The intent was to have this data passed on to traditional CAD systems via IGES in order to complete the designs and produce engineering drawings.\n\nThe MA1000 software was called The Optimizer. It included SketchPad, MathSolve, first-order analysis tools, online engineering handbooks and a data management tool called the Intelligent Notebook. MathSolve equations could be linked to specific dimensions defined with SketchPad. The engineering handbook content resulted from an agreement the company negotiated with McGraw-Hill. A three-seat MA1000 was priced at $130,000. Unbundled Optimizer software was $37,500.\n\nAfter some development delays, the company began shipping MA1000 systems in late 1986. Revenues in 1986 were only $730,000 and with 95 employees it was burning up cash at a rapid rate. A higher performance system, the MA1500/GPX, using the Digital VAXstation II/GPX was introduced in late 1986. While these systems demonstrated very well, they just did not seem to create the necessary level of interest among potential buyers who were mostly still trying to automate basic drafting tasks.\n\nThe early expectations were that Cognition would take off like a rocket. It never happened. One problem was that the technology appealed to individual engineers but senior managers, those who controlled budgets, were still focused on automating basic design and drafting tasks. George Stienke resigned in early 1987 and the company started looking for ways to expand its product offerings. One area it focused on was cost estimating. The resulting product, Cost and Manufacturability Guide, was eventually a key part of the companyâs survival as a viable business entity. Over time, the company phased out of the hardware business and became a pure software play.\n\nOne aspect of this transition was the acquisition of SuperCads, Inc., a software firm started by Shyamal Roy in 1981. The SuperCads software was a three-dimensional wireframe package. Cognition marketed SuperCads without a great deal of success.\n\nBy early 1988 the company was in substantial financial difficulty and Automatix, under Mike Cronin, acquired the assets of Cognition Inc. and hired most of the companyâs remaining employees. Automatix ran the former Cognition activity as a subsidiary legally named Supercads, Inc. but utilizing the Cognition trade name. This subsidiary, of which outside investors owned about 29 percent, continued to struggle with revenue running between $1 and $2 million annually. Cronin stepped down as CEO of Automatix in 1990 to become full time CEO of SuperCads. He was replaced at Automatix by Ofer Gneezy.\n\nBy July 1992 Automatix had incurred losses on this activity of $4.3 million and it sold the Cognition business (still legally SuperCads, Inc.) to Cadema Corporation for $1.8 million in cash and notes and Cronin took over running Cadema.[21] Before this transaction, Cadema was nothing more than a shell corporation which had earlier been engaged in medical research activities. It had some cash left over from these previous endeavors and was looking for opportunities to invest it. This new ownership did not last long and in May 1993 Cadema sold the Cognition assets to Cronin and a group of other investors.\n\nOver the next few years, Mechanical Advantage was refined to provide three main capabilities: tolerance analysis, functional modeling and parameter analysis. In the 1999 time frame, about 30 percent of the Mechanical Advantage customers were using the software just for tolerance analysis. Prices started at $12,000 per license.\n\nCost and Manufacturability Guide eventually morphed into a product called Cost Advantage that assisted companies in predicting manufacturing costs before a design was completed. A key component of this software was called Model Builder. It provided the information needed to link manufacturing costs to design features. Cost Advantage software started at $20,000 for Model Builder plus one floating user license. Additional software was $5,000 per copy.[22] This turned out to be Cognitionâs key product activity for the next few years.\n\nToday, the surviving company, Cognition Corporation, still markets Mechanical Advantage and Cost Advantage but with increased emphasis on two new initiatives, Cognition Cockpit and Enterprise Cost Management (ECM). According to the company, Cockpit is a tool set and knowledge management system which can be used to support Design For Six Sigma. ECM is a product cost management system. In 2006, Dale Gallaher was named president of Cognition. Mike Cronin is still chairman and CEO while his son David is manager of business development.\n\nControl Data Corporation (Control Data Systems, ICEM Technologies)\n\nControl Data Corporation (CDC) was one of the early manufacturers of largescale scientific computers including one of the first âsuper computers,â the CDC 6600, introduced in 1964. CDC first became involved with CAD solutions in 1963 when it acquired the rights to Itek Corporationâs Electronic Drafting Machine and established its Digigraphics Division in Bedford, Massachusetts as described in Chapter 6. In the late 1960s, CDC realized that the Digigraphics operation was âwine before its timeâ and shut the money-loosing operation down.\n\nIn the early 1970s, CDC was a profitable computer vendor selling a broad range of machines to scientific research centers and manufacturing companies. It was also a leading participant in the business of selling time-sharing services. Given the communication capabilities then available, it was not feasible to provide highly interactive applications such as CAD on a time-sharing basis.\n\nAlan Christman joined CDC in 1970 as general manager of manufacturing industry marketing. Over the next few years the company began to look at ways it could provide more complete design and manufacturing solutions to its customers. One option that was fairly quickly rejected was to resurrect the Digigraphics activity. CDC also decided that it did not want to develop CAD software from scratch. The result was that the company signed a license agreement with Manufacturing & Consulting Services (MCS) in the mid-1970s for that companyâs AD-2000 software as described in Chapter 15.\n\nAD-2000 formed the basis of what CDC called its ICEM (Integrated Computeraided Engineering and Manufacturing) program. The software was implemented on the companyâs 32-bit mid-range computers as well as on its 60-bit supercomputers such as the CDC 6600. The primary user terminal at the time was the Tektronix 4014. CDC established its own software group to extend the capabilities of AD-2000 as well as support the companyâs computer systems. Working with MCS-provided updates to AD2000 proved to be difficult for CDC and, in early 1982, the company acquired a fully paid-up license for AD-2000 much as Auto-trol Technology did around the same time. At this point the name for the product was changed to CD/2000 and then later ICEM DDN.\n\nWhile the company put substantial effort into making CD/2000 a viable product, the impression most people had was that CDC was simply using the software to help sell mainframe and minicomputer computer systems. The company invested a fair amount of effort in making the software run efficiently on its computer systems but relatively less on actually improving CD/2000âs functional capabilities. CDC also continued to provide technical time-sharing services through a division called CYBERNET, particularly in the area of structural analysis and electronic circuit design.\n\nOne area of interest was solids modeling which the company saw as an emerging technology. Christman remembers reading an article in Business Week that described how Boeing was experimenting with Synthavision solids modeling software from MAGI. CDC subsequently licensed Synthavision and created a link to CD/2000 for exchanging data between the two packages. The company ended up selling relatively few copies of Synthavision, primarily because of performance issues. Christman, who is now a principal at CIMdata, described the software as âwatching paint dry.â[23]\n\nEventually the software expanded to encompass a broader range of engineering tasks including data management and NC applications. The company also added software, ICEM Electronics, that enabled engineers to merge electronic design with mechanical design. A single user system utilizing the companyâs Cyber 120-40 computer with a subset of the ICEM software was introduced in mid 1983 for $50,000. The Cyber 120-40 was actually a repackaged Data General S20 computer. A six-user system started at $161,000.[24]\n\nMajor customers included Bendix in Kansas City, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Volkswagen and Fischer-Price, the manufacturer of childrenâs toys. In June 1986, CDC acquired an NC software firm, ICAM Technologies, of Pointe Claire, Quebec to expand its NC capabilities. Also, about the same time, CDC began selling a product line of UNIX workstations, the CYBER 910-300 Series, which were basically repackaged Silicon Graphics workstations.\n\nIn the late 1980s CDC began to put increased focus on PDM software. The companyâs product was called EDL (Engineering Data Library). Initially it was implemented on CDC computers but by mid-1991 CDC was also supporting Sun and SGI UNIX workstations with Hewlett Packard, IBM and Digital versions in development. EDL software was sold on a per workstation basis with the basic network information manager priced at $3,500 per seat. A complete system including a release manager and product structure software was $6,500 per seat.[25] The portion of CDC that included the companyâs CAD/CAM and PDM activity was subsequently renamed Control Data Systems, Inc. or CDSI.\n\nAs described in Chapter 17, CDSI and SDRC established a joint venture in 1992, Metaphase Technology, Inc., to pursue the PDM market. CDC contributed the EDL software and a number of individuals to this venture. SDRC soon became the driving force behind Metaphase in regards to both development and marketing. Then in late 1996, SDRC bought out Control Dataâs interest in Metaphase.\n\nIn 1993, CDSI became ICEM Technologies with ICEM DDN (previously called CD/2000) as the companyâs primary product. One change was increased interest in surface geometry software developed by the companyâs European operation in Frankfurt, Germany. ICEM SURF started out as an internal development project at Volkswagen. It soon gained a reputation within the automotive industry as one of the leading tools for body styling and eventually it became ICEM Technologiesâ primary product with ICEM DDN deemphasized. ICEM SURF quickly gained a reputation as a leading package for automotive styling, particularly for creating and editing what that industry referred to as Class A surfaces. The company also renewed its focus on manufacturing software with the introduction of PART, an NC package that used feature recognition and generative expert system technology. Another package, ICEM Solidify was introduced that facilitated the conversion of wireframe data to ACIS-based solids models.\n\nIn 1998, ICEM Technologies was acquired by PTC as described in Chapter 16, primarily for its ICEM SURF software. PTC spent several years attempting to integrate ICEM software with Pro/ENGINEER and eventually decided that it had more on its plate than it could deal with. ICEM was sold to a group of English investors in August 2002 and was subsequently operated as ICEM Ltd. in Southampton, England. In 2005, the company expanded its product line with the introduction of ICEM Shape Design (ISD), a parametric modeling package developed on Dassault SystÃ¨mes CAA V5 architecture. Then in mid-2007, Dassault acquired ICEM for the equivalent of $69 million.\n\nGerber Systems Technology (Gerber Scientific)\n\nThe Gerber Scientific Instrument Company was founded in 1948 by H. Joseph Gerber, the 1994 recipient of the National Medal of Technology. Initially the company produced mechanical data reduction instruments used before electronics and computers revolutionized that field. Over the years, Joe Gerber was awarded 675 patents, including a number after he passed away in 1996 at the age of 72. Gerber is perhaps best known today for the precision cutting machines he developed for the apparel and shoe industries.\n\nGerber went public in 1961 at $6 per share and shortly thereafter developed the photoplotter which revolutionized the production of printed circuit board artwork. For many years the company was the leading vendor of photoplotters. The company also began manufacturing numerically-controlled sewing machines and CAD/CAM systems.\n\nThe companyâs name was changed to Gerber Scientific, Incorporated in 1978. By 1980 the company had overall revenues of about $75 million and its stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Gerber Scientific was organized as a holding company with four primary operating units.\n\nGerber Scientific Instruments â precision plotting systems including photoplotters and precision pen plotters.\n\nGerber Systems Technology â CAD/CAM systems.\n\nGerber Scientific Products â custom computer-controlled manufacturing system.\n\nGerber Garment Technology â layout and cutting systems for the garment industry.\n\nIn addition to a wide range of plotters and photoplotters, Gerber Scientific Instruments (GSI) marketed a PCB layout and artwork system called the PC-800. Various version of this system sold for $35,000 to $50,000 plus the cost of a plotter and/or photoplotter. The latter typically sold for $60,000 to over $500,000. The PC-800 used a Hewlett-Packard 2100 Series 16-bit minicomputer with 32KB of memory and dual 8-inch floppy disks. The user terminal consisted of a relatively small monochromatic raster display and a Gerber 8200 digitizer. Typical operation involved the user manually laying out a circuit board, digitizing the layout, editing the data, plotting the layout for checking purposes and then outputting the data to either an on-line or off-line photoplotter.[26]\n\nThe PC-800 was a fairly simple system but it worked well. By 1981, the company was selling $12 million annually of PC-800 products and had an installed base of 250 systems.[27] By 1987 it had installed 775 such systems. GSI also sold flatbed plotters as large as 6 feet by 24 feet and drum plotters up to 48 inches wide. These were all extremely accurate and reliable machines.\n\nGerber System Technology (GST), originally Gerberâs Systems Division, became a quasi-independent company in 1981 with Wilbur (Bill) Mann as president. It was 80 percent owned by Gerber Scientific and 20 percent by the public. GST went public in 1981 at $12.50 per share. At the time it had about 300 employees and was doing over $17 million in annual revenue. Gerber was an early licensee of Pat Hanrattyâs ADAM software which served as the starting point for the companyâs mechanical design and NC software, first introduced in 1974 as the IDS-3. About 100 of these systems were sold before it was replaced by the IDS-80, launched in April 1980.\n\nThe IDS-80 was a traditional multi-user turnkey CAD system that used a HewlettPackard 1000F minicomputer (also called the 2117F) as its host with up to 512KB of main memory. Each workstation also included a smaller HP 1000E computer to handle local graphic functions. Since early systems used Tektronix storage tube displays, this configuration enable the software to redraw images on the displays without putting a heavy processing load on the host computer. A color raster version of the workstation using Lexidata components was introduced in 1982. An IDS-80 system with a single workstation was priced at $190,000 while a six workstation system cost about $450,000.\n\nAlthough still based on the early ADAM software, the IDS-80 incorporated a more sophisticated database capability and Gerber-developed NC software. The system was particularly adept at machining compound curved surfaces. Autopost was software used to create NC post processors. The company also marketed a finite element modeling package based upon an early version of SDRCâs Supertab software. This was partially a byproduct of a joint working relationship between the two companies in the late 1970s.\n\nIn April 1982, GST introduced the Autograph series, a lower cost single user system that also used the HP1000F. The company sold both low resolution monochromatic and high resolution color versions of these workstations which could be linked together using the IBM 2780 communications protocol. The black and white units sold for $79,000 including mechanical design and drafting software while the color unit was priced at $120,000. The NC software was particularly good and Gerberâs systems were well accepted by customers doing tool and die production.\n\n(Note lever under keyboard used to control cursor and the two 40-button function keyboards bracketing the alphanumeric keyboard)\n\nA sheet metal package developed by a user organization, Pako Corporation, was announced at AUTOFACT in November 1982 and began shipping a year later. This software, which sold for $16,800 on a IDS-80 system, unfolded a sheet metal part and automatically created a drawing with bend lines and dimensions in a single batch operation.\n\nIn April 1985, the company introduced a new system called the SABRE-5000. It was a 32-bit UNIX turnkey system that came in two versions. A low-end system was built around a Masscomp MC-500 computer, 2MB of memory, a Lexidata LEX 90 color 19-inch display with 1280 by 1024 resolution and a separate alphanumeric display. The high-end version used a Hewlett-Packard HP-9000 Series 500 computer with 3MB of memory. The Masscomp-based system, including IDS software, was $79,000 while the HP system was $98,000. Solids modeling, sheet metal design, FEA and NC software was available as options. At the time, GST was generating about $22 million in annual revenue or about 10 percent of Gerber Scientificâs total.\n\nThe SABRE systems suffered from several problems. At a time when other turnkey vendors were switching to standard workstation platforms, Gerber decided to build its own, relatively expensive, workstation. Supporting both Masscomp and HP computers with relatively low volume of each added considerable expense to the companyâs R&D.\n\nGST also marketed the SABRE-PC which included the Micro Control Systemâs CADKEY software described earlier. These system sold for $25,000 which was far more than other PC-based CAD systems.\n\nWhile the company was a serious contender for mechanical business in the early and mid 1980s, it seemed to loose momentum in the latter part of the decade. By 1990 the CAD business had faded away and this group began focusing on graphic design systems for the shoe industry. GST was then merged with Gerber Scientific Instrument to form Gerber Systems Corporation.\n\nAlthough no longer in the CAD systems or software business, Gerber Scientific continues as a viable company. Revenue from 1985 through 1994 oscillated between about $200 million and $300 million. During the past ten years revenue has climbed to over $600 million while the company has a market value of only $250 million.\n\nGRAFTEK (Graphics Technology Corporation, Unisys CAD/CAM)\n\nGRAFTEK was formed in Boulder, Colorado in 1980 by a group of software developers and marketing people previously employed by Auto-trol Technology (see Chapter 9). The initial group included Jim Starnes, Ron McElhaney and Milan Marz although Starnes kept a fairly low profile due to a legal dispute with Auto-trol in regards to his leaving that company. Venture funding was provided by American Research and Development (the company that helped start Digital Equipment), Adler and Company and Jesse Aweida, the founder of Storage Technology Corporation.\n\nWhile recruiting potential employees, McElhaney used the name âSidney Greenstreet,â an actor from the 1940s whose credits include a supporting role in âCasablanca.â Among those recruited from Auto-trol were Dick Sowar who eventually became vice president of research and development and Chad Alber.\n\nSowar was the key hire in that he had a strong background in both software architecture and graphics. Although he never completed all the requirements for a Ph.D., his thesis subject was âParametric Design in a CAD/CAM Environment.â This was nearly six years before Sam Geisberg began the development of Pro/ENGINEER at PTC.\n\nLike most companies in the CAD industry in the early 1980s, their business plan was based on both building graphics hardware and developing application software. The companyâs first workstation was the Meteor introduced in 1981. This was followed by the Meteor II in April 1985 that included a 19-inch 16-color monitor (expandable to 256 colors) with 1024 by 768 resolution and an optional graphics processor capable of handling local three-dimensional rotations as well as dynamic pan and zoom. The Meteor II could be used as a terminal for 32-bit minicomputers from Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment and Systems Engineering Laboratories with the SEL system being the companyâs preferred platform.\n\nThe companyâs primary software was GMS (Geometric Modeling Software). It was a three-dimensional wireframe and surface modeling package that used commands entered via a keyboard, function keypad or data tablet. GMS was based on MCSâ AD2000 which was a logical move considering that McElhaney had worked for MCS before joining Auto-trol and that at Auto-trol he had been responsible for implementing AD2000 for that company. Up to 20 different views of a model could be generated and selectively displayed. The drafting software included a library of âintelligent symbolsâ that could be placed, oriented and sized in drawings.\n\nGMS was complemented by analysis software, a graphics programming language called AGILE (Algorithmic Graphic Interface Language), finite element modeling software and NC software capable of handling 5-axis machine tools. A third party injection molding analysis package, OptiMold from Optimold Limited of England, was also available from the company as was a solids package, Romulus, developed by Shape Data, a subsidiary of Evans & Sutherland located in England. Eventually, GRAFTEK became Shape Dataâs largest OEM customer. Customers tended to be companies needing mechanical design and NC operations, particularly in the tool and die industry.\n\nWhile the companyâs software was well regarded within it target markets, GRAFTEK never built up the sales momentum to be considered a serious player in this industry. By 1983 it was obvious that the company was struggling and the companyâs investors hired Cy Lynch as the new CEO. It was then acquired by Burroughs Corporation in 1984 for $23 million. Shortly thereafter, Lynch resigned from the company to return to Texas and Burroughs brought in Stanley Eaton as the new CEO. Sowar stayed with GRAFTEK until 1986 at which time he left to start Spatial Technology. At its peak, the company probably had about 60 or 70 employees.\n\nA number of GRAFTEKâs developers led by Ron McElhaney left at that point and formed UNICAD with the intent of creating a software development platform that could be used to build either proprietary or commercial CAD software. He was joined by Bert Hertzog, a graphics industry pioneer and the former head of the University of Colorado Computer Center. Evans & Sutherland was a major investor in this new endeavor. UNICAD never gained much traction and McElhaney subsequently went to work for Autodesk.\n\nIn 1986, Burroughs and Sperry merged to form Unisys Corporation and GRAFTEK became Unisys CAD/CAM. In early 1992 GRAFTEK was acquired from Unisys Corporation by Gores Group[28] (Gores subsequently acquired Applicon as described in Chapter 7) which operated the company until it was sold to C-Tech, an Austrian distributor in 1996. C-Tech set up a subsidiary in Boulder, C-Solutions, that continues to maintain and support GRAFTEKâs GMS software now called GMSWorks.\n\nInformation Displays Incorporated (IDI)\n\nInformation Displays, Inc. (IDI) was one of the earliest vendors of commercial graphics hardware. Founded in 1960, the company manufactured a product line of vector refresh displays. I worked with IDI from 1965 to 1969 developing a graphics system used to control refinery operations at Lago Oil and Transport, an Exxon subsidiary, in Aruba, Netherlands Antilles. The executive vice president of IDI at that time was Carl Machover, a well respected industry pioneer and consultant.\n\nIn 1975, IDI was acquired by a Bennet LeBow, who would make an attempt to take over Prime Computer 13 years later. LeBow installed Dr. William Weksel as president and IDI switched its focus to turnkey CAD systems. Its primary product was known as the System 150 and the software, itself, as IDRAW. While IDRAW was primarily sold to AEC users, a separate version called Graphic Design/Illustrator (GDI) was sold to organizations doing technical illustrations. GDI subsequently was renamed ICAPS.\n\nThe IDRAW software had more flexibility for creating line art than most contemporary systems. It could shade lines, inset broken dimension lines, create drawings in dimetric or trimetric projections and handle multiple fonts. Line weights were display by adjusting the intensity with which the lines were displayed. Overall, the GDI/ICAPS system contained many features that are routine today but were fairly novel in 1980.\n\nThe system used a Sperry-Univac V77-600 16-bit minicomputer that supported four IDI displays. A basic system had just 32KB of memory and a 40 or 80MB disk drive although a 300MB unit with a removal cartridge was also available. This was the same hardware configuration used by Auto-trol Technology in its early systems. A single workstation system cost $150,000 while a four-seat configuration went for $300,000.\n\nIDI also took a business-like approach to financing its systems. You could lease a system for 5% of the purchase price per month with 50% of your payments going towards subsequent purchase. The company also offered a $200 per day rebate if your system was inoperable.\n\nIDI began loosing momentum in the early 1980s. In 1983, the company lost $7 million on revenues of just $10 million. In January 1983, IDI introduced a technical illustration system, CADalyst, that incorporated a new workstation built by the company along with the ICAPS software. The system was plagued with problems and never worked properly. In March 1984, control of the company was taken over by a group of investors led by Leonard Levy who immediately stop production of CADalyst systems and reduced the companyâs employment from 185 to about 100.\n\nLevy and his partners had purchased shares of IDI on margin and as IDIâs stock price dropped, they were unable or unwilling to meet margin calls. IDI filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 1984. In early 1985, the bankruptcy court changed this to a chapter 7 liquidation and the companyâs remaining assets were sold off in a series of auctions.\n\nIronCAD (3D/EYE, Visionary Design Systems, Alventive)\n\nIronCADâs roots go back to a company called 3D/EYE founded in 1981 by Dr. Donald Greenberg and Dr. John Abel, both of whom were associated with the Program for Computer Graphics at Cornell University. At the time, Cornell was one of the leading graphics research centers in the world. 3D/EYE was established to give Greenberg and Abel and their students a vehicle for developing commercial computer solutions.\n\nOne of the first such products was a structural steel design and analysis program called STEEL 3D, developed for Auto-trol Technology (See Chapter 9). For the first 12 or so years of the companyâs existence, 3D/EYE functioned as a technology boutique doing graphics software work for companies such as Hewlett-Packard. In the mid-1990s, Dr. Samir Hanna, who had been with 3D/EYE since the STEEL 3D days, realized that it was becoming feasible to develop low cost 3D modeling and visualization products that could be used by both professionals and non-professionals. The two enabling technologies were:\n\nFunctionally rich PC operating systems such as Windows 95 and Windows NT which incorporated much of the âhouse keepingâ functionality that previously application programmers had to develop and maintain.\n\nSolution vendors no longer had to develop entire products by themselves. Modular components such as geometric modeling engines could be licensed at reasonable costs. In this case, 3D/EYE decided to work with Spatial Technology and incorporated the ACIS geometric kernel into its packages.\n\nIn April 1995 3D/EYE, which by now was located in Atlanta, Georgia, got Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, to purchase a minority equity position in the company through Allenâs Vulcan Ventures investment firm. In October 1995, the company began shipping two revolutionary new products, TriSpectives and TriSpectives Professional. The software used a method of building three-dimensional models by dragging and dropping pre-made parametric shapes called IntelliShapes and then subsequently interactively refining them. Users could also build model element using traditional sketching and extrusion techniques. The packages sold for between $300 and $500, far less than SolidWorks or Solid Edge.\n\n3D/EYE started a rather aggressive marketing campaign quoting Evan Yares as saying that TriSpectives was a âPro/ENGINEER killerâ â a statement Yares denies making as quoted. While it was not a replacement for traditional CAD software, TriSpectives was an excellent conceptual design tool. Although a large number of copies of this software were sold, sales did not live up to expectations and in March 1997, the TriSpectives technology was acquired by Visionary Design Systems of Palo Alto, California. Visionary Design Systems (VDS) was founded by David Tiley, a former Hewlett-Packard salesman. Its primary business at the time was reselling CoCreate software described earlier. The 3D/EYE development staff including Samir Hanna stayed in Atlanta. A new version of the software, TriSpectives Technical, was released later that year price"
