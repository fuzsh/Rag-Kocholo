        "text": "Creator of the SPARC platform, ZFS, NFS, Java and Solaris. Part of Oracle as of 2010.\n\nWhat is the best-kept secret in the technology industry today? Consider a $5.9 billion company located in the heart of Silicon Valley, where free bagels are served up every Wednesday and employees describe their workplace as \"fun\" and \"a place to learn and really make a difference.\" Where its engineers are as well-known for their April Fool's pranks as for their technical expertise. Consider also that this company outsells its larger competitors in workstations, servers and operating software and is breaking ground as a major force in enterprise-wide computing environments, winning customer giants such as General Motors, Bank of America and Dupont Merck.\n\nWith world headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., Sun Microsystems, Inc., has been described as a \"full service provider that can compete on an equal footing with IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co.\" (InformationWeek, Feb. 13, 1995). The company was founded in 1982 on the premise that \"the network is the computer.\" This simple, yet revolutionary concept helped change the face of the computer industry and has propelled the company into a thriving $6 billion company. It's no wonder then that this Fortune 244 company continues to impress industry-watchers by reporting consistently good numbers in an industry characterized by red ink and fierce competitors. For fiscal 1995, company revenues were $5.9 billion and have averaged 15-20 percent growth over the last several years. Sun has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry with nearly $1 billion cash in the bank. It also sells more workstations than anybody else and, according to International Data Corporation, leads the worldwide workstation market with a 32 percent marketshare. While the company's legacy has been as a technical workstation supplier, Sun is successfully transforming itself into an enterprise computing firm focused on global network computing. According to Gartner Group, Sun has \"most of the building blocks to be a major competitive threat at all levels of the enterprise...Sun has many of the crown jewels to embark on a new phase of its existence.\" (March 8, 1995, MCS Research Note) The company is now poised to increase its penetration within the Fortune 1000 as it rolls out its line of UltraSPARC computers and software that helps companies easily manage and link their computer networks.\n\nThe secret of Sun's success? Hiring the best people and embracing a set of guiding principles that defy conventional wisdom. At the core of Sun's approach are its beliefs in open systems and network computing. Spearheaded by CEO Scott McNealy, the company's continued passion for \"open systems\" has been a long battle in the interest of consumers. Non-proprietary or \"open\" systems use technology interfaces or \"blueprints\" that can be freely adopted by any manufacturer. This approach encourages multiple, competing implementations, which result in innovation and increased choice for the consumer. With a proprietary or \"closed\" technology, one company has monopolistic control over that product or technology, is under no pressure to innovate and is free to charge whatever the market will bear. Sun's open computing philosophy revolutionized the computer industry thirteen years ago when it dissolved the model of proprietary computing by offering powerful, less expensive computers using off-the-shelf components. By doing this, Sun launched a new computing paradigm that forced companies to compete on efficiency and innovation.\n\nNetwork computing is the other founding principle that remains at the core of Sun's approach to computing. A favorite Sun phrase, \"the network is the computer,\" helps to describe this model. Sun believes that the vast network and resources that exist beyond a person's own computer is where the true strength of information technology lies. Unlike PCs -- which were built to enhance individual productivity -- workstations incorporate networking into its design core to allow groups of people to collaborate, thereby improving company-wide productivity.\n\nBy understanding that network management is the fundamental issue facing customers in the 1990s, Sun is focused on linking and managing enterprise-wide global networks. Through its software, hardware and service offerings, Sun is well positioned for the open, networked world that will dominate the industry over the next 3-5 years.\n\nThe Companies Within Sun[edit]\n\nSun Microsystems Computer Company (SMCC) is the network systems business and develops, manufactures, markets and sells the industry's leading family of SPARC-based workstations and servers; it integrates operating system software, network management products and service offerings from other Sun businesses. The company is best known for its high-performance workstations, since it sells more workstations than anybody else. However, its multiprocessing servers have quickly been adopted by businesses, making it the worldwide UNIX multiprocessing server leader with a 22.2 percent unit marketshare (Computer Intelligence InfoCorp 1995).\n\nSun Microelectronics develops, designs and distributes SPARC technologies and products worldwide. The division's portfolio includes microprocessors, chipsets, modules, boards, technology licenses, silicon and system design kits and consulting services. According to IDC, SPARC is the leading RISC microprocessor with a 35 percent marketshare. Sun Microelectronics operates under a fabless semiconductor business model and employs leading edge foundries to manufacture its high-performance SPARC microprocessors. Its microprocessor line includes UltraSPARC, microSPARC II and multiprocessing SuperSPARC II.\n\nSunSoft, Inc., the software subsidiary, is widely recognized for several core network computing products used by corporations for enterprise rightsizing and network computing applications: Solaris, Solstice, SolarNet, WorkShop, Solaris Desktop and objects. The Solaris operating environment is the company's flagship product and is the UNIX industry's highest-volume licensed software environment for enterprise rightsizing, with more than 2 million licenses.\n\nSunService, a key component of Sun's strategy to address the enterprise, is the leading U.S. UNIX workstation service provider with a 34 percent revenue marketshare of this $1.1 billion market, according to IDC. The company provides customers with system support, education, system integration and other value-added services and currently supports more than 500,000 systems worldwide.\n\nSunExpress is Sun's aftermarketing company and one of the fastest growing business units. The company offers convenient access to product information, presales technical assistance, quick delivery and easy ordering of over 3,500 Sun and third-party aftermarket products, including networking hardware and software, peripherals, applications and development tools.\n\nSun Microsystems Laboratories is Sun's advanced research and development lab, which explores future technologies that could help define new trends and shape our industry.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\n1982: Getting Started[edit]\n\nIncorporated in February 1982, with four employees.\n\nFirst workstation introduced.

Solstice holds the No. 1 position in the UNIX-based network management market, followed by Hewlett-Packard's OpenView.\n\nSince many companies have huge investments in PCs, Sun's SolarNet line of software gives these firms the ability to integrate and manage thousands of PCs on their networks using a single computer. PC users can work in their familiar Microsoft Windows environment and still access applications and data that reside on larger computers.\n\nSunSoft's WorkShop is a suite of software development tools crucial for businesses who need to develop object-oriented, mission-critical enterprise applications. WorkShop is available for a number of different hardware platforms so that applications can run seamlessly without regard to vendor platform.\n\nThe Solaris Desktop tools give corporate users the ability to run Windows and Macintosh applications at their desktop, providing access to the most popular PC applications, along with the power of UNIX.\n\nSun SPARCstation desktops are fast, powerful networked workstations used primarily by business and technical professionals. Unlike PCs, these workstations are designed to be workgroup-oriented and offer built-in networking, rich graphics and multiprocessing capabilities.\n\nSun SPARCserver servers are larger, more powerful computers that \"house\" shared files and run big applications for networks of desktop computers. The SPARCserver family ranges from the SPARCserver 4 -- a small, inexpensive server for a single department -- to the SPARCcenter 2000, a powerful, mainframe-like server used to manage big networks that are the backbone of corporate information systems.\n\nUnveiled in 1994, the 64-bit UltraSPARC is the first processor to deliver the multimedia and data movement requirements of today's and tomorrow's networked systems. It is the industry's only processor with on-chip multimedia support for desktop videoconferencing, real-time MPEG-2 decompression, video effects and texture-mapped triangle rendering. Its high data throughput design enables UltraSPARC to move data at a peak speed of 1.3 GBytes/second. The 5.2 million transistor design is fabricated by Texas Instruments, Inc., at its billion-dollar advanced CMOS fabrication facility in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSPARCstation[edit]\n\nLine of SPARC based workstations by Sun Microsystems.\n\nSPARCstation 1\n\nSPARCstation 2\n\nSPARCstation 4\n\nSPARCstation 5\n\nSPARCstation 10\n\nSPARCstation 20\n\nSPARCstation UPN (prototype)\n\nUltra[edit]\n\nSun Ultra 1\n\nSun Ultra 5\n\nSun Ultra 10\n\nSun Ultra 1 Creator 3D\n\nSun Ultra 10 Elite 3D\n\nSun Ultra Enterprise 1\n\nOther[edit]\n\nSun JavaStation\n\nSun 3/50\n\nSun 3/60\n\nSun 3/80\n\nSun SPARCserver 670MP\n\nMonitors[edit]\n\nSun GDM-20E20\n\nSun GDM-1962B\n\nPeripherals[edit]\n\nSun Microsystems 611\n\nSun Microsystems SunCamera II\n\nGallery[edit]\n\nAdvertisements/Promo Items[edit]\n\nDocumentation[edit]\n\nGallery[edit]\n\nCD Gallery[edit]\n\nTape Gallery[edit]\n\nSee Also[edit]"
