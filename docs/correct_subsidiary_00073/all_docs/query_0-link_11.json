        "text": "Bill Phelps retired from Booz Allen Hamilton as Executive Vice President and Senior Partner. Bill joined Booz Allen in 2016 to transform and lead Booz Allen’s Global Commercial business, which became, under his leadership, a recognized market leader, delivering cyber security consulting and incident response services to some of the most sophisticated clients in the world.\n\n​\n\nBefore joining Booz Allen, Bill spent 26 years at Accenture, finishing his Accenture career as the Global Managing Director of Accenture Security. Bill joined the Accenture security business in 2008, managing the North America practice, and took over leadership of the global practice in 2014. Under Bill’s leadership the practice grew significantly in size and scope, adding managed security services delivered via Accenture’s global delivery network in 2013 and establishing cutting edge cyber capabilities with key acquisitions, including the FusionX adversary simulation business in 2015.\n\n​\n\nIn addition to his executive roles at Booz Allen and Accenture, Bill co-founded Virginia based start-up SevenSpace in 2000. Bill and his partners established SevenSpace as a pioneer in the nascent market for remotely delivered IT managed services. Lessons from SevenSpace fueled Bill’s work at Accenture and Booz Allen building their managed security services businesses. SevenSpace was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2005.\n\n​\n\nBill is an active investor and advisor to innovative cyber security and technology companies individually and through Blu Venture Investors. He lives in Alexandria, Virginia with his wife Cathleen. Bill enjoys spending time with his three children, and getting away to the family lake house in Maine for summer boating and winter skiing."
