        "text": "B. The Stellar Performance of the Software Industry\n\nFrom time to time Microsoft's competitors seek to portray the company as a \"monopoly.\" To do so, these competitors seek to chop the computer industry into narrow segments, focusing solely upon personal computer software, where Microsoft has developed leading products in operating systems, business productivity applications, and certain other areas. Yet personal computer software is far and away the most competitive and innovative segment of the computer industry. New and innovative software products for personal computers are being introduced at a blistering pace. Prices continue to fall steadily. Output is soaring. As a result, demand for personal computers (hardware and software) is growing faster than for any other segment of the computer industry. Rapid growth attracts new competitors (witness the economic boom in Silicon Valley), which further fuels competition. As discussed below in section D, the intensely competitive nature of the personal computer industry (across both software and hardware) is attributable in substantial part to Microsoft's Windows family of operating system products, which provide an open development platform for literally thousands of other companies.\n\nAntitrust policy seeks to promote low prices, high output, and rapid innovation. On all three measures, the personal computer software industry generally  and Microsoft in particular  is a model of competitiveness.\n\nPrices. Prices for personal computer hardware and software are constantly falling, thanks in part to Microsoft's development of a standard operating system that will run software products from a wide variety of vendors. In addition, Microsoft directly spurs intense price competition through the pricing of its own products. In the late 1980s, for example, business productivity applications (such as word processors or spreadsheets) were typically distributed individually. Leading products from Lotus, WordPerfect or Microsoft typically cost several hundred dollars each. In 1990, however, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Office, a suite of business productivity applications, for one low price  and Microsoft has been rapidly improving the product ever since. Where a single Microsoft application such as Word (word processing software) cost $399 in 1990, today consumers can acquire all of Microsoft Office (which includes word processing, spreadsheet, presentations, calendaring and other functionality) for just $499 at retail. That low price drops to just $249 for anyone upgrading from any other business productivity application from any software publisher. Other software publishers such as IBM (Lotus) and Corel have created similarly priced product suites in response to Microsoft's product offering.\n\nTo take another example, multimedia software products on CD-ROMs directed at home users typically carried retail prices in the range of $80-$200 in the early 1990s. But in 1994, Microsoft lowered the prices of its CD-ROM offerings so that nearly all were available at retail for $29-$49. Microsoft's pricing helped to spur price reductions by its competitors. Today it is relatively rare to see CD-ROM offerings for home users priced above $49.\n\nSoftware, of course, is just one component of a computer system. Prices for personal computers fall every year even as personal computers offer more features and functionality to users. As recently as 1990, for example, a typical personal computer with an Intel 386 chip, 2 Mb of RAM and a 60 Mb hard drive cost $3,000. Today, $1,500 will buy a multimedia personal computer with an Intel Pentium chip, 16 Mb of RAM, a 3 gigabyte hard drive, a 12X CD-ROM  and, of course, a vastly improved operating system. In fact, multimedia personal computers with Pentium chips are available for less than $999 today, and prices continue to fall. The amazing price/performance gains of personal computers are a function of many factors, including rapidly increasing power of microprocessors, declines in memory prices, and Microsoft's licensing of its Windows operating system software at attractive prices to personal computer manufacturers.\n\nOutput. The growth of the personal computer industry has been nothing short of spectacular. Microsoft's vision is \"a computer on every desktop, and in every home.\" That vision is fast becoming a reality. Most office workers in the United States use a personal computer regularly. (Europe lags behind, and its economy suffers as a consequence.) About 40% of U.S. homes have a personal computer  a figure that hopefully will rise as personal computers continue to become more powerful, less expensive and easier to use.\n\nGrowth in the personal computer industry has been remarkable. In 1990, manufacturers shipped about 25 million new personal computers. This year, manufacturers are expected to ship 80 million new personal computers, loaded with more software than ever before.(13) And sales of new personal computers are expected top 100 million annually by the year 2000.\n\nInnovation. No segment of the world economy is more innovative and dynamic than the U.S.-based personal computer software industry. Product lifecycles are short  just twelve to eighteen months typically  as software publishers race to introduce new features and functionality at an ever faster pace. Microsoft and other vendors are now offering innovative products in categories that did not even exist two or three years ago. (Indeed, software publishers are releasing new products at such a furious pace that some large corporate customers, feeling overwhelmed by the pace of change, urge software publishers to release new products more slowly.) Today's personal computers are easier to use, more powerful and far more versatile than personal computers of even a few years ago. And the rate of innovation continues to accelerate as microprocessors become more powerful and new software products are developed to take advantage of that enhanced processing power. Before long, Microsoft Windows will enable personal computers to recognize users when they enter a room, respond (accurately) to spoken and handwritten commands, and generally serve as highly efficient communications, productivity and entertainment devices.\n\nC. Characteristics of the Software Industry that Ensure it will Remain Intensely Competitive\n\nAntitrust policy and enforcement actions in the software industry should be guided by an understanding of certain characteristics of the industry that distinguish it from many industries concerned with the provision of goods and services. Software differs from many traditional industries in six fundamental respects that insure that the software industry will always be among the most competitive.\n\n1. The Threat of Leapfrogging Innovation. In the software industry, extremely rapid and unpredictable changes constantly create new market opportunities  and threaten existing market leaders. Market shares are never secure because it is impossible to know when the next new idea will come along that could render entire product categories obsolete overnight. Few industries face this kind of intense competitive pressure, even in other parts of the high technology sector. In most parts of the economy, businesses can count on reasonably steady and predictable demand for their products. A gain or loss of a few percentage points of market share often measures success or failure. But the computer industry is full of examples of technologies and companies that enjoyed great success for a short time, only to be overtaken quickly by innovative new technology that better served users' needs. In short, Joseph Schumpeter's \"gale of creative destruction\" blows hard and fast through the software industry. There is no greater spur to innovate rapidly and price competitively than the threat that an entire business could collapse practically overnight.(14)\n\nThe astounding growth of the personal computer industry generally (and Microsoft in particular) is itself an example of this powerful phenomenon. In the 1960s and 1970s, IBM and a few other large vendors such as Sperry Rand, Honeywell, Burroughs, Control Data, and NCR led the computer industry. IBM in particular was thought by many  including many antitrust lawyers  to be invincible. (In fact, the Department of Justice filed a broad enforcement action against IBM in 1969, and pursued the case for thirteen years before dropping it.) Yet the computer industry was revolutionized in the space of a few years by hobbyists working in their garages who developed the concept of a \"personal computer.\" The personal computer was derided by many manufacturers of \"big iron\" mainframe computers as a \"toy\" (which it was, at first). IBM and others were slow to appreciate fully the potential benefits of distributing computing power to individuals. Although IBM is still a leader in the computer industry, none of the traditional mainframe or minicomputer manufacturers fully embraced personal computers in a timely way, and many faltered as a result. Today, the computer industry is led largely by companies that did not even exist twenty five years ago, such as Compaq, Dell, Gateway 2000, Micron, Microsoft, Netscape, Novell, Oracle and Sun Microsystems.\n\nWord processing provides another example of rapid and unpredictable technological change tripping up established market leaders. As cheap microprocessors became available in the 1970s, Wang, IBM and others developed computers that were dedicated to a single task: word processing. Demand for typewriters soon declined sharply, and sales of dedicated devices from Wang and IBM rose sharply. (At one time Wang was nearly synonymous with word processing.) In the 1980s, however, demand for these single-task-computing devices declined sharply, as personal computers became available that could perform a wide range of function in addition to word processing. In the space of just a few years, Wang went from market leader in dedicated word processing devices to bankruptcy. In the early 1980s, a software product called WordStar was the leading personal computer word processor. By the mid-1980's, WordPerfect became the most widely used. Today Microsoft Word is the most widely used word processor. It too will fall by the wayside if Microsoft does not continually add new features and functionality to the product, and price it competitively.\n\nMicrosoft's understanding that today's success story could be tomorrow's has-been is reflected in the company's stark rallying cry: \"Innovate or Die!\" Nowhere is that attitude more evident than in Microsoft's response to the rise of the Internet as a powerful force in computing. Since 1995, a number of Microsoft's most formidable competitors have banded together to promote a range of new Internet-related technologies that they believe will greatly reduce the value of Microsoft Windows and other Microsoft products. (Indeed, some have suggested that the entire concept of a \"personal computer\" will soon be obsolete, replaced by a new breed of \"network computers\" or \"information appliances\" that do not run Microsoft software.) Microsoft has responded by focusing its creative energies on developing a range of new technologies that it hopes will best serve users' needs in the era of Internet computing. Within the past two years Microsoft has revamped all of its major products to reflect this intense focus on the Internet, and many more technology initiatives are underway. The rapid pace of Internet-related innovation, and Microsoft's response to it, is the very antithesis of an industry in which any company has monopoly power.\n\n2. No Ownership of Productive Assets. In many traditional industries, a company that enjoys a large market share usually owns a large percentage of the productive assets used to create the product at issue. The great oil trusts of the turn of the century owned oil fields and pipelines, leading to passage of the antitrust laws. AT&T once owned the physical telephone network that connected virtually every home and business in this country. The leaders in any manufacturing industry will control a large proportion of manufacturing capacity in that industry.\n\nSoftware is different. The productive capacity of the software industry is infinite and not subject to ownership by anyone. Creating new software products does not require large capital investment in equipment. New software products are based on ideas that software developers implement in lines of code that provide instructions to a computer. No one can monopolize new ideas or the ability to capitalize on new ideas by creating new software products. Development of a new software product requires three things, all readily available: (i) software programmers (there are millions in the United States); (ii) software development tools (available from Microsoft and many other vendors for less than $2,000); and (iii) personal computers (available from hundreds of manufacturers for a few thousand dollars).\n\n3. Ability to Increase Output Quickly to Meet Demand. In many industries a company with a promising new product will require substantial capital investment and time to scale up production to meet demand, hampering the company's ability to compete with incumbent market leaders. This is not true in the software industry. Once software is created, the cost to copy it ten times, a hundred times or a thousand times is relatively small. And software publishers generally do not need to incur substantial distribution costs. Software can be distributed to computer users nearly instantaneously via the Internet and other networks  and software will increasingly be distributed in this way as electronic commerce matures and higher bandwidth networks are rolled out.\n\nThe great success of Netscape is an example of this phenomenon. In September 1994, four-month old Netscape posted an early version of its Navigator Web browser software to the Internet, free for anyone to download and use. Navigator was an instant hit, and within a few months most Web users had switched from the previous leader, the Mosaic browser. Netscape proceeded to distribute tens of million of free copies of Navigator to computer users, helping to fuel growing interest in the Internet and providing strong market position which Netscape is exploiting to sell other Internet-related software products. Netscape recently announced that it will distribute more than 125 million copies of the latest version of its Navigator software over the next year  which ought to be sufficient to satisfy demand since there are only about 50 million Internet users in the world today.\n\n4. Software Is a High Growth Business. In many industries demand remains stable or grows modestly over time, making it relatively difficult for new companies or new products to find customers. Plainly that is not the case in the personal computer software industry: The industry grew at seven times the rate of the U.S. economy overall between 1987 and 1994 (and the rate of growth has, if anything, accelerated since then).(15) As recently as 1990, revenue from all types of packaged software sold in the U.S. totaled just $35 billion. That figure is likely to top $105 billion this year  and these revenue figures understate the rate of industry growth because prices have been falling steadily over this time period.\n\nProspects for high growth also attracts capital to fund software start-ups. Venture finance capital is widely available, as is stock market financing. Hundreds of software companies have gone public in recent years. With ready sources of financing, there is no obstacle to smart people with good ideas repeating the rags to riches stories of many of today's leading software companies.\n\n5. Competition with Non-Software Products. New products offered by the personal computer industry often compete with tried-and-true ways of doing things. Personal finance software has been available for years that automates the process of balancing a checkbook, yet most people still use paper and pencil. Dozens of software products offer address book and calendar features, but here again, even many computer enthusiasts still prefer paper. And today we have tens of thousands of Web sites presenting information to Internet users, yet newspapers, books, television and radio present information conveniently and efficiently too. In many product categories, software publishers face very real competition from non-software solutions  competition that continually spurs software developers to make products more functional, easier to use, and less expensive.\n\n6. Durability of Software. Unlike consumables and many other products, software never wears out. Once acquired, software can be used forever without additional cost to the end user  or revenue to the software publisher. Thus, in a very real sense, every software publisher competes with its own products. To generate revenue from its customer base, a software publisher must substantially improve the features and functionality of its products and offer new versions at attractive prices. That, and competition from other companies, explains why product cycles in the software industry are typically just twelve to eighteen months.\n\nThe upshot of these characteristics of the software industry is that the industry is remarkably open to new ideas and new competition. As noted above, the personal computer industry itself is an example of a new idea that presented great challenges to computer vendors that had built their businesses on mainframes and minicomputers. More recently, the burst of creativity and innovation related to the Internet has spawned literally hundreds of software start-ups  some of which have already achieved great success.\n\nThe Netscape success story is a prime example. The company was formed in April 1994; it released its first product, the Navigator Web browser in September 1994; and it went public eleven months later, making an instant billionaire of one of its founders. On the day it went public  just fifteen months from the day the company was formed  it had a market capitalization of $2.2 billion. Such rapid success and value creation likely would not be possible in any industry other than software.\n\nThe rapid acceptance and deployment of the Java programming language from Sun Microsystems provides another example. Sun introduced the new language in May 1995. It was met with such interest that just seven months later Sun portrayed Java as \"the de facto standard\" for writing applications for the Internet. Microsoft recognized the importance of Java as a programming language and soon set about developing tools to assist Java programmers. Today, Microsoft's Visual J++ is one of the leading developer toolkits for creating Java programs, and Microsoft has built Java-related technology into its Windows products so that Windows will serve as a great platform for running Java programs.\n\nD. How Microsoft's Business Model Promotes Competition and Benefits Customers\n\nThe personal computer industry has enjoyed truly spectacular growth since its birth less than twenty years ago. Microsoft certainly benefited from the growth of the personal computer industry, but Microsoft has also played a fundamental role in promoting the growth of the personal computer industry. Microsoft's contribution to the growth of the personal computer industry is rooted in the basic elements of Microsoft's business model, particularly as exemplified by the company's development and marketing of its Windows family of operating system products. Microsoft Windows, coupled with the amazing performance gains of microprocessors from Intel and others, is the catalyst that has driven the development of the dynamic, intensely competitive and highly efficient personal computer industry.\n\n1. Microsoft's Business Model\n\nMicrosoft's business model is based upon three fundamental strategies: (i) rapid development of innovative software that responds to consumer demands; (ii) broad distribution of that software at attractive prices; and (iii) close collaboration with other hardware and software companies to foster development of a wide range of compatible products, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. Such variety fuels increased demand, which prompts still more innovation and competition.\n\nAll of Microsoft's efforts are driven by recognition of the vast potential of a personal computing platform. Microsoft has been at the forefront in developing personal computers from the outset, when the concept of a computer for personal use (as opposed to a mainframe housed in an air-conditioned glass room) was radical. In fact, the first widely used software program for a personal computer-like device, a version of the BASIC programming language, was written by Bill Gates in the mid-1970s. Microsoft believed from the start that as the processing power of microprocessors grew exponentially, the benefits of providing individuals with \"personal computers\" would become obvious, providing vast business opportunities. That belief proved to be correct.\n\nThousands of companies currently contribute to the growth and vitality of the personal computer industry. But Microsoft is the only company that has invested broadly and consistently in the development and marketing of a full range of software products for personal computers  computer languages, operating systems and applications, and related technologies. Microsoft's investment benefits the industry and customers by providing an open, state-of-the-art and constantly evolving computer architecture that promotes innovation and competition.\n\nRapid Innovation. Product development at Microsoft is driven by the company's firmly held belief that it must constantly innovate or it will quickly face ruin. Simply stated, Microsoft is constantly working to render its own products obsolete. In 1990, for example, Microsoft released Windows 3.0 (a 16-bit operating system built upon MS-DOS), which was the first commercially successful version of Windows. In 1989, however, before Windows 3.0 was even released, Microsoft set out to make the product obsolete by undertaking an ambitious effort to develop an all-new, 32-bit operating system from the ground up that would be free of the engineering constraints of MS-DOS (and UNIX). That operating system, later named Windows NT (for \"new technology\"), was released in 1993 and today provides an alternative to various versions of UNIX and other network operating systems. Within the next few years, Windows NT will replace Windows 95 and its successors as Microsoft's basic operating system for personal computers.\n\nThe numbers tell the story of Microsoft's commitment to innovation. Microsoft's investment in research and development has skyrocketed from about $350 million annually in 1992 to more than $2 billion this year. Microsoft far outpaces other companies in the computer industry in R&D spending relative to its size. This year Microsoft will devote about 16% of revenues to R&D. Other leading companies such as Intel, Oracle and Sun Microsystems devote only about 8% of revenues to R&D. IBM devotes just 6%. Microsoft's R&D efforts include a commitment to long-term, basic R&D that the company hopes will result in development of breakthrough technologies in the 21st century.\n\nBroad Distribution. Microsoft believes that the personal computer industry  in hardware and software  is driven by volume economics. While many vendors have attempted to exact a premium price for their products, thus limiting market demand for their technology, Microsoft has always believed that the company, the industry and customers benefit more from widespread licensing of new software products at attractive prices. In hardware, high volume provides substantial economies of scale and demand for a wide variety of product offerings, which fuels intense price and innovation competition. In software, high volume leads to widespread compatibility among computer programs and files, enabling users to share their work and communicate more readily, and provides software developers with a large base of prospective users for new products.\n\nClose Collaboration. Customers value choice and variety, so compatibility among hardware and software products is important. Microsoft works closely with dozens of leading computer companies and hundreds of smaller companies to develop technical specifications that make all the parts of a personal computer system work well together. In particular, Microsoft focuses intently on the needs of other software developers, providing those developers with a wide range of software development tools and technologies. While the collaborative process tries to marry a wide range of views and perspectives, the process works extraordinarily well for the industry and for customers.\n\nPartnerships between Microsoft and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have resulted in high standards for personal computers. Microsoft has worked closely with companies such as Compaq, Dell, Hewlett Packard and Toshiba create a standard for personal computers which ensures a high level of technology for all consumers.\n\nThe basic elements of Microsoft's business model  rapid innovation, broad distribution and close collaboration  can be understood more fully in the context of Microsoft Windows family of operating systems products."
