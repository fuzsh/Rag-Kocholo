        "text": "TOKYO and SANTA CLARA, Calif., January 12, 2010\n\nFujitsu (TSE: 6702) and Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ: JAVA) today announced an enhanced SPARC Enterprise™ M3000 server with the new 2.75GHz SPARC64™ VII processor. The SPARC Enterprise M3000 is a single socket, highly reliable, mission-critical server powered by a quad-core SPARC64 VII processor. It has many of the same mission-critical features as the mid-range and high-end SPARC64-based SPARC Enterprise servers such as mainframe-class reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) at an entry-level price. The new SPARC64 VII processor running at 2.75GHz and faster system memory modules deliver up to 23 percent better performance than the previous generation. The server's increased performance coupled with the industry leading Solaris™ Operating System (OS) provides customers with an ideal platform to handle enterprise applications including database, BIDW, ERP and CRM.\n\nThe SPARC Enterprise M3000 server helps enable customers to consolidate multiple entry-level servers into a compact 2U chassis and realize significant savings in physical space, energy consumption and cooling needs in their datacenters. In addition, the enhanced SPARC Enterprise M3000 server improves the ratio of energy consumption to application throughput by up to 13 percent compared to the previous version, helping customers further reduce their environmental footprint.\n\n\"Oracle welcomes the introduction of the enhanced SPARC Enterprise M3000 server, which is a powerful example of the over-20-year collaboration between Fujitsu and Sun Microsystems. We performed extensive testing of Oracle Database 11g Release2 on SPARC Enterprise M3000 servers running Solaris 10 ,\" said Andy Mendelsohn, senior vice president of Database Server Technologies, Oracle. \"Customers can be assured that the SPARC Enterprise M3000 server runs Oracle Database 11gR2 with high performance and reliability at lower cost.\n\n\"SPARC Enterprise M3000 is the best-suited entry-level server for all-around system use. It offers high performance and RAS features suited for mission-critical systems in a green form factor, compact and power efficiency,\" said Noriyuki Toyoki, corporate vice president of Fujitsu. With the new SPARC64 VII processor, SPARC Enterprise M3000 servers provide even more distinguished application performance and will allow customers to grow their business performance significantly.\"\n\n\"Launched just over a year ago, the Sun SPARC Enterprise M3000 server with the Solaris Operating System has been a tremendous success with our customers,\" said John Fowler, executive vice president, Systems Group, Sun Microsystems. \"With this latest release, Sun continues to deliver improved performance and value for customers. From the single processor M3000 to the high-end 64 processor M9000, SPARC and Solaris is the strategic business choice.\"\n\nThe SPARC Enterprise M3000 is a single socket, entry-level server and is part of Fujitsu and Sun's comprehensive line of servers that includes the SPARC Enterprise M4000, M5000, M8000 and M9000 servers. More information on the enhanced SPARC Enterprise M3000 server is available at http://www.fujitsu.com/sparcenterprise/ and http://sun.com/sparcenterprise.\n\nProduct Availability\n\nNew SPARC Enterprise M3000 systems are available directly from Fujitsu and Sun and their authorized resellers. Both Fujitsu-branded and Sun-branded SPARC Enterprise servers will be marketed worldwide. All features are identical."
