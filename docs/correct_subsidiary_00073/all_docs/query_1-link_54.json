        "text": "European officials gave their blessing Thursday to Oracle’s $7.4 billion takeover of Sun Microsystems, removing the last major hurdle for a deal that represents the demise of a Silicon Valley icon — and probably thousands of layoffs — while potentially creating a powerful new force in the global tech industry.\n\nThe deal would allow Oracle, already one of the world’s biggest suppliers of commercial software, to expand into the hardware and systems business.\n\nOracle said it expects to quickly finalize its purchase of Sun and begin selling a wide range of computing products for the datacenters that big businesses and government agencies increasingly use to run their operations.\n\nWhile some remain skeptical of CEO Larry Ellison’s plans, analysts said the deal could make Redwood City-based Oracle the fourth major player in a field now dominated by industry giants IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco Systems.\n\nSun has been a significant competitor in that market, but the Santa Clara company has struggled financially in recent years, posting repeated losses despite a 28-year history of tech innovation that includes powerful computer workstations, high-performance servers, the widely used Java programming language and other software.\n\n“Oracle has one of the best management teams out there in the tech industry,” said analyst Brian Marshall at the investment research firm Broadpoint AmTech. “I think they’re going to be able to optimize the business model where Sun just couldn’t do it.”\n\nThat’s likely to involve shutting down some of Sun’s less profitable product lines and eliminating thousands of jobs, particularly in overlapping areas of administration and support, according to Marshall and other analysts.\n\nSun, which had $11.5 billion in sales last year, employs 28,000 people worldwide, including more than 5,000 at its main campuses in Santa Clara and Menlo Park. Oracle, with $23 billion in annual sales, has more than 83,000 workers around the globe.\n\nNeither company would comment on possible layoffs Thursday, although Oracle said Ellison will outline his plans for reporters and analysts next week. Sun, in a memo to employees last week, denied one analyst’s prediction that up to 50 percent of Sun workers could lose their jobs.\n\n“Oracle is acquiring Sun to do something it cannot do alone — deliver complete, integrated systems. Oracle will need to rely heavily on the talents of Sun employees to achieve this vision,” the memo said.\n\nBut most analysts agree Oracle would need to make significant cuts to achieve its goal of earning $1.5 billion in operating profit from Sun in the next year. As recently as last month, Oracle co-President Safra Catz assured investment analysts that the target would be met.\n\n“We estimate Oracle will have to reduce operating expenses by approximately 30 to 35 percent” to achieve that goal, FBR Capital Markets analyst David Hilal said in a report Thursday.\n\nAlready struggling, Sun’s sales suffered further as the Oracle bid remained in limbo since it was announced in April. The U.S. Justice Department cleared the deal in August. But antitrust regulators for the European Union took more time to examine concerns that the acquisition might hinder competition in the commercial software industry.\n\nThe Europeans raised questions in particular about the fate of a Sun program known as MySQL and its potential as a low-cost alternative to Oracle’s own database software. After a months-long standoff, Oracle agreed in December to continue promoting MySQL.\n\nEuropean Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement Thursday that she was “satisfied that competition and innovation will be preserved on all the markets concerned.”\n\nIn her statement, Kroes added, “Oracle’s acquisition of Sun has the potential to revitalize important assets and create new and innovative products.”\n\nThe deal is still being reviewed by regulators in Russia and China, where MySQL advocates who oppose the acquisition have vowed to lodge further objections. But Oracle said it expects “unconditional approval” from those governments as well.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, where the deal involves two companies with deep roots and colorful histories, the demise of Sun Microsystems had been expected by many.\n\n“Sun did some fantastic things, but it went into a long, slow decline that was painful to observe. It’s kind of like the lingering death of a relative that you love,” said Rod Johnson, general manager of SpringSource, a startup that was acquired by VMware last year. SpringSource makes software based on Java, as do Oracle, IBM and a host of other companies.\n\nMore surprising is the acquisition by Oracle, which has little experience selling hardware. Oracle negotiated the deal in just three days in April, after similar talks between Sun and rival IBM fell through.\n\nIn announcing the deal, Ellison stressed the value of Sun’s software portfolio. Since then, he has said he’ll use Sun’s technology to develop high-end datacenter products in which hardware and software work together seamlessly. That’s a strategy that IBM, HP and Cisco have all embraced.\n\nSome analysts still question those plans. Forrester Research analyst James Staten said he doesn’t believe Oracle can offer a full range of datacenter products and still cut spending enough to meet the company’s financial goals. In time, he suggested, Oracle may yet decide to sell much of Sun’s hardware business.\n\nContact Brandon Bailey at 408-920-5022."
