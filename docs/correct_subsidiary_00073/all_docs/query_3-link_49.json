        "text": "It was January 2000, I had recently dropped out of university and was anxiously sitting in reception at Trans World International (IMG) waiting for my new boss Jeff Nathenson to collect me for my first real job as a researcher. I had no idea what to expect. Outside of work experience and holiday jobs, I knew very little about the real world of work. I saw the 'Financial Times on the table in front of me so quickly picked it up as thought it would make me seem smart in front of my new boss. As Jeff came to reception to pick me up, he jokingly said, “don’t pretend you’re interested in that” and my journey began. Although I loved those first few weeks – after all, I had been longing to work in the ‘real’ world for as long as I could remember – I distinctly remember thinking to myself that I had entered another universe. A place where people spoke in acronyms, and a place where everyone knew what to do except for me. We know that Gen Zs who are coming into the workforce today feel that they don’t have all the knowledge they need to get ahead in their career. As a generation that entered the world of work during the pandemic, our research shows they’re the least confident generation when it comes to navigating their professional life, and in particular, they don’t know where to start or where they can go for help. Our latest TV and social campaign in the UK and Germany highlights how our brilliant community of over a billion professionals can help people with the tools, insights, and know-how they need to navigate the world of work. They may even help you figure out what many of those acronyms actually mean! A big congrats to our brand team on a great campaign. #KnowHowOnLinkedIn #GenZ #FirstJob"
