        "text": "Since April 1961, when Yuri Gagarin first orbited the earth about 270 astronauts (predominantly males) have lived in space. More than 90 percent of these astronauts were natives of the USA and the ex-USSR. Space medicine has evolved considerably through past U.S. missions. It has been proven that humans can live and work in space for long durations and that humans are integral to mission success. The space medicine program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) looks toward future long-duration missions. Its goal is to overcome the biomedical challenges associated with maintaining the safety, health, and optimum performance of astronauts and cosmonauts. As space travel expands to include civilian populations in addition to trained astronauts, physicians and space medicine experts will need to collaborate to assess and mitigate risks to participants with preexisting medical conditions that may be exacerbated by microgravity. Standards are stricter for astronauts than for professional aviators. Exclusions are for conditions that; i) may cause acute incapacitation (e.g. coronary artery disease, renal stones, epilepsy), ii) may interact with the space environment or life support systems (e.g. bullous lung disease or asthma; incompatible with sub-aqua diving or spacewalks), and iii) are incompatible with a long duration deep space mission (e.g. may need to exclude stable chronic conditions requiring regular medication). Observations of astronauts travelling on the Space Shuttle and Russian cosmonauts' long-term visits to the Mir space station indicate that time spent in 0g has serious effects on bone and muscle physiology and the cardiovascular system. For instance, the return from 0g to 1g leads to an inability to maintain an appropriate blood pressure when in an upright position—orthostatic intolerance—and insufficient blood flow to the brain. Astronauts returning from orbit therefore have to rest for several minutes, and the time needed to normalize their blood pressure increases with the time spent in 0g. A human journey to Mars, at first glance, offers an inexhaustible amount of complexities. To bring a mission to the Red Planet from fiction to fact, NASA’s Human Research Program has organized hazards astronauts will encounter on a continual basis into five classifications. Radiation, Isolation and confinement, Distance from Earth, Gravity (or lack thereof) and Hostile/closed environments. In space, just like on Earth, medicine is of ultimate importance, and health professionals play a key role in enabling humanity to put its first footstep on the red planet. The collective action of humans in achieving travel between Earth and space has taught scientists and physicians about the impact of microgravity on human health. Very quickly bone loss, muscle atrophy, and radiation exposure were recognized as significant risks in space flight, and many steps have been taken to counteract these effect Understanding and evaluating the physiological effects of radiation and gravity require not only experiments on Earth but also extensive research on the ISS with an adequate number of animals and/or human subjects. Space travel has always been a unique exercise of combining the best of human potential to conquer incredibly complex challenges. NASA offers several warnings for people who are preparing for space travel, based on what researchers know about the human body in space. A lack of gravity doesn’t only cause bone and muscle loss, but transitioning to different gravity fields can also affect spatial orientation, head-eye and hand-eye coordination, balance and locomotion. It can even cause motion sickness. While astronauts are in space, their bodies adapt to the new environment in ways that are often pathologic. Bone demineralization, cardiovascular dysfunction, and muscular atrophy are a few of the many physiologic responses to the pathologic microgravity environment. Radiation exposure is another major hazard for astronauts. All of the above issues are exaggerated when considering a mission such as travelling to Mars. While a great number of health challenges have been identified in space travel, constant technological advances are bringing humanity closer to its first interplanetary journey. One of the first things that astronauts complain about is nausea or vomiting, This effect of the lack of gravity on the sensitive inner ear affects balance, co-ordination and spatial orientation. A lot of the body’s systems depend upon gravity to keep them conditioned, in some experiments with rats, they’ve seen up to a third of muscle from particular muscle groups being lost within seven to 10 days of flight – that’s a huge, huge loss. This also includes deterioration of heart muscle. And while it is not a problem when you are floating around in the International Space Station (ISS), it’s a mission-critical issue if you plan to land on Mars and your crew arrives, 200 million kilometres from home, unable to walk. There is growing evidence that spaceflight has a detrimental effect on the immune system. A NASA study found that the white blood cells of fruit flies flown in orbit were less effective at engulfing invading microorganisms and fighting infection than those of genetically identical flies on the ground. The main danger for human travellers is the presence of the aforementioned the presence of high-energy, ionizing cosmic ray (HZE) , because of the ionizing effect that they exert on atoms or molecules. Although they do not reach the Earth's surface because they are either absorbed by the atmosphere or deflected by Earth's magnetic field, there are already some experimental data on the cancer-inducing properties of electrons, neutrons and protons in cosmic rays and other potential deleterious effects on biological material from numerous Earth-based experiments on laboratory animals. In addition, studies of the effects of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945 pro-vided further data about the health dangers of radiation and high-energy nuclei. So, how can we satisfy our curiosity about the Solar System and beyond, and continue to investigate the nearest planets in more detail? There are three possible solutions. The first, and most obvious, is to use unmanned spacecraft to investigate the planets' surface and to land, for example, on Mars or Europa—one of Jupiter's moons—and return samples to Earth. This might very well be done within the next 10 years. While most astronaut training occurs within agencies, there are specific companies and institutions that work with both military and civilian pilots and space travelers to get them ready for space. Space continues to fascinate and excite humankind. But the costs of space exploration are incredibly high, making it difficult for NASA to secure funding as budget restraint dominates government discussions. As noted by Time, however, the benefits are also substantial; exploration “is in effect a cultural conversation on the nature and meaning of human life.”"
