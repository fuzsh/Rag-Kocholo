        "text": "The Software Report is pleased to announce its third annual list of the Top 100 Software Companies. This awards feature publication has become recognized as the leading source of information on the best companies in the software industry. Selection is based on a rigorous review of nomination feedback received, in addition to deep research into a company’s ratings on Glassdoor, G2, Capterra, and other publicly available information. The Software Report takes a holistic view, encompassing product quality, organizational effectiveness, management caliber, and ESG involvement, among other criteria.\n\nThis year’s awardees run the gamut from multinational giants with tens of thousands of employees founded as far back as the 1970s and 1980s, to well over a dozen companies that were founded within the last decade, some of which employ a few hundred. Regardless of their size or age, they are transforming the software industry in their respective categories while delivering incredible value to their customers. From cloud computing to data storage, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and workflow management, these are the companies to watch.\n\nThe following awardees were selected based on a comprehensive evaluation process, with particular focus placed this year on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts. Numerous awardees received a significant number of nominations from a range of their various stakeholders. Please join us in recognizing and celebrating The Top 100 Software Companies of 2022.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nCategory: Business Processes\n\nLocation: Redmond, WA\n\nAs perhaps the world’s most significant architect of information technology, multinational tech titan Microsoft continues to drive how we work, learn, play, and do business in the digital world. From its humble beginnings in 1975 to its current status as a household name, the company has shaped the software industry as we know it. It boasts more than 180,000 employees in its offices in dozens of countries around the world, and posted $168 billion in revenue in 2021.\n\nThere has been no shortage of records broken and distinctions earned by Microsoft and its remarkable team over its five-decade history. Over the last several years, the company has passed numerous milestones, such as its $1 trillion market cap in 2019 and $600 billion global brand value. Some of the most recent achievements by the Redmond-based innovator are its acquisitions of game company Activision Blizzard and speech recognition software maker Nuance Communications. Microsoft also continues to support digital education with its ongoing work to bring cutting-edge tech like Windows 11 SE to K–8 schools across the world.\n\n2. Adobe\n\nCategory: Publishing\n\nLocation: San Jose, CA\n\nAs one of the top software providers in the world, tech giant Adobe serves millions of users across the globe. Since its start in 1982, the company has primarily been known for its multimedia and creativity software offerings. Its popular products include Photoshop, Acrobat Reader, and Creative Cloud.\n\nAs of 2022, Adobe has more than 26,000 employees worldwide, about 40% of whom work in San Jose, California, where the company maintains its headquarters. On top of that, Adobe has field offices in about 30 countries across the Americas, Asia, and Europe. It also has major development operations in India. A long-time publisher of traditional software packages, Adobe was instrumental in the creation of the desktop publishing industry. Since then, the company has found tremendous success by adapting to shifts in the market, leading the charge into the cloud and subscription-based business model. Propelled by these digital offerings, its revenue more than doubled between 2015 and 2019. More recently, Adobe achieved record quarterly revenue of $4.39 billion in the second quarter of its fiscal year 2022.\n\n3. Twilio\n\nCategory: Cloud Management\n\nLocation: San Francisco, CA\n\nToday’s leading companies trust Twilio’s customer engagement platform to drive real-time, personalized experiences with their customers. Communication channels like voice, text, chat, video, and email are virtualized through APIs that are simple enough for any developer to use, yet robust enough to power the world’s most demanding applications. This ability to greatly enhance communication earned the company early support from the likes of Airbnb, Home Depot, Uber, and Walmart. Launched in 2008 by Jeff Lawson, Evan Cooke, and John Wolthuis, the San Francisco-based company now boasts more than 5,000 employees in 26 offices in 17 countries and counting.\n\nIn June 2016, after years of increased private funding, Twilio went public and started trading with a 92% increase on the first day. Since then, it has carried this momentum into 2022 and delivered another strong quarter to start the year, with first quarter revenue coming in at $875 million, representing 48% year-over-year growth. As of March 31, 2022, the platform has 268,000 active customer accounts, compared to 235,000 on March 31, 2021.\n\n4. Genesys\n\nCategory: Customer Management\n\nLocation: Daly City, CA\n\nFounded in 1990, Genesys is a private Silicon Valley-based software company that sells customer experience (CX) and call center technology to mid-sized and large businesses. Led by Chief Executive Officer Tony Bates, Genesys orchestrates more than 70 billion customer experiences for organizations in more than 100 countries. The company is driven by a workforce of more than 1,300 global professionals delivering innovative “Experience as a Service” solutions.\n\nGenesys has grown over time through many acquisitions, including the 2021 purchase of the Bold360 suite of digital engagement software from LogMeIn. That same year, the company raised $580 million in funding, led by Salesforce Ventures, resulting in a valuation of $21 billion.
