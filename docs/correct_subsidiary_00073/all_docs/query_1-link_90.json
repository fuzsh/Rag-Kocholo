        "text": "Steve Ballmer, CEO, Microsoft.\n\nBallmer has given Microsoft a no-holds-barred makeover, including getting into the PC business with Surface, launching a radically different version of Windows, and revamping its software for the cloud.\n\nWhile some of these plans have been off to a rocky start, particularly Windows 8 and Surface, Ballmer's got his eye on Microsoft's long-term future. Enterprises are still likely to slowly buy into his vision.\n\nJohn Chambers, chairman and CEO, Cisco.\n\nChambers has been CEO of Cisco Systems since 1995. Although he's been talking about his retirement more now than he ever has, he's still running the company with all his might. He's trying to navigate Cisco past its roots as a network equipment company becoming a bigger IT company that competes with IBM and HP.\n\nHe needs to succeed because new technologies called software-defined networking threaten the way networks will be built and Cisco's stronghold on that market.\n\nJoe Tucci, CEO, EMC.\n\nNow that Tucci has made it clear that he's not retiring anytime soon, he's free to keep building EMC into a mega-enterprise powerhouse. EMC is already the biggest player in the enterprise storage market. Under Tucci, EMC hopes to become a cloud computing powerhouse, too, with help from the past and present CEOs of EMC subsidiary VMware: Paul Maritz, and Pat Gelsinger.\n\nLinus Torvalds, creator of Linux, fellow at the Linux Foundation.\n\nTorvalds is renowned as one of the most brilliant software developers in the software world today. The operating system he created — and the open source method he helped pioneer — changed software forever. Torvalds remains at the center of it all and he's become a rock-star-like figure in the open source world.\n\nMichael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell.\n\nMichael Dell is locked into a war with some of his shareholders to let him buy back his company and take it private.\n\nDell has big plans for a post-PC company that is focused on enterprise tech. He wants to build it outside the quarter-to-quarter scrutiny of the public markets. He's also making acquisitions big and small to make it happen.\n\nSundar Pichai, Senior Vice President, Chrome and Apps, Google.\n\nGoogle’s Chrome browser and Chrome OS operating system are major parts of Google's enterprise ambitions, and they fall under Pichai's wing.\n\nHe gained more power after the sudden departure of Andy Rubin. Pichai was handed the Android unit, too. He oversees product management and engineering and is also responsible for Google products such as Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Apps.\n\nDave Duffield, co-founder, co-CEO, Workday.\n\nDuffield is the major visionary behind Workday, a cloud-based human resources app that has set the enterprise software world on fire and put Oracle on notice. Duffield has been launching successful companies for decades. He previously founded PeopleSoft in 1987 and led it until it was acquired by Oracle in 2005 via a hostile takeover.\n\nThen he turned around and thumbed his nose at Larry Ellison, launched Workday and just took it public late last year.\n\nAaron Levie, co-founder and CEO, Box.\n\nLevie built one of the hottest enterprise startups in the Valley. He turned an ordinary file sharing idea into the next big collaboration thing that big companies love. His company is now valued at over $1 billion and Levie has become one of the Valley's most watched CEOs.\n\nMarc Benioff, chairman and CEO of Salesforce.com.\n\nBenioff is a big personality with a big vision for what the next generation of enterprise tech will be. He taught the world what software-as-a-service cloud computing was all about.\n\nNow he's spending big bucks acquiring companies for his next big vision: the IT bought by chief marketing officers. He just orchestrated Salesforce's biggest acquisition ever: $2.5 billion for ExactTarget.\n\nPaul Maritz, CEO, Pivotal.\n\nAfter successfully making VMware into one of the biggest, most important enterprise software companies, Maritz has taken on a new challenge for VMware's parent company, EMC: to create a cloud computing/big data spinoff.\n\nHe's now the CEO of Pivotal. In geek speak it is a \"platform-as-a-service\" for building big data apps. In simpler terms, it intersects two big trends: cloud computing and big data, meaning it will let app developers write the type of apps that use lots data and will then host those apps.\n\nAneel Bhusri, co-founder and co-CEO of Workday and a partner, Greylock Partners.\n\nBhusri is the second-half of the dream team who co-founded Workday. He was an executive with Duffield back at Peoplesoft, staying through the onslaught of Peoplesoft's hostile takeover by Oracle.\n\nIn addition to Workday, he's helped to fund a whole crop of other hot enterprise cloud startups including Okta, Cloudera, ServiceNow, and Zuora.\n\nMartin Casado, co-founder and CTO of Nicira.\n\nCasado has rocked the enterprise tech world with a tech he created while he was a grad student at Stanford. It's called OpenFlow and it does for networks what VMware does for servers. A year ago VMware snapped up his startup, and him, for a shocking $1.26 billion. Cisco has been put on notice that Casado's tech is coming and could upend the networking giant.\n\nEveryone in the enterprise tech industry is watching Casado.\n\nDr. Werner Vogels, CTO, Amazon.com.\n\nVogels will forever be known as the IT visionary who helped Amazon create its game-changing cloud computing service. Although he didn't build Amazon's first-generation cloud, he's known as the architect of Amazon's strategy. In 2013, under Vogel's eye, Amazon is gearing up to storm the enterprise as companies spend billions of dollars on cloud services.\n\nAmr Awadallah, co-founder and CTO, Cloudera.\n\nWhen it comes to new technologies taking the enterprise by storm, none is bigger than big data. When it comes to naming the most established big data startup, Cloudera is at the top of the list. Cloudera offers a popular big data tech called Hadoop. It has also raised the most venture funds among big data startups with $141 million to date.\n\nWith such visibility Amr Awadallah — who hails from Hadoop's birthplace, Yahoo — has become a sought-after speaker at big data conferences.\n\nHasso Plattner, cofounder, chairman, SAP.\n\nBillionaire Hasso Plattner has dragged his enterprise software giant SAP into the brave new world of big data, mobile, and cloud computing, with huge acquisitions like SuccessFactors ($3.4 billion); Ariba ($4.3 billion), a hot database product called HANA, and a bunch of mobile tools.\n\nHe's now teaching the next generation about enterprise software. He was a major backer of the Institute of Design at Stanford and he created the Hasso Plattner Institute at the University of Potsdam in Berlin.\n\nMark Templeton, CEO, Citrix.\n\nTempleton has been CEO since 2001 and in that time has masterfully guided Citrix from one new market opportunity to another. Today it is one of three big contenders duking it out for a share of the soon-to-be-huge cloud computing market. It makes the underlying technology for clouds and competes with VMware and a consortium known as OpenStack.\n\nJim Whitehurst, CEO, Red Hat.\n\nWhitehurst is the down-t0-earth CEO turning Red Hat into the next big enterprise software powerhouse. First he led Red Hat to be the first and only billion-dollar pure open-source company. Now he's on a mission to turn Red Hat into a $3 billion company and move it far beyond its roots as a supplier of the Linux operating system and into the cloud.\n\nPat Gelsinger, CEO, VMware.\n\nLast September, EMC had two of its top executives get up and change chairs. Gelsinger was formerly EMC's COO running its most important tech unit. He changed seats with Paul Maritz who was VMware's CEO.\n\nGelsinger is tasked with taking VMware into a brand new era of computing. VMware wants to dominate cloud computing and a new technology called software-defined networking. SDN has the potential to completely change the way companies build their networks and VMware could swallow the lion's share of billions in new revenue that SDN is certain to create.\n\nAmit Singh, VP Enterprise, Google.\n\nGoogle wants a piece of the enterprise pie with its Google Apps, it's various cloud computing services and its Google Chrome operating system. It is Singh's job to reel in customers. Google snared Singh from Oracle, so he knows the enterprise software sales drill. His goal is nothing short of domination. He wants to grab 90% of Office users away from Microsoft.\n\nVirginia Rometty, president, CEO, IBM.\n\n\"Ginni\" Rometty has blossomed into her relatively new role as the CEO of the nation's most venerable enterprise IT company. In less than a year's time, she managed to pry her predecessor Sam Palmisano's grip off of the company, becoming CEO in January 2012, and then taking his chairman title, too.\n\nBut she has her work cut out for her. She presided over the worst quarter the company had in years, and instituted a reported big layoff. She is also struggling to bring aging IBM businesses up to snuff and still meet Palmisano's ambitious promise to investors of hitting $20 earnings per share in 2015.\n\nZach Nelson, CEO, NetSuite.\n\nNetSuite was founded in 1998, the brainchild (at least in part) of Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, before people understood cloud computing or software as a service. Nelson has been its CEO for most that time (since 2002). He's walking a fine line now between Ellison's other company, Oracle, which has recently launched into the cloud, and Oracle's biggest competitor, SAP. Nelson is helping mid-sized companies use the cloud.\n\nHe's making progress, too. NetSuite logged a record $308.8 million in revenue for 2012.\n\nMeg Whitman, CEO, HP.\n\nHP is about 18 months through a five-year turnaround. Or so Whitman tells investors and the media every chance she gets. She's been tasked with getting HP past its self-made troubles and growing again. Her first year was rocky: big layoffs, big write-offs, a near-revolt of shareholders over the botched $11 billion acquisition of Autonomy.\n\nBut she is slowly winning over investors, customers, employees. Next up: She has to deliver real revenue growth, and soon. Powerful people, like board member Marc Andreessen, are convinced she will.\n\nBill McDermott, co-CEO, SAP.\n\nMcDermott was born to be a CEO. The native New Yorker bought his first company at the age of 16 (a delicatessen on Long Island). He's been co-CEO of SAP AG since February 7, 2010 — the U.S. partner to his Danish-born counterpart, co-CEO Jim Hagemann Snabe.\n\nMcDermot is SAP's strategy and sales guru. He's fending off countless upstarts trying to break SAP's steady hold on the financial software market.\n\nSteve Wozniak, chief scientist, Fusion-io.\n\nWoz will forever be powerful and important in the tech world as the respected co-founder of Apple. He currently works for Fusion-io, an enterprise storage company that went public in 2011. Fusion-io is the poster child for a new kind of storage for enterprises that use flash tech, the same kind of storage in smartphones and thumb drives.\n\nHis company really needs Woz's star power now. It underwent a huge management shakeup where the founders were ousted and the new CEO is a man from HP involved in some of HP's rockiest moments.\n\nSimon Segars, CEO, ARM Holdings.\n\nAfter 22 years at the company, Simon Segars will become CEO of ARM Holdings in July, taking over for Warren East who turned ARM into an industry game-changer. So Segars has big shoes to fill. Low-power chips designed by ARM, and produced by many, have helped spawn the powerful mobile devices that are killing PCs.\n\nNext up for Segars is to bring ARM into data center servers, making data centers vastly more powerful while using a fraction of the space and energy. Several companies, including HP, are working with ARM on this.\n\nKevin Johnson, CEO, Juniper Networks.\n\nJuniper Networks' claim to fame is to give Cisco a hard time. It's a big rival in the network equipment industry and a big player with computer security, too. Johnson joined as CEO in 2008, after a long time spent running the Windows sales organization at Microsoft.\n\nJohnson is ready to push his company into the brave new world of software-defined networking. He bought startup Contrail Systems for $176 million just two days after it came out of stealth. This whipped up excitement and venture investment in the young tech.\n\nJohnson is also a director for Starbucks.\n\nJim Goetz, partner, Sequoia.\n\nGoetz is an enterprise-funding powerhouse. Just look at all these boards he's on: Appirio, Barracuda Networks, Clearwell Systems, eMeter, Flite, Jive Software, MetaSwitch, Nimble Storage, Palo Alto Networks, Pocket Gems, and Sencha.\n\nHe made news last year when he encouraged more startups to think about building companies that serve the enterprise instead of serving the consumer.\n\nPing Li, partner, Accel Partners.\n\nLi is one of those Valley people whom everyone-who's-anyone knows. He's big into funding cloud and big data startups and led Accel into creating a $100 million Big Data Fund, bringing in advisors from Facebook, Standford, and Bit.ly to help him run it. His investments include BitTorrent, Blue Jeans Network, Cloudera, and others.\n\nShantanu Narayen, CEO, Adobe Systems.\n\nNarayen has been CEO of Adobe since 2007, expanding Adobe beyond its roots as a graphics software maker into areas as diverse as web metrics and social marketing.\n\nHe's not afraid to be experimental and earlier this year took the brave step of radically changing the way the company charges for software, adopting a 100% cloud subscription model. There's been customer push-back, and the whole software industry is watching to see how Narayen navigates through it.\n\nMark Hurd, co-president, Oracle.\n\nHurd's boss, Larry Ellison, has a vision for Oracle's next decade. He wants Oracle to be the Apple of the enterprise, meaning a one-stop shop for software and hardware. It's Hurd's job to execute on the vision. He's been retooling Oracle's salesforce to handle the brave new world of hardware sales.\n\nHis name has also been on the shortlist to become the next CEO of Dell should activist investor Carl Icahn's bid to take over Dell prevail (though Hurd says he has no interest in that job).\n\nMike Gregoire, CEO, CA Technologies.\n\nMike Gregoire joined CA Technologies as CEO in January. He had been in retirement after selling his former company, Taleo, to Oracle in 2012 for $1.9 billion. CA is a huge and interesting challenge for Gregoire. Like other aging enterprise software companies, it needs to figure out how to shake off its dusty image and make itself relevant for the next generation of data centers.\n\nGregoire has his eye on security software for the \"Internet of Things\" and new forms of network management managing software that work well in the cloud, he told us.\n\nAndrew Jassy, Senior Vice President, Amazon Web Services.\n\nIf Werner Vogels is AWS's visionary, Jassy is the execution guy. He runs Amazon's cloud, including its two biggest services: renting computers and renting storage space. Amazon is poised to make its cloud a bigger deal to the enterprise, even potentially snagging a huge contract with the CIA.\n\nJassy previously helped Amazon get into the digital music market, too.\n\nTom Georgens, CEO, NetApp.\n\nIn the storage industry NetApp has become the Pepsi to EMC's Coke, albeit NetApp is far smaller than EMC. Georgens has been CEO since 2009. He studied at EMC's knee, spending 11 years in engineering before becoming CEO of LSI Logic's storage unit Engenio until NetApp bought Engenio for $480 million in 2011.\n\nUnder Georgens, NetApp has grown revenue from about $4 billion in 2010 to over $6 billion in 2012.\n\nFrancois Daumard, Mobility Channel Development, Apple.\n\nIn mid-2011, Daumard jumped ship from Microsoft to join Apple. He was charged with helping Apple build relationships with resellers who wanted to sell its iPhones and iPads to businesses and use them in other ways, such as with custom apps. Apple had almost no relationship with resellers before he arrived. And his progress since then has been nothing less than stellar.\n\nApple devices, particularly the iPad, are storming the enterprise these days.\n\nPat Hanrahan: co-founder, Chief Scientist, Tableau Software and Stanford professor.\n\nHanrahan is one of the biggest names in big data. The company he helped found, Tableau, which creates charts/graphs from large volumes of data and, just had a spectacular IPO. He's also a Canon professor of computer science and electrical engineering at Stanford and an advisor to a other big data startups, like Skytree.\n\nAnd he helped Pixar studios create its award-winning rendering tech, earning two Oscars along the way.\n\nFrank Frankovsky, Vice President, Hardware Design and Supply Chain Operations at Facebook.\n\nFacebook is the world's largest social network. It takes enormous amounts of computing power to let people worldwide share photos, chat and post their thoughts. Frankovsky leads a consortium that is slowly changing the way computer hardware is built, putting designs into the hands of the users (like Facebook) instead of the vendors (like Dell or HP).\n\nHe wants his organization to do for hardware what Linus Torvalds and Linux did for software, and he's having a lot of success.\n\nJohn McAdam, CEO, F5 Networks.\n\nJohn McAdam became CEO of network equipment company F5 Networks in July 2000 right before the Internet bubble burst. After that it looked like F5 was not long for this world. But he dug in and grew the company's revenue from $108.6 million to more than $1 billion. Today F5's stock trades for about $75 with a market cap of nearly $6 billion which has allowed it to go shopping, including snapping up SDN startup LineRate in February.\n\nDiane Bryant, general manager Data Center and Connected Systems Group, Intel.\n\nIntel is struggling to redefine itself in a post-PC world, where so many devices run on low-power chips from competitor ARM Holdings.\n\nDiane Bryant runs one of the units in Intel's stronghold, the chips that run nine of every 10 servers sold worldwide, generating more than $10 billion in revenue in 2012. These chips will also power next-generation enterprise and cloud servers as well as storage and networks.\n\nScott Sandell, General Partner, NEA.\n\nBefore becoming a VC, Scott Sandell worked at Microsoft, helping to create Microsoft's popular PC operating system, Windows 95. Since he's become a VC, he's shown up at the center of many of the enterprise industry's biggest deals. He was an early investor in Workday, 2012's biggest enterprise IPO. He also backed Nicira, (bought by VMware for $1.26 billion), Fusion-io (2011 IPO), and Tableau Software (2013 IPO).\n\nHis current startup roster includes CloudFlare, Blue Jeans Network, BloomReach, and MuleSoft.\n\nNir Zuk, cofounder, CTO Palo Alto Networks.\n\nSuccess follows Nir Zuk around. Palo Alto Networks was one of the hot enterprise IPOs in 2012.\n\nIn his early days at Check Point Software, Nir actually helped invent the firewall industry that Palo Alto Networks disrupts. Nir was also CTO at firewall-maker NetScreen Technologies, acquired by Juniper Networks in 2004 for $4 billion. He co-founded another security company before that, OneSecurePrior.\n\nMaynard Webb, chairman of LiveOps, interim chairman of Yahoo, venture capitalist.\n\nMaynard Webb has a long and storied career and he still seems to be everywhere these days.\n\nHe is the former CEO and current chairman of the board at cloud contact center firm LiveOps, a board member at Salesforce.com, the interim chairman of Yahoo and a well-known Angel investor. Some call him a super angel. He's also credited with helping eBay become a multi-billion company under his mentor, Meg Whitman.\n\nAs an investor, some of his successes include Peribit (acquired by Juniper Networks) and AdMob (acquired by Google). Through his Webb Investment network fund, he's backed such companies as Badgville, Diffbot, Nebula, and Okta.\n\nRussell Bryant, Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat.\n\nBryant is the leader of the OpenStack Technical Committee, an elected position within the OpenStack Foundation. OpenStack is a free and open-source cloud operating system that competes with Amazon and VMware.\n\nBig companies like Red Hat, IBM and HP have banked their futures on it and the stakes are huge. The public cloud market will generate $131 billion this year alone, Gartner says. Much of that rests on the shoulders of Bryant and his committee.\n\nGreg Kroah-Hartman, Fellow, Linux Foundation.\n\nGreg Kroah-Hartman is one of most powerful people in the world of Linux, second only to his buddy Linus Torvalds, it's creator. It's Kroah-Hartman's job to maintain what's known as the \"stable\" branch of Linux, that's the one deployed in data centers around the world.\n\nBefore working full time for the Linux Foundation, he worked on Novell's version of Linux, known as SUSE.\n\nLike Torvalds, Kroah-Hartman has his share of fans and groupies — young open source developers who want to grow up to be just like him. He's an author and popular public speaker, too.\n\nRoman Stanek, founder and CEO, GoodData.\n\nOne of the hottest big-data startups is Roman Stanek's GoodData. In 2012 it increased revenue five-fold, and closed 40 six-figure deals. It now boasts 8,000 clients, including GE, Pandora, and Time Warner Cable. GoodData's investors include Andreessen Horowitz and famed technology analyst/conference organizer Esther Dyson. It's raised over $75 million from investors to date.\n\nStanek is a good bet. He's started more than five companies and is best known for founding NetBeans, sold to Sun Microsystems in 1999, and Systinet, sold to Mercury Interactive in 2006 for $105 million."
