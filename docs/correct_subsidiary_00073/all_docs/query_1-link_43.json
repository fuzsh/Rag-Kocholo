Party is identified as Microsoft Corporation.\n\n2. a) The information disclosed under this Agreement (\"Information\") includes the following:\n\nSun Information: business information related to Java products as associated technology, Java product licensing practices and fees, research and development plans, customers, and marketing and future business plans.\n\nParty Information: use of Java technology in Microsoft products.\n\nb) The permitted use of Information is for the purpose of exploring business possibilities between Sun and Party.\n\n3. This Agreements covers only Information which is disclosed between the Effective Date and twelve (12) months thereafter. Each party's obligations regarding Information expires three (3) years after the date of disclosure (except for Sun source code, which shall be protected in perpetuity). Information shall be used solely as permitted above, and shall not be disclosed to a third party other than a subsidiary, agent, or subcontractor of the receiving party who has agreed to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Each party shall protect Information of the other party using the same degree of care, but not less than a reasonable degree of care, as such party to protect its own confidential information. Upon termination of this Agreement or the disclosing party's written request, the receiving party shall cease use of Information and return or destroy all information.\n\n4. Each party shall be obligated to protect only Information: (a) disclosed in tangible form clearly labeled as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure; or (b) disclosed in non-tangible form, identified as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure, and summarized in writing, designated as confidential or proprietary, and delivered to the other party within thirty (30) days after disclosure.\n\n5. This Agreement imposes no obligation upon the receiving party with respect to Information which: (a) was in the possession of, or was known by, the receiving party prior to its receipt from the disclosing party, without an obligation to maintain its confidentiality; (b) is or becomes generally known to the public without violation of this Agreement; (c) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party, without an obligation to keep such information confidential; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of Information.\n\n6. Disclosure of the other party's Information is not prohibited if prior notice is given to the other party and such disclosure is: (a) compelled pursuant to a legal proceeding or (b) otherwise required by law. Information is delivered \"AS IS,\" and all representations and warranties, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, and noninfringement, are hereby disclaimed. Neither party has an obligation to sell or purchase any item from the other party. Neither party shall be liable for any special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages by reason of any alleged breach of this Agreement based on any theory of liability. Nothing is this Agreement shall be construed as a representation that the receiving party will not develop or acquire information that is the same as or similar to Information, provided that the receiving party does not do so in breach of this Agreement. The receiving party agrees that any breach of this Agreement will result in irreparable harm to the disclosing party for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, the disclosing party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction, in the event of such breach. The receiving party does not acquire any rights in Information, except the limited rights to use Information as described above.\n\n7. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning its subject matter. All additions or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and must be signed by an authorized representative of each party. The parties agree to comply strictly with all applicable export control laws and regulations. Any action relating to this Agreement will be governed by California law, excluding choice of law rules.\n\nSUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC.,\n\nby and through the\n\nJAVA PRODUCT GROUP\n\nBy\n\nName\n\nTitle\n\nPARTY:\n\nMICROSOFT CORPORATION\n\nBy\n\nName\n\nTitle\n\nEXHIBIT D\n\nDOCUMENT TYPE DEFINITION\n\nIn order to ensure interoperability between all Java compliant browsers, SUN needs to define the exact notation of applets in HTML documents. The format of the APPLET tag is chosen to be implementation language independent and SGML compliant. SGML compliance is important if the APPLET tag is to be accepted as part of the HTML standard in the future.\n\nExample:\n\n<applet codebase=\"http://java.sun.com/people/avh/classes\"\n\ncode=\"BounceItem.java\" width=400 height=300>\n\n</applet>\n\nThe applet tag has the following attributes:\n\nCODEBASE\n\nThe base URL of the applet. The applet's code is located relative to this URL. If this attribute is not specified, it defaults to the document's URL.\n\nCODE\n\nThe file in which the applet is located. This file is relative to base URL of the applet. It cannot be absolute.\n\nALT\n\nAlternate text which can be displayed by text only browsers.\n\nNAME\n\nThe symbolic name of the applet. This name can be used by applets in the same page to locate each other.\n\nWIDTH\n\nRequired attribute which specified the initial width of the applet in pixels.\n\nHEIGHT\n\nRequired attribute which specified the initial height of the applet in pixels.\n\nALIGN\n\nThe alignment of the applet, similar to the img tag.\n\nVSPACE\n\nThe vertical space around the applet, similar to the img tag.\n\nHSPACE\n\nThe horizontal space around the applet, similar to the img tag.\n\nNote that the position of the applet in the page is determined by width, height, align, vspace and hspace attributes just like the img tag.\n\nApplets can access the above attributes using the getParameter() method call defined in the Applet class. All attribute/parameter names are automatically folded to lower case. Applets that require parameters in addition to the peredefined ones need to use the param tag. It is unfortunately not legal in SGML for a tag to have an arbitrary list of attributes. That is why additional applet parameters explicitly using the PARAM tag have to be named. For example:\n\n<applet code=\"DateItem.class\" alt=\"The Date\" width=200 height=40>\n\n<param name=\"speaker\" value=\"avh\">\n\n<param name=\"translator\" value=\"DutchTime\">\n\n</applet>\n\nIn addition to the ALT tag, Licensee can include additional text and markup before the applet end tag. Java compliant browsers will ignore this text, but browsers that do not understand the applet tag will display it instead of the applet. For example:\n\n<applet codebase=classes code=ImageLoop.class width=100 height=100>\n\n<param name=imgs value=\"images/duke\">\n\nIf Licensee were using a Java enabled browser, Licensee would see an animation instead of this static image.<p>\n\n<img src=images/duke/T1.gif\">\n\n</applet>\n\nBelow is the formal SGML DTD for the APPLET and PARAM tags.\n\n<!ELEMENT APPLET - - (PARAM*, (%text;)*)>\n\n<!ATTLIST APPLET\n\nCODEBASE CDATA #IMPLIED --code base--\n\nCODE CDATA #REQUIRED --code file--\n\nALT CDATA #IMPLIED --alternative string--\n\nNAME CDATA #IMPLIED --the applet name--\n\nHEIGHT NUMBER #REQUIRED\n\nALIGN (left|right|top|testtop|middle| absmiddle|baseline|bottom|absbottom) baseline\n\nVSPACE NUMBER #IMPLIED\n\nHSPACE NUMBER #IMPLIED<\n\n>\n\n<!ELEMENT PARAM - O EMPTY>\n\n<!ATTLIST PARAM\n\nNAME NAME #REQUIRED --The name of the parameter--\n\nVALUE CDATA #IMPLIED --The value of the parameter--\n\n>\n\nEXHIBIT E\n\nTRADEMARK LICENSE\n\nJAVA-Compatible Logo\n\nLICENSOR\n\nSUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC.\n\n2550 Garcia Avenue\n\nMountain View, CA 94303\n\nU.S.A.\n\n(415) 960-1300\n\nLICENSEE\n\nTRADEMARK LICENSE\n\nThe following terms and conditions (\"License\") are incorporated by reference into that certain Technology License and Distribution Agreement (\"TLDA\") between SUN and Licensee of even date herewith. In the case of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the TLDA, the terms of the TLDA shall apply. Terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning given such terms in the TLDA. The parties agree that:\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n1.1 \"Branded Product\" means all online software or tangible copies or units of any version of Licensee's Products being distributed in association with the Compatibility Logo.\n\n1.2 \"Compatibility Logo\" means the Java-compatible logo supplied by SUN to Licensee from time-to-time.\n\n1.3 \"Products\" means the \"Products,\" as defined in the TLDA.\n\n2. GRANT OF LICENSE\n\nSUN grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, personal, license to use the Compatibility Logo (\"License\") as provided herein with respect to each of the Products that fully meet the certification requirements of Section 3. Licensee is granted no other right, title, or license to the Compatibility Logo or any other SUN trademark, and is specifically granted no right or license to sublicense the Compatibility Logo or any other SUN trademarks; provided, that this License shall apply and pass through to Licensee's distributors who distribute Licensee's Products as transferred by Licensee (i.e., without any modifications to the Product, product packaging, documentation or other materials) (\"Distributors\"). Licensee shall enforce the terms of the License with Distributors. SUN shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this License directly against any Distributor in the event Licensee fails to do so. All subsequent references herein to \"Licensee\" shall include and apply to \"Distributors.\"\n\n3. CERTIFICATION\n\nThis License applies only to versions of Licensee's Products that have successfully passed the Java Test Suites made available by SUN to Licensee pursuant to the TLDA, and which otherwise fully comply with all other compatibility and certification requirements of the TLDA. Upon thirty (30) days written notice by SUN no more than two (2) times per calendar year, Licensee shall permit SUN to inspect and test any Branded Products at a mutually-agreeable location to ensure that they meet the compatibility requirements of the TLDA. Upon request by SUN, Licensee shall promptly make any modifications to any version of a Branded Product necessary for it to meet such compatibility requirements, taking into account the size of Licensee's organization, the nature of the Product, and the number of units in the retail channel .\n\n4. LOGO AND TRADEMARK USAGE\n\nLicensee agrees that during the Term of the TLDA, it shall display the Compatibility Logo:\n\n(a) On external product packaging for the following Products sold through the retail channel: (i) All of Licensee's development tool Products (e.g., Microsoft Visual C++) and (ii) Microsoft Internet Explorer when shipped on a stand alone basis and not as an add-on product to another Licensee product or service or part of a bundle with another Licensee product or service.\n\n(b) On external product packaging for any other of Licensee's Products sold through the retail channel if the Technology is described on such external product packaging; and\n\n(c) In written end-user documentation for Licensee's Products that describes the Technology;\n\n(d) In on-line versions of end-user documentation for Licensee's Products that describes the Technology.\n\nLicensee agrees that with respect to such uses, it shall use only the Compatibility Logo artwork provided by SUN. The parties understand and agree that Licensee shall not display the Compatibility Logo more prominently or larger than Licensee's company name/logo and product name/logo, wherever displayed. SUN agrees that under no circumstances shall Licensee be obligated to display the Compatibility Logo on product packaging for Microsoft Windows 3.x, Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows NT, or any new versions, upgrades or successors to such Products, except with respect to Section 4(b), above.\n\nLicensee shall comply with the current versions of the Sun Trademark & Logo Policies [http://java.cun.com/tm_guidelines.html], including but not limited to using the Java mark as an adjective followed by generic descriptors, marking the Java mark with a symbol, and attributing the Java mark as a trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in a legend on packaging, splashscreens, web page, and other collateral and materials; provided, that Licensee's adherence to the foregoing requirements shall be to the extent that such requirements are consistent with Licensee's general trademark practices as to third party trademarks, as modified from time to time, and as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Nothing herein shall circumscribe Licensee's right to make fair, referential, comparative, descriptive or other references as permitted by applicable law.\n\n5. PROTECTION OF TRADEMARKS AND LOGOS\n\nSUN is the sole owner of the Compatibility Logo and all goodwill associated therewith. Licensee's use of the Compatibility Logo inures solely to the benefit of SUN. Licensee shall not knowingly and intentionally do anything that might harm the reputation or goodwill of the Compatibility Logo. Licensee shall not challenge SUN's rights in or attempt to register the Compatibility Logo. Licensee shall take no action inconsistent with SUN's rights in the Compatibility Logo. If at any time Licensee acquires any rights in, or registrations or applications for, the Compatibility Logo by operation of law or otherwise, it will immediately upon request by SUN and at no expense to SUN, assign such rights, registrations, or applications to SUN, along with any and all associated goodwill. SUN may at its option commence, prosecute or defend any action or claim concerning the Compatibility Logo in the name of SUN or Licensee, or join Licensee as a party thereto. SUN shall have the right to control any such litigation. Licensee shall not commence any action regarding the Compatibility Logo. SUN shall reimburse Licensee for the reasonable costs associated with providing such assistance, except to the extent that any such costs result from a breach of the License by Licensee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction rules that the Compatibility Logo or some constituent element is not protectable or is otherwise available for a party other than SUN to use, Licensee shall either not be circumscribed to any greater extent than such third party or shall be permitted to use the Compatibility Logo or its constituent element as permitted by such court of administrative body ruling."
