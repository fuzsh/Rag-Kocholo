LeVecchio\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board\n\nPlano, Texas\n\nJuly 15, 2024\n\nImportant Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on August 27, 2024: This proxy statement and the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K are available at www.intrusion.com.\n\nINTRUSION INC.\n\n101 EAST PARK BLVD, SUITE 1200\n\nPLANO, TEXAS 75074\n\nPROXY STATEMENT\n\nfor\n\nANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS\n\nto be Held August 27, 2024\n\nThe enclosed proxy (the “Proxy”) is being solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Intrusion Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Meeting”) to be held on Thursday, August 27, 2024 at 9:00 a.m., Central Time. Proxies, together with copies of this Proxy Statement and a copy of the Company’s Annual Report for 2023, are being mailed on or about July 15, 2024, to stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Meeting. The Meeting will be held entirely online live via audio webcast. You will be able to attend the virtual Meeting live, vote electronically, and submit your questions during the Annual Meeting via live webcast by visiting: www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/INTZ2024 and entering your 16-digit control number included in your Notice (as defined below), on your proxy card, or on the instructions that accompanied your proxy materials.\n\nExecution and return of the enclosed Proxy will not affect a stockholder’s right to attend the virtual Meeting and to vote electronically. Any stockholder executing a Proxy retains the right to revoke such proxy at any time prior to exercise at the virtual Meeting. A Proxy may be revoked by delivery of written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company, by execution and delivery of a later Proxy or by voting the shares electronically at the virtual Meeting. If you attend the Meeting and vote electronically, your proxy will be revoked automatically and only your vote at the Meeting will be counted. Virtually attending the Annual Meeting alone, however, will not revoke your proxy unless you specifically request your proxy to be revoked. If you hold shares through a broker, bank or other agent, you must contact that broker, bank or other agent directly to revoke any prior voting instructions. A Proxy, when executed and not revoked, will be voted in accordance with the instructions thereon. In the absence of specific instructions, Proxies will be voted by those named in the Proxy “FOR” the election as directors of those nominees named in the Proxy Statement, “FOR” the approval of each of the other proposals described in this Proxy Statement, and in accordance with their best judgment on all other matters that may properly come before the Meeting.\n\nThe enclosed form of Proxy provides a method for stockholders to withhold authority to vote for any one or more of the nominees for director while granting authority to vote for the remaining nominees. The names of all nominees are listed on the Proxy. If you wish to grant authority to vote for all nominees, check the box marked “FOR.” If you wish to withhold authority to vote for all nominees, check the box marked “WITHHOLD.” If you wish your shares to be voted for some nominees and not for one or more of the others, check the box marked “FOR” and indicate the name(s) of the nominee(s) for whom you are withholding the authority to vote by writing the name(s) of such nominee(s) on the Proxy in the space provided.\n\nRECORD DATE AND VOTING SECURITIES\n\nOnly stockholders of record at the close of business on July 3, 2024, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting. The stock transfer books of the Company will remain open between the record date and the date of the Meeting. A list of stockholders eligible to vote at the Meeting will be available for review during our regular business hours at our headquarters in Plano, Texas, for the ten days prior to the date of the Meeting for any purpose related to the Annual Meeting. The list of stockholders will also be available during the Meeting through the Annual Meeting website for those stockholders who choose to attend. On the record date, the Company had 5,436,629 outstanding shares of Common Stock, $0.01 par value (the “Common Stock”) held of record by 102 holders.\n\nQUORUM AND VOTING\n\nThe presence at the virtual Meeting, in person or by Proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding is necessary to constitute a quorum. Holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held on each matter to be voted on at the Meeting including the election of directors. All votes will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the Meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions, and broker non-votes. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. Abstentions will be counted towards the tabulations of votes cast on matters presented at the Meeting and will have the same effect as negative votes (other than the election of directors) whereas broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a matter has been approved.\n\nSTOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS\n\nAssuming the presence of a quorum, the following paragraphs describe the vote required by the stockholders of record to approve each of the proposals set forth in this Proxy Statement.\n\n·Proposal One. The five (5) nominees receiving the greatest number of votes of the shares of Common Stock outstanding present in person or represented by Proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote shall be deemed elected even if they receive the affirmative vote of less than a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding entitled to be voted at the Meeting. ·Proposal Two. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding present in person or represented by Proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote is required for the ratification of the appointment of Whitley Penn LLP as independent auditors. ·Proposal Three. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Shares of Common Stock outstanding present in person or represented by Proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote is required for an amendment to the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares reserved under the Plan from 125,000 to 2,500,000. ·Proposal Four.

Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed the audited financial statements in the Annual Report with management including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nThe Audit Committee has discussed with Whitley Penn LLP, the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to the Company, who are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under generally accepted auditing standards. In addition, the Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from Whitley Penn LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Whitley Penn LLP’s communications with the Audit committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with Whitley Penn LLP its independence.\n\nThe Audit Committee discussed with Whitley Penn LLP the overall scope and plans for their audit. The Audit Committee meets with Whitley Penn LLP, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company’s internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company’s financial reporting. The Audit Committee held four meetings during fiscal year 2023.\n\nIn reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board (and the Board has approved) that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee and the Board have also recommended, subject to stockholder ratification, the selection of Whitley Penn LLP as the Company’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nAUDIT COMMITTEE\n\nof the Board of Directors\n\nKatrinka B. McCallum, Audit Committee Chair\n\nJim Gero, Audit Committee Member\n\nGregory K. Wilson, Audit Committee Member\n\nREPORT OF COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\n\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for administering the compensation programs of the executive officers. The Compensation Committee sets performance goals and objectives for the Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers, evaluates their performance with respect to those goals and sets their compensation based upon the evaluation of their performance. In evaluating executive officer pay, the Compensation Committee may consider recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer with respect to goals and compensation of the other executive officers. The Compensation Committee also periodically reviews director compensation. All decisions with respect to executive and director compensation are approved by the Compensation Committee and recommended to the full Board for ratification.\n\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for administering all of the Company’s equity-based plans. The Compensation Committee also periodically reviews compensation and equity-based plans and makes its recommendations to the board with respect to these areas.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Compensation Committee that the executive compensation policies and plans, including, without limitation, the Amended Intrusion Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended, and the Intrusion Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and proposed amended thereof in this Proxy, provide the necessary total remuneration program to properly align the Company’s performance and the interests of the Company’s stockholders through the use of competitive and equitable executive compensation in a balanced and reasonable manner, for both the short and long-term.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE\n\nof the Board of Directors\n\nJames F.

The individuals listed below have been determined by the Company to be its “Named Executive Officers” for fiscal year 2023.\n\n2023 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE (1)\n\nName and Principal Position Year Salary Bonus Stock Awards Option Awards (2) All Other Compensation (3) Total Anthony Scott 2023 $318,750 $– $– $139,157 $– $457,907 President and CEO, Director 2022 $425,000 $– $– $– $– $425,000 Kimberly Pinson (4) 2023 $236,250 $– $– $70,615 $– $306,865 Chief Financial Officer 2022 $135,000 $– $– $78,178 $– $213,178 T.

These columns have been omitted from the table. (2)Represents the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718. The FASB ASC Topic 718 full grant date fair value will be expensed and reported as the option vests for the Named Executive Officer. A complete discussion of the assumptions used to calculate such values can be found in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which accompanies this Proxy Statement. (3)This amount includes the annual employer matching contributions under the Company’s tax qualified Section 401(k) Savings Plan. (4)Ms. Pinson was appointed Chief Financial Officer effective May 2022.\n\nBase Salary\n\nThe salaries of the executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, are determined annually by the Compensation Committee with reference to the following without specific weighting:\n\n·salaries paid to executives with similar responsibilities at companies of a comparable size and sales volume, primarily in the high technology industry; ·each officer’s performance; and ·the Company’s overall financial results.\n\nThe Compensation Committee believes that other companies likely compete with the Company for executive talent and that the Company must offer salaries within a competitive market range to attract and retain talented executives. However, the Compensation Committee manages salaries for the executive group as a whole in a conservative fashion in order to place more emphasis on incentive compensation.\n\nBonus\n\nTo reinforce the attainment of corporate objectives, the Compensation Committee believes that a substantial portion of the potential annual compensation of each executive officer should be in the form of short-term, variable incentive pay. The incentive cash bonus program for executives is established annually by the Compensation Committee based upon the Company’s achievement of sales and/or earnings targets established at the beginning of the fiscal year. The incentive plan for executives requires a threshold level of Company financial performance before any incentives are awarded. Once the threshold objective for sales and/or earnings for a fiscal year is reached, specific formulas are in place to calculate the actual incentive payment for each executive for such year.\n\nBonuses Awarded\n\nIn fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the Company did not achieve its targeted sales and/or earnings goals and did not reach its threshold level of sales and/or earnings for bonuses. Per the employee incentive plan, the Company did not award full-time, non-commissioned employees a bonus. This included our current executive officers.\n\nStock Option and Equity Incentive Programs\n\nThe goal of the Company’s short- and long-term equity-based incentive awards is to align the interests of executive officers with the Company’s stockholders. The Compensation Committee determines the value allocated to equity-based incentives according to each executive’s position within the Company, individual performance, contributions to achievement of corporate objectives and related factors, and grants equity awards to create a meaningful opportunity for stock ownership. The Board approves short- and long-term incentives in the form of cash, stock option grants, restricted stock issuances, and performance stock unit awards when performance meets or exceed expectations. However, such incentive awards are never made during black-out periods or at such times when the Company is in possession material, non-public information.\n\nEquity Awards Granted\n\nThe Company grants equity awards to the executive officers and key employees in order to retain their services and increase their performance potential to help attain long-term goals of the Company. However, there has been no set formula for the granting of awards to individual executives or employees. In 2023 and 2022, the Company has granted stock options to purchase 31,420 and 16,675 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, respectively. Of these amounts, options to purchase 14.441 and 2,250 shares have been granted to the Named Executive Officers or the Board of Directors during 2023 and 2022. During fiscal year 2023 and 2022, the Company issued no restricted stock to the Named Executive Officers.\n\nTiming of Awards\n\nEquity awards to executive officers and other key employees are typically granted annually in conjunction with the review of the individual’s performance. This review typically takes place in January. Grants to newly hired employees are typically effective at the first Compensation Committee meeting following the employee’s first day of employment, after approval by the committee. The exercise price of all stock options is set at the then current day’s closing price of the Common Stock.\n\nStock Ownership Guidelines\n\nThe Company does not have any standard stock ownership guidelines. However, all executives are encouraged to retain stock options and other shares that they directly own.\n\nPerquisites\n\nThe Company limits the perquisites that are made available to executive officers. The Company does not have a pension program for executives or employees.\n\nThe perquisites provided by the Company in fiscal year 2023 are as follows. All employees who participated in the Company’s 401(k) plan may receive up to $2,700 in matching funds. All of the Named Executive Officers who participated in the 401(k) plan received matching funds. The health and life insurance plans are the same for all employees. In general, all employees and dependents base health premiums are paid 72% by Intrusion and 28% by the employees. All employees are also provided life insurance up to $50,000. This policy is the same for all employees, including executive officers.\n\nEmployment Agreements\n\nNeither the Company nor its subsidiaries have any employment agreements with any of its Named Executive Officers other than an Executive Employment Agreement, dated November 11, 2021, between the Company and Anthony Scott. The material terms of this Employment Agreement are as follows: a $425,000 annual cash salary; a one-time restricted stock award equivalent to $75,000 of common stock based on the closing price as of November 11, 2021; the ability to earn up to two times his annual salary (in cash or a combination of cash and stock option awards) under the terms of the Company’s existing executive incentive based bonus plan; the ability to participate in the Company’s long-term incentive plan; as well as other reasonable and customary benefits provided by the Company. In addition, the Employment Agreement requires that the Board nominate Mr. Scott for election as a director at the Annual Meeting.\n\nOn March 27, 2023, the Board approved an amendment to the Executive Employment Agreement. The amendment effected a change to Mr. Scott’s compensation package (the “Amendment”). The Amendment provided for a temporary 50% reduction of Mr. Scott’s annualized base salary during the period beginning March 24, 2023, to September 22, 2023, equal to $106,250 and granted an award of options to purchase 6,586 shares of Common Stock of Intrusion, Inc. The options vest one-year from the date of the award and state an exercise price of $24.20 per share.\n\nLong-term Incentive Plan\n\nNo long-term incentive has been awarded in 2023 or 2022.\n\nOutstanding Equity Awards at the End of Fiscal Year 2023\n\n2023 OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT FISCAL YEAR-END TABLE\n\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to the options outstanding by the Named Executive Officers held at fiscal year-end.\n\nOption Awards Stock Awards Number of Number of Securities Securities Number of Market Underlying Underlying Option Option Shares Value Unexercised Unexercised Exercise Exercise or Units Shares or Options Options Price Date Not Vested Units Vested Name (#) (#)(1) ($) (2) (#) ($) Exercisable Unexercisable Not Vested Not Vested Anthony Scott – 6,586 24.20 3/21/2033 – $– Kimberly Pinson 417 834 69.00 11/10/2032 – $– – 3,342 24.20 3/21/2033 – $– T.

In addition, our net loss during the two-year period ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 14%, from $(16,229) in 2022 to $(13,891) in 2023 compared to the aforementioned changes in “compensation actually paid” to our CEO and non-CEO NEOs.\n\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\nOverview of Compensation and Procedures\n\nSimilarly, to the setting of executive compensation, the Compensation Committee reviews the level of compensation of non-employee Directors on an annual basis. The Company has historically used data from a number of different sources to determine the compensation for non-employee Directors. Some examples of the data used include publicly available data describing director compensation in peer companies and survey data collected by the Company.\n\nWe compensate non-employee members of the Board through a mixture of cash and equity-based compensation. Each non-employee Director currently receives an annual cash retainer fee of $37,500. In addition, our Chairman receives an annual fee of $40,000 for his service, the Audit Committee Chair receives an additional annual fee of $18,000, the Compensation Committee Chair receives an additional annual fee of $12,500 and the Nominating and Governance Chair receives an additional $7,500 for their service. During 2023 the Board voluntarily exchanged a portion of their annual fees for stock options. Each non-employee Director is also reimbursed for all reasonable expenses incurred in attending such meetings. Directors who are also full-time employees of the Company receive no additional compensation for serving as directors. During 2023, Mr. Scott, our President and Chief Executive Officer, served on the current Board with no additional compensation.\n\nSince the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, it has been the Company’s practice to provide each non-employee director with restricted stock awards of the Company’s Common Stock at the Annual Meeting in an amount equal to $70,000 determined by the closing price of the Company’s stock on the day of such award. These awards cliff vest on the one-year anniversary of the award.\n\n2023 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\nName and Principal Position Fees Earned or\n\nPaid in Cash ($) Stock Awards ($) Option Awards ($) Total Anthony Scott (1) President and Chief Executive Officer $0 $– $– $– Anthony J.

Wilson Board Member $33,750 $70,000 $14,002 $117,752\n\n____________________\n\n(1)No fees were paid to Company employees for serving as a Director of the Company.\n\nNOMINATION OF DIRECTORS\n\nIn nominating and evaluating candidates to determine if they are qualified to become Board members, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers a number of attributes, including:\n\n·personal and professional character, integrity, ethics and values, without regard to race, religion, gender or national origin; ·general business experience and leadership profile, including experience in corporate management, such as serving as an officer or former officer of a publicly held company, or experience as a board member of another publicly held company; ·strategic planning abilities and experience; ·aptitude in accounting and finance; ·expertise in domestic and international markets; ·experience in the network security or telecommunications industry; ·understanding of relevant technologies; ·academic expertise in an area of the Company’s operations; ·communications and interpersonal skills; and ·practical and mature business judgment.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee also evaluates Board members’ and nominees’ service on the boards of other public companies. These directors also evaluate candidates identified by their personal contacts and other Board members.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee will also consider nominees proposed by stockholders. Although the Company has no formal policy regarding stockholder nominees, stockholder nominees are viewed in substantially the same manner as other nominees. The consideration of any candidate for director will be based on the assessment of the individual’s background, skills and abilities, and if such characteristics qualify the individual to fulfill the needs of the Board at that time. To recommend a prospective nominee for consideration, stockholders should timely submit the candidate’s name and qualifications to the Company’s Secretary in writing at 101 East Park Blvd., Suite 1200, Plano, TX 75074. An amendment to the Company’s bylaws in 2023 did provide for changes to the procedures by which stockholders may recommend nominees to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee annually reviews the requisite skills and characteristics of Board members, as well as the composition of the Board as a whole. This assessment includes a consideration of independence, diversity, skills, experience, and industry backgrounds in the context of the needs of the Board and the Company. Directors are expected to exemplify the highest standards of personal and professional integrity and to constructively challenge management through their active participation and questioning.\n\nCommunication with the Board\n\nThe Company does not have formal procedures for stockholder communication with the Board. Any matter intended for the Board, or for any individual member or members of the Board, should be directed to the Company’s Secretary at the address of the Company indicated above, with a request to forward the same to the intended recipient. In general, all stockholder communication delivered to the Company’s Secretary for forwarding to the Board or specified Board members will be forwarded in accordance with the stockholder’s instructions, unless the Secretary believes the question or issue may be addressed adequately by the Company’s investor relations department. However, the Secretary reserves the right to not forward to Board members any abusive, threatening or otherwise inappropriate materials. The Board believes that more formal procedures are not necessary to permit shareholders adequate access to its members.\n\nPolicy Regarding Board Attendance at Stockholders Meetings\n\nAlthough it has no formal policy requiring attendance, the Company encourages all directors to attend all meetings of stockholders. All of the then serving members of the Board attended the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the 2024 Special Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\n\nAll of the Company’s directors and employees are required to abide by the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which the Company adopted on September 14, 2020, as amended on March 16, 2022 (the “Code”) to ensure that the Company’s business is conducted in a consistently legal and ethical manner and to avoid instances of insider trading. The Code covers areas of professional conduct that include conflicts of interest, fair dealing and the strict adherence to all laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of the Company’s business. The full text of the Code is published on the Company’s website under the investor relations tab at www.intrusion.com. The Company intends to disclose future amendments to, or waivers from, certain provisions of the Codes of Ethics on the Company’s website within four business days following the date of such amendment or waiver. Upon the written request of any stockholder, the Company will furnish, without charge, a copy of the Code. This request should be directed to the Company’s Secretary at 101 East Park Blvd., Suite 1200, Plano, TX 75074.\n\nPROPOSAL TWO\n\nRATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT\n\nOF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nThe Board has appointed Whitley Penn LLP to serve as independent auditors of the Company and to audit its consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2023, subject to ratification by the Company’s stockholders at the Meeting. Whitley Penn LLP has served as the Company’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm since July 2009. To the knowledge of management of the Company, neither such firm nor any of its members has any direct or material indirect financial interest in the Company, nor any connection with the Company in any capacity other than as independent auditors.\n\nAlthough stockholder ratification and approval of this appointment is not required by the Company’s bylaws or otherwise, in keeping with the Company’s policy that its stockholders should be entitled to a voice in this regard and as a matter of good corporate practice, the Board is seeking ratification of this appointment. If the appointment is not ratified, the Board must then determine whether to appoint other auditors prior to the end of the current fiscal year. In such a case, the opinions of stockholders will be taken into consideration.\n\nFees Paid to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed the following audit and non-audit fees the Company has paid to Whitley Penn LLP for 2022 and 2023 for purposes of considering whether such fees are compatible with maintaining the auditor’s independence. The policy of the Audit Committee is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services performed by Whitley Penn LLP before the services are performed, including all the services described below under “Audit-Related Fees,” “Tax Fees” and “All Other Fees” below.\n\nAudit Fees. Fees billed for service rendered by our Accounting Firm for the reviews of Forms 10-Q and for the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company were $186,685 for 2022 and $216,941 for 2023. Fees billed for the services rendered by our Accounting Firm for the review of our registration statements for our offerings of Common Stock and due diligence associated with our at-the-market program was $32,500 in 2022 and $61,860 in 2023.\n\nAudited-Related Fees. Aggregate fees billed for all audit-related services rendered by our Accounting Firm were $0 for 2022 and 2023.\n\nTax Fees. Aggregate fees billed for permissible tax services rendered by our Accounting Firm consisted of $12,550 for 2022 and $2,000 for 2023. These amounts include tax strategy services, preparation of sales tax returns, preparation of federal and state income tax returns, preparation of property tax and franchise tax returns and international tax issues.\n\nAll Other Fees. Aggregate fees billed for all other services rendered by our Accounting Firm consisted of $0 for 2022 and 2023.\n\nRepresentatives of Whitley Penn LLP are expected to be in attendance at the Meeting and will be afforded the opportunity to make a statement. The representatives will also be available to respond to appropriate questions.\n\nThe enclosed Proxy will be voted as specified, but if no specification is made, it will be voted “FOR” the adoption of the resolution of ratification.\n\nThe Board recommends a vote “FOR” this proposal.\n\nPROPOSAL THREE\n\nAPPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE\n\nINTRUSION INC. 2021 OMNBUS INCENTIVE PLAN\n\nOverview\n\nAt the Annual Meeting, stockholders are also being asked to approve an amendment to the Amended 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Equity Plan”) to increase the number of shares authorized to use post reverse stock split from 125,000 shares to the pre reverse stock split authorized plan amount of 2,500,000 shares. The purpose of the 2021 Equity Plan is to advance the interests of Intrusion and its stockholders by enabling Intrusion and its subsidiaries to attract and retain qualified individuals to perform services, to provide incentive compensation for such individuals in a form that is linked to the growth and profitability of Intrusion and increases in stockholder value, and to provide opportunities for equity participation that align the interests of recipients with those of its stockholders.\n\nThe Intrusion Inc. 2021 Equity Plan was originally adopted and became effective on March 25, 2021, which was the date of its adoption by the Board, subject to the approval by the stockholders of the Company. On March 27, 2022, the Board adopted an amendment to the 2021 Equity Plan, which effected the following material changes: (1) permitted the Compensation Committee to recognize the existence of special circumstances with the approval of the Board of Directors; and, (2) under such special circumstances, issue awards not otherwise subject to the attainment of a performance criteria to vest during a period less than one (1) year.\n\nThe 2021 Equity Plan, as amended, permits the Board, or a committee or subcommittee thereof, to grant to eligible employees, non-employee directors and consultants of Intrusion and its subsidiaries non-statutory and incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), performance awards, non-employee director awards, and other stock-based awards. If the proposal is approved subject to adjustment, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock to be authorized for issuance under the 2021 Equity Plan will be 2,500,000, with an annual increase on the first day of each calendar year beginning on January 1, 2025 and ending on January 1, 2030 equal to the lesser of: (A) ten percent (10%) of the increase in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding from the first day of the preceding calendar year to the first day of the current calendar year, as the number of shares are determined on a fully-diluted basis; and (B) such smaller number of shares of Common Stock as may be determined by the Board.\n\nOur board of directors is recommending that our stockholders approve the amendment to increase the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the 2021 Equity Plan.\n\nSummary of Sound Governance Features of the 2021 Equity Plan\n\nThe board of directors believes that the 2021 Equity Plan contains several features that are consistent with protecting the interests of our stockholders and sound corporate governance practices, including the following:\n\n✓ Will not be excessively dilutive to stockholders ✓ No re-pricing of “underwater” stock options or SARs without stockholder approval ✓ No tax gross ups ✓ No reload options or SARs ✓ Clawback provisions ✓ No discounted options or SARs ✓ Limits on director compensation\n\nThe following is a summary of the principal features of the 2021 Equity Plan. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended and Restated 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (referred to herein as the “2021 Equity Plan”), which is set forth in Appendix A.\n\nThe Board recommends a vote “FOR” this proposal.\n\nPLAN SUMMARY\n\nAny stockholder who wishes to obtain a copy of the actual 2021 Equity Plan document may do so upon written request to the Company’s Corporate Secretary, c/o Intrusion Inc., 101 East Park Blvd, Suite 1300, Plano, Texas 75074.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of the 2021 Equity Plan is to provide a means through which the Company may attract and retain key personnel and to provide a means whereby directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors of the Company can acquire and maintain an equity interest in the Company, or be paid incentive compensation, including incentive compensation measured by reference to the value of Common Stock, thereby strengthening their commitment to the welfare of the Company and its Affiliates and aligning their interests with those of the Company’s stockholders.\n\nAdministration\n\nThe 2021 Equity Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our board of directors or such other committee of our board of directors to which it has properly delegated power, or if no such committee or subcommittee exists, our board of directors. To the extent required by applicable law, rule or regulation, it is intended that each member of the Compensation Committee shall qualify as (a) a “non-employee director” under Rule 16b-3, and (b) an “independent director” under the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association, as applicable.\n\nThe Compensation Committee is authorized to interpret, administer, reconcile any inconsistency in, correct any defect in and/or supply any omission in the 2021 Equity Plan and any instrument or agreement relating to, or any award granted under, the 2021 Equity Plan (each, an “Award”); establish, amend, suspend, or waive any rules and regulations and appoint such agents as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate for the proper administration of the 2021 Equity Plan; adopt sub-plans; and to make any other determination and take any other action that the Compensation Committee deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the 2021 Equity Plan. Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules and regulations of any securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which our securities are listed or traded, the Compensation Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any part of its responsibilities and powers to any person or persons selected by it in accordance with the terms of the 2021 Equity Plan.\n\nUnless otherwise expressly provided in the 2021 Equity Plan, all designations, determinations, interpretations, and other decisions under or with respect to the 2021 Equity Plan or any Award or any documents evidencing Awards granted pursuant to the 2021 Equity Plan are within the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, may be made at any time and are final, conclusive and binding upon all persons or entities, including, without limitation, us, any participant, any holder or beneficiary of any Award, and any of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee may make grants of the following Awards to eligible persons (“Eligible Persons”) pursuant to terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Award agreement, including subjecting such Awards to performance criteria listed in the 2021 Equity Plan.\n\n·Stock Option Awards, ·Stock Appreciation Right Awards, ·Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards, ·Performance Awards, ·Other Stock-Based Awards and Cash-Based Awards\n\nEligible Shares\n\nCurrently, under the 2021 Equity Plan (sometimes referred to herein as the “Plan”), the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued or used for reference purposes or with respect to which Awards may be granted under the 2021 Equity Plan shall not exceed One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand (125,000) shares. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Stock Awards and Stock Options may be granted under the Plan is One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand (125,000) shares. If Proposal 3 is approved, the maximum number of shares with respect to which Awards may granted under the Plan and with respect to which Incentive Stock Options may be granted, cumulatively, would be Two Million Five Hundred Thousand (2,500,000) shares. If any Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Other Stock-Based Awards granted under the Plan expires, terminates or is canceled for any reason without having been exercised in full, the number of shares of Common Stock underlying any unexercised Award shall again be available for the purpose of Awards under the Plan. If any shares of Restricted Stock, Performance Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards denominated in shares of Common Stock awarded under the Plan to a Participant are forfeited for any reason, the number of forfeited shares of Restricted Stock, Performance Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards denominated in shares of Common Stock shall again be available for purposes of Awards under the Plan. If any shares of Common Stock are (i) withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations on an Award issued under the Plan, (ii) tendered in order to satisfy the exercise price due with respect to an Award issued under the Plan, or (iii) repurchased by the Company using proceeds received upon exercise of a Stock Option, the number of shares of Common Stock so withheld, tendered or repurchased, as applicable, shall not be available for purposes of future Awards under the Plan. If a Stock Appreciation Right or a Limited Stock Appreciation Right is granted in tandem with an Option, such grant shall only apply once against the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan. Any Award under the Plan settled in cash shall not be counted against the foregoing maximum share limitations. To date, 79,226 total shares have been issued under the Plan, 26,007 shares have been issued under Awards and 53,220 shares have been issued with respect to Stock Options. 31,701 shares have been forfeited and returned to the Plan.\n\nEligible Persons\n\nAny Employee of the Company or any of its affiliates, any independent Non-Employee Director, or person who is an advisor or consultant to the Company designated by the Committee in its discretion as eligible to receive Awards subject to the conditions set forth in the Plan (an “Eligible Person”) shall be permitted to participate (a “Participant”) under the 2021 Equity Plan. Only Eligible Persons who are also employees of the Company or its affiliates are eligible to receive Stock Awards and Stock Options under the 2021 Equity Plan. Eligibility for the grant of a Stock Award or Stock Option and actual participation in the 2021 Equity Plan shall be determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. As of July 1, 2024, approximately 49 employees, including three Executive officers, and four Non-Employee-Directors would qualify as Eligible Persons and potential Participants in 2021 Equity Plan.\n\nPlan Awards\n\nStock Options. The Compensation Committee may grant non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options to Eligible Persons, under the 2021 Equity Plan, with terms and conditions determined by the Compensation Committee that are not inconsistent with the 2021 Equity Plan. All stock options granted under the 2021 Equity Plan are required to have a per share exercise price that is not less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock underlying such stock options on the date such stock options are granted (other than in the case of options that are substitute Awards). All stock options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options must be granted pursuant to an Award agreement expressly stating that the options are intended to qualify as incentive stock options and will be subject to the terms and conditions that comply with the rules as may be prescribed by Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The maximum term for stock options granted under the 2021 Equity Plan will be ten years from the initial date of grant, or with respect to any stock options intended to qualify as incentive stock options, such shorter period as prescribed by Section 422 of the Code. However, if a non-qualified stock option would expire at a time when trading of shares of our Common Stock is prohibited by our insider trading policy (or “blackout period” imposed by the Company), the term will automatically be extended to the 30th day following the end of such period. The purchase price for the shares as to which a stock option is exercised may be paid, to the extent permitted by law, (i) in cash or its equivalent at the time the stock option is exercised; (ii) in shares having a fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price for the shares being purchased and satisfying any requirements that may be imposed by the Compensation Committee (so long as such shares have been held by the Participant for at least six months or such other period established by the Compensation Committee to avoid adverse accounting treatment); or (iii) by such other method as the Compensation Committee may permit in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, (A) in other property having a fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the purchase price, (B) if there is a public market for the shares at such time, through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell the shares being acquired upon the exercise of the stock option and to deliver to us the amount of the proceeds of such sale equal to the aggregate exercise price for the shares being purchased or (C) through a “net exercise” procedure effected by withholding the minimum number of shares needed to pay the exercise price. Any fractional shares of Common Stock will be settled in cash.\n\nStock Appreciation Rights. The Compensation Committee may grant stock appreciation rights under the 2021 Equity Plan, with terms and conditions determined by the Compensation Committee that are not inconsistent with the 2021 Equity Plan. The Compensation Committee may award stock appreciation rights in tandem with options or independent of any option. Generally, each stock appreciation right will entitle the participant upon exercise to an amount (in cash, shares or a combination of cash and shares, as determined by the Compensation Committee) equal to the product of (i) the excess of (A) the fair market value on the exercise date of one share of Common Stock, over (B) the strike price per share, times (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock covered by the stock appreciation right. The strike price per share of a stock appreciation right will be determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant but in no event may such amount be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date the stock appreciation right is granted (other than in the case of stock appreciation rights granted in substitution of previously granted Awards).\n\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. The Compensation Committee may grant restricted shares of our Common Stock or restricted stock units, representing the right to receive, upon vesting and the expiration of any applicable restricted period, one share of Common Stock for each restricted stock unit, or, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, the cash value thereof (or any combination thereof). As to restricted shares of our Common Stock, subject to the other provisions of the 2021 Equity Plan, the holder will generally have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as to such restricted shares of Common Stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote such restricted shares of Common Stock. Participants have no rights or privileges as a stockholder with respect to restricted stock units.\n\nPerformance Awards. The Compensation Committee may grant a Performance Award to a Participant payable upon the attainment of specific performance criteria. If the Performance Award is payable in shares of Common Stock, such shares shall be transferable to the Participant only upon attainment of the relevant Performance Criteria. If the Performance Award is payable in cash, it may be paid upon the attainment of the relevant Performance Criteria either in cash or in shares of Common Stock (based on the then current fair market value of such shares), as determined by the Compensation Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion. Each Performance Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement in such form that is not inconsistent with the Plan and that the Compensation Committee may from time to time approve.\n\nOther Equity-Based Awards and Cash-Based Awards. The Compensation Committee may grant other equity-based or cash-based Awards under the 2021 Equity Plan, with terms and conditions determined by the Compensation Committee that are not inconsistent with the 2021 Equity Plan.\n\nEffect of Certain Events on 2021 Equity Plan and Award\n\nIn the event of (i) any dividend (other than regular cash dividends) or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, shares of Common Stock, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares of Common Stock or other securities, issuance of warrants or other rights to acquire shares of Common Stock or other securities, or other similar corporate transaction or event that affects the shares of Common Stock (including a change in control, as defined in the 2021 Equity Plan), or (ii) unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company, including changes in applicable rules, rulings, regulations or other requirements, that the Compensation Committee determines, in its sole discretion, could result in substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights intended to be granted to, or available for, participants (any event in (i) or (ii), being referred to as an “Adjustment Event”), the Compensation Committee will, in respect of any such Adjustment Event, make such proportionate substitution or adjustment, if any, as it deems equitable, to any or all of: (A) the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company (or number and kind of other securities or other property) which may be issued in respect of Awards or with respect to which Awards may be granted under the 2021 Equity Plan or any sub-plan and (B) the terms of any outstanding Award, including, without limitation, (1) the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company (or number and kind of other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards or to which outstanding Awards relate, (2) the exercise price or strike price with respect to any Award, or (3) any applicable performance measures; it being understood that, in the case of any “equity restructuring,” the Compensation Committee will make an equitable or proportionate adjustment to outstanding Awards to reflect such equity restructuring.\n\nIn connection with any change in control, the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for any one or more of the following: (i) a substitution or assumption of Awards, or to the extent the surviving entity does not substitute or assume the Awards, the acceleration of vesting of, the exercisability of, or lapse of restrictions on Awards and (ii) cancellation of any one or more outstanding Awards and payment to the holders of such Awards that are vested as of such cancellation (including any Awards that would vest as a result of the occurrence of such event but for such cancellation) the value of such Awards, if any, as determined by the Compensation Committee (which value, if applicable, may be based upon the price per share of Common Stock received or to be received by other holders of our Common Stock in such event), including, in the case of stock options and stock appreciation rights, a cash payment equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock subject to the option or stock appreciation right over the aggregate exercise price or strike price thereof.\n\nPROPOSAL FOUR\n\nAPPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE\n\nINTRUSION INC. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN\n\nOverview\n\nAt the Annual Meeting, stockholders are also being asked to approve an amendment to Intrusion Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) to increase the number of shares the plan was authorized to issue post reverse stock split from 50,000 to the pre reverse stock split authorized plan amount of 1,000,000. The purpose of the ESPP is to advance the interests of Intrusion and its stockholders by enabling Intrusion and its subsidiaries to attract and retain qualified individuals to perform services, to provide incentive compensation for such individuals in a form that is linked to the growth and profitability of Intrusion and increases in stockholder value, and to provide opportunities for equity participation that align the interests of recipients with those of its stockholders.\n\nThe ESPP was originally adopted and became effective on April 12, 2023, which was the date of its adoption by the Board, subject to the approval by the stockholders of the Company. The ESPP provides eligible employees with an opportunity to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a discount through accumulated payroll deductions. If the proposal is approved, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock to be authorized for issuance under the ESPP will be 1,000,000.\n\nOur board of directors is recommending that our stockholders approve the amendment to increase the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the ESPP.\n\nThe following is a summary of the principal features of the ESPP. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the ESPP, which is set forth in Appendix B.\n\nThe Board recommends a vote “FOR” this proposal.\n\nSummary of the ESPP\n\nThe principal terms of the ESPP are summarized below.\n\nThe ESPP, including the right of participants to make purchases under the ESPP, is intended to qualify as an “Employee Stock Purchase Plan” under the provisions of Section 421 and 423 of the Code, although we may offer sub-plans or offerings that are not intended to meet the Section 423 requirements for employees outside the United States pursuant to the terms of the ESPP. The provisions of the ESPP shall, accordingly, be construed so as to extend and limit participation in a manner consistent with the requirements of those sections of the Code. The ESPP will not be a qualified deferred compensation plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and is not subject to the provisions of ERISA.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of the ESPP is to provide our employees with a means of acquiring an equity interest in Intrusion through payroll deductions, to enhance such employees’ sense of participation in our business, and to provide an incentive for continued employment through the opportunity to acquire equity at a discounted price.\n\nShares Reserved for Issuance\n\nIf approved, 1,000,000 shares of the Common Stock of Intrusion Inc. will be reserved and made available for issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP does not include an evergreen provision, thereby eliminating an annual automatic increase of shares. The closing price per share of our Class A Common Stock on July 1, 2024, was $1.08.\n\nOffering Periods\n\nThe ESPP is currently expected to be administered through consecutive six-month periods referred to as “Offering Periods,” commencing on each January 1 and July 1, and ending on the succeeding June 30 and December 31, respectively. The Compensation Committee may change the duration and structure of future Offering Periods in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, provided that no Offering Period may extend for a period longer than 27 months.\n\nOn the first trading day of each Offering Period (the “Offering Date”), each eligible employee who has properly enrolled in that Offering Period in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Compensation Committee will be granted an option to purchase shares of our common stock to be funded by payroll deductions, based on the participant’s elected contribution rate. Unless a participant has properly withdrawn from the Offering Period, each option granted under the ESPP will automatically be exercised on the last trading day of the Offering Period (the “Purchase Date”). The purchase price will be equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our Common Stock on (i) the Offering Date and (ii) the Purchase Date.\n\nPlan Administration\n\nThe ESPP will be administered by our Compensation Committee. Subject to the terms of the ESPP, the Compensation Committee will have the authority to, among other matters, determine the eligibility of participants, determine the terms and conditions of offerings under the ESPP, and construe and interpret the terms of the ESPP.\n\nEligibility\n\nGenerally, all of our employees, and employees of any of our subsidiaries designated by the Compensation Committee, will be eligible to participate in the ESPP; provided that employees who own (or are deemed to own as a result of stock attribution rules) stock constituting 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our stock or any of our subsidiaries will not be permitted to participate in the ESPP. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, exclude the following categories of employees from participation: (i) employees who are not employed prior to the beginning of an Offering Period, (ii) employees who are customarily employed 20 hours or less per week in a calendar year; (iii) employees who are customarily employed five months or less in a calendar year; (iv) certain “highly compensated” employees; (v) employees who are citizens or residents of a foreign jurisdiction, if such employee’s participation is prohibited under the laws of the jurisdiction governing such employee or compliance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction would violate the requirements of Section 423 of the Code; (vi) employees who do not meet any other eligibility requirements that the Compensation Committee may choose to impose (within the limits permitted by the Code); and (vii) individuals who provide services to Intrusion who are reclassified as common law employees for any reason except for federal income and employment tax purposes. A new plan benefits table is provided below:\n\nShare Purchase\n\n$ Amount Share Purchase\n\n# Shares Executive Group Anthony Scott\n\nPresident and CEO, Director\n\n$323 75 Kimberly Pinson\n\nChief Financial Officer $323 75 Non-Executive Director Group $– – Non-Executive Officer Employee Group $1,613 375\n\nAs of July 1, 2024, approximately 49 of our employees were eligible to participate in the ESPP.\n\nEnrollment in the ESPP\n\nEligible employees become participants in the ESPP by completing a subscription agreement or enrolling online authorizing payroll deductions prior to the applicable Offering Date. A person who becomes employed after the commencement of an Offering Period may not participate in the ESPP until the commencement of the next Offering Period.\n\nContribution and Purchase Limitations\n\nUnless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, no participant may (i) elect a contribution rate of more than 15% of his or her compensation (as defined in the ESPP) for the purchase of shares under the ESPP; (ii) purchase more than 1,500 shares of our Common Stock (which limit the Compensation Committee may increase or decrease provided such limit does not exceed 10,000 shares) under the ESPP on any one Purchase Date; or (iii) purchase shares that have a fair market value of more than $25,000, determined as of the Offering Date, in any calendar year in which the Offering Period is in effect.\n\nCertain Corporate Transactions\n\nIf the number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock is changed by a stock dividend, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, combination, reclassification, or similar change in our capital structure without consideration, then the Compensation Committee will proportionately adjust the number of shares available under the ESPP, the purchase price, the number of shares any participant has elected to purchase, and the limit on the number of shares a participant may purchase on any one Purchase Date.\n\nIn the event of a Corporate Transaction (as defined in the ESPP), each outstanding right to purchase Common Stock under the ESPP will be assumed or an equivalent option substituted by the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the purchase right, the Offering Period with respect to which such purchase right relates will be shortened and provide for a new final Purchase Date, which shall occur on or prior to the consummation of the Corporate Transaction, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The ESPP shall terminate on the closing of the Corporate Transaction.\n\nTerm; Amendments and Termination\n\nThe ESPP terminates upon the issuance of all the shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP or an earlier termination of the ESPP by our Board of Directors or our Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may generally amend, suspend, or terminate the ESPP at any time without stockholder approval, except as may be required by applicable law or exchange listing rules.\n\nCertain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\n\nThe following is a general summary of the United States federal income tax consequences to us and to participants in the ESPP based on tax laws in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not address all matters that may be relevant to any particular participant. Among other considerations, this summary does not describe the tax laws of any state, municipality, or foreign jurisdiction, or describe gift, estate, excise, payroll or other employment taxes. Participants are advised to consult with their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of participation in the ESPP. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code and the following discussion assumes that it is so qualified.\n\nEach participant’s payroll deductions under the ESPP will be made on an after-tax basis. Generally, the participant will not recognize any taxable income at the time he or she is granted an option to purchase shares of Common Stock during an Offering Period or at the time the option is exercised to purchase shares on behalf of the participant. The participant will generally only recognize taxable income (or loss) on the date the participant sells or otherwise disposes of the acquired shares. The particular tax consequence depends on the length of time such shares are held by the participant prior to the sale or disposition.\n\nIf the shares are sold or disposed of more than two years from the first day of the Offering Period during which the shares were purchased, and more than one year from the Purchase Date or if the participant dies while holding the shares, the participant (or his or her estate) will recognize ordinary income measured as the lesser of (i) the amount by which the fair market value of the shares on the Offering Date exceeded the purchase price of the shares (calculated as though the shares had been purchased on the Offering Date) and (ii) the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of such sale or other disposition over the purchase price. Any additional gain will be treated as long-term capital gain. If the shares are held for the holding periods described above but are sold for a price that is less than the purchase price, there is no ordinary income, and the participating employee has a long-term capital loss for the difference between the sale price and the purchase price. If the shares are sold or otherwise disposed of before the expiration of either of the holding periods described above, the participant will recognize ordinary income generally measured as the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date the shares are purchased over the purchase price. Any additional gain or loss on such sale or disposition will be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the shares were held following the date they were purchased by the participant prior to disposing of them.\n\nWe are generally not entitled to a deduction for amounts taxed as ordinary income or capital gain to a participant except to the extent of ordinary income recognized upon a sale or disposition of shares prior to the expiration of the holding periods described above.\n\nNew Plan Benefits\n\nParticipation in the ESPP is voluntary and each eligible employee will have the discretion to determine whether and to what extent to participate in and contribute to the ESPP. Accordingly, the benefits and amounts that will be received or allocated to officers and other employees under the ESPP are not determinable at this time. Our non-employee directors will not be eligible to participate in our ESPP.\n\nPROPOSAL FIVE\n\napproval of the reservation and issuance of up to $10.0 Million\n\nof Securities in connection with a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement.\n\nOur Common Stock is currently listed on Nasdaq and, as such, the Company is subject to Nasdaq rules, which require us to obtain stockholder approval prior to the issuance of our Common Stock in connection with certain non-public offerings involving the sale, issuance or potential issuance by the Company of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock) equal to 20% or more of the Common Stock outstanding before the issuance.\n\nOverview\n\nOn July 3, 2024, the Company entered into the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (“SEPA”) with Streeterville Capital, LLC (“Streeterville”) pursuant to which the Company has the right to sell to Streeterville up to $10.0 million of Common Stock (“Commitment Amount”), subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA, from time to time during the term of the SEPA. The term of the SEPA is a period of 24 months from the date of entry into the definitive documents. The Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Streeterville pursuant to which it will register the resale of shares of Common Stock issued to Streeterville pursuant to the SEPA. Sales of the shares of Common Stock to Streeterville under the SEPA, and the timing of any such sales, are at the Company’s option, and the Company is under no obligation to sell any shares of Common Stock to Streeterville under the SEPA.\n\nUpon the satisfaction of the conditions to Streeterville’s purchase obligation set forth in the SEPA, including having a registration statement registering the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable under the SEPA declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company will have the right, but not the obligation, from time to time at its discretion, to direct Streeterville to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock (an “Advance”) by delivering written notice to Streeterville (an “Advance Notice”). Each Advance is limited to the lower of (i) an amount equal to 100% of the aggregate daily trading volume during the three (3) consecutive trading days immediately preceding an Advance Notice, or (ii) 4.99% of the shares issued and outstanding of Common Stock.\n\nThe shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to an Advance will be purchased at a price equal to 95% of the lowest daily VWAP of the shares of Common Stock during the three consecutive trading days commencing on the date of the delivery of the Advance Notice, other than the daily VWAP on a day in which the daily VWAP is less than a minimum acceptable price as stated by the Company in the Advance Notice or there is no VWAP on the subject trading day.
