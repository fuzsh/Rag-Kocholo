A Maintenance Release is usually developed to incorporate error corrections and/or patches. A Maintenance Release is typically characterized by a change in the digit to the extreme right of the decimal point (hundredths) of an existing version of a software product, i.e., X.X.(X). 1.5 "Services" means the on-call support, escalation management, problem determination, maintenance and other software support services. 1.6 "Workaround" means a method a customer can use to avoid a problem.

The founders brought to the company extensive experience with Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) technology and with the emerging market for network computing. During 1989 the company completed a number of consulting contracts for key technology companies in the emerging FDDI market. In 1990, backed by venture capital investors, the company began the design and manufacture of its initial product line. The first product to be introduced was an FDDI adapter for the AT/ISA bus based systems. This product was delivered to customers in September 1990. Since that time Network Peripherals has introduced the industry's most comprehensive tine of work group FDDI products. Corporate Profile Network Peripherals designs, manufactures and markets high speed work group networking solutions. As the computer market moves more toward client-server systems, and as the performance of these systems increases, the demands on the network are increased. Network Peripherals charter is to provide the networking solution to these work group users. Currently, the company's products are based on the FDDI standard. FDDI is an ANSI standard, 100 megabit/second local area network that has ten times the bandwidth of Ethernet. The company's products include a wide range of network adapter cards for workstation and server systems, a tine of FDDI concentrators, and extensive software support for most network operating systems. Network Peripherals markets products in North America through Value Added Resellers (VARs), distributors and OEMs. Outside of North America, the company utilizes distributors to deliver its products
