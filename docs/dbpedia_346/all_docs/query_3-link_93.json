        "text": "Shahid was apparently promised the ‘Best Actor’ trophy but the decision was changed at the last moment.\n\nThe actor walked out of the award show without his dance performance for which he had even rehearsed.\n\nBollywood actor Shahid Kapoor reportedly left a recently held award ceremony disheartened after Ranveer Singh won ‘Best Actor’ award for ‘Gully Boy’. The actor was even supposed to perform at the night, however, neither he received the 'promised' award, nor did he perform.\n\nShahid was apparently promised the ‘Best Actor’ trophy for his performance in ‘Kabir Singh’ but the decision was changed at the last moment and Ranveer won the award.\n\nShahid’s character Kabir Singh has been the talk of town in 2019. The movie itself went on to amass huge numbers at the box-office.\n\n“It was an understanding that Shahid will perform because he was bagging the award. He had rehearsed for the performance too. But it seems that there was a last-minute change and that reportedly upset Shahid,” a source told Pinkvilla.\n\nThe source further said, “Shahid apparently lost his cool on the organisers because it was an unprofessional move on their part to sneakily change the whole scenario. He was reportedly very upset with how the whole thing was addressed. The award was then presented to Ranveer and Shahid then supposedly walked out of the show. He was to perform but he decided not to record his performance as well”.\n\nHowever, just before the award ceremony kicked off, Ranveer and Shahid were seen sharing some friendly moments together with the paparazzi."
