Shahid means something like martyr, and she doesn't want anything to do with the sanguinary idea of a martyr’s death. And she definitely does not want to carry that in her name. The film explores Narges’ family history and its entanglement with the history of Iran.\n\nExhibition Lichter Art Award\n\nSection: Lichter Art Award\n\nDirection: Frieder Haller, Benjamin Dobó & Anafee Fränznick, Lea Spielmann, Mirelle Borra, Vanessa Nica Mueller\n\n2023-2024\n\nPlaytime: until 20:00 ∞ min\n\nFree Entrance ‒ open from 10 am to 8 pm\n\nWednesday, 17 April 2024, 10:00 h, Festivalzentrum\n\nThe 14th LICHTER Art Award Edition is truly multidisciplinary.

With tenderness, Favoriten follows their teacher through thick and thin as she helps them in finding a place in a world in which they often feel they don’t belong. What future lies ahead for these children? Can education truly be emancipatory if children cannot be freed from societal constraints?\n\nEines Vaters Liebe\n\nSection: Regional Feature Film Program\n\nDirection: Leon Noel Schardt\n\nDocumentary, 2023\n\nLanguage: German\n\nPlaytime: 90 min\n\nFilmz Mainz: Best Documentary\n\nIN ATTENDANCE OF THE DIRECTOR\n\nWednesday, 17 April 2024, 18:00 h, Pupille Kino\n\nWhat does emotional suppression, drama and speechlessness do to a family? Director Leon Noel Schardt films himself on a journey of discovery to the roots of his family and his depression. Little by little it becomes evident how father-son relationships of several generations have shaped his own image of masculinity and emotions.\n\nZeit Verbrechen: Der Panther\n\nSection: Future German Cinema\n\nDirection: Jan Bonny\n\nSeries, 2024\n\nLanguage: German\n\nPlaytime: 76 min\n\nBerlinale 2024\n\nIN ATTENDANCE OF THE DIRECTOR\n\nHESSEN PREMIERE\n\nWednesday, 17 April 2024, 18:30 h, Eldorado Filmtheater\n\nThe true story of an informant in the drug cartel. Lars Eidinger is the panther, constantly drifting through the German worlds under pressure. Jan Bonny has succeeded in making a sensational gangster flick in the same vein as ''Heat''. All of a sudden, the backdrop of Leverkusen seems to resemble the LA suburb.\n\nExile never ends\n\nSection: Regional Feature Film Program\n\nDirection: Bahar Bektaş\n\nDocumentary, 2024\n\nLanguage: German, Turkish with German subtitles\n\nPlaytime: 100 min\n\nFilmfestival Max Ophüls 2024: Beste Dokumentation\n\nIN ATTENDANCE OF THE DIRECTOR\n\nHESSIAN PREMIERE\n\nWednesday, 17 April 2024, 19:00 h, Naxos Kino\n\nBecause of a threat of deportation after serving his prison sentence, Taner applies for an early transfer to Turkey. How does that affect his parents and siblings, who came to Germany as Kurdish-Alvi refugees 30 years ago? And what prospects await Taner in Turkey?

Emotions are nothing more than handicaps. Undergoing a procedure to get rid of her feelings, Gabrielle remembers her past lives, and the signs of a preordained fate shake her to her core. Time-travelling through three eras tinted by a deep existential angst, The Beast is an engaging and off-beat sci-fi about losing the sentimental core that makes us humans. Isn’t it dangerous to know the future?\n\nForeign Language (Langue Étrangère)\n\nSection: International Feature Film Program\n\nDirection: Claire Burger\n\nDrama, 2024\n\nLanguage: French & German with subtitles\n\nPlaytime: 101 min\n\nBerlinale 2024\n\nIN THE PRESENCE OF THE DIRECTOR\n\nHESSIAN PREMIERE\n\nWednesday, 17 April 2024, 20:15 h, Eldorado Filmtheater\n\nAs part of a German-French exchange program, teenagers Lena and Fanny see each other for the first time in person after a long time of being pen-pals. At first, they don’t get along, despite suffering similar problems with their parents and their shared interest in left-wing activism – until they exchange a fateful French kiss at a house party under the influence of mushrooms. Where foreign tongues, foreign languages touch and mingle, that is where it grows: the future of Europe.\n\nScorched Earth\n\nSection: Future German Cinema\n\nDirection: Thomas Arslan\n\nFeature Film, 2024\n\nLanguage: German\n\nPlaytime: 101 min\n\nBerlinale 2024\n\nIN ATTENDANCE OF THE DIRECTOR\n\nHESSEN PREMIERE\n\nWednesday, 17 April 2024, 20:30 h, Mal Seh'n Kino\n\nProfessional gangster Trojan has been at it for a while. Quiet, suspicious, and full of caution, he moves through the criminal underworld. His next case seems to be going according to plan as well. With his accomplices, he steals a painting by Caspar David Friedrich from a museum in Berlin. But the dubious client thwarted their plans. The handover fails and soon, it is not about money anymore but instead about their very survival.\n\nSchleimkeim – Otze und die DDR von unten\n\nSection: Specials\n\nDirection: Jan Heck\n\nDocumentary, 2023\n\nLanguage: German\n\nPlaytime: 96 min\n\nIN ATTENDANCE OF THE DIRECTOR AND THE PRODUCER\n\nWednesday, 17 April 2024, 21:00 h, Prestigekino\n\nThe punk band Schleimkeim, formed around Dieter „Otze“ Ehrlich, disrupted the GDR with their rough sound, hand-made amplifiers and a neat anti-attitude. However, harassment from the state security service, alcohol and drug excesses and the hole left by the 1989 revolutions have left their marks. The documentary follows the tragic story of „Otze“ together with former band members, punks and companions.\n\nExhibition: VR Interactive Storytelling Short films\n\nSection: VR Storytelling\n\nDirection: Sister Sylvester, Deniz Tortum, Chloé Rochereuil, Christian Zipfel\n\nVR Storytelling, 2023-2024\n\nLanguage: English, German\n\nPlaytime: until 21:00 ∞ min\n\nFree Entrance - open from 2 pm to 9 pm\n\nThursday, 18 April 2024, 14:00 h, Festivalzentrum\n\nThis year, the 8th VIRTUAL REALITY STORYTELLING AWARD has a great new feature: our international competition will not only show 360° films - for the first time, there will also be interactive VR experiences that allow you to delve even deeper into virtual worlds.

At the same time, companies like Amazon cunningly pit their workers against each other with absurd tactics, only to replace them with automation soon after. Instead of discussing the absence of work ethics, we should be asking: what should a fair labour market look like in the future?\n\nNam June Paik: Moon Is The Oldest TV\n\nSection: International Feature Film Program\n\nDirection: Amanda Kim\n\nDocumentary, 2023\n\nLanguage: English, German, Korean with English subtitles\n\nPlaytime: 107 min\n\nThe best film - The Guardian's Best Films 2023, Sundance Film Festival 2023, DOK.fest München 2023\n\nHESSIAN PREMIERE\n\nThursday, 18 April 2024, 18:00 h, Eldorado Filmtheater\n\nYears before The Buggles proclaimed \"video killed the radio star\" on MTV, someone had already set out to understand the medium of video and to destroy it from within: Equipped with the radical attitude of the avant-garde and inspired by countercultural figures like John Cage, the pioneering video artist Nam June Paik wages a bitter battle against the self-proclaimed \"high arts.\"\n\nFrank Meyer\n\nSection: Regional Feature Film Program\n\nDirection: Leonhard Hofmann, Riccardo Dejan Jurkovic\n\nDocumentary, 2023\n\nLanguage: German with English subtitles\n\nPlaytime: 83 min\n\nGranit ‒ Hofer Dokumentarfilmpreis\n\nIN ATTENDANCE OF THE DIRECTORS\n\nHESSIAN PREMIERE\n\nThursday, 18 April 2024, 18:00 h, Kino des DFF\n\nLearning to love through cinema, in this case: Frank Meyer. The documentary follows the former bodybuilder for over ten years.He had already survived one stroke then.. At the start of filming, he prefers to operate the camera himself. But eventually, the young filmmakers emancipate themselves from Frank Meyer's instructions and thus give him and the audience a gift: he gets to understand himself better and becomes more capable of questioning his armored masculinity.\n\nIvo\n\nSection: Future German Cinema\n\nDirection: Eva Trobisch\n\nFeature Film, 2024\n\nLanguage: German\n\nPlaytime: 104 min\n\nBerlinale 2024, Heiner-Carow-Preis 2024\n\nThursday, 18 April 2024, 19:45 h, Mal Seh'n Kino\n\nIvo, an outpatient palliative care nurse, faces imminent death every day.
