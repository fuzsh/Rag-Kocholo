Mubarak!\n\nHansal Mehta said the award was an acknowledgment of the hard work and honesty that he has put in to make the biopic. \"I am very overwhelmed and really happy after hearing this. It is an award for the entire team and it is the recognition to the fact that anything made with determination will succeed,\" the director told IANS.\"You don't make films to win National Award or anything, you make films to present a story and honestly that was an intention. These are all recognition of hard work and honesty that has been put while making the film,\" he added.\n\nShahid, based on the real life story of murdered lawyer-activist Shahid Azmi, was feted by critics when it released to unanimous acclaim last year.
