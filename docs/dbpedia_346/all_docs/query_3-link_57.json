She said she learned what it was like for her children to have no Black teachers when they moved to Gettysburg. Shahid said her job was to continue to fight for African American rights.\n\n“There is no pride without Black pride; There is no American history without Black history,” she said.\n\nShahid invited everyone to attend this year’s Juneteenth celebration to be held this Saturday.\n\nYeimi Gagliardi, nominated by Charles Stangor and Mikel Grimm, was honored for her unwavering service to the Hispanic community in Adams County.
