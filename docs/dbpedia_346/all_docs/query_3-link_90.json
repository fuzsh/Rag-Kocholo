        "text": "Shahid Kapoor congratulated the team of Telugu film Jersey after it won two National Film Awards. The winners of the 67th National Film Awards were announced on Monday, March 22, and Jersey received awards in the Best Telugu Film and Best Editor categories. Jersey’s National Award win has put Shahid Kapoor in a lot of pressure. Why, you may ask? Well, the actor is playing the lead role in the Hindi remake of Jersey which will release on Diwali this year. Shahid’s film is also titled Jersey.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSHAHID KAPOOR CONGRATULATES TEAM JERSEY\n\nShahid Kapoor took to Instagram to share a poster of the film featuring Nani and Ronit Kamra (who plays Nani’s on-screen son in the film), and congratulated the team for their big win. “Huge congratulations to the entire team. Thanks for the extra pressure (sic).”\n\nSHAHID KAPOOR’S JERSEY TO RELEASE ON NOVEMBER 5, 2021\n\nShahid Kapoor announced earlier this year that his film Jersey will release on November 5, 2021. Shahid will be playing the role of a cricketer in Jersey and he had to undergo rigorous training for his role in the film. The actor often shared pictures and videos from his training sessions on Instagram.\n\nTake a look at some of the posts here:\n\nShahid Kapoor announced the release date of Jersey with this post:\n\nTelugu film Jersey, starring Nani, Shraddha Srinath, Harish Kalyan, Sanusha, Sathyaraj and Sampath Raj, released in 2019. The sports drama was written and directed by Gowtam Tinnanuri.\n\nON THE WORK FRONT\n\nShahid Kapoor was last seen in Kabir Singh (2019), which was a massive hit at the box office. Kabir Singh was the Hindi remake of Vijay Deverakonda’s film Arjun Reddy. Shahid will also make his debut on the OTT platform soon. The actor has collaborated with Raj & DK for his digital debut.\n\nALSO READ| Shahid Kapoor’s Jersey to release in theatres on Diwali"
