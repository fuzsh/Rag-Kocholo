        "text": "On Monday, Telugu film Jersey bagged two awards at the prestigious 67th National Film Awards. The 2019 sports drama won in the best Telugu film and the best editing category.\n\nAfter the film’s win, actor Shahid Kapoor, who is all set to play the lead role in the Hindi remake of Jersey, took to his social media to congratulate the team. His caption read, and wrote, “Huge congratulations to the entire team. Thanks for the extra pressure.”\n\nHave a look at the post here—\n\nJersey (2019), starring Telugu superstar Nani and Shraddha Srinath, was helmed by Gowtam Tinnanuri and backed by Suryadevara Naga Vamsi. The sports drama tells the tale of Arjun, a failed cricketer who decides to achieve his dream of representing the Indian team for his son. For the unversed, Gowtam is also directing the Hindi remake of the film.\n\nSharing his elation about the big win, the director said in a statement, “I’m very thankful that our film Jersey has received the highest honour, by winning the prestigious National Award for Best Film in Telugu. I’m overwhelmed with the love and response the film has received from all, and I’m eagerly looking forward to bringing the Hindi version of Jersey to the national audience this coming Diwali.”"
