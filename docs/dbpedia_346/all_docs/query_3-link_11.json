        "text": "When Mahesh Bhatt watched Shahid he told Hansal Mehta that he has made his obituary film, a film that will make him worthy of an obituary. Interestingly, when the National Awards were announced Mehta was busy giving the final touches to the Bhatt production Citylights . “My phone was switched off and I had no clue that the awards are going to be announced this week. So when producer Sunil Bohra called me on another number I was shocked and then the tears flowed.” For Mehta, the National Award has come as a vindication of many things. After a potent start to his film career with Jayate and Dil Par Mat Le Yaar , Mehta lost his unique voice and was written off by the media when he delivered an absolute dud like Woodstock Villa .\n\nHis colleagues like Anurag Kashyap had reached a different level and Mehta with his weakness for alcohol was going nowhere. “It took me some time to regain my sanity after Woodstock Villa but when I read the story of Shahid Azmi in a newspaper I realised I have found the tool to convey what I was going through. I was agitated about the developments in the society and in Shahid I found a catalyst to weave a narrative. It is not just redemption of sorts but also a vindication of the fact that commitment pays in the long run. I called Shahid’s brother Khalid and he was happy. “"
