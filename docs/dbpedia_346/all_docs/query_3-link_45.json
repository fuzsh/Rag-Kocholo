        "text": "Muhammad Usman Shahid M.D., is an Assistant Professor of Clinical Interventional Radiology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Dr. Shahid earned his medical degree from Rutgers University - New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) and completed an internship in General Surgery at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, PA. He then went on to complete his residency in Diagnostic Radiology with Early Specialization in Interventional Radiology at Rutgers NJMS. Notably, he conducted the first live animal studies within the Rutgers Department of Radiology, studying the influence of exercise on inferior vena cava wall interactions. For his achievements, he was awarded the resident research award. Dr. Shahid helped establish a medical student elective in Interventional Radiology and served as a workshop leader for New Jerseyâ€™s inaugural and largest IR interest group. For his efforts, Dr. Shahid was awarded the Rutgers NJMS Golden Apple Award for outstanding excellence in medical student and resident education.\n\nDr. Shahid subsequently completed Vascular and Interventional Radiology training at Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein School of Medicine in New York City. He joined the division of Vascular and Interventional Radiology at the University of Miami in 2022.\n\nDr. Shahid has broad and active clinical interests in minimally invasive image-guided treatments for liver and renal cancers. These treatments include Yttirum-90 radioembolization, chemoembolization, and thermal ablative therapies (innovative microwave and cryoablation technologies). He also focuses on minimally invasive treatments for portal hypertension, including therapies such as Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) and Balloon Occlusion Retrograde Transvenous Obliteration of Gastric Varices (BRTO). Dr. Shahid utilizes the trans-radial (TR) technique for arterial access through the wrist during oncologic interventions, uterine embolization for fibroids, and prostate embolization which allow earlier ambulation, and shorter post-operative recovery unit time.\n\nHis interests also include advanced IVC filter removal techniques, venous thromboembolic disease, superficial varicose veins and Pulmonary embolism. In addition, he performs endovascular management of peripheral arterial disease, image-guided spine interventions, and advanced biliary reconstruction.\n\nDr. Shahid has authored and co-authored numerous peer reviewed journal articles and a book chapter on venous thromboembolic disease. Dr. Shahid has been a live case operator presenting at the New York Endovascular Summit. He is an active member in the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR)."
