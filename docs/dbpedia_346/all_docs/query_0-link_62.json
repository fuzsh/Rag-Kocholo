Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence 2024/25: Built on our strong international research profile (consistently ranked in the top 200 in the world over the past decade by various ranking systems, and particularly strong in publication performance, e.g. 7th in UK by the \"NTU Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities\" (Subject: Computer Science, 2023), we offer the MSc Artificial Intelligence course with great flexibility (1 year full-time, 2 year part-time or 3 year staged study). If you are interested, apply here. 15 Scholarships available for applicants from under-represented groups, £10,000 of each. Research & Development Collaboration: Developing downstream applications of large AI models is a focused area of my group in the upcoming years. Contact me if you have a collaboration project. We can assist in securing funding from sources like UKRI, EU, or Innovate UK, potentially cutting your costs in the project significantly (e.g. by 1/3 or more), plus the university's input. Please visit my personal website where you may find more details of my research. Computer vision, image processing, video analysis, medical imaging, bio-imaging, machine learning, pattern recognition, automatic control and nonlinear filtering.
