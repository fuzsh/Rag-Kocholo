Helmed by Atlee, the film starred Shah Rukh, Nayanthara, Sanya Malhotra, Priyamani, Deepika Padukone and Sanjay Dutt (in extended cameo roles).\n\nAbout Animal\n\nAnimal, helmed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, was one of the biggest blockbusters of 2023. However, it was also criticised for its depiction of misogyny. The film starred Ranbir Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, Anil Kapoor, and Bobby Deol in the lead roles.\n\nAnimal revolves around a troubled father-son relationship and has Ranbir in the role of Rannvijay Singh, who goes on to exact revenge after there's an assassination attempt on his father. The film raked in over ₹800 crore at the box office."
