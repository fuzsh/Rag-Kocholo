        "text": "Dr. Shahid is a cardiovascular/metabolic pharmacologist/physiologist. He earned his Ph.D., in cardiovascular pharmacology from the University of Delhi. He completed his postdoctoral fellowship in cardiovascular and metabolic medicine in 2012 at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Harvard Medical School in Boston. He went on to become an Instructor in Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School till 2017. Prior to coming to Rosalind Franklin University, Dr. Shahid was an Associate Professor and the Director of Research at Chicago State University College of Pharmacy. Dr. Shahid has an active research program primarily focused on the role of immune cells in metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. Dr. Shahid’s research has been supported by funding from the National Institute of Health (NIH), the American Heart Association, Harvard University, and Chicago State University. He was awarded the Faculty Excellence Award in Research for three consecutive years which is given to the best researcher at the Chicago State University. He has been invited as a guest speaker at many reputed institutions including MGH, Rush University, California Northstate University, and internationally at Leducq Foundation, University of Cambridge; Northern Border University, KSA; and Hamdard University, New Delhi.\n\nCourses\n\nFundamentals of Pharmacology (YPHS 514)\n\nPharmacology II (YPHS 626)\n\nPharmacology III (YPHS 627)\n\nResearch Elective (YELS 901)\n\nResearch Interest\n\nDr. Shahid’s primary research interest consist of understanding the role of immune cells, particularly macrophages in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders and exploring its translational significance. The ongoing research in his laboratory is particularly investigating the role of various immune cells-specific Immediate Early Response Gene X-1 (IEX-1) in the development of obesity, atherosclerosis, and osteoporosis. His lab employs several unique mouse models such as tissue-specific conditional knockout, double mutant, and transgenic mice, as well as various state-of-the-art techniques including in situ imaging system, fluorescent microscope, siRNA-mediated gene silencing etc.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned projects, Dr. Shahid is also interested in understanding the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy. His lab previously reported that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling contributes to the development of cardiac hypertrophy and its blockade prevented pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in mice. The current investigation is focused on determining the underlying molecular mechanism by which BMP signaling promotes hypertrophy and its translational significance.\n\nFunding\n\nNational Institute of Health SC3\n\nAmerican Heart Association AIREA\n\nNational Institute of Health KO1\n\nHarvard University Shore’s Fellowship\n\nRecent Publication\n\nSiddiqui MR, Reddy NM, Faridi HM, Shahid M, Shanley TP.
