        "text": "I specialize in bringing world-class CTO, CISO, and EiR expertise to startups, business units and companies on a part-time (fractional) basis. With a rich background in regulated, safety-critical industries like Med Devices, Digital Health, and Gov 2.0, I possess a unique understanding of complex, high-demand products and services.\n\nI'm a C-suite native that can easily blend in with technical and engineering teams that need to deliver revenue-generating solutions to the marketplace. I've served as an Entrepreneur in Residence when a market seems lucrative but it's unclear how to build and launch products and services for such opportunities.\n\nI have years of leadership experience as a co-founding startup CTO for multiple venture-backed companies, business unit CTO and EiR, and public company CTO helping transform product teams from marginal to high performance.\n\nMy software/hardware engineering and cybersecurity body of knowledge is up to date because I roll up my sleeves to create code when appropriate & dive into system architecture and design when required. I also conduct technology due diligence exercises for corporate acquisition or product integration requirements."
