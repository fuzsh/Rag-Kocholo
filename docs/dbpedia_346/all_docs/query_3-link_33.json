As the Principal Investigator and project manager for about 21 years he assembled and led a multi-disciplinary team of two dozen current and past professors and experts and about seventy five students in the project to develop the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model for wind loss and flood loss. The model has been used over 2,000 times by the state of Florida to evaluate rate filings and conduct stress tests on insurance companies. He is also director of an entrepreneurial venture for FIU Research Foundation that provides hurricane loss modeling service to about thirty client companies in the private sector. Outside of research, Professor Hamid has conducted seminars for executives, served as occasional consultant, and participated and testified in legislative and public hearings. He has been interviewed frequently on professional topics by the print and TV news media.\n\nDr. Hamid has produced about 270 refereed academic journal papers, proceedings, book chapters, conference presentations, and technical reports.
