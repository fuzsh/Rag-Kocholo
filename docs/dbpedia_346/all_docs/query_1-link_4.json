Got so entangled in your words) is a 2024 Indian Hindi-language science fiction romantic comedy film starring Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon. The film is written and directed by Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah, in their directorial debuts, and produced by Maddock Films and Jio Studios.[5]\n\nPrincipal photography commenced in October 2022 and ended in April 2023. The film was released theatrically on 9 February 2024 to mixed reviews from critics.[6] It became the fourth-highest-grossing Hindi film of 2024.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAryan Agnihotri is a Delhi-born smart robotics engineer based in Mumbai, taking after his aunt, Urmila Shukla, who has a company of her own, E-Robotics, in Los Angeles. She invites him to America, where he eventually meets the Super Intelligent Female Robot Automation (SIFRA) who is Urmila's secretary. He falls in love with her but later learns that she is actually a robot and ploy used by his aunt to test if humans could tell SIFRA apart from themselves.\n\nHeartbroken, he returns to India and agrees to an arranged marriage with another woman. However, when he realizes his love for SIFRA, he decides to sneak out of the engagement ceremony and is caught by his grandfather, who suggests him to follow his heart and assures him that he will handle the family in his absence. Aryan wishes for SIFRA to be in India so that he could introduce her to his family; he calls up his aunt to ask her to send her to India for further \"testing\" against a traditional Indian family. She agrees for it and sends her to India, where Aryan introduces her as his girlfriend to his family leading to numerous comical situations.\n\nAryan's family, unaware that she is a robot, agree to their marriage. Before their wedding, she installs a faulty update ridden with a virus which corrupts her memory and causes her to forget everything. Aryan calls his aunt to ask for help, and she sends him a memory backup which Aryan installs, causing her to successfully recover her memory. Urmila, who was unaware of Aryan's intentions of marrying her, is against him after knowing the truth and orders him to return her as she is her company's IP. He manages to convince his aunt after an emotional conversation, who agrees to let him keep her.\n\nOn their wedding day, a blackout occurs while SIFRA is charging herself, which causes her to malfunction. Her speech becomes distorted and movements begin to glitch while she performs orders given to her previously that were taken back, one of them being \"setting Delhi on fire\". Looking at the destruction caused by her, a heartbroken Aryan is left with no choice but to stop her, ultimately by slashing her face with a sword, which reveals the inner technical workings of her, and realizes that even though she looks human, she can never truly be one.\n\nAt a tech show in Mumbai, Urmila launches a new series of robots, including SIFRA 2.0. The new SIFRA has her memory and settings formatted and Aryan is no longer her admin. Jiah, a new intern, approaches Aryan and flirts with him. Looking at their bonding, the new SIFRA starts to feel jealous and Aryan notices her emotions, shocked of coming to the realization that she can have feelings of her own now.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2022, Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon were signed to star in Dinesh Vijan's next robot rom-com.[8] Production began in October 2022 and ended in April 2023.[9] In November 2022 the song \"Akhiyaan Gulab\" was filmed at beach.
