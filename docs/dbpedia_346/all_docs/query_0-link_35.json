        "text": "Movies with elements of entertainment, education, food for thought, that inspire, explore human values, social issues, the environment, as well as light hearted fare and comedies are some of my favorites. My reviews include a few current movies as well as those on videos and DVDs. These reviews tend to inform whether the movies are dramas, comedies or other, without diminishing the viewerâs sense of wonder, excitement and anticipation of what is coming next.\n\nFor current movie listings, please click on the link below.\n\nYour reviews on movies are always welcome. Reach me via, The Contact Form. You may also email me, Nirmala at, npather@gmail.com\n\nThe movies are rated by stars, with 5 stars being the very best and 1 star being poor. The review links are on the right hand side, categorized by the ratings.\n\nEntourage\n\nThe only reason I went to see the movie was that I had heard such great things about the TV show with the same actors. I also like Jeremy Piven and enjoyed his performance as Mr. Selfridge. There was a review for the movie gave it 4 stars.\n\nMaybe it is my age, but I could not stand the movie and would have walked out but for the fact I went to the late night show and everything around the theater would be closed. My husband did not want to leave as he believed it would soon get better.\n\nI did not find it funny to have the actors playing characters with excellent acting skills but kind of very low on morals as far as being loyal in relationships. Women appear just for the satisfaction of men, often scantily clad.\n\nIt may appeal to a younger crowd and this is just my opinion.\n\nSelma\n\nI watched this movie recently and really enjoyed it. It helped me to learn a little more about the events of Selma and how this led to African Americans get voting rights.\n\nIt highlights the bravery of the people to participate in non violent ways to make changes for justice. It also highlights the bravery of the remarkable, Dr Martin Luther King for leading the marches and advocating non violent means to achieve goals. It is mind blowing that he was so young when he achieved so much.\n\nThe actors include: David Oyelowo as Dr. Martin Luther King, Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon B. Johnson, Tim Roth as George Wallace, Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, and rapper and actor Common as Bevel, amongst other actors.\n\nI highly recommend this movie.\n\nThe Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared.\n\nThis is a 2013 Swedish comedy film directed by Felix Herngren based on the novel of the same name by Jonas Jonasson.\n\nThe 100 year old man is depicted by Robert Gustafsson as Allan Karlsson. Others in the cast all gave a great performance. I simply loved this movie. It has so many elements to it, humor, tension and thrill, drama, love, action, and just excellent acting. On his 100th birthday, a man climbs out of the window of this nursing home and goes on an unexpected, unplanned adventure of a life time. There are flashbacks of his earlier life, that has reference to who he is.\n\nHe is sort of very casual about what has happened and how he has acquired a suitcase full of money. There are so many tense moments when you fear for his life. Yet he comes through the most challenging situation with an innocence and sort of unawareness of what could have been!!\n\nA very funny movie that I enjoyed a great deal.\n\nThe Imitation Game\n\nI cannot stop raving about this awesome movie. It is based on the life of Alan Turing whose invention of what is believed to be one of the earliest computers, helped to end World War 2 and saved thousands of lives.\n\nHe built a machine to decode the German's plans of attack. For that time period, this invention was a novel one. His efforts to build the machine however were not approved of by his boss. Secretly, he was able to get approval from the prime minister himself\n\nThere is a very intelligent female scientist who assisted him in this invention and was supportive to him in his private life. Apart from the amazing invention of f this amazing man the actor who played him, Benedict Cumberbatch was outstanding. Keira Knightly as the female scientist, Joan Clarke, was excellent as well. Please see this movie. I give it a 5 star rating.\n\nKill The Messenger\n\nThe movie was gripping, soul searching, sad and very well enacted. It is based on a true story. Newspaper Journalist Gary Webb, happens to stumble across some incriminating evidence of the CIA's knowledge of cocaine being brought into the country and and using the profits to arm rebels fighting in Nicaragua.\n\nHe is first praised for his article but then, those in authority attempt to put an end to this by challenging his character and integrity. Watch it for the rest of the moving story. Very highly recommended.\n\nBoyhood\n\nThis is very interesting and unusual movie. I enjoyed it a lot. It is filmed over a 12 year period, with the same actors playing their roles over a 12 year period. It was interesting to see the physical and emotional change, especially in the children. They are first filmed when the little boy is 6 years old and ends when he is 18 and going off to college.\n\nThe actors include: Ethan Hawke Lorelai Linklater, Patricia Arquette and Ellar Coltrane amongst others.\n\nThis type of move has not been made before. The growing up is seen through the eyes of a child named Mason,â who literally grows up on screen before our eyes.â It brings into fore, Masonâs view of the struggles of his single mother, the time spent with his dad, his relationship with his sister and neighborhood friends, moving house and school and so forth.\n\nThere are joyous moments like celebrations of birthdays, family trips and graduations, as well as disappointments, relationship problems, parenting problems and the journey through all of that. I thought the movie was very well enacted and I would recommend it highly.\n\nTracks\n\nI thought this movie was awe- inspiring and portrayed determination, the will to succeed and the focus on the goal. It is based on the true story of Robyn Davidson a young lady who walked across 1,700 miles of beautiful Australian outback by herself. The trip was from Alice Springs, Australia across the desert to the Indian Ocean.\n\nRobyn Davidson wrote a book about her journey and the movie is based on this book. The trip was sponsored by National Geographic after Robyn was advised to as whe was running out of funds. She preferred to have no media involved but had to for the sake of funding. A photographer , Rick Smolond, (Adam Drive) of National Geographic captures the beautiful scenes and Robynâs adventures.\n\nThe role of Robyn is played by talented Australian actress Mia Wasikowski. The local people are at first surprised and amused about Robynâs plan but as they see her determination and efforts to work, earn money and get her camels, she is seen as a serious person and they offer her advice and assistance.\n\nThe movie has flashbacks to what drove her to undertake this journey. It depicts the difficulties and challenges she faced on her trip and then achieving her ultimate goal. I highly recommend this very well enacted movie.\n\nShahid\n\nThe movie was made in 2013. It is in Hindi with English subtitles. The lead actor Raj Kumar Yadav portrays real life lawyer Shahid Azmi, a human rights activist who was assassinated in Mumbai in 2010.\n\nThe movie is based on true events. A young man his experience at the hands of his jailers, influences his decision to become a lawyer. He gives everything to fight for fairness and justice for those wrongly accused as terrorists.\n\nVery well enacted. It is also troubling to see the extent of inept investigations and conclusions that are arrived at on the whim of those in power. Highly recommended.\n\nTims Vermeer\n\nMy son had seen this movie and described it as âmindblowing.â I then had to see it for my self and I absolutely agree.\n\nTim Jenison, a successful entrepreneur and inventor, was also interested in art. The painting, \"Girl with a Pearl Earringâ by Dutch artist, Johannes Vermeer fascinated him as it almost appeared like a photograph. Yet photography was only invented about 150 years later.\n\nBeing an engineer, he wondered if Vermeer had used certain tools to achieve effects like the light that was portrayed on his subjects. He wondered if was able to paint by seeing a reflection of his subjects, and used brush stokes to then paint, giving it a different effect than if he was painting by looking at the subject directly.\n\nHe figured out a way to create a mirror like effect and do a painting himself. Although he had never painted before, he was able to create a very good piece of artwork.\n\nHe consulted experts in the art world, who believed that Vermeer had used a different technique. The movie describes Timâs journey to, England, Delft, Holland where the artist painted the picture, and consultations with other experts . He takes in all the details and creates a replica of this room where the paining was done and tries this technique.\n\nThe result is just amazing, âmind-blowing,â wonderful to see. A must see movie.\n\nBegin Again\n\nKeira Knightly, Mark Ruffalo and Adam Levine have lead roles. Although the movie has elements of disappointment and sadness, there are many joyous events and an opportunity to begin again.\n\nThe story is believable and heartwarming. It is a feel good movie without being soppy. In the movie, Keira's performance as a singer whose talent was largely overshadowed by her boyfriendâs is kind of sweet revenge. It is interesting that in real life her talent as a singer was not known until she had the role in this movie. Highly recommended.\n\nThe Railway Man\n\nI cannot say enough about this excellent, great, wonderful, thoughtful, sad yet joyous movie. It is based on the memoir of Eric Lomax who was tortured as a prisoner of war by the Japanese in World War 11. Colin Firth gives an excellent performance as Eric Lomax, who, together with fellow soldiers suffer from PSTD, but choose not to talk about their painful experiences.\n\nThere are beautiful moments that capture the love that develops between Patti (Nicole Kidman) and Eric. When there is news of the whereabouts that the former tormentor, the responsibility is Ericâs to get revenge.\n\nThe movie has very vivid scenes of torture and it is portrayed very realistically. The latter scenes when Eric meets the tormentor takes on a different dimension and you have to see it to appreciate it.\n\nIt is a must see movie. Very highly recommended. Colin Firth is definitely one of my favorite actors.\n\nSkyfall\n\nI always enjoy the James Bond movies. This movie has lots of action, bad guys, romance, and the problems finally being resolved, but not without losing some good guys as well. The actors include Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Judi Dench. If you are looking for light entertainment, and some escapism you will enjoy this movie.\n\nThe Lunchbox\n\nI really enjoyed this movie. The acting was excellent. The depiction of loneliness, rejection, poverty and the excitement and thrill of new possibilities were so very well portrayed. The movie is set in Mumbai, India.\n\nThe cramped trains and other modes of transportation for commuters sets the tone of the hustle and bustle of the city. A dhaba or lunch box that was meant to be for Ilaâs husband is delivered in error, (by the dabbawalas/the delivery guys, to another person. The recipient returns the lunch box with a note. This begins a correspondence between Irrfan Khan, as Saajan Fernandez and Nimrat Kaur as Ila.\n\nThe nature of the correspondence opens up the thoughts and feelings about the lives of these 2 people, connecting you to them as you follow their story. Another lead star is Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Shaikh. I highly recommend this movie.\n\nLocke\n\nThe whole movie is set in a car where Ivan Locke, (movie star, Tom Hardy), is driving to London on an urgent mission. But he has a very urgent job to supervise the pouring of concrete in Birmingham the next morning. He is the construction foreman.\n\nAlso, he has arranged to watch a football game with his family that evening, but is unable to do it because of this pressing issue. He makes a series of phone calls, to his boss and his colleague, explaining that he has this urgent mission, giving instructions on what to do, argues with them and so forth. Then he has to take calls from the person he is to visit and explain the delay in heavy traffic but that he is on his way.\n\nHe has to explain his absence to his son and then his wife. All this is done with urgency, anxiousness, anxiety, frustration and regret. This decision that he makes for this trip is influenced by something in his past. But it has the effect of breaking his family and losing his job. I am not mentioning the reason for the journey as I will be letting on too much. I highly recommend the movie.\n\nDallas Buyers Club\n\nThe movie is based on a true story. When drug addict and homophobic Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), was diagnosed with HIV and given 30 days to live, he was horrified at the diagnosis and could not believe that he had contracted the disease.\n\nThe movie centers on his dissatisfaction with the drug of choice, AZT, at that time, and his attempts to explore other resources. He finds great relief from medications available in Mexico and Japan. However these are not approved by the FDA and are therefore not authorized. He imports these illegally and soon starts distributing these to others with HIV and AIDâs.\n\nOne of his doctorâs Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) is sympathetic to his situation as she too is not satisfied with the drugs presently used by the FDA. There are realistic scenes of the attempts to bring in the illegal drugs, the large number of people willing to buy the drugs, drug busts by the police, being ostracized by his friends and the emotional toll of all of these factors on Ron Woodroof, fellow partner, transgender, Rayon (Jared Leto), as well as others with the disease.\n\nThe acting is of a very high standard. Matthew McConaughey lost 50 pounds and Jared Leto lost 30 pounds for their roles. The movie has sexual content and swears words so I would not recommend this as a family movie but it is an excellent movie for adults.\n\n12 Years A Slave\n\nThe following paragraph is from Wikipedia. The description was just what I was looking for, so thanks to Wikipedia\n\n12 Years a Slave is a 2013 British-American historical drama film, an adaptation of the 1853 autobiography Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup, a free black man who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery. He worked on plantations in the state of Louisiana for 12 years before his release. The first scholarly edition of Northup's memoir, co-edited by Sue Eakin and Joseph Logsdon in 1968, carefully retraced and validated his account, finding it to be remarkably accurate. The film is directed by Steve McQueen and written by John Ridley. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Solomon Northup.\n\nOther actors include:Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Brad Pitt, and Alfre Woodard, amongst others.\n\nThe movie is disturbing but the cruel treatment of slaves did exist and we all need to remember that. The acting is superb. Very moving. I urge everyone to see this important movie.\n\nThe Butler\n\nThe movie, The Butler, is based on the life of Eugene Allen, an African American, who worked at the White House as a butler during eight presidential administrations from 1952 to 1986, beginning with President Eisenhower and ending with President Reagan.\n\nThere are parts of the movie that are fictionalized, like the character of the son, Lewis. In reality, there was just one son and he did not die in Vietnam. As the butler moves through several administrations, the movie highlights historical events of that period, such as the struggle to break racial barriers and the plight of Blacks at the hands of white owners in cotton fields in the south, as well as the treatment of Blacks by society in general.\n\nThe struggle to end segregation, the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King are also depicted. As a butler, Eugene Allen, depicted as Cecil Gaines, (Forest Whitaker), is often present at presidential discussions and is sometimes asked his opinion on matters. A Butlers role is stoic and unobtrusive, such, that his presence should not be noticed.\n\nThe movie, directed by Lee Daniel's, stars Oprah Winfrey as Cecilâs wife, Gloria. There are other notable stars such as Robin Williams, Lieve Schreiber, John Cusack, Alan Rickman, who play cameo roles as presidents. Jane Fonda plays a cameo role as Nancy Reagan.\n\nThe movie had me spellbound from the very beginning. The acting is excellent. The struggle for freedom and the unjust treatment of so many innocent people of color is very well depicted. An excellent, must see movie. Very Highly Recommended.\n\nJobs\n\nAshton Kutcher stars as Steve Jobs, who started the Apple company, Apple Computers and of course the Ipads, Iphones and Ipods amongst so many creative and brilliant innovations. The movie begins with the launch of the Ipod and then goes back to Jobs' early days of creating software. Together with his friend, Steve Wozniak, they showcase their idea to an audience that is not entirely convinced by their demonstration.\n\nIt is interesting to see their humble beginnings in a garage and their struggle to sell their products. But Steve Jobs, is focused and dedicated to perfection to a fault. His obsession on wanting things done his way and demands on his colleagues estranges and hurts even his close friends.\n\nThe movie depicts this facet of his character very well, including his success, then being fired from his company and his comeback to make Apple great again. In spite of shortcomings of his character, I marveled at his brilliance and his ability to create something that people do not know that they need right now. It is sad that such a genius died so early in life. The movie is highly recommended.\n\nSatyagraha\n\nAmitabh Bachan stars as a highly principled ex school teacher, Dwarka Anand, who looks down upon corruption and is disdainful about all those who promote such a culture. When his beloved son, Indraneil Sengupta, Akilesh, an engineer, is killed in an accident, he accepts the compensation that is offered to assist his daughter in law and provide tuition to his students.\n\nBut when nothing comes forth and his daughter in law is given the run around, he himself goes to the authorities to request the money that was promised. He is treated with insults and he reacts by slapping an official. He is imprisoned for this action.\n\nThe movie centers on the fight to overcome the corruption of city officials, who treat the villages with disrespect. Their applications for assistance are backed up and they have to pay the officials part of the money that they receive. Ajay Devgan, Manav, a close friend of Akilesh, supports Dwarka Anand in fighting corruption. A bitter standoff occurs. What was intended to be a peaceful protest turns violent and Dwarka Anand begins a fast which he will end when the officials pay the villagers for all that is owed to them.\n\nWhat I liked about the movie is that it is realistic, in that, trying to overcome the corrupt officials is not easy, there are layers of corruption going right to the top. The acting was very good. The music was good.\n\nWhat I did not like about the movie was that it was too long, almost 3 hours and this took away from the pace of the movie. If you have the time and are big fans of Amitabh Bachan and Ajay Devgan, then go and watch the movie. Recommended\n\nKahaani\n\nKahaani means story in Hindi. It is a Hindi movie with English sub-titles. The movie is gripping from the very beginning catches your attention right away. It is a drama/mystery/thriller movie that is very well enacted by the lead actress, Vidyabalan who plays Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant woman searching for her missing husband in Kolkata during the festival of Durga Puja.\n\nOther lead actors include Satyaki “Rana” Sinha (Parambrata Chatterjee) and Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui).\n\nThe search for Arnab Bagchi, the missing husband is the theme of the movie, but as the mystery unfolds you see how the first scene connects with the rest of the movie.\n\nAnother highlight for me was the poem/song, performed by Amitabh Bachan, Ekla Chole Re, which was written by the Bengali Poet, Rabindranath Tagore.\n\nA highly recommended movie.\n\nKai Po Che\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the film title, Kai Po Chhe is originally a Gujarati phrase that means “I have cut the kite, ” which refers to a kite competition where one of the competitors uses his kite to cut off another competitors kite and yells “Kai Po Che!“\n\nThe movie is based on a book by Chetan Bhagat, The 3 Mistakes of My Life.

The only female lead, Vidya is played by, Amrita Puri, as a sister of Ishaan and love interest of Govind.\n\nAll the characters are very likeable and despite, fights, arguments and temporary breakups they always get back and support each other. They have a great love of cricket. Ishaan was not able to pursue his career as a cricketer due to obstacles. Together they open a sports shop and an academy to train and promote budding cricketers.\n\nThey recognize the talent of a local boy and begin to tutor him. Amidst this friendship, there are financial struggles, family squabbles, political parties and conflicts and an earthquake that destroys a new store that they began.\n\nThere are also dramatic and realistic moments in the movie that steer journey of these friends and the boy that they tutor. If I say more, I will be giving away the story. I highly recommend the movie which is in Hindi with English sub titles\n\nThe Internship\n\nVince Vaughn and Owen Wilson star as interns at Google. Having lost their jobs as salesmen, Billy and Nicky embark on a chance to intern at Google by enrolling in an online university. While in reality, getting an internship at Google is very difficult to achieve, Billy and Nick are accepted as interns\n\nTheir challenges with technology makes for some comedic scenes. But they also possess life skills and often help their team to win. There are also lessons that one should connect with other aspects of living and not just have a total one sided approach to life.\n\nThe movie was entertaining, funny with teachable moments as well. Highly recommended\n\nA Royal Affair\n\n“ A Royal Affair, (Danish: En kongelig affÃ¦re) is a 2012 historical drama film directed by Nikolaj Arcel, starring Mads Mikkelsen, Alicia Vikander and Mikkel FÃ¸lsgaard. The story is set in the 18th century, at the court of the mentally ill King Christian VII of Denmark, and focuses on the romance between his wife, Caroline Matilda of Great Britain, and the royal physician Struensee. “ as aptly described in Wikipedia.\n\nThe acting was excellent by all. Mikkel FÃ¸lsgaard, as the king, Christian VII of Denmark who is mentally ill, gave an outstanding performance as childish, other times demanding, someone with no backbone and is totally taken advantage of by the parliament. The country is really run by officials for their gain and exploitation of the poor. Alicia Vikander as Caroline Matilda only learns of his condition when she arrives in Denmark from Britain.\n\nMads Mikkelsen as Johann Friedrich Struensee, gives a great performance as a friend to the king, supporter of the downtrodden and as the lover of the queen. Despite his love for the queen, he supports the king who gains confidence in his role. With the influence of Struensee, and the support of Caroline Matilda, the country improves conditions for the common people\n\nYou have to see the movie to find out how things turn out. It is a gripping movie, that not only tells a story of these principal characters but you get a glimpse of history and life in 18th century Denmark.\n\nKon-Tiki\n\nThis movie that is based on a true story of the Kon-Tiki expedition. It depicts the voyage of Thor Heyerdahl and 5 friends, in 1947, who set out to prove that it was possible that Polynesian Islands were inhabited by South Americans. He theorized that South American explorers could have sailed to the island on rafts. In pre-Columbian times a raft was the method of travel on the high seas.\n\nWhen his theory, on which he based his Masters Thesis, was not accepted as being possible, he took the challenge to make the trip himself. You will find more more details about the events leading to the Kon-Tiki expedition, at websites like, Wikipedia.\n\nThor Heyerdhal was a Norwegian explorer and writer. He wrote a book about his successful expedition. This followed with a movie in 1951 directed by Thor Heyerdhal and a documentary. I saw the recent 2013 version and really enjoyed it.\n\nIt is amazing that these adventurers survived this trip. The acting was excellent and the movie has the benefit of teaching a new generation about the courage and real life adventures of true survivors. The cast include:\n\nPÃ¥l Sverre Valheim Hagen as Thor Heyerdahl, Anders Baasmo Christiansen as Herman Watzinger, Tobias Santelmann as Knut Haugland, Gustaf SkarsgÃ¥rd as Bengt Danielsson, and Odd Magnus Williamson as Erik Hesselberg.\n\nThe move is highly recommended\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nThe recent version of the Great Gatsby, stars Leonardo DiCaprio, one of my favorite actors and, Joel Edgerton, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, amongst other stars. The movie is based on the book, The Great Gatsby,\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nGatsby is played by Leornardo Di Caprio. He is excellent in his role as the, wealthy, handsome, mysterious young man, besotted by Daisy, (Carey Mulligan). How his love for Daisy impacts his life is the theme of the movie.\n\nIt was interesting to see the glamorous lifestyles as well as people affected by poverty in the early 1920's. A highly recommended movie\n\nSparkle\n\nThe stars are Jordin Sparks and the late Whitney Houston. Ms. Houston takes the role of a single mother whose singing career was not a successful one. She is very protective of her 3 daughters, her manner bordering on demanding and authoritarian.\n\nThe movie depicts the young talented sisters supporting each other in making a living as singers, in spite of their mothers disapproval. The movie showcases the talent of the singers. It brings in relationship issues and struggles with drug addiction and domestic violence.\n\nScenes like the sisters struggle to get to the top, the domestic violence and addictions does lend a sense of the real world. This together with the excellent singers made this an interesting movie, which I recommend.\n\nBeasts of the Southern Wild\n\nBeasts of the Southern Wild is a fantasy drama film directed by Benh Zeitlin and written by Zeitlin and Lucy Alibar from Alibar's one-act play Juicy and Delicious.The film is nominated for four Academy Awards at the 85th Academy Awards, in the categories Best Picture, Best Director (Benh Zeitlin), Best Adapted Screenplay (Lucy Alibar, Benh Zeitlin) and Best Actress (QuvenzhanÃ© Wallis). At the age of 9, Wallis is the youngest ever nominee of the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nQuvenzhanÃ© Wallis stars as as Hushpuppy and Dwight Henry as Wink, her father, who is in very poor health. Little Hushpuppy is abandoned by her mother and raised by her dad. Hushpuppy is a child and is very close to her father, with some scenes of a stormy relationship between them as well. This bayou Louisiana community is isolated from the rest of the world by a levee.\n\nThere is a storm approaching and Wink takes steps to protect his daughter from the storm that threatens. The community rally together in finding a solution by breaking the levee. There is a message of hope, loss and revival. The quality of acting is superb. The lead actress, QuvenzhanÃ© Wallis was only 5-6 years old when making the movie. I was so impressed with her acting performance. This movie is highly recommended.\n\nThe Sessions\n\nThe actors are Helen Hunt, who plays the role of Cheryl Cohen-Greene, a sex surrogate and John Hawkes who plays Mark O'Brien a poet who is paralyzed.\n\nThe movie is based on a true story about Mark O'Brien who was struck by polio at the age of six, and paralyzed from the neck down. He needed a lung machine to breathe and was confined on a gurney. O'Brien, a very intelligent young man, attended college and became a poet and writer.\n\nDespite strong religious beliefs, Mark O' Brien's desire for intimacy led him to hire a sex surrogate, Cheryl Cohen-Greene, to lose his virginity. He had several discussions with his priest about this subject. The role of the priest, Father Brendan was enacted by another of my favorite actors, William H Macy.\n\nThis movie is based on an essay, \"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate\", written by O'Brien about his experiences with Greene. The essay appeared in The Sun magazine in 1990.\n\nThe movie was written and directed by Ben Lewin. The actors gave great performances and it invoked feelings of sympathy, admiration and a real respect for Mark O' Brien. I highly recommend this movie\n\nThe Life of PI\n\nThis movie is reviewed by Shyam Sundar.\n\n“Life of PI. Amazed me so much. A Tamizh lullaby (Bombay Jashree) opens the movie with title, how can you not love the movie. Top notch cinematography, dazzling CG, beautiful story telling, and Amazing philosophy.\n\nAfter one point of time the protagonist and the predator exist in a labyrinth of a never ending game of chess, where the two lonely kings play their moves to either finish it or bail out. Ultimate surrender is the key to salvation.\n\nIt is both simple and complex in a way. Choose your story, is the tag line.”\n\nShyam also recommends that one see it on the Imax theater. Encouraged by Shyam's review, I went to see the movie and also enjoyed it greatly. I saw it in 3D. This heightened the experience of the scenes in the water, the ferocious tiger and various other scenes.\n\nThe character of PI is enacted by 3 actors at various stages of his life. They include, Gautam Belur, as 5 year old Pi, Ayush Tandon as an 11/12 year old PI, Suraj Sharma as PI in his teens, Irrfan Khan as the adult PI. Life of Pi is a fantasy adventure based on the novel by Yann Martel, published in 2001. The book has received awards as well. The director of the movie is Ang Lee\n\nThe movie is highly recommended\n\nLincoln\n\nDaniel Day Lewis, a 2 times Oscar winner, stars as President Lincoln, the 16th President. He is one of my favorite actors. The movie is directed by Steven Spielberg. Daniel Day Lewis' role in this movie is such a contrast to the mean, character in. There Will Be Blood.\n\nHe plays Lincoln as a good orator, calm and gentle, with sense of humor, a family man, yet steadfast in his will to pass legislation that will end slavery and the war in the south.\n\nHis wife is played by Sally Field, also a 2 times Oscar winning actress. She depicts the troubled and often times sad mother, in a very believable way. Another of my favorite actors, James Spader, plays a lobbyist, trying to get votes that will help to enact the 13th Amendment.\n\nIt was interesting to see the governmental process at work, the volatile, debates and differences between the 2 parties. This movie is highly recommended\n\nArgo\n\nArgo is based on a true story of the rescue of six U.S. Diplomats from Tehran, Iran during the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis. It is directed by and stars Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, a CIA operative who lead the rescue.\n\nWhat I found so amazing was the plan that they used to rescue the diplomats. It was risky, but in the light of no other options, this plan is given the go ahead. The movie depicts tense situations, but well done and very realistic. A highly recommended movie, but may not be suitable for young kids as there is a lot of swear words.\n\nThe Kingâs Speech\n\nI loved this movie.So great. The actors included, Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush & Helena Bonham Carter amongst others. I think Colin Firth totally deserved his Best Actor Awards for his performance as King Georg VI, who stammered. Ms. Carter made a very supportive and loving queen.\n\nGeoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue, is the unconventional speech therapist to the King. His performance was amazing and I feel that he deserved some kind of an award. His performance was that good.\n\nIt is based on the true events surrounding the abdication of the throne by his brother, King Edward VIII. The movie portrays King George VI, (Colin Firth), as a caring family man, content in that role, & looking forward to his brother ruling the kingdom. He is terrified of having to become King after his brother abdicates.\n\nIt is the beginning of World War II and the country needs to hear the support of the King. Thus far his few public speeches have been marred by his stammering. He has tried various therapists and is frustrated by them\n\nThe movie centers around the relationship between the King and Lionel Logue, his new speech therapist. The movie is entertaining and brings forth so many emotions, sympathy, humor, empathy, perseverance, disappointment and of course triumph and joy.I would encourage everyone to see this outstanding movie. For those with speech impediments it will be a source of encouragement.\n\nTrue Grit\n\nIt was refreshing to see an American Western film after a long, long time. True Grit was written and directed by the Coen brothers. It is the second adaptation of Charles Portis' 1968 novel of the same name, which was previously adapted for film in 1969 starring John Wayne. The film stars Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross, and Jeff Bridges as U.S. Marshal Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn along with Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper.\n\nThe actors do a tremendous job in their roles. I loved Jeff Bridges as the Marshall. The accents were very authentic. The movie received 10 academy nominations. I think 14 year old Hailie Steinfeld was amazing in her role as a young child, determined to seek justice for her father's murder.\n\nIt was interesting that despite attempts to get her to stay home, she is able to recruit and accompany the Marshall on the search for the murderer. They are accompanied by the Texas Ranger, (Matt Damon) who has his own agenda to find the killer. Along the way there is action, gunshots, rivalry between the 2 law officers and of course Mattie's attempts to get them to keep on the trail of the killer.\n\nAs the movie progresses, Mattie is able to see the True Grit of U.S. Marshal Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn. To find out what happens, do see this enjoyable & entertaining movie.\n\nUnknown\n\nLiam Neeson is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to his movie. The stars include Diane Kruger, and January Jones amongst other stars. The movie has lots of action, car chases, murders, accidents, which all adds to the tension and suspense of this movie.\n\nLiam Neeson's character is a complex one and once again this movie also has a twist in the tail. The bad guys want to destroy, the so called Dr. Martin Harris, but why? Why does his wife not recognize him? For the answers you will have to watch the movie.\n\nIt is well enacted and the events seem plausible. I would recommend this movie if you are in the mood for action and just some plain entertainment.\n\nThe Tourist\n\nThe movie stars Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp as the lead characters. The movie is very well enacted and there is twist in the tail at the end. Ms. Jolie is attractive and does many of the stunts by herself. Johnny Depp makes a good partner, suave, handsome and independent.\n\nThere is a lot of action, a sense of mystery, humor, & romance, not glaring but in a subtle way. If you are looking for something light and entertaining I would highly recommend this movie.\n\nWal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price\n\nThis 2005 documentary was directed by Robert Greenwald. The movie focusses on several Walmart practices that impact the community negatively. These include:\n\nLong standing small businesses that are forced to close because of the competitive prices of Walmart. Low wages are paid to staff. There is no overtime pay & they do not hire adequate staff. Walmart also tends to hire part time employees so that they do not have to pay benefits. Employees work the long hours with no overtime pay, as they know that they can be replaced if they refuse.\n\nThe conditions in factories in China that manufacture products for Walmart, are largely deplorable. Desperately poor employees work long hours, in cramped hot factories for minimal wages. Many US Walmart employees cannot afford the premiums for health care and often opt out of a health care plan as they have to choose between buying food or paying for health care.\n\nIt is very disturbing that employees are encouraged to seek state aid like WIC. Instead of paying them a living wage, they are told to reap the benefits of their tax dollars.\n\nWalmart employees are not allowed to join a union. Many large Walmart parking lots do not have surveillance cameras. Employees and customers have been the victims of muggings, kidnapping and even a death because of this failure to provide protection.\n\nWalmart refutes these allegations, claiming good treatment of their employees and contributing to the communities & charities. Compared to their billion dollar income, their donations are minuscule. Everyone who shops at Walmart should view this documentary. You decide if the high cost of low prices is really worth it.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Iyer\n\nI am becoming a big fan of Konkona Sen Sharma. I have seen her in several movies recently and I am always impressed with her performances. She seems totally immersed in the character she portrays and so comes across as very natural and believable.\n\nKonkona Sen Sharma takes the role of Mrs. Iyer and her traveling companion, Mr. Iyer is played by Rahul Bose. The movie is directed by Aparna Sen, Konkona's father. The movie has English dialogue with scatterings of Tamil. The story focuses on a bus journey during a time of inter-racial riots. With this background the movie explores the theme of prejudice, and cultural bias.\n\nMrs. Iyer has grown up with certain beliefs and views of her status as a Brahmin, (an elite class). Circumstances during that trip lead Mrs. Iyer to reflect on her values which are challenged by her companion.\n\nRahul Bose's character, a gentle, helpful gentleman, a Muslim wildlife photographer, is aghast & at times frustrated that education does little sometimes to shake off peoples prejudices. His portrayal of a man, widely traveled with broad minded views is very charming. It was heartwarming to see the closeness that develops between this couple during the tension, killings, terror and their own differences during this journey.\n\nThis movie is highly recommended\n\nThe Invention of Lying\n\nWritten and directed by Ricky Gervais and Matthew Robinson, this movies was really funny. It is adult humor so it may not be suitable to watch with young kids. The stars include Rick Gervais, (Mark Bellison) Jennifer Garner,(Anna McDoogles), and Rob Lowe. It is set in an alternate reality where the concept of lying does not exist. Everyone speaks there mind, be it blunt or hurtful.\n\nA situation arises when Ricky's character lies. The lies is believed and Mark soon sees the benefit of lying. The lies multiply, giving Mark a new confidence as he impresses folk with his knowledge. Anna is blunt about what she is seeking in a suitor and that Mark does not possess what it takes to produce children with good genes.\n\nThe acting is very good and the subtle and not so subtle humor is really funny. I am glad that my good friend Ania recommended this movie to me. Very well worth seeing if you are in the mood for good humor.\n\nThe movie stars Tina Fey and Steve Carell as Claire and Phil Foster, a middle class couple with the usual routine of rushed mornings, busy work days and taking care of the kids. They do take time to have weekly date nights. One such night becomes a nightmare, as they are mistaken for another couple. A series of comedic situations develop in an effort to thwart the bag guys. It was funny but not great humor, predictable. I would not recommend going to pay full price at the theater, wait for it to be on DVD.\n\nTsotsi\n\nI had seen this movie several years ago and just realized (May 2009), that I had not written a review, although I have recommended it to countless people. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign movie of 2005. The film is an adaptation of the novel, Tsotsi, by Athol Fugard. It is directed by Gavin Hood, and is set in a South African slum, near Johannesburg in Soweto, South Africa. The word, Tsosti, means thug.\n\nThe stark contrast between the deplorable living conditions in the slums and the suburbs is interesting. South Africa is a mix of first world and third world conditions. The story centers around Tsotsi (Presley Chweneyagae), a leader of a gang including his friends Butcher (Zenzo Ngqobe), Aap (Kenneth Nkosi) and Boston (Mothusi Magano). Tsotsi has lived in poverty and squalor and finds shelter at night, in the large construction pipes in the fields. He makes his living by robbing people.\n\nOn one such event he drives off with the victims car only to discover that there is 3 month baby in the back seat. A baby is a new experience, but rather than abandon this child, he makes efforts to care for this child. He gets help from a friend who nurses this baby.\n\nThere is a good depiction of the hopelessness of these surroundings. Distrust among the gang members lead to further violence. Tsotsi is helped to come to the realization that he should return the baby. Yet he realizes the danger of such a move.\n\nLiving most times with no shelter of any sort, unemployment, violence and stealing seems to be the means to survival. It is a good movie to see life from the other side and wonder about the impact of such living on the value of life.\n\nTraffic Signal\n\nTraffic Signal is an Indian movie, in Hindi with English sub-titles. The actors include, Kunal Khemu, Konkona Sen Sharma, Neetu Chandraamong others. The director is Madhur Bhandarkar who won the National Film Awards in 2007 as Best Director for this movie. Anil Moti Ram Palande, won the first National Film Award for Best Make-up Artist\n\nIt seems almost like a documentary as it focuses on the lives of street children and adults who beg for a living at a particular traffic signal in Mumbai, India. It was interesting to see the order in those that work at this traffic signal. They all have to pay a protection fee to the Manager, Silsila, (Kunal Khemu), who in turn reports to his manager. At the top of the ranks is a mafia don, with political ties.\n\nSilsila regards those that ply their trade at this signal as his family. He himself grew up on the streets and this is how he learned to earn a livelihood. There is a great camaraderie amongst them, but there are rival traders too who are challenged if they attempt to encroach on Silsila's domain.\n\nThe acting is excellent and the plight of the beggar children, the prostitutes,& drug addicts are portrayed in a way that moves one for those actually living in such conditions. The future of the traffic signal, and therefore the livelihood of many, however, is in jeopardy due to the actions of the don and Silsila's unknown involvement in a sinister plot.\n\nThis movie is highly recommended. I recently learned that Traffic Signal is one of a Trilogy of movies by this director. I look forward to viewing, Page3 and Corporate as well, the rest of the trilogy.\n\nFood Inc.\n\nThis documentary was informative, disturbing, yet thought provoking. Many consumers do not question where their food originated and under what conditions. We basically accept that the packaged meat products, fruits and vegetables, attractively displayed in the stores are fresh and safe to consume.\n\nFood Inc. addresses these issues. There are very disturbing scenes of the inhumane treatment of animals that are raised for the sole purpose of being slaughtered for their meat. People like the chicken breasts, so chickens are fed with hormones that make them grow large chests, in a short time span. The bones, still underdeveloped, cannot support the weight of the chickens. These adverse conditions often lead to the collapse and death of many chickens.\n\nMost of these animals, with bodies caked in feces, do not have room to move. With muscles wasting, they stand in soil laden feces. At the time of slaughtering, the feces are still on their bodies, and it is a fact that feces do get mixed into the meat that is processed for consumption.\n\nFarming methods and conditions giving rise to the contamination of products like spinach are also addressed. Families who have lost relatives or those who are severely disabled as a result of food poisoning discuss their experiences. Some of these families have tried to enact changes in the production of food to ensure better quality. It has been an uphill battle for them.\n\nSince multinational companies are bent on fast pace production they set farming standards that suit them. Those not wishing to comply with rigid and most times inhumane treatment of animals, & their rules about planting seeds, face a bleak future. With nowhere else to market their produce, they often unwillingly comply with the monopolies that these companies hold.\n\nIn sharp contrast to these regimented ways to raise animals, one farmer who ventured on his own, breeds animals the old way, with the animals roaming free, eating the food intended for cows, grass, as opposed to corn, promoted by the multinationals.\n\nThe slaughtering and butchering of animals is heavy work, with employees using sharp cutting instruments. Many accidents occur as workers attempt to complete these risky tasks within tight schedules. Immigration authorities regularly crackdown on these workers, the majority of whom are illegal aliens, even though these meat packing industries actually recruit workers from Mexico.\n\nIt is well known that the immigration officials will arrest at least 15 people during their raids. This takes an emotional toll on the workers. It is the wheeling and dealing of these large companies, the poor wages paid to the staff, as well as the shabby treatment of its employees that are so unwholesome. In addition, those in authority often ignore regulations for safety and standards. The organizations that are meant to regulate how food is processed often hold management positions in the multinational food packing companies.\n\nHere is a clip of A CBS Interview with Film Makers, Robert Kenner and Michael Pollan\n\nThis movie is very highly recommended. If you watch it on DVD, please also watch the extra scenes that were not included in the movie.\n\nAmerican Violet\n\nI saw this outstanding movie it was gripping from the beginning. It is based on the true life experiences of Dee Roberts (Nicole Beharie), a 24 year-old African-American single mother of four, living in the projects in a small Texas town.\n\nThe incident took place in 2000, around the Bush/Gore Presidential elections. The movie addresses the racial bias in the justice system of this town. The powerful, racist district attorney, played by Michael O'Keefe organized a task force with the express purpose of regularly raiding, military style, the homes of African Americans and arresting people.\n\nThe vast majority are innocent but witnesses are forced to testify against those arrested. The innocent victims, poor, with no resources & terrified, are cajoled to take the plea bargain and be set \"free\". This freedom prevents them from receiving any state benefits, leaves them with criminal records, making employment impossible and life in general, quite miserable.\n\nIt was very tempting to be free, but pleading guilty to a crime that she did not commit was unacceptable to Dee, despite other stress which included,\n\nmissing her children & leaving the responsibility for their care to her mother(Alfre Woodard).\n\nThe father of the 2 youngest children, who had no custody, begins taking the children to his home.\n\nShe faces imprisonment of 15 years based on false testimony, if she does not take the plea bargain.\n\nDee is arrested at the diner where she works and roughly pushed into the police vehicle. She is totally surprised and thinks that this is due to unpaid driving tickets, until she finds out that she is arrested for dealing in drugs. After 21 days in jail she is released on bail.\n\nWhat I found so very disturbing was that the amount of funding for this city is increased if there is a high number of arrests and plea bargains. During this time lawyers from ACLU meet local church members and explain their intention of wanting to end this unjust system of arrests and plea bargains. They ask Dee if she would sue the District attorney as this is the only way that they could try and end this scenario. She agrees.\n\nThis decision is a very brave one, but not easy for Dee. The gathering of facts, the meetings with all parties and Dee's struggle to survive are very well portrayed. The actors performances were excellent. One feels empathy for the victims of such terrible treatment and outrage that this kind of behavior still exists.\n\nA very highly recommended movie\n\nCrazy Heart\n\nThe movie received rave reviews and Jeff Bridges won an Oscar for Best Actor. His acting as an alcoholic, talented singer, now performing at small venues was really very good. His co-star, Maggie Gylenhaal as his love interest was also excellent in her role. The music was good.\n\nBut I found the movie dragging and the theme was so very much like The Wrestler, that I found the movie somewhat boring. If you really, really like country music you will like this movie, more for the songs, than the movie itself\n\nWhip It\n\nWatching the sport of roller derby was a new experience for me. I was totally surprised with the ruthlessness involved and find it hard to understand why one has to have this pushing and shoving in a sport.\n\nThat being said, I really liked the movie as it was portrayed very well. The director is Drew Barrymore who also stars in the movie. Other notable actors are Ellen Page and Marcia Gay Harden who play mother and daughter, Bliss and Brooke Cavendar. The movie theme is the sport of roller derby, intertwined with the conflictual relationship of Bliss and her mother.\n\nEllen Page as the teenager who reluctantly goes along with her mother's passion for pageants comes across very realistically. On the other hand, Marcia Gay Harden's performance as a hardworking, ambitious mother who sees winning pageants as an opportunity for her daughter to make something of her life is also excellent. She believes that she is doing the best she can for her daughter. When Bliss finds her true passion, roller derby, there is a conflict of interest.\n\nAn interesting movie, with excellent performances overall, highly recommended\n\nJulie & Julia\n\nThe stars are Meryl Streep as Julia Child and Amy Adams as Julie Powell. The movies centers around Julia Child's passion for French cooking and how this led to her becoming the icon that she still is. It is intertwined with Julie Powell trying out Julia Child's recipes and then blogging about her trials and tribulations.\n\nI thought both actors were very good in their roles. It was interesting to see the relationships of these 2 women with their husbands as well. I enjoyed the movie and highly recommend it.\n\nAvatar\n\nIn Hinduism, Avatar is the term used for an incarnation of God. It is said that God comes to earth for the protection of society at different times & in different forms. I presume it was based on this idea that the director, James Cameron called his movie Avatar. In the year 2154 in another galaxy, humans can be genetically engineered (create an Avatar) to take the form of the local Na'vi who live in Pandora, rich in a mineral that the humans want to access.\n\nIn the movie a group of scientists explore the land of Pandora and the best way they believe they can get access to information is the creation of Avatars who can mingle and learn from the natives. On the one hand the chief scientist, Sigourney Weaver, respects these people and wants to learn how they operate in that world. But the mining team is impatient and wants to get the resources of this rich land & do whatever it takes to subjugate and destroy the people whom they see as primitive.\n\nJake Sully is recruited as a bodyguard on a mission to explore Pandora. The team are attacked by animals and he is unable to get back to back with his colleagues. He spends the night on Pandora which is regarded as most dangerous. He is confronted with dangerous animals, but is rescued by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a female Na'vi.\n\nI really enjoyed this meeting, the annoyance & animosity of Neytiri, the slow friendship and then later love between them. Of course conflicts arise and that is for you to find out when you watch the movie.\n\n.\n\nThe theme is not unlike what has been recorded in history when big powers take over countries that belonged to others. This is true of the experience of Native Americans in the United States and the natives of South Africa amongst many other countries.\n\nI was very impressed that one man's imagination could give life to this interesting story with wonderful visual effects. We saw this in 3D and enjoyed it a lot. The other stars include: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez and Stephen Lang. A highly recommended movie\n\nLa Vie en Rose\n\nThis movie won several accolades, including the 2007, best actress Academy Award for Marion Cottilard for her performance as the legendary singer Edith Piaf. The movie is in French with English sub titles. The acting was excellent as Marion depicted the mostly troubled but extremely talented Edith Piaf.\n\n> It also depicts the poverty and hard life of many during that period in the early 1900's. Edith's life was a roller coaster with very little stability or affection from her parents\n\nHer talent superseded her humble beginnings and she was soon sought after. But her success was plagued with tragedy and sorrow and addictions. The movie depicts Edith Piaf's talent really well and it is very well worth watching such a good performance.\n\nPrecious\n\nThis movie depicts sexual, verbal and physical abuse very, very well. It illustrates the power that the abusers wield on victims. The belittlement, sorrow and pain is that the victim experiences is extremely well depicted by newcomer, Gabourey Sidibe in the title role of Precious.\n\nIn the movie, one of the ways that Precious endures this horror is her imagination of being a successful performer. The movie tells a story of the sexual abuse of a young child, beginning at age 3 who has 2 children by the age of 17 by her rapist father. However there are folks who support Precious and encourage her to learn to read and write. Circumstances lead her to independence. The story is inspiring and uplifting in spite of the horror of abuse inflicted on a child.\n\nEqually impressive is the performance of Mo’Nique, previously a comedy actress, as the mean, hateful, jealous, angry and abusive mother. Other actors include Paula Patton, Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz, Sherri Shepherd\n\nThe movie is based on the novel Push by Sapphire. It is directed by Lee Daniels. The movie is very well worth seeing. The performances of Gabourey and Sapphire are excellent.\n\nUp In the Air\n\nThe movie stars George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, &Jason Bateman among other actors. The story is very relevant to the present day climate as it deals with the firing of workers. George Clooney's character, Ryan Bingham, is employed by companies who prefer an outsider to do the firing.\n\nAs a single man, he travels to many cities and seems to love the free life and is able to deliver the message of firing and not get emotionally involved in the employees reactions to the downsizing. These scenes were very realistic.\n\nThe movie also focuses on conflicts with his boss who is very impressed with his latest employee who has innovative ways to enact firings. Relationships with women have never been serious and his family ties have also been strained.\n\nThe movie ties in both plots of firing workers and the complications of personal relationships, loneliness and despair very well. The actors were very good and convincing in their roles.\n\nWe left the movie with a sense of despair. If you are feeling low, don't see this movie. However, it is a good movie, well enacted and it is a treat to see George Clooney. So go when you feel on top of the world.\n\nThe Wrestler\n\nI watched this movie on DVD recently and thought that the lead actor, Mickey Roark, as the wrestler, Ram Robinson was superb in that role. The movie does a good job of depicting the life of this wrestler, no longer in his prime. His job is mundane, he lives in a shoddy area, divorced, with a daughter he has not seen in years. He wrestles in the weekend with various professional groups. He struggles with relationships, drugs, and his lifestyle leads him to a heart attack. Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) as a stripper in the bar that Ram Robinson frequents, is impressive in that role as well.\n\nIt shows the struggles to make changes and the disappointments along the way until his final moment of glory. I found the movie disturbing but only because such situations do exist and the movie reminds us of this. I think Mickey Roark really deserved the Golden Globe Award for Best Suporting Actor. It is a movie that should be seen.\n\nInvictus\n\nThe movie Invictus, directed by Clint Eastwood, starring Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela, and Matt Damon as Francois Pienaar is OUTSTANDING. I encourage everyone to see it.\n\nThe story is inspiring and the acting is excellent. Based in 1995, soon after Nelson Mandela was elected President of South Africa, it tells a story of compassion, forgiveness and the insight of a man who used sports as a medium to help unite the country. He had the insight to know that despite great pressure to put an end to the Springboks, the South African Rugby team, viewed as a painful part of the apartheid regime by many blacks, such action would be one of revenge. Removing a piece of South African history, of great cultural value for many in the country would only antagonize and alienate the country.\n\nThe movie subtly incorporates the division of class, racism, bitterness and anger. Mandela's belief in overcoming the odds, working to heal rather than divide inspired the rugby captain who soon realized that winning the World Cup was much more than just winning a game. Francois Piennar was moved that this man, imprisoned for 27 years, could forgive his captors and be uplifted by the words of a poem, Invictus. See the movie to appreciate how the rugby team were inspired to perform the way they did.\n\nHere is a clip with the real Francois Pienaar\n\nThis Is It\n\nI really enjoyed this movie based on the rehearsals for Micheal Jackson's tour to London. I was very impressed with the talent and attention to detail that Micheal Jackson expected in his performance. The rehearsals illustrated clearly the hard work that performers do to give off a real professional show.\n\nThere were some knew songs & some old favorites. What also impressed me was Micheal's kind, soft nature. He was always polite & respectful when talking to the crew. There was a wonderful spirit of camaraderie & Michael encouraged them saying they were all family.\n\nHis comments and conversations with the director and other artists was again always most respectful. His performance was outstanding, even though this was just rehearsals. His songs, with themes of sadness, joy & awareness stimulated the audience to feel those emotions as well.\n\nMicheal was also very much aware of the importance of taking care of the environment & created songs to make people aware of this. I would encourage others to see this movie. I could not help feeling regret that he died so young with so much of talent sadly wasted.\n\nAn Education\n\nThe lead actress is Jenny (Carey Mulligan) an attractive bright girl who achieves good grades. She and her family expect her to go to Oxford. She meets a much older man David (Peter Sarsgaard) who changes her life.\n\nThe movie critics gave this a 4 star rating. Therefore I looked forward to a real interesting movie. The actors include Alfred Molina as Jenny's father & Emma Thompson as her school principal. I was very disappointed with the movie.\n\nThe scenes were beautiful but the story dragged and Ms. Thompson had a very small role. The story line was depressing and I left the theater in a solemn state of mind. I would not recommend paying full price at the theater for this movie.\n\nThe Proposal\n\nI watched this movie at home & was pleasantly surprised that I really liked it. The storyline, immigration related marriage for convenience, was interesting, with humor & good scenery. The cast had many well know actors including Betty White, with Sandra Bullock as the star.\n\nI like the fact that the movie has themes of the importance of family & honesty. If you are in the mood for a pleasant movie, just to relax, I would recommend The Proposal.\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada\n\nI just recently saw this movie. It stars Meryl Streep as a high powered, ambitious, cold, demanding & critical boss in the fashion world. Her assistant, Anne Hathaway is awed by all the power her boss wields. Everyone fears her & are at her beck & call. The standard of acting is high and both actors portrayed their roles convincingly\n\nIt addresses values & what are the issues that really matter in life. What is the meaning of success and what does one have to do to achieve that success. Can one be at ease to do what it takes? Interesting movie and worth watching\n\nCapitalism: A Love Story\n\nI am a great fan of Michael Moore as you can see from my previous review of his movie, Sicko.Once again he brings to our attention the social ills affecting Americans. He addresses the economy, the loaning of money to corporate giants, the loss of jobs, the health care debate and the effects of all of this on the people.\n\nIn addressing these subjects, Mr. Moore demonstrates the degree to which officials in high places use their influence to manipulate the system to fatten their coffers. It upset me to see how greed by some individuals affected the lives & future of teenagers. He reminds us of the reality of the present situation and the way the system, Capitalism now works, benefits a small segment of society. Yet we are manipulated by this blantant inequality & rise to power as most of us strive to acheive this same status for ourselves.\n\nIt was also interesting to see the influence of corporate giants in congress and just how decicions are again influenced to benefit a certain segment. It is a thought provoking movie that should be seen by everyone in order to decide what can be done to change the present system to be fair to all citizens.\n\nThe Informant\n\nThe star of the movie is Matt Damon who depicts the real life story of Mark Whitacre, employed at Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) in the early 1990's. Influenced by his wife, he was the whistle blower of the company’s price-fixing tactics. However Mark Whitacre had his own agenda for blowing the whistle and the tactics he used to inform the FBI is questionable. This leads to a different end than he had envisaged.\n\nWhile I was watching the movie I did not realize that it was really based on a true story and as such I found the movie to be dragging. My husband was sure it was true and of course it was. This made me change my perspective as I realized that the long drawn out scenes were based on the real character's idiosyncrasies and bi-polar behavior. The acting is excellent. I recommend this movie.\n\nThe Hurt Locker\n\nAn excellent movie that tells the horrors of the Iraq War through the the Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal(EOD) unit who are assigned to diffuse a series of bombs, many improvised. Working in this team highlights relationships, the need for cooperation, & the rigors and stress of this demanding and always life threatening job. The camaraderie, the frustrations, resilience, tensions, differences, the feelings invoked by the death and maiming of team members, the anger and fear of the team are excellently portrayed. The daily fears and tension of not knowing who are Iraqi insurgents and innocent civilians are again well depicted. The effects on the soldiers physical and emotional well being and the impact of all of this on personal relationships is also vividly portrayed.\n\nThe movie is based on a book written by Mark Boal,a freelance writer who accompanied a real life (EOD) unit on their missions. It is directed by Kathryn Bigelow. The movie was filmed largely in Jordan and and a part in Canada. Some of the stars are Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and Evangeline Lilly. Jeremy Renner who plays the leader of the bomb disposal squad, Staff Sergeant William James depicts a character almost obsessed to do the job in the face of extreme danger, taking risks, even endangering his unit, and finding some satisfaction in this line of work. The actor trained with a real life EOD unit. The acting is superb and the movie which has already won awards at the Venice Film Festival for Best Movie is really worth seeing even thought it is disturbing\n\nPink Panther 2\n\nThis movie was so funny. If you just want something light and a few laughs then this is the movie for you. Some big name stars like Alfred Molina, Jeremy Irons, Andy Garcia and Lily Tomlin were also a part of this movie. They mainly played bumbling characters with big ego's. Of course the main character, Inspector Jacques Clouseau is very endearing in his bumbling, determined and bungling style of investigating crimes. In this movie he is chosen to head the Dream Team find a thief who is stealing famous artifacts, including the diamond, The Pink Panther. I enjoyed watching Aishwairya Rai Bachan who stars as Sonia. Highly recommended if you just want some light entertainment.\n\nThe Taking of Pelham 123\n\nThe movie is a remake of the 1974 version. The 2009 movie stars Denzil Washington and John Travolta as the lead actors. Both are good in their roles as the good guy and the bad guy respectively. Lots of action and violence but it does grip your attention. The movie centers around a hostage situation on board a train. If you like a lot of action you will enjoy this movie.\n\nGhajini\n\nWe watched this movie on DVD. It is a Tamil movie with English subtitles. The characters are endearing and play their roles convincingly. In this case the course of true love did not go smoothly. It is a case of why do bad things happen to good people. The lead actors are Sanjay Ramaswami (Surya Sivakumar) and Kalpana (Asin Thottumkal).\n\nThe violent developments lead to tragedy and Sanjay's life changes drastically from a successful business man to one seeking revenge in a different identity. It was well worth watching as the performances were good. I look forward to watching the Hindi version of the same movie.\n\nI love You Man\n\nThis movie was funny and entertaining with a focus on subjects like honesty, friendship and relationships. It is a feel good movie but not family friendly because of language. The lead actors are Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd), who is engaged to Zooey Rice (Rashida Jones). Sydney Fife (Jason Segel) is Paul's friend. Recommended.\n\nBombay to Bangkok\n\nThis is a Bollywood film starring Shreyas Talpade( Shankar)and Lena Christensen(Jasmine)in the lead roles. We were just scrolling thro' the lists of movies on our cable channel and my husband suggested we watch this. I reluctantly agreed but was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. The actors are very believable and enact their roles very well. While it is a comedy, it addresses the complexities of communicating across language groups, values and cultural issues.\n\nIt also reflects on values such as honesty, respect and eventually love. I enjoyed some of the couples squabbles, which delightfully demonstrated different cultural values. Highly recommended if you are just looking for something light and funny.\n\nTransamerica\n\nI recently watched this movie on DVD. I was so impressed with the performance of Felicity Huffman who won the Golden Globe best actress (drama) award for her powerful performance of as a transexual woman. She was able to convey what a difficult situation that has to be not only for the individual but all those involved in the life of a transexual.\n\nKevin Zegers plays her 17 year son whom she is alleged to have fathered when she was \"a man.\" The movie centers around the theme of identity struggle and the pain, confusion, isolation, shame, guilt and humor as well. I liked the performances of all the actors but Felicity and Kevin were outstanding. Really worth watching.\n\nDe-Lovely\n\nThe stars of the movie which I watched on DVD recently are Kevin Kline and Ashely Judd. I like both these actors but I found this movie dragging on and just not very enjoyable. I watched on just because I wanted to learn about Cole Porter. I think the portrayal of the artist could have been done in a way that kept the viewer more interested.\n\nThe movie did portray the love between this couple in spite of Cole Porters dalliance with other men. His brilliance as an artist and his quirks did come through. The music was good but to me the movie lacked real sparkle.\n\nWhy Did I Get Married\n\nAn entertaining movie that addresses the complexities of relationships. The stars include Tyler Perry and Janet Jackson. What really happens in the lives of 8 couples are exposed when one of the couples is disrespectful to his wife and attends the annual reunion with a female companion.\n\nTrue feelings come to the fore and the couples face issues of fidelity, honesty and loyalty. Well enacted and worth seeing\n\nThe Reader\n\nKate Winslet won an Oscar for best actress for her performance in this movie. She plays Hanna Schmitz, a German woman in her thirties whose teenage lover is unaware of the dark secret in her past. Her co-stars are Ralph Fiennes and David Kross who both play Micheal Berg at different life stages. Both men gave excellent, realistic performances that had audiences feeling empathy and sadness.\n\nThe movie has sexual scenes that depict the relationship between Hanna and and the young Micheal and his growing deep love for her. Her sudden departure leaves him devastated and only years later he learns the reason for this and why he always read to her. Apart from hiding her past from Michael, she is ashamed to reveal another truth that may even help in her trial for Nazin war crimes.\n\nHis experience with Hanna impacted the young Micheal into adulthood and all of his relationships. It is sad and thought provoking but very well worth seeing. Highly recommended.\n\nLast Chance Harvey\n\nThe stars include Emma Thompson as Kate Walker and Dustin Hoffman as Harvey Shine. The acting was excellent. It is a love story with a very nice ending. But within that story of love and humor, the pain and devastating effects of broken marriages, prejudice, class, values, relationships and loss are very well encapasulated. I enjoyed the movie a lot and would highly recommend it as one can relate to the issues that the movie focusses on.\n\nThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button\n\nThe lead actors are Brad Pitt as Benjamin Button and Cate Blanchette as Daisy. The movie which has been nominated for The Oscar in several categories is based on the 1921 short story of the same name written by F. Scott Fitzgeral. The acting is excellent and the special effects are amazing. It is a love story but with a very different plot as the couple are at the midpoint of their lives about the same age with great love and for each other.\n\nThe relationship is a tangled one because of the circumstances surrounding Benjamin. As a newborn baby he is wrinkled and ugly and has ailments akin to an 86 year old man. Daisy is a normal child and their paths cross when she is about 7 years and he (in appearance) is his late 70's., when she visits her aunt in a nursing home where Benjamin also lives. As she grows older, Benjamin grows younger.\n\nNot wanting to give away the whole story I just want to say that the movie depicts the fragility of life and relationships, the beauty of love and joy and the sadness of death and separation. It is very well depicted and I would highly recommend this movie.\n\nThe Incredible Hulk\n\nThe movie stars one of my favorite actors, Ed Norton. I do not think it is one of his best movies, but nevertheless I enjoyed the movie as his performance as the tortured Dr. Bruce Banner was very good. It is based on the comic book character Hulk. Norton plays Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk, a scientist who is unwittingly used by the evil Dr. Ross to test the possiblity of creating super soldiers.\n\nNorton does a good job of expressing his pain and sorrow at being responsible for the actions of his other character Hulk and works hard at finding an antidote for his condition. Liv Tyler is his love interest. Both their lives are fraught with dangers and challenges as he fights to rid himself as the Hulk charatcter. It is worth watching.\n\nBaghban\n\nBaghban means caretaker. The stars are Amitabh Bachan and Hema Malini a couple in real life and in their role in this movie. They play an older married couple still very much in love but wanting to spend time with the 4 sons that they have raised with love and affection. They also have an adopted son who is very devoted to them.\n\nThey presume that their sons too want to care for their parents and it is upto them to inform their children that they are ready to live with them. They believe that the children will probably be fighting over each other to decide which child will host the parents first. The children are stunned by this news and are most reluctant to take them. They eventually make an arrangement that is very painful to the parents but they agree to accept this.\n\nThe movies focusses on family values, love, respect, fairness, kindness and embracing family. It is also a reminder to folks not to be dependent on anyone. It is also a reminder for children to acknowledge and be aware of the care that parents give their children. A well enacted movie and thought provoking. Recommended\n\nBunty aur Babli\n\nA very entertaining, funny and yet charming movie that is not meant to be serious. Abhishek Bachan and Rani Mukerjee are a couple from small towns, seeking something more than what what they can get if they live in their villages.\n\nAs strangers, they chance to meet each other. Circumstances lead them to a life as scam artists. Their performanc is enjoyable, in spite of knowing they are breaking the law. The redeeming features are that they do help the poor and Babli (Rani Mukerjee), still misses her family.\n\nIf you want a movie for pure entertainment, then I would recommend this. Of course the dance scene with Aishwaria Rai (as a guest artist), and both the Bachans is very delightful.\n\nSlumdog Millionaire\n\nI loved this movie. It held me spellbound from the first moment. The story is very different from any other I have seen. Within a TV show, the story of the lead character, Dev Patel as Jamal Malik unfolds. It is a story of survival admist the most challenging, filthy, devastating living conditions, bringing in its wake, thugs, danger, brutality, cruelty and yet hope and goodness.\n\nThe actors all do their part very convincingly, expressing emotions as it most likely will be experienced. A few of the stars are Frieda Pinto as Latika and Anil Kapoor as Prem Kumar. The young actors who played, the younger Latika, the younger Jamal and his brother Salim were outstanding. You can also view details at the link, Slumdog Millionaire\n\nGiant\n\nI enjoyed watching the beautiful Elizabeth Tayor in her youth. Ironically she played the role of an older woman for most of the movie. I can see why this movie received so many accolades. It addresses the theme of racial prejudice, womens role in society, expectations we hold for our children and the authority a husband had over his wife.\n\nIt is interesting to note that not all the prejudice of that era is over. But there are vast changes in the acceptance of womens' role in society. James Dean was excellent in his role as well. It is sad that his life ended so early. A movie worth seeing.\n\nQuantum of Solace\n\nLots of action, beautiful women and an interesting story line. James Bond (Daniel Craig) is seeking the fiend, Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a member of the Quantum organisation posing as an environmentalist. He has his own selfish agenda prompted by greed. As my husband mentioned, the movie is keeping up with current trends and this time the bad guy is after the control of water. You will appreciate the relevance of water in the world today by checking out, FLOW\n\nTo see how he intends to do this, watch the movie. Bond also befriends Camille Montes (Olga Kurylenko), who has her own agenda. If you like lots of car chases, a bit of fantasy and action you will like the movie which I enjoyed as well.\n\nJourney to the Center of the Earth\n\nI like Brendan Fraser and I had heard good things about this movie, so we decided to watch it on TV. It is not my favorite movie. Perhaps after seeing so many excellent thought provoking movies, the standard of this one was just very far from the others. There were some funny moments but overall I would not recommend it. It you are seeing it with kids then you will be more likely to enjoy it.\n\nChangeling\n\nThis movie touched me very deeply. The story was disturbing and sad but also uplifting. The movie is directed by Clint Eastwood and tells the true story of one woman's experience with loss and pain and her treatment by corrupt officials in the city.\n\nAngelina Jolie as Christine Collins gives an outstanding performance that is very realistic. She did not look like she was acting. She seemed to be really experiencing the events. Other stars included John Malcovich as the preacher. Even the bad guys were excellent as their performances too were very realistic.\n\nA highly recommended movie\n\nIraq for Sale\n\nThe movie, made by Robert Greenwald and Brave New Films is a compelling, disturbing movie/documentary that exposes the extravagant waste of the Bush Administration's war management amongst other failed policies. Private companies have been hired to provide transportation, protection and many adminstrative tasks. These companies are being paid millions of dollars to provide these services and there is strong evidence that they are there just for the money.\n\nThere is wasteful spending, no regard for the safety of their employees and disregard for the Iraqi civilians. In addition it appears that their sub standard work endangers the lives of American soldiers and private citizens. These companies are composed of ex-military and ex-government workers who unethically help their companies get and keep enormous contracts which are ultimately paid for by the American taxpayers.\n\nThere are heart rending stories from families whose relatives joined these private companies in the belief that they were joining solid, wholesome companies that would take care of them. They believed that they would have the opportunity to contribute to their country as well as provide better for their families by the promise of excellent remimbursement.\n\nWhat these families learned when their beloved family members died was that companies like Blackwater, K.B.R.-Halliburton, CACI and Titan were negligent and are accountable for the deaths of these men. The men were not warned about the dangers, had insufficient protection and were basically exposed as targets.\n\nThere are interviews with victims of torture who describe their inhumane treatment at the hands of Americans. Many Iraqi civilians were just rounded up and arrested for no reason, who had no terrorist associatons. These private companies had a role in torture as well.\n\nThe movie producers made several attempts to contact the CEO's of these companies, to no avail. It is shocking that a first world country engages in acts based on greed, selfishness and with no consideration of the people involved. As some soldiers in the movie mentioned, there is no regard for love of country or patriotism by these companies. For further details please click on the link below and then watch the video that appears.\n\nThis is a must watch movie\n\nFast Food Nation\n\nI recently saw the movie, Fast Food Nation which is loosely based on the book by, Eric Schlosser. It was a 2001 non-fiction bestseller, Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal. Among the many stars are Greg Kinnear as Don Anderson, Wilmer Valderrama as Raul, Bruce Willis as Harry Rydell, Kris Kristofferson as Rudy Martin and Patricia Arquette as Cindy among other actors.\n\nGreg Kinnears character learns of possible contamination of the meat patties being sold at the fst food chain, Mickey's. He visits the plant to check on the conditions of the slaughter house. He is shown excellent clean conditions but past employees tell another story.\n\nHe learns about the fast production line that makes it impossible to cleanse the meat completely from the feces. He also learns of the dangers of the working conditions of its employees. His concern about selling a product that is tainted with the e.coli bacteria is met with disdain by a superior, Harry Rydell who believes that consumers just need to cook the patties on a high temperature. Everything is contaminated he suggests.\n\nIn addition to drawing attention to the gross manner in which meat is extracted from the carcass of animals, the movie also addresses the plight of the illegal immigrants who staff these meat plants and their inhumane treatment at the hands of their employers.\n\nA highly recommended movie\n\nBody of Lies\n\nThis movie has action, intrigue, cultural differences, violence, and scenes of torture that are credible and well enacted. Two excellent actors with lead roles are Leornado D'Caprio (one of my favorites) and Russell Crowe. This is a CIA operative with the lead characters working under cover. The movie is based on an attempt to get to the kingpin of the terrorists. A unique plot is devised which includes, deception, using an innocent man as a decoy to lure the real bad guy. When things go awry there is danger, death and more uncertainty.\n\nThe scenario is not too different in the real world of politics where deceit, spin, blurring of the truth, torture, greed and personal rewards are evident from 1st world to 3rd world countries. Those living in the regions where terrorism is open and rife must live very uncertain and chaotic lives. A movie worth watching especially to see the talent of the actors.\n\nStop-Loss\n\nA powerful movie that brings home the reality and horrors of war. One sees the camaraderie of the young soldiers, & the excitement and eagerness to do something for their country. The movie portrays the disillusionment and fear when friends and loved one's are killed and maimed in attacks and bombings. The lead character, staff Sergeant Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) who despite the difficulties he endures is true to his leaders and his duty as a soldier. When it is time to end his tour he is very happy to return home.\n\nThese soldiers who were buddies, have difficulties adjusting to life and the effects of post traumatic stress disorder are well portrayed. When staff Sergeant Brandon King is called back to serve in terms of Stop-Loss he refuses to go and decides to go AWOL.\n\nThe movie depicts the hopelessness and frustration of soldiers facing this policy. It also depicts the unfairness and disinterest of those in command to waiver in their enforcement of the Stop-Loss policy no matter the consequences. A thought provoking movie that should be seen\n\nW.\n\nThe movie, directed by Oliver Stone describes incidents in the life of George Walker Bush focusing on his early years as a college student, leading to his present role as President. The stars are Josh Brolin as President George W. Bush, Elizabeth Banks as his wife, Laura; Thandie Newton as Condoleeza Rice; Richard Dreyfuss as the power-wielding Dick Cheney and Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell among other actors.\n\nThe movie flits between the recent events and his life before coming to the White House. They include the Bush Administration's rationale for the Iraq war and their deliberations in this regard. Most of his life experiences before being president is weaved into family relationships especially between his father and himself.\n\nIt depicts a man displaying limited talent that concerns his father. How did he rise to any government office let alone President of the United States? One wonders what it takes to be president and how much family name & the pull of the purse strings help to get one to good schools and high positions.\n\nJosh Brolin gives an excellent performance as W. and there is a degree of empathy that you feel for W. Towards the end of the movie, in particular, Josh Brolin captures the demeanor and style of the President very well.\n\nA surpise for me was to see Thandie Newton as Condoleeza Rice. I admire this actress for her natural serenity and beauty. I think she bears no resemblance to Ms. Rice, yet she played her so beautifully. She dressed in the style of Ms. Rice including the hairstyle. Her voice was an excellent imitation and she even resembled Ms. Rice. Lots of credit is due to the make-up artists. They had all the details to perfection. This movie is enacted very well and leaves one with a lot of questions, shock and awe. Highly recommended.\n\nFlash of Genius\n\nThe movie is based on the true story of the inventor of the intermittent windscreen wiper. Greg Kinnear takes the title role, portraying inventor Robert (Bob) Kerns and Lauren Graham portrays his wife, Phyllis.\n\nA major car manufacturer has produced an intermittent wiper shortly after Robert Kearns has had preliminary negotiations with them in putting this product, his invention, on the market. At this discussion the company acknowledges his acheivement and that he has won the race to invent this product.\n\nUnexpectedly, he is told that the company is no longer interested in the product. Shortly after this Mr. Kerns sees cars on the road with intermittent wiper blades. He is enraged and realizes that he has been duped.\n\nThe movie deals with how this affects Dr. Kearns, his family, his job and how he deals with the situation. I was very moved by this story as it seems that Robert Kearns was a very upright human being with high moral standards and a strong sense of justice. He also wanted to be a role model for his children. A must see movie, highly recommended\n\nSherrybaby\n\nThe lead actress is Maggie Gyllenhaal as Sherry, a young woman just out of prison. She is struggling with emotional issues as well as drug addiction. She loves her daughter who went to live with brother and his wife while she was in prison. Sherry wants to reunite with her child.\n\nThe movie portrays her struggles to overcome her addiction, to find a job, to comply with her probation, to live in a seedy apartment complex and cope with the fear of losing her daughter. The acting was excellent. She portrayed the struggles of Sherry in an absolute realistic manner. Family dynamics such as loyalty, jealousy, fear, envy and love were also well blended into the story. A must see movie although not for the kids. The language and sexually explicit scenes may not be suitable for a young audience. Highly recommended\n\nParineeta\n\nParineeta means The Married Woman. It is a Hindi movie with English subtitles. I saw it on DVD as the movie was released in 2005. The stars are Sanjay Dutt as Girish, Saif Ali Khan as SHekar and Vidya Balan as Lolita. It is a love story with many twists and turns and very likeable characters.\n\nThe story deals with friendships, trust, deception, greed, anger, and financial woes. The music is very pleasant. On the whole this was a feel good movie with the actors performing their roles very well. I watched it right after watching The Ballad of Narayama, so that may color my view of this movie as well. I think I needed an antidote from the mostly serious and despondent situation of Narayama. So if you are looking for some escapism Parineetha is the movie for you.\n\nThe Ballad of Narayama\n\nThis is a Japanese movie with English subtitles. The actors include Ken Ogata, Sumiko Sakamoto Tkejo Aki and Seiji Kurasaki amongst other actors. The movie was made in 1983 and is the winner of several awards including those for Best Actor, Best Sound, Best Film and Excellence in Cinematography.\n\nIt is a remake of the 1958 film of the same name. Both films are based on the book Men of Tohoku by Shichiro Fukuzawa. It depicts the life of folks in a rural village who struggle to survive. There are disturbing scenes of brutal punishment, talk of killing or selling a newborn as a matter of fact. They have to consider rationing daily meals as the family grows bigger. When a family has been found to be hoarding food, the villagers have no mercy on them.\n\nThe custom in the village is that anyone at the age of 70 has to leave the village and go to the mountain top to starve to death. The eldest son has to carry the parent on his back and leave the parent at the mountain. This is a very moving scene and very well enacted.\n\nI thought the actors did an excellent job. It was very realistic and you could feel the burden and problems of the villagers. There are some light-hearted scenes but in the background of this struggle. It contains sexually explicit scenes, and language that will not be suitable for young audiences. If you are looking for a relaxing evening this movie is not for you. However if you are not feeling low and can take some serious and thought provoking drama you will appreciate this movie. Worth seeing for fine acting and wonderful photography.\n\nGhandi\n\nI saw this movie in 1982 when it was first released and later saw the DVD version. The movie won 8 academy awards that year, including Best Picture, Best Director for Richard Attenborough, and Ben Kingsley for Best male actor. It was a really good depiction of the life of Ghandi, beginning as a young lawyer and the life changing events of his trip to South Africa.\n\nHe was thrown off a train in South Africa, for refusing to move from the “ white compartment” to a compartment designated for people of color. Ghandi worked at improving the lot of Indian South Africans who were denied equal rights, treated with disrespect and great prejudice. His success in getting the staid South African government to make some changes were regarded as a victory.\n\nReturning to India after 20 years he was asked to help in leading India to Independence from the British Empire. He was able to free India without the use of violence. He encouraged Civil Disobedience or Satyagraha meaning truth and firmness. These non-violent protests included marches, boycotting public transportation and refusing to purchase clothing from England. This caused severe economic problems for the English cotton mills.\n\nHe put into practice methods to encourage local trade and independence. This included spinning cotton and using local labor to make clothing. This scene is well depicted in the movie when Ghandi explains to the mill workers why he was taking such action, and gaining their understanding and an ovation for his actions.\n\nGhandi was imprisoned several times, but his persistence, faith, firm resolve and determination ended the British rule. However there was dissension at home resulting in the separation of India and the formation of Pakistan. Check this link for a fuller description on the life of Ghandi.\n\nThis is a must see movie for everyone. Ghandi was an amazing man who is regarded as saint by many.\n\nElegy\n\nOne of the meanings of Elegy is, a poem of lament usually associated with death. The stars are Ben Kingsley as David Kepesh, a professor and Penélope Cruz as Consuela Castillo, his student. David is an older man, divorced and cynical about marriage. He is content with the relationships the he maintains and that he can control. Although he has many casual flings, he has one steady relationship for the last 20 years. He does not wish for commitment and has never felt the need for this.\n\nHis attraction to the beautiful Consuela is different and he is afraid of commitment as Consuela is about 30 years younger than him. She is not only beautiful but intelligent and seems to really love him. Not to give away the story line, I will refrain from further details. Events occur that affects both David and Consuela and they face an uncertain future.\n\nIt was delightful to see the beautiful Ms. Cruz. Both she and Ben Kingsley were very good in their roles. The movie is certainly not for children as it has unacceptable language, nudity and sexually explicit scenes. Maybe I am too cynical, but I found the story to be soppy and I did not feel moved in any way by the changing events.\n\nFLOW\n\nI will not do much reviewing of this movie. Instead I will give you the link where it is reviewed so very well that there is no need for anymore from me. I do want to add just a few things. The plight of many really impoverished South Africans living in rural areas are well depicted in this movie. It is really sad to see their struggle for simply clean water.\n\nIt is disturbing that so many lives are lost because of water contamination and privatization and corporate greed is once again hurting the poor people, not just in South Africa but in many countries. The issue of whether bottled water is any superior to tap water is described as very much a money making venture as there is minimal or no regulation about the quality of water that is bottled. In many cases it is tap water that is bottled.\n\nHere is the link for more information on the movie, FLOW.\n\nBee Season\n\nThe actors include Richard Gere as (Saul), Juliette Binoche as (Miriam), the mother and Flora Cross as (Eliza Naumann). They live in a nice neighborhood of Oakland, California. The movie depicts a wholesome looking family with father and son practicing music together and the mother preparing dinner and doing motherly chores, in a very nice home.\n\nDaughter, Eliza has a special talent in spelling and enters the Spelling Bee competition and excels. Her father, is excited about her success and encourages her and tutors her as well. He believes that studying certain texts will elevate her to a spiritual level. He is a scholar and professor.\n\nSomething is amiss, and this becomes more apparent when the father spends so much of time on one child, and neglects his son. But this is not all, something is going on with Miriam and one is left wondering what it is. There is hardly any joy expressed by this family and an air of mystery prevails.\n\nDespite the good ratings, I found that the movie needed editing amongst other things. The story dragged without coming to some point. The end of the movie regarding the State Spelling Bee competition had an interesting end. But there were too many loose ends which were left hanging. At the end of the movie I still needed some entertainment. I would not recommend this movie\n\nRighteous Kill\n\nThe stars are Robert De Niro as(Turk) and Al Pacino as (Rooster), Carla Gugino as (Karen kleisner), John Leguizamo, Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson, Brian Dennehy and other actors. Turk and Rooster are detectives and partners investigating a possible serial killer. The movie has violence and swear words and may not be suitable as a family movie.\n\nThe acting was excellent, one gets quite carried away and feels the concern, anger and disappointments that are expressed. As the movie proceeds it seems very clear who the killer is and why that person was driven to kill. It therefore came as quite a suprise to find a twist in the tale.\n\nIf you like movies with a lot of action then you will enjoy this movie. The story is described well, the acting is very good and it keeps you interested.\n\nVirasat\n\nVirasat means Dynasty. Shakti (Anil Kapoor) returns from England after completing his studies. His Indian girlfriend from England accompanies him home. Father and son have different visions of his future and the father is disappointed with his choice to leave the village and abandon his responsibilities and the dynasty.\n\nHowever circumstances result in a a drastic change of plans for Shakti and his attitude to the village. The movie depicts clash of cultures, simple village life, beautiful scenery and the development of respect and love for his wife and her devotion and love for him.\n\nI liked this and a few other parts of the movie a lot. The music is beautiful and the lead actors are excellent in their roles. However I think the movie ended on a sudden note. I wondered if it was meant for a sequel, but it is over 10 years since this movie was released so I guess there is no sequel. Although the movie won several awards, I am rating it as average. If you like beautiful music and scenery, then watch the movie, but the ending spoiled it for me. It just did not make sense. If anyone who has seen it has another view please let me know.\n\nBurn after Reading\n\nA black comedy by the Coen Brothers, with a star studded cast including, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John Malcovich and Tilda Swinton amongst other actors. There is an air of mystery created when a DVD is found in the ladies locker room of a gym. A trainer, Brad Pitt(Chad Feldheimer) presumes it is highly classified material and shares this information with his colleague Frances McDormand (Linda Lidsky).\n\nJohn Malcovich gives a great performance as the frustrated, fired CIA employee who is highly irritated when he gets a call from Chad Feldheimer. This DVD leads to a chain of events and the movie takes on a black turn when John Malcovich (Osbourne Cox) believes that the bumbling, inept Chad is threatening him instead of just seeking a reward.\n\nI enjoyed watching Brad Pitt as the gum chewing gym trainer. His performance is excellent. So is Frances McDormand as the woman who is determined to find a means to pay for her make over by a plastic surgeon. There are various extra - marital affairs and cover ups, annoyances, irritations and surprises along the way. I enjoyed the movie as the plot was so hilarious. Totally insignificant and harmless information gets so out of hand that it creates a whole web of mystery and fatalities. It is worth watching, but perhaps not with young kids as some of the language may not be suitable.\n\nAaja Nachle\n\nThe title means, Come Let Us Dance. Madhuri Dixit as (Dia), a divorced mother returns to her hometown in India after having lived abroad for 11 years. There is a scandal around why she left and it is with some apprehension of ostracism that she returns to visit her dying guru.\n\nHe dies before she arrives but he has requested her to restore Ajanta Theatre , the center for arts which used to be a vibrant place, back to its former glory. She is determined to fulfil her mentor's wishes. This venture is not without its challenges as others do not wish the center to be restored. She faces many setbacks, corrupt businessmen, challenging and inexperienced local talent, disappointment, frustrations and finally victory. She restores the Ajanta Theatre, a center for the Arts and plans to reconcile with her parents.\n\nThe characters are very likable and the movie is colorful with many dance sequences and beautiful songs woven around the attempt to restore the a"
