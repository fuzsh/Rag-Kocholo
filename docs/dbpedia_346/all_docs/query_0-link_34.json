        "text": "Perspectives of Intertextuality in Cinema, with Special References to the Work of Kristeva, Barthes, and Jenny: A Comparative Study\n\nJanuary 2024\n\n·\n\n106 Reads\n\nAVANCA | CINEMA\n\nVahid Rajabi\n\n·\n\nAfsaneh Nazeri\n\n·\n\nSamira Khodabakhshi\n\nSince its inception, intertextuality has been one of the fundamental literary theories and drawn the interest of numerous theoreticians. First-generation intertextuality thinkers, led by figures such as Julia Kristeva and Roland Barthes, mainly considered the theoretical aspect of intertextuality. Conversely, the second generation, comprising the likes of Laurent Jenny and Michael Riffaterre, championed a more applied view of this theory. Having pervaded various art forms, particularly cinema, intertextuality has earned an important status in art criticism. This research presents a comparative study of the ideas of first- and second-generation intertextuality theorists in regard to cinema, seeking answers to the question of how intertextual expressions and the views of intertextuality theorists have manifested in film through descriptive-analytical and comparative methods. Our findings reveal how the different aspects of intertextuality theories are being used in films today.\n\nView\n\nForking-Path Modular Narratives in Cinema with an Approach to the Film Four Finger (2007)\n\nNovember 2019\n\n·\n\n1,671 Reads\n\nVahid Rajabi\n\n·\n\nPayam Heydari\n\nThe term 'modular narrative' refers to a style of film narration which follows a nonlinear pattern of storytelling and, thus, challenges the audience. As a major development in today's cinema, modular narrative, itself categorized into various types, forms the narrative structure of several notable contemporary films. Reverse narrative, networked narrative, and forking-path narrative are among the major types of modular narrative. This paper aims to assess and analyze the forking-path variation of modular narrative. This narrative structure has had massive impact on world cinema as well; Iranian cinema, for instance, experienced the structure in a distinctive manner, with Saeid Soheili's Four Finger (2007) being the prime example. The theoretical approach employed in this research was devised as analytical-interpretive, and based on the ideas of well-known film theorists David Bordwell and Allan Cameron. This paper seeks to introduce a different form of forking-path narratives and its widespread influence on cinema by examining a particular case which originates in Iranian cinema. In conclusion, the authors will present the findings of this research regarding the question how films employing modular-and especially forking-narratives have influenced contemporary intellectual cinema.\n\nView\n\nLas películas censuradas durante la Segunda República. Valores y temores de la sociedad republicana española (1931-1936)\n\nNovember 2010\n\n·\n\n600 Reads\n\n·\n\n6 Citations\n\nEstudios sobre el Mensaje Periodístico\n\nMaría Antonia Paz Rebollo\n\n·\n\nJulio Montero\n\nSe aborda desde documentación inédita la actuación de la censura cinematográfica durante la Segunda República española (1931-1936). Se estudian las películas que se prohibieron y los cortes que se ordenaron para otras. Estas actuaciones permiten establecer algunos de los valores que ordenaban la sociedad española de la época y también sus principales temores y miedos en el orden político y social. También se pueden establecer una cifras fiables sobre el cine que vieron los españoles y la importancia que tuvieron las producciones documentales y los noticiarios cinematográficos en nuestras pantallas. From unpublished documentation this paper approaches the intervention of the film censorship during the Second Spanish Republic (1931-1936). It analyzes the films which were banned and the cuts that were ordered for others. These actions allow us to establish some of the values that configured the Spanish society of that time and also its main concerns and fears about political and social matters. We can also lay down reliable figures about the cinema that the Spaniards saw and the importance that the documentaries and newsreels had on our screens.\n\nView\n\nErasing “Knowable Communities”: From Saturday Night and Sunday Morning to Brassed Off\n\nNovember 2023\n\n·\n\n32 Reads\n\nText Matters\n\nThe paper discusses cinematic representations of working class communities in British cinema from the pre-war documentary movement to (post-)Thatcher feature films chronicling the decline of traditional industries. A particular focus is given to contrasting Karel Reisz’s Saturday Night and Sunday Morning and Mark Herman’s Brassed Off. The former title serves as a model example of British New Wave cinema, marking the “discovery” of the working class with its “knowable communities” that revealed them to the general public. The latter film provides an apt illustration of the impact and consequences of Thatcherism on the very same communities. The paper elaborates on selected narrative and visual motifs, investigating the ways in which British filmmakers have striven to depict social changes in British society over the consecutive decades.\n\nView"
