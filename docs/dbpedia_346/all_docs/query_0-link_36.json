        "text": "NEW DELHI — The Bollywood director Vishal Bhardwaj has made his name by adapting Shakespeare into film, using the plays to reflect the violence and vicissitudes of modern India. “Maqbool,” an adaptation of “Macbeth,” was set in the Mumbai underworld; “Omkara” transported “Othello” to the feudal badlands of northern India. His latest effort, a loose adaptation of “Hamlet” called “Haider,” which takes place in Kashmir during the turbulent 1990s, has become the most acclaimed and contentious Bollywood movie of the year.\n\nThe film, which opened internationally on Oct. 2, drew a fierce reaction on social media from Hindu nationalists, who called for a boycott. Kashmir, a disputed territory claimed by both India and Pakistan, remains a sensitive subject on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nOne post said on Twitter: “Any movie that sympathizes with terrorists, glorifies them; insults Indian Army & justifies ethnic cleansing, goes to the bin. #BoycottHaider.” The campaign’s Facebook page includes a photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a conservative whose election this year has emboldened Indians who advocate a muscular, unapologetic nationalism.\n\nJournalists in India’s national media, however, greeted the movie with rapturous praise. The columnist Mukul Kesavan, writing in The Telegraph newspaper in Kolkata, said its “great achievement is to bring Kashmir out of the closet.” The Mint newspaper called it an “immensely effective reimagination of Shakespeare.”\n\nIn The New York Times, Rachel Saltz suggested that the movie “grafts its source story less convincingly to its setting” than Mr. Bhardwaj’s previous efforts while providing “the occasional sharp reminder of how cinematically he can construct Shakespearean moments.” Over the weekend, “Haider” won the people’s choice award in the world genre category at the Rome Film Festival.\n\nThe movie’s portrait of Kashmir is radical by Bollywood standards. Avoiding nationalist arguments, the film portrays the tragic human cost of the conflict and its netherworld of disappearances, military torture and extrajudicial killings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
