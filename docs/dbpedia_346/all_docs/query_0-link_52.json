Music: Amit Trivedi\n\nDirector Vikas Bahl (of ‘Queen’ fame) had garnered a lot of critical acclaim from his last Outing ‘Queen’. But in his latest outing ‘Shaandaar’, supposed to be a romantic comedy with all the elements of a family drama, Vikas has seriously failed to woo the cine goers\n\nThe film kicks off with an animated sequence with a voice over by Naseeruddin Shah introducing all the characters. The scenario In opens with Vipin Arora (Pankaj Kapur) driving an orphan girl Alia (Alia Bhatt) whom he adopts and brings home where the girl is mistreated by his mom (Sushma Seth) & wife (Niki Aneja). Alia is suffering from a sleep disorder whose world revolves around her adopted father (Pankaj Kapur) and his half sister Isha (Sanah Kapoor). Pankaj Kapur plays a possessive father who is very protective for his daughters Alia & Isha. The movie showcases about 2 affluent families one headed by cunning Kamla Arora a Punjabi Businesswomen and the other headed by money minded Sindhi tycoon Harry Fandwani (Sanjay Kapoor). Both the families are on the verge of bankruptcy and come together for a destination marriage cum Business deal between Vipin’s daughter Isha & Harry’s brother Robin. There is also a wedding planner Jagjinder Joginder called JJ played (Shahid Kapoor) who falls in love with Alia.\n\nDirector Vikas Bahl fails to impress the audiences this time. In fact, the film has weak in some departments including Vikas’ direction albeit the film has its plus points its mesmerizing photography, lovely sets, attractive locales and above all some catchy numbers too.\n\nPerformance wise débutante Sanah Kapoor is superb. Shahid Kapoor is 1st rate. Alia Bhatt as usual is outstanding while the rest of the cast is just about ok.\n\nAll in all this time around Vikas’ ‘Queen’ is certainly not ‘Shaandaar."
