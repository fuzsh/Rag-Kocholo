He is 43 years old as of 2024.\n\nEarly Life and Background\n\nShahid Kapoor was born on February 25, 1981, in New Delhi, into a family with deep roots in the Indian entertainment industry. His parents, actor Pankaj Kapur and actor-dancer Neelima Azeem, divorced when he was three, so he grew up in Delhi with his mother and maternal grandparents, while his father relocated to Mumbai and remarried actress Supriya Pathak. Shahid formed a close relationship with his grandfather, a journalist for the Russian publication Sputnik, and treasured the stories and letters he shared about his father. Kapoor only saw his father, who was struggling to make a name for himself in Mumbai, on his birthday every year. Shahid and his mother relocated to Mumbai when Shahid was 10 years old. Azeem later married actor Rajesh Khattar, with whom she had Kapoor's half-brother, Ishaan. Kapoor has two paternal half-siblings, Sanah and Ruhaan, from his father's marriage to Pathak.\n\nShahid completed his education in Delhi and then at Rajhans Vidyalaya in Mumbai before spending three years at Mumbai's Mithibai College. His love of dance led him to Shiamak Davar's dance institute at the age of 15, where he excelled as a background dancer in films and an instructor. During this period of his life, he also landed an unexpected commercial with Shah Rukh Khan and appeared in other advertisements and music videos, signalling the start of his career in the entertainment industry.\n\nIn 1998, Kapoor also assisted his father on the television series \"Mohandas B.A.L.L.B.\", honing his industry skills. Despite the complex dynamics of his family life, Shahid Kapoor's early experiences shaped his career, highlighting a journey of resilience and determination to become one of the most celebrated actors in Indian cinema.\n\nGirlfriends and Affairs\n\nOne of the top actors in Indian cinema Shahid Kapoor frequently appears in the news due to his relationships and other antics. Millions of females' hearts were broken when Shahid Kapoor one of Bollywood's most eligible bachelors announced his engagement to Mira Rajput a Delhi-based woman. Shahid and Mira exchanged vows on June 10 2015. Prior to this though Shahid Kapoor had relationships with practically all of his co-stars and his deadly charm seems to have charmed them all. Let us now take you on a journey through Shahid's past and introduce you to all the hot Bollywood divas he has been associated with.\n\nHrishitaa Bhatt\n\nShahid Kapoor dated actress and model Hrishitaa Bhatt even before becoming well-known in B-town. The two appeared opposite each other in an Aryan music video. The audience enjoyed their chemistry in the song Aankhon me Tera hi Chehra. Shahid soon won his first movie, though and romance was put on the back burner for him.\n\nKareena Kapoor Khan\n\nThe relationship between Kareena Kapoor Khan and Shahid Kapoor began during the making of the movie Fida. Because they were so forthright about their relationship, the two became the public's favourite couple. The couple's debut on Koffee With Karan was a tremendous success as well. They dated for over five years before breaking up because Kareena allegedly began to develop feelings for her co-star Saif Ali Khan, who is now her husband. Before informing the world about his wedding with Mira, Shahid reportedly told Kareena.\n\nAs reported in MissMalini, here is what Kareena reportedly said: \"We were both performing at a Femina gathering. We talked. So before he told the public he actually told me about getting married. I'm thrilled for him. He's doing really well in his career... Although my sister has already seen Haider, she really enjoyed it. And I can attest to the coolness of marriage. I just want to say good luck to him.\"\n\nThe reason for their breakup is still not known. But according to reports, it was alleged that Kareena changed her eating and adopted a vegetarian lifestyle as a result of Shahid's strong influence. Kareena Kapoor Khan additionally acquired a spiritual leaning. There was widespread admiration for Kareena and Shahid's union off the screen. But the two broke up soon after finishing their 2007 film, Jab We Met.\n\nSania Mirza\n\nSania Mirza is an Indian tennis player. A few years ago, Sania Mirza and Shahid Kapoor were said to be dating. Apparently, the two of them were spending a lot of time together. After breaking up with Kareena Kapoor, Shahid admitted to dating Sania. Shahid is allegedly Sania's first committed relationship. Sania and Shahid were spotted dancing and cuddling in five-star hotels.\n\nThe connection between Bollywood and sports gave the paparazzi a tonne of stuff to work with. Shahid and Sania were enjoying themselves. On the Vishal Bharadwaj-directed film Kaminay's set Sania and Shahid reportedly chatted for nearly eight hours. Sania Mirza, though, kept referring to the relationship as a good friend, as she always does.\n\nPriyanka Chopra\n\nPriyanka Chopra was rumoured to be dating Bollywood's biggest name at the time, Shahid Kapoor. Rumour mongers in Bollywood had a great time spreading this story. During the filming of Kaminey, the charming guy got involved with the Bollywood desi girl.\n\nWhen the IT team arrived at Priyanka's house early in the morning, Shahid Kapoor allegedly answered the door in his boxers. Despite the fact that they have never admitted to such charges, their actions speak louder than words. The chemistry they showed on Koffee With Karan.\n\nEveryone was surprised to learn about their relationship, which had been kept hidden. They never revealed their relationship to the public, but in a later interview, Shahid came dangerously close to admitting he was seeing Priyanka.\n\nAnushka Sharma\n\nIn the crime comedy Badmaash Company Shahid Kapoor and Anushka Sharma had a hot lip lock that was impossible to forget. But did you know that Shahid and Anushka were reportedly seen kissing during Imran Khan's Mere Brother Ki Dulhan victory celebration? The rumors of Shahid dating his co-star Anushka dominated the news for a while when it was reported that they had kissed at the celebration.\n\nAmrita Rao\n\nThere were rumours that Shahid was dating Amrita Rao after the success of his co-star in the film Ishq Vishk. Although there wasn't much substance to those rumours at the time they were fed by their sizzlingly cute on- and off-screen chemistry.\n\nHowever, the rumours about Shahid and Amrita's relationship began to circulate once more as they were filming for their movie Vivah. Again the chemistry they displayed on film fueled the rumors that they were having an affair.\n\nIn fact, it was said that Shahid began seeing Amrita after he and Kareena split up. Amrita insisted that they were simply excellent friends nevertheless. Amrita denied the rumors that she was dating Shahid in an interview she stated that Despite what the news seems to suggest we are not in love. Sometimes I read in the news that Shahid and I are in a relationship but this is untrue.\n\nBipasha Basu\n\nBipasha Basu and Shahid Kapoor collaborated on the movie Shikhar. Additionally, while they were filming the movie there were rumors that they were dating. While making their movie the couple became too close. They were observed socializing and having fun with their friends.\n\nWife Mira Rajput and Marriage Story\n\nIn March 2015, Shahid Kapoor announced his plans to marry Mira Rajput, a university student from New Delhi aged 13 years younger than him. Reports from The Times of India suggest that Kapoor met Rajput through the spiritual organization Radha Soami Satsang Beas. The couple tied the knot in a close-knit ceremony in Gurgaon on July 7, 2015. They have been blessed with two children. Their daughter, Misha was born in August 2016, and their son, Zain arrived in September 2018.\n\nMira's family and Shahid and his father are both members of a religious organisation called Radha Soami Satsang Beas. Shahid said in an interview with a reputable newspaper that they initially met at Mira's farm residence in Delhi.\n\nShahid met her just before he started filming for Udta Punjab. Before getting married the couple had only had three or four meetings, according to the actor. It was a private ceremony that was followed by a wedding banquet that was attended by the A-list Bollywood actors. Misha was born to Shahid and Mira on August 26, 2016 and she is their first child.\n\nDespite not being frequently seen in public, Misha frequently appears in her parents' social media updates. The couple had their second child on August 5, 2018. Later the couple disclosed that they had given their son the name Zain Kapoor. The duo consistently draws attention on social media. They are the epitome of modern-day couple goals!\n\nStruggle\n\nShahid has always been a pleasure to watch on screen, from his chocolate boy looks in his debut movie, Ishq Vishk, to his gruff, rough-tough attitude in the upcoming Udta Punjab. Shahid Kapoor's journey has been interesting in terms of Bollywood. Shahid Kapoor's relationship with the camera first started when he and Ayesha Takia appeared as kid actors in a Complan commercial. Shahid's 13-year cinematic career has seen him develop exclusively with the projects he has worked on. The actor has discussed his industry challenges in several interviews.\n\nDespite the fact that Shahid Kapoor's parents were actors, he pointed out that they weren't stars and thus, had no sway in the industry. As he navigated his early career, Kapoor admitted to being unsure of whom to meet, what to say, and how to behave. Reflecting on his journey, Kapoor expressed gratitude for his career, attributing it as a divine gift. He emphasised the importance of not taking his achievements for granted, even if it might induce a chuckle or two. Kapoor candidly shared that his journey to where he is now took 13 years; implying the he understands that gaining comfort and confidence within the industry might just take as long.\n\nFrom a young age Kapoor had a passion for dance and at the age of 15 he enrolled in Shiamak Davar's dance school. When he was a student there Kapoor danced in the backdrop of the movies Dil To Pagal Hai (1997) and Taal (1999) whose choreography was by Davar. Kapoor participated in the songs Vogue and Golden Eye during a stage performance at the institute, garnering a warm reception from the crowd; he cited the occasion as the first time he felt like a celebrity. Later, he was hired by the institute to teach.\n\nShah Rukh Khan Kajol and Rani Mukerji were the stars of a Pepsi commercial that Kapoor attended with a friend, but he ended up getting the part. He was featured in music videos for a number of artists, including the band Aryans and the vocalist Kumar Sanu and he made appearances in television advertisements for the brands Kit Kat and Close-Up, among others. In the 1998 television series, Mohandas B.A.L.L.B. Kapoor also took on the role of his father's assistant director.\n\nMovies and Career\n\nLooking back on his career Shahid was once seen as a weakness by critics, who later gave him credit for making it a hallmark. According to Jitesh Pillai of Filmfare, after becoming well-known for his urban romantic roles, Kapoor bucked stereotypes by taking on a variety of roles in crime dramas and action movies. He pointed out that Kapoor's professional path fluctuated as a result of her resistance to being slotted under any kind of tag.\n\nHe was listed among the top 50 in the Indian edition of Forbes' Celebrity 100, a ranking based on the popularity and income of India's superstars and peaked at the 15th spot in 2015. He was regarded as one of the most gorgeous male celebrities in India. Producer Ramesh Taurani was eager to cast Kapoor in a movie after spotting him in the Aryans' Aankhon Mein music video. Taurani advised Kapoor to wait a few years since, upon first meeting him, she believed Shahid, who was 20 at the time, to be too young and underweight to become an actor. In contrast, Kapoor declined a lead role in N. Chandra's sex comedy Style in order to collaborate with Taurani. Let's explore some of the best movies Shahid Kapoor has given to Hindi cinema.\n\nIshq Vishk (2009)\n\n\"Ishq Vishk\" is a narrative about high school student Rajiv Mathur, portrayed by Shahid Kapoor, who finds himself entangled in a romantic endeavor with two classmates, each possessing distinctly different personalities, portrayed by Amrita Rao and Shenaz Treasurywala. Kapoor was intrigued to play a character that deviated from the commonplace portrayal of teenage heroes in Indian cinema- he was playing an unlikable lead.\n\nThe role offered a fresh perspective to Kapoor, appealing to his desire for non-traditional acting roles. The character didn't fit the regular \"hero\" mold, a point further underscored by critic Ziya Us Salam in The Hindu. Salam noted that Kapoor didn't seem to be \"hero material,\" due to his youthful face, but added that he wasn’t lacking in the acting department.\n\nDespite the mixed feedback, \"Ishq Vishk\" turned out to be a sleeper hit at the box office, much to the surprise and delight of many. This success enhanced Kapoor's visibility and credibility as an actor, culminating in his win for the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. This victory marked a significant milestone in Kapoor's career, indicating the promising trajectory that lay ahead of him.\n\nVivah (2006)\n\n\"Vivah\" is a 2006 Hindi romantic drama written and directed by Sooraj R. Barjatya, featuring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao as the leads. Produced by Rajshri Productions, the film explores the journey of two individuals from their engagement to the aftermath of their marriage. Despite mixed reviews, the film emerged as a commercial success, marking the highest grossing success for Kapoor and Rao at that point, and even sparking changes to marriage representation in cinema.\n\nThe storyline revolves around Poonam, a middle-class girl from Madhupur in Uttar Pradesh, brought up by her uncle Krishnakant after her parents' demise. Krishnakant’s wife Rama, struggles with jealousy towards Poonam. Despite this, Poonam develops a sisterly bond with their daughter Rajni.\n\nHarish Chandra Bajpayee, a successful businessman from New Delhi, and father to Prem, a soft-spoken and well-educated individual, receives a marriage proposal for his son from his friend Bhagat, a jeweller. Hesitant at first, Prem agrees to meet Poonam following an encounter that leads to mutual attraction and subsequent engagement.\n\nKrishnakant then invites the Bajpayees to their summer home, offering Prem and Poonam time to bond before Prem leaves for an essential business venture in Japan. Upon his return, a welcome home celebration for him turns tragic when a fire severely injures Poonam while she's saving Rajni.\n\nDeeply affected by Poonam’s condition and her selfless act, Prem, despite Poonam's injuries, decides to marry Poonam, arranging for Delhi’s top doctors for her treatment. The duo then goes through a traditional wedding after a successful surgery, marking the commencement of their new lives. The film concludes with an intimate scene between Poonam and Prem, encapsulating their unyielding love in the face of adversity.\n\nJab We Met (2007)\n\n\"Jab We Met\" is a successful 2007 Hindi romantic comedy written and directed by Imtiaz Ali and produced by Dhilin Mehta. The film, set mostly in Mumbai, Bhatinda, and Shimla, stars Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor in leading roles, recounting the unplanned journey and eventual love story of Aditya Kashyap, a broken businessman, and Geet Dhillon, a lively Punjabi girl.\n\nHeartbroken Aditya unknowingly embarks on a life-changing train ride when he meets chatterbox Geet. Missing their train sets them off on an unforgettable journey to Geet's home in Bhatinda. The trip fosters a close bond between the duo, with Geet's infectious optimism helping Aditya break out of his shell. While Geet plans to elope with her boyfriend, Aditya's developing feelings for her begin to complicate matters.\n\nAfter dwelling in Geet’s contagious positivity, Aditya revives his failing company and rebuilds strained familial relations. When Geet's family confronts him about her disappearance since their elopement, Aditya, despite being unaware of her situation, promises to find her. Discovering Geet leading a solitary life as a teacher in Shimla after being rejected by Anshuman, Aditya helps her regain her positivity.\n\nTheir return to Bhatinda causes confusion, as Geet and Anshuman's attempts to reconnect lead to Aditya's departure. However, the moment of clarity comes when Geet, amidst fragmented emotions, realizes her love for Aditya and not Anshuman. Encountering love in adversity, Geet and Aditya share a passionate moment, and the two decide to marry with their families' blessings, encapsulating their vibrant journey leading to 'when they met.'\n\nThe film gained critical acclaim and commercial success. Among its accolades, it won Best Female Playback Singer and Best Choreography at the National Film Awards and Best Actress and Best Dialogue at the Filmfare Awards, making it a cult classic.\n\nHaider (2014)\n\n\"Haider\", a 2014 Indian crime thriller directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, is an adaption of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" and Basharat Peer's memoir \"Curfewed Night\". It tells the story of Haider, a student seeking the truth about his father's disappearance amidst the 1995 Kashmir conflicts. Screening at the 19th Busan International Film Festival, its release spurred controversy yet was met with critical acclaim, widespread commercial success and an array of awards.\n\nHaider's father, Hilaal, a Srinagar-based doctor, harbors a terrorist leader, leading to his disappearance after a military raid. Haider returns to a changed home, finding an unsettling closeness between his mother Ghazala and his uncle Khurram. With his childhood love, Arshia, he sets off on a relentless quest for his father.\n\nWhen an estranged freedom fighter, Roohdaar, provides him the condemning news of Khurram's betrayal leading to Hilaal's death, Haider is shattered. Driven by revenge against his own kin, he is caught in a whirl of anguish and fury, staging public protests against government atrocities.\n\nHis erratic behavior, along with Roohdaar's revelation, poses a threat to Khurram, who has Haider institutionalized.

Despite Khurram's pleas, Haider spares his life, symbolizing the triumph of forgiveness over retribution, leaving the audience with a poignant narrative of personal and political conflicts.\n\nUdta Punjab (2016)\n\n\"Udta Punjab\" is a 2016 Indian Hindi film directed by Abhishek Chaubey, exploring drug abuse in Punjab.

Shahid never misses an opportunity to respond to the online bullies who try to harm him on social media. During the Rockstars World Tour in 2007, the pair fell out.\n\nAccording to reports, Shahid Kapoor and Salman Khan were rehearsing in the United States for a performance when the Jab We Met actor, who is a skilled dancer, rectified a few of Salman's moves. The Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor was unhappy because he didn't like it. At the time, Kareena Kapoor and Shahid were dating and she attempted to act as their middleman.\n\nEven though the tour was not so successful, Salman asked to get paid less but Shahid took the full fee, which makes Salman Khan’s Temper even higher. Salman received an apology from Shahid after this event but at first the actor didn't want to accept it. When Shahid and Rani Mukerji appeared on Salman's game programme 10 Ka Dum to promote their film Dil Bole Hadippa, they were able to reconcile their differences.\n\nKabir Singh Movie Controversy\n\nShahid Kapoor has received a number of intriguing assignments ever since Kabir Singh was launched and became the biggest blockbuster of 2019. The Sandeep Reddy Vanga-directed movie however received criticism once it came out for its controversial subject matter and depiction of toxic masculinity. Shahid Kapoor remained silent about the topic for a long time but the actor skillfully defended the movie in a media interview.\n\nIn response to criticism of Kabir Singh Shahid Kapoor explains that movies simply mean to mirror life using megastar Amitabh Bachchan as an example. The actor said If you think that movies are an educational institution where you're taught what you should or shouldn't do that's your choice. The purpose of the film is to depict life. It has to do with telling the truth. It's an adult movie made for grownups who can recognize right from wrong. Are you saying that Mr. Bachchan is a person who taught others how to commit theft? You are aware that you will be seeing a work of fiction don't you?\n\nSimilar circumstances have occurred in my life. If a third party witnesses a couple fighting they will perceive it differently. They are fundamentally in love. Independent ladies have dated straightforward lads and vice versa. Life is unpredictable in that way. Why is a problem present? You may decide what you want to take away from the movie. That is the essence of democracy.\n\nAditya Chopra Controversy\n\nEvery actor in Bollywood aspires to work for Yash Raj Films but Shahid Kapoor risked annoying Aditya Chopra the head of the studio. The rumors of a fallout go back to the days of Shuddh Desi Romance when Shahid signed Maneesh Sharma to direct the film but later backed out due to Maneesh's deteriorating health. Sasha was replaced by Sushant Singh Rajput. Another issue that developed between Aditya and the 35-year-old actor was that the actor was asked to leave after showing up in shorts for one of their rituals. Additionally he had turned down invitations to later reading and rehearsal sessions.\n\nIn Shahid Kapoor's lengthy career there have been numerous instances where his unprofessional behavior has been openly displayed. Before advising Balaji Motion Pictures not to be overly interested in portraying Chhota Rajan's role in Once Upon a Time in Mumbai Dobaara Shahid made them wait two months! One of the reasons he missed out on major projects like Gori Tere Pyar Mein produced by Karan Johar and Siddharth Anand's Bang Bang was his arrogance.\n\nNet Worth\n\nShahid Kapoor, also referred to by his followers as the ShaSha, is one of those performers who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He is one of the few actors in the nation with such a large fan base. The amazing line delivery and epic comic timing of Shahid Kapoor are well-known.\n\nHe began performing in 2003 and has since achieved considerable success in both domestic and foreign films. He is currently one of the best-known and richest actors in the nation. Shahid Kapoor has a $36 million net worth (Rs. 258 crore).\n\nThis home was situated in the Indian city of Mumbai's suburbs. In 2014, Shahid Kapoor paid 12 crore rupees to purchase this home. This home is presently selling for more than 20 crore rupees. Shahid Kapoor amassed an exceptional collection of opulent automobiles, such as the Audi BMW 7 Series, Lexus 470 Mustang, Range Rover and Land Cruiser, among others. Each car has an INR price range of 50 lakhs to 2 crores.\n\nAdditionally, it has been noted that Shahid Kapoor's net worth has increased by 70% over the past several years. His revenues primarily come from acting in movies, brand endorsements and personal investments. In addition to his performing remuneration, Shahid Kapoor receives a profit share from his films.\n\nHe accepts a sizable payment for brand endorsements. Shahid is constantly at the top of the list when it comes to giving charity and social service because of his enormous success and earnings. Mr. Kapoor is one of the largest taxpayers in the nation and ranks first when it comes to income tax payments.\n\nAwards and Achievements\n\n2004- Won International Indian Film Academy Awards- Best Male Debut-Ishq Vishk\n\n2008- Won Stardust Awards-Best Actor (Editor's Choice)-Jab We Met\n\n2008- Won Star Guild Awards-Chevrolet Heartbeat of the Nation (Male)- Jab We Met\n\n2010: Best Anchor - Music/Film Based Show - Star Screen Awards - Winner of International Indian Film Academy Awards\n\n2010- Won Screen Awards-Best Actor (Popular Choice)- Kaminey\n\n2014- Won BIG Star Entertainment Awards-Most Entertaining Film Actor - Male-Haider\n\n2019- Won Screen Awards-Screen Award for Entertainer of the Year-Kabir Singh\n\n2020-Best Anchor - Music/film Based Show - Star Screen Awards - Winner of International Indian Film Academy Awards\n\nOther Awards\n\n2004-Sansui Viewer's Choice Awards-Most Promising Debut Actor - Ishq Vishk\n\n2005-Blistex Awards-Best Lips - Male Won\n\n2007-Sports World Awards-Jodi of the Year (along with Amrita Rao) - Vivah\n\n2008-Annual Central European Bollywood Awards-Best Couple (along with Kareena Kapoor) - Jab We Met\n\n2009-Rajiv Gandhi Award-Kaminey\n\n2009-Teacher's Achievement Awards People Achiever Award\n\n2009-PETA-Voted as the Sexiest Male Vegetarian In Asia\n\n2011-Fun and Fearless Awards-Male Actor 2010\n\n2011-Telly Chakkar's New Talent Awards Youth Icon Of The Year\n\n2012-Fun and Fearless Awards 2012 Most Desirable Men\n\n2012-GQ Men Of The Year Awards-Award for The Ultimate GQ Man\n\n2015-HT India’s Most Stylish Awards-Most Stylish Bollywood Actor of the Year\n\n2017-Filmfare Glamour and Style Awards-Most Stylish Star (Male)\n\n2018-HELLO! Hall of Fame Awards-Best Actor (Critics) - Padmaavat\n\n2019-Vogue Beauty Awards-Man of the Decade\n\nPublic Image\n\nIn a 2014 GQ feature, journalist Dave Besseling painted Shahid Kapoor as the quintessential affable frat-boy type – the kind one might enjoy playing video games with on a laid-back Sunday, albeit with a word of caution about keeping him away from one's sister. Despite this friendly characterization, Kapoor has faced the label of being a reclusive figure by some segments of the media, tagged as both arrogant and temperamental. This complex imagery, as reported by Vickey Lalwani of the Mumbai Mirror in 2012, has reportedly made certain filmmakers hesitate before casting him.\n\nKapoor addressed these views by highlighting his low-profile lifestyle, noting his preference for limited social interactions and disinterest in partying. He admitted to a sense of awkwardness when not engaged in film-related discussions, which perhaps contributed to perceptions of him as standoffish.\n\nThe entertainment website Bollywood Hungama reflected on how Kapoor's \"boy next door\" appeal, initially seen as a hindrance, eventually became his signature trait. Filmfare's Jitesh Pillai recognized Kapoor's shift from urban romantic flicks to a broader palette of crime and action genres, applauding his resistance to being pigeonholed, although acknowledging the impact on his career's consistency. Kapoor himself attributed his career's revival to his adventurous role in \"Haider\" (2014), a period marked by introspection and transformation post a series of professional setbacks.\n\nSonal Gera from The Indian Express and author Koral Dasgupta in her book \"Power of a Common Man\" both highlighted Kapoor's non-conformity to the industry's stereotypes, citing his maintained popularity despite a mix of hits and misses at the box office.\n\nKapoor's widespread appeal is underscored by a robust following on social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, complemented by his consistent recognition among India's most desirable men. Featured prominently in Eastern Eye's \"50 Sexiest Asian Men in the World\" and The Times of India's list of 50 most-desirable men, his charisma and attractiveness haven't gone unnoticed. He was heralded as the sexiest vegetarian in India and the Asia-Pacific region by PETA in 2009 and 2011, reinforcing his wide-ranging appeal.\n\nHis financial influence and celebrity status have been documented by Forbes' \"Celebrity 100\" list in India, where he consistently ranked among the top celebrities based on income and popularity from 2012 to 2019, reaching his peak at the 15th spot in 2015. Kapoor has also served as the face of several prominent brands, further expanding his influence beyond the silver screen. In 2019, his prestige was immortalized with a wax figure at Madame Tussauds Singapore.\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan was shown being wrapped in a white cloth in one of the songs.
