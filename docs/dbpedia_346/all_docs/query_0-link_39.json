        "text": "The documentary film screenings are best supplemented through assigned readings that provide a proper historical background to the Kashmir conflict. These could be selections from studies by scholars such as Sumantra Bose or Chitralekha Zutshi, or articles by public intellectuals such as Pankaj Mishra or Eqbal Ahmed.3 The best film for a general overview of the conflict is Sanjay Kak’s Jashn-e-Azadi. As the film received a hostile critical reception from some members of Kashmir’s Hindu minority, it might be advisable to screen it with Ajay Raina’s Tell Them the Tree They Had Planted Has Now Grown, which is more sympathetic to dominant political perceptions within the Kashmiri Hindu minority. Kak’s film can be used to initiate discussions on the history of the conflict, militarization in Kashmir, India’s counterinsurgency efforts, human rights violations in Kashmir, and the enduring dream of azaadi (freedom) in Kashmir. Or else a screening of Jashn-e-Azadi could be combined with a screening of Ashwin Kumar’s Inshallah Kashmir, which also provides a good introduction to the conflict. Alternatively, the instructor can combine a screening of Pather Chujaeri and Soz: A Ballad of Melodies to introduce students to the conflict through its impact on the arts in Kashmir. An instructor can also choose to focus on the gendered nature of the conflict by screening either Khoon Diy Baarav or Yi As Akh Padshah Bai. Additionally, the instructors could consider screening some Bollywood films on the Kashmir crisis (or clips from these films) and encourage the students to contrast the ideological work of mainstream Bollywood films (for instance, the portrayal of Kashmir as an object of desire in films such as the 1964 Kashmir Ki Kali) with the questioning of such dominant modes of representing Kashmir in documentary films such as Jashn-e-Azadi and Khoon Diy Baarav. Some of the Bollywood films on the Kashmir crisis that the instructors can consider screening are Roja (Mani Ratnam, 1992), Mission Kashmir (Vidhu Vinod Chopra, 2000), Yahaan (Shoojit Sircar, 2005), Lamha (Rahul Dholakia, 2010), Haider (Vishal Bhardwaj, 2015), and Shikara (Vidhu Vinod Chopra, 2020). The instructors can ask students to compare the ideological perspectives in these films from India with the ones found in a Pakistani popular film such as Azaadi (Imran Malik, 2018). The instructor can also supplement student learning on Kashmir by assigning a short novel (such as Feroz Rather’s The Night of Broken Glass) or a graphic novel (such as Malik Sajad’s Munnu: A Boy from Kashmir) to go with the documentary film screenings. Or the instructor could simply choose a few poems such as “Farewell” from the Kashmiri poet Agha Shahid Ali’s collection on the Kashmir conflict, The Country without a Post Office.4 In “Farewell,” Ali writes: “My memory keeps getting in the way of your history.” Teaching with source material that records and retrieves Kashmiri memories (such as the documentary) can help students develop a nuanced critical perspective on the Kashmir conflict that resists the violence of history and opens up new pathways of understanding toward an enduring peace in Kashmir."
