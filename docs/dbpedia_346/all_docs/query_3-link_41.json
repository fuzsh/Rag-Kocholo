        "text": "Dr Nimjee took his time to explain everything about my aneurysm. He was extremely competent and knowledgeable. I feel like he is the best in his field . He was very friendly and made me feel at ease . I feel very good that he will be doing my surgery.\n\nDr Nimjee is a Saint. I feel so fortunate to have found him to help me with this procedure coming up. He is so very terrific with a brilliant sense of humor. I appreciate his excellence and you have a gem of a provider with Dr Nimjee. I appreciate how he had a sense of what my health issue was from the start. He explained it in a very clear way at the very first visit. Then he diagnosed it and now he plans to fix it for me. He's nothing short of incredible and so very humble and down to earth as a person. He is a wonderful human being and so very dedicated. I can not share enough positive words in review of this provider. Please take good care of him! :). Thank you!!!"
