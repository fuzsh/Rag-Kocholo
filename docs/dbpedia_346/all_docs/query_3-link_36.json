        "text": "Shahid Sheikh OBE is an entrepreneur and Director of Clifton Packaging Group Ltd (formed in 1981) which today proudly stands amongst the best in the world of flexible packing, supplying mainly the FMCG food industry with a turnover of over Â£35 million.\n\nShahid has been at the forefront of being a champion to represent and contribute his time and energy in support of the business community, where there has often been a lack of representation, breaking barriers and helping others to progress in their confidence and skills. He was the first Asian Chairman of the Leicestershire IoD (Institute of Directors) and the first Asian to be appointed onto the Board of Directors in the history of Leicestershire County Cricket Club 2010/2013 and once again from 2019/2021. He was also the first Asian to win Entrepreneur of the Year in 2008 at the Leicestershire Business Awards. In addition he has also won Entrepreneur of the Year at the World Food Awards 2010 and Entrepreneur of the Year at the MSDUK awards 2016 and was recognised with an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2013 for his services to both businesses and charities.\n\nSince then, Shahid has continued to be recognised thorough a number of awards, most notably the Lifetime Achievement Award 2019 by the World Packing Organisation (WPO), his global body. This award is additionally special as he is the only person in the UK to have received this award as well as being the youngest in the world! With further accolades in November 2019, Clifton won the Packing Company of the Year at the prestigious UK Packing Awards.\n\nShahid's philanthropic contribution and drive to help others has seen him involved with many charities over the years such as Chairman of the Leicester 500 Round Table, Chairman of the Shahid Afridi Foundation UK and he is currently the Midlands Chapter Chairman of the British Asian Trust, led by King Charles III. Currently Shahid is also an Export Champion for the DiT (Department of Industry and Trade) and a Board Member at the Faculty of Business and Law at De Montfort University.\n\nShahid has always been passionate about supporting the next generation and has been involved in mentoring for many years. He also plays a big part in the world of sport most notably boxing, cricket and football, and has previously been a sports agent and involved in a business (Sports Corporation) selling tickets for all of Amir Khan's fights and was also behind the logo design of Deontay Wilder (former heavyweight boxing champion of the world). He was also involved in the setting up of a business in West Africa alongside Momo Sylla (former Celtic and LCFC player) and Didier Drogba (former Chelsea and Nigerian International)."
