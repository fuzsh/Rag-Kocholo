        "text": "TikTok Begins Removing Universal Music Publishing Songs: TikTok and Universal Music Group (UMG) are intensifying their royalty dispute, with UMG beginning to remove its published songs from TikTok. This action follows the expiration of their licensing agreement on January 31, expanding the conflict beyond UMG-owned or distributed recordings to include a broader range of music. The disagreement centers on renewal terms, with UMG seeking fair compensation for artists and songwriters, protection against AI's harmful effects, and user safety on TikTok. UMG's vast catalog includes notable artists like Adele, Justin Bieber, and Taylor Swift, making the impact significant. TikTok counters UMG's claims by emphasizing its efforts to reach artist-first agreements with other labels and publishers. The standoff shows no signs of an immediate resolution, reminiscent of past disputes between music labels and platforms. The outcome could have a considerable impact on music promotion and royalties within the influencer marketing industry, affecting how content creators leverage music for engagement on TikTok. üëâüèº Read the full story by clicking here: https://lnkd.in/gFxxHcQs #InfluencerMarketing #Influencer #TikTok\n\nUniversal Music Group (UMG) has made a move that shook up the music scene on TikTok back in January. They decided to remove songs written or co-written by UMG artists from the platform, adding a new twist to the ongoing battle over music rights. This meant that some of your favorite tracks might have been missing from your TikTok videos as the platform complied with UMG's request. While this decision affected a wide range of artists, not just those signed with UMG, there were still plenty of tunes to groove to on TikTok. As marketers, this situation teaches us a valuable lesson about the importance of diversifying our content strategies and being prepared for unexpected disruptions in our platforms and partnerships. Here are a few key takeaways: 1. Diversify Your Content: Don't rely solely on one platform or one type of content. Keep exploring new avenues to engage with your audience. 2. Stay Agile: Be ready to adapt to changes in the digital landscape. Things can shift quickly, so it's crucial to stay flexible and responsive. 3. Know Your Rights: Stay informed about copyright and licensing agreements to avoid surprises like this one. Understanding the legal landscape can help you navigate potential challenges more effectively. This incident underscores the need to explore various platforms and content types to engage audiences effectively. By staying agile and informed about legal landscapes, we can better prepare for and navigate unexpected disruptions, ensuring continued success in all of our marketing endeavors. #agilemarketing #brandmarkstudios #beagile\n\nWhy has Universal Music Group's catalog been removed from TikTok? Starting Febuary 1st, TikTok has removed Universal Music Group's catalog from its platform due to failed licensing talks between the two parties. The breakdown in negotiations occurred over three critical issues, according to UMG: ¬∑ Appropriate compensation for artists and songwriters ¬∑ Protection of human artists from the impact of AI ¬∑ Ensuring online safety for TikTok users. TikTok responded by stating that UMG prioritized greed over the interests of its artists and songwriters, asserting that the platform serves as a valuable promotional and discovery vehicle for talent. TikTok argued behind the scenes that it is not a music streaming platform and should not be licensed as such, pointing out that users cannot currently play full songs on the main TikTok platform. In an open letter, UMG accused TikTok of proposing significantly lower compensation rates for artists and songwriters compared to other major social platforms. UMG also raised concerns about TikTok allowing the platform to be flooded with AI-generated recordings and promoting AI music creation, potentially diluting the royalty pool for human artists. The dispute highlights the evolving landscape of digital platforms and the challenges in negotiating fair agreements between music rights holders and platforms like TikTok. The removal of UMG's extensive catalog, comprising approximately 3 million recorded music tracks and 4 million songs with UMG-represented publishing, is expected to have a significant impact on TikTok's music offerings. Some are saying this marks the end of music on Tiktok - do you agree? Read more into the situation here: https://lnkd.in/epzPZ3xe #musicindustry #music #musicbiz #musicnews #musicbusiness #tiktok #tiktoknews #universalmusicgroup #umg\n\nUniversal Music Group pulling songs from Tik Tok serves as a lesson to the public about contract negotiations. As a summary, UMG distributes music from different artists, including popular artist like Taylor Swift and Drake. In order for UMG to distribute music to TikTok, there has to be a contract between UMG and TikTok. In this case, it's a licensing agreement. With the current agreement between the two parties expiring and no agreement on extending it or creating a new agreement, negotiations fell through. As a result, when the current agreement expired, videos that contained music featuring UMG artists had no audio. This situation is showing the public what goes on behind the scenes to make platforms like TikTok work. For TikTok to function as it currently does, lots of contracts are negotiated and executed. If these contracts fall through, users can be adversely affected. My thoughts? UMG was banking on the sentiments of TikTok users to gain leverage in negotiations. If audio from users' videos were removed or if users were not able use music in their future videos, then TikTok would come back to the negotiation table and be more amenable to the terms that UMG desired. As an entertainment lawyer, I think this is a good tactic. What are your thoughts? #umg #tiktok #music #socialmedia #contracts https://lnkd.in/eWz3tvqA\n\nCertainly!ü•π Universal Music Group (UMG) is one of the world's largest music labels, representing numerous popular artists. In the past, UMG entered into a licensing agreement with TikTok, a popular social media platform for sharing short videos. This agreement allowed TikTok users to include UMG songs in their videos without infringing copyright laws. However, it has been reported that the licensing deal between UMG and TikTok is set to expire. UMG has now issued a warning that it will remove its songs from TikTok if a new agreement isn't reached. This means that TikTok users may no longer have access to UMG's vast catalog of music for their videos. The expiration of the licensing agreement and the potential removal of UMG songs could significantly impact the availability and popularity of music on TikTok. Both parties will likely engage in negotiations to determine if a new deal can be reached to avoid the removal of UMG songs from the platform. #tiktok #digitalmarketing\n\nüéµ With the incoming news regarding TikTok and UMG it will be very interesting how this year will look across the TikTok platform. üéß UMG are pulling their music from the TikTok, which I believe really adds to the music experience on the app. For TikTok users that have used artists music who are signed to UMG you will notice your videos being muted with copyright restrictions. TikTok during the pandemic played a huge role for discoverability for a lot of artists and it had a huge impact in making many songs hit the charts.But with the increase in AI on the app not protecting original music, this could be UMG's way of protecting their catalogue. So what does this mean for the music industry.. 1Ô∏è‚É£ Will marketers have to find new ways for people who hear new music? 2Ô∏è‚É£ Will artists have to find other ways to connect with their audiences? 3Ô∏è‚É£ Could music brand partnerships be a new way for new audiences to discover their music? 4Ô∏è‚É£ Will new artists want to sign with UMG? So many questions but definitely eager to know how other labels will respond to this. In a way it's made us think are we being too reliant on an one app to make hits. Surely, what other creative ways can artists and their teams do to create meaningful connections with their audiences? #musicindustry #tiktok #universalmusicgroup #brandpartnerships #musicpartnerships #musicmarketing #musicbusiness\n\nUniversal Music Group pulling their portfolio from TikTok is actually a good thing. üò≥ There has been a whole bunch of talk surrounding copyright and artists‚Äô rights ever since streaming music on YouTube was born in 2005. The conversations have only gotten more difficult and complicated since TikTok‚Äôs rise in popularity. Universal Music Group originally had a deal with TikTok, allowing music from their entire portfolio of artists to be available for use on TikTok, but have since been pulled from the app. While this is an absolute nightmare for Swifties all over the world, this might be an incredible opportunity for new artists to better circulate their music on TikTok. In the infancy of TikTok, new artists were popping up every day in the algorithm (hello, Olivia Rodrigo). While being able to hear all our favorite songs behind the latest trends has been great, what made TikTok so exciting was all of the new and remixed music that came out of it and was able to rise in popularity organically. While we‚Äôre pretty sad about losing so many great songs on the app, we are SO ready for a surge of creative new artists to rise from UMG‚Äôs ashes. üé∂ #umg #tiktok #thoughtleadership #genz #genzmarketing #agency #consulting\n\nAn informative analysis of the actions Universal has taken against TikTok. We are now just a few days away from March 1st, when additional 4 million songs will be removed from TikTok public library, if they do not reach a deal. They have already removed 3 million songs. The reason for these actions is to get paid more for music licensing. Universal is the globe's biggest music right holder. The unfortunate truth is that the biggest victims in these actions are emerging artists which have been growing momentum via TikTok. These actions also impact major artists like Taylor Swift, with her new release announced to be in April, the question is: how long can TikTok survive without music from the world's major artists? David Philp\n\nIf you opened your TikTok this morning and noticed that some of your videos were silent, here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ Many existing TikTok videos that feature UMG-published music have already had their audio muted. TikTok is motivated to do this because, now that UMG's licence agreement has expired. This means that every UMG song featured in a TikTok video may constitute a copyright violation On Tuesday, a day before its licencing contract with TikTok was set to expire, Universal published a fiery open letter accusing TikTok of providing inadequate payment for music and allowing its platform to be \"flooded with A.I.-generated recordings\" that diluted the royalty pool for real, human musicians. According to a TikTok source, the platform is not a music streaming platform and should not be licenced as such. Users on TikTok are unable to play whole songs and are limited to a maximum of 60 seconds of music in their videos. Does this mean that no music by UMG artists or songwriters can be heard in TikTok videos anymore? Well, not really. If you post on TikTok, you can choose music for your video from TikTok's song catalogue, which contains millions of tracks from record labels and independent artists who licence their music to TikTok for platform usage. That offering no longer includes UMG's catalogue. So say goodbye to finding your new favourite Drake lyric on TikTok. I'm more concerned about the musicians who are signed to the label but aren't marketed as much. TikTok viral challenges really played a major role in promoting their songs. But that‚Äôs just my opinion.
