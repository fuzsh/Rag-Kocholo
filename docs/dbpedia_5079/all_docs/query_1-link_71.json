        "text": "A livestreamed announcement involving Universal Music Group and Big Hit Entertainment last night, complete with the corporate big guns of both companies, may have raised thoughts of an acquisition or merger of some kind.\n\nNope. But the two companies are expanding their partnership considerably, including co-launching a new label in the US that will attempt to develop and break the next BTS.\n\nThe label will be a joint venture between Big Hit and UMG’s Geffen Records, operating out of Los Angeles. The new boy band will be chosen through an X Factor-style show launching in 2022 “with a major US media partner”.\n\nBig Hit will give the winning members (and any other artists signed to the new label) the full K-Pop training works, as well as handling the fan community side of things. Geffen will focus on the music production, marketing and distribution end.\n\nThe announcement came shortly after UMG invested in VenewLive, the livestreaming music platform created by KBYK Live, a joint venture between Big Hit and US firm Kiswe. It was used for BTS’s record-breaking paid livestream concerts in 2020, and will now be deployed by some of Universal’s global artists too.\n\nAn ever-closer relationship between the world’s biggest label group and the biggest player in K-Pop – which in turn has used its recent IPO as a springboard to invest in one of its biggest rivals, YG Entertainment, which is now also a co-investor in KBYK Live – is notable.\n\nWith Spotify now live in South Korea, and the likes of BTS and Blackpink having proven K-Pop’s global potential, we expect the partnerships and consolidation activity to only intensify this year, particularly as UMG’s rival majors mull their strategies.\n\nImage by _JStone / Shutterstock.com"
