Vanessa Freeman ‘The Time Is Coming’.\n\nNew label signing Lacuna Recordings reached #5 in the Beatport House releases chart with their first release.\n\nIf you want to start a record label we can support you from set up to worldwide music distribution.\n\nThe first step is branding your record label. You need a name that is unique and a logo that works well for marketing and digital distribution. Our branding team can assist you with this.\n\nNext, you need to have the necessary legal agreements in place with the artists you collaborate with, including backing artists, song writers and DJs. Again, we can draw up the necessary contracts and advise you on legal matters around this.\n\nIt’s a good idea to have your releases registered with PPL, so that you can collect royalties when your tracks are played in public or on the radio. As registered members of PPL this is something we can do for you very quickly, saving you a lot of administration.\n\nIf you want to succeed, you also need to have a label launch strategy in place. This is to ensure that you have enough releases to build some momentum for your label. Without one it can take much longer to develop a name for yourself. Our label services agents have advised dozens of labels on this, and can help you plan your release dates and work with you to develop a solid, attention-grabbing strategy that builds your label brand from the start.\n\nWhen it comes to releasing your first tracks, we submit them to all the major digital music distribution outlets online, including iTunes, Beatport, Shazam, Traxsource and Spotify. MN2S is an established brand in the music industry, known for working with respected labels, DJs and artists. This works in your favour when we deliver your releases, ensuring that your music is taken seriously.\n\nContact us to discuss launching a new record label.\n\nWe need you to submit your release to us at least three weeks ahead of the official release date. This gives us enough time to meet the deadlines set by the leading music streaming services and digital music distribution outlets. Without this three weeks’ lead time it will be far harder for us to secure any significant coverage for your release.\n\nWhen you send us the release, you should also send us a detailed summary of your promo campaign. This includes any biographies, articles, press releases, blogs and reviews, a list of radio plays, a list of your social media profiles and the number of followers you have for each, and any positive reactions from DJs or music journalists on social media. We will then package this information into the best format for each digital retailer.\n\nIf it’s at all possible, submit your release and promo materials to us sooner than three weeks before the release date. The more time we have to work with the information, the better.\n\nWe have a division that specializes in PR for label services. If you do need support in this area, let us know. We can manage the promotional campaign for the release on your behalf if required."
