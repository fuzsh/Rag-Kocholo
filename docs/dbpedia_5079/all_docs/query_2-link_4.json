        "text": "A new label, Magnolia Music Group, announced its launch on Wednesday (Feb. 23) with Platinum-selling country artist Randy Houser as its flagship artist.\n\nHeather Propper and Kimmie Trosdahl join the Magnolia Music Group team as Co-VPs of Radio Promotion; Emily Hoch signs on as Coordinator; and Kyleigh Roberts joins as Director of Content.\n\n“We are thrilled to have Heather and Kimmie onboard, as they personify the passion, experience, work ethic and talent that will position Magnolia to thrive,” shares Nick Hartley, Steadfast founder and manager for Houser. “The timing couldn’t be better for Magnolia to ramp up radio, streaming and visual roles as Randy gets ready to deliver the best music of his career, all while preparing for an aggressive touring schedule and roles in two major feature films due later this year.”\n\n“I couldn’t be more excited about the creation of Magnolia Music Group and feel like it’s time to be more present than ever,” shares Houser. “Magnolia’s commitment to artistry is very important to me and has been a cocoon of safety for me while writing and recording new music. I can’t wait to emerge and share what we’ve been creating!”\n\nPropper spent five years at KMLE/ Phoenix, followed by over a decade at Stoney Creek/BMG and Warner Music Nashville. Trosdahl was most recently with Warner Music Nashville, with prior stops at Wheelhouse/BMG and Bigger Picture, while Roberts’ previous stops include Roy Orbison’s Still Working Music Group.\n\nMagnolia will leverage data and new technologies as it positions itself for long-term sustainability across label, publishing and catalogue divisions. Magnolia will be distributed by Empire and utilize Thinkswell’s marketing services.\n\nMagnolia is currently hiring additional positions in radio, streaming and visual departments, with new team members to be announced soon."
