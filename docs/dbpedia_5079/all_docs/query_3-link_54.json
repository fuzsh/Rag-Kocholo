        "text": "Registering Multiple Works with the Same Application\n\nWhat is group registration of works published on an album of music?\n\nThe Copyright Office created two group registration options for works that were published on the same album of music:\n\nThe Copyright Office created a group registration option for musical works that were published on the same album. This option may be used to register up to twenty musical works with the application titled “Musical Works from an Album.”\n\nThe Office also created a separate group registration option for sound recordings that were published on the same album. This option may be used to register up to twenty sound recordings with the application titled “Sound Recordings from an Album.” It also may be used to register any photographs, artwork, or liner notes that were first published with the album.\n\nImportant: Groups of musical works and sound recordings must be registered separately. The Copyright Office will refuse to register works submitted using the wrong group registration application.\n\nMusical works (with or without lyrics): If you want to register musical works (with or without lyrics), you must submit the online application for “Musical Works from an Album.” This application can only be used to register musical works (with or without lyrics). It cannot be used to register sound recordings or any photographs, artwork, or liner notes that were published on the same album.\n\nSound recordings: If you want to register sound recordings, you must submit the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album.” This application may be used to register sound recordings, as well as any photographs, artwork, or liner notes that were first published on the same album. But it cannot be used to register musical works (with or without lyrics).\n\nWhat does “GRAM” stand for?\n\n“GRAM” is shorthand for “group registration of works on an album of music.”\n\nHow do I register musical works (with or without lyrics) with the same application?\n\nYou may register up to twenty musical works (with or without lyrics) by (1) completing the online application for Musical Works from an Album,” (2) paying the nonrefundable filing fee, and (3) submitting separate audio files that contain a complete copy of each musical work.\n\nHow do I register sound recordings with the same application?\n\nYou may register up to twenty sound recordings by (1) completing the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album,” (2) paying the nonrefundable filing fee, and (3) submitting separate audio files that contain a complete copy of each sound recording.\n\nCan I register a work that was previously published as a single before it was published on the album?\n\nYes.\n\nA musical work or a sound recording that was previously published as an individual work (such as a single) before it was published on the album may be included in the claim if certain requirements have been met.\n\nSpecifically, you must provide the following information in the “Note to Copyright Office” field:\n\nThe title of the single;\n\nThe complete date (MM/DD/YYYY) the single was first published; and\n\nA brief statement confirming that the work embodied in the single is the same as the work embodied in the album.\n\nExample:\n\nTrack Title Album Track Number Album Publication Date Single Publication Date Nation of First Publication Mercury 1 6/1/2021 USA Venus 2 6/1/2021 USA Earth 3 6/1/2021 USA Mars 4 6/1/2021 3/1/2021 USA Jupiter 5 6/1/2021 2/1/2021 Canada\n\nTracks 1 through 5 were published on the album Solar System on 6/1/2021. In addition, Tracks 4 and 5 were separately published as singles:\n\n“Mars” was first published in the United States on 3/1/2021.\n\n“Jupiter” was first published in Canada on 2/1/2021.\n\nTracks 1, 2, 3, and 4 may be registered with the group registration application. To register Track 4 (“Mars”), the applicant must include the following statement in the “Note to Copyright Office” field:\n\n“Mars was first published as a single on 3/1/2021. The previously published track is identical to the track published on the album Solar System.”\n\nBy contrast, Track 5 (“Jupiter”) cannot be included in the group registration application, because that single was first published in a different country than rest of the works in the group. To register Track 5, the applicant should submit a separate application, deposit, and fee for that work using the Standard Application (NOT the group registration application).\n\nHow do I register photographs, artwork, or liner notes with the same application?\n\nYou may register two or more sound recordings and any photographs, artwork, or liner notes that were first published on the same album by (1) completing the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album,”(2) paying the nonrefundable filing fee, and (3) submitting a complete copy of the sound recordings, photographs, artwork, or liner notes being registered.\n\nNote: To register photographs, artwork, or liner notes you must submit at least two sound recordings with your claim. The application for Sound Recordings from an Album cannot be used to register photographs, artwork, or liner notes by themselves.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a “musical work” and a “sound recording”?\n\nA “musical work” consists of the musical composition (melody, rhythm, and/or harmony) and any accompanying words (lyrics). A recording of a particular performance of a musical work is a “sound recording.”\n\nFor example, Otis Redding’s song “Respect” and a recording of Aretha Franklin singing “Respect” are two distinct works. The song itself (i.e., the music and lyrics) is a musical work, and a recording of an artist performing that song is a sound recording.\n\nIf you want to register a group of musical work (with or without lyrics) you must use the online application for “Musical Works from an Album.”\n\nIf you want to register a group of sound recording (such as the performance and/or production authorship contained within a particular recording) you must use the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album.”\n\nFor more information about the differences between a musical work and a sound recording, see Musical Compositions and Sound Recordings Circular 56A.\n\nCan I register a musical work (with or without lyrics) and sound recordings with the same group registration application?\n\nNo. Musical works (with or without lyrics)—and sound recordings—must be registered using separate applications.\n\nTo register musical works (with or without lyrics), you must submit the online application for “Musical Works from an Album.” This application can only be used to register musical works (with or without lyrics). It cannot be used to register sound recordings.\n\nTo register sound recordings, you must submit the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album.” You may register two or more sound recordings with this application. This application may also be used to register photographs, artwork, or liner notes that were first published on the same album. But the application for “Sound Recordings from an Album” cannot be used to register musical works (with or without lyrics).\n\nCan I register musical works (with or without lyrics), photographs, artwork, and liner notes with the same application?\n\nNo. Photographs, artwork, and liner notes can only be registered with the application for Sound Recordings from an Album.\n\nTo register musical works (with or without lyrics), you must submit the online application for “Musical Works from an Album.” This application can only be used to register musical works (with or without lyrics). It cannot be used to register photographs, artwork, or liner notes.\n\nWhere can I learn about this group registration option?\n\nThere are multiple ways to learn about group registration of works published on the same album. In addition to this FAQ, the Office offers an introductory circular, video tutorials, and a recording of our webinar.\n\nFor specific questions, you can call the Public Information Office at (202) 707-3000 or 1-877-476-0778 (toll free), or you can send us an email at [email protected].\n\nWhen did this change go into effect?\n\nMarch 26, 2021\n\nWhen was this change announced?\n\nThe new rule was published in the Federal Register on February 23, 2021.\n\nApplication Form\n\nDo I need to submit my claim through the electronic registration system?\n\nYes, you must submit your claim through the Copyright Office’s Electronic Copyright Office (eCO) system, which is available here.\n\nWhere do I find information about the online registration system?\n\nFor information on how to access the Electronic Copyright Office (eCO) system, go to copyright.gov/eco/faq.html\n\nWhere do I find the online application for “Musical Works from an Album”?\n\nLog into your eCO account here.\n\nClick the link for “Register Certain Groups of Published Works” under the heading “Other Registration Options” on the left side of the home screen. Then select “Musical Works from an Album” from the drop-down menu on the “Type of Group” screen.\n\nClick here if you need help finding these links.\n\nWhere do I find the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album”?\n\nLog into your eCO account here.\n\nClick the link for “Register Certain Groups of Published Works” under the heading “Other Registration Options” on the left side of the home screen. Then select “Sound Recordings from an Album” from the drop-down menu on the “Type of Group” screen.\n\nClick here if you need help finding these links.\n\nWhat if I need help completing the online application?\n\nThe Copyright Office offers a series of videos that provide step-by-step instructions for completing the online application for “Musical Works from an Album” and the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album.”\n\nThe help text for the online application for “Musical Works from an Album” and the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album” provides detailed instructions on how to complete each section of the application.\n\nFor additional information, see our circular or call the Public Information Office at (202) 707-3000 or 1-877-476-0778 (toll free).\n\nCan I register two or more musical works or sound recordings under the group registration option by using a paper application?\n\nNo. If you want to use the group registration options for musical works or sound recordings that were published on the same album, you must submit your claim through the online registration system using one of the options described in these FAQs. DO NOT use a paper application, such as Form PA or Form SR.\n\nNumber of Works\n\nHow many works can I submit with this group registration option?\n\nYou may submit at least two but no more than twenty musical works with the online application for “Musical Works from an Album.”\n\nYou may submit at least two but no more than twenty sound recordings with the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album.” You may also submit any photographs, artwork, or liner notes that were first published on the same album.\n\nCan I submit more than twenty musical works or more than twenty sound recordings with the same application?\n\nNo.\n\nIs there a limit on the number of photographs, artwork, or liner notes that can be submitted with the same application?\n\nThere is no limit on the number of photographs, artwork, or liner notes that may be registered with GRAM. But all of the works must be submitted with the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album,” and you must include at least two sound recordings with your claim. Additionally, the photographs, artwork, or liner notes must be first published on the same album and on the same date, they must have the same author or a common joint author, and the copyright claimant or co-claimants for each work must all be the same person(s) or organization. You cannot submit photographs, artwork, or liner notes by themselves.\n\nAuthor Information\n\nWho is the author of a musical work?\n\nThe author of a musical work is the person who created the musical composition (melody, rhythm, and/or harmony) and/or lyrics, such as a composer, lyricist, or songwriter.\n\nWho is the author of a sound recording?\n\nThe author of a sound recording can be the performer featured in the recording and/or the producer who captured, manipulated, or edited the sounds that appear in the final recording.\n\nCan I register a “work made for hire” with this option?\n\nYes. A work that was created as a “work made for hire” may be included in a group registration if it is identified as such in the application.\n\nThe Office has developed a questionnaire that may be useful in determining whether a particular work qualifies as a “work made for hire.” To complete the questionnaire and to read more information about this topic, see Works Made for Hire (Circular 30).\n\nDo I need to identify all of the authors of the works being registered?\n\nYes.\n\nIf the works were created by one author, you should identify that author in the application.\n\nIf the works were created by two or more co-authors, you should identify all the co-authors in the application.\n\nDo the works need to be created by the same author?\n\nAll works included in the group must be created by the same author or the works must have a common joint author. This requirement may be satisfied if all of the works were created by one author. If the works were created by two or more authors, then one of the authors must have contributed copyrightable authorship to each and every work in being registered the group.\n\nNote: The other registration requirements must also be met, including the requirement that the copyright claimant or co-claimants for each work must be the same person(s) or organization.\n\nCan I register works with multiple co-authors?\n\nYou may be able to register works created by two or more authors. To do so, there must be a common joint author for every work being registered in the group.\n\nThe “common author” requirement may be satisfied if the works were created by identical co-authors.\n\nThis requirement may also be satisfied if each work was co-created by the same co-author. In other words, at least one of the co-authors must have contributed copyrightable authorship to each and every work in the group being registered.\n\nNote: The other registration requirements must also be met, including the requirement that the copyright claimant or co-claimants for each work must be the same person(s) or organization.\n\nExample:\n\nTrack Authors 1 A & B 2 A & B 3 A & B\n\nTracks 1, 2, and 3 have a common joint author, because each work was created by the same co-authors (A & B).\n\nExample:\n\nTrack Authors 4 A & B 5 A & C 6 A & D\n\nTracks 4, 5, and 6 have a common joint author, because A is the co-author of each work—even though A co-created these works with a different co-author (B, C, D).\n\nExample:\n\nTrack Authors 7 A & B 8 A & C 9 D & E\n\nTracks 7 and 8 have a common joint author, because A is the co-author of those works—even though A co-created Tracks 7 and 8 with a different co-author (B, C).\n\nBy contrast, Track 9 doesn’t have a common joint author, because the authors of that work (D & E) did not create Tracks 7 or 8. Likewise, A did not co-create Track 9 and therefore is not a common joint author for that work.\n\nI want to register some photographs, artwork, and liner notes, along with my sound recordings. Do the authors of the works need to be the same?\n\nYou may register two or more sound recordings and any photographs, artwork, or liner notes that were first published on the same album. To do so, the works must have been created by the same author or there must be a common joint author for all of the works being registered.\n\nThe common joint author requirement may be satisfied if the sound recordings and the accompanying material were created by the same author.\n\nThis requirement may also be satisfied if at least one of the joint authors contributed copyrightable authorship to each and every work in the group being registered.\n\nNote: The other registration requirements must also be met, including the requirement that the copyright claimant or co-claimants for each work must be the same person(s) or organization.\n\nExample:\n\nWorks Author Sound Recording (Track 1) Record Label A Sound Recording (Track 2) Record Label A Photograph Record Label A Artwork Record Label A\n\nThese works have a common joint author, because every work was created by the same organization (Record Label A).\n\nExample:\n\nWorks Authors Sound Recording (Track 3) Performer A\n\nPerformer B Sound Recording (Track 4) Performer A\n\nPerformer B Artwork Performer A Liner Notes Performer A\n\nThese works have a common joint author, because Performer A is the author or co-author of each and every work—even though Performer A co-created Tracks 3 and 4 with Performer B).\n\nExample:\n\nWorks Authors Sound Recording (Track 5) Record Label A Sound Recording (Track 6) Record Label A Liner Notes Record Label A Photographs Photographer E\n\nThe sound recordings and liner notes have a common joint author because they were created by the same author, Record Label A, but Record Label A did not create any of the photographs.\n\nThe photographs can’t be included in the claim, because the author of the photographs (Photographer E) is not the author or co-author of the sound recordings or the liner notes.\n\nClaimant Information\n\nWho is the copyright claimant?\n\nThe copyright claimant may either be (1) the author of all of the works in the group being registered, or (2) a person or organization that has obtained ownership of all of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author of all of the works in the group being registered.\n\nDo all of the works need to have the same claimant?\n\nYes. The copyright claimant or co-claimants for each work listed in the application must all be the same person(s) or the same organization.\n\nThe copyright claimant may either be (1) the author of all of the works in the group being registered, or (2) a person or organization that has obtained ownership of all of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author of all of the works in the group being registered.\n\nIf you plan to name an author as the claimant then all of the works being registered must be created by the same author or a unifying author.\n\nIf you plan to name a third party as claimant (such as a music publisher or record label), that party must have obtained ownership of all rights of the exclusive rights under the copyright initially belonging to an author of all of the works being registered. And you must provide a transfer statement that explains how that party obtained ownership of all the exclusive rights.\n\nI want to name the authors as the copyright claimants. Can I do that?\n\nAn author may be named as the copyright claimant, but all of the works in the group must be created by the same author, or the works must have a common joint author, and the copyright claimant or co-claimants for each work must all be the same person(s) or organization.\n\nI want to name a third party as the copyright claimant, such as a music publisher or record label. Can I do that?\n\nA third party may be named as the copyright claimant if that party owns all of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author of all of the works in the group being registered. A third party that obtained all of the exclusive rights from a co-author of all of the works being registered may be listed as claimant, even if the third party has not received rights from the other co-authors of those works.\n\nA party that owns one or more—but less than all—of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author of all of the works in the group being registered cannot be named as a claimant.\n\nIf you plan to name a third party as the copyright claimant, you should only list the works that are owned by that third party. If the third party does not own all of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author of a work in the group being registered, you should not list that work in the application.\n\nExample:\n\nTracks Authors Owner of All of the Authors’ Exclusive Rights 1 A & B Publisher X 2 A & C Publisher X\n\nA and B created Track 1. A and C created Track 2. A, B, and C transferred all of their exclusive rights to Publisher X by written agreement. Tracks 1 and 2 may be registered with the same application, naming Publisher X as the claimant for those works.\n\nExample:\n\nTracks Authors Owner of 50 percent of the Authors’ Publishing Rights Owner of All Other Exclusive Rights 1 D & E Publisher Y D & E 2 D & E Publisher Y D & E\n\nD and E created Tracks 1 and 2. Both authors transferred 50 percent of their publishing rights to Publisher Y. The authors retained the rest of their exclusive rights. Tracks 1 and 2 may be registered with the same application, naming authors D and/or E as the claimants for the works. Publisher Y cannot be named as a claimant, because the publisher owns some—but not all—of the exclusive rights in those works.\n\nA third party may be named as the copyright claimant if that party owns all of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author of all of the works in the group being registered. What are the “exclusive rights” that must be fully owned by the third party?\n\nThe Copyright Act provides authors with the exclusive rights listed below.\n\nA third party (such as a music publisher or record label) may be named as the copyright claimant if that party owns all of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author of all of the works being registered. If a third party owns some—but not all—of these rights, that party cannot be a copyright claimant.\n\n(1) The exclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords.\n\n(2) The exclusive right to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.\n\n(3) The exclusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending.\n\n(4) The exclusive right to publicly perform the following types of copyrighted works: musical works or literary works.\n\n(5) The exclusive right to publicly display the following types of copyrighted works: musical works, literary works, pictorial works, or graphic works.\n\n(6) The exclusive right to publicly perform the following type of work by means of a digital audio transmission: sound recordings.\n\nThe author transferred their right to reproduce and distribute the work to a third party (such as a music publisher or record label). The author retained the remainder of the exclusive rights in their work. Can the third party be named as a copyright claimant?\n\nA third party may only be named as the copyright claimant if that party owns all of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author of all of the works in the group being registered.\n\nA party that owns one or more—but less than all—of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author of all of the works in the group being registered cannot be named as a claimant.\n\nThe author transferred 50 percent of their distribution rights to a third party (such as a music publisher or record label). The author retained the rest of the distribution rights in their works. Can the third party be named as a copyright claimant?\n\nNo. In this situation, the author may be named as the copyright claimant. The third party cannot be listed as a claimant.\n\nA third party may only be named as the copyright claimant if that party owns all of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author of all of the works being registered.\n\nA party that owns less than 100 percent of the author’s exclusive rights in a work being registered cannot be named as a claimant.\n\nThe author transferred their exclusive rights to a third party (such as a music publisher or record label). Can the author still be named as the copyright claimant?\n\nYes. An author may be named as the copyright claimant if all of their rights in the works being registered were transferred to another party.\n\nExample:\n\nTracks Author Owner of All of the Author’s Exclusive Rights 1 A Publisher X 2 A Publisher X 3 A Publisher X\n\nA created Tracks 1, 2, and 3. A transferred all of their exclusive rights to Publisher X by written agreement.\n\nA may be named as the copyright claimant, even though the author does not own any of the exclusive rights in this work. Alternatively, Publisher X may be named as the claimant, because the publisher owns all of the exclusive rights in all of the works being registered.\n\nExample:\n\nTracks Author Owner of All of the Author’s Exclusive Rights 4 A & B Publisher X 5 A & B Publisher Y\n\nA & B created Tracks 4 and 5. The authors transferred all of their exclusive rights in Track 4 to Publisher X. And they transferred all of their exclusive rights in Track 5 to Publisher Y.\n\nTracks 4 and 5 may be registered with the group registration application. To do so, A and/or B must be named as the copyright claimant for each work (even though the authors don’t own any of the exclusive rights in this work).\n\nPublishers X and Y cannot be named in the group registration application, because they do not own all of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author in all of the works being registered.\n\nIf the publishers want to be named as the copyright claimant, the applicant must submit a separate application, deposit, and fee for each work and must submit the claim with the Standard Application (NOT the group registration application).\n\nThe author transferred some—but not all—of their exclusive rights to a third party (such as a music publisher or record label). I want to include the copyright owner’s name in the registration record. Can I do that?\n\nA third party may be named as the copyright claimant in a group registration application if that party owns all of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author of all of the works being registered.\n\nIf a third party owns one or more—but less than all—of the exclusive rights initially belonging to an author of a work being registered, that party cannot be named as a claimant in a group registration application. However, you may record the document that transferred the exclusive rights to that party. For information about recordation, see “Recordation of Transfers and Other Documents,” copyright.gov/recordation/documents/.\n\nPublication Information\n\nCan I register published and unpublished works with the same application?\n\nNo. Every work you submit must be published. And generally, all of the works must be first published on the same album on the same date.\n\nNote: There is a limited exception to this rule. A musical work or sound recording that was previously published as an individual work (such as a single) before it was published on the album may be included in the claim if certain requirements are met.\n\nCan I register musical works or sound recordings that were published on different dates?\n\nAs a general rule, all of the works being registered must be first published on the same album on the same date.\n\nThere is a limited exception to this rule. A musical work or a sound recording that was previously published as an individual work (such as a single) may be included in the claim if certain requirements are met. The previously published work must be expressly claimed in the “Note to Copyright Office” section of the application, by including the title of the work, the complete date (MM/DD/YYYY) that the work was first published, and a brief statement confirming that the previously published track is exactly the same as the track published on the album.\n\nCan I register photographs, artwork, or liner notes that were published on different dates?\n\nNo.\n\nAll of the photographs, artwork, and liner notes must be first published on the same album and on the same date. DO NOT include any photographs, artwork, or liner notes works that were previously published before they were released on the album.\n\nTitles of the Works\n\nDo I need to provide a title for each musical work and each sound recording?\n\nYes.\n\nYou must provide a title for each musical work that you submit with the online application for “Musical Works from an Album.”\n\nLikewise, you must provide a title for each sound recording that you submit with the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album.”\n\nDo I need to provide a track number for each work?\n\nYes. You must identify the track number that was assigned to each work when it was published on the album.\n\nI want to register the photographs, artwork, and liner notes that were first published on the album. How do I provide a title for this material?\n\nIf you submit the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album,” you may include photographs, artwork, or liner notes that were first published on the same album, but you do not need to provide a title for those works. A “generic” title will be automatically added to your application. The generic title will consist of the phrase “[Photos/Artwork/Liner notes] first published on the album” followed by the album title.\n\nIf you prefer to provide a specific title for these types of works, consult the help text for the online applications for “Sound Recordings from an Album.”\n\nIf I upload a copy of my musical works or sound recordings, do the file names need to match the titles listed in the application?\n\nYes. The file name for each musical work or each sound recording that you upload must match the corresponding title listed in the application. The file name should also include the track number that was assigned to each work when it was published on the album.\n\nFor example, if you want to register three works titled “The Birthday Party,” “The Wedding Party,” and “The Dinner Party,” and if those works were released on the same album as Track numbers 2, 4, and 6, the files you upload to the electronic registration system should be named “02thebirthdayparty.mp3,” “04theweddingparty.mp3,” and “06thedinnerparty.mp3.”\n\nNote: If you are registering sound recordings that were published in a physical format (such as a compact disc or vinyl record), you must submit physical copies of the album instead of uploading digital files. Read more.\n\nI plan to upload a copy of my photographs, artwork, and liner notes to the electronic registration system. Does the file name for each work need to match the titles listed in the application?\n\nIf you submit the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album,” you may include photographs, artwork, or liner notes that were first published on the same album. However, you don’t need to provide a title for those works. A “generic” title will be automatically added to your application. The generic title will consist of the phrase “[Photos/Artwork/Liner notes] first published on the album” followed by the album title.\n\nThe file name for the photographs, artwork, or liner notes should identify the type of work you plan to submit. For example, if you plan to register a photograph, the word “photo” should be included in the file name. If you plan to register artwork, the word “artwork” should be included in the file name.\n\nIf you plan to submit multiple items then the file name for each work should be appropriately labeled and numbered to distinguish them from each other, such as “photo 1,” “photo 2,” “photo 3,” “artwork 1,” “artwork 2,” “artwork 3,” and so on.\n\nCan I register “hidden tracks” that were published on the same album? How do I provide titles for these works?\n\nYes. For instructions on how to register works released on “hidden tracks,” consult the help text for the online applications for “Musical Works from an Album” and “Sound Recordings from an Album.”\n\nDo I need to provide the title of the album?\n\nYes.\n\nDo I need to identify the record label that released the album?\n\nYou are encouraged to include this information in the application, but it is not required for registration.\n\nDo I need to provide the cataloging number that was assigned to the album by the record label?\n\nYou are encouraged to include this information in the application, but it is not required for registration.\n\nDo I need to provide a title for the group as a whole?\n\nNo. A group title will be automatically added to your application. The group title will consist of the phrase “Works published on the album [Album Title].”\n\nFor example, if your songs were released on the album “Solar System,” the group title will be “Works published on the album Solar System.”\n\nCan I provide a title for my “collection” of works?\n\nNo.\n\nDO NOT provide a “collection” title in the application. If you provide a “collection” title, the Copyright Office will remove that title from the record.\n\nA title for the entire group will be added automatically to your application. The group title will consist of the phrase “Works published on the album [Album Title].”\n\nA “group title\" was automatically assigned to my claim. Can I change this title?\n\nNo.\n\nThe “group title” that will be assigned to these claims will consist of the phrase “Works published on the album [Album Title].” The same format will be used for every GRAM registration to facilitate searches of the Office’s public records.\n\nSubmitting the Works to the Copyright Office\n\nCan I upload an electronic copy of my works?\n\nWhether you can upload your works will depend on what you are registering and how it was published.\n\nIf you are registering a group of musical works (with or without lyrics), you are strongly encouraged to upload separate audio files that contain a digital copy of each work being registered (regardless of whether the album was distributed in a digital or physical format).\n\nIf you are registering sound recordings, and if the album was distributed solely in a digital format and not distributed in a physical form (such as compact disc, vinyl record, etc.), then you may upload separate audio files that contain a digital copy of each recording that you want to register. You may also upload a digital copy of any photographs, artwork, or liner notes that are being registered.\n\nIf you are registering sound recordings first published in the United States, and if the album was distributed in a physical format (such as compact disc, vinyl record, etc.), you must send two physical copies of the best edition of the entire album, including any printed or visually perceptible material that was distributed with the album (such as photographs, artwork, or liner notes appearing on the album cover).\n\nIf you are registering sound recordings, and if the album was first published in a physical format outside the United States (but was not published in the United States), then you must send one physical copy of the album as published in the foreign country, including any printed or visually perceptible material that was distributed with the album (such as photographs, artwork, or liner notes appearing on the album cover). If the album was first published in a foreign country and later published in the United States, you may send one copy of the album that was first published in the foreign country or one copy of the best edition that was published in the United States.\n\nI plan to upload a copy of my musical works or sound recordings. Does the file name for each work need to match the titles listed in the application?\n\nYes.\n\nWhen you complete the application you must provide the title and track number for each musical work or each sound recording that you want to register. If you upload a digital copy of each work, the name assigned to each digital file must match the corresponding titles that you listed in the application. The file name should also include the track number that was assigned to each work when it was published on the album.\n\nFor example, if you want to register three works titled “The Birthday Party,” “The Wedding Party,” and “The Dinner Party,” and if those works were released on the same album as Track numbers 2, 4, and 6, the files you upload to the electronic registration system should be named “02thebirthdayparty.mp3,” “04theweddingparty.mp3,” and “06thedinnerparty.mp3.”\n\nI plan to upload a digital copy of my works to the electronic registration system. Can I submit all the works in one electronic file?\n\nNo. Each work must be uploaded to the electronic registration system in a separate electronic file. DO NOT submit all your works in the same electronic file (such as a .ZIP file or a single MP3 file).\n\nDo I need to submit a physical copy of my works?\n\nWhether you can upload your works will depend on what you are registering and how it was published.\n\nIf you are registering musical works (with or without lyrics), you are strongly encouraged to upload separate audio files that contain a digital copy of each work being registered (regardless of whether the album was distributed in a digital or physical format). You do not need to send a physical copy of your works.\n\nIf you are registering sound recordings, and if the album was distributed solely in a digital format and not distributed in a physical form (such as a compact disc, vinyl record, etc.), then you may upload separate audio files that contain a digital copy of each recording that you want to register. You may also upload a digital copy of any photographs, artwork, or liner notes that are being registered.\n\nIf you are registering sound recordings first published in the United States, and if the album was distributed in a physical format (such as compact disc, vinyl record, etc.), you must send two physical copies of the best edition of the entire album, including any printed or visually perceptible material that was distributed with the album (such as photographs, artwork, or liner notes appearing on the album cover).\n\nIf you are registering sound recordings, and if the album was distributed in a physical format in a foreign country (but was not distributed in the United States), then you must send one physical copy of the album that was first published in the foreign country, including any printed or visually perceptible material that was distributed with the album (such as photographs, artwork, or liner notes appearing on the album cover). If the album was first published in a foreign country and later published in the United States, you may send one copy of the album that was first published overseas or one copy of the best edition that was published in this country.\n\nDo I just need to submit a copy of the works that I’m registering? Or do I need to submit all of the tracks that were published on the album?\n\nIf you are registering musical works (with or without lyrics), you are strongly encouraged to submit separate audio files that contain a copy of each musical work being registered. You do not need to submit a copy of the entire album.\n\nIf you are registering sound recordings, and if the album was distributed solely in a digital format and not distributed in a physical form (such as a compact disc, vinyl record, etc.), then you may upload separate audio files that contain a digital copy of each recording that you want to register. You may also upload a digital copy of any photographs, artwork, or liner notes that are being registered. You do not need to submit a copy of the entire album.\n\nIf you are registering sound recordings first published in the United States, and if the album was distributed in a physical format (such as compact disc, vinyl record, etc.), you must send two physical copies of the best edition of the entire album, including any printed or visually perceptible material that was distributed with the album (such as photographs, artwork, or liner notes appearing on the album cover).\n\nIf you are registering sound recordings, and if the album was distributed in a physical format in a foreign country (but was not distributed in the United States), then you must send one physical copy of the entire album that was first published in the foreign country, including any printed or visually perceptible material that was distributed with the album (such as photographs, artwork, or liner notes appearing on the album cover). If the album was first published in a foreign country and later published in the United States, you may send one copy of the album that was first published in the foreign country or one copy of the best edition that was published in the United States.\n\nOne of my works was first published as a single before it was published on the album. Do I need to submit a copy of both the single and the album?\n\nNo.\n\nA musical work or a sound recording that was previously published as an individual work (such as a single) before it was published on the album may be included in the claim if certain requirements are met.\n\nIn all cases, you must submit a copy of the track that was published on the album. DO NOT submit a separate copy of the single.\n\nWhere do I find information about how to upload my works?\n\nThe Copyright Office created a video that provides step-by-step instructions for uploading your works to the electronic registration system.\n\nThe help text for the online application for “Musical Works from an Album” and the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album” provides detailed instructions on how to submit your works.\n\nYou can also call the Public Information Office, at (202) 707-3000 or 1-877-476-0778 (toll-free).\n\nDo I need to upload my works in a particular format?\n\nIf you upload your works to the electronic registration system, each work must be submitted in an acceptable file format. A list of acceptable formats is posted on the Office’s website.\n\nAll of files must be uploaded as individual electronic files. DO NOT upload your works in a .ZIP file.\n\nI need to submit a physical copy of my works. Where do I find information about how to do that?\n\nThe Copyright Office created a video that provides step-by-step instructions on how to send physical copies.\n\nThe help text for the online application for “Musical Works from an Album” and the online application for “Sound Recordings from an Album” provides detailed instructions on how to submit your works.\n\nYou can also call the Public Information Office, at (202) 707-3000 or 1-877-476-0778 (toll-free).\n\nDo I need to submit a lyric sheet for each work?\n\nNo. DO NOT submit a separate document containing the lyrics for each work being registered. If you are registering musical works (with or without lyrics), you must submit a separate audio recording of each work (regardless of whether the album was distributed in a digital or physical format).\n\nRegistering an Album as a Collective Work\n\nCan I use the group registration application to register a claim in an entire album as a collective work?\n\nNo. The group registration option is for registering individual works contained on the album. You may register an entire album with the Standard Application and filing fee if the album qualifies as a “collective work.”\n\nIf you want to register an album as a collective work, you must use the Standard Application, pay the nonrefundable filing fee, and submit the appropriate deposit copy of the entire album. DO NOT use the group registration application for “Musical Works from the Same Album” or “Sound Recordings from the Same Album.”\n\nWhat is a collective work?\n\nA “collective work” is a type of compilation that contains “a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves” that have been “assembled into a collective whole.”\n\nAn album may be registered as a collective work if it contains a sufficient number of contributions and if there is a sufficient amount of creativity in the selection, coordination, or arrangement of those contributions. The component contributions may be included in the registration if certain requirements are met.\n\nDoes a collective work registration cover the musical works and/or sound recordings that are included within the album?\n\nA collective work registration may cover the musical works and/or sound recordings that are included within that album if the following requirements have been met:\n\nFirst, each individual work must contain a sufficient amount of original authorship.
