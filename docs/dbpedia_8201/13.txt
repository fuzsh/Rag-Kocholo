2022: Revenue growth of 11.4% to €46.39 billion; loss - 700 million euros

Renault Group's revenue reached €46.39 billion in 2022, up 11.4% from a year earlier. The company made a net loss of 700 million euros, while in 2021 there was a net profit of 967 million euros. The French automaker published its reports on February 16, 2023. The loss is caused by a write-off of 1.36 billion euros, reflected in the first financial half of the year due to the termination of operations in Russia, the group said.

The losses incurred are quite sensitive even for such a large automaker as Renault Group, experts say. According to Sergei Burgazliev, an independent consultant for the automotive industry, it will be very difficult for the company to compensate for them in a short time. For example, the creation of a full-fledged automobile plant with stamping, with a capacity of 200-250 thousand cars per year, costs about €1 billion, the expert said in a conversation with Izvestia.

For Renault, the loss of AvtoVAZ is very sensitive. In addition to the fact that Lada models are the most popular cars on the Russian market, they are also high-margin. Lada Granta and Lada Largus were among the most profitable models in the Renault Group portfolio. It will be very problematic to compensate for their loss, "says Sergei Burgazliev.

According to Renault materials, in 2022, sales of the group's cars amounted to 43.12 billion euros, which is 11.4% higher than a year ago. Excluding currency fluctuations (first of all, we are talking about the devaluation of the Turkish lira and the Argentine peso), the growth was 12.6%. Net debt of the group's automotive division decreased by 0.5 billion euros - from 1.6 billion to 1.1 billion euros by the end of December 2022.
