Renault, the Paris based automobile industry player today joined the OpenAirInterface Software Alliance.

The Alliance is pleased to have recently been increasing its member base in new industries and new technology areas. Seeing a prestigious French car industry giant place its trust in the OAI as a test and prototyping tool is further proof of OAI being a relevant platform. Renault joining the OSA is a manifestation of change for many industries as they prepare to manage increased cellular connectivity needs.

Even though the automotive industry players are initially expected be mere transport data users of 5G, we believe they need to develop expertise particularly in the 5G and IoT arena. This is fundamentally due to the reasons of acquiring the capability to test future automotive communication requirements. We believe these capabilities to be especially relevant as the vehicular world races forward towards more and more connected and autonomous vehicles.
