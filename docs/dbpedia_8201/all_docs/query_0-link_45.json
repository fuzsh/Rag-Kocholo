        "text": "Climate Policy Engagement Overview: Renault Group appears to have both negative and positive engagement on climate change policy globally in 2022-24. While the company has broadly positive top-line messaging on climate policy, it appears to have advocated to delay the EU's 2035 zero-emissions CO2 target to promote a longer-term role of internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered hybrid vehicles.\n\nTop-line Messaging on Climate Policy: Renault has limited top-line communications on climate policy. In its 2023 Universal Registration Document, published in May 2024, Renault used the Paris Agreement as a benchmark for its own GHG emissions reduction target. Renault CEO Luca de Meo expressed support for the EU Green Deal in his March 2024 âLetter to Europeâ but appeared unsupportive of climate regulation and overemphasized the threat of job loss and loss of competitiveness due to climate policy in the same letter.\n\nEngagement with Climate-Related Regulations: Renault appeared to engage with CO2 standards for light-duty vehicles in the EU with mostly negative positions. In a March 2023 ACEA press release, Renaultâs CEO, Luca de Meo, appeared unsupportive of the EU's 2035 100% zero-emission CO2 target for light-duty vehicles. Similarly, according to an October 2022 Politico media report, Renault advocated for a weakening of the EU's 2035 100% zero-emissions CO2 target for light-duty vehicles by calling for the inclusion of plug-in hybrids or e-fuels in the policy. Renault advocated to weaken the UK CO2 standard, by calling for no increase in ambition during the enforcement period of the zero-emissions mandate from 2024 onwards in a May 2023 consultation response, obtained via freedom of information request.\n\nPositioning on Energy Transition: In 2022-24 Renault appeared unsupportive of measures to decarbonize road transport. Renault CEO, Luca de Meo, while appearing broadly supportive of the decarbonization of light-duty vehicles, supported a technology-neutral approach to decarbonization within unclear timeframes in a February 2024 interview. In a March 2023 ACEA press release, Renaultâs CEO, Luca de Meo, appeared unsupportive of the EU's 2035 ICE phase-out date for light-duty vehicles, instead advocating for technology neutrality. An October 2022 Politico media report indicated that Renault was among a group of automakers who had pushed for a later target, as well as exceptions for plug-in hybrids or e-fuels in the policy. As several EU nation states attempted to weaken the regulation in its final stages by advocating for an e-fuel exemption, de Meo stated that âmass electrification is â¦ no silver bulletâ and that âthe enemy is fossil-based energy, not a particular technologyâ. Furthermore, in separate June, July and August 2023 statements, de Meo called for a five-year delay to the EUâs 2035 internal combustion engine (ICE) phase-out target, emphasizing numerous challenges associated with vehicle electrification. More recently, de Meo conditioned support for the 2035 ICE phase-out date on the ârightâ enabling conditions in a February 2024 news article, but advocated against a slow-down in the EV transition.\n\nIn the UK, in a May 2023 consultation response found via FOI request, Renault appeared to support the UK ZEV's mandate's proposed trajectory for cars between 2024-27, but advocated for a weaker trajectory for vans, as well as for numerous flexibilities that may weaken the policy's stringency. In the same consultation response, Renault appeared to support the inclusion of ICE-powered hybrids to be sold in the UK from 2030-35 as part of the governmentâs ICE phase-out plans.\n\nRenault also appears to support a 2030 target for biomethane in the EU Hydrogen and Gas Decarbonization Package, according to a May 2023 joint statement.\n\nIndustry Association Governance: Renault has disclosed a partial list of its trade association memberships in its 2022 Universal Registration Document. Renault has not completed an audit of its trade association memberships. The companyâs CEO, Luca de Meo, is currently President of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), which has both positive and negative engagement on automotive climate policy. The company is a member of trade associations with negative engagement on climate policy including the Korea Automobile and Mobility Association (KAMA), the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI), the Mouvement des Entreprises de France (MEDEF) and the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). Renault also is a member of Hydrogen Europe, which has both positive and negative engagement on EU climate policy.\n\nA detailed assessment of the company's corporate review on climate policy engagement can be found on InfluenceMap's CA100+ Investor Hub here.\n\nInfluenceMap collects and assesses evidence of corporate climate policy engagement on a weekly basis, depending on the availability of information from each specific data source (for more information see our methodology). While this analysis flows through to the companyâs scores each week, the summary above is updated periodically. This summary was last updated in Q3 2024.\n\nHow to Read our Relationship Score Map\n\nIn this section, we depict graphically the relationships the corporation has with trade associations, federations, advocacy groups and other third parties who may be acting on their behalf to influence climate change policy. Each of the columns above represents one relationship the corporation appears to have with such a third party. In these columns, the top, dark section represents the strength of the relationship the corporation has with the influencer. For example if a corporation's senior executive also held a key role in the trade association, we would deem this to be a strong relationship and it would be on the far left of the chart above, with the weaker ones to the right. Click on these grey shaded upper sections for details of these relationships. The middle section contains a link to the organization score details of the influencer concerned, so you can see the details of its climate change policy influence. Click on the middle sections for for details of the trade associations. The lower section contains the organization score of that influencer, the lower the more negatively it is influencing climate policy."
