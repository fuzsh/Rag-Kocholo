        "text": "It is one of the fundamental pillars of the Renault Group Climate Plan unveiled in spring 2021: long seen as a leading source of emissions, factories have drawn a great deal of attention even though they account for only 2% of a vehicle’s carbon footprint. Because factories as a whole are prime examples of how to improve environmental and societal outcomes, they are often the object of in-deep analysis and assessment, with additional experimentation. As such, it is open to innovation, partnerships, employment programmes, and brand attractiveness. In short, a driver of positive change that a next-generation automotive company can count on.\n\nLet’s talk production!\n\nSince April 2021, the Group has been working towards ambitious carbon commitments across its production sites: one such target is carbon neutrality — whereby the carbon emitted by an industrial site is offset by the amount of carbon it absorbs — with a 2030 deadline for Europe, 2050 for the rest of the world, and 2025 for the Renault ElectriCity hub located in France. The short timeline will help underpin the Group’s efforts to reduce the overall footprint of its vehicles while offering mobility solutions that are in perfect line with current challenges facing the planet.\n\n“This is one of, if not THE biggest industrial project put in motion by the Group in the past 20 years,” explained Nicolas Estèbe , VP Industry Decarbonisation and Energy Efficiency at Renault Group. “We are undertaking an unprecedented industrial revolution, a radical change not only in how we think about producing and using energy, but also in our relationship to the entire production process. We need to find a way to reduce emissions from our sites by 80%. To do so, we have to use everything at our disposal: energy efficiency for lower consumption, decarbonising the energy that is used, make our sites more compact, monitoring our processes for lower energy use… The roadmap is exhaustive and covers all bases.”\n\nOur factories represent the crossroads of some crucial issues for the Group’s future: their transformation must help the Group live up to its CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) ambitions while keeping production costs in check to ensure a competitive mobility offer and still making room for new production methods. “Electric vehicles raise a significant challenge for our manufacturing processes,” said Franck NARO , VP Industrial Strategy and Corporate Operations. “Our competitors are new to the automotive industry, they started from scratch and have been able to design their manufacturing processes to fit their concepts. As historical manufacturers, however, we have to rethink the way we make and manufacture our vehicles from top to bottom. This is massive undertaking in terms of redesigning our sites and factories.”\n\nEveryone has to play their part\n\nWhile the Group has defined a common end goal — carbon neutrality — each site adopts its own roadmap, based on its specificities and local context. “Our strategy’s rationale is the same for everyone: reduce energy consumption for greater efficiency on one hand and on the other, adopt carbon-free energy solutions that best suit the site and the local ecosystem,” explained Nicolas Estebe.\n\nAcross all Renault Group sites, the energy mix is divided into 53% electricity, 43% natural gas, 3% thermal energy, and 1% LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) and biomass. By the end of 2022, renewables covered 29% of all energy needs. Production emits just over 600,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, or 0.28 tonnes per vehicle. The Group is focusing its efforts on four main areas to further reduce these figures.\n\nFirst, manufacturing processes are constantly being optimised so they continue to use less energy. Nicolas Estebe provided a clear example: “Painting accounts for 40% of a site's energy consumption. In just one year, through a technological breakthrough that has given us an additional competitive edge and without reducing volumes, we have already managed to reduce the energy bill per vehicle by 14%.”\n\nSecondly, we are working to make our sites more compact, with a target of reducing the total surface area of enclosed buildings by 750,000 m2 by 2025. For example, in 2022, 40% of land and three buildings on the Douai site were either transformed or sold. More compact means less space requiring heating and lighting; it also frees up space to develop other activities.\n\nOptimization means identifying where consumption occurs and finding ways to reduce it. Energy management on our sites involves more than 10,000 sensors, connected to Renault Group’s industrial metaverse, so the electricity, gas and compressed air usage can be monitored in real-time. Harnessing this data as part of our environmental management practices has paved the way for predictive analytical models to help anticipate and identify unusual energy use and react in record time.\n\nLast but not least, we produce and use renewable energy. Our industrial sites implement ingenious solutions and mobilise their own resources to contribute to the overall objective. The Tangier site is one such example, which was designed from the outset in 2012 to be a carbon-neutral plant. Or the Romanian facility which, following in the footsteps of sites in Spain and Brazil, has installed solar panels to provide for 20% of its energy needs. There is also the geothermal project in Douai, covering 70% of the site’s gas needs, not to forget the project in Turkey and Spain where heat is recuperated from industrial processes and then reused to provide heating for office and factory spaces.\n\n“Above all else, an industrial site is defined by its geographical location and how it ties into the local energy grid. Each factory must therefore operate at its own scale; a solution in one location is not necessarily the best option in another”, added Nicolas Estebe. “Here again, we have been partnering with energy suppliers such as Iberdrola, Engie, or Dalkia, to develop projects that integrate into the local energy ecosystem. We have also turned these issues into innovation opportunities through hackathons in an effort to bring forth technical solutions that live up to our ambitions.”\n\nThere’s more to life than energy\n\n“The impact of a factory is the difference between how it is and isn’t present in a given area,” explained Franck Naro. “The footprint of our sites is more than just greenhouse gas emissions. We must also reduce our water usage, striving to have self-sufficient industrial systems by 2030 that don’t exacerbate local water shortages. We must also think about our waste management, focusing on reducing, reusing, recycling, transforming, and eliminating waste. We must also continue our efforts to reduce our impact on biodiversity.”\n\n“Beyond the environmental aspect,” he continued, “our industrial sites are important threads of local economics; and we must further enhance our attractiveness to help it flourish. Improving the environmental footprint of our activities is an undeniable asset, as it gives meaning to what we do, it helps change the way people view our industry, and therefore shed a favourable light on people’s jobs. Nevertheless, our responsibility is greater still: rethinking careers, opening up to new job types, building bridges with non-industrial sectors. Take Brazil for example, where our production engineering division is part of a coworking platform where they can think about mobility-related issues with others involved in the industry.”\n\nIt is therefore clear that the next-generation automotive plant is changing the way it thinks about its impact and purpose against a backdrop of various factors: environmental and societal footprints, integration in the local economy and energy ecosystem, partnership-based innovation platforms — factories are not just a link in the manufacturing chain for a given vehicle. A factory is, in its own right, a direct reflection of the Group’s strategy, of its ability to bring out a desirable and sustainable future, and to rally together like minds."
