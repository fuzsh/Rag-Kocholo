        "text": "Organizations involved with motor vehicles\n\nThe automotive industry comprises a wide range of companies and organizations involved in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing, selling, repairing, and modification of motor vehicles.[1] It is one of the world's largest industries by revenue (from 16% such as in France up to 40% to countries like Slovakia).[2][failed verification]\n\nThe word automotive comes from the Greek autos (self), and Latin motivus (of motion), referring to any form of self-powered vehicle. This term, as proposed by Elmer Sperry[3][need quotation to verify] (1860â€“1930), first came into use to describe automobiles in 1898.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of the automobile\n\nThe automotive industry began in the 1860s with hundreds of manufacturers pioneering the horseless carriage. Early car manufacturing involved manual assembly by a human worker. The process evolved from engineers working on a stationary car, to a conveyor belt system where the car passed through multiple stations of more specialized engineers. Starting in the 1960s, robotic equipment was introduced to the process, and most cars are now mainly assembled by automated machinery.[5]\n\nFor many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production, with the U.S. Big Three General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler being the world's three largest auto manufacturers for a time, and G.M. and Ford remaining the two largest until the mid-2000s. In 1929, before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, of which the U.S. automobile enterprises produced more than 90%. At that time, the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons.[6] After 1945, the U.S. produced around three-quarters of the world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and then became a world leader again in 1994. Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production during 2006 and 2007, and in 2008 also China, which in 2009 took the top spot (from Japan) with 13.8 million units, although the U.S. surpassed Japan in 2011, to become the second-largest automobile industry. In 2023, China had for the first time in history more than 30 million produced vehicles a year, after reaching 29 million for the first time in 2017 and 28 million the year before. From 1970 (140 models) over 1998 (260 models) to 2012 (684 models), the number of automobile models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.[7]\n\nSafety\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Automobile safety\n\nSafety is a state that implies being protected from any risk, danger, damage, or cause of injury. In the automotive industry, safety means that users, operators, or manufacturers do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts. Safety for the automobiles themselves implies that there is no risk of damage.\n\nSafety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. Automobiles and other motor vehicles have to comply with a certain number of regulations, whether local or international, in order to be accepted on the market. The standard ISO 26262, is considered one of the best practice frameworks for achieving automotive functional safety.[8]\n\nIn case of safety issues, danger, product defect, or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle, the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run. This procedure is called product recall. Product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from raw materials.\n\nProduct and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the value chain are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements. However, the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls, which cause considerable financial consequences.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Automotive industry by country\n\nIn 2007, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road, consuming over 980 billion litres (980,000,000 m3) of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly.[9] The automobile is a primary mode of transportation for many developed economies. The Detroit branch of Boston Consulting Group predicted that, by 2014, one-third of world demand would be in the four BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India, and China). Meanwhile, in developed countries, the automotive industry has slowed.[10] It is also expected that this trend will continue, especially as the younger generations of people (in highly urbanized countries) no longer want to own a car, and prefer other modes of transport.[11] Other potentially powerful automotive markets are Iran and Indonesia.[12] Emerging automobile markets already buy more cars than established markets.\n\nAccording to a J.D. Power study, emerging markets accounted for 51 percent of the global light-vehicle sales in 2010. The study, performed in 2010 expected this trend to accelerate.[13][14] However, more recent reports (2012) confirmed the opposite; namely that the automotive industry was slowing down even in BRIC countries.[10] In the United States, vehicle sales peaked in 2000, at 17.8 million units.[15]\n\nIn July 2021, the European Commission released its \"Fit for 55\" legislation package,[16] which contains important guidelines for the future of the automotive industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035.[17]\n\nThe governments of 24 developed countries and a group of major car manufacturers including GM, Ford, Volvo, BYD Auto, Jaguar Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz committed to \"work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission globally by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets\".[18][19] Major car manufacturing nations like the United States, Germany, China, Japan and South Korea, as well as Volkswagen, Toyota, Peugeot, Honda, Nissan and Hyundai, did not pledge.[20]\n\nEnvironmental impacts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe global automotive industry is a major consumer of water. Some estimates surpass 180,000 L (39,000 imp gal) of water per car manufactured, depending on whether tyre production is included. Production processes that use a significant volume of water include surface treatment, painting, coating, washing, cooling, air-conditioning, and boilers, not counting component manufacturing. Paintshop operations consume especially large amounts of water because equipment running on water-based products must also be cleaned with water.[23]\n\nIn 2022, Tesla's Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg ran into legal challenges due to droughts and falling groundwater levels in the region. Brandenburg's Economy Minister Joerg Steinbach said that while water supply was sufficient during the first stage, more would be needed once Tesla expands the site. The factory would nearly double the water consumption in the Gruenheide area, with 1.4 million cubic meters being contracted from local authorities per year â€” enough for a city of around 40,000 people. Steinbach said that the authorities would like to drill for more water there and outsource any additional supply if necessary.[24]\n\nWorld motor vehicle production\n\n[edit]\n\nBy year\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Production Change Source 1997 54,434,000 â€” [27] 1998 52,987,000 2.7% [27] 1999 56,258,892 6.2% [28] 2000 58,374,162 3.8% [29] 2001 56,304,925 3.5% [30] 2002 58,994,318 4.8% [31] 2003 60,663,225 2.8% [32] 2004 64,496,220 6.3% [33] 2005 66,482,439 3.1% [34] 2006 69,222,975 4.1% [35] 2007 73,266,061 5.8% [36] 2008 70,520,493 3.7% [37] 2009 61,791,868 12.4% [38] 2010 77,857,705 26.0% [39] 2011 79,989,155 3.1% [40] 2012 84,141,209 5.3% [41] 2013 87,300,115 3.7% [42] 2014 89,747,430 2.6% [43] 2015 90,086,346 0.4% [44] 2016 94,976,569 4.5% [45] 2017 97,302,534 2.36% [46] 2018 95,634,593 1.71% [47] 2019 91,786,861 5.2% [48] 2020 77,621,582 16% [49] 2021 80,145,988 3.25% [50] 2022 85,016,728 6.08% [51]\n\nBy country\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Automotive industry by country\n\nThe OICA counts over 50 countries that assemble, manufacture, or disseminate automobiles.
