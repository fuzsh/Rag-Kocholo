        "text": "If you've decided on a specific car class or model, it will be helpful to check how well they rank for reliability in their respective sectors, but if you're not sure which one to go for, checking the brand rankings is a good place to start.\n\nYou may think that all fairly new cars have great reliability ratings, but the data collected for the annual What Car? Reliability Survey, conducted in association with MotorEasy, shows just how different they can be.\n\nToyota and its premium brand Lexus top our dependability charts, and Cupra and Alfa Romeo sit at the other end of the spectrum, with a difference of more than 15% separating the best from the worst.\n\nAnyone who reports a fault on their car in the previous 24 months is asked to rate the seriousness of the issue by telling us how much it cost to repair and how long it kept the car out of action. We also ask what area of the car was involved, giving people 14 different categories to choose from.\n\nThe data on cost of repairs and time off the road is collated for each model to create a unique reliability rating, and this is used to rank cars. The latest survey gained 21,732 responses and that enabled us to report on 178 models up to five years old from 32 different brands.\n\nThe most reliable car brands\n\n1. Lexus\n\nReliability rating 98.3%\n\nThe luxury brand of Toyota has topped our dependability chart for seven years in a row, partly because its cars rarely go wrong, and also because when they do, its dealers fix the problems for free.\n\nIts star performer is the 2014-2021 Lexus NX family SUV, which has a reliability rating of 99.8%. The second and third most reliable family SUVs are also Lexus models: the current Lexus NX scores 99.4% and the Lexus UX 99.3%.\n\nIts previous generation luxury SUV, the 2016-2022 Lexus RX, is also a great bet if you want problem-free driving. It scored 98.6% and has a fault rate of 8%.\n\nSee the latest Lexus deals >\n\n2. Toyota\n\nReliability rating 97.2%\n\nMini is the highest rated European car brand for reliability, posting strong performances across its line-up. Overall, 10% of the Minis we were told about went wrong, but three-quarters of them were in and out of the garage in less than a week. The car maker paid for 94% of repairs, and owners who had to pay were charged less than £100 per fault.\n\nThe 2015-2024 Mini Clubman is its most reliable model, with a score of 97.9%, and the Mini Electric fares well, too; with a rating of 97.6% it’s the highest-scoring electric car in our survey. And if you’re after open-top fun, the Mini Convertible shouldn’t let you down with its reliability rating of 97.1%.\n\nSee the latest Mini deals >\n\n4. Suzuki\n\nReliability rating 96.9%\n\nOnly 8% of Suzuki models owners told us about had any issues, and 44% of issues were resolved in a day or less and three-quarters of faulty cars were fixed for less than £200; 25% of them were put right for free.\n\nWith a score of 96.7%, the Vitara is its most robust model, followed by the Swift on 99.5% and the Ignis on 99.4%.\n\nSee the latest Suzuki deals >\n\n5. Mitsubishi\n\nReliability rating 95.9%\n\nHonda used to top the charts for reliability, but it has been outstripped by other Japanese brands for the past couple of years. It’s still producing dependable cars, though, such as the previous generation 2015-2020 Honda Jazz, which gains 98.5% and the newer Jazz Hybrid, which achieves 98.4%.\n\nOverall, 15% of the Honda cars in the survey had a problem, with the air-con system and non-engine electrics the main culprits. Virtually all faulty cars could still be driven and 40% were in and out of the garage in a day or less. Even better news for owners is that Honda covered the cost of 86% of remedial work.\n\nSee the latest Honda deals >\n\n7. Hyundai\n\nReliability rating 94.3%\n\nHyundai just pips its Korean sibling brand, Kia, partly thanks to the robustness of the petrol and hybrid versions of the Ioniq, which gained 99.2%, and the 2015-2020 Hyundai Tucson, which has a rating of 98.8%.\n\nThe brand’s smallest model, the i10, is almost as good as the larger motors; the current i10 scored 98.4% and the 2014-2020 Hyundai i10 did even better on 98.6%.\n\nOverall, 16% of Hyundais went wrong and 87% were fixed for free by the car maker.\n\nSee the latest Hyundai deals >\n\n8. Kia\n\nHybrid versions of the Niro family SUV were the least troublesome, with just 5% of owners reporting a fault and the model gaining an impressive score of 98.8%. The Niro EV has been dependable too, with a reliability rating of 94.7%. The Picanto city car also fared well; it scored 97.5% and only 10% of the cars reported on had a problem.\n\nSee the latest Kia deals >\n\n9. Volvo\n\nReliability rating 93.7%\n\nAlthough Volvo has a high overall fault rate of 20%, most problems are sorted out quickly and at little or no cost to owners, minimising the disruption. Around 50% of faults were resolved in a day or less and Volvo paid for 94% of the work. The XC40 and XC60 were the brand’s best models, with plug-in hybrid versions of the XC40 the highest scorers at 99.0% with a fault rate of 7%, and petrol and hybrid XC60s almost as good with a rating of 98.0% and fault rate of 14%.\n\nSee the latest Volvo deals >\n\n10. Tesla\n\nReliability rating 93.6%\n\nThe American EV brand has achieved a huge turnaround in the quality and reliability of its cars. It’s jumped from 19th place in last year’s survey to 10th position. The Model S still lags behind with a score of 83.9% and a fault rate of 41%, but the Model Y is up there with the best electric cars with a rating of 97.4% and Model 3 looks good too, with a score of 94.0%.\n\nOwners told us they got a great level of service when things went wrong, with 97% of remedial work done for free and 60% of cars fixed in a day or less.\n\nSee the latest Tesla deals >\n\nLeast reliable car brands\n\n1. Cupra\n\nReliability rating 85.6%\n\nThe results for Alfa Romeo were even more mixed; the Alfa Romeo Stelvio achieved a decent overall reliability rating of 95.8%, while the Giulia managed just 77.3% – one of the lowest scores in the executive car class.\n\nHow come the Alfa Romeo Giulia performed so poorly? Well, 44% of owners suffered faults with their cars, and a third of them had to wait more than a week for their car to be fixed. To add insult to injury, 11% of owners reported receiving bills of more than £1500 for a single repair.\n\n3. Vauxhall\n\nReliability rating 86.9%\n\nVauxhall finished just above its Italian sister brand this year, with major faults and high repair costs causing headaches for many owners. The worst offender was the Vauxhall Mokka Electric, which received a reliability rating of 60.6%, making it the least reliable electric SUV featured in the survey.\n\nIndeed, one owner told us that their Mokka Electric needed around £8500 of repairs just two days after they got it. Thankfully, that particular bill was footed by Vauxhall, but 10% of owners reported that they’d been charged more than £1500 for a single repair.\n\n4. Jaguar\n\nReliability rating 87.6%\n\nIt comes as little surprise that Land Rover fared so similarly to sister brand Jaguar in this year’s reliability survey, given how long the two have shared a parent company. None of the Land Rover models that featured in our survey excelled in terms of reliability, although the Range Rover Evoque does stand out as the most problematic car in the range.\n\nMany owners of both the current car and the 2011-2019 Range Rover Evoque had faults to report, around half of which took more than a week to put right. Fortunately, Land Rover paid to fix things in most cases.\n\n6. Subaru\n\nReliability rating 89.0%\n\nReliability is typically a strong suit for Japanese car makers – a theory that the top of this list supports – but Subaru is the exception to that rule.\n\nA small proportio of fifth-generation Subaru Outback owners reported having to shell out more than £750 to fix electrical issues, which rendered cars undriveable and took more than a week to sort out. Some problems were also highlighted by Subaru XV owners, although these were typically less serious, and all XVs were fixed under warranty.\n\nReliability rating 89.1%\n\nAudi just pipped Subaru in this year’s survey, although the reliability you can expect from your Audi is highly model-dependent. The Audi A3 Sportback proved most problematic, with more than half of the A3s in our survey suffering a fault in the past year (most of which related to the infotainment system).\n\nConversely, the Audi TT performed brilliantly; with a reliability rating of 98.4%, it topped our list of the most reliable sports cars. Unfortunately you can’t buy a TT new any more, but if you’re in the market for one there are plenty of used Audi TTs for sale.\n\n8. MG\n\nReliability rating 89.2%\n\nWith the exception of the MG5 and MG ZS EV, all the other MG models in our survey performed poorly in their respective categories. The MG4 proved to be the least reliable of the bunch, with a rating of 76.1%.\n\nBodywork and non-motor-related electrical issues were the main sources of complaint, and one in five owners of faulty MG4s paid more than £1000 to get their car fixed.\n\n9. Mercedes\n\nReliability rating 89.8%\n\nAlthough Mercedes performed better in the latest survey than Audi, both premium German brands fell far behind rivals, such as BMW and Volvo.\n\nDiesel versions of the Mercedes A-Class family hatchback let their owners down more often than any other of the brand’s models; more than a third of owners experienced issues with their A-Class, and most faults took more than a week to put right.\n\n10. Renault\n\nThe Renault Arkana was the least reliable of the five models we heard about, while the first-generation Renault Captur came out on top. Reliability ratings for the two models were 86.5% and 95.9% respectively.\n\nBrand reliability for cars aged up to five years old\n\nRank Brand Score 1 Lexus 98.3% 2 Toyota 97.4% 3 Mini 97.2% 4 Suzuki 96.9% 5 Mitsubishi 96.2% 6 Honda 95.9% 7 Hyundai 94.3% 8 Kia 93.8% 9 Volvo 93.7% 10 Tesla 93.6% 11 Dacia 93.1% 12 BMW 93.0% 13 Mazda 92.8% 14 Citroen 92.3% 15 Fiat 92.0% 16 Skoda 91.4% 17 Ford 91.4% 18 Seat 90.9% 19 Nissan 90.7% 20 Porsche 90.7% 21 Peugeot 90.5% 22 Volkswagen 90.2% 23 Renault 90.0% 24 Mercedes 89.8% 25 MG 89.2% 26 Audi 89.1% 27 Subaru 89.0% 28 Land Rover 87.6% 29 Jaguar 87.4% 30 Vauxhall 86.9% 31 Alfa Romeo 85.6% 32 Cupra 82.4%\n\nTo read the reliability data for other car classes follow these links:\n\nMost reliable cars in the UK\n\nMost reliable small cars\n\nMost reliable family cars\n\nMost reliable executive cars\n\nMost reliable luxury cars\n\nMost reliable small SUVs\n\nMost reliable family SUVs\n\nMost reliable large SUVs\n\nMost reliable seven-seaters\n\nMost reliable electric cars\n\nMost reliable electric SUVs\n\nMost reliable sports cars\n\nMost reliable diesel cars\n\nWhat's the most dependable car by fuel type?\n\nIf reliability is your priority, you’ll be best off buying a hybrid. Just 17% of the plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) in our survey went wrong, while 18% of regular hybrids had a glitch.\n\nPetrol models as a whole were only slightly less dependable, with a fault rate of 20%. Diesels and electric cars proved to be the least reliable, with a joint-highest fault rate of 26%. Hybrids will generally cost you the least to repair, too. All of the PHEVS and 94% of the regular hybrids we were told about were fixed for free; only 1% of hybrid owners had to pay more than £1500 to get their car put right.\n\nWhich models cost the most and least to repair?\n\nThe good news is that 83% of the cars in our survey had their faults fixed for free, but on the flip side, 2% of owners faced bills that exceeded £1500 for each issue.\n\nWhen it comes to costly repairs, it’s the diesel versions of the current BMW 3 Series that are the worst: 42% of the examples in our survey cost more than £1500 to repair.\n\nThat’s a higher proportion of large bills than for the previous-generation 3 Series (2012-2019) – 30% of those who own petrol and diesel models built from 2012-2019 paid more than £1500 to fix faults.\n\nA third of Jaguar F-Type owners were also charged more than £1500 to get their cars back on the road, and 31% of Skoda Karoq diesels cost this much too.\n\nIn contrast, many car makers fixed every fault with certain models for free. These include the Audi A1, the BMW 1 Series, the Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid, the 2013-2021 Lexus IS and the Lexus NX, the Porsche 718 Boxster and Porsche 718 Cayman, the Suzuki Swift, the Tesla Model Y, the previous and current Toyota Yaris and the Volvo XC60.\n\nThe worst model for lengthy repairs was the Subaru Outback (2014-2021) – all the examples we were told about were rendered undriveable by their faults and were out of action for more than a week.\n\nLikewise, all faulty examples of the Audi TT, the Lexus UX, the Porsche Cayenne and the Renault Captur were in dealerships for more than a week.\n\nWhat's the most dependable type of gearbox?\n\nAutomatic gearboxes – whether they be conventional or the dual-clutch gearbox type – gave very few problems for the owners of cars fitted with them, with a fault rate of just 1% in that area.\n\nManual gearboxes and clutches were a bit more troublesome generally, with a fault rate of 3%.\n\nSurprisingly, the gearbox type that proved the least reliable was the single-speed automatic found in most electric vehicles (EVs) – 14% of EV owners reported an issue in this category.\n\nAbout the author\n\nClaire Evans has been a motoring journalist for more than 30 years with a focus on consumer issues for much of that time.
