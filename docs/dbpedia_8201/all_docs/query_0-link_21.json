        "text": "Regime change in the March issue of our monthly Top 10 of the global auto industry: The Renault-Nissan Alliance, a global auto conglomerate consisting of Groupe Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi, took the top of the March ranking.\n\n“We are seeing the rapid growth of a new strong global leader: The Renault-Nissan Alliance. In contrast to its main rival VW Group, the Alliance benefits from being smaller in China, which gives it more growth potential,” said Juan Felipe Munoz-Vieira, Global Analyst for JATO Dynamics, which provides the data to Forbes. “And that’s what put a light under the Alliance in March, as Renault-Nissan’s volume grew by 12% in China, while VW Group showed signs of stagnation, losing 7% in the Middle Kingdom.”\n\nAccording to Munoz-Vieira, Renault-Nissan also is doing very well in key turn-around markets Russia and Brazil. “The company is definitely better positioned when these markets start their recovery,” the analyst said.\n\nLooking at the whole first quarter, the field looks a bit more familiar, with Volkswagen on top, followed by its nemesis Toyota, and the Alliance breathing down Toyota’s neck with only 2,313 units to spare.\n\nWith the vigorous Alliance crashing the previously boring party of the Top 3, the race promises to remain interesting for the whole year. Unbelievable, but true, the often overlooked Renault-Nissan Alliance has a fighting chance to take the top spot once this year is over.\n\nThanks to the generous support of global data house Jato Dynamics, Forbes publishes a monthly list of the top 10 global automakers according to the best measure possible: True sales to end users. Jato is an independent, trusted, and highly reputable supplier of data to the auto industry. As much as possible, JATO counts true registrations of new cars with the authorities. In some markets, these data are either not made available, or made available too late. There, JATO tracks true sales using proprietary methods. JATO counts cars and light commercial vehicles. It does not count heavy trucks and buses. Due to this methodology, the data will differ from production data, or deliveries to wholesale as published elsewhere."
