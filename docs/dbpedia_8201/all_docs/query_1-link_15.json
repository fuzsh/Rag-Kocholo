        "text": "A new generation of electric cars\n\nA pioneer ten years ago and the European leader today, Renault is stepping up its electric revolution with the All-new Renault Scénic E-Tech electric and Mégane E-Tech electric. These two emblematic models in the Renault range, now available in 100% electric form, combine exceptional agility, on-road versatility and performance. They are the symbol of a new vision. A vision of sustainable mobility that is ever more accessible, without compromising on efficiency or driving pleasure.\n\nThe rebirth of two icons\n\nUnveiled at the Mondial de l'Auto 2022, the Renault 4EVER Trophy and Renault 5 Turbo 3E showcars evoke and revive memories. These revivals of Renault's iconic models harmoniously blend an instantly recognisable silhouette with retro inspiration, sophisticated lines and technological details. The 4EVER Trophy show car celebrates the 25th anniversary of the 4L Trophy solidarity raid and, above all, foreshadows a future 100% electric B-segment SUV, which will go on sale in 2025.\n\nThe R5 TURBO 3E show car, also electric but dedicated to drifting, paid tribute to the R5 Turbo and Turbo 2 sports versions of the Renault 5, as part of the celebrations to mark the model's 50th anniversary. The new electric Renault 5 to be launched in 2024.\n\nTravelling without limits\n\nNew Wave's E-Tech hybrid SUVs.\n\nRenault is strengthening its presence in the hybrid SUV category with All-new Renault Rafale, Renault Espace and Renault Austral. These three ambitious models are the pillars in the conquest of the C and D segments by the brand. They continue the offensive launched by Arkana and Mégane E-Tech electric in the core market, in the tradition of \"cars for living\", with a resolutely modern approach. The 'Nouvelle Vague' approach aims to make the brand a benchmark in terms of technology, clean energy and services.\n\nHuman technology\n\nLike the high-tech interiors of the All-new Scénic E-Tech electric, All-new Rafale and Espace, the technology present in the latest Renault models shows the know-how of the brand and its partners in terms of innovation. The latest-generation OpenR large screen, equipped with the OpenR Link system, is the embodiment of a new type of immersive experience. Both ultra-connected and rich in applications, relying on Google’s intelligence and the universality of the Android system, it comes close to using a smartphone.\n\nMaking life easier\n\nNew technologies, electric vehicles, connected models, personalised applications... At Renault, our passion drives us to do everything we can to fulfil one promise: to make your everyday life easier. Because it's important to us, our vehicles and services are designed to become your companions on the road and meet your desires of the moment, whatever they may be.\n\nLearn more\n\nThe craftsman for professionals\n\nSince its creation, Renault has developed, manufactured and sold commercial vehicles to meet the needs of professionals around the world. Express, Kangoo, Trafic and Master, iconic vehicles, are recognized worldwide for their innovations which improve the daily lives of their users. Renault is also the first manufacturer to market a range of 100% electric commercial vehicles.\n\nLaunched in 2010, the Renault Pro+ label ensures business customers with specific needs are aware of Renault’s full range of commercial vehicle expertise. With over 350 certified converters worldwide, the 600 Renault Pro+ centers pride themselves on offering all customers solutions that meet their exact needs.\n\nPreparing for the future\n\nFor more than 120 years, Renault has been blazing new trails in mobility. In 2022, a new chapter opened with the presentation of the Scénic Vision concept car. Equipped with an electric engine with a hydrogen range extender, it embodies Renault's strategic commitments to sustainable development in terms of the environment, safety and inclusion. Using mostly recycled and recyclable materials, it sets a new course for Renault, that of more sustainable mobility."
