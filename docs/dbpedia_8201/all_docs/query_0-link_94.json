        "text": "In January 2021, Renault Group launched the \"Renaulution\" plan, aiming to shift the strategic focus of the group from pursuing sales volume to placing greater emphasis on value creation, moving toward a next-generation automotive company. In the advancement of this strategy, new energy vehicles are top priority for the group.\n\nAfter years of exploration and development, China has established a complete and highly competitive new energy vehicle industry chain, which has become the best partner for the Renault Group to focus on new energy vehicles. Since 2021, the group has agreed strategic cooperation with Chinese companies, achieving fruitful results in various fields of the new energy vehicle industry chain, including power systems, batteries, and design manufacturing. The group recently released its first quarter financial report for 2024, with global vehicle sales reaching 549,000 units and revenue hitting 11.7 billion euros ($12.6 billion), demonstrating the effectiveness of the \"Renaulution\" strategy.\n\nOn the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France, Renault Group has accelerated the implementation of its strategy, creating a new paradigm of win-win cooperation in the Sino-French new energy vehicle industry ecosystem. This has helped Renault maintain its leading position in the global automotive market, while bringing more inspiration for Chinese companies to expand into broader global markets.\n\nLooking to the future, the \"win-win path\" represented by the group will continue to drive the \"ecological cooperation\" of the Sino-French new energy vehicle industry toward a new journey."
