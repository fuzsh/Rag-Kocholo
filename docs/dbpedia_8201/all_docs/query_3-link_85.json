        "text": "Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali reflected on the increasing signs that Renault will withdraw from the sport as power unit supplier and whether their decision was based on the upcoming 2026 regulations.\n\nF1 aimed to attract more car manufacturers with the looming 2026 power unit regulations, which will continue to be turbo-hybrid V6s, but with the absence of the MGU-H, while delivering power in a 50-50 basis between internal combustion and electric power.\n\nAt the start of the discussions of the new rules, Volkswagen group was the only party seriously interested in F1 though Audi and Porsche and reportedly insisted on dropping the MGU-H as it did not have any road relevance.\n\nPorsche came close to an F1 entry, but their talks with Red Bull broke down while Audi bought Sauber and are gearing up for their F1 debut as a works team in 2026.\n\nWhile having one additional manufacturer in F1 can hardly be considered as a success, the fact the Renault are apparently on their way out means that we are back at square one. Audi in, Renault out.\n\n2026 F1 power unit rules a compromise\n\nDomenicali was asked about this point in an interview with Motorsport.com, he said: “I think that the real decision [from Renault] was related to another condition, to be very open and very honest with you.\n\n“It’s not related to the wrong regulation. It is related to a different situation that they have to deliver a result in a different timeframe.\n\n“I believe that, at the moment when the regulation was defined, there was the need to make sure that the manufacturers were really interested to be part of the championship. They are a vital element of this equation, because with no engine we cannot run – therefore there was the need to listen.\n\n“And it is true that, because we don’t have to be to be shy or to hide behind a tree, that it was a compromise solution because of the different interests of all the different manufacturers, in fact.\n\n“But I would say, the FIA tried to do the best to make sure that we could have something that would be okay for everyone. That is true,” Domenicali concluded.\n\nAlpine-Renault have been in turmoil recently, with management changes as Bruno Famin was replaced by Oliver Oakes, the former confirming a plan to drop F1 power unit operation at Viry-Châtillon, with plans to procure power units from Mercedes.\n\nAll this seems part of the master plan concocted by Flavio Briatore who was recently hired as an Executive Asvisor."
