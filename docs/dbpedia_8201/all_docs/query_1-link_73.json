        "text": "Colombia. Renault's vice president of brand, product and performance, Bruno Vanel, said the company intends to install a new platform on which a new vehicle will be produced in Colombia.\n\nThis project is part of the reindustrialization policy promoted by the National Government for the automotive industry, and in which GM Colmotores also participates with the local production of the Chevrolet Joy. It is not yet announced what the new Renault model will be assembled.\n\nFor the installation of this new platform in the Envigado plant, Renault Group announced the intention to invest up to 100 million dollars.\n\nIn addition, as reported by the company in an official statement, that amount will also be used to promote sustainable mobility in the country.\n\nOn the other hand, tenders with Colombian suppliers for the supply of auto parts are already advanced, which translates into growth and progress for the entire automotive production chain.\n\n\"This project reinforces our willingness to enhance Colombia's role in our strategy as an export platform for Latin America,\" said Renault Latin America President Luiz Fernando Pedrucci.\n\nFor his part, the Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism, Germán Umaña Mendoza, stressed that \"the commitment to the business sector is to guarantee legal security and investor confidence, to continue promoting the productive and sustainable development of the country.\"\n\nFinally, the president of Renault-Sofasa, Ariel Montenegro, said: \"Our commitment is to generate real progress for the country, for our employees, for our suppliers and dealers and our entire value chain, offering mobility solutions for thousands of Colombian families, as we have been doing for almost 54 years.\""
