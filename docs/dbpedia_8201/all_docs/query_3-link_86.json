        "text": "F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali does not believe the upcoming regulation changes contributed to Renault seeking to exit the championship as a power unit supplier.\n\nFormer Alpine team principal Bruno Famin announced the French squad's plan to disband its power unit operation ahead of the 2026 season, when the comprehensive new rules come into place, in favour of becoming a customer F1 team.\n\nAlpine voluntarily sacrificing its works status in F1 is a considerable development and sends a powerful statement about Renault's ability to produce a competitive engine.\n\nUltimately, the French marque decided its resources and focus would be better spent elsewhere, but concerns about the costs associated with the regulations overhaul that put Renault off remain.\n\nIt has led to a situation where its withdrawal has taken the shine off Audi and Red Bull becoming power unit manufacturers, akin to two steps forward, one step back.\n\nHowever, Domenicali argues it says more about the Viry-Châtillon-based operation's internal pressures than it does about the 2026 power unit regulations.\n\n“I think that the real decision [from Renault] was related to another condition, to be very open and very honest with you,” the 59-year-old told Motorsport.com.\n\n“It's not related to the wrong regulation. It is related to a different situation that they have to deliver a result in a different timeframe.\"\n\nDomenicali was quick to highlight the need to garner support from the power unit manufacturers when writing the new regulations, something he says led to compromises between the desires of the different parties.\n\nThe Italian insists the FIA did its best to ensure all teams were listened to and considered in producing the next set of power unit rules.\n\n“I believe that, at the moment when the regulation was defined, there was the need to make sure that the manufacturers were really interested to be part of the championship,\" he explained.\n\n\"They are a vital element of this equation, because with no engine we cannot run - therefore there was the need to listen.\n\n“And it is true that, because we don't have to be to be shy or to hide behind a tree, that it was a compromise solution because of the different interests of all the different manufacturers, in fact.\n\n“But I would say, the FIA tried to do the best to make sure that we could have something that would be okay for everyone. That is true.”"
