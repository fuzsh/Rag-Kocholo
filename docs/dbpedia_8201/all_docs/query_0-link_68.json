        "text": "Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is playing up its proposed merger with Renault, unveiled on Monday, as a chance to create a European-American carmaker with the financial and industrial brawn to survive a turbulent age.\n\nThe new company “would have the scale, expertise and resources to navigate the rapidly changing automotive industry,” Fiat said in a statement. That rapid change includes huge shifts to electric and autonomous cars as well as threats to car ownership posed by the likes of Uber and Lyft. Fiat, furthermore, promised to deliver those benefits without closing a single factory.\n\nBut how realistic is that assertion? Here is a closer look at some reasons the merger might succeed — and why it might flop.\n\nTogether they can target new markets\n\nFiat Chrysler has a strong position in the United States with its Jeep and Ram brands, but has lacked the money to properly market the S.U.V.s and pickups in promising new markets like the Middle East and Africa, says Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at AutoTrader.\n\nJeep has already demonstrated its potential in Europe since Fiat and Chrysler merged in 2014. Sales of Jeeps in the European Union rose 37 percent last year, to 12,200 vehicles. With help from Renault, Jeep could push into more overseas markets.\n\n“Jeep and Ram have great potential globally but they haven’t had the means to do it,” Ms. Krebs said. “There is strong potential if done right. Jeep is known globally.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
