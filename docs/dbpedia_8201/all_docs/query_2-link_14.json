        "text": "It was not a secret that in the past few years Renault and Fiat (FCA) were negotiating a merger between the companies. It was out in the open and crashes several times. Its quite understandable why these companies would insist on trying again and again to merge. The future of automotive industry is going to be a cruel one, and a survival battle has started.\n\n\"FCA and PSA merger leaves Renault alone in the survival battle.\n\nBut in June 2019 the merger proposal collapsed, and although Fiat kept the negotiation channel open, in December 2019 FCA and PSA (Peugeot) announced that they will merge. So while Fiat and PSA are strengethening themselves, preparing themselves to the future, Renault stays without a partner. It now has either one of the Japanese manufacturers, the American ones, or the Germen industry - but both have cultural issues to consider.\n\n\"The Fight is Far from Over Though\n\nBut the last few videos I saw from Renault design department, shows the fight is far from over.\n\nFirst I saw Morphoz, the transforming car. I like the concept of combining two cars in one. A compact electric city car with a long-drives family SUV. Some parts of it are also made from recycled materials, so a thought about sustainability has also added here. There is a very impressive work that was made on the driver dashboard, screens, infotainment and connectivity (watch from 4:50 - 5:50).\n\nThe only point I would point out that I dont like in this vehicle, is how the front seat rotates backwards (watch minute 4:00 in the video). This means that the head of the person now leans where a minute ago the legs were. I think that after a few rides, this un-hygenic issue will be noticable. It is a very cool behavior, but not well-thought over.\n\nThen I saw the Trezor. A car that is built like a red wedding ring box, celebrating electrical power and French romance. It has a surface with a \"skin\" of hex shapes, break lights made of lazer wires, and an innovative cooling system for the batteries. All these points are just part of the innovative parts here, and reminding you it actually drives on the road!\n\nCONCLUSION: SO WHO COULD RENAULT PARTNER WITH?\n\nAll in all, this seems like Renault is not giving up yet and putting big fight. Renault has Samsung, which is definitely one of the fastest growing tech innovation groups around the world in the past 10 years. It also has a Formula One team, which keeps the performance as a key target. They also develop engines, and they manufacture for others. Their design department, led by Laurens Van Den Acker, has shown impressive results in the past years with the Trezor and Morphoz.\n\nSo I wish Renault great success and also a bit of luck cant hurt. I do recommend to keep looking for partners for a merger. Best match would be with some markets that they dont have access to, such as the luxury market or premium one (like Mercedes or BMW).\n\nBig kudos to Supercar Blondie for getting the exposure to all these wonderful cars.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI write a journal on my adventures in Italy, discovering emergent techs in Europe and my new professional path in the automotive industry.
