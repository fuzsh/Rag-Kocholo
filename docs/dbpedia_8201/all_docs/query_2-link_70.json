        "text": "Renault Group and the enterprise data challenge\n\nRenault Group is one of the largest auto manufacturers in the world.\n\nWith so many business units across its enterprise, data silos had emerged between and even within them, making it difficult to surface and share impact-making insights. These silos also resulted in an extremely complicated point-to-point backend that made onboarding external data consumers slow and complex.\n\nLooking to power its digital transformation and position itself at the center of the connected future, Renault Group turned to Apigee’s intelligent API management platform.\n\nBreaking data silos to unlock value\n\nRecognizing the strategic value of its enterprise data, Renault Group began breaking down the silos. The heart of this streamlining was establishing a data governance plan between businesses to define a single unified business information model, with the associated data sets and glossary. Then defining or identifying the Single Points Of Truth or referential to deliver data with a good quality level and 360° vision. So different teams like engineering, sales, and customer service could all discover, share, and benefit from the same insights. Finally, implementing an API communication layer with high level APIs to link efficiently and easily business units, share data and services and warranty data integrity, avoid non useful replication of data. And the key to making those connections was Google Apigee.\n\n“We did some investigating and found that the same data was sometimes referenced locally by several different systems within the company”. “Now, thanks to our data governance strategy, data is shared through APIs so we can break down those silos and make that data accessible across the company.” says Mourad Abbas, Head of Master Data Management and API governance, Renault Group.\n\nReusing APIs for simplicity\n\nApigee is also helping Renault Group simplify how it shares its data externally with partners. With over 2000 different information systems, each with its own rich functionality, the company’s point-to-point link system had become a “plate of spaghetti” that was time-consuming to individually manage and made for an inefficient onboarding process.\n\nNow Renault Group onboards new partners faster without having to build net-new APIs for each one and can do so quickly with a simple process that completely conceals the backend complexity from the end user.\n\n“Our aim was to implement high-level API management as modular, reusable and secured components to lower costs and reduce time-to-market for new projects. With Apigee, we have this common API communication layer that simplifies how we exchange data and services between providers and consumers” says Mourad Abbas.\n\nBuilding an ecosystem for tomorrow\n\nThat easy-to-use simplicity is allowing the company to create an ecosystem of partners with Renault’s Group data and APIs squarely at the center, so it can position itself not just as a car maker, but also as a data company. And Apigee is helping Renault Group monetize these emerging opportunities.\n\n“We understood clearly that to stay competitive in the market, you need to adapt your company to new business models and new partnerships with startups, dealers, smart cities, energy providers, etc.” Mourad ABBAS explains. “As the car itself becomes a connected component, you ask, ‘how do you make it easy to interface with that system?’ The answer for us was APIs.” Using Apigee’s monetization module, Renault Group is working on creating an “API store” to create a thriving ecosystem around its data products.\n\nAnd because Apigee makes it easy for Renault Group to keep its APIs secure, innovation doesn’t come at the cost of security. “It allows us to share data and services in a secure way, so we maintain security guidelines with our community of developers, partners, and clients” Mourad Abbas says.\n\nRenault Group is moving boldly into the future with a digital transformation. High level APIs exposed through Apigee are a good answer to interact with the ecosystem, to share data and services in a secured way, and to go up to the data monetization."
