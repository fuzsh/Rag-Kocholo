        "text": "We at Renault Trucks fully endorse the definition and principles laid down by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation:\n\n“In our current economy, we take materials from the Earth, make products from them, and eventually throw them away as waste – the process is linear. In a circular economy, by contrast, we stop waste being produced in the first place. A circular economy is based on three principles, all driven by design: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials (at their highest value), regenerate nature. Underpinned by a transition to renewable energy and materials, the circular economy is a resilient system that is good for business, people, and the environment.”\n\nInstead of using the planet’s resources to build new trucks and spare parts, in 2019 we adopted a circular approach in which we are continually progressing. We have set up solutions to extend the useful life of our own trucks so that our customers can keep them for longer.\n\nOur first step was to regenerate used trucks to give them a second life. This led us to set up the Used Truck Factory, which regenerates and repurposes trucks to meet market demands. Since 2019, we have been marketing a range of reconditioned trucks under our own brand.\n\nWe then undertook to combat obsolescence and extend our trucks’ first lifetime so that they can be used intensively for longer by their initial owners. The regenerated trucks range is geared towards customers with large fleets who, instead of replacing their vehicles, opt instead for reconditioning. Their trucks are appraised, the cab interior is redesigned, and we work on the kinematic chain, updating the vehicle with the latest software (in particular to track consumption and the performances with regard to CO2 emissions). That way, we can offer our customers their own freshly-renovated trucks rather than selling them new vehicles, in keeping with our “lean” approach.\n\nThis circular approach also applies to our spare parts. We have decided to develop the regeneration and reuse of spare parts and components. Up until now, our Limoges factory was the only site specialised in remanufacturing major truck parts (gearboxes, engines, etc.). We are currently building a truck dismantling plant to recover and recycle - once cleaned and regenerated - all parts that have a strong potential for reuse.\n\nBy perpetually regenerating, converting and reusing our trucks and by reconditioning our parts, we are adding new value, extending their lifespan and keeping them constantly on the move. Because Trucks are forever !\n\nVehicle regeneration supports the circular economy in a variety of ways:\n\nReuse of resources: regenerating a used vehicle generally means repairing or replacing faulty or worn parts instead of discarding them or replacing them with new parts. This extends the vehicle’s useful life and avoids the need to consume new resources to manufacture new parts, thereby reducing demand for the raw materials and energy needed to produce them.\n\nWaste reduction: The regeneration of a used vehicle, by preventing the vehicle from being scrapped or destroyed, reduces the amount of waste involved in the automobile industry. Recovered used vehicles are refurbished and put back on the market, thereby preventing them from adding to the waste that is proving such a burden for our society.\n\nReduction of the carbon footprint: Producing new vehicles has a major environmental impact because of the greenhouse gas emissions entailed in the production, transport and processing of the materials. By remanufacturing used vehicles, we avoid the production of new vehicles and reduce their impact on greenhouse gas emissions."
