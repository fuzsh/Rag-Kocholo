        "text": "As part of the revamp of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, the group announced a new three-step program to boost the added value of the three automakers in Latin America, India and the EU. This plan prioritizes electromobility and decarbonization and will allow the three companies to take advantage of joint technology development.\n\nThe program prioritizes the creation of high-value operational projects in Latin America, India and the EU and the enhancement of workable agility to boost collaboration. It will also revamp shareholding participation of the three automakers, according to Cluster Industrial.\n\nRenault is also set to resume car manufacturing in Mexico after a 20-year hiatus, using Nissan's A1 plant in Aguascalientes. Furthermore, the Japanese and French automakers will market two new all-electric vehicles in Latin America. Both vehicles will be affordable A-segment vehicles (three- and five-door compact hatchbacks) that use the Common Module Family (CMF-AEV) platform.\n\nIn addition, both companies announced that the Nissan Frontier and Renault Alaska collaboration will expand through a new pick-up truck model to be assembled in a French plant in Argentina.\n\nThe Japanese automaker plans to invest up to 15% in Ampere, Renault's EV and software entity in the EU, aiming to become a strategic investor. Through this investment, Nissan seeks to tackle new business opportunities in the EU. Mitsubishi is also considering investing in Ampere, marking a significant step towards the growth and expansion plans of both companies in the EUâ€™s market."
