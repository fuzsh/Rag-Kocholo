        "text": "We have rethought the way we work to make it simpler, clearer, more fluid.\n\nIn this new organization, the brands are in the driver’s seat. Each brand is clearly distinguishable, they are all focused on clients and markets, and are masters of their own profitability.\n\nCross-cutting functional divisions, with Engineering leading the charge, work closely with the brands and are responsible for the time-to-market calendar, competitiveness, costs, and development timeline.\n\nThe Alliance with Nissan Mitsubishi Motors plays a pivotal role in focusing efforts on high-impact projects.\n\nThe oldest and most emblematic brand of the Group, Renault is entering a new era with the strategic plan ‘Renaulution’. Building on more than 120 years of inclusive innovation and a legacy made of numerous iconic models, Renault embraces the changes from the automotive market. With its “Nouvelle Vague”, the brand will bring modernity in the automotive industry by becoming a tech, service and clean energy brand.\n\nRenault will evolve into:\n\n- a Tech brand, with an ecosystem called “Software République” that will allow Renault, other founding members and future partners to develop joined expertise, build European know-how and defend our sovereignty in key technologies from big data to electronics. It will also allow Renault to equip its vehicles with leading artificial intelligence and cyber-security systems.\n\n- a Service brand, offering the best connectivity and high-tech services embedded natively in our vehicles. Renault will be the first carmaker to bring Google services to mass-market cars.\n\nFurther, Renault will try to break the consumerist cycle and generate value up until vehicles’ end-of-life, all thanks to its Re-Factory in Flins (France). Renault also has a clear advantage when it comes to second life and end of life of batteries. The control of these parts of the value chain has the potential to generate new business cases and value.\n\n- a Clean Energy brand, becoming a leader of the energy transition. Challenging leaders on the hybrid markets thanks to its revolutionary E-TECH technology, Renault will sustain its leadership on the electric market with new families of products based on our two dedicated electric platforms CMF-EV and CMF-B EV. The brand will also offer market-ready, end-to-end hydrogen solutions for LCVs. The target is to reach the greenest mix on the European market.\n\nRETURN OF A CULT CAR\n\nIn real terms, the ‘Nouvelle Vague’ will see the Renault range bolster its position as a leader in the B segment while reclaiming ground in the C segment. 14 models will be launched by 2025, including 7 electric vehicles and 7 in the upper segments, with the ultimate goal of having them account for 45% of sales by 2025.\n\nOne vehicle in the new line-up is reminiscent of one of the brand’s iconic cars, the R5. A sneak-preview of the future model came with the Renault 5 Prototype, presented at the same time as the ‘Renaulution’ strategic plan. Its role is to show that Renault will democratize the electric car in Europe with a modern approach to the popular and essential car. The Renault 5 Prototype is a cute, pin-sized, city car taking one of Renault’s timeless successes to the future with a modern, 100% electric twist. This is also evident in its body lines, flush surfaces, and some futuristic detailing. The styling elements taken from the original R5 design hide very modern features: the hood intake covers the electric charging socket, the tail lamps feature aerodynamic shutters, and the bumper fog lamps have been converted into LED day lamps.\n\nThe front and the fabric roof draw inspiration from the world of furniture, symbolizing the 'French charm' with a hint of mischief. Lastly, the French flag located in the rear-view mirrors underlines the “invented in France” aspect of the vehicle. The Renault 5 is back!\n\nRead the Renault press release\n\nA driver of ‘sustainable’ automotive consumer practices, Dacia is the Renault Group brand that is redefining what is essential, offering the market’s best value for money in all segments where it is a contender. It recently lived up to expectations once again with Spring, Europe's cheapest electric city car on the market, and the New Logan, Sandero, and Sandero Stepway.\n\nDacia is proof that what is ‘essential’ can also be ‘modern’ and ‘cool’, a breath of fresh air for the range and an emotional beacon for the brand’s long-lasting fans and customers. The range of emotions runs deep: desire for a product, pride for having made the right choice for the right price, satisfaction in consuming differently.\n\nToday, Dacia opens a new chapter while staying true to its customers, growing and changing just as they do. Dacia takes them to a world of adventure, carried by an ‘outdoor’ undercurrent that fulfils a deep need of escape, freedom, and authenticity.\n\nDacia is going to simplify and modernize its entire range thanks to the central, Alliance-based CMF-B modular platform. Through it, bigger models than the current designs will become a reality and the whole range will benefit from the best prices on the latest technological modules from Renault Group and the Alliance.\n\nBecause it doesn't make sense to give up on the very fundamentals and ‘foolproof’ business model that are behind Dacia’s success: the ‘design-to-cost’ approach whereby vehicles are designed to meet the precise needs of customers and the market; or its ability to ‘throw away the rule book’ in all instances.\n\nThe Bigster Concept show-car is a prime example: roomy, robust, meant for open air and dusty roads, exploring new horizons. It’s the very essence of a 4.6 meters SUV with no more, no less than the essential.\n\nWith 5 seats, it features simple yet modern lines that show the car has nothing to hide. They hint at the generously spacious interior, which is the best for the category. With the signature Y-shaped lighting now larger and more present, and the distinctive bodywork protectors, the overall look is assertively robust. The look is highlighted by the use of genuine materials, nothing artificial, no chrome finish or faux aluminium, but rather raw recycled plastics.\n\nDacia will embrace the new model to take on new horizons as of 2025 by moving onwards and upwards to C-segment vehicles; a whole new ballpark, but a game changer nonetheless. Harnessing tried-and-tested building blocks of past successes, it will remain modern and focused on simple, genuine, robust design. Future figurehead of the Dacia range, it will come in both alternative-energy and hybrid engines, meaning the brand will always be perfectly in sync with changing regulation and vehicle use.\n\nWinning new business in Europe, in a new segment with new customers is made possible thanks to more thorough integration within Renault Group – the rationale behind the announced creation of the Dacia business unit as part of the ‘Renaulution’ strategic plan – albeit in a distinct brand environment.\n\nRead the Dacia press release\n\nFollowing its recent revival, the Alpine brand is now ready to shift up a gear as it moves on to become a new generation automotive brand, with profit targets set for 2025. Building on its legacy to better leap into the future, it is a trail blazer when it comes to sportiness on the racetrack with the Formula 1 and on the open road with its ‘dream garage’ line-up of lightweight, exclusive, and innovative all-electric models.\n\nThe A110 Berlinette, rallies, the Dieppe factory, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, ... Alpine is a recognized brand, with its own history and pedigree, a reputation built up on victories and titles. A brand that strikes a chord in the hearts of automobile enthusiasts, especially in France. Alpine, however, is not a nostalgic brand that is bogged down in the past. Forward-looking more than ever before, it is made even stronger by bringing together several existing entities within Renault Group:\n\nRenault Sport Cars and its team of 300 people who are masters at developing sports cars. They gave the Group iconic products such as the R5 Turbo, the Clio V6, the Megane R.S. Trophy and … the new Alpine A110.\n\nRenault Sport Racing, with its Formula 1 team, bringing together 1,200 people, including leading specialists in aerodynamics, mechanics, and powertrain engineers.\n\nAlpine’s commitment to Formula 1 will kick off with the 2021 racing season and representing a unique opportunity to enhance Alpine’s branding globally: worldwide notoriety garnered from being part of the world’s leading motor sport discipline, reaching half a billion fans and drawing the who’s who of drivers.\n\nAnother growth channel is through enhanced synergies between Renault Group and the Alliance. The main example being the Dieppe plant, which is highly specialised and at the cutting edge of customisation. Not to mention cutting edge technology such as state-of-the-art platforms, a global distribution network, and the weight of the full range of financial services offered by RCI Bank and Services, that further strengthen the distribution potential of both the brand and its models.\n\nIn fact, the Alpine brand will soon have its own full range, a ‘dream garage’ made up of exclusive and futuristic sport cars: it is what dreams are made of, and these dreams come true. The new generation Alpine models will benefit greatly from Formula 1 technology and know-how. Above all, it will take a radical turn within the segment as it goes all-electric.\n\nAs brand icon, the A110 will stay in the line-up as an updated model developed in partnership with Lotus, also a lightweight sport car specialist. It will be joined by a B-segment compact sports car and a C-segment crossover, both built around the Alliance’s electrical platforms. These models will be fitted with highly efficient electric powertrains that seamlessly connect to the ‘road and network’ for an unbeatable driving experience.\n\nAlpine’s future is electric. A brand where racing, in general, and Formula 1, as a hybridization laboratory, are at the heart of the strategy. A brand set to become a major asset for Renault Group.\n\nRead the Alpine press release\n\nAt a time when the automotive sector is undergoing radical change, Renault Group is harnessing Mobilize to transform the disruptive environment into sustainable profit avenues. Combining mobility and energy management services, financial services, and data management services, Mobilize goes beyond cars. The brand addresses new needs and promotes sustainable energy ecosystems, targeting customers who wish to adopt more sustainable, shared forms of mobility. Mobilize benefits from dedicated engineering, design, quality, and product development teams. By developing its own range of offers under its own brand name – vehicles included – it aims at contributing more than 20% of Renault Group turnover in 2030.\n\nWith its unique combination of hardware and software, purpose-designed vehicles and services in open ecosystems, Mobilize will offer flexible transport solutions for both people and goods, adapted to the evolving expectations of end customers, companies, cities, and regional governments. It will address concrete issues by providing new solutions that go hand in hand with traditional car purchase practices.\n\nIts energy ecosystems and smart charging solutions will help drive the energy transition and boost electrical mobility. Used in smart islands, smart cities, or smart territories, they will help in reaching carbon neutrality.\n\nThe circular economy will, of course, be at the heart of the brand, thanks to Renault's recognised know-how in terms of EV battery lifetime management and use in second-life applications. But also with the new Re-Factory in Flins, serving as the primary support division for vehicle reconditioning and battery management. As such, Mobilize will help in extending vehicle life cycles.\n\nMobilize already has a strong competitive edge as it enters the mobility market. It builds on the expertise within Renault Group as vehicle designer and manufacturer and as a European leader for electric vehicles. In addition, with a potential of more than 6,000 Renault dealerships in Europe, Mobilize will be able to offer mobility solutions for use ranging from one minute to several years, in cities and towns throughout the region. Lastly, RCI Bank and Services is a privileged partner with whom Mobilize provides easy access to financial solutions and services.\n\nThe Mobilize EZ-1 Prototype is a prime example of the brand's identity as a future urban mobility solution designed for shared use. It embodies the brand's design vision: service at the heart of vehicle design. Even the commercial model is innovative: users will only pay for what they use, in terms of drive-time or mileage. The vehicle is connected: it comes with keyless access and interacts with users via their smartphone.\n\nEZ-1 is a compact and agile electric vehicle for 2 people. Its architectural model means the vehicle is only 2.3 metres long and has a minimal footprint. Top-to-bottom glass doors give EZ-1 users an unhindered view on the surrounding urban landscape. Agile, dynamic and inclusive, it blends into the urban world. EZ- 1 Prototype features an innovative battery exchange system. This alternative to the traditional charging infrastructure means the vehicle can be used non-stop.\n\nThe future EZ-1 production model will be made according to circular economy principles, using 50% recycled materials and with a recycling capacity of 95%. Standard bearer of the brand's values, it will lead the way for a whole range of models all uniquely adapted to varying mobility needs.\n\nRead the Mobilize press release"
