        "text": "The period from 1919 to 1939 also brought significant growth in automobile manufacturing in Europe, though on a considerably smaller scale than in the United States. The European industry was moving in the same directions as the American industry, toward a mass market for motor vehicles, but it made slower progress for a variety of reasons: lower living standards with less purchasing power, smaller national markets, and more restrictions in tax and tariff policies. Still, the same trend toward concentration was discernible. British automotive production rose from 73,000 in 1922 (both private and commercial vehicles) to 239,000 in 1929, while the number of producers declined from 90 to 41. Three firms—Austin, Morris, and Singer—controlled 75 percent of the British market in 1929.\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 29, 2024, 11:43 PM ET (New York Times)\n\nJapan Built Thailand’s Car Industry. Now China Is Gunning for It.\n\nThe apparent analogy to the American experience was temporary. British production had not yet reached the level at which the economies of scale gave the larger firms as commanding a lead as in the United States. There were other factors that created a somewhat different situation. During the 1930s British automotive production continued to increase steadily, in contrast to American production, and so the smaller companies were not forced to compete for a shrinking market. Output reached almost half a million in 1937, and at the end of the decade there were six major British producers instead of three: Morris, Austin, Standard, Rootes, Ford, and Vauxhall. The last two represented entry by American firms. Vauxhall had been bought by GM in 1925; Ford had been in Britain since 1911, had lost ground in the 1920s, and had later recovered. The Rootes Group, based on Hillman and Humber, was a combine formed by a family that had built a large automobile sales concern and then moved from sales to production. The replacement of Singer by Standard was simply the rise of one company and the decline of another, as evidence that open competition could still change the structure of the British automotive industry.\n\nIn France three major firms—Peugeot, Renault, and Citroën—emerged in the 1920s. Citroën accounted for 40 percent of French automotive production in 1925 but had reached that dominating position at the cost of financial stability. When André Citroën died before the decade ended, his company came into the hands of Michelin Tire. A new French firm, Simca, rose to prominence in the 1930s. The German automobile industry suffered from the dislocation of World War I and Germany’s subsequent economic difficulties. The major developments of the 1920s were the merger of Daimler and Benz in 1926, after the founders of those firms had died (their bitter rivalry for the distinction of being the inventor of the gasoline automobile made any such union during their lifetimes unthinkable), and the entry of General Motors onto the German scene through the acquisition of the Adam Opel company in 1929. The Germans were ardent admirers of Henry Ford and his methods, which they termed Fordismus, but Ford never succeeded in becoming a power in the German automotive world. During the 1930s the Nazi regime sought to emulate Ford by undertaking mass production of a low-priced car, the Volkswagen, but the onset of war interrupted this project. Italian automobile manufacturers gained a reputation for highly engineered sports cars and racing cars, but Italy had no mass market and therefore achieved only small-scale production at that time.\n\nThe industry in the United States\n\nAt the end of World War II the American automobile industry had intact facilities, somewhat enlarged by construction for military needs. There was also a great demand for automobiles. This situation invited several attempts by newcomers to enter the industry, but all proved unsuccessful. The most promising, Kaiser-Frazer Corporation, lasted some 10 years but lacked the financial, technical, and sales resources to compete when the automobile market returned to normal. By the mid 1950s Kaiser-Frazer had stopped producing everything but Willys Jeeps, an operation that it had acquired by buying Willys-Overland. The manufacture of Jeeps continued as a subsidiary of Kaiser Industries until 1970, when the division was sold to American Motors Corporation (AMC) in a transaction that gave Kaiser financial interest in AMC.\n\nThe trend of the automotive industry to mergers and large-scale organization, and to a situation in which each producer could affect but not control the market, continued unchecked. In 1954 Nash and Hudson joined to form AMC. The company enjoyed temporary prosperity in the late 1950s when it introduced the first American compact car, the Rambler, in response to growing imports of small foreign cars. A merger of Studebaker and Packard in 1954 was less successful. The new company stopped production in the United States in 1964 and in Canada two years later.\n\nDeclining sales and heavy financial losses pushed the Chrysler Corporation close to bankruptcy in the late 1970s. Attempting to avert the company’s collapse, the U.S. government granted Chrysler $1.5 billion in loan guarantees. In return Chrysler surrendered supervisory control to the government’s Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board. By exercising such control, the U.S. government became a de facto partner of the country’s third largest automaker. The government’s influence was short-lived as Chrysler, under the leadership of Lee A. Iacocca, returned to profitability and repaid its government loans in 1983, seven years early.\n\nBy the early 1980s the automotive industry in the United States was concentrated in four major firms—GM, Ford, Chrysler, and AMC—and one important manufacturer of commercial vehicles, International Harvester Company. A few producers of specialized vehicles remained, along with an assortment of companies that made automotive parts and components.\n\nIncreasing competition from imported cars and from new manufacturing operations established by European and Japanese firms continued to reduce the share of the American market controlled by the four domestic manufacturers through the remainder of the 20th century. Germany’s Volkswagen opened an assembly operation in the United States in the late 1970s but closed it a decade later. Japan’s Nissan Motor Corporation established a plant in the early 1980s to build its popular small pickups and later added car production. Another Japanese automaker, Honda Motor Company, followed with a car manufacturing operation adjacent to its motorcycle plant; it later added a second car facility in the United States and a car plant in Canada. Japan’s Toyota Motor Corporation formed a joint venture with GM called New United Motor Manufacturing Incorporated, which built small cars for both Toyota and GM. Toyota also opened two plants of its own in the United States—one for cars and small vans and the other for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles—and a car-making facility in Canada. A number of other Japanese manufacturers opened plants in the United States as joint-venture operations.\n\nMany of the Japanese-owned American plants were built in response to limitations imposed on exports of cars to the United States by Japan’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The restrictions followed threats of sanctions by the United States in the wake of Chrysler’s near collapse and heavy losses by Ford and GM. Called the Voluntary Restraint Agreement (VRA), it spelled out how many cars each Japanese producer could ship to the United States in a single year. The VRA took effect in 1981 and was renewed annually through the early 1990s. A similar agreement was in effect in Canada during the 1980s.\n\nIn 1979 Renault of France acquired a 46 percent interest in AMC to increase its small presence in the United States and gain access to AMC’s line of popular Jeep vehicles. Mounting financial pressures, however, prompted Renault to sell its AMC stake to a reinvigorated Chrysler in 1987. Chrysler quickly acquired all outstanding AMC stock and made the company a division. In 1998 Chrysler was merged with Germany’s Daimler-Benz AG, which then became DaimlerChrysler AG; the joint venture ended in 2007.\n\nIn 2008 the U.S. auto industry seemed close to collapse amid the global financial crisis. Through the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), billions in loans were made available to GM, Chrysler, and Ford; only the last automaker did not accept the government relief. Despite the assistance, GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 2009. It emerged from bankruptcy reorganization the following month and went through a period of downsizing that helped it rebound. Chrysler also filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and shortly thereafter the Italian automaker Fiat bought a share of the automaker, eventually becoming a majority shareholder in 2011.\n\nTechnically, the initial decades after World War II were marked by improvement and refinement rather than by important innovation. Diesel engines were increasingly used on trucks and buses. Automatic transmissions became virtually standard equipment for passenger cars, and power brakes and power steering found widespread acceptance, as did luxury features such as air-conditioning. In the early 1960s Chrysler experimented with a gas turbine engine for passenger automobiles, but it had too many technical problems for general use. By the early 21st century, automakers were facing new design issues, as growing concerns about climate change had resulted in a push for more fuel-efficient cars, including electric vehicles.\n\nStyling became increasingly important in automotive design as a marketing device. The general trend in styling became established late in the 1920s when cars began to lose their square, boxlike lines and to develop flowing curves. In time the new design encompassed both body and chassis, integrating such formerly separate features as mudguards, running boards, and bumpers. A combination of pressures made American cars of the 1950s high-powered and ornate, with extravagant use of chrome and exaggerated tail fins; these features were abandoned when the public found the simpler lines of imported cars more attractive."
