        "text": "Annual Driver Power owner satisfaction survey results out\n\nA mixture of brands at the top, with five nationalities in the top five\n\nSubaru tops the charts, followed by Tesla\n\nSome household names take a tumble\n\nSurvey shows reliability isn’t linked to cost\n\nHow reliable is your car?\n\nThe results of the annual Driver Power owner satisfaction survey are in, revealing which car manufacturers build the most reliable cars.\n\nIt’s Japanese brand Subaru that’s come out triumphant, topping the survey with five outright category wins and only two of 36 categories outside the top five.\n\nThe Driver Power survey is conducted by our sister brand, Auto Express, and asks thousands of new car buyers to share their thoughts and real-world experiences of the vehicles they own.\n\nOwners are quizzed on their car’s reliability, interior space, safety features, value-for-money and driving experience, building up a picture of the new car market in the UK as ranked by real car-buyers – not just road-testing journalists.\n\nPaul Barker, editor of Auto Express, said: “Subaru may not be the most high-profile of brands, but owners have made it clear they’re delighted with their car’s practicality, safety, reliability and quality, among other key attributes.\n\n“It’s great to hear the people that have put their own money into buying and owning these cars are so happy with their purchase, and it’s interesting that the top five has such a cross-section of brand – with Tesla, Kia, Porsche and Citroen rounding out the top five – showing that satisfaction is far from linked to cost or prestige.”\n\nThe results of the manufacturer rankings come after the survey ranked the Dacia Duster as the best individual car to own in the UK.\n\nMost and least reliable car brands revealed\n\nHere’s the full list of manufacturer rankings:\n\nSubaru 90.66%\n\nTesla 90.55%\n\nKia 89.35%\n\nPorsche 89.16%\n\nCitroen 88.22%\n\nPeugeot 88.03%\n\nMazda 88.01%\n\nToyota 87.74%\n\nJaguar 87.72%\n\nLand Rover 87.63%\n\nHonda 87.56%\n\nLexus 87.17%\n\nAlfa Romeo 86.86%\n\nBMW 86.69%\n\nNissan 86.54%\n\nVolvo 86.48%\n\nHyundai 86.36%\n\nCupra 86.28%\n\nSuzuki 86.26%\n\nMINI 86.26%\n\nMitsubishi 86.09%\n\nDacia 86.01%\n\nSkoda 86.00%\n\nSEAT 85.84%\n\nMercedes 85.55%\n\nVauxhall 85.50%\n\nAudi 85.43%\n\nRenault 85.30%\n\nVolkswagen 84.80%\n\nFord 84.58%\n\nFiat 84.13%\n\nMG 82.01%\n\nWhile in some previous years, Japanese brands have dominated the top 10, the sands have shifted a little. Subaru at the top is indeed a Japanese company, but it’s followed very closely by Tesla (USA), Kia (South Korea), Porsche (Germany), and Citroen (France).\n\n5. Citroen\n\nCitroen’s performance in Driver Power is impressive, with the Citroen C4 actually topping the charts in 2023’s survey as the best car to own. The brand took second place for running costs, servicing and insurance. Just 15.1% of owners reported faults with their cars, too.\n\n4. Porsche\n\nSuper-premium Porsche is known for building amazing drivers’ cars, so it’s no surprise that it ranked second in the ride and handling category as well as taking a category win for finish quality. Around 36% of owners reported faults, with value-for-money proving the most difficult category for this posh brand.\n\n3. Kia\n\nKia’s long been happy to trust in the reliability of its cars, with its seven-year manufacturer warranty one of the longest in the UK. It’s impressively consistent in Driver Power with only one category score outside the top 10. Just 24.3% of owners reported faults with their vehicles.\n\n2. Tesla\n\nTesla’s build quality may have been ridiculed in the past but it doesn’t seem to have put owners off, with the all-electric American brand ranking first in powertrains, mpg and running costs and infotainment. While 37.9% of owners reported faults with their vehicles, Tesla excels in enough categories to cancel this out.\n\n1. Subaru\n\nSubaru’s sales in the UK are minimal, and it’s a brand that seems to pass many buyers by. But with five category wins, and only two categories outside the top five, Subaru excels in every department other than fuel economy and acceleration. A deserving win for an oft-forgotten car manufacturer.\n\nThe bottom of the table makes for grimmer reading. The lowest scores were returned by MG, a British brand but owned and operated by a Chinese company. Worse still, while there are just 6.53 percentage points separating 1st place and 31st place, MG in 32nd is a full 2.12 percentage points lower still.\n\nThe rest of the bottom five is rounded out by Fiat, Ford, Volkswagen and Renault – household names all, with Volkswagen especially being one of the largest manufacturers in the world."
