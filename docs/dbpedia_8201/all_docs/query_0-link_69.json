        "text": "What a journey the last 1000 days have been! From experiencing historical loss in 2020, we‚Äôve achieved a record operating margin of 7.9% and generated ‚Ç¨3bn of free cash flow in 2023! Today I wanted to express my gratitude to the people of Renault Group for making the #Renaulution a reality. You can all be proud of yourselves! I would also like to thank Renault Group‚Äôs board of directors for their support and our shareholders who renewed their trust in me for a second mandate. When I started the Renaulution 4 years ago, the company was at its lowest point. We started our Resurrection phase by undertaking structural work on performance, while the Renovation was about putting the product at the center of the company. We also announced that we would turn Renault Group into a next-gen automotive company, focused on a team of teams, for 5 specific sports: #EV, #software, #circulareconomy, #mobility services, and #ICE. Since then, we‚Äôve set Renault Group back where it deserves: at the forefront of innovation. In only one year, we have carved out HORSE and launched Ampere. We've also prepared the best range in 30 years, with 10 launches this year alone, and set up more than 20 partnerships. But don't count on us to stop here! With our program \"Speed of Lightness\", we aim to accelerate on a dozen key processes in our company. Thanks to this program, our new Twingo will be developed in 2 years instead of 3 or 4! I can‚Äôt wait to write the next chapter with our bold and passionate teams. Now, on to the next challenge! Check out our 2024 car lineup : https://lnkd.in/eU-iMsAN\n\nüëè üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè I actually quoted Luca de Meo a few months ago, and I'm going to do it again: \"For the automotive industry, the age-old mantra was scale and efficiency. Now a new imperative has come to light: innovation and strategic agility.\" \"Now we have to excel in several disciplines with very different and specific requirements: electric vehicles, software, mobility services, the circular economy‚Ä¶\" Every single word is correct. But doing it is where the challenge is. This new ecosystem we live in which has an emphasise on software has brought in new challenges such as safety and cybersecurity. This shift has created a breakdown in communication due to different 'tribes' of people now in the product development process. This has created a new skill requirement which is the ability to communicate and work across teams that have different communication styles and understanding of priorities. This is why having someone/a team of people who understand the critical details between the moving parts to create a robust, forward thinking strategy and STICKS TO IT! As well, this strategy needs to come from the TOP down, with every layer buying into the strategy. The journey to the vision is never problem free, but having the belief and being brave to stick to it is the key. Well done to the team at Renault Group, they have created a clear strategy and are implementing it, (which by the way is not as common as you might think!) #ElectricVehicles #AutonomousDriving #SoftwareDefinedVehicles #Automotive\n\nThis year General Meeting of Shareholders was the occasion to reflect on the significant milestones achieved during 1000 days of Renaulution. Amidst industry upheavals and global challenges, Renault Group has rebounded with resilience, from significant losses to a historical margin. The #Renaulution was fueled by strategic collaborations aimed at driving innovation and market expansion. Over 20 partnerships were established in the last four years, including with industry leaders like Google and Qualcomm, LGES and LGe, CATL and Envision, and also GEELY and Dongfeng. We also reorganized and reloaded our Alliance with Nissan Motor Corporation and Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. Over the past 1000 days, we launched 22 new models, revitalizing our product lineup and capturing market share across Europe. Notably, our focus on #electrification has resulted in over 50% of our vehicles being pure EVs, aligning with our vision for a sustainable future. However, our journey is far from over. With a steadfast commitment to innovation, sustainability, and building a next-gen automotive company, Renault Group is poised to lead the industry into a new era of excellence. This is what Luca de Meo's #LettertoEurope is all about: the necessity of collective action and partnerships between the public and private sectors, for a sustainable, inclusive, and competitive automotive industry in Europe and beyond.\n\n2024 is going to be a pivotal year for Renault Group and the automotive industry! We have closed the chapter of our turnaround : historic first-half results, a reset Alliance, and an exceptional new line-up that is really going to hit the showrooms in the coming months, including the iconic Renault 5, a landmark for EV democratization in Europe! However, we have no illusion for the next chapter: after the emergence of EV pure-player competitors in the West, 2023 confirmed China‚Äôs rise in the East. The global automotive landscape is more challenging than ever, especially for European OEMs. Between price wars, economic & geopolitical instability, and a deteriorating market context in Europe, 2024 will be no walk in the park. Renault is ready to cope with it, with the discipline it has been demonstrating in the last years. It will keep on executing its transformation into a next-gen automotive company, after the carve-outs of HORSE and Ampere, the most sophisticated response of the European automotive industry to the rising challenges. And we will not stop here, increasingly moving towards new value chains, adjacent to our traditional playing field! Energy, circular economy, infrastructure, etc. We will tell you more in the coming weeks! The current tectonic shifts also require us to play a team sport because the energy transition and the digital transition, cut across the traditional sectors. To play at its best level, Europe‚Äôs auto industry needs public authorities to orchestrate the various players rather than piling up regulations. We need a real industrial policy for automotive in Europe! Renault Group is ready to engage in a constructive dialogue and I will be publishing propositions in a few days! In these defining times, don‚Äôt count on me and the team of the Renault Group to stick to the status quo. We are here today not only to lead the game but also to reinvent it! #RenaultGroup #NextGen #Ampere #Horse\n\n‚ÄúE-mobility is a team sport,‚Äù stated Luca de Meo, CEO of Renault, yesterday at the Annual Reception of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). This is exactly what we had in mind when we suggested to organise a Board-to-Board meeting between our organisations (the first of its kind) to discuss how we can work together to improve the experience of our customers. #EVcharging and the automotive side are not only part of the same ecosystem: they‚Äôre also part of the same customer journey. We are in it together: let‚Äôs collaborate to make the customer experience seamless. üí™ There‚Äôs an ecosystem to build: we, the industry, can take the matter in our own hands, and self-organise to do it! Following this first Board-to-Board exchange, we look forward to continuing the dialogue and collaboration with the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).\n\nHow do you respond to change? \"Adapting\" was the word that keeps on being said by Renault Group CSO during the Panel Discussion at GEC 24 London. His response on how Renault Group, a French multinational automotive manufacturer, plays in the EV race? Acknowledging that \"it is a new sport\". Few key pointers: ‚Ä¢smart capital allocation ‚Ä¢horizontal cooperation ‚Ä¢attitude of being humble He recognized that the group can't do everything, so they find credible and technically competent partners who share the same purpose, who are co-responsible in the journey to decarbonize, sharing both benefits and risks - a strategic partnership approach. Grateful that I could watch this insightful conversation through Linkedin LIVE. What's your thought on strategic partnership approach? #decarbonize #EV #supplychain #strategicpartnership #collaboration #playyourstrength #agilemindset\n\n#RenaultGroup released record results for 2023 with a strong improvement af all its financials: ‚ÜóÔ∏è +18% growth vs 2022 at constant change ‚ÜóÔ∏è Record operating margin: 7.9%, at the top of the financial guidance and 2 points above our initial guidance (raised in June 2023) ‚ÜóÔ∏è Record free cash flow: ‚Ç¨3bn, largely exceeding our financial guidance and ‚Ç¨1bn above our initial guidance ‚ÜóÔ∏è Net result: +‚Ç¨3.0bn vs 2022 ‚ÜóÔ∏è Record ROCE: more than x2 vs. 2022, from 0% in 2021 to 28.5% in 2023 ‚ÜóÔ∏è Significant increase of the dividend: ‚Ç¨1.85, +‚Ç¨1.60 vs last year Happy to be part of that success story! And we will not stop there: In 2024, we will benefit from a strong momentum with 6 launches in Germany. Renault is back! üí™ #renaulution #teamwork #automotive\n\nFor the 10 days, we will present the founding story of France's leading companies. Today is the second day, and it's about Renault Group! Once upon a time in 1898, in the land of croissants and the Eiffel Tower, visionary brothers, Louis, Marcel, and Fernand Renault, decided that horses were so pass√©. Thus, they embarked on a journey to revolutionize transportation with something a bit more...mechanical. Enter the Renault Voiturette, the first car produced by the Renault Fr√®res, literally kick-starting the engine of the automotive industry in France. The Renault Group story is a mix of innovation, family drama, and a touch of French flair. Imagine Louis Renault driving his Voiturette up the steep Rue Lepic in Montmartre, not just to show off but to secure his first sale. It was the equivalent of dropping the mic at a Parisian salon. The Renault brothers weren't just carmakers; they were pioneers of the first Grand Prix races, essentially turning the streets of France into the Fast & Furious of the early 1900s. But it wasn't all smooth driving. World Wars saw the Renault factories pivot dramatically to produce tanks, airplanes, and even tractors, showcasing a resilience and adaptability that's quintessentially French. Through ups and downs, including nationalization and then privatization, Renault has maintained its je ne sais quoi, merging with Nissan Motor Corporation at the turn of the millennium to become a global automotive powerhouse. This alliance was less about creating a Franco-Japanese fusion cuisine and more about sharing a recipe for success in the competitive world of car manufacturing. So, here's to Renault Group ‚Äì from a humble voiturette to a leader in electric vehicles, they've shown that with a bit of ingenuity (and perhaps a glass of Bordeaux in hand), the road to innovation is best traveled together. Stay tuned for more inspiring tales of innovation mixed with a dash of humor from France's manufacturing legends! For more details on Renault's fascinating journey, please visit... https://lnkd.in/eRdZbv9T https://lnkd.in/eSSeaqar #renault #nissan #FrenchInnovation #AutoInnovatorsJourney #EuroInnovators\n\nRenault posted a better-than-expected operating profit for the first half of the year as reported, due to strong pricing and new vehicle launches, and stuck to its full-year profit-margin forecast. The French automaker reported that its first-half sales volume rose +1.9% versus the same period in 2023 due to the strong performance of hybrid models in Europe, its key region. ‚ÄúThese record results are the fruit of a considerable work made by the Renault Group teams over the last years. Our efforts to reduce costs and focus our commercial policy on value are reflected in a new line-up, the best one that this company has had in 3 decades. We have implemented the traditional levers of performance improvement, but we have also reconnected the company with the innovative mindset that once made its golden years‚Äù, said Luca de Meo, CEO of Renault Group.
