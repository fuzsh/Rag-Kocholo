        "text": "On August 14, Polestar announced that production of its luxury SUV, Polestar 3, has started in Ridgeville, South Carolina. This makes the Polestar 3 the first Polestar to be produced on two continents.\n\nThe Ridgeville plant produces cars for customers in the U.S. and Europe, avoiding recent tariff hikes, while existing production continues in Chengdu, China.\n\n“Manufacturing Polestar 3 in the USA is a crucial step for us,” said Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath. “Exporting the South Carolina produced Polestar 3 to Europe will strengthen our business on a broader scope. I strongly believe this is the best looking and best driving SUV in the market today.”\n\nThe company is taking additional steps to widen its manufacturing footprint, with production of Polestar 4 set to start in South Korea from the middle of 2025.\n\nPolestar, whose cars are available online in 27 markets globally across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, plans to have a line-up of five performance EVs by 2026.\n\n(Polestar release on August 14, 2024)\n\nOn August 8, Renault announced at the Interlagos festival in Brazil that the C-segment SUV that it plans to launch in the country in 2025 is already in the advanced phase of development. The vehicle is part of the BRL 2 billion investment previously announced by Renault.\n\nThe SUV will use the same modular platform as the Kardian, the CMF-B, and will be the first C-segment vehicle manufactured in Brazil, from where it will be exported to the rest of Latin America.\n\nAccording to Ricardo Gondo, president of Renault for Latin America, the vehicle is in the virtual simulation stage and the prototypes are expected to be manufactured at the Sao Jose dos Pinhais plant by the end of 2024.\n\n(multiple sources on August 8, 2024)"
