        "text": "In a proactive move towards sustainable practices and compliance with evolving regulations, Renault Group is intensifying its involvement in the circular economy for automobiles. The company, a pioneer in addressing circular economy challenges for cars, is now applying for the establishment of an Individual System to uphold its Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) from the Renault, Dacia, and Alpine brands. This strategic initiative aligns with the Anti-Waste and Circular Economy (AGEC) Act in France, reinforcing requirements for the collection and recycling of ELVs across the country.\n\nRenault Group, leveraging over a decade of active contribution to the ELV industry, aims to solidify its position as an expert in eco-design, the utilization of recycled materials, and end-of-vehicle life management.\n\nRenault’s existing responsible ELV management system, implemented years ago through its dealer network and partner car recycling centers, is evolving with the adoption of the Individual System. This commitment extends beyond improving ELV processing to accelerating the recycling of materials and the reuse of parts from end-of-life vehicles.\n\nCollaborating with INDRA Automobile Recycling, France’s leading ELV management network, Renault Group intends to maximize the collection, recycling, and recovery of ELVs. INDRA, recognized for its nearly 40 years of expertise in vehicle recycling and its extensive network of nearly 340 ELV centers, will be responsible for collecting ELVs from private individuals and business users through its goodbye-car.com service. The partnership underscores Renault Group’s confidence in INDRA as a key player in the ELV sector.\n\nRenault Group also leverages the expertise of its subsidiary, The Future Is NEUTRAL, specializing in the circular economy for cars across the entire value chain. The Future Is NEUTRAL develops comprehensive solutions for recycling materials, reusing parts, and promoting resource neutrality in the automotive industry.\n\nFlorence Bailleul, CEO of INDRA, expressed, “It is a huge honor for INDRA to see its solution chosen by Renault Group. This partnership highlights the relevance of our solutions for collecting and processing ELVs, as well as our leadership in this field and our ability to design and deliver tailor-made solutions for any player in the automotive sector looking to comply with the regulations or to even go further.”\n\nJean-Philippe Bahuaud, CEO of The Future Is NEUTRAL, commented on Renault Group’s decision to establish an Individual System, stating, “The decision by Renault Group to set up an Individual System is a natural fit with its sustainable development strategy. It meets regulatory challenges and – above all – satisfies its ambition to make the circular economy part of every stage in the life cycle of its vehicles. The Future Is NEUTRAL makes available the expertise and know-how of its operating subsidiaries to Renault Group and the automotive industry. It provides specialist expertise in the collection and responsible processing of end-of-life vehicles, the recovery of parts and materials, and closed-loop recycling.”\n\nA Simple and Effective System for Environmental Objectives\n\nThe proposed system, in compliance with legal requirements, will be simple and free of charge for individuals. Private individuals can either drop off their ELVs at approved partner centers or request collection via the website goodbye-car.com. Approved ELV centers will manage the decontamination, dismantling, and sorting of parts for reuse or recycling by qualified operators, ensuring compliance with applicable regulations.\n\nSimultaneously, ELV centers will trace all incoming vehicles, mark recovered parts after dismantling, and oversee the traceability of carcasses sent to high-performance crushers. As part of a complementary approach, ELV centers and car crushers will ensure compliance with European targets for reuse and recovery. This system is poised to make a significant and lasting contribution to environmental objectives in France."
