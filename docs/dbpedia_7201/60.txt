Restoration World Premiere

Singer Herbert Jeffrey makes his cinematic debut in this long-unavailable film as the strapping young cowpoke who comes to the rescue of a traveling medicine show battling outlaws for buried treasure. Jeffrey would go on to play horse-riding heroes in several subsequent Westerns, garnering the nickname “The Bronze Buckaroo.” Filmed at a Black-owned ranch in Apple Valley, California, and also starring Spencer Williams (director of The Blood of Jesus and Dirty Gertie from Harlem, U.S.A.) and doo-wop quartet the Four Tones, Harlem on the Prairie packs thrills, romance, and comedy—chiefly thanks to Mantan Moreland and Flournoy E. Miller—into its economic hour-long runtime.
