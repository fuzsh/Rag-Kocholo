SUPPLEMENTARY FILM SCHEDULE

The two film reviews that will be required of you this term have a twofold purpose: they will help to supplement the class's range of reference to the era we study, and they will give you practice in writing concisely and thoroughly about film. To that end they should be no more than 500 words long (about one single-spaced page, typed). You should try in this space not only to summarize the film's plot but also to offer some observations about its relevance to our generic or cultural or theoretical concerns in class--and of course you should feel free to offer those observations in class and on the discussion board as well as in your reviews. Since I plan to post each review on the course web site for everyone's reference, I'll need to receive them electronically. It would probably be best for you to email them to me (fgrady@umsl.edu) as attachments, by the dates indicated. All movies listed are available via Netflix and and most via Blockbuster (with the exceptions marked by a superscript #); films marked by an asterisk I can lend to you if necessary.

An indispensable reference site for information about any film is the Internet Movie Database (us.imdb.com).
