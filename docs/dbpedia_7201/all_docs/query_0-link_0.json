Kahn.[1] The Bronze Buckaroo stars Black cowboy singer Herb Jeffries,[2][3] here billed as Herbert Jeffrey.[4]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nCowboy Bob Blake receives a letter from his friend Joe Jackson, asking for help. Blake and his men travel to Jackson's ranch, only to discover from Jackson's sister Betty that Joe has been missing for three weeks. Meanwhile, Jackson's ranch hand (Slim Perkins) is learning to use ventriloquism to make the farm animals talk, and tries to convince the gullible Dusty to buy a talking mule.\n\nBlake discovers that Jackson is being held by a local land grabbing rancher, Buck Thorne, who (with his partner Pete) has discovered gold on Jackson's ranch. They killed Joe's and Betty's father, and are trying to force Joe to deed the land over to Thorne. Blake develops a plan to rescue Jackson from where he is being held above the saloon, but runs into trouble. Betty sends Blake's men into the saloon as backup and is kidnapped by Thorne, who then threatens to kill Betty and Joe if they do not sign the deed. While Dusty rides for the sheriff, Blake and his men backtrack Betty's horse (who arrived home riderless). A gun battle ensues, with the sheriff arriving in the nick of time. The villains are hauled off to jail, and Blake rides into the sunset with Betty.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nHerb Jeffries as Bob Blake\n\nArtie Young as Betty Jackson\n\nRollie Hardin as Joe Jackson\n\nClarence Brooks as Buck Thorne\n\nF.
