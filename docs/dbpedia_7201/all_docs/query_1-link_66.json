        "text": "Page 206 →Page 207 →Seven. White Noise Historiographical Exceptionalism and the Construction of a White American Music History\n\nGlenda Goodman and Samuel Parler\n\n1\n\nThis historiographical tendency in US music studies reflects similar trends in the long history of US immigration. For instance, a backstop of settler colonial belonging can be found in Massachusetts governor John Winthrop’s “city on a hill” sermon, which in 1630 claimed for English settler colonists a divine justification to seize inhabited territory, and Page 208 →simultaneously celebrated and warned Englishmen and women to live up to the expectation that they would do good there. Native Americans existed, for English settler colonists, first as essential lifelines but quickly as foils against which an idealized, Christian, civilized, and white dominion could be forged.2 Ensuing decades saw a hardening of racial regimes; we might take as a second backstop the 1790 naturalization law, which dictated US citizenship as the purview of whites—a framing that required, of course, a belief in essential racial difference. The twin forces of welcome and exclusivity, of claiming immigrant exceptionalism as a blanket ideal and applying it in practice only to a select segment of the population, invests rhetoric about belonging with racial meaning. The specific composition of that racial meaning changed over time. As Matthew Frye Jacobson and others have argued, the whiteness of citizenship was a moving target, opening up to some and closing off others based on other economic, sociocultural, and political factors.3 However, one enduring point must be underscored: accompanying the celebration of immigrant diversity in the United States is the fact that, for some, diversification brought severely harmful consequences. For those who were forced to migrate in chains, and for those whose land was seized, the spread of US sovereignty did not just diversify America; it bleached and stripped the cultural landscape.\n\nThe bluntness of this evaluation is purposeful, for we wish to suggest that, to a large extent, US-focused musicology has not disentangled itself from exceptionalism and its attendant racial ideologies. Scholars seldom regard or evaluate white composers and musicians as representatives of a more generalized racial outlook, yet such an approach is common when writing about their nonwhite counterparts. Furthermore, when scholars themselves are white, racial identification with a white historical subject can unconsciously encourage an imagined familiarity, even when the historical circumstances for author and subject are vastly different, such that the implications of whiteness go unexamined. Alternatively, authors perceiving racial difference from their subject may be bound to reproduce that difference in the written word.4 As W. E. B. Du Bois suggested, double consciousness is rare among whites, because their experiences are the norm against which difference is defined. Indeed, what has been considered instead is the extent to which white composers’ music represents their unique experiences and identity—an expression of unexamined privilege if ever there was one, for what is more validating than to consider a person as an individual rather than as a representative of a larger group? This chapter takes aim at the indelible whiteness of historiographicalPage 209 → exceptionalism, which has not yet been fully diagnosed and analyzed.\n\nIdentifying the privilege of whiteness may help contain it. We do so through case studies of two iconic figures in US music history: eighteenth-century hymnodist William Billings and twentieth-century country musician Gene Autry. In juxtaposing these two figures, we are not endorsing a direct parallel between their experiences and contributions; the periods in which they lived were radically different, as were the specific politics of race in which they must be situated. The asymmetries between these two case studies permit a conversation about whiteness more broadly across historical periods.5 Moreover, we are not asking how these white men represent white men generally (for collapsing the individual into the whole would only replicate the problematic analyses to which minority composers have been treated), but to contest the universality of whiteness by examining how it was constructed historically and musically.\n\nIn what follows we submit that the connection between American exceptionalism and whiteness is evident in two ways. First, it is established through difference, with whiteness representing civilization and racialized “Others” suggesting barbarism and savagery. Second, these false binaries feed tacit and explicit exclusion, whereby nonwhite peoples are historiographically sidelined by lack of attention in scholarship. Our decision to focus on two white male figures might seem counterproductive for this second claim, but our contention is that, in addition to acknowledging the music and cultures of nonwhite peoples, it is also necessary to recognize canonic white figures as racialized subjects and as being in dialogue with nonwhite subjects. To move beyond historiographic exceptionalism, whiteness itself must be actively and deliberately deconstructed. By thematizing settler colonists’ land seizure as a triumph of whiteness over savagery, these musical traditions at once exemplify and excuse the violence that was inherent to the construction and naturalization of whiteness. Ironically, however, whiteness itself has been precarious, its contours and privileges constantly policed and renegotiated as the nation’s racial profile shifted. As these case studies reveal, assertions of whiteness have helped these men to escape other negative class identities—a topic to which we return at the end of the chapter.\n\nThe “Native” American Composer Billings\n\nPage 210 →interpolated historic events into assessments of his life and works. He is presented as a maverick mold-breaker whose life and works represent American values of liberal individualism. Gilbert Chase, for instance, claimed Billings’s famous statement, “I think it best for every Composer to be his own Carver,” found in the preface to the New-England Psalm-Singer (1770), was a “personal ‘declaration of independence.’”6 In fact, Billings’s astoundingly voluminous and distinctive output does set him apart from what came before. No one in British North America had published a single-author book of newly composed sacred music before Billings did so in 1770. Billings’s political affiliation with prominent patriots, among them Samuel Adams and Paul Revere, further bolsters the association between the composer and the Revolutionary cause. The originality of his compositions, his zest for paraphrasing sacred lyrics to make them applicable both for religious and for political interpretation, and his skill with crafting rhythmically energetic tunes, earned him a deserved place in the nation’s musical canon.7\n\nYet it is how Billings is presented in that canon that matters. However noteworthy his accomplishments, placing Billings at the beginning of a “maverick tradition” helps to create a canon based on reductive binaries—innovators versus conformists, provincial versus cosmopolitan—which set up a logic that makes it hard to see the blanketing whiteness of the tradition’s norms.8 Moreover, the standard interpretation of Billings masks several ways in which his music reifies whiteness by evacuating New England of Native Americans. The strategy of literal and figurative dispossession of Indigenous people of their land and their place in history was not necessarily conscious on Billings’s part; in fact, it is the implicit assumption that his position of primacy can be asserted in the context of an otherwise virgin (musical) landscape. This occurs in two ways. First, Billings is repeatedly framed, by himself in his own words and works as well as by others in writings about him, as the first “native” American composer.9 Second, in his own compositions he thematized exclusive white citizenship, initially through his presentation of Revolutionary patriotism, then later through thanksgiving hymns and anthems. It is important not to be seduced into normalizing the settler colonial logic of eliminating Indigenous peoples.10\n\nSeveral small clues tying Billings to Native exoticism and erasure surface once we think to look for them. Some are circumstantial, such as the fact that the men who staged the Boston Tea Party used the office of Billings’s first printers, Benjamin Edes and John Gill, to don their “Indian” costumes.11 Given that Billings’s closeness to patriots Samuel Page 211 →Adams and Paul Revere is taken to indicate his political beliefs, further confirmed by his compositions, the cultural trope of “playing Indian” as a form of rebellion should be added to the contextualizing evidence for Billings.12 He would have been familiar with such masquerading, even if he himself did not take part. Other ways in which Billings is “nativized” are more explicit. For example, in their landmark biography of William Billings, Richard Crawford and David McKay note the composer was deemed important because of “priority or local color,” meaning that he represented a “first” in US music history and was uniquely tied to New England.13 More than a century earlier, Nathaniel Gould made much the same claim in his important book on church music in New England, claiming that before 1770 “no native American had attempted to compose and publish a single tune, that we can ascertain.”14 Billings was indeed the first to publish a single-author collection of hymns. However, claims about his primacy and nativeness indicate one way in which his life and works have been turned to foster whiteness: in the guise of a quasi-patriotic celebration of an American-born composer, Billings-the-“native” becomes a cypher for settler colonialism.\n\nClaims of belonging that reinforced settler colonial priority in New England are evident in the material record of Billings’s publications, particularly in the ubiquity of New England place-names. The title page of the New-England Psalm-Singer labels Billings as a “native of Boston.” The word “native” used here indicates his place of birth (Billings was in fact born in Boston), and is striking because tunebook title pages did not conventionally acknowledge the composers’ places of origin. Inside the covers of this book, the many instances of place-names as titles to hymns might have, as Crawford and McKay claim, given his readers a pleasurable jolt of recognition. Perhaps these place-names, including “Brookline,” “Nantucket,” and “Hampshire,” reminded colonists of their regional identity, while generic titles such as “Freedom,” “Liberty,” and “Union” conjured abstract political ideals that were growing as discontent with the metropole intensified. Yet also undeniable, though little commented on, is the fact that such place-names confirmed the renaming that had been underway for over a century, as English towns crowded out Native Americans. Some titles, such as “Swanzey,” a contested and embattled site in King Philip’s War (1675–76), may have reminded colonists of the bloody contests over specific areas that had been carried out in wars between the English and local nations in previous generations.15 This is not to say that Billings’s claim to Boston as his home was hollow. One of his most affecting pieces, “Lamentation over Boston” from The Page 212 →Singing Master’s Assistant (1778), paraphrases a lamentation in Psalm 137 and passages from Jeremiah to express the deep remorse and pathos of expulsion from a homeland.16 Billings’s hymn is about the British occupation of Boston in 1775–76, and with its sensitive setting of the lyrics he depicted the utter dejection of loss. The opening, with its repeated phrases of “we wept” separated by pauses and its melismatic setting of “weeping,” evocatively expresses emotional devastation.17 Billings’s sincerity is not the question, however; instead, it is the authority with which he claims to speak, like his confederates, as a “native” of the area who had special and exclusive claim to the land.\n\nThemes of belonging are further developed in Billings’s final publication, The Continental Harmony (1794). Unlike Billings’s previous publications, thanksgiving looms large in this tunebook.18 This could be because the publication was funded through subscription by his friends and supporters in the hopes of alleviating the composer’s poverty—reason enough to express gratitude, although this reason is not explicitly highlighted in the pieces themselves. Thanksgiving is also a long-standing theme for Congregationalists, apparent in the first generations of Puritan colonists, who regularly called for days of fasting and of thanksgiving as they grappled with interpreting the signs from God about their progress toward becoming a society of visible saints.19 Generic praise for God is found in “St Enoch, for a Thanksgiving, after a Victory” and “Universal Praise: An Anthem for Thanksgiving, taken from Psalm 149.”20 Billings also included several anthems specifically for days of thanksgiving, which although still containing generic praise and gratitude, indicate an investment in a historical claim to belonging in New England.21\n\nThese claims are furthered in anthems that explicitly thematize the English landing in Plymouth and the dispossession of Native land. One, labeled “Suitable to be sung on the anniversary of our Fore-fathers’ landing, and for Thanksgiving,” attributes the successful conquest and colonization of New England to God’s plan with lyrics from Psalm 44 that begin: “We have heard with our ears, and our fathers have told us, / How thou didst drive out the heathen before them, and planted them, / for they got not the land by their sword, nor by their bow, / But [by] thy right hand and holy arm.”22 Lyrics that deliver an Old Testament message about a covenanted people struggling to make headway in a land of “heathens” take on a different connotation in the context of New England, where Puritan colonists believed they had a mandate from God to convert Native Americans and, in doing so, dispossessed them of their land. Another piece, “New Plymouth, for Pilgrims’ landing anniversary,” Page 213 →develops similar themes.23 The title is followed by an indication that it is “Suitable to be sung on the Anniversary of our Forefathers’ landing in New England, Nov. 20th. Anno Domini 1620,” recalling unequivocally a starting date to English claims to legitimate belonging. The lyrics, though from the Tate and Brady psalter and thus composed in England, take on a strongly colonialist valence in New England, with phrases such as “How thou to plant them here didst drive / The heathen from this land, / Dispeopl’d by repeated strokes of thy avenging hand.” To place the responsibility for “dispeopling” the land of Native Americans in order to make way for English Christian colonists on God’s shoulders not only absolved Englishmen and women of any whiff of doubt about whether the depopulation and dispossession that attended colonialism was justified, it also thematized the necessity of the demographic transformation of New England.\n\nThe thematization of nativeness and belonging found in Billings’s compositions indicates one mode through which whiteness was constructed in early American hymnody. By representing New England as a Protestant country, colonized with divine authorization, Billings erased Native Americans from the landscape. The same logic that called Billings “native” also underwrote white landownership, a cornerstone of the construction of white identity.24 Yet the possession of property was only tenuously held by Billings himself, whose social position was periodically precarious. While his music exemplifies confidence in the supremacy of white Christians in the face of so-called savages, his personal experiences demonstrate how precarious claims to white privilege were.\n\nBillings’s Insecurity and the Vulnerability of Whiteness\n\nAlthough Billings is much celebrated as a progenitor of American originality, his biography reveals that his actual life was marked by precariousness. In particular, his money troubles, in which he was not alone in the tremendously volatile economic period following the Revolution, made him financially vulnerable. Music historians highlight this fact, although rarely with sufficient context to elucidate his unexceptionality in this regard—many people lost a lot of money. Economic security and the ability to secure property, which Billings managed to achieve, were keyed to race; after all, enfranchisement was limited to those who were white, male, and propertied. Thus, Billings’s biography presents an opportunity to question how money helped to construct difference, and whether one who lost money might have also seemed to slip in other sorts of Page 214 →status. For although poverty is by no means predictive of future renown (and indeed, is integral to stereotypes about so-called starving artists), the historiographical treatment of Billings’s hardship has reinforced his exceptional status by marking him as particularly disadvantaged.\n\nFor much of his life, Billings earned his keep not just through music but as an artisan and menial worker. His father died when Billings was fourteen, and like many boys in families whose fortunes dropped dramatically, Billings became an apprentice. He learned the trade of leather tanning, which was messy and smelly work. As his biographers note, he learned music through singing schools and by studying tunebooks, and himself became a singing master. With the publication of the unrefined but astonishingly inventive New-England Psalm-Singer in 1770 and the more sophisticated Singing Master’s Assistant in 1778, Billings became well known in New England as a premier psalmodist as well as the singing master in fashionable Boston churches.25 He was able to marry, buy a house on a posh street in Boston, and buy a church pew—all achievements that confirmed his success. Social class was not established by financial resources alone, however, and Billings’s rise in prominence did not coincide with an elevation of his social position in the eyes of the elite.\n\nBillings either did not know the rules of polite society, failed to adequately abide by them, or did not wish to; whatever the case, his comportment was distinctly uncouth, according to both his critics and his admirers.26 His biographers have attempted to make sense of the contradictory evidence that he was popular, even famous, but also maligned. With varying degrees of defensiveness, they have commented on how he behaved when confronted with what one calls “class bias.”27 Indeed, nothing about Billings’s behavior or appearance aligned with eighteenth-century ideas of civility. Civility depended upon one’s knowledge and physical self-control: the ability to make amusing conversation, possessing polite bodily habits (such as refraining from blowing one’s nose in public, or making the correct kind of bow in greeting), and knowledge of social protocols (such as how to take tea) were just a few of the myriad rules governing polite society.28 Billings came into conflict with these rules when he tried to start a belletristic magazine titled the Boston Magazine. He managed to publish one issue of it before a group of prominent Boston clergymen and other gentlemen conspired to take over the periodical. At fault was Billings’s distinct lack of taste; although he intended the magazine to be “improving” and to appeal to gentlemen of “learning and leisure,” the results were unintentionally crude both in content Page 215 →and execution. The quality of printing was poor, and the literary materials he chose were sensational (particularly a gruesome story about a cannibalistic Scottish family). No reflections on art or higher sentiments could be found in the pages. Prominent men in Boston gossiped about the ill-conceived effort, swapping notes with each other ridiculing the periodical and Billings. How exactly the transfer of editorship transpired is unclear, but the following month they issued their own Boston Magazine, displaying the influence of British models such as the Spectator rather than the sensational muckrakers, and repudiating Billings’s previous effort.29\n\nBillings was marginal to elite society in Boston, and his physical appearance was partially responsible for his social status. Two historical sources mention Billings’s body: a diary kept by William Bentley, a contemporary of Billings, and Nathaniel Gould’s Church Music in America, published in 1853 but based on accounts from a person who saw Billings. From these two sources we know that Billings had some sort of disability. The two accounts agree that he was blind in one eye and that one of his legs was shorter than the other. Gould also claims that the composer had a “somewhat withered” arm. We might speculate about the cause of his impairments (perhaps Billings suffered an accident with the caustic materials used to tan leather, resulting in his partial blindness), but what is most noteworthy is how these physical differences were perceived. Both descriptions tie his appearance to his general temperament and character, indicating that his disabilities were of a piece with his general maladaptation to polite society. Bentley, who had met Billings in person, noted in his entry about Billings’s death that the composer “was a singular man,” who not only was “short of leg, with one eye,” but who also was “without any address, & with an uncommon negligence of person.” Bentley’s reflection suggests that Billings’s inability to present himself well was of a piece with his physical differences. It was not because Billings was disabled that his presentation was poor; rather, his disability was just one sign of his broader shortcoming. Thus, the ambiguous description “without any address” becomes especially telling, suggesting both his homelessness and his poverty of manners. As Bentley wrote, sympathetically, “He died poor & neglected & perhaps did too much neglect himself.”30\n\nBentley’s description of Billings highlights a general attitude toward physical differences in the eighteenth century. As historian Jennifer Van Horn notes, commonly held beliefs of the era were that “physical disabilities were the outward manifestations of internal moral failure. In medicalPage 216 → texts and politeness manuals, authors maintained that handicaps—referred to in the period as ‘defects’ and ‘deformities’—were God’s retribution for the person’s sins or the result of sustained ill behavior.”31 Yet when many men lost limbs fighting in the Revolution, the association of disability with immorality was challenged; without limbs it was hard to be self-sufficient, as well as display masculine tropes of civility and virility, but prostheses (particularly for lower limbs) helped to compensate for these losses. No prosthesis would have served Billings’s blindness or adequately compensated for his visible difference, for his was not only a matter of a missing limb but of an overall lack of civility.\n\nGould’s account of Billings’s appearance emphasizes this point. In a section titled “Billings’ [sic] Voice, Personal Appearance and Habits,” he labeled the composer “somewhat deformed in person,” and in addition to adding the possibility of an impairment in his arm, he claimed that these disabilities were matched by “a mind as eccentric as his person was deformed.” Implying not just that Billings was impolite and lacked civility, Gould suggested eccentricity on the path to mental illness or drug addiction. Billings was in the habit of taking enormous quantities of snuff, Gould wrote. Even this drug habit was not done in the correct manner: “Instead of taking it in the usual manner, with thumb and finger, would take out a handful and snuff it from between his thumb and clenched hand.” Thus Gould attaches Billings’s body to his temperament, as did Bentley, but takes it steps further in terms of moralizing and sensationalizing the composer, hitching physical disability to a general “deformity of his habits.”32 Eventually historians would use Billings’s disability part and parcel with what they saw as his ineptitude as a composer, as Charles Perkins and John Sullivan Dwight did when they labeled Billings the “American Cyclops.”33\n\nOn several fronts, Billings failed or was unable to meet the standards of embodied and enacted civility required for his acceptance into mainstream ideas about genteel masculinity in the early American republic. His social background, modes of earning an income, disastrous attempt to engage in polite letters, and physical appearance marked him as marginal to polite society. While music historians have noted his unusualness in terms of his compositional style, these social factors also mark him as an outsider. His marginality co-constituted the whiteness of early American hymnody. If Billings’s hymns exemplify whiteness presaged on the logics of settler colonialism that sought to remove nonwhite people from the land and replace them with those who upheld the cultural and Page 217 →political goals of European civilization, his biography showcases the precariousness of that white supremacy.\n\nWhiteness was fragile on an individual basis, as Billings shows. But it was also unstable discursively, for eighteenth-century ideas about race held that racial categorizations were mutable. Environmental theories of race argued that skin color and cultural attributes were flexible, could be changed based on exposure, and thus whiteness was at risk of darkening.34 For example, Samuel Stanhope Smith’s An Essay on the Causes of the Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species (published in Philadelphia in 1787 and warmly received on both sides of the Atlantic) argued that the environment determined race, listing anecdotal evidence of whites who, after spending time as captives among Native American groups, assimilated not only culturally but racially.35 Such immediate amalgamation was fearful: if race was mutable within one generation, then the acquisitions of white privilege could be lost quickly, just as an economic crisis could (and did) wipe out financial resources. This racial fear was deep-seated in late eighteenth-century North America, where the construction of hierarchical racial difference was necessary to make sense of the enslavement of African-descended women and men and the genocide of Native Americans. As historian Joyce Chaplin argues, the belief that whites were superior stemmed from the contrast of European health in the face of massive Native American deaths from disease (diseases that, of course, were transmitted by Europeans).36 In the post-Revolutionary period, as the United States was being formed as a nation of white citizens, concerns about the deleterious racial effect of exposure to nonwhite peoples, particularly on the contested borderlands at the western edges of white-claimed territory, gave rise to defensive proclamations about the durability of whiteness. Thomas Jefferson’s Notes on the State of Virginia (1784) denigrated African Americans as natural slaves, claiming that people of European, especially Anglo-Saxon, descent would remain superior in the New World. Jefferson’s scientific racism belied an overarching insecurity about white identity; whiteness had to be protected, and white privilege was ensured through laws, social structures, and cultural forms such as hymnody.\n\nThus far, this chapter has sought to point out the ways in which William Billings has been exceptionalized in historiography, while also assessing the historical particularities of his life and works that did indeed make him unusual. After all, Billings lived through the American Revolution, an unprecedented event in which the possibility of politicalPage 218 → sovereignty shared by a confederation of semiautonomous states was rendered into reality. He witnessed the violent and devastating reality of war and celebrated the underlying principles that drove many people to withstand hardship for the sake of a new nation. As we shall see, the nationalism of Gene Autry’s period was of a different order, for it no longer stemmed from the novelty of differentiating from an imperial power but as an imperial power that was also undergoing substantial demographic change among its inhabitants. The territorialism of nationhood, noteworthy in Billings’s titles, persists across time periods, and surfaces in Autry’s work in its emphasis on the western frontier. That is, aspects, such as the religiosity of Billings’s work, become sublimated to an assumed Protestantism that need not be explicitly stated in Autry’s case. But for both Billings and Autry, historiography has also on some level linked their exceptionalism to a marginal class status that challenged and was ridiculed by the established, elite order. The difference is that Autry, unlike Billings, succeeded in scaling the social hierarchy within his own lifetime, witnessing the celebration of his repertory as part of the US music canon.\n\nFrom Mavericks to Hillbillies to Cowboys\n\nThe ideology of white supremacy that underwrote land seizures and enslavement in the early republic morphed throughout the nineteenth and into the twentieth centuries, but the foundational premise that white cultural creations were preeminent, and that white artists should receive the lion’s share of critical attention, remained largely unchanged. As the western frontier closed and chattel slavery gave way to new forms of racial subjugation, the popular music industry served to articulate anew the same national and racial hierarchies. When the commercial recording industry emerged in the early decades of the twentieth century, it advertised its products according to a set of invented genre labels that mapped onto perceived racial, class, and national markers. The development of niche “foreign music” and exoticist genres (such as Hawaiian music) allowed record companies to expand into international markets. At the same time, these recordings satisfied demands for exoticism among US consumers.37 As with Billings, US musical nationalism during this era was defined in part by difference. Furthermore, these recordings echoed the capitalist exploitation of settler colonialism, depending upon an expansionist US imperialism that sought to extract material and cultural wealth from subjugated peoples, especially in the Pacific Page 219 →and Latin America. The proliferation of “foreign” and “ethnic” novelty songs and recordings during these decades, which often presented ethnic Others in a comic or hypersexualized light, reflected anxieties about the unprecedented waves of immigration to the United States around 1900.38 Increasingly restrictive immigration laws, most notably the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924, likewise sought to assuage such nativist anxieties.39 At the same time, US folklore studies emerged as a form of cultural nationalism that was largely Eurocentric in its outlook, locating the nation’s cultural origins in the ostensibly “pure” whiteness of the British Isles.\n\nContrasted with “foreign” music, record companies in the 1920s and 1930s began marketing “American” popular music according to three categories. US vernacular roots music was divided into two genres according to the race of the performer, despite considerable stylistic and audience overlap; the “hillbilly” genre signified music by and for a white, mostly southern, rural underclass, while so-called race records were by African American performers. This “musical color line,” to use Karl Hagstrom Miller’s formulation, reproduced the racial privileges of Jim Crow; white performers could traverse the line into blues and other ostensibly Black repertories and styles, but Black musicians were expected to hew closely to a narrowly defined set of racialized styles or else be denied professional opportunities.40 These two genre categories were defined in contrast with mainstream pop, a racially unmarked category that tacitly served white, middle-class audiences. Mainstream pop entrepreneurs, such as the established composers of Tin Pan Alley, often wielded the classed language of respectability politics to distinguish their work from hillbilly and race musicians. Thus, white country musicians of the era found themselves in the middle of a classed and racialized hierarchy.\n\nBeginning in the 1920s and 1930s, the commercial country music industry seized on both folkloric language as well as minstrelsy’s racial slippages to establish and fortify its claims to whiteness.41 “Singing cowboy” Gene Autry was an early beneficiary of this system, and his career trajectory offers striking parallels with that of Billings. Both participated (wittingly or not) in the establishment of white identity through racial difference from Native American populations, which gave their whiteness a distinctly American tint. Both also produced music that elite critics initially disparaged, often for reasons of class bias, but their idiosyncrasies have since come to be regarded as part of US musical exceptionalism. Yet Autry is distinguished from Billings in several important Page 220 →respects. Most obviously, Autry was involved in commercial popular music, an industry that had roots in early US music publishing, but with multimedia expansions that transformed it past all recognition from Billings’s day. Simply put, Autry’s agency was more diffused across a vast network of songwriters, performers, record producers, film directors, and other industry figures. The recordings, films, and other media attributed to Autry—and thus their messages regarding national and racial identities—were shaped by this network and cannot and should not be viewed as necessarily representing Autry’s singular artistic will or political outlook, at least not his alone. Rather than the musical maverick status later ascribed to Billings, Autry proved musically and ideologically flexible in order to appeal to a wider mainstream listenership. Autry’s generally personable demeanor allowed him to navigate rarefied social settings more easily, while Billings’s apparent unlikability and disability inhibited social mobility. And while Billings’s compositions merely alluded to Native populations in passing, Autry’s work across various media sought to represent them visually and sonically. In so doing, his work highlighted racial difference much more strongly, which served to make his own music—country music—appear whiter than it had previously, ultimately working to its commercial advantage.\n\nAs the country music industry began to coalesce in the late 1920s, it was dogged by negative class stereotypes, embodied most emphatically in the figure of the hillbilly. While some country institutions clung to the hillbilly image as a matter of working-class and regional pride, the established popular music industry remained gleefully disdainful toward this class- and race-marked figure.42 Writing for Variety in 1926, Abel Green taunted:\n\nThe “hillbilly” is a North Carolina or Tennessee and adjacent mountaineer type of illiterate white whose creed and allegiance are to the Bible, the chautauqua, and the phonograph. The talking machine’s relation to the show business interests most. The mountaineer is of “poor white trash” genera.43\n\nGreen’s “poor white trash” epithet echoed other critics who coupled the genre’s working-class identity with a racially marked whiteness—one that distinguished country audiences from the unremarkable whiteness of middle-class pop listeners. A 1930 article in Metronome elaborated on the hillbilly stereotype: “a browned and bearded individual in overalls, straw hat and a piece of hay protruding from his mouth.”44 Class disdain thus Page 221 →became a distinction of color, as outdoor labor rendered white people brown, literally and figuratively. Another epithet, “redneck,” also gained currency beginning in the late nineteenth century to describe the suntanned necks of white southern farmers, whose labor transformed them into a physically marked, lower class of white.45 Deployed by the mainstream music industry, “hillbilly” and its synonyms served to valorize pop audiences as possessing the normative and desirable type of whiteness.\n\nFor country music entrepreneurs, the hillbilly figure presented a barrier to audience expansion. Entrepreneurs thus sought new performative models that would maintain country’s aura of rustic authenticity while also projecting a stronger sense of middle-class respectability. By the mid-1930s, the cowboy emerged as the most viable candidate to combat the negative stereotypes facing country music.46 A romanticized, heroic figure, the cowboy seemed to embody distinctly American ideals of rugged individualism and self-reliance, offering audiences a masculinist, class-independent alternative to the hillbilly while simultaneously easing the socioeconomic anxieties unleashed by industrialization and the Depression.\n\nNot coincidentally, the cowboy myth also presented an unblemished whiteness compared to the hillbilly’s racial ambiguities. Although the historical cowboy performed outdoor labor, and indeed the industry’s labor force was racially diverse, in the popular imagination the cowboy was idealized as white and was seemingly not subject to the same racial transformations endured by rural southern farmers.47 Instead, the cowboy’s race was defined via contrast with American Indians, an exoticized Other whose apparently insurmountable racial difference made cowboys appear whiter. At the same time, academic folklorists and popular media both began promoting a narrative of Anglo-Saxon origins for cowboy song repertory, which compounded the cowboy’s racial identity as white. The cowboy thus appeared as a uniquely American cultural hero linked almost exclusively to a western European racial background. For the cowboy singers who achieved popularity via this new heroic image, most notably Gene Autry, the cowboy’s Americanized whiteness proved to be an avenue of social uplift, avoiding the class-based stigmas faced by other country performers of the era.\n\nAutry’s image drew heavily upon the previous generation of cowboys in popular culture as well as on the work of cultural historians from the first decades of the twentieth century. While dime novels and silent western films established the cowboy’s commercial viability and penchant for spectacle, academic folklorists gave the cowboy a veneer of respectability Page 222 →and cultural authenticity. As the frontier “closed” in the late 1800s, the cowboy narrative emerged as a lucrative genre that romanticized and whitewashed the history of western expansion, stoking nationalist pride at the seeming fulfillment of Manifest Destiny. Dime novels featuring cowboy heroes began to emerge shortly following the Civil War.48 Buffalo Bill Cody’s Wild West show likewise imagined the cowboy’s foundational role in the creation of a new America.49 Owen Wister’s The Virginian, published in 1902, elevated the genre to middle-class readership, selling fifty thousand copies within two months.50 The western novel declined in popularity with the introduction of silent westerns in the early 1900s, but this change in media did little to undermine the nationalist implications of the cowboy or to blunt its appeal.51\n\nAt the same time, academics and other cultural custodians used the cowboy to shore up the nation’s racial identity. During a period of increasing immigration, authors depicted the cowboy as a white, Anglo-Saxon figure distinct from not only African Americans and Native Americans, but also from southern and eastern Europeans. (Of course, these assertions of the cowboy’s ethnicity did not match historical realities). Theodore Roosevelt championed the cowboy in his 1896 book Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail, contrasting the rugged, self-reliant manliness of the Anglo-Saxon cowboy with Indians and Mexicans, described as physically weak and untrustworthy.52 Owen Wister made Anglo-Saxon supremacy explicit, writing in 1895 that “to survive in the clean cattle country requires spirit of adventure, courage, and self-sufficiency; you will not find many Poles or Huns or Russian Jews in that district.”53\n\nFolk song collectors began to turn their attention to cowboy repertory around this time, and they tended to echo these messages of white supremacy. Folk song collection was intimately bound up with questions of cultural nationalism.54 In the United States, many nineteenth-century collectors were fervently engaged in debates over the scope and meaning of the nation’s folk music, in particular how the US might distinguish itself from European counterparts; as demonstrated by the landmark 1867 collection Slave Songs of the United States, the racial contours of US folk song were strongly contested.55 One of the first collections of cowboy songs, Songs of the Cowboys, was published by N. Howard “Jack” Thorp in 1908.56 A former cowboy, Thorp’s methods as a collector were mixed, presenting material from the field alongside original compositions and songs previously published elsewhere. However, Thorp’s volume provided little historical context for the repertory and avoided overt racial rhetoric, even as the cowboy’s whiteness was perhaps assumed.57\n\nPage 223 →Thorp’s collection was eclipsed two years later by the publication of Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, compiled by folklorist John A. Lomax. Boasting an academic pedigree that included Harvard and the University of Texas, Lomax yoked white supremacy and US exceptionalism more explicitly. The collection opens with a congratulatory letter from Theodore Roosevelt, to whom Lomax dedicated the volume. Roosevelt’s panegyric is followed by a preface in which Lomax praises the rugged independence and hard work of the cowboy, linking his repertory to “the Anglo-Saxon ballad.”58 Lomax thus followed in the footsteps of British ballad hunters like Francis James Child and Cecil Sharp, who heard in the oral tradition of the peasant class the truest expression of national identity.59 In valorizing white origins, Lomax pushed strongly against competing multiracial perspectives on US musical nationalism, promulgated by prominent composers like Dvořák and in later folk song collections documenting African American vernacular repertories.60 The authenticity of Lomax’s collection—that is, the possibility that nineteenth-century cowboys performed much of this repertory—is dubious. Likewise, Lomax’s methods, and his claims that cowboy repertory can be reliably traced to British antecedents, have been thoroughly critiqued.61 Nevertheless, Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads proved immensely popular, selling thousands of copies and appearing in an expanded edition in 1938. In the words of Mark Fenster, Lomax thus “helped to define both the repertoire and the romantic nature of the singing cowboy figure that was to follow in the mass media.”62\n\nIn the ensuing decades, Autry and his publicity machine drew upon Lomax’s work to give his cowboy persona a veneer of intellectual legitimacy. Song folios, interviews, and other promotional material appeared to crib freely from Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, emphasizing the music’s American identity, democratic spirit, and whiteness. One Autry song folio, sensitive to the class upheavals of the Depression, described cowboy society in utopian terms:\n\nThe most significant thing about cowboy music is its innate democracy. Except for the Boss or Foreman, there are no definite class distinctions on a ranch. Everybody, from the straw boss down to the cook and humblest wrangler, are on equal terms. The isolation from conventional society caused by their particular sort of work breaks down any barriers among them.63\n\nPage 224 →These comments tracked closely with the preface in Lomax’s collection:\n\nA trip up the trail made a distinct break in the monotonous life of the big ranches, often situated hundreds of miles from where the conventions of society were observed. The ranch community consisted usually of the boss, the straw-boss, the cowboys proper, the horse wrangler, and the cook—often a negro. These men lived on terms of practical equality.64\n\nThat Autry and his promoters felt the need to emphasize class equality reveals the nagging anxiety of being called a hillbilly. Especially during the Depression, Autry’s popularity depended largely upon the cowboy mythology promoted by Lomax, which denied class distinctions in favor of racial, gender, and nationalist ideologies that uplifted white working-class audiences.\n\nSounding Whiteness\n\nThe cowboy rhetoric surrounding Autry’s repertory belied its eclecticism, derived from multiple racially ambiguous sources, including Lomax ballads, minstrel songs, and Tin Pan Alley compositions. This apparent diversity was reconciled through rhetoric claiming a white national heritage for the music as well as through homogenizing, pop-oriented performance strategies. Over a career of nearly thirty years, Autry’s recordings increasingly tended toward middle-class pop styles in both form and delivery, elevating the country genre in the process.\n\nTo be sure, much of Autry’s repertory dealt with cowboy themes like boots, saddles, and cattle drives, and advertising took pains to establish the authenticity of this material as white folk song. A handful of Autry’s recordings, such as “Home on the Range” and “The Old Chisholm Trail,” had appeared in Lomax’s Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads and would have been familiar as folk songs to the record-buying public. Seeking to further burnish the authenticity of this repertory, songbooks and other publicity touted the songs’ supposedly Anglo-American roots. A rodeo program from the 1940s included a testimonial, ostensibly written by Autry, claiming that “better than anything else, yes, even better than the Negro spiritual, the American cowboy song typifies this great, young country of ours.” Later, the program suggested that most cowboy repertory derived from “Elizabethan England.”65 A lengthier testimonial explained:\n\nPage 225 →A lot of Texas cowboys were southerners who drifted to the Southwest after the Civil War. They brought with them the old time romantic southern tunes and the ancient English folk songs. Some of the boys were Irish and, with the Celtic love for story and song, added greatly to the fast-growing fund of word-of-mouth ballads that the cowboys passed on to each other.66\n\nSuch publicity reinforced the whiteness of Autry’s repertory—one transformed through a uniquely American experience into a distinctive national form of folk song. Newly composed cowboy songs, such as “Back in the Saddle Again” and “Take Me Back to My Boots and Saddle,” could escape charges of commercial inauthenticity by falling back on this same racially coded nationalist discourse.\n\nSo dominant was this narrative in Autry’s publicity that his eclectic repertory never threatened to undermine his cowboy persona. It perhaps helped that many of these other repertories were likewise viewed as thoroughly American. The music of Stephen Foster, for example, proved a consistently popular choice in Autry’s films; Foster’s “Oh, Susanna!” and “De Camptown Races” appeared with striking regularity.67 Other musical repertories included blackface minstrel songs, Tin Pan Alley ballads, comic novelty songs, and cover versions of “hillbilly” performers like Jimmie Rodgers.68 This diversity of styles and musical sources mirrored that of the early country music industry overall, which worked mightily to transform all of these styles into a singular race- and class-marked genre steeped in nostalgia and rusticity.69 In so doing, the industry arguably asserted a set of canonical US vernacular styles that subsequent generations of country musicians could exploit as an ideological and musical reservoir. Thus, for listeners already engaged with country music across recordings, radio, film, and other media, there was no need to resolve the apparent racial inconsistencies and style anachronisms in Autry’s repertory. Rather, Autry’s output in these various media worked synergistically to reinforce the repertory’s shared American heritage. Publicly, Autry remained always a cowboy, an image that effectively transformed all of his performances into performances of an uncontroversial whiteness.\n\nFurther aiding this transformation were deliberate changes to Autry’s performance style. In accordance with both his own musical preferences and the direction of his musical collaborators, Autry increasingly sought to mimic the sounds of mainstream popular music in order to capture Page 226 →a broader, middle-class audience. Like the rhetorical shift from hillbilly to cowboy, these self-conscious stylistic changes implied a move from a marked to an unmarked whiteness—one again defined by white, middle-class values. Most notable was Autry’s early turn from a twang-filled singing style to a smoother crooning delivery. In his earliest recordings, Autry worked as a Jimmie Rodgers sound-alike, emphasizing nasality that indexed the vocal timbre of white southerners.70 These recordings did not reflect Autry’s usual singing voice, however; he intentionally added the twang. Autry’s first national hit in 1935, “That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine,” marked his switch to crooning, closer to the style of middle-class white singers like Al Jolson and Rudy Vallée, whom Autry cited as influences.71 In addition to smooth vocal delivery, Autry’s recordings throughout the 1930s and 1940s increasingly relied on more elaborate written arrangements that could involve string sections, trumpet, or clarinet, rather than the guitar, fiddle, and banjo more typical of early country ensembles.72\n\nBy uniting these disparate but popular musical repertories and filtering them through his signature vocal style, Autry expanded the stylistic scope of “country” as a genre. And where country audiences had previously been confined to a regional, mostly working-class identity, Autry’s films presented alternative possibilities and helped to place them in the national mainstream. The potentially “inauthentic,” emotionalist, even effeminizing effects of moving from twang to croon, as well as the adoption of more pop-oriented arrangements, were mitigated in Autry’s case by the white, masculinist, and Americanist discourses surrounding the cowboy figure.73 As we will see, this became the standard against which nonwhite characters would be tacitly compared in Autry’s films.\n\nStaging Others\n\nThe utopian nationalism of Autry’s cowboy image was built on a rejection of class hierarchies that also typically avoided acknowledging racial conflicts. Despite country’s historical links to minstrelsy, Autry’s repertory rarely engaged in representations of racial Others.74 Within Autry’s films—over ninety were produced between 1934 and 1953—this strategy effectively positioned whiteness as a normative identity, denied nonwhite characters any notion of interiority, and glossed over the politics of racial representation, even as it avoided overt evidence of racial intolerance. Any nonwhites were peripheral, seldom seen or heard. Black actors occasionally appeared as servants or medicine show entertainers, while Page 227 →Latinx characters cropped up in a handful of “south of the border” films as an alluring exotic Other.75 Indians were depicted as the racial group most likely to disrupt the white social order—especially for films set in the American Southwest. Representations of Indians drew upon stereotypical nineteenth-century historical narratives of violent Native/white encounters, even though film plots were typically set in the present day.\n\nAutry’s films worked to highlight Indian/white racial difference through dramatic and musical means, which served to sharpen the contours of whiteness while erasing class differences among white characters. In dozens of formulaic plots, Indians were almost always villainous extras, often nameless, depicted as prone to irrational violence and moral depravity. Their deaths were relentless, remorseless, unremarkable—collateral damage in larger narratives pitting Autry against powerful white villains who are in cahoots with the duped Indians. The 1950 film Indian Territory included a texted prologue that underscored both the notion of Indian inferiority and their propensity to exploitation by immoral whites: “Whole communities were left to the merciless Apaches and the lawless whites, for there was little or no civilian law enforcement on the frontier. In order to control and loot these unprotected areas, unscrupulous white men did not hesitate to use the Indian tribes in their greedy attempts to halt the slow march of law and order.”76 Such formulations underscored racial difference and valorized white cowboy figures like Autry as heroic civilizing agents in US westward expansion—in other words, exceptional figures in the nation’s history. The Indians’ supposed irrationality was further articulated by nondiegetic music that contrasted sharply with Autry’s country pop music, relying not on tonality, AABA song structures, and smooth vocals, but on drums and chants. While Autry performed several songs over the course of each film, diegetic musical performances by Native characters were exceedingly rare, and in fact Indians rarely spoke in most of Autry’s films. Their voices remained silent except for the stereotypical war-whoop of battle—not merely sound but an inarticulate, menacing noise.77\n\nOrchestral scores during Indian attack scenes fell back on conventional primitivist signifiers—parallel fifths, drones, modal melodies, and an emphasis on woodwinds and drums.78 Consistent with industry practice, such stock scores were frequently repurposed from one film to another.79 The reuse of scores and stock footage was born of budgetary expediency, but it also reflected apathy among some film collaborators toward the representation of Indian characters. Rather than crafting new music for each film to give Indian characters a greater sense of Page 228 →complexity and specificity, the presence of generic scores across multiple films could create the impression of a homogenized, static Indian. These sonic distinctions between whites and Indians not only robbed Indian characters of the possibility for meaningful subjectivity, but also served to amplify the whiteness of Autry’s cowboy, deflecting the racially ambiguous, class-determined hillbilly figure that country music sought to escape.\n\nThrough musical, narrative, and other means across an array of media industries, Autry developed a durable, respectable image of the cowboy as American hero—an image predicated in part on racial difference that would prove lucrative and culturally resonant. Dozens of cowboy acts, such as Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers, would follow in the wake of Autry’s model, furthering both the cowboy image and the country music industry.80 Although major film studios were initially reluctant to embrace the western film genre, by the late 1940s Autry and his cohort had convinced studio heads of the western’s financial and dramatic potential; well-funded, prestigious films like High Noon (1952) and The Searchers (1956) soon followed, largely replicating the exceptionalist mythology of the white American cowboy. By the end of his entertainment career, Autry had amassed a personal fortune unprecedented in the world of country music; through savvy business investments, he would later become one of the few entertainers to regularly make the Forbes list of the four hundred wealthiest Americans.81 Late in life, Autry became the primary benefactor of the Autry Museum of the American West, a research center opened in Los Angeles in 1988. As articulated in both its mission statement and its archival collections, the museum is dedicated to the study of “all peoples of the American West,” particularly through collection and preservation of artifacts from American Indian cultures.82 Ironically, wealth built upon a narrative of white American exceptionalism would come to fund a revisionist historiography that seeks to critique it.\n\nRace, Recognition, and the Future of Americanist Musicology\n\nOur comparison of Billings and Autry is in many ways unexpected: it is diachronic and cross-genre, features contrasting geographic circumstances, and engages multiple modalities of embodied difference. While we do not mean to suggest a neat one-to-one correlation between their careers or the role that whiteness played, such a comparison provides insights about the construction of whiteness in US music history. Scholars Page 229 →(and fans) recognize both figures’ significance, but the centrality of racial privilege to their accomplishments has gone largely unacknowledged. Racial privilege manifested in various ways: for Billings, as a (temporarily) property-owning white man, he possessed enfranchisement; he could make financial and legal decisions on behalf of his entire family; he could expect to receive remuneration for his musical and other forms of labor. All of these were freedoms that were not available to all in the late eighteenth century. Together, they positioned Billings historically as an autonomous individual, and for posterity, as a composer whose works can be gathered together, evaluated on aesthetic merits, and canonized. In Autry’s case, Jim Crow laws conferred upon Autry access to spaces and resources unavailable to most musicians of color, while it also gave legal sanction to social hierarchies based around race. Within the context of the Hollywood film industry of the 1930s and 1940s, Autry also enjoyed more professional opportunities and rewards: he played heroic leading men rather than stereotyped extras, he received greater compensation, and he exercised greater control over contracts and the direction of his career. Greater recognition of such racial privileges and how they have shaped our understanding of the field is, we believe, imperative for Americanist musicology. In the spirit of this edited collection, which seeks not only to reflect on the current state of US music studies but to chart new paths of inquiry, we highlight here a few common themes and their implications for future research.\n\nThe first is a need to attend to other facets of identity within the racialized category of whiteness. This requires first a forthright acknowledgment that many of the composers and performers that constitute our musical canon and research subjects were regarded as white. This racial identity is not simply incidental or irrelevant but instead fundamental to how audiences and scholars have conceived of their musical value and historical significance. And yet this whiteness is not monolithic but shaded according to other aspects of identity, especially class and labor status, but also gender, ability, geography, and nationality. Even as Billings and Autry sought to turn white identity to their advantage, these other categories yielded hierarchies of whiteness within which these white men could still be regarded as less than. Billings’s upper-class critics seldom referenced his literal skin color but focused intensely on his physicality. For Autry, the proliferation of racialized labels pertaining to geography and class (hillbilly, cowboy) likewise demonstrates the complexity of race within a broader network of identities. Both figures occupied privileged spaces of maleness and whiteness, yet this whiteness was Page 230 →mutable, its benefits not always secure. In time, both men in one way or another were rescued from class disdain through assertions of whiteness coupled with rhetoric over their exceptionalist “American” identity. But to claim whiteness as an advantage equally bestowed upon its owners is a mistake. Rather, certain advantages were conceivable, if not realized, for both. For scholars, it is not enough to simply observe that a performer was (regarded as) white and thus benefited from racial privilege. That privilege must be assessed as a contingency amid a host of other historical and personal factors.\n\nBeyond the particulars of the individual racialized subject, we also note the need to historicize US whiteness and to investigate the agents involved in its construction across historical periods. Only select members of each generation in the United States have been empowered to define whiteness, and they have done so differently over time. Operating from a position of greater authority, economic and cultural elites have controlled the boundaries of whiteness, applying or denying it to Billings and Autry as was most beneficial to themselves. In Billings’s day, these elites included members of the religious establishment and wealthy landholders. Autry and his music were initially disparaged by Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley insiders like Abel Green, who found the music and its audience insufficiently white, and who relented only once Autry’s music proved too lucrative to dismiss. At the same time, cowboy repertory was granted intellectual and cultural legitimacy through the efforts of early academics like John Lomax, who staked the music’s worth in large part on its status as a specifically Anglo-American repertory. That both Billings and Autry have since been heralded as exemplars of American music should give us pause, for there seems to be here an uncomfortable conflation of American identity with whiteness. Across historical periods, what do elite cultural agents have to gain in asserting Americanness—a term that obscures rather than erases racial ideologies? In these two case studies, at least, labeling music as “American” made it more salable and serious, and whiter.\n\nThis question of authority and inclusion becomes perhaps even more acute as we approach the present day and investigate persistent biases within the musicological discipline. In its earliest decades, Americanist musicology was marginalized within a larger field that still privileged the model of the white, male European composer. For those invested in scholarly study of US music, Billings could fit more or less comfortably into that model, his idiosyncrasies as a composer making him just different enough from European counterparts to serve as a celebrated Page 231 →fountainhead of US classical composition. At some level, Billings’s whiteness helped to legitimate him as an object of serious scholarly study. Meanwhile Autry, for multiple reasons, but especially as an avatar of critically maligned, commercial country music, remained beyond the scope of midcentury musicology. His time would come only as US popular music made its first tentative steps into the academy, again under a problematic banner of cultural nationalism that regarded racial and stylistic diversity as part of US exceptionalism but that largely elided the politics of whiteness. As musicological scholarship has more recently embraced multicultural perspectives and sought to diversify the canon, whiteness has too often remained unmarked, unremarkable, perhaps even taboo—a tacit category against which musicians of color are compared. Attending to musical whiteness as actively constructed, historically dynamic, and deployed strategically for purposes of social inclusion and exclusion, makes us question how ideologies of whiteness might still linger in our present scholarship.\n\nNotes\n\n1. Establishing the field of US music studies in the twentieth century required robust advocacy on behalf of its relevance, particularly in the face of its dismissal by musicologists who focused on the European canon. A well-known example of such a dismissal is Joseph Kerman’s address to the American Musicological Society in 1964, followed by his article, in which he wrote: “Unfortunately, American music has not been interesting enough, artistically, to merit from us that [scholarly] commitment.” Kerman, “A Profile for American Musicology,” Journal of the American Musicological Society 18, no. 1 (Spring 1965): 68.

Lowinsky, “Character and Purposes of American Musicology: A Reply to Joseph Kerman,” Journal of the American Musicological Society 18, no. 2 (Summer 1965): 222–34; Joseph Kerman, [Letter from Joseph Kerman], Journal of the American Musicological Society 18, no. 3 (Autumn 1965): 426–27; Donald M. McCorkle, “Finding a Place for American Studies in American Musicology,” Journal of the American Musicological Society 19, no. 1 (Spring 1966): 73–84.

Wiley Hitchcock, Music in the United States: A Historical Introduction (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1969); Richard Crawford, The American Musical Landscape (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993). Unlike Black music studies, white music studies has not undergone a process of critical self-reflection. See, for example, Guthrie P. Ramsey, Jr., “Who Hears Here? Black Music, Critical Bias, and the Musicological Skin Trade,” Musical Quarterly 85, no. 1 (Spring 2001): 1–52; Kira Thurman, “Singing Against the Grain: Playing Beethoven in the #BlackLivesMatter era,” Examined Life, issue 17 (September 29, 2018), https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/singing-against-grain-playing-beethoven-blacklivesmatter-era/\n\nPage 232 →2.

As two white scholars collaborating on this chapter about whiteness, we have become acutely aware of this tendency. One goal of this chapter is to encourage a greater awareness, discussion, and critique of whiteness among white scholars, even as we acknowledge the racial privileges and epistemological blind spots of our own subjective position. On white epistemologies, see Tom Perchard, “New Riffs on the Old Mind-Body Blues: ‘Black Rhythm,’ ‘White Logic,’ and Music Theory in the Twenty-First Century,” Journal of the Society for American Music 9, no. 3 (August 2015): 321–48; Veronica Watson, The Souls of White Folk: African American Writers Theorize Whiteness (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2013).\n\n5. Our collaborative method entailed conversations and shared reading to develop the questions and critical framework of this project. Conversations about the two individuals we decided to profile led to fruitful comparisons, in which we identified ways in which they engaged similar questions. We then wrote the two case studies independently (Goodman wrote Billings, Parler wrote Autry), which allowed us to capitalize on our different areas of expertise. Reading through each other’s sections and offering comments followed, and finally we drafted the introduction and conclusion.\n\n6.

This masculinist figure, however, provided room for ambivalence. As Stephanie Vander Wel explains, “Autry’s musical imagery shaped the singing cowboy into a sentimental figure who underscored the vulnerability of men in the 1930s.” Stephanie Vander Wel, “The Lavender Cowboy and ‘The She Buckaroo’: Gene Autry, Patsy Montana, and Depression-Era Gender Roles,” Musical Quarterly 95, nos. 2–3 (Summer–Fall 2012): 244.\n\n74.

For further examples of such alliances between Indians and white villains, see Autry’s films The Singing Vagabond (1935), Ride, Ranger, Ride (1936), Apache Country (1952), and Winning of the West (1953).\n\n77. Only in a series of late-career, “pro-Indian” films were Indian characters given substantial speaking roles. These include The Last Round-Up (1947), The Cowboy and the Indians (1949), and Apache Country (1952).\n\n78. On orchestral representations of American Indians in the early twentieth century, see Michael V. Pisani, Imagining Native America in Music (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005). Few scores survive for specific Autry films, but the following examples of generic Indian music appear to have been used interchangeably across films: Mischa Bakaleinikoff, “Indian Tom-Toms #1 (Fast)” and “Indian Tom-Toms #2 (Slow)” (single sheet scores, no folder), Mischa Bakaleinikoff Collection, USC Libraries Cinematic Arts Library. For scenes in which such exoticist tropes appeared, see Ride, Ranger, Ride (1936) at the 47:20 mark; The Last Round-Up (1947) at 55:10; The Cowboy and the Indians (1949) at 5:55; Indian Territory (1950), opening credits; Apache Country (1952), opening credits.\n\n79.
