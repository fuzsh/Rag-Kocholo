        "text": "English 5950: Hollywoods Greatest Year\n\nFall 2010\n\nGrady\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY FILM SCHEDULE\n\nThe two film reviews that will be required of you this term have a twofold purpose: they will help to supplement the class's range of reference to the era we study, and they will give you practice in writing concisely and thoroughly about film. To that end they should be no more than 500 words long (about one single-spaced page, typed). You should try in this space not only to summarize the film's plot but also to offer some observations about its relevance to our generic or cultural or theoretical concerns in class--and of course you should feel free to offer those observations in class and on the discussion board as well as in your reviews. Since I plan to post each review on the course web site for everyone's reference, I'll need to receive them electronically. It would probably be best for you to email them to me (fgrady@umsl.edu) as attachments, by the dates indicated. All movies listed are available via Netflix and and most via Blockbuster (with the exceptions marked by a superscript #); films marked by an asterisk I can lend to you if necessary.\n\nAn indispensable reference site for information about any film is the Internet Movie Database (us.imdb.com).\n\nW SEP 8 Dodge City / Destry Rides Again\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) Julie Gerding\n\nThe Sea Hawk (1940)Mark Dischinger\n\nThe Plainsman (1937)Fay Fetick\n\nW SEP 15 Stagecoach / Jesse James\n\nThe Big Trail (1930) Mark East\n\nUnion Pacific (1939) 0Matt Rapisardo\n\n*The Bronze Buckaroo (1938) 0 Hannah Jones\n\nSEP 22 Gone With the Wind\n\nJezebel (1938) Rae English\n\n*San Francisco (1936) Cassie Vogelpohl\n\nW SEP 29 GWTW\n\nGoodbye Mr. Chips (1939) Jodi Douglas\n\nWuthering Heights (1939) Matthew Harrison Harrison\n\nW OCT 6 Murder Over New York / Love Finds Andy Hardy / Mr. Wong, Detective\n\n*Mr. Motos Last Warning (1939) Toby Beeny\n\nNancy Drew, Reporter (1939) Lyndsay Johnson\n\nW OCT 13 Ninotchka\n\n*It Happened One Night (1934) Matt Wesley\n\n*Nothing Sacred (1937) Jim McLain\n\nThe Thin Man (1934) Rae English\n\nCamille (1936) Ludmila Patralska\n\nW OCT 20Dark Victory\n\nThe Women (1939) Lyndsay Johnson\n\nThe Old Maid (1939)0 Hannah Jones\n\nW OCT 27 Only Angels Have Wings\n\nGunga Din (1939) Matt Rapisardo\n\nThe Awful Truth (1937) Matthew Harrison Harrison\n\nW NOV 3 The Wizard of Oz\n\nThe Little Princess (1939) Toby Beeny\n\nBoys Town (1938) Mark Dischinger\n\nW NOV 10 Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\n\nMr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) Matt Wesley\n\nYou Cant Take It With You (1938) Ludmila Patralska\n\n*Meet John Doe (1941)Cassie Vogelpohl\n\nW NOV 17 Young Mr. Lincoln\n\nThe Life of Emile Zola (1937)Jim McLain\n\nDrums Along the Mohawk (1939)Mark East\n\nW DEC 1 The Grapes of Wrath\n\n*Wild Boys of the Road (1933)0Fay Fetick\n\n*Heroes for Sale (1933)0Jodi Douglas"
