        "text": ".\n\nDirector: Roger Corman\n\nScreenwriters: Lou Rusoff / Lou Rusoff, Charles B. Griffith (uncredited)\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nIn memoriam: Roger Corman 1926-2024\n\nI started writing this to give more appreciation to Corman before it was too late; then, mid-writing, it was too late. In any event, this is the first of a two-part look at some of my favourite Corman films of his pre-1960 phase.\n\nThe first five years of Roger Corman’s directing career saw him direct twenty-five feature films, a frenzy of creative zeal mixed with mercenary cool practically without comparison for productivity or richness in the history of cinema. In 1960 Corman released two movies that garnered him a sudden upswing in attention and respect, if not exactly respectability: The Little Shop of Horrors, a movie that was, like most of the films he had made up until then, incredibly cheap and filmed quickly in black-and-white, and House of Usher, a lush colour horror movie made on a comparatively munificent budget. The Little Shop of Horrors played at the Cannes Film Festival, and House of Usher kicked off a series of films adapted from Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft that remain, today, his best-known and most-loved works. It’s comparatively easy to celebrate Corman as a director for his later work – other entries in the Poe-Lovecraft series, also including Pit and the Pendulum (1961), The Haunted Palace (1963), and The Masque of the Red Death (1964), his variably mythic and surreal counterculture exploitation excursions like The Wild Angels (1966), The Trip (1967), and Gas, or, How It Was Necessary to Destroy the World in Order to Save It (1970), and his thematically and directorially ambitious historical films, The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre (1967), Bloody Mama (1970), and Von Richthofen and Brown (1971).\n\nBy contrast, the fruits of those first five years have long attracted two entwined but also sharply distinct kinds of appreciation: viewers and critics genuinely fascinated by the particular kind of ingenuity and eccentric verve Corman and his team of regular collaborators exhibited, and those seeking immersion in the pantomime delights of Corman’s tacky monsters, makeshift sets, and other threadbare wonders. Here is where truly advanced Corman studies await. Those films range from strange masterpieces to a couple that are indeed pretty bad, but are all interesting – an array of stark, smart, ideogram-like variations on the essential stuff of genre cinemagoing, often delivered to meet whatever genre vogue there was going on, but shot through with perverse speculative interest, radicalism in theme and humour, and theatre-of-the-mind invention. Corman didn’t just prove you could make a movie about the end of the world on a budget that would hardly cover the catering on a big movie, but, perhaps, could and should only be done that way, with scope and scene reduced to a handful of players clinging on to the edge of the world – subject matter and setting mimicking Corman’s place in the Hollywood scheme of things. In that he proved, at long last, the ablest survivor. Corman successfully defined a version of commercial cinema that could subsist beneath the superstructure of expensive spectacle, a version that would split and veer off into many streams.\n\nCorman’s factory-line approach to turning out movies could well be traced back to the place of his birth, Detroit, and his initial choice to train as an engineer, in trying to follow his father, after the family moved to California. Corman served in the US Navy through the end of World War II before finishing a degree in industrial engineering at Stanford. After a brief attempt to work in a car manufacturing plant, Corman realised this was not his metier. His older brother Gene was already working as an agent in the film world, and Corman decided to follow him. His first display of his defining independent streak and dislike for the big Hollywood studios would emerge when he quit working for Twentieth Century Fox after not getting any credit for coming up with the idea behind Henry King’s The Gunfighter (1950), and became a student again, using the GI Bill to study English at Oxford before returning to Los Angeles and working for a literary agent whilst thrashing out scripts. One he wrote became Highway Dragnet (1954), a movie he also signed on to serve as an associate producer for no pay, purely to get experience. Corman immediately ploughed the money he got for the script and more he borrowed from contacts, adding up to about $12,000, into his first foray as full producer, Monster from the Ocean Floor (1954).\n\nThis gambit proved sufficiently successful for Corman to quickly produce another, The Fast and the Furious (1955), which Corman wrote as well and was directed by its star, John Ireland, alongside Edward Sampson. Despite receiving interested offers from well-established players, Corman sold the movie to American Releasing Company, a recently founded by the two entrepreneurial impresarios, James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff, as they offered Corman the chance to immediately make more movies. Corman kicked off his official directing career with his next project, Five Guns West (1955), a modest, mostly conventional, solidly-handled Western: Corman was still not yet thirty years old. Corman’s loyalties as a movie aficionado were perhaps most clearly signalled in his early work by the relatively straight-laced approach he usually took with the Westerns and gangster movies he made, but he began introducing twists, like the warring female antagonists of Gunslinger (1956), and the fascination with criminal psychology as a house of cards introduced in Day The World Ended and developed in Machine-Gun Kelly (1958) through to Bloody Mama. Corman later described The Intruder (1962) as his one stab at a message movie and his only flop, but Corman’s edge of social critique and humanist concern was percolating from the start, like the confrontation with racism often elided in Westerns in Apache Woman (1955). Gunslinger also proved fateful for Corman as it was his first time working with screenwriter Charles B. Griffiths, who would write many of Corman’s films in the next few years.\n\nSome were crime sagas, some teen flicks, others monster movies, a neat cross-section of the era’s popular fare. Still, Corman sometimes found himself starting trends rather than chasing them. The Undead (1957), a truly original and odd melange of horror, science fiction, and fantasy, emerged right at the cusp of a resurgence for horror cinema, whilst the trilogy of burlesques A Bucket of Blood (1959), The Little Shop of Horrors, and The Creature From The Haunted Sea (1961), helped birth the 1960s style of hip, pop art-inflected satirical comedy – particularly the latter, which came well before the likes of Dr. Strangelove, or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb (1964) and A Hard Day’s Night (1964) in transposing the aesthetics of stand-up comedy and MAD Magazine to the movie screen. Corman would later become most celebrated for the sheer number of future major Hollywood figures to gain major early career boosts from working with him. More immediately, Corman assembled a cadre of collaborators behind the camera and in front, employed across many movies. Some major if aging stars like Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, and Ray Milland would pass through his orbit, and stars on the rise, particularly Jack Nicholson and Charles Bronson, but also including Peter Graves, Lee Van Cleef, Mike ‘Touch’ Connors, and Robert Vaughan. But it was Corman’s corps of regular players whose faces become like old pals, among them Jonathan Haze, Dick Miller, Susan Cabot, Beverly Garland, Allison Hayes, Abby Dalton, Mel Welles, Dorothy Neumann, Barboura Morris, Richard Devon, Richard Garland, Bruno Ve Sota, and Mike Forrest.\n\nOne of the peculiar truths Corman stumbled upon, one he’d later explain to one of the young, blow-in talents looking to him for backing, a lad named Martin Scorsese, was that if you hit the right beats for pleasing the market being aimed for in his hemisphere of the filmmaking business, you could basically make any movie you wanted in between. Corman had already proved this often, and some of his best, most peculiar work exists in arguably his least-appreciated, most ephemeral movies-as-product, the ones he made to get in on the rock ‘n’ roll craze: movies like Rock All Night (1957) and Carnival Rock (1957) toss in a couple of numbers by some hit parade acts in scripts that otherwise dabble in postmodern farce and operatic tragedy, explorations of the absurd underside of show business and its players, and its connection with the vast American demimonde, the appetites serviced and personal fantasies given realisation, but built not down from the airy clouds of most Hollywood product, but from the stanchions of the street up. From almost the beginning, too, Corman had experimented with blending genre modes in a way that annexed the postmodern. It’s tempting to call Day The World Ended, Corman’s fourth film as a director, the wellspring of his oeuvre as his first movie in a fantastical genre and the one that really got things moving when it proved extremely profitable, making upwards of $1,000,000 from a budget of $96,000 and a shoot that lasted ten days.\n\nIn another sense, however, Day The World Ended stems directly from Five Guns West in focusing on a small, motley band adrift in a hostile landscape. From the Old West to the new: a high mountain abode at the fringes of what was civilisation, suddenly the only recourse for a small group of survivors of nuclear apocalypse. The script was written, as several of his early films would be, by Arkoff’s brother-in-law Lou Rusoff. Nepotism helps keep costs down, but Rusoff was also a sober, canny screenwriter, and he proved the first to invest Corman’s oeuvre with the trait that helped it to stand out, good writing and acting even in the most straitened circumstances. “Our story begins with….THE END!” announces the opening title card; its partner right at the end of the movie is, of course, “THE BEGINNING.” Corman would return to that idea with a more radical angle on Teenage Caveman (1958). “THE END!” is a mushroom cloud boiling up into the atmosphere. Atomic war has broken out, the world’s cities have been pummelled, and radioactive death is spreading across the world. Faux-Biblical scripture booms out over churning clouds. A narrator intones over shots of ruined buildings, “This is TD Day – Total Destruction by Nuclear Weapons…Man has done his best to destroy himself.” A gnarled and filthy figure gropes his way out of surging smoke and steam and stumbles down a slope before collapsing, revealing the stigmata of radiation poisoning blooming on his face. This is the edge of Corman’s little world, the pocket of normality left by the apocalypse, floating on an island of reality, the B-movie rough draft for Solaris (1972).\n\nCorman signals John Huston as a particular touchstone in Day The World Ended, borrowing the coot prospector from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) and from Key Largo (1948) the surly gangster with might-makes-right attitude and his brassy, mistreated moll at his side, as well as the theme of siege and of nerves being ridden like a merry-go-round. Day The World Ended is however more a sci-fi redraft of Frank Capra’s Lost Horizon (1937) – a fantasy of seclusion unfolding in a mountain retreat protected by walls of stone, left delicately untouched by the churning storms without, with a mystic pool of purity at its heart where the maidens swim, and where the disruption in the tenuously balanced Eden comes from those who cannot let go of the world that was. Corman’s fondness for that source was signalled decades later when he acted in a short film directed by his daughter built around its mystique. Day The World Ended is also inflected with a brand of meta-textual play that would recur throughout Corman’s career, in the characters-in-search-of-an-author eccentricity of Rock All Night, The Little Shop of Horrors, and Creature From The Haunted Sea, and hit an apotheosis with Gas, or, How It Was Necessary To Destroy The World In Order To Save It, which would also provide the ultimate self-deconstruction of Day The World Ended’s titular thesis, tales where Corman confronts characters and dramatic modes usually kept apart.\n\nDay The World Ended is still circumspect in that regard but the borrowings and tropes are fed into a supercollider, as Corman gropes towards discovering his compulsive themes and essential business model. The trash auteur who’d studied English at Oxford gives the game away by prominently featuring the Tragedy and Comedy masks on the wall of home that constitutes the bulk of the film’s setting, and even makes their presence the butt of a ruthless visual joke, as he zeroes in on a heroine trying to cheer everyone only to move as she dissolves in tears, the Comedy mask kept sarcastically in the frame. The bedraggled and irradiated survivor is Radek (Paul Dubov); shortly after geologist Rick (Richard Denning) arrives by the same path and finds Radek collapsed and seemingly dying. A little further along the ridge, gangster Tony (Connors) and his burlesque dancer girlfriend Ruby (Adele Jergens) also arrive at the fringe of the poisoned clouds in a car, and look down the slope into the mountain valley where a single, modernist-style house stands. The house belongs to Jim Maddison (Paul Birch), a retired US Navy Commander who chose the locale to live in precisely because he anticipated nuclear war and sought out a local where there was a chance of remaining safe from clouds of radioactive fallout: as well as high and remote, the mountains around the valley are filled with lead, and the house is well-stocked with provisions and fuel.\n\nMaddison lives with daughter Louise (Lori Nelson), who had called her fiancé to retreat to the house with them when it became clear war was going to break out, but he never showed up. At first Maddison wants to fight off the new arrivals because their presence would swiftly exhaust their stockpiles, a stance that seems all the more justified when Tony uses a pistol to shoot off the lock on the front door, but Louise demands her father open the house to them. Rick arrives shortly after, carrying Radek, and Maddison checks Radek with a Geiger counter, finding he’s badly irradiated. Tony’s initial intention to seize control of the situation by brandishing his gun is foiled by Rick, who surprises him with a powerful punch and disarms him. A final survivor arrives, this one descending from the mountains above: Pete (Raymond Hatton), aged gold prospector with a mule he calls Diablo. Pete claims to have just found the gold seam he’s searched for; Pete has big deals going down in his intended destination, the now non-existent San Francisco. Corman’s debriefing of the different eras and ideals of American life, pack mule to car to atom bomb to mutant, but the search for gold goes on. Despite his misgivings, Maddison quickly advises his guests to wash off with bottled water and sets about arranging the house for them. As in a fairy-tale, the clean water is the prize above all.\n\nScience fiction films of the 1950s often dealt in veiled or slightly metaphorical ways with the new reality of the atomic age. Arch Oboler’s Five (1951), a likely immediate influence on Corman and Rusoff, proposed a similar tale of a handful of survivors holed up in a large, modern house after such a war and arguing through what world they would build after, but avoided dealing directly with the realities of nuclear war. Other films had dealt with what-if scenarios about sudden cataclysms disrupting and even ending human civilisation, like Deluge (1933), Le Fin du Monde (1933), and When Worlds Collide (1952). And still more had envisioned the shock of the new and threat of the next through monstrous figurations, as mutant atomic monsters started stalking across movie screens, from Them! (1954) to Godzilla (1954). But Day The World Ended synthesised all those influences and more, and created a new subgenre: the post-apocalyptic drama, and children run as wayward as Planet of the Apes (1968), The Omega Man (1971), Mad Max (1979), and The Matrix (1999), all dealing in different ways with the same basic proposition of a post-nuclear landscape becoming as strange, teeming, brutal, transformation-riddled, and dreamlike as Greek mythology. Its DNA could also be said to inflect the entire realm of American independent film, an idea that barely existed when Corman began, but his template of making virtues out of scarcity and constructing elemental situations became its backbone: Corman, for instance, gifted the basic template to Monte Hellman for his debut The Beast From Haunted Cave (1959), and Hellman passed on the influence through his own cinema. Wim Wenders, whose Paris, Texas (1984) describes an American landscape as alien, arid, and depopulated as Corman’s, paid it puckish tribute in his The State of Things (1983), a film about a wayward attempt to remake Corman’s film.\n\nThe tiny cadre of survivors settle down to try and outlast the fallout before they exhaust their supplies. The situation is complicated as Radek, who everyone expects to die, instead clings on to life, but seems to need no food or water. Instead, he goes out of the house at night and devours wildlife that should be inedible, contaminated as all the animals are. One night, about to consume a snared rabbit, Radek sees a strange, gnarled figure looming out of the darkness and shrubbery at the valley fringe, and flees in fear. Meanwhile Tony stews with increasing frustration as he fixates on Louise, spurning Ruby and looking for a chance of gaining the upper hand over everyone. Maddison is worried that seasonal rains might dump radioactive water on the valley, spelling their doom, but for the time being a spring-fed pond provides fresh water and a place to swim. Having a dip there one day with Ruby, Louise experiences the peculiar feeling not just of being watched but of something trying to communicate with her on some inchoate level. Eventually Radek steals away Diablo the donkey and eats him, only for the lurking being to attack and kill him: the being is a mutant, a swiftly evolved response to the new radiation-soaked Earth beyond the valley, but one that still seeks what it can only find there. The distraught Pete, after finding Diablo dead, tries to climb back into the mountains but drops dead from radiation poisoning. Maddison, trying to chase him down, also receives a dangerous dose and barely makes it back to the house. Finally the mutant dares to try and snatch Louise away, whilst Tony takes advantage of Maddison’s prostration to steal his gun and plan Rick’s murder.\n\nThe valley and the house are Corman’s Forest of Arden, his Prospero’s Island, realised in a fashion that sustains a tradition to back when Shakespeare’s players only needed to hang up a sign announcing the scene was a forest. The immune Eden encompasses the possibilities of what the world looks like boiled down to a basic dichotomy: communal selflessness versus will to power. That dichotomy, as reports transmit from the mystic mutant zone from beyond the protecting ridge suggests, is solved in favour of raw strength – Corman’s regressing version of the apes-around-the-waterhole scenes of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The basic object of all effort is Louise, the young, unsullied mother of the future – paging another Corman acolyte, James Cameron, and his The Terminator (1984) – and who will be her mate. The three immediately vying candidates are Rick, Tony, and the mutant; Ruby, despite being only a little bit older than Louise, is nonetheless discounted, hated by Tony as the emblem of what he was forced, in his way of thinking and seeing, to settle for. Maddison is the canny prototype of a survivalist, and also an emblem of paternal authority: the island of refuge is his discovery, his construction, and despite his own misgivings and sense he tolerates his gate-crashers. Maddison is also keeper of forbidden lore: as a Navy captain he witnessed the results of atomic bomb tests, animals deliberately exposed to the fallout. Most died, but a handful mutated rapidly to weather the new climate, gaining new, tough, crusty skin and horns on the head – and in the case of a monkey, a third eye and wicked claws.\n\nThis finds its alarming rhyme when another badly irradiated and disfigured man (Jonathan Haze) tumbles into the valley. Rick and Maddison recognise his gnarled skin and changed features as resembling the test animals, and Rick realises that Radek and this man are both stages in a continuum of mutation, of which the ultimate and perfect example is the mutant stalking the valley. The man quickly dies from starvation after reporting the formation of a community of mutants, who are stronger than him and so claim all the food. When Rick tracks Radek and asks up him what he sees when he goes back over the ridge, Radek reports, “There’s wonderful things happening,” but also mentions that he has “an enemy.” As if already tuned into the wavelength of where imagination would drift in the post-World War II era, Corman conceives of the chimera produced by the atomic age as a neo-hobgoblin with the third eye of Buddhist lore and psychic powers. These transmit on levels only Louise can pick up and that only registering on the level of sensation rather than thought, flesh and sex threatening to break and reform in strange, grotesque patterns – anticipating the proto-Cronenbergian warpings of The Haunted Palace, Corman’s great blueprint for modern body horror, in particular. In a cheeky touch, Corman includes himself as Louise’s fiancé in the framed photo she keeps and discards at film’s end, whilst it’s very faintly suggested the mutant might in fact be Louise’s fiancé, radically transformed. Playing the mutant is Paul Blaisdell, a specialist in creating masks, models, and suits, who found himself the go-to man for Corman and other makes of low-budget creature features like Edward L. Cahn throughout the late 1950s.\n\nOne of Corman’s recurring, even obsessive themes in his early movies was a fascination with defining the difference between the genuinely tough, brave, hardy, streetwise, what have you, and the merely posturing, the macho, and the maniacal. It’s a question he likely figured a vast number in his audience would respond to: many of Corman’s heroes are literal and figurative little guys who prove braver and more resilient than the hulks and he-men. He’d revisit this in terms comedic (Rock All Night), revisionist of classical myth (The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent, 1957), and socially conscientious (The Intruder, when the Rick-Tony figuration is inverted and recast as the racist rabblerouser and righteous plebeian hero). The variation is straightforward in Day The World Ended, with the intelligent but still potent Rick contends with Tony, or, as they’re called at different points in the movie, “Mr All-American Hero” and “Mr Heel.” Tony is the embodiment of primeval virtue, for whom civilisation is a perpetual stymie: even in the refuge he’s only held at by Maddison who carries a gun and the key to the storeroom. Rick is at once an ideal hero but also the fallen version of something worthier, pressganged stand-in for Louise’s fiancé whilst mourning his brother, who was “studying for the ministry,” but the world needs a saviour of the flesh, not the spirit. He is, nonetheless, still two-fisted, besting Tony in their two stand-up fights. The seething, acquisitive, self-congratulatory hard-knock student Tony, declares that when he repopulates the Earth with his progeny, “They’ll be tough!” The end of the world and the reduction of the human race to a handful only winnows Tony’s feelings of frustrated strength and need down to the perfect version.\n\nMaddison, realising that survival might just be possible, lobbies for Louise to marry Rick and have children, appointing himself as the equivalent of a ship’s captain with emergency clerical powers. This all seems amusingly prim given the situation portrayed, as too is Louise and Ruby swimming together in swimsuits that wouldn’t get a deacon bothered, but the censor doth sleep no less than the atomic mutant. The dichotomy of the two female archetypes is very different to the men, signalling another quality that would distinguish Corman at the time: his female characters were a cut far above where the vast bulk of Hollywood cinema was, and sometimes still feel radical. Here basic presumptions are still in play: Louise is the “nice” girl, so prudishly dressed it borders on the satiric (like the entirely swathing nightgown she wears in the climax) versus Ruby the sexy dame. And yet Ruby is Corman’s truest figure of empathy, victim of a particular kind of misogyny not ended with the old world but perhaps only, again, rendered to pure form, as she finds herself the inferior candidate for mating and propagation. She gets along best with Pete, who she sneaks pilfered sugar to make moonshine with, watches Louise’s back, and tries to maintain Tony’s last tethers to human decency. Ruby kicks up her heels and amuses her companions by recreating her old burlesque act: “They’d give me the blue spot and then I’d give them the clincher!” she recalls with the glee of someone who’s held the eyes and groins of an audience enthralled, enacting the role of sexual a form of power and exaltation that played to a world vanished but could, in a genuinely revivified world, be powerful and beneficent. Ruby is however doomed by alternations of love and hate for her ratbag boyfriend, enacted in quick and deadly manner when she saves Louise from being raped by Tony and makes a last, desperate appeal to Tony: “What are we fighting for? We’re like a couple of kids!”, only to turn homicidally enraged when Tony spurns her: trying to stab him, Ruby instead ends up with Tony shoving the knife in her own gut, and in a startling vision of misogynist disdain, he drops her corpse over the edge of a cliff with a wiseguy kiss-off that could come right out of Raymond Chandler: “Happy landings, sweetheart.”\n\nCorman’s concise, waste-free technique contends expertly with the limited settings, as when he uses the prostrate Maddison on the couch that bisects his living room as a compositional element to complicate the space and staging, and his steady editing rhythm invisibly breaking up what is in effect a dialogue-driven chamber piece. Later Corman would know that his audience at least partly showed up to see the cheap monsters, but for the moment he makes the mutant’s first appearance a cleverly elusive, even hallucinatory moment, the creature hovering slightly out of focus in the distance, Radek looking on from the foreground. The “wonderful things” hover in the stygian mist all around, at least until the Biblically cleansing rain starts to fall. The mutant’s attempt to abduct Louise is foiled when it proves terrified of the water of the spring, and Louise manages to wriggle free and take refuge in the pool. The rain that starts falling proves to not be irradiated but instead start washes the fallout away. Representing as it does a sudden evolutionary leap to contend with a poisoned world, clean water is ironically toxic to the pathetic mutant, which dies, its corpse smoking in the downpour: Rick and Louise deduce the reason for its death and know this means other mutants won’t survive the rain either. Meanwhile Tony manages to snatch up the pistol Maddison keeps close and immediately plans to gun Rick down when he and Louise return, but he doesn’t know Rick gave Maddison another pistol for extra security, and when he realises there’s no other choice Maddison kills Tony. Maddison finally dies and Louise and Rick finally leave the valley together, with a closing note that might be just a tad excessively optimistic, but certainly fulfils the film’s parable-like form.\n\nBy the standards of Corman’s first phase, Day The World Ended is a leisurely affair at 80 minutes long – if he’d made it couple of years later it would likely have been ten to fifteen minutes shorter. It also follows suit with a lot of ‘50s sci-fi cinema in invoking religious overtones, at a time when to sell to a large audience many dabbling in the genre assumed there had to be some kind of parochial moral to what was being portrayed. This was something Corman would quickly dispense with when he realised his young audience, watching from their cars in the drive-ins between make-out sessions, didn’t really want or like. By contrast, when the moral of the story is summarised at the end of Corman’s follow-up monster movie, It Conquered The World, it’s couched entirely in terms of human qualities and potentials, distinguishing their emotional reflexes from the cold, calculating alien whose lack of feeling indicates a species without any feel for, or interest in, communal care. Rusoff wrote the script for It Conquered The World again, although Corman had Griffith give it an uncredited polish, and indeed the writing has the feel of Griffith’s involvement in the headier dialogue and quirkier humour. Again, Corman is doing the utmost with next to nothing, although now the settings stretch to a couple of different houses and interior sets, a world where famous scientists subsist in California bungalows and army bases are safely represented by some wire fencing.\n\nIt Conquered The World was the first film released under American Releasing Corporation’s new, more ambitious name of American International Pictures. This time Blaisdell was given few hundred dollars to build the monster that was to be the movie’s main attraction. Corman later, wryly commented that it taught him that movie monster shouldn’t be shorter than the leading lady, and that lady herself, Beverly Garland, reportedly snorted on seeing the creature, “That conquered the world?” The Venusian is indeed pretty blatant in its stiff articulation and rubbery stature, but is also amongst the most memorably designed and iconic of movie monsters, vaguely resembling an ambulating upturned radish with a skirting fringe of scuttling claws, two waving, pincer-capped arms, glow-in-the-dark eyes, and face twisted into a permanent evil leer. It Conquered The World gets in on the run of mid-1950s movies about alien possession and suborning with its theme of an alien invader who starts using creepy little bat-like creatures to fly around and implant control devices in chosen recipients, turning them into slaves.\n\nAnother of Corman’s recurring preoccupations emerges here, in the figure of the intelligent and inquisitive being whose private moral schemes lead them in a radically different direction to the society about them, which they consider themselves above or fatefully at odds with. Corman would later take that figure to a conceptual limit in The Masque of the Red Death’s Prince Prospero, who devoted to evil as an ethic, and Bloody Mama’s titular matriarch. Here the equivalent is Lee Van Cleef’s Dr Tom Anderson, a brilliant physicist who has nonetheless alienated himself from authorities with his impassioned antiwar activism and bizarre predictions, including theories about life on other planets being provoked by human emergence into space. Tom is first glimpsed lobbying US Defense Secretary Platt (Marshal Bradford) and General Carpenter (David McMahon) in a desperate effort to get an army-run project trying to launch satellites into space cancelled: “We’re all in a state of high hilarity,” Tom comments sardonically when the honchoes denies he’s been worrying them, “And we’ll all end up in a state of high mortality if you don’t call off this satellite project.”\n\nMeanwhile Anderson’s close friend and former colleague Dr Paul Nelson (Peter Graves) is running the project with his own, more orthodox genius and sense of duty to the fore. His team of scientists and technicians includes Dr Ellen Peters (Karyne Kadler) and Dr Pete Shelton (Griffith), and they’re trying to finally get a satellite into orbit after several failures. “I hear that satellite cost us nine million bucks,” one of the team notes, to another’s quip: “It’d be just great if she sideswiped an airliner.” Tom and Paul and their wives Claire Anderson (Garland) and Joan Nelson (Sally Fraser) have dinner together at the Andersons’ house, where Paul gets the feeling Tom is peculiarly smug about his latest satellite launch. Tom responds by showing Paul a shortwave radio setup in his living room, and lets Paul listen to a peculiar throbbing noise coming in over it, a noise that Tom says is actually the voice of an alien being he’s made contact with, one of a circle of nine, immensely advanced beings living on Venus. What Tom doesn’t tell his friend yet is that he’s been paving the way for the alien to come to Earth: Tom has given the alien information about the personnel of the project base and who exactly it needs to take control of amidst the local population in order to seize all the levers of authority. Tom’s reasons for helping the creature emerge quickly: Tom believes the alien will benignly apply its greater intelligence and will on the human race, finally cure it of warlike impulses and set the species on the path to noble betterment, a world where a man like Tom will finally be hailed as a noble visionary rather than a brilliant crank. The alien’s spacecraft crash-lands after encountering the satellite Paul’s team launched, but the alien survives and takes up residence in a cave system near the project base. The alien sends out a number of small, bat-like flying creatures to track down those selected to be controlled, including Paul and his fellow scientists on the project as well as its military overseer, General Pattick (Russ Bender), and the Sheriff of the nearby town, Shallert (Taggart Casey), as well as Joan and other wives, as Tom has told the alien they must also be controlled. The alien also uses its powers to shut down every machine in the surrounding countryside, save those belonging to Tom and the subjugated: in a miniature remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951), trains, cars, and industrial machines crawl to a halt.\n\nAt first glance It Conquered The World seems fairly conventional in its mid-1950s social presumptions, with its pair of dutiful housewife-partners framing the core clash of rebel antihero, a study in warning about and professional intellectual dissenters crossing the line into outright disloyalty through utter conviction they’re doing right, versus the firmly with-the-program hero. Add to this to the way the alien mimics a particular kind of propagandist ideal of what a Communist was supposed to act like – lacking familiar moral standards, acting according to emotionless expedience and absorbing other consciousnesses into its own, blank, gestalt identity. As the film unfolds, however, Corman has great fun revising and toying with those precepts. The alien proves instead a caricature of arch individualism, as Paul realises, acting without any understanding of human empathy as above all the underpinning of a social animal. Paul has to become the anarchic and ruthless guerrilla warrior within his own little backwater. The wives are soon split between the conformity-pushing, in the shape of the controlled Joan, thrusting one of the bat-creatures at her husband with a smile of pleasure straight out of a TV commercial evangelising a miracle cleaning product, and Claire, the seething defender of both home and species, who becomes increasingly determined and irate in provoking her husband’s conscience before marching off with rifle in hand to confront the alien invader. The military hierarchy, in the form of Pattick, is easily controlled, and his watchwords of paranoia readily tweaked to serve the alien’s quarantining needs precisely.\n\nAll that’s left of army power capable of intervening is a unit of bewildered GIs tramping about the landscape as if trapped in their own private Beckett play. Here we get the essential Corman double act, of Dick Miller as the stern, rugged, but confused sergeant Neil, and Haze as Ortiz, ethnic comic relief, an obscurely accented, clumsy, but attentive private who notes the “funny-looking bird” that keeps flitting overhead. Cruel satire on the spectacle of repression of civil rights protestors comes when Paul happens upon the controlled sheriff casually gunning down elderly newspaper editor Haskell (Thomas E. Jackson) for his refusal to obey orders. Paul’s sense of logic dictates that anyone possessed by the alien is “my enemy,” and takes this to the still rather shocking limit of shooting Joan after she attempts to plug him into the alien’s soothing mainstream of mindless obedience. Corman’s jocular cynicism extends to the dead-eyed violence that dots the film, from Tom setting Shallert on fire with his blowtorch after he changes sides, to one of the suborned scientists at the rocket range calmly reciting instructions over the radio whilst his colleague throttles Ellen to death, after she is horrified to find the bat-creatures that delivered their control devices in a putrefying stack stashed in a locker: the cool, post-gender landscape of scientific research suddenly becomes the scene of proto-slasher movie stuff. Corman’s images become increasingly charged with evocations of extreme threat but all couched in everyday and domestic settings – Claire beholding her husband dutifully oiling up his rifle to get ready to kill his friend and lurking behind decorative bars that became a cage cutting her off from her husband, and Paul pulling out his pistol to gun down his wife and then clutching her body whilst sobbing.\n\nWhilst dotted with such episodes of surprisingly hard-edged violence and weirdness, It Conquered The World is like Day The World Ended finally propelled by character interaction, with the two scientists duelling with a kind of violence manifest in thought and attitude, violence that never becomes physical between them as Tom in particular tries to maintain the indulgent reasonableness of a man confident he’s about to be proven right. The rest of the action can be seen as mere illustration of the clash of their differing philosophies. Science fiction epic spills over into domestic drama, the two different marriages proving battlegrounds the alien war is fought on. Joan’s possession and Paul’s slaying of her sparks Tom’s appalled bewilderment: “She was still your wife – still Joan! You would have been one with her…”, to Paul’s hard, disgusted retort that she had become his enemy in a war that Tom has foisted on them all. Hard as it to see the roguish Van Cleef with his vulture-like, lunging physique as anyone’s idea of a famous scientist, he does a great job regardless of selling his character’s mix of fanatical fervour and friendly indulgence, as when he assures Paul over the phone that since he’s destroyed his control unit and can’t be possessed for at least a week he might as well come over a drink. But the scotch-sipping palsiness of Tom and Paul doesn’t disguise the sharp angles of their duels of language. “Makes me look back into history for comparison,” Tom comments when Paul notes the alien’s ruthless methods. “Comparison or rationalisation?” Paul retorts. Finally the alien, tired of Paul marauding and upsetting their plans, decides it can’t wait to muzzle him and commands Tom to kill his friend. And Tom seems to shoulder this responsibility in the name of the greater good.\n\nMeanwhile Claire, marvellous played by Garland, personally embodies a paradigm in her moment of his history, trying to live according to the ideal of wifely duty, a duty that demands she incessantly harass her husband over his increasingly dubious life choices, the old job talk transmogrified into a running debate on the ethics of intergalactic treason. As treason unfolds, Claire finds herself made militant and obliged to go out and face the being that is both organ of and puppet master for Tom’s galactic-sized ego. In the process she evolves into a rough draft for Ellen Ripley in her furious, alien-slayer resolve. “Look, I don’t know if you can hear me or not,” she barks over the radio at the alien she now sees as her personal nemesis, “But if you can you listen good – I hate your living guts for what you’ve done to my husband and to my world! I know you for the coward you are and I’m gonna kill you!” The steals the rifle Tom intends to use on Paul and ventures into the caves. There she’s confronted by the creature: “You think you’re gonna make a slave of the world? I’ll see you in hell first!” she snarls as she plugs the sneering creature. But the alien proves invulnerable to both bullets and invective, and Claire dies nastily in its pincers. A sorry end for a character who today would be onto her fourth franchise instalment. Tom and Paul overhear her death through the radio, finally shocking Tom out of all his illusions about the alien’s nature.\n\nOrtiz hears Claire’s screams whilst he’s foraging, as he fetches his comrades. Too late to save Claire, they battle the monster within and outside the cave. Meanwhile Paul visits the rocket range and guns down the possessed there, whilst Tom improvises a weapon with the blowtorch and kills the sheriff to get hold of his working car. Arriving at the cave, Tom is in time to see the soldiers being slaughtered by the alien on the rampage, but he manages to approach the alien which thinks it still his stooge, only for Tom to declare with savage reckoning, “I made you welcome to this Earth – you made it a charnel house!” He plunges the blowtorch into one of the Venusian’s eyes: the alien swipes him in agonised retaliation, and monster and scientist both topple over dead, Tom lying in the alien’s cold embrace. Corman’s laconic direction sharpens here and there with flashes of the inspired, like the sight of the alien’s gleaming eyes in deep shadow as it advances on Claire, and suddenly at the very end he goes for a concluding note of threadbare cinematic poetry, cutting between the various littered corpses left behind by the drama, as Paul makes account of the meaning of it all: “There can’t be any gift of perfection from outside ourselves,” Paul notes by way of eulogy when he arrives too late: “It has to come from inside – from Man himself.” A fascinating sign-off to a movie from the era, contrasting the usual moral along the lines of “there are some things man is not meant to know,” with Corman’s own, distinct variation: humanity must know itself before it can know anything. And in this idea, Corman had found the key to his career’s preoccupations. That, and making much out of practically nothing.\n\n.\n\nDirector: Roland Emmerich\n\nScreenwriters: Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich / Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich, James Vanderbilt, James A. Woods, Nicolas Wright\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nRoland Emmerich was an unlikely candidate to become one of Hollywood’s biggest directors. Born in Stuttgart in 1955, the son of a wealthy manufacturer of garden machinery, Emmerich spent much of his youth swanning about Europe and North American before knuckling down and attending Munich’s University of Film and Television, initially intending to become a production designer. After watching Star Wars (1977) he decided to try directing too. Required to make a short film as his thesis project, Emmerich instead made a complete feature, the science fiction film The Noah’s Ark Principle, which gained a theatrical release in 1984, followed by two more German-language genre films, Joey (aka Making Contact, 1985) and Hollywood-Monster (aka Ghost Chase, 1987). Emmerich’s fast-evolving reputation as a technically skilled and visually impressive filmmaker soon landed him the job of directing Moon 44 (1990), a West German-produced, English-language feature about prisoners pressganged into serving a nefarious space mining company. Moon 44, not for the last time in Emmerich’s career, was critically derided for its derivative story and clunky dramatics, but it proved an international calling card. One member of the cast, Dean Devlin, would become Emmerich’s producing and writing partner, and it also gained Emmerich offers from Hollywood, making his debut there with 1992’s Universal Soldier.\n\nThe surprise success of Universal Soldier, a flashily-filmed tale about warring cyborg supersoldiers, helped Emmerich and Devlin get their next project off the ground. Stargate (1994) depicted a team of Earth soldiers, and one nerdy scientist, who travel via a wormhole opened up by a recovered piece of alien technology to a distant desert planet. There they find human inhabitants enslaved by spacefaring, body-swapping aliens resembling ancient Egyptian gods. Stargate proved a big hit with its blend of hoary sci-fi ranging from Doctor Who to Edgar Rice Burroughs and Erich Von Daniken, and old-fashioned action-adventure movie sweep realised with Emmerich’s colourful eye. It also climaxed with a consistent motif in Emmerich’s films, with the oppressed rising up against tyrannous and genocidal powers. From this point on Emmerich and Devlin adopted the adage “go big or go home” like a personal religion, and in obedience came up with Independence Day. Upon release in July 1996, Independence Day seemed a logical extension of the evolving special effects blockbuster style, but also proved the truest curtain-raiser for the next wave of that style, as it rapidly became the second highest-grossing film in history just behind Jurassic Park (1992), and made former rapper and TV comic actor Will Smith into a major movie star.\n\nEmmerich and Devlin quickly moved to repeat the film’s success with their Hollywoodised take on Godzilla (1998), a goofy, mindlessly entertaining film that proved a weak box office performer, and one infamous to fans of the great kaiju for its disrespectful take on the creature’s lore and traits. Whilst Emmerich made segues into historical tales for The Patriot (2000) and Anonymous (2011), straight-up action filmmaking on White House Down (2013), and even the personal and relatively low-key activist drama with Stonewall (2015), he nonetheless remained synonymous with, and even infamous for, his continuing string of expensive, flashy, absurd, and variably popular blockbusters, including The Day After Tomorrow (2004), 10,000 BC (2007), and 2012 (2009), to a creeping feeling of diminishing returns on an entertainment level, but sufficiently sustained financial success. Emmerich remained happily tuned out of the tide of fashion in Hollywood aesthetics. Whilst his major rival in the ‘90s blockbuster stakes Michael Bay made his flashy, Ritalin-jagged, cubist-edited, advertising-and-video clip-derived style a new standard, and Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan (1998) made vivid, unstable camerawork and immersive realism a hallmark of serious intent, Emmerich maintained his unerringly clean, visually legible visual approach, and preferred to keep his edge by constantly upping the game of CGI-era special effects and preposterously big thinking to go with them.\n\nEmmerich resembles no lesser classic Hollywood forebear than Cecil B. DeMille in his both his love of grand scale in his subjects and filmmaking, and broad, stylised approach to the dramatic level of his movies, in trying to appeal to the biggest possible audience. DeMille’s quip that every time he made a movie critics’ estimation of the audience’s IQ dropped by ten points could well have been made about Emmerich. Both Anonymous and Stonewall were sharply rejected because despite shifting into material demanding more finesse Emmerich maintained his unsubtle and glossy approach, and the considerable virtues of The Patriot, with its astounding action scenes and more thoughtful concerns, were smothered in dubiously manipulative depictions of history and cornball sentiment. On the other hand, Emmerich’s films also have a habit as coming on as cartoonish at first but eventually revealing more interesting things going on under the surface. Devilin meanwhile sank much money and clout into the awful 2006 film Flyboys. In any event, after a few failures, Emmerich and Devlin finally reunited to make a signal to their biggest hit, and in 2016 Independence Day: Resurgence was released. But its reception, to say the least, was not a case of history repeating.\n\nThe first Independence Day remains one of the signal pop culture events of its moment, and indeed stands now as perhaps the most essential relic of the mid-‘90s mood, that time when modern history was taking a breather between the Cold War and 9/11, between fear of nuclear holocaust and fear of global warming, and when Hollywood was urgently looking about for sources of danger and threat for genre films whilst special effects were going through a rapid evolution. 1996’s Twister had already announced a string of disaster movies as new showcases for those effects delivered as event movie fare, of which Titanic (1997) would prove the zenith, and in many ways Independence Day belongs to that movement too. But Independence Day is also a sci-fi movie, a war movie, a buddy movie, a comedy, and a freewheeling travelogue through the whole idea of pop culture as it had congealed by 1996. Whilst the style and pitch of Independence Day rejected edgy alternative culture trends in independent film and music, nonetheless it took much permission from TV shows like The Simpsons in ticking off pop culture reference points in jokey, knowing, audience-conspiring fashion, and exacerbated the Quentin Tarantino-era post-modern craze in merrily assembling assorted bits of a few dozen older movies into one big moveable feast, or as Devlin happily called it, a “movie movie.”\n\nIndependence Day is essentially a supersized remake of Byron Haskin’s The War of the Worlds (1953), stealing the basic proposition of an invasion of the Earth by blankly malevolent alien foes protected by energy shields that prove impenetrable whilst wielding annihilating force of their own. But where Haskin’s film maintained to some degree the thesis of H.G. Wells in portraying with vicious irony a mirror to the Western colonialist mindset and updated it with new atomic age logic as humanity is found completely helpless before the exterminating invaders, Independence Day is a paean to fighting pith turned on uppity enemies, turning towards Star Wars and old war movies in its last act. The film comes on with its pop culture referentialism carefully cross-indexed and counterweighted for maximum appeal. REM’s “It’s the End of the World As We Know It” heard near the outset box-ticks Gen X whilst a shout-out to John Lennon – “Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.” – serves the Boomers. A gag based in a quote from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and a clip from The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951) establish genre cred. The plot meanwhile is rooted in modern esoterica once restricted to obsessive fringe scenes but popularised in the decade by the hugely popular TV series The X-Files, like the 1947 Roswell “UFO” crash and Area 51, and the show is mentioned in the dialogue. The image of the Apollo 11 site being despoiled by alien intrusion signals the onset of millennium angst, breaking down the triumphal achievements of the Twentieth century zeitgeist in the face of an uneasy new historical nexus. Soft-target cultural satire drops like soaking drizzle, with gags about Los Angelinos firing their guns at the spaceship over their city, daffy onlookers hoping the aliens are going to bring back Elvis, and a character listing all the people he has to call and warn about the aliens including his lawyer – “Ah, screw my lawyer.”\n\nThis element of Independence Day, given its relative sparseness in Emmerich’s other movies, surely was Devlin’s special contribution, and whilst it hinders Independence Day from being the urgent genre classic it might have been, it also certainly helped mediate Emmerich’s delight in broad gestures and rooted his approach in a contemporary pop argot that even when dated still has an amusing crackle. It also recalls the way a ‘50s sci-fi movie could convince you a grand worldwide event was taking place on a shoestring budget with shots of extras supposedly in different places around the world listening to PA and radio broadcasts about the frightening new event. Emmerich pays heed to that tradition with a modern gloss, depicting the alien arrival through myriad TV news reports, and later including a montage of representative of different armed forces around the world craning their ears for low-tech Morse Code broadcasts setting up the last-ditch resistance. Emmerich’s visual exposition wields just the right sense of truly awesome things occurring, from the menacing opening shot of a massive shadow passing over the moon surface and setting the debris of the Apollo 11 landing shuddering, and the mysterious and eerie alien signal heard over speakers in an astronomical observatory. Independence Day keeps one foot firmly planted in its ‘50s sci-fi roots, also recalling Rudolph Maté’s When Worlds Collide (1951) and Fred F. Sears’ Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers (1956). The images of the colossal, circular alien space ships descending on Earth and hovering over cities meanwhile blatantly pinches famous images from the 1980s TV miniseries V. Whilst Independence Day in many ways set the scene for the modern blockbuster to be less a proper narrative but rather a succession of gestures in spectacle grown out of intertextual awareness – or to put that more simply, a movie that counts on us all having seen a lot of movies and not minding – Emmerich still draws and delivers pleasure in obeying the ritual narrative form. He would do a similarly good job depicting war coming close in eerie shots of gunfire flashing amongst trees in The Patriot.\n\nThose spaceships, fifteen in number, are disgorged by a gigantic mother ship that parks a short distance from Earth, and take up position over major cities around the world. The heroes of Independence Day are meanwhile flung together in a manner very reminiscent of 1970s disaster movies like The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and Earthquake (1974), predestined to unite and fight for survival. Emmerich establishes each in turn. President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), ensconced in the White House, with his Communications Secretary Connie Spano (Margaret Colin) fretting over his sliding popularity, sourced in apparently vacillating performance. Her ex-husband David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), an environmentally-conscious MIT graduate and satellite expert currently employed as a cable TV channel technician in Manhattan, plays chess in the park with his former rabbi father Julius (Jeff Hirsch), and is soon called in by his boss Marty Gilbert (Harvey Fierstein) when the alien signal starts playing havoc with the station’s broadcasts. Marine F-18 fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller (Smith) is on leave, sleeping in with his stripper girlfriend Jasmine Dubrow (Vivica A. Fox), oblivious to the gigantic spaceship floating over central LA, even as her son Dylan (Ross Bagley) plays at shooting them down. Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) is a crop-duster pilot and a hopeless alcoholic, constantly tormented by his neighbours for his claims of having been kidnapped by aliens ten years earlier and used in their experiments.\n\nEmmerich invests most of these introductions with notes of comedy that also help in differentiating the players. He delivers a jot of goofy slapstick as Russell lolls drunkenly against his plane, whilst his son Miguel (James Duval) berates him for dusting the wrong field. Whitmore dryly jokes on the phone with his wife Marilyn (Mary O’Connell) about confessing to sleeping with a beautiful brunette, actually his very young daughter Patricia (Mae Whitman) zonked out at his side. Levinson senior and junior talk with well-oiled, sarcastic New York Jewish humour. The joke of Hiller failing to notice the spaceship above is drawn out as he goes out to fetch his morning paper and slowly turns his head, seeing his neighbours packing in panic, at first assuming it’s over-reaction to an earth tremor. In a manner that services a need for character arcs but specially tooled for the ‘90s era with both its generational scepticism and anxiety about a waning sense of purpose, just about all of the heroes in Independence Day are in some way or another underachievers. Even the war hero former pilot president is a bit of a slacker in need of a new spur to action. Hiller, another great pilot, seems to be facing the stymieing of his dream of becoming an astronaut through his choice of partner. David, a scientific genius, claims to be very happy doing what he does, presumably because he feels he’s not participating in any worldly evil. Russell is redeemed from shambling wreck of a human to Christlike saviour of mankind.\n\nDavid’s special talent forces him soon to abandon his wilful obscurity when, analysing the alien signal shimmering underneath the TV satellite signal, realises it’s coordinating between the positioning spaceships and its diminishing loop is more or less a countdown to something he guesses can’t be good. Needing to warn someone in authority, David decides to dash to Washington and get Connie to secure him time with Whitmore, despite their uneasy past: David socked Whitmore back when he was a candidate and thought Connie was having an affair with him. He gets his father to drive him, and when Whitmore realises what David has discovered, immediately has all the White House staff including Connie and Secretary of Defense Albert Nimziki (James Rebhorn), as well as David and Julius, flown out of Washington on Air Force One. In LA, Jasmine’s fellow exotic dancer Tiffany (Kiersten Warren) ventures onto the roof of a skyscraper to join a mob welcoming the aliens, whilst Jasmine and Dylan flee the city. Marty is advised to do the same by David. When the countdown reaches it end, powerful energy beams spume out of the spaceships and devastate vast patches of cityscape beneath them, killing Tiffany and Marty and everyone else within range in orgiastic spectacles of destruction.\n\nEmmerich offers repeated references to Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), the preeminent example of a post-1960s countercultural viewpoint on the possibility of aliens as friendly and godlike, and the build-up to their arrival in a series of portentous, worldwide events. Emmerich depicts a vignette in a remote part of Iraq where the vast, boiling, blazing cloud around a descending ship is glimpsed, recalling Spielberg’s locale-hopping and visual portent of Biblical awe, but later mischievously despoiling Spielberg’s film when a helicopter is sent up to communicate with an alien ship with banks of flashing lights, only to be coldly blasted out of the air. A scene of Whitmore and his highest-ranking military leader, Marine General Grey (Robert Loggia), reluctantly agreeing to try using nuclear weapons on one alien craft, only for even that to fail against their energy shield, is a virtual carbon copy of the same scene in The War of the Worlds. The bluntly destructive and oblivious purpose of the aliens makes them perfect antagonists for an age crying out for a lack of moral complication in its big movies. One of the aliens, when Whitmore tries to communicate with it, tells him all they want humans to do is die. The images of the aliens blasting away at American cities, pounding the Empire State Building to rubble and blowing the White House to fiery smithereens, still have thunderous visual impact, and the latter was hailed as one of the key moments in modern special effects staging, as well as the movie’s most instantly identifiable image.\n\nThese scenes also channel decades of nuclear angst in a manner most mainstream movies had avoided, now finally making the subject of blockbuster silliness, before 9/11 would make it all too real again. The only victims of the annihilation we’re introduced to are Tiffany and Marty, both of them likeable but silly people, and Marty’s groan of “Oh, crap!” as he sees the fireball coming for him staves off the sense of horror with a note of absurdism. Meanwhile, David and Julius being hurriedly ushered onto Air Force One, which only just manages to take off ahead of the consuming fireball, nods to When Worlds Collide and its indulgence of a bleak but secretly thrilling fantasy, that of being near-pure luck catching a ride on the last flight out of the apocalypse. Jasmine and Dylan manage to find shelter off a road tunnel, with Emmerich making the chief point of suspense whether or not their pet dog can reach them in time to be saved. Spoiler: he does. Hiller and his fellow pilots are soon sent out to attack the ship over LA, but find the craft perfectly protected by a curtain of energy around it, against which both the missiles and hapless aircraft crash and explode.\n\nThe big ship disgorges a vast swarm of small fighters, also shield-protected, and the Earthling’s planes are swiftly decimated. Hiller’s pal Captain Jimmy Wilder (Harry Connick Jr) dies in failing to outmanoeuvre one alien fighter, and Hiller vengefully leads the alien craft into a swerving chase down the Grand Canyon: Hiller manages to contrive the alien’s crashlanding by catching it in a detached parachute and ejecting just before his plane collides with the canyon wall, the alien ship striking the upper lips of the canyon and sliding to a halt on the ground above. Hiller lands, struts to the craft, and when the alien within suddenly squirms out of a hatch he promptly socks it, declaring with a vigour that instantly knits him into the pantheon of wisecracking movie heroes from James Bond to John McClane, “Welcome to Earth!” This scene of course inscribed Smith as an instant major movie star, in ways both familiar and new. Hiller is immediately confirmed as a classical all-American hero, utterly masculine and charged with swagger, reflexively daring, resourceful, afraid of nothing, and also African-American: indeed perhaps only a Black man could so thoroughly own such traits in an age officially sceptical of heroes.\n\nIndependence Day is filled with a specific sense of 1990s America as a newly multicultural place capable of absorbing once-radical elements and outsiders into its gestalt identity. Wilder, playing the role of the squadron’s joker and morale-booster, performs an extended imitation of politician and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson by way of celebrating the squadron, not in a mocking way but instead anointing Jackson as a worthy leadership figure for heroes of all colours in the same way a character in a World War II movie might imitate FDR. The everything’s-cool-now, end-of-history fantasising is extended to later scenes that depict warriors of all nations, including Brits, Israelis, Iraqis, and Russians all coming together under American leadership against the evil alien foe, and of course Whitmore’s conceit in his famous pep speech of repurposing the Fourth of July as the world’s Independence Day. Many of course outside of the US rolled their eyes very hard, but it also summarised something about the ‘90s island of stability in a Pax Americana, and most viewers simply went with the flow whilst jamming their mouths full of popcorn. Irony streaks Independence Day as a film made by a gay German immigrant with unabashedly progressive politics dedicating a hymn to American militarism and imperial standing, and yet Emmerich bends his sense of those virtues to a newly inclusive and broad-minded parabola. That unswervingly heroic concept of patriotic identity is counterbalanced by a familiar brand of shallow satire on bureaucracy and the more obnoxious side of government, represented saliently by Nimziki, keeper of national secrets.\n\nNimziki’s name was a poke at a former studio executive who gave Emmerich and Devlin trouble on Stargate, a bad habit that would be more infamously repeated on Godzilla when they named a dipshit Mayor after film critic Roger Ebert. The film’s best line, one that delivers a drier joke than most and also sets up a crucial story pivot, works in very large part thanks to Rebhorn’s delivery, as Julius harangues Whitmore and others for knowing about the aliens after the Roswell crash and hiding them at Area 51 per UFO lore: Whitmore says that’s nonsense, but Nimziki suddenly decides it’s time to let him know that, “Ah, Mr President…that’s not entirely accurate.” Turns out Area 51 really does conceal an underground base housing a crashed UFO, which proves to be one of the alien fighter craft, with its long-dead crew preserved. The site is overseen militarily by Maj. Mitchell (Adam Baldwin), a central casting soldier, and scientifically by the long-haired and kooky Dr Okun (Brent Spiner), who is so delighted by the President’s arrival and the recent activation of the long-dormant alien technology thanks to the proximity of the new aliens that he’s oblivious to the terror and destruction above. Theorising the craft crashed on some scouting mission, Okun also explains that the aliens’ fearsome appearance, with cobra-like hood and vaguely humanoid build with squirming tentacular appendages, is actually a biomechanical suit around a smaller, rather squishier being with similar weaknesses to humans but communicate psychically rather than vocally.\n\nMeanwhile Hiller drags the still-unconscious alien he’s captured across a salt flat in Nevada. He encounters the Casses and other refugees in a huge fleet of mobile homes fleeing across the flats, and talks them into taking him to Area 51, which for some reason he’s aware of. Jasmine, wandering a devastated LA, starts helping survivors, and she find Marilyn Whitmore lying injured and bedraggled by the wreckage of her helicopter. Jasmine requisitions a flatbed truck and loads survivors in the back, heading to Hiller’s base and finding it destroyed, forcing her and her charges to camp out there. Along the way Jasmine bonds with the very different Marilyn – when she tells the First Lady she’s a dancer, Marilyn beams, “Ballet,” to Jasmine’s sheepish reply, “Exotic.” – and cares for her as her injuries take a toll, before they’re finally picked up by the army. The character relationships in Independence Day are clever not just in offering cheer-along arcs for the zeroes-to-heroes, but in having them all physically converge and unify or reconcile as well, made most immediately literal when David and Connie share a loving gesture whilst watching Hiller and Jasmine get married, at a time when just about every big Hollywood movie had to revolve around a sundered couple reuniting.\n\nSmith and Goldblum were basically hired to do slight variations on their already-familiar personas, with Smith transferring the likeably cocky braggadocio, mixed with just a little awareness of his own jive and determination to keep dancing anyway, of his character from the TV series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to the big screen, with a new edge of more muscular and matured confidence (although it took his more nuanced variation on his persona presented in Fred Schepisi’s Six Degrees of Separation, 1995, to establish his movie acting cred and sell him to Emmerich and Devilin). David is another of Goldblum’s rambling, gawky-sexy savants after The Fly’s (1986) Seth Brundle and Jurassic Park’s Ian Malcolm. Relieved from any need to get too inventive, the two actors are effortlessly charming, and when finally flung together prove to have truly fun chemistry (“Forget the fat lady! You’re obsessed with fat lady!”). Pullman, who became a star for about ten minutes in the mid-‘90s after ages on the periphery with the likes of The Serpent and the Rainbow (1987) and finally gaining fans with the rom-com While You Were Sleeping (1995), gained easily his most well-remembered role even as I recall some critics calling his President Whitmore a loser. Given that Pullman’s more recently found his true metier as a grizzled character actor, white-bread lead roles clearly never really tapped his deepest strengths, and yet his fightin’ President Whitmore is a definite strength of Independence Day, projecting low-key charm and hints of a hawkish glint in his eye whilst plugging his stolid way through the work of being a politician.\n\nThe obvious but certainly effective casting continues down to Hirsch’s arch, scene-stealing performance as Julius, Rebhorn to deliver antagonism, and Quaid’s high comedy presence. Other actors like Loggia, Dan Lauria as one of his underlings, and Baldwin are plainly required to evoke the old, tough, gruff or young, square-jawed military men of old war movies. One actor notably playing against his most familiar role is Spiner, his moon unit scientist Okun a total contrast to his part as the cyborg Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation, and he brings nutty energy to the film for his few scenes. The women in Independence Day have more thankless roles, by comparison, although they all do good work, particularly Colin, who never had such a high-profile part again. Where in late 1980 and ‘90s action cinema the figurative daughters of Ellen Ripley were becoming more prominent, Independence Day only points to Jasmine as a gutsy lady. The overall quality however is that the film absolutely requires every actor to walk a fine line, between total seriousness and a sense of crisp humour, avoiding campy knowing even as Emmerich and Devlin readily court that quality in their writing.\n\nWhilst it sported plenty of known faces, Independence Day nonetheless didn’t have a colossal star at its heart. That proved to its advantage as it helped mint a new one, and also emphasised the ensemble aspect of its story whilst helping keep costs down on a movie that, whilst very high-budget, still wasn’t nearly as expensive as other blockbusters around the same time. The selling point of the film was its special effects, although, with a record number of effects shots required in the production, the end results are occasionally uneven. Still, images of the alien ships, streaked by fire in their descent through the atmosphere, hovering in banks of boiling cloud over cityscapes, retain their instantly transfixing sense of evil, epic beauty, and the dog fights between the human and alien fighter craft confirmed massive leaps in technical reach and know-how even since the grand space battle of Star Wars – Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983). Emmerich’s shots of American fighters massing high above the rocky forms of the American desert landscape in preparation for the desperate final showdown below have thrilling, epic force and an interesting visual lustre thanks to Karl Walter Lindenlaub’s cinematography.\n\nAs so often in Emmerich’s oeuvre, the mixture of cutting-edge technical skill and formal elegance in his filmmaking baldly contrasts his dramatic sensibility, his desire to enfold the movie theatre full of people in a manner that provokes their knowing whilst also quietly nullifying it. Emmerich does so with an aesthetic that can only be described as straight-faced camp, an attitude the film finally, joyfully exalts in the climactic scenes involving Russell, in which Independence Day succeeds in both delivering a grand thrill and also finally outing itself as a crazy comedy. If Independence Day offers the best example of that talent, if not his best film, it’s largely because the light-hearted and serious elements are in the finest balance, chasing each-other around much like the warring craft in the climactic scene, and have roots in that specific sensibility I’ve mentioned. Emmerich’s arsenal of recurring motifs, particularly nerdy or weak-seeming men proving themselves valiant without needing to undercut the more traditionally heroic figures around them, are both reliable as crowd-pleasing flourishes but also seem to have genuinely obsessive meaning for Emmerich. Emmerich’s follow-ups like The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 have a more serious and nuanced tone, but that sits more uneasily with the increasingly silly, gotta-top-myself plotting and broader gestures, and Emmerich’s most recent works like Midway (2019) and Moonfall (2022) seems airbrushed in every regard to appeal to a decentralised audience, particularly the Chinese market.\n\nAfter getting their asses kicked seven ways from sunset, the humans finally start getting their act together in Independence Day after Hiller brings the alien to Area 51: Okun tries to surgically inspect the creature, only for it to awaken and go on a rampage. Confronting the alien via the glass wall of the operating room, Whitmore communicates with it, as the creature has a tentacle wrapped around his throat to exploit Okun’s vocal cords, and also when the creature links with Whitmore to share awareness of human only being the latest in a long line of exterminated foes of the rapacious, locust-like species. Whitmore collapses upon such psychic intrusion, and Mitchell, after asking if the glass is bulletproof, blows the alien away. When Whitmore decides to nuke the bastards, David vehemently protests and gets drunk, and after the bomb’s failure he flails around in anger and disgust. When his father tries to convince him to get off the floor because he might catch a cold, David suddenly has an inspiration: testing his theory out on the captive fighter craft, he proves the alien systems can be briefly disabled with a computer virus, taking down their protective shields, but also says the only sure way to deliver the virus is to fly the captive craft up into the mother ship. Hiller volunteers to fly David up there, as he feels he has the best idea of the craft’s capabilities.\n\nOnce launched in initially ungainly fashion, David and Hiller find themselves drawn into the enormous mother ship with a tractor beam and docked deep within it, with an alien controller glaring out at them, forcing them to hide whilst David works his magic. Wells’ idea of the aliens brought down by a virus is updated for a digital age is an idea with a little wit but also tends to be one detail of the plot many object to as the aliens don’t seem to have Norton Antivirus, although it can be explained in various ways; more irksome to me is the question as to why, when they were willing to a few hours earlier and even load up David and Hiller’s ship with one, the humans don’t have atomic missiles ready to hurl at the other ships rather than poking away at them with tiny payloads from their fighters. Whitmore elects to lead the hastily assembled squadron of aircraft to attack the craft rapidly zeroing in on Area 51, with Russell rapidly sobering himself up to join the assault and adapting awkwardly to a modern fighter. Before taking off, Whitmore gives the gathering pilots a pep talk from the back of a truck in pastiche of the St. Crispin’s Day scene from Kenneth Branagh’s Henry V (1989), as Whitmore, with words not quite of Shakespearean beauty, nonetheless declares that “we will not go quietly into the night!”, to thunderous appreciation, with Emmerich diving in with gleefully cornball eagerness to note a pilot giving a vehement salute. David meanwhile encourages his father to return to his metier as a rabbi, and proves urgently needed as the end seems nigh.\n\nIt goes without saying that Independence Day delivers on all it promises in its climax, with flashes of real storytelling savvy in touches like the first shot the fighters take at the approaching ship sees the shield still working, but Whitmore, with a cagey squint, decides to give it another go and this time hits home. David and Hiller settle down to light up the cigars as if in accepting defeat after they can’t escape the dock, only to then become a pair of mischievous boys about to really ruin the aliens’ day as they fire a nuclear missile into the control bay. The flee at speed, just managing, in time-honoured fashion, to beat the enormous closing doors. And, of course, the spectacle of Randy Quaid saving the world. After the fighters fail to bring down the ship and are forced to engage in a colossal dogfight with the alien craft, Whitmore fails with his last missile to hit the vulnerable-seeming energy cannon under the ship, and Russell finds his last missile won’t launch, and so decides to ram the cannon with his plane, screaming in madcap and vengeful delight (“Hello boys, I’m back!”) as he rides to oblivion and glory at the weapon, which is about to unleash exterminating force on Area 51 in a touch pilfered from Star Wars and that in turn pilfered from The Guns of Navarone (1961). It’s the sort of scene that’s impossible not to laugh at whilst watching, but that’s only a part of its awesomeness. Russell’s sacrifice succeeds, the ship explodes, and with the vulnerability exposed all the other assaults bring down their targets near such locales as Sydney and Giza. David and Hiller’s payload also explodes, blasting the mother ship to smithereens.\n\nIndependence Day ends with another arch remix of very recognisable imagery, this time from Phillip Kaufman’s The Right Stuff (1983), as David and Hiller are glimpsed leaving behind their crashed ship with a strut of success, puffing away on their cigars and greeted by their adoring women whilst flaming wreckage of the mother ship streaks through the sky, providing the ultimate July Four fireworks display. Independence Day works because it conspires with the audience, seeking out that part of us that secretly loves the old goofy stuff, and indeed by now it might even be taken as goofy old stuff itself, as it has managed to outlive its chosen release window unlike many ‘90s hits. Tim Burton’s Mars Attacks (1996) and Paul Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers (1997) provided immediate ripostes with their infinitely more sarcastic and cynical ransacking of Earth-vs-the-aliens plots, but of course, neither was anywhere near so popular. After a long time in development hell, a proper sequel came along almost twenty years to the day later, but Independence Day: Resurgence was doomed to be just a footnote to the original film’s success, particularly after Smith elected not to appear in it. Resurgence gained withering reviews at the time, but I mildly liked it: it certainly has a lot of problems, some sore lacks from the magic formula of the original, but some of those lacks ironically are woven in with aspects that are actually superior. Where the ‘96 film was sly and bouncy in its humour and general assurance to the audience that despite all the destruction and death this was just a fun bit of make-believe, Resurgence tries to take its ideas more seriously. This time Emmerich and his four (!) credited co-screenwriters including Devlin grapple with the notion of a rebuilt Earth, now armed with alien technology but having faced down an intervening two decades of disruption.\n\nWhere the original concludes on a note of unalloyed triumph and cheer, Resurgence states that parts of the world including central Africa faced years of vicious battle between humans and stranded aliens, and the landscape is still littered with the cavernous hulks of smashed alien death machines. The oncoming generation of warriors comprise orphans of the dead or those moulded by the conflict. Heroes like President Whitmore are now troubled and tormented by their encounters with the alien psychic ability, making them seem mentally unstable, whilst the imprisoned hordes of alien survivors, long catatonic, start waking up and celebrating when they sense more of their kind on the way. Most wrenching of all, Steven Hiller vanished during a trip to space, leaving his adopted son Dylan (Jessie T. Usher) as an anointed nepotistic hero in taking up his mantle as a pilot: bad blood persists between him and his former comrade Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) as Jake tried desperately to prove himself a better pilot in training and almost caused Dylan’s death. Jake, now flying transport craft in space, is at least still engaged to be married to Patricia Whitmore (Maika Monroe), who trained as a pilot alongside Jake and Dylan but now works as an aide to the current president, Elizabeth Lanford (Sela Ward), and cares for her father.\n\nIn the intervening twenty years Earth has known unparalleled peace and cooperation, with David Levinson (Goldblum again) having supervised exploitation of the alien tech to build defences and a controlling moonbase. As the twentieth anniversary of the assault looms, all hell breaks loose again when a spaceship approaches a moonbase and is shot down. Ignoring an order from Lanford to come home, David is helped to reach the moon crash site by Jake, who knows him through Patricia. The now-widowed David is accompanied by linguist and sometime lover Catherine Marceaux (Charlotte Gainsbourg), Floyd Rosenberg (Nicolas Wright), a government bureaucrat auditing David’s operation, Dikembe Umbutu (DeObia Oparei), a Congolese warlord who battled the aliens on the ground and whose insights into the aliens David and Catherine were studying, and Jake’s co-pilot Charlie Miller (Travis Tope), who grew up with Jake as orphans of the invasion. They retrieve a white spherical object from the moondust, just as a new, unimaginably large alien “Harvester” ship arrives and easily blows away the Earth’s new defences, before sweeping in over Eurasia, its gravity wake scooping up cities and scattering the rubble far and wide. Barely surviving as they’re dragged along for the ride, the team manage to get their find back to Area 51. David quickly recognises the Harvester intends to complete a process of drilling out the Earth’s core started in the previous assault. The recovered sphere is revealed to be an emissary of a cybernetic intelligence of a race that long since shed physical bodies, with the last survivor now leading a resistance against the aliens on a hidden planet and wanting to recruit humans to the cause.\n\nEmmerich managed to bring back Loggia for a brief cameo shortly before his death, and Hirsch, Fox, and Spiner for surprisingly substantial parts. Spiner’s Okun awakens from a twenty-year coma, and after a little dazed stumbling around quickly turns his eccentric intelligence to the new invasion: like Whitmore, he finds he has an inchoate connection with the aliens. Emmerich had previously kept allowing his sexuality into the first film only in jokey asides like a fellow pilot throwing up his hands in disavowal when he catches Hiller and Wilder in a pose that looks like Wilder is proposing marriage, and in Fierstein’s nelly performance. Here Emmerich made Okun more pointedly queer, having been assiduously cared for his assistant and romantic partner Dr Isaacs (John Storey) in his coma, and when Isaacs is killed by marauding aliens, Emmerich manages an engaging flicker of pathos before Okun goes nuts and starts gunning down the monsters. Julius, in a touch Emmerich recycled from 2012, is making a paltry living selling his book called How I Saved The World in a tour of rest homes, in between kicking back on his boat, which gets washed ashore on a tsunami as the alien craft arrives.\n\nRescued from the rubble by some orphaned youngsters (including Joey King and Mckenna Grace) who are trying to drive out of the disaster area, Julius finishes up taking them and some other kids in hand and making for Area 51. Fox gets the least to do as Jasmine, who’s become a doctor in the interim and dies whilst saving patients from her collapsing hospital. With the aliens’ return stimulating Whitmore and Okun and others to new life much like the alien captives and the old machines, Whitmore tries to warn Lanford of the impending attack. Lanford and many others in the order of succession are killed when the aliens penetrate their bunker. William Fichtner is cast against his usually villainous type in playing the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Joshua Adams, who also becomes President, although he doesn’t get any memorable speeches. Eventually the cyber-intelligence tells the humans that the aliens are actually ruled by queens, and no-one has ever managed to kill one of the queens that commander the Harvesters, which are incredibly big, smart, and tough, and obsessively dedicated to exterminating all of its hated cybernetic enemies. Realising this obsession is a crucial weakness, David devises a trap to lure in the queen and blow it up with an enormously powerful bomb that must be contained by a shield device. Patricia volunteers to deliver the bomb, but her father takes the ship carrying it instead and she follows in a fighter.\n\nThe least thrilling part of Resurgence comes ironically when Emmerich tries ever so hard to top the original’s city-levelling spectacle. He depicts the ridiculously large new alien ship, so big it spans about a fifth of the planet, tearing up cities and dropping pieces of Beijing and Kuala Lumpar on London, with the luckless heroes along for the ride. David sighs, “They like to get the landmarks,” as Jake narrowly dodges one of the Petronas Towers as it falls on Tower Bridge. The reasonably judicious effects in the ’96 film give way here to spectacular yet impersonal CGI and overlong sequences, and whilst the storyline throws up a range of intriguing new ideas and developments, the essential plot settles for an extended riff on the original. Both Hemsworth, who was being hyped at the time as his brother Chris’s edgier rival but has nothing like the same screen presence, and Usher are merely okay, whilst Trope is stuck with the modern cliché role of the overly-talkative and insecure guy. The pair constantly fall afoul of moonbase commander Jiang (Chin Han), whose stern disapproval Jake accepts as a good-looking rebel playing by his own rules. Where the first film was fleet and witty in setting up its characters and processing their various hang-ups in ideograms, Resurgence keeps stopping for clunky heart-to-hearts in the more familiar recent screenwriting style.\n\nAnother problem is inseparable from one of the more intriguing new choices, as Resurgence conjures an alternative reality to the real 2016. This one is filled with technology augmented or entirely changed by utilising the alien salvage, and an equally altered social and political landscape, allowing Emmerich to indulge a little liberal fantasising about an age of more environmentally friendly tech and gender and racial equity, even as he also works to darken the palette a little in noting the chaos reaped by the invasion. This development resembles some classic works of Japanese anime including The Macross Saga and Space Battleship Yamato, and the film overall sustains a live-action anime feel throughout. But the detail of this future is patchy, unsurprisingly given that Emmerich and Devilin’s conceptual thinking was never that advanced, making one wonder why with hovercopters and moon-hopping spacecraft are available most people are still getting about in old-school planes and motor vehicles (then again, access to technology has always been a many-tiered thing). The result compounds a feeling of blandness, missing the merry jingoism (in a film that also kisses a lot of Chinese butt for the sake of both financing and release there) without anything to replace it. Where the original’s humour drew so effectively from the zeitgeist of its making, Emmerich and Devlin have to use broader gags to try and fill the gap, like Okun wandering about with his rump showing through his hospital gown. The central trio of Jake, Dylan, and Patricia never get a chance to put their old camaraderie from training to work by coming together in battle.\n\nWhat I feel the film does get right however is worth noting. Goldblum and Pullman slot right back into their roles as if no time had elapsed. Where many recent films extending old franchises have proven awkward and often infuriating to fans in bringing back old heroes, David and Whitmore, even with a lot more grey hairs and some rough times behind them, feel consistent with the people they were before, and are as vital to the story as the inheriting youngsters. There’s a nice gag when Julius, driving up to Area 51 with his young charges in a school bus and unwittingly threatening the well-laid trap, is alerted to a “tall, dangling man” waving at him: “Tall? Dangling? That’s my David!” Monroe, who had anchored the horror film It Follows (2015) and emerged as one of the most talented and interesting starlets of the moment, is the best new element as Patricia, more substantially conceived as a next-generation representative than Dylan and the others. Her heartfelt shows of caring for her father are balanced by a warlike edge that emerges in the climactic scenes as every inch her father’s daughter. If the film had focused more squarely on her, it might not have been more popular, but it would have been stronger. One moment that feels equal to anything in the original comes when the Whitmores converse over radio as they fly towards battle, the old President telling Patricia, “I’m not saving the world, I’m saving you.” Angelababy’s Rain is another kick-ass woman pilot, but barely characterised beyond being exemplary and the awkward love interest for Charlie, although her first appearance amidst a flocking crowd of adoring fans offers a neat touch conflating different forms of celebrity worship.\n\nEmmerich interpolates what seems like an odd Vietnam allusion as Jake, Charlie, Dylan, and Rain fly inside the Harvester and try to blow it up, only to be foiled by cunning booby-traps and left tramping through the swampy undergrowth sustained within the vast hull’s contained ecosystem. There they battle aliens, with a neat reversal as Jake conspicuously fails to pull off the elder Hiller’s punch on an enemy. Finally they manage to escape in alien fighters, but find themselves locked into a swarm of such craft. Whitmore succeeds in penetrating the queen’s ship, which detaches from the Harvester to hunt down the cyber-intelligence. Whitmore blows the ship and himself up, in a fitting echo of Russell in the original, but the queen survives thanks to a personal shield, and returns to relentlessly trying to destroy her foes. Emmerich seems to be taking a second shot at Godzilla with the sight of the enormous queen stalking our heroes. Patricia, vengefully blasting the queen from on high, manages to knock out her shield, and Dylan and Rain, taking an enormous risk on Jake’s advice, manage to rip their craft out of the swarm and finish the queen off, causing the Harvester to depart. Okun excitedly tells the heroes that the cyber-intelligence is going to give them new technology including interstellar travel, and predicts, “We are gonna kick some serious alien ass!” just before the slam-cut ending. An amusing promise to leave off on, and one I wouldn’t have minded delivered on, but also likely to remain unfulfilled given Resurgence’s weak box office. Sometimes you just can’t go home again.\n\n.\n\nDirectors: Don Siegel / Philip Kaufman\n\nScreenwriters: Daniel Mainwaring / W.D. Richter\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nI said, “Hello!” again, a little louder, jiggling the phone, the way you do, but the line was dead, and I put the phone back. In my father’s day a night operator, whose name he’d have known, could have told him who’d called…But now we have dial phones, marvelously efficient, saving you a full second or more every time you call, inhumanly perfect, and utterly brainless; and none of them will ever remember where the doctor is at night, when a child is sick and needs him. Sometimes I think we’re refining all humanity out of our lives. – Jack Finney, The Body Snatchers\n\nJack Finney’s The Body Snatchers began life as a serialised story in Colliers Magazine and was published as a novel in 1955. Finney, a former copywriter and journalist, became adept at writing in many a genre with the discipline of a shrewd professional. He wrote many crime stories, some of which were also adapted as films, including Phil Karlson’s 5 Against The House (1955), although his biggest publishing success was the 1970 time travel tale Time And Again. The Body Snatchers was received harshly by some science fiction writers and critics as a variation on an already well-worn idea: Robert Heinlein and Philip K. Dick had already explored very similar notions. Even when adapted as a movie in 1956, it was following Jack Arnold’s It Came From Outer Space (1953) in employing the theme of people in a small town replaced by alien doppelgangers. But Finney knew how to place such a story in a resolutely believable and human context, and Don Siegel’s adaptation immediately made the story the most famous variation on the theme, lodging itself in the popular consciousness and birthing the phrase “pod people” in common parlance. The hyped-up retitling initially gave it a trashy lustre but the film’s quality quickly grabbed critical attention, helping cement Siegel’s reputation.\n\nSiegel himself, unlike Arnold, wasn’t drawn to science fiction by inclination, and like Finney was more associated with thrillers. But it was precisely this likeness, each creative hand’s skill in grounding a tale in an immediately substantial and quotidian sense of the world, that would lend the story its specific texture. Eventually Invasion of the Body Snatchers was lodged as a diamond-hard genre film classic, an eternal touchstone for anyone who saw it when young and had their love for dark thrills galvanised. It also proved a ready template, officially remade three times, and imitated and lampooned endlessly. Philip Kaufman’s first remake, released in 1978, rode a wave of new interest in sci-fi cinema following the success of Star Wars (1977), as studios scrambled to find genre properties that could be quickly given a new gloss with modern special effects. Kaufman’s version immediately inspired and influenced a string of remakes, including John Carpenter’s The Thing (1982), David Cronenberg’s The Fly (1986), and Chuck Russell’s The Blob (1988), adding new lashings of gruesome corporeal detail and radicalism to a fairly clean-cut and beloved movie in a manner that divided fans of the originals. But the most interesting disparities between the two films speak more of the radical social shifts in the twenty-two years that separate them, and the distinctive perspectives of their directors.\n\nSiegel was noted as a studio hand who’d risen to become a master editor at Warner Bros., and fought to get a break as director. Far from finding himself washed up as the studio system declined, Siegel thrived in the grittier climes of the 1960s and ‘70s, noted for his spiky tales of antiheroic misfits and his fascination for dramas pitting avatars of anarchy and control in direct, almost schizoid opposition. Kaufman, by contrast, was a literate bohemian turned filmmaker who started making movies in the mid-1960s but who didn’t start gaining traction until his fortunes aligned with the emerging Movie Brat generation. Both films retained the same basic structure and stuck fairly closely to Finney’s storyline, although Kaufman’s version transferred the setting from the small California town of Santa Mira to the urban zones of San Francisco and altered aspects of the character drama. Finney’s lead character Miles Bennell is a doctor in his home town Santa Mira who reconnects with his former teenage flame Becky Driscoll, and they edge into a tentative romance again as both are recovering from divorce.\n\nKaufman and his screenwriter W.D. Richter reconfigured this so Bennell, rechristened Matthew, is a health inspector and Becky, now Elizabeth, is a colleague and friend with an obvious spark of connection although Elizabeth’s married. In both versions Bennell begins encountering anxious people who report that loved ones have been replaced by beings that look, sound, and act just like the people they know and yet are missing some vital defining trait. Bennell consults a psychiatrist friend, named Dan Kauffman in the original and David Kibner in the remake, who insists the phenomenon is purely mental. But Bennell’s writer friend Jack Belicec and his wife call him to take a look at a mysterious body that’s appeared on their premises, looking like an unfinished version of Jack. A terrible truth begins to emerge: people are being replaced by lookalikes growing out of seed pods with an extra-terrestrial origin, mimetic organisms able to absorb every characteristic of humans save any capacity for authentic emotion.\n\nFinney’s book had laid down a fine blueprint for describing the tensions between communal and individual identity. The main characters cut across the grain of their surrounds and old-fashioned social presumptions, with Miles and Becky as divorcees, whilst Miles and Kauffman and Belicec comprising something like the intelligentsia of their town with just a faint hint of the siege mentality such cliques often feel, an aspect Kaufman would elaborate on, just as their names nod to the polyglot state of American society. Siegel’s version doesn’t expend a great deal of time setting up the social backdrop of Santa Mira, because he doesn’t need to: it’s so damn ordinary, the people wandering through it familiar with their howdy-neighbour grins, everyone performing a function, from Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) to Kauffman (Larry Gates) to Police Chief Nick Grivett (Ralph Dumke) to gas repairman Charlie (Sam Peckinpah). The first sign of disturbance to the status quo comes as Bennell sees young Jimmy Grimaldi (Bobby Clark) running away from the family fruit stand, gripped by the conviction his mother isn’t his mother. Bennell soon finds the same apparent delusion gripping several other people, including Becky’s friend Wilma (Virginia Christine) who swears her Uncle Ira (Tom Fadden) isn’t her Uncle Ira. “A strange neurosis, evidently contagious – an epidemic of mass hysteria,” Kauffman judges it, and to Miles’ question what causes it, responds: “Worry about what’s going on in the world, probably.”\n\nSiegel’s Invasion of the Body Snatchers has long been the object of debate as to whether it can be considered as a political parable, with factional readings rooted in its era taking it as either a metaphor for the anti-Communist panic of McCarthyism, where a community gangs up on a small and hapless group to destroy or assimilate outliers, or rather the opposite, a vision of Communist infiltration, as the lookalikes conform to certain canards about the Red Menace, detached and enforcing a collective, hive-mind-like system. The quote from Finney’s book above indicates his target was something at once vaguer and more thoroughly encompassing, a general portrait of modernity as a state of perpetual, alienating shock, defined by a constant succession of nudges away from immediate human reference into a state of prophylaxis. Political readings blur into each-other from such a perspective, the desire to project insidious and malignant motives onto an Other a desperate attempt to return shape to communal experience, which is subject to a constant, intense process of homogenisation. Siegel had a love for characters who, for whatever reason, exist on the outskirts of society and try to operate according to their own very peculiar code. Here he’d found a perfect ironic text to explore his obsession, one that allowed him to make his heroes at once beings apart and the final exemplars of “normality,” the act of retaining their individuality valorised above all else but also doomed to cost them everything.\n\nAt the same time, the story echoes more personally and immediately, speaking to a basic aspect of human experience that’s hard to portray dramatically. The fear of changes in people we know and love, the tiny, almost imperceptible alterations in behaviour tha"
