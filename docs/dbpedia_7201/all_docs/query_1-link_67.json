        "text": "From Couture to Cinema: Why Is Saint Laurent Leaping into Film? Saint Laurent Productions' recent venture into film production is a stellar example of business agility and innovation. If you have not heard, the French fashion house stepped into the cinematic world just last year, co-producing three films for the 77th Cannes Film Festival. The move is exciting and a strategic masterstroke highlighting businesses' need to diversify and rethink their revenue streams. The global economy demands agility and foresight. Saint Laurent's leap into film, collaborating with producers like Saïd Ben Saïd, showcases a brilliant use of their brand strength to explore new territories. Besides adding revenue, it will enrich the brand's narrative and connect with audiences in new ways. Watching Saint Laurent navigate this transition inspires optimism for the future of cross-sector innovation. By stepping into cinema, they're not just making movies—they're weaving resilience and growth into their brand story in an era full of challenges and possibilities. I love this story and can't wait to watch the movies! https://lnkd.in/e6uu2gXJ\n\nThe great thing about being a filmmaker is living vicariously through your projects. In a period of my life where I've felt especially drawn to the outdoors, I'm so grateful anytime I get to explore that in my work. This project for Sophisticated Country Lady was a dream, getting to focus specifically on the texture of nature. What do you see, feel, hear, and imagine? Just like the product, the video captures the elegance and magic of the countryside as well as the product itself. Authenticity is always the best route in a brand film, finding the beating heart behind a product, and matching its energy. #fashionfilm #brandfilm #marketing #advertising\n\nThe Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity came to a close last week. The Publicis-owned Leo Burnett emerged as the most successful Indian representative with 45 points followed by McCann Worldwide at 28. Ogilvy stood third with 23 points. India won 18 metals, its lowest tally since 2019 when it had won the same number of Lions. There was no Grand Prix for any Indian agency. The shiniest of Lions were two yellow metals, one for McCann Worldgroup - Gurugram and the other for Leo Burnett (Subsidiaries of Publicis Groupe) - Mumbai. 1. McCann Worldgroup (CEO APAC- Prasoon Joshi) bagged India's first Gold metal of the year at Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity 2024 in the 'Health and wellness' category. It won it for the \"Fit My Feet\" campaign that it crafted for Buckaroo India Footwear. Incidentally, this campaign also bagged a bronze metal in the same category and was also shortlisted for the 'Brand experience and activation' category. Here is the Campaign Link to watch - https://lnkd.in/dC7M5B9a P.S. - Stay Tuned to know more such exciting news and updates in the advertising and marketing world. . . #canneslions #creativityaward #cannesindia #publicisgroup #McCannworldwide #marketingagency #goldlions #digitalmarketingagency #worldwidewinners #adityaprenuer #adityapahwa #paidads #performancemarketer\n\nContentAsia's latest Formats Outlook report for first half 2024 will be out in a few weeks, in time for the #ContentAsiaSummit in Taipei in early September. While we chase the last bits of data and work with the fabulous Moxy Analytics on making it all mean more (and look pretty), a few things are already clear. The dominant scramble – no surprises here – is for budgets. Exactly how much of the old $$$$ have evaporated from original production budgets in Asia (and specifically how much of that is for format adaptations) is difficult to know, but the general situation is clear from earnings reports/stock market filings. At the same time, the appetite for big-brand unscripted titles continues in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and others. Shows like #idol and #MaskedSinger are in multiple seasons. The classic #FamilyFeud lives on in new ways. In Cambodia, a third season of #Masterchef went on air in Q2. Mongolia is on season 13 of #Gogglebox. In Thailand, #ICanSeeYourVoice has run for seven seasons already, and there's more. The popularity of #WhoWantstobeaMillionaire and #BigBrother seems to be never ending in India/South Asia. Even Singapore is stepping back into this ring after about 20 years, commissioning the first local version of #cjenm Korean blockbuster, \"I Can See Your Voice\", for a 2025 release across #mediacorp platforms. There's so much more... coming soon. For now tho, here's celebrating the unscripted formats nominees in the 2024 ContentAsia Awards... with a reminder that winners will be announced on 5 September in Taipei during the #trendytaipei festival. Join Us!

Let's dive into what a licensing negotiation would look like between Givenchy and Disney... Both parties have heavily protected intellectual property. Disney in particular will want to ensure that Givenchy utilizes its IP in the correct way. The Frozen logo and iconography should all be used in accordance with Disney's approval and requirements. Strict approval rights will also be very important, not just for product development, but for manufacturing, promotion, and advertisement of the capsule collection. Disney will likely look for a high royalty and minimum guarantee, while Givenchy will want to ensure that Disney indemnifies them for any third-party claims arising out of their use of Disney's intellectual property. What do you think about Givenchy's Frozen collection? Disclaimer: Your legal matter, case and/or outcome may vary. This content is not legal advice. There is no agreement to provide legal representation.

That's an example of scent marketing, which is becoming increasingly popular in the cinema industry. Scent marketing is the use of specific scents to evoke emotions and create a memorable experience for customers. Here are some benefits of scent marketing for cinemas: 1. Increased sales - The smell of fresh popcorn can increase sales at concession stands. When customers smell the aroma of popcorn, it can trigger their appetite and make them more likely to purchase snacks. 2. Improved customer experience - Scent marketing can enhance the overall customer experience. By creating a unique and memorable scent, cinemas can create a positive association with their brand and make customers more likely to return. 3. Enhanced emotional connection - Scents can evoke emotions and create a connection with the audience. For example, the smell of fresh popcorn can create feelings of nostalgia, which can enhance the movie-watching experience. 4. Competitive advantage - Scent marketing can help cinemas stand out from their competitors. By creating a unique and memorable scent, cinemas can differentiate themselves and attract more customers. Overall, scent marketing can provide a range of benefits for cinemas, from increasing sales to improving the overall customer experience. https://lnkd.in/eQ7Eng6m"
