        "text": "Novelist Owen Wister was born in Germantown, Pennsylvania, on July 14, 1860. His 1902 novel The Virginian helped create the myth of the American cowboy. Reared and educated on the east coast, Wister first visited the West in 1885. Set in Medicine Bow, Wyoming, The Virginian‘s tender romance between a refined Eastern schoolteacher and a rough-and-tumble cowhand, with its climactic pistol gunfight, introduced themes now standard to the American Western.\n\nWhatever he did, he did with his might. The bread that he earned was earned hard, the wages that he squandered were squandered hard…. If he gave his word, he kept it.\n\nOwen Wister, The Virginian. New York: The MacMillan Company, 1902. p.ix Rare Book Selections. Rare Book and Special Collections Division\n\nA popular fascination with the disappearing frontier laid the foundation of the Western’s success. Former Indian scout Buffalo Bill Cody capitalized on this interest when he brought the Wild West east in 1883. With a cast of 100 cowboys and Indians, sharpshooter Annie Oakley, and a menagerie of wild animals, Buffalo Bill’s Wild West parade played for packed audiences into the twentieth century.\n\nFrom the outset, the cowboy was a stock character of the motion picture industry. Variety Stage Sound Recordings and Motion Pictures features two early movies with cowboy motifs. A Frontier Flirtation (1903) presents the cowboy as a questionable character, unsuited to court a lady, while the no-nonsense gunslinger of Alphonse and Gaston cuts short the lead characters’ exaggerated civilities.\n\nThe Great Train Robbery (1903), included in the collection Selections from the National Film Registry, was shot in the Edison New York studio and in New Jersey at Essex County Park and at the Lackawanna Railway. The bandit leader was played by Justus D. Barnes, and G. M. Anderson, later better-known as Bronco Billy, played a variety of roles. In 1905, Edison parodied The Great Train Robbery in The Little Train Robbery, employing a cast of child actors."
