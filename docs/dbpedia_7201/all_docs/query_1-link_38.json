        "text": "Westerns are one of the most masculine and stereotypical of film genres. In a social and film context where gender equality is increasingly important, it is worth looking at the evolution of the genre in recent years. Especially because, as André Bazin said, the Western is “cinema par excellence” (1966) and its analysis allows a reflection on cinema itself. Taking the figure of the Marlboro Man as a prototype, this study carries out an analysis of three selected case studies: Brokeback Mountain, Jane Got a Gun and Godless, two films and a miniseries with main characters that do not follow heteronormative masculinity. Ang Lee’s work broke new ground not only in Westerns but also in industrial cinema by making homosexuality visible, while Gavin O’Connor’s showed the possibility of a woman playing the leading role in a classic Western. The miniseries produced by Netflix combines both by giving leading roles to female characters, some of them gay, while reflecting on homosexuality. It w...\n\nAmanda Howell offers a new perspective on the contemporary pop score, as the means by which masculinities not seen—or heard—before became a part of American cinema after World War II. Popular Film Music and Masculinity in Action considers an eclectic mix of film, from Elvis and Travolta star vehicles to Bruckheimer-produced blockbuster action, with a special focus on the work of musically innovative directors Melvin Van Peebles, Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, and Gregg Araki. Of particular interest is the way these films and their representations of masculinity are shaped by generic exchanges among contemporary music, music cultures, and film, combining American cinema's longstanding investment in violence-as-spectacle with similarly body-focused pleasures of contemporary youth music. Drawing on the scholarship of popular music and the pop score, as well as feminist film and media studies, Howell addresses an often neglected area of gender representation by considering cinematic masculinity as an audiovisual construction. Through her analyses of music's role in action and other film genres that share its investment in violence, she reveals the mechanisms by which the pop score has helped to reinvent gender—and gendered fictions of male empowerment—in contemporary screen entertainment."
