        "text": "George Burns was an American actor, comedian, singer, and published author. He formed a comedy duo with his wife Gracie Allen (1895-1964), and typically played the straight man to her zany roles. Following her death, Burns started appearing as a solo performer. He once won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and continued performing until his 90s. He lived to be a centenarian, was viewed as an \"elder statesman\" in the field of comedy.\n\nBurns was born under the name \"Nathan Birnbaum\" in 1896, and was nicknamed \"Nattie\" by his family. His father was Eliezer \"Louis\" Birnbaum (1855-1903), a coat presser who also served a substitute cantor at a local synagogue in New York City. His mother was Hadassah \"Dorah\" Bluth (1857-1927), a homemaker. Both parents were Jewish immigrants, originally from the small town of Kolbuszowa in Austrian Galicia (currently part of Poland). Kolbuszowa had a large Jewish population until World War II, when the German occupation forces in Poland relocated the local Jews to a ghetto in Rzesz√≥w.\n\nThe Birnbaums were a large family, and Burns had 11 siblings. He was the 9th eldest of the Birnbaum Children. In 1903, Louis Birnbaum caught influenza and died, during an ongoing influenza epidemic. Orphaned when 7-years-old, Burns had to work to financially support his family. He variously shined shoes, run errands, selling newspapers, and worked as a syrup maker in a local candy shop.\n\nBurns liked to sing while working, and practiced singing harmony with three co-workers of similar age. They were discovered by letter carrier Lou Farley, who gave them the idea to perform singing in exchange for payment. The four children soon started performing as the \"Pee-Wee Quartet\", singing in brothels, ferryboats, saloons, and street corners. They put their hats down for donations from their audience, though their audience was not always generous. In Burns' words: \"Sometimes the customers threw something in the hats. Sometimes they took something out of the hats. Sometimes they took the hats.\"\n\nBurns started smoking cigars c. 1910, when 14-years-old. It became a lifelong habit for him. Burns' performing career was briefly interrupted in 1917, when he was drafted for service in World I. He eventually failed his physical exams, due to his poor eyesight.\n\nBy the early 1920s, he adopted the stage name \"George Burns\", though he told several different stories of why he chose the name. He supposedly named himself after then-famous baseball player George Henry Burns (1897-1978), or the also famous baseball player George Joseph Burns (1889-1966). In another version, he named himself after his brother Izzy \"George\" Birnbaum, and took the last name \"Burns\" in honor of Burns Brothers Coal Company.\n\nBurns performed dance routines with various female partners, until he eventually married his most recent partner Gracie Allen in 1926. Burns made his film debut in the comedy short film \"Lambchops\" (1929), which was distributed by Vitaphone. The film simply recorded one of Burns and Allen's comedy routines from vaudeville.\n\nBurns made his feature film debut in a supporting role of the musical comedy \"The Big Broadcast\" (1932). He appeared regularly in films throughout the 1930s, with his last film role for several years appearing in the musical film \"Honolulu\" (1939). Burns was reportedly considered for leading role in \"Road to Singapore\" (1940), but the studio replaced him with Bob Hope (1903-2003).\n\nBurns and Allen started appearing as comic relief for a radio show featuring bandleader Guy Lombardo (1902-1977). By February 1932, they received their own sketch comedy radio show. The couple portrayed younger singles, until the show was retooled in 1941 and started featuring them as a married couple. By the fall of 1941, the show had evolved into a situational comedy about married life. Burns and Allen's supporting cast included notable voice actors Mel Blanc, Bea Benaderet, and Hal March.\n\nThe radio show finally ended in 1949, reworked into the popular television show \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\" (1950-1958). Allen would typically play the \"illogical\" housewife, while Burns played the straight man and broke the fourth wall to speak to the audience. The couple formed the production company McCadden Corporation to help produce the show.\n\nAllen developed heart problems during the 1950s, and by the late 1950s was unable to put up the energy needed for the show. She fully retired in 1958. The show was briefly retooled to \"The George Burns Show\" (1958-1959), but Burns comedic style was not as popular as that of his wife. The new show was canceled due to low ratings.\n\nFollowing Allen's death in 1964, Burns attempted a television comeback by creating the sitcom \"Wendy and Me\" (1964-1965) about the life of a younger married couple. The lead roles were reserved for Ron Harper and Connie Stevens, while Burns had a supporting role as their landlord. He also performed as the show's narrator.\n\nAs a television producer, Burns produced the military comedy \"No Time for Sergeants\", and the sitcom \"Mona McCluskey\". As an actor, he mostly appeared in theaters and nightclubs. Burns had a career comeback with the comedy film \"The Sunshine Boys\" (1975), his first film appearance since World War II. He played faded vaudevillian Al Lewis, who has a difficult relationship with his former partner Willy Clark (played by Walter Matthau). The role was met with critical success, and Burns won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. At age 80, Burns was the oldest Oscar winner at the time. His record was broken by Jessica Tandy in 1989.\n\nBurns had his greatest film success playing God in the comedy film \"Oh, God!\" (1977). The film 51 million dollars at the domestic box office, and was one of the greatest hits of 1977. Burns returned to the role in the sequels \"Oh, God! Book II\" (1980) and \"Oh, God! You Devil\" (1984). He had a double role as both God and the Devil in the last film.\n\nBurns had several other film roles until the 1990s. His most notable films in this period were the musical comedy \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1978), the comedy film \"Just You and Me, Kid\" (1979), the caper film \"Going in Style\" (1979), and the fantasy-comedy \"18 Again!\" (1988). The last of the four featured him as a grandfather who exchanges souls with his grandson.\n\nBurns' last film role was a bit part in the mystery film \"Radioland Murders\" (1994), which was a box office flop. In July 1994, Burns fell in his bathtub and underwent surgery to remove fluid in his skull. He survived, but his health never fully recovered. He was forced to retire from acting and stand-up comedy.\n\nOn January 20, 1996, Burns celebrated his 100th birthday, but was in poor health and had to cancel a pre-arranged comeback performance. In March 1996, he suffered from cardiac arrest and died. He was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Glendale, next to Gracie Allen.\n\nThis velvet-toned jazz baritone and sometime actor was (and perhaps still is) virtually unknown to white audiences. Yet, back in the late 1930s and early 1940s, Herb Jeffries was very big...in black-cast films. Today he is respected and remembered as a pioneer who broke down rusted-shut racial doors in Hollywood and ultimately displayed a positive image as a black actor on celluloid.\n\nThe Detroit native was born Umberto Alejandro Ballentino on September 24, 1911 (some sources list 1914). His white Irish mother ran a rooming house, and his father, whom he never knew, was of mixed ancestry and bore Sicilian, Ethiopean, French, Italian and Moorish roots. Young Herb grew up in a mixed neighborhood without experiencing severe racism as a child. He showed definitive interest in singing during his formative teenage years and was often found hanging out with the Howard Buntz Orchestra at various Detroit ballrooms.\n\nAfter moving to Chicago, he performed in various clubs. One of his first gigs was in a club allegedly owned by Al Capone. Erskine Tate signed the 19-year-old Herb to a contract with his Orchestra at the Savoy Dance Hall in Chicago. While there Herb was spotted by Earl 'Fatha' Hines, who hired him in 1931 for a number of appearances and recordings. It was during the band's excursions to the South that Jeffries first encountered blatant segregation. He left the Hines band in 1934 and eventually planted roots in Los Angeles after touring with Blanche Calloway's band. There he found employment as a vocalist and emcee at the popular Club Alabam. And then came Duke Ellington, staying with his outfit for ten years. Herb started his singing career out as a lyrical tenor, but, on the advice of Duke Ellington's longtime music arranger, Billy Strayhorn, he lowered his range.\n\nThe tall, debonair, mustachioed, blue-eyed, light-complexioned man who had a handsome, matin√©e-styled Latin look, was a suitable specimen for what was called \"sepia movies\" -- pictures that played only in ghetto and/or segregated theaters and were advertised with an all-black cast. Inspired by the success of Gene Autry, Herb made his debut as a crooning cowboy with Harlem on the Prairie (1937), which was considered the first black western following the inauguration of the talkies. Dark makeup was applied to his light skin and he almost never took off his white stetson which would have revealed naturally brown hair. A popular movie, Herb went on to sing his own songs (to either his prairie flower and/or horse) in both The Bronze Buckaroo (1939) and Harlem Rides the Range (1939). Outside the western venue, he starred in the crimer Two-Gun Man from Harlem (1938). As the whip-snapping, pistol-toting, melody-gushing Bronze Buckaroo, Jeffries finally offered a positive alternative to the demeaning stereotypes laid on black actors. Moreover, he refused to appear in \"white\" films in which he would have been forced to play in servile support.\n\nIn the midst of all this, Herb continued to impress as a singer and made hit records of the singles \"In My Solitude\", \"I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good\", \"When I Write My Song\", Duke Ellington's \"Jump for Joy\" and his signature song \"Flamingo\", which became a huge hit in 1941. Some of the songs he did miss out on which could have furthered his name, were \"Love Letters\" and \"Native Boy\". During the 1950s Herb worked constantly in Europe, especially in France, where he owned his own Parisian nightclub for a time. He also starred in the title film role of Calypso Joe (1957) co-starring Angie Dickinson and later appeared on episodes of \"I Dream of Jeannie\", \"The Virginian\" and \"Hawaii Five-0\".\n\nAlthough he very well could have with his light skin tones, the man dubbed \"Mr. Flamingo\" never tried to pass himself off as white. He was proud of his heritage and always identified himself as black. In the mid-1990s, westerns returned in vogue and Herb recorded a \"comeback album\" (\"The Bronze Buckaroo Rides Again\") for Warner Western. During this pleasant career renaissance he has also been asked to lecture at colleges, headline concerts and record CDs. In 1999-2000, at age 88, he recorded the CD \"The Duke and I\", recreating songs he did with Duke. It also was a tribute honoring the great musician's 100th birthday.\n\nHis five marriages, including one to notorious exotic dancer Tempest Storm, produced five children. At age 90-plus, Herb \"Flamingo\" Jeffries, lived in the Palm Springs area with significant other (and later his fifth wife) Savannah Shippen, who is 45 years his junior, remaining one of the last of the original singing cowboys still alive (along with Monte Hale) until he finally passed away on May 25, 2014, having hit the century mark.\n\nIn 2003 he was inducted into the Cowboy Hall of Fame and was invited to sing for President Bush at the White House. He is also the last surviving member of The Great Duke Ellington Orchestra, and certainly deserves proper credit for his historic efforts in films and music.\n\nOne of Hollywood's more high-flying dancers on film, dimpled, robust, fair-haired Marc Platt provided fancy footwork to a handful of \"Golden Era\" musicals but truly impressed in one vigorous 1950s classic.\n\nBorn to a musical family on December 2, 1913 in Pasadena, California as Marcel Emile Gaston LePlat, he was the only child of a French-born concert violinist and a soprano singer. After years on the road, the family finally settled in Seattle, Washington. Following his father's death, his mother found a job at the Mary Ann Wells' dancing school while young Marc earned his keep running errands at the dance school. He eventually became a dance student at the school and trained with Wells for eight years who saw great potential in Marc.\n\nIt was Wells who arranged an audition for Marc with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo when the touring company arrived in Seattle. The artistic director L√©onide Massine accepted him at $150 a week and changed his name to Marc Platoff in order to maintain the deception that the company was Russian. A highlight was his dancing as the Spirit of Creation in Massine's legendary piece \"Seventh Symphony\". Platt also choreographed during his time there, one piece being Ghost Town (1939), which was set to music by Richard Rodgers. While there he met and married (in 1942) dancer Eleanor Marra. They had one son before divorcing in 1947. Ted Le Plat, born in 1944, became a musician as well as a daytime soap and prime-time TV actor.\n\nAnxious to try New York, Marc left the ballet company in 1942 and moved to the Big Apple where he changed his marquee name to the more Americanized \"Marc Platt\" and pursued musical parts. Following minor roles in the short run musicals \"The Lady Comes Across\" (January, 1942) with Joe E. Lewis, Mischa Auer and Gower Champion and \"Beat the Band\" (October-December, 1942) starring Joan Caulfield, Marc and Kathryn Sergava found themselves cast in a landmark musical, the Rodgers and Hammerstein rural classic \"Oklahoma!\" Choreographer Agnes de Mille showcased them in the ground-breaking extended dream sequence roles of (Dream) Curly and (Dream) Laurey. Platt stayed with the show for a year but finally left after Columbia Pictures signed him to a film contract.\n\nAside from a couple of short musical films, he made his movie feature debut with a featured role as Tommy in Music Box Girls (1945) starring Rita Hayworth. From there he appeared in the Sid Caesar vehicle Tars and Spars (1946) and back with Rita Hayworth in Eine G√∂ttin auf Erden (1947). Columbia tried Marc out as a leading man in one of their second-string musicals When a Girl's Beautiful (1947) opposite Adele Jergens and Patricia Barry but did not make a great impression. Featured again in the non-musical adventure Blutfehde (1948) starring Ellen Drew and Larry Parks and the Italian drama Ihre wunderbare L√ºge (1949) based on Puccini's \"La Boheme,\" Marc's film career dissipated.\n\nAfter appearing on occasional TV variety shows such as \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and \"The Colgate Comedy Hour\" and following a single return to Broadway in the musical \"Maggie\" (1953, Platt returned to film again after a five-year absence but when he finally did, he made a superb impression as one of Howard Keel's uncouth but vigorously agile woodsman brothers (Daniel) in MGM's Eine Braut f√ºr sieben Br√ºder (1954). The film still stands as one of the most impressive dancing pieces of the \"Golden Age\" of musicals. He followed this with a minor dancing role (it was James Mitchell who played Dream Curly here) in the film version of Oklahoma (1955).\n\nWhen the musical film lost favor in the late 1950's, Marc finished off the decade focusing on straight dramatic roles on TV with roles in such rugged series as \"Sky King,\" \"Wyatt Earp\" and \"Dante\". By the 1960s Marc had taken off his dance shoes and turned director of the ballet company at New York's Radio City Music Hall. He and his second wife, Jean Goodall, whom he married back in 1951 and had two children (Donna, Michael), also ran a dance studio of their own. Following this they left New York and moved to Fort Myers, Florida where they set up a new dance school.\n\nMarc moved to Northern California to be near family following his wife's death in 1994 and occasionally appeared at the Marin Dance Theatre in San Rafael. One of his last performances was a non-dancing part in \"Sophie and the Enchanted Toyshop\" at age 89. In 2000, Marc was presented with the Nijinsky Award at the Ballets Russe's Reunion. He appeared in the 2005 documentary Ballets Russes (2005). Platt died at the age of 100 at a hospice in San Rafael from complications of pneumonia. He was survived by his three children.\n\nGloria Stuart was born on a dining room table on 4th Street in Santa Monica, California on July 4, 1910. Her early roles as a performing artist were in plays she produced in her home as a young girl. She was the star of her senior class play at Santa Monica High School in 1927. Attending the University of California, at Berkeley, she continued to perform on the stage. Stuart married and move to Carmel, where she performed in a production of \"The Seagull\" which was transferred to the Pasadena Playhouse in 1932. It was there that talent scouts for both Paramount and Universal saw her. In a famous dispute, the heads of the two studios flipped a coin and Universal won. She played lead roles for director James Whale, including (Das Haus des Grauens (1932), Der Unsichtbare (1933) and The Kiss Before the Mirror (1933)). The hard work at the studio estranged her from her first husband (Stuart helped create the Screen Actors Guild). She played the leading lady in Roman Scandals (1933), on the set of which she met her husband Arthur Sheekman. She was dissatisfied with the roles in which she was cast at Universal and played roles in films for other studios. Ultimately, a few years after having her daughter Sylvia (named after the role she was playing when she met Sheekman), she left the cinema and sought roles on the stage in New York. In the 1940s, she opened an art furniture shop where she created decoupage lamps, tables and trays, many of which sold to stars like Judy Garland and others. Later, Stuart took up oil painting and was very prolific, showing and selling her work in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere. Her landscapes of The Watts Towers are on permanent collection at The Los Angeles County Museum. She also took up and mastered the art of bonsai and some of her trees are on permanent collection in the Huntington Library Japanese Garden. When her husband fell ill in the 1970s (he died in 1978), she returned to acting doing a range of television series. In 1982, she returned to the screen appearing in a brief dance scene with Peter O'Toole in Ein Draufg√§nger in New York (1982).\n\nAbout this time a friend, she knew half a century earlier in Carmel, who was a master printer, re-entered her life and from him, Stuart learned the craft of fine printing. She established a printing press in her home studio called Imprenta Glorias. where she created a body of fine artist's books. Her greatest book, \"Flight of Butterfly Kites\" is in permanent collection at the J. Paul Getty Museum. Gloria Stuart won a Screen Actors Guild Award and an Oscar-nomination for her performance as the Old Rose in Titanic (1997). In July 2010, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences honored Gloria Stuart with a Centennial Celebration. She was the first such honoree to be living for a centennial. At 100 years of age, she had completed her greatest artist's book with her great-granddaughter working as her apprentice and also her final appearance on film in her grandson's documentary about her, entitled Secret Life of Old Rose: The Art of Gloria Stuart (2012) when she died at home at the age of 100 on September 26, 2010.\n\nBorn in 1919 in Jerusalem, Nehemiah Persoff emigrated with his family to America in 1929.\n\nFollowing schooling at the Hebrew Technical Institute of New York, he found a job as a subway electrician doing signal maintenance until an interest in the theater altered the direction of his life.\n\nHe joined amateur groups and subsequently won a scholarship to the Dramatic Workshop in New York. This led to what would have been his Broadway debut in a production of \"Eve of St. Mark\", but he was fired before the show opened. He made his official New York debut in a production of \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" in 1940.\n\nWWII interrupted his young career in 1942, when he was inducted into the United Sates Army, returning to the stage after his hitch was over in 1945, three years later. He sought work in stock plays and became an intern of Stella Adler and, as a result, a strong exponent of the Actor's Studio. Discovered by Charles Laughton and cast in his production of \"Galileo\" in 1947, Persoff made his film debut a year later with an uncredited bit in Stadt ohne Maske (1948).\n\nShort, dark, chunky-framed and with a distinct talent for dialects, Persoff became known primarily for his ethnic villainy, usually playing authoritative Eastern Europeans.\n\nIn a formidable career which had him portraying everything from cab drivers to Joseph Stalin, standout film roles would include Leo in Schmutziger Lorbeer (1956) with Humphrey Bogart, Gene Conforti in Alfred Hitchcock's Der falsche Mann (1956), Albert in Hei√üe K√ºste (1958) and gangster Johnny Torrio in Al Capone (1959). That same year he played another gangster, the small role of Little Bonaparte, in Manche m√∂gen's hei√ü (1959).\n\nHe was a durable performer during TV's \"Golden Age\" (Rauchende Colts (1955), Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959)) and well beyond (Chicago Hope: Endstation Hoffnung (1994), Law & Order (1990)), playing hundreds of intense, volatile and dominating characters.\n\nIn later years, his characters grew a bit softer as Barbra Streisand's Jewish father in Yentl (1983) and the voice of Papa Mousekewitz in the Feivel, der Mauswanderer (1986) will attest. Later stage work included well-received productions of \"I'm Not Rappaport\" and his biographical one-man show \"Sholem Aleichem\".\n\nAfter declining health and high blood pressure forced him to slow down, Persoff took up painting in 1985, studying sketching in Los Angeles. Specializing in watercolor, he created more than 100 works of art, many of which have been exhibited up and down the coast of California. He celebrated his 100th birthday in 2019.\n\nFay Eunice McKenzie was born February 19, 1918 into a show business family where she was the youngest of two sisters and an actress cousin, and made her screen debut at only ten weeks old in \"Station Content\" (1918) in which she was carried in the arms of Gloria Swanson. Her parents, Eva & Bob \"Pops\" McKenzie were already veteran performers and apparently wanted their daughter to get an early start in films. She nearly stole the show from Oliver Hardy as \"the baby\" in the Alice Howell short \"Distilled Love\" (filmed in 1918 but released two years later). By the time she was six, Fay was considered an old hand, having played diverse parts in her father's stock company. Among her early films was the 1924 Photoplay Medal Winner, \"The Dramatic Life of Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\nA native of Hollywood, she got most of her schooling on movie sets including the famous Little Red Schoolhouse at MGM. Her classmates included Betty Grable, Ann Rutherford and June Storey. As a teenager in the early 1930's Fay appeared in a number of low budget westerns with Wally Wales and Buddy Roosevelt as well as the all-star MGM musical \"Student Tour\" (1934). In 1937 she starred in the cult propaganda film about the dangers of marijuana entitled \"Assassin of Youth\". She also had a small part in the 1939 classic \"Gunga Din\". Her first Broadway venture was at age 17 and in 1940 she appeared as Miss Hollywood in \"Meet the People\", a popular review of that season starring Jack Gilford and Jack Albertson.\n\nBut she is probably best remembered for her work with Gene Autry at Republic Studios, where she was the feminine interest in \"Down Mexico Way\" (1941), \"Sierra Sue\" (1941), \"Home in Wyomin'\" (1942), \"Heart of the Rio Grande\" (1942) and \"Cowboy Serenade\" (1942). Finally getting the leading lady roles she deserved, the raven-haired beauty was an immediate hit with audiences. In 1942 Republic co-starred her with Don 'Red' Barry in the war-time flag waver, \"Remember Pearl Harbor!\" During WWII she toured with the Hollywood Victory Caravan and appeared in dozens of USO shows with various show biz legends including Frank Sinatra, Phil Silvers and Desi Arnaz. At the same time she could be heard on radio in \"Pabst's Blue Ribbon Town\" starring Groucho Marx. Featured film roles continued to come her way with Universal's \"The Singing Sheriff\" (1944), Warner Bros' \"Night and Day\" (1946) and \"Murder in the Music Hall\" (1946), the latter filmed at her home studio of Republic.\n\nIn 1946 she married the dark, husky actor Steve Cochran, but their union was short lived and they divorced two years later. She went back to Broadway to appear opposite comedian Bert Lahr (best known as The Cowardly Lion in \"The Wizard of Oz\") in the 1946 revival of \"Burlesque.\" During the 1950's she studied with Sanford Meisner and at The Actor's Studio with Lee Strasberg in NYC. She was seen to favorable advantage on a number of TV shows including \"The Millionaire\" (1959), \"Mr. Lucky\" (1960), \"Bonanza\" (1961), and \"Experiment in Terror\" (1962).\n\nShe also appeared in a number of films for close friend and director Blake Edwards, including \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" (1961) as the party guest laughing in the mirror, \"The Party\" (1968) and \"S.O.B.\" (1981). She was especially proud of \"The Party\" with Peter Sellers and agreed to play the cameo role of Alice Clutterbuck (the hostess of the party) because the script was co-written by her husband, Tom Waldman. She and Waldman married in 1949 and had two children Tom Jr. and Madora. Waldman Sr. passed away in 1985. Her older sister Ella \"Lolly\" McKenzie was also an actress and was married to well-known comedian Billy Gilbert. Her other sister Ida Mae McKenzie started in silent films as well and went on to work behind the scenes of popular game shows including the original \"Hollywood Squares\".\n\nMcKenzie traveled extensively as a Christian Science Practitioner, lecturing all over the country and in Europe. In 2012 she received the Career Achievement Award at the Cinecon Classic Film Festival and in 2017 she was on-hand to present some of her family's home movies at the TCM Film Festival (those films are now housed the Academy Film Archive in Hollywood). During the summer of 2018 she made a cameo appearance alongside her son Tom as Mrs. Van Proosdy in the film \"Kill A Better Mousetrap\". Her performance marks the first century-spanning career in motion picture history. She passed away peacefully in her sleep on the morning of April 16th at the age of 101. She is survived by her son, actor Tom Waldman, Jr., daughter Madora McKenzie Kibbe and her two grandchildren.\n\nSilent moppet star Jackie Coogan, immortalized as Charles Chaplin's Der Vagabund und das Kind (1921), had only one screen rival during the early 1920s, and that was none other than Baby Peggy. She was \"discovered\" while visiting the Century Studios lot on Sunset Boulevard with her mother when she was a mere 19 months old and went on to appear in nearly 150 shorts (between 1920 and 1923) and nine feature films during her silent heyday. Often considered a precursor to Shirley Temple, Baby Peggy's most popular film vehicle was the child classic Mein kleiner Kapit√§n (1924), which would be made a decade later as a vehicle for Temple.\n\nShe was born Peggy-Jean Montgomery in 1918 in San Diego, California, of acting stock. She was the daughter of Marian (Baxter), from Wisconsin, and Jack Montgomery, a Nebraska-born cowboy for years all over the western states. He ended up in the movies as a stuntman and extra, driving stagecoaches and buckboards. He supported himself as Tom Mix's double, but never achieved the rugged stardom he yearned for. In fact, his daughter was the one who became the celebrity and chief breadwinner for the family.\n\nMany of Baby Peggy's popular comedies were parodies of movies that grown-up stars had made, and she delightfully imitated such legends as Rudolph Valentino, Pola Negri, Mary Pickford and Mae Murray. Her first feature-length film was Der Klub der Unterirdischen (1922); her first film with Universal, The Darling of New York (1923), shot when she was 3-1/2 years old, was a solid hit. A few more, including Helen's Babies (1924), were also certifiable winners. However, by the age of 8, she was finished.\n\nHer fortune reportedly was depleted by her father Jack's stepfather, a banker to whom she had entrusted all her money. Within a short time, she was forced to turn to the vaudeville circuit for survival. A comeback in early talkies with the new moniker Peggy Montgomery was very short-lived. Her credits, as a result, are often mixed up with another actress named Peggy Montgomery, who was a western ing√©nue for many years.\n\nThe former child star lived in dire straits and suffered from nervous breakdowns and near poverty for many years until she found a new and unexpectedly successful career as a book publisher and writer, using the pseudonym \"Diana Serra Cary\". As the author of \"Hollywood Posse\" (1975) and (later) \"Hollywood's Children\", she wrote about her youthful career, post-stardom years, child stars in general, and Hollywood history in all its fascinating glory. Her own autobiography, \"Whatever Happened to Baby Peggy?\", was released in 1996.\n\nIn 2016, Diana was inducted into the Classic Film Hall of Fame at the Rheem Theater in Moraga, CA. Diana was present, at age 98, to receive the honor and answer questions. She is considered to have been the last living star of the silent film era. Per Robert Garfinkle, a board member of the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum in Fremont, CA, Diana now has the longest acting career of all time, from 1920 to 2015. Her last film was a silent film she made at the above-referenced museum. The film was actually made using one of their antique hand-cranked cameras!\n\nBaby Peggy died on February 24, 2020 in Gustine, California. She was 101.\n\nFrom the day she was born Martha lived in a world of music. For sure her father was a banker but he was also an amateur pianist. As for her mother, she was a housewife but also a very talented opera singer who had given up her career for the joys of matrimony and motherhood. It does not come as a surprise, under such circumstances, that the little girl's singing capacities were soon discovered. At eight she was already on a scene singing an aria from \"The Barber of Seville\". A critic attended the show and was impressed by her performance. He introduced her to the director of the Magyar Theater, where she landed her first contract. As of the age of 10 she was hailed as Hungary's \"national idol\". And it was not long before her triumph became international. An operetta, \"Pogasza\", was written specially for the crystal-clear-voiced little singer. Among others, she played the role of the doll in \"Tales of Hoffmann\" and starred in \"Das Veilchen vom Montmartre\" by Kalman. With the advent of sound films, she found herself very much in demand in the 1930s, bringing her beautiful voice and looks to yet more delighted viewers. It is on the set of \"Mein Herz ruft nach dir\" that she met Jan Kiepura, another successful opera and operetta singer. Although it was not love at first sight, Jan and Martha gradually fell in love, married two years later, had two sons and were separated only by death with the demise of Jan in 1966. In 1938, the couple fled Austria after its annexation by Hitler and settled down in the South of France first then in the USA. Martha made fewer movies but kept on singing. For instance she co-starred in \"The merry Widow\" in Broadway for three years with Jan Kiepura. She became an American citizen in the fifties and currently lives in Rye, new York.\n\nMean, miserly and miserable-looking, they didn't come packaged with a more annoying and irksome bow than Charles Lane. Glimpsing even a bent smile from this unending sourpuss was extremely rare, unless one perhaps caught him in a moment of insidious glee after carrying out one of his many nefarious schemes. Certainly not a man's man on film or TV by any stretch, Lane was a character's character. An omnipresent face in hundreds of movies and TV sitcoms, the scrawny, scowling, beady-eyed, beak-nosed killjoy who usually could be found peering disdainfully over a pair of specs, brought out many a comic moment simply by dampening the spirit of his nemesis. Whether a Grinch-like rent collector, IRS agent, judge, doctor, salesman, reporter, inspector or neighbor from hell, Lane made a comfortable acting niche for himself making life wretched for someone somewhere.\n\nHe was born Charles Gerstle Levison on January 26, 1905 in San Francisco and was actually one of the last survivors of that city's famous 1906 earthquake. He started out his working-class existence selling insurance but that soon changed. After dabbling here and there in various theatre shows, he was prodded by a friend, director Irving Pichel, to consider acting as a profession. In 1928 he joined the Pasadena Playhouse company, which, at the time, had built up a solid reputation for training stage actors for the cinema. While there he performed in scores of classical and contemporary plays. He made his film debut anonymously as a hotel clerk in Leichtes Geld (1931) starring Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney and was one of the first to join the Screen Actor's Guild. He typically performed many of his early atmospheric roles without screen credit and at a cost of $35 per day, but he always managed to seize the moment with whatever brief bit he happened to be in. People always remembered that face and raspy drone of a voice. He appeared in so many pictures (in 1933 alone he made 23 films!), that he would occasionally go out and treat himself to a movie only to find himself on screen, forgetting completely that he had done a role in the film. By 1947 the popular character actor was making $750 a week.\n\nAmong his scores of cookie-cutter crank roles, Lane was in top form as the stage manager in Napoleon vom Broadway (1934); the Internal Revenue Service agent in Lebensk√ºnstler (1938); the newsman in Mr. Smith geht nach Washington (1939); the rent collector in Ist das Leben nicht sch√∂n? (1946); the recurring role of Doc Jed Prouty, in the \"Ellery Queen\" film series of the 1940s, and as the draft board driver in Blindg√§nger der Kompanie (1958). A minor mainstay for Frank Capra, the famed director utilized the actor's services for nine of his finest films, including a few of the aforementioned plus Mr. Deeds geht in die Stadt (1936), Arsen und Spitzenh√§ubchen (1944) and Der beste Mann (1948).\n\nLane's career was interrupted for a time serving in the Coast Guard during WWII. In post-war years, he found TV quite welcoming, settling there as well for well over four decades. Practically every week during the 1950s and 1960s, one could find him displaying somewhere his patented \"slow burn\" on a popular sitcom - Topper (1953), The Real McCoys (1957), The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959), Mister Ed (1961), Verliebt in eine Hexe (1964), Mini-Max oder die unglaublichen Abenteuer des Maxwell Smart (1965), Gomer Pyle: USMC (1964), Die Munsters (1964), Green Acres (1965), The Flying Nun (1967) and Maude (1972). He hassled the best sitcom stars of the day, notably Lucille Ball (an old friend from the RKO days with whom he worked multiple times), Andy Griffith and Danny Thomas. Recurring roles on Dennis, Geschichten eines Lausbuben (1959), The Beverly Hillbillies (1962) and Die Ausgeflippten (1977) made him just as familiar to young and old alike. Tops on the list had to be his crusty railroad exec Homer Bedloe who periodically caused bucolic bedlam with his nefarious schemes to shut down the Hooterville Cannonball on Petticoat Junction (1963). He could also play it straightforward and serious as demonstrated by his work in Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959), Perry Mason (1957), Unsere kleine Farm (1974) and L.A. Law: Staranw√§lte, Tricks, Prozesse (1986).\n\nA benevolent gent in real life, Lane was seen less and less as time went by. One memorable role in his twilight years was as the rueful child pediatrician who chose to overlook the warning signs of child abuse in the excellent TV movie Sybil (1976). One of Lane's last on-screen roles was in the TV-movie remake of Dexter Riley - Total verkabelt und nichts begriffen (1995) at age 90. Just before his death he was working on a documentary on his long career entitled \"You Know the Face\".\n\nCinematically speaking, perhaps the good ones do die young, for the irascible Lane lived to be 102 years old. He died peacefully at his Brentwood, California home, outliving his wife of 71 years, former actress Ruth Covell, who died in 2002. A daughter, a son and a granddaughter all survived him.\n\nEarl Cameron did not set out to be an actor. Bermudian by birth, Cameron joined the British Merchant Navy in the 1930s for the travel opportunities that it afforded. By the early 1940s, with World War II in full swing, Cameron found himself in London working menial jobs to survive. After seeing a West End revival of the musical comedy Chu Chin Chow, he got the acting bug. When an actor didn't show up for a performance, Cameron replaced the actor in the production. This was followed by a series of roles on the London stage.\n\nIn 1951, he received a big break when he was cast in Unterwelt (1951). The film directed by Basil Dearden in which Cameron played a dockworker who falls in love with a local woman, was significant in that it was one of the first British films to feature a Black man in a non-stereotypical role. He was essentially the UK counterpart to Sidney Poitier, who made his film debut around the same time, although equally talented, he never became a star. Toward the end of the decade, he would work with Dearden again in Das M√§dchen Saphir (1959), where he would play a physician who is the brother of the title character, who was murdered while passing for White.\n\nOther significant film film roles in Cameron's career include Feuerball (1965) where he played opposite Sean Connery as Pinder, Bond's Bahamian assistant. Cameron played an ambassador in A Warm December (1973), a film starring and directed by Poitier. In Die Dolmetscherin (2005), a film directed by Sydney Pollack , in which he played Edmond Zuwanie, a dictator loosely based on Robert Mugabe.\n\nCameron continued to work steadily in film and television into his nineties. One of his last appearances was in Black Hollywood: 'They've Gotta Have Us' (2018), a documentary on Black actors in Hollywood produced by BBC Two.\n\nHe died in 2020 at the age of 102."
