        "text": "Country: United States\n\nLanguage: English\n\nThanks to the generous support of Donna and Larry James, Ingram White Castle Foundation, and Columbus City Council, Pioneers of African American Cinema returns for programming throughout 2024. On Sunday, September 8th, join us at the Film Center for the screening of Richard C. Kahn’s The Bronze Buckaroo (1939).\n\nAdditional financial support provided by the Greater Columbus Arts Council, Tom and Mary Katzenmeyer, Amundsen Davis and the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority. Learn more about the program here.\n\nNext in the series:\n\nThursday, November 7, 2024, 7:00pm — Dirs. James and Eloyce Gist’s Hell-Bound Train (1930)\n\nAbout the film:\n\nBob Blake and his sidekick and four singing cowboys arrive at the Jackson ranch where Bob learns from Betty Jackson that her brother, Joe, is missing. Bob investigates and learns that there is gold on the Jackson ranch, and the neighboring rancher has kidnapped Joe in order to get his land.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, singing cowboy films took over screens, however, they largely did not include black casts or crews. Herb Jeffries, who plays Bob Blake, was cast to be the pioneer in breaking down racial hurdles in Hollywood and later would work continually with all-black casts. His role as Bob Blake would then transcend to other films including Two-Gun Man from Harlem (1938), and Harlem Rides the Range (1939).\n\nAbout the filmmaker:\n\nRichard C. Kahn was an American filmmaker, screenwriter and producer in the early 1930’s through the 50’s. His other prominent works include The Secret Menace (1931) and The Third Sex (1934).\n\nSee our upcoming films\n\nMAJOR PROGRAM SUPPORT\n\nDonna and Larry James\n\nIngram White Castle Foundation\n\nColumbus City Council\n\nWITH ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FROM\n\nGreater Columbus Arts Council\n\nTom and Mary Katzenmeyer\n\nAmundsen Davis\n\nColumbus Metropolitan Housing Authority\n\nGATEWAY FILM FOUNDATION RECEIVES YEAR-ROUND SUPPORT FROM\n\nOhio Arts Council\n\nGreater Columbus Arts Council\n\nThe Columbus Foundation\n\nCampus Partners\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts"
