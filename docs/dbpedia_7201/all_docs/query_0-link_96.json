        "text": "Summertime in Los Angeles means beach days, ditching work early on Fridays (if you're lucky), wildfires â€” and Cinespia, which hosts outdoor movie screenings among the graves and crypts of the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\nEverything you ever wanted to know about air quality and fires but were afraid to ask.\n\nRandall Lobb, who by day is a high school English teacher, is the filmmaker behind \"Turtle Power: The Definitive History of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\"\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced the launch of data.lacity.org, an open resource offering access to data collected by the City of L.A. at a conference hosted at City Hall called #techLA.\n\nThanks to NASA's new Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, or IRIS, we can now see the violent explosions that occur on the sun.\n\nHerb Jeffries, an actor and singer most famous for his work with the Duke Ellington Orchestra and his role as a singing cowboy in \"The Bronze Buckaroo,\" has died. He was 100.\n\nBummed that you won't be able to watch the Dodgers on TV (even though you live within miles of the stadium)? Luckily the LA-area is full of sports bars and other establishments that will be airing the games.\n\nTo help you prepare your ballots and refresh your memory of this year's great films, we've compiled all the interviews we've done with this year's Oscar contenders.\n\nDon't be that guy or gal who brings a boring old bag of chips. Why not take a little time and show up with something unexpected and delicious?"
