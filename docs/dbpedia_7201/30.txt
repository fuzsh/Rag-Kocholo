The Dallas-based Sack Amusement Company was for many years was the principal supplier of motion pictures with all-black casts. Their films exclusively played the circuit of theaters catering to African-American audiences. Sack movies were generally turned out by the same technical crews employed by such small independent studios as Monogram and PRC. Midnight Shadow and The Bronze Buckaroo conform to the narrative conventions of Hollywood B pictures. Both are fascinating curiosities that reveal a side of commercial American filmmaking long overlooked by even the most rabid fans of vintage movies.
