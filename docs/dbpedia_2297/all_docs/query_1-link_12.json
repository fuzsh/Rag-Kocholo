There's also copies of correspondence where Monsieur Ribemont's friend Bernard Gendrillon (1929–2020), the former mayor of La Châtaigneraie in the Vendée and president of the town's local historical circle, during the latter's visit to Sydney in 1986 attempted to trace the purchaser of the painting. In June 2020, Duyker learned that Le Blant's painting now hangs in the library of Brigham Young University in Utah. He informed Bernard Gendrillon shortly before his death.

The building was very probably designed by Mrs Bayer who had studied architecture at Sydney Technical College between 1929 and 1931 and had worked as a draughtsperson. When she married at St Ann's Catholic Church, North Bondi, on 3 May 1934, she described her occupation as 'architectural profession', however, she was not registered with the Board of Architects.

R. H. Spencer], who photographed the originals on 28 October 1977 (see the photocopy of the list), he made prints in an improvised dark room. Later, he scanned the same negatives digitally. The folder contains prints from film and digital scans, many quite faint. It also contains French transcriptions of ten of the documents in the hand of Edward Duyker's mother Marie-Thérèse Maryse Duyker (born 1932)\n\nManila folder labelled 'Malcor Transcripts' (File 46) - Box 3 (MS Acc22.020)\n\nA precious collection of documents relating to Dumont d'Urville, was donated to the French naval archives in January 1884 by Luc Frédéric Antoine Malcor (1827–1917) 'Agent principal de Commissaire de la Marine, Toulon', see his Légion d'Honneur file at the Archives nationales, Paris, LH/1703/50. These documents are preserved in the Service historique de la Défense, Château de Vincennes. Malcor had acquired these documents from a nephew of Captain Louis-Clement Salvy (1783–1863). At the time, Malcor described the elder Salvy as the 'proper nephew of M[ada]me Dumont d'Urville' (See Malcor's 'avertissement' setting out the provenance of the documents in Papiers du Contre-Amiral Jules-Sébastien-César Dumont d'Urville, Fonds Privés, 7 GG2 carton 1 [previously GG2 30]). In fact, Louis-Clement Salvy was the explorer's stepfather-in-law: the man his wife's divorced mother, Josephine Hélène Las de Guérin (1780–1861), married in Toulon on 24 November 1817. Madame Salvy inherited part of d'Urville's papers on her daughter's death in 1842 and, in turn, her second husband inherited them from her when she died in 1861. His beneficiary would keep them for another two decades before entrusting them to Malcor for donation. The balance of the papers from the Salvy estate, which did not go to the Château de Vincennes (including d'Urville's private journals from the 1830–7), were acquired by the Bibliothèque municipale de Toulon (Ms 65, Ms 131–3). Fortuitously, Malcor, gave transcriptions of several shorter documents (together with some personal observations on d'Urville, his family and his writings), to the naval archives in Vincennes. This was fortuitous, because some of the originals in Toulon disappeared during the Second World War. Edward Duyker photographed Malcor's transcriptions in 2007.\n\nManila folder labelled 'Dumont d'Urville Family' (File 47) - Box 3 (MS Acc22.020)\n\nContains photocopies of notes from Matterer, A.

It has long been associated with stories of convict graves. In Dumont d'Urville's personal Coquille journal, Edward Duyker found a record of the grave of a young convict Edgar Church buried there in 1822. He followed up with research Church's conviction and death. The folder contains the typescript (with footnotes) of an article Edward Duyker co-authored with former Blue Mountains Local Studies Librarian, John Low, on Pulpit Hill. This was first published in the journal Doryanthes, in August 2009. The folder also contains a copy of the same article published (without footnotes) in The University of Sydney News, October 2009. Finally, the folder contains a print-out of the Proceedings of the Old Bailey with details of Edgar Church's conviction for grand larceny (the theft of a trunk valued at 16s) on 4 December 1816.

This was during his first visit to New Zealand. In 2007, Edward Duyker located d'Urville's Coquille journal in the possession of the Mairie de Condé-sur-Noireau (Ms 11). It had not previously been cited by any other scholar. Louis-Charles-Henry Dumont de La Londe, who inherited d'Urville's personal effects and manuscripts donated it and other documents to the municipality of Condé-sur-Noireau in 1904. The entire Coquille journal (not included in this folder) spans the period 24 October 1823 to 5 June 1824. D'Urville reworked parts as footnotes for his manuscript novel Les Zélandais ou histoire australienne. He also published sections as notes in the account of his later Astrolabe voyage. Other parts (missing in manuscript) survive as extracts in his Voyage pittoresque autour du monde. It is a very personal and highly significant, although incomplete..

He arrived on 26 April 1837 and would remain for ten days buying books and maps, but also seeking out British mariners familiar with Antarctic waters. One fruitful meeting took place on the evening of 1 May, when he dined with the Raleigh Club (probably at the Thatched House Restaurant, in St James Street). This club, founded in 1826 by Sir Arthur Capell Brooke (1791–1858), was the parent organisation of the Geographical Society of London (later the Royal Geographical Society), established in 1830.\n\nThe folder contains an email from Pauline McGregor Currien [Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England] to her cousin Edward Duyker dated 21 February 2008, alerting him to a reference to Dumont d'Urville as a guest of the Raleigh Club on 1 May 1837, in the book History of the Geographical Club by James Marshall-Cornwall (page 14). The folder also contains historical notes on St James Street and Luc Frédéric Antoine Malcor's transcription of d'Urville's poem 'Au peuple anglais', photocopied by Duyker in 2016.\n\nManila folder labelled 'Arago Dispute 1837' (File 72) - Box 4 (MS Acc22.020)\n\nDespite strong royal support for Dumont d'Urville's final expedition (which would include two Antarctic descents), not all his contemporaries viewed it favourably. The physicist, astronomer and mathematician François Arago, who had entered politics after the Revolution of 1830 and represented the Pyrénées-Orientales in the Chamber of Deputies, had a reputation for carefully scrutinising government expenditure. At the chamber's sitting of 5 June 1837, Arago turned his attention to the navy and d'Urville's forthcoming expedition. His criticisms precipitated a bitter public dispute. On 14 June, an outraged d'Urville penned a response to Arago's criticisms that was published a week later in Le Toulonnais and appeared in the Journal des Débats, La Presse, Le Garde National de Marseille, La Gazette du Midi and the Annales maritimes et coloniales. Arago's long polemical response was published in Le National on 12 July 1837 and in the Journal des Débats. Still determined to have the last word, d'Urville penned yet another response to Arago on 17 July. The folder contains copies of these published exchanges\n\nManila folder labelled 'Dumont d'Urville Instructions' (File 73) - Box 4 (MS Acc22.020)\n\nContains copies of ten documents which form Ms 133, 'Manuscrits de l'amiral Dumont d'Urville', held in the Bibliothèque municipale de Toulon.

This was while d'Urville prepared the official account of his final voyage for publication. Although the building no longer stands and the street has been renumbered (see Saunier, C., 'Le numérotage de la rue Madame', Bulletin de la Société historique du VI° arrondissement de Paris, tome xxix, 1928, pp. 75–86), we know from a notarial inventory and a cadastral plan that it was on the corner of rue Madame and rue de Fleurus. The folder contains photocopies of notes in Edward Duyker's hand 6/3/2007, during research at the Bibliothèque Historique de la Ville de Paris, regarding the rue Madame, Paris, where Dumont d'Urville and his wife and surviving son were residing at the time of their deaths. On page 482 of his biography, Duyker included a photograph of the building which appears in an album of photographs taken by Henri Blanchard in 1887 (Paris Album Blancard, 1887–1889 (Rue Madame), Bibliothèque historique de la Ville de Paris, 4° 21, 15 H). The d'Urvilles' landlord was an engraver named Joseph Molé (died 1853) (see Duyker, Dumont d'Urville, p. 483). Joseph Molé also owned the adjoining property at no. 24 (now 58 rue Madame and the location of the Église Réformée de Pentemont-Luxembourg). He lived in the same building with his adopted son Paul-Henri-Joseph Molé-Gentilhomme (1814–1856), the author of many melodramatic novels and plays. The folder contains copies of catalogue entries from the Bibliothèque nationale de France for some of Molé-Gentilhomme's melodramatic works.
