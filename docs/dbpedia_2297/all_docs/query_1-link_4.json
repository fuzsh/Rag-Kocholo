        "text": "Career\n\nHe helped start the Roman Catholic mission in the Eastern Oceania and was the Prefect Apostolic of Southern Oceania. He was a cousin of Cyprien Liausu, who also became a Picpus missionary in the Gambier Islands. Liausu was part of a small group of French Picpus missionaries sent by Pope Gregory XVI and the Propaganda Fide to convert the natives of Eastern Oceania.\n\nTheir superior Étienne Jérôme Rouchouze was appointed the Vicar Apostolic of Eastern Oceania while Liausu was appointed prefect apostolic of the region south of the equator including the Gambier Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the Tuamotu Islands and the Society Islands and Alexis Bachelot was charged with the region north of the equator (ie the Hawaiian Islands).\n\nIn 1834, Liausu and François Caret, Honoré Laval and Columba Murphy arrived in Valparaíso from Bordeaux. Caret and Laval with Murphy as their assistant were sent to the Gambier Islands while Liausu stayed behind to maintain connection between the missionaries and the Congregation back home and to wait for the arrival of Bishop Rouchouze, who was arriving at a later time.\n\nMaputeoa and his family were baptized on 25 August 1836. In 1839, he contracted typhus through his work with the Chilean soldiers.\n\nLiausu died 5 September 1839 in Valparaíso having never made it to the Gambier Islands."
