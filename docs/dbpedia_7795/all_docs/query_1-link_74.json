        "text": "BERTRAND RUSSELLA Life.By Caroline Moorehead.Illustrated. 596 pp. New York: Viking. $30.\n\n\"HE was a great and good man,\" the philosopher A. J. Ayer wrote of Bertrand Russell; but he would, wouldn't he, being one of Russell's disciples in the last years. Great, maybe; good, I'm not so sure.\n\nThe standard biography is \"The Life of Bertrand Russell\" (1975), by Ronald W. Clark, supplemented and qualified by Katharine Tait's \"My Father Bertrand Russell\" (1976). For her \"Bertrand Russell\" Caroline Moorehead has had the advantage of new material: further letters, diaries of wives and lovers, and the business correspondence of Russell's principal publisher, Sir Stanley Unwin. Some of this material became available only two years ago. The archives of published and unpublished writings are now vast. Ms. Moorehead has never had to work as hard on a biography: her previous books in that genre deal with Freya Stark and the Hollywood impresario Sidney Bernstein, simple lives by comparison with Russell's.\n\nMs. Moorehead has eased the burden a good deal by concentrating on Russell's domestic and public life. \"This book is about Russell's character and ideas,\" she writes, \"about his friends and the women he loved, about the causes he fought for and the sense of wonder and eloquence he brought to everything he touched.\"\n\nShe mentions Russell's academic books when they arise as biographical events, but she avoids getting into the thickets of the \"Principia Mathematica\" that Russell wrote in collaboration with Alfred North Whitehead and published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913, and the early essays in mathematics and logic, on which Russell's reputation as a brilliant mind was based. \"I should like the run of his headpiece,\" Virginia Woolf said to her diary, admiring little else of him. Ms. Moorehead has chosen to deal with Russell mainly as a voluble presence in the world, with his public actions, his personal and sexual life.\n\nShe has Russell's authority for making this choice. In July 1943 he wrote \"Reply to Criticisms\" and effectively separated ethics from philosophy: \"The only matter concerned with ethics that I can regard as properly belonging to philosophy is the argument that ethical propositions should be expressed in the optative mood, not in the indicative. Where ethics is concerned, I hold that, so far as fundamentals are concerned, it is impossible to produce conclusive intellectual arguments. When two people differ about (say) the nature of matter, it should be possible to prove either that one is right and the other wrong, or that both are wrong, or that there are insufficient grounds to warrant any opinion. In a fundamental question of ethics I do not think a theoretical argument is possible. I do not therefore offer the same kind of defense for what I have said about values as I do for what I have said on logical or scientific questions.\"\n\nWhat Russell says of ethics applies also to religion and politics; none of these has a theory as its ground, each is the articulation of a vision, a faith, a desire or a prejudice. Reasons for them come afterward, and are sought to give them an appearance of cause. A philosopher may speak on all these matters, but in different tones of voice. To clarify the point: in the same essay, Russell distinguished between Leibniz and Spinoza: Leibniz's intellect \"was highly abstract and logical; his greatest claim to fame is as an inventor of the infinitesimal calculus.\" One may read Spinoza \"in order to learn how to live, but not Leibniz.\" Russell started out as a philosopher in Leibniz's mode, but he soon decided to tell people how to live. His model in this decision was Locke, whom he declared \"at least as important as the founder of philosophical liberalism as he is as the founder of the empirical theory of knowledge.\" There was also the example of Russell's godfather, John Stuart Mill -- philosopher, public man, forceful in the ways of social and political life. Ms. Moorehead has little to say about Russell the analytic philosopher, adept of symbolic logic, but much about Russell telling people how to live, what to do.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
