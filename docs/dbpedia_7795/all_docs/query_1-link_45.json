        "text": "This paper examines the nature of analytical philosophy, its need and the importance in the contemporary world. In this write up I will investigate the role of logic, mind and language in the field of analytical philosophy. It further determines the development of clarification of complex statements into simple statements. What makes analytical philosophy unique and what are the major significance that differentiates analytical philosophy from philosophy of mind, philosophy of logic and philosophy of language. Analytical philosophy is the process of analysis in which we proceed from complexity to simplicity and clarity. In analytical philosophy, philosophers are using analytical method to uncover those truths of the world and realitywhich are covered with linguistic ambiguity. Language plays an important role in analytical philosophy because the clarification and simplification is the business of analytical philosophy. World is made up of facts and facts are expressed and analyzed in language. Language is the representation of the world. I will also show the major contribution of analytical philosophers in explaining atomic world.\n\nI argue that the dominant concept of analytic philosophy among self-described analytic philosophers is an identity concept. It involves a substantive and always contestable vision of the nature of analytic philosophy that is at the same time a vision of one’s own intellectual identity. In this non-pejorative sense, the concept is intrinsically ideological. I further argue that the anthology by Conant and Elliott (The Analytic Tradition, Norton 2017), while extraordinarily broad and comprehensive, retains this ideological character. I draw attention to four features of their substantive vision.\n\nOver a period of some years, chiefly before 2000, I wrote this for my students. Quite a few other people have found it useful. I should like to call attention to the thesis that analytic philosophy has two wings: one descended from Russell, the other from Moore. Standard accounts of analytic philosophy (for instance the history by Soames) are, at the least, heavily biased toward the Russellian (today the dominant) variant. As will become evident, the original plan was much more extensive than this, with essays on major figures and movements. That plan fell victim to other projects. Only an essay on Moore and a partial one on Russell were ever completed – they are included here as sequels to this introduction.\n\nThis paper shows that during the first half of the 1960s The Journal of Philosophy quickly moved from publishing work in diverse philosophical traditions to, essentially, only publishing analytic philosophy. Further, the changes at the journal are shown, with the help of previous work on the journals Mind and The Philosophical Review, to be part of a pattern involving generalist philosophy journals in Britain and America during the period 1925-1969. The pattern is one in which journals controlled by analytic philosophers systematically promote a form of critical philosophy and marginalise rival approaches to philosophy. This pattern, it is argued, helps to explain the growing dominance of analytic philosophy during the twentieth century and allows characterising this form of philosophy as, at least during 1925-1969, a sectarian form of critical philosophy."
