MDore un Russell's philosophy, an examination of J:{usseU's pUblished references to Moore yields inforrrlation that is not without value. What follows is a (non-exhaustive) bibliography of sue h reference S I and BOrTle conclusions drawn thel'efroITl. The reforences in RUGGcll's articles are frurn an,index i.ll the Archives, which, however, covers only Jublished articles and lists only the first reference to anyone pllblicati;n. The referenc~s to Moore in Russell's published philosophical books are t\"ken from their prefac e s. intrnchlctions a:ld indexes. - - 1897 1900 1901 1901 1903 1904 19le 1912 1912 1914 1918 1919 1921 1922 Essay on the 'Founc'ations of C;eometry. This book has no inde,~, and there are no references to lVLoore in the preface. The Philosophy of Leibniz. There are no references to tvloore in the index. On p.xv of the preface, Russell gives Moore credit for reading the proofs, revising the Latin translation, and \"many valuable suggesticms\". On p.40 of \"On the Notion of Order\", Russe~l refers to :Moore's \"The Nature of JudgITlent\" (1899). On p. 316 [)f \"Is Position in Space and TLne Absolute or t{elative', Russell refers to Moore's \"Necessity\" (l900i. The Principle s of MatheITlatic s. Seven :\\100 re ~ efer enc e s in the index. They include this stacer\"lent in the preface: \"On fUl'da.rncntal questions of Philosophy, my position, in all its chie: features, is derived from Mr. G.E. JVoore\" (p.xyiii in 2nd en., p. vii i in 1st ed. ). On p. 21S of 1 Meinung's Theory of COnlplexe:;; ;n1Cl AS~U,,)1-:>tionglI7 Russell refers to Moore's \"Experience a.nd Erupir:cisrn\" (1903).

The Problems of Pililosophy. No references in index. On p. 6 of the preface, Russell says he has derived \"assistance\" fr0l1l unpublished writings of Moore on the relalion of sense-data to physical objects. Our Kncn,vledge of the External 1,;Vorld. No references in index or preface. On p. 492 of his review of Broad's Perception, Physic sand Realitv, Rus sell refer s to Moor e' s \"The Refutatio':' -;f ke alism\" (1903) . 111.troductioE to MaLhuIIlatici::l.l Philu80phy. No references in index or preface. The Analy sis. of Mind. Ditto. Russell's article \"Analytic and Synthetic Philosopr_ers\" is a one-page review of two books, one of which is 1\\100re's Philosop:J.ical Studies (19ZZ). What conclu~iuns of inten: sl io students of Rus sell's thought can be drawn from this list? Considering only this informatiun, there aroe four inferoenc-oeg that seem well-founded~ 1. Moore was not a significant influence on Russell until after Russell's first philosophical book was published. (The earliest reference on this list occurs in 1900. This i; further supported by the references to },{oore in Russell's unpublished notebook, ''What Shall I Read?\". The first entry is -lat\"cl Nov.1898, and it and an entry for Feb. 1899 are to unpublished writings of Moore - of which some appear to be in the A\",chive s. ) 2. Moore was tremendously influential on Russell around the turn of the century. (See the entriEs for 1900,1901, 1903, 1904, and the first item. for 1959.) 3. Moore was not a sigrlificant factor in Russell's philosophical developoent after 1912.. (Excludirlg the fir st item for 1959 wbich is historical - there are no significant references to Moore in books after 1912, and relatively few ingig:1ificant ones. The rrtere brevity of the 1922 and 1944 a~ticles is significant.) 4. Nothing published by 1I.100re after 1903 was of significant influence on Russell. (The unpublished writings of Moore referred to in The Pr_Qblems of Philosophy may be the lectures that were later published as Some Main Pro1Jlems of Philosophy. If so, this would be the only serious exce~tion.) Department of Philosophy McMaster Uni.ve..."
