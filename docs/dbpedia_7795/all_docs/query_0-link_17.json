        "text": "Sir—The death of G. E. Moore is a grief to all the many who felt for him a very high degree of affectionate admiration. I should like to add to the reminiscences of others a few words about his early years at Cambridge, which few now living remember. During my first two years as an undergraduate, I met no one who had the kind of intellectual eminence that I had hoped to find. In my third year, however, I met G. E. Moore, who was then a freshman, and for some years he fulfilled my ideal of genius. He was in those days beautiful and slim, with a look almost of inspiration, and with an intellect as deeply passionate as Spinoza’s. When I first knew him, he was a disciple of Lucretius, and he accepted that poet’s passion with equal intensity. At that time he knew no modern philosophy and, when he did come to know it, he naturally found Lucretius too simple to be acceptable. Moore, like me, was influenced by McTaggart, and was for a short time a Hegelian. But he emerged more quickly than I did, and it was largely his conversation that led me to abandon both Kant and Hegel. In spite of his being two years younger than me, he greatly influenced my philosophical outlook. One of the pet amusements of all Moore’s friends was to watch him trying to light a pipe. He would light a match, and then begin to argue, and continue until the match burnt his fingers. Then he would light another, and so on, until the box was finished. Moore had that kind of simplicity which characterizes some very great minds. I admired it to the full in him and, in later years, I found it again in Einstein. It sprang, in both, from a completely unfettered pursuit of truth. It was towards the end of 1898 that Moore and I rebelled against both Kant and Hegel. Moore led the way, but I followed closely in his footsteps. I think that the first published account of the new philosophy was Moore’s article in Mind on “The Nature of Judgment”. Although neither he nor I would now adhere to all the doctrines in this article, I, and I think he, would still agree with its negative part—i.e. with the doctrine that fact is in general independent of experience. And I still think that this article gave conclusive proof of philosophical genius. Moore was as much loved as he was admired. His smile was beautiful, and his single-mindedness was as rare as it was admirable."
