        "text": "The Problems of Philosophy\n\nby Bertrand Russell (1912)\n\nIn the following pages I have confined myself in the main to those problems of philosophy in regard to which I thought it possible to say something positive and constructive, since merely negative criticism seemed out of place. For this reason, theory of knowledge occupies a larger space than metaphysics in the present volume, and some topics much discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all.\n\nI have derived valuable assistance from unpublished writings of G. E. Moore and J. M. Keynes: from the former, as regards the relations of sense-data to physical objects, and from the latter as regards probability and induction. I have also profited greatly by the criticisms and suggestions of Professor Gilbert Murray.\n\nAppearance and Reality\n\nThe Existence of Matter\n\nThe Nature of Matter\n\nIdealism\n\nKnowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description\n\nOn Induction\n\nOn Our Knowledge of General Principles\n\nHow A Priori Knowledge Is Possible\n\nThe World of Universals\n\nOn Our Knowledge of Universals\n\nOn Intuitive Knowledge\n\nTruth and Falsehood\n\nKnowledge, Error, and Probable Opinion\n\nThe Limits of Philosophical Knowledge\n\nThe Value of Philosophy"
