        "text": "James Levine has recently argued (1998, 2009, 2016) that there is a tension between Russell’s Moorean semantical framework and Russell’s Peano-inspired analytical practice. According to Levine, this discrepancy runs deep in Russell’s thought from 1900 to 1918, and underlies many of the doctrinal changes occurring during this period. In this paper, I suggest that, contrary to what Levine claims, there is no incompatibility between Moore’s theory of meaning and the idea of informative conceptual analysis. I show this by relating Moore’s view of meaning to his Sidgwick-inspired criticism of the so-called naturalistic fallacy. I maintain that Moore’s semantical framework has a methodological intent: following Sidgwick, Moore wants to block any attempt to justify ethical principles through setting ad hoc conditions on the meaning of the terms involved. Thus, far from grounding philosophical knowledge on subjective intuitions, as Levine suggests, Moore’s frameworkwould provide us with the means to make room for a discursive and dialectic conception of philosophical inquiry.\n\nBertrand Russell’s Principles of Mathematics offered a sustained criticism of Hermann Cohen’s foundations of neo-Kantianism, evoking a radical rethinking of the basis of Marburg thought by Cohen’s student, Ernst Cassirer. Russell’s criticisms were directed at the understanding of the concepts of the differential calculus, which grounded the objectivity of scientific thought in Cohen’s effort to resurrect the Kantian transcendental project. On the basis of Russell’s criticisms, Cassirer abandoned Cohen’s foundations and instead drew on the general relational form, borrowed from Russell’s work in mathematical logic, to serve as the a priori source of objectivity. However, Cassirer’s reliance on Russell’s thought was limited, for he rejected Russell’s Logicism, the principal philosophical thesis of his _Principles_. Instead, Cassirer specified that the serial relation, as defined by the Formalist mathematicians, was the source of objectivity of the advanced mathematical sciences. The result was a structuralist epistemology, which was not only founded on distinctively Marburg premises, but deepened and enriched its traditional doctrines, like the genetic conception of knowledge."
