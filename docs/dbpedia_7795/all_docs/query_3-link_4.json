        "text": "To me, this sounds like a set-theory joke resting on existence of the \"empty set\".\n\n\"Some apples\" might be taken to ask whether, in the set of apples in your basket, are there multiple elements.\n\n\"Any apples\" might be taken to ask whether this set has at least one element. As in, if you have no apples, there are no elements in the set, resolving the question false.\n\n\"Do you have apples\", however, does not quantify a lower bound on the size of the set. So although there are no apples present, the set of apples does exist - it's simply empty.\n\nI thought it might be a joke about the triviality of meta ethics.\n\nThe set up is that Russell wants to know if he can have an apple: if Moore is good guy and has left Russell a spare.\n\nDo any apples exist in your basket? No, according to Moore no moral goods really exist.\n\nIs it true that there are apples in your basket? No, according to Moore moral propositions cannot be true or false.\n\nBut can I have apple anyway? Moore cheers, and hands Russell an apple because he isn't a moral nihilist.\n\nWhich is structured like a joke in the (curious) surprise of 3, and is also a fairly insightful (everyman) satire into meta ethics."
