        "text": "1872 Bertrand Russell is born 18 May at Ravenscroft, Wales, to John and Kate, Lord and Lady Amberley. John Stuart Mill is his secular godfather.\n\n1874 His mother and sister die from diphtheria in June and July, respectively.\n\n1876 In January his father dies of bronchitis. He and his brother, Frank, begin living with their paternal grandparents.\n\n1878 Lord John Russell, the former prime minister and Russell's paternal grandfather, dies, and his grandmother, Lady Francis Russell, takes charge of his upbringing.\n\n1890 Russell enters Trinity College, Cambridge University, and begins studies in applied mathematics and mathematical physics (e.g., calculus, optics, astronomy, statics, hydrostatics, dynamics). In February, he is elected to the Apostles, an intellectual secret society at Cambridge.\n\n1893 Upon coming of age in May, Russell inherits £20,000. In July, he begins a year of philosophical studies focusing on ethics, metaphysics, and 17th-century philosophy.\n\n1894 Graduating from Cambridge in June, he chooses a fellowship thesis topic on the philosophy of non-Euclidian geometry. He marries Alys Pearsall Smith in December.\n\n1895 Russell attends economics lectures at the University of Berlin from January to March, receives a five-year fellowship from Trinity College in October, and subsequently studies German social democracy while researching his thesis on geometry.\n\n1896 In January, Russell publishes “The Logic of Geometry” and in March studies Georg Cantor’s set theory. In October, he visits the United States. In December, he publishes German Social Democracy.\n\n1897 In January, Russell publishes a review of Louis Couturat's book on Cantorian set theory, De l’Infini Mathématique (1896). In May, he reads Hermann Lotze's Metaphysik (1879) and publishes his fellowship thesis as An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry. In “Seems Madam? Nay, It Is,” a talk given in December to the Apostles, he begins to break with idealism.\n\n1898 Russell’s grandmother dies in January. In January and February, he attends John McTaggart's lectures on Lotze. Throughout the year, Russell has frequent discussions with G. E. Moore, leading to their adoption of realism and break with idealism. In September, Russell reads Alexius Meinong's Über die Bedeutung des Weberschen Gesetzes (1896). He subsequently travels to Italy, Germany, and France, visiting Couturat in November.\n\n1899 Beginning in January, Russell lectures on G. W. Leibniz at Trinity College. In April, he publishes his review of Meinong’s Über die Bedeutung and responds to Henri Poincaré’s review of his Essay on the Foundations of Geometry. In July, he again studies Cantorian set theory.\n\n1900 At Couturat's invitation, Russell gives a talk in August at the International Congress of Philosophy in Paris and attends the Second International Congress of Mathematicians, where he meets Giuseppe Peano and hears him speak. Russell acquires Peano’s publications in September and reads them all. He publishes A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz in October. Meanwhile, Russell reads volume 1 of Gottlob Frege's Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (1893). In December, he discovers what is now called Cantor's paradox of the greatest cardinal, which leads him to give a first formulation of a paradox of sets. Russell remains silent on the matter for over a year, except to Alfred North Whitehead. He completes a draft of The Principles of Mathematics.\n\n1901 In June, Russell begins to work with Whitehead on “Finite and Infinite Cardinal Numbers,” a paper that anticipates Principia Mathematica (1910-1913) by treating cardinal numbers within the logic of relations. He publishes the important “Logic of Relations” in July and November.\n\n1902 In January, Russell acknowledges that his marriage to Alys is unhappy. In May, he begins reading Alexius Meinong's Über Annahmen (1902). In June, his rereading Frege's Begriffsscrift (1879) and Grundgesetze shows him the significance of these texts. Later that month, he communicates the paradox he had earlier discovered, now called Russell's paradox, to Frege and Peano. He receives Frege's response in a matter of days. Russell informs Couturat of the paradox in September.\n\n1903 In May, Russell's The Principles of Mathematics is published; it contains his first attempt to prevent contradictions by means of distinguishing entities into types. From June through December, he works on problems of meaning and denoting.\n\n1904 In April, July, and August, Russell publishes “Meinong’s Theory of Complexes and Assumptions.” In July, he publishes “The Axiom of Infinity.”\n\n1905 In June, Russell reads “The Nature of Truth” to the Jowett Society. In July, he publishes “The Existential Import of Propositions.” In October, he publishes his most famous essay, “On Denoting,” followed in November by “On the Relation of Mathematics to Symbolic Logic.” By this time, he has drafted “On Some Difficulties in the Theory of Transfinite Numbers and Order Types” and is experimenting with a method of preventing paradoxes that does not involve type-distinctions, inspired by the techniques described in “On Denoting.”\n\n1906 In March, “On Some Difficulties in the Theory of Transfinite Numbers and Order Types” is published, followed in September by “Les Paradoxes de la Logique,” which is later published as “On Insolubilia.” In these articles, Russell continues to experiment with a substitutional method of handling the contradictions.\n\n1907 In May, Russell runs for office on the Women’s Suffrage ticket in Wimbledon, a Tory district, creating publicity for the movement but losing. Later, he publishes “On the Nature of Truth,” accepts a more complex, or ramified, theory of types, and considers the no-classes theory.\n\n1908 In May, Russell publishes “Mathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types,” written a year earlier. He is elected a fellow of the Royal Society. “Determinism and Morality,” written in May 1905, is published in October. It is later reprinted as the fourth section of “Elements of Ethics” in Philosophical Essays (1910).\n\n1909 In April, Russell publishes “Pragmatism,” an essay reviewing John Dewey, William James, and F. C. S. Schiller. It is reprinted in 1910 in Philosophical Essays.\n\n1910 In February and May, Russell publishes the first three sections of “Elements of Ethics.” In May, he also publishes “The Theory of Logical Types.” He receives a five-year lectureship at Trinity.

In April, volume 2 of Principia Mathematica is published, as is “The Philosophy of Bergson.” Poincaré dies in July. In October, Russell is working on the paper “What Is Logic?” and in December on the nature of matter.\n\n1913 Volume 3 of Principia Mathematica is published in April. In May, Russell begins work on Theory of Knowledge but abandons it in June after considering Wittgenstein’s objections to it. In July, he publishes “On the Notion of Cause.” In September, Russell meets Norbert Wiener and reads his dissertation. In the same month, he arranges for Wittgenstein’s dictation of “Notes on Logic.”\n\n1914 Between March and May, Russell teaches two classes at Harvard University, one on logic, the other on epistemology. He also gives the Lowell lectures there, which are published in August as Our Knowledge of the External World. World War I begins. Russell throws himself into antiwar, pacifist work. In November, he delivers “On Scientific Method in Philosophy” as the Herbert Spencer lecture at Oxford University.\n\n1915 In January, Russell publishes “The Ethics of War.” In February, he meets D.H. Lawrence. In May, he receives a renewal of his five-year lectureship at Trinity College. In July, he publishes “The Ultimate Constituents of Matter.” In November, he publishes Justice in War-Time, rejecting his earlier moral objectivism for moral subjectivism.\n\n1916 In April, Russell begins working for the No-Conscription Fellowship. In June, he is fined £110 for his antiwar speeches and writings. In July, he is dismissed from Trinity College for these antiwar efforts. Principles of Social Reconstruction is published in November.\n\n1917 Russell’s publications throughout the year mostly concern the war. From October to December, he delivers lectures in London on mathematical logic, which he later publishes as Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy (1919).\n\n1918 In January, Cantor dies. From January till March, Russell delivers eight lectures in London on logical atomism; the first two are published in the Monist in October. In February, he is sentenced to six months in Brixton prison for referring in print to American use of police to break strikes. Russell enters prison in May. He begins to reject dualism for neutral monism, writing much of what is to become The Analysis of Mind (1921) as well working on Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy. He leaves prison in September.\n\n1919 In January, April, and July, the remaining lectures on logical atomism are published in The Monist. In February, Russell writes “On Propositions: What They Are and How They Mean.” From May to June, he delivers lectures on the analysis of mind.
