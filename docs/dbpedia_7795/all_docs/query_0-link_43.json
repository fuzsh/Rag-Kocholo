If one were to explain carefully what philosophical nonsense was supposed to be, would one be greeted with incredulity? How do people react to being accused to talking nonsense themselves? Is anything analogous to an illusion of meaning recognised in everyday life? In dream-reports perhaps? Or in the utterances of schizophrenics or those under the influence of drugs? Or in certain jokes and hoaxes? Are contradictions felt to be meaningless? I argue that, though it is clear that experimental philosophy could shed some light on these questions, their subject matter creates special difficulties. First, it is more difficult than usual to formulate questions and produce ‘vignettes’ that do not subtly encourage certain responses at the expense of others. Second, the fact that philosophical nonsense is a metaphilosophical concept ensures that its investigation is going to be more indirect than would be that of knowledge or intention, for example.\n\nIn this paper I want to show how Bernard Williams contributed, especially with his 'turn' in Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, to overcoming the dichotomy between analytic and continental philosophy, creating a style of reflection in... more\n\nIn this paper I want to show how Bernard Williams contributed, especially with his 'turn' in Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, to overcoming the dichotomy between analytic and continental philosophy, creating a style of reflection in which conceptual analysis is deeply connected with historical awareness. The idea of genealogy, taken from Nietzsche but heavily modified by Williams, then emerged in books such as Shame and Necessity and Truth and Truthfulness, as an efficacious method for reflection in theoretical and practical philosophy.\n\nCommon sense has often been unflatteringly defined as a grab-bag of unjustified beliefs and incoherent intuitions.

Likewise, G. E. Moore’s work as the 20th Century’s champion of common sense philosophy is often regarded as little more than a historical curiosity, rife with arguments that are both unconvincing and question begging. In opposition to these claims, I will show that common sense beliefs and Moore have been unfairly overlooked and that a closer examination of his work will provide important epistemological insights. In “A Defence of Common Sense” Moore makes a list of common sense assertions that the non-philosopher would regard as obvious truths. The list asserts commonly accepted beliefs such as that he has a body and that objects exist outside his mind. The purpose of Moore's project was to reject the speculative claims of idealism as well as provide a response to skeptical worries about the justification of one’s most basic knowledge claims. While Moore invokes the notion of common sense to defend his list of beliefs he never bothers to define or defend the notion of common sense itself. In this paper I propose a definition for common sense beliefs as learned but not taught knowledge. Drawing on both Moore and the later Wittgenstein, I will show that common sense beliefs are acquired through an interaction between the agent and the world and that they are necessary for the construction of further beliefs. This perspective on common sense beliefs can both provide a better defence of Moore's project and provide the tools through which a diagnosis of skeptical dilemmas can be reached.\n\nThis paper is an essay in the history of philosophy.

In it I ponder the fact that, not only are there no uncontroversial examples of philosophical nonsense, there are no uncontroversial examples of what one might call ‘analogue philosophical nonsense’. These would be non-philosophical cases of someone’s believing he means something when in reality he means nothing. (Someone’s saying, ‘It’s 5 o’clock on the sun’ is sometimes offered as an example.) I ask what conditions such cases would need to satisfy. What would count as a compellingly clear case of an illusion of meaning? Why has no one described one?\n\nIn spite of an evolving contemporary debate over the concept of “epistemic possibility,” nearly every philosopher assumes that the concept is equivalent to a mere absence of epistemic impossibility, that a proposition is epistemically... more\n\nIn spite of an evolving contemporary debate over the concept of “epistemic possibility,” nearly every philosopher assumes that the concept is equivalent to a mere absence of epistemic impossibility, that a proposition is epistemically possible as long as it is not inconsistent with some relevant body of knowledge. I suggest that we challenge this deeply entrenched assumption. I assemble an array of data that singles out the distinctive meaning and function of the attitude of taking propositions as epistemically possible, and suggest that this data is best explained by a positive evidentialist conception of epistemic possibility. On this conception, a proposition is epistemically possible to a subject if and only if the subject has cognitive access to evidence that specifically supports that proposition.\n\nAfter writing \"The Literary Modernist Assault on Philosophy,\" I decided to focus on Virginia Woolf's critique of philosophy.

At first, Woolf, like most Bloomsbury writers, was both moved and influenced by the philosophy of G.E. Moore. But around the year 1920, she started to get very critical of Moore and philosophy more generally. This frustration with philosophy becomes most apparent in her novels To the Lighthouse (1927) and Orlando (1928), and in this essay, I explain why Woolf turned against philosophy. Hume scholars, in particular, might be amused by Woolf's depiction of the philosopher in To the Lighthouse, which I discuss in the essay.\n\nThis edition of G. E.

Moore's notes taken at Wittgenstein's seminal Cambridge lectures in the early 1930s provides, for the first time, an almost verbatim record of those classes. The presentation of the notes is both accessible and faithful to their original manuscripts, and a comprehensive introduction and synoptic table of contents provide the reader with essential contextual information and summaries of the topics in each lecture. The lectures form an excellent introduction to Wittgenstein's middle-period thought, covering a broad range of philosophical topics, ranging from core questions in the philosophy of language, mind, logic, and mathematics, to illuminating discussions of subjects on which Wittgenstein says very little elsewhere, including ethics, religion, aesthetics, psychoanalysis, and anthropology. The volume also includes a 1932 essay by Moore critiquing Wittgenstein's conception of grammar, together with Wittgenstein's response. A companion website offers access to images of the entire set of source manuscripts.\n\nNous nous proposons dans le présent article de revenir sur l’enjeu de Über Gewissheit : doit-on lire cet ensemble de notes comme l’ultime réponse de Wittgenstein à l’idéalisme sceptique ou comme la réélaboration de nos catégories de... more\n\nNous nous proposons dans le présent article de revenir sur l’enjeu de Über Gewissheit : doit-on lire cet ensemble de notes comme l’ultime réponse de Wittgenstein à l’idéalisme sceptique ou comme la réélaboration de nos catégories de connaissance (croire, savoir, être certain)? La réponse à cette question passe tout d’abord par la prise en compte du dialogue avec Moore et en particulier par une réévaluation de sa défense du sens commun et de sa preuve du monde extérieur aussi célèbre que controversée. Nous soulignons les limites d’une interprétation purement dogmatique de ces textes en mettant en évidence le caractère problématique du dogmatisme mooréen, avant de revenir sur les deux critiques que Malcolm puis Wittgenstein en ont proposées. Un bref rappel de la critique de Malcolm nous permet ensuite de saisir la singularité de la démarche de Wittgenstein qui consiste par l’analyse grammaticale des propositions \"intéressantes\" de Moore à renvoyer dos à dos les prétentions au savoir de Moore et les doutes sceptiques.\n\nIn this article, we propose a reconsideration of the Über Gewissheit issue: should this collection of notes be read as Wittgenstein’s final response to sceptical idealism or as a re-elaboration of the categories of knowledge (to believe, to know, to be certain) ? The response to this question will first take into account the dialogue with Moore, and will re-evalutate his well-known and controversial defence of common sense and proof of the external world. Before going on to consider the two critiques proposed by Malcolm, then Wittgenstein, we will underline the limitations of a purely dogmatic interpretation of these texts by highlighting the problematical nature of Moore’s dogmatism. A short reminder of Malcolm’s critique will then enable us to grasp the singularity of Wittgenstein’s approach. By way of a grammatical analysis of Moore’s «interesting» propositions, Witt- genstein dismisses both Moore’s claims to knowledge and the sceptic’s doubts.\n\nIn April 1939, G. E.

Moore read a paper to the Cambridge University Moral Science Club entitled ‘Certainty’. In it, amongst other things, Moore made the claims that: (i) the phrase ‘it is certain’ could be used with sense-experience-statements, such as ‘I have a pain’, to make statements such as ‘It is certain that I have a pain’; and that (ii) sense-experience-statements can be said to be certain in the same sense as some material-thing-statements can be — namely in the sense that they can be safely counted on. When Moore later read his paper to Wittgenstein, Wittgenstein took violent exception to it, and the two entered into a heated exchange. The only known notes of this exchange are a previously unpublished verbatim record of part of it, taken by Norman Malcolm. This paper is an edition of Malcolm’s notes. These notes are valuable for both philosophical and scholarly reasons. They give us a glimpse of a sustained exchange between Wittgenstein and a real-life interlocutor; they contain a defence by Wittgenstein of the idea that a word’s use can illuminate its meaning; and they provide evidence of Wittgenstein’s philosophical engagement with the topic of certainty, and with Moore’s thought on it, long before he began to write the notes which make up *On Certainty*, in 1949.\n\nPrimitivists about truth maintain that truth cannot be analysed in more fundamental terms.

Defences of primitivism date back to the early years of analytic philosophy, being offered by G.E. Moore, Bertrand Russell, and Gottlob Frege. In more recent years, a number of contemporary philosophers—including Donald Davidson, Ernest Sosa, Trenton Merricks, Douglas Patterson, and Jamin Asay—have followed suit, defending their own versions of primitivism. I'll begin by offering a brief history of primitivism, situating each of these views within the landscape of primitivist truth theories and detailing some of their core motivations and apparent shortcomings. To close the discussion, I'll offer a diagnosis of the prospects of primitivism, focusing on the mystery challenge, which has loomed large throughout the history of primitivist truth theories, and the methodology that should be used in evaluating primitivist (and other) truth theories going forward.\n\nThe concepts of particular and universal have grown so familiar that their significance has become difficult to discern, like coins that have been passed back and forth too many times, worn smooth so their values can no longer be read.

On the Genealogy of Universals seeks to overcome our sense of over-familiarity with these concepts by providing a case study of their evolution during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, a study that shows how the history of these concepts is bound up with the origins and development of analytic philosophy itself. Understanding how these concepts were taken up, transfigured, and given up by the early analytic philosophers, enables us to recover and reanimate the debate amongst them that otherwise remains Delphic. This book begins from the early, originating texts of analytic philosophy that have hitherto baffled commentators, including Moore's early papers, and engages afresh with the neglected contributions of philosophical figures that historians of analytic philosophy have mostly since forgotten, including Stout and Whitehead. This sheds new light upon the relationships of Moore to Russell, Russell to Wittgenstein, and Wittgenstein to Ramsey.\n\nAnalytic ethics in the central period – extending from the beginning of the twentieth century to post-World War II linguistic analysis – is too often construed by historians and philosophers alike in monolithic terms as the emotivism of... more\n\nAnalytic ethics in the central period – extending from the beginning of the twentieth century to post-World War II linguistic analysis – is too often construed by historians and philosophers alike in monolithic terms as the emotivism of A. J. Ayer. In contrast, we argue that a multiplicity of ethical doctrines were developed by analytic philosophers at this time of which Ayer’s emotivism was just one. Moreover, we maintain that this multiplicity of ethical doctrines was itself the result of a multiplicity of conceptions of analysis and that connecting these two sets of beliefs makes for the best understanding of analytic ethics.\n\nIn Chapter 2 of Principia Ethica, Moore presents two criticisms of Spencer's evolutionary ethics.

The first is that Spencer wrongly uses the terms \"more evolved\" (a natural term), and \"higher\" and \"better\" (ethical terms) as though they were equivalent, and thereby commits the naturalistic fallacy. The second is that since Spencer believes that pleasure is the same as goodness, then he is once again committing the naturalistic fallacy. It will be argued here that both of Moore's attacks fail since he misunderstood Spencer's meanings of the terms \"higher\" and \"good.\" In light of Moore's failure, it is suggested that the naturalistic fallacy must be qualified so it does not reduce simply to an allegation that an ethical theory denies moral realism.\n\nHow do philosophical accusations of talking nonsense relate to the layperson’s notions of meaning and meaningfulness?

Why, having abandoned emotivism for the error theory, did he switch back to emotivism in the 1920s? Perhaps he did not relish the thought that as a moralist he was a professional hypocrite. In addition, Russell's version of the error theory suffers from severe defects. He commits the naturalistic fallacy and runs afoul of his own and Moore's arguments against subjectivism. These defects could be repaired, but only by abandoning Russell's semantics.Russell preferred to revert to emotivism.\n\nI am planning a history of the concept of philosophical nonsense and naturally difficult historical and exegetical questions have come up.

Charles Pigden has argued that it goes back at least as far as Hobbes and that Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant (on some interpretations) and pragmatists such as William James, as well as numerous Twentieth-Century philosophers make use of it. In this ‘paper’ I put forward for general discussion such questions as whether Hobbes was the first nonsensicalist, whether Kant was a nonsensicalist at all, which philosophers if any have considered contradictions to be meaningless and whether Wittgenstein thought that his concept of criterion could legitimately be used verificationistically. I shall continue to add further questions as they occur to me.\n\nI discuss methodology in epistemology.

I argue that settling the facts, even the epistemic facts, fails to settle the questions of intellectual policy at the center of our epistemic lives. One upshot is that the standard methodology of analyzing concepts like knowledge, justification, rationality, and so on is misconceived. More generally, any epistemic method that seeks to issue in intellectual policy by settling the facts, whether by way of abductive theorizing or empirical investigation, ​ no matter how reliable​ , is inapt. The argument is a radicalization of Moore's Open Question Argument. I conclude by considering the ramifications of this argument for the current debate surrounding \"Modal Security\", a proposed necessary condition on undermining defeat.\n\nIn his book, The Refutation of Idealism, G.E.

Moore (1903) attempts to discredit the grounds for idealism and, with it, sensualism, by disputing the proposition esse is percipi as it relates to mental processes. Moore distinguishes percipi from percipere, thus distinguishing between mental knowledge of things (perception) and propositional knowledge of things (judgement). In refuting the role of perception in knowledge of existence, Moore deemphasizes experience as a source of knowledge. Moore reformulates the concept of knowledge through sensation by positing a sensualism where sense-datum is directly apprehended through an act of consciousness. Though Moore's reformulation refutes sensualism's mental claim over existence, his notion of sense-datum removes knowledge from certainty and the meaning of the object as given. In this paper, I show how Husserl's argument against sensualism in the second meditation of Cartesian Meditations can also refute Moore's sense-datum. I will first introduce Moore's formulation of sense-datum as it relates to concerns that he shares with Husserl. I will then show how Husserl's concept of transcendental experience forms a basis for certainty in judgement by allowing for apodictic evidence through the transcendental reduction. Apodicticity allows Husserl to resolve the problem of sensualism without removing the content of experienced objects from knowledge.\n\nHow do philosophical accusations of talking nonsense relate to the layperson’s notions of meaning and meaningfulness?

Some argue that it strikes us as absurd because belief is normative. The beliefs that it is raining and that one doesn’t believe that it is are, it is suggested, self-falsifying. But, so it is argued, it is essential to belief that beliefs ought not, among other things, be self-falsifying. That is why the beliefs strike us as absurd. I argue that while the absurdity may consist in and be explained by self-falsification, we have no reasons to accept the further claim that self-falsifying beliefs are absurd because violating norms.\n\nI argue that Mackie's thesis about courage and self-interest is neither consistent with his 'error theory' of value nor convincing in itself.

The question of the objectivity of value needs to be distinguished from that of whether one value can objectively outweigh or outrank another. This is so even when the only values under consideration are self-interested ones.\n\nThis paper criticizes one of the main ways in which Kant argues for transcendental idealism by combining two previous objections to Kant's argument (made by G.E.

Moore and Ralph Walker, respectively) into a unified critique. The combination of these objections creates a dilemma for Kant that hinges on the status of transcendental arguments as a possible source of a priori cognition and reveals a problematic asymmetry in his argument by elimination strategy. After the introduction (section 1), I begin by clarifying some basic terminology (section 2), proceed to present Kant's argument and its textual sources (section 3), elaborate the dialectic that involves Moore's and Walker's objections and the problem with Kant's argument (section 4), and conclude with a brief criticism of Lucy Allais's alternative interpretation of Kant's argument (section 5).\n\nIn this paper, I offer an understanding of G.E.

Moore's epistemology as presented in, \"A Defence of Common Sense\" and \"Proof of an External World\". To frame the discussion, I look to Roderick Chisholm's essay, The Problem of the Criterion. I begin by looking at two ways that Chisholm believes one can respond to the problem of the criterion, and, referring back to Moore's essays, explain why it is not unreasonable for Chisholm to believe that he is following a line of reasoning that Moore might take. I then show why I believe Chisholm is actually trying to do something quite different from what Moore was, and thus misses Moore's actual point. I conclude that Moore is best understood as rejecting traditional epistemological concerns. By forcing Moore to deal with a traditional epistemological problem, it will become clear how bold Moore's \"epistemology\" is.\n\nIn his Principia Ethica (1903) George Edward Moore notes that \"the meaning of good [res-ists] correct analysis\".

This raises two questions: (i) What is the peculiar meaning of \"good\" and its cognates? This leads to the problem of moral obligation. (ii) What is the nature of analysis if so easily rendered futile in central cases? This leads to the paradox of analysis. The paper argues that these problems are linked by the same solution. Once we, unlike Moore, correctly account for the semantics and the pragmatics of valuing and explanation the problem dissolves and the air of paradox is dispelled.\n\nBack to Realism.

The idea of\n\nunanalysable moral properties has been repeatedly criticized and yet a number\n\nof authors in the recent literature have proposed new versions of a kind of moral\n\nrealism inspired by Moore’s perspective. These ideas are discussed here, pointing\n\nout that they all share a return to realism but that they still offer a rather «passive»\n\naccount of practical reason.

I argue that Russell was a meta-ethicist of some significance. In the course of his long philosophical career, hecanvassed most of the meta-ethical options that have dominated debate in the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries — naturalism, non-naturalism, emotivism and the error-theory (anticipating Stevenson and Ayer on the one hand and Mackie on the other), and even, to some extent, subjectivism and relativism. And though none of his theories quite worked out, there is much to be learned from his mistakes. Nor is this all. His ARGUMENTS as well as his THEORIES are often interesting and instructive. The ethical corollary to the argument of ‘Seems Madam? Nay, It Is,’ puts the kybosh on any attempt to resolve Sidgwick's Dualism of Practical Reason by arguing that although we are distinct beings with different interests in the world of Appearance, we are, in Reality, all one (§3). Russell's arguments against objectivism are often quite powerful, and one anticipates Gilbert Harman's influential argument that objective values can be safely dismissed since they lack explanatory power (§9.3-9.4). Russell's damning critique of Moore's analytic consequentialism led Moore to abandon the view and perhaps to give up his ‘unduly anti-reforming’ moral conservatism. Moreover Russell's INDIRECT influence on meta-ethics may have been profound since the Open Question Argument, was probably invented to deal with Russell's ideas. Finally, in the realm of normative ethics, Russell developed a sensible and humane version of consequentialism, which (despite its shaky meta-ethical foundations) is resistant, if not immune, to many of the standard criticisms, especially if combined — as Russell thought it should be combined — with a healthy dose of political skepticism. It provides a powerful tool for social and political criticism, a tool which Russell vigorously employed on a vast range of topics in his writings on practical ethics.\n\nENGLISH ABSTRACT: \"The paper discusses possible consequences of avoiding naturalistic fallacy (NF) in interpersonal communication.

The hypothetical conversation between two subjects (X and Y) about an object (α) is outlined and its variants are specified. In the variant 1, X states that α is good and Y asks question, why it is good. X says that α is good, because, e.g., it is economically effective. This can be regarded, according to basically understood Moore’s view, as an instance of NF. In the variant 2, X avoids answering the Y’s question. X is saying only ‘α is good and that’s it!’, which can be interpreted as a reference to Moorean self-evidence category. Although X avoids NF, it impairs a conversation. One can also avoid NF through: not asking ‘why α is good?’ (variant 3) or not using word ‘good’ (variant 4). Analysis of all variants shows that avoiding NF can have troublesome consequences because of, i.a., common use of the word ‘good’ or frequent need to justify statements about goodness of some object. Those consequences seem to be independent from the mere evaluation of Moore’s argumentation about NF, e.g., a controversy whether NF is a real fallacy or only a consequence of Moore’s assumptions regarding, i.a., definitions.\" POLSKI ABSTRAKT: \"Artykuł omawia możliwe skutki unikania błędu naturalistycznego (BN) w komunikacji międzyludzkiej.

W 1. wariancie X twierdzi, że α jest dobre, a Y zadaje pytanie, dlaczego jest dobre. X odpowiada, iż α jest dobre, bo jest, np. efektywne ekonomicznie. To można ocenić, zgodnie z podstawowo ujętymi poglądami Moore’a, jako przykład BN. W 2. wariancie X unika odpowiedzi na pytanie Y. X mówi tylko „α jest dobre i tyle!”, co można uznać za nawiązanie do Moore’owskiej kategorii oczywistości samej przez się. Choć X unika BN, to utrudnia rozmowę. Unikać BN można też przez: niezadawanie pytania „dlaczego α jest dobre?” (wariant 3) czy nieużywanie słowa „dobry” (wariant 4). Analiza wszystkich wariantów pokazuje, że unikanie BN może mieć problematyczne skutki z powodu, m.in., powszechnego użycia słowa „dobry” czy częstej potrzeby, by uzasadnić tezy o przysługującej czemuś cesze dobra. Te konsekwencje zdają się być niezależne od samej oceny argumentacji Moore’a o BN, np., kontrowersji, czy BN jest rzeczywistym błędem czy wynikiem przyjętych przez Moore’a założeń o, m.in., definicjach.\"\n\nRussell on Ethics presents a coherent and comprehensive collection of Russell's ethical writings, drawing on a wide range of his publications on ethical concerns, many of which have been difficult to access by students and general... more\n\nRussell on Ethics presents a coherent and comprehensive collection of Russell's ethical writings, drawing on a wide range of his publications on ethical concerns, many of which have been difficult to access by students and general readers. Charles Pigden provides an accessible introduction to the papers, situating them within the field of ethics as a whole and detailed annotations on the papers themselves, analysing their arguments and exploring their relevance to current concerns. Russell on Ethics represents a valuable insight into Russell as an ethicist, which will be useful to both specialist and non-specialist alike\n\nThe history of philosophy can be seen either as a contribution to history or a contribution to philosophy or perhaps as a bit of both.

Hutchinson fail on both counts. The book is bad: bad in itself (since it quite definitely ought not to be) and bad as a companion to Principia (since it sets students a bad example of slapdash, lazy and pretentious philosophizing and would tend to put them off reading Moore). As a conscientious reviewer I ploughed through every page and I have to say that I resented every minute of my life that I wasted on the book. Don’t waste any of yours."
