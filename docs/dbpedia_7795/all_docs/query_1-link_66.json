        "text": "I have derived valuable assistance from unpublished writings of G. E. Moore{*) and J. M. Keynes: from the former, as regards the relations of sense-data to physical objects, and from the latter as regards probability and induction. I have also profited greatly by the criticisms and suggestions of Professor Gilbert Murray.\n\n1912\n\nNOTE TO SEVENTEENTH IMPRESSION\n\nWITH reference to certain statements on pages 44, 75, 131, and 132, it should be remarked that this book was written in the early part of 1912 when China was still an Empire, and the name of the then late Prime Minister did begin with the letter B.\n\n1943\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\n\nThe student who wishes to acquire an elementary knowledge of philosophy will find it both easier and more profitable to read some of the works of the great philosophers than to attempt to derive an all-round view from handbooks. The following are specially recommended:\n\nPLATO: Republic, especially Books VI and VII.\n\nDESCARTES: Meditations.\n\nSPINOZA: Ethics.\n\nLEIBNIZ: The Monadology.\n\nBERKELEY: Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous.\n\nHUME: Enquiry concerning Human Understanding.\n\nKANT: Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics.\n\n{*} [\"It is perhaps worth mentioning that Chapters 1-10 are the 'unpublished' writings of mine, to which Lord Russell refers in the Preface to The Problems of Philosophy.\" G. E. Moore, Preface to Some Main Problems of Philosophy (1953) (A. Chrucky)]"
