        "text": "Analytic philosophy, growing largely from the work of Bertrand Russell and G.E. Moore at Cambridge University in the late 1890s, has remained a vibrant force in Western philosophy. We will study five classic and formative texts: G. E. Moore A Defense of Common Sense; Bertrand Russell On Denoting; A. J. Ayer Language, Truth and Logic; J.S. Austin How to Do Things With Words; Saul Kripke Naming and Necessity. There are no prerequisites.\n\nClass size: 20\n\nCross-listed: Mind, Brain & Behavior Ever wondered about what it is to be a thinking thing? Ever wondered how our thoughts are related to our brains? This course is a philosophical exploration of these topics. The problem for the course can be stated this way: When we look at the nature of our thoughts they always seem to be about something or other, and when we look at brain matter (physical stuff) it does not seem to be about anything at all. We know that thoughts and brains are related in some way, but given what appears to be their different characters, it is hard to understand the nature of this relationship. Through close reading of texts beginning with selections from Descartess Meditations and ending with contemporary philosophical writing, we gain not only a sense of the history of the problem, but also insight into our own nature. In addition, we will cover related topics including free will, personal identity, immortality of the soul, and others. This course emphasizes close reading with an eye toward thorough understanding of the text. The formal requirements of the course are a mid-term (in-class), final exam (take-home), and two very short papers.Class size: 22\n\nA course closely examining selected texts in the history of philosophy, emphasizing historical connections and developments in the subject from the 18th to the 20th Century. Authors include Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Russell, Sartre, William James, and Wittgenstein. Like this courses predecessor (PHIL 203: History of Philosophy 1, which is prerequisite), we will keep questions of philosophical methodology in mind as we proceed through issues in ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of perception, and philosophy of language. Class size: 22\n\nCross-listed: Political Studies, Human Rights According to Aristotles Politics, a state is among the things that exist by nature. In Aristotles view, it is natural for human beings to live together in a political community, since it is only in a political community that human beings are fully capable of living well. In modern times, however, this ancient view of the state has come to seem doubtful and even dangerous. For many modern thinkers  beginning with Thomas Hobbes in the seventeenth century  the state is anything but natural. It is at best a useful artifice designed to keep the peace among naturally conflicting interests, and at worst a monstrous fraud whereby those in power oppress their subjects in the name of the common good. This difference between ancient and modern views of the state has profound implications for a series of fundamental questions in political theory: what is a political community? How can political authority be legitimate? Is disobedience or revolution against the existing authorities ever justified? If so, when? This course introduces students to the philosophical tradition of reflection on these questions through reading, discussing, and writing about classic works of political theory from antiquity to the present. The course is designed for sophomores and juniors who want to deepen their interest in political philosophy and to reflect on the foundations of their own political engagement. In addition to Aristotle and Hobbes, our primary readings will come from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Stuart Mill, and John Rawls. First-year students may apply.Class size: 22\n\nCross-listed: Science, Technology & Society In this course, we will examine the conceptual underpinnings of science. In so doing, we will address the following issues: (i) To what extent does the acquisition of knowledge of the causal structure of the world depend, not just on sensory observation, but also on knowledge of a purely conceptual, non-observational kind? (ii) What is it to explain an event? (iii) What are laws of nature? (iv) What is the justification for inferences from the known to what is unknown? (v) Is there a distinction between scientific truths and non-scientific truths? (vi) What is it for one event to cause another? (vii) What is measurement? In our attempts to make headway on these important topics, we will read seminal works by Newton, Leibniz, Mill, Franck, Popper, Hempel, Reichenbach, Clarence Lewis, and David Lewis.Class size: 22\n\nCross-listed: Classics; Philosophy Why did Plato write dialogues? Answers to this perennial question have frequently appealed to Platos conception of dialectic, although the meaning of that term in his texts is itself a matter of considerable debate. In this course, we shall be examining Platos writings from both a philosophical and a literary perspective. Our main business will be close and careful reading of whole dialogues, paying particular attention to the hermeneutical implications of the dialogue formincluding such features as dramatic setting, character, and the interrogative mode itselfand the conception of dialectic as it emerges both in and through Platos writing. Readings from Plato will include Euthyphro, Euthydemus, Phaedrus, Republic, and Symposium, among others. We will also read some of Platos predecessors in the Greek traditionboth philosophical and literaryand examples of modern critical approaches to Plato. The focus will be on the primary texts, and all readings will be in English. Class size: 22\n\nCross-listed: Global & Intl Studies; Human Rights, Science, Technology & Society Through a reading of both theoretical literature and case studies, we will examine a range of topics in contemporary debates over medical ethics: issues of genetics, reproduction, death and dying, medical research and experimentation, involuntary psychiatric hospitalization and treatment, informed consent, confidentiality, and paternalism. On the theoretical side, we will look at competing ethical positions philosophers have proposed as models for understanding and resolving issues of medical ethics and study basic concepts with which all such theories grapple (autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, justice). On the practical side, we will examine the ways these theories and concepts are applied to actual cases and consider the conflict between philosophical-ethical reasoning and social, religious, and legal concerns.Class size: 22\n\nCross-listed: Global & Intl Studies, Human Rights The pre-Socratic philosopher, Heraclitus, wrote: War is the father of all, king of all. Some it makes Gods, some it makes men. Some it makes slaves, some free We must realize that war is universal, strife is justice, and that all things come to being and pass away through strife. War has always been and will always be a subject of philosophic inquiry. Throughout history, philosophers have found themselves asking: What is war? What is it to be at war? To what extent can peace be understood as the antithesis to war? Under what circumstances can war be considered just and/or morally justified? In what ways does war become knowable and thinkable to us? Lastly, in what ways does Philosophy, insofar as it is polemical and explosive, position itself as at war or warlike in nature? This course will attempt to explore these questionsboth their formulations and answers throughout the history of philosophyby considering texts from the following thinkers: Heraclitus, Plato, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Clausewitz, Hegel, Kant, Nietzsche, Freud, Benjamin, Foucault, Deleuze, Derrida, Virilio, Agamben, Zizek, Butler, Ronell.Class size: 22\n\nAn intensive advanced seminar required of all philosophy majors in their junior year. A problem in contemporary philosophy is carefully selected, exactingly defined, and thoroughly researched; an essay or article is written addressing the problem, going through numerous revisions as a result of class responses, faculty guidance, and further research; the article is formally presented to the seminar, followed by discussion and debate; and the article in its completed form is submitted to an undergraduate or professional journal of philosophy or to an undergraduate conference in philosophy. The seminar integrates the teaching and practice of writing into the study of the subject matter of the seminar. Emphasis will be placed on the art of research; the development, composition, organization, and revision of analytical prose; the use of evidence to support an argument; strategies of interpretation and analysis of texts; and the mechanics and art of style and documentation. This course is required of all junior Philosophy majors.Class size: 15\n\nIn her landmark 1958 essay Modern Moral Philosophy, G. E. M. Anscombe argued that the central concepts of modern moral thought  in particular, the concept of moral obligation  ought to be abandoned, on the grounds that they have come to be used without any clear sense. Anscombe suggested that one starting point for revitalizing the subject of moral philosophy might be to return instead to the ancient tradition of thinking about ethics in terms of specific virtues and vices, such as justice and injustice. At the same time, Anscombe warned that we could not properly recover this ancient tradition unless we first develop an adequate understanding of what type of characteristic a virtue is. In the decades since Anscombe wrote, virtue ethics has become one of the most lively and controversial movements within contemporary ethical theory. Much obscurity and disagreement remains, however, about what exactly a virtue is and what is distinctive about a virtue approach to moral philosophy. In this advanced seminar, students will have the opportunity to examine the diverse forms of contemporary virtue theory in detail and to develop independent research projects related to the themes and problems of virtue ethics. In addition to Anscombes writings, we will focus on works by other central figures in contemporary virtue theory, including Philippa Foot, Iris Murdoch, Alasdair MacIntyre, John McDowell, and Bernard Williams.
