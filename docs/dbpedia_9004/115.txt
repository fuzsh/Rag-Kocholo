It takes courage and confidence to embark into the unknown, especially on your own. But that's what a number of country stars have done at some point in their musical careers -- even after spending years as part of a duo, trio or group of some sort.

Some country artists were in acclaimed duos or bands before venturing into solo careers; others were in little-known groups, and going solo was the first step to massive success. Many times, these artists went solo because their group went on a hiatus. Since then, some have returned to their original bands, a few bands have dissolved, and others have decided to stay solo while the group continued without them; some singers are even doing some combination of those three things.
