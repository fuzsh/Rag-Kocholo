Often underrated but highly celebrated. SOLO (The Group) formed when Eunique Mack, Darnell Chavis, and James Smith (R.I.P.) traded their street singing on the boulevards of Los Angeles for a shot at conquering Amateur night at the Apollo. The three hitchhiked across America with nothing but their voices and a dream. Eventually making it to New York City, they joined musical forces with upright Jazz bassist Rob Anderson and later vocalist Dan Stokes. As amateurs, they never made it to the Apollo. Fate would find them spotted singing on the streets of New York's SOHO district by legendary music producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (Janet Jackson, Boyz II Men, Mariah Carey).

A week later, Jam & Lewis brought SOLO to the famed Flyte Tyme Studios in Minneapolis, MN, and signed the group. In 1995, the duo produced and released the group's debut R&B Soul-infused album, "Solo," on their Perspective/A&M records. A signature of the album is its doo-wop A Cappella vignettes of Sam Cooke's- classics "Cupid," "What a Wonderful World," "Another Saturday Night," and The Drifter's "Under the Boardwalk." "Solo" was critically acclaimed, certified Gold, and sold over 750,000 copies. The album produced two top ten singles, "Heaven"- #1 Billboard AC R&B and "Where Do You Want Me to Put It"- #8 Billboard R&B single and was nominated for Soul Train Album of the Year.
