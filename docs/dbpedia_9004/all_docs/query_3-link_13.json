        "text": "Travel can change our perception and expand our knowledge of the world, but sometimes it can be hard to find that perfect travel partner and going alone can be intimidating. That’s why we created our Solo Tours. They’re the perfect blend of group travel benefits, with a host of solo touches (like an included private room), and they give you the freedom to explore the world. They also provide safety and peace of mind for rapidly growing numbers of solo female travelers.\n\nOur Solo Tours visit some of the most recognizable places on the planet while also taking you to off-the-beaten-path locales that are sure to stick in your memory forever. If you’re ready to take the plunge and go solo, leave the planning to the experts (that’s us!), and focus on what matters most: taking in the sights, sounds, flavors, and traditions of a new-to-you place.\n\nIf taking off on an adventure and making lasting connections with fellow solo travelers sound great to you, check out the best solo trips to take in 2024. Keep reading to learn about 21 of our best-in-class Solo Tours.\n\n1. France\n\nFrance is one of the best places for solo trips, that’s why we have a brand new France for Solo Travelers: Paris, Provence & the Riviera tour. Prepare to be immersed in Parisian culture, world renowned French food and wine, and bucolic landscapes. Begin in the metropolitan capital of Paris, where you’ll drive the sycamore-lined Avenue des Champs-Élysées, take in the magnificent Arc de Triomphe, and of course take photos in front of the iconic Eiffel Tower. After a few days in the City of Light, you’ll board a south-bound train through the charming countryside to Lyon. Continue your journey through Provence while exploring medieval villages and tasting regional cheese, charcuterie, and wines. Finally, you’ll travel to the Mediterranean coast of Nice, stopping along the way to visit the picturesque French village of Moustiers-Sainte-Marie, before enjoying sun and sand in the French Riviera.\n\n2. Eastern Europe\n\nBaroque and Brutalist, medieval and modern, opulent and ordinary, the contrasts of this region make it a destination for solo travelers like no other. Our brand new Eastern Europe for Solo Travelers: Budapest to Prague tour takes you through the full spectrum of unique highlights. You’ll see impressive sites in marquee cities like Budapest and Prague, hidden gems like an overnight in Bratislava, and an excursion to the little known wine region of Hungary’s Lake Balaton. Want even more time to explore Eastern Europe? Add the extension to Poland where you’ll admire Gothic architecture in Wrocław and reverently tour WWII sites of Kraków, taking in the solemn and storied history.\n\n3. Turkey\n\nTurkey is one of the best places for solo trips because you can experience multicultural moments in a country that spans Europe and Asia—like exploring Istanbul’s Sultanahmet neighborhood, seeing Roman ruins in Ephesus, and revering the desolate beauty of Cappadocia. Our new Turkey for Solo Travelers: Istanbul, Ephesus & Cappadocia tour is filled with adventure and photo-worthy iconic sights. On one trip you’ll learn about the region’s religious history, admire centuries-old UNESCO World Heritage Sites, bask in the sun, and explore cultural hubs. Enjoy an expertly guided trip with the safety and comfort of your group. Your knowledgable Tour Director will guide you through wonders such as the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque in Istanbul, stunning scenery of the Turkish Lakes region, and the jaw-dropping fairy chimneys of Cappadocia.\n\n4. Ireland\n\nThanks to its friendly locals, hundreds of historical sites and museums, and walkable cities and villages, Ireland is one of the best places for solo female travel. While exploring Dublin on our Ireland for Solo Travelers tour, you can soak in the city’s rich history with your tour mates as a local expert leads the way, and take a solo stroll through the Guinness Brewery at your own pace. You’ll have the opportunity to drink in a smooth pint—and the 360-degree city views—on its top floor. On the way to Galway, stop to wander with your fellow travelers along the tops of the towering Cliffs of Moher, then search for the perfect Claddagh ring or pop into a lively pub on your free time.\n\n5. Italy\n\nItaly may be one of the most romantic places on the planet (we’re looking at you, Venice), but it’s also one of the best places for solo trips if you love history, architecture, art, wine, food, and stunning scenery. On a top-to-bottom tour of Venice, Florence & Rome for Solo Travelers, you’ll visit iconic sites such as St. Mark’s Square in Venice and the Colosseum in Rome. Spend a free day in Florence searching for the best bistecca alla fiorentina or walking through the gilded halls of the Vatican in Rome. If you aren’t ready to end your tour of Italy, extend your time with a visit to the Sorrento Peninsula, where you’ll stroll along the preserved streets of Pompeii and take a ferry to the fabled isle of Capri.\n\nFor connoisseurs of la dolce vita who enjoy the island life, Sicily is one of the best solo travel destinations in Italy. The rustic charm of this Mediterranean island is on full display on our Sicily for Solo Travelers tour, with visits to Palermo, Syracuse, and Taormina. Guided tours of stunning cathedrals and a hands-on cooking class with your fellow solo travelers are only a few of the highlights of this Italy tour. You’ll visit Taormina, made famous by the hit TV series The White Lotus, and explore the rich Greek history and ancient Jewish baths of Ortygia, the tiny island connected to Sicily by a footbridge. Enjoy the panoramic sunset views of Mount Etna as you sip a glass of wine and toast to new Sicilian memories with fellow solo travelers in one of the best places to travel solo anywhere in the world.\n\n6. Portugal\n\nGorgeous beaches and countless architectural gems beloved by travelers from around the world, coupled with friendly locals and widely spoken English, make taking a Portugal tour one of the best solo trip ideas. On our Portugal for Solo Travelers tour, you can take in tranquil Douro River views in Porto, tour a cork factory in Évora, savor sea views from a fortress in the Algarve, and learn to make traditional Portuguese dishes during a cooking class in Lisbon. Experience it all in the company of fellow solo travelers looking to explore the land of blue tiles and delicious food. Chart your own course during your free time or enjoy one of our optional excursions—think tasting port wine in Porto, watching a fado show in Lisbon, or exploring Sintra’s spectacular Pena Palace. With so much to do, it’s easy to see why Portugal is regularly touted as one of the best places to travel solo.\n\n7. Greece\n\nGreece is one of the best places for solo trips in Europe thanks to its reliable public transportation, friendly locals, and plethora of places to take in history, food, and culture. On our Greek Islands for Solo Travelers: Crete & Santorini tour, solo travelers can experience several different sides of Greece. In Athens, a local guide will introduce you to the historic highlights of the bustling ancient capital, and you can spend a free afternoon museum-hopping or listening to live music at a modern cafe. After exploring the mainland, it’s time to island-hop, with stops on Crete and Santorini with your fellow solo travelers. Whether you marvel at the historic ruins and panoramic mountaintop views or settle into a local waterfront taverna for traditional Greek treats like chilled ouzo and grilled octopus, this Solo Tour is one you’ll never forget.\n\n8. Central Europe\n\nBonding with fellow travelers over giant steins of beer, pots of gooey fondue, and guided tours of charming medieval towns makes our Central Europe for Solo Travelers tour one of the best solo travel destinations. In addition to exploring jaw-dropping Alpine landscapes and important historical sites with fellow tour mates, solo travelers can strike out on their own, be it for a stroll through the cobblestone streets of Old Town Lucerne, a performance of Mozart’s music in Salzburg, or a night at the opera in Prague. You’ll also ride the Riesenrad, a giant Ferris Wheel, for a unique view of Vienna—named the most livable city in the world eight times in the last decade. We’re not saying you won’t want to come home, but we may have to remind you it’s a Solo Tour and not your new residence.\n\n9. Spain\n\nExplore a trio of famous Spanish cities with your fellow solo travelers as you get to know three distinct sides of this Iberian nation. Step inside the still-to-be-completed architectural masterpiece of Antoni Gaudí as you explore La Sagrada Família in Barcelona, the cosmopolitan city by the sea. Soak up the sun and dip your toes in the ocean, then marvel at the colorful creations in Park Güell as you immerse yourself in the lively atmosphere of the Catalonian capital. Our Spain for Solo Travelers: Barcelona, Madrid & Seville tour is just beginning as you board a train for the nation’s capital city of Madrid. Long, elegant boulevards stretch out before you as you take in the Spanish Royal Palace or stroll through one of the city’s several main squares before exploring the Prado, a world-class art museum that began as the private collection of the Spanish monarchy. See iconic works by Goya, Hieronymus Bosch, and Velásquez. Join a free day excursion to Toledo and soak in the splendor of the ancient, clifftop city. All tours of Spain need a little music, so head off to Seville, where you’ll experience the art and passion of flamenco during a live show. Dine on tapas and sip delicious wine as you say adios to your fellow solo travelers over one more incredible meal.\n\n10. Scotland\n\nIf you’ve been dreaming of highland grasses swaying in the breeze, the taste peaty Scotch on your lips, and the unmistakable sound of bagpipes floating through narrow alleys, you are going to love our Scotland for Solo Travelers: Highlands, Aberdeen & Edinburgh tour. Scotland is one of the best places for solo female travel due to the friendly locals and shared language, not to mention its incredible natural beauty. You’ll begin in Glasgow as you discover the medieval origins of the city and visit the castle where Mary, Queen of Scots was crowned. Continue to the Highlands with your fellow solo travelers and see if you can spot a “monsterous” figure in famous Loch Ness. Stop in Aberdeen for a tasting of Speyside Whisky and learn how coopers produce barrels for the aging process of this national treasure.\n\nYou’ll meet up with a farm guide and set off on a walking tour where you’ll learn about the famous Highland cows and the history of Scotland’s agricultural techniques. See the alma mater of royalty as you walk the grounds of St. Andrews University and enter the ruins of a medieval castle overlooking the North Sea. Any tour of Scotland wouldn’t be complete without bagpipes, so after walking the historic cobbled streets of Edinburgh, listen to a musician play a few songs before picking up your own bagpipes and learning how to play with your fellow solo travelers. Say goodbye to your new travel companions over a wonderful dinner or extend your stay for some additional time in Edinburgh to dive even deeper into the capital of this northern UK nation.\n\n11. England\n\nIf you’d like to indulge in a spot of afternoon tea, the latest gossip about the Royal Family, or your fantasies of visiting Bridgerton filming locations, a trip to England is an absolute must. See iconic landmarks like Big Ben and Tower Bridge while touring the English capital on our London tours. Between sightseeing, you can pop into a cozy pub for a pint or a classic bite, like fish and chips. One of the best solo travel ideas is to take yourself to tea, where you’ll enjoy cucumber finger sandwiches, scones with jam and clotted cream, and a warm cuppa (what the English call a cup of tea) with milk, of course.\n\nLondon is just one of the European capital cities you’ll visit on our London, Paris & Rome for Solo Travelers tour. After a few days of sightseeing iconic landmarks and soaking up centuries of English history and culture, you’ll depart London via the high-speed Eurostar train for Paris. Once settled in the City of Light, you’ll drive down the Champs-Élysées, round the Arc de Triomphe, and say hello to Notre-Dame. Grab a pastry—and maybe a glass of wine—and head for the sparkling lights of the Eiffel Tower or to the world famous Louvre museum. Lastly, you’ll hop a flight to Rome and admire the intricately carved Trevi Fountain. Get ready to make pasta by hand under the guidence of a local chef, and enjoy the fruits of your labor as you toast to an incredible journey with your fellow travelers.\n\n12. Bali\n\nIf you’re looking for a transformational trip to an iconic destination, look no further than our brand new Bali for Solo Travelers: Beaches, Temples & Culture tour, where you’ll have the opportunity to connect with new friends and reconnect with yourself. Get your fill of adventure by exploring awe-inspiring beaches and temples, and in turn fill your cup with morning yoga classes accompanied by a sound bath. You and your fellow solo travelers will delight in unique experiences of this Indonesian island, like visiting a monkey forest, witnessing a Hindu epic retold through a fire dance, and joining a traditional Balinese cooking class. If you’re a foodie, then adding the extension to Singapore will perfectly cap off your trip as you eat your way through night market food stalls to your heart’s content.\n\n13. Thailand\n\nWhen it comes to the best solo travel destinations, any of our Thailand tours are tough to beat. Thanks to the country’s diverse topography (misty mountains in the north, picturesque beaches in the south, bustling Bangkok in between), flavorful, inexpensive food, and famously friendly locals, it’s easily one of the best countries to travel alone. On our Thailand for Solo Travelers: Bangkok, Phuket & the Islands tour you can take in all the highlights—like staggering limestone cliffs, golden temples, and Thai cooking classes—in the company of fellow solo travelers and expert guides. Spend free time sampling Thailand’s famous street food, lounging on the beach, or soaking in urban scenery from the Maeklong Railway Market, where vendors regularly pack up their stalls so trains can pass on the active route.\n\n14. Japan\n\nGet to know Japanese culture, and your fellow travelers, on our Japan for Solo Travelers: Tokyo, Mt. Fuji & Kyoto tour. You’ll begin this incredible adventure in Tokyo, where ancient shrines stand next to modern skyscrapers. Visit the iconic Shibuya Crossing, the world’s largest intersection, and walk through Yoyogi Park, filled with lawns, ponds, and forested areas in the heart of the city. Tie on an apron with your fellow solo travelers as you try your hand at crafting an authentic Japanese meal under the tutelage of an experienced chef.\n\nLeave the big city behind as you step into the forest on your visit to the Mount Fuji area. The Narusawa Ice Cave you’ll hike through with your fellow solo travelers is as picturesque as the snow-capped peak that dominates the region. Board a bullet train and speed off to Kyoto, where you’ll walk through towering bamboo forests and sip a little sake before dining on a traditional hot pot meal. If you simply can’t say goodbye to Japan, extend your stay and explore Kobe and Hiroshima. Visit Peace Memorial Park and the “floating” gate of Miyajima Island in Hiroshima before returning by bullet train to Kobe—where the mouthwatering marbled beef is a must-try.\n\n15. Australia\n\nA globe-crossing trek can be intimidating for solo travelers, but the benefits are absolutely worth the journey. On our Australia for Solo Travelers: Melbourne, Queensland Coast & Sydney tour, you’ll explore the continent down under as you travel from major cities in the south to spectacular, reef-side towns in the north. Taste your way through Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne before enjoying a local wine country lunch with your fellow solo travelers. Board a flight to the north, where you’ll dip your toes into the sea next to the Great Barrier Reef, teeming with tropical fish and vibrantly colored coral. Meet up with a local guide who will walk you through an ancient Aboriginal ritual to cleanse visitors. Cruise along the waters of the Whitsunday Islands and see if you can spot all the impressive marine life—hello, manta rays! No Australian tour would be complete without visiting the domes of the Sydney Opera House or soaking up the sun at world-famous Bondi Beach. Australia is one of the best places to travel alone, so if you simply aren’t ready to depart, extend your solo journey in Tasmania, where you’ll visit historic markets and embark on an eco-cruise past sea caves and towering cliffs.\n\n16. Southwestern United States\n\nFew places satisfy an appetite for adventure better than national and state parks in the U.S. Several are located throughout the Southwest, which makes our U.S. National Parks for Solo Travelers: The Grand Canyon to Zion tour one of the best solo vacations for active travelers. While on tour, explore with your fellow solo travelers as you walk among otherworldly rock formations in Utah’s Bryce Canyon National Park and Zion National Park.\n\nAt Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, enjoy a group walk along the South Rim before spending free time hiking solo, or soaking in stunning views from a helicopter. In Nevada, mix things up with a tour of Valley of Fire State Park before taking a stroll down the famous Las Vegas Strip. Before heading home, spend free time taking in one of Sin City’s famously high-energy shows, or toasting your trip with a cocktail in one of the city’s stylish resort lounges to see why the southwest is one of the best places to travel solo.\n\n17. Peru\n\nFollow in the footsteps of forward-thinking Incas on our Peru for Solo Travelers: Lima, Cuzco & Machu Picchu tour. Walk through Plaza de Armas in the capital city of Lima and explore the emerging global gastronomy scene. Jump into history as you tour Cuzco with a local guide, passing the ruins of a cathedral once covered in gold and exploring markets filled with fresh fruits and artisan crafts. Dine on traditional Peruvian dishes with your fellow solo travelers as you discover the bounty of the ancient capital of the Inca Empire. Make your way to Aguas Calientes, the gateway to Machu Picchu, to get acclimated to the elevation and immerse yourself in the historic practices of the locals. Enjoy dinner with your group before setting off in the morning to one of the most spectacular archaeological sites in the world: Machu Picchu. This is a sparkling gem on all Peru tours, where the stepped terraces seem to float above the clouds. Say goodbye to one of the world’s best places to travel alone or extend your stay with a trip to the Amazon where you’ll explore the rainforest and visit indigenous villages.\n\n18. Costa Rica\n\nWe can’t think of many better ways to connect to a place—and other solo travelers—than by hiking through the rainforest and dipping your toes into the ocean on a golden beach. Sound like paradise? Then you’ll love our Costa Rica for Solo Travelers: Volcanoes, Jungles & Beaches tour, where you’ll journey through one of the best countries to travel solo—from the capital city to Pacific coast. Visit the largest open volcano in the world and peer into the massive crater before sitting down at a local coffee farm—the rich volcanic soil creates some of the best beans in the world. Walk through the cloud forest and keep an eye out for the bright bill of a toucan as you learn about the country’s deep commitment to wildlife preservation and protection.\n\nCruise along the Tárcoles River and spot crocodiles, iguanas, and monkeys as you maneuver through the mangroves deeper into the jungle. Emerge from the lush forest and travel along the scenic route to Guanacaste, known for its miles of unspoiled beaches perfect for surfing, sailing, or bathing in the sun. Toast to an incredible journey with fellow solo travelers or extend your Costa Rica tour with a visit to the country’s volcano region. Discover powerful waterfalls deep in the rainforest and marvel at a mile-high volcano as you search for sloths on a guided hike through Arenal Volcano National Park.\n\n19. Egypt\n\nEgypt is home to ancient pyramids and temples, world-class museums, and the legendary Nile River, just to name a few highlights, which is why tours of Egypt- sit atop many solo travelers’ wish lists. After all, what could be more thrilling than exploring Egypt’s archaeological treasures in the company of an esteemed Egyptologist, or sailing up the Nile on a boat as you pass Abu Simbel, Luxor, and the Valley of the Kings? Whether you spend the day exploring the bustling streets of Cairo with your fellow solo travelers or shopping for spices in a souk on your own, you can recap the day’s events over meals shared with your tour mates-turned-friends each evening on our Egypt & Nile River Cruise for Solo Travelers tour.\n\n20. Kenya\n\nAs a solo traveler, a safari could seem out of reach—but everyone should experience the majestic wildlife and vibrant culture of the African continent. Our Kenya Wildlife Safari for Solo Travelers is just one of the ways to visit solo travel destinations—like Africa—with us. Travel to Nairobi, Kenya, and set off in a 4x4 Jeep to learn about the conservation work being done to protect elephants and rare Rothschild giraffes. Then, make your way to Amboseli National Park and set off on a game drive with an expert guide as you search for baboons, rhinos, lions, cheetahs, and dozens more animals.\n\nStop at the equator on your way to the Great Rift Valley and arrive at Lake Naivasha, at nearly 6,200 feet above sea level. Set out on a boat tour and observe the mighty hippo in its natural habitat. Immerse yourself in the indigenous culture of the Maasai and join the tribe in their signature adamu, or jumping dance, as you visit a local homestead of this semi-nomadic people. Rise before the sun for a final game drive, where you’ll have one last attempt to spot the Big Five. Say farewell to your fellow solo travelers as you depart for home or extend your stay and get a taste of island life as you travel to Zanzibar. Experience the unique mix of cultural influences during a Swahili cooking class and observe local fisherman as they make their boats from scratch in Nungwi Village on the island’s northern tip.\n\n21. Morocco\n\nOur Morocco for Solo Travelers: Fes, the Sahara Desert & Marrakech tour is the perfect blend of historical architecture and varied landscapes. Traveling this North African nation joined by fellow solo travelers, the beauty and charm of this diverse country are yours to explore.

Attend a ceramics demonstration and learn about how the intricate and colorful art pieces at the center of Moroccan cooking are created.\n\nJourney over the Atlas Mountains and stop in Ifrane, known for its cedar forests and alpine-style architecture, before continuing to your camp in the Sahara Desert. Hop in a 4x4 Jeep and ride across the sand dunes to a Bedouin camp where you’ll sip mint tea with your fellow solo travelers. Drive deeper into the vast desert and spend the night under the stars in your tented camp. Cross back over the mountains to arrive in Marrakech and walk through the city’s vibrant souks and thriving medina.
