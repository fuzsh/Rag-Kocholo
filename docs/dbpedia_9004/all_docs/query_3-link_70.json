        "text": "Welcome to the Solo Female Travelers Safety Index, the first and most complete resource for women who travel solo to find safety information by country or destination.\n\nWhen we conducted our first Solo Female Travel Survey, one of the most relevant take-aways was that women who travel solo unanimously worry about their personal safety. The best countries for first time solo female travelers all have safety in common.\n\nBut travel safety is a complex topic with many facets.\n\nSolo female travelers need to understand the real safety risk and the kind of risk of a destination, and then prepare themselves by following our safety tips. This safety index provides:\n\nHow the Solo Female Travel Safety Index works\n\nThe Index is made of the average of 7 variables that come from publicly available, official data sources or from the first-hand experiences of other solo female travelers. Below is a list of the variables.\n\nAttitudes towards women is a variable that aims to capture the female experience. Perceptions towards women, gender equality, how conservative a country is towards its women, the restrictions placed on women, the need to cover face or hair or other restrictions on physical appearance, the incidence of crime against women, etc. are all included in this variable.\n\nYou can use the below table to sort countries according to how safe they are by each of the 7 variables. The lower the number the safer the country. Where no data was available, we have displayed ” – “. Our 8th column is an average score, ranking how safe the country is by averaging all 7 variables.\n\nAre you a solo female traveler?
