        "text": "Roger Daltrey has announced a North American solo tour for this June. Building on a previously announced May 6 engagement at San Diego, this run will bring the legendary frontman for The Who to nine further engagements in the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest and Canada between June 12 – 29. With support from an electric and acoustic band, Daltrey’s appearances have been hand-picked for intimate presentations of his classics and rarities, interspersed with live audience talk-back.\n\nDaltrey’s summer run will begin with his only West Coast show of the year on May 6, which will present the artist onstage at The Rady Shell at Jacobs Park in San Diego a month before the official outset of his new tour. By June 12, Daltrey will fly to the Southeast to perform at Vienna, Va.’s vaunted Wolf Trap – Filene Center, followed by a trip across the northern border to Niagra Falls, Ontario for a June 14 set at OLG Stage at Fallsview Casino. Next, the artist will move on to the Northeast for a four-show sprint, highlighted by a June 18 engagement at The Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY and a June 20 presentation at Boston’s Leader Band Pavilion. Finally, on June 25, Daltrey will take Detroit for the first in a final three-night Midwest run, culminating with a June 29 performance at Highland Park, Ill.’s The Pavilion at Ravinia.\n\nDaltrey’s performance will feature support from a nine-piece ensemble assembled by the icon, composed of Simon Townshend and Doug Boyle on guitar, Billy Nicholls on mandolin, John Hogg on bass, Katie Jacoby on violin, Geraint Watkins on keyboard and accordion, Steve Weston on harmonica and drummer Scott Devours, with additional percussion from Jody Linscott. These performances will also feature support from special guest singer-songwriters KT Tunstall and Dan Bern. Between songs, the bandleader will share stories from his six decades of performance and answer questions posed by the audience.\n\nA Live Nation presale for Daltrey’s exclusive summer series will open on Thursday, March 21 at 10 a.m. local time with code KEY. General on-sale will follow on Friday at 10 a.m. local time. For more information, visit thewho.com/tour.\n\nRead on for the complete list of Daltrey’s solo tour dates"
