        "text": "Types of Girl about the Globe (GatG) – Adventure GatG, Cultural GatG, Nature GatG, History GatG\n\nCentral America is a fascinating continent to explore. It's a destination full of adventure, nature, history and culture and I feel really blessed to have spent a few months on several occasions travelling to nearly every country of this region (except El Salvador).\n\nIn this article, I cover the best places to visit in Central America if you're travelling solo, with a brief description of each country, budget, safety and how to travel around.\n\nIf you are unsure how to travel within Central America or which country to travel to, read the full Central America travel guide below or just go to the section that you need. You'll find the full individual country guides in the related posts section.\n\nSolo Travel in Central America\n\nSolo Female Friendly Star Rating – 3 out of 5\n\nBudget – $30 – $70 a day\n\nCheapest – Nicaragua\n\nMost expensive – Panama and Costa Rica\n\nDid you know? That the term gringo is used for English-speaking foreigners, so don’t be surprised if you’re referred to as a gringa (for females).\n\nLanguage Spoken in Central America – Central America is mainly Spanish speaking except for Belize which is the only English-speaking country in the whole of Latin America.\n\nCreole is also spoken on the Caribbean coast. Panama and Costa Rica are the most international countries due to the amount of expats living there, meaning that English is spoken in some of the tourist areas.\n\nSpanish speaking countries – Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama.\n\nEnglish speaking countries – Belize.\n\nIf you're planning on travelling to Central America, below is a summary of each country to help you choose the right destination for you. Click on the images at the end for the solo destination guides.\n\nWhy Visit Central America?\n\nCentral America is made up of: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. I’ve also included Mexico within this region, as it is easy to add on to a Central America itinerary if you are travelling overland.\n\nCentral America solo travel has it all; Mayan temples and Aztec ruins, great nightlife, crystal waters, the world’s second-longest reef, active volcanos and lush vegetation, not to mention big cats and an abundance of wildlife.\n\nIts history dates back thousands of years, and evidence of the Maya civilisation can be found in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and Honduras. But if indigenous tribes and barely trodden rainforests are more your thing, then this continent will not disappoint.\n\nWith 10% of the world’s biodiversity, Central America has one of the richest ecosystems on Earth, with hundreds of species of plants and birds. You can trek among a mystical cloud forest, climb one of the many volcanoes, enjoy some of the best surfing in the world or just simply relax on the white-sand Caribbean beaches.\n\nSail through the Panama Canal or visit Big Corn island off the coast of Nicaragua – the largest country in Central America. With zip canopies, jungle lodges and adventure sports, Central America is one big adventure.\n\nSolo Travel in Central America\n\nThe region isn’t known for its safety, so you do need to exercise some caution here, but you won’t be singled out because you’re a solo female.\n\nThe safest countries here are Panama and Nicaragua, and the ones to be careful in are Honduras and Guatemala. However, the cities do have a reputation for crime, especially Guatemala City, Belize City, and San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa in Honduras.\n\nThe main bus station in San Pedro Sula has armed security guards and is safe inside; just don’t go wandering around the streets by yourself and especially not to cashpoints (ATMs).\n\nYou can pretty much wear what you want within this continent, especially in Costa Rica and Panama. The worst you’ll hear is men shouting “linda” (meaning beautiful). Don’t take valuables with you on the beach if you’re alone, and be careful of your belongings on public transport. Travel during the day instead of at night.\n\nDon’t have your valuables on display, especially in Costa Rica, where muggings can occur. Just use your common sense and be careful at night. If you research your trip and stick to the tourist areas, you should be fine. Every country is different, but if you can speak a few phrases of Spanish, it will really help when you’re solo.\n\nSafest Central American Countries for Solos\n\nIf you are planning to solo travel Central America, the region doesn't have the best reputation for safety, especially in some of the capital cities. Below is my solo travel rating for each country (out of 5 stars for ease of travelling around and safety. 5 is the highest)\n\nSafest countries – Panama, Costa Rica\n\nMost dangerous – Honduras\n\nBelize – 3 stars\n\nCosta Rica – 3 star\n\nEl Salvador – 3 stars\n\nGuatemala – 2 stars\n\nHonduras – 2 stars\n\nNicaragua – 3 star\n\nPanama – 4 stars\n\nBudget For Central America\n\nThese budgets are based on daily spending, including accommodation (staying in a dormitory room in a hostel), food, water, transport (using local transport only), and leisure. You will need to add an additional cost if you prefer to stay in a private room.\n\nThe most expensive countries here are Costa Rica and Panama. The cheapest countries are Nicaragua and Guatemala. Depending on where you go in the region, budget from £40 ($50) to £75 ($92) a day.\n\nBelize – £55 / $80\n\nCosta Rica – £75 / $92\n\nEl Salvador – £55 / $80\n\nGuatemala – £45 / $55\n\nHonduras – £45 / $55\n\nNicaragua – £40 / $50\n\nPanama – £70 / $86\n\nTravelling Around Central America\n\nIf you’re travelling through countries in Latin America, overlanding is the cheapest and best option. As there isn’t a proper train system here, taking a bus is the only way to get across the land.\n\nChicken buses are prominent in Latin America, so expect to be sitting with livestock (even though it’s not permitted to take chickens on the buses anymore, some locals still smuggle them on). They’re really unique, and you’ll find sellers coming onto the buses offering food and drink for sale.\n\nCoach travel is the free-spirited backpacker’s favourite but you’ll usually find local buses are old, slow and packed with people, although these problems are offset by the low cost. The coaches running between major cities are a better option and tend to be cleaner and newer, and long-distance journey’s, such as from Mexico to Panama, are available.\n\nPrivate shuttles between major cities are becoming are more common option but are usually operated through tourist agencies or via hotels, which can be expensive. Flying might actually be less expensive.\n\nIn less-developed countries, not only do the roads not have the same infrastructure as you may be used to (hence a bumpy ride), but bus timetables don’t hold the same importance.\n\nMake allowances for this when you need to get somewhere fast. Giving yourself enough time to miss one is a good tip, especially because buses can sometimes be a free-for-all as locals shove their way on, and you could find yourself waiting for the next bus (this often happens in Belize). But you can be guaranteed that your bus journey will be accompanied by the driver’s favourite music, whether reggae or 80s love songs.\n\nCentral America is a fairly compact region, but in certain places, the roads can be atrocious, and bus travel can take what seems like an eternity to reach one country from another. Car hire is an option and thousands of tourists do use this method, but travelling across borders in a rental car isn’t permitted.\n\nOne available option is to drive to the border where your hire company representative will be waiting to meet you, then you need simply walk across the border and your rep will provide you with your new rental car.\n\nYou don’t have to go overland either, as some borders here can be crossed by sea: Mexico to Belize, Belize to Honduras, Panama to Colombia and vice versa. The seas can get a bit rough, so if a three-day sailing trip through the San Blas Islands from Panama to Colombia makes you feel a bit seasick, you can take the smoother option of a speedboat instead or just a leisurely ride along the Panama Canal.\n\nTraveling around this beautiful part of the world is definitely an adventure, especially if you have plenty of free time. But make sure to thoroughly check your transport options before departing and booking well in advance, especially if you're travelling during peak times.\n\nIf you’re feeling a bit hesitant about travelling around Central America by yourself, then consider a tour. Not only can this help you plan your route, but you can avoid the stress of local transport and meet others too. Below is a brief summary of each country and how to get around.\n\nCentral America Tours\n\nExplore – Tours for 40+ year-olds to Belize, Guatemala, Honduras & more\n\nG Adventures – Group tours throughout Central America for all ages\n\nGreen World Adventures – Personalised sustainable tours to Costa Rica\n\nTruTravels – Costa Rica tours & multi-country trips in Central America\n\nSolo Travel Mexico\n\nMexico does have its issues, but if you don’t venture north of Mexico City or into certain neighbourhoods known for drug cartels, the rest of the country is amazing and easy to travel around.\n\nMany mature travellers come here – except during Spring Break on the Riviera Maya – where you’ll be sharing Cancun with college students. Because of its proximity to the United States, the country is also popular with Americans.\n\nIn Mexico City, La Condesa and Regina are the nicest and safest areas in Mexico City. They have an outdoor dining and coffee culture, and you can walk around feeling safe.\n\nExplore the many museums of Mexico City, then journey east to Chichen Itza, Mexico’s most famous Mayan temple. If you love nightlife, Cancun and the Riviera Maya will not disappoint. There is also an abundance of cenotes (sinkholes) and beautiful beaches to see.\n\nMexico has a great bus network, with large reclining seats and air conditioning. If you are limited in time, look at Viva Aerobus, Mexico’s low-cost airline, which flies throughout Mexico and can save you hours on a bus. * Related Post: Solo Travel in Mexico\n\nBelize Solo Travel\n\nBelize is the only English-speaking country on the continent, and this former British colony is brimming with diversity. Head to the cays for Caribbean islands and the Great Blue Hole, or inland for the jungle, big cats and Central America’s largest cave system.\n\nBelize is a relatively safe country. It has a Caribbean feel and is so multicultural that you’ll find Rastas, Indians and Chinese among the African descendants. There is a gang culture in Belize City, so steer clear of Southside and head to the rest of the mainland or the cays, which are perfectly safe.\n\nBuses aren’t the only way to get around in Belize, as there are water taxis which take you from Belize City to the cays. Tropic Air operates internal flights around the country, and you’ll find tiny airstrips everywhere for their 12-seater planes. * Read: Solo Travel in Belize\n\nSolo Travel To Costa Rica\n\nNo other country does eco-tourism, as well as Costa Rica. This biodiverse country is teeming with tropical birds, waterfalls and lush vegetation, making it one of the most popular destinations on the continent. But, although it has some beautiful landscapes, some of the bus stations can be sketchy, so be careful at night and in the capital, San Jose.\n\nGetting around Costa Rica is via public buses, shared shuttle services and 4×4 jeeps. The bus routes aren’t very extensive, and you may find yourself having to backtrack to visit each corner of the country. Ferries operate from Puntarenas to Paquera and Naranjo. If you are travelling across the land border to Nicaragua or Panama, taking an early bus is recommended. * Read: Post: Solo Travel in Costa Rica\n\nSolo Travel El Salvador\n\nEl Salvador is the smallest country and its remnants of a past civil war make it an interesting country. It is also known to have the best surf in the continent, but with so much conflict and the risk of being robbed, check the situation before you travel there.\n\nGuatemala Solo Travel\n\nGuatemala has a lot to offer and is home to active volcanoes and the jungle Mayan temples of Tikal. Take a trip back in time to the World Heritage Site of Antigua, meander around the colourful town of Flores or explore Lake Atitlan, one of Guatemala’s many lakes.\n\nIf you can avoid Guatemala City, then do, as there are other regions in the country which are safer and also much nicer. Public buses operate in Guatemala, or you can choose tourist buses, which drop you off at your chosen hotel. There is also an overnight bus to Flores. * Read Solo Travel in Guatemala\n\nHonduras Solo Travel\n\nHonduras, on the other hand, isn’t that great for solo females. There is a high level of crime, and you need to be comfortable with armed security guards, whose presence is felt in tourist areas. Honduras is a macho society, so you may receive unwanted attention.\n\nTake a taxi if travelling at night and be really careful in the cities, which are known for their dangerous areas. If you are backpacking in Honduras and don’t want to be the only traveller within local towns, head to the friendly Bay of Islands or Roatan for the comfort of other travellers and friendlier locals.\n\nAlthough Honduras is also sketchy, you’ll find many solos that come for the diving. Head to Utila for a hedonistic island where you can party and dive for all hours.\n\nIf it’s culture that you need, Copan has the country’s Mayan ruins, but you may prefer to see the ruins in Belize or Mexico instead, where you’ll feel more comfortable. Honduras does require extra vigilance, so it is wise to team up with others or take a tour for this country.\n\nExpress buses operate between the two major cities in Honduras, but if time is an issue, consider internal flights instead.\n\nIf you’re travelling to the Bay of Islands, there are ferry routes from the mainland and between the two islands.\n\nConsider paying extra for the speedboat instead of a traditional fishing boat if you get seasick. The ferry from La Ceiba to Roatan is a roller, and they give you a seasickness tablet when you buy your ticket. You can buy drinks and snacks onboard. * Read: Solo Travel in Honduras\n\nNicaragua Solo Travel\n\nThere are so many places to see in Nicaragua that you could easily spend two weeks here just scratching the surface. Volcanoes, lakes and Spanish colonial cities are some of its charm. Add volcano boarding to the mix, and you have a country that is not only cheap but is ideal for the nature and adventurous solos.\n\nManagua, the capital, has the least to do, so head for the coffee region of Matagalpa for coffee farms and river rafting, visit Leon for a stunning white cathedral and volcano boarding, or swim in a volcanic crater lake at Laguna de Apoyo.\n\nDo expect some attention here though, especially in Leon, where young boys will make it clear that they want your attention. If you are comfortable with cat calls, then you won’t have a problem in this country.\n\nThe best way to travel around Nicaragua is by bus. Minibuses here tend to leave when they are full, so don’t expect to hop in one and just go. The road infrastructure is okay in the west of the country, but other roads may not be what you’re used to.\n\nIf you are planning on adding Caribbean islands to your itinerary, local flights operate from the mainland to Big Corn Island – called La Costena – or you can take the rocky boat ride from Bluefields which leaves once a week and takes 6 hours. From Big Corn, you can take a boat to Nicaragua’s smallest island: Little Corn.\n\nSolo Travel Panama\n\nPanama is the furthest country south in Central America and connects to the continent of South America. Panama is a relatively safe country for solo female travellers.\n\nThere are areas that you need to take care of, but on the whole, it is safe. Panama City has the most amazing skyline, and the promenade at night is safe for females with many families, runners and cyclists.\n\nOver a third of its land is protected, and the country is great for bird spotting with hundreds of different species, including the colourful toucan in Soberania National Park. Take a jungle walk through remote wilderness at Cerro Pirre or if time is on your hands, trek the Camino Real. If you love the ocean, dive at Isla Coiba, one of the largest coral reefs on the Pacific Coast.\n\nPanama is the country for adventure: sail across treetops on a forest zip wire or try rafting through the many grades of rapids. And when you’re adventuring out, enjoy the nightlife at Santa Catalina or the islands of Bocas del Toro, a popular surfing destination with a Naso Indian village to explore.\n\nThen relax on the San Blas Islands, white sand Caribbean islands and learn the culture of the Kuna people: a huge contrast to the skyscrapers of Panama City.\n\nPanama is quite well connected, and the easiest way to get around Panama is by bus. The country has a good bus system, but you may need to change to a hub such as David. The buses are also known for having very cold air conditioning, so take a fleece if you are travelling at night.\n\nFerries take you from David to Mirander if you are going to Bocas del Toro, or you can take a tour to San Blas.\n\nIf I've inspired you to travel solo in Central America, click on the photos below for the solo destination guide for your chosen country. * Read: Solo Travel in Panama\n\nBest Time To Visit Central America\n\nIf you’re wondering the best time to travel to Central America, they do have a rainy season between May to September/October, and the hurricane season can affect Belize and Honduras during the months of October and November.\n\nBut with the climate constantly changing, just research the weather in the country that you want to travel to before you book. Below is the best time to visit each country. Weather2Travel is also a great site to check the best time of year for each destination.\n\nBelize – February to April.\n\nCosta Rica – December to April.\n\nEl Salvador – November to April.\n\nGuatemala – October to April.\n\nHonduras – December to April.\n\nMexico – All year round.\n\nNicaragua – November to May.\n\nPanama – December to April.\n\nCentral America Tours\n\nIf you are planning on backpacking Central America but don’t feel very confident with basic Spanish, then consider taking one of these Central America tours. Both G Adventures and Intrepid Travel are sustainable travel companies and have their own foundations.\n\nG Adventures\n\nIf you feel more comfortable in a group for either part of your trip or the whole duration, G Adventures is a responsible tour company that mainly caters for budget travellers. Most tours have an average of 10 people, and there is no upper age limit. Once you book your trip, you pay extra for any excursions you want to do when you’re there.\n\nAdventures range from 9 days exploring Belize to an epic 33 day Best of Central America: Ruins & Remote Beaches trip travelling through Honduras, Mexico, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Belize, and Nicaragua. Explore Costa Rica in two weeks, or take the Mayan Sun Southbound or Northbound over 16 days covering Mexico, Guatemala and Belize.\n\nThey also have specific adventures for under forties. If you're aged 18 to 39, join the Volcano Trail: Waves and Local Ways, for 17 days and travel from Antigua, Guatemala to San José, with a group of like-minded travellers. I have personally used G Adventures and recommend them as a solo female friendly company.\n\n* Click here for all itineraries, prices, and start dates\n\nIntrepid Travel\n\nIntrepid Travel is similar to G Adventures with an average of 12 people on each tour. Over 50% of people who book their trips are solo travellers. They tend to use hotels instead of hostels and have a more comfortable style of accommodation hence the trips can appear a bit more than G Adventures.\n\nTheir tours range from an 8 day Guatemala Expedition on the Carmelita El Mirador jungle trek (for the adventure GatG) to an epic 47 day Central America Explorer of the land of toucans, tacos and tamales, journeying through Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.\n\nIf you only have a week to spare, you could cycle your way through the countries on an 8 day cycle adventure through Nicaragua and Costa Rica, or Costa Rica and Panama.\n\nWith both tour companies, you share a room with someone of the same gender, or you can pay extra for your own room.\n\n* Click here for the full itineraries, prices, and start dates\n\nBest Things To Do in Central America\n\nExplore Tikal, Guatemala\n\nStay with a Mayan family in San Jose, Belize\n\nVolcano boarding at Cerro Negro, Nicaragua\n\nExplore the colonial town of Antigua, Guatemala\n\nSee the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras\n\nEnjoy the peace at Lake Atitlan, Guatemala\n\nGo underground at the ATM cave, Belize\n\nGet dive-certified in Utila, Honduras\n\nMarvel at Isla de Ometepe, Nicaragua\n\nSightsee in Leon, Nicaragua\n\nTake a short cruise along the Panama Canal.\n\nSeven Wonders of the World\n\nParicutin Volcano in Mexico\n\nChichen Itza in Mexico.\n\nCentral America Itineraries\n\nYou could easily spend a month or more exploring this continent.
