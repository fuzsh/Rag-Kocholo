But, speaking from my personal experiences, the following activities or things to do are things I can 100% recommend to most solo travellers backpacking in the Philippines.\n\n1. Make New Friends\n\nThe Philippines is such a great country to visit as a solo traveller. Backpacking Southeast Asia is great, whatever country you go to. There are tons of travellers everywhere you go (many of them solo), and meeting like-minded and friendly people is super easy… Even for introverts like me.\n\nWhether you have just arrived in Manila, or you are relaxing on a remote beach in while staying in Siquijor, you will find people from all sorts of countries who are on a solo mission and want to make friends, just like you.\n\nFilipinos are especially friendly and welcoming. They also speak fabulous English and making friends with locals in this country is a walk in the park. Grab a couple of San Miguels, offer one to a local, and have a good ol’ natter. What’s the worst that could happen?\n\n2. Go Island Hopping\n\nAs the Philippines is made up of over 7,000 islands, what better way to explore a few of them than to go on an island hopping tour? Island hopping tours in this country are excellent. Activities as part of the tours range from snorkelling or fishing all the way to boozing and partying.\n\nIsland hopping tours are incredible for solo travellers. Mainly because it’s a boozy affair and a bit of alcohol is a superb social lubricant and provides timid solo travellers like me with a bit of Dutch courage to approach people and start conversations.\n\nIsland hopping tours from El Nido, Coron, Boracay, and Siargao are all great. If possible, arrange with a hostel buddy to go on one together or join a full tour to improve your chances of finding cool people on the tours.\n\n3. Surf!\n\nThe Philippines probably isn’t the first place that pops into your head when someone says surfing. But let me tell you mate, there are some world-class waves to be discovered here.\n\nThe surfing capital of the Philippines is Siargao – my favourite island out of the lot! It is absolute heaven for any type of surfer.\n\nThe famous Cloud 9 surf break has the potential to unleash massive barreling waves over a stunning reef and is of such high quality it has hosted WSL (World Surf League) events. If you’re a beginner, never fear, there are a bunch of beginner reaks around the island including Secret Spot and Jacking Horse.\n\nSome of the best friends I made in the Philippines were people I met out in the surf, bonding over a common hobby is so easy. Surfing with an instructor or solo is always fun too though!\n\n4. Go Canyoneering\n\nCanyoneering at Kawasan Falls on Cebu Island is an adrenaline-filled adventure that will live on in your memory.\n\nSending it off big jumps, slippery rocks, and rope swings into enchanting aquamarine water is certainly exhilarating. This is my idea of fun anyway, and not a single person on my tour didn’t have an epic time.\n\nThe Philippines is full of jungles, waterfalls, and hidden gems for you to explore and find your own spots to go cliff jumping and canyoneering. But to be honest, joining an organised tour such as the one to Kawasan Falls is probably the best, safest, and most fun option.\n\n5. Scuba Dive, Freedive or Snorkel\n\nThe Philippines has some of the best snorkelling, scuba diving and freediving in the world; it’s also one of the cheapest places in the world to dive.\n\nCertain spots such as Moalboal, home to the Sardine Run are otherworldly. Wherever you are in the Philippines, getting in the ocean is a great idea. Scuba courses and fun dive tours are a great way to make friends and snorkel tours can be great for this too.\n\n6. Relax at One of the Thousands of Beaches\n\nWith over 7,000 amazing islands in the Philippines, only god knows how many beaches there are in this place. Rent a moped or book a driver and go explore!\n\nThere are a bunch of popular beaches but there are some seriously golden secret spots in this country. Get Google Maps out, speak to locals, or go off on your own and see what you can find.\n\n7. Take a Cooking Class\n\nFilipino food isn’t the best in the world, I’ll be the first to admit that. But, taking a cooking class in Manila is a great way to socialise as a solo traveller and learn a lot about Filipino traditions, culture, and cuisine.\n\nWherever I travel, I love to take cooking classes. It’s fun to do alone, but also is a great way to meet others who also have a passion for food.\n\n8. Visit a Volcano!\n\nThe Philippines is home to around 300 volcanoes and about 24 of them are active. Hiking volcanoes is such a powerful thing to do and it really fits with the personal development and deep sense of adventure that many solo travellers are seeking to embrace.\n\nGoing to Taal is one fantastic sight and makes for a memorable adventure. Other cool hikes include trekking Mount Pulag, Mount Arayat, Mount Hibok-Hiok and Mayon Volcano.\n\nThe 5 Best Solo Destinations in the Philippines\n\n“Ok, but if there are over 7,000 islands, where the hell should I go?” I can hear you already…\n\nI’ve compiled a list of the best locations for solo travellers in the Philippines, based on my personal experiences and stories from backpackers I’ve met on the road…\n\n1. Siargao\n\nSiargao is one of the best places to visit in the world. Is that excessive? No, I really think it is.\n\nNow I will admit, I only left Siargao a couple of weeks ago, so this recommendation may contain some recency bias. But, there is no denying that it’s a magical place for any type of backpacker.\n\nWhat makes Siargao solo travel so fantastic is the sense of community. There are so many amazing hostels in Siargao and the backpacking scene is seriously thriving.\n\nMy favourite hostel has to be Sinag Hostel though. The friendliness of the staff is just unmatched and it’s very affordable.\n\nSiargao is a great place for backpackers looking to do things like chill on beaches, surf, party, and just rent mopeds and explore the stunning island. Siargao is island life defined.\n\n2. El Nido\n\nEl Nido on the island of Palawan is one of the most popular backpacking locations in the Philippines, and you know what that means… There are TONS of other solo travellers.\n\nEl Nido is most well known for its simply magical white sand beaches and stunning coral reefs bustling with marine life. It’s one of the best places in the Philippines to join in on island hopping tours.\n\nThe only thing about El Nido is that the entire island of Palawan is slightly more expensive than the rest of the country… but it’s like this for a reason. It’s one of the best places!\n\nThe most popular hostel for solo travellers looking to socialise in El Nido is definitely Mad Monkey Nacpan Beach.\n\nIf you don’t know how Mad Monkeys work, they are kinda party hostels that encourage social interaction (and drinking). They host a bunch of activities for people to get to know each other and have fun.\n\n3. Manila\n\nI hate cities. I loved Manila.\n\nWell, I didn’t love Manila, but I did love my stay in the city. Why? Because of the people I met!\n\nManila is such a hub of backpacker activity in the Philippines due to the volume of people flying into, out of, and around the Philippines. (So is Cebu City to be fair, so that can be our imaginary number 4.5.)\n\nBecause of the guaranteed activity in the city, backpackers flood the hostels to make contacts, connections, and plans for their onward journeys.\n\nDuring one visit I did end up in an Airbnb in Pasay and I have to say it was probably my favourite area in Metro Manila to base myself.\n\nIt was in Manila that I met some friends that I ended up travelling with to other islands, who had also just begun their solo trips in the Philippines.\n\nI stayed in Ola Hostel and loved it here, so I can defo recommend it to other solo travellers. They have fun games like beer pong and darts. They also have a nice rooftop bar which comes alive at 6 pm and is great for people looking to get their laptops out and do some admin during the day.\n\nIf you’re looking for a short break from the city, then check out the Airbnbs in Tagaytay instead.\n\n4. Siquijor\n\nSiquijor may be small, but boy oh boy is it mighty. This little island is incredible and is close to Cebu. It’s a dream destination for many (myself included) boasting amazing waterfalls, beaches and lush jungles.\n\nSiquijor is the perfect destination for solo travellers who are seeking the perfect blend of seclusion and action. The atmosphere is sublime.\n\nThe local people in Siquijor are largely responsible for this atmosphere. – they’re legends. They welcome foreigners as their own and I made some real connections with many of the locals I met here.\n\nSiquijor is so small that it makes for the perfect location for solo travellers to go off, explore, and soul search. All without any risk of wandering too far from the nest or getting into any real danger.\n\nThere are a bunch of great hostels in Siquijor, but your nest of choice should probably be Fable Hostel. This place is the perfect base for any type of traveller and is also great for solo female travellers in the Philippines as they have female-only dorm rooms.\n\n5. Moalboal\n\nMoalboal is a cute little beach town on the island of Cebu. It is famous for many things including its extremely unique marine life (notably the sardine run). Here, thousands of sardines can be reliably seen all over the coastline shoaling in spectacular fashion.\n\nMoalboal has a lovely soul to it and is a cheap place to visit. Solo travellers have plenty of cool activities awaiting them, including easy access to canyoneering at Kawasan Falls and island hopping tours.\n\nHead over to Chilli Bar for a wild night out and to party with all your new friends. But just before that, get yourself over to MOHO hostel. They have free drinks between 8-8:30 pm and have all sorts of fun and games going on such as beer pong and quiz nights.\n\nThe atmosphere is perfect for solo travellers and the owner Roy is hilarious. I love you, Roy.\n\nThe Best Travel Apps for Solo Travel in the Philippines\n\nHaving these terrific travel apps in your arsenal will give you superpowers. Trust me.\n\nGoogle Maps – Do I need to explain this one?\n\nBooking.com – Easily the best app for accommodation.\n\nHostelworld – A great alternative to Booking.com for finding the best hostels in the Philippines.\n\nGoogle Translate – Such an easy way to speak every language.\n\nGrab – Grab is the Uber of Southeast Asia. Use Grab to book cheap and reliable rides from A to B.\n\nFoodpanda – Great for lazy takeaway days, especially in the big cities.\n\nTinder – Dating apps like Hinge, Bumble or Tinder aren’t just for hook-ups! You can make and meet friends on these things too.\n\nGetYourGuide – Book tours and meet other travellers.\n\nMaps.me – The Philippines is notorious for dodgy wifi, download some maps offline – trust me.\n\nHolafly – An e-SIM application that allows you to download an unlimited plan for your trip without installing a physical card.\n\nAirbnb – A great place to find a homestay with a local family, I particularly loved the Airbnb in Baguio I stayed in for this exact reason.\n\nFacebook groups are also a great shout for solo backpackers, and so is the Hostelworld chat for your location. My best tip though? Get off yo’ phone and go chat to people!\n\nSafety Tips for Solo Travelers in the Philippines\n\nStaying safe in the Philippines is relatively straightforward. As with most places, exercising common sense can take you very far. HOWEVER, there are bad people all over the world, so you shouldn’t be naive to the possibilities of danger.\n\nSolo female travellers should be especially careful, as usual, but not paranoid. I met lots of solo female travellers here and besides the odd motorbike crash or catcall, nothing else negative happened to them.\n\nThe US Travel Advisory suggests you exercise increased caution when visiting the Philippines. Whilst I believe this to be accurate for some locations such as the not so well travelled islands, it’s overdoing it for most places.\n\nPlaces with a thriving backpacker scene are generally very safe. Filipinos are honourable, honest and hospitable people – you would be extremely unlucky to be a victim of any sort.\n\nIf you do end up heading to Mindanao, be sure to be careful as the situation can be a little up and down, but the Airbnbs in Cagayan de Oro provide a safe and secure base and a connection to the locals. There are also some great Davao City Airbnb’s too.\n\nTips for Solo Travelling in the Philippines\n\nIf this is your first big solo trip, don’t worry, these tips will help you have a killer time in the Philippines and could also save your ass.\n\nTravel light and pick a trusty backpack over a rolling suitcase.\n\nBook hostels. It’s the BEST way to travel solo. You’ll meet awesome people and they’re often nicer than hotels.\n\nIf you’re travelling on a tight budget, you can get cheap transport tickets if you book in advance.\n\nDon’t just visit cities… please. Countries are more than just their tourist hotspots and Instagram-famous locations.\n\nThat being said… Still do the touristy things… there is a reason they’re popular.\n\nLeave your heels at home. Good travel shoes are essential.\n\nBook Tours – It’s one of the best ways to experience a country. Plus, it’s a great way to meet others travelling solo.\n\nGet travel insurance for the Philippines. You never know what can happen, and we want you safe, not hundreds of dollars in debt and unable to get home safely.\n\nMy final tip would be to just go for it and also to go with the flow. Nothing ever unfolds exactly how you imagined it, but this is the beauty of travel. We love the mystery of surprises, don’t we?\n\nALWAYS sort out your backpacker insurance before your trip. There’s plenty to choose from in that department, but a good place to start is Safety Wing.\n\nThey offer month-to-month payments, no lock-in contracts, and require absolutely no itineraries: that’s the exact kind of insurance long-term travellers and digital nomads need.\n\nSafetyWing is cheap, easy, and admin-free: just sign up lickety-split so you can get back to it!\n\nClick the button below to learn more about SafetyWing’s setup or read our insider review for the full tasty scoop.\n\nFinal Words for Your Solo Philippines Trip\n\nI hope this guide has equipped you with the knowledge, confidence and inspiration to embark on a solo adventure in the Philippines. If you made it this far, I know you’re reaaaally thinking about it, so you should defo just go!\n\nIf I could recommend one place to anyone it would have to be Siargao Island. I just fell in love with the place. It’s got such a friendly community feel to it and I never once felt alone here – despite arriving solo. Actually, I did take myself off on a few solo nature adventures, but you get the point.\n\nAnother place which is perfectly suited to every type of solo traveller is the island of Palawan. Check out popular spots like Coron, El Nido and Part Barton for some of the backpacking crowds and the best activities in the country.\n\nOk, folks. All that’s left to do is stop making excuses, book your ticket, pack your bag, and go to the Philippines. Good luck, you’ve got this."
