        "text": "Meatloaf is on tap on Saturday, Aug. 10, in the Aria Ballroom at MGM Springfield.\n\nThey won’t be serving up the popular comfort food, but two hours of music in a show called “Celebrating Meat Loaf,” honoring the late legendary Meat Loaf performed by The Neverland Express. The group, hailing from Meat Loaf’s original band, features American Idol winner Caleb Johnson who will be putting his own unique stamp on such classics as “Bat Out of Hell,” “Paradise by the Dashboard Light” and “I Would Do Anything for Love,” while staying true to the essence of Meat Loaf’s delivery."
