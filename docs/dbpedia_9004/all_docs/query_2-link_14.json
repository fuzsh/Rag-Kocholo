        "text": "Hello.\n\nI am already a solo artist on Spotify, and I want to participate in a brand new band project with two other solo artists, where each release is credited to both the band name and the respective musicians (who also happen to be members of the band). This way, the listener can click on any of those names and be redirected to the correct artist profile (alongside each artist's back catalogue).\n\nTo clarify my point, I would like to do exactly what the band Silk Sonic (composed of soloists Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak) did for their new songs, where the three names are displayed on their releases (I will attach a picture to illustrate).\n\nI am wondering what would be the best way to proceed to achieve this. Otherwise, I would be glad to hear any suggestion about this topic.\n\nCould I, for example, release the song with the band name as the primary artist and then add ourselves as featured artists? How can I make sure it actually appears on each of our solo profiles, as well as the band's?\n\nI should probably clarify that I have not yet released any of these new songs, since I still need to find an answer to this inquiry.\n\nThanks!"
