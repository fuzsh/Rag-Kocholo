Appropriateness of chosen repertoire should be considered. Change the category to Trombone Solo.\n\nEuphoniums: Trombone and Euphonium lists are interchangeable. Change the category in MPA Online to the correct instrument.*\n\nTreble Clef Baritone may play from the Trumpet List Grades 1-3. Change the category to Euphonium Solo. *\n\nMallets: Mallets soloists may play grade 1, 2 & 3 Flute and Oboe Literature.*\n\nEnsembles:\n\nInstruments bracketed parenthetically indicate optional parts.\n\nIn addition to listed choir music, quartet, quintet, and sextet music may be used to form choirs. There must be at least two(2) players per part.*\n\nPercussion ensembles may NOT double parts.\n\nChamber winds MUST be performed in the exact instrumentation listed - NO DOUBLING, NO SUBSTITUTIONS.\n\nString Bass: A string bass player in a school that does not have an orchestra, may perform a double bass solo at the FBA solo/ensemble MPA. The solo must be on the FOA solo list. The difficulty levels shall be determined as follows:\n\nFOA Class A = FBA Grade 5\n\nFOA Class B = FBA Grade 4\n\nFOA Class C = FBA Grade 3\n\nFOA Class D = FBA Grade 2\n\nFOA Class E = FBA Grade 1\n\nStudents must play a Grade 5 (class A) to be eligible for State MPA.\n\nExtended Time for Longer Solos: If you have a student who wishes to play a solo that is longer than the allotted time limit after making appropriate cuts as described in the FBA Handbook on page 21-22, you may request an extended time block for their performance:\n\nThe request should be made to yourdistrict chair. Let them know how much more time the student will need.\n\nDistrict chairs: after you schedule your MPA, you can extend the student's timeslot in MPA Online:\n\nGo to the \"Schedule\" page\n\nSelect the student's Judge from the Judge drop-down\n\nFind the student's entry and click the \"+2 min\" button. This will push all events after this one 2 minutes later each time you click that button. Repeat for each additional 2 minutes the director has requested.\n\n*When playing music from another category, the director must change the category of the entry in MPA Online. For example, if a Trombone is playing a piece from the Euphonium Solo list, after you enter it in MPA Online it will think it's a Euphonium solo so you must manually change the \"Category\" to \"Trombone Solo.\" Or, if you are doubling parts of a quartet, quintet, or sextet to make it a choir, you must change the category of the MPA Online entry to the appropriate type of choir."
