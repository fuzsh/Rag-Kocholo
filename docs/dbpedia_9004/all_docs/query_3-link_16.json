        "text": "About South America\n\nSouth America is made up of: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, British Guyana, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Falkland Islands, French Guiana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela.\n\nSouth America is a melting pot of cultures and dance; from samba in Brazil to the Argentine tango, this continent has soul with a Spanish flavour.\n\nIt has everything from the world’s driest desert to tropical rainforests, snow-capped mountains, volcanoes and colonial towns, and is one of the most bio-diverse continents, with many high-altitude cities and towns.\n\nThe Amazon runs through seven of the thirteen countries, including one of the largest, Brazil, with a harbour fit enough to be one of the Seven Wonders. Soak up some rays at Copacabana Beach, go bohemian in Santa Teresa, dance to Brazilian beats at Bahia or just marvel at Iguazu Falls, which are higher than Niagara.\n\nThen there’s Easter Island. The world’s most isolated inhabited island, known for its giant moai statues and named after the day it was discovered. * Read: Things To Do in Easter Island\n\nWherever you choose to go, solo travel in South America, and you can expect to return home with more than a few new dance moves. If you're planning on taking a South America trip or backpacking South America, below is a summary of each country to help you choose the right destination for you.\n\nClick on the images at the end for the solo destination guides. For a more detailed guide, read: Related Post: How To Travel With South America\n\nSolo Travel in South America\n\nIs South America safe for solo female travellers?\n\nSouth America is a continent that’s popular with backpackers and many women travel here without any problems. It’s mainly a macho society, so expect attention from males, whether it’s just shouting “linda” (meaning beautiful) from afar or asking you to dance.\n\nIf you travel to rural areas, they may not be used to seeing a woman alone, so expect even more attention of the flattery kind.\n\nIn the more-developed cities, such as San Jose or Medellin, you can dress how you like so there’s no need to dress conservatively. Crime is the biggest issue here, so be careful of your belongings and if you go off the beaten path, buddy up with other travellers or take a tour.\n\nThe safest South American countries for solo female travel are Uruguay and Argentina. Travelling in the less-developed countries of Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador will be a culture shock, especially in Bolivia. First due to its poverty and second because of its altitude. Travelling to neighbouring Venezuela is not advised due to the economic and political situation at present.\n\nTravelling Around South America\n\nUnlike Central America, South America has vast distances and flying from country to country is not the cheapest method to get around. Although airlines operate within many countries in South America, the routes are not generally direct. Costs can be expensive compared to flying internally within countries. A good tip here is to cross the borders by bus, then fly within the countries to maximise your time away.\n\nAlthough bus travel is the cheapest method of travelling around the continent, you need to be cautious on some border routes, which are popular with robbers. Travel during the day and check travel forums if you have to travel overnight to make sure that your route is safe. If you do travel by bus, expect some routes to be windy if you’re going through a mountainous pass.\n\nHiring a car isn’t really advised as the traffic can be chaotic and you don’t want to be driving anywhere off the beaten track alone. There is also the chance of being stopped by corrupt police, so use other methods of transport if you can. If you have time, taking a river cruise through the Amazon is a unique way of getting from country to country.\n\nBut if you travel from Colombia to Brazil, for example, you’ll need to allow a few days to get there. Some islands here are too far to travel by sea, so if you want to visit San Andres, Easter Island or the Falkland Islands, you have to fly.\n\nBelow is a summary of the countries and how to get around.\n\nSolo Travel in Argentina\n\nThere is more to Argentina than the leg-flicking tango and the Falkland Islands. The Argentines enjoy good wine and steaks, and have a passion to be proud of, not to mention the stunning fjords and lakes within the Patagonia region, which they share with Chile.\n\nThere is a good traveller network in Argentina and friendly locals, especially the younger generation, who are open to mixing with travellers. Just be careful of the stray dogs that hang around some of the bus stations. * Read: Solo Travel in Argentina\n\nTravelling Around Argentina\n\nArgentina isn’t that cheap to fly around, although there are airlines which offer domestic routes, such as Aerolineas and LADE. Be prepared that travelling here will eat into your budget.\n\nThere are many bus companies for long-distance travel and some with fully reclinable seats. If you can’t afford a seat that goes all the way back, then take a semi-cama instead, which is cheaper and still comfortable.\n\nThere are tourist trains which operate along La Trochita and the Tren a las Nubes, which take you towards the Chilean border. Avoid the trains otherwise, and in towns, opt for shared taxis, which operate on fixed routes and leave when full. Boats on the Patagonia side will take you into Los Glaciares National Park and Nahuel Huapi National Park.\n\nSolo Travel in Bolivia\n\nBolivia may be poor, but it is rich in scenery and has the highest capital in the world, Death Road, the witches’ markets in La Paz and the blinding sight of the Uyuni salt flats.\n\nAlthough there is crime, Bolivia is still one of the safest places in South America and being the cheapest, it’s popular with travellers, so you’ll find plenty of others here.\n\nAvoid taking any jungle tours alone, and watch for petty thieves within markets and bus stations. Be careful at night and in Oruro, and on any border crossings. Steer clear of El Alto, as it is not the safest place for tourists, with robbery and pickpocketing. * Read: Solo Travel in Bolivia\n\nGetting Around Bolivia\n\nBolivia does have a poor road system, but the best way to get around the country is still by bus. Taking tours, especially those on a 4×4, is the best way to see the stunning landscapes in Bolivia and is necessary if you’re travelling overland from Bolivia to Chile through the Atacama Desert.\n\nThere are trains here, but they’re generally slower than buses, and flying can be quite costly. Consider taking a tour if you don’t fancy a rough bus ride.\n\nSolo Travel in Brazil\n\nBrazil is huge and has so much to see. If you’ve ever wanted to see the Christ the Redeemer Statue, take a cable car across Sugarloaf Mountain or witness the stunning Iguazu Falls, then Brazil should be on your solo bucket list.\n\nOther popular destinations apart from Rio de Janeiro and Iguazu Falls are the beach destinations of Bahia & Salvador, Fortaleza and the tropical beaches of Recife.\n\nIn a country the size of Brazil, you may not find many other travellers outside the main tourist destinations and cities. You do need to be careful here, as it has a high crime rate, so don’t walk around with any valuables on show and be careful at ATMs.\n\nTake caution if you go off the beaten track, especially if you take a jungle tour with a male guide. Look for larger groups or team up with fellow travellers if you want to explore lesser-trodden routes. Brazilians are really friendly, but having some phrases in Portuguese will help you to get by. * Read: Solo Travel in Brazil\n\nTravelling Around Brazil\n\nBrazil offers air passes to make the most of flying around the country. You can buy tickets within the airport or even shopping malls with Latam. Trains offer a more scenic route than some of the bus journeys, which can be up to 36 hours in some places, but you can get different classes on buses. If you’re on a budget, take an economy bus or a deluxe bus if you prefer more comfort.\n\nBritish Guyana & French Guiana\n\nBoth British Guyana and French Guiana aren’t really tourist destinations. Georgetown, the capital of British Guyana, has a high crime rate, and although the city has some colourful colonial architecture, you probably wouldn’t want to be solo here.\n\nThe rest of the country offers community-based tourism, birdwatching and wildlife. Minibuses and river taxis allow you to travel through the small country of Guyana, as well as 4x4s and hire cars, but if you do visit here, you may feel more comfortable with an organised tour.\n\nTravelling Around Guyana & French Guiana\n\nFrench Guiana is a territory of France. Tourism infrastructure is difficult here, and you could find yourself waiting hours for a minibus from Saint Laurent du Maroni to Cayenne, the capital. Boats take you across the river from Saint Laurent du Maroni to the border of Suriname. The biggest attraction here is the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, but you do need to book ahead for a tour (in French). Hire a car if you come here.\n\nSolo Travel in Chile\n\nChile is a beautiful country. You have the Atacama Desert, the cosmopolitan capital of Santiago surrounded by the Andes Mountains, the colourful port city of Valparaiso, the Lake District, Northern Patagonia and Torres del Paine National Park.\n\nIt is a popular destination with solo females, so expect to meet others, especially in the funky area of Bellavista in Santiago. Relax on the endless stretch of Chile’s northern beaches, visit a vineyard for a Chilean Blanc or experience the Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world, where you can also meet others.\n\n* Related Post: How I Travelled Chile\n\nTravelling Around Chile\n\nChile has good overnight buses and internal flights. You can even try to get a discount on your bus ticket if you see a bus half-full. Locals hitchhike here, but like anywhere, follow your gut instinct if you decide to do it. Getting to Patagonia, however, is a different story. There is no direct road from Chile, so taking a flight or a boat is the only option. Although once you’re there, you can sail around the fjords. Chile can be combined with Argentina if you have time.\n\nSolo Travel in Colombia\n\nColombia, once declared too dangerous to travel to, is now a magical realm for tourists, with Caribbean beaches, coffee plantations and the Amazon. It has come a long way in the past decade. Medellin, Bogota and Cartagena are among the most popular destinations here, with the Pacific Coast lacking in tourism infrastructure.\n\nAlthough Colombia gets a bad rap in the press, the majority of areas are fine for a solo female. Safety has improved over the past decade in Colombia, but if you walk around with valuables on show, you are more likely to be robbed. Avoid certain areas, especially the more remote areas, and avoid hiking alone. There are cases of buses being held up, so avoid night buses on particular routes, such as Bogota to Quito, and opt for travelling during the day instead.\n\nOnly carry as much money as you need, and don’t carry all of your credit and debit cards with you. There is still guerrilla activity within parts of the Amazon, so avoid exploring by yourself. Colombia is a beautiful country, with the friendliest people, but you do need to be street-wise here. * Read Solo Travel in Colombia\n\nGetting Around Colombia\n\nIn the cities of Bogota and Medellin, there is a good transport system, with both having metro and bus services. If you take a taxi, use a taxi app in Bogota and avoid hailing one in the street. In Medellin, you can take a taxi from the street.\n\nThere are also collectivos, which are minibuses. Instead of taking a bus across the country, look at Viva Colombia for internal flights. Some of the roads are mountainous, so you may prefer to fly if you suffer from travel sickness.\n\nSolo Travel in Ecuador\n\nNeighbouring Ecuador is also diverse. From the colonial town of Quito to whitewater rafting in Tena, there is much to see in this Land of Eternal Spring. Visit the Galapagos Islands for cloud forests, active volcanoes and unique wildlife. Some solos combine Ecuador with Peru or Colombia and travel overland.\n\nDon’t miss the Equator Line, which runs through the country. You can visit this touristy spot to say that you stood in the ‘middle of the world’.\n\nBanos is absolutely stunning and is for the adventure solo, with whitewater rafting, paragliding, canyoning and bridge swings. The area is lush with waterfalls. Trek the Quilotoa Loop for beautiful views of a crater lake, surf in Montanita or visit the Equatorial Amazon.\n\nEcuador is relatively safe, but avoid certain areas of Quito at night. Theft does happen on the buses, so be careful at bus stations and keep your belongings close to you. The Galapagos Islands are welcoming to travellers and have a laid-back attitude, but be prepared for some friendly attention.\n\n* Related Post: How I Travelled Ecuador as a Solo\n\nGetting Around Ecuador\n\nBuses are incredibly cheap in Ecuador and follow a certain route. If you want to get off the beaten track and visit a corner of the country, then you may find yourself spending hours on a bus having to backtrack. Keep your valuables on your lap in the buses too, as they are known for thieves.\n\nIf you aren’t taking a cruise around the Galapagos Islands, fly to them instead. You can take a flight from Guayaquil or Quito, and fly into Santa Cruz and fly out of San Cristobal. Once you are on the islands, you can island hop with the boats. Santa Cruz is the main hub. From Loja there are night buses down to Peru.\n\nSolo Travel in Peru\n\nPeru is a country steeped in fascinating history, with lush scenery and colourful traditions. Many solos visit here for the culture and mountains. Peru also has good surf, with Mancora and Huanchaco attracting young, adventurous solos.\n\nLearn about the Inca Empire in Peru and visit Machu Picchu, the most famous Inca ruin of them all, before visiting the ancient capital of Cuzco and Lake Titicaca. There are so many ruins to see here that you need at least two weeks to see just some of the country.\n\nThen there is Rainbow Mountain, Arequipa and the Nazca Lines to explore. If you spend time in Peru, stay in Miraflores, which is less hectic and more comfortable than the rest of the city.\n\nThe north of Peru does not have that many tourists and parts of the country are out of bounds, so check FCO advice or use a tour company if you are unsure of where to travel.\n\nNot all indigenous villagers will welcome you; some remote Andean villages which live in complete isolation are not keen on visitors, so stick to the tourist route when travelling alone or hire a Quechua-speaking guide.\n\nYou may find that Peru is not as friendly as other South American countries and begging is increasing within the tourist destinations. As a solo, you may encounter stares from the locals.\n\nAs in any other city, be careful with your belongings in Lima and don’t walk about at night (Cuzco is much safer). You may experience altitude sickness here, so take altitude sickness tablets with you and tell others if you feel unwell.\n\nRelated Post: Solo Travel in Peru\n\nRelated Post: How I Travelled Peru\n\nTravelling Around Peru\n\nThe buses in Peru are fantastic. Because of the long distances they have overnight buses, which include a meal and sometimes breakfast. Sleeper buses have either semi-cama or cama seats, so you have the choice of half-reclining or completely flat. The buses are comfortable and safe to travel on.\n\nYou may prefer to fly internally if you’re short on time. Be careful if you fly from Lima to Cusco, as you could experience altitude sickness when you arrive. Allow a couple of days longer here to acclimate. The best way to see the Nazca Lines is by plane. Flying to Iquitos, then taking a boat, is the easiest way to explore the Peruvian Amazon.\n\nSolo Travel in Suriname\n\nSuriname is a Dutch colony and is popular for its eco-tourism. The capital, Paramaribo, is known for its wooden colonial buildings and is on the UNESCO World Heritage list. You can follow the sugar trail, experience the Moengo cultural traditions or just wander around the Mosque Keizerstraat, one of the most beautiful historical monuments in the country.\n\nMost people come here to experience the Amazon way of life and stay in an eco-retreat along the river. This country is abundant in nature, and when you are ready to see the countryside, step outside the capital and take a boat trip along the Amazon River.\n\nThe country attracts Dutch and European tourists because of the Dutch language. If you do venture into the villages along the river, be prepared for people to stare at you.\n\nThe capital isn’t a very comfortable place to stay due to the attention of the local men, who think that you are here searching for a Caribbean lover. If you can ignore the constant purring, then come here independently. If not, consider taking a tour.\n\nTravelling Around Suriname\n\nSuriname is expensive due to a lack of tourists, but there is a minibus system here and two local airlines. The best way to get around the country is with a tour company. Once you arrive at Paramaribo, you can arrange tours from there. The private buses leave once they are full, or you can hire a car instead. Boats take you along the river to eco-lodges, and you can also take a minibus to the border of French Guiana.\n\nSolo Travel in Uruguay\n\nUruguay is a small country on this continent which sometimes gets overlooked. If you’re travelling to Argentina then it’s easy to combine a trip here. Montevideo is the capital, and the city is a mix of the old and the new, with Independence Square dividing both parts.\n\nVisit the Circus Palace, the Uruguayan walk of fame and the theatre before heading to the beach area of Punta del Este on the east coast. This area, with its giant hand coming out of the sand, has good nightlife, resorts and beautiful beaches.\n\nColonia is the oldest city in Uruguay and its attraction is its historic quarter, a gorgeous area that sits on the coastline with cobbled streets and colourful old stone houses.\n\nRelated Post: Montevideo, Uruguay's Quirky Capital\n\nRelated Post: Things To Do in Colonia Uruguay as a Solo\n\nTravelling Around Uruguay\n\nYou can reach Uruguay by ferry from Buenos Aires and once you’re there, they have an extensive bus network.
