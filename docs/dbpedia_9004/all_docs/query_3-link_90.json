        "text": "It takes courage and confidence to embark into the unknown, especially on your own. But that's what a number of country stars have done at some point in their musical careers -- even after spending years as part of a duo, trio or group of some sort.\n\nSome country artists were in acclaimed duos or bands before venturing into solo careers; others were in little-known groups, and going solo was the first step to massive success. Many times, these artists went solo because their group went on a hiatus. Since then, some have returned to their original bands, a few bands have dissolved, and others have decided to stay solo while the group continued without them; some singers are even doing some combination of those three things.\n\nClick through the photo gallery below to learn more about which country artists broke away from their bands to pursue solo careers:"
