        "text": "Via being a member of Old Dominion, veteran Nashville performer Brad Tursi could close 2024 as a 15-time Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association award winner.\n\nGiven that this makes Old Dominion arguably as successful as 2008 Country Music Hall of Famers the Statler Brothers, it means the July 19 release of Tursi's debut solo project, \"Parallel Love,\" occurs at a unique evolutionary point for his career expectations.\n\nBefore taking that next legacy-creating step, Tursi turned back the clock, to growing up a childhood fan of James Taylor.\n\n\"Half the time, I didn't even know what he was singing about, but I knew it felt and sounded cool,\" Tursi jokes to The Tennessean while seated in a board room at Sony Music Nashville on a July afternoon.\n\n\"Great songs often embody magic and defy being so easily understood. Not every song has to be songwritten to death.\"\n\nTursi's career, in retrospect\n\nThe Connecticut native is a former rock lead guitarist with MTV plays and video game soundtrack credits to his name with 2000s-era Washington, D.C., act Army of Me. Moving to Music City for a decade to scratch his country songwriter itch led him to Old Dominion.\n\nImagine a timeline where Old Dominion never happened for Tursi.\n\nThink of Tursi, 44, having spent every waking moment of his adult life as a working, touring musician and frequent songwriter. That's still an award-winning solo career that includes Greg Bates, Luke Bryan, Kenny Chesney, Brett Eldredge, Tyler Hubbard, Darius Rucker, Cole Swindell and Josh Turner as frequent collaborators.\n\nThus, \"Parallel Lives\" — a 10-track collection of songs that Old Dominion (nor anyone else) never cut but were co-written with Stephen Wilson Jr., Dan Isbell, Jessi Alexander, and Matt Jenkins — exists as a comma definitively replacing where a period existed for a chapter of Tursi's life.\n\n\"I honestly am releasing this album, with the full support of the other members of Old Dominion, for fun,\" says Tursi. \"I'm at a place in my career where I have the means to go into the studio and self-produce an album of songs I love, that I enjoy singing, that were sitting around.\n\n\"Sometimes, because a band is a democracy, having five opinions on the songs we're going to record (will exclude) things that I, alone, enjoy. And given that Old Dominion has achieved the success that we have, that's OK.\"\n\n'Parallel Love'\n\nHalf of the album's output (\"Question the Universe,\" \"Where You Been,\" \"Crazy Life\" and \"Lover and a Friend\") features Tursi solo writes. In a town where current hits feature as many as six writers, it's a novel return to country's classic form.\n\nThe other half of the project features songs like \"Church Bells and Train Whistles,\" a songwriting collaboration with Ben West and grunge-inspired current country-meets-rock breakout star Stephen Wilson Jr.\n\nIt's a plaintive, poetic, and steel guitar-aided ode to feeling like the road between heaven, hell, love and heartbreak is filled with the type of open-road wanderlust that made the Western edge of 1980s and '90s rock into stadium anthems.\n\n\"I was born with the pedal down out of heaven headed southbound / Guitar heart with strings attached it takes me away it takes me back,\" Tursi sings.\n\nThe album's title track is a \"salt of the earth country track\" that elevates afternoons spent at home watching the day go by into an idyllic sonic portrait dominated by fences, gardens, wrenches, porches and wildflowers. Bearing what feels like the same key and chords as Kenny Rogers' \"The Gambler,\" it feels like a song you've known forever, by cultural osmosis.\n\nListen closely and there's \"Things a Man Oughta Know\" co-writer Trannie Anderson's voice peeking through as a background vocalist.\n\nHow'd she end up there?\n\nTursi jokes that Anderson was one of many people texted to join on the track. She's the only one who felt inspired enough to collaborate, live on its recording session.\n\nThough he's won two dozen honors in a decade in Nashville, Tursi still humbly texts fellow superstar session collaborators for assistance and hopes his fellow creatives are into his work.\n\nFeeding the artistic soul\n\nBecause Old Dominion has consistently remained a country radio and stadium-touring staple for a decade, imagine as well that, for Tursi, \"Parallel Love\" is a project that bears no stress of demanding multiple hit songs to be deemed successful.\n\nWhen asked where the best place and time to hear this album is, he offered that it pairs best with dinner preparation and nights on the couch.\n\n\"This album feeds the artistic part of my soul that sometimes just likes to stay at home, brew a pot of coffee and start writing. Balancing scratching that itch against working in service to the (Nashville) hit-making machine is important.\"\n\nWhen asked to ponder who is the demographic best served by the album ultimately, he reveals his most self-effacing answer of the afternoon.\n\n\"If people don't like this album, at least I have made something I can send to my mom — she loves everything I do, regardless.\""
