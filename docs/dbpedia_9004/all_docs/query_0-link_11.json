        "text": "Trust us, we’re professionals when it comes to boy bands.\n\nFor decades, every era of music has had its collection of iconic boy bands. From screaming fans of the Beatles in the 1960s to the height of the Jackson Five’s fame in the ‘70s straight on to the ARMY members devoted to BTS today, boy bands have had a hold on music listeners throughout many generations.\n\nOf course, there’s not one way to define a boy band. Some groups, like Five Seconds of Summer, play instruments while others, like the iconic boy bands of the ‘90s and early ‘00s, grace the stage with their mind-blowing choreography. They exist across genres as well, ranging from pop to R&B to hip-hop to punk — and no one group is more or less a perfect example of the category.\n\nBut if there’s one thing boy bands do have in common, it’s their loyal and (lovingly) chaotic fanbases. Whether you’re a Directioner or an EXO-L, being part of any boy band fandom comes with excitement, love, and, of course, all the music imaginable. Ahead, check out some of the greatest boy bands of all time — and then be sure to have a dance party, stat.\n\nBTS\n\nWe have to start with BTS simply because, well, they’re BTS! The Korean septet, consisting of members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, debuted in 2013 before making an explosive global splash around 2016 and 2017. Their rocket to fame has been unstoppable ever since. From performing at the Grammys to appearing at the White House, the members are undoubtedly cultural icons within both their home country of South Korea and all over the world.\n\nBoyz II Men\n\nLet’s go a bit further back in history to swoon over the romantic lyrics of Boyz II Men. The group, which has been around since 1985, has had a variety of members over time, and currently includes Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris, and Shawn Stockman. The iconic R&B group was known for plenty of middle school slow songs during the ‘90s, and has been going strong for over three decades.\n\nThe Beatles\n\nOf course, it’s hard to talk about boy bands — or music at all, really — without mentioning the Beatles, which is viewed as one of the most influential musical groups of all time. The Beatles, composed of legendary musicians John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, officially got together in 1960, and within just a few years, they’d reached international superstardom. The group was only together for a decade before splitting off into their prestigious solo careers, but they continue to be the best-selling musical group of all time, with over 600 million records sold around the entire world.\n\nOne Direction\n\nSpeaking of heartbreaking band breakups, 1D might have disbanded years ago (and former member Zayn Malik left even earlier than that), but they’ll always live on in our hearts. Zayn, Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Niall Horan first came together on the 2010 season of The X Factor, after which they very quickly achieved star-level status. In recent years, each 1D boy has gone on to solo careers (with Harry hitting the big screen as well). We’ll still be holding onto the hope of a reunion someday!\n\n*NSYNC\n\nNo boy band list would be complete without the groups of the ‘90s and early ‘00s, and *NSYNC was all the rage back then. Consisting of members Justin Timberlake, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, and Chris Kirkpatrick, *NSYNC was first formed in 1995 and disbanded seven years later. But in between, they left the world with some serious bangers — not to mention that iconic “Bye Bye Bye” choreography.\n\n98 Degrees\n\nAnother staple of the late ‘90s, the quartet 98 Degrees consisted of brothers Nick and Drew Lachey, along with Jeff Timmons and Justin Jeffre. Like other boy bands of the past, 98 Degrees have since teamed back up for a reunion, though we’re still waiting on a reboot of Newlyweds.\n\nThe Jackson 5\n\nFormed in 1964, The Jackson 5 consisted of brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael. What began as talent show performances soon spiraled into worldwide fame, and the group signed with Motown in 1968. In addition to their still-memorable albums, the group performed on television (and even had their own show). After Michael Jackson’s death in 2009, the four brothers reunited for more tours.\n\nSHINee\n\nFormed by SM Entertainment, SHINee debuted as a quintet in 2008 with members Onew, Key, Minho, Taemin, and Jonghyun (who passed away in 2017). With almost a decade and a half of experience, the South Korean boy band’s record-breaking albums are popular all over the world, and they are especially known for their live dance performances featuring incredibly complex choreography.\n\nNew Kids on the Block\n\nFormed in 1984, NKOTB is thought of as one of the most iconic boy bands of all time. Original members included Jordan and Jonathan Knight, Joey McIntyre, Danny Wood, and Donnie Wahlberg — and yes, actor Mark Wahlberg was also once part of the group for a short time. They rose to incredible fame in the late ‘80s, and although they temporarily disbanded in 1994, they are back together today and kicked off their Mixtape Tour in May 2022.\n\n2ge+her\n\nThe journey of 2ge+her is an interesting one, as they started off as a parody boy band with a series on MTV. The group consisted of performers Jerry O'Keefe, Chad Linus, Jason \"Q.T.\" McKnight, Doug Linus, and Mickey Parke, each of whom portrayed a different boy band archetype like The Heartthrob or The Shy One. While they were originally formed to spoof IRL boy bands, they eventually accrued a fanbase of their own. One thing led to another, and they ended up opening for Britney Spears on her Oops…I Did It Again tour in 2000. And let’s be real, it’s impossible to listen to “U + Me = Us (Calculus)” without having it stuck in your head for the remainder of the week.\n\nCNCO\n\nBased in Florida, CNCO is composed of musicians Richard Camacho, Erick Brian Colón, Christopher Vélez, and Zabdiel De Jesús, with former member Joel Pimentel having left the group in 2021. They achieved widespread recognition after winning the first season of La Banda, and have since gone on to produce three studio albums. Most recently, it was announced that they would be making their acting debut in the upcoming Disney+ miniseries titled 4 Ever.\n\nO-Town\n\nO-Town was formed as a result of the ABC/MTV series Making the Band, a reality show designed to assemble a musical group by the end of a season. Original members included Ashley Parker Angel, Erik Michael Estrada, Trevor Penick, Jacob Underwood, and Ikaika Kahoano, the last of whom was later replaced by Dan Miller. The group put out two studio albums before disbanding in 2003, but later reunited in addition to the solo careers of several members.\n\nNew Edition\n\nHailing from Boston, New Edition was formed in 1978 and originally consisted of musicians Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, Bobby Brown, Ronnie DeVoe, and Ralph Tresvant. Bobby Brown left the group in 1985 to pursue his solo career; he was later replaced with Johnny Gill. Decades later, the group reunited as a six-person band to celebrate New Edition’s 30th anniversary, and they were officially inducted into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame in February 2022.\n\nHanson\n\nThe trio of brothers — Isaac, Taylor, and Zac Hanson — ascended to incredible fame in the ‘90s with the release of their still-iconic single, “MMMBop.” It was one of those songs that everyone knew without really knowing all of the words. The group is still together today, with their most recent album Red Green Blue currently out now.\n\nTake That\n\nFormed in Manchester in 1990, Take That was composed of Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen, Jason Orange, and Robbie Williams (yes, that Robbie Williams). Currently, only Gary, Howard, and Mark are the remaining members. Known for chart-topping songs such as \"Back for Good\" and \"Never Forget,” the U.K.-based boy band is still making music today.\n\nJodeci\n\nThe R&B quartet known as Jodeci was big in the ‘90s, and consisted of members DeVanté Swing, Mr. Dalvin, K-Ci, and JoJo. They released three studio albums between the years of 1991 and 1995 before disbanding, with members K-Ci and JoJo forming a spinoff duo. In 2013, Jodeci came together as a foursome to record their fourth studio album, and they played a reunion tour in 2015.\n\nMenudo\n\nMenudo is a Puerto Rican boy band formed in 1977, whose original lineup consisted of brothers Fernando and Nefty Sallaberry, along with the Melendez brothers: Carlos, Óscar, and Ricky. The band has had several different members over the years, including the iconic Ricky Martin, who went on to have a flourishing solo career. In addition to the dozens of albums they’ve put out over time, Menudo also had their very own TV series and movie.\n\nSB19\n\nJosh, Pablo, Stell, Ken, and Justin are the five members of the Filipino boy band known as SB19. They were formed in 2016 after winning a talent search, going on to release a studio album along with eight singles. They’ve continued achieving heights of popularity in early 2022 with the release of their hit “Bazinga.”\n\nAll-4-One\n\nIf you’ve ever swayed to “I Swear” on a dance floor, you’ve rocked out to the ‘90s group All-4-One, comprised of members Jamie Jones, Delious Kennedy, Alfred Nevarez, and Tony Borowiak. They’re still going strong today, and paid homage to their past with a 20th anniversary album in 2015.\n\nSEVENTEEN\n\nAlso stylized as SVT, this K-pop group has a grand total of 13 members: S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino. With four studio albums and 12 EPs, they are a force to be reckoned with. Most recently, the group dropped their fourth album, Face The Sun, which coincided with the celebration of their seventh anniversary.\n\n5ive\n\nOne of the many 90s boy bands hailing from the U.K., 5ive is a group of guys who were signed under the same producers who managed the Spice Girls. They had five members (hence their name), and reached reasonable success in the US. Their first major hit was “When the Lights Go Out,” which was catchy as hell and also earned them a cameo in a Disney Channel Original movie (NBD). They’re still around today, but they’re down to three members (so maybe they should change their name to 3hree?).\n\nB2K\n\nFormed in 1998, B2K features singers Lil' Fizz, J-Boog, Raz-B, and Omarion. They were active in the early 2000s and known for songs such as “Gots Ta Be” and “Girlfriend.” After disbanding in 2004, they reunited over a decade later in 2019 for their Millennium Tour.\n\nBig Time Rush\n\nAmong the height of the boy band craze in the early aughts was Big Time Rush, a group that was also part of a Nickelodeon series of the same name. Members included Kendall Schmidt, James Maslow, Carlos Pena Jr., and Logan Henderson, who portrayed the hockey players-turned-musicians on the series from 2009 to 2013. The group is still together and performing today.\n\nWestlife\n\nThis U.K.-based boy band was signed by Simon Cowell in 1998 and was composed of original members Shane Filan, Mark Feehily, Kian Egan, Nicky Byrne, and Brian McFadden, the last of whom departed the group in 2004. They rose to fame quickly in the early aughts before disbanding in 2012. However, they got back together in 2018 and embarked on a tour in summer 2022.\n\nBig Bang\n\nK-pop icons Big Bang consist of four members, G-Dragon, T.O.P, Taeyang, and Daesung, and have been around since their debut album in 2006. The group was originally a five-person band; however, former member Seungri left the entertainment industry in 2019 following allegations of sexual bribery. Big Bang released several studio albums and EPs in both South Korea and Japan over the years, before taking a hiatus. They announced a return in April 2022 with a brand-new single titled “Still Life,” which debuted to record numbers.\n\nFive Seconds of Summer\n\n5SOS burst onto the scene in 2011 and it’s fair to say the world has never been the same since! Composed of members Luke Hemmings, Michael Clifford, Calum Hood, and Ashton Irwin, this Australian pop-punk group is known for hits like “Teeth” and “Ghost of You.” Over a decade later, they’re still together, despite breakup rumors that were swirling in 2021 sparked by their announcement that they were parting ways with their label.\n\nSeo Taiji and the Boys\n\nPopular in the ‘90s, Seo Taiji and the Boys was a South Korean boy band composed of members Seo Taiji, Yang Hyun-suk, and Lee Juno. Between 1992 and 1995, they released four studio albums, and were the recipients of the Grand Prize at the Seoul Music Awards two years in a row. The group disbanded in 1996, and while they’ve discussed the possibility of a reunion, Seo Taiji has expressed his hesitations and skepticism, explaining, “I worry we might disappoint, so I am not confident.”\n\nEXO\n\nK-Pop powerhouse EXO currently consists of nine members: Xiumin, Suho, Lay, Baekhyun, Chen, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai, and Sehun. They first debuted in 2013 and quickly soared to international fame, playing music across a range of genres including EDM and hip-hop. Music isn’t their only forté, either — for example, you might have noticed EXO member Kai for his work with Gucci. Back to music though, though group comebacks have been scarce, various EXO members have also put solo projects while others complete their mandatory military service.\n\nJonas Brothers\n\nWe can’t talk about boy bands without talking about the Jonas Brothers, of course! Nick, Kevin, and Joe first stole our hearts in 2006 with their debut album It’s About Time. Though they took a brief hiatus (several hiatuses, in fact), they made a huge comeback in 2019, making it feel like they never left at all. We’re still waiting to see if they end up re-recording that first album.\n\nMonsta X\n\nK-Pop icons Monsta X are currently made up of singers Shownu, Minhyuk, Kihyun, Hyungwon, Joohoney, and I.M, with former member Wonho having departed from the group back in October 2019. The group was formed in 2015 when they debuted their first EP titled Trespass, and have since become one of the most popular K-pop groups (and most popular boy bands) around the world.\n\nLFO\n\nWith an easy funky vibe and fun lyrics fans couldn’t stop singing along to, LFO was arguably one of the best boy bands of the early 90s. They produced several chart-topping hits, like “Summer Girls,” “Girl on TV” and “Every Other Time.” Tragically, two of the three original band members passed away at early ages due to cancer.\n\nThe Wanted\n\nBritish boy band The Wanted was formed in 2009 after a huge audition to search for talent. Although they were hot in the U.K. for a few years, they didn't make their way over to the U.S. until 2012, with their single \"Glad You Came.\" In the years since, they had their own reality show on E! called The Wanted Life, which was produced by Ryan Seacrest. The Wanted went on hiatus in 2014, but they've promised that they would work together again one day. We're waiting...\n\nBackstreet Boys\n\nAs all ‘90s kids know, you either loved *NSYNC or you loved the Backstreet Boys (or, let’s be honest, both). Formed in 1993 and made up of five members (Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Brian Littrell, and Kevin Richardson), BSB rocketed to fame in the late ‘90s, with their 1999 album Millenium selling more than 1,000,000 copies within the first week. Although they later split, they’ve since reunited and continue to play concerts today."
