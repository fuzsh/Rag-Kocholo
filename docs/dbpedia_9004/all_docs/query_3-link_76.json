        "text": "TOP THINGS TO DO EXPERIENCE IN EL SALVADOR\n\nThe Giant Rainbow Slide. The slide is located at the Picnic Steakhouse outside of San Salvador. Entry to the restaurant is free, but you have to purchase an item on the menu to get on the slide. The slide cost $5 per round. The slide is outside of San Salvador; I would recommend a taxi or a car rental if you have family there, even better. An absolute must. Check out the video of me going down the slide here.\n\nLearn about the culture by hiking to active and inactive volcanoes. The most popular volcano in El Salvador is Santa Ana. Santa Ana is west of San Salvador City, and it is considered the highest and most active volcano in El Salvador. I tried to visit but didn’t have enough time, as the tours are scheduled for 7 am. El Salvador is home to 17 volcanoes, both active and inactive: Santa Ana Volcano, San Salvador Volcan, Izalco, Lago de Coatepeque, San Miguel, Conchagua, San Vicente, Chinameca, Usulutan, Tecapa, Cuazapa, Conchaguiita, Cerro El Taburete, Chingo, Cosiguina Volcano, Tacana Volcano, and Tiger Island.\n\nI checked out El Boqueron, which is a 10 minutes drive up from the Picnic Steakhouse. El Boqueron is a dormant volcano; breathtaking! I hiked about 10 minutes up; that’s not a long hike compared to Santa Ana. It takes three hours to walk to and from Santa Ana. Nonetheless, you can learn a lot about the indigenous people at the El Boqueron museum center. You get an insight into their lives pre and post volcanoes; it goes deep into the El Salvadorean ancestry.\n\n3. Hang out on the Coatepeque Caldera. From El Boqueron, you can spot Lago de Coatepeque. Lake Coatepeque is a large crater lake surrounded by wooded hills in western El Salvador. You can drive up to the lake and have lunch by the water. The lake has an active volcano right underneath. How cool is that? I recommend.\n\n4. Spend a Day at Nawi Beach House. Nawi Beach House is a beautiful beach club to spend a relaxing afternoon with unlimited $5 drinks. The beach house is $15, and it includes a horseback ride and a welcome drink. Nawi Beach House is very instagrammable, so great photo ops.\n\nA negative antigen test result is required to re-enter the United States. Please note that antigen test results come out in a matter of hours or less. I received my antigen test results in 20 minutes. PCR tests are not required to re-enter, just an antigen test. Here are five popular places where you can get tested.\n\nLaboratorio Centre de Diagnostico. This lab is a common one used by American travelers. It is located in San Salvador and costs $35. This location is further away from the airport so give yourself ample time.\n\nLaboratorio Clinico Torres Campo. I did my antigen test at this lab. It cost me $50, and it’s right next to the airport. My results were available in 20 minutes.\n\nLaboratorio Centro De Diagnostico. It is located in San Salvador and it cost $30 for a test.\n\nAnaliza. I spotted this on the El Salvador website. Depending on where you are staying, it is a good option. Analiza is in San Salvador. The antigen test is $30.\n\nMax Bloch. I also spotted this on the website with travel resources. Their website is in Spanish. I added it to the list just in case you need extra help.\n\nPlease note that I used the Lab you see pictured. It’s 5 mins from the airport, so you can’t beat that!"
