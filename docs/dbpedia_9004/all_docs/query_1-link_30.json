        "text": "Mark Tremonti, the guitarist for Creed and Alter Bridge, has just announced a new album from his solo band, Tremonti, that is called, The End Will Show Us How. Tremonti’s new record will be released on January 10th via Napalm Records. To tide fans over while they wait for the album to arrive, the lead single from the new collection, “Just Too Much,” is available for streaming now along with a just released music video as well. The End Will Show Us How is comprised of 12 tracks produced by Michael Baskette, and features Tremonti joined by guitarist Eric Friedman, bassist Tanner Keegan, and drummer Ryan Bennett.\n\nThe band is planning a tour of Europe early next year to support the new record, with additional dates to be announced soon. Tremonti is currently busy performing with a reunited Creed, with the band set to continue their highly successful tour with a show at PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey on August 7.
