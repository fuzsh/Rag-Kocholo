        "text": "Twelve years ago, I made the difficult decision to travel alone for the first time. I was so scared to do it, but looking back, taking that leap of faith changed my life.\n\nI’ve traveled to over 65 countries over the past decade, most of them alone.\n\nSince it can be overwhelming to decide where to go first, Iâve compiled a list of 25 destinations that I have loved the most solo, and I know you will love them too:\n\nBest Places to Travel Alone for the First Time Quick List:\n\nBest in North America: Hawaiâi\n\nBest in South America: Peru\n\nBest in Europe: Ireland\n\nBest in Asia: Thailand\n\nBest in Africa: Botswana\n\nNorth America\n\n1. California\n\nTo my non-American readers, if you are looking at the States for your first solo trip abroad, allow me to suggest to you the home I grew up in â California! While each state has something to offer, and many places in the US are suitable for solo travelers, I truly believe that California is the ideal destination for first-time solo travelers (even Americans too).\n\nSome of the best destinations in California are San Francisco, Humboldt County, Orange County, and everything along the Pacific Coast Highway. I suggest beginning in San Francisco, as itâs a tourist favorite, with ample public transport, high walkability (although it’s hilly), and a vibrant cultural scene. Thereâs truly nowhere else like the Bay Area.\n\nIf you want to head off the beaten path, Humboldt and the Lost Coast are beautiful and laid-back. There are also a bunch of road-trip routes to choose from. My favorites are the Southwest (California and beyond) as well as Highway 395, one of the most scenic stretches of highway in the US.\n\nFinally, if you want to see “the last free place in America,” head down to Slab City (a community using whatâs been left behind by others to create a free society that operates nearly independently). You can also enjoy dozens of amazing state and national parks, like Anza Borrego and Death Valley.\n\nThere are just endless ways to enjoy California as a solo traveler!\n\nREAD NEXT: A Localâs Guide to California\n\n2. Hawaiâi\n\nHawaiâi isnât typically what comes to mind when most people think of a solo trip. But I was so pleasantly surprised there that I genuinely think itâs perfect for first-time solo travelers!\n\nThanks to its rich culture and tropical climate, Hawaiâi feels more like a country of its own, with so many things to do that are totally solo friendly. You could drive along the Road to Hana, explore Lanai, or join the Maui Surfer Girls camp, designed specifically for solo female travelers who are looking for a supportive group of women to take up a new sport with. Itâs both empowering and fun!\n\nThe Big Island is especially suited for solo female travelers in Hawai’i because of the number of spiritual experiences there are, plus the rugged adventure youâll find.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Complete Guide to Hawai’i\n\n3. Canada\n\nCanada is world-renowned for having some of the friendliest people, so this comes as no surprise. Finding where to travel alone for the first time also often boils down to a nice balance of adventure and safety, and Canada is right at that intersection. I love MontrÃ©al for a winter weekend escape or QuÃ©bec for a fall road trip. If you want to experience the Canadian wilderness, head to Banff, where I found some of the most breathtaking hikes.\n\nSince Canada as a whole is such a stellar pick for solo travelers, it might be tough to choose where to go. I put together this list of the absolute must-visit spots to help narrow down your search.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Guide to Canada\n\n4. Mexico\n\nSome travelers are too quick to write off Mexico as unsuitable for female travelers, but I disagree. Mexico is an incredible place to travel solo for the first time, because itâs bursting with cultural richness, amazing food, and an astounding variety of landscapes. Its people are generally very warm and hospitable, making it a great place to meet locals and get to know the culture.\n\nIn Mexico, youâll find pristine beaches, beautiful mountain landscapes, crystal-clear cenotes (swimming holes), and fantastic cities to explore, like Oaxaca, San Miguel de Allende, San CristÃ³bal de las Casas, and many more.\n\nIf youâre concerned about staying safe as a solo female traveler in Mexico, I get it. With alarming stories on the news about violence there, it can be daunting to think about going alone. However, most of these stories come out of specific regions of the country that are far off the tourist track. This isnât to say that popular areas donât have risks, but there are plenty of ways to stay safe in Mexico as a solo female traveler.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Complete Guide to Mexico\n\n5. Costa Rica\n\nThere are few places on earth with as much biodiversity and an overall abundance of outdoorsy things to do as Costa Rica. Itâs also one of the best places in Latin America to travel as a solo female traveler because of how easy it is to meet others and how safe it is.\n\nFrom the thick green jungles of Costa Ricaâs interior to the golden beaches on both coasts, this is one of the places I will return to over and over again. Imagine going from a remote beach with rock arches one day to hiking to a gushing waterfall in the jungle the next. Plus, the national parks here are next-level. My favorites are Manuel Antonio National Park and Tortuguero National Park.\n\nCosta Rica is paradise on earth, and as a solo female traveler, itâs absolutely ideal.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Complete guide to Costa Rica\n\nSouth America\n\n6. Peru\n\nIf your heart is set on South America for your first solo trip, I recommend Peru. This incredibly diverse country will expose you to a variety of experiences, cultures, and especially climates. Iconic spots, such as Rainbow Mountain, Huacachina, the Peruvian Amazon, and the Inca Trail (and many other hiking trails), are absolutely gorgeous. I mean, they are all bucket-list worthy!\n\nAs most people visiting Peru end up at these sites, you will hardly be alone, so most tours are more than happy to welcome single supplements. Peru also has a vibrant backpacker scene, so itâs really easy to meet others at hostels and on tours.\n\nNote: My biggest piece of advice for you is that you learn a little Spanish. Donât expect locals to know English.\n\nAlso, Peruâs safety reputation isnât as great as the other countries on this list, but really, all you need to do is to exercise the same precautions as you do back home. Here are safety tips from 31 solo female travelers to get you started.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Complete Guide to Peru\n\nEurope\n\n7. Croatia\n\nCroatia is a country that is still somewhat on the rise among solo travelers, but I’m about to let you in on a little secret: it’s one of the most beautiful and underrated destinations in Europe. With its spectacular coastline, countless islands, and charming old towns, Croatia is a Mediterranean paradise. Oh, and did I mention that it’s one of the safest countries in Europe?\n\nThe locals in Croatia are friendly, speak English well, and are beyond excited to share their culture with you. It’s a great place to meet travelers backpacking through the Balkans, or as a base to explore the rest of Europe.\n\nWhile the entire country is beautiful and worth visiting, there are a few key places that I’d recommend if you’re solo traveling through Croatia and wanting to make new friends. These are the cities of Zagreb, where you’ll find the most expats and digital nomads, and Split, which has the most solo travelers.\n\nCroatia is a seasonal destination, so the best time to visit is from March to October.\n\nREAD NEXT: The 30 Cheapest Places to Travel in 2024\n\n8. Sweden\n\nI’ll admit that I really didn’t have high expectations of Sweden before I visited, but let me tell you, I was blown away! This stunning Scandinavian country has everything from picturesque landscapes to colorful cities to some surprisingly delicious food. Best of all, it is impeccably clean and very safe for solo travelers.\n\nOne of my favorite places to visit in Sweden is the capital city, Stockholm. Spread out over 14 islands connected by bridges, it is the epitome of charming. The historic center, Gamla Stan (Old Town), is the most vibrant area, with its multicolored buildings and narrow, cobblestone streets lined with quaint cafÃ©s and restaurants. If you visit Stockholm in August, you’ll get to experience the amazing summer street festivals!\n\nA huge bonus for Stockholm is its impressive public transportation system, including buses, trains, and ferries, which make it super easy to get around.\n\nREAD NEXT: 7 Reasons to Visit Swedish Lapland\n\n9. Slovenia\n\nSlovenia is a cozy little country in Central Europe that is safe and packed with an unbelievable amount of beauty. Not to mention it’s one of the cheapest countries in Europe. Plus, the locals are some of the most friendly and welcoming people I’ve ever met!\n\nIf there’s one thing you should know about Slovenia is that it’s a nature lover’s paradise. So if that’s you, Slovenia should definitely be on your radar. The country boasts the stunning Julian Alps, turquoise lakes, and lush green forests with endless hiking trails â ideal for making friends on the road!\n\nOne of my favorite sights in Slovenia is Lake Bled, a pretty lake surrounded by picturesque mountains with a charming church on an island in the center of it. Nearby is Vintgar Gorge, a narrow canyon with crystal-clear water and a wooden walkway that winds through the gorge. Finally, the capital of Ljubljana is a darling city with a river running through it, lined with bars, restaurants, and cafÃ©s.\n\nREAD NEXT: Best Places to Visit in Europe in the Summer\n\n10. The Netherlands\n\nAmsterdam is a fantastic first-time solo travel destination, because it is just so dang easy to navigate. Given its small size and well-connected public transportation system, getting from point A to point B couldn’t be easier. But beyond convenience, the city has so much to offer for solo travelers.\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice in Amsterdam is the friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The locals are known for being open-minded and easygoing, making it easy to strike up conversations with strangers or even make new friends along the way.\n\nThe city is incredibly bicycle-friendly, with designated lanes and rental options available on nearly every corner, which makes it one of the best ways to explore Amsterdam as a solo traveler, allowing you to see more of the city and explore its charming streets and canals. It can be a bit intimidating to bike in Amsterdam, though, if you’ve never done it before, so a guided bike tour will help you get comfortable with the city’s cycling culture.\n\nREAD NEXT: How to See the Tulips in Amsterdam\n\n11. Iceland\n\nGorgeous Iceland is an outdoorsy personâs dream. Plus, itâs been ranked as the safest country in the world several years running. This means that you (and your parents) can put your security worries aside.\n\nAnother thing you wouldnât have to worry about is getting lost. Most travelers in Iceland drive the Golden Circle or Ring Road, and while I think thatâs just right for a road trip with a buddy, itâs just as good solo too. If you donât feel like driving, the public transportation system is great as well.\n\nAdditionally, Iceland is delightfully intimate. With such a small population, it feels more like a big neighborhood where everybody knows everybody and thereâs so much trust that people donât even lock their cars when they grocery-shop. Almost everyone speaks English quite well too, so thereâs no language barrier either.\n\nThe only drawback is that Iceland is pretty expensive. You can cut your costs by staying in hostels and buying your own groceries. But Iâd say that Iceland is absolutely worth it if you can afford it!\n\nREAD NEXT: A Complete Guide to Iceland\n\n12. Germany\n\nGermany is my favorite country in Europe. I liked it so much that I moved to Berlin for five years. I think that the capital city in particular is ideal for first-time solo female travelers: there are so many things one can do alone, such as visiting galleries, joining an alternative street art tour, and shopping at flea markets. When youâve had enough of the artistic scene there, you can hop on a train to Spreewald or Stuttgart, or visit the castles in the rest of Baden-WÃ¼ttemberg and enjoy the beautiful nature Germany has to offer.\n\nThe country is safe, navigation is a breeze, English is widely spoken, the locals are generally helpful â Germany just checks all of the boxes for first-time solo travelers! I also really appreciate its cultural diversity, and for some reason, I feel like I can be 100% my true self there without being judged â and perhaps thatâs exactly what you are looking for for your trip.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Complete Guide to Germany\n\n13. Switzerland\n\nThe mountains help make Switzerland ideal for solo female travelers (not to mention that the country is considered safe too). Outdoorsy gals will love staying in little huts in the Alps owned by local families. While many places in Switzerland are pricey, hiking is free. If you donât want to hike in Switzerland alone, there are hostels where you can join a day trip. You absolutely must trek on the Edelweiss Trail, which gives you an awesome view of the Matterhorn.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Guide to Switzerland\n\n14. Ireland\n\nSome people may be surprised that Northern Ireland would be a good choice for solo female travelers, but itâs super safe now â “The Troubles” are in the past. Hospitality is one of Irelandâs strong suits. Irish people are so friendly and welcoming: you walk into a pub, and youâve made a roomful of friends.\n\nBelfast is a lot more manageable than Dublin for solo female travelers. Itâs just calmer and less overwhelming. When youâre by yourself, you donât need all the constant stimulation, and in Belfast, youâll feel more at ease.\n\nDonât miss the Titanic Museum there. I donât have much interest in the Titanic, but the museum was so well done and interesting and interactive!\n\nIf you can make it to western Ireland to see some natural beauty, definitely work that into your itinerary as well.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Guide to Ireland\n\n15. Spain\n\nThe beautiful architecture is the star of the show in Spain, especially in Granada. You donât need to be with anyone else to enjoy its cool mix of Eastern and Christian influences. You especially canât miss the Alhambra, a famous fortress originally constructed between 1238 and 1358.\n\nAlso, Granada is safer than Madrid and Barcelona, where you have to be constantly watching your back for pickpocketers.\n\nOther smaller cities are definitely worth checking out, like seaside MÃ¡laga, because theyâre just the right size for solo female travelers. Youâll be able to see more of those places without the greater safety risks of bigger cities.\n\n16. Finland\n\nFinland is a fantastic destination for first-time solo travelers, not only because of its beautiful scenery but also because itâs one of the safest places on earth to travel alone in. Crime rates in Finland are astonishingly low, the people are super friendly, and you donât have to know any Finnish, because most people speak great English.\n\nFrom idyllic cities like Helsinki to small coastal villages and wintry Nordic scenes, Finland is perfect for travelers who love the outdoors and donât mind chilly temps. Finnish Lapland is one of the best places to visit in Europe in the wintertime too, because of the unique celebrations in the region and the possibility of catching the northern lights.\n\n17. Portugal\n\nGorgeous cobblestone streets, astounding seaside views, and warm hospitality all keep solo travelers coming back to Portugal over and over again. As one of Europeâs most affordable countries, itâs become an excellent place for budget-conscious travelers as well. Pair that with delicious food and wine, and stunning landscapes, and youâve got yourself a world-class travel destination fit for adventurous women.\n\nLike most of Europe, pickpockets are common in bigger cities like Lisbon and Porto, but overall, crime is still quite low here. Plus, Portuguese people tend to be friendly and willing to help visitors, so even if youâre alone, you donât have to feel alone.\n\nAsia\n\n18. Thailand\n\nIt should not come as a surprise that the Land of Smiles has earned a place on this list â itâs the perfect spot to âtest the water.â Thailand is friendly, affordable, easy to travel through, and full of other travelers and delicious food. There are multiple daily flights from all over the world arriving in Bangkok, the countryâs capital, sending new and seasoned backpackers, budget and luxury travelers, fresh grads, retirees, solo travelers (like you!), and tour groups on an epic journey around the country.\n\nI recommend beginning in Bangkok and learning how to fall in love with the city, or starting off in Chiang Mai up north, where there are so many things to do, like cooking courses and temples, and playing with elephants ethically.\n\nNext, head south and go scuba diving off one of the many gorgeous islands, some of which are well known and some of which are lesser known, or even participate in a 10-day silent meditation retreat.\n\nIf you end up loving your experience in Thailand, it is so easy to extend your journey and explore nearby countries by plane, train, or bus.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Complete Guide to Thailand\n\n19. Malaysia\n\nMalaysia is often overlooked as a travel destination in favor of its neighbors â and to me, thatâs mind-boggling! As a multicultural country, the locals generally speak at least two languages, and English is usually one of them. I personally never had a problem with communication when traveling there. In fact, having a common language helped me have more interaction with locals in Malaysia, including participating in events and being invited to family celebrations.\n\nLike in Thailand, you can have all kinds of travel experiences in Malaysia, from cities and small towns to beaches and mountains. I also think, when it comes to islands, diving, and off-the-beaten-path experiences, itâs hard to beat Malaysia, both the peninsular part and Borneo.\n\nSo if you are hoping for an interesting cultural experience minus the language barrier on your first solo trip abroad, Malaysia could be the ideal choice.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Complete Guide to Malaysia\n\n20. Japan\n\nJapan is one of the cleanest, safest, most polite, and most organized countries Iâve ever visited. It was also one of the most unique in terms of culture, food, and the delightful mastery of technology in everything from art museums to bathrooms. Plus, cities like Tokyo and Kyoto are some of the most interesting in the world and are great to visit any time of year, even in the dead of winter.\n\nI should warn you that language will be a problem at some point. I got pretty confused at the train stations, as some signs are only in Japanese. And since English isnât commonly spoken, it was challenging at times to communicate with some hotel staff and restaurant waiters. However, you can always rely on apps to navigate and use the classic âpoint and nodâ method to order your food. All that said, people are so kind and friendly, the language barrier wasnât as stressful as it can be elsewhere.\n\nIf you are traveling solo for the first time, the idea of sleeping in a hostel room can be daunting. In Japan, you can opt for a capsule hotel, which is very similar to a hostel, except that your bed space is much more confined, and your personal space is respected. Eating alone is not only acceptable but a norm in Japan, so itâs an awesome place to do that, especially if thatâs usually intimidating to you.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Solo Female Travel Guide to Japan\n\n21. Singapore\n\nYouâve never been to anywhere cleaner than Singapore, I guarantee it! There are so many rules â no littering, spitting, or chewing gum â and they enforce them. It does, however, make it nice to walk around. Also, English is one of the main languages there, so you can communicate just fine, making this a great pick for solo female travelers.\n\nYou absolutely must see Supertree Grove. It has giant trees that light up at night, synched to music. Plus, itâs open all the time. I had no reservations about going there at 4 a.m. â Singapore is that safe.\n\nSingapore gets a reputation for being ungodly expensive, but some careful planning focused on free activities in Singapore will help you save money. You can also find more info on traveling in Singapore like a local here.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Guide to Singapore\n\n22. Bali, Indonesia\n\nBali is heaven for first-time solo travelers. Not only is it a super safe destination, it is also cheap and incredibly beautiful. I absolutely fell in love with it the first time I visited â I mean, how could you not? The postcard-worthy rice terraces, intricate temples, epic cafÃ© scene, and breathtaking sunsets are just a few reasons why I adore Bali, not to mention the friendly residents.\n\nThe best place to stay in Bali for first time travelers, especially those who are also digital nomads, is in Canggu. Located on the southwest coast, this area is packed with opportunities for socializing. You’ll find countless beach clubs, gyms, cafÃ©s, co-working spaces, and restaurants catering to every tastebud. To be right in the heart of the action, make sure to book accommodation in the Batu Balong neighborhood.\n\nOther great places to visit in Bali as a solo traveler include Ubud, Uluwatu, Sanur, and the Gili Islands.\n\nREAD NEXT: The Best Vegan Eats in Bali\n\nOceania\n\n23. New Zealand\n\nIf you are under the age of 30 and planning a working holiday, New Zealand may end up being the destination of your first solo trip abroad! Many people use this opportunity to explore the country on their days off or after finishing up work contracts, and as New Zealand makes for an awesome road trip, I highly recommend gathering 3-4 people and renting a camper van for a drive around both islands.\n\nEven if you are not considering the working-holiday opportunity, New Zealand is still terrific for first-time solo travelers, especially if you are comfortable driving long distances. You could take buses and trains, which are generally convenient and inexpensive, but to get to off-beat places, a car is much more ideal. Itâs also the best way to find all these amazing views. Navigation is fairly easy, and Kiwis (New Zealanders) are incredibly friendly and helpful. Find more info on road-tripping New Zealand here.\n\nPerhaps the best thing to do is to stay in a social hostel for your first couple of days and look for a road-trip buddy â just because you set off on this trip alone, it doesnât mean that you need to be by yourself the entire time!\n\nREAD NEXT: A Complete Guide to New Zealand\n\nAfrica\n\n24. Botswana\n\nWant your first solo trip memories to be filled with wild elephants? Botswanaâs the answer, as it has more than anywhere else in Africa. In fact, itâs my favorite country for wildlife viewing out of all of the African nations Iâve traveled to so far. It is slightly more expensive than other countries on the continent, but itâs also one of the safest, and has decent roads and a great safari lodge system as well. It is also quite the perfect place to try out glamping, especially since the cost of private accommodations may not differ much from that of basic dorms.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Guide to Botswana\n\n25. Namibia\n\nNamibia has a special warmth â both temperature-wise and people-wise. In the summertime, itâs in the 80s or 90s, and thereâs so much to do. The place is an adventure junkieâs dream!\n\nGo sandboarding if you visit Namibia. Itâs like snowboarding, but down a sand dune. Iâd only gone snowboarding once in my life and told the guy how terrified I was â but I was fine. The sand is really soft, and it doesnât hurt to fall.\n\nThe country is surprisingly a wonderful place for a road trip â you can read all about mine here. Youâll also see plenty of wildlife in Namibia, along with some amazing astrophotography opportunities.\n\nREAD NEXT: A Guide to Namibia\n\n***\n\nI hope this guide has inspired you to finally take that first step into solo travel and visit one of the many incredible places on this list!\n\nWhich destination will you travel to first?"
