        "text": "If you are just starting out in the music business, you may be wondering whether it is better to go solo or join a band. There are so many variables that need consideration, so perhaps it’s better to understand the pros and cons of each. Both have their advantages, but one will be a better fit for you. So then, how can you determine which is right for you? The following information should make it easier for you to decide.\n\nThere Will Always Be a Band\n\nBefore going any further, the one thing to consider is that solo artists always have a backup band. It’s highly unusual to see a singer step out on stage to sing a cappella. In fact, have you ever seen a performance without instrumental backup? Therefore, it is important to understand that a band is a necessary component of a musical performance.\n\nThis is something singers typically consider when discovering whether they want to be a solo act or part of a band. Although some guitarists and keyboard players can perform solo, these are usually within the classical field and often have an orchestra or band behind them. Even that solo singer will have accompaniment so it may be better to work with a group than find a new band for every performance. That can be pretty disconcerting if not highly unlikely.\n\nPersonalities Matter\n\nWith that out of the way, the next thing to consider is that personalities can clash and have often been the ultimate demise of extremely popular bands. It has been rumored that Steve Perry left Journey because of artistic and business clashes with other members of the group, and it was highly publicized that the same held true of the Beatles breaking up at the pinnacle of their careers.\n\nIf you have decided that you want to be part of a band rather than going it solo, you may be wondering how to join a band. With the possibility of personalities clashing, it’s important to learn a few tips for joining a band. That link leads you to an insightful blog on how to find members of a band. The website is for PIRATE studios located in four countries to date including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Ireland. If anyone knows musicians and what it takes to work solo or with a band, these would be the experts who have seen it all.\n\nExactly What Is Your Talent?\n\nAs mentioned above, the important factor in deciding whether you want a solo career or to join a band would ultimately lie in your talent. It would be ludicrous to find a drummer seeking a solo career whereas a rapper might very well do better on their own.\n\nThe same holds true of the genre in which your talent lies. A concert violinist might very well work as a soloist even when working with the New York Philharmonic, for example. Look at keyboard artists such as Kitaro who made an entire career as a solo performer. Yes, he had backup instrumentation and vocals in many of his pieces, but he simply was known and loved for being a performer in the New Age genre, Kitaro.\n\nWhen You Want to Join a Band\n\nAgain, it is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of joining a band. As part of a whole, you will lose that element of autonomy and all decisions are made with the band in mind. Whether they are business decisions or creative undertakings, it’s all or nothing. When one member seeks to ‘rule the roost’ there will invariably be tensions, some of which may never be overcome.\n\nTherefore, when you have decided that joining a band is in your best interest as an artist, it is important to get a feel for the various personalities before signing on. This can be a life-changing move on your part, and theirs as well, so make sure there is a connection prior to making that commitment. Once personalities are out of the way, it’s time to move forward to musical direction.\n\nBook Practice Sessions to See If You ‘Click’\n\nRehearsal studios like those mentioned above can help everyone determine if they are well-suited to working together. They may have conflicting personalities which would be the ultimate demise of a group but what about musical direction? The only way to determine if members of a band are in sync when performing is to actually perform in a session or two.\n\nBear in mind that rehearsal studios such as those mentioned are also equipped with self-serve recording and mixing technology. At this point you can record what you are playing which will, in turn, give you a better look at how you will sound when playing live.\n\nWhy Can’t You Do Both?\n\nUnless members of the band sign a contract worded such that they are unable to perform solo, there is no reason why you can’t do both. This will also refer back to those personalities that are often in question, but many bands are fine with members branching out on their own solo careers at the same time as being a member of that band. There are many post-band solo artists who have made it big on their own, but there is always the possibility to work solo without giving up their part in the band.\n\nSome bands may not want a solo career to overshadow the fame of the band, but a solo performer who tops the charts on solo numbers can also bring a higher level of fame to the entire band. As you can see, there is much to think about when deciding whether to go solo or join a band. It’s not a decision you can make lightly, but once you’ve chosen your path, the road will become clearer. With that said, remember that as a solo performer you will always need a band. The deciding factor will be whether you want the same people backing you up or do you want to chance working with new artists over time. That should be your ultimate priority. So, which is it for you?"
