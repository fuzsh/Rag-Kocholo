These help me earn a small commission at no additional charge to you.\n\nVIETNAM ESSENTIALS\n\nE-sim data plan\n\nCopy of Lonely Planet Vietnam\n\nBook buses and trains in Vietnam: 12GoAsia\n\nPre-book your Hanoi airport to city transfer\n\nAccommodation: Browse hotels on Booking.com // hostels on Hostelworld\n\nTours: GetYourGuide / Viator\n\nSIM card: Vietnam e-SIM / Asialink card (18 countries)\n\nTravel insurance: True Traveller (European travellers) / Hey Mundo (other nationalities) / Safety Wing (digital nomads)\n\nEssential reading: 101 Southeast Asia travel tips\n\nRead next: the ultimate Vietnam travel itinerary for 2 weeks – 1 month\n\nHow to get around Vietnam\n\nHow to get around within cities/towns\n\nHere are some safe ways for solo female travellers to get around in Vietnam…\n\nLocal bus: in bigger cities like Hanoi, you can ride the local bus. Tickets cost from 7,000 to 15,000 VND and should be paid to the driver in cash. Make sure to have small notes as they may not have change.\n\nLocal taxi: when getting in taxis, agree a price beforehand or insist the metre is on. Occasionally, rigged metres are a thing so if it starts jumping up wildly, get out.\n\nTaxi app: my preferred way to travel was by Grab taxi, Asia’s answer to Uber.\n\nTaxi app scooters: if you’re feeling confident, select a scooter on Grab rather than a car. A driver will arrive and should have a helmet for you (please insist that they do!). Although you’ll often see whole families on one scooter, Grab drivers will only accept one passenger per scooter.\n\nBest places for solo travel in Vietnam\n\nNext for the fun bit, where to go and what to do when travelling alone in Vietnam!\n\nHue\n\nA lovely stop between Hoi An and Hanoi is the city of Hue, once the imperial capital of Vietnam. The citadel may have been destroyed during the War with America and China (you may know it as the Vietnam War) but it’s been restored, boasting some of the most beautiful temples in Asia!\n\nIf you’re not all templed-out after the Citadel, don’t miss the Temple of Literature and Linh Mu Pagoda on the Perfume Riverbank, the Royal Temple of Tu Duc, Tu Hieu Pagoda, Minh Mang Tomb and the Khai Dinh Tomb. Hue is a history lover’s dream!\n\nTwo days in Hue is a good amount of time to spend because you can spend one day at the Citadel and other temples, then another day visiting the quirky Abandoned Waterpark (the first photo in this blog with the roaring dragon statue) with time for another historic stop in the afternoon.\n\nHanoi\n\nSapa\n\nSaigon (Ho Chi Minh)\n\nHarder places to travel solo in Vietnam (and how to do it anyway)\n\nThese are places that are great for solo female travel in Vietnam but require a little research…\n\nHa Long Bay\n\nNinh Binh\n\nRead next: 101 travel tips for backpacking Southeast Asia\n\nAccommodation for solo travellers in Vietnam\n\nSafety tips for Vietnam\n\nDon’t carry too much cash: Vietnam is largely a cash-based society. But be smart, for example, don’t do what I did in 2015 and get £100 from the ATM en route to a night out (spoiler: I did not come home with it). Try to withdraw on your way to your accommodation, leave it there (in a hostel locker) and take out roughly what you’ll need for the day or evening.\n\nWear a secure bag: Shoulder bags that can easily be pulled off by a passing moped aren’t a great idea in Vietnam. It’s fine to carry non-valuable items like this but I would recommend also wearing a cross-body bag with your money and phone.\n\nDo your research: this is a tip for solo female travel in Vietnam but also everywhere. Doing your research about a place before arriving saves you unpleasant surprises or hiccups when you get there. Just by reading this blog, I can tell you’re already doing this!\n\nSafety tips for scooter hire\n\nRiding a scooter is a way of life in Vietnam. Sure, accidents happen and perhaps it’s safer to not ride one at all… but that’s not really practical advice! There are more scooters in Vietnam than people. From locals (who start riding as kids) to tourists, they’re everywhere.\n\nJust make sure you:\n\nWear a helmet\n\nDon’t listen to music while driving\n\nNever drink and drive!\n\nAssess your vehicle before leaving the rental place and take photos of any dents or scratches. This is less of a safety tip and more to ensure you don’t get ripped off!\n\nIf you don’t feel comfortable driving, don’t. It’s usually very affordable to call Grab scooters or, in rural areas, hire a driver for the day. Plus, it’s great business for the locals! I wouldn’t ever advise driving in Hanoi or Saigon unless you have years of scooter experience under your belt."
