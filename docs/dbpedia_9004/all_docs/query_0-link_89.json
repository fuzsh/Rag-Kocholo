        "text": "Solo dance is an opportunity for skaters to ice dance on their own without a partner and is open to skaters of all ages and ice dance levels, from preliminary to gold and international. Solo dance events – both pattern and free dances – are available at nonqualifying competitions across the country.\n\nSolo dance events include:\n\nSolo Pattern Dance\n\nShadow Dance (two skaters skate a pattern dance side by side)\n\nCombined Dance (one solo pattern dance or rhythm dance and one solo free dance)\n\nSolo Dance Series\n\nThe Solo Dance Competition Series was launched in January 2011. This program serves as a membership and dance discipline development tool, and is open to individual skaters within the Eastern, Midwestern and Pacific Coast sections. Skaters can choose to register for the Solo Dance Competition Series where they have the opportunity to qualify for a national final based off their IJS scores at designated solo dance series competitions. The Solo Dance Competition Series provides an avenue for ice dancers at the standard levels to qualify and compete at the National Solo Dance Final.\n\nCreated to be a fun, nationwide competitive program, the solo dance series allows skaters to expand their competitive opportunities and encourages those new to ice dancing to give it a try.\n\nSkaters must register for the series April 1 or prior to the skater’s first approved series competition, whichever comes first. A skater’s level is based upon their test level as of the series deadline of April 1 or when the skater submits their registration to participate in the series, whichever date is earlier.\n\nSkaters must compete in at least two competitions and will be ranked based on their highest IJS score. Top finishers in each section for each event will be invited to participate in the National Solo Dance Final.\n\nLog in to the Members Only site to find technical updates and more information on solo dance.\n\nMost Recent Updates\n\nClick Here For The 2025 Solo Dance Series Pattern Dances.\n\nClick Here For A Clarification Regarding The Paso Doble Shadow Cross Tracking Rules.\n\nImportant Clarification (May 13, 2024): For the Tango Variation Dance, the Rule states the skater must do A Steps which would normally include a 3 turn at the end of the pattern prior to doing the Variation, but the pattern shows the new A Steps used when two sequences are done so a skater can transition into the B Steps. Since we didn't notice these conflicting Rules until after the season started, we will accept either the A Steps with the 3 turn or without prior to starting the Variation sequence.\n\nClick Here For A List Of Changes To The 2024 Solo Dance Handbook.\n\nClick Here For The 2024 Solo Dance Handbook.
