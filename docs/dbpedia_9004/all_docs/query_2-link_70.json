        "text": "How to ensure you book a high quality artist\n\nAll of the solo artists, duos and trios on the Alive Network web site have been carefully pre-vetted and they represent the very best of what's available to hire for private events in the UK. We have selected our artist roster from literally thousands of applications so in order to ensure quality, all you need to do is choose a band from our web site. It's risk free and you have peace of mind that we've already done the hard work for you.\n\nIf you do choose to look around elsewhere, here's what you should look for:\n\n1. A reliable fixed line up of musicians\n\nSomething which we try our best to be strict about is ensuring that the artists we represent maintain a fixed regular line up of members, especially with regards to vocalists. We want our customers to have the same singer turn up and perform at their event that they booked from our web site. If you look at artists outside of the Alive Network agency, be sure to ask (and have written into your contract) that the singer who will perform at your event will be the same one that you've been looking at prior to booking.\n\nOur booking contracts only allow members to be swapped where there is a force majeure emergency, or where the act has made it clear in their advertising that they use a number of different members. It's actually quite common for duos or trios to use a selection of musicians in order to maintain their availability, and this is unlikely to impact on the quality of their performance, but it's important that you the customer know what you're booking. In particular, with singers, customers often book an act based on liking the singer, so where as it might not matter much to you if the drummer or bass player change, it will probably matter much more if the singer is swapped out â especially if youâve booked a solo singer or duo!!\n\nSome unscrupulous artists and agencies accept bookings only to subcontract them on to an entirely different artist who is told to turn up and perform under their name. To be sure you're getting a professional artist who won't let you down, book them through Alive Network!\n\n2. A great demo CD / MP3s\n\nThe artistâs music recordings should be in time, in tune, and sound well produced (it should sound like a high quality recording). It's also important that you can hear in advance that the artist plays the kind of music you want at your event! Compare recordings against other acts to get a good idea of how well they stack up.\n\n3. Great photos\n\nBeing able to see that the artist has made the effort to present themselves professionally shows you they are serious and care about what they do. It will also help you to decide if they fit the theme and mood of your event.\n\n4. Customer reviews and testimonials\n\nMake sure you can read genuine reviews from previous customers. You'll find lots of customer reviews for our solo artists, duos and trios readily available here on the Alive Network web site.\n\n5. Equipment\n\nThe artist should use professional quality PA, instruments, amplifiers and microphones. The better the equipment, the more reliable it will be, and the better they'll sound at your event. Most smaller format acts don't need large PA systems, especially if they donât use live drums, and unless you're booking them for an evening event they probably won't provide stage lighting.\n\n6. Experience and background\n\nCheck that the act consists of high calibre musicians with a strong track record of playing at private events. Review the experience of individual players as well as the experience of the act as a whole. There's nothing wrong with booking a great 'new' artist - but you would expect to pay a little less for an act with no track record. Experienced artists who are 'in demand' charge a little more but they bring a wealth of experience and ideas to the table.\n\n7. The backing of a reliable agency\n\nNo agent, no backup if anything goes wrong. If you book an artist 'directly' and they let you down either intentionally or unintentionally, you'll be completely on your own trying to find a last minute replacement. This would not be fun on the day of your wedding / event!\n\nAlive Network offers 24 hour-a-day emergency cover, 365 days of the year - with 1000's of artists to fall back on.\n\nLook for an agency that responds quickly, efficiently, and takes the time to listen to your individual requirements. They will be your point of contact so you need to be happy that they're providing a high quality service too. If you're looking at companies online, make sure that they clearly advertise their contact details and address (not a PO Box) and that they actually are a real business (as opposed to website run out of a bedroom).\n\nAlive Network is the largest entertainment agency in the UK, specialising in live entertainment for private events. We've been in business since 1999 and have booked bands for tens of thousands of events - something which you don't get to do without offering a reliable service that customers are happy to recommend.\n\n8. Cost\n\nYou get what you pay for, so don't cut corners unless you don't mind risking the success of your event. We represent thousands of musicians, all of whom define their own fees, so our prices are a good indicator of what's usual to pay.\n\nThe average costs of solo artists, duos and trios in 2016 was between Â£450 - Â£800.\n\nInterestingly, many popular solo artists command fees roughly in-line with duos and trios!\n\nWhat exactly will a solo artist, duo or trio do at my event? What will the format be?\n\nAlmost every act in this category share one common format - they are very compact! Many soloists might come with just themselves, their instrument and a small PA unit. A trio party band will often require less space than their four-person counterparts.\n\nSome solo acts offer the option of expanding the line-up if you require, especially tribute solo acts. A solo tribute singer may perform with high quality backing tracks, but for a more exciting live experience they might offer the option of a full band. Equally, you might find familiar faces from top function bands performing as solo artists, such as Happy Hourâs frontman Richie.\n\nMany acts are also happy to provide two totally different styles of entertainment at the same event. So, for example, a solo guitarist could play romantic acoustic music for your wedding ceremony, then entertain at the drinks reception with contemporary classics or your favourite songs. In fact, many solo, duo and trio acts offer both amplified and acoustic options, making them ideal for venues with strict sound volume requirements, or for a gentler and relaxed ambience.\n\nEither way, your artist can be booked to arrive at a time to suit you, and theyâll need to set up their equipment where required. To unload, set up and sound check takes on average 60 minutes. This time is important if you want the artist to sound good as levels will need to be balanced correctly. Usually they will play background music from a laptop or iPod whilst they get changed and ready for their performance.\n\nIf your event is a wedding or includes a sit down meal, it is usual that set-up and sound check would happen after the meal whilst the room is cleared, and whilst guests leave the room to get drinks and stretch their legs. If you would prefer the artist to be set up before guests arrive, this can be arranged but usually costs more because of the extra time involved.\n\nFor evening engagements the artistâs first live performance would usually commence about 8.30pm and last 1 hour. They would then take a break until the next set is required. If a wedding, this usually covers the time when the evening buffet is served or when the cake is cut. During this time the artist would play background music from a laptop or iPod.\n\nThe second live performance would then usually start around 10.30pm lasting 1 hour until 11.30pm, plus hopefully a few encores!\n\nWhen the performance is finished, the artist will usually play more background music from their iPod until the contracted finish time.\n\nMost artists will leave this music running whilst they dismantle their equipment at the end of the night.\n\nThe artist should start loading their equipment back into their vehicle only after the agreed contract finish time. It takes around 45 minutes to pack down and load out.\n\nWhat equipment will the artist provide?\n\nThis depends on the type of act you are booking, but most will be completely self-contained in terms of PA, instruments, microphones, lighting and either a laptop or iPod to play background music through their PA between performances. Most solo artists, duos and trio acts keep their kit to a minimum so they can be flexible and adapt to different spaces easily.\n\nAlthough there is a difference between the size of PA systems used by the various artists we represent, they should all bring a PA system suitable for up to 150 people, which covers most private parties and weddings. Artists with larger PA systems won't necessarily turn them up any louder but the option is there if needed, and larger systems usually sound better. Looking at the size and quality of their PA and lighting systems is a good way to judge value for money between several artists. Ask your Alive Network co-ordinator if you need help with this.\n\nImportant note: If your event will have more than 150 people (or if the room where the artist will perform holds significantly more than 150 people) it's worth remembering that a larger PA system will need to be considered and you should discuss this with your coordinator. As a guide, you need roughly 10 watts per person, so a 300 capacity room will ideally require a 3000 watt (3K) PA system. Most of our artists can arrange larger PA if required, for an additional cost.\n\nPianos at venues\n\nSolo pianists will usually bring their own digital piano out of choice, as it can be moved anywhere, played inside or out, and fits in the back of a car! If your venue has a real piano that is well cared for and regularly tuned, most pianists are happy to play it, but it will need to be professionally tuned on the day. If looks are important, some solo pianists come with a digital piano and a false piano shell, which gives the look of a baby grand piano without the associated moving costs!\n\nChairs\n\nYour performers may also require chairs to sit on. If so, make sure they are sturdy, comfortable chairs like dining chairs or conference chairs, but not the type with arms or plastic stacking chairs.\n\nOutside events\n\nIf your event involves playing outside, you should provide some form of shelter in case of an unexpected shower, and equally to protect expensive instruments from direct sunlight.\n\nAre there any options available to customise my artistâs performance?\n\nDifferent artists offer different options, but common choices include the addition of extra members, additional sets of live music, a full DJ service or extra PA/lighting. The options available for each artist are shown on their profile page and are selectable when you make an online enquiry.\n\nIf you have a particular theme in mind, most artists will make an effort to meet it, either matching repertoire or clothing. It is best to specify exactly what you want when you make the booking to be sure your chosen band can definitely accommodate.\n\nRequests\n\nNearly all our solo artists, duos and trios will be happy to customise their usual set-list based on your requests. Most artists perform a standard repertoire of songs for private events, carefully tailored over time to feature the songs that best suit their strengths, and which work as a cohesive performance. They'll know based on experience which songs suit a given occasion, and will often adapt their repertoire on the fly as they judge the atmosphere of your event.\n\nA full two-hour performance might contain between 30 to 40 songs, but if you look at the full repertoire list on their profile page it will likely contain upwards of 60 songs, often many more. This gives you a little leeway to guide the artist in the direction of your personal favourites.\n\nPlease do bear in mind that building a repertoire isn't like building a playlist on your iPhone. In a live set some songs do not work well next to each other due to the key the singer may need to sing in, or the general dynamic flow of the performance. Whilst the artist will welcome your input and will be keen to ensure their performance meets your requirements, you must allow them to build the final repertoire themselves, based on your feedback.\n\nSome artists may also learn new pieces of music for you (for example a first dance) but there is often an additional fee for this to cover rehearsal time.\n\nHow do I make a booking?\n\nTo make an enquiry simply submit an enquiry form from the artists profile page on our web site (click the 'add to basket' button and follow the instructions) or give us a call on 01782 740 839.\n\nOnce we have all your event details we will contact the artist to confirm their availability, discuss any requests you might have made, and get a confirmed quote.\n\nOnce your Alive Network coordinator sends you a confirmed quote and you're happy with it, simply let them know that you'd like to secure a booking with the artist. You can do this via phone or email. They will contact the artist to confirm the booking based on the quote submitted.\n\nYou will then be required to pay a deposit, usually over the phone by credit card, and we will send you and the artist a booking confirmation form which shows exactly what you've both agreed to and all your event logistics.\n\nOnce we've sent you the booking confirmation, both you and the artist have 48 hours in which to cancel the agreement should you no longer wish to go ahead, otherwise your booking is in place and is non-cancellable.\n\nIf you need to discuss any aspect of your booking, or if you need to make any changes, your dedicated Alive Network coordinator will be on hand to support you as much as you need.\n\nYou will be put in touch with the artist approximately 3-4 weeks before your event to run over the arrangements, fine tune the details and make any changes necessary.\n\nUseful links\n\nView our full roster of solo artists, duos and trios"
