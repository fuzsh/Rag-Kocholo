        "text": "Angel Olsen is ready to look backward. The indie-rock singer-songwriter has announced a short North American solo tour that she’s calling Songs From the Archive Tour. As the name suggests, Olsen will revisit songs and deep cuts from across her catalog for the shows, from Strange Cacti to Big Time. See the complete list of tour dates below.\n\nThe Songs From the Archive Tour includes just 10 dates at the moment, most of which are in smaller cities and towns Olsen hasn’t visited in years. These intimate shows kick off in Sonoma, California, on September 8 and bring her to Wisconsin, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, and New York. The tour comes to an end later that month on September 30 in Red Bank, New Jersey. Opening select shows are Greg Mendez, Maxim Ludwig, Runo Plum, and Kyle Ryan.\n\nRevisit the interview “Angel Olsen on Grief, Coming Out, and Making a Country Album.”\n\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
