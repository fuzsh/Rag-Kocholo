        "text": "Jung Kook’s coronation on the Billboard Hot 100 with “Seven” (featuring Latto) is a win for BTS, too.\n\nAs the song launches at No. 1 (on the chart dated July 29), BTS now boasts two members who have led the list as soloists. Jimin debuted atop the Hot 100 in April with “Like Crazy.”\n\nBTS, thus, joins a select number of groups with multiple members who have notched solo No. 1 hits on the Hot 100.\n\nAs noted below, The Beatles initiated the elite category and remain the only act with as many as four Hot 100-topping soloists. Genesis follows with three.\n\nMeanwhile, with BTS having logged six Hot 100 No. 1s and Jung Kook and Jimin with one No. 1 each, BTS joins The Beatles, The Black Eyed Peas, Destiny’s Child and Genesis as the only groups with leaders and multiple members also with No. 1s.\n\nFurther, One Direction and BTS are the only acts with multiple members that have each debuted atop the Hot 100, thanks to Zayn’s “Pillowtalk,” Harry Styles’ “As It Was” and Jimin and Jung Kook’s leaders. Plus, with five of BTS’ No. 1s having premiered at the pinnacle, BTS is the only act that has debuted at No. 1 and includes multiple members also to have opened at the summit."
