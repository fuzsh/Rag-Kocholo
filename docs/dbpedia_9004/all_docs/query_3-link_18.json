        "text": "At the top of the list as one of the best first time solo travel destinations is Bali, Indonesia. This is the perfect introduction to South East Asia as it’s very catered to Westerners, while still holding the essence of Balinese charm. Bali has the perfect mix of surf, amazing cafes, temples, incredible nature and the friendliest locals, while also being a very affordable option to choose.\n\nBali is particularly perfect if you want an introduction to South East Asia and you’re not sure where to begin. Balinese people speak amazing English and because it’s so popular with tourists, you’ll have no problem finding other solo travellers to connect with during your time here to explore the island.\n\nIn Bali, you can find cascading waterfalls, rice terraces that stretch out over the hills, jungles, and beaches built from a surfer’s dream. Bali also has another side to it, made for the beach clubgoers, daily brunch girls and ravers. So whether you’re a yoga lover or all night partier, Bali is very diverse in what it offers solo travellers.\n\nThe south of Bali is the most popular area where you’ll find other travellers, however, because Bali is so safe you can easily explore the whole island and go off the tourist trail very easily. For more places in Indonesia that are great for solo travellers, you can also check out Nusa Penida, Gili Trawangan (Gili T), Lombok and even the Komodo Islands.\n\nBali is the perfect mix of culture, nature, good food and affordable!\n\nAffordability: Inexpensive\n\nBali has a lot of different areas on offer to explore. The main spots tourists tend to stay are:\n\nUbud\n\nCanggu\n\nSanur\n\nUluwatu\n\nSeminyak\n\nAll these locations are in the south of the island and are only a couple of hours from each other. To get around Bali there’s an app called Gojek (similar to Uber), which you can use for rides within Bali. Or opt for hiring a motorbike, which is very inexpensive and a lot of fun.\n\nCanggu and Ubud are my personal favourites out of these areas, and some great hostel recommendations are Farm Hostel in Canggu and Puri Garden Hostel in Ubud.\n\nNew Zealand is a bucket list place for so many people and it’s the perfect destination for solo travellers. The country is so diverse with impeccable nature and adrenaline filled activities, making it an unbelievable beginner friendly solo travel destination. While it’s a great solo travel country, your suspicions are correct, New Zealand is very expensive to travel. To combat the high pricetags attached to travelling to New Zealand, a lot of solo travellers opt to do a year working holiday. The best part is, it’s very easy to obtain a working holiday visa. You can read more about them here.\n\nWhile New Zealand is a small country, it has a lot to offer, especially for nature lovers. From its pristine glaciers, mountains, rainforests, beaches, and Fiords to the bustling cityscapes, there is so much to choose from in New Zealand. Not only does it have endless activities to enjoy, it’s incredibly safe for solo travellers, and there is a great backpacker scene all year round!\n\nThe best way to travel around New Zealand is either by renting a van (Jucy is one of the most popular companies to do this) or a hop-on hop-off bus. Check out Kiwi Experience for a great backpacker friendly option (that’s also great for first time solo travellers)!\n\nNew Zealand is great for nature lovers and adrenaline junkies\n\nAffordability: Expensive\n\nBudapest is one of the best cities in Europe for solo travel. Safe, bustling with things to do and an amazing atmosphere, it’s hard not to love Hungary’s capital. For first time solo travellers, Budapest offers a great mix of activities while still being affordable. Whether you’re interested in checking out the vibrant party culture or you want to delve more into the interesting history of Hungary, there is plenty to do in the city that can easily fill up your days and nights.\n\nSome of the best things to do in the city that you definitely can’t miss out on (and that are great for solo travellers) is: Budapest’s famous thermal baths (Szechinyi and Géllert are the most famous), Climb St. Stephen’s Basilica, river cruise down the Danube and checking out the Jewish Quarter/District 7. These activities are great for getting an overview of the city, and they aren’t expensive!\n\nBudapest has a lot of ground to cover in the day and also comes alive at night time. If you love a night out, this is the place to come, even when solo travelling. Budapest has some of the best bars and clubs in Europe, while also having great, social party hostels to tie the whole experience together.\n\nHungary’s capital really has it all. When I was 21 I spent a summer working at a hostel in Budapest and completely fell in love with what the city has to offer. For more information about my experience, you can read about here.\n\nBudapest is great for culture, food, nightlife and history.\n\nAffordability: Inexpensive\n\nIf warm weather, beautiful beaches, great cafe culture and endless pastel de natas sound right up your alley, then Portugal is perfect for you. Portugal is incredibly safe, easily accessible and a very affordable European solo travel destination. There is a lot to discover within Portugal, whether you’re a city girl or a nature lover.\n\nFor first time solo travellers, especially those who may be a little nervous/apprehensive, Lisbon is a great city to start off with. Although it’s a capital city, it doesn’t feel the same level of intensity as other large capitals, for example, Paris or Rome. Instead, everything is very walkable, with a low crime rate and plenty to see along the way. Making it a perfect first stop on your solo travel adventures.\n\nUnlike other places in Western Europe, Portugal retains being very affordable for a visit, and is great for a long weekend! Especially with the affordable flights you can find from the UK and Europe. It’s to be expected that Lisbon is more expensive than other parts of the country, but I was really pleasantly surprised by how affordable I found Porto.\n\nPorto and the Algarve are also great options for first time travellers, and Portugal is very easy to travel around via trains or buses. Book buses on Omio and trains on Trainline!\n\nPortugal is ideal for great weather, relaxed vibes and friendly locals. Plus it’s very easily accessible and Portuguese people have great English!\n\nAffordability: Midrange\n\nThailand is by far one of the best choices for a first time solo travel destination. The country is rich in culture, while also being safe for travellers, very affordable, friendly locals and incredibly easy to navigate. Much like Bali, this is a great introduction to South East Asia. In Thailand a lot of locals speak amazing English, so you can really get a taste of the local culture while not feeling ridiculously overwhelmed.\n\nThailand is very easy to get around, with a great connection of ferries, trains and buses. And also very affordable domestic flights! Sticking to the typical tourist routes through the north or island hopping in the south means that there are lots of transport options, which are comfortable and very safe. 12Go is the best place to book transport while travelling Thailand.\n\nSome of the most popular destinations to visit (that are great for first time solo travellers) are: Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Pai, Krabi and Koh Tao. The Full Moon Party on Koh Phangan is also an iconic destination, although it’s important to be extra careful if you’re planning on doing this solo as there can be robbing and spiking, so try and get a hostel group together if you can.\n\nThailand is perfect for foodies, culture, nature, history and is very affordable. It’s also very accessible to fly to!\n\nAffordability: Inexpensive\n\nThere is so much to see in Thailand and you need at least a month to even scratch the surface. Depending on what kind of trip itinerary you’re looking to do for your first time solo travelling, there are a lot of different routes to choose from.\n\nTypically the north offers a bit more of the cultural activities while the south and the islands are great for nature, relaxing and partying. Here are the best places in Thailand that I would personally recommend.\n\nBangkok\n\nAyutthaya\n\nSukhothai\n\nChiang Mai\n\nChiang Rai\n\nPai\n\nKoh Tao\n\nKoh Lipe\n\nKoh Lanta\n\nKoh Kood\n\nKhao Sok National Park\n\nThere are also destinations like Koh Samui, Phi Phi and Phuket, which are very popular for people visiting Thailand, however personally I don’t think they are worth the visit. Do your own research and see if they interest you!"
