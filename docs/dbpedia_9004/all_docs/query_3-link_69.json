        "text": "The world is full of beautiful, diverse destinations. Ask any traveler, “What’s your favorite country to visit?” and watch their eyes widen in hesitation because it’s simply too hard to pick just one. This is why I am highlighting a few recommendations of countries to visit for solo travelers in this article.\n\nThe following post was written by my friend and fellow adventurer Kristin Addis who has been traveling the world for the past three years. Though this is by no means a comprehensive list, here are some places that are an excellent start if you’re looking for a safe, solo adventure.\n\nAnd if you’re a woman traveling on her own, be sure to check out Kristin's Solo Female Travel Guide before you go!\n\n1. Finland\n\nRanks high because of: Safety\n\nWhy it’s great for solo travelers: Aside from being ranked as the safest country in the world by the World Economic Forum, it also features a very appetizing food scene and one of the best chances to view the Northern Lights.\n\n2. Iceland\n\nRanks high because of: Scenery\n\nWhy it’s great for solo travelers: You’ll see Iceland on most lists featuring the best of the best for solo travelers, and there’s a reason for that. It’s a beautiful country with a lot to do and little to worry about, except maybe never wanting to leave. You’ll never see anything quite like the Blue Lagoon.\n\n3. Thailand\n\nRanks high because of: Culture\n\nWhy it’s great for solo travelers: Thailand is at the top of the South East Asian backpacking list, which means you’ll encounter a lot of other solo travelers on your journey. It’s very budget friendly and incredibly easy to make friends.\n\n4. South Korea\n\nRanks high because of: Cuisine\n\nWhy it’s great for solo travelers: You may not know this, but South Korea is a very geographically diverse country. At the snap of a finger you can go from a lush mountainous town, to a metropolitan city, to a white sandy beach. Plus, even Anthony Bourdain knows there’s nothing like Korean BBQ and soju.\n\n5. Malaysia\n\nRanks high because of: Safety\n\nWhy it’s great for solo travelers: The weather is great, the shopping is world class, and the people are friendly. What more could you want from a solo trip? It’s easy to get around Malaysia and you’re bound to feel safe almost everywhere you go, especially traveling as a solo female.\n\n6. New Zealand\n\nRanks high because of: Scenery\n\nWhy it’s great for solo travelers: This is the kind of destination that only takes one picture to convince every traveler they must visit. Much like Iceland, New Zealand is full of scenic surprises. Plus, it’s very easy to get around and full of information for tourists.\n\n7. Spain\n\nRanks high because of: Culture\n\nWhy it’s great for solo travelers: There are few countries as colorful as Spain. The land of Flamenco, Paella, and Sangria is a culturally rich destination for solo travelers. Be sure to brush up on your Spanish because you’ll surely get plenty of chances to practice!\n\n8. Vietnam\n\nRanks high because of: Cuisine\n\nWhy it’s great for solo travelers: There’s a lot of reasons to visit Vietnam, like the fact that it’s one of the most beautiful countries in the world, has a very interesting (and recent) history to explore, and very easy to navigate. If you like to eat delicious food, though, that’s definitely what you’ll talk about for ages to come because their cuisine is unforgettable.\n\n9. Norway\n\nRanks high because of: Safety\n\nWhy it’s great for solo travelers: Much like Finland, Norway is one of the safest places you could visit. In fact, all of Scandinavia is great for solo travelers. You can easily hop between Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland for the full experience. You’ll never be bored, or hungry.\n\n10. Chile\n\nRanks high because of: Scenery\n\nWhy it’s great for solo travelers: Glaciers, volcanoes, alpacas, desert lands; there are many reasons to put Chile at the top of your solo travel list, but the diverse landscape is number one. Plus you haven’t lived until you’ve experienced an earthquake (the kind you drink, of course). It’s a delicious cocktail made of wine, fernet liqueur, and pineapple ice cream.\n\n11. Belize\n\nRanks high because of: Culture\n\nWhy it’s great for solo travelers: Belize is beginning to make it to the top of many a traveler’s itinerary because it’s finally prepared to welcome visitors. With a shaky political past, it hasn’t always been the best place to travel alone, but today that history makes for a very culturally enriching experience, plus the scenery is gorgeous. You’ll find that Belizeans are very kind hearted and helpful.\n\n12. Italy\n\nRanks high because of: Cuisine\n\nWhy it’s great for solo travelers: Isn’t “Eat your way through Italy” on everyone’s bucket list? It really should be. Italian cuisine is to die for, but you knew that already. You’ll also find that walking through this country is like walking through a painting; a watercolor masterpiece that never seems to end, just to be exact.\n\nThere you have it! If you want to find out more about the places Kristin has visited you should go and checkout her Blog.\n\nApart from being an expert for solo female travel Kristin also takes inspiring photographs which you can find on her Instagram channel – definitely worth a follow as well!\n\nWhat are your favorite countries to visit for Solo Travelers?\n\nLet's extend this list with more great places in the comment section – tell us where you have been and what amazed you!"
