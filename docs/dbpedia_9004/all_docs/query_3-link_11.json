        "text": "Solo PRO Connect includes verified modems for your Solo PRO (and Solo PRO only) as well as the ability to activate several different regional data plans.\n\nEach data plan includes unlimited data on the included modems, stream as much as you want and neeed!\n\nWhen you register your Solo PRO Connect kit, you will be asked which region you would like to activate unlimited data for. Below is a guide to each option and what countries are supported in that data plan.\n\nEU (Europe)\n\nThe EU plan includes the following countries:\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nBulgaria\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nCzech Republic\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGibraltar\n\nGreece\n\nGuadeloupe\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRÃ©union\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nCanada\n\nThe Canada plan includes the following countries:\n\nCanada\n\nUSA\n\nMexico\n\nPlease note: while the Canada plan supports USA, Solo Connect remains compatible with Solo PRO and is still the primary modem set and plan sold for users who will remain in the USA. USA support in the Canada plan is currently intended as a convenience for Candian users who will sometimes travel to the USA.\n\nTraveler\n\nThe traveler plan includes the following countries, and is intended for users that will travel the globe. You do not need to activate additional regions or change plans, and can travel as many time as you want, even in a single month. However, the traveler package is priced to include these features and is not intended for users who will remain in a single country. If you are a user who will remain in a single country and your country is not yet supported by a regional-specific plan that is more appropriately priced for a non-traveler, contact LiveU Solo Support to see when a region for your country may be launching - we plan to add more regions as fast as we can!"
