        "text": "When I was a kid, I had a room that was next to my bedroom at my parent’s house. Actually, it was part of the attic. It was my world and secret passageway into music and all things creative and awesome. The walls were filled with photos of my favorite bands, musicians, and skateboarders that had been ripped out of magazines and stuck to the wall with thumbtacks and Scotch tape. There was a hammock in this musical, isolation chamber that was filled with sleeping bags and old pillows. I would sit in the hammock and listen to music everyday. I would sing as loud as I could and fill my body with music. It gave me the feeling that I was connected with a force that drives all things amazing. I would picture myself on stages playing for people that were there for only one reason - to get away from life and become part of this connection with all things amazing. I dreamed of being in a band with other musicians that were so in tune with each other that when united we could soar to musical places that no other combination of people could reach. We would sing and play songs about life, struggles, and love. This imaginary stage, fans, and band were and have always been all I ever wanted. About five years ago, I opened my eyes and looked out at a sea of people who were connecting to the music playing. I looked up from my guitar and saw a stage full of my best friends, who are the most incredible musicians I know. I was living my dream. I am still living my dream. I am Coy Bowles and I play guitar, organ, and write songs in the Zac Brown Band.\n\nI started playing guitar at age 11. By the time I was 13, I had a band called Betty Doom. We played punk rock and rock-n-roll music at churches and at friend’s birthday parties in my hometown, Thomaston, Georgia. It still seems ironic that we played punk rock in church. We had rehearsal at my house so all the instruments stayed set up in my bedroom. I taught myself how to play bass, drums, and write songs. Something always happened when a guitar was in my hand. I would start playing for what I thought was 30 minutes, but when my parents hollered up the stairs for dinner, hours would have flown by like some sort of time abyss. I was addicted to the feeling of being in on the know. By that I mean I was and have always been totally consumed with feeling like I am connected to this crazy energy by being able to play the guitar lick or sing the song that makes me feel like I’m alive.\n\nI went to college for biology at West GA College where I met Zac. I later shifted gears right before graduating and decided that, do or die, I was a musician and that was all that mattered to me. During this period, I started tinkering with the piano as a different method for writing songs. I took a year off and practiced eight hours a day in order to get into Georgia State University’s Jazz Studies program. I played guitar everyday, all day, for four years while in college, totally consumed with the music of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and many others. I graduated and started my own band, Coy Bowles and The Fellowship. We opened for Zac Brown Band at the Sky Bar in Auburn, Alabama, and a week or two later, I got a call from Zac saying, “I like what you are doing with music. If you want to open for us full-time, the spot is there. Or if you want to leave your keys on stage and play keys with us on the next few shows then come on.” Years later, here I am! Still sitting in and loving every minute of it.\n\nOh yeah, I have also written four children’s book called Amy Giggles - Laugh Out Loud, Will Powers - Where There's a Will There's a Way, When You're Feeling Sick and Behind the Little Red Door.\n\nWhere to start…I have been playing drum set and percussion instruments as far back as I can remember. I think I was probably banging inside my mother's womb until she could stand it no more and said \"you're out of there\" like an umpire in a baseball game. But on a serious note, from the day I was born I heard many different styles and rhythms of music due to the love my parents have for music. My mother is Puerto Rican/American and my father is Cuban/American. I clearly remember my mother always singing beautiful Puerto Rican melodies to us all the time when we were growing up. She loves to sing.\n\nI am honored to say I was born into a family that for three generations has been making a living at playing music. My grandfather, Walfredo de los Reyes II (trumpet player and singer), laid the family musical foundation by co-founding the famous Cuban orchestra in Cuba called Casino de la Playa. My grandfather lived in both Havana and New York City. My father, Walfredo de los Reyes III, went on to become one of Cuba’s most successful and well known drummers/percussionists before moving on to Puerto Rico and then the United States. My father’s musical credits range from Josephine Baker, Celia Cruz, Israel \"Cachao\" Lopez, Bennie More, Paul Anka, Sammy Davis Jr., Tony Bennett, Debbie Reynolds, and more. The list goes on and on. He is one of the first drummers to incorporate the drum set with congas and other percussion and take it to a level recognized throughout the world. My father blazed a wide path that many would follow. He continues to wow crowds with his drumming and percussion ability, extensive musical history and incredible enthusiasm. I am constantly in awe and learning from him every day. My grandfather and father both grew up and participated in the golden era of music, especially in Havana, Cuba, where they were involved in the creation of styles of music such as son, cha-cha-cha, mambo, and rumba. They both contributed to the evolution of Latin Jazz around the world during the free-form descarga years. Music has been flowing through my veins since the very beginning of my life.\n\nSo you can see how with the musical family that I come from, I did not have any choice in becoming a musician. Just kidding of course! I was surrounded by all different kinds of drums in our house growing up and was instinctively drawn to them, especially hand drums, as early as two years old. You know how you see kids banging away on kitchen pots and pans with a spoon and how excited they get? Well, that was me except I had access to real drumsticks, drum sets, and percussion instruments and used them to bang on anything within my reach. The minute I started hitting on things the way little children do, my father took the drumsticks in my hand and said, \"This is the proper way you hold them.\" Drums have always been part of my life. When I was young I used to get bored very quickly just sitting and doing one thing at a time. Telling me to sit still was like telling a mosquito not to buzz! That is why drums and percussions are perfect for me. I get to use all four limbs at once. And by the way, to this day I am still like a mosquito always buzzing!\n\nAs for my early drum instruction, my dad was my first teacher. He always wanted to sit me down (the buzzing mosquito) to study technique and go over books like the drumming bible, George Lawrence’s Stick Control Book. I was 11 years old and would get very restless sitting there in front of a book and pad, All I wanted to do was go wild on the drums! So being very wise, he decided to put me with another drum teacher by the name of Irv Klooger. That was a great thing for me. Irv, being the cool Jazzer that he was, helped me a lot but with my family and amazing extended musical family around all the time, how can you turn into anything but a musician? At any time we would have these great musicians around our house: Joe Morello, Alan Dawson, Billy Cobham, Alex Acuña, Rogelio Darias, Roy Burns, Armando Peraza, Marcelino Valdez, Cachao, Louie Bellson, and on and on. Sometimes I would play alongside them when I was a young adult. By participating in their jam sessions, I was fortunate to absorb through osmosis the amazing feeling of expressing yourself musically with no restrictions. Those impromptu ‘lessons’ with these music legends were priceless to me. In addition my father would always take me to work with him. My childhood playgrounds were the backstage of theaters. I was always right next to him on stage while he would play the shows. A typical day would be the musicians would get to the rehearsal, they would see the written music for the first time, play the songs in the show one time through, and play two shows that night like they had been playing this music all of their life. It was amazing! In these back stages I was fortunate to have seen and met many incredible entertainers throughout my youth.\n\nAs a young adult I could not get enough of the drums and percussion instruments. I literally lived and breathed drums/percussion because I loved them so very much. I would take them apart, rebuild them, change the color of them, and build new instruments from scratch. I would practice all day long whenever I could. Sometimes I would fall asleep and wake up with the drums at my side. I know that sounds really crazy, me and my drums. What a love affair!\n\nI definitely knew when I was in the 10th grade performing in front of a large crowd that I would go on to pursue a career as a professional drummer and percussionist. One of the funniest early moments that come to my mind was when I was in my late teens. I was playing drums in front of an audience in Las Vegas and we were playing Kool and the Gang's \"Celebration\" song. And yes, before you say anything, it was the disco days! Well, I think I was getting into the music and celebrating a little too much because when the band finished the song, I kept right on playing, oblivious to the ending. There I am playing drums on stage in front of a large crowd and the vocals and music stops. Dead silence. And then guess what? My very first DRUM SOLO!\n\nOf all the hand percussion that I love to play, my favorite hand drum is the tumbadoras or congas as they are called in the United States. I have a very special love for hand percussion instruments in general because it is just your hands and the drum making the music. Tumbadoras are a very physical instrument and it takes a special devotion to get through the pain that you go through to get your hands in shape and to build your stamina when you first start playing. But what an incredible feeling you experience when you reach that point. What most people don't realize is that playing a whole night of hand percussion is a serious physical workout!\n\nPeople often ask me what I personally like to do when I am not drumming or doing music of some sort. It probably won’t surprise people to learn that I love to express my creative side in all sorts of ways. I especially love to work with all different types of materials and tools. If it were left totally up to me, I would have an incredible workshop where I could build anything that I could dream up. I don't think very many people know that I also enjoy cooking and am actually pretty good at it or so I have been told. Plus give me a few power tools and I am also quite the handyman!\n\nOn the professional level, one of my most popular and successful inventions I have developed is the One Shot Shaker series from LP that provides a downbeat shake without the inevitable back-shake. Others include an innovative utility beater by Regal Tip that attaches to pedals for play on cowbells, woodblocks, and tambourines without sacrificing their natural sounds as well as the Daniel de los Reyes Signature Pro pad by DW (Drum Workshop) that incorporates timbales, cowbells, and congas all in a portable practice rig that easily fits in a backpack. Always creating and thinking of new ideas!\n\nTo switch gears, one of the most rewarding activities I have been doing a lot of in the last few years is reaching out to others in a variety of ways using the drum and rhythm programs I have created. Whether I am working with children, teens, adults, elderly, or special needs clients, I believe there is a drummer in everyone! I have been honored to create rhythm programs and events for a variety of clients such as Cirque du Soleil and NBA’s Miami Heat’s Alonzo Mourning and Dwayne Wade. In the future I look forward to taking my rhythm outreach programs to a more global audience.\n\nAnd now I am very proud to be playing with the Zac Brown Band. Everyone within the organization and all the fans has been so welcoming to me. I am really looking forward to this journey together. Nothing but great things are created when you share music with a person who shows you his heart. And Zac’s heart is pure gold.\n\nIn addition to my current schedule with the Zac Brown Band, I have been incredibly blessed to perform on tour, record, TV, movie and video over the years with a virtual who’s who of music giants including Chicago, Don Henley, Earth, Wind & Fire, Sting, The Killers, Sheryl Crow, Patti LaBelle, Peter Frampton, Jennifer Lopez, Don Omar, Stevie Nicks, Louie Vega, Ricky Martin, Shakira, Lionel Richie, Kenny Ortega, Steve Winwood, and many others.\n\nWith all my years in the music business, if there is one thing I would like people to feel and take away when they see and hear me perform, it would be how happy one feels when you have the freedom to express your individuality in whatever way is right for you. It doesn't have to be through music like it is for me. It can be anything that you love with a passion and choose to pursue with all your heart. The greatest gift I could ever hope to share with another person would be to always encourage you to strive toward your dreams and enjoy the heck out of it. When people share their own personal stories with me and say I have inspired them in some small way … wow … now THAT makes me smile!\n\nMusic has been a part of my life as long as I can remember. While my parents didn’t play any instruments, they would always have music playing around the house and anytime we were in the car. The Police, Led Zeppelin, Paul Simon, The Beatles, Grateful Dead, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, and many more were all shaping my musical taste from an early age.\n\nMy interest in performing music didn’t begin until around the age of twelve. When attending middle school orientation I was introduced to the violin, which I was lucky enough to learn through high school. There I learned to read sheet music and play classical violin. But my heart was in being in a band, not an orchestra, so on the side, I was teaching myself to play guitar.\n\nAfter high school I moved to Athens, GA to attend college. But, college was short-lived after joining my first band The Hill. That was the first time I fell in love with performing music. The Hill was a rock/jam band of original music and it was then I learned about the recording process, touring, and writing music.\n\nAfter The Hill had run its course I found myself looking for a new project which landed me with the Dave Matthews Cover Band (DMCB) out of Athens, GA. Playing in the tribute band was a great experience for me. I was already a big fan of the Dave Matthews Band when I joined, as DMB was a big influence in my music. Also, it was my first time regularly touring nationwide. I built many memories with a great group of guys, but we all knew it was a temporary gig, as everybody felt unfulfilled without writing and performing original music.\n\nAfter 4 great years with DMCB, we split up, and I found myself again looking for the next opportunity. During this time was when I met my then future wife Stacey. She has been the rock of my life and since then has blessed me with two beautiful boys, James and Joseph.\n\nAbout a year after DMCB, I was playing one of my odd gigs around town, when the greatest opportunity of my life found me. I was playing in a small bar/restaurant with a fellow musician in Atlanta. After the gig, then bartender, Wyatt Durrette called me over to the bar and asked me if I knew Zac Brown. I told him I had heard of him, as Zac had begun making a name for himself around town. Wyatt passed on Zac’s number to me and I gave him a call. He had me out the next night to play a gig in a sports bar with him and I was blown away by Zac’s performance. It was a treat to be able play with such a talent and a no-brainer when he asked me to continue to play with him.\n\nSoon after John Hopkins joined the band, we thought of naming the band Zac Brown and the (insert band name here), but decided to go with Zac Brown Band. I’ve always felt this shows great homage to the rest of us lucky enough to play with Zac, and his philosophy of this being a team effort. The band we have now are not only some of the best musicians in the world, but guys I will have as friends for life. I count my blessings every day to be in such an amazing band.\n\nJames (boy), Joseph (boy), and Jackson (boy) are Jimmy's babies. Jimmy will be having a little girl in April."
