        "text": "Chicago is home to some of the biggest musicians of all genres. The Windy City has it all from hip hop to DIY, electronic dance to indie, rock and roll to R&B and more.\n\nOne local band that started from playing house shows to touring the world is Twin Peaks. You might be familiar with some of their work from their 2013 debut album Sunken, 2016 album Down in Heaven or their most recent EP Side A.\n\nBut the music doesn’t stop there. You can also find some Twin Peaks members releasing and performing their own solo projects, too. The group’s guitarist and singer Cadien Lake James, aka lake j, is among the latest of the members to debut his first solo album. It’s called Dizzy.\n\nJames shared his excitement about finally getting to share a project many years in the making.\n\n“It was very nice making music just for myself,” James said. “It removed a lot of the pressures and weights that come along with doing music as a full-time career.”\n\nDizzy features tracks like his debut single “My Own Mess” and a slew of songs featuring the work of other Chicago artists like fellow Twin Peaks member Colin Croom, Finom’s Macie Stewart and Whitney’s Julian Ehrlich.\n\nConnecting with other people through music was another part of creating the album that James said he cherished and valued.\n\n“It's one of the best things about music and why music is so special in comparison with other art. It's very communal and very easy to tap into that,” he said.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also played a role in members of the band turning to solo projects. James explains that putting an end to nearly a decade of touring and performing wasn’t something that they would’ve done on their own.\n\n“It gave us all time to reflect and think about if it's something we want to continue doing,” James said. “It's been nice to kind of live different lives and try a slower lifestyle out.”\n\nIt’s not clear when we will hear new music from Twin Peaks, but what is clear is that making music isn’t out of the picture all together.\n\nFor now, Caiden Lake James will continue to make music, plus experience Chicago in a new way with his partner and dogs.\n\n“I'm really enjoying being a Chicagoan for the first time,” he said.\n\nReset host Sasha-Ann Simons sat down with Twin Peaks singer and guitarist Cadien Lake James aka lake j after the release of his debut solo album Dizzy."
