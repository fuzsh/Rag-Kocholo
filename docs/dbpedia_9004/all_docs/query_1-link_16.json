        "text": "Brad Tursi of the multi-Platinum, award-winning country band Old Dominion is releasing his first ever solo album next Friday (July 19). The project, titled Parallel Love, will arrive via Sony Music Nashville.\n\nTursi’s 10-song collection has been written over the past decade, and reflects where the accomplished artist, guitarist and songwriter is in the present moment. Parallel Love was created and released with the band’s full support, and was produced entirely by Tursi, with Ben West and Marc Scibilia co-producing select tracks. Stephen Wilson Jr., Dan Isbell, Jessi Alexander and Matt Jenkins are featured as co-writers on the album.\n\n“This process was purely creative. I wasn’t even sure I’d release a project, but when I played it for my team, they all reacted really positively,” Tursi shares. “It felt like everything aligned to finally share it.”\n\nIn addition to Tursi’s role in CMA and ACM Vocal Group of the Year, he is a prominent songwriter on Music Row. The Grammy nominee has earned multiple CMA Triple Play Awards for writing three No. 1 songs in a 12-month period, been named AIMP Artist Writer of the Year and co-written hits for Kenny Chesney, Luke Bryan, Tyler Hubbard, Josh Turner, Darius Rucker and Cole Swindell, among others.\n\nParallel Love Tracklist:\n\n1. Oh Darlin’ (Intro) (Brad Tursi)\n\n2. Church Bells and Train Whistles (Brad Tursi/Ben West/Stephen Wilson Jr.)\n\n3. Question the Universe (Brad Tursi)\n\n4. Where You Been (Brad Tursi)\n\n5. Parallel Love (Brad Tursi/Dan Isbell)\n\n6. Oh Darlin’ (Interlude) (Brad Tursi)\n\n7. Crazy Life (Brad Tursi)\n\n8. Lover and a Fried (Brad Tursi)\n\n9. Afraid to Love (Brad Tursi/Jessi Alexander/Matt Jenkins)\n\n10. Oh Darlin’ (Outro) (Brad Tursi)"
