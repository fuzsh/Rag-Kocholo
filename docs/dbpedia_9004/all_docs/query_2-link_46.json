        "text": "Maybe together isn't always better.\n\nThere’s nothing like hearing the perfect harmony of a trio, or instrumentals with well-paired vocals. The sheer talent within Black groups is so undebatable that even as soloists, their members shined.\n\nGet comfy as we go through some of the best soloists made from iconic groups.\n\nBeyoncé might have one of the most successful solo careers after departing from a group. As a consistent record-breaker and hitmaker, Mrs Knowles-Carter is one of modern music's biggest and most talented stars. With 32 Grammy awards (snubs aside) and seven number-one albums later, Beyoncé has really been that girl for the entirety of her career.\n\nAlready a strong vocalist within the group, Kelly consistently showed why her solo career was an inevitability. A career full of hits and two Grammy awards for both R&B and Dance/Electronic, Kelly's raaaange remains undeniable.\n\nNobody does bridges like Michelle Williams and looking back, the group found their missing piece once she joined. Since their split, Michelle has gone on to become a revered artist in Gospel spaces, releasing four albums including Song of The Year at the 2014 Gospel Touch Music Awards.\n\nSteve Lacy and Syd – The Internet\n\nSince then, Steve has created two EPs and two studio albums including Gemini Rights, where his single \"Bad Habits\" gained Tik-Tok virality and the album itself won Best Progressive R&B Album at the 2023 Grammys.\n\nSyd went on to release two albums – Fin and Broken Hearts Club, in addition to having credits across an array of singles including Beyoncé's Grammy award-winning single \"Plastic Off The Sofa\".\n\nQ-Tip – A Tribe Called Quest\n\nQ-Tip is one of hip-hop's most beloved musicians. Producing for artists including Mariah Carey and Solange, you can't discuss progressive soul and jazz-rap without mentioning Q-Tip.\n\nLauryn Hill – The Fugees\n\nDespite having just one multi-award-winning studio album, Lauryn Hill remains exalted as one of the most talented artists in both R&B and hip-hop. In addition to her singles, she's also loved for her work on the second instalment of the Sister Act franchise where she played Rita Louise Watson.\n\nPharrell Williams – The Neptunes\n\nProducer, rapper, singer, and fashion extraordinaire, there's not much Pharrell can't do. With a genesis as strong as his, it's no shock that the multi-hyphenate went on to be one of the most successful musicians to grace the music world.\n\nRaphael Saadiq – Tony! Toni! Tone!\n\nLearning the bass guitar at just six years old, Raphael has since made a career spanning decades. With production credits on albums including D'Angelo's Voodoo, Beyoncé's Renaissance, and Brent Faiyaz's Wasteland, Raphael Saadiq remains one of the most prolific musicians in modern music history.\n\nMissy Elliot – Sista\n\nWith four Grammy Awards and iconic collaborations with the likes of Timbaland, Ludacris, and Ciara, Missy Elliot is best known as a legendary hip-hop rapper and producer, but many are far less aware of her beginnings.\n\nTyler The Creator, Frank Ocean, Earl Sweatshirt, and Syd – Odd Future\n\nOdd Future's founding member, Tyler's ear for good music has been proven in the evolution of his music. While he began as a controversial artist for his tongue-in-cheek and sometimes even violent verses, he has since shifted to a softer sound, becoming an award-winning, acclaimed rapper in his own right.\n\nYou simply cannot discuss singer-songwriters without including Frank Ocean. Beginning his career as a ghostwriter, he has since become known as one of the most successful songwriters in soul, alt R&B, and beyond. Even 10 years later, his debut album Channel Orange remains on repeat.\n\nRapper, poet, and record producer, Earl Sweatshirt was one of the most distinctive voices of Odd Future. As a soloist, Earl has a long discography, including four studio albums and a Grammy award nomination for his work on Frank's Channel Orange.\n\nDr Dre and Ice Cube – N.W.A.\n\nFollowing the group's hiatus in 1991, Dr Dre went on to become one of the biggest music moguls in rap, producing his albums The Chronic and 2001, which both remain two of the most distinctive hip-hop albums ever made. Dr Dre also oversaw a successful line of protégées including Eminem and 50 Cent.\n\nIce Cube also went on to make more music, but focused on an acting career which saw him star in films such as Friday, Boyz In The Hood and 22 Jump Street.\n\nBobby Brown – New Edition\n\nFollowing the group's demise, Bobby released his debut solo album Don't Be Cruel, which included hits such as \"My Prerogative\", \"Every Little Step,\" and gained himelf a Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance. This was followed by success with other singles including \"Two Can Play That Game\" where he was nominated for a second Grammy. While he was most successful in the 1980s and 1990s, he continued to make music after this, including with a reunited New Edition.\n\nMichael Jackson – The Jackson 5\n\nArguably one of the most distinctive and influential artists to ever have existed, Michael Jackson is among the biggest successes made by a musical group. From the creation of the moonwalk to his career proliferation from child to adult, there are few that can compete with his legacy.\n\nWho's your favourite group-member to solo artist?
