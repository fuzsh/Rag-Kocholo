        "text": "All travel comes with risk. However, if you travel by yourself (solo travel), independent of a group or organised tour (independent travel), you can face additional challenges.\n\nPlan your travel\n\nBefore you travel, research your destination:\n\ncheck our country travel advice pages and sign up to receive email alerts when it is updated\n\nread guidebooks and online forums\n\ntalk to friends or family who have been to the places you plan to visit\n\nread the foreign travel checklist\n\nMake sure you have appropriate travel insurance, even if you are visiting friends and family, or know the country well.\n\nLeave an itinerary with someone at home and agree how regularly you will be in contact. You may also want to leave photocopies of important documents, such as your passport and insurance policy.\n\nHave a plan in case things go wrong. For example:\n\nmake sure you know the address of where you are staying, in case your host or transfer company does not turn up to meet you\n\nknow what other accommodation is available in case your original option is not what you expected\n\nMake sure you can access your money while abroad, including if you need to access funds quickly in an emergency.\n\nStay safe while you’re abroad\n\nSolo and independent travel can be a rewarding experience. However, it may bring an increased risk of being a victim of crime or other risks to your personal safety.\n\nIf you are travelling by yourself, without other people or an organised group, consider how you will look after your safety. This is particularly important if you are travelling in a place that’s unfamiliar to you.\n\nBe secure in your transportation\n\nConsider:\n\narranging airport transfers before you arrive\n\nusing only official, licensed and reputable taxis\n\ntravelling in busy carriages on a train\n\navoiding hitchhiking\n\navoiding carrying large amounts of money or wearing excess jewellery, and keeping valuables close to you\n\nif walking alone, avoiding poorly lit areas, particularly at night\n\nBe secure in your accommodation\n\nConsider:\n\nbooking accommodation before you travel, in particular your first night’s accommodation. You are at your most vulnerable when you first arrive in a foreign country as you are likely to be tired and unsure of your surroundings\n\nresearching accommodation options carefully, including checking the location and having alternative accommodation as back-up, or knowing where to find alternative accommodation\n\nnever leaving your key where someone can note your room number\n\nclosing your windows, especially if your room is on the ground floor or has a balcony\n\nlocking your door when you are inside the room\n\nusing the spy hole or chain, if the door has one, before opening the door to visitors, especially if you’re not expecting anybody\n\nbringing a door wedge to place behind your accommodation door\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable or in danger:\n\ndo not be afraid to draw attention to yourself by shouting and making a fuss\n\nremember that being safe is more important than being polite\n\ncontact the local police if you are fearful for your safety or in danger\n\nIf you have been the victim of a crime, see the victim of crime abroad advice.\n\nYou may face other risks while travelling alone due to your identity. See our advice for women travellers, LGBT+ travellers and disability and travel abroad.\n\nRape and sexual assault is a risk to people of all genders worldwide. The local services and attitudes towards helping victims can vary widely by country. The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) takes any allegation of rape and sexual assault seriously. Read our advice on what to do if you have been raped or sexually assaulted abroad, which includes specific advice for the country or territory you’re in.\n\nOrganisations that can help\n\nThese organisations’ websites provide information about how to stay safe while travelling or working alone:\n\nCaroline’s Rainbow Foundation promotes personal safety for travellers\n\nSuzy Lamplugh Trust campaigns on personal safety and stalking, much of the information also applies to travel abroad\n\nNational Travel Health Network and Centre’s personal safety guidance\n\nABTA’s staying safe on holiday guidance\n\nDirect Travel’s Travel Aware guidance on how to get ready for travel abroad and when you are at your destination\n\nFeedback\n\nWe welcome your views on the support we provide, to help us to identify what we do well and what we could do better. Contact us using our feedback contact form.\n\nAlternatively write to us:\n\nConsular Feedback Team\n\nConsular Directorate\n\nForeign, Commonwealth & Development Office\n\nKing Charles Street\n\nLondon SW1A 2AH\n\nTelephone +44 (0)20 7008 5000\n\nDisclaimer"
