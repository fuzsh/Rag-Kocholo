Taylor Swift recently earned her 12th chart-topping hit.\n\nTaylor Swift earned her first No. 1 hit with \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" in 2012. It was the lead single from her fourth album \"Red.\"\n\nSwift's fifth album, \"1989,\" spawned three No. 1 singles: \"Shake It Off\" and \"Blank Space\" in 2014, followed by the \"Bad Blood\" remix featuring Kendrick Lamar in 2015.\n\n\"Look What You Made Me Do\" became her fifth leader in 2017, followed by \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" in 2020.\n\nIn 2021, Swift launched her series of rerecorded albums, sending an extended version of a nine-year-old deep cut, \"All Too Well,\" to the top of the chart. At 10 minutes and 13 seconds, it's the longest No. 1 hit in Billboard history.\n\nSwift's 2022 single \"Anti-Hero\" became her longest-running No. 1 hit, reigning atop the chart for eight weeks.\n\nFinally, in 2023, Swift notched her milestone 10th leader with \"Cruel Summer,\" fueled by the success of The Eras Tour. Shortly after, \"Is It Over Now?\" and \"Fortnight\" joined the ranks, bringing Swift's grand total to 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5 (tie). Madonna topped the chart 12 times since the '80s.\n\nMadonna has been topping the chart for decades, and it all began with \"Like a Virgin\" in 1984.\n\nShe followed up with \"Crazy for You\" in 1985 before she scored three No. 1 hits in 1986 alone: \"Live to Tell,\" \"Papa Don't Preach,\" and \"Open Your Heart.\"\n\nThe so-called \"Queen of Pop\" added to her collection with \"Who's That Girl\" in 1987, \"Like a Prayer\" in 1989, \"Vogue\" and \"Justify My Love\" in 1990, \"This Used to Be My Playground\" in 1992, \"Take a Bow\" in 1994, and \"Music\" in 2000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5 (tie). The Supremes also had 12 No. 1 songs, all in a span of five years.\n\nThe Supremes are known as one of the best-selling girl groups of all time, and with 12 No. 1 hits in half as many years, it's easy to see why.\n\nIn the mid-'60s, the trio released a string of five singles that all went to No. 1 on the chart: \"Where Did Our Love Go,\" \"Baby Love,\" and \"Come See About Me\" in 1964, then \"Stop!

Michael Jackson topped the chart 13 times.\n\nMichael Jackson began appearing on the charts as a child with The Jackson 5, but after he struck out on his own, the so-called \"King of Pop\" racked up more hits than any solo artist at the time.\n\nPerhaps most impressively, five out of his 13 No. 1 songs came from the same album (\"Bad\"), setting a record that remains unbroken. (It was tied in 2011 by Katy Perry with \"Teenage Dream\").\n\nJackson's first chart-topper was \"Ben\" in 1972 when he was 14 years old. \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" and \"Rock with You\" both took the top spot in 1979, followed by \"Billie Jean,\" \"Beat It,\" and \"Say Say Say\" in 1983; \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You,\" \"Bad,\" and \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" in 1987; \"Man in the Mirror\" and \"Dirty Diana\" in 1988; and \"Black or White\" in 1993.\n\nHe capped his collection with \"You Are Not Alone\" in 1995, which also became the first song in history to debut at No. 1 on the chart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4 (tie). Drake recently tied the \"King of Pop\" with 13 No. 1 songs of his own.\n\nDrake is arguably the most dominant artist of the streaming era, racking up 13 chart-topping singles to date — the vast majority at breakneck speed in a seven-year period.\n\nThe rapper notched his first No. 1 hit thanks to Rihanna, when their collaboration \"What's My Name\" reigned atop the chart in 2010.\n\nIn 2016, Drake topped the chart again as a featured artist on Rihanna's song \"Work.\" Later that year, \"One Dance\" became his first solo hit to ascend to first place.\n\nHe notched three No. 1 hits in 2018 with \"God's Plan,\" \"Nice for What,\" and \"In My Feelings,\" followed by \"Toosie Slide\" in 2020; \"What's Next\" and \"Way 2 Sexy\" in 2021; \"Wait for U and \"Jimmy Cooks\" in 2022; and \"Slime You Out\" and \"First Person Shooter\" in 2023.\n\nNine of those songs arrived in the chart's top spot, making Drake the artist with the most No. 1 song debuts in history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3.

Mariah Carey's 19 chart-topping songs put her just one behind the all-time record.\n\nIn terms of No. 1 songs, Mariah Carey is the second best-selling artist of all time, the best-selling solo artist of all time, and the best-selling female artist of all time.\n\nHer first No. 1 hit was also her debut single, 1990's \"Vision of Love.\" Her next four singles would also top the chart: \"Love Takes Time\" in 1990, followed by \"Someday,\" \"I Don't Wanna Cry,\" and \"Emotions\" in 1991.\n\nThen came a veritable feast of hit songs: \"I'll Be There\" in 1992; \"Dreamlover\" and \"Hero\" in 1993; \"Fantasy\" and \"One Sweet Day\" in 1995; \"Always Be My Baby\" in 1996; \"Honey\" in 1997; \"My All\" in 1998; \"Heartbreaker\" in 1999; \"Thank God I Found You\" in 2000; \"We Belong Together\" and \"Don't Forget About Us\" in 2005; and \"Touch My Body\" in 2008.\n\nIn 2020, she became the first and only artist in history to top the Billboard Hot 100 in four different decades, thanks to the longevity of her 1994 holiday single \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The Beatles have 20 No. 1 hits, the most in history.\n\nThe Beatles still reign supreme with the most No. 1 songs ever on the Billboard Hot 100, earning 20 in the span of just eight years.\n\nIn chronological order, the British band topped the chart with \"Love Me Do\" in 1962; \"She Loves You\" and \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" in 1963; \"Can't Buy Me Love,\" \"A Hard Day's Night,\" and \"I Feel Fine\" in 1964; \"Eight Days a Week,\" \"Ticket to Ride,\" \"Help!,\" \"Yesterday,\" and \"We Can Work It Out\" in 1965; \"Paperback Writer\" in 1966; \"Penny Lane\" \"All You Need Is Love,\" and \"Hello, Goodbye\" in 1967; \"Hey Jude\" in 1968; \"Get Back\" and \"Something\" in 1969; and \"Let It Be\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" in 1970.\n\nRead next\n\nMusic Celebrities Taylor Swift\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
