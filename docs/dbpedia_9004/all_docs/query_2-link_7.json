The Minneapolis hitmakers discovered the group singing on a New York City street corner, like many doo-wop groups of the past.\n\nSolo is actually a group of three male singers and an upright bass player, something that made them stand out amongst their peers.\n\nTheir self-titled debut included their signature hit, “Heaven,” as well as the follow-up “Where Do You Want Me To Put It,” but despite the group’s success and reputation as electric performers, they fell victim to industry politics. When Jam and Lewis’ Perspective Label folded, the group lost both a label and their producers and weren’t able to continue their run of success.\n\nStill, Solo did record four well-received albums in the 90s and had another modest hit with collaborator Raphael Saadiq with “Touch Me.”\n\nThe original members, Eunique Mack, Darnell Chavis, Daniele Stokes and bassist Richard Anderson have reunited and are doing shows, as well as working on a new album due next year."
