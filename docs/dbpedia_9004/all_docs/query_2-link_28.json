        "text": "Our Specialty Bands provide a wide variety of music as well as accompany high profile events, and bring a high-level commercial entertainment product onboard. Specialty Band genres/instrumentations vary, but typically have a regional focus for our seasonal itineraries where we hire musicians across an array of genres such as Caribbean, Irish, Latin, Mariachi, and many others. Bands have a repertoire of 300+ songs, with content dependent on the group and generally including: American song book standards, ballroom dancing styles (Waltz, Rhumba, Cha-Cha, Salsa, etc.) while remaining contemporary and relevant, pop music from 1940s to present, and Adult Contemporary favorites. Bands include a minimum of two members capable of lead vocals, and make frequent use of the other vocalist(s) for harmonies. Bands are run by their own Band Leader who acts as primary contact and manages band membership, repertoire, and group direction.\n\nTypical berthing arrangements will place each band member with another same-gender-on-passport band member, and/or as a linked couple, or with another member of the music team with the same gender on their passport. When this cannot be arranged, band members are expected to room together, or to understand that this may be required for limited periods of time when separate berthing is not immediately available.\n\nThese unique musical groups are an essential part of our onboard music program and primarily provide music in our \"Piazza\" venue, an atrium/lobby area with an ambience that mixes elements of five-star hotel lobbies with vibrant street performances. Ensembles generally include at least one string instrument (usually violin) accompanied by either another string instrument, piano, or other instruments on a case-by-case basis. Groups should be able to provide a 45 minute recital or concert program, as well as accompany a wedding ceremony and/or reception, as required. Groups with multi-instrumentalists, percussion, and/or backing tracks are welcomed.\n\nDepending on berthing requirements duos are expected to room together, or to understand that this may be required for limited periods of time when separate berthing is not immediately available.\n\nParty Bands are the core of our live music programming, and bring a high-level commercial entertainment product onboard. Party Bands work closely with our onboard Entertainment Department to accompany various themed events, and have a large and diverse musical repertoire including music from the 1950s to 2020s with an emphasis on modern danceable music. Bands are able to offer at least two 45 minute showcases that feature the band in a unique and identifiable way. Bands include a minimum of three members capable of lead vocals, and make frequent use of the other vocalists for harmonies. Bands are run by their own Band Leader who acts as primary contact and manages band membership, repertoire, and group direction.\n\nTypical berthing arrangements will place each band member with another same-gender-on-passport band member, and/or as a linked couple, or with another member of the music team with the same gender on their passport. When this cannot be arranged, band members are expected to room together, or to understand that this may be required for limited periods of time when separate berthing is not immediately available."
