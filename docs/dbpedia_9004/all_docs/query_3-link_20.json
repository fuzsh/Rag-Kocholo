        "text": "Solo female travel is having a moment – according to a recent survey, over half of Gen Z women would consider travelling abroad alone. That means more women than ever are heading off to far-flung destinations in search of new friends, different cultures and memorable experiences. But where should they go, and what should they know?\n\nA few countries are known to be relatively safe and easy to navigate for women looking for an adventure, with well-trodden backpacker routes, friendly locals and the chance to meet new people – or spend some good quality alone time. Here are nine of the best destinations for solo female travellers and good-to-know advice on how to stay safe.\n\nIndia-Jayne Trainor is a British-Australian travel writer based in London. At Time Out, all of our travel guides are written by local writers who know their cities inside out.
