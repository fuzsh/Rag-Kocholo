My CFI agreed to let me work it out and what I chose a bit more ambitious than a typical solo XC, but distance wise it was not much more than required.\n\nIt will be up to your CFI and you should have a lot of input if not all regarding route, but my guess is that they will not want you going much further than necessary...cuz as a student pilot there is a lot that can and does go wrong that is still outside your knowledge and experience base.\n\nMAKG1\n\nTouchdown!

Being able to deal with it is much of the point. But you don't need to make it harder than it needs to be.\n\nThat kind of adventure is a whole lot easier when your instructor doesn't have to review everything you do. That is, after your checkride.\n\nFor my own solo cross country, all this stuff happened:\n\nApproach lost contact with another airplane making a precautionary landing at a field I was flying over, and asked me to relay. He was fine.\n\nI discovered that my DME unit had an effective range of about 5 miles while in flight, and had to replan navigation while enroute so as to not use it.\n\nI learned that \"mist\" at a distance looks a lot like clouds, and planned a diversion that I never executed.\n\nThe furthest destination had ultralights making calls for \"closed runway 29,\" and I had to figure out there was another runway 29 I could use.\n\nI got cut off in the pattern on my arrival back at my home field, because the airplane behind me on downwind thought he was flying my plane (both aircraft were from the same club).\n\nLast edited: Mar 25, 2017\n\nexncsurfer\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nSep 15, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n2,156\n\nLocation\n\nNC\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nexncsurfer\n\nMar 25, 2017\n\n#7\n\nMine was over 300nm, two states.

I've done many 1000-3000 mile loops and just thought it would be kinda of cool to condense one of my favorite loops into a couple days of flying. No biggie though... there's a couple real nice sunrise to sunset loops here in AZ that I could knock out in a few hours of flying that would cover pretty much all extremes.\n\nazblackbird\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nMar 24, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n1,550\n\nLocation\n\nColorado Boonies\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nazblackbird\n\nMar 25, 2017\n\n#12\n\nDepends on what you consider multi-state.

(You pass your checkride and become a PPL) But trust me going more than 100 miles away means everything can change. Weather systems, winds, terrain. Just trust us that pilots at this stage don't know what they don't know...\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk\n\nWannFly\n\nFinal Approach\n\nJoined\n\nNov 28, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n6,553\n\nLocation\n\nKLZU\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nPriyo\n\nMar 25, 2017\n\n#25\n\nOnce u have ur cert, fly to where ever u want, no one cares other than ur loved ones.

How the hell am I suppose to build any time if I can't fly anywhere fun?\n\nDon't you think you're getting a little ahead of yourself? Slow down, you haven't even started learning how to land yet. It's all a building block approach and the rules are that way for a reason. You have a lot of experience riding motorcycles, but you probably didn't leave on a multi-state tour the day after taking the MSF course. Aerial navigation takes some practice, and that's what the student solo XC is about - you fly somewhere that's outside of your normal practice area, but not too far away, to make sure you know how to get there. And back.\n\nI'm all about challenging ourselves by expanding our horizons (literally), but the solo XC's will do exactly that as it is. I have no problem signing off a student for a longer-than-usual XC, and have done so, but we're talking about 300-400 nm round trip (instead of the 150 that's required), not 1500 nm. Too many factors that could overwhelm a student with trips of that distance, primarily among them weather.\n\nBelieve me, and this is no slight against you or your abilities, but at this point you don't even know what you don't know. (Like all of us at that stage.)\n\n(Edit - humorously, @gsengle wrote the same thing as I was typing.)\n\nMAKG1\n\nTouchdown!

Same planning, just different vehicles. Of course I don't have to worry about falling out of the sky on a motorcycle, but the semantics are basically the same.\n\nI just gotta see you dead reckon on a motorcycle. Maybe on a boat.\n\nIt's really not even close.\n\nazblackbird\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nMar 24, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n1,550\n\nLocation\n\nColorado Boonies\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nazblackbird\n\nMar 25, 2017\n\n#34\n\nDo whatever you want once you're pilot in command. (You pass your checkride and become a PPL) But trust me going more than 100 miles away means everything can change. Weather systems, winds, terrain. Just trust us that pilots at this stage don't know what they don't know...\n\nI'm not a total newbie to flying. I've probably got a couple hundred hours in a T210 mostly flying in the Rockies so I'm very well aware of weather and terrain. Of course that was 35 years ago and due to all the global warming and what not, I can imagine how the weather and terrain has changed since then.\n\nazblackbird\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nMar 24, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n1,550\n\nLocation\n\nColorado Boonies\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nazblackbird\n\nMar 25, 2017\n\n#35\n\nAs someone who flies and rides, one is orders of magnitude more complex with more ways to kill your self than the other...\n\nI agree.\n\ncoloradobluesky\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nMar 19, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n3,621\n\nLocation\n\nColorado\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\ncoloradobluesky\n\nMar 25, 2017\n\n#36\n\nLearn to walk before you run. You didn't start out riding a Honda CBR1000 did you?\n\nAfter I soloed I was chagrined to discover I couldnt just solo anytime I wanted. Only solos my instructor approved. I did a cross country and it was Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska and back to Colorado. But no mountains. And about 300 miles or so. A lot of instructors make you do a cross country that he and you have done together, and I don't blame them. Keep it conservative, keep it safe.\n\nTheres plenty of time to do long cross countries AFTER you get your PPL.\n\nBut to be really free, you need your own airplane (or partnership). Youll get there.\n\nazblackbird\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nMar 24, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n1,550\n\nLocation\n\nColorado Boonies\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nazblackbird\n\nMar 25, 2017\n\n#37\n\nI just gotta see you dead reckon on a motorcycle.

Never had the luxury of any fancy navaids to guide me where I needed to go. Didn't flying kinda use to be that way?\n\ngsengle\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nMay 9, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n2,099\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nGsengle\n\nMar 25, 2017\n\n#38\n\nBefore GPS systems, I've done many cross country dirt bike rides where all I've had was a trail map, compass, speedometer and a watch.
