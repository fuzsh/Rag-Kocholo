        "text": "Ever wondered what are the best countries for solo travel?\n\nWhile the thought of travelling alone may sound intimidating, it is actually a great experience that can bring about many benefits.\n\nThere is no denying that university life can be stressful — everyone needs a break every now and then. Travelling alone allows you to escape these stressors and go on an adventure. This is also a great opportunity for self-discovery and introspection. You can take the time to reflect on your goals, interests, and passions. It’s a chance to learn more about who you are and what you want out of life.\n\nOne Reddit user shares that “the absolute most brilliant part about solo travelling is I get to do exactly what I want to do all the time. I don’t have to go to your stupid museum or get up early if I want to sleep in or whatever. I can selfishly focus on myself and my interests.”\n\nThe worst countries for solo travel in 2024\n\nBefore we look at the best countries for solo travel, it is important to know which are the worst. Here are some factors to consider before travelling solo:\n\nPersonal safety\n\nAfter all, personal safety is a big factor to consider when planning a solo trip, especially in 2024. From a tumultuous US election, increased calls for a ceasefire on the Israel-Palestine conflict, a politically-charged Paris Olympics, the ongoing Russian-Ukraine war and even climate crisis, the world could look “glaringly different” in 2025, according to this CNN article.\n\nInternational students, in particular, are a vulnerable crowd. Violent clashes and student protests against the Bangladesh government led to hundreds of international students being forced to leave the country out of fear. Protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan, claiming the system to be discriminatory.\n\nThe Bangladesh protests have left at least 150 people dead, while emergency departments overflowed with gunshot victims. Worse still, the country imposed a nationwide curfew, coupled with an Internet blackout that cut off all communication from the outside world. That would be a living nightmare for any solo traveller or international student.\n\nHigh crime rates\n\nCountries like Venezuela have one of the highest crime rates in the world, with frequent armed robberies, kidnappings, and violent crimes. The political instability and economic hardships further contribute to the unpredictability and danger, making it a risky destination for solo travellers. The country ranks at a crime rate of 82.1, with a Level 4 travel advisory that indicates it is unsafe for international travel.\n\nOther countries with a high crime rate include Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Afghanistan and Honduras, which all have frequent crimes such as contract killings, corruption, drug trafficking, kidnapping, rape, homicides and more.\n\nCosts\n\nAside from safety, the cost of travelling is a huge concern many have when going on a solo trip.\n\nMany other articles online list other expensive countries, such as Norway, Iceland, Japan, Denmark, and more. But if there’s one thing they all agree on, it’s that Switzerland takes the champion spot for being the most expensive country to visit.\n\nSwitzerland, while beautiful, is notoriously expensive, even for solo travellers. High prices for accommodation, food, and transportation will set you back about US$200 to US$300 a night. While it is one of the safest countries in the world, the high costs can make it difficult for you to enjoy your trip without breaking the bank.\n\nCultural differences and restrictions\n\nCultural and social challenges can also deter solo travellers from visiting certain countries.\n\nFor example, Saudi Arabia has strict social norms and regulations that can be difficult for many, especially women, to follow. The conservative dress code, gender segregation, and restrictions on women’s activities may potentially create a difficult situation.\n\nOn the other hand, there are still many countries that criminalise members of the LGBTQ+ community. Special mention to Saudi Arabia, once again, where homosexuals can be persecuted and executed. Other countries include Iran, the Republic of Chechnya in Russia and Afghanistan.\n\nThe best countries for first-time solo travellers\n\n1. Costa Rica\n\nTravelling on your own for the first time can be scary, but if you are looking for one of the best countries for solo travel, consider going to Costa Rica. Costa Rica is the perfect destination for first-time solo travellers due to its safety, affordability, accessibility, and cultural experiences.\n\nEven if you don’t speak much Spanish, many have said that Costa Rica is one of the friendliest countries in the world. Costa Ricans, known as Ticos, are known to be friendly and hospitable.\n\nCosta Rica’s diversity is a highlight, boasting some of Central America’s unique wildlife. From spotting sloths in Santa Teresa to exploring the cloud forests of Monteverde, whitewater rafting in La Fortuna, or taking on Central America’s longest zipline, there’s no shortage of adventures here.\n\n2. Thailand\n\nThailand is known for its cultural diversity and welcoming locals. Many Thai people speak fluent English, making communication easy and allowing you to enjoy your trip without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nPopular destinations like Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Pai, Krabi, and Koh Tao are great for solo travellers. Bangkok has amazing temples and street food, while Chiang Mai and Pai cater to cultural exploration and adventurous activities. The southern islands like Koh Tao are excellent for relaxation.\n\nIt’s an explorer’s dream come true — you’ll find budget accommodations and delicious eat, whether you’re exploring bustling markets, attending the iconic Full Moon Party on Koh Phangan, or enjoying the tranquillity of Khao Sok National Park.\n\nThe best countries for solo travel for foodies\n\n1. Japan\n\nJapan is one of the best countries for solo travel if you are a foodie, as the country’s cuisine is known for its meticulous preparation, fresh ingredients, and unique flavours,\n\nBegin your journey by indulging in a bowl of hot ramen, a beloved noodle dish that varies in flavour and style across the country. Varieties include the hearty miso ramen of Hokkaido and the rich tonkotsu ramen of Fukuoka.\n\nWhile sushi is a staple of Japanese cuisine, you’ll find many options beyond raw fish. Enjoy vegetarian sushi rolls filled with fresh vegetables, tofu, and avocado, or indulge in tempura sushi.\n\nFor dessert, treat yourself to mochi, a delicate jelly-like confection dusted with kinako, roasted soybean flour. Its chewy texture and subtle sweetness make it a perfect end to your meal.\n\nJapan’s dedication to delicious food can even be found on the streets. As you explore the street food scene, you will find stalls selling takoyaki, which are octopus balls, yakitori, which are grilled skewers, and taiyaki, which are fish-shaped cakes filled with sweet filling.\n\n2. Italy\n\nSkip the Domino’s and go straight to the source. While Italy boasts breathtaking scenery and architecture, a rich culture, and an impressive history, it is most known for its delicious cuisine.\n\nThe first thing you must try is Italy’s iconic pizza, renowned worldwide for its thin crust and rich toppings. Whether you prefer the classic Margherita with fresh tomatoes and mozzarella or a gourmet variation, it is something you don’t want to miss out on.\n\nItalians pride themselves on their handmade pasta. From the hearty spaghetti alla carbonara, made with creamy egg and cheese, to the spicy kick of spaghetti all’Arrabbiata, tossed in a tomato and chilli sauce.\n\nOf course, no visit to Italy is complete without savouring gelato, a velvety-smooth dessert originating from the country. Made with a higher proportion of milk to cream, gelato has a lighter texture and more intense flavours. Whether you opt for classic flavours like pistachio and stracciatella or unique combinations, such as fig and ricotta, you won’t regret it.\n\nThe best countries for solo travelling on a budget\n\n1. Colombia\n\nIf you are looking for one of the best countries for solo travelling on a budget, Colombia is a great choice. The average travel cost in Colombia is only around US$30 to US$50 per day, including accommodation, food, transportation, and activities.\n\nMedellín is a great example of Colombia’s appeal. This city, once known for its troubled past, has undergone a transformation. It retains its rustic charm with friendly locals and traditional celebrations. In Medellín, you can enjoy nature by visiting Arvi Park or the botanical gardens.\n\nStreet food is delicious and inexpensive, with meals typically costing between US$5 and US$10. Public transportation, including buses and the metro cable system, is efficient and cost-effective, making it easy to navigate the country without breaking the bank.\n\n2. Malaysia\n\nMalaysia is another good country for solo travel on a budget. The average cost of a day in Malaysia is less than US$60.\n\nMalaysia has efficient and inexpensive public transportation, including buses and trains, making getting around convenient and cheap. Street food in Malaysia is delicious and budget-friendly, with meals typically costing between US$5 and US$10.\n\nOne of Malaysia’s highlights is Penang Island, which is known for its long history and tourist attractions. A visit to Penang is incomplete without exploring Georgetown, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This capital city showcases a mix of Chinese, Malay, and European influences.\n\nThe best countries for solo travel for adrenaline junkies\n\n1. South Africa\n\nIf you’re an adrenaline junkie looking to go on a solo adventure, South Africa is one of the best countries for that — though other parts of Africa are worth exploring too. Known for its stunning landscapes and culture, South Africa also offers many thrilling activities that will test your courage and ensure you have an unforgettable experience.\n\nCape Town, in particular, is a hotspot for these experiences. If you ever wanted to swim with great white sharks, now is the time. The waters around Cape Town, especially Shark Alley, are home to the highest population of great white sharks in the world.\n\nBut if that is too scary for you, there are many land-based thrills you can enjoy as well. You can try abseiling down Table Mountain, descending its steep cliffs, while enjoying the view of the city and coastline.\n\nFor those who prefer surfing, Cape Town’s coastlines have some of the best surfing conditions in the world. Hout Bay at Dungeons Beach is famous for its huge waves, attracting surfers from around the globe.\n\n2. US\n\nIf you want the adrenaline but are scared of the water, the US has much to offer, especially Las Vegas.\n\nWhile the City of Lights is known for its themed hotels, bustling nightlife and glittering casinos, Las Vegas offers many thrilling activities beyond the flashing lights and slot machines — one of the best thrills is the SkyJump from the Stratosphere Tower. At 855 feet, this leap from the 108th floor will give you a rush like no other as you plummet towards the ground.\n\nIf you crave more heights, you could try the Slotzilla zipline over Fremont Street. As you fly down, you’ll zip through neon lights and over crowds, watching the city from above.\n\nYou could also take to the skies with Sky Combat Ace. Here, you can barrel-roll in a fighter plane, experiencing the same manoeuvres as military pilots. This once-in-a-lifetime experience is sure to get your adrenaline pumping and leave you breathless.\n\nThe best countries for solo travel for a self-discovery trip\n\n1. Indonesia\n\nIf you are on a journey of self-discovery, Bali, Indonesia, should be at the top of your list. Known as one of the best countries for solo travel, it offers a rich culture, beautiful landscapes, aesthetically pleasing cafes, and lively bars.\n\nThe Balinese charm is loved by many. The locals are incredibly friendly, and many speak fluent English, making it easy for you to navigate around the island.\n\nIf you are looking for some quiet introspection, you can explore waterfalls, rice terraces, jungles and pristine beaches. For example, the Tegalalang Rice Terraces and the Kanto Lampo Waterfall are perfect for some alone time and reflection. Bali is also a surfer’s paradise, with beaches like Uluwatu attracting tourists worldwide.\n\nThe island is home to many temples, such as the famous Uluwatu Temple and the peaceful Tirta Empul, where you can experience traditional Balinese rituals. You can take a yoga class in Ubud, hike Mount Batur for a stunning sunrise, or snorkel at Blue Lagoon Beach. If you are interested in local crafts, you can join a Bali cooking class or make your own silver jewellery.\n\n2. India\n\nWhere else would you go for a self-love trip than the birthplace of yoga?\n\nIndia is known for its spiritual depth. Religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism all originated in India, which is why there are many sacred sites and spiritual retreats.\n\nFor example, Varanasi, one of the oldest cities in the world, is a religious hub where you can witness ancient rituals on the ghats of the Ganges River. Rishikesh, often referred to as the Yoga Capital of the World, has many ashrams and yoga centres where you can deepen your practice of meditation.\n\nIndia’s wellness and retreat centres also make it a great destination for self-discovery. Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine, is widely practised, with many wellness retreats offering holistic treatments and therapies. Places like Kerala and Goa are known for their Ayurvedic spas and wellness centres, where you can rejuvenate your mind and body.\n\nDisclaimer: This article was last updated on July 26, 2024."
