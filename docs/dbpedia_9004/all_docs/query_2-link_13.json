        "text": "Ahoy the forum from the coast of Maine.\n\nI haven't played out solo or in a band for decades (agreed, that's way too long!), but I'm starting to get the \"itch\" to get back into it -- for the challenge & fun, not for the money. I'm curious what you all think about the number of songs needed for a 3-hour solo gig playing background music (solo piano, or maybe with a 2nd board for pads & synths) during a brunch, lunch or dinner at an upscale brew pub or pub-style restaurant.\n\nAt 4 minutes per song, that's 15 X 3 or 45 songs, but I'm thinking I'll have twice that number for sure to change up the mix based on the clientele, or to allow for a few requests of styles/groups/songs. Some of you might have 2 to 4X that many songs already memorized; or possibly even more songs, if one used some lead sheets on an iPad.\n\nAny thoughts on the number of songs, and the use of an iPad/lead sheets to expand your playlist for this type of gig?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nOld No7\n\nBackground music gigs are different from a stage band or concert gig.\n\nMost of the audience will eat, drink, talk and laugh; paying little or no attention to the noise in the background. That doesn't mean they won't be appreciative of the music. Don't take it personally.\n\nFor Popular music, a repertoire of 50 songs at a minimum will get through 3 hours without repetition. It also provides enough variety that in the event someone does request a tune and it is not within the repertoire, an alternative can be played. Of course, being able to read music opens the book.\n\nImprovisation goes a long way too. Jazz musicians have the luxury of improvising on tunes. As a result, they can play the same tune for 10 minutes or something similar reducing the number of tunes actually being played.\n\nPlay well enough to add to the ambience but keep in mind that it's not a concert. Time flies on those gigs. Have fun.😎\n\nYeah, if you're the story of the night, you need to pay attention to \"how long is too long\" and have a nice arsenal of tunes to draw from. Particularly if it's been a long time, you'll find the songs go by faster than you expect. Though if you're the boss of the time, I don't think the old \"45 on, 15 off\" is as relevant as it used to be. If anything, people are more likely these days to do a very long first set and nice healthy break, so that your second (last) set is maybe an hour at most, often even less. Two long sets--particularly if the first one is very long--feel easier than that grind of on-off-on-off from the past.\n\nBUT...if you'll be background music, ten minutes a song is not unthinkable at all, with a nice pause between tunes. I've done duos and trios where if we did five songs in an hour, even if they were purportedly \"pop\" songs, that was a lot. It's not the song that gets old, it's the vibe. Just have fun with vibe and feel and you can play as many or as few songs as you want.\n\nOne other item people haven't mentioned: it's pretty unlikely that the same people will be there at the end of hour 3, as were there at the beginning of hour 1. if it comes to it, for a first time out of the gate I wouldn't rule out having your first five or so songs, also be your last five.\n\n3 hours ago, MathOfInsects said:\n\nOne other item people haven't mentioned: it's pretty unlikely that the same people will be there at the end of hour 3, as were there at the beginning of hour 1. if it comes to it, for a first time out of the gate I wouldn't rule out having your first five or so songs, also be your last five.\n\nI still affectionally call solo gigs \"Musical Wallpaper\". They notice when you start, they notice when you stop.\n\nWhen I had a steady Hotel gig in NY I used to sneak in crazy songs ( Zeppelin etc.) and inside joke songs when friends would visit- and pretty certain no one else noticed.\n\nAs Math said, most crowds are fluid and in transition. I did lots of Norstrom mall, and still do Airport gigs. In the course of a 5-6 hour shift, I absolutely repeat stuff- but play it in a different style for my own amusement and to fight the boredom. Especially with Holiday tunes. Worse case, the bartender or hostess may notice, but not often.\n\nThe beauty of using an Ipad loaded with a bucket of Real books and charts, is you can cover just about anything- and also try new stuff out if solo. In the old days, all I had was my memory and what I brought on paper.\n\nI try to play to the room, but know I'll never be able to make any tweens or under 20's happy - and will sound goofy trying. I try not to pander, but if someone comes up and lets me know they're visiting from a particular country, (e.g. Brazil, Italy, Germany) I'll lean on some regional stuff.\n\nI play mostly the American Songbook, 60' -80's tunes and a ton of Jazz & Latin. Often do min-sets of 3 or 4 songs (e.g. Sinatra, Beatles).\n\nThis topic is right on time: my last long 4 hour gig, I realized I needed some more current stuff.\n\nI recently went searching and was amazed how little there is out there with most of the new stuff like Billie Eiish not really lending itself. But songs by Adele, Ed Sheeran, and other traditional style singer-songwriters work well. Also been re-working non usual suspects like Toto or Prince.\n\nI'm curious how others feel about this: I've been experimenting with adding some tasteful drum loops (something I haven't done since the 80's...) using SoftDrummer app. I'm just still not sure if it brings it into \"Cheesy Midi Guy Territory\"- but does make it more fun.\n\nA lot of what I do on solo gigs is geared towards keeping myself entertained and engaged. The theory is that if I'm feeling into it I'll play better. The audience may not notice what it is that's inspiring me but, in theory at least, they'll know I'm playing better.\n\nMost of my solo gigs have been on real pianos in places I play regularly, with a lot of people in the audience who hear me over and over while most other people in the audience loosely fitting a general demographic. A scenario like that has pros and cons. The tipping is probably better in places where the audience is more changeable fluid. On the plus side, it's fun to evolve a repertoire that's known to your audience, and then it's sort of like having a new conversation with them every gig. I'd say these are not \"wallpaper\" gigs (I've played many of those too). It's common for regulars to say things to me like \"I like how you played Waiting on a Friend this week, better than last week,\" etc.\n\nRule #1 - nobody is actually listening to you. I could noodle for 20 minutes straight on random chords and as long the progressions were mostly diatonic and I avoided crazy jazz slash chords, you're fulfilling the purpose of the gig - audio wallpaper, as many have noted.\n\nMaybe it's luck that as someone steeped in the jazz end of things I have a pretty big repertoire of tunes I can noodle on 🙂 . Solo gigs can get boring though, and when I'm playing my rig rather than a real piano I definitely include some backing tracks for a few - not the majority - of the songs I play. These are tracks I've sequenced myself with some very decent plugins - there's no corn factor here (IMO anyway!). Who wouldn't want to add a little sonic spice to a three or four-hour long gig? I also like to try playing familiar tunes in new keys, so these kinds of gigs make a good practice session for working on that. Alfie in F#, Caminhos Cruzados in B, etc. That can be fun.\n\nI guess I haven't really addressed the OP's question! OK here's my .02- try some improvising inside each song you play (you know, noodle!); go for a few choruses. That will probably reduce the number of songs needed! Solo on a few verse sections, or modulate to a different key then go back to the original key - knock yourself out, again, nobody is listening!\n\nI play solo piano in a high end restaurant every weekend.\n\nI do roughly 12 songs per set but it depends on the songs. I do American Pie but not all those verses because it’s instrumental. On the other hand I do Hotel California complete including guitar solo and Bohemian Rhapsody so those are both pretty long.\n\nI have over 300 songs on my iPad, and occasionally get a request I don’t have but often I can find it on MuseScore or if I know it well enough, I’ll use ultimate guitar for chords and lyrics. I’m not singing but if I haven’t heard the song in a few years the lyrics help remember the melody.\n\nI more or less structure sets based on demographic.\n\nUsually older diners are earlier so my first set is heavy in 60’s and 70’s and lighter fare.\n\nSecond set is younger and some families with kids so a few current pop songs and classic Rock. I try to keep up with stuff like We Don’t Talk About Bruno or the current Bloody Mary Sped up type thing.\n\nThird set is heavier stuff, Guns n Roses, AC/DC 90’s pop like Wannabe, Baby One More Time, and slower material as I wind down.\n\nI’m in Canada so I always do a Tragically Hip tune or two. If I see some cowboy hats I do some country. If it’s very old I through in 50’s and classic movie stuff. I make up a set list each night but rarely follow it to the letter.\n\nI think you get almost a psychic ability to intuit what’s songs will go over and bring in tips.\n\nI also try to think outside the box and do songs people don’t expect a restaurant pianist to do.\n\nI play 2-4x 4hr gigs each week as a solo act, without any backing tracks or loops. Just mic and guitar straight into the mixer.\n\nThis means I have no way of slyly extending the length of a song, there's nothing to hide behind.\n\nI play about 13-15 songs per set, with 15 minute breaks.\n\nSome nights I wind up playing for longer.\n\nThe maths says, you would need about 45 songs then, for a 3hr gig.\n\nBut the math would be wrong, because there will be nights where you look at your setlist, and instantly skip the next song because it doesn't fit the vibe.\n\nAnd the next one. And the next one.\n\nThen you'll finish a song, and someone will come over and ask if you've got any Luke Combs. Or Johnny Cash. Or country in general. Or Wonderwall. Or whatever, you get the picture. Maybe you do, maybe you don't, the first time.\n\nBut the first time is the only time that's really acceptable (I still haven't added any Luke Combs, in fairness).\n\nSo you're going to need more than 45 songs, just to be a little flexible with the vibe of the room, and then you're also going to need to be adding to your repertoire over time anyway to fulfill common requests. You notice the same genres, artists and even songs are often requested in certain venues, towns or entire regions.\n\n..and you should be adding them, so you keep everyone happy and keep your job.\n\nYour job is to sell alcohol. IMO. Maybe people disagree, but as someone that makes most of their income from playing live music - I feel my job is to keep people happy.\n\nPeople happy = they stay longer. Staying longer = more alcohol bought. More alcohol sales = venue makes more money. Venue makes more money = I get asked back.\n\nI get asked back = my calendar starts to fill out. Calender fills out = have to knock some venues back. Knocking venues back = in a position to raise my rates.\n\nRaising my rates = seen as better. Seen as better = more sought after.\n\netc etc it's a cycle. I've already reached the point where I've raised my rates on some venues, it's been accepted and I've already booked plenty more dates.\n\nMy point here is, you absolutely need more songs than the bare minimum.\n\nFor a first gig - I would get together 50-55 of the most popular songs you know and then add 5-10 commonly requested songs on top of that.\n\nI would recommend a grand total of 0 songs that aren't popular for a first gig.\n\nSo I suppose for a 3 hour gig my recommendation is at least 60 songs, then - all of which are well loved and popular.\n\nYou won't play all 60. But you'll be glad you had some spare at the end. If you turn up with 45 and get asked \"one more\".. then \"one more\".. then \"one more\".. etc etc.. you're kinda boned, yeah? You *need* more than the bare minimum.\n\n..and just as importantly, IMO, they need to be songs people know and love, at least at first."
