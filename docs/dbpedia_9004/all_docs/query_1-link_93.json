        "text": "A debut album is a fickle thing to pull off–especially when it’s your first introduction as a solo artist after being in a mega successful band. Don Henley fell into that trap when he released his first solo single, “Johnny Can’t Read.” In hindsight, Henley thought the song was too controversial. Not necessary because of its lyrical content, but because of its sonic direction. Find out more about why Henley regretted this song, below.\n\n[RELATED: The Bandmate Don Henley Said Didn’t Understand Rock N’ Roll]\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nThe Solo Song Don Henley Thought Was Too Controversial\n\nFootball, baseball, basketball games\n\nDrinkin’ beer, kickin’ ass and takin’ down names\n\nWith the top down, get-a-round, shootin’ the line\n\nSummer is here and Johnny’s feelin’ fine\n\nThough the Eagles went through a couple of evolutions throughout their tenure, their roots were based in country-rock. Even when they decided to amp things up a notch, there were still western connotations in their music. Though fans go on board with a little wavering in the band’s titular sound, Henley was worried they wouldn’t be able to stomach a complete departure.\n\nWhen Henley previewed his debut album, I Can’t Stand Still, with “Johnny Can’t Read,” he completely diverted from the sound he honed with the Eagles. Naturally, some fans found it hard to get on board.\n\nBut Johnny can’t read\n\nSummer is over and he’s gone to seed\n\nJohnny can’t read\n\nHe never learned nothin’ that he’ll ever need\n\n“‘Johnny Can’t Read’ [the album’s first single] was the wrong thing to do,” Henley once said. “It was a little bit too much of a leftfield turn from the Eagles days, and it took a lot of people by surprise. It was too controversial. It pissed people off.”\n\nWell, Johnny can dance and Johnny can love\n\nJohnny can push and Johnny can shove\n\nJohnny can hang out; Johnny can talk tough\n\nJohnny can get down and Johnny can throw up\n\nThe track is a jaunty, upbeat anthem that you’d sooner hear on a Billy Joel album. It was a far cry from Henley’s solo hits like “Dirty Laundry” or “The Boys of Summer.” The latter two songs fit in better with what he had already accomplished with the Eagles. “Johnny Can’t Read” left the listener with a lot of heavy lifting, trying to reframe Henley’s musicality in their minds.\n\nRevisit the song, below. What do you think? Do you find “Johnny Can’t Read” controversial?\n\n(Photo by John Shearer/WireImage)"
