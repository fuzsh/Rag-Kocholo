        "text": "To celebrate Black History Month on my blog, I’m going to be looking at music charts and doing one of my favourite things, an analysis! This time of how many songs on the charts were by Black musicians and make infographics and writing my observations down and providing a list of songs, which will be compiled into a playlist at the end.\n\nObviously, ethnicity isn’t just black and white and focusing only on one group obviously doesn’t tell the whole story and it’s certainly not the extent of diversity (if you read my blog, I talk about musicians from all ethnic backgrounds, nationalities, sexual orientations, and with disabilities too), but I thought this would be interesting to do and look at the trends in music while we’re at it and see the differences between the American and British charts. I’m a big numbers/statistics geek and I love looking at infographics. If that sounds like something interesting, keep on reading!\n\nWhy?\n\nWhy am I only looking at #1s? Two reasons. First one is going to sound silly and we’ll get that out of the way. I’m not paid enough to look at the complete charts for every week for two countries (Donations are very much appreciated though, thank you!). And there isn’t enough time because I want to talk about other things. There’s 52 weeks in a year and multiply that by 30 and that’s 1,560 weeks I need to look at. If it’s a top 40, that’s over 2,000 songs a year I need to look at. If it’s a top 100, over 5,000! That’s tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of songs I need to look at if I were being complete.\n\nThe other reason is more of a practical one, time is a filter. The best and most memorable songs will be remembered, while the more trendy/novelty stuff that didn’t age well goes forgotten. The real test to see if a song is timeless is do Millennials and Zoomers know it? Heck, there’s a lot of stuff from my own late 90s/early 2000s childhood that I forgot about. Plenty of washed up/has been musicians from that time period. Those ones that you might think about one day and go, “Whatever happened to them?”\n\nWhen I was a DJ in university, I spent a lot of time looking at 60s and 70s charts and there were a lot of songs that I didn’t know and I wouldn’t even be sure about my parents remembering, especially when you look at the bottom half of the charts. I know that classic rock radio stations only play a tiny amount of the classic rock that’s out there so it’s not a good representation. However, just because a record makes it to #1 doesn’t mean it’s the best or most remembered one. Famously, The Who’s “My Generation” was kept out of the top spot by The Seekers’ “The Carnival Is Over”. The Kingsmen’s “Louie Louie” was kept out of the top spot by The Singing Nun’s “Dominique”. Which songs do the general public remember more?\n\nThink of looking at chart toppers as a slice of the cake and an idea of what was popular at the time – what everyone was talking about. Obviously it doesn’t cover everything because there are different alternative subcultures and scenes, but it tells us a lot about what average people liked to listen to and what was dominant and who were the very biggest musicians of the decade. If eras were a person, who would that person be? I definitely noticed some interesting patterns. Also cool to see the occasional novelty song or one hit wonder taking the top spot in the chart. For the most part, these #1s are all pretty much remembered today (except for maybe stuff from the early 60s because by now radio stations forgot that was a time that existed), so that’s why I decided to focus on the #1s.\n\nWhy the US and the UK? These are the countries where most of my readers are from and most of the acts on the music charts are from these countries. These are also the two biggest English speaking music markets, so it makes sense to look at the US and the UK because of their cultural significance in the classic rock era. I’m American and I have a big interest in British music, so makes sense to me on a personal level too. America had two pop charts: Billboard and Cashbox. We’re only looking at Billboard because that’s still around and that’s the better known one.\n\nHow?\n\nWikipedia was my best friend in compiling this list (seriously, all researchers use Wikipedia, they just may not be open about it, but I’m an honest person). I looked through the list of #1s for Billboard and Official Charts on there and made my list. From there, I made a spreadsheet and put all the songs in there year by year. Because music charts don’t honour the calendar, there’s often spillover from the previous year because a lot of music was released in the previous year. From there, I look at how many black performers reached #1 and then for a bit of extra fun I look and see if there are any songs written by black musicians (but not necessarily performed by black musicians) that reached #1. Mixed race groups or duets with black musicians will also count and I’ll note them. If the songwriters are also black, I’ll also list their names. If the song is written by a black songwriter, I’ll note it. They’ll all be listed here, decade by decade for both countries.\n\nI’ll be making some fun infographics about this and they’ll be in their own section. I’ll be looking at who got #1s, how long they were #1 on the charts, and what years had the most black #1s.\n\nThe US: The ultimate accomplishment: Having the #1 record in the world’s biggest music market\n\nNot a surprising finding, but the US had more black musicians reaching the top of the charts. Considering more of the most popular black musicians are American (Although not all! There are many popular black musicians from the Caribbean and Europe too), that makes sense. What I’ll do is list the songs and musicians in a bullet point list by decade and then show you some infographics.\n\n1960s:\n\n“The Twist” – Chubby Checker (written by Hank Ballard) – Was a hit in 1960 and 1962\n\n“Save the Last Dance For Me” – The Drifters\n\n“Georgia On My Mind” – Ray Charles\n\n“Stay” – Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs (written by Maurice Williams)\n\n“Will You Love Me Tomorrow” – The Shirelles\n\n“Pony Time” – Chubby Checker (written by Don Covay)\n\n“Blue Moon” – The Marcels\n\n“Mother-In-Law” – Ernie K-Doe (written by Allen Toussaint)\n\n“Quarter to Three” – Gary U.S. Bonds (co-written by Gary U.S. Bonds)\n\n“Tossin’ and Turnin'” – Bobby Lewis\n\n“Hit The Road Jack” – Ray Charles (written by Percy Mayfield)\n\n“Please Mr Postman” – The Marvelettes (written by Georgia Dobbins, William Garrett, Freddie Gorman, Brian Holland, and Robert Bateman)\n\n“Peppermint Twist” – Joey Dee and the Starlighters (Mixed group, song co-written by Henry Glover)\n\n“Duke of Earl” – Gene Chandler (written by Gene Chandler)\n\n“Soldier Boy” – The Shirelles (written by Luther Dixon)\n\n“I Can’t Stop Loving You” – Ray Charles\n\n“The Loco-Motion” – Little Eva\n\n“He’s a Rebel” – The Crystals\n\n“Our Day Will Come” – Ruby & The Romantics\n\n“He’s So Fine” – The Chiffons (written by Ronnie Mack)\n\n“If You Wanna Be Happy” – Jimmy Soul (based on a song by Trinidadian musician Roaring Lion, Rafael de Léon)\n\n“Easier Said Than Done” – The Essex\n\n“So Much In Love” – The Tymes (written by George Williams and Bill Jackson)\n\n“Fingertips” – Stevie Wonder (written by Clarence Paul and Henry Cosby)\n\n“Hello, Dolly!” – Louis Armstrong\n\n“My Guy” – Mary Wells (written by Smokey Robinson)\n\n“Chapel of Love” – The Dixie Cups\n\n“Where Did Our Love Go?” – The Supremes (written by Holland-Dozier-Holland)\n\n“Baby Love” – The Supremes (written by Holland-Dozier-Holland)\n\n“Come See About Me” – The Supremes (written by Holland-Dozier-Holland)\n\n“My Girl” – The Temptations (written by Smokey Robinson and Ronnie White)\n\n“Stop!

In the UK, it was the early 70s, late 70s, and mid-80s.\n\nA lot of correlation with the previous charts and no real surprises with this one.\n\nDifferences? Observations?\n\nNow that I’ve listed the number ones, let’s talk about some things I noticed while collecting the data and analysing it. For me, it’s not enough to just show you the numbers and a list of songs. I want to educate and talk about the charts as a whole in the classic rock era.\n\nSurprising and interesting findings\n\nThere were definitely some names that I was shocked that weren’t on the list like James Brown, Sam Cooke (although he did get a #1 in the 50s), Martha Reeves & The Vandellas, Sam & Dave, The Isley Brothers, Curtis Mayfield, Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, Bob Marley, Tavares, and Parliament-Funkadelic. I was also surprised that Booker T. & The MGs didn’t have a #1 with “Green Onions” (it did reach #3 on the Billboard charts though) – that one to me is a classic. Could be my biases speaking as I grew up listening to a lot of R&B and disco thanks to my dad. Another weird thing I found is that Jimi Hendrix never reached #1 in the US, his birth country.\n\nOf course, this list isn’t an all inclusive list of the most influential musicians of the classic rock era. These are just some of the musicians with the biggest successes. It is a known fact that throughout modern popular music history, the charts have been segregated in the US. In addition to a mainstream pop chart, Billboard also has an R&B chart and that’s where a lot of the black musicians’ music would chart. It would have to take crossover popularity with white audiences to make it on the pop chart.\n\nAs I expected, the UK’s list has a lot more musicians of Caribbean descent. I was expecting more Motown #1s in the 60s in the UK because I always thought of the UK as a big market for 60s soul and R&B (and in the 70s there was the Northern Soul subculture), but I guess it had the British Invasion to compete with and that was tough competition. I was somewhat surprised that for a few years in the UK in the 60s, there were no black musicians who reached the top spot in the charts. But I’m guessing with the beat music explosion in the mid 60s, the British had home turf advantage and some British Invasion bands got number 1 in their home country, but not in the US. Home turf advantage is real! Likewise, I saw more American acts on the American charts in the late 60s than on the British charts in the late 60s.\n\nThere were more multiracial groups than I expected and I didn’t know some of these bands had black and white band members.\n\nTrends: Who was on the list, genres, and eras\n\nHolland-Dozier-Holland were really a powerhouse and wrote so many hits. Celebrate them like we celebrate Bob Dylan, Lennon & McCartney, and Brian Wilson. It’s a real talent to write so many #1 hits. Whitfield-Strong got a lot of hits too. Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, and Lionel Richie wrote pretty much all their own hits too.\n\nLooking at America in the early 60s (1960-1963), you saw more early rock and roll and some R&B acts on the charts: both male and female groups, but more male groups overall. Musicians who got #1s in the early 60s didn’t reach the top of the charts later since the 60s was a decade of change. By 1964, you saw a takeover from the British Invasion, but Motown was a powerhouse during this time and you saw The Supremes show up over and over again as well as other acts like the Temptations and Four Tops. Generally speaking, don’t be an American rock band in the early 60s hoping to make it. There’s a little thing called The British Invasion coming and it’s incredible how British Invasion acts took over the charts in 1964 and 1965. I was expecting the British Invasion to be dominant for longer, but I guess that’s my bias speaking and I prefer the British side of music in the 60s to the American side of music in the 60s. It wasn’t until 1966 that we finally see a lot more American rock bands making it big, but this time the American acts were new names. The music scene had already moved on and trends changed. However, R&B acts were really popular in the 60s and they were some of the most successful American acts of the decade.\n\nBy 1966 and 1967, American rock music was finding its way back to the top of the charts and it clearly was inspired by the British Invasion. In the late 60s, you saw some psychedelic soul with Sly & The Family Stone and the 5th Dimension, this music had an optimistic, cheerful sound.\n\n1970 was the year of the Jackson 5. Solo musicians like Edwin Starr and Diana Ross had success too. In the early 70s, psychedelic soul turned into straight soul and some funk with musicians like Al Green, The Chi-Lites, The Staple Singers, The O’Jays, Billy Preston, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and more topping the charts. 1974 was the year that disco really started to appear on the charts and it was initially black musicians performing disco, like MFSB, The Hues Corporation, George McCrae, The Ohio Players, Earth, Wind & Fire, and Van McCoy. Like with any kind of music pioneered by black musicians, white musicians later tried their hand at it and you saw multiracial group KC & The Sunshine Band on the charts and later ABBA and The Bee Gees making their own disco music, but there were black musicians still topping the charts with disco like Thelma Houston, The Emotions, Marvin Gaye, Donna Summer, and Chic. If the late 70s belonged to any musician, I’d have to say it’s the Bee Gees, or rather the Gibb family as a whole. Movies like Grease and Saturday Night Fever really influenced the music tastes and charts, at least in the US.\n\nOnce we reach 1982, disco is dead for sure and rock and roll has taken over again (although in 1980 and 1981 you did see rock and roll chart toppers), but not for long as things get poppier and synth-driven as time passes. 1983 and 1984 were the years that belonged to Michael Jackson and Prince, who had just released Thriller and Purple Rain, respectively. Both incredibly iconic albums. Then, by 1985 you have Whitney Houston, I have to say the 80s were successful years for her. 1987 rolls around and Michael Jackson is back with Bad.\n\nBritain followed America in a lot of musical trends, but I noticed some differences. Of course, being the UK, they’re gonna have a lot more British acts that Americans aren’t as familiar with like Cliff Richard, The Shadows, Adam Faith, and Helen Shapiro. There were multiracial music groups before Sly & The Family Stone in the US, but in the UK, there were The Foundations and The Equals, both of whom had hits before Sly & The Family Stone.\n\nWhere the two countries really diverge can be seen in the early 70s. In the US, the charts had poppier music and more soul music. Meanwhile in Britain, glam rock took over big time starting in 1971 with artists like T Rex, Slade, Sweet, Wizzard, Suzi Quatro, Mud, and Alvin Stardust. I knew that glam rock was much more of a British thing, but I didn’t think about the fact that it wasn’t that dominant in the US, although I’m sure there were Americans who loved glam rock. It really took over and I couldn’t believe it. Maybe it was even bigger of a takeover than the British Invasion charts wise? Of course other kinds of music existed like prog rock, but that certainly wasn’t chart friendly due to the long song lengths, and you also had hard rock, but whatever tops the charts and wins the awards is gonna be lowest common denominator music, not necessarily the most technically proficient and groundbreaking music, no shade to any poppy music, but simple sells. Complicated sci-fi/fantasy themed epics with multiple movements aren’t conducive to radio airplay. That’s more like a bathroom/smoke break song.\n\nThen, in 1976, glam rock was on the decline for disco and poppy music. In the 80s, things get a bit different in the UK. You see some ska, which was bigger in the UK than in the US. Britain loves a good charity record and they’re really into that and those really took off in the 80s, that was the era of the charity single. Another thing that British people seem to love is throwbacks (the Northern Soul scene confirms this), while Americans seem to be all about what’s new. I wasn’t expecting to see “Reet Petite” or “Stand By Me” topping the charts decades after they were released. Now it wasn’t random. In 1986, a claymation music video for “Reet Petite” was made for some BBC programme. Saddest part is that Jackie Wilson didn’t get to see that song top the charts – but he was alive to have heard “Jackie Wilson Said” – both Van Morrison’s and Dexys’ versions. As for “Stand By Me”, that reached #1 on the UK charts because of the movie of the same name using the song in the soundtrack and a corresponding music video with Ben E. King and actors Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix. These aren’t the only examples of throwbacks. After John Lennon was killed, “Imagine” reached the top of the charts in early 1981. Covers of “Ferry Cross The Mersey” and “You’ll Never Walk Alone” that reached the top of the charts in the 80s married two of Britain’s loves: charity records and throwbacks.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nThis was a fun little experiment and I definitely learnt a lot of things, even just looking at the most mainstream songs. I certainly didn’t recognise everything and I’m someone whose special interest is the classic rock era.\n\nI’ll leave you with a playlist of all the songs mentioned above.\n\nShoutout to my friend Patrick for supporting the blog!\n\nLoved this blog post and want to support?
