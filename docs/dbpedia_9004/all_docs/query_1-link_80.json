One of several works for clarinet and big band that appeared during the post-war heyday, the piece was also transformed into a ballet, Clarinade, by George Balanchine in 1964, and later by Eliot Field into a different ballet called Jive. The final movement, Ride Out, is a flat-out driving movement that sounds like a wild, up-tempo improvisation for the whole band with the clarinet taking the lead.\n\n- Program note by MSgt Brooke Emery\n\nDerivations for Solo Clarinet and Dance Band was written in 1955 for Benny Goodman. Subsequently it was recorded on a Columbia album, Meeting at the Summit, with Benny Goodman as soloist and Morton Gould conducting. It was staged as a ballet by George Balanchine and the New York City Ballet under the title Clarinade, and by Elliot Feld and the Joffrey Ballet under the title Jive.\n\nThe work is a highly stylized and structured piece using the jazz vernacular. It is in four self-explanatory movements: Warm-up, Contrapuntal Blues, Rag and Rideout. It is scored for a dance or stage band, consisting of four saxophones, three trumpets and three trombones, string bass, piano and two percussion. There is also an alternate version with woodwinds substituting for saxophones. The playing time is about 17 minutes.\n\n- Program Note by composer\n\nMedia\n\nAudio: United States Marine Band (Timothy W.
