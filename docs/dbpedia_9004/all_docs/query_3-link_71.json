Consequently, women traveling alone are far more concerned about their safety, so when picking a place to solo travel to, start with nations that have a high safety record and gender equality.\n\nPopularity\n\nTourist-friendly countries are easy to explore on your own. They have a steady influx of visitors, a well-developed tourism infrastructure, make it easier to meet fellow tourists, offer more options for day trips, tours, hostels, and other accommodations, and have a more tourist-friendly culture with more English-speaking establishments.\n\nConnectivity\n\nWhen picking a place to visit on your own, you must weigh the options available for solo transportation. Not all places are conducive to rented vehicles or availing public transport on your own. Also look at thescope for internet and mobile connectivity so that you can remain in touch with your family and friends back home.\n\nAffordability\n\nIt’s no surprise that vacationing alone is an expensive affair. Because the expense of a solo trip increases due to single supplements and the greater cost of not having a travel companion, several of the top locations for first-time solo female travelers are countries that are perceived as more economical.\n\nTips for female solo travelers\n\nKnow why you want to travel solo: The “where” of a traveling plan is often intrinsically related to the “why.” Knowing the latter will help you plan your trip better.\n\nBe open to impromptu opportunities: It’s easy to go overboard with planning every detail of your trip. Build in some time to accommodate unforeseen opportunities.\n\nRest well the first night: Be prepared to rest well for the first night because that will decide how the rest of your trip progresses.\n\nTake only what is necessary: A solo trip will not be quite as liberating with multiple large pieces of luggage.\n\nBe careful about sharing your trip information: Everyone you meet on your trip will not have your best interest in mind. Be careful with whom you share your travel and accommodation information.\n\nKeep your documents safe: Losing your identification and other documents can derail your entire trip. Ensure they are well-protected.\n\nFind company when dining: There are several ways to grab a meal with strangers and locals when on a solo trip. Look for cooking classes and themed dinners in the area.\n\nSort out your tech requirements beforehand: In this day and age, it’s difficult to move about without technology. Check that you have the right adaptors, sim cards, chargers, and other essentials before leaving. Also pick a good local sim that gives you connectivity throughout your trip.\n\nMeet fellow female solo travelers: Female solo travelers are everywhere. Look for hostels and online forums that can foster these meet-ups.\n\nMaintain a journal of your trip: Taking a trip on your own can expose unexplored emotions and aspects of your personality. It is a healthy practice to maintain a journal and process everything. After the trip is over, you can even relive the experience by merely opening the journal.\n\nSustainable Tourist Attractions Listed\n\nLakshmi Menon\n\nBorn to parents bit by the wander bug, Lakshmi calls her love for travel \"hereditary and habitual\".
