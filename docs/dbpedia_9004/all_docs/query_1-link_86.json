It is becoming increasingly difficult to assign qualified adjudicators to these festivals due to the large number of performance sites on these weekends.\n\nWSMA understands that scheduling is complicated and is often contingent on facility availability and other extracurricular activities, but there are some options to consider that could alleviate judge assignment and scheduling concerns:"
