WHO: Solo.

HIT WE LOVE: “Heaven.”

HOMETOWN: New York City.

WHAT THEY’RE UP TO NOW: Yup, you guessed it – the group’s original members still sing and perform together around the world.

THE STORY: Like many great stars of the 1980s and ’90s, Solo was discovered and their talents honed by superproducers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. The Minneapolis hitmakers discovered the group singing on a New York City street corner, like many doo-wop groups of the past.

Solo is actually a group of three male singers and an upright bass player, something that made them stand out amongst their peers.

Their self-titled debut included their signature hit, “Heaven,” as well as the follow-up “Where Do You Want Me To Put It,” but despite the group’s success and reputation as electric performers, they fell victim to industry politics. When Jam and Lewis’ Perspective Label folded, the group lost both a label and their producers and weren’t able to continue their run of success.

Still, Solo did record four well-received albums in the 90s and had another modest hit with collaborator Raphael Saadiq with “Touch Me.”

The original members, Eunique Mack, Darnell Chavis, Daniele Stokes and bassist Richard Anderson have reunited and are doing shows, as well as working on a new album due next year.
