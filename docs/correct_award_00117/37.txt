Imre Kertész, Nobel laureate in literature, was laid to rest on Friday at the National Burial Garden in Budapest's Kerepesi Cemetery.

Fatelessness was Kertész' most famous work, based largely on his teenage experiences in Nazi concentration camps. Kertész's work frequently reflected on the fate of the individual in a totalitarian environment.

Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and German parliament speaker Norbert Lammert were among those paying their respects at the service. Kertész lived in Germany for many years before returning to Hungary shortly before his passing on March 31, at the age of 86.

Born in Budapest in 1929, Kertész was just 14 when he was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland in June 1944. He was later transferred to the Buchenwald camp from where he was liberated in 1945.

Among his other books were Fiasco, Kaddish for a Child Not Born, Someone Else, The K File and Europe's Depressing Heritage.
