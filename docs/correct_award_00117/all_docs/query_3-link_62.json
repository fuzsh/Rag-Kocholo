        "text": "NYtimes obit\n\nNobel Literature Laureate Imre Kertesz Dies at 86\n\nKertesz was only 14 when he was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland in 1944. He survived that camp and later was transferred to the Buchenwald camp from where he was liberated in 1945.\n\n“As a child you have a certain trust in life. But when something like Auschwitz happens, everything falls apart,” he once said.\n\nYet Kertesz also made a startling confession that he experienced “my most radical moments of happiness” while at Auschwitz.\n\nImre Kertész (via)\n\n“For writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history”\n\n<> <> <>\n\nA film based on his novel Fatelessness was made in Hungary in 2005 for which he wrote the script.[3] Although sharing the same title, the movie is more autobiographical than the book. The film was released at various dates throughout the world in 2005 and 2006.\n\n“The film had to try very hard to avoid Holocaust clichés,” Mr. Kertész said. “It could be emotional, but never sentimental.” (NYtimes)\n\nFatelessness\n\n<> <>\n\n“I am a medium for the spirit of Auschwitz. Auschwitz speaks through me. Everything else seems stupid to me, compared to that.”\n\nNobel Prize\n\nChildren and Adolescents in Buchenwald Concentration Camp\n\nThe Last Word: Interview with Irme\n\nQ: You’re the first Hungarian to win a Nobel literature prize. How is it to be getting a hero’s welcome?\n\nA: It’s very strange for me because I’m certainly no hero. I’ve always looked on my writing as a very private matter. For decades I had no audience and lived on the fringes of society.\n\nQ: You’ve said that it’s easier to write literature in a dictatorship than in a democracy.\n\nA: That was too sweeping a statement, but there’s a truth to it. Because I didn’t write what the communist government wanted to see, I was cut off and alone with my work. I never thought my book would ever be published, and so I had the freedom to write as radically as I wanted, to go as deep inside as I wanted. In a democracy you have to find a market niche, make sure a novel is “interesting” and “spectacular.” That may be the toughest censorship of all.\n\nSparrow transformed to a dove sitting on top of Saguaro.

She wrote a wide variety of works that were entirely worthy of the award, and she was active internationally. If only she had lived a little longer, she would probably have won. Also, I walked with her a number of times in demonstrations against nuclear power in front of the Diet. It is sad to think that I can’t do that any more.\n\nAsahi Shimbun, February 23, 2016\n\n(Translated by Geraldine Harcourt)\n\nKojin Karatani – and Natsume Soseki (previous post)\n\nTsushima Yuko (wiki) (30 March 1947 – 18 February 2016), known by her pen name Yūko Tsushima (津島 佑子 Tsushima Yūko), was a Japanese fiction writer, essayist and critic.[1] She was the daughter of famed novelist Osamu Dazai, who committed suicide when she was one year old\n\nTakako Matsui and Tadanobu Asano\n\nVillon’s wife\n\nWiki on Villon’s Wife\n\nVillon’s Wife is based on the 1947 semi-autographical short work of the same name Villon’s Wife by Dazai Osamu. The title was inspired by 15th century French poet Francois Villon.\n\nDazai Osamu\n\nDazai Osamu (1909-1948) was born about halfway between Kawabata Yasunari (1899-1972) and Mishima Yukio (1925-1970) and Abe Kobo (1924-1993), and, in that generation following the Pacific War, when Japan was occupied by Americans, his celebrity came in between, too. Kawabata was an established writer while Mishima and Abe were building their early reputations (Mishima to establish his much younger), and Dazai was, for a time, the most distinguished writer in town–so an important 20th century Japanese novelist–making him Mishima’s early competition. And Mishima saw him as representing all that he most despised in post-war Japanese fiction, hated to be compared to him.\n\nDazai Osamu(wiki)\n\nA number of his most popular works, such as Shayō and No longer human (Ningen Shikkaku), are considered modern-day classics in Japan. With a semi-autobiographical style and transparency into his personal life, Dazai’s stories have intrigued the minds of many readers. His books also bring about awareness to a number of important topics such as human nature, mental illness, social relationships, and postwar Japan.\n\nItalian author and philosopher Umberto Eco dies at 84\n\nA great Italian semiotician, essayist, philosopher, literary critic, and novelist has gone where names of roses never fade – – Citizen 5\n\nHis homepage\n\nPlaying music with his wife.\n\nParis Review – Umberto Eco\n\nHis quotes –\n\n“Then why do you want to know?”\n\nBecause learning does not consist only of knowing what we must or we can do, but also of knowing what we could do and perhaps should not do.”\n\nI developed a passion for the Middle Ages the same way some people develop a passion for coconuts.\n\nI have come to believe that the whole world is an enigma, a harmless enigma that is made terrible by our own mad attempt to interpret it as though it had an underlying truth.\n\nFurther, Umberto Eco is an expert on the subject of 007, which adds him to the worldwide group of bondologs (“Bondologists,” Scandinavian expression for an expert in the field of James Bond).\n\nUmberto on Lists.\n\n“I sat with Suzuki on the sofa and we talked of all kinds of things to do with Zen and with life … For once in a long time I felt as if I had spent a few moments with my own family.” (Dancing in the Water of Life, pp. 116-117)\n\n“One had to meet this man in order to fully appreciate him. He seemed to me to embody all the indefinable qualities of the “Superior Man” of the ancient Asian, Taoist, Confucian, and Buddhist traditions. Or, rather in meeting him one seemed to meet that “True Man of No Title”, that Chuang Tzu and Zen Masters speak of. And of course this is the man one really wants to meet. Who else is there? In meeting Dr. Suzuki and drinking a cup of tea with him I felt I had met this one man. It was like finally arriving at one’s own home.” (Zen and the Birds of Appetite, p. 61)\n\nThomas Merton met D.T. Suzuki in NYC in 1964\n\n“Without contact with living examples, we soon get lost or give out …. He really understands what interior simplicity is all about and really lives it. This is the important thing.” (Letter to Anglican priest, Fr. Aelred, Dec. 8, 1964, The School of Charity, p. 254)\n\nSeven Story Mountain\n\nHappy birthday louie louie.
