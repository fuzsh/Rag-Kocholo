        "text": "Imre Kertesz, a Hungarian writer who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in literature for a body of fiction largely drawn from his experiences as a teenage prisoner in Nazi concentration camps, died March 31 at his home in Budapest. He was 86.\n\nHis death was announced by the publishing firm Magveto Kiado. The cause was not disclosed.\n\nMr. Kertesz, the first Hungarian writer to be awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, was 14 when he was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in 1944. He later was transferred to the Buchenwald camp, from which he was liberated in 1945.\n\n“As a child you have a certain trust in life,” he once said. “But when something like Auschwitz happens, everything falls apart.”\n\nYet Mr. Kertesz also made a startling confession that he experienced “my most radical moments of happiness” at Auschwitz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“You cannot imagine what it’s like to be allowed to lie in the camp’s hospital, or to have a 10-minute break from indescribable labor,” he told Newsweek magazine in 2002. “To be very close to death is also a kind of happiness. Just surviving becomes the greatest freedom of all.”\n\nAfter returning to his native Budapest, Mr. Kertesz eked out a living as a journalist and translator.\n\nDistrusted by the communist authorities who ruled Hungary after World War II, he spent his time translating into Hungarian the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Elias Canetti in a small apartment overlooking the Danube River.\n\nInfluenced by the postwar existentialist novels of Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, Mr. Kertesz was fascinated by the fate of the individual in an often totalitarian environment, where others decided his destiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I am a non-believing Jew,” he once said in an interview. “Yet as a Jew I was taken to Auschwitz. I belong to those Jews whom Auschwitz turned into Jews.”\n\nImre Kertesz remembered.\n\n\"Fatelessness\" (also called \"Fateless\"), the novel for which Mr. Kertesz was principally known, appeared in 1975 after a decade-long struggle to have it published.\n\nIt was largely ignored, both by the communist authorities and the public, in a country where awareness of the Holocaust remained negligible, despite the killing of about 500,000 Hungarian Jews by the Nazis and their Hungarian henchmen.\n\nAccording to Mr. Kertesz, the quasi-taboo status suffered by “Fatelessness” for so long may have been rooted in the fact that despite its Holocaust theme, the book also reflected Hungary’s totalitarian communist system under the dictatorial leadership of Janos Kadar, who ruled the country from 1956 until shortly before the democratic changes of 1990.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I wrote ‘Fatelessness’ about the Kadar regime,” Mr. Kertesz said. “Whoever lived in the Hungary of the 1970s had to notice immediately that the author [of “Fatelessness”] knew the present and despised it.”\n\nIn its citation for the Nobel Prize, the Swedish Academy recognized the parallels Mr. Kertesz drew between the Holocaust and life in Hungary after the failed anti-communist revolution of 1956.\n\n“Kertesz’s message is that to live is to conform,” the academy said. “Individual experience seems useless as soon as it is considered in the light of the needs and interests of the human collective.”\n\nMr. Kertesz published numerous other novels, often on the themes of the Holocaust, dictatorship and personal freedom, throughout the 1980s and 1990s, winning professional respect, if not a wide audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll that changed when he won the Nobel Prize, which propelled him to international fame.\n\nWhen he made public appearances in Hungary, hundreds of people stood in line for hours to get his autograph on copies of his books.\n\nIn his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Mr. Kertesz claimed that he wrote only for himself. “I didn’t have an audience and didn’t want to influence anyone,” he said.\n\nImre Kertesz was born Nov. 9, 1929, in Budapest. His parents separated when he was young, and he was assigned to a school for Jewish students before being sent to concentration camps.\n\nAfter he received the Nobel, there was resentment among some of his countrymen that Hungary’s first Nobel laureate for literature was Jewish. Nonetheless, “Fatelessness” has been incorporated into Hungary’s high school curriculum, and Mr. Kertesz was awarded several state honors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong his other books were \"Fiasco\" (1988) and \"Kaddish for a Child Not Born\" (1990) — which formed a trilogy with \"Fatelessness\" — \"Someone Else\" (1997), \"Liquidation\" (2003), \"The K File\" (2006) and \"Europe's Depressing Heritage\" (2008).\n\nA film version of “Fatelessness,” directed by Lajos Koltai and for which Mr. Kertesz wrote the screenplay, premiered in Hungary in 2005.\n\nSurvivors include his second wife, Magda.\n\n—Associated Press"
