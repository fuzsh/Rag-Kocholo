        "text": "The Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded yesterday to the little-known Jewish Hungarian writer Imre Kertész, 72, a survivor of Auschwitz and Buchenwald concentration camps.\n\nKertész's principal novels deal with the horrors of the Holocaust and Auschwitz, where he was incarcerated as a teenager, although he says that the books are not autobiographical. His sales are largely limited to mainland Europe and Israel and he is not even published in Britain.\n\nEnglish translations of Fateless, written in 1975, and Kaddish for a Child Not Born (1990), his best known novels, are published by small university presses in America but they are a long way from being best-sellers.\n\nYesterday morning, before the announcement, the books' rankings on Amazon.com's sales list were 170,435th and 498,955th respectively, although they rose quickly later in the day.\n\nAt the Frankfurt Book Fair yesterday, several British publishers confessed that they had never heard of Kertész, although there were immediate signs of a bidding war for the British rights.\n\nRandom House was said to be leading the field though complicated sensitivities may get in the way. Random House is part of Bertelsmann, the German media group, which was forced to concede this week that it had misled researchers about its Nazi past and had made its fortune under Hitler by producing morale-boosting books for German soldiers.\n\nKertész suffered under both the Nazis and the Communists. Born in Budapest in 1929, he was deported to Auschwitz in 1944 then transferred to Buchenwald where he was liberated in 1945. He turned to novels in the Sixties, returning to plunder the horrors of his youth."
