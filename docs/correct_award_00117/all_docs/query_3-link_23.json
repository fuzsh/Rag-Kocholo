        "text": "The Nobel Prize is considered the most prestigious scientific award. In his will, Alfred Nobel left his fortune to a foundation. Its interest would be distributed in five equal parts as prizes to those who had done the most for humanity in the previous years. The winners would be announced in the categories of physics, chemistry, physiology and medicine, literature and efforts for peace.

In 1915, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for his work on the physiology and pathology of the vestibular apparatus.\n\nMilton Friedman\n\nMilton Friedman was an American citizen. His Hungarian parents immigrated to New York before he was born. In 1976, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy.\n\nDaniel Carleton Gajdusek\n\nLike Friedman, Daniel Gajdekus was a US citizen born in New York. Born to a Hungarian mother, Gajdusek was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1976. He was awarded the prize for his discoveries concerning new mechanisms for the origin and dissemination of infectious diseases.\n\nElie Wiesel\n\nHe was born in Hungary to Hungarian parents. After World War II, he emigrated to France and then to the United States.

He spoke Hungarian with his father and German with his mother. In 1944, a bombing raid destroyed Békésy’s laboratory and instruments. He then travelled abroad, to Sweden and then to America.\n\nJános Harsányi (John Harsanyi)\n\nJohn Charles Harsányi, Hungarian-born Nobel Prize-winning American economist.
