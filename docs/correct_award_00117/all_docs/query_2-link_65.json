Two months later, Gyuri finds himself assigned to a ‘permanent workplace’. This is the start of his journey to Auschwitz.\n\nOn his arrival Gyuri finds that he is unable to identify with other Jews, and is rejected by them. An outsider among his own people, his estrangement makes him a preternaturally acute observer, dogmatically insisting on making sense of the barbarity – and beauty – he witnesses.\n\nRandom House Publishing, paperback\n\n9781784872151"
