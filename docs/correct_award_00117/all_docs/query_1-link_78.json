Judges also said his writing \"upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history\". In his acceptance speech, he said he only wrote the novel for himself. \"I didn't have an audience and didn't want to influence anyone.\"\n\nBorn in Budapest in 1929, Kertesz was sent to Auschwitz as a teenager along with thousands of Hungarian Jews. He was then transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp, where he was liberated from in 1945. He reportedly once said: \"As a child you have a certain trust in life. But when something like Auschwitz happens, everything falls apart.\"\n\nNotable deaths in 2016\n\nShow all 42\n\nFollowing liberation, he lived most of his life between Budapest and Berlin.\n\nHis best-known novel, Fatelessness, described the experience of a 15-year-old boy in concentration camps and was published in 1975 after a decade-long struggle to have it published.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Magda.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters and Associated Press.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
