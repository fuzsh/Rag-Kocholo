He had become wise, but also careworn. Yes, he could have been wise and cheerful, but that was not to be. His fate would not let him go. These damned circumstances. ... With his fate and his fatelessness, Imre Kertész shows us the way forward. We must not disfigure the 21st century. ... Don't let things get you down, and be viligant at all times. Perhaps that was Kertész's last message. Let's remember it at all times.”\n\nMérce (HU)\n\nMérce Country of media outlet Hungary Language of media outlet Hungarian Type of media outlet Website Area of distribution Nationwide Political orientation Left-wing Publisher Kettős Mérce Blog Egyesület Online payment model All content for free\n\nMemory of Auschwitz indelible\n\nAs a chronicler of the Holocaust Kertész showed us how we will never ever be able to erase the memory of Auschwitz, writes philosopher Gáspár Miklós Tamás on the blog portal Kettős Mérce:\n\n“We know all there is to know about the Auschwitz phenomenon yet it remains an unsolvable, silent and unspeakable secret, Kertész said. … We don't know if Imre Kertész was right. Naturally we hope he was wrong given that his truth, insofar as it is the truth, is unbearable. But he couldn't bear it. That's where his famous smile came from. And his famous sentence that writing and even life itself are superfluous. We continue to live and to write, and if Imre Kertész was right we do so at the cost of forgetting Auschwitz. But that is impossible.”"
