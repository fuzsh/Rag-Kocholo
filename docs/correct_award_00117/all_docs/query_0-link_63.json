        "text": "After Auschwitz to write poetry is barbaric a philosopher once concluded. A long line of poets and novelists have thought otherwise and yesterday the Nobel Prize in literature went to Imre Kertesz a Hungarian novelist and Auschwitz survivor.\n\nHonoring the 72-year-old Budapest Jew for his uncommon single-minded gift for saying the unsayable the Swedish Academy singled out his 1975 debut novel \"Sorstalansag\" (\"Fateless\") about a young man who is taken to a concentration camp but conforms and survives.\n\n\"For him Auschwitz is not an exceptional occurrence\" the academy said. \"It is the ultimate truth about human degradation in modern experience.\"\n\nKertesz was deported in 1944 to Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland then to the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany where he was liberated in 1945. Of the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust some 600000 were Hungarian.\n\nKertesz is the first Hungarian to win the award worth about $1 million.\n\n\"My immediate reaction is one of great joy. It means very much to me\" he told The Associated Press in Berlin where he is on a teaching scholarship.\n\n\"There is no awareness of the Holocaust in Hungary. People have not faced up to the Holocaust. I hope that in the light of this recognition they will face up to it more than until now\" he added.\n\nSince the end of World War II writers and scholars have debated how to make art out of the Holocaust and whether they even can and should. \"To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric\" the philosopher Theodor Adorno wrote in 1949.\n\nBut Primo Levi Elie Wiesel and Paul Celan are among many survivors who turned their experiences into acclaimed literature. Even some Jews who were spared the Holocaust such as Cynthia Ozick and non-Jewish authors such as William Styron (\"Sophie's Choice\") have written highly regarded books.\n\nKertesz was honored for writing \"that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history\" in the citation by the Swedish Academy.\n\nWiesel an Auschwitz survivor who won the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize applauded the award.\n\n\"He is a great writer\" Wiesel said. \"His style and his approach are of such high quality that he deserved to be given the highest prize in literature.\"\n\n\"Fateless\" and \"Kaddish for a Child Not Born\" his only novels available in English are part of a trilogy on Holocaust themes.\n\nThis story appeared on Page A2 of The Standard-Times on October 11 2002."
