        "text": "1. Imre Kertesz (Source: Imre Kertesz, The Art of Fiction No. 220, Paris Review) Presented by: Dammar Singh Saud\n\n3. Introduction of Imre Kertesz  Imre Kertész was a Hungarian author and recipient of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Literature, \"for writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history\". Wikipedia  Born: November 9, 1929, Budapest, Hungary  Died: March 31, 2016, Budapest, Hungary  Spouse: Magda Kertész (m. 1996–2016), Albina Vas (m. ?–1995)  Movies: Fateless  Awards: Nobel Prize in Literature, Kossuth Prize  Books\n\n4. Central Idea of the text This is an interview of the world famous writer Imre Kertesz taken by the interviewer, Luisa Zielinski, of Paris Review. It describes how he became a great novelist and the major features of his writing which is based on the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history of Hungary.\n\n5. Short Biography of Imre Kertesz  Noble Prize winner novelist of Hungary  Born in 1929 in Budapest, Hungary, into a Jewish family  Noble Prize in Literature in 2002  Major novels: Fatelessness (1975), Fiasco/Disaster (1988), Kaddish for an Unborn Child (1990) and Liquidation (2003)  Memoir: Dossier K. (2006)  The Holocaust and aftermath are the central subjects of his best novels  Holocaust represents a rapture (break) in civilization\n\n6. Short Biography of Imre Kertesz  His novels are about the Holocaust i.e. the killing of millions Jews and other people by the Nazis during World War II  “Auschwitz”(an industrial town in Poland; site of Nazi concentration camp during World War II) is everywhere by Kertesz means the bitter experience that he had in a terrible world by Nazi’ holocaust  His wife, Magda was an attentive hostess  Deported to Auschwitz in 1944  Died in 2016\n\n7. Major points of the text  The environment of the room is elegant and high-ceilinged in which Luisa Zielinski took Kertesz’s interview.  At the age of 6 or 7 without knowing why, he wished a journal as a gift.  He chose writing by trying to write, rewrite and improve what was written and realized to be a writer at the age of 24.  A man turns into a writer by editing his own texts.  His financial circumstances weren’t good to be a writer.  Writing is an existential dimension which can awaken and change our life.\n\n8. Major points of the text  It took a long time for him to learn even the basics of writing and he spent 13 years to bring his first novel “Fatelessness” which was written during 1960s and 1970s.  The oppressive years of communist was the main reason in to control the writer’s freedom.  It was the totalitarian system that interested the writer most as a subject to rise which is so difficult to convey in words.  Having to craft new language and style is the fundamental principle of the novel.  Language, form and plot are the three important things for writing a novel.\n\n9. Major points of the text  In his novel “Fatelessness”, he invented a boy as a protagonist because anyone in a dictatorship is kept in a childlike state of ignorance and helplessness. For that reason, he not only had to create a specific style and form, but he had to pay close attention to temporality.  Based on the writers experience, Stalin,s regime is different from German Nazis; though they both are about the socialism. In Stalin’s regime, man simply had to going if he could. In contrast, the Nazi regime was a mechanism that worked with a such brutal speed that “going on” meant bare survival. Thus, Nazi regime was much cruel than Stalin’s regime.\n\n10. Major points of the text  Three phases in literary sense: the first phase is the one just before the Holocaust, the second phase deals with the continuation of old values and the third phase examines the loss of old values and creation of new values/radical tradition from such immense suffering.  Writers like Primo Levi have written Holocaust literature for media without going to real field or ignoring to include the real events happened. Thus, Kertesz hits the horrors of the Holocaust.  Writing is the means of survival. So, he managed to describe those horrors in acceptable and bearable part of this radical tradition.\n\n11. Major points of the text  The writers like Jean Amery or Tadeusz experienced various sorts conflicts in their days because they examined the loss of the old values and conceived their works for people who were already familiar with history. These writers focused on the creation of new values from such immense suffering and conflict.  Although he tried to write a play, he worked in the field of novels because he was slave of his passion and subjects.  The purpose of literature is for people is to become educated and entertained.\n\n12. Major points of the text  His experience was the price he paid to enter into literature.  In the beginning, he didn't want to commit suicide, but then he didn’t want become writer either.  He was interested in examining how different people coped with the regime change, thus, he met many people, read their biographies, and listened their stories.  Readers appreciation is the greatest happiness and pleasure for writers though writing itself is a challenging job.  His diaries, reports and experiences are the sources for his novels.  His novel, “liquidation” was written on the basis of ups and downs of the 20th century history."
