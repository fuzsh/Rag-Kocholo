        "text": "Budapest: Imre Kertesz, a Hungarian author and Holocaust survivor who became the nation’s first to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, has died. He was 86.\n\nKertesz passed away in his Budapest home early Thursday morning after a long illness, Judit Balazs, secretary at Magveto, the publisher of his works including the novel “Fateless,” said by phone. She didn’t provide any further details.\n\nKertesz, who was deported from Budapest to Auschwitz in 1944, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2002 “for writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history,” according to the Swedish Academy, which chooses the prize winner.
