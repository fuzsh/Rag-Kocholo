        "text": "Still hasn’t set in...but today the Savannah Bananas and Party Animals will make their MLB debut and play in front of 41,000 fans at Minute Maid Park in Houston. Eight years ago when we started the Bananas I never thought we’d play at a Major League Stadium. In fact, after selling only a handful of tickets in our first few months, I was just hoping fans would believe in us enough to give us a chance. The reality is that at the time we were just a small college summer baseball team playing in Savannah. We hadn’t earned fans support yet, because they hadn’t experienced our show. We simply had a goal to make baseball fun and create a fans first experience…and that led us to creating Banana Ball. It was just three years ago when we took our show and Banana Ball on the road for the first time in Mobile, Alabama. We called it our One City World Tour, because I wanted us all to dream big about what we could do together in the future. I believed if we focused on one fan at a time and went all-in on the show and the experience, the fans would come. Now today as we walked into our first MLB stadium with 200+ people, it was hard not to get emotional thinking about how far we’ve come and how many people came together to make this happen. This is special. And Emily Cole and I are so grateful for the unwavering and unbelievable support in making this happen. We dreamed big. And now so many dreams are coming true and it’s because of the fans and the amazing work of everyone in our organization. While I never got to make it to the bigs as a player, this is so much better because it involves so many more people. Seeing the joy of everyone and the gratitude from the team, the cast and staff means so much. And now my whole family is here to be a part of it. Now, we got to deliver and put on our greatest show. This is our moment. Let’s do this!\n\nStill hasn’t set in...but today the Savannah Bananas and Party Animals will make their MLB debut and play in front of 41,000 fans at Minute Maid Park in Houston.

This is our moment. Let’s do this!\n\n“Can we shut up about the Detroit lions already? Who cares, it’s some sweaty, overpaid men running with a ball.” As a born and raised Detroiter, I debated (in my head) for days on how to reply to this statement. To some the concept of “sports” might sound “silly.” Yes. Sweaty men running with a ball is what some might see, but to us, to Detroit, we see so much more. As Detroiter’s we’ve seen years of struggle and strife. We’ve seen one of the most influential cities in the world at one time, basically burn to the ground. But we stayed. We rebuilt. We continued to rise. We’ve seen our Tigers, our Red wings, our Pistons (yes, even now we still love them) succeed and win. But our lions, they respresent Detroit. We’ve stood behind them through the years of struggle. Our grandparents and parents and loved ones who are no longer with us, are all with us in spirit right now. You see, the Detroit Lions don’t just represent football to our city. They bring us together. They represent hope. So, whatever happens this Sunday. We thank you for reminding us just how important having “hope” is. Just saying. Don’t forget the wipes."
