The days of long lines at the Casting Office and giant Open Calls are over. What now? Whether you are new to the business or a long-time veteran – this updated course will cover how to build and sustain a career in acting that depends on talent, dedication, smarts, and adjusting to interacting in a digital world with populations that hire actors.\n\nThe primary focus five-hour workshop is on work in the New England market, but work in New York, Los Angeles, and emerging markets (Atlanta, New Orleans, New Mexico) will also be covered.\n\nTopics covered will include: a good picture and resume, self-tape auditions, marketing, networking, building online acting profiles, SAG-AFTRA vs. Non-Union, Zoom auditions and callbacks, job expectations after you are hired, and much more.\n\nScripted material will be handed out, and participants will do a practice audition on camera, with critiques and pointers to follow.\n\n———————————————————\n\nBEGINNER: BASICS OF ACTING - BATES WILDER\n\nThis is and introductory course suitable for those with no prior training or exposure to acting techniques, or for anyone who is interested in exploring acting as a powerful and enjoyable means of self-expression. Acting is the ability to behave believably under imaginary circumstances. Through a series of structured off-camera exercises devised to work with and develop an actor's skills in the areas of imagination, listening, concentration, focus, and response - you will begin to learn this ability.\n\nActing is a craft, and learning the components of an acting technique take time and practice! You are on your feet in every class, participating in each exercise - developing confidence and developing an understanding of the Basics of Acting!\n\n———————————————————\n\nINTERMEDIATE: SCENE STUDY & CHARACTER ANALYSIS - BATES WILDER\n\nUsing contemporary film and TV material students will develop the acting skills needed to better understand the elements of script and character breakdown. This off-camera workshop is designed so that students work every week on learning practical tools for working with a scene partner, and working alone on a monologue. As a teacher, Bates looks for students strengths and challenges in order to design individual exercises that help create complete characters and acting moments.\n\nThe class is designed for: Beginning Actors who have studied the basics and are ready to work with scripted material, and aspiring Actors interested in learning how to interpret scripts and develop a scripted character\n\n———————————————————\n\nINTERMEDIATE: AUDITIONING FOR FILM & TV - KYLE CRAND - ZOOM CLASS\n\nCP Casting has cast dozens of TV pilots, TV episodes, TV movies and feature films. Get the tools you need to improve your audition performance. Each class will cover different genres (episodic, theatrical, comedy, drama) that will be discussed at the top of the class. Then actors will live-audition during class with pre-assigned scripts. What happens after you audition? What do the director and casting director discuss? As a group, we will watch auditions and Kyle will give feedback on each audition.\n\nHow to approach a particular audition. Why and what certain things are important. How to accomplish them in your audition. How to approach each genre differently. How to research a director’s style and fit your audition to it. If an actor makes a strong choice that’s headed in the wrong direction, but they seem to be right for the role, Casting Directors want to work with them to steer them back in the right direction. Because they’ve already made a strong choice, casting can see they are an intelligent actor and have done the work, which indicates that giving them adjustments, notes, and direction is worthwhile. Learn how to make strong choices in an audition!\n\n———————————————————\n\nINTERMEDIATE: ACTING FOR THE CAMERA - DENNIS STAROSELSKY\n\nThe camera picks up everything...It’s true—so when an actor is thinking about how good or bad of a job they are doing, that’s exactly what the camera picks up. See, our “Actor Thoughts” are mostly insecurities, that’s why it’s crucial for the actor to focus on “Character Thoughts.”\n\nThis course places its emphasis on the actor being able to relinquish their insecurities, and focus on their character’s thoughts, through a style of acting known as The Thought Method. Developed by Lesley Kahn, this method requires the actor to identify their character’s arc of thought, each thought informs the actor as would a blueprint inform a contractor. However, the actor, unlike the contractor, has the luxury to choose their character’s thoughts. This process is what creates the organic thought necessary to achieve a multilayered character. The challenge is how does an actor fuse organic thought while staying within the parameters of all the different genres the camera produces?\n\nThe successful marriage of organic thought and technical proficiency produces a well-executed performance that is original, evocative, and memorable. That’s why we’ll be exploring almost every genre of Film/TV in this course!\n\n———————————————————\n\nADVANCED: AUDITIONING FOR FILM & TV - KYLE CRAND - ZOOM CLASS\n\nThis advanced on-camera auditioning class is designed to deepen the craft and technique of actors who are currently out in the professional world auditioning and working in film and television. Using longer and more challenging scenes, learn to re-define yourself as the storyteller, not the \"reader of lines.\" How to tell the story and live fully with minimal movement, and to react from what you HEAR, not what you say. These days shows are faster paced and you must keep up in the audition room! INSTRUCTOR APPROVAL REQUIRED.\n\nInterested in the Advanced class with Kyle?\n\nSend your resume for approval to: info@cpcasting.com\n\n———————————————————\n\nADVANCED: ACTING FOR THE CAMERA - DENNIS STAROSELSKY\n\nThere is more to acting than what you see on screen. Actors must develop the skills that are foundational to their craft and to marketing themselves within the entertainment industry. The purpose of this course is to create the Actor-Entrepreneur--a reflective, resourceful, and resilient professional who can express a well-defined type that is received by industry professionals as humanized and effective.\n\nThe work in this course builds upon learning gained in the intermediate level Acting for the Camera, specifically the fundamentals of The Thought Method, while expanding from a lab setting into one of practical application. The material chosen is specifically designed for each student to strengthen their technical knowledge as well as their personal essence. When a student has an audition to prepare, we as a class will work on getting the best possible outcome for this real-world opportunity. Consider this going to the gym for your career!
