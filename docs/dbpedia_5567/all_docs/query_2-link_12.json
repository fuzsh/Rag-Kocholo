        "text": "I saw him many years ago Off Bway in Sam Shephards Fool For Love opposite Katy Bates. He was great. He was very good as gay character in love with Gene Hackmans character in No Way Out. Never thought about his sexuality before. He is an excellent underrated character actor.\n\nThere used to be a Will Patton fan page with a forum (this is the early aughts) where people speculated endlessly about his sexuality. Several people said they knew him from a distance in North Carolina where he lives part of the time--and it was assumed that he was gay. Then other people insisted they also knew him and that he's been with the same woman for years.\n\nAnyway. I'll add to the chorus. I dig him. So versatile and mysterious. A real actor's actor."
