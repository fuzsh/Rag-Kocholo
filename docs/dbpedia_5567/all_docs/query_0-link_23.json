        "text": "It was late 1968 or early 1969, and one of Hollywood’s greatest was gearing up for his next role, in which he’d play a fellow as outspoken and anti-authority (and anti- a lot of things) as the actor himself.\n\nTo get into character beforehand, the performer often strolled around outside his house, dressed as the object of his work. One Sunday, he hadn’t, at least not yet.\n\nAbove the actor’s house that day, the clouds suddenly opened, and an object fell from the sky. No, it wasn’t anything divine; a helicopter needed to make an emergency landing in his field.\n\nTwo marines leaped out of the chopper, and asked the actor if they could call for help. He agreed, and they stepped into the home.\n\nThat’s when they truly found out who they were dealing with – at least, they thought!\n\nThe soldiers noticed a uniform on the door, belonging to one of the most notorious figures in U.S. military history.\n\n“Sir, you will not believe where we landed,” a solider gushed to his command over the line. “We landed in General Patton’s field, and we’re here with General Patton right now.”\n\nThe main problem? George Patton had been dead for nearly a quarter-century.\n\nA few months after the incident, however, someone else would become him – and make film history.\n\nLike the man he portrayed, George C. Scott was famous for the time and effort he put into his craft and the results he obtained from it, although he once admitted that he only acted because he didn’t know how to tackle any other areas (it’s easy to imagine Patton saying the same thing about military service). Also like Patton, Scott never had a problem telling others, even those who signed his paychecks, exactly what he thought of them, and what was going on.\n\nTerms like diplomatic and political corrected-ness were as foreign to Scott as the irregular verbs of the Mende language. Those who didn’t know him personally got a taste of his opinionative clout when it came to a certain Patton accolade, something that echoed across the nation.\n\nIt was such an attitude, along with the heavy drinking that he’d carry through his life, that alienated Scott, not so much from film audiences, but from directors, fellow actors, and ultimately, even his four wives and six children. It even hastened the end of his life, as he refused to have an aortic aneurysm treated, suffered with it for five years, and died of it on Sept. 22, 1999.\n\nLike all of us, George C. Scott had his flaws; on Patton, however, he’d be about the only one to find any.\n\nThough the first shot wouldn’t be filmed until Feb. 1969, a production on the general’s life had been in development also since the early 50s. Then obstacles started popping up like the Axis ones that Patton troops had taken out across two continents and several countries in the Second War (tragically, the general would die just seven months after the war ended, injured in a tragic car accident).\n\nThe first was his family. Patton’s widow Beatrice fought production until her 1953 death, and his children, with the aid of the government, kept it in neutral for over a decade afterward.\n\nThen screenwriting issues came about. Francis Ford Coppola churned out a script, but Twentieth-Century Fox, and director William Wyler didn’t like it, particularly the opening, when Patton barks at viewers as though they’re his troops. James Webb redid the script, but Patton’s character was deemed too one-dimensional. Finally, Edmund North came onboard, fiddled with Coppola’s work, and turned in a finished project.\n\nCasting issues came about, with Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, Lee Marvin, and just about everyone else turning down the role. Fox head Darryl Zanuck contacted Scott after seeing him in The Bible, but therein brought some more problems; Wyler, who’d fired the star from the 1966 romantic comedy How to Steal a Million, bailed to direct Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl. Franklin Schaffner, who’d made the impossible plausible and damned us all to hell in Planet of the Apes, headed in to direct a more (sort of) realistic type of battle.\n\nAfter all that, it was Scott’s time to get into character. A bigger fan of Coppola’s even-handed script than Webb’s, he didn’t want the film’s subject to come across as a hero, or not only a hero; Patton once slugged a tired subordinate, and advocated a military attack on the Soviets even after Truman dropped the H-bombs.\n\n“I simply refused to play George Patton as the standard cliché you get from newspapers all the time,” Scott explains. “I didn’t want to play him as a hero just to please the Pentagon, and I didn’t want to play him as an obvious, gung-ho bully either. I wanted to play every conceivable facet of the man.”\n\nPhysically, Scott went to the extreme to be the man. Moles were attached to his face in Patton’s exact spots. Scott shaved his head and wore a grey crewcut wig. His legendary hooked nose (not quite to Jimmy Durante’s level, but still pretty well known) was filled in and shortened with putty. His dentist fixed some tooth caps identical to the general’s. Scott did, however, use his own naturally croakish voice instead of Patton’s high one, feeling that the audience would be sidetracked (such a tone might have lowered the self-confident masculinity that military leaders so desperately need).\n\nWorking from the inside of himself to find that of Patton, Scott poured over a dozen biographies of the man, some several times. He watched news show after news show about the man. Chances are, he capitalized on the similarities between the two and yanked them into the limelight as well.\n\nEven beyond that, Scott had some lost time to make up for; like thousands of young men in the years after Pearl Harbor, he’d joined the military at high speed, just wanting to be the one who fired the bullet that killed Hitler, Mussolini, and Hirohito all in a row.\n\nBut as he was training at Parris Island, “they dropped the bomb and the war was over. I felt like General Patton – they stole my war.” The depressed soldier spent the rest of his service with no one left to fight. Now, he had a chance to resnare a shot at glory, to become someone who many credit (in various capacities) to bringing home the victory.\n\nAided by some authentic war equipment that America had gifted to Spain during the 1940s, and the Spanish Army standing in for Patton’s troops, filming got under way across Spain, chosen because its land was similar to those that had hosted Patton’s battles.\n\nAfter a flareup of Scott’s lifelong eye problems nearly derailed the project, his personality caused other issues. There’s one scene in the general’s Sicily headquarters when he diagrams a strategy to outrun Montgomery, of the British army, from Sicily to Messina. Problem is, such a move would leave General Omar Bradley, an advisor on the film, and his troops alone in Sicily. Scott wanted the scene removed because it made Patton look uncaring, but officials refused.\n\nThat’s when Scott pulled out some acting “inside jokes” to show his displeasure without the inexperienced audience knowing it. Stepping away from the script, he cursed out Montgomery and slapped the map. To the audience, he was getting deep into character; to the crew, he looked like a jerk.\n\nLater on, Patton told a fellow general about the same action, “If your conscience won’t let you conduct this operation, I will relieve you and let someone else do it.” Scott also wanted this line out to help Patton’s image. Claiming he wanted to show the physical strain that such a line would cause the speaker, Scott did the line laying down. In reality, he was protesting, claiming the general, tired though he might have been, would never have performed such an act, as his intestinal fortitude wouldn’t have allowed it.\n\nFinally, there was Patton’s renowned opening monologue. Scott didn’t really have a problem with the scene itself; he just felt that starting the film with it would set too high a bar for the rest of the film, feeling that it might be so good, the remainder (over two and a half hours long) would be a let down. This time, the joke ended up on him.\n\n“We asked him to shoot (the scene) at the end of the picture,” said producer David Brown, “and never told him we’d used it at the beginning.” Scott did the scene eight times, and wowed everyone in all eight.\n\nStill, he said during filming, in an action that would get a lesser actor blackballed from acting, “Patton was misunderstood contemporaneously, and he’s misunderstood here – and I’m ashamed of being part of it… I’m thoroughly disgusted with the entire project.”\n\nHe was in the minority there. Young audiences, many becoming increasingly ticked with the Vietnam unrest, loved Patton’s refusal to conform to the boring repetition of order-taking and his teenager-esque disgust of those with the audacity to give them. Aided on by a strong review from President Nixon, an older audience headed to the theater as well. After playing second fiddle in The Hustler, Dr. Strangelove, and many other films, Scott was on the mainstream road to success.\n\nBut then, another controversy hit the airwaves like a meteorite: Scott announced that, should he be nominated for an Oscar for Patton – a lock if there ever was one – he wouldn’t accept the award, or even attend the ceremony.\n\nNot because he was upset about losing twice before, or for political reasons, like Marlon Brando would. Simply because Scott didn’t like the concept of the Academy Awards.\n\n“The Academy Awards show is a meat parade,” he said. “Life isn’t a race. It’s a war of survival and there are many who get crippled and injured along the way. And because it’s not a race, I don’t consider myself in competition with my fellow actors for rewards or recognition.” He would accept the Emmys he won and Tonys for which he was nominated, saying that those awards didn’t require the political-like campaigning that the Oscars used.\n\nLiving up to his word, Scott stayed home on Oscar night, in the midst of filming the dramedy The Hospital. Across the country, Goldie Hawn opened the Best Actor envelope and excitedly blurted his name. Producer Frank McCarthy (not sent by Scott) accepted the statue, which is still in storage today. Before the night was out, Patton’s title would be called six more times, including for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay. Today, it’s a landmark in filmmaking.\n\nScott’s rejection, though criticized by many, would end up helping the Oscars’ credibility. No longer would they be known for awarding based on solely on popularity, emotion, or flash (if they ever had). These awards were simply given to the best.\n\nAs a footnote, Scott would reprise his most famous role nearly two decades later for 1986’s TV movie The Last Days of Patton, a film he’d unsuccessfully tried to get into theaters. Unlike the previous film, Last Days introduced us to Beatrice (played by Eva Marie Saint), to whom Patton was married for over thirty years.\n\nIt went over his time as a military governor of Bavaria, and his dismissal by President Eisenhower because of an issue of old Nazi party members under Patton’s employ. Much of the film is spent with Patton confined to a bed after the Dec. 1945 car accident that broke his neck and left him almost destitute for the remaining 12 days of his life. Scott was so incapacitated by the makeshift confining gear across his body and head that he was almost unable to show any expression or emotion.\n\nThe scenes were done in an old war hospital near London. About 300 Air Force troops worked as extras, and Scott got to entertain them out of character.\n\n“I could be at least halfway gracious,” he said, “though it’s not in my nature, I grant you.”\n\nWhether he might have accepted a new award for playing the general is irrelevant; the Emmys didn’t acknowledge the film when it came time for awards. Still, at least one person – one with the credibility to say so – saw it as an improvement.\n\n“This is the Patton I always wanted to play,” Scott said. “The first film was too much blood and guts; too much ‘let’s go over the hill with the tanks and kill everybody.’ This time, we see Patton after his automobile accident, completely supine in bed… I think it’s some of the best work I’ve ever done.”\n\nScott, like Patton, was his own man. Some might call it admirable, some might call it irresponsible, and some might say that it depends on the situation. But rather than generalize about who’s right and who’s wrong, let’s just sit back and admire a wonderful bit of acting – one of many – in which Patton’s casting people, and we the audience, were lucky enough to score upon a connection that worked out for the finest. Some liked Scott, some liked Patton, and some didn’t in either case. But this is just a matter of two people who did their job their way, and a case (or two cases) when it worked.\n\nUltimately, like the man he became so famous for becoming, Scott will forever be remembered as a man who never shied away from a fight. It’s just that sometimes, he had to be the one to start it.\n\nReferences\n\nSheward, David. (2008). Rage and Glory: The Volatile Life and Career of George C. Scott.
