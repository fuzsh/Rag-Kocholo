        "text": "Who got signed, promoted, hired or fired? The Hollywood Reporter‘s Rep Sheet rounds up the week in representation news. To submit announcements for consideration, contact rebecca.sun@thr.com.\n\nThe Skies the limit\n\nFalling Skies‘ Will Patton has signed with APA. He was previously with Paradigm. Patton plays Col. Daniel Weaver on the alien drama, which TNT has renewed for a fifth and final season. The veteran actor recently appeared in Relativity’s espionage thriller The November Man, and his screen credits include Remember the Titans, Armageddon, The Mothman Prophecies, The Postman and No Way Out. Onstage, he received Obie Awards for his off-Broadway performances in Sam Shepard‘s Fool for Love and Richard Foreman‘s What Did He See. Patton has also lent his voice to more than 50 audio books, recording the narration for the 50th-anniversary release of Jack Kerouac‘s On the Road and in 2013 winning Audible’s Narrator of the Year for Stephen King‘s Dr. Sleep. He continues to be repped by Kate Edwards of Grand View Management and attorney Bill Skrzyniarz of Skrzyniarz & Mallean.\n\nDown but not out\n\nEastbound & Down alum Steve Little has signed with UTA. The comic actor played Stevie Janowski — the only constant other than Danny McBride‘s protagonist — throughout all four seasons of the HBO comedy. Little, a main company member of Los Angeles’ famed Groundlings improv troupe, won an Emmy as a writer on Cartoon Network’s Camp Lazlo! His many comedy appearances include Identity Thief and Tammy as well as 30 Rock, The Office, Reno 911, The League, Garfunkel and Oates, Suburgatory, Comedy Bang! Bang! and Drunk History. He recently recurred on Adult Swim’s The Heart, She Holler and is set to appear in ABC’s midseason comedy Fresh Off the Boat.\n\nBrothers stick together\n\nAussie natives Gulliver and Zen McGrath have both signed with ICM Partners. Gulliver, 16, portrayed a young version of Michael Stuhlbarg‘s character in Hugo, then went on to play the youngest member of the Collins clan in Dark Shadows as well as the president’s youngest son, Tad, in Lincoln. He is next set to portray a teenage version of Ryan Reynolds‘ protagonist in black comedy The Voices. Meanwhile, younger brother Zen made his acting debut as, yes, the younger version of a major actor — this one: Cillian Murphy in Aloft earlier this year. Stateside audiences will get the chance to see a lot more of him in Tim Kring and Gideon Raff‘s USA miniseries Dig. Gulliver and Zen are repped by the U.K.’s Artist Rights Group and Australia’s Emma Raciti Management.\n\nShe had a “Good Feeling” about him\n\nCinematographer Dannel Escallon has signed with management company colleen. The Miami native established himself in the industry as DP on Flo Rida‘s music video “Good Feeling” and has gone on to work on music videos for artists such as Chris Brown, A$AP Rocky, Miguel, Rod Stewart and System of a Down frontman Serj Tankian. Escallon also has served as DP on commercials for Bayer, Lenovo, Comedy Central, ABC Family, Skull Candy and the Daytime Emmy-winning Disney PSA “Make Your Mark — Ben Horowitz.”\n\nElsewhere in Rep World:\n\nGabrielle Union Signs With CAA\n\nCAA Signs Latin Music Label Fania Records\n\nWME Signs Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton\n\nCAA Promotes Four to Agent"
