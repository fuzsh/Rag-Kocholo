        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Will Patton, Alicia Sanz, and Adan Canto, and Zach Avery have been tapped to star in a yet-to-be-titled horror film which will shoot in Kentucky next month. Brad Parker (Chernobyl Diaries) is directing the film from a script by Eric Scherbarth and Stefan Jaworski. Julio and Diego Hallivis are producing and financing the pic via 1inMM Productions.\n\nThe plot centers on a geological expedition to an Appalachian sinkhole that becomes a terrifying fight for survival against a mysterious deadly force.\n\nJonathan Sadowski and Chinaza Uche round out the cast. Alejandro De Leon and Andres Rosende are also producing the project with Jared Ian Goldman as an executive producer.\n\nSanz was seen in the Steven Soderbergh-executive produced sci-fi thriller Perfect, which debuted at SXSW, and co-stars in James Cox’s upcoming film Billionaire Boys Club. Canto currently stars ABC’s opposite Kiefer Sutherland in ABC’s Designated Survivor while Avery recently completed filming on Hell Is Where The Home Is, which also hails from 1inMM.\n\nVeteran TV and film actor Patton is known for films like Remember the Titans, Armageddon, and The Postman. His recent big screen appearances include American Honey and Megan Leavey."
