        "text": "American actor (born 1972)\n\nThis article is about the actor. For the musician, see Will Wheaton. For the 19th-century lawyer and baseball pioneer, see William Wheaton.\n\nRichard William \"Wil\" Wheaton III (born July 29, 1972) is an American actor and writer. He portrayed Wesley Crusher on the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, Gordie Lachance in the film Stand by Me, Joey Trotta in Toy Soldiers, and Bennett Hoenicker in Flubber. Wheaton has also appeared in recurring voice acting roles as Aqualad in Teen Titans, Cosmic Boy in Legion of Super Heroes, and Mike Morningstar/Darkstar in the Ben 10 franchise's original continuity. He appeared regularly as a fictionalized version of himself on the sitcom The Big Bang Theory and in the roles of Fawkes on The Guild, Colin Mason on Leverage, and Dr. Isaac Parrish on Eureka. Wheaton was the host and co-creator of the YouTube board game show TableTop. He has narrated numerous audio books, including Ready Player One and The Martian.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nWheaton was born July 29, 1972, in Burbank, California, to Debra \"Debbie\" Nordean (née O'Connor), an actress, and Richard William Wheaton Jr., a medical specialist.[1][2][3] He has a brother, Jeremy, and a sister, Amy,[4] both of whom appeared uncredited in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"When the Bough Breaks\".[5] Amy appeared alongside Wil in the 1987 film The Curse.[6]\n\nAs an adult, Wheaton described his father as being abusive to him as a child and his mother as being an enabler of that abuse. He also stated that his parents forced him to become an actor. He is currently estranged from his parents.[7][8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly work and Stand By Me\n\n[edit]\n\nWheaton made his acting debut in the television film A Long Way Home (1981), which starred Timothy Hutton.[9] He voiced the character of Martin in the animated film The Secret of NIMH (1982), the film adaptation of Robert C. O'Brien's book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971).[10] Wheaton also appeared in Hambone and Hillie (1983), The Buddy System (1984) (opposite Richard Dreyfuss and Susan Sarandon), and The Last Starfighter.[9]\n\nWheaton first gained widespread attention for his work in Stand by Me (1986), the film adaptation of Stephen King's novella The Body.[11][12][13] In Stand by Me, Wheaton played the lead role of Gordie Lachance, a 12-year-old storyteller mourning the loss of his elder brother.[13] In her review of the film, Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Wheaton makes Gordie's 'sensitivity' tangible, but not effete. He's a gem\".[14] In addition to being successful at the box office,[15] Stand by Me was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama[16][17] and became known as a coming-of-age classic.[18][19]\n\nStar Trek\n\n[edit]\n\nWheaton played Wesley Crusher, a \"boy genius and Starfleet hopeful\",[20] during the first four seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation.[21] He appeared in an additional four episodes of the remaining three seasons. The Wesley Crusher character is a \"polarizing\" character; while some Star Trek fans love him, others are vocal about their hatred for the character.[22][21] Wheaton commented about his critics in a 2004 interview for WebTalk Radio:\n\nLater, I determined that the people who were really, really cruel – like the Usenet weenies – really are a statistically insignificant number of people. And I know, just over the years from people who've e-mailed me at my website and people who I've talked to since I started going to Star Trek conventions again in the last five years, that there are so many more people who really enjoyed everything about the show, including my performance, including the character.[23]\n\nWheaton left Star Trek: The Next Generation due to concerns over how the production team addressed a scheduling conflict related to his wish to appear in the 1989 film Valmont.[24][25]\n\nWheaton returned to Star Trek in 2002 and 2022, reprising his Wesley Crusher role in cameo appearances in Star Trek: Nemesis, and in the season 2 finale of Star Trek: Picard.[26]\n\nPost-Star Trek\n\n[edit]\n\nWheaton played Joey Trotta in the action film Toy Soldiers (1991). After leaving Star Trek, he moved to Topeka, Kansas, to work for NewTek, where he helped to develop the Video Toaster 4000 doing product testing and quality control[27][28] and later used his public profile to serve as a technology evangelist for the product.[29]\n\nAfterward, he returned to Los Angeles, attended acting school for five years, and then re-entered the acting world.[30][31] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wheaton appeared in several independent films, including the award-winning The Good Things (2001), in which he portrays a frustrated Kansas tollbooth worker.[32] For his performance in Jane White Is Sick & Twisted (2002) he received the award for Best Actor at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival.[33] In June 2024 Wheaton announced that he was retired from on-screen acting.[34]\n\nVoice work\n\n[edit]\n\nWheaton is known for his voice acting career.[35] He voiced the role of Martin Brisby in The Secret of NIMH in 1981.[36] In August 2021. Wheaton voiced the villainous John Juniper in the video game, I Expect You to Die 2: The Spy and the Liar.[37]\n\nTelevision and web\n\n[edit]\n\nWheaton appeared in 12 episodes in a recurring, guest-starring role on Eureka, playing Dr. Isaac Parrish, the head of the Non-Lethal Weapons Lab at Global Dynamics and a thorn in Fargo's side.[38] Wheaton also voices the character of the former scoutmaster and current sous-chef Earl Harlan in the popular dark, surreal-comedy podcast Welcome to Night Vale.[39]\n\nHosting\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom September 2006 to September 2007, Wheaton hosted a Revision3 syndicated video podcast called InDigital along with Jessica Corbin and Hahn Choi. He hosted a NASA video on the Mars Curiosity rover which landed on Monday August 6, 2012.[40] He has hosted \"2nd Watch\", interviews with cast members and producers of the science-fiction series Falling Skies that appears online after each episode.[41] On April 3, 2014, Wheaton announced on his blog that his new show called The Wil Wheaton Project would premiere on the SyFy network at 10 pm on May 27 for an initial projected run of twelve episodes.[42][43] However, on August 29, Wheaton blogged that SyFy canceled the show after only one season.[44] Wheaton has hosted Star Trek aftershow The Ready Room since the second season in 2020.[45]\n\nOther ventures\n\n[edit]\n\nGames\n\n[edit]\n\nWheaton is a Dungeons & Dragons player,[46] and played during the PAX 2010 event using the 4th edition rules. Wheaton, along with webcartoonists Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik of Penny Arcade, and Scott Kurtz of PvP, played in front of a live audience. The game was hosted and recorded by Wizards of the Coast with Chris Perkins as the dungeonmaster.[47]\n\nWheaton starred in the Kickstarter-funded game There Came an Echo by Iridium Studios.[48] In Dungeons and Dragons Online, he became the dungeon master of the Temple of Elemental Evil quests.[49]\n\nNintendo of America announced on Twitter that Wheaton would be voicing Abraham Lincoln in Code Name: STEAM.[50] Wheaton does the voice narration on the Secret Hitler companion app for the Secret Hitler social deduction game.[51]\n\nWheaton has spoken out against misogyny in video game culture,[52][53] and wrote a profile of Anita Sarkeesian for the 2015 Time 100.[54]\n\nComic book\n\n[edit]\n\nA fictionalized version of Wheaton was included in the comic book PS 238, in which he harbors the power of telekinesis. Wheaton's debut comic book The Guild: Fawkes, which he wrote alongside Felicia Day, was released on May 23, 2012.[55]\n\nNarrations\n\n[edit]\n\nList of narrations Title Author Audiobook release date Additional narrators Peter and Max: A Fables Novel Bill Willingham 2009-12-08 Unknown Homeland[56] Cory Doctorow 2014 No More of the Best of Science Fiction and Fantasy[57] Orson Scott Card et al. 1999-12-15 Yes The Greatest Science Fiction Stories of the 20th Century[57] Greg Bear et al. 1999-12-16 Yes The Criminal Minds Production Diary[58] Wil Wheaton 2009-03-04 No The Adventures of Tom Sawyer[57] Mark Twain 2009-10-21 No Boneshaker[59] Cherie Priest 2010-03-18 Yes METAtropolis: Cascadia[57] John Scalzi et al. 2010-11-16 Yes The Android's Dream[57] John Scalzi 2010-12-07 No Agent to the Stars[57] John Scalzi 2010-12-07 No Fuzzy Nation[60][61][57] John Scalzi 2011-05-10 Yes Ready Player One[62][57] Ernest Cline 2011-08-16 No Redshirts[63][57] John Scalzi 2012-06-05 No Masters of Doom[64][57] David Kushner 2012-07-12 No Trumps of Doom[57] Roger Zelazny 2012-07-31 No Prince of Chaos[57] Roger Zelazny 2012-07-31 No Sign of Chaos[57] Roger Zelazny 2012-07-31 No Knight of Shadows[57] Roger Zelazny 2012-07-31 No Blood of Amber[57] Roger Zelazny 2012-07-31 No V Wars[57] Jonathan Maberry et al. 2012-10-10 Yes Rip-Off![57] John Scalzi et al. 2012-12-18 Yes Just A Geek: The Audio Book[58] Wil Wheaton 2013-11-23 No Dancing Barefoot: The Audio Book[58] Wil Wheaton 2013-12-07 No The Happiest Days of Our Lives: The Special Extended Edition Audio Book[58] Wil Wheaton 2013-12-10 No Dead Pig Collector[57] Warren Ellis 2013-12-17 No Byways: A METAtropolis Story[65] Tobias Buckell 2014-01-30 No Suspect Zero[57] Richard Kadrey 2014-07-01 No If Ever They Happened Upon My Lair[57] R.

He released a revised follow-up, Still Just a Geek, in 2022.\n\nWheaton runs his own blog, Wil Wheaton Dot Net. In June 2005, he became that month's featured Tech writer for the SuicideGirls Newswire.[76]\n\nIn 2017, Wheaton wrote the short story \"Laina\" for the Star Wars anthology From a Certain Point of View.[77] The book features 40 short stories, each by a different author, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Star Wars.[78]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nWheaton campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.[79]\n\nImmediately following the Sutherland Springs church shooting on November 5, 2017, Wheaton on Twitter stated in response to Congressman Paul Ryan's call for prayers for the victims that \"The murdered victims were in a church. If prayers did anything, they'd still be alive, you worthless sack of shit.\"[80] Wheaton subsequently clarified his opinion after receiving criticism, writing \"I apologize to those of you who are sincere people of Faith, who felt attacked by me\", but accused \"the right wing noise machine\" of using his comments \"to deflect attention and anger away from the role that unfettered access to weapons of mass murder played in the latest incidence of mass murder in America\".[81][82][83]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nWheaton married Anne Prince on November 7, 1999,[84] and lives in Arcadia, California, with her and her two sons from a previous relationship.[85] Upon reaching maturity, both sons asked Wheaton to legally adopt them, which he did.[86]\n\nWheaton was roommates with Chris Hardwick while Chris attended UCLA.[87] They met at a showing of Arachnophobia in Burbank, California.[30]\n\nWheaton has struggled with alcohol addiction.[88] In January 2021, Wheaton announced he had been sober from alcohol for five years.[89]\n\nWheaton lives with complex post-traumatic stress disorder,[90] generalized anxiety disorder,[91][92] and chronic depression.[93][94] He supports mental health nonprofit organizations in raising awareness for these conditions.[95][96]\n\nHe criticized Dave Chappelle for making transphobic jokes after his The Closer special. Wheaton said popular comics had influenced him to think homophobic humor was acceptable when he was young.[97]\n\nIn 2022, Wheaton participated in Celebrity Jeopardy!, playing for the National Women's Law Center. He reached the finals, defeating Troian Bellisario and Hasan Minhaj in the quarterfinals, and John Michael Higgins and Joel Kim Booster in the semifinals.[98] He finished in third place, behind winner Ike Barinholtz and runner-up Patton Oswalt, earning $100,000.[99]\n\nHonors\n\n[edit]\n\nYoung Artist Awards: 1989 & 1987\n\nMelbourne Underground Film Festival: Best Actor (2002)\n\nInternational Academy of Web Television Awards: Best Host (Pre-Recorded) (2014)[100]\n\nSaturn Awards: Lifetime Achievement Award – The Cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation (2024)[101][a]\n\nAn asteroid was named after him: 391257 Wilwheaton.[102]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilms and television films\n\n[edit]\n\nList of appearances in films and television films Year Title Role Notes 1981 A Long Way Home Donald Branch Television film 1983 Hambone and Hillie Jeff Radcliffe 1983 13 Thirteenth Avenue Willie Television film 1983 The Buddy System Tim 1984 The Last Starfighter Louis' friend 1986 The Defiant Ones Clyde Television film 1986 Long Time Gone Mitchell 1986 Stand by Me Gordie Lachance 1987 The Curse Zack 1987 The Man Who Fell to Earth Billy Milton Television film 1987 Young Harry Houdini Ehrich Weiss 1988 She's Having a Baby Eloy 1991 Toy Soldiers Joseph \"Joey\" Trotta 1991 The Last Prostitute Danny Television film 1991 December Kipp Gibbs 1992 Star Trek 25th Anniversary Special Himself, Wesley Crusher Television documentary 1993 The Liars' Club David Reynolds 1995 Mr. Stitch Lazarus 1995 It Was Him or Us Scottie Television film 1996 Pie in the Sky Jack 1996 Boys' Night Out Marco 1997 Trekkies Himself Documentary 1997 Flubber Bennett Hoenicker 1997 Tales of Glamour and Excess Danny Sugerman 1998 The Day Lincoln Was Shot Robert Lincoln Television film 1998 Fag Hag Himself 1999 Foreign Correspondents Jonas 2000 The Girls' Room Charlie 2000 Deep Core Rodney Bedecker 2000 Python Thommy 2001 Speechless...
