        "text": "Abigail watches from a\n\ndistance as the man disrobes. A modestly-handsome Asian man, he has no name, and freely abandons his towel to dowse himself in a tub in the middle of an\n\nabandoned studio space. She flinches, waiting for the right moment to seize the\n\ntowel, to trap him within his own nudity. He’ll be vulnerable, she believes,\n\nand they’ll make love. She’s never found love in this city, and now this\n\nstranger with bare skin with take her as her own, and she’ll feel valuable for\n\nonce in a life of solitude.\n\nThis is the setup for\n\nexperimental drama “Abigail Harm,” which provides a showcase for underlooked\n\nveteran of stage and screen Amanda Plummer. Her Abigail is only the latest in a\n\nlong line of protagonists who can never find something and instead opt to take\n\nit. She doesn’t seem fulfilled, but is otherwise content filling her days as a\n\nreader for the blind, providing the eyes for those without them. Intimacy is a\n\nforeign concept to her; she struggles through describing pornographic material\n\nto one client (Burt Young) not because she’s turned off, but because the allure\n\nof physical attraction eludes her.\n\nOne such elderly client (Will Patton)\n\ntakes enough of a shine to her that he makes her a promise; he’s going to tell\n\nher where to find a man. He speaks of a memory that sounds abstract and\n\nunreliable, talking about a stolen towel near a bathtub leading to a dalliance\n\nthat was purely physical, and completely fulfilling on a spiritual level. It\n\ndoesn’t seem that Abigail could find that exact specific setting, but when she\n\ndoes, it feels so far removed from the film’s New York City setting that it\n\nmight as well be on Mars.\n\nThe man (Tetsuo Kuramochi) shrinks\n\nand surrenders to her offering of a towel, but amusingly, he doesn’t\n\nimmediately sexually pursue her. Instead, he shows his thankfulness by\n\nfollowing her home on account of her pet-like urgings, as if he is indebted.\n\nWith very few words of English in his skill set, the two of them begin a\n\nflirtation based on both of their obvious needs. As director Lee Isaac Chung\n\nplays with montage and dream logic storytelling, it’s hard to see who is\n\nfalling for whom, and why. If anything, it’s almost like a jousting match, one\n\nside daring the other to blink. The word “love” is tossed around: it feels like\n\nit emerges from equal parts politeness, and desperate longing."
