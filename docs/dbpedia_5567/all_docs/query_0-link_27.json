        "text": "Will Patton (Armageddon, The Puppet Masters, The Punisher, The Mothman Diaries) has been cast in the now-filming David Gordon Green-directed Halloween. He will play a cop in the film Universal Pictures will release on October 19, 2018.\n\nBloody Disgusting broke the news over the weekend that Several rising young talents have joined the cast, including Virginia “Ginny” Gardner (Project Almanac, Marvel’s “Runaways”), Miles Robbins (Mozart in the Jungle, My Friend Dahmer), Dylan Arnold (Mudbound, Laggies, When We Rise), and Drew Scheid (“Stranger Things”, The War with Grandpa). They will be playing the school friends of Andi Matichak’s character, Allyson.\n\nAs previously announced, Jamie Lee Curtis is back as Laurie Strode in next year’s Halloween, which will take place after the original classic and disregard *all* of the sequels. Judy Greer has been cast to play Karen Strode, Laurie’s daughter, while Andi Matichak recently landed the coveted role of the film’s young lead (daughter to Greer and granddaughter to Curtis).\n\nAs we previously reported, actor, director, and screenwriter, Nick Castle, will return to the role of Michael Myers, while stunt performer and actor James Jude Courtney has also been cast to play Myers!\n\nAlso on board is Academy Award-winning make-up and VFX artist, Christopher Nelson (Suicide Squad, Deadpool, Sin City, Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2).\n\nIn Halloween, co-written by Danny McBride, “Laurie Strode comes to her final confrontation with Michael Myers, the masked figure who has haunted her since she narrowly escaped his killing spree on Halloween night four decades ago.”\n\nWhile Castle originated the iconic role in John Carpenter’s 1978 horror classic, Tony Moran also donned the infamous Michael Myers mask in the film. Carpenter will score, executive produce and serve as a consultant on the film.\n\nMcBride shared the follow on-set photo to celebrate Carpenter’s birthday.\n\n[Source] Tracking Board\n\nPublished in 2020, author Adam Cesare gave rise to a new slasher villain in the horror novel Clown in a Cornfield, and a horror movie adaptation is on the way.\n\nEli Craig (Tucker & Dale vs. Evil) will direct the movie adaptation of the young adult slasher novel, which comes courtesy of Protagonist Pictures Limited and Sony Pictures.\n\nClown in a Cornfield has been rated “R” this week for…\n\n“Bloody horror violence, language throughout and teen drinking.”\n\nWriter Carter Blanchard adapted Cesare’s novel, which has now spawned two sequels. Clown in a Cornfield 3: The Church of Frendo was just released on August 20, 2024.\n\nHere’s the official synopsis for Adam Cesare’s slasher novel…\n\n“Quinn Maybrook and her father have moved to tiny, boring Kettle Springs, to find a fresh start. But what they don’t know is that ever since the Baypen Corn Syrup Factory shut down, Kettle Springs has cracked in half. On one side are the adults, who are desperate to make Kettle Springs great again, and on the other are the kids, who want to have fun, make prank videos, and get out as quick as they can. Kettle Springs is caught in a battle between old and new, tradition and progress. It’s a fight that looks like it will destroy the town. Until Frendo, the Baypen mascot, a creepy clown in a pork-pie hat, goes homicidal and decides that the only way for Kettle Springs to grow back is to cull the rotten crop of kids who live there now.”\n\n“We love Eli Craig’s brand of scary fun and are thrilled to be working with him on this terrifying slasher adaptation that is both timely and timeless,” said Temple Hill producers.\n\n“Nostalgia driven, elevated horrors that deliver on the promise of the genre – thrilling action, heart-stopping suspense and deeply satisfying endings – continue to dominate at the global box-office,” said Protagonist CEO Dave Bishop. “Our friends at Temple Hill are masters of taking this critical formula and creating wholly original stories that surprise, delight and gratify audiences and Eli is the perfect visionary to bring this special project to its full potential.”"
