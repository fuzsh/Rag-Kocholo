        "text": "Good evening to you all, Falling Skies fans, and all you other sci-fi junkies just joining us! This is Bryan, the formerly missing in action cohost of… The Rob.\n\nTonight, we have with us Mpho Koaho, also known as the heavy ordinance toting Anthony in Falling Skies.\n\nThank you so much for joining us, Mpho!\n\nSo before we start talking Falling Skies and skitters, let’s talk about you and what I’ve been reading you’ve been acting for about fourteen years, which accounts for about half of your time being alive. What made you decide to become an actor?\n\nI can honestly say that I’d always been a performer. I can remember doing talent shows for an organization over here in Canada called the Toronto Parks & Recreation. So what they would do is they would set up talent shows with different parks through different neighborhoods and I guess I was one of the few kids that would get to go to, I guess, the larger competitions or whatever. So I can remember being about seven/eight years old, you know, performing in talent shows. I remember this one talent show; I think I recreated “The Way You Make Me Feel” video. I’m talking about frame for frame. I’m talking about; I watched Michael Jackson and just did the whole video; I got like my neighbor’s older sister to be like the chick in the video, you know what I mean? I’ve been doing it man, so it was almost a matter of time. It was almost a matter of time type of thing. That’s always how I looked at it. It was a matter of time and now being in the game, fortunately for as long as I have, it’s more about getting better and longevity and understanding what it takes to be a credible actor, a respected actor, to know my craft.\n\nSo what was the first role that really pulled you in?\n\nThe first one, my goodness, I think probably it wasn’t until… and to be fair the first movie I did, Down in the Delta, was a great challenge. You know I was very young. I was very novice in the art and with the craft, very novice with the craft. So I was coming in there more just my raw ability. The kid that just kind of thought that he could do it and kind of wanted to just hang around, but I think probably when I did my episode of Kojak with Ving Rhames, is when I think I actually kind of started to kind of feel it a bit. The subject matter was pretty serious. I kind of got into it. I can honestly say I can remember I think I probably the first time ever really cried on screen. So just little spots like that and then it kind of started to happen I think. In terms of me being more aware of what I was doing.\n\nI’m always curious about this: How exactly…I guess in your case, how do you make yourself cry?\n\nI always believed, especially actors, if you look at the really good actors they can turn that stuff on and off. Forget whatever A-list that’s created by Hollywood and forget whatever perceptions are. The really good actors can turn that stuff on and off. And to me preparation as well, helps you in that. But for the crying it’s just you can just do it or some people turn it off, some people take time to do it. Myself I can kind of just do it. I can do this.\n\nI’m a very quick study, very quick study. Emotionally, if my tweets do justice to the person that I am, you know I’m very outgoing. I can express emotion very well, very easily.\n\nAnd that’s kind of an interesting aspect too because looking at some of your acting history you’ve jumped through many different genres from horror with Saw to sci-fi with Falling Skies, which movie genre has really been your favorite to do so far?\n\nLet me tell you something, Bryan, I remember you asking me on Twitter about if there was anything I wanted to be asked, well you know brother, that’s a great question. I really give you a lot of credit for that, because I’ve never been asked anything like that. That’s just a quality question. I’ll tell you what brother it’s when you get to touch like a little bit of everything I think you’re just appreciative to do the diversity of things that I’ve done. I think that’s what it comes to. You’re just happy and thankful to be able to do something different. So I don’t know if I can sit here and tell you I like one more and this and this and I’m in love and then you know I’d make-out and cheat on the other one, no, like it’s all fun, brother. You know it’s fun to go do Saw and then to turn around and then go do the 50 cent and then to turn around and go do Blindness and then to turn around and then come do Falling Skies you know turn around do MetaJets now, we got like this animated thing that I did. Do you know what I mean, brother? I want to continue to be able to do a diverse level of projects.\n\nAnd that’s a good thing for an actor because it’s great to have the ability to do just about anything they can throw at you.\n\nExactly, brother, and that’s the idea. That’s always been the idea. That’s the attitude. That’s kind of how I’m trying to carve out the path.\n\nSee, what I really like about that, that means if you keep jumping like that, you’re not going to get typecast and that’s really important these days. I mean typecasting, it’s been happening to everybody for years, but it always leaves you open.\n\nYeah, brother, well said. That’s the goal too and also for a while there I did the 50 and Four Brothers and I did this Canadian project called Doomstown and the auditions started to get eerily similar, started to get eerily similar. I remember asking my agent, I was like, “How do we prevent this from happening?” I go, “You see I’ve been going to this audition, said gangster audition, said thug audition, said pimp audition, you dig?“ So it got to the point I was just like, all right, being aware of the fact that I still have to audition for everything…I kind of had to stop and you have to think, you’re like, “okay. What do we do? Do we stick to my guns, not go to certain auditions and suffer in the short term? But in the long run you could argue and, forget arguing, I’m sure that it would pay off.” And my agent – not that he didn’t believe because my agent is like my dad and he’s always believed in me – but he almost did…I’m black and he’s not so he doesn’t know how to navigate that. Do you know what I mean? Period. So I had to make a decision and I’m like, “look, okay. I’m not going to go to certain auditions. I’m going to stop going to these thug auditions. I’m going to stop going to these gangster auditions, because that’s not how 1) I want to be portrayed. As a young black man, that’s not how I want to be portrayed and 2) that’s not the only way we are!” So these are the things – I’m so righteous – these are the things that kind of started to come out of me so and again… and again if I got like a… like a wicked gangster role… do you know what I mean? You pick stuff based on the quality, the story, the quality of the work, but also you can’t get stuck doing…I don’t know. That’s just me though.\n\nYeah, but it’s nice to be able to have the freedom to say I don’t want to do this because I don’t feel that it’s the quality that I should be taking and you can take something else so it’s great that you have those opportunities to do that.\n\nBrother, exactly and I would say, “I try to Johnny Depp the world.” If you can do half of the diversity that that guy’s pulled you’ve done something right. You know what I mean? I think this is what it’s all about. It’s about putting on those different hats. It’s about taking that risk. It’s about relishing the opportunity to try something different. So I always, always, always welcome that.\n\nSo, if you keep that up, does that mean we can call you “Chocolate Johnny Depp?”\n\nHa, ha. You know what, brother? The simple fact that you can even say something like that is cool to me, because I really respect that guy. Now, you pick stardom and you pick all that Hollywood stuff out of it. That’s irrelevant to me. I’m talking about the man, the talent. The man that can be immersed in this world of Hollywood, continuously and consistently knock out good performances and you never see the guy! You know what I mean?\n\nYup, he goes home and he has a normal life.\n\nYou know what I’m trying to say? And that’s the goal. You know this Hollywood thing can get interesting and I’m fortunate. I live in Canada and I’ve been able to kind of steer clear of these things, but LA is in my near future. And better projects and whatever you want to call it, bigger, better, whatever you want to say is in my future. So, I’m going to have to be a bit more immersed in that world. So it’s …the key is just…and that’s a great guy to watch. That’s a great guy to emulate, a great guy to emulate. Not only as an actor, but as a person.\n\nYeah and he’s definitely one of the…, in my opinion one of the youngest character actors out there. He’s one of the few people that really seems to immerse himself that way, the old style, anymore.\n\nSo okay, you play Anthony, who is an ex-Boston PD and you also played an explosives ordinance disposal unit member in Combat Hospital. In your opinion, how do those two roles compare if at all to each other?\n\nIf at all, wow, if at all… well, to be perfectly honest, let’s see, I wouldn’t even…without thinking about it first, I couldn’t tell you the similarities just in the profession.\n\nI think the similarities lie in, I think I would say, one’s mindset as being either one of those people or at least trying to portray either one of those characters. But with Falling Skies, I’m mobile. I can walk. I’m running all over the place. Combat Hospital, I was in a bed. I was paralyzed. I’m in a bed. I’m almost more thrust into one specific emotion or headspace. I kind of got a lot more to do in Falling Skies. So I definitely think there’s a difference, innate differences in that, but I would like to think both professions are intense.\n\nYeah. I would definitely think so, because they both kind of have a militaristic mindset to it or background, right?\n\nYeah. Exactly. I would like to think you’re going to sweat a little bit doing either one, but I tell you what, either one is extremely dangerous. In an ordinance disposal unit member, I mean, that’s patience, calm – in the moment calm – like kind of big game quarterback type…you got to be like Tom Brady to be an ordinance disposal guy because you can’t get too hyped considering what is readily in front of you. And then with a cop, a cop you get to experience a whole heap of stuff in a day let alone in the Falling Skies world.\n\nSo we go into season two and I know a lot of us out there want a lot more lines for Anthony, but the few lines that Anthony had a long dialogue in, he’s the voice of reason for Tom. He’s trying to talk sense into him, reason; you need to get the kids out of here. They’re a hindrance… so on and so forth. What is some of the stuff you’d like to see for him as you move into season two?\n\nI mean listen guys, any actor would want more lines, you understand? Any actor would be lying clean through their teeth if they told you, “No, I’m okay with what I’ve got.” You understand? But the big but is you’re more than honored to be on a show like this regardless of what you got. You understand? I’ll walk you through examples: I screen tested for Stargate Universe. It was down to me and Brian Smith, okay? Me and Brian. After thirty people in the room, okay. Now obviously I didn’t get the part, but it was me and Brian. So I could have very easily been on Stargate and then knocked out after two seasons and been drop-list. But then the universe conspires however it does, and then I end up on Mr. Steven Spielberg’s show and the possibility with this show is infinite.\n\nOh, it really is and it’s a shocker when you look at all of the channels out there that lack any decent sci-fi. We just did an article the other day about how the Syfy channel has really, honestly moved away completely from sci-fi and TNT is blowing it out of the water. And this has the potential to be a very long running series and you’ve got a new writer coming next year Rémi, from Caprica and Battlestar, and he can come up with some really crazy stuff.\n\nI’ll tell you what, I was on Twitter the other day and I’m like, “Who don’t I have from the show?” I was just thinking. I was just thinking. I had just come back from the premiere in LA, which was a lot of fun, and I’m like, “You know what, I’m not following Rémi! Let’s see if Rémi ’s on Twitter here, because we had a wonderful conversation at the premiere.” I got to meet him and his wife and he was extremely nice to me and just very warm. So I followed him on Twitter and he hit me right back! And he goes, he goes, “MPHO!” He goes, “You have no idea what we’re cooking up for you second season, brother.” But, I’ll tell you what, any time you get a big boss like himself – he’s a big dog, creator of a show, the creator of a show, you somebody when you created some shit – so that was a great honor. One, to hear that, and then two, it gets you thinking, “What could he possibly be talking about?”\n\nExactly. He actually hit me up by private message because I’d been talking to him as well, and basically gave the same kind of vague answers that just were like, “Oh God, what’s he going to do, because he’s got ideas in his head?” Yeah and I really can’t wait to see what he comes up with and I know it’s going to be really good. We’re actually crossing our fingers we’ll get to talk to him at some point too, but he did mention the same thing you did: That he’s got a lot more for your character and for Dai as well, so that should be really good.\n\nYou know what? I’m happy to hear that about Peter’s character as well. Peter and I are very close. Peter is just like my brother. Peter is my brother. What am I saying? That is my brother, so I always want to see more of him. As much as you want yourself to receive anything – I’m a very unselfish person – and I very much want to see Peter…I’ll tell you what, if anybody deserves to be on the show and more stuff and just all the blessings in the industry, it’s Peter. Peter’s been grinding over there in LA for a long time. Being from Montreal, Peter’s been putting it in a long time, so I’m extremely happy to experience success with Peter.\n\nWell, it’s nice, because all of you guys – you, Peter, the young cast including Connor and Maxim – I mean you guys are…\n\nColin is somebody as well that’s kind of been owed his due, I would say in a sense. Now, he’d probably never say that to you. Humble guy, he’d probably never say that to you, but I’ll tell you what, that’s one of the best actors walking. I don’t care what anybody says. That guy is extremely gifted at what he does.\n\nI’ve been watching him since X-Files and Stargate and always loved his characters in both and knew about him coming in. Then when we saw all of you guys, really TNT picked…they couldn’t have picked a better cast that not only works so well together on screen, but obviously were so tight off screen, because that certainly has to help when you’re on set with that person, trying to be serious or not, that off screen that you could be that close with one another.\n\nVery much so, brother, and that’s one of the things that I always take with me. Working closely with Mr. Patton was a pleasure. That was a great pleasure for me and I had a couple closer little scenes with him or whatever, but what was cool was you shot about three months/four months with this guy. He never called me Mpho once. This guy called me Anthony for four months. – Just stay with me, there’s more to it. Stay with me. – So then we hit up the premiere over there, in June in LA – shout out to everybody – and I see Mr. Patton, calls me Mpho for the first time ever and gives me a hug. I was like, “Yo. Will Patton just called me by my first name.” I was tripping dude. Four months of working with this guy and the guy never calls me by my first name. We go to the premiere and he calls me by my first name. I was tripping out. Nice man. Legendary. You know that…these are the things I take from the show. These are the things I take from working on this show. Being around individuals like that who have sustained for so long in their craft and who have done consistently great work within that time period and continue…continue to do great work. So I’m fortunate to be around the guys that I’m around.\n\nAnd I’m sure they love being around you guys too. Trust me, because everyone we’ve talked to, they can’t speak highly enough of everybody else because it’s such a tight group.\n\nYeah, brother and you guys; I mean you guys are pretty part of this right now, if you ask me. I mean we talk to you guys as much as we talk to each other. You know what I mean? So much love to you guys always for supporting us the way you do. I mean that’s how we would be allowed and able to go a long time with the fan support and you guys setting up the site and everything and putting in work the way you do. So always thankful, always appreciative of your support and the love that you guys show us.\n\nWell, it’s awesome that you guys talk to us and we greatly appreciate it and we’re really glad to be a part of it and TNT’s been awesome with us as well sending us all sorts of stuff, merchandise to give away, Falling Skies stuff, which is really cool. And we’re crossing our fingers that we can get onto the set this fall. Maybe. We’ll see.\n\nWhat? I’ll tell you what; I think I’ve seen crazier things happen. I’ve seen crazier things happen. I can honestly say that, so yeah, I wouldn’t be shocked. It’d be cool to have you guys out, man. You guys would have a ball, man.\n\nOh, I’m sure we would.\n\nOkay, so, rolling back to the Anthony thing, they’ve made it pretty clear that they’re not going to be doing any flashbacks in the series, but are you at least hoping that they expand upon Anthony’s history with the Boston PD?\n\nOkay. Well that would be very interesting. One, maybe we run into maybe my partner or something, that’d be cool. Maybe somebody I knew at the academy, somebody that worked in my precinct. Something along those lines I think would be very interesting as back-story. I was even thinking maybe something along the lines of a girlfriend or a wife or something that we maybe run into. Who knows? That maybe we actually find, actually, on the way. I don’t know. I’m just…just fishing, but I trust Rémi, though. I can honestly say that as much as you may want to put in your own kind of two cents, you got to trust these guys. They’re in the position that they’re in for a reason and I’m one to trust that. Come on, man. If I’m here and these guys run the show? You get it? So obviously the right minds are in charge. You dig what I’m saying? I don’t run the show. You dig? So I trust that. I trust that and what you do is you kind of just sit back with excitement until you get the script. It’s very much like a little kid. I’m very fortunate to do what I do. I’m extremely fortunate to do what I do. Always thankful that I get to perform in this way and when we get new material it’s like… it’s like with somebody buying a new book that they really like or… do you understand, we’re very privileged in that sense. Know what I mean? And getting new material, the new episode, that’s like the best feeling ever, dude. Especially when you see yourself in it. That’s why like I’m so excited to see what Rémi’s written in for my character.\n\nYeah, I know. You’ve been waiting to get your hands on that, flip through the pages and find out, “All right. What are we doing?”\n\nDude, I feel eight years old/ten years old, right? It’s just… it’s just genuine excitement.\n\nSo, your character, Anthony, and Pope obviously don’t get along. Pope is very cocky. Anthony’s ready to knock him out every few seconds and at the season finale we find Pope holding on to Anthony, who is badly hurt. Where would you like to see the two of those characters go? Are you looking for a confrontation between them? Or do you think that they might get past their differences for a common goal to obviously go after Tom depending on the approach that they take with how the season finale ended?\n\nYou know what? That’s a very sharp, sharp way of looking at that, brother. That’s a very sharp way of looking at that.\n\nI caught that at the end there, brother. You’re sharp. I’ll give you that. I was just like, “Wow.” That’s kind of…I’d really actually like the concept of them uniting. I really do because what I think you’re taking is…you’re taking…you’re taking oil and fire and you’re making it work. You dig? You know what I mean? Or oil and water and you’re making it work. You understand? I just think you’re taking great forces and making those two come together would be crazy. That would be, that’s some straight like Justice League type stuff.\n\nAnd a lot of us are interested and wondering where the writers are going to go with that whole scene at the very end where you’re there with Pope and then Tom gets on the ship, because the question that a lot of people have is: Did that really happen?\n\nI’m actually going to give you a little bit of insight right here. This is that good stuff that you won’t know about until the DVDs released, you know what I mean? Basically, we shot a crap-load more stuff for the finale that I was actually in, right? There was a bit of stuff that was cut prior to me being in Pope’s hands that would have given you better insight into how I got there, right? For example, as far as I know the last time you see me, you go from being seen after Drew leaves and then the very next time you see me is in Pope’s arms. Now, just in that little span of time there was more scenes. There was a little…there was a little…there was…when Captain Weaver was standing on top of the truck giving instructions, giving everybody the ultimatum, I kind of had a little bit at the end of that with Mr. Patton and Pope’s character as well and just a couple little bits, but just of course that it would have added great insight, I think, for the audience. To me it’s all about the audience. As much as I want to be in more of the show…as much as I want to be in every part, it’s more for the audience. The audience would have understood and you would have got to see kind of me and Pope interacting more actually, but it got cut.\n\nYup, yup and actually I think part of that scene was shown in a preview for the upcoming final episode but it wasn’t a scene that was actually used. They kind of briefly showed it for like two or three seconds on the preview.\n\nAnd I’ll jump off a building and I’ll tell you, it was basically, it was myself and Pope in the GTO and then we kind of…we kind of just like go off a bit and then that’s like before we get…before we end up the way you saw us.\n\nEven though I’m saying what I’m saying about it being cut, I don’t really think the show suffered in any way. I think they were still able to get their point across. They were still able to give people enough. They were still able to show the dynamic of Pope helping me, and our brief little interaction of actually getting along, right? But then we also had our little funny little scene on the truck. You know that, I enjoyed that scene very much.\n\nYou got to love those one-liners. I mean they just…. they’re perfect.\n\nHa! Well, I mean you got…you really got to give credit to the Mark Verheidens of the world. Almost as things developed as we filmed more episodes obviously he got a better sense of our abilities and our timing and everything and he would kind of just write in more stuff for me. He would kind of give me cooler stuff. So I’m excited to see what Mr. Aubuchon actually puts in there for me, because I would like them…I would like them to write in some good stuff, because I can do all that stuff. I can do all that stuff. I can do it.\n\nI think in a lot of ways the first season, of course, you’re never sure that’s it’s going to get picked up for a second one right away so you kind of have to write the story that you can be satisfied that if it ended after the first season, even if it was a cliffhanger, that you’re happy with the way the story was going. Knowing now that we’re going to get a second season the writers can switch gears from “let’s make it a stand-alone” to “okay, we possibly have multiple seasons to go here, so we can really focus on interesting story plots for individual characters in the overall stories.” So I’m very excited to see the additional detail that they’re actually going to be going into in season two and I think it’s going to be pretty interesting.\n\nYeah. I agree, brother and look for the show to improve. I’m going to say. You know what I mean? Look for the show to truly improve because now, exactly what you’re saying, we can touch on these. We can touch more on the back-story of certain characters and where they came from and who they are and I think that’s when things can really get interesting. And not only just back-story related to individual characters, we can even start talking about back-story related to the aliens. And I think you’re going to see a lot of that obviously with Tom being lost. Captain Weaver. And I look for the writers to weave everyone in to the main story as best they can. ‘\n\nYup and me personally, I’d love to see some on the alien ship stuff. I think that you could easily get Anthony, Pope on there, using possibly Ben to get you onto the ship given that he has some connection with them so they associate with him and that would be some really cool stuff to see. To get you guys on the ship and to get you some more one-on-one with these aliens.\n\nYeah. Also Ben’s superior physical abilities that displayed I think would come in…\n\nExactly. Yup.\n\nAnd again, with my policing background, my ability to kind of… I think it would be good having my background, obviously where Ben’s characters at, you throw a Weaver in there and you throw a Pope in there and I think with those minds…even a Sarah…a Maggie character. You have those minds. I think we might need all those minds to help Tom in the coming season. Who knows? But these are great ideas to throw around, brother. Always fun. Always fun to throw around.\n\nOh yeah, and I know from what Rémi did on Caprica, that he will throw in some twists that I don’t think any of us are going to expect and I love that.\n\nI love it, brother. I love it. I just want to survive. That’s all. You dig? I just want to survive.\n\nThe number one rule: Make it through the season.\n\nWell, I’ll tell you what, man, if there’s anything you could ask for, it’s that you make it along with everybody else. A perfect world we can all kind of make it to the end and be together as long as the show’s fortunate enough to run for because I really enjoy everybody’s company over there and I’m truly excited to go on this long journey with this group and Noah, everybody. Again, man, just fortunate…fortunate to be part of this great group.\n\nSo do you have any good behind-the-scenes stories? Like any embarrassing stories that you might want to tell about your co-stars they wouldn’t want us to hear?\n\nHA-HA! HA! HA! What do I got? I’ll be honest with you there’s not too much embarrassing stuff because we all pretty much got along and we would always crack jokes with each other but no “crossing the line” type stuff. There was no “crossing the line” type stuff. I could tell you that Colin Cunningham is an extremely gifted magician.\n\nYeah. I’ve heard a bit about that.\n\nOh. But I mean like extremely gifted. Not like little guy, like he’s good. Like that is a well-rounded, talented individual right there.\n\nYeah. We heard from Peter about some of his magic tricks and a little bit of his goofing behind-the-scenes there.\n\nWell, one, the slide of hand stuff that he does is…is incredible. He’s very gifted, very gifted.\n\nAnd we also hear that Noah’s very, very much a jokester.\n\nThe Coyote? The Coyote. That’s my big brother, right there. I got…I love that guy. That guy is actually the quietest… the funniest quiet guy that I know. How’s that? The funniest quiet guy. Very quiet, very controlled, great control of himself. He has great control and is very at ease. He’s done it already. You know what I mean? Very at ease. He’s done it already. ER. He’s done it, so very, very comfortable in his skin, as in no need to show off or be in the light. Do you know what I mean? But he’s a…he’s a funny, funny guy. He can do impressions… a couple impressions very well and he’s always a pleasure to be around.\n\nYeah, that’s what we hear from a lot of people and now that you guys are actually kind of moving out of your backyard, right now you guys are filming season one in Toronto where Daniyah, Connor, you are all from, along with Sarah and Dylan.\n\nShe’s from Winnipeg actually. I think Sara’s from Winnipeg actually.\n\nOh. Okay. I think Dylan’s from that area too, Toronto.\n\nYes, sir, he is.\n\nSo, you guys are all going to be going to Vancouver. Are you guys excited about that?\n\nOh, brother. Me specifically, I’m definitely excited about that. One, I’ve never been fortunate enough to be in Vancouver so it’s my first time going. Definitely excited about that. Second thing I’d be excited about is that I’m still in Canada, so for me it’s like…it’s still like…it’s good because I have peace over there, family over there, family, mutual friends, so I’ll still very much be at home in a sense. Like my currency will still be the same. I can say, “eh?” to whoever I need to, I can play hockey, go skiing, snowboarding…we can go snowboarding actually the whole time that we’re there.\n\nNice, well if you ever come down to the States, we’re here. Come to Florida, sunny beaches, warm weather, it’s fun. Get away from that cold.\n\nRoberto, I appreciate that. Bryan, where you at on the Westside, cuz?\n\nI’m in LA County.\n\nLA County? Hey, man, you seem to have some swagger over there, brother. So I see you over there, man. Listen guys I appreciate that invite, man. I’ll tell you what, Miami would be my thing, like awesome.\n\nAll right, I think we’ve got all the questions answered and we really appreciate you taking the time to chat with us and answer all of our questions candidly and we appreciate everybody there on the cast who’s done that.\n\nOh, you got it, brother. Any time, man. Much love to you guys.\n\nAnything you want to shout out to your fans out there?\n\nOh my goodness. What’s good everybody? I just… I got love for everybody out there. Hit me on Twitter, man. I tell people, “Hit me on Twitter, man.” I know I did my little erase thing on Facebook there, but that was for the best, man. I feel as though…I feel as though I put myself out there for everybody. So if you want to holla at me, please do, and I’ll do my best to truly respond to everything and not just responding to everything just to say that I did it, you dig? Like this is real, this is serious. This is real to me and this is serious to me and I take this very seriously and anybody that would take their time to reach out to me, I value. I truly, truly value. Anybody that would take their time to reach out to me, thank you and I’ll get at you as best I can. Check me on Twitter and let’s chat, but I got you and I love everybody, man. Peace and love to everybody.\n\nWell, we appreciate it Mpho and we will definitely be hearing from you as season two finishes up, I know that Dan and Connor both are going to be doing weekly live video chats on Sunday nights and they’re talking about bringing some of the rest of the cast in on the chats and hopefully you’ll be on there with them.\n\nOH! Well you already know that I’ll jump in one those things guys! Come one now! This is me, guys! This is ME! It’s me, man!\n\nPeter already said that he was going to get Maxim to sneak him into Connor’s because he said Maxim’s got a key.\n\nI know Mama Jessup very well so I can get it. I know Mama Jessup very well so I can get hooked up. Come on, guys! It’s Mpho, son! Come on, son! Do we really have to say that I can’t? Come on! I’m in already!\n\nWell, good! We want to see you there, because that will be fun. We’ll be able to chat with you guys throughout the fall and keep ourselves from going crazy while we wait for Falling Skies to come back.\n\nWell, I’ll tell you what guys, it’d be great. It’d be great, great, great, awesome to give you updates and to keep everybody in the loop as best as we can.\n\nYup and we will as our site, do as the best we can to keep everybody else update and pass that information along!\n\nWell, you know we can’t give away everything, but as best we can brother. You know we got you.\n\nAll right, guys, listen, you already know. Enjoy your weekends. I very much appreciate the interview guys and the love and all the best and we’ll chat on Twitter very soon.\n\nYes, we will. All right. Have a good night.\n\nSame to you guys. Be well!"
