        "text": "Here's one way people act on social media that is actually much better than in person. (Apologies if this post made you hungry) Sharing. It's as simple as that. If one of your friends gets a promotion, in the real world, you wouldn't rush to tell all your other friends, \"Hey, look! This person you don't know got a promotion!\" But on social media, sharing such news is not just common; it's encouraged. It's baked into the system. Their growth helps you grow. Value for their community, is value for yours. It's a unique aspect of digital connectivity that amplifies positive news and accomplishments far beyond our immediate circles. I really don't get the spin that social media is negative and toxic. I remember 4 TV channels and 'the news' 3 times a day. Wasn't so long a go. Now that was over 99% negativity. P.S. If you do find keeping up with the online world a distraction and draining. You don't need to miss out on the growth opportunities. At Brand Around You we will grow your personal brand while you focus on your business or spend time with your kids. Do you think social media is more negative than the 'real-world?'\n\nLet's ask a basic question: Why are we all on Social media? ✨️How much of it is contributing to my growth and wellbeing? ✨️How is it impacting me negatively? Is all the information overload worth? There may be a thousand statistics and industry leaders telling you that \"This is the way\" \"That's how you'll grow\". But just pause a moment and ask yourself, What is growth for you? Choose your spaces wisely.\n\nI went from 1K to 100K followers in 100 days!! You can do it too ⬇ NO, I DID NOT! Not all of us are dedicated to growing our followers at god speed. Not all of us have the ability to be as consistent as others. Not all of us know exactly what we want to pursue. Not all of us want to dedicate our lives to LinkedIn. Not all of us can comment on 25 posts per day. Not all of us are copying other creators. A few of us come and go. A few of us are still figuring it out. A few of us are trying and growing slowly. A few of us just want to find work on LinkedIn. A few of us don’t know what we’re doing out here. A few of us don’t care about the number of followers. We out here exploring, learning, and slowly growing. AND THAT IS COMPLETELY OKAY! I’m someone who was so focused on follower count a while ago just because sooo many LinkedIn creators were shoving it on our faces. But it doesn’t matter. Slow growth is still growth. Keep exploring. Keep learning. Thanks for coming to my TED talk! 💛\n\nAre you using social media properly or you're just scrolling mindlessly? You know it’s not bringing you any good, but you still spend your precious time here. I used to do the same for the last 8 years. Not learning anything new. Not doing something productive. Just aimless scrolling throughout the day. But things have changed since I used this hack. Now I mostly learn from social media. And help others learn as well. How? By engaging with other’s content. A simple explanation for this would be- When you just read something, you retain 10% of its knowledge. But when you read, demonstrate, and discuss, you retain 75% of the knowledge. The easiest way to do this is by commenting. - on what you’ve learned - on your perspective - on your knowledge It not only helps you gain knowledge but also helps others learn as well. Whatever your thought is, just go ahead and comment. Your words have the power to help someone be better. P.S. How do you use LinkedIn for your growth?\n\nMy favorite Ad Caption formula to use is 👇🏻 I went from ___ to ____ But I didn't do this by ❌(Thing people hate doing) ❌(Thing people hate doing) ❌(Thing people hate doing) Instead I: ✅ (Thing people want to do) ✅ (Thing people want to do) ✅ (Thing people want to do) This is how I went on to _____ (result you achieved and people want) Grab my ____ for the strategy Here's an example: I went from 200 Instagram followers to 57,000 Instagram followers. But I didn't do this by: ❌Spending hours writing posts ❌Leaving comments on other people's post for engagement ❌Dming people for days Instead I ✅ Focused on valuable content ✅ Focused on quality over quantity ✅ Built authentic connections This is how I went on to build my business and finally see the results I desired! Be sure to grab my Instagram growth guide to get the full strategy that took me from 200 to 57,000 followers!\n\nI often get asked, “How many people actually see your posts?” Well, the wait is over! As we bid farewell to 2023, I thought it'd be fun to pull back the curtain and share some numbers with you all. 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐀𝐫𝐞 𝐚 𝐅𝐞𝐰 𝐅𝐮𝐧 𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐬: • Total Profile Views: 88,972 • 36.1% of new followers are Senior level (top spot) and 5.5% are CXO • 1.8% of new followers were from Microsoft (top spot) • 48 inappropriate comments deleted • 14 post deletions for mistakes in images (all reposted later that same day) • 99.9% of posts were edited after being posted • 81.3% of posts were new content • 74.9% Original graphics and 81.9% original commentary 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐃𝐢𝐝 𝐈 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟑? • 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐊𝐞𝐲: The more I interacted with comments on my posts and other strategic posts – the more my network and engagement grew. • 𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐉𝐨𝐛 𝐢𝐬 𝐊𝐞𝐲: Most of my content was originally for internal or external presentations, which I shared on LinkedIn. Only a portion of posts were designed specifically for LinkedIn. This allowed me to produce more content of higher quality. • 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐤 𝐚 𝐋𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐥𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐲: Expressing your opinion for or against something along with justification or alternatives is what people most want to read about. • 𝐏𝐮𝐭 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐬: Putting links to sources directly in the post don’t penalize your post performance A massive thank you to each one of you for being a part of my 2023 journey. Here's to making 2024 even more impactful! What about you? How did your 2023 LinkedIn journey go? Let’s make the comment section below a celebration of our collective growth! ********************************************* • Follow hashtag #JeffWinterInsights to stay current on Industry 4.0 and other cool tech trends • Ring the 🔔 for notifications!\n\nWe already know that negative news and content gets more engagement. It's easy to get sucked in and suddenly our feeds are flooded with similar content 🫣. While we can't totally eliminate these posts, we can manipulate the algorithm a bit so we start seeing more positive messages, inspiring stories, or whatever you want! 🍯 Here are a few things you can do to make the scroll work for you: 01. Actively search for the content or pages you would like to see more content from and follow, like, comment, and/or save their posts. 02. Unfollow or hide anything that's giving you a cortisol spike. 03. Show some extra love to the content you like and want to see more of! A like helps and a comment or share is even better 💛 Spreading the message of #ConsciousEngagement for a sweeter social 🍯\n\nHave you made a post on Linkdein this morning? Or on your main social media marketing platform Do you even plan to make a post today? If your answer is NO, then you are the one doing yourself Let me tell you, I got my first client from posting on Facebook The content was even rubbish if I look at it from my perspective today I got my now business partner from posting and positioning myself on Linkdein Posting is not for fun, it’s part of the activities of marketing, Marketing is part of the activity of making money Without marketing yourself, nobody will know you And if nobody knows you, then nobody will buy from you Connect with you, invest in you, marry you lol, etc You have to get known, not by everyone But by the right people, the people that will help you get to your desired destination in life. Get known brothers and sisters, get known And if you don’t have the mental capacity or discipline to push yourself, then join our skill, career, and business growth community where we strive toward growth Click the link below to join https://lnkd.in/dk6dcGY2\n\nI was consistent on LinkedIn for 5 months & here's what happened: 🌼 1 post went trending & gained 500 followers in 3 days 🌼 has max. 120k+ impressions on my profile 🌼 earned 400 followers in 24 hours from the recent post 🌼 impressions shot from 20k to 43k 🌼 posts crossed 8k engagements in less than 24 hours 🌼 earned a linkedIn top voice badge in less than 6 months!! (I'm screaming at this one!!) but on the other side; 🌸 was completely clueless & confused about LinkedIn 🌸 my growth was stagnant for 3 weeks in a row in nov 🌸 worked for 3-4 hours for posts which wouldn't even reach 2k impressions 🌸 lost interest in LinkedIn 🌸 took 4 months to reach 1,000 followers 🌸 took 4 months to reach my 1st 10,000 impressions 🌸 ran out of ideas easily 🌸 couldn't make time due to academics I'm grateful to everyone :) Wasn't expecting this early but; Consistency is the key 🌟 The earlier you gain things, the earlier you may lose them too, what stays is the impact that you make. That's what matters. Thus, I hope my posts provide you value & help you learn. Improvement doesn't stop 🌟 Thank you so muchhh :)))\n\n𝙒𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙚 𝙄𝙨 𝙔𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙩 𝙈𝙞𝙣𝙙𝙨𝙚𝙩? When Facebook went down did your heart sink or do you have your eggs in other baskets. The mindset of someone new is to master 1 then move on. It’s something a lot of the coaches and mentors out there suggest. However as we all witnessed the other day any 1 of these social media platforms can disappear in an instant. 𝘿𝙤 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙝𝙖𝙫𝙚 𝙖 𝙡𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙩𝙚𝙙 𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙙𝙨𝙚𝙩 𝙤𝙧 𝙖 𝙜𝙧𝙤𝙬𝙩𝙝 𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙙𝙨𝙚𝙩? Limited will keep you on 1 social media platform for a number of reasons. “Don’t have time to do more” “Don’t know how to use the others” “you want to master the social your on” (impossible by the way the algorithms change all the time on all if them) If your writing content you can use the same content to add else where and the same goes for video. Quick Tip insta are letting you upload 3 min videos now. Moral of the story is dont put all your eggs in 1 basket."
