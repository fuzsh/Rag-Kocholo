        "text": "A native of Houston raised on Lookout Mountain outside of Golden, Colorado, Greg Germann was exposed to the performing arts at an early age, particularly through his father, an award-winning children's playwright and theater professor. As a Theater major at the University of Northern Colorado, a constant stream of plays led him to the gradual realization that acting would be his professional future. Buckling down at UNC, he graduated in two years and moved to New York. He became a member of Circle Repertory Company and Ensemble Studio Theatre, accumulating credits in such off-Broadway and Broadway plays as Steven Sondheim musical \"Assassins\", \"The Person I Once Was\" opposite Holly Hunter, and David Mamet's \"War Games\", among others. He has distinguished himself on the big screen portraying roles in various films. In addition to acting he also devotes himself to writing. His short film, Pete's Garden (1998), for which he also served as director and star, premiered in competition at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and went on to air on The Sundance Channel in January 1999. He also wrote \"The Observatory\" a play performed at New York's Ensemble Studio Theatre.\n\nBorn in Memphis and raised in Philadelphia, Wendy started making student films in the summer of 1969 and began acting because she wanted to be able to write for and direct other actors. She discovered a love of acting that became a lifetime commitment, but only turned into a full-time pursuit when Jonathan Demme came to town to follow up his Academy Award with a groundbreaking drama about AIDS starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington.\n\nAlthough she ended up on the cutting room floor of the movie \"Philadelphia,\" the experience gave her a SAG card and convinced her that it was time to leave behind her career as an arts administrator (co-founder of CineKyd, executive director of The Clay Studio, and various managerial jobs at People's Light and Theatre Company) and pursue acting full-time. Two weeks after arriving in Los Angeles, she was cast in a new musical, \"Lulu,\" for which she received a Drama-Logue Award, the first of many awards to come. Within a year, she had landed her first TV job, an appearance on \"Murphy Brown.\"\n\nShe continued to work regularly in TV and in theatre. She helped to found Theatre Neo with Kathryn Joosten, Josh Schiowitz, and others; Theatre Neo evolved into Neo Ensemble Theatre, a membership company that produces monologue festivals and plays in small theatres in the city. She appeared on stage in such plays as \"The Guardsman\" at A Noise Within, \"Man of La Mancha\" with Jason Alexander's now-defunct company Reprise, and the world premiere of Charles Busch's \"Die! Mommy! Die!\" She joined the National Tour of \"Wicked,\" playing Madame Morrible 509 times for more than 1.3 million audience members in 20 cities across the country over 65 weeks, before returning to Los Angeles.\n\nHer television work includes a wide range of roles, from the murderous Lunch Lady on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (which earned her an appearance on her own trading card) to a recurring role as the formidable Margaret Camaro on \"Ally McBeal,\" \"Foodzilla\" on \"Even Stevens,\" and Miss Westmore (\"The Wicked Witch of the Westmore\"), teacher to the Olsen Twins on their last TV series, \"So Little Time.\" She has appeared in many skits on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and returned to the diner on \"Bones\" as a resident waitress five times.\n\nShe also began to make her mark in feature films, including memorable turns as a lascivious casting director in \"LA Twister\" and a menacing nurse facing off against Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich in Clint Eastwood's powerful drama, \"Changeling.\"\n\nWendy is an experienced theatre director (her BA from Temple University, awarded summa cum laude, is in Radio-TV-Film) and a published writer. Her short stories have been included in several anthologies, including \"Death on a Cold Night,\" \"Death and a Cup of Tea,\" \"Thoroughly Modern Monsters,\" and \"Immanence.\"\n\nAnd, although she grew up there, she does not have a Philadelphia accent - but she can do one on request.\n\nAaron was born one minute before his twin, Shawn Ashmore, in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. He is the son of homemaker Linda and manufacturing engineer Rick. When they were 10, their mother was a part of a club called the \"Multiple Births Association,\" or as Aaron likes to call it, \"The Multiple Rugrats.\" The support group, located in Alberta, Canada was where the twins were discovered by a talent agent. It didn't take long for the problem of rejection to arise. The twins started out in commercials, sometimes by themselves and sometimes together. When they were 12, Aaron got an offer to be in a commercial, but he fell ill on that day, and Shawn went in his brother's place. Ever since then, Shawn's career has always been 1 step in front of his brother's. Since high school, when they were routinely mixed up with one another, their talents have become a lot less identical. They have been offered different roles to play, and they are looking a lot less identical, now that they are growing older. Aaron is now more sturdily built, with a broader face and broad shoulders. He stands 6'0\", which is an inch taller than Shawn, who is 5'11\". To that, Shawn says, \"It's shoes and hair\". Aaron lives in Toronto, where he shares an apartment with Shawn.\n\nJason Beghe is an American actor from New York City.
