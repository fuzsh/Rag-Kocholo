        "text": "#21 in my ranking of Best Picture winners at the Oscars.\n\nThe film that George C. Scott won Best Actor for, which he refused because the Oscars are dumb and best ignored. I think I really like George C. Scott. Oh, and he was a very fine actor, bringing complexity, life, and verve to the American general of the Second World War. Working from a script by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North (who didn’t meet until the Oscar ceremony where they both won the award for Best Original Screenplay), director Franklin Schaffner filmed cleanly and intelligently, allowing his actors to inhabit their roles fully while providing a clear visual palate on which the story was to play out. It is something of a triumph of biographical films, war films, and film in general.\n\nThe American entry into WWII has met a surprising early failure at Kasserine where Rommel (Karl Michael Vogler) has demonstrated his ingenious mind for war by beating back the American troops under British General Kenneth Anderson. Eisenhower sends in General George S. Patton (Scott) to lead the counteroffensive, supported by General Omar Bradley (Karl Malden), who quickly finds a rabble instead of an army. The opening half hour is dominated by a certain quietude as Patton walks into this situation that he’s expected to turn around while demonstrating his complex relationship with his troops. He expects a lot of his men. They are to be soldiers, the best of soldiers, and if the mess is open at six in the morning for breakfast, they have fifteen minutes to show up, not two hours. They have a uniform that they are expected to respect and keep pristine at all times. His view of his own men is contrasted by Patton’s first dramatic scene where he watches Moroccan troops on parade, decked out in their best uniforms, and he salutes them with a snap and respect that he does not share for the men under his command when he arrives in Tunisia.\n\nOne of the more interesting little vignettes we get across the film revolves around a young German Captain Steiger (Siegfried Rauch), a military researcher assigned Patton and reporting to Colonel General Jodl (Richard Munch). From a strictly plot-focused point of view, every single one of these little scenes could be cut. They function more like a chorus than an element of drama, but I think they do some really interesting things. Mostly, they’re about framing Patton in ways that we see ourselves such as Steiger’s description of Patton as a fifteenth century man who believes in reincarnation when we get a scene of Patton at Carthage, talking about how he was literally there at the battle with Rome. It’s this framing device that helps give Patton this mythic quality through the eyes of his enemy.\n\nAnother thing to note about the screenplay is the plethora of details. The Blu-ray starts with a short interview with Coppola who talks about how the early draft her wrote was informed by a host of reading on his part. Coppola is a very intelligent filmmaker who understands dramatic structure really well, and it’s great that he didn’t fall into the trap of needing to dramatize everything in a full life. The dramatic focus is on the African campaign followed by Patton’s involvement in the Allied movements in Western Europe after D-Day, but we get small details about uniforms he designed for tank crews years before (only described), an event when he thought he saved a woman from a handful of male kidnappers in New York, and even a mention towards his status as an Olympic athlete. Coppola didn’t write scenes that dramatized these moments in a full life. He and North just included dialogue to bring those details in, filling out the edges of the character in small ways that add up to create this fuller portrait of a complex, full-lived man.\n\nThe actual dramatic arc of the film is around Patton’s rise, fall, and rise again within the political machine that was the US Army during the fighting years of WWII. His successes in Africa only mean so much when British General Montgomery (Michael Bates) has better political connections and gets his plan for the invasion of Sicily approved, putting Patton firmly in a support position when Patton’s plan would have made it a race to Messina. Patton, following orders, does what he’s told until Montgomery’s plan bogs down enough where he cannot take it anymore, and he strikes out on his own, ignoring orders, and taking Palermo on the north-western coast of Sicily before marching towards Messina, beating Montgomery and embarrassing him. Was Patton looking for just victory for the army, or was he looking for personal glory? Is there a difference at a certain point? If Patton himself can deliver victory, is that not success for the army?\n\nHis greatest downfall, though, happens at that intersection of deep love for his troops and deep hatred of cowards. One of his first orders when taking over the US II Corps was to move troops with self-inflicted wounds out of the infirmary with those who were wounded in battle. In Sicily, Patton slaps a soldier with shell-shock, word getting to Eisenhower which leads to apologies and an excuse for Eisenhower to sideline Patton. One of the most amusing little bits is Jodl brushing off Steiger about the news because there was no way that the Allies would sideline their greatest commander for just slapping a soldier.\n\nThe culmination of his career happens at the Battle of the Bulge when Patton needs to disengage one fight, march his army one hundred miles, and save the encircled 101st Airborne at Bastogne. Involving a winter prayer and the fulfilment of his troops’ training under Patton’s command, it’s a great success only limited by political considerations. The concerns of war, including Patton’s rightful regard of the Soviet Union as America’s next enemy, are pushed aside so that Eisenhower’s command of the entire Allied forces supersede everything else, including slowing Patton down on his way to Berlin.\n\nThe portrait of Patton, really well written by Coppola and North, is the foundation on which Scott operates, and Scott, one of America’s greatest actors, brings everything he can to the role. His kiss of a soldier dying by a tank, his hatred of cowards including the slap, his inability to play the political game as effectively as his rivals, and his self-assuredness regarding military matters, while also having a deep understanding of military and world history all combines together in Scott to create this immensely intricate look at a complex man. It goes as far as a three-hour film tied to military movements in a pair of grand campaigns can go. It’s a wildly compelling effort look at a complex man.\n\nSchaffner films cleanly and clearly (though it’s easy to see how Fred Koenekamp would lose to Freddie Young for Young’s work on David Lean’s Ryan’s Daughter for Best Cinematography), providing us the kind of deep focus work that keeps several subjects in frame, allowing a space for the actors to play their parts with minimal intrusion from the camera. It’s a professional job from the director, intelligently filming a smart script with a great central performance.\n\nPatton is just great, classical filmmaking.\n\nRating: 4/4"
