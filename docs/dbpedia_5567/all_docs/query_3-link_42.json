        "text": "Patton\n\nIn 1970, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences selected Franklin Schaffner’s larger-than-life war biopic, Patton, as the year’s Best Picture. The Academy also selected the film for six other awards including Best Actor, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and Best Art Direction making it one of the most decorated war films of all time. It was released at the height of the opposition to the Vietnam War (one month prior to the Kent State riots) which made it a polarizing film because of its focus on war and because its protagonist, American General George S. Patton, Jr. (played by George C. Scott), was also a polarizing character. This film is unique in the genre of War Films because it presents the film to the viewer as a character study and not really as an action film.\n\nThe Plot\n\nAfter that bombastic introduction from General Patton, the film starts with an observation of a quiet battlefield with bodies of fallen servicemen strewn across it. Driving up to the field is then Major General Omar Bradley (played by Karl Malden). He looks over in sadness and disgust at what we know today as the Battle of Kasserine Pass¹. Upon getting back to the area’s command post, Bradley determines that the United States needs “the best tank man we’ve got” to go up against the German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, who was the victor at Kasserine. This of course alludes to Patton, who has been in nearby Morocco. Patton enters the command post and begins to take charge and instill a discipline that he said had been lacking. This puts him on a collision course with Rommel. The showdown happens at a place called El Guettar where Patton wins handily. Patton’s next strategic objective is the Allied liberation of the Italian island of Sicily. Sicily, and thereby Italy, was looked at by the Allies as the gateway into southern Europe.\n\nIn Germany, a meeting in the German High Command is being led by Colonel General Alfred Jodl, Hitler’s Chief of Staff. He proceeds to ask Captain Steiger, an officer working for him, where Patton will attack next. The officer replies that instead of through Sardinia (like Jodl thought), that Patton would attack through Sicily because, since Patton was a military historian, he would attack through Sicily the way the Athenians did. Jodl chastised him by saying this is the 20th century. Steiger, who had previously been tasked by Jodl to study Patton, persists and says that Patton is not of this century and cites some anecdotes to back up his case. Jodl is ultimately dismissive of Steiger.\n\nBack in Algeria, Patton requests a formal dinner party in order to host British General Harold Alexander in attempt to sell Patton’s plans for the invasion of Sicily. Patton lays out a plan that would utilize his American forces to cut off a German retreat into Italy. After a conciliatory dinner, it seems that Alexander and Patton are on the same page. Elsewhere in Algeria and later on, British Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery is going into the Allied headquarters to talk to American Major General Walter “Beetle” Smith, who is the Chief of Staff to General Eisenhower, about his own plan for the invasion of Sicily. Montgomery’s plan is a direct assault at the Germans up the east side of the island with Patton’s forces protecting the British left flank. When it is revealed to Patton that Eisenhower is going to go with Montgomery’s plan, Patton is less than thrilled as it meant his forces would be landing on an empty beach and not in the fighting.\n\nThe beach landing occurs without incident for Patton but the remainder of the liberation of Sicily becomes a rivalry between himself and Montgomery. With Montgomery’s forces meeting heavy resistance as they move up the east coast, Patton takes his forces to the northwest. Patton’s intent is to go through the central part of the island in attempt to reach the northern coast to the city of Palermo where he would then turn east and drive to Messina to cut off the German escape route. His plan here is a modified version of the plan he laid out to General Alexander. Patton meets significant opposition to his plan from General Bradley and some of his other generals. Unwavering, Patton continues to move his forces east to Messina in a race against Montgomery. Even as his American columns meet heavier and heavier resistance, Patton continues to lead. In one instance an entire convoy has been stopped at a bridge crossing and furious that the convoy is stopped, Patton, in his command car, and being strafed by German aircraft, rushes to the bridge to find it blocked by a farmer’s cart being pulled by two mules that have stopped unexplainably. Beside himself, Patton admonishes the soldiers trying to move the mules by saying, “You let a whole column get stalled and strafed on account of a couple of jackasses?! What the hell’s the matter with you?!” So he brandishes his ivory handled and nickel plated revolver and shoots the mules dead and orders them thrown over the side and to have the bridge cleared. As his column continues its march, one soldier comments as Patton drives by, “There he goes, Old Blood and Guts” and another right behind him says, “Yeah, our blood, his guts”.\n\nWith his dash to Messina back underway, Patton takes time to stop at field hospital and pay his respects to those who have been wounded under his command. After giving a Purple Heart to a soldier who had his head encased in bandages and was unresponsive, Patton happens across a soldier who does not seem to have any visible injuries. The General inquires as to what is ailing the soldier. The soldier answers by saying, “I guess I just can’t take it sir.” Now Patton had made it quite clear to a field hospital doctor back in North Africa that, “There will be no battle fatigue in my command. That’s an order”, so he was less than pleased to see this soldier and told the hospital’s doctor that he did not want this soldier “stinking up this place of honor”. Unmoved by the soldier’s sobs, Patton slaps him yelling at him to, “Shut up!” He loudly orders the soldier back to the front and even threatens to shoot him as the doctors usher the soldier out. A clearly flustered Patton then storms out of the tent and back to the front.\n\nIn Messina, with bagpipes blaring, Montgomery and his soldiers are making a triumphant entrance into the city. The column makes a sudden stop, forcing ‘Monty’ out of his command car and to the front of the convoy. Standing in front of him, is the city’s square, is General Patton with several tanks, artillery weapons, and soldiers standing ceremoniously around him. Patton had raced him to Messina and won. Montgomery, clearly soured, takes his column on through the city.\n\nShortly after, in a lavish room, Patton summons General Bradley and hands him a letter sent to Patton from General Eisenhower. In the letter, ‘Ike’ calls Patton’s conduct and deviation from the Sicilian plan ‘despicable’. General Patton is beside himself as he has never been called that before. He profanely laments a newspaper with a comic depicting him kicking a soldier with a swastika on his boot. As Patton reads on in the letter, he tells Bradley that Eisenhower has instructed him to apologize to the soldier he slapped, everyone in the field hospital that day, and everyone under his command. He then does so in a long and clearly uncomfortable way. Patton tells his soldiers that he slapped the soldier in an attempt to help the fatigued individual regain his sense as a man and as a soldier.\n\nGeneral Patton finds out not long after that he has been relieved of his post as Commanding Officer of Seventh Army. He then learns that not only has he been relieved, but that General Bradley will be commanding the eventual Allied assault of Western Europe. Dejected, Patton tells his aide, “I wish I’d kissed the son-of-a-bitch”, referring to the soldier he slapped.\n\nAfter the intermission, General Patton is in Corsica and then Malta. It is insinuated that he is essentially being used as a decoy to throw the Germans off which clearly works as General Jodl and Captain Steiger look over a map of Malta. Steiger tells Jodl that Patton is actually under a large amount of criticism because he slapped an enlisted man, implying that Patton may be getting reprimanded and pulled from front line duty. Jodl chuckles and rebukes him saying, “Would they sacrifice their best commander because he slapped a soldier?”\n\nPatton is recalled to England and is immediately met by General ‘Beetle’ Smith. Smith says Ike has an important assignment for him in regards to the Normandy invasion. Before Smith can finish his thought, Patton interrupts by saying that he has studied the invasion plans and has noted a number of flaws. A frustrated Smith cuts Patton off and proceeds to tell him that the Allies will be building a fictitious army around Patton so that the Germans will think the landing is happening in a location other than Normandy. Patton asks Smith what he is supposed to do when he reaches this fictitious command post to which Smith replies, “Nothing. Absolutely nothing.” Smith goes on to tell Patton that he is essentially on probation per Eisenhower and that “…your worst enemy is your own big mouth.”\n\nIn his new location, Patton is talking to a gathering of English citizens when he says that “…since it is the evident destiny of the British and Americans to rule the world, the better we know each other, the better we will do it.” This results in another meeting with General Smith as Patton is sternly reminded that the Russians were Allies as well. Patton tells Smith that he has no political ambitions after the war and that all he wants to do is command an army in combat. Smith tells him Eisenhower has referred it to the Army’s Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall. Patton states at least Marshall is a fair man and storms out. On his way out in the hallway, Patton meets his aide and says “…our war is over”. Patton laments that it is only a matter of time until he gets his orders to return to the states. He goes on to say that he feels he is “…destined to achieve some great thing” and that God would not permit him to be left out of the “…last great opportunity of a lifetime”. Yelling now, he says, “I am going to be allowed to fulfill my destiny!”\n\nAfter the D-Day invasion, Patton, who obviously was not recalled stateside, is on an airplane into Normandy as he has been summoned by General Bradley. Patton arrives to Bradley’s command post and is walking in as Field Marshal Montgomery is walking out. Montgomery tells Patton that he hasn’t seen him since Messina and that his British forces will be taking on German Field Marshal Rommel again. Undoubtedly annoyed Patton goes in to see Bradley. Patton is so overjoyed to be back in a forward area, he can hardly contain himself. Bradley tells him that Eisenhower wanted them to talk. Bradley explains to Patton that they are activating the American Third Army. Patton wants to know if the command will be his but Bradley begins to lay out several concerns. He tells Patton that “…we’re different kinds of people” to which Patton heartily tells Bradley that he is right and that is why they made such a great team in Sicily. Bradley then sternly tells Patton that had he been his superior, he would have relieved Patton during the Sicily operation. This humbles Patton who proceeds to proceeds to plead with Bradley to get him “…back in the war”. Bradley explains an operation designed to help the Allies break out of their stagnated positions and tells Patton that Eisenhower decided two months prior to put Patton in charge.\n\nBack in Germany, Jodl, Rommel, and Steiger are standing around a large map. Jodl is describing an Allied armored incursion into southern France from Normandy. Steiger says that sounds like Patton. Jodl refutes him by saying that Patton is still in England preparing an invasion and that the existing Normandy invasion is a diversion. Rommel asks Jodl why he is articulating a logic that is nonsense to which Jodl replies “Because I am not prepared to dispute the Fuhrer.”\n\nGeneral Patton, now at the helm of Third Army, begins his drive through France. He exceeds expectations and is eventually told by Bradley that he needs to slow down and that some of his fuel needs to be diverted. Patton says he thinks he smells Montgomery. Bradley firmly tells him that the war has other priorities. Later on Patton’s armored forces run out of gas and are subsequently attacked by German tanks. Patton visits the battlefield, lamenting the reality of the situation.\n\nLater on, Patton gets a call from General Bradley. Bradley wants some of his units transferred to which Patton balks. Bradley goes on to tell him that there is a lot of enemy activity near the Ardennes Forest and that he does not know how serious it is. In a conference with his own officers, Patton says that there is no reason to assume the Germans are launching a counter-attack due to the weather, their supply situation, and the fact that they had not mounted a winter offensive in 200 years. He goes on to say he thinks that is exactly what they are going to do and instructs his staff to begin crafting contingency plans to pull out of their current engagements so that they can move 100 miles north to the Ardennes to engage the Germans.\n\nAt a meeting of Allied commanders shortly after, General ‘Beetle’ Smith is laying out a dire scenario for the American 101st Airborne who have been surrounded by the German counter-attack. He tells the group that Eisenhower wants to see if someone can get in there to relieve them. Field Marshal Montgomery’s representative says there is nothing the British forces can do for weeks. Smith asks Patton what he can do to which Patton replies “I can attack with three divisions in 48 hours.” The whole group thinks this is preposterous. Patton assures them that his staff already has the details worked out. A skeptical Smith isn’t so sure. Montgomery’s representatives, also skeptical, question how Patton and his men could do this. Patton again assures them that his men are well trained and will do what Patton tells them to do.\n\nGeneral Patton and his forces begin the drive north to liberate the 101st. The trip is arduous and the winter weather is not cooperating so Patton requests an Army Chaplain to write a “weather prayer” in order to get some good weather and thereby some Allied air power. The Chaplain says he isn’t sure how well this prayer will be received as they are “Praying for good weather so we can kill our fellow man”. Patton assures the Chaplain that due to the General’s intimate relations with the Almighty, if the Chaplain writes a good prayer, they’ll have good weather. So the Chaplain writes it, Patton prays for it, and, low and behold, the weather breaks allowing the Third Army to roll in an relieve the 101st Airborne. A newsreel describes General Patton and the Third Army by saying, “During this operation Third Army moved farther and faster, and engaged more divisions in less time than any other army in the history of the United States.”\n\nGerman Captain Steiger and General Jodl are in a bunker with bombs audibly dropping in the background. Jodl is barking at Steiger to ensure that every sensitive piece of material is burned or destroyed. Steiger stares at a picture of Patton and states that “He, too, will be destroyed. The absence of war will kill him. The pure warrior…a magnificent anachronism…” He then places the picture into a barrel that is aflame due to the burning of documents.\n\nGeneral Patton is then at a ceremonial Russian dinner where he seems less than amused. He later on is talking to a group of reporters where he, as always, sticks his foot in his mouth again. But with the war coming to an end, General Smith calls Patton and tells him that Eisenhower has had enough. The movie ends with Field Marshal Montgomery being Knighted and Patton walking off into a German landscape with his voice-over saying “All glory is fleeting”.\n\nAn Analysis\n\nThis film is so unique in that it illustrates the challenges and horrors of war but does so through the eyes of a General. The film paints General Patton as vain, blood-thirsty, tyrannical, swaggering, & zealous. All are traits that could be considered reprehensible for a General. The film also portrays him as disciplined, funny, and religious, as well as being a tremendous strategist, a brilliant tactician, and an incredible leader of men. Those are all traits that are invaluable to a commanding officer.\n\nThis 1970 film is a gateway between the patriotic films of the preceding 30 years and the war films that offered critiques of combat and soldiers that came during the 20 years after Patton. It presents to the viewer the dichotomy that always occurs in war between the good and the bad but it does so through the main character, General Patton instead of through the conflict itself.\n\nAn interesting point is that there were only three characters that represented the Germans. General Jodl, Field Marshal Rommel, and Captain Steiger all embodied the ‘enemy’ and the film assigned to them a deep reverence for General Patton. They were all convinced that wherever Patton went, that is where they should expect the Allies to attack from.\n\nThe depictions of General Bradley and Patton were supposed to illustrate an obvious contrast in command styles and command effectiveness.\n\nAs a winner of seven Academy Awards, Patton should have a place on the podium as an elite place holder in the war film genre. It should be a testament to the types of individuals who show up to lead when war breaks out….and the type of individual needed to win that war."
