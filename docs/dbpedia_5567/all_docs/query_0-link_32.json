        "text": "YOU KNOW THEM. The minute they show up on screen you recognize their faces, those wonderfully expressive yet Everyman faces that make such an indelible imprint on the celluloid landscape. You can't recall their names, but you're positive you've seen them before -- and you probably have.\n\nThe actor who played the bullying Marine sergeant in ''Full Metal Jacket'' -- wasn't he the same one who played the outraged father in ''Dead Man Walking'' and the married conventioneer who rebuffs Elisabeth Shue in ''Leaving Las Vegas''?\n\nAnd didn't the actor who depicted Alicia Silverstone's gruff but doting dad in ''Clueless'' also turn up as a harried detective in ''The Usual Suspects'' and as Bette Midler's bimbo-besotted ex-husband in ''The First Wives Club''?\n\nR. Lee Ermey and Dan Hedaya may not have their names above the title -- how many moviegoers even know their names? -- and their faces haven't decorated the cover of Vanity Fair magazine, but as two of Hollywood's busiest character actors, they are the nuts and bolts that anchor a film.\n\nAlong with colleagues like J. T. Walsh, M. Emmet Walsh, Joe Pantoliano, Glenn Plummer, Roma Maffia, Max Perlich, William Forsythe, Lois Smith and Will Patton, they constitute a pantheon of gloriously idiosyncratic characters whom fans remember even while the actors' names elude them.\n\n''I'm the guy who kissed the girl who kissed the guy who kissed the horse,'' said M. Emmet Walsh, 61, who has appeared in 84 feature films, most recently as the discredited psychiatrist testifying for the defense in ''A Time to Kill.'' ''But when I walk on screen, no one washes me out. I have presence. If I'm working with Mr. Hackman or Newman or Redford, it becomes a tennis match between us.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
