        "text": "Remember the Titans debuted in September 2000, and soon became a favorite for its powerful story line — and introducing many viewers to a young Ryan Gosling.\n\nThe movie is based on a true story, following Black football coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) as he attempts to integrate a high school in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1971. Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is moved to assistant coach, as star players Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) are put in place to run the team.\n\nThe inspirational tale also jump-started the career of many of its young actors, including Gosling, Donald Faison, Kate Bosworth and Hayden Panettiere.\n\n“You want to do movies that teach youth, society and people about how other people feel and the right way to treat each other,” Faison exclusively told Us Weekly in 2017. “You want to do projects that have topics like that.”\n\nFaison noted that the serious topic was just part of the equation on set, revealing the cast also became a “tight group” after football camp. “It made us very much like a team,” he added.\n\nScroll through the gallery below to see where the cast is today:"
