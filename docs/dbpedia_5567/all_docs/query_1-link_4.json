        "text": "General George S. Patton was born on November 11, 1885 in San Gabriel, California. One of his early career goals was to become a war hero. This was heavily influenced by his ancestors’ roles in the Revolutionary War and Civil War. To pursue this goal, Patton enrolled in the Virginia Military Institute in 1904. Just over a year later, he was accepted into the military academy at West Point and graduated on June 11, 1909. While he was at West Point, Patton fell in love with a woman named Beatrice Ayer and they got married in 1910. Two years later, Patton competed in the first modern Pentathlon at the Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. He did rather well and got fifth place. After the Olympics, he taught swordsmanship at the Mounted Service School\n\nFrank’s career continued after the war and he went on to do several more memorable films including a popular feature film titled “It’s a Wonderful Life”. However, even with all his Hollywood success, Frank regards the “Why We Fight” series as his most important works. He ended his time in the military as a colonel and received the Legion of Merit and Distinguished Service Medal. And now, he is honored as a Distinguished Member of the Regiment at the Signal Corps Ball.\n\nAmericans despise cowards. Americans play to win all of the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have never lost nor will ever lose a war; Ffor the very idea of losing is hateful to an American(paragraph #).” This section of the speechquote exemplifies that Patton is using American appeals to conjure up motivation into the troops because so they can feel more encouraged and willing to fight and possibly die by the fact that all Americans are winners and hate to lose. All Americans are the best and real men who like to fight, Patton does this to make the troops want to win. He makes them feel like it’s in their identity and blood to win, he wants them to have the courage and perseverance to win. Also Patton later conjures the image of the comic book superman, He Man, to encourage all men to tap into their own super powers. on says “ Americans pride themselves on being He Men and they ARE He Men. He validates their own superiority by stating, “Remember that the enemy is just as frightened as you are, and probably more so. They are not supermen.” Patton says this to further explain that Americans are winners and they will win this war. Patton is trying to inspire these soldiers by also lowering their reputation of the enemy saying\n\nIn Virginia, George oversaw the horse procurement for the whole Army. World War I started and John Pershing was assigned as commander of the American Expeditionary Force. Since George had worked with John before and they got along and were very good partners, George requested to join his staff. On May 15, 1917, George was assigned captain and left out for Europe. George Patton was with one hundred and eighty more men. George was dissatisfied with the headquarters company and took interest in tanks. On November 10, 1917, George Patton was chosen to establish the AEF Light Tank School. After a few weeks of training they were given ten tanks. George was now the only one with personal experience with driving tanks, so he backed seven of them off the train. George was later assigned to the United States 1st Provisional Tank Brigade, in August 1918. During World War I, if there was an objective to be reached that involved driving tanks, George was probably there. Sadly, at the end of the war, George was shot in the leg and injured. He was awarded the Purple Heart for his wounds and dedication throughout the war. George was always doing something during World War I, but he was always changing\n\nPatton wrote a very particular chapter in his book about his “Reflections and Suggestions” mainly talking about the soldiers and his advice about war. There is one quote that he starts off with at the beginning and it pretty much explains everything he’s going to say in this Chapter “What appears to me as the original thought may be simply subconscious memories”(Patton 335). He’s going off by what he remembers the best because the war itself has affected him and plus when he wrote this book he was a little older, so possibly his age was getting to him. The hard part Patton had with new soldiers is them being fresh and inexperienced, he kind of quoted this as “When he joins a unit and lacks this corrective influence, he is apt to slip in morals, in neatness, and in energy”(Patton 336). Basically, stating new soldiers could lead to more casualties and thus then affecting moral for all other soldiers. Patton explains more about moral later, but for now, the main part to focus on is the soldiers and how inexperienced they were at the time. But when you start to think about it, at that time in the 1940s there were even teenagers signing up for war lying about their age to get in some being sixteen – seventeen at the\n\nEvery war will have those who support the war and those who are against the war. In 1965, those who were against the Vietnam War made their views known by many forms of protesting such as forming organizations, rallying, and anti-war protest music. Anti-war protest music was an opportunity to put people’s perspectives into song to hopefully spread their message. Buffy Sainte-Marie wrote the song “Universal Soldier” in 1962 and her message was that “Universal Soldier is about individual responsibility for war and how the old feudal thinking kills us all” (Boulanger). The song “Universal Soldier” was used as a protest anthem during the Vietnam War and attempts to untangle one of the paradoxes of life that war never leads to peace through\n\nGeneral George S. Patton liked fame and winning, the advance towards Palermo, Sicily, was a race that Patton won for the U.S (Murray 63). Patton was born on November 11, 1885 in San Gabriel, California. Patton always wanted to be a soldier, so in 1905 he enrolled into the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and graduated in 1909. And in 1910 he married Beatrice Ayer who had been a childhood friend. As a strict general in World War II George Patton’s personality made him a better leader, respected by his soldiers, and honored to this day for his war tactics.\n\nI 'm writing about four films, Platoon by Oliver Stone, Drone by Robert Glickert, Donnie Darko by Richard Kelly, and finally Saving Private Ryan by Steven Spielberg. These four films all fit into the theme, which is the blurring of morality. This theme relates to these movies though revenge, drug use, and questionable orders made by people in command. I will first be discussing how revenge fits into the theme. I have purposely chosen to talk about revenge first because I believe that more can be learnt from drug use or questionable orders. After discussing revenge I will then talk about drug use and finally discuss how questionable orders fits into the theme. I believe that we can learn the most from questionable orders, making it the most important.\n\nAndrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan also contributed to the writing of the movie. The film covers military, drama, romance, and also gives a biography feel. The movie is based on real characters, and some of the events took place during the Battle of Hacksaw Ridge, in the Japanese island of Okinawa during the World War II. The main character, Desmond Doss (Actor Andrew Garfield), was a member of the medical unit in the US Army, who refused to carry a weapon and engage in fighting for religious reasons and moral principles. He was granted the Medal of Honor from president Harry S. Truman as recognition for saving 75 Americans soldiers under fire launch of the enemy side. He became the first US military who refused to carry a weapon for religious and ethical reasons and first to receive a medal for it in the history of the United\n\nAfter nearly fifteen years of troops committed to the conflict beginning in 1959 and withdrawal in 1975, a number of films were made about Vietnam (Goldfield, 2014). The Green Berets, the sole movie produced during the conflict, featured an image presented by John Wayne consistent with the heroic battles in Europe during World War II. Filmmakers emerged in greater numbers in the late 1970s and 1980s after considering that rather than focusing on the perception of losing the war, there were more important stories to tell about the conflict. Some of the notorious films about the Vietnam War are Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, We Were Soldiers, Rambo, Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, and Hamburger Hill. Vast differences between how and why the films were made and the background and inspiration for the directors who made the film were apparent. Within each director lay a unique interpretation of the conflict based on personal experience (Toplin, 1991). There were some films that attempted to counter the feeling that the U.S. had lost the war and explored a hypothetical favorable American outcome in unifying North and South Vietnam under democracy (Siskel, 1985). Movies like Full Metal Jacket explored new concepts such as how the press’ presence in Vietnam influenced public support for the war. Many of these films were popular because of their violent imagery. Scenes depicting\n\nThe film I will be discussing is Saving Private Ryan, which gives viewers a first had experience on what it’s like to be in a war zone. Saving Private Ryan is an amazing fictional action/drama surrounding the Invasion of Normandy during World War II. It originally debuted on July 24th 1998 starring Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, and directed by Steven Spielberg. The movie is primarily led by Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks), a commander in the 2nd Ranger Battalion. About 30 minutes into the movie Gen George Marshall discovered that three soldiers who happened to be brothers had been killed in action, and that they had one more brother that was still alive.\n\nThe Vietnam War was a nightmare for many soldiers. It re-defined the meaning of war to an entire generation. As the conflict grew it became known around the world that this was a war that could not be won. After this was realized by America the main focus became to \"get out\" instead of \"getting a victory\". In the 2002 film We Were Soldiers, directed by Randall Wallace, a true account of the first major battle in Vietnam is given. At the beginning of the film he introduces to us many of the soldiers and their families. This is a very smart technique, because it ensures that the audience not only will care about each one, but also tell them apart. Wallace exemplifies\n\nWhen the group climbed into the limo, Jackson looked at the others and could see the emotions on everyone’s face, including Chris who was facing his own demons from the past. They rode on in silence to Arlington National Cemetery and their first stop at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier where they observed the traditional changing of the guard ceremony and returned to the limo. Since Jackie wanted to see the grave of President John F. Kennedy, they made a stop at the eternal flame at her insistence. Jackson admired President Kennedy; he’d given the Special Forces the right to wear their distinctive headwear and was a big proponent of the US Army Special Forces, which is why their special warfare school was named after him."
