        "text": "REGEN KAKUTANI By MICHIKO KAKUTANI\n\nThe theater has always been a whimsical business, and in no respect do things seem more whimsical than in casting. Why, for instance, is Richard Burton turning his back on King Lear, a role he's always wanted to play, just to tour the provinces in ''Camelot,'' a show he did 20 years ago? What gave Mary Tyler Moore, a Broadway veteran of one show, the prescience to replace Tom Conti in ''Whose Life Is It Anyway?'' after Jon Voight, Jim Dale, Anthony Hopkins, Dustin Hoffman, Richard Dreyfuss, Meryl Streep and Marsha Mason refused? How was it that three of the theater's leading actors - Julie Harris, Geraldine Page and Rip Torn - ended up receiving worse than mixed reviews in ''Mixed Couples''? And what was it about the part of Dr. August Browning, an East Side psychiatrist, that made George C. Scott accept the lead in ''Tricks of the Trade'' - a show that closed on opening night? In short, just why do actors choose the roles they do?\n\nMost actors, of course, don't have much to chose from. Work is scarce, and a job, any job, represents a chance to gain experience and expertise. As for those few who are in demand, the question is somewhat trickier. The merits of the role and the play, the choice of director and cast, advice from agents and offers of money, as well as such incalculables as timing and family obligations - these are all part of a complex equation determining whether a star says yes or no.\n\nAlthough the answer, in the end, is always visceral, it may still be useful to examine that equation, for it illuminates not only the dilemma of the actor but also the changing nature of the theater today.\n\nIn the first place, say actors and producers, there just aren't that many wonderful new plays around - even for a star. And wonderful new plays suited to a particular actor's particular talents are even scarcer. Consider Jim Dale, who won so much acclaim for his physical pyrotechnics in the 1974 production of ''Scapino.'' Afraid that an appearance in anything less spectacular might diminish his New York reputation, he waited six years to find ''Barnum'' and spent most of the interim acting in Walt Disney movies.\n\nMost actors, however, aren't so patient. And if they want to work in the theater on any regular basis, chances are they will have to accept roles that are less than perfect. Like many of her colleagues, Colleen Dewhurst, for instance, receives five or six unsolicited plays a month, in addition to those recommended by her agent. She says she still has difficulty finding anything truly compelling.\n\n''I'm always amazed when a critic says, 'why would so-and-so pick to do this play?' '' she says.''That statement should be cut from every critic's review. It makes the assumption that actors are reading wonderful plays all the time, and that out of six, they reached out and took the wrong one. It's difficult for actors like Gerry (Page) or Julie (Harris) or G.C. (Scott) to be attacked on that level, as though they hadn't used their heads. My main reason and theirs is that we want to come back to the stage - it's what keeps you alive.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
