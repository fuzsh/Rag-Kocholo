        "text": "It’s sure to be a classic series of films, but are audiences ready to embrace them? Or wait until they stream?\n\nWhat does a Native American film critic think?\n\nIn preparation for an upcoming press conference, I was fortunate to receive a screener of Kevin Costner’s ‘Horizon: An American Saga, Chapter 1.’ As a film critic, it is always an honor to review a film before the public, and I recognize such a privilege and honor it as best as I can.\n\nConsidering some impressively gorgeous cinematography, in this case, the bigger the screen, the better. If you want the best experience, in my view, Horizon, without question, would be a film to see in a theater.\n\nThis film, which runs for about 3 hours, isn’t perfect, but it is an impressive and sincere reflection of Kevin Costner’s experience in the film industry. It is detailed, well-proportioned, and—out of character from what I have seen before—pretty bloody.\n\nLet’s get into my review of this first film in the series.\n\nMy SNEWP-method score – 7.2/10\n\nStory – 1.5 | Nostalgia – 1.5 | Exhilaration – 1.2 | Wandering – 1.0 | Puzzle Pieces – 2.0\n\nFor further reading on my scoring system, read here: I call it ‘The SNEWP Method.’ My Rotten Tomatoes film critic scoring technique\n\nMy thoughts\n\nThe story was good and engaging but a bit all over the place. However, I say this with the understanding that Costner is attempting to create an overview of Westward Expansion and the dangers that existed all over the country. Though there is a bit of confusion, he does pull it off quite well.\n\nIn some ways, I think Costner is a bit shy about introducing new characters. In my personal view, Horizon is a great place to go over the top with each newly introduced storyline. I would have even gone a bit graphic novel on this concept, with graphics, pauses in the film and text-based announcements of who each person is. This is 100% a directorial choice, so I refuse to penalize anyone for their own sense of artistic vision.\n\nCostner’s character, Hayes Ellison, is quite likable, as are a lot of the characters.\n\nThe stand-out actors for me are Michael Rooker as the Irish Army Seargent Major Riordan and Tatanka Means as Taklishim.\n\nThe most difficult aspect of this film for me is the introduction of the Native American narrative. Without wanting to give away plot lines or storylines, I will say that the killing of settlers by Native people is introduced without any sort of backstory. In truth, such things did happen, and settlers and Native tribes fought against each other with horribly tragic results in real history.\n\nHowever, the introduction of killing by Native people in Horizon felt a bit dehumanized. It is not easy to write such a critique as I fear people might assume I am siding with Native warriors who are killing white settlers, but that is not the case.\n\nIn the film, the viewer sees settlers having fun and celebrating, so we see the human side. I am simply asking, why could we not see celebrations and celebrating of Native people before all of this carnage started? I have studied the history of Natives in film for decades now, and for me, this fits a bit of a pattern I have seen before.\n\nI am not taking away from the acting performances of the actors, as I have to say the actor’s performances in Horizon are perhaps the film’s strongest suit. In fact, the acting is simply wonderful, and when I think of any of the actors, I find it difficult to find much in the way of fault or criticism.\n\nIn terms of nostalgia, I have to admit hairs stand up on the back of my Native American critic’s back when I see soldiers at a fort in uniform. This was the time of moving Native people to reservations, forcing Native children into boarding schools and much more.\n\nI also appreciated the attention to certain details, such as how the scalps of black hair could have come from any race or tribe. I also appreciated the attention to diversity, though I didn’t necessarily believe soldiers at that time would refer to any Indians as ‘Indigenous.’ To me, the term hasn’t been embraced until the past ten years or so. But who knows what might have been said within the personal conversations in history?\n\nThere was a lot to digest, but it came together nicely\n\nAll said, there was a lot to digest, and perhaps there is some merit to Horizon making more of an impact as a television series. But I digress yet again about how great this film will likely be on the big screen. I am talking myself into it, and I’ve already seen the film.\n\nWith so many details to digest, my mind wandered on occasion, wondering what the significance was at any certain moment. But on other occasions, I was mesmerized, such as when young army soldiers took a quilted flower and pinned it to their jackets when saying goodbye to settlers staying at the fort. Admittedly, Costner’s son, Hayes Ellison, who plays Nathaniel Kittredge, is a wonderful young actor with a shining presence onscreen.\n\nAs a Native critic, it is always a sincere joy to see Native actors on screen and the performances of Tatanka Means as Taklishim and Owen Crowshoe as Pionsey were epic. Having watched the career trajectory of Tatanka Means for several years, to see how far he has continued to go is brilliant. Means’ work in Horizon is perhaps some of the best work he has done to date.\n\nI also want to give a shout to the additional Native actors who are also doing beautifully. You all do a Native critic proud.\n\nIt was a joy to watch all of you.\n\nOverall\n\nIn the end, everything came together nicely (as I cite in my SNEWP scoring method), just as if they were laid out in a nice series of puzzle pieces that fit together.\n\nThis is the film’s saving grace, and I can only imagine must have been a monumental task for Costner to keep track of.\n\nThe cinematography was excellent, with a series of absolutely beautiful, realistic and majestic film works. I also appreciated that not all of the Old West was flat, and Costner skillfully showcases towns on a hillside, mountain ranges, and even levels within desert landscapes.\n\nThe film arises triumphant, having managed to pull it all together to be a successful first part of a series I am looking forward to seeing to its completion.\n\nP.S. Urgh, I wish there were toothbrushes in the old west. Kudos to the make-up team.\n\n‘Horizon: An American Saga, Chapter 1’ hits theaters everywhere on June 28, 2024.\n\nAbout Horizon (From Warner Bros)\n\nAcademy Award-winning visionary filmmaker Kevin Costner directs New Line Cinema’s vast “Horizon: An American Saga” Chapters One and Two, a multi-faceted chronicle covering the Civil War expansion and settlement of the American West. A story of America too big for one film, this true cinematic event also stars Costner, who co-writes with Jon Baird (“The Explorers Guild”) and produces through his Territory Pictures.\n\nIn the great tradition of Warner Bros. Pictures’ iconic Westerns, “Horizon: An American Saga” explores the lure of the Old West and how it was won—and lost—through the blood, sweat and tears of many. Spanning the four years of the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, Costner’s ambitious cinematic adventure will take audiences on an emotional journey across a country at war with itself, experienced through the lens of families, friends and foes all attempting to discover what it truly means to be the United States of America.\n\nCostner, Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington and Giovanni Ribisi star alongside an impressive ensemble cast that includes Abbey Lee, Will Patton, Jena Malone, Michael Rooker, Danny Huston, Luke Wilson, Jeff Fahey, Isabelle Fuhrman, Ella Hunt, David O’Hara, Owen Crow Shoe, Tatanka Means, Tim Guinee, Scott Haze, Tom Payne, Alejandro Edda, James Russo, Jon Beavers, Jaime Campbell Bower and Michael Anganaro and more.\n\nCostner returns to directing for the first time since his 2003 critically acclaimed hit “Open Range,” and revisits Civil War-era America, the setting for his 1990 blockbuster and directorial debut, “Dances with Wolves,” which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. He produces alongside Howard Kaplan and Mark Gillard, with Danny Peykoff, Robert Scannell, Armyan Bernstein, Charlie Lyons, Barry Berg and Rod Lake executive producing.\n\nCostner is joined behind the camera by director of photography J. Michael Muro (“Billionaire Boys Club,” “Parker”), production designer Derek R. Hill (“Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” “The Magnificent Seven”), editor Miklos Wright (“For All Mankind,” “Open Range”) and costume designer Lisa Lovaas (“Ambulance,” “Transformers: The Last Knight”). The music is by Oscar nominee John Debney (“The Passion of the Christ,” “The Greatest Showman”).\n\nNew Line Cinema and Territory Pictures Present a Territory Pictures production, a Kevin Costner Film, “Horizon: An American Saga.” Warner Bros. Pictures will distribute the film in theaters Across North America, the first on June 28, 2024, the second on August 16, 2024, and in select international markets—Spain and the UK on those same respective dates, and Holland and Italy on 4 July and 15 August.\n\nDirected by: Kevin Costner\n\nWritten by: Kevin Costner, Jon Baird\n\nProduced by: Kevin Costner, Howard Kaplan, Mark Gillard\n\nExecutive Produced by: Danny Peykoff, Robert Scannell, Armyan Bernstein, Charlie Lyons, Barry Berg and Rod Lake\n\nStarring: Kevin Costner, Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Owen Crow Shoe, Tatanka Means, Ella Hunt, Tim Guinee, Danny Huston, Colin Cunningham, Scott Haze, Tom Payne, Abbey Lee, Michael Rooker, Will Patton, Georgia MacPhail, Douglas Smith, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jamie Campbell Bower, Alejandro Edda, Wasé Winyan Chief, Michael Anganaro, Angus Macfadyen, Jon Beavers, Alex Nibley, Kathleen Quinlan, Etienne Kellici, Amos Jason Charging Cloud, Bodhi Okuma Linton, Gregory Cruz, James Russo, Jeff Fahey, David O’Hara, Chris Conner, Leroy M.
