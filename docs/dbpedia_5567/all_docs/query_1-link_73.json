        "text": "Paula Patton is sharing an inspiring story of how she met her new man.\n\nLast week, the actor took to Instagram about her boyfriend who has helped restore her faith in love while commemorating when they first met. According to Patton, their paths crossed a year ago after reading a book about finding the right one.\n\n\"I have a story for you...One year ago today, I received a book I bought and forgot about,\" she said of \"Calling in the One: How to Attract the Love of Your Life in 7 Weeks,‚Äù by Katherine Woodward Thomas. When the book arrived on Valentine‚Äôs Day in 2023, she \"took it as a sign.\"\n\n\"I had been single for a very long time and couldn‚Äôt remember the last time I had a Valentine, so I decided to begin reading it that day and do all the work the book suggested,\" Patton explained.\n\nAfter that ‚Äìthe mom of one who shares a 13-year-old son named Julian with ex-husband Robin Thicke whom she divorced in 2014‚Äì embarked on an eye-opening path. \"It was an incredible journey of self-discovery where I called in myself and changed the wiring in my brain and the genetic patterns blocking me.\"\n\nStill, she didn't encounter her man in seven days as the book suggested, but Patton did not let that prevent her from manifesting love.\n\n\"While I didn‚Äôt find my one in seven weeks, I did start calling in better relationships with friends, work partnerships, and myself,\" she explained while adding, \"And then it happened: I met Prakash, and today, a year later, I am celebrating Valentine‚Äôs Day with my love!\"\n\n\"Prakash, you are a magnificent man with tremendous integrity,\" she said of TV sports host, Prakash Amritraj.\n\nShe continued, \"Life is full of laughter and joy with you! You are one of my greatest blessings! You take me on adventures and make me feel safe. You have my back, and I have yours. I love you.\"\n\nPatton and Amritraj share a common interest: fitness. Earlier this month, they were spotted in Miami while performing core exercises together.\n\nDays before that, they demonstrated how to do leg reps.\n\n\"@paulapattonofficial makin‚Äô me step my game up! üí™üèæ Leg Day üòç,\" said Amritraj on IG.\n\nIn December, they attended the 18th Annual Vijay Amritraj Foundation Gala to support deserving causes in India.\n\nBy clicking Subscribe, you confirm that you have read and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Policy.
