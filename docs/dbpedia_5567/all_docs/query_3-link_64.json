        "text": "University of Botswana’s School of Graduate Studies Acting Dean, Professor Agreement Lathi Jotia, is December Ohio University's Patton College Alumni of the Month. This also follows a Teaching Excellence Award Professor Jotia received from the University of Botswana in August this year for his innovative ways of teaching and impacting student learning. Professor Jotia is a graduate of The Patton College having earned his PhD in Educational Studies (Cultural Studies in Education) in 2006. He also earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Education (Adolescent-to-Young Adult Education) and a Master’s Degree in International Affairs (African Studies/Politics) from Ohio University in 2002 and 2003 respectively.\n\nProfessor Jotia says he chose Ohio University's Patton College for his studies because of the interdisciplinary nature of the programme on Educational Studies, which allowed him to tailor his PhD research to embrace multicultural diversity while at the same time remaining solid on his theoretical orientation on Democracy and Education in developing areas. Above all, he says his choice was influenced by the fact that The Patton College had the best qualified professors who were solidly rooted on critical theory and critical pedagogy. The College was also well resourced, be it in books or technology.\n\nRegarding how Ohio prepared him for his path in education, Professor Jotia says the various teaching, GA, and consultant opportunities at The Patton College allowed him to interact with people from various frontiers of life and diverse backgrounds. Above all, he states that it gave him the opportunity to embark on pragmatic scholarship where his consciousness was challenged to not only learn but to also find ways of fitting-in into the robust and complex diverse culture of the USA.\n\n\"My best opportunity was when I was accorded the opportunity to become a Graduate Teaching Assistant where I facilitated a course on Education and Cultural Diversity,\" reckons Professor Jotia. The course, he adds compelled him to grow fast mentally and in scholarship since they discussed controversial issues on education and marginalisation, gender disparity, Global-North vs. Global-South and the attached stereotypes, racism as cancer in society, what it meant to be Black or White in the USA; amongst many others. In addition, he was also taught by professors of repute who were so passionate about democracy and multicultural diversity in the USA.\n\nProfessor Jotia also notes that his most exciting moment was when he appeared on radio and television as a Cultural and Political Consultant under Ohio Valley International Council Programme in liaison with The Patton College to educate people about the African continent and my country Botswana. \"What I found very funny and perplexing during the interviews and even during the call-ins is when people displayed a wrong and legitimate thought process that Africa is a country and not a continent,\" he adds. He says he laughed his lungs out when he thought of this level of ignorance. Nonetheless, he observes that he also felt happy that he was on the course of education to liberate the masses from stereotypical assumptions and conclusions about Botswana and Africa in general.\n\nRegarding his most memorable time at Patton College, Professor Jotia says he was impressed by the level of scholarship of his professors. \"When they taught us Critical Theory versus Democratic Education and Multicultural Diversity—you would just wish that you become them overnight. Those folks meant business in scholarship!\" says Professor Jotia.\n\nHe also explains that the classroom was his best space since it accorded him the opportunity to advance his mental faculties while at the same time robustly challenging those ideas which he thought were suppressive and unjust in terms of advocating and justifying the socio-economic and political inequality in the USA and beyond. The classroom at that level, he notes, made him understand the beauty of appreciating intellectual diversity and also having to learn to live with those ideas and values contrary to one's space and comfort zone.\n\n\"I also liked the African Student Association events because they made me 'To see Africa at OU' and quenched the home-sickness. But I still remember the then Carriage Hill Apartments where I started my family with my wife Winnie some 21 years back. We have seen the greatness of God in Athens, Ohio!\" says Professor Jotia.\n\nOn tips to study at Ohio, Professor Jotia begins by highlighting his upbringing by his 99-year old grandmother, Ngwene Mma Khani Jotia, whom he says does not even have a primary school certificate. Notwithstanding, his grandmother inculcated in him social and moral values that he will take to his grave. He says she taught him to believe in himself besides being a hard worker despite the challenges.\n\n\"She taught me to be a fighter who is sober yet brutal intellectually. I was taught by my grandmother that you do not need to have a history of success or a good family background in order for you to become successful—all you need is to be a focused hard worker who has a sense of purpose,\" he explains. Further, he says his grandmother taught him to fear and trust God, principles which have sustained him from Zero to a University Professor and currently to being an Acting Dean of Post Graduate Studies. Professor Jotia highlights that he knows God has something special for him beyond this position. He credits his grandmother who has been the fountain of his strength and focus.\n\nProfessor Jotia's Career Opportunities:\n\nActing Dean, School of Graduate Studies & Professor of Education, University of Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana (June 2019-present)\n\nVisiting Assistant Professor, Department of Educational Studies, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida (2007-2008)\n\nAdjunct Assistant Professor, Department of Educational Studies, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio (Summer 2007)\n\nArticle - Courtesy:Ohio University (The Gladys W. and David H.
