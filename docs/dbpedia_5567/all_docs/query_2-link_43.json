        "text": "George S. Patton, Jr. (1885 – 1945) was probably the best tank commander of all time, but there were other generals who were better at the hard, gritty fighting needed to break through strong enemy defenses.\n\nMany Americans, from GIs subjected to a “vainglorious Patton harangue” to Eleanor Roosevelt, had justifiably low opinions of “old blood and guts.” In addition to the problems with Patton described in the film: (1) Patton needlessly sacrificed the lives of his men not only to beat Montgomery to Messina but also in March of 1945 when he attempted to free his son-in-law from a prisoner of war camp deep in enemy territory. This endeavor, motivated by personal concerns, was unsuccessful, reckless and foolhardy. Patton’s son-in-law was seriously wounded in the raid but not freed. (2) Patton was anti-Semitic. (3) After the war, as military governor of Bavaria, Patton failed to implement the Army’s de-Nazification program. (4) Patton thought that General Dwight Eisenhower (who was his friend and who often intervened to protect him) was “yellow.” (5) Patton’s expressed hatred of the Russians (at that time our ally and the country which had suffered far more casualties and greater destruction from Nazi aggression than any other), while prophetic, caused serious diplomatic problems. (6) Patton would subject his troops to ranting tirades. A child being shown this film should be warned that General Patton had problems not fully elaborated in the movie.\n\nWhatever his deficiencies, General Patton was a unique asset to the war effort. Despite a few lapses, he cared for his men and was affectionate with the people on his immediate staff. He was also genuinely religious and he was courteous to women. Many soldiers who served under him love the memory of General Patton. He inspired them and led them to victory. See the web page for The Patton Society. Note also that the rivalry between Patton and General George Montgomery was part of the rivalry between the U.S. Army and the British Army.\n\nPatton received his first taste of combat in 1916 as a cavalry officer under General John J. Pershing on a punitive raid to Mexico. During the First World War, he was placed in command of the U.S. Tank Corps and was shot in the leg leading a tank charge on foot. When the Second World War neared, Patton was placed in charge of training tank commanders. At this post, Patton developed tactics that he used in North Africa. Patton practiced the motto “When in doubt: ATTACK!”\n\nThe Commander of Allied Forces in Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower (later President of the United States) considered Patton his friend despite their many differences of opinion. Eisenhower saw Patton as a volatile character with a trait of exhibitionism who was not as good as other U.S. generals at the heavy fighting necessary to break through enemy concentrations. For this reason, Eisenhower did not use Patton in the slugging match with the Germans necessary for the Allies to break out of the beachhead at Normandy. But Eisenhower properly regarded Patton as a headstrong and fearless master of the fast and overwhelming pursuit. For that reason, once the Allies had broken through in Normandy, Eisenhower put Patton’s Third Army in the forefront.\n\nEisenhower advanced General Omar Bradley over Patton because Eisenhower considered Bradley to be outstanding in every aspect of command and a master of every military maneuver. Bradley did not seek to dramatize himself.\n\nThis film was intended to be, and in large part is, a serious study of Patton’s record and character. A bit of trivia demonstrates this. George C. Scott made an in-depth study of Patton in order to play the role. He believed that one scene in which Patton threatened to relieve one of his officers of command when the officer protested a particularly risky operation was too harsh. Scott believed that the scene suggested that Patton was indifferent to his men’s welfare. Scott protested the scene but the studio owners wouldn’t change it. Because General Patton had never been seen lying down in a combat situation, mentally or physically, Scott purposefully played the scene with Patton reclining on a couch, hoping that the audience would notice that it was false.\n\nPatton and the Study of History:\n\nIn the movie, when Patton is flying from England into France after the Normandy Invasion. The book sitting on his lap is “The Norman Conquest of England” It tells how William the Conquerer developed a road infrastructure in Normandy to allow him to build a base of operations to invade England. When Patton is in in Africa, facing the German General Erwin Rommel, the Desert Fox, there is a scene in which he is awakened by his staff, the book Patton was reading when he fell asleep is a book by Rommel. Patton was trying to get into Rommel’s mind.\n\nGreat Patton Quotes:\n\n“If the proper study of mankind is man. The proper study of warfare are maps.” [From Holien C-Span program]\n\n“Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of the men who follow and the man who leads that gains the victory.” [From D’Este Article]"
