        "text": "As part of the ongoing Corrective Action Plan for the Sewer System – over the next few weeks, you will receive a notice(s) in the mail/ via robotic phone notification and/ or email ( if you have sign up for email alerts regarding):\n\nSmoke Testing Notice\n\nPa Rural Water has been contracted by Patton Borough of behalf of the Patton to conduct a smoke test assessment of the sewer system located in the Second Ward area of Patton Borough, on July 30th and July 31st, 2024. The smoke testing could be delayed if heavy rains are persistent and soak the ground. Later dates may need to be scheduled.\n\nThis smoke testing assessment will assist our operators in locating breaks and defects in our sewer system. A non-toxic smoke will be introduced into a manhole and forced down the sewer lines with a blower. Smoke will escape the system at any point where there is an open break in the line. For example, smoke may rise from the ground in yards, stream banks, storm drains, etc. Smoke will also escape from all manhole lids, vents on building/home roofs, cleanouts, or foundations in the area where the testing is being conducted. Be advised that smoke can enter your home, office, or place of business. Should smoke enter your building or home, open windows for ventilation and contact the crew working in the area.\n\nThe Smoke is:\n\nNon-toxic, non-staining, has a slight odor, white to grey in color, and creates no fire hazard.\n\nYou do not have to be on site during testing.\n\nIt is advisable to pour a gallon of water into every sink, tub, and floor drain that is not subject to everyday use. This will fill the p-traps and prevent smoke from entering the building or home.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to call:\n\nThe Patton Borough Office\n\n(814)-674-3641\n\nThe Annual Kid’s Trout Fishing Derby is scheduled for Saturday May 25, 2024 starting at daybreak (5:30ish am) and will run until 11:00am.
