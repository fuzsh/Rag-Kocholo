Other circumstances also arise on occasion, such as the inability to staff our schools. This means we sometimes need to serve a different meal than what is posted on the menu with little to no notice. This situation is out of our control and something that school districts all across the country are experiencing. We are doing our best every day to come up with solutions to these challenges, including working hard with our vendors to secure meals as published and minimize meal substitutions to our best ability.\n\nRest assured, all SFUSD meals will continue to follow our strict nutritional, culinary and wellness guidelines to ensure students have the choice of nutritious meals every school day. We will also continue to accommodate students with special diets and allergies.\n\nWe appreciate your support and understanding. Please contact us at SchoolLunch@sfusd.edu if you have any questions or feedback.\n\nFeedback\n\nPlease double check which survey is for you. A list of sites can be found at the top of either survey that indicates who should be providing feedback there."
