        "text": "1. The Collar by George Herbert Dr. Vipul V. Kapoor\n\n2. Introduction George Herbert (1593-1633) was a religious and metaphysical poet. He is known for his pure and subtle use of language. His all poems including ‘The Collar’ were published in ‘The Temple’ in 1633. ‘The Collar’ by George Herbert expresses the poet’s desire to escape from his religious bondages and restrictions. He wants to start living a life full of freedom.\n\n3. ‘The Collar’ by George Herbert expresses the poet’s desire to escape from his religious bondages and restrictions. He wants to start living a life full of freedom.\n\n4. The Collar A Symbol of Bondages, Restrictions, Control\n\n5. I struck the board, and cried, “No more; I will abroad! What? shall I ever sigh and pine? My lines and life are free, free as the road, Loose as the wind, as large as store. Shall I be still in suit? Have I no harvest but a thorn To let me blood, and not restore What I have lost with cordial fruit? The poet strikes the table and shouts out of anger, \"That's it! I'm leaving! Am I meant to sit around feeling bad forever? My life is as free as roads and as free as the winds. So why should I behave like a servant? I have no good fruits and have got only thorns in my life. I have lost my pleasures.\n\n6. Sure there was wine Before my sighs did dry it; there was corn Before my tears did drown it. Is the year only lost to me? Have I no bays to crown it, No flowers, no garlands gay? All blasted? All wasted? Not so, my heart; but there is fruit, And thou hast hands. I used to relish wine before I dried it all up with my heavy sighs, that I ate fresh bread before I soaked it in my tears. And from this year onwards I have lost this fun. I have no celebrations, bouquets or crowns to honor my brilliance. All pleasures are faded and withered away. But pleasure still exists, and you can go out and grab it.\n\n7. Recover all thy sigh-blown age On double pleasures: leave thy cold dispute Of what is fit and not. Forsake thy cage, Thy rope of sands, Which petty thoughts have made, and made to thee Good cable, to enforce and draw, And be thy law, While thou didst wink and wouldst not see. Away! take heed; I will abroad. Recover your long lost pleasures. Don’t think of what is good and what is bad. Come out of the cage and this bondage of morality. Your own thoughts have made this fake rope. Theses ropes have worked well so far for forcing people to obey all laws of religion I'm getting out of here.\n\n8. Call in thy death’s-head there; tie up thy fears; He that forbears To suit and serve his need Deserves his load.” But as I raved and grew more fierce and wild At every word, Me thought I heard one calling, Child! And I replied My Lord. Call off that alarming skull that's meant to remind me of death; lock your fears away. Those who don't do exactly what they want are given burdens of responsibilities and duty. But the longer I raved and complained, I thought I could hear a voice calling to me. It said “Child!”, and I replied, “Yes, my Lord!”\n\n9. Theme of Responsibilities / Duties • The poet feels collared both literally and metaphorically: he’s a priest wearing the traditional white “dog collar,” and he can’t escape the demands of his Christian faith. Feeling weighed down by his duties, he complains and wants to get freedom of life. But the last line comes with a conclusion that God can never be ignored.\n\n10. Form of the Poem • The Collar’ by George Herbert is a thirty-six line poem written in four stanzas of nine lines each. • There is no regular rhyming pattern found in all stanzas. However, final four lines of the poem have rhyming pattern ABAB. • Herbert chose this pattern, or lack of pattern, to express the disorder of his own thoughts."
