        "text": "A Zbigniew Herbert Sampler: Selected Poems\n\nBy HARVEY SHAPIRO\n\nbigniew Herbert, the Polish poet and essayist who insisted that civilization depended on artists' staking out clear moral positions resistant to the winds of history and ideology, died yesterday in Warsaw. He was 73.\n\nThe cause of death was not disclosed, but a longtime friend and fellow poet, Krzysztof Karasek, said Mr. Herbert had asthma and serious circulatory problems.\n\nThe Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, the 1996 Nobel laureate, told the PAP news agency that Mr. Herbert was a \"great artist and thinker\" and that he would have an eternal place in Polish literature.\n\nMr. Herbert's poetry defied categorization. It spoke for no philosophy or school and favored no party or dogma. Although he was a political poet who explored the mechanisms of power and ideology, he resisted Fascism and Communism, nationalism and the church and was willing to pay the price of such moral independence. He gave the impression of being a man alone, answerable to no one except his own conscience.\n\nPlace and history determined Mr. Herbert's career as a poet. He lived much of his adult life under the ideologies of National Socialism and Communism. The impingement of the political, the political becoming personal, informed all of his work.\n\nTo the chaos of the 20th century, to which he was a personal witness, Mr. Herbert brought a mind trained in law and disciplined by classical literature. It was a mind that would not succumb to self-pity or nostalgia, a mind steeled against chaos.\n\nIn \"Pebble,\" one of his best-known poems, he wrote:\n\nPebbles cannot be tamed\n\nto the end they will look at us\n\nwith a calm and very clear eye\n\nThose lines could describe his stance as a writer. The poet Robert Hass once said that Mr. Herbert wrote as if it were \"the task of the poet, in a world full of loud lies, to say what is irreducibly true in a level voice.\"\n\nMr. Herbert was born in the city of Lvov, then part of Poland and now in Ukraine, in 1924. (The name Herbert is pronounced as in English; in fact, Mr. Herbert claimed the 17th-century English poet George Herbert as a distant relation.) In 1939, as a 15-year-old, he experienced the annexation of his hometown by the Soviet Union. When the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact collapsed, the city was then seized by the Germans. At the end of the war it was recaptured by the Soviet Union, which retained control over the Baltic republics.\n\nMr. Herbert wrote his first poems during the Nazi occupation of Poland. As Stanislaw Baranczak, a critic who teaches at Harvard University, has observed, \"The image of a city under siege, one of the several symbols that constantly recur in his work, has a historical poignancy that makes it much more than just a figure of speech.\"\n\nMr. Herbert took part in the Polish resistance to the Nazi occupiers. When the war ended, he enrolled at the University of Cracow, where he received a master's degree in economics. Later he earned a law degree from Nicolas Copernicus University and a degree in philosophy from the University of Warsaw.\n\nStalinist restrictions on writers after the war and Mr. Herbert's refusal to bend to Communist dogma and the party functionaries in the Writers' Union impeded the publication of his poetry for 15 years.\n\nDuring that period he developed his distinctive voice, a style, as the author Eva Hoffman has written, \"that functions as a sort of antidote to the dangers of sentimentality or inflation -- restrained, ironic, stripped of punctuation, averse to 'tricks of the imagination' and passionate in its insistence on precision.\"\n\nHis first three volumes of poetry, \"A String of Light\" (1956), \"Hermes, a Dog and a Star\" (1957) and \"The Study of an Object\" (1961), established him as a dominant figure in Polish literature. His search for moral and humanistic values would make a strong impression on his contemporaries and earn him an international audience.\n\nMany poems in those books also appear in the volumes of his poetry available in English: \"Selected Poems,\" translated by Czeslaw Milosz and Peter Dale Scott (Ecco Press, 1986); \"Selected Poems\" (Oxford Press, 1977), translated by John and Bodgana Carpenter; \"Report From the Besieged City,\" translated by the Carpenters (Ecco Press, 1985), and \"Mr. Cogito,\" also translated by the Carpenters (Ecco Press, 1993).\n\nMr. Herbert was a modernist in that he wrote in free form, without rhyme and meter. He was an antimodernist in that his work frequently jumped off from Greek myth, Shakespeare and the Latin poets, and in his refusal to ape chaos. In an essay in praise of the great Dutch painters of the 17th century, he explained, \"A major part of contemporary art declares itself on the side of chaos, gesticulates in a void, or tells the story of its own barren soul.\"\n\nAgainst this attitude, he posed the painters of that period in the Netherlands, who \"believed in the purposefulness of their work and the possibility of interhuman communication. They affirmed visible reality with an inspired scrupulousness.\" And they did that, he asserted, \"as if the order of the world and the revolution of the stars, the permanence of the firmament, depended on it.\"\n\nYet there is nothing in Mr. Herbert's poetry to suggest that a traditional, conventional art, one imitating the art of the past, could carry today's meanings. On the contrary, in one of his strongest poems, \"Apollo and Marsyas,\" he describes how pain can dictate a new art. Marsyas, a mortal in the myth on which the poem is based, loses a musical contest to Apollo, the Greek god of beauty, who signifies classical control (\"absolute ear/versus immense range\"). Apollo punishes Marsyas for daring to challenge his authority by flaying him alive. Describing Marsyas's pain, Mr. Herbert writes:\n\nonly seemingly\n\nis the voice of Marsyas\n\nmonotonous\n\nand composed of a single vowel\n\nAaa\n\nin reality\n\nMarsyas relates\n\nthe inexhaustible wealth\n\nof his body\n\nbald mountains of liver\n\nwhite ravines of aliment\n\nAs Apollo departs to that sound, he wonders \"whether out of Marsyas's howling/there will not someday arise/a new kind/ of art ... \"\n\nAnd to describe the effect of that art, Mr. Herbert writes:\n\nsuddenly\n\nat his feet\n\nfalls a petrified nightingale\n\nhe looks back\n\nand sees that the hair of the tree to which\n\nMarsyas was fastened\n\nis white\n\ncompletely\n\nAnd so the poem ends, moving the myth completely into the 20th century. The pared-down rhetoric, its terse description, is classical (seen with Apollo's eye) but the poem is savage, because it was written in a savage time and because its author believed that art must find a way to reconcile beauty with the reality of human suffering.\n\nMr. Herbert's stark rhetoric is more than a stylistic characteristic. It signals a moral concern, openly stated in many of his poems, that the path to such reconciliation is to see the world clearly, steadily, with an eye toward understanding it and then writing about it truthfully. His poem \"Mr. Cogito and the Imagination,\" for example, begins:\n\nMr. Cogito never trusted\n\ntricks of the imagination\n\nthe piano at the top of the Alps\n\nplayed false concerts for him\n\n(He took \"the piano at the top of the Alps\" from Rimbaud's \"Illuminations,\" a source of the surreal in modern art.)\n\nLater in the poem Mr. Herbert focuses on his theme:\n\nhe adored tautologies\n\nexplanations\n\nidem per idem\n\nthat a bird is a bird\n\nslavery means slavery\n\na knife is a knife\n\ndeath remains death\n\nMr. Cogito inhabits many of Mr. Herbert's poems, a character in search of moral certainties. He is an ordinary man who enjoys reading trashy newspaper stories and who fails when he tries transcendental meditation: \"his stream of consciousness brings up detritus like a tin can.\" He is also Mr. Herbert's mouthpiece, a way of distancing himself from himself.\n\nIn the Cogito poems Mr. Herbert became his own subject, but they are not confessional poems in the tradition of Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton. They do not dramatize the ego; they dramatize a mind and the way it looks at the world. Ultimately, they return us to the world, as do all of his poems, and the search for what is durable in our lives, for what is attainable.\n\nIn \"The Envoy of Mr. Cogito,\" he appears to be looking back on his life in Poland during the long years of war and repression. It begins:\n\nGo where those others went to the\n\ndark boundary\n\nfor the golden fleece of nothing- ness your last prize\n\ngo upright among those who are\n\non their knees\n\namong those with their backs\n\nturned and those toppled in the\n\ndust\n\nyou were saved not in order to live\n\nyou have little time you must give testimony\n\nMr. Herbert was co-editor of a poetry journal, Poezja, from 1965 to 1968 but resigned in protest of anti-Semitic policies. He traveled widely through the West and lived in Paris, Berlin and the United States, where he taught briefly at the University of California at Los Angeles. In one of his essay collections several years ago, \"Still Life With a Bridle,\" translated by the Carpenters (Ecco Press, 1991) he goes in search of the Dutch bourgeois in the golden age of Dutch culture, the 17th century.\n\nAfter a break of several years from writing, Mr. Herbert, who is survived by his wife, Katarzyna, wrote new poems in 1997 when his health improved slightly. The result was \"Storm's Epilogue,\" published this year.\n\nMr. Herbert once gave this advice to younger writers: \"Life is more complicated, more mysterious and more convoluted than the party, the army, the police. Let us detach ourselves a little from this truly horrible everyday reality and try to write about doubt, anxiety and despair.\""
