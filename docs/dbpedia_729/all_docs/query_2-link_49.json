        "text": "George Herbert Mead's advocacy of innovative social reform was not a distinct endeavor unrelated to his pragmatist social philosophy. In fact, the convergence of social philosophy and social reform is discernable in Mead's analysis of social settlements: an analysis that led him to conclude that settlements were indispensable social organizations for promoting cooperative living and civic progress within America's emerging industrial municipalities. For Mead, the settlement was the only social organization capable of understanding the immigrant's world and explaining that world to the nonimmigrant. In 1908, Mead wrote a letter to the Chicago Record Herald endorsing the work of social settlements. He composed the letter during an era when the violent actions of some political extremists (i.e., anarchists) seemed to encourage many native-born citizens to regard all immigrants as nascent terrorists and to treat organizations created to assist immigrants, such as settlements, with distrust and hostility.\n\nMost unfortunately, the Chicago Record Herald refused to publish Mead's letter. This article describes the historical circumstances that prompted Mead to write a letter in defense of settlements; it then reprints the original letter in its entirety, with annotations; and, it concludes by briefly noting the letter's significance in relation to Mead's other writings about social settlements.\n\n1 Among the more influential proponents of “propaganda by the deed” was Luigi Galleani (1861–1931), an Italian anarchist active in the United States from 1901 until his deportation in 1919. Galleani was described as “[a] revolutionary zealot” who “preached a militant form of anarchism that advocated the overthrow of capitalism and government by violent means, dynamite and assassination not excluded”; Avrich, Paul, Anarchist Portraits (Princeton, 1988), 169Google Scholar. Moreover, “[f]rom the moment of his arrival in the United States, Galleani openly espoused revolutionary warfare, calling for dynamite, nitroglycerin, knives, gunpowder, blasting gelatin, and pistols as means to working-class liberation”; Gage, Beverly, The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror (New York, 2009), 209Google Scholar.\n\n3 Feffer, Andrew, “Sociability and Social Conflict in George Herbert Mead's Interactionism, 1900–1919,” Journal of the History of Ideas 51 (Apr.–June 1990): 234CrossRefGoogle Scholar. Similarly, Dmitri Shalin has emphasized Mead's commitment to social activism: “Mead was at the forefront of the contemporary movement for social reform and at some point seriously contemplated a career as professional reformer . . . . Mead's life can be seen as an attempt to prove in both theory and practice that revolutionary objectives can be achieved by essentially conservative means”; Shalin, Dmitri N., “G. H. Mead, Socialism, and the Progressive Agenda,” American Journal of Sociology 93 (Jan. 1988): 913–14CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n4 Initially presented as a public address at the University of Chicago on October 27, 1907, “The Social Settlement: Its Basis and Function” was later published in January of 1908; Mead, G. H., “The Social Settlement: Its Basis and Function,” University of Chicago Record 12 (Jan. 1908): 108–10Google Scholar. What we identify as “Sympathy, Science, and Social Settlements” is the original, untitled twelve-page document filed in folder 24, box 13 of the George Herbert Mead Papers archived at the University of Chicago Library. Mary J. Deegan published a version of the same document using the title “The Function and Role of the Social Settlement”; Mead, G. H., “The Function and Role of the Social Settlement” in Play, School, and Society, ed. Deegan, Mary (New York, 1999), 64–75Google Scholar. According to Deegan, “The Function and Role of the Social Settlement” was a “pre-conference” address to the 1910 meeting of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections; Deegan, , “Play from the Perspective of George Herbert Mead” in Play, School, and Society, ed. Deegan, Mary (New York, 1999), lxxxivGoogle Scholar.\n\n5 See Campbell, James, “George Herbert Mead on Intelligent Reconstruction,” Symbolic Interaction 4 (Fall 1981): 191–205CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and Campbell, , The Community Reconstructed: The Meaning of Pragmatic Social Thought (Urbana, 1992)Google Scholar. Pragmatists such as Mead treated social reconstruction as an intelligent mode of transformative social action. Fischer identified reconstruction as “a central theme for classical American pragmatists”; Fischer, Marilyn, “Interpretation's Contrapuntal Pathways: Addams and the Averbuch Affair,” Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society 47 (Fall 2011): 490CrossRefGoogle Scholar. As elaborated by Campbell, the “process of conceptual reconstruction is placed by Pragmatic social thinkers within the context of a larger, many-phased process of social reconstruction. They believe that to solve a social problem it is necessary for us not only to act differently but to think differently”; Campbell, The Community Reconstructed, 62.\n\n7 Detailed accounts of the pervasive tension that characterized Chicago in 1908 can be found in Addams, Jane, “The Chicago Settlements and Social Unrest,” Charities and the Common 20 (May 1908): 155–66Google Scholar; Goldstein, Robert J., “The Anarchist Scare of 1908: A Sign of Tensions in the Progressive Era,” American Studies 15 (Fall 1974): 55–78Google Scholar; and, Roth, Walter and Kraus, Joe, An Accidental Anarchist (San Francisco, 1998), 1–12Google Scholar. Addams's 1908 essay and Mead's 1908 letter can be read as companion pieces. Both documents narrate the events surrounding Averbuch's controversial death; both attempt to “interpret” or explain immigrant communities to nonimmigrant readers; and, both extol the salutary work of social settlements.\n\n11 Mead characterized the residential aspect of a social settlement as its most distinctive feature: “The corner stone of settlement theory has been that the residents have identified themselves with the immediate portion of the community where their work is found by making their home there”; Mead, “The Social Settlement,” 108. Moreover, as noted by Feffer: “It was the settlement's unique role as a home for intelligent and inspired people, rather than a mission for God or a scientific outpost, that Mead considered its unrivaled strength. The settlement enables its residents to become an understanding part of city life, self-conscious intelligence in the midst of the incomprehensible urban landscape”; Feffer, Andrew, The Chicago Pragmatists and American Progressivism (Ithaca, NY, 1993), 114Google Scholar.\n\n17 Dr. Alice Hamilton was a resident at Hull-House during this tumultuous period. In her autobiography, she described the general distrust and fear of reporters “shared by all the residents of Hull House.” Particularly distressing was the ability of reporters to “turn the most innocent answer into a ridiculous or a damaging statement.” She pointedly recalled a comment one reporter made to Addams during this time: “I may as well tell you, Miss Addams, that I have orders from my paper to link Averbuch up with Hull House and that is what I'm going to do”; Hamilton, Exploring the Dangerous Trades, 77–78.\n\n18 Lissak noted that Mead and other professors from the University of Chicago actively supported Hull-House's policies regarding “the education and sociocultural assimilation of ‘new immigrants’ from eastern and southern Europe”; Lissak, Rivka S., Pluralism and Progressives: Hull House and the New Immigrants, 1890–1919 (Chicago, 1989), 7Google Scholar. As additional evidence of Mead's commitment to the cause of “new immigrants,” Gary Cook noted, “in 1908 … Mead helped to found the Immigrant's Protective League, and from 1909 to 1919 he served along with Addams as a vice-president for this private philanthropic agency”; Cook, Gary A., George Herbert Mead: The Making of a Social Pragmatist (Urbana, 1993), 104Google Scholar.\n\n20 Roth and Kraus, Accidental Anarchist, 76. The chairman of the Sociology Department at the University of Chicago, Albion W. Small, notified Addams on March 19, 1908, that he had written to the Chicago Tribune protesting the anti-immigrant polemics generated by the “Averbuch affair”; Deegan, Jane Addams, 82, 101 n.45. By 2013, social media played as important a role as the print media in telling the story of the “terrorist bombings” at the Boston Marathon and in identifying, often incorrectly, potential suspects: “On sites like Facebook, Twitter and reddit, social media users, relying on snippets of police scanner traffic and photos of the finish line, turned to crowd-sourcing to isolate and identify potential suspects. These online vigilantes may have been driven by good intentions, but they would, over the course of Marathon Week, finger the wrong young men, in some cases to damaging effect”; Helman, Scott and Russell, Jenna, Long Mile Home (New York, 2014), 132Google Scholar.\n\n23 Roth and Kraus, Accidental Anarchist, 46. Mead and Post were possibly acquainted because both were active members of the Chicago City Club and the Chicago Literary Club; Huebner, Daniel R., Becoming Mead: The Social Process of Academic Knowledge (Chicago, 2014), 35CrossRefGoogle Scholar. In addition, Mead had previously published a speech regarding Chicago's public schools in Post's weekly; George H. Mead, “Our Public Schools,” The Public, June 22, 1907, 281–85. Louis F. Post (1849–1928) was one of America's more vivid progressive reformers. During Reconstruction, Post secured “a position as stenographer and law clerk to Major David T. Corbin, a Carpetbagger member of the South Carolina State Senate”; Candeloro, Dominic, “Louis Post as a Carpetbagger in South Carolina: Reconstruction as a Forerunner of the Progressive Movement,” American Journal of Economics and Sociology 34 (Oct. 1975): 424CrossRefGoogle Scholar. In 1913, Post's level of public service improved considerably when he became Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Wilson administration. An avid supporter of Henry George's Single Tax Movement, Post was instrumental in converting that single-issue movement into a more wide-ranging form of progressivism after George's death. As a journalist, Post's acerbic style was frequently displayed in editorials and features that appeared in The Public; Candeloro, Dominic, “From the Narrow Single Tax to Broad Progressivism: The Intellectual Biography of Louis F. Post, 1898–1913,” American Journal of Economics and Sociology 37 (July 1978): 325–36CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n28 According to Mina Carson, settlement residents often viewed themselves as “interpreters:” “As spokesmen for the interests of immigrants, workers, and the poor, the settlers called themselves ‘mediators’ and ‘interpreters,’ and they styled the settlement house a ‘listening post’”; Carson, Mina, Settlement Folk: Social Thought and the American Settlement Movement, 1885–1930 (Chicago, 1990), 150Google Scholar. Settlement workers were able to “interpret” the immigrant community for others because residents had developed a “neighborly relation” with that community. The neighborly relation was a distinguishing feature of settlement philosophy: “The neighborly relation is predicated on the belief that in certain fundamental ways people are alike”; Lengermann and Neibrugge-Brantley, “Back to the Future,” 16.\n\n29 As Mead explained: “It is the privilege of the social settlement to be part of its own immediate community, to approach its conditions with no preconceptions, to be the exponents of no dogma or fixed rules of conduct, but to find out what the problems of the community are and as part of it to help toward their solution”; Mead, “The Social Settlement,” 109.\n\n30 Mead's letter, a typescript with holographic corrections, is four pages in length. Our corrections are enclosed in square brackets. Also, at the beginning of paragraph four, we have inserted our words in parentheses where we felt it might help the reader to follow Mead's narrative flow – the flow is stymied because of omitted words and awkward syntax, not by the intricacies of the argument. While only cosmetic differences distinguish the “essay” published in The Public from the original letter sent to the Chicago Record Herald, we thought it was appropriate to reproduce the version of the letter rejected by the Record Herald. The authors gratefully acknowledge the Chicago History Museum for permission to reprint George Herbert Mead's unpublished letter in its entirety.\n\n32 Giordano Bruno (1548–1600) was an Italian philosopher, theologian, and freethinker. He repudiated the authority of the Catholic Church and was immolated as a heretic in 1600. As quoted in the Chicago Record Herald, March 1, 1908, Addams characterized the Giordano Bruno Club as an anticlerical organization, not as an anarchist group: “Although the club is avowedly an anti-clerical organization, it removed its meeting from Hull House solely on the ground that it was a partisan political organization and should have a meeting room of its own . . . It was not at all because Hull House considered it an anarchist organization.” For additional commentary from Addams regarding the Giordano Bruno Club and its relationship to Hull- House, see Addams, Jane, Twenty Years at Hull-House (New York, 1910), 412–25Google Scholar.\n\n33 Mead was referring to a French law that was passed by the Chamber of Deputies on December 9, 1905. This law, which established secularism in France, was known as the “Law on the Separation of the Churches and State”; Guerlac, Othon, “The Separation of Church and State in France,” Political Science Quarterly 23 (June 1908): 273–80CrossRefGoogle Scholar. From 1835 to 1837, a set of decrees known as “The Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizabal” resulted in the seizure of monastic properties in Spain; Harrison, Joseph, An Economic History of Modern Spain (Manchester, UK, 1978), 26–30Google Scholar.\n\n39 Starting in the summer quarter of 1903, the University of Chicago formally acknowledged and honored the accomplishments of social settlements by scheduling public addresses regarding settlements during some portion of its academic year; Goodspeed, Thomas W., A History of the University of Chicago: The First Quarter-Century (Chicago, 1916), 399Google Scholar, 448. The first such occasion was designated “Settlement Day” in 1903 and featured public addresses by Jane Addams, cofounder of Hull-House, by Charles Zeublin, founder of the Northwestern University Settlement; and by Mary E. McDowell, head resident of the University of Chicago Settlement; University of Chicago, Annual Register (Chicago, 1904), 197Google Scholar. Mead was a featured speaker for two “Settlement Sundays,” one on October 27, 1907, and another on October 16, 1910; University of Chicago, Annual Register (Chicago, 1908), 198Google Scholar; University of Chicago, Annual Register (Chicago, 1911), 200Google Scholar.\n\n42 Mead suggested the forum of this public address when he noted “The time and place of this meeting is sufficient evidence of the close relation between the settlements and organized charity”; Mead, “Sympathy, Science, and Social Settlements,” folder 24, box 13, George Herbert Mead Papers, 1. In terms of dating Mead's address, it could not have occurred earlier than 1909 because Mead cited a study by Addams titled The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets that was first published in that year; Mead, “Sympathy, Science, and Social Settlements,” folder 24, box 13, George Herbert Mead Papers, 11.\n\n47 Mead, George Herbert, “The Child and Learning to Take the Role of the Other” in Play, School, and Society, ed. Deegan, Mary (New York, 1999), 83–84Google Scholar. As elaborated by Laura Westhoff, a primary consequence of Mead's linking sympathy to role-taking was “[c]ollapsing the divide between self and others, sympathy . . . offered a basis for understanding, inquiry, and knowledge.” Furthermore, sympathy provided “a starting point from which to mobilize political action to bring about material changes in the circumstances of others”; Westoff, Laura, A Fatal Drifting Apart: Democratic Social Knowledge and Chicago Reform (Columbus, 2007), 17Google Scholar."
