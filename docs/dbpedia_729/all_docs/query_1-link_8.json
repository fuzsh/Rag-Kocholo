Helen Rodriguez found a small hospital coping with 400 casualties while people outside the wailed for the dead. She was awarded the George medal for staying behind to save sick and badly wounded Indian soldiers abandon in the disorganise British retreat. She began by carrying a 12 stone man on her back to slit trench, returning for the rest of his companions one by one, over a 4-day period. Her decoration became known after being gazetted in London and they pulled her in for interrogation as a suspected spy whereby she was tortured.[2] 1942 Staff Nurse, Australian Army Nursing Service In recognition of conspicuous gallantry when her ship, Empire Star, was attacked by enemy aircraft during the evacuation of Singapore.[3][4] 1942 Police Constable, Bootle Police Force For rescuing people trapped in blitz-demolished houses - he also has the Kings Commendation for brave conduct in Civil Defence). 1941 Flying Officer, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve In February 1944 an aircraft, carrying a 500 pounds (230 kg) bomb and incendiaries, crashed near a Royal Air Force Station, and caught fire. Arthur, a gunnery instructor, attempted to rescue the crew despite the heat and exploding ammunition. He was joined by Flight Lieutenant Alfred George Spencer, the station medical officer. Arthur entered the burning aircraft no less than four times, but was eventually driven back by the heat and flames. Spencer stayed close at hand and searched the wreckage for possible survivors. It was not until the bombs were red hot and Spencer was certain that the crew must be dead from the heat that the officers abandoned their efforts. They then warned the fire party to withdraw and cleared the area just before the bomb exploded.[5] 1944 Lieutenant, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve First awarded in 1942, for his work as a clearance diver at Gibraltar. A bar to the GM was awarded for gallantry in 1944.[6] 1942[7]\n\n1945[8]\n\nCaptain, Church Army, Paddington In April 1941, after himself being victim in a London air raid, he continued to tunnel under wreckage to rescue other victims.[9] 1941 Flying Officer, Royal Canadian Air Force, No. 194 Squadron RAF On 14 June 1945, Baillie was the navigator of a Dakota which crashed and burst into flames near Mydngyan air strip in Central Burma.

Further mines were then struck and the fire spread to packed oil stacked aft. C.S.M. Billing took over control, and with great coolness and presence of mind organised the removal of ammunition and the evacuation of personnel to a tug. He himself rescued an officer who was lying on the deck of the ferry with a broken leg and also saved the life of a wounded sapper, who had fallen near the blazing petrol cans. The tug later also struck a mine and grounded but C.S.M. Billing eventually succeeded in getting all the injured personnel ashore, where medical attention was available. He showed courage, resource and leadership of a high order.\"[15][16] 1944 Deputy A.R.P. Post Warden, Westminster For showing outstanding courage during enemy air attacks and frequently risking his life to save others.

An adjacent wall was extremely unstable and liable to collapse, but Bradley and Playford refused to leave the trapped warden and Playford acted as human bridge as the wall collapsed on top of the damaged building with Bradley and Playford still inside. The warden was dug out alive; however, Bradley and Playford were severely injured. They were amongst the first recipients of the medal.[18] 1941 Surgeon Lieutenant – Commander Royal Navy ...for great bravery and devotion to duty in saving life...[19] 1942 Lieutenant, Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve In September 1940 Bridge was in charge of a bomb disposal squad at Devonport and carried out the demolition of a very dangerous bomb fitted with a delayed-action fuze. In May 1941 he disposed of a bomb which had fallen into the sluice valve chamber between two graving docks at Falmouth and failed to explode. He was the first military officer awarded a Bar to his GM.

However, the forepart of the vessel remained afloat for a short period, and Bridgeman, suffering from the effects of the explosion, and accompanied by a naval officer, descended to the hold to rescue the injured. In spite of warnings, Bridgeman continued his rescue work and, when this part of the vessel capsized and sank, he went under with the wreckage. He managed to get clear and was rescued later. The naval officer lost his life.[24] 1942 Lieutenant, Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve Britnell dived on a mine in Europa Hafen at Bremen which appeared to be a GC type. When it was eventually raised, the description was confirmed and it contained an acoustic unit. The water was approximately 30 feet at the time of the dive and visibility was nil. The mine was buried nose first in the mud. The primer proved very difficult to remove but on the sixth attempt using acoustic procedure Britnell finally extracted it. In addition, he also rendered safe three other mines during the operation, one GC type with acoustic unit, and two GD mines fitted with pressure and magnetic units.[25] 1945 ARP Heavy Rescue Service, Greenwich Whilst serving as a squad leader, Brittan rescued four persons, including a woman and two children, from a collapsed building. In the middle of this rescue he was himself trapped for five hours when the roof of the adjoining building also collapsed on him.[26] 1941 Junior Canteen Assistant, NAAFI, HMS Petard Brown and two others boarded the abandoned U-559 to retrieve materials and code books. The U-boat suddenly sank killing his two companions. It was later discovered that Brown had lied about his age in order to enlist and was only 16 years old, making him one of the youngest recipients of the medal.[27] 1942[28] Section Leader, Aston Home Guard During an air raid on 26 October 1940 Brunges and Patrol Leader Charles William Lovelace Tozer entered a basement air raid shelter which had been destroyed by a bomb. The shelter was rapidly filling with water from a broken main, and heavy bombs were falling in the vicinity, but Brunges and Tozer removed loose beams and debris with their bare hands until between fifteen and twenty people had been extricated, about half of them still alive. The two men only stopped when it was impossible to discover any further people.[29][30] 1941 Costermonger, Dalston The then-youngest recipient, he was just 15 in March 1941 when he helped in a rescue at a bombed and burning paint factory.

This was fitted with a Type 17 fuze, but the fuze pocket was damaged and it could not be removed. Whilst being lifted the fuze became active and ticking was heard, but it stopped. His bar was awarded for defusing a bomb that had two fuzes, a normal Type 50, but also a new delayed action Type 17A. This was possibly the first of these new fuzes to be discovered. Clinton took the decision to remove it for research.[38] 1942[39]\n\n1943[40]\n\nGroup Captain (temporary Air Commodore), Royal Australian Air Force On 7 September 1943, he was travelling as a passenger on a Catalina flying boat when it crashed at Townsville, Queensland.

The aircraft disintegrated on impact and immediately burst into flames. The rear gunner was injured and trapped in his crushed turret, being pinned down by the remains of the tail unit and the rear of the fuselage. A high explosive bomb was in the blazing wreckage some 10 yards away from the gunner. Flying Officer Dhenin, the station medical officer, and Corporal Lush, a gunner, hastened to the scene of the accident. Although fully aware that the heat might cause the bomb to detonate at any moment Flying Officer Dhenin worked for over half an hour to relieve the injured airman's pain and, assisted by Corporal Lush, endeavoured to release him. Their efforts to extricate the gunner were, however, unavailing. A mobile crane was brought to the scene and the mass of wreckage was lifted clear of the ground. Displaying complete disregard for his own safety, Flying Officer Dhenin then crawled under the wreckage and released the trapped airman thereby enabling others helpers to drag him to safety. Flying Officer Dhenin and Corporal Lush showed fine courage and determination in circumstances of great danger. 1944[52] Flight Sergeant, Royal Air Force Attempting to save his navigator from a crashed aircraft.

On the 19th he defused a bomb, which he thought had failed to arm itself as he was working he heard it arm. He was fortunate that he was able to remove the fuse and throw it away. Luckily, the gaine made of Bakelite was broken and stayed in the bomb, minimising the explosion. However he did suffer a few pieces of copper embedded in his hand.
