West African Frontier Force DCM See the colonial gazettes for the colonies of West Africa.\n\nRead The African DCM by J Arnold for more information. CO 445\n\nFootnotes: (1) Recommendations in AIR 2 are arranged by old Air Ministry file reference number, not name. Contact the Ministry of Defence who may be able to supply you with the file reference.\n\nBear in mind that medals issued by the British Army were not awarded exclusively to British Army soldiers – they could be awarded to personnel from the other armed services too. During the Second World War, for example, some members of the Royal Air Force received British Army awards. The same is true of the Royal Navy and RAF, so that, for example, a number of airmen of the Fleet Air Arm, a branch of the Royal Navy, received RAF awards.\n\n4. Foreign awards to Britons and British awards to foreign servicemen and women (from 1854)\n\n4.1 Announcements\n\nThese awards tend to be announced in the London Gazette under the heading ‘Foreign Orders’.\n\nFor draft versions of London Gazette announcements 1914-1928 browse WO 388 by reference. Some of these pre-publication announcements are annotated. The documents in this series (WO 388) are arranged by country. WO 388/6 to 15, including indexes in WO 388/8 to 15, are available to download online (you can download the indexes free of charge).\n\n4.2 Recommendations\n\nMilitary awards exchanged between British and foreign armies from 1946 onwards are searchable by name and award in the recommendations (WO 373) online. These can include those not appearing in the London Gazette.\n\n4.3 Lists\n\nYou can find some lists of Foreign Awards within FO 83 (before 1906) and FO 372 (after 1906). Locate files containing these lists using the Foreign Office correspondence indexes at The National Archives. It is thought that these lists are not comprehensive.\n\n5. Regulations and policy files (from 1854)\n\nIn general, you can search our catalogue by the medal name or its abbreviation to see if there are any policy files. There are some specific series which document the regulations governing the award of medals. They are:\n\nThe Army orders in series WO 123 and WO 293\n\nThe Fleet Orders in series ADM 182\n\nDefence Council Instructions in series DEFE 45 and DEFE 46\n\nSee also series AIR 72.\n\nFor policy files on medals, see series ADM 1 code 85, ADM 116 code 85, AIR 1, AIR 2, HO 45 code 30, MT 9 code 6, T 300 and T 333 and WO 32 code 50.\n\n6. The design and manufacture of medals (1805-1986)\n\nOrders for gallantry medals (especially in the 19th century) may be accompanied by details of recipients and of the action that led to the award. Try series MINT 16, MINT 20, MINT 24 and MINT 25. Search our catalogue with key words such as ‘awards’ or ‘decorations’.\n\n7. Replacing and claiming medals\n\nContact the Ministry of Defence for campaign and other medals issued after 1939. Medals issued before 1939 can no longer be replaced.\n\n8. Further reading and other resources\n\nOnline resources\n\nMajor military awards of the First World War, available from The Gazette website.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence’s British armed forces medals booklet, available from GOV.UK. Lists the medals awarded for service in the British armed forces, accompanied by an image for each medal.\n\nLists of Victoria Cross recipients announced in The Gazette for the First World War in 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1919.\n\nA list of Victoria Cross recipients announced in The Gazette during and after the Second World War\n\nBooks\n\nVisit the National Archives’ bookshop for a range of available publications about British military gallantry medals.
