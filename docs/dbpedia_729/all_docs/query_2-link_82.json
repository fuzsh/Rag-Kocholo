        "text": "Announcements made at the inaugural event included $20 million in philanthropic support for the Good Jobs Economy initiative, including for regions designated as Regional Tech Hubs under the Biden-Harris Administration’s landmark investment program.\n\nOn July 23, the Biden-Harris Administration announced a series of actions and commitments from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the private sector to enable the long-term, sustainable success of all designated Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs (Tech Hubs), NSF Regional Innovation Engines (NSF Engines) and their broader ecosystems.\n\nThese announcements were made at the inaugural Innovative Capital Summit, hosted by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Special Competitive Studies Project in partnership with EDA, NSF, and the Milken Institute. The event was held in Washington, D.C., and brought together stakeholders across industry, philanthropy, government and academia to help foster collaboration in regional technological development. The Summit was developed to help catalyze investment in American innovation and competitiveness by bringing together third-party capital providers and members of regional technology ecosystems from across the U.S. The participating ecosystems included Tech Hubs and NSF Engines. Each of these groups are focused on developing and supporting groundbreaking advancements in quantum computing, medicine, biotechnology, autonomy, semiconductors, energy, agriculture, aerospace, critical minerals, advanced materials or climate resilience.\n\n“If we want a truly national innovation ecosystem, we need to tap into the full potential of our country and expand beyond the typical metropolitan locations that have become overconcentrated. That was the driving idea behind our Tech Hubs program - to meet people where they are,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “We are investing in regional consortiums that will accelerate American competitiveness in the 21st century and ensure our leadership in the industries of the future, including biotech, quantum, autonomous systems, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing. But we can’t do it alone, which is why convenings like this are so critical to institutionalize the work we’re doing and continue investments in the Tech Hubs Program. This week’s announcements underscore what’s possible when we bring together our greatest assets and create bridges for opportunity.”\n\n“The NSF Engines and EDA's Tech Hubs constitute significant and transformational place-based science and technology investments by the federal government. These investments have planted the seeds of innovation, opening doors to opportunities across the nation and ensuring the U.S. leads in technologies that will define the future,” said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. \"NSF was thrilled to collaborate with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Economic Development Administration to connect capital providers to teams leading these innovation ecosystems. That is the catalyst we need to spark the private sector’s investment that will scale these innovation ecosystems and transform industries and communities across America.”\n\nAbout the Inaugural Innovative Capital Summit:\n\nThe first Innovative Capital Summit gathered some of the nation’s largest capital providers, including philanthropies, venture and growth capital, private equity and infrastructure funds, along with other organizations, with designated Tech Hubs and NSF Engines to elevate investment opportunities and facilitate complementary Federal and private sector investments as part of a series of engagements between communities and capital providers. The day-long Summit provided attendees the opportunity to hear from nearly 40 communities designated as Tech Hubs or NSF Engines about their plans for becoming globally competitive in critical and emerging technology commercialization in the next ten years. The inaugural Innovative Capital Summit will be followed by additional convening activities over the rest of the year.\n\nThe Summit resulted in a series of major announcements to spur continued investments in regions and technologies of the future.\n\nPhilanthropic and Private Sector Commitments to Tech Hubs: Participating U.S. companies, government agencies, and organizations announced several major commitments at the Summit, which include the following:\n\nNon-profit organization America Achieves announced its new Good Jobs Economy initiative working with local regions, including Tech Hubs, to advance and integrate strategies for economic growth and economic mobility by providing them with funding, a community of peers, and high-quality, tailored technical assistance.
