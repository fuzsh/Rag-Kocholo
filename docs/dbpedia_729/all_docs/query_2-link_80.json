        "text": "Webster University and University of Health Sciences & Pharmacy in St. Louis have created a program to accelerate the acceptance of Webster Biological Sciences students into the Doctor of Pharmacy program at St. Louis College of Pharmacy at UHSP.\n\nThe new pathway will allow Webster students in Biological Sciences to complete their Bachelor of Science undergraduate degree, while simultaneously starting the Doctor of Pharmacy, reducing the program time by one year and potentially saving students both time and money.\n\nSpecifications:*\n\nAt this time, UHSP will review and interview three Webster students per year.\n\nIn order to be accepted, students must complete specific courses at Webster University that are prerequisites for UHSPâ€™s Doctor of Pharmacy program.\n\nStudents must also have a 2.7 GPA or higher.\n\nStudents must complete an interview and submit a writing assignment for admission to UHSP.\n\n*At the current time, the program is open only to undergraduate students at the Webster Groves campus.\n\nBS Biological Sciences and Doctor of Pharmacy 3+4 Program\n\nWebster University offers a 3+4 program combining the BS Biological Sciences (90 hours) and the Doctor of Pharmacy (120 hours). Webster BS in Biological Sciences students who have successfully completed the required prerequisite courses and Global Citizenship Program requirements can apply to transition into the University of Health Sciences & Pharmacy.\n\nStudents who are selected for the 3+4 program will petition to graduate at the end of their fourth year and obtain a Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences. The University of Health Sciences & Pharmacy will accept prerequisite coursework from Webster University. Webster will accept a reverse transfer of up to 30 credits from University of Health Sciences & Pharmacy to be applied to upper-level BS in Biological Sciences requirements. Webster will waive the residency requirement for students participating in the 3+4 program.\n\nPlease note, students must complete a minimum of 90 hours at the undergraduate level. For example, a student could take 100 hours to complete their prerequisite courses and Global Citizenship Program requirements. In that case, the student would count 20 graduate hours toward their undergraduate degree.\n\nTo be eligible for the 3+4 program, students must:\n\nComplete the requirements of the first three years of the BS in Biological Sciences program with a minimum GPA of 2.7.\n\nComplete all the Webster University requirements associated with the Global Citizenship Program prior to entering the University of Health Sciences & Pharmacy.\n\nCheck with the Webster University Financial Aid Office when considering this degree option and prior to applying to the program.\n\nApply to University of Health Sciences & Pharmacy by Dec. 1 of the year prior to their anticipated fall semester start at UHSP.\n\nNOTE: Due to the volume of applicants, entry into the University of Health Sciences & Pharmacy is competitive. Consequently, it is possible an applicant will not be accepted into the 3+4 program even if they have met the requirements. However, this should not prevent a student from applying to UHSP following completion of their BS Biological Sciences degree.\n\nWebster students who are interested in pursuing the BS in Biological Sciences and the Doctor of Pharmacy program at St. Louis College of Pharmacy at UHSP should contact their academic advisor. Students will need to complete an Interest to Enroll and corresponding Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) release form .\n\nThe FERPA release authorizes Webster to share admissions, code of conduct and academic information concerning student enrollment and performance with UHSP. Both Webster and UHSP agree to use any information received under this section solely for the purposes of this agreement. Neither party shall further disclose such information, unless such disclosure is made consistent with FERPA. All information and correspondence pertaining to Webster students will be directed to UHSP's Office of Admissions at 314-446-8328 or admissions@uhsp.edu."
