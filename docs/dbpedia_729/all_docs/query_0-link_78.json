        "text": "§ The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill)\n\nThe object of giving medals, stars and ribbons is to give pride and pleasure to those who have deserved them. At the same time a distinction is something which everybody does not possess. If all have it it is of less value. There must, therefore, be heartburnings and disappointments on the border line. A medal glitters, but it also casts a shadow. The task of drawing up regulations for such awards is one which does not admit of a perfect solution. It is not possible to satisfy everybody without running the risk of satisfying nobody. All that is possible is to give the greatest satisfaction to the greatest number and to hurt the feelings of the fewest. But that is a most difficult task and it is easy to err on one side or the other. One must be careful in the first place to avoid profusion. The tendency to expand, shall I say inflate, dilute the currency through generous motives, is very strong. When the Order of the Golden Fleece was founded its first motto was \"I will have no other\" (\"autre n' aurai\"). But this proved too austere an ordinance for the Emperors, Kings and heroes concerned, and the motto was very rapidly changed to a much less self-denying and noncommittal form, \"I have accepted it\" (\"Je l'ai empris\").\n\nThe German distinctions have usually been very lavishly bestowed. When Voltaire was invited to visit the Prussian Court he stipulated that all expenses should be paid, and that the Order of Merit should be thrown in. Both were forthcoming. So there were, before 1914, as is well known, very many German medals and orders. Nevertheless, during the last war the Germans created about 80 different crosses, medals and decorations, including various kinds for the different Duchies and Principalities, and about 20 different distinctive badges of a similar character. At the start of the 873 last war the Iron Cross was a highly prized decoration, but by 1918 it had been granted so freely that it was little valued except, I believe, by Herr Hitler, who it is alleged gave it to himself some time later. After the Armistice, the Germans, who are a most adaptive people, manufactured large numbers of Iron Crosses for sale to the French troops as souvenirs. In the present war they have already some 15 new medals and 29 new distinctive badges. They have not yet reached the stage of manufacturing them for sale to the Allies.\n\nThe French, in the last war, were wiser than the Germans, but even they were inclined to err slightly too much on the side of generosity. When, after the termination of hostilities, they instituted a war medal for the troops, they got drawn beyond the line which limited it to the armed forces. It was granted, for instance, to hospital staffs generally, and then to the police, park keepers, Customs officers and so on. The result was that, very soon after the war, it was impossible to tell whether an individual had actually fought in the real fighting zones or not. And ten years later the French found it necessary —and this also gave pleasure—under the pressure of the ex-Service men to reopen the whole question and create a distinction called the Croix du Combattant.\n\nA similar process, though much more dignified, sedate and tardy, took place in this country after the Napoleonic wars, but it was not until 1851 that the services rendered between 1793 and 1814 by the veterans who still survived were recognised. Queen Victoria took a great interest in this, and the Duke of Richmond, who led the public agitation, was given by the grateful recipients of the long overdue awards, plate worth about 1,500 guineas. I hope that this example will encourage my hon. Friends in their zeal and activities in this matter, and that this hope may assuage any temporary dissatisfaction they may find in the announcements which I have to make.\n\nIt would have been very much easier to leave all this matter over on one side until more leisurely times have come. On the other hand, this war has now raged for 54 months. Many famous campaigns have been fought, several have been brought to a successful conclusion. Devoted, valiant service has been rendered in many parts of the world on land, on the 874 sea, in the air. Several million soldiers, sailors and airmen have been sent abroad, where they have remained for long periods, enduring severe hardships, rendering faithful service and achieving splendid results. They greatly value the distinction which a ribbon gives them.\n\nI know of the satisfaction which has been given to our battalions of troops which have been authorised to mount the Africa Ribbon or the 1939–43 Ribbon, and I felt myself bound to try to attempt at any rate a partial solution of the problem which I could submit to His Majesty, with whom these matters rest, subject to advice. Accordingly, the Commitee on the Grant of Honours, on which all Services are represented, was directed in March last year to frame Regulations governing the grant of the Africa Star—this was to commemorate the expulsion of the enemy from the African continent—and also the 1939–43 Star, with a different ribbon, covering service in other theatres of war, including, of course, the oceans and the air. The Africa Star has already been awarded to 1,500,000 officers and men, and the latter decoration, the 1939–43 Star, to 1,600,000 officers and men, a total of 3,100,000 of our warriors in all spheres; and with the other cases that are now under consideration I am told the two ribbons together may ultimately cover nearly 4,000,000 men.\n\nIn considering the qualifications for the grant of the 1939–43 Star the question arose of what period of service would be required. There are some forms of service which are measured by time and others by the episode itself. We have adopted both conditions. Six months is taken as the qualifying period of time, but in special operations in which individual combatants would not have the opportunity of serving six months actual presence with the Forces will be sufficient. Naturally, in drawing up a list of such episodes it was necessary to consult the Dominion and Indian Governments. The final list is now complete and will be made public immediately. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Air, who will deal with any points which are raised in the Debate, will, if he thinks fit and the House desires it, be in a position to read out the list as we have so far devised it. It had been hoped that it would be published two days ago, but I am perhaps to blame for having somewhat delayed its publication. Additions can be 875 made to this list in accordance with well-informed opinion. I am very anxious that Service opinion should fix and focus on these different points, and that we can profit by it as we get to hear of it, so that one can make submissions to the Crown in respect of these matters, for this is a Royal Prerogative.\n\nI hope that even in its present form the list may meet some of the many questions which are asked about this episodic aspect of the qualifications for the 1939–43 Star. Among the Naval Forces who served for a long time afloat and ashore in the Mediterranean, and played a vital part in the victories there by cutting off the German reinforcements, there has been, I am told, a discernible preference shown for the Africa Star as against the 1939–43 Star, and the suggestion has been made that an officer or man whose service qualifies him for either award should be permitted to choose one or the other. I am advised that such an option would be very difficult to work. It might also seem to reflect upon the 1939–43 Star if people who, on account of local associations, chose the Africa Ribbon instead of the general service ribbon, which must be considered as the primary, the senior ribbon. I am still studying this question. The same kind of question occurs again in the case of those who served both in the First and Eighth Armies, where there is an emblem. I have not finally closed the discussion of this difficult problem. I would like to see, in all these subjects, how opinion shapes. One thing is clear, however, that no one can have both stars or both ribbons, nor can they have both the two emblems, x and 8. To this last rule there is one exception. His Majesty has approved of both the Emblems I and 8 being mounted on the ribbons of General Eisenhower and General Alexander, these being the only two officers who did, in fact, command the whole of the First and Eighth Armies.\n\nI ought not to overlook two other forms of reward of merit which have been approved. First, there is the King's Badge, about which a discussion was promised. The issue of the King's Badge is at present restricted to those invalided from the naval, military and air forces and the Merchant Navy and fishing fleets through wounds or war disablement attributable to service since 3rd September, 876 1939. The question has arisen, Should it not be extended to those discharged through disability not due to service? Against this, as the House will see, it may be urged that a considerable number of those eager to join the Fighting Forces have to be rejected on medical grounds, and it would be argued that those whose disabilities escape notice until after they had been enlisted ought not to have an advantage over those who are rejected at the outset. Under National Service all men and women in this country are doing the work which renders best service to our nation.\n\nAll forms of faithful service are honourable, but we do not propose at present to extend the King's Badge beyond those whose disabilities are attributable to their service. The matter must, however, be considered in conjunction with chevrons, about which I will say a word in a minute or two. The only ex-soldiers who will not be able shortly to wear any token of their service will be those who have not qualified for either the Africa Star or the 1939–43 Star and who were discharged for non-attributable reasons with less than one year's war-time service, and these may be eligible in due course for any awards which may be granted later in respect of military service, such as a general medal. But only those I have specified, who do not qualify for either of the stars or who were discharged for non-attributable reasons and who have less than one year's service, will not have some record of their connection with our Armed Forces, be it by chevrons or some other form.\n\nEven greater complications would arise if men and women invalided from the Civil Defence general services, including the National Fire Service, were made eligible for the badge. There is no fixed minimum medical standard for discharge, and there are those who have been discharged on account of reductions. I can, however, announce to-day that the official chevrons for war service are to be extended to certain further Civil Defence organisations, including the Rest Centre, the Emergency Food (including the Queen's Messenger Convoy Service), the Canteen, the Emergency Information and the Mortuary Services, which have been up to the present excluded. We are also on the point of expanding the chevron 877 scheme so that some 227,000 additional members of the Women's Voluntary Services engaged in Civil Defence will also be eligible.\n\nAt this point I must explain that medals are struck at the end of wars and stars are given for particular episodes or periods during their course. I must also explain that the manufacture of medals or stars cannot possibly be undertaken during the war and therefore all that we can do is to issue ribbons.\n\nApart from the right to wear particular ribbons certain emblems have been approved under conditions which have been set forth in the White Paper. These emblems are a very highly-prized feature of these awards. There are the Arabic numerals 1 and 8 for service in the First and Eighth Armies, which played the main part in liberating North Africa and which are valid from the period of the Battle of El Alamein in October—.perhaps, I am not sure, from the final repulse of Rommel in the month before, I may be in error as to which. They served from that period to the complete surrender or destruction of all the German and Italian forces, upwards of 300,000 prisoners being taken, in Tunis in May. There is also the Silver Rose, which is worn as a special emlblem for the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, with the 1939–43 Ribbon. Those emblems, of which there can only be a few, can be worn on their respective ribbons. They are undoubtedly a super-distinction and are intended to be so. It will not be physically possible to add to them indefinitely, because there is no more room on the little slip of ribbon for a multiplicity of emblems without producing a confused impression.\n\nThe question of clasps, or bars as they are sometimes called—in my opinion miscalled—on medal ribbons will not come up till after the war. Then, when all the events can be seen in their true perspective and proportion, it must be carefully considered. After the last war a large number of clasps were provisionally approved, but it was found impossible to make a general issue of them on account of the great number earned by individuals and of the vast number of persons whose claims had to be examined. This would have entailed enormous staffs at a time when, among many difficulties, the need for economy was considered to be important. I do not 878 know what will happen after this war, when, of course, we are all going to be so rich, or we hope so. The clasps can only be worn on the long ribbon—the long length of ribbon which carries a medal or a star. There is no room for them on the ordinary narrow strips of ribbon which are all we have to give at the present time. However, this whole matter will be most attentively studied, bearing in mind, of course, that a clasp for a spectacular action may connote less sacrifice and endurance and daring than long service in the submarines, or in a series of bombing sorties, or hard service in the front line, or in going to-and-fro across the oceans for months and years on end.\n\nThere is another general principle which I will venture to commend to the House. It is always easy in these matters to widen the Regulation and to admit a new class. On the other hand, it is never possible to go back and take away what has been given unless it has been given in error. There is no need for us to take any final negative decision at the present time. I thought this Debate would be one for consultation, for sensing the feelings of the country through its best exponent, the House of Commons, rather than for the arbitrary laying down of final awards. It is, however, necessary, while not taking negative decisions, to take every step with great caution and to examine carefully the consequences of other classes besides those newly benefiting.\n\nThe most difficult border line case is, of course, the anti-aircraft battery, and especially the Dover coastal batteries, which are constantly engaged with the enemy's artillery across the Straits. I have been most anxious to include these batteries in the 1939–43 ribbon. Up to the present I have found no way of doing so without opening the door, successively, first to the whole of the Ack-ack Command and, secondly, to the searchlights and predictors of all kinds, without which the guns cannot fire or cannot hit, and whose personnel were and still often are, in equal danger to that of the gunners. In the next place you would immediately come to the National Fire Service, whose casualties have been at a much heavier rate than the ack-ack batteries. And, then, what about the Police, who stood around and kept order and rendered every assistance? And what about the A.R.P. and the fireguards so often in danger and dis- 879 charging their work with so much efficiency as we can see even from our recent minor experiences? If the National Fire Service and others like them were included, how could the whole Regular Army which stood in Great Britain be excluded, or the Dominion Forces which performed here a vital strategic role? If the Regular Army were included, why should not the Home Guards be eligible, who did their work without pay at the end of long days, who wore their uniforms and played an essential part in hurling back the danger of invasion from our shores? There remain a number of other categories such as the training and maintenance personnel of the R.A.F., the bomb disposal squads, which is, with the ack-ack batteries, one of the balancing cases. In many cases personal decorations have been won on a large scale by that heroic band of men, but, at the same time, I am admitting quite frankly the difficulties which these cases have created—the difficulty of denying and the difficulty of opening the door almost to a very vast extent.\n\nIf we were to take the whole course I have indicated and open the door to class after class, as I have shown you would be asked to do and bound to do, think, in logic, this would involve throwing the 1939–43 Star and Ribbon open to an additional 12,000,000 persons and by doing this I am sure you would take away much of the distinction now attaching to the decoration. It would become so common as to be very nearly universal. I am sure the soldier, the sailor and the airman returning from prolonged active service abroad and wearing the Africa or 1939–43 Star would feel bewildered when he saw all around him 12,000,000, mostly adult, males who had not left the island but had got the same ribbon too.\n\n§ Lieut.-Colonel Wise\n\nI do not want to go into a deep discussion. Of course, the 51st Division qualified for this decoration, in any case, and so also did the troops who took part in actions on the Maginot Line—nearly all of them, though there may be odd ones here and there. But I cannot relate the issue of the Star to cover individual cases. I was very pleased when my hon. and gallant Friend opposite said a word or two for the Iceland force. Whether or not it is possible to include them in this distribution I do not know, but it is nice to think that, on the whole, they were not forgotten. I am not trying to gain the Star for myself, because, as recently indicated by the Secretary of State for Air, I get it anyhow. I am putting forward an altruistic case for a force in whicn I had the great honour to serve for two full years. This force, I think, deserves consideration, if not for the 1939–43 Star, at least for special consideration after the war. As my hon. and gallant Friend said, they endured the fairly severe climatic conditions of Iceland. The ordinary strength of wind in the winter runs from about 90 miles an hour, sometimes rising to 126. Life on the edge of the Arctic Circle in a Nissen hut can be quite uncomfortable, and this force did, I think, deserve well of the country. They earned the respect and affection of a population not at all willing to see them when they first got there, though it is worth recalling the tribute paid by one of their leading politicians to our Forces there—that it was practically a unique example in history of an occupying army which was better liked on the day of its departure than on the day of its arrival.\n\nI feel that there is a case for some consideration for this force, which I think played a very important strategic part in the war. Had we not occupied Iceland, we might have lost the Battle of the Atlantic. If we had lost the Battle of the Atlantic, no heroism on the part of Britons would have been of any value whatever. If we are to have a distribution of these medals by merit, or on the importance of the part played in the war, I consider that this force should have greater recognition. I am not at all sure that the importance of the task carried out in the war or the danger incurred by any particular body 890 of troops is a good criterion for the issue of a medal. A campaign medal or star is a definite commemoration of the fact, not that you were in danger or that you were heroic, but that you were in a particular operation at a particular time. Once the operation is fixed which shall receive that decoration, it is no reflection on any soldier if he has not a medal for that particular operation, for it is not his fault if he was not there. But it is a pleasing memento for the soldier who is lucky enough to be ordered to that theatre of war.\n\nI now come to the effort to extend the distribution too widely, and I will try to anticipate some of the arguments which may be used later on. I noticed that when the Prime Minister was pointing out the enormous distribution which would be necessary if any qualification were adopted to cover some of the soldiers who fought their battles at home, a large portion of the House seemed not only to agree that this vast expansion would be necessary, but that it would also be desirable, and with that I cannot find myself in agreement. It is true, to take one example, that the Anti-Aircraft Command played a vital part in the destruction of the German attack upon this country and that without their services we would probably not be here to-day. It is true, also, that they suffered casualties in so doing and that they manned their guns and their searchlights under arduous and difficult conditions and played their full part in the Battle of Britain. But so, as the Prime Minister pointed out, did the whole the National Fire Service, the Civil Defence, including those in areas where no aeroplane of the Luftwaffe ever flew, who were playing their part there not because of their desire, but because that is where they were told to play it. Once we began all that sort of thing there was no reason, as the Prime Minister said, why everybody in this country should not receive the same medal, but that is not the point in the distribution of medals. If it is merely an ideal that all should share alike, let us scrap the idea of medals and say that the production of a national registration identity card should be counted as the same thing.\n\nI would like to reinforce once again my plea to the Government to remember that they have gone far enough in extending the scope of this decoration. An impres- 891 sive list of actions was read out by the Secretary of State for Air, and some of them, particularly those which took place in the far North, were singularly free from any serious battle. I hope that the scope of this decoration will not be further extended, and that my hon. Friends who want an extension will be content to await the general war medal, which will, obviously, have to be issued at some time to all who fought—either at the end of the war or just after it, but issued with, I trust, rather more celerity than the Peninsula Medal to which the Prime Minister referred.\n\n§ Major Peto (Birmingham, King's Norton)\n\nI am grateful for having been able to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, on this occasion because it is rare indeed that I emerge, like a deep-sea fish, from the murky depths of the indistinguished back benchers to break surface in a Debate in this House Our nervous systems are, of course, adjusted to great pressure from above, and when we do rise to the surface, as I do now, we are apt to burst—probably with pride or owing to the reduction of pressure. I hasten to assure the House that this phenomenon will not be long delayed and that when it has occurred I shall sink back again to the murky depths, leaving, I have no doubt, the surface as untroubled as before. I have recently been in contact with troops in my own constituency and I hope that you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, will not feel that I am touching an exposed nerve when I say that I realise that they are more interested in pay and allowances than decorations, although it would be quite out of place to elaborate that now. With regard to stars and medals I would like to say that if this Debate—which is a reconsideration of the whole matter—is to produce any result, it must be a reconsideration on a purely common-sense scale, because common sense demands that action, involving the risk of death against the enemy, should be recognised by some kind of decoration. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has clearly indicated to us that he has not closed his mind in any way either to the distribution of the Stars, or 899 even on the question of some special kind of decoration which may be in the form of a star or medal. That, no doubt, will be adjusted and will cover the 12,000,000 people whom my right hon. Friend mentioned and who are strongly eligible for some kind of recognition of their amazing gallantry.\n\nI was delighted that one of the points I wished to bring forward was removed from me by the Secretary of State for Air, when he said that the Norway campaign was to be recognised. It was not a great campaign in the history of our race, but that cannot be put down to the courage of those who fought it. However, the less said about that the better. I think we must make a distinction between collective and individual decoration. It is clear that the individual must be treated with the utmost possible parsimony but a collective decoration could, I think, be approached on a very generous scale. I do not want to see after the war several hundreds of thousands, perhaps even 1,000,000, rather disgruntled ex-soldiers going around our little clubs and pubs with a grievance. I was particularly interested in what my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North-West Hull (Sir. L. Ward) said on the subject of those Who had had the very good fortune to have an easy time in Cairo. I hope my right hon. Friend has also noted that point, because these people have had little more to bear than those who served in Cairo in peace-time. Let us, therefore, avoid forming, through our awards, 1,000,000 grievances. That is more important than depreciating the currency; grievances will last far longer than depreciation. If you are going to err then err on the generous side.\n\nI want to mention a point which has not yet been raised. We have had much about the Home Guard and I am absolutely in agreement with the Prime Minister when he said how much they deserved recognition. But there is one section which does outstandingly deserve special recognition—and I emphasise the word \"special.\" They are the bomb disposal units of the Home Guard. I ask the House to realise the kind of steel-hard, cold, logical, courage that is required to dig into the depths where an unexploded bomb lies, to listen to its ticking and then apply the tools of one's trade in sitting astride it, emasculating it and rendering it harm- 900 less. These civilians in uniform—I am sure they will forgive me if I call them that—do most important war work as well as their Home Guard duty. I have a bomb disposal unit in my own constituency which I have very much in mind to-day. They have suffered fatal casualties and wounds. Everyone of them has had the loathsome and nerve-racking task of rendering unexploded bombs harmless, and they are immensely proud of the skill which they have shown. I, too, am immensely proud of them for their courage. I want to, put in a plea that they should have some outstanding recognition and should be allowed, at least, to participate in the 1939–43 medal award. I do not believe that that would be depreciating the currency. I do not believe that if these people were allowed this distinction it would necessarily mean that everybody in the country should have a decoration too. It does not follow as a logical sequence.\n\nI would have like to have put in a plea for those who fought the Battle of Britain along the East and. South-East coasts. They were almost a training corps. I was there and in my command I had not a soldier, except a few \"old sweats\"—if the House will forgive the expression—who had had as much as three months' service. They dug and manned their positions by day and night. We were bombed, shelled and machine gunned, and if that part of Britain was not an operational theatre, I do not know what an operational theatre is. I realise that in saying so I go contrary to my right hon. Friend's attitude that it would be depreciating the currency. Therefore, I do not press that claim, particularly as I myself took part in it. Nevertheless, I would be glad to see it pressed by someone else. I would like to conclude by emphasising the fact that collective decorations are very different from individual decorations, and I very much hope that the House and the Prime Minister will take the view that there is less danger in being generous than there is in \"depreciating the currency.\"\n\n§ Commander Agnew (Camborne)\n\nThe fact that the Prime Minister has accorded this Debate to-day is evidence of the very generous spirit in which-he has met the House and the country in throwing open to review the conditions of the award of these Stars.\n\n901 I think it is evidence also that the Prime Minister, as head of the Committee on the Grant of Honours and Decorations—[An HON. MEMBER: \"No.\"]—At any rate, my right hon. Friend is closely associated with that Committee which, I think, is not altogether satisfied that the original conditions of award were the right conditions. Indeed, in previous wars, and certainly in the last war, the grant of the Star—in the case of the Army it was the 1914 Star and in the case of the Navy it was the 1914–15 Star—was not accompanied, so far as I recollect, by any particular heart-burnings or differences of opinion at a later date as to whether the award ought to have been wider than, in fact, it was. I think the reason for that was that the period for the award of these two Stars was a very short one. They were, in fact, awarded to cover the services of those in the Navy and Army—the Royal Air Force did not then exist—who, at the beginning of hostilities and during the two early years of that war, bore the brunt of the fray and did most of the fighting while great new Armies and an expanding Navy were being trained.\n\nIn this war, however, the Stars have been awarded, so far, on an entirely different basis. I do not know whether it is too optimistic to suggest that the Star that covers a period of service from the beginning of the war up to the end of 1943 is, in fact, covering a very great part of the length of the war itself. I may be too optimistic, but I do not think I am. In the case of the Africa Star that was awarded in the same way as, I think, Stars such as the old Khedival Star was awarded in Egypt when a particular campaign, victorious in its conclusion, was thus commemorated. It was certainly appropriate that the utter rout, defeat and ejection of the Italian and German Armies from North Africa should have been marked by a grant of a decoration of that kind. Having decided on that, the Government found themselves in something of a difficulty because they realised that the other two Services, the Navy and the Air Force, would go altogether unrewarded. They dealt with the Mediterranean theatre first and said that any naval or Air Force personnel who were closely identified with the North African campaign ashore should have the Africa Star itself. With regard to the Navy and the Air Force they then introduced a new Star which was not purely 902 to commemorate a particular campaign but was altogether out of its class. It was really a general service award, covering a long period of time. It is true that in order to meet in advance any possible disappointment that the other two Services might have, that they would have no particular rosette or clasp to pin on to their ribbons during war-time, that the award of a rosette was provided for that portion of the Navy only which was working in the Mediterranean within the limited dates prescribed for the award of the Africa Star.\n\nI think the limit of these dates in the case of the Navy does mean a rather artificial restriction. There have been campaigns and battles and naval service all over the world, quite unrelated to the last victorious phase of the military African campaign, which have been just as important to the Navy and to the people of our country as that period under review. I do not want to run the risk of making any suggestions which would convert the distinction on a uniform into part of the uniform itself, which would have a wholly futile result. I would instance the first battle of Narvik fought under the leadership of the late Captain Warburton Lee, V.C., where almost the whole flotilla was finally sunk but paved the way to the much easier task of the second battle of Narvik, where I happened to be present and realised what jolly good work had been done before to make our task an easy one. Such contests as that should be reviewed once again, to see whether a rosette could not be more widely awarded.\n\nThe suggestion has been made that fighter pilots should have a special rosette to be added to their 1939–43 Ribbons. Surely a way ought to be found, after the Prime Minister has put all our thoughts into words in his classic phrase about the work they did, to record that visibly on their ribbons so that that small band of individuals, as they now are, can be distinguished in that way. Then, too, I want to join with those who have put in a word for the bomb disposal squads. That is work of the most cold-blooded heroism. I should imagine that you have to write yourself off before you do it. You must not think of yourself from beginning to end of it. I hope something will be done for them. There is the practical difficulty that the time 903 for the 1939–43 Star ended in 1943. On the other hand, bomb disposal is, at any rate for some time to come, a continuing necessity at intervals. It may be that these gallant people, not very large in number, would not fall to be dealt with in that way but that is for the Government to decide.\n\nIt was a wise suggestion by the Prime Minister that there should not be a wholesale widening of the 1939–43 Star. Once you do that you will take away all the value of it, if you give it literally to everyone. It might be better to give a special new award to those enormous numbers of people in the various forms of national service who up to now have no visible ribbon to sew on their tunics or coats. I should deprecate, in any award that is made, anything in the nature of a Battle of Britain Star being awarded to any effectives of the Armed Farces because, if it is given to them, they will think it is some lesser form of Star that ranks very much lower in prestige than the 1939–43 Star. Therefore, any award that you give to members of the Armed Forces must, to my mind, be in the form of extensions of the 1939–43 Star. To some extent the pitch is queered. If we were considering the matter from the beginning, before anything had been awarded at all, we might possibly come to other conclusions. The 1939–43 Star is a visible recognition of those who have taken part in fighting in the period concerned and, if we are to give an award, as I think we ought to do, to very numerous other classes of people, such as Civil Defence workers, it ought to be a different award altogether and confined to them. When I have in mind such an award, I want to put it on record that those of us who have been in air raids, both under conditions of serving in the Armed Forces and also in our ordinary capacity as citizens of this city, getting a gun and shooting back with it is a far more pleasant occupation than sitting in a shelter at your A.R.P. station in some building ashore. It is a far more pleasant proposition to bring down fighting aircraft. Therefore, any award to civil workers should be one which we, as fighting men, would envy them for having and would prize very highly and, if it is once given to them, it will not be an award of less prestige.\n\n§ Major McCallum (Argyll)\n\nI would like to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Devonport (Mr. Hore-Belisha) and my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for East Toxteth (Major Buchan-Hepburn) in the point they made about Britain being considered an operational theatre; but, first, I would like to take up another point made by my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. C. Wood) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Devonport, on the feeling that has been expressed by a number of men in the Army over the discrimination shown in the award of the Africa Star. As my right hon. Friend pointed out so clearly, the operations that took place prior to October, 1942, led, in a great way, to the possibility of the subsequent operations, and the men who fought in them surely fought under conditions far more unfavourable than those of what is known as the Eighth Army of the final advance, with far less equipment. There were battles fought by well-known regiments, which were annihilated. It is true that anyone who survived those campaigns may wear the ribbon of the Africa Star, but their friends who succeeded them, and who are able to put up on their ribbon an \"8,\" have an advantage which I do not think ought ever to have been allowed.\n\nNow I would like to come to this question of Britain as an operational theatre. I think that all the Members who have spoken have been inclined to think of this question of medals and decorations from the point of view of the past, when we sent armies overseas to fight in various campaigns. This war, surely, is entirely different. If, between the fall of France in June, 1940, and June, 1941, Britain was not an operational theatre, I wonder what an operational theatre is. It was an operational theatre suffering far greater 922 risks and perils than anything that has been suffered in the Middle East. All those members of the Services who had to be stationed in this country during that period are just as worthy of the 1939–43 Star as those who were abroad. I would mention one small example concerning the Africa Star, which was brought to my notice the other day by a rather cynical friend of mine in the Army. A number of officers had to come home the other day for certain duties. They came from the Mediterranean. Some were wearing the Africa Star ribbon. While they were here an incident, as I think it is called, took place, a bomb landing in a certain area where military men are inclined to foregather. Next day a number of the men turned up, bandaged, as casualties. My cynical friend, as he took his seat, said that they had had to come to London to earn their Africa Star. That feeling is very rife in the Services, in this country. On the other hand, I deprecate what some Members have said about the staff officers who were sitting in Cairo. Perhaps I feel it rather personally, because I was one of those staff officers. I assure hon. Members that those officers also have to get about and to go up to the front, running many of the same dangers as the troops. At any rate, they did so when the fighting was in the Western Desert; I am not going to talk about what they do now.\n\nI feel that we are inclined to run away from the importance of the services rendered in this country, and the hardships and the dangers which were suffered. I was very glad to hear what my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said about considering some measure of recognition for civilians. If anybody deserves recognition in this country, it is the civilians, and the civilians of London particularly. I refer not only to the National Fire Service and the A.R.P. services, but to such people as the bus drivers, the taxi drivers, and, still more, the train crews. I remember one night in December, 1940, when there was pandemonium at Euston, during one of the heaviest raids we had. A train was drawn out of Euston at not more than two miles an hour, and we got to Watford without one jerk or jolt, although there were bombs falling around all the time, and incendiaries were falling on the permanent way. That, surely, required great courage and coolness on the part of the driver. Why should not 923 all those transport workers and other civilians have some form of recognition? I do not think it is possible for them to share, nor do I think that the thousands of citizens of London, Coventry, Bristol, Liverpool, or the Clyde, would want to share, in the military decorations, but I hope that, when the end of the war comes, the Committee which is being set up will be able to think of some form of recognition for the wonderful service rendered by the civilian population. Perhaps it is fitting that a plea of that sort should come from a Service man, one from the far North, where we have not had the dangers and tribulations to undergo which London and the other cities in the South and East of England suffered.\n\nThere is a danger of our forgetting that this city, this country, was, and is, the centre, from the Allied side, of this great war. Moscow, Washington, and all the other places are very important, but this city is the centre of it. It staggered me the other day when a great friend of mine, a most gallant and very senior officer, who served in the Mediterranean, rather commiserated with me when I met him here at home, because here was I sitting in this honourable House, having given up my military appointment in the Middle East. He thought I had lost a lot of interest. I said that I had been very thrilled to have been a Member of this House, and to have lived in London during those hours so ably described by the Prime Minister as the time when this country was the front line. [An HON. MEMBER: \"It was the only line in the world.\"] When I said that I felt proud of being in the centre of things, he had rather a shock.\n\nThat anyone should have thought that this was the centre, and the Middle East was not the centre, seemed to him a strange idea. I feel that that sentiment has rather permeated through certain branches of the Services abroad; I would say, in conclusion, that the greatest consideration should be given to the Forces that have been in this country, particularly those who were here in that very important year, 1940–1941, and that, in due course, the wonderful deeds of endurance, and the behaviour of the whole of the civilian population, should not be forgotten.\n\n§ Petty Officer Alan Herbert (Oxford University)\n\nI intervene in this Debate with some embarrassment and reluctance, for the reasons expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Palmer). I intervene on behalf of a very small body of men—the minesweeping and patrol services, and especially the minesweepers, who serve in the River Thames, the Port of London, from Southend to Teddington—to put it bluntly, the minesweepers which, among others, not forgetting the gallant staff of the Port of London Authority, kept open the Port of London in 1940–41. When I read the White Paper it seemed to me that the people there were well covered by the words six months' service afloat in areas of active operations. I am sorry to say that the Admiralty seem to have whittled down the White Paper. At any rate, these men, who have served three years, or indeed in some cases nearly four years, are not to receive this decoration. I think that I understand why that is. It is because there is great ignorance about the River Thames. Many people believe that it is bounded on the west by Maidenhead and on the east by Blackfriars Bridge, and I do not know many Admirals who have been past Black-friars Bridge yet. The Admiralty describe this mighty river, the river Thames, sixty miles of which come under the Flag Officer in Charge, London, five miles wide at the other end, as \"sheltered waters.\"\n\nI had rather an unseemly but delightful argument with an Admiral outside just now. I asked the Admiral from what were those vessels \"sheltered\"? They are not sheltered against bombs above, or against mines below, and during the material times, these vessels were patrolling at night ready to repel invasion by land, by air, and indeed, by water. So that what they were sheltered against we do not know. I have been specially desired by the officers and men of these forces to inform their Lordships, and to inform all sea-going Admirals and civil servants at the Admiralty, that the explosion of a 929 bomb or mine off Gravesend is likely to cause as much discomfort as the explosion of a bomb or mine off Dover. Furthermore, that death by drowning off Southend is as disagreeable to the individual and disquieting to his relatives as death by drowning at Scapa Flow, and even if in that case death is caused by suicide from boredom or through falling off a battleship revolving gracefully round a buoy. Though these men are in \"sheltered waters,\" all time served in the river counts as sea time for promotion; and yet, for this decoration, it is not sea time, but \"sheltered water\" or \"harbour\" service. I am proud indeed to wear the King's uniform, and that is enough for me; but I must say I was a little surprised to be told, after serving five winters on these waters, night and day, that all that time I have never been technically \"afloat.\" I suggest that we have been, as the Civil Service might say, substantially afloat. That is the first point.\n\nThe second point I have to establish is that this service has been of an \"operational\" character, and I do not think that that is very difficult. The operation in which these services took part was not the Battle of Britain, which lasted for two months, but the Battle of the Thames, which lasted for 12 months. I remember that four days before the war an eminent statesman, who has risen to a position of even greater eminence since then, said to me in the precincts of this House, \"Of course we shall have to abandon the Thames.\" And that was the view held on many occasions by many stout-hearted men at later periods. Well, we did not abandon the Thames. Why? Because the Navy, led by the gallant Admiral Boyle, and later Admiral Dunbar-Nasmith and all his officers and men, kept the port open. That was the operation which, I think, entitled these men to the decoration.\n\nThe enemy started dropping mines into the river and lower reaches, three months before they ever attacked London, and they continued for many months afterwards. What happened? The port would be closed. The ships tied up, and the tugs and civilian craft—yes, in these \"sheltered waters\"—because it was too dangerous to move. Out came the minesweepers, and by one means or another destroyed the mines, and so the traffic of the river continued. That, I suggest, is 930 an operation. To show how anomalous is the situation, I could take hon. Members of this House in To minutes to a minesweeper which, in the early days, was operating in the lower reaches and blew up, or destroyed, three mines. The commander, a petty officer, was given a distinguished service medal, and therefore automatically receives the 1939–43 Star. But members of his crew, who were with him all the time, are now told that they are not operational but only doing \"harbour service\" in \"sheltered waters.\" It is ridiculous. I hate to say these things, as I have never raised a public word against the Admiralty since I have been serving. I put this in through Service channels and had a word with an Admiral, without any success, this morning, and I am therefore reduced to this unwelcome method of approach.\n\nMay I further add that these vessels have been provided by the Admiralty with lethal weapons. I do not know why, because, whenever they are used, there is violent protest from the naval authorities. Only a few days ago I was ticked off for ordering my gunner to fire at some flares; and I might entertain the House by an account of what I call the Battle of Lambeth Bridge, where a certain vessel on 10th September, 1940, thought fit to fire some hundreds of rounds at enemy planes which were flying rather low. That caused the most violent protest too. However unprovoked and untimely that assault upon the enemy may have been, I must say that the gunners did think at the time that their behaviour was of a vaguely operational nature, however unwelcome it was to the naval authorities.\n\nThat is all I have to say. These men have seen their Headquarter ship sunk by bombs, they have seen some of their companions killed and wounded, they have used their weapons against the enemy, they have steamed thousands of miles through dangerous waters, they have destroyed enemy mines and, in short, they did keep the Port of London open when even that great man, to whom I have referred, did not expect it to be done. They do not ask for much, these men. They are not receiving civilian pay, they do not get time and a half on Saturdays, or double time on Sundays. All they now ask is that they should be able to show something to their women-folk, and their children, to suggest that their 931 service in the great war was not without merit, and not without recognition from their country.\n\n§ Mr. Turton (Thirsk and Malton)\n\nI think it is a fact that medals are, to a great extent, unimportant until there comes a feeling amongst those who do not receive them that there is injustice. The only reason why this Debate is being held is that throughout the Services there has been a great deal of mystification as to why one man gets a medal and the other does not. The first point I want to stress is that mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Devonport (Mr. Hore-Belisha), that the basis for medals should be equality in distribution. Now what have we got here? The Prime Minister, in the very witty speech he gave us on the history of medals, did not tell us that in the intervening months since the Orders have been issued, the White Paper has been changed. As the result of a declaration by the Secretary of State for Air we now know that for the Africa Star the qualifying period will still be one day in Africa; for the Army, in certain campaigns, it will be one day in that campaign; for the rest of the Army, it will be six months; for the Navy it will be six months' service; for the Air Force it will be two months' service, if they were an air crew, six months for a non-air crew. I suggest to the House and to the country that that is not equality in distribution. It is quite wrong that some men should have to serve merely one day to get this medal and other men should have to serve six months. I hope that the Government, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Air will think again on this matter and devise a system that will provide equality in distribution.\n\nThe point I should like to make is that the mistake we have made has been over this Africa Star. I say this, although it affects me more than anybody because that is the only campaign medal I have. The Africa Star has been the cause of all the trouble. Why only one day in Africa to qualify for the Africa Star? The troops who get it are not pleased that some men, after service of one day, find themselves with a medal and others who served in a campaign or in Africa for two or three years have got the same medal. May I tell the House that there was a certain Division which fought throughout the campaign in Africa, and when they had 932 finished just before Tunis, they were sent back to the base into the Canal area for certain future operations. When they got back to the base, and were re-equipping for those future operations, this Division, which had suffered casualties in the previous couple of years, were given a Brigade fresh from home to make them complete, and for two days that Division had this extra Brigade fresh from home and re-equipped. After that they were no longer in the Middle East Force. When these medals came out, the difference between them was ignored and the same Africa Star was given to the Brigade which had only been two days in the Canal area in a very quiet spot, I suppose more than 1,000 miles from any fighting.\n\nNow is it right that you should have a system whereby the same medal is given to the men who fought through the glorious campaigns of Lord Wavell, General Alexander and General Montgomery as to those who have been just a couple of days in the base? I ask the Government to make the qualification for any of these campaign medals continuous service throughout the campaign. What we are really trying to acknowledge is the fact that a man has taken continuous part during a certain well-known campaign. For that purpose, no doubt, you could split up the service. First of all, the time when Lord Wavell stopped the Italians from breaking through to Sidi Barrani, then the time he swept forward to Benghazi, then to the defenders of Tobruk and the campaign at Gazala, and, finally, General Alexander's victory at El Alamein and what followed. But let us try to see that the medal denotes that a man has taken part in a certain operation.\n\nFor that reason I must say that, although I actually served at Cairo myself for four months, and the Prime Minister has been to Cairo more than once, I cannot understand why he has selected Cairo and the Canal Zane, the Delta of Egypt, as an operational command from the period of June, 1940, to May 12th, 1943. Actually I was there for the latter part of it and I never saw any operations of this nature in Cairo, and I hope it will be reconsidered. I notice that when the War Office laid their White Paper and when the Secretary of State for War brought out his Army instruction on medals, he said he was 933 giving them but that he could take them away afterwards. I hope he, too, will reconsider whether, in his view, the Army in the Canal Zone and in Cairo should be regarded as armies in operational command qualifying for the Africa Star. There is a perfectly clear line, as anybody knows who has been to Egypt and has taken part in the fighting, which should determine that. That is the road from Cairo to Alexandria. One side is yellow and the other side in green. The yellow side is where the fighting took place, and the side where it is green is where we had the flesh pots of Egypt. I am sure all those who have taken part in the Middle Eastern campaign would be satisfied if we had a new boundary line to the Africa Star.\n\nThere is one other difficulty. If we had the 1939–1943 Star for certain campaigns and the Africa Star for the campaigns in Africa, why is there no form of distinction for those who have taken part in both? You see a man wearing the Africa Star and you may think that he was one day with General Montgomery. But in fact he may have fought right through France, might have been to Norway and have gone out to Africa and have served three years in the campaign there. Is it not just that such a man should be distinguished so that you could tell that he had had the good fortune to take part in so many campaigns? This affects some three divisions in the British Army who had that experience and I think it is wrong that they, and other men outside that formation who fought at Dunkirk, El Alamein and Mareth; should not be given the two medals. The Prime Minister said, with a wave of his arm, that we could not have two medals or emblems. I would like to know why? After all, medals are to advertise the fact that a man has been in a campaign and they are an incentive to the morale of the men who will take part in future campaigns. Too many have talked in the House to-day as if medals were to be regarded as prizes at school prize-givings. The only reason why I attach any importance to medals is because they are an incentive to those who will take part in future fighting and who will know that there will be a system of award and acknowledgment for what they do.\n\nPresumably, the men who have fought in Sicily and Italy will get a Star. I hope that the Secretary of State for Air will 934 deal with this point. Are the men who have fought in France or in Africa, or in Sicily or Italy, to be debarred from that further Star? It is no secret, even to the Germans, that we contemplate operations in France at a reasonably early date. Presumably, when those operations are concluded, there will be a Star for those who have taken part in what some people, quite wrongly, call the second front. Are those who fought in France, Africa and Italy to be debarred from receiving that Star when it is awarded. I suggest that these are serious questions to which it is time the Government paid due attention. When the Prime Minister said that we could not have two medals does he intend to carry out that rule right to the end of the war? If so, it will cause a great deal of heartburning among the Forces.\n\nI would like to turn to the question of the emblems—which the White Paper calls \"clasps.\" I am in some difficulty as I understood that it was the accepted principle of the Prime Minister and the Government that you should have a Star to denote a campaign and an emblem to denote participation in a specially meritorious action in that campaign. That is the reason why those who took part in the fighting with the Eighth Army should have the figure \"8\" as an emblem to show that they took part in that fighting. To-day, the Prime Minister said suggestions had been made to him that there should be a system of clasps but he said that you do not give clasps until the end of the war. If that is so, then somebody had better rewrite the White Paper. The White Paper said that there shall be clasps to the Africa Star. The symbol \"Eighth Army,\" I should have thought, would denote that you had fought under the command of the Eighth Army. If I remember aright, the date when the Eighth Army was formed, and from which it fought continuously, was September, 1941. For some peculiar reason the Prime Minister has, selected 23rd October, 1942, as the date. What is to happen to the men who fought and were wounded when fighting in the desert with the Eighth Army? It is a remarkable thing that a man like General Gott, who founded the Eighth Army, should not be entitled, if he had lived, to a medal to commemorate the great doings of the Eighth Army. With all due deference to the Prime Minister, I would ask that in this matter he should clearly think again. The desert Forces 935 which were under Lord Wavell should be distinguished, just as any other meritorious action should be distinguished, by a symbol—whether it is by a Roman or Arabic figure I do not mind. Why not have a \"W\" for Wavell as the symbol? When you get the Eighth Army, a picked body of men, who regard themselves with pride and distinction, do not separate them from those who were fighting with General Ritchie on one day and then with General Montgomery or somebody else on the next. We are not giving our emblems to show our appreciation of distinguished generals. I fear that that is one of the dangers we are likely to fall for unless we provide this plan.\n\nI think the system of emblems is a very good one. I cannot see why, if you give a clasp to the Eighth Army, you should not give a clasp to the man who torpedoes a German battleship, to a man who fought in some of the grimmest campaigns in the Eritrean fighting. If we could have a clasp for those people the value of these clasps would be realised. But as they are to-day they are very ill-advised. I gathered that the few fighter pilots who have survived the Battle of Britain will not have any clasp to show that they have taken part in a meritorious action. All I can say to the Secretary of State for Air about that is that I am very much surprised.\n\nNow we come to the question of those who fought in the operations in Britain. I gather that the Prime Minister has excluded Britain from an operational command. Well, if the 1939–43 Star is to mean what its name implies I should have thought that those who took part in resisting the German invasion here, whether they were doing it on A.A. gun sites, in searchlight units, balloon units, bomb disposal units or manning the beaches, during which they were frequently blown up by mines, were in an operational command. If the Prime Minister finds that that will be making the 1939–43 Star too common, there seems to me to be room for a new medal.\n\nHere I part company with my hon. Friends who have spoken. I should not have thought that a special Battle of Britain medal was needed. I should have thought we had room for a new medal for continuous service, and that men in all the Services who have borne the burden 936 and heat of the war for four years should get it. I should call that the 1939–43 Star and I should give this other medal some other name, showing certain selected campaigns which the Secretary of State for Air read out. I think that is the right thing. Look at the men who spent many years in India, taking a very active part in the war and suffering the privation of separation from this country and undergoing hardships and dangers. I think they should receive the medal equally. And what about the men in Palestine? Those who were engaged in the Canal area are being rewarded by the Africa Star, but the men who were in Cyprus and Palestine firing anti-aircraft guns are having no medal at all. Therefore I think there is room to-day for a four years' service medal for these men who have taken an active part in the offensive and defensive campaign of Britain, and I hope the right hon. Baronet will reconsider these matters. The White Paper deals with mention in despatches. In the old days to my knowledge the oak leaf was always placed on the medal ribbon. For some reason the Prime Minister and the Committee of Honours have suggested that it should be put off the ribbon and on to the tunic. I would ask him to consider how very untidy it looks. I hope we shall get back to what it should be and that, when an officer or other rank has a ribbon and is mentioned in despatches, the oak leaf will be placed on the ribbon. However, that is a very minor point.\n\nWhat I should like to stress is that from all over the world I, and I think others, have had Service men and women writing to us asking why some of them are treated unequally compared with the rest. I have had letters from Malta, from East and West Africa and from the Middle East and there is wide resentment at the inequalities in the White Paper. I hope the Government will repair this error. I would ask the Secretary of State to report what we have said to the Prime Minister. I ask that these matters should be re-considered at a very early date because what we are trying to do is to encourage the men who are going to take part in the hazards of the next few weeks and months, and delays in making changes in the White Paper will damage the morale of the Services.\n\n§ Lieut. - Commander Joynson - Hicks (Chichester)\n\nI am glad to have an 937 opportunity of following my hon. Friend, because I agree with a great deal of what he has said and I think he could have carried his argument a little further. I should like the Secretary of State for Air to clear up one small point which has caused a great deal of heartburn. It is whether or not there will be included in those who qualify for the 1939–43 Star those members of the Pioneer Battalion serving in France in the early days of the war. Certainly a great many of them have been under the impression that they do not qualify for the Star and do not receive any recognition whatever for their services. But they certainly served in an operational theatre—France—for some time and when the débâcle came, whether or not they were classified as being in an operational unit, their actions were most definitely operational and were very valuable indeed in resisting the enemy's advance. They fought well, they fought like tigers and there can be no conceivable reason in justice why they should not receive the same campaign award as members of the Regular Army in that area.\n\nI should like to suggest that we are regarding the basic question in this Debate from rather too close an angle. We are rather looking at it from the point of view of the immediate present effect of these awards. It is not an immediate matter at all. The people who are really going to appreciate these awards will not appreciate them so much during the war as after the war. It is not a question that matters now, when everyone is fully cognisant of what is being done in the war. The time when the awards are really valued and looked up to and when they are pointed out as a record of achievement fulfilled and duty done is after the war. The important point to remember in that connection is that it is the old soldier and his wife and family who, when the war is over, regard with honour not the ribbon but the Star itself and its clasps. Traditionally the clasp runs through the whole history of the question of medals. That is after the war, it is not the ribbon that is worn whenever decorations are worn in peacetime, it is the medal with ribbons and clasps. So long as the war lasts it is the ribbon only that is worn but in the long years after the war it is the Star and the clasps that matter. I therefore venture 938 to think that we are taking somewhat too short sighted a view of the matter.\n\nOn the question of clasps, the Prime Minister indicated that the matter was still open and that it would receive consideration, but I do not think we could have gained any very happy prospect or any optimistic idea as to the result which that consideration would achieve, particularly having regard to its history after the last war, to which the Prime Minister referred. If that matter can be considered with a greater degree of sympathy it will solve the whole problem. There is no reason that I can see why there should be difficulty in awarding clasps. The Secretary of State for Air has to-day given us a list of the special campaign areas which will entitle members of the Services to the Star. That list will equally entitle them to a clasp for the areas concerned. If we had the principle admitted that it is the clasp which is the valuable, honourable and memorable part of the medal, as is the traditional custom of the Services—and there has been a clasp issued to only 11 people—we need not worry about the scope of the actual Star itself. We are all anxious not to dilute or render cheap any award which may be given, but I venture to think that when for these two awards the recipients will approximate 4,000,000, we need not be unduly anxious about extending the number by a few hundred thousands. Let us remember that if we extend the number of Star recipients we are not extending the number of recipients of the clasp, which is infinitely more valuable. If we adopt that line I suggest that all difficulties will be solved.\n\nI whole-heartedly concur in the suggestion that there should be some special recognition for those men who fought as fighter pilots in the Battle of Britain. There is no reason why the 1939–43 Star, if it is made available to the operational area of the United Kingdom, should not be given to these men. Their special recognition would be a clasp, and I would give them a gold clasp to commemorate their special achievement. It has been mentioned to-day that clasps might become too numerous, but I suggest that there is a way out of that difficulty. Clasps could be amalgamated, for instance, for the North African campaign. If we want to award a clasp for the three different campaigns in North Africa, plus 939 Crete, plus Greece, we could award a comprehensive bronze clasp and overcome the difficulty in that way. There is no limit to the alternatives if this old and traditional system is adopted. I hope that even at this late stage the Secretary of State will indicate that his particular line will be put before the Committee again for consideration in a favourable manner.\n\n§ Lieutenant-Colonel Thornton-Kemsley (Aberdeen and Kincardine, Western)\n\nIf this Debate has demonstrated one thing more clearly than any other, it is that it is quite impossible to please everybody over the qualifications for the award of the 1939–43 Star. The arguments for and against awarding it for services when Britain was a besieged island, under constant enemy attack, are, as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer would say, fairly evenly and nicely balanced. I think there are three possible courses. The first is that we should exclude all home front claims, as is proposed, being content, possibly, at a later time, to recognise these by the award of a general service medal. That course has the disadvantage, as has been pointed out by speaker after speaker to-day, that home front personnel, who lived dangerously and served faithfully in the defence of Britain in 1940 and 1941, will be left out in the cold. That is a pity, because they are men and women who have deserved well of their country. Secondly, there is the possibility of extending the award to selected home front personnel. It would be a difficult course administratively, and, I think, anomalous in practice. All sorts of people would have to be considered: the infantry who stood to on the coast, bomb-disposal companies, fire-fighting personnel in the Navy and in the Army in heavily-blitzed ports, the ground staffs at operational aerodromes, and so on. If you are going to adopt this course—which I do not believe to be practicable—you will have to set a disproportionately large number of people, for an unwarrantably long time, examining individual claims, checking records of ser- 949 vice, and inquiring into the location of units during the operative time.\n\nThe third course is one which has been advocated by more than one Member to-day, that is, to recognise the Home Command during the Battle of Britain period as an operational command for the purposes of this award, so that service in home stations and in the home commands during the period which was mentioned, 1st August, 1940, to 1st June, 1941, should qualify for the award of the 1939–43 Star. I think there are four factors which this House would do well to bear in mind in considering this matter. The first is that the qualifications for the award should be easily understood. The second is that claims should be capable of being upheld without the necessity of employing a large staff of invigilators. The third is that the award should leave as few people as possible nursing a sense of grievance. Lastly, because the majority of the recipients will be in uniform for the remainder of the war, the tendency should be to overdo rather than to underdo the distribution.\n\nJudged by these standards, I am bound to say that the third alternative, the proposal to regard home commands as operational commands during the Battle of Britain period, seems to me to go furthest to meet these four factors. Although I have no very strong feelings about this matter, I would be inclined myself to recommend it for this reason. I do not think it would do any harm to extend the award to the greater number of people who would be brought into its scope, and it would do a surprising amount to make a lot of people proud and happy. It is astonishing how much a little thing—and I agree with the hon. and gallant Member for Nottingham East (Lieut.-Colonel Gluckstein), who made this point—how much a little thing like a medal ribbon does to stimulate morale. The greater the number of our men who are wearing them when they go over the other side, the better for their self-respect and the greater the respect in which they will be held by others whom they will meet. But, if it is decided to adopt this course, then I think we should certainly advocate the institution of a system of clasps, and the holding of clasps should be denoted by the right to wear the single rose emblem on the ribbon, so that a necessary distinction 950 should be made to recognise those who have served in operations overseas.\n\nI want to support what my hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) said about the double award. There are, as he has pointed out, a great number of individuals and some formations, such as that fine north country division, the 50th, and elements of the Highland 51st, who, but for the terms of Army Council Instruction 32 of 1944, would be entitled to wear both the Africa Star and the 1939–43 Star, and I think that, because a man has earned the right to wear two medals, to prevent him from doing so is to impose bad luck which we ought to do everything possible to avoid. If it is said that it might operate to the disadvantage of certain naval and Air Force personnel who may have performed equally meritorious service in theatres of war away from the Mediterraneann zone, then I would say \"Let them, if necessary, wear two rose emblems.\" But, however that may be, I have a feeling that objections of this kind ought not to be allowed to stand in the way of the simple and straightforward principle that a man who has qualified to wear two medals should be allowed to wear them both.\n\nI want to support what was said by the right hon. Member for Devonport (Mr. Hore-Belisha) about the clasps or emblem on the Africa Star. I confess to a feeling of misgiving at the wisdom of limiting the award of the Eighth Army emblem to what is, in effect the period of General Montgomery's command, brilliantly successful though that has been. Under the command of Field Marshal Wavell, and in the days of Generals Auchinleck, Cunningham and Ritchie, the Eighth Army performed prodigies of valour with far fewer resources in men and materials. Why should the earlier campaigns of the Eighth Army be overlooked? A great many hon. Members will remember hearing an address given upstairs to the British Parliamentary Association just before Christmas by Brigadier Hargest, that fine New Zealand soldier, just after his escape from captivity; they will remember the praise he gave to General Auchinleck's command, and his description of General Auchinleck, one of the finest soldiers under whom he had ever had the privilege of serving, fighting his battles, as General Wavell had fought his, \"with insufficient troops, with inadequate weapons, without 951 air cover, and with every disadvantage that could face a British general.\" These men, who fought against great odds, with the dice loaded against them, were men of the Eighth Army, and this House would do them less than justice if it were not to advocate a course which would recognise them as such.\n\nTo round the thing off properly do let us suggest the award of an emblem for that daring and brilliant campaign in which General Sir Alan Cunningham's tiny force, operating in a country which favoured the defence, won what is called in a fine book published to-day by the Ministry of Information about the Eighth Army, the first really irrevocable victory of the war by routing an Army of 300,000 and clearing the Italians out of East Africa. If the proposals which I have named, modest, easily understandable and easy to implement as they are, were carried into effect they would do much to overcome the feeling, which does exist, that our own men are apt to be outdone in these matters by their comrades of the Allied Forces.\n\n§ Major Conant (Bewdley)\n\nI have listened to most of the speeches, and I think there is only one way in which we can avoid causing a very great deal of dissatisfaction; that is by the simple method of giving a medal to everyone. Unfortunately, such a course would cause extraordinarily little satisfaction and in view of the decisions recorded in the White Paper, it would in fact be impracticable. We have therefore to proceed on that basis laid down in the White Paper, with which I, personally, am in general agreement, though I can see the need for extension on a limited scale in various directions.\n\nI think we have got to recognise that campaign medals must be awarded as a memento to the person who has taken part in a particular campaign, irrespective of his personal danger. In my view they are not awarded as an incentive, because they are usually awarded after the event, and I do not think it is much use tying a carrot on to the donkey's tail, but they are a valuable recognition to the wearer and a memento of something that has happened. Their value to him depends very largely upon their rarity, and I think it is essential that we should keep that point continually 955 before us and not allow too great an expansion of each medal. Personally, I would prefer to see the issue of a large number of campaign medals to comparatively small and selected numbers of people. In that case I believe they would cause greater satisfaction to their wearers. If you issue them on a wider scale a medal becomes like a button and the man who is not wearing it is improperly dressed.\n\nI am not attracted by the idea of clasps, except in the case of a long and continuous campaign which can be divided up into phases, as in the case of Africa, and I think there you should give distinctive clasps for each phase of that campaign, not only the Eighth Army operations after El Alamein and the fighting in Tunisia but also for General Wavell's advance and for the fighting in Abyssinia. In this war, unlike the last war, we have taken part in many operations against the enemy such as commando raids which cannot be classified into a single campaign, and the 1939–43 Star is designed to recognise all those different operations by one award. It certainly is not a precedent, but it is unusual to give medals for evacuations, that is for unsuccessful operations; but if one is doing that I think it is essential that you should give that medal to those who made the evacuation possible, that is the rearguard who were left behind and who were probably taken prisoner. That is certainly not recorded in the White Paper, although the award to people who were evacuated is recorded. I think, therefore, that extension must be made in that direction.\n\nNow I come to the far mare disputed point of this country. Obviously Great Britain in this war has been a theatre of operations. It is difficult to decide between the relative value of the services of a man who has served in Italy or in Sicily or in Norway as compared with the man who has served here, and without in any way detracting from the value of the service of Anti-Aircraft Command I think that those who served abroad in operations against the enemy need to be recognised in a different fashion. If that is the view of the House, then I think any suggestion of extending the 1939–43 Star to cover people who served in this country must be wiped out. The clear 956 answer, to my mind, is the award of a separate and distinct medal for the campaign which took place in this country.\n\nThe question then arises, To whom should that new campaign medal for service in Great Britain be awarded? Obviously, Anti-Aircraft Command must come in, but it cannot be given to them alone. At the time of the Battle of Britain the greater part of our Army was here, and a very large number of them were actually shooting at German aeroplanes. You cannot give a medal to the person who was shooting with one kind of gun and deny it to the man who was shooting with another kind of gun. I suggest in all seriousness that a separate medal should be given for home service to all those who served at home and who have not qualified for any of the overseas campaign medals. On that scale it would not include too many people. I think also there must be a medal granted for Civil Defence. We have the precedent of the Merchant Service and there should be a separate medal for Civil Defence, with the possible inclusion of the Home Guard, a point, however, which requires further consideration.\n\nSeveral hon. Members have mentioned bomb disposal units, and I feel they need special recognition. I would suggest that they are recognised in this way. I do not think it is sufficient to include them in an extension of the 1939–43 Star. Many such units, of course, served abroad and I think I am right in saying that bomb disposal is performed by other units than bomb disposal units. However, I think the bomb disposal unit should be entitled to wear the appropriate campaign medal according to whether they have served in Great Britain or in a foreign theatre of operations, and, in addition should receive a separate decoration denoting that they have served in a bomb disposal unit. That would be in addition to any gallantry decorations which they individually might have earned. I do not pretend that this outline would avoid anomalies but it would I think reduce the anomalies to a considerable extent and I feel that it would preserve to some extent the value of these medals to those who receive them.\n\n§ Lieut.-Colonel Sir Thomas Moore (Ayr Burghs)\n\nBefore the few remarks I propose making in this Debate, which will be on a very narrow issue, I would like to 957 record my disagreement with two views expressed, one by my right hon. Friend the Member for Devonport (Mr. Hore-Belisha) and one by an hon. and gallant Gentleman on the other side. The first statement was that the medal ribbons should not be given until the end of the war, that soldiers did not want, in his opinion, to wear their medals particularly now. I think that is totally wrong, particularly as we know that some of our Allies are somewhat lavish in their issue of medals, and it has been a very sore point with a number of our soldiers who have seen far more fighting than some of our Allies and have still nothing whatsoever to show for it. The second point was that danger should not be regarded as a factor in awarding a decoration or medal or star to those engaged in the defence of this country. But the point seems to me to be this, that danger means the starting of fire, the starting of bombing, and immediately that takes place the civilian population who are not actively engaged in the defence of Britain are sent to their shelters—to their Morrisons or Andersons or Tubes—and during the same period the A.A., the A.R.P., and the Home Guard come into active work. The bus men, of course, have always to be on the job, and so have the railwaymen. All these, therefore, come under a period of extreme danger, and I think that should be regarded as one of the factors which should guide the Government in allotting the 1939–43 Star.\n\nThat, however, is not really the point of my few remarks. It may appear to the House—and I do not want to apologise if it does so appear—and to those who have endured the miracle or tragedy of Dunkirk, to those who have fought their way through blinding snowstorms and sandstorms, and to those who have stumbled through the swamps of the jungle, all the time putting up an epic fight against overwhelming odds—it may appear presumptuous that I should raise my voice for one great citizen force that has only been casually mentioned both by the Prime Minister and by one other hon. Member to-day. I would not presume to do so, nor would the Home Guard wish me to do so, if this Star were to be limited to those people I have just described, that is the fighting men.\n\nBut it is not so limited. It is to be granted to those who have served in certain operational areas, arbitrarily selected, 958 I suppose, by the Service Departments or the Government. So we find these anachronisms whereby a clerk who has constantly wielded his pen in a cushy seat in Cairo during the years of our greatness and, similarly, a clerk who has safely manipulated the stores at some base depot, or an administrative staff officer who has never seen a shot fired in anger, and is never likely to see one, will gain this Star for gallantry and endurance. It is because of that lack of restraint in awarding the Star that the Home Guard feel compelled not to stake their own claim but to state their claim. We merely ask, as has been asked by several Members to-day who have brought adequate proof of the argument, that Great Britain be declared one of the privileged operational areas or commands from May, 1940, to May, 1941, when Britain, undoubtedly, was the chief target of the enemy.\n\nOur reasons are that the heavy bomber is now generally recognised as the modern type of heavy artillery. Britain, and more especially, certain specific parts of Britain, were subjected daily and nightly to air attacks during 1940 and 1941. During that time, after a day's exhausting work on war production, men rallied nightly to the defence of the country. They reported night after night in their hundreds and thousands without having had time to wash or eat so that they might not be found wanting when the urgent demands of the night came. They played their part, as many will acknowledge, in fire fighting, rescue work, and in practically every form of Civil Defence while bombs, masonry and wreckage were falling all around. Many hon. Members will, I know, bear me out in that in regard to the London area and some of our large cities. There is one more point I would like to make: We have read of many decorations being awarded for saving life under fire in the field. I could quote many cases of life-saving by Home Guards while bombs were raining down. I know of many units in London who have had fatal casualties while doing rescue work during actual raids and have secured several decorations for that work. That very factor establishes their right to some form of star or medal in regard to the operational performances which they have been through.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to assure the House that I myself know that 959 millions of pounds' worth of property have been salvaged and countless lives have been saved by these Home Guards, who have been working hard at their jobs during the day. I feel sure that I have established a right to ask that the Prime Minister should not close that open ear of his to this little song I have sung to-day and that he will regard the Home Guard, as he himself implied, as part of the operational forces of this country. If it should not be found possible to award this coveted 1939–43 Star there might be a Battle of Britain Star for all those great forces which played their part in the defence of the country or the 1939–43 Star might be divided into two—one for the Services and one for the civilians, with a slightly different ribbon. I do ask the Secretary of State for Air to bear my remarks in mind, and to think of the 1,500,000 to 1,750,000 Home Guards who have willingly given all their time, energy and courage, such as it is, to the defence of our country.\n\n§ Mr. Bartle Bull (Enfield)\n\nI understand from my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Stockport (Wing-Commander Hulbert) that there is a tradition in the House that if one has an interest to declare one should declare it. But if I have any interest to declare I will not declare it. I think the Prime Minister said words to the effect that he would pay attention to the Debate which was to take place in the House of Commons to-day, and if in any way I say the same thing or repeat what some other hon. Members have said, I will, I think, do it a little more briefly than a great number of them have done. The first thing I would like to mention is the question of the Africa Star, the Bar or whatever you care to call it—sinister, I think the people who were there before Alamein would call it. The Arabic 8 written on the Star is, apparently, given 968 only to those who have been there since the Battle of El Alamein. That is to say it only goes to those who have been there and in Italy since Alamein. We know we never got better tanks and guns than the Germans had before El Alamein. We got up to their level but never beyond. The Bar goes to those who came after Alamein and not to those who were there before Alamein when the going was even harder than it was later.\n\nIf those people who have served in the desert and Egypt since the Battle of Alamein get this Arabic \"8\" on their chest, which certainly they are entitled to, the soldiers who were there before Alamein should, in my humble submission, get \"8\" squared on the ribbon they have to wear. If you are to give the \"8\" on this ribbon to those who were there after Alamein, what about all those who were left wounded and prisoners in enemy hands before Alamein? The Eighth Army of the days when they had nothing to attack with do not get the \"8\" on their Ribbon, though I think they are entitled to it as much as those who have been there since Alamein. The fault was most certainly never that of the troops. It was only a question of material and armour. If you were to say that victory, from Alamein on, was due to the generals, let us take whichever general you care to choose and give him another badge on his cap. By all means do that. No one would question it. But do not deprive the troops, the fighting soldiers and junior officers, of that to which they are, in my opinion, justly entitled.\n\nI do not think it has been suggested in this Debate to-day—and I have sat through it more or less—that the Africa Star should be given, for example, to some Greeks who fought extremely well in the Western Desert throughout that campaign. I think it would be a great courtesy on our part and no more than what is due. I would also mention that I was once in Tobruk with the Polish Carpathian Brigade, which consisted of two battalions of Polish troops and one battalion of Czechs. They were in the salient, the most dangerous place. There were no finer troops in the desert than the Polish Carpathian Brigade. I wonder if we could not give the Africa Star to the Greeks who have been in the desert and to these Polish troops and to the Free French whom we came through at Mekili when we 969 were retreating from Benghazi? Then they went to the left of the line at Bir-Hakim. They were called then the Free French. I suggest we might give this Africa Star to the Greeks, the Poles, the Czechs and the Free French who came to fight with us in Egypt or Libya irrespective of any political views they held. Some had walked hundreds of miles in order to rejoin their Army groups.\n\nWe have had a lot of discussion about anti-aircraft batteries, and so on. I was not hi England at the time, and I am not qualified to judge the merits of this question. But I think that, in the case of a soldier who has not served abroad, while it would be a good thing to let him have a ribbon, it would not be right to give him the same ribbon as a soldier who has been in battle abroad. I think that the anti-aircraft gunner was often a great deal better off than the civilian population of London, or the people in the constituency which I have the honour to represent. He has his dug-out, and he is reasonably well looked after. If he is wounded, he is taken off to hospital. That is a very different thing from what happens to a man who is wounded in a foreign campaign. If he is attacking, he is picked up by his own troops; but if he is retreating, he is in the bag. If a man is wounded at home, he can be visited, and kissed by his wife; but, believe me, that really does not often happen in the desert. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Devonport (Mr. Hore-Belisha) referred to the fact that one day in Africa was enough to qualify for the Africa Star. There were inquiries as to why one day in Africa should be enough to qualify. I would like to assure the right hon. Member—although he probably knows—that, in my opinion, one day in Africa is more than enough. There were some questions as to why service in Palestine should not qualify. The answer is that there are many more flies in Egypt than there are in Palestine.\n\nThe fact is that our, troops are improperly paid and they do not get enough medals. I do not think it would harm our relations with our Allies, if our troops had one-third, one-half, or three-quarters of the pay and medals which the troops of some of our Allies get. After all, we did weigh-in at the beginning of the war, and I do not think there would be any repercussions abroad if we gave up to half of 970 the medals that some of our Allies give their troops. I mean no disrespect to any of our Allies, but I do not think that they would object if we had a few medals as well. The Prime Minister mentioned that if he, or his Government, were in office after the war, there would probably be a General Service Medal at the end of hostilities. It is a very nice thing for one's family to have flowers sent to them after one is dead—perhaps they are glad to get rid of one—but it is also a nice thing, as the Americans say, to have a bouquet sent to one when one is still alive. Therefore, I would suggest that the General Service Medal should be given out to the British troops now, or after six months' or a year's service, and a different ribbon for any campaign for which you think they ought to have one. In spite of any apparent frivolity, I hope I have made a few reasonable observations. Even if that is not so may I say that perhaps the easiest way would be to give a medal to everyone just because they are still alive?\n\n§ Mr. Molson (The High Peak)\n\nThe Prime Minister undertook that he would keep an open mind and would be prepared to consider any suggestions made in this Debate in the light of what he described as advice given by informed opinion. The suggestion was made that the 1939–43 Star should be distributed on rather generous lines and that it should be differentiated by clasps. As has been pointed out, it cannot be said to be impossible to issue clasps in war-time, because that principle has already been conceded in the White Paper. It has also been pointed out that, while everyone recognises the great and gallant achievements of the First and Eighth Armies in their victorious campaign, it is very important that we should not forget the equally gallant efforts of those who, at an earlier stage in the war, and with lesser resources and supplies, carried out very brilliant operations. I hope that, as a result of this Debate, my right hon. Friend will consider the desirability of extending a special recognition by means of a clasp to those early pioneers in Africa who, in East Africa, Abyssinia and Eritrea, won one of the most brilliant strategical and tactical victories that have ever been won. If I specially draw attention to that, I am sure I shall not be accused of in any way under-estimating the great achievements of the First and Eighth Armies and the great campaigns that brought the war in North Africa to a conclusion. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North Portsmouth (Sir W. James), who originally proposed to the Government that the distribution of the Star should be upon a generous scale and that clasps should be issued in order that soldiers, sailors or airmen who had taken part in special campaigns or actions could obtain a recognition to mark their participation, based himself on historical precedent in the case of the Navy. I hope that, in 978 spite of the purely practical difficulty to which the Prime Minister referred to-day, of differentiating the services that had been rendered on a small ribbon, it will not be regarded as ruling out the possibility of giving widespread recognition to those serving men who have gone wherever they have been told to go or have stayed at home and have thereby done what they were told to do, and at the same time giving special recognition for special campaigns, battles and particular exploits.\n\nWhat is the basis upon which these Stars are being issued? There are a number of different criteria that might be taken. It might be the criterion of danger, or that of hardship, or that of tedium, or that of distance from home. I am afraid that in the White Paper the old idea that no Englishman ever went to war unless he went overseas has had a good deal of influence. I hope that the Prime Minister will not fall into what I think is a logical error. In my battalion, for the first nine months of the war, we had an adjutant who was a fighter pilot at the end of the last war. He was then based on Hornchurch, and it was his responsibility to try and defend London against aerial attack. In those days night fighting was much more dangerous than it has been in this war from a technical point of view. There were not the technical aids that there have been since, and at the time when he went up from Hornchurch he did take his life in his hands. When he went to war for a second time, in this war, he had no medal to mark that he had been a night fighter pilot in the last war. I hope that an injustice of that kind will not be repeated in this war.\n\nThe criterion in the White Paper is logical; it is not that of danger, tedium or distance from home. It is that of combat and serving in an operational command. I admit my personal interest in this matter. I want to summarise the arguments that have been put forward on behalf of Anti-aircraft Command. The number of aircraft that have so far been admitted as shot down by Anti-aircraft Command is 806. It is difficult to dispute that a Command which has shot down 806 aircraft is an operational command. In the second place, decorations have been issued to officers and men of that Command for gallantry in the face 979 of the enemy. I have had a letter from a major, who tells me that he recommended one of his captains who was stationed in the Isle of Dogs, and, as a result of the recommendation, the captain was awarded the Military Cross—not the George Cross or the George Medal, but the Military Cross, which is only awarded for gallantry in action. In the third place, Anti-Aircraft Command, in the early days of the war, was not only regarded as operational but as quite definitely in the front line.\n\nI remember raising with my right hon. Friend the Member for Devonport (Mr. Hore-Belisha), when he was Secretary of State for War, a question whether it was desirable to have in our searchlight battery as ordinary searchlighters certain tradesmen who were urgently required for other purposes. We had a lance corporal who, in peace time, was an inspector of camel lorries which were in short supply, and I put it to my right hon. Friend whether we ought to retain such a man as an ordinary lance corporal in charge of a searchlight site. His reply was that, although he might be withdrawn from the Forces at that time, the danger of aerial attack upon this country was so great that tradesmen were asked not to withdraw from Anti-Aircraft Command. Even the Government can hardly have their cake and eat it. We cannot be of such importance in 1939 and be told in 1943 that this is not an operational command.\n\nMay I give some logical examples? It was in June, 1941, that we were required to co-operate in the Field Force in certain large scale manoeuvres in East Anglia. All through the day we were required to take part in these manoeuvres with the Field Forces, and half an hour before sunset we were required to put up a notice outside our camp to say that we had ceased to play. We were somewhat mocked and derided by the Field Force on the ground that we were only willing to do our manoeuvres by day. The answer was that from half an hour before sunset until half an hour after sunrise we were required to be available to man our searchlight equipment, and it was for that reason we were required to be operational during the hours of darkness, and therefore were not able to continue to train with the Field Force who at that time had not the same operational function that we had. It is 980 a little hard to be told in 1943 that we do not belong to an operational command.\n\nI want to put the point, not on the purely logical ground which has been chosen by the Government in issuing their White Paper, but that of broad equity. A very large proportion of Anti-Aircraft Command consisted of Territorials, men who in peace time continued in their ordinary peace time avocations and gave up two or three nights a week, and frequently their week-ends, in order to train for war. There was the case of the battery in Buxton in my constituency. They had been an infantry unit in the Sherwood Foresters, and never concealed their unwillingness to be converted from their infant"
