        "text": "Developing countries that receive peacekeeping operations exhibit gender disparities within their educational systems. The period spanning from the 1980s to the 2000s has witnessed a notable rise in the level of educational achievement among female students. I am interested in understanding the role of peacekeeping operations in facilitating the transition to peace and post-conflict reconstruction in various nations that encourage educational development. Is there evidence of a societal shift with regards to the prominence of women peacekeepers in leadership roles, and if so, does this have a positive impact on the educational aspirations of young girls? The deliberate selection of secondary education is attributed to the fact that it encompasses a significant developmental phase for adolescents, spanning from ages 11 to 12 and extending to 18 to 19. This period represents the most substantial gap in education and a crucial time of transformation for this demographic. The study aims to examine the potential impact of female peacekeepers on the educational outcomes of secondary school girls, and if this shift in gender roles influences young girls both prior to and following intervention.\n\nRead Full Research Paper by Naima Dawid (PDF)\n\nWe have more to blame on global warming than just rising seas or increases in severe weather. The Arctic, a once untouched landscape, is now at the forefront of geopolitical tensions. Due to the increase in overall global temperatures, the Arctic ice cap and the Greenland ice sheet are melting. The receding ice, once a formidable barrier to human activity, is giving way and countries around the world are keen to take advantage of the Arctic’s ever more accessible sea lanes, and lucrative resources. Arctic states have increasingly found themselves in competition for these resources and regional politics, once known for their idyllic cooperation and communal sense of purpose, are now strained. The institutions made for a once exceptional Arctic are failing to adequately respond, and mounting pressure from countries beyond the traditional Arctic states, (the United Sates, Denmark, Russia, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, and Finland) in particular from China, has made management via current governance difficult. Thus, the question is not whether reform is needed, but how best to manage that reform. Conflicting views among the Arctic states regarding security and access have led to two immediate arguments. One advocating for stricter controls on Arctic access, in particular regarding China and rising non-Arctic states. While the other advocates for greater global cooperation and inclusion surrounding the Arctic, especially in light of climate change. Though China is undoubtedly a challenger to the current rules-based order, the Arctic nations have more to gain by cooperating with rising non-Arctic states such as China, than they do by excluding them. Exclusion will only increase what is already taking place, active efforts to subvert current governance and navigate outside of it (Doshi et al., 2021). Effort put forth to actively exclude nations from the Arctic, be it in the form of trade or security policies, will be effort wasted and effort that could have otherwise been used towards building stronger legally binding agreements. Agreements that are created through cooperation and inclusion, not exclusion.\n\nRead Full Research Paper by Blake Browning (PDF)\n\nThe October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks that resulted in the massacre of at least 1200 Israelis has again made an incredibly tough issue one of the primary concerns of policymakers focused on international security. The attacks were extremely gutting due to the barbaric nature of the murders and horrific images and stories that continue to come out every day. Because of the life altering events that took place that terrible day, it was understandable and most definitely expected what the response of the Israeli government would be. Despite the recent political turmoil in Israel, including an extremely controversial and un-democratic judicial overhaul, corruption charges against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the never-ending cycle of parliamentary elections that left no clear winners, the government was able to quickly unite to form a war cabinet. Despite this united front, there are real questions about how the Netanyahu government missed the many clear warning signs about the attacks, as well as the confirmed report that Egypt warned Israel about the attacks not long before they happened. It is widely expected that Netanyahu will be forced out following the conclusion of the initial stages of the war effort, but the Prime Minister seems to have as many political lives as a cat so that is unclear. There are also real questions about what the actual objectives of Israel should be and are in their military operation in Gaza. This paper will consider this question, but it is also necessary to understand what drove Israeli foreign policy before this. This paper will not dictate what Israeli foreign policy should be, but it will investigate what is possible while still reflecting the decades long foreign policy of Israel. This paper will argue that Israeli foreign policy, conducted through regional hybridism, is primarily driven by the state’s desire for survival, which explains their posture towards their Arab neighbors, state and non-state actors alike.\n\nRead Full Research Paper by Josh Hayes (PDF)\n\nDisinformation campaigns are as destructive in strong states in the west of Europe as in weaker states in the Southeast of Europe and at the EU-Russian border. There are flaws in the current strategy of the EU to limit the effects of disinformation campaigns launched by Russia. This can be observed by researching the causes of societal friction that can be a result of foreign influencing public opinion with malign intend. The article is structured into four sections: an explanation of concepts such as the gray zone and Russia's modus operandi, an overview of current strategies countering Russian disinformation in the EU, and an analysis of the current shortcomings in these strategies. Lastly, a proposal for a strategy based on societal resilience for liberal democratic nations is presented, along with recommendations for altering strategies in the EU and liberal western democracies like the Netherlands, France, and Germany.\n\nRead Full Research Paper by Leon Wiskie (PDF)\n\nWith the collapse of Soviet Union and the subsequent end of Cold War era superpower confrontation, the continued relevance and survivability of NATO has been put into question. While many predicted that alliance would cease to exist, it has not only weathered the storm of changing geopolitical landscapes but has also emerged stronger. Given that, this study will offer a comprehensive analysis in answering an important question: what explains NATO’s resilience in the post-Cold War era, considering the complexities and challenges it has confronted? For background, this study presents a selected roots of NATO and explores the merits of its longevity before offering broader policy implications of this narrative. It then argues that NATO, far from being a historical artifact, stands as a dynamic and indispensable organization in the contemporary global security architecture. Its ability to evolve while preserving its fundamental principles underscores the alliance’s enduring relevance, positioning itself as a crucial force in maintaining peace and stability in the ever-changing world.\n\nRead Full Research Paper by Zin Mar Khing (PDF)\n\nThe relationship between the European Union (EU) and the Russian Federation (RF) can be characterized as a complex fusion of conflict and cooperation. This research paper argues that the two political entities should prioritize maintaining a constructive relationship and amiable foreign relations. The three chief areas of economic and energy security, international security and regional stability frame the nature of the EU-Russia partnership. A potential framework to navigate that relationship should address both areas of cooperation and conflict, while promoting transparency, security and stability. By examining the complex relations of the EU and Russia on different levels of cooperation, policymakers can benefit from a better understanding of the partnership between the two entities. Future research initiatives could focus on identifying precise policies that can further advance the relationship between the EU and the Russian Federation.\n\nRead Full Research Paper by Denitsa Raichkova-Pena (PDF)\n\nWhen examining the social fabric of the United States and Canada, it becomes clear that there are notable differences in the basic tenets of being an American or a Canadian. It is intriguing to witness the divergent methods employed in states that provide citizenship via birth, ancestry, and the process of becoming a citizen when it comes to incorporating immigrant communities. This study investigates the intricate relationship between the societal structures of destination nations and efforts to engage immigrant populations. This essay examines the abstract representation of a destination state as a melting pot and mosaic society and how it affects the relationships and affiliations of diaspora citizens. This research examines the impact of diversity and assimilation models on how the diaspora perceives opportunities and their ability to take action in the country they have migrated to. The objective of this study is to ascertain if a melting pot setting fosters assimilation and diminishes affiliations with the home state, or if a mosaic society may foster the preservation of cultural identity and deeper links to the diaspora's homeland. Furthermore, the paper explores the potential securitization of diaspora groups as a result of their alignment with the objectives of the host nations. This article will specifically examine immigration post-9/11. We will analyze the process of incorporating the immigrant communities into the social and economic fabric of both the United States and Canada. We shall analyze if there is a rise in the securitization of this diaspora. The objective of my thesis is to examine how the structure and organization of society influence the degree to which immigration is treated as a matter of national security. Will the absence of adequate assimilation in a multicultural society result in heightened marginalization among immigrant communities? When examining mosaic societies, will it become apparent that the preservation of cultural identity and encouragement of variety might provide obstacles to attaining full integration while also addressing security concerns?\n\nRead Working Paper by Naima Dawid (PDF)\n\nDaniel Yergin’s \"The New Map: Energy, Climate, and the Clash of Nations\" provides a comprehensive analysis on the intersection of global energy landscape with the broader geopolitical and economic engagement and competition among states. Through detailed narratives and historical contexts, the author explores the transformational impact of the shale revolution, the subsequent shifts in energy dynamics among major states like the U.S., Russia, China, and the Middle East, and the intricate interplay between energy supply, demand and geopolitical tensions. Although the book delves deeply into the geopolitical aspects, it encounters criticisms for its limited focus on certain demand-side countries, minimal attention to climate change urgency, and insufficient exploration of potential long-term implications of renewable energy transitions. Despite these limitations, \"The New Map\" offers valuable insights into the complex relationship between energy, geopolitics and global security, making it a compelling read for researchers, policymakers and readers interested in understanding the intricate web of energy and international relations in the modern world.\n\nRead Full Review Paper by Zin Mar Khing (PDF)\n\nAs a result of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel and the ongoing response from Israel in Gaza, the Houthis, a rebel group in the Republic of Yemen, have entered the conflict in ideological solidarity with Palestine. After firing an unknown number of drones and missiles toward Israel throughout October and November, on Nov. 19, the Houthis seized an Israeli-owned shipping vessel in the Red Sea. Since then, extending into 2024, they have attacked more ships passing through the trade route, now extending beyond Israeli-owned vessels, with drones, missiles and speed boats. These attacks have threatened international trade and have prompted the United States to form Operation Prosperity Guardian, an international military coalition aimed at protecting ships traveling the Red Sea. The Houthis are part of Iran's proxy system, allied ideologically and supported militarily. Saudi Arabia supports the internationally recognized government of Yemen, and the conflict for power between the Houthis and the Yemeni government is indicative of the proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran that has developed since 2015. Yemen is currently experiencing the world's worst humanitarian disaster. With tensions high in the region due to the Israel-Palestine conflict and increasing animosity between Israel and Iran, the Red Sea attacks are a possible catalyst for a bigger and more devastating regional conflict.\n\nRead International Security Report by Samantha Ramay (PDF)\n\nIn Oct. 2023, the region of Israel and Palestine, places already susceptible to violence, descended into a violent conflict following the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks within Israel, that killed over 1,200 Israelis and resulted in over 240 hostages being taken. Israel responded with a full-force ground invasion of Gaza, a Palestinian territory controlled by the terrorist group Hamas. Since the onset of violence, there has been a significant decline in already low human development levels in Gaza as well as a significant drop in economic performance in Israel. The war has led to nearly the entire population of Gaza being internally displaced, along with over 25,000 deaths. Currently, the greatest risk within Gaza is the potential of famine which is largely due to the inability to get enough humanitarian aid into Gaza and the right hands. On a military level, Israel’s stated goal of the war is the destruction of Hamas and its ideology which is tricky if not impossible to measure and complete. Additionally, there is a possible although less likely option of the war expanding to other actors such as Hezbollah or Iran. Even if Israel is successful in their goal, the question that will be raised is what comes next. The current Israeli government, the most right-wing in its history, is unwilling to negotiate on a potential sovereign Palestinian state, but without the possibility of such a state, the violence between the two sides may never truly end. Diplomatic efforts of major international players and neighboring Arab states in the short term will be aimed at the release of hostages and a durable pause in fighting to get aid into Gaza. These talks are currently ongoing and are being led by Qatar and Egypt but so far, a breakthrough hasn’t occurred. In the long term, a political solution will need to be implemented to the conflict, likely involving a Palestinian state, but only if Israel agrees. How the situation develops will affect the entire region in the decades and centuries to come.\n\nRead International Security Report by Joshua Hayes (PDF)"
