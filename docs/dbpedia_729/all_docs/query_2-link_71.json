The Fantasticks was a name given to a certain school ofmystical and metaphysical writers who flourished in the seventeenth century of whom John Donne, the illustrious Dean of St. Paul's was the chief. This book is an introduction to poets whose work is of outstanding importance to us todau, when the moulding of life into a valid synthesis is the vital necessity for a generation which has suffered two most shattering world tragedies in the course of a mere thirty years; for if we cannot integrate our human lives, and attain at any rate a reasonable comprehension of the end and purpose of life and how to live it, there is little hope for the future of the world. Illustrations. 170 pp. (We carry a wide selection of titles in The Arts, Theology, History, Politics, Social and Physical Sciences. academic and scholarly books and Modern First Editions etc.)."
