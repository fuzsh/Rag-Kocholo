The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Benton County Cause No. 86-2-00646-7.]\n\nWhere the worker died leaving no surviving beneficiaries after the proposed decision and order granting him a pension had been issued, but before it had been adopted by the Board, the worker's accrued pension benefits were not payable to his estate. .In re Leo Gilmore, Dec'd, BIIA Dec., 57,759 (1981) [Editor's Note: Consider the effect of 1999 Legislative changes to RCW 51.32.040 which make accrued benefits payable to the estate.]\n\nAt the time of the worker's death no specific disability rating had been communicated to the Department but all the evidence necessary to rate disability was available through the attending physician, who had found the worker's condition fixed and ratable prior to the worker's death. The Department should have secured such evidence and, if disability was found, paid the award therefore to the surviving beneficiary. .In re Bernard Nickolai, Dec'd, BIIA Dec., 38,266 (1971)\n\nABUSE OF DISCRETION\n\nSee AGGRAVATION, MEDICAL BILLS, SCOPE OF REVIEW, STANDARD OF REVIEW, THIRD PARTY ACTIONS, and VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION\n\nACCIDENT REPORT\n\nSee APPLICATION FOR BENEFITS\n\nAGGRAVATION (RCW 51.32.160)\n\nSee also APPLICATION TO REOPEN CLAIM, DIMINUTION OF DISABILITY, OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE, PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY, PERMANENT TOTAL DISABILITY, RES JUDICATA, RETROACTIVITY OF STATUTORY AMENDMENTS, SUBSEQUENT CONDITION TRACEABLE TO ORIGINAL INJURY, and TIMELINESS OF APPLICATION TO REOPEN CLAIM\n\nApplicability of 1988 amendments\n\nThe 1988 amendments to RCW 51.32.160 were remedial in nature and apply to any application to reopen a claim filed subsequent to the effective date of the amendments, June 9, 1988. .In re Marven Sandven, BIIA Dec., 89 3338 (1990) [Editor's Note: See Campos v. Department of Labor & Indus., 75 Wn. App. 379 (1994) determining that amendment's seven-year limitation does not violate equal protection.]\n\n\"Deemed granted\" application to reopen claim\n\nWhere the Department grants a worker's application to reopen for aggravation, the employer timely protests the reopening order, and the Department holds the reopening order in abeyance, the Department must deny the application to reopen within the time limits set out in RCW 51.52.060 or the application to reopen will be deemed granted. .In re Raymond Belden, BIIA Dec., 12 14005 (2013) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to Spokane County Superior Court, No. 13-2-01191-8.]\n\nAfter the Department places in abeyance the terms of an order that extends the time in which to act on an application to reopen the claim, the time to act is no longer extended. The application to reopen must be deemed granted if not acted on or again extended within 90 days of receipt of the application as required by RCW 51.52.060(4). .In re Ingrid Evanoff, BIIA Dec., 08 18344 (2008) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Thurston County Cause No. 08-2-02400-5.]\n\nThe employer's ability under RCW 51.52.060(5) to appeal a deemed-granted application to reopen on the merits does not create a comparable ability to protest a deemed-granted application to reopen. .In re Stephen Murphy, BIIA Dec., 02 12603 (2003)\n\nThe 1995 amendment to RCW 51.52.060 reduced the time the Department has to place in abeyance the terms of orders involving applications to reopen claims. If an application to reopen is filed before the effective date, the statutory changes do not apply to the application to reopen. Additionally, even if the 1995 amendments could be applied, the failure of the Department to act within the proscribed time period will not result in the application being \"deemed granted.\" .In re Elois Short, BIIA Dec., 95 4522 (1996) [dissent]\n\nWhen there has been an appeal of an order closing the claim and an application to reopen filed while the appeal is pending, the Department has 90 days from the final order of the Board or Court to issue an order on the application or the application will be deemed granted. The Department should not act upon an application to reopen the claim when the appeal from the claim closure is still pending in light of Reid v. Department of Labor & Indus., 1 Wn.2d 430 (1939). Distinguishing Marley v. Department of Labor& Indus, 125 Wn.2d 533 (1995). .In re Greg Ackerson, BIIA Dec., 94 1135 (1995) [dissent] [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Whatcom County Cause No. 95-2-00808-5. The Board has partially overruled this decision to the extent the decision relies on the concept of subject matter jurisdiction. In re Betty Wilson, BIIA Dec.,02 21517 (2004), In re Jorge Perez-Rodriquez, BIIA Dec., 06 18718 (2008).]\n\nWhere the Department received a copy of a Superior Court judgment regarding the appeal of the last order closing the claim and the time for acting on the application to reopen the claim has passed, resulting in the application being deemed granted, the consequence is that the claim is considered to have been reopened for temporary worsening or aggravation--the worker must still prove entitlement to further benefits. .In re Margaret Casey, BIIA Dec., 90 5286 (1992) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Pierce County Cause No. 92-2-04909-6.]\n\nThe Department's failure to respond to a physician's submission of office notes recommending further treatment within the time prescribed by RCW 51.32.160, the application to reopen is deemed granted, notwithstanding the provisions of WAC 296-14-400. WAC 296-14-400 is invalid to the extent it is an attempt to delay the running of the 90-day period within which the Department is required to act following the filing of an application to reopen a claim for aggravation of condition. .In re Wallace Hansen, BIIA Dec., 90 1429 (1991) [Editor's Note: Cf. Tollycraft Yachts v. McCoy, 122 Wn.2d 426, 433 (1993).]\n\nAn order extending the time in which the Department must act on an application to reopen the claim must be entered before the initial time allowed by RCW 51.32.160 has passed. An order purporting to further extend the time, entered after the first extension period has passed, is ineffective, since at the time such order was entered the application to reopen the claim had already been \"deemed granted\" by operation of RCW 51.32.160. .In re Edwin Fiedler, BIIA Dec., 90 1680 (1990)\n\nWhere the last order closing the claim has been appealed and is not yet final the Department is not under any obligation to act upon a subsequent application to reopen the claim until a final order has been entered by either the Board or the Court, as the case may be. Under the circumstances of this case the time within which the Department had to act on the application to reopen the claim could not begin any sooner than the date upon which the Department received a conformed copy of the Superior Court's Stipulated Order of Dismissal. Reid v. Department of Labor& Indus., 1 Wn.2d 430 (1940). .In re Edwin Fiedler, BIIA Dec., 90 1680 (1990) [Editor's Note: Consider impact, if any, of Marley v. Department of Labor & Indus., 125 Wn.2d 533 (1995) See In re Greg Ackerson, BIIA Dec., 94 1135 (1995).]\n\nThe Department may not deny an application to reopen a claim and then promptly enter an abeyance order, on its own motion pursuant to RCW 51.52.060, thereby attempting to give itself up to 180 additional days to act on the application. To allow such action would render the time limitations of RCW 51.32.160 completely illusory. Where the Department has entered such an abeyance order but has not made a final decision to deny the application within the time allowed by RCW 51.32.160, the application to reopen the claim is deemed granted. .In re John Aitchison, BIIA Dec., 90 4447 (1990); In re Donald Schroeder, BIIA Dec., 90 3177 (1990); In re Virginia Watts, BIIA Dec., 90 3816 (1990) [Editor's Note: Rule reversed by Tollycraft Yachts v. McCoy, 122 Wn.2d 426 (1993).]\n\nThe provisions of RCW 51.32.160, as amended in 1988, which render an application to reopen a claim \"deemed granted\" if an order denying the application is not issued within 90 days of receipt of the application, do not apply where the Department denied the application within the time allowed but, following the filing of an appeal, reassumed jurisdiction over the claim and held its order denying the application in abeyance. .In re Edna Shore, BIIA Dec., 89 5898 (1990) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Clallam County Cause No. 91-2-00740-6.]\n\nDiscretionary reopening by Director\n\nWhen an application to reopen is filed more than seven years after the first closing order became final, the reopening of the claim for aggravation is not at the discretion of the director. Only the decision to award time-loss compensation or other disability benefits are committed to the director's discretion. .In re Michael Bell, BIIA Dec., 11 15598 (2012)\n\nIn an appeal of Director's letter refusing to waive the time limit for filing an application to reopen the claim, the standard of review is whether the decision not to waive the time limit constitutes an \"abuse of discretion.\" .In re Ernest Therriault, BIIA Dec., 90 0876 (1990)\n\nThe Director has discretion to waive the seven year limitation for filing an application to reopen a claim provided there are sufficient facts to support a finding that an aggravation of disability has occurred. The required factual basis is not within the determination vested in the discretion of the Director and the Board therefore has jurisdiction to decide whether the worker's condition worsened between the terminal dates. .In re Merle Fugate, BIIA Dec., 86 1526 (1987) [dissent] [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under King County Cause No. 87-2-22610-7.]\n\nOnce the Director exercises the discretion to reopen a claim which otherwise could not be reopened due to the time limitations of RCW 51.32.160, the worker is entitled to benefits under the Act to the same extent as if there had been no time limitation bar. .In re Bernard James, BIIA Dec., 04,394 (1955) [Editor's Note: See later statutory amendments, Laws of 1988, ch. 161, § 11.]\n\nEffect of abeyance order on \"deemed granted\" provisions (RCW 51.32.160)\n\nThe prohibition contained in RCW 51.52.060(4) that precludes the Department from issuing an order holding in abeyance the terms of an order issued pursuant to RCW 51.32.160 does not apply when the Department has been requested to reconsider the order under the authority of RCW 51.52.050. .In re Joseph Brown, BIIA Dec., 96 4577 (1996)\n\nRCW 51.52.060(4) as amended in 1995 prohibits the Department from issuing an order that holds in abeyance the terms of an order issued under RCW 51.32.160 when more than 90 days have passed since an application to reopen has been filed. .In re Nancy Stumbaugh, BIIA Dec., 95 7068 (1996)\n\nWhere the Department elects to hold an order in abeyance pursuant to RCW 51.52.060, not in response to a protest or an appeal, the time limitations for action set forth in RCW 51.32.160 still apply. .In re Clyde McCoy, BIIA Dec., 91 0701 (1991) [Editor's Note: Reversed, Tollycraft Yachts v. McCoy, 122 Wn.2d 426, 433 (1993.)]\n\nExtension of time to act on application to reopen claim\n\nAn order extending the time in which the Department must act on an application to reopen the claim must be entered before the initial time allowed by RCW 51.32.160 has passed. An order purporting to further extend the time, entered after the first extension period has passed, is ineffective, since at the time such order was entered the application to reopen the claim had already been \"deemed granted\" by operation of RCW 51.32.160. .In re Edwin Fiedler, BIIA Dec., 90 1680 (1990)\n\nAn order extending the time for acting on an application to reopen the claim which is not timely appealed is final and binding and has res judicata effect. Worker cannot collaterally attack the unappealed extension decision in a later appeal of an order denying reopening of the claim. .In re Clara Morton, BIIA Dec., 89 5897 (1990)\n\nFirst closure based on medical recommendation\n\nUnder the 1988 amendments to RCW 51.32.160, closing orders which were issued prior to July 1, 1981 need not be based on medical recommendation, advice or examination in order to serve as the starting point for the seven year period in which the worker is entitled, as a matter of right, to apply to have the claim reopened for payment of additional disability benefits. .In re Marven Sandven, BIIA Dec., 89 3338 (1990); In re Mike Streubel, BIIA Dec., 89 4867 (1990)\n\nFirst terminal date: effect of Board's determination of effective date of closure\n\nA Department order issued in response to an Order Adopting Proposed Decision and Order is a ministerial order and the effective date of the closure of the claim is the effective date recited in the Board's order. It is not the date of the Order Adopting Proposed Decision and Order. .In re Donald Workman, BIIA Dec., 00 24102 (2001)\n\nFirst terminal date: effect of subsequent ministerial order\n\nThe issuance of a Department order pursuant to the terms of a Board Order on Agreement of Parties is merely a ministerial act. It does not adjudicate the merits of the claim beyond the date of the Department order which was the subject of the Board order. Therefore, the date of the Department order appealed, and not the date of the subsequent ministerial order, is the first terminal date of subsequent aggravation period. (Karniss v. Department of Labor & Indus., 39 Wn.2d 898 (1952)). .In re Jimmy Storer, BIIA Dec., 86 4436 (1988) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Stevens County Cause No. 88-2-00328-7.]\n\nWhen an agreement back dates the effective date of claim closure, the effective date of claim closure need not be the same date that the Department last adjudicated the merits of the claim. The date the Department last adjudicated the merits of the claim is relevant to determination of the first terminal date. .In re Saioloa Muasau, BIIA Dec., 17 12438 (2018) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Pierce County Cause No. 18-2-09825-0.]\n\nBecause the parties agreed in an Order on Agreement of Parties that the Department should adjudicate the claim through December 3, 2009, December 3, 2009, became the first terminal date. .In re Ernest Kish, BIIA Dec., 12 20993 (2014) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Pierce County Cause No. 14-2-10478-8.]\n\nFirst terminal date findings\n\nAn Order on Agreement of Parties on the first terminal date, based on an examination by a particular physician, establishes the findings which must serve as the basis of comparison to determine if worsening has occurred between the terminal dates. .In re John Jensen(I), BIIA Dec., 16,316 (1964)\n\nLast closing order not final\n\nAfter the Department's decision to reopen the claim for aggravation becomes final, even if based on a mistake of law, the decision defeats any argument relating to the finality of the prior closing order and the reopening order sets the date upon which further benefits can be considered. .In re Christopher Preiser, BIIA Dec., 09 19683 (2010) [dissent] [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Snohomish County Cause No. 10-2-09709-9.]\n\nThe Department's failure to properly close a claim before denial of an application to reopen a claim is not jurisdictional; the failure is an error of law and the subsequent denial of an application to reopen that becomes final is res judicata that the claim is closed as of the date of that denial. .In re Jorge Perez-Rodriguez, BIIA Dec., 06 18718 (2008)\n\nWhen the Department fails to properly communicate the original closing order, but reopens a claim in response to an application to reopen and provides benefits, the Board obtains jurisdiction over an appeal of an order that re-closes the claim despite the Department's failure to communicate the original closing order. Distinguishing In re Ronald Leibfried, BIIA Dec., 88 2274 (1990). .In re Glenda Singletary, BIIA Dec., 06 12195 (2007) [Editor's Note: Reversed on other grounds Singletary v. Manor Health Care Corp., 116 Wn. App. 774 (2012).]\n\nWhen there has been an appeal of an order closing the claim and an application to reopen filed while the appeal is pending, the Department has 90 days from the final order of the Board or Court to issue an order on the application or the application will be deemed granted. The Department should not act upon an application to reopen the claim when the appeal from the claim closure is still pending in light of Reid v. Department of Labor & Indus., 1 Wn.2d 430 (1939). Distinguishing Marley v. Department of Labor& Indus, 125 Wn.2d 533 (1995). .In re Greg Ackerson, BIIA Dec., 94 1135 (1995) [dissent] [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Whatcom County Cause No. 95-2-00808-5. The Board has partially overruled this decision to the extent the decision relies on the concept of subject matter jurisdiction. In re Betty Wilson, BIIA Dec., 02 21517 (2004), In re Jorge Perez-Rodriquez, BIIA Dec., 06 18718 (2008).]\n\nWhere the last order closing the claim has been appealed and is not yet final the Department is not under any obligation to act upon a subsequent application to reopen the claim until a final order has been entered by either the Board or the Court, as the case may be. Under the circumstances of this case the time within which the Department had to act on the application to reopen the claim could not begin any sooner than the date upon which the Department received a conformed copy of the Superior Court's Stipulated Order of Dismissal. Reid v. Department of Labor & Indus., 1 Wn.2d 430 (1940). .In re Edwin Fiedler, BIIA Dec., 90 1680 (1990) [Editor's Note: Consider impact, if any, of Marley v. Department of Labor & Indus., 125 Wn.2d 533 (1995) See In re Greg Ackerson, BIIA Dec., 941135 (1995).]\n\nWhere a prior closing order was not communicated to the claimant it was improper to construe a further order denying a subsequent application to reopen the claim as an order affirming the order closing the claim. The issues before the Department on an application to reopen the claim are different from those involved when closing the claim. In this case, the Board therefore directed the Department to treat the application to reopen the claim as a protest and to issue a further determinative order concerning the closure of the claim. .In re Ronald Leibfried, BIIA Dec., 88 2274 (1990) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Grant County Cause No. 91-2-00015-4. Although this decision correctly determines an application to reopen can be treated as a protest, consider the effect of In re Jorge Perez-Rodriquez, BIIA Dec., 06 18718 (2008) on the effects of the denial of an application to reopen that becomes final when the original closing order was not communicated.]\n\nNon-network provider authorized to file application to reopen\n\nThe provision of WAC 296-14-400 that allows only a network provider to file an application to reopen a claim is an interpretive rule and not a binding legislative rule, and RCW 51.36.010 does not limit the filing of an application to reopen to network providers. .In re Ronald Ma'ae, , BIIA Dec., 14 21595 (2015)[dissent] [Editor's Note: Affirmed, Ma'ae v. Dep't of Labor & Indus., 8 Wn. App. 2d 189 (2019).]\n\nObjective evidence requirement\n\nConsistently positive Tinel's sign and positive Phalen's test constitute objective physical or clinical findings of worsening and are not merely subjective complaints or symptoms. .In re Peggy Anderson, BIIA Dec., 09 11986 (2010)\n\nSome medical conditions cannot be measured by the independent observation of a physician, and where that is the case, the worker's subjective report of worsening coupled with a physician's opinion that supports the worker's report is sufficient to establish worsening. .In re Charles Lewis, BIIA Dec., 07 16483 (2008)\n\nA worker's subjective description of increased pain is not sufficient to establish that the condition causally related to the industrial injury worsened or became aggravated between the relevant terminal dates since there must be some objective findings to support the complaints of increased pain and loss of function. .In re John Anderson, BIIA Dec., 91 6315 (1992) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Yakima County Cause No. 93-2-00001-3.]\n\nUnder the 1988 amendments to RCW 51.32.160, the time limitation is removed for applying to reopen a claim to obtain additional medical services. However, in order to show entitlement to additional medical services, a worker must still establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the condition causally related to the industrial injury worsened or became aggravated on an objective basis between the relevant terminal dates. .In re Marven Sandven, BIIA Dec., 89 3338 (1990)\n\nER 703 does not eliminate the substantive rule requiring objective medical evidence of worsening. .In re Earl Blake, BIIA Dec., 51,928 (1980) [Editor's Note: But see Price v. Department of Labor & Indus., 101 Wn.2d 520 (1984).]\n\nOver seven years after initial closure (RCW 51.32.160)\n\nThe exercise of the director's discretion to provide permanent partial disability benefits in a claim reopened over seven years after the first closure does not make decisions to deny temporary or permanent total disability benefits reviewable under a preponderance of the evidence standard.\n\n.In re David Platzer, BIIA Dec., 18 26897 (Order Vacating Proposed Decision and Order) (2020)\n\nWhen an application to reopen is filed more than seven years after the first closing order became final, the reopening of the claim for aggravation is not at the discretion of the director. Only the decision to award time-loss compensation or other disability benefits are committed to the director's discretion. .In re Michael Bell, BIIA Dec., 11 15598 (2012)\n\nThe Director abused her discretion when she failed to consider whether the worker was unable to work because of the industrial injury and based her decision to deny benefits solely on the basis that the worker had not been working. .In re Robert Dorr, Jr., BIIA Dec., 07 23982 (2009)\n\nWhere a worker files an application to reopen more than seven years after the first closing order became final, such application is not timely within the meaning of RCW 51.32.160 but the worker is entitled to a determination of worsening and entitlement to proper and necessary treatment as authorized by RCW 51.36.010. .In re Carol Allen, BIIA Dec., 91 1837 (1992)\n\nPensions\n\nRCW 51.32.160 does not apply after the worker has been found to be permanently totally disabled. An order placing the worker on a pension is not a closing order as contemplated by RCW 52.32.160. .In re Robert Dwyer, BIIA Dec., 13 19440 (2014)\n\nPermanent total disability\n\nWhile it is not necessary to show an increase in category of impairment to establish an aggravation of condition resulting in permanent total disability, the worker must still show an increase in loss of bodily function demonstrated by objective medical findings. .In re Jean Wassmann, BIIA Dec., 69 953 (1986)\n\nWhere a worker's claim is closed without an industrial insurance pension and later reopened, then reclosed, and the worker seeks increased permanent disability, the evidence of worsening does not need to be substantial; a slight worsening of a condition where the percentage rating of impairment does not increase can still result in the award of a pension provided that a preponderance of the evidence shows the worker can no longer maintain gainful employment. .In re Darla Ellinghausen, BIIA Dec.,\n\n19 24229 (2021)\n\nProximate cause of worsened condition: new injury vs. aggravation\n\nAn incident at work can be both a new industrial injury and an aggravation of an earlier industrial injury. Because the Department administered the new injury under the earlier claim does not mean that the Department rejected the new claim. .In re Howard Jones, BIIA Dec., 13 20776 (2014)\n\nIn considering the Department's requirement under WAC 296-14-420 to issue a joint order concerning whether a condition is the responsibility of a new claim or an aggravation of an existing claim, the Department cannot be made to issue a joint order if a determination rejecting the new claim has become final. .In re Douglas Lenz, BIIA Dec., 00 21329 (2002)\n\nWhere a self-insured employer asserts that a worker's condition was the result of a new injury rather than an aggravation of the condition causally related to the industrial injury for which the employer was responsible, a Department order which included only the signature of the claims manager does not comply with WAC 296-14-420. To meet the requirements of WAC 296-14-420, the Department order must reflect that it is a single determination made jointly by the assistant directors for claims administration and self-insurance. .In re Bennie Johnson, BIIA Dec., 91 4040 (1992)\n\nThe occurrence of a new injury and an aggravation of a preexisting condition are not mutually exclusive. Whether a worker's worsened condition is a result of a new incident or constitutes an aggravation of the original injury depends upon whether the new incident is a supervening cause, independent of the original injury. The real question is one of proximate cause, i.e., whether \"but for\" the original injury the worker would not have sustained the subsequent condition. .In re Robert Tracy, BIIA Dec., 88 1695 (1990)\n\nWhere a new traumatic event was wholly and independently responsible for the worker's worsened low back condition and the accepted industrial injury was not a proximate cause of the later occurring symptoms, the McDougle (64 Wn.2d 640) reasonableness test was inapplicable. .In re William Dowd, BIIA Dec., 61,310 (1983) [Editor's Note: Consider continued application in light of In re Robert Tracy, BIIA Dec., 88 1695 (1990).]\n\nMcDougle (64 Wn.2d 640) does not hold that a new accident identifiable in time and place, adversely affecting an area of the body previously injured in an industrial injury, should be considered an aggravation of that previous injury. The aggravation of the worker's condition is the result of the new and independent traumatic occurrence, not the industrial injury. .In re Alfred Swindell, BIIA Dec., 53,792 (1980) [Editor's Note: Consider continued application in light of In re Robert Tracy, BIIA Dec., 88 1695 (1990).]\n\nAlthough the worker's initial low back condition was due to the industrial injury, the subsequent aggravation was due to a new, intervening and independent cause, and was not a proximate result of the industrial injury. The application to reopen the claim was therefore properly denied. .In re Marian Roberts, BIIA Dec., 17,096 (1963) [Editor's Note: Consider continued application in light of In re Robert Tracy, BIIA Dec., 88 1695 (1990).]\n\nProximate cause of worsened condition: new occupational disease vs. aggravation\n\nWhether a carpal tunnel condition resulting from employment activities which give rise to a need for surgery is an aggravation of an occupational disease for which prior claims were filed, or a new occupational disease, is a question of proximate cause. A claim of aggravation of a prior condition and a claim for a new occupational disease may not be mutually exclusive. .In re Leonard Roberson, BIIA Dec., 89 0106 (1990)\n\nProximate cause of worsened condition: pre-existing condition\n\nIn order to be entitled to benefits on reopening of the claim it is necessary to show aggravation of the condition that was caused by the industrial injury; it is insufficient to show only a worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporarily lit up by the industrial injury. .In re Arlen Long, BIIA Dec., 94 2539 (1996) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Okanogan County Cause No. 96-2-00033-9.]\n\nPsychiatric conditions\n\nThe rule in Price (101 Wn.2d 520), eliminating the need to show objective evidence of worsening, does not apply unless the worker's condition has a psychiatric rather than a physical basis and the diagnosis is in the terminology of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III) as required by WAC 296-20-330(e). .In re Deborah Lee, BIIA Dec., 71 058 (1987) [dissent] [Editor's Note: Affirmed, Lee v. Department of Labor & Indus., 54 Wn. App. 1057 (1989).]\n\nRes Judicata - See RES JUDICATA Aggravation\n\nScope of Review - See SCOPE OF REVIEW Aggravation\n\nSurvivor's benefits based on permanent total disability of deceased worker - See SURVIVOR'S BENEFITS Aggravation\n\nTemporary worsening\n\nWhen Department has reopened a claim for medical treatment it has admitted at least a temporary increase in disability (In re John Qualls, BIIA Dec., 28,430 (1969)). A worker need not prove aggravation in an appeal from an order reclosing the claim with no additional permanent disability award if the worker is seeking further treatment, time-loss compensation or loss of earning power benefits. However, if the worker's condition is fixed and stable, it is incumbent upon the worker to establish a permanent worsening of condition by comparative evidence in order to prove entitlement to a permanent disability award. (Dinnis v. Department of Labor & Indus., 67 Wn.2d 654 (1965)). .In re Maria Chavez, BIIA Dec., 87 0640 (1988) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Yakima County Cause No. 88-2-02121-9.]\n\nIn an appeal from a Department order denying an application to reopen the claim, the Board has jurisdiction to determine whether the worker's disability temporarily worsened during the aggravation period and can award temporary total disability compensation for such period. .In re Junior Wheelock, BIIA Dec., 86 4128 (1987) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Cause No. 88-2-00404-2.]\n\nAlthough the evidence established that the worker's condition was fixed and that there was no increase in permanent disability as of the date the application to reopen the claim was denied, the worker was still entitled to benefits for a temporary worsening of his condition which occurred within the aggravation period. .In re Leon Wheeler, BIIA Dec., 70 344 (1986)\n\nA prior finding that the worker's condition became aggravated requiring reopening of the claim for treatment establishes only a temporary increase in disability. In order to obtain an increased permanent disability award, the worker must still present proof of aggravation resulting in an increase in permanent disability. .In re John Qualls, BIIA Dec., 28,430 (1969) [dissent]\n\n\"APPEALABLE ONLY\" ORDER\n\nSee NOTICE OF APPEAL and PROTEST AND REQUEST FOR RECONSIDERATION\n\nAPPEALABLE ORDERS\n\nAttorney fees for services rendered only before Department\n\nThe Board does not have authority to determine the reasonableness of a fee for an attorney's services rendered before the Department except in conjunction with a request to fix a fee for services rendered in proceedings before the Board. Review of a Department order concerning the reasonableness of the attorney fee for services rendered only before the Department is obtained by application to superior court, not by appeal to the Board. RCW 51.52.120. .In re Charles Langseth, BIIA Dec., 89 2249 (1989)\n\nDepartment agreed exam\n\nIn an employer's appeal taken from a closing order based on a medical examination through which the Department and the worker agreed to resolve the claim, the issue is limited to the appropriateness of the award for permanent partial disability. The decision to resolve the matter by stipulation could not be appealed because RCW 51.52.050 only authorizes appeals from final determinations. The final determination was the order resulting from the examination, not the decision to examine. .In re Anthony Murphy, BIIA Dec., 94 1233 (1996)\n\nWhere a worker agreed to be bound by the results of a Department medical examination, the worker is not foreclosed from appealing the Department's determination since there is no statutory authority to bind parties to a final disposition of the claim. Only the Board has such authority pursuant to RCW 51.52.095, WAC 263-12-093. .In re Rafael Rodriguez, BIIA Dec., 90 3308 (1991)\n\nDepartment order fixing interest pursuant to order of superior court\n\nWhere a worker prevailed in an appeal to superior court regarding a claim for temporary total disability, the responsibility for fixing interest lies with the court pursuant to RCW 51.52.135(3). The Board therefore does not have jurisdiction to review subsequent Department orders paying interest which were apparently entered pursuant to the order of the court. .In re Charles Courneya, BIIA Dec., 89 0845 (1989)\n\nInformal letters\n\nAn electronic secure message sent by the Department to a worker is considered a writing and meets the requirements of RCW 51.52.050 and RCW 51.52.060 for appeal to the Board. .In re Colleen Aldridge, BIIA Dec., 10 15903 (2011)\n\nWhere a worker received a letter determination stating that the rate of time-loss compensation was correct and that a separate order would affirm earlier orders but the worker did not appeal the order subsequently issued, the Board concluded that the order was not res judicata regarding the rate of time-loss compensation for the periods set forth in the order since the letter determination had been appealed. .In re Lucian Saltz, BIIA Dec., 92 4309 (1993)\n\nA letter from a Department auditor informing an employer that premiums are due and requesting payment is an appealable decision under either RCW 51.48.131 or RCW 51.52.050 and .060, even though the letter fails to contain the required statutory language regarding the employer's appeal rights. .In re Maid-For-You, BIIA Dec., 88 4843 (1990)\n\nA letter advising the employer that the Department has accepted the worker's low back condition as causally related to the industrial injury does not constitute a formal statutory order and no res judicata effect attaches to the informal communication if it is not appealed. .In re Kerry Kemery, BIIA Dec., 62,634 (1983)\n\nInterlocutory orders\n\nA worker is aggrieved by an order paying time-loss compensation benefits, even if the Department has designated the decision as temporary, if the worker is disputing the rate of time-loss compensation. .In re Robert Uerling, BIIA Dec., 99 17854 (1999)\n\nThe Department cannot insulate a decision to terminate time-loss compensation from Board review by characterizing the decision as \"interlocutory.\" If the worker desires to appeal such a decision to the Board it is the worker's right to do so. .In re Louise Favaloro, BIIA Dec., 90 5892 (1990)\n\nMinisterial orders\n\nA Department order issued pursuant to a superior court judgment is strictly ministerial and is not appealable to the Board. .In re Alfred Greenwalt, Dec'd, BIIA Dec., 43,070 (1973)\n\nOral decisions\n\nA decision of the Department must be in writing before it can be appealed to the Board. .In re Ryan Lowry, BIIA Dec., 91 C061 (1991)\n\nOrders held in abeyance (RCW 51.52.060)\n\nOnce the Department has exercised its authority to hold a prior order in abeyance, it may not reverse the abeyance order and attempt to avoid its responsibilities to issue a further order. Likewise, the Department may not return an appeal to the Board once it has elected to reassume jurisdiction following the filing of an appeal. .In re Tonja Petersen, BIIA Dec., 12 10440 (2012)\n\nWhere the Department has held an order which has been appealed to the Board in abeyance pending further consideration, it must enter a further order within the time allowed by RCW 51.52.060. However, the failure of the Department to issue a further order within the time allowed does not make the order held in abeyance appealable. Such order is not a final order of the Department. .In re Coni Oakes, BIIA Dec., 90 1968 (1990)\n\nProtest divests Board of authority to hear appeal - See also NOTICE OF APPEAL Protest and notice of appeal\n\nWhen a worker appealed an order containing a statement of “protest rights”, but later filed a protest and request for reconsideration of the same order within the time allowed for protest, the Board lost jurisdiction over the appeal. .In re Mark Fossati, BIIA Dec., 95 1442 (1995) [Editor’s Note: The Board encouraged parties to notify it when they have filed a protest after filing an appeal.]\n\nWhere a Department order included a statement of protest rights as required by RCW 51.52.050, but did not promise the issuance of a further appealable order after the filing of a protest, a protest to that order deprived the Board of jurisdiction. Citing In re Santos Alonzo, BIIA Dec., 56,833 (1981). .In re Glen Fulps, BIIA Dec., 94 7894 (1995)\n\nA protest automatically operates to set aside and hold an order in abeyance pending the issuance of a further appealable order. Thus, even though an appeal from a Department order had already been filed by the worker, the employer's subsequent but timely protest of the order appealed leaves the Board without jurisdiction to hear the worker's appeal. .In re John Robinson, BIIA Dec., 59,454 (1982)\n\nWhen a Department order promises that a further appealable order will be issued if a protest is filed, a timely protest automatically sets the order aside and holds it in abeyance. The Board therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the original order since it is not a final order. .In re Santos Alonzo, BIIA Dec., 56,833 (1981)\n\nProvisional time-loss compensation orders (RCW 51.32.210) - See also APPEALABLE ORDERS Interlocutory orders\n\nOrders of the Department paying provisional time-loss compensation, entered prior to the issuance of an order rejecting or allowing the claim on its merits, are not final orders of the Department under RCW 51.52.050 and .060. Until the Department issues a determinative order either rejecting or allowing the claim, the payment of provisional time-loss compensation cannot be challenged by an appeal to the Board. .In re Ruth Logan, BIIA Dec., 89 0189 (1989)\n\nSelf-insured employer's order (RCW 51.32.055)\n\nA closing order issued by self-insured employer under the authority of RCW 51.32.055(7)(a) may conditionally close the claim. The closure is subject to reevaluation by the Department within two years on the basis that the claim was improperly or prematurely closed. .In re Noel Bray, Jr., BIIA Dec., 89 2484 (1991) [dissent] [Editor's Note: The provisions cited apply only to claims accepted by self-insurers after June 30, 1986 and before July 1, 1990--the window period expressed in RCW 51.32.055(7)(d) does not apply to claims accepted after June 30, 1990 and closed with medical treatment only.]\n\nAn order issued by a self-insured employer under the authority of RCW 51.32.055(7)(c) is not appealable to the Board, notwithstanding the fact the order may state otherwise. However, the further determinative order of the Department which must be issued following the filing of a protest with the Department is appealable to the Board. .In re Laverne Alvarado, BIIA Dec., 87 4566 (1988)\n\nTemporary orders\n\nThe worker is allowed to litigate entitlement to time-loss compensation after the Department changes an order closing the claim and terminating time-loss from final to \"temporary.\" The Department cannot isolate a decision to terminate time-loss compensation from Board review by characterizing it as a temporary decision. .In re Tony Perry, BIIA Dec., 03 19142 (2004) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Kitsap County Cause No. 05-2-0140-3.]\n\nAPPLICATION FOR BENEFITS\n\nApplication to reopen treated as accident report\n\nAn application to reopen a claim for a prior injury, filed within one year of a new injury, may properly be considered as a claim for that new injury where information concerning the new incident has been supplied to the Department. .In re Stanley Lee, BIIA Dec., 09,425 (1959) [Editor's Note: See also In re John Svicarovich, BIIA Dec., 08,205 (1957), APPLICATION TO REOPEN CLAIM.]\n\nReasonable notification\n\nA worker's letter to the Department explaining that he had injured his back the day before he suffered from an accepted injury described as \"heat\" coupled with a letter from a physician's assistant indicating that the worker was seen for heat exhaustion and back pain constitute an application for benefits within the meaning of RCW 51.28.020. .In re Leroy Norris, BIIA Dec., 92 1471 (1993)\n\nWhen an application for benefits identified two dates within a week of each other that injuries had occurred, the reference to the earlier injury in medical notes attached to the application for benefits in the second injury constituted a filing of a request for benefits because it reasonably put the Department on notice of the earlier alleged industrial injury. .In re Charles Pierce, BIIA Dec., 91 4625 (1993) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Pierce County Cause No. 91-2-07862-4.]\n\nAPPLICATION TO REOPEN CLAIM\n\nAccident report treated as application to reopen\n\nAn accident report may constitute an application to reopen for aggravation of condition where the Department has not been misled or prejudiced.

Department of Labor & Indus., 35 Wn.2d 151 (1949)), but the Department may not require a worker to submit an application to reopen by using a particular form (WAC 296-14-400).

While we continue to honor stare decisis, we will grant equitable relief where the circumstances are appropriate and within those situations and guidelines set out by our courts; honoring stare decisis does not require we only apply the doctrine in cases with such similar facts as to be almost identical. In doing so, we are not creating equitable remedies, but granting them where our courts have determined them applicable. .In re Lyle Applegate, Order Vacating Proposed Decision and Order, BIIA Dec., 18 16730 (2019)\n\nBecause RCW 51.12.070(5) is only one of the criteria to be met by a contractor seeking exemption from responsibility of a subcontractor's premiums, the satisfaction of subsection (5) does not allow for the application of \"equitable estoppel\" to dispose of the obligation to meet other criteria for the prime contractor exception under RCW 51.12.070. .In re GT Drywall, BIIA Dec., 10 11537 (2011) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Clark County Cause No. 11-2-00562-7.]\n\nIn order to be entitled to equitable relief for failing to file a timely protest, a worker must satisfy a two-part test to excuse the untimely filing. The worker must first establish that the worker is illiterate in English and unable to ascertain and/or understand the nature and contents of the order; and second, the worker must establish some misconduct in communication of the order on the part of the Department if it knew or should have known that the worker was illiterate in English. .In re Adela Gonzalez, BIIA Dec., 05 23236 (2006)\n\nThe principles of equitable estoppel are applied only under the principle of stare decisis. Where there has been no determination by a court of final jurisdiction applying equitable estoppel to excuse an untimely filing under RCW 51.28.050, the Board will not apply the doctrine to a situation where the worker alleges that the Department employees improperly informed him of the requirements for filing an application for benefits. Additionally, the record failed to establish that the inaccurate statements caused injury to the worker, that the failure to timely apply for benefits was due to the worker's own mistake.

In so doing the Board is not creating an equitable remedy, but following precedent. In re Lyle Applegate, BIIA Dec., 18 16730 (2019).]\n\nBecause the courts have applied equitable estoppel against the state, if there is no question or doubt as to the extent of the Board's jurisdiction in a particular case, the Board may apply the doctrine under the principle of stare decisis in the same manner as it applies other principles of law. Estoppel will apply in proper circumstances against the Department, in its role as a taxing agency, and reliance, if reasonable, may be placed upon both the silence and non-action of the state where it ought to speak, as well as upon affirmative statements and actions. .In re State Roofing & Insulation, BIIA Dec., 89 1770 (1991) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Snohomish County Cause No. 91-2-01375-4.

Where an industrial appeals judge declined to accept the parties' stipulation after the hearing date on the basis that issuance of a proposed decision and order, dismissing the matter for failure to present evidence when due, was merely a ministerial act, the proposed decision and order should be vacated and an order, based upon the agreement of parties, entered. .In re John Herrin, BIIA Dec., 89 5253 (1991)\n\nPetition for review\n\nRCW 51.52.104 and WAC 263-12-145 require a petition for review set forth the details of grounds for relief, and legal theory relied on, and citation of authority and/or argument in support of any legal theory. Failure to comply with these minimum requirements could result in denial of the petition based on non-compliance. .In re Muhamed Mujic, BIIA Dec., 16 15373 (2017) [dissent]\n\nWhen a petition for review is filed, the scope of the Board's review extends to all contested issues of law and fact and is not limited to the specific issues raised by the petition for review. .In re Richard Sims, BIIA Dec., 85 1748 (1986) [Editor's note: But See, Soriano v. Dep't of Labor & Indus., 3526-4 III (April 11, 2019).]\n\nAn order denying an appeal cannot be petitioned to the Board but must be appealed to superior court. [RCW 51.52.080] .In re Sandra Walster (II), BIIA Dec., 43,049, (11/73)\n\nReassignment of Industrial Appeals Judge\n\nParties to an appeal may file an affidavit of prejudice to disqualify an industrial appeals judge assigned to conduct hearings, but after the hearings have been completed by one judge, the parties may not disqualify a judge who was reassigned solely for the purpose of issuing a Proposed Decision and Order. .In re Gail Gomez, BIIA Dec., 17 15610 (2018) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under King County Cause No. 19-2-00765-6 KNT.]\n\nWhen a case is reassigned from one judge to another, the expectation is that the new judge will exercise independent judgment and take whatever further steps he or she deems appropriate. .In re Nathan Rosentrater, BIIA Dec., 08 20200 (2009)\n\nRemand for additional evidence\n\nWhere parties had agreed to be bound by the results of a Board-sponsored medical examination, the industrial appeals judge did not follow the ordinary procedures for obtaining the examination, the worker asked for the opportunity to cross-examine the physician, and the industrial appeals judge issued a proposed decision and order without ruling on the motion, the Board vacated the proposed decision and order and remanded for further proceedings. .In re Miles Ulrich, Order Vacating Proposed Decision and Order and Remanding Appeal for Hearing, BIIA Dec., 93 1363 (1994)\n\nWhere the Department received a call indicating a worker was employed during the period the worker received loss of earning power benefits, the call raised the question of mistake as to the amount of benefits properly payable but did not establish fraud and motion for summary judgment should have been denied. As a result, the Board remanded to hearing process to determine whether an overpayment existed and if so, whether the benefits were fraudulently obtained. .In re Sherryl Schank, Order Setting Aside Proposed Decision and Order, BIIA Dec., 90 1542 (1991) [dissent]\n\nWhere the employer has received notices of proceedings but failed to appear, it has waived its right to present evidence and the Board will not remand the appeal for further hearings to permit the employer to do so. .In re Joseph Benoit, BIIA Dec., 35,483 (1971)\n\nRemands from Superior Court\n\nRCW 51.52.115 indicates that the Superior Court, in case of modification or reversal of the Board's order, should refer its order to the Department, not the Board, and to direct the Department to act in accordance with the court's findings. In the circumstances of this case, the Superior Court order directed the Board to issue an order directing the Department to issue an order reopening the claim for aggravation of the condition causally related to the industrial injury, paying time-loss compensation benefits, with a permanent partial disability, reduced by an overpayment, denying responsibility for a condition identified as thoracic outlet syndrome, and thereupon closing the claim. .In re Daniel Hatch, BIIA Dec., 63 150 (1992)\n\nResponse to petition for review\n\nThe ten day time period set forth in WAC 263-12-145(3) for filing a response to a petition for review is not jurisdictional. The Board may therefore consider a response filed after the ten day period has elapsed. .In re Daniel Furlong, BIIA Dec., 65,138 (1985)\n\nSanctions - See SANCTIONS\n\nScope of review - See SCOPE OF REVIEW Closing Order\n\nStay of proceedings\n\nThe Board need not suspend proceedings in the worker's appeal where the employer served the Board a bankruptcy court's stay in an industrial insurance appeal where the employer is not self-insured but participates in the state fund since the presence or absence of the employer from the proceeding has no impact on the adequacy of the statutory relief available. Citing Matter of Johns-Manville Corp., 99 Wn.2d 193 (1983). .In re Mary Propst, BIIA Dec., 92 2186 (1993) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Snohomish County Cause No. 93-2-06468-1.]\n\nSubpoena\n\nWhere a physician has developed an opinion as an expert and has expressed that opinion, a subpoena should not be refused solely on the ground that the physician has refused to speak with the litigant or the litigant is unable to pay other than the statutory witness fee. In re Ronald Baker, BIIA Dec., 99 21232 (2001)\n\nSubstitution of parties\n\nIn the circumstance where a worker died while the appeal was pending and the survivor proves the spousal relationship, and establishes that an application for survivors’ benefits has been filed with the Department, the spouse will be substituted as the appealing party and is entitled to pursue any benefits to which the deceased worker may have been entitled. .In re William Zygarliski, Dec'd, BIIA Dec., 89 1094 (1990)\n\nSummary judgment\n\nSummary judgment may be granted in favor of a non-moving party where there is no genuine issue of material fact. .In re Cristobal Leal, BIIA Dec., 15 21241 (2017)\n\nBecause a determination of genuine doubt goes to the state of mind, summary judgment is not appropriate when considering whether an employer had a genuine doubt as to its need to pay benefits. .In re Donica Drachenberg, BIIA Dec., 16 12263 (2016)\n\nBefore granting a motion for summary judgment the parties have a right to a hearing on the motion and must expressly waive that right before the judge can issue a ruling without conducting a hearing. .In re Edwin Makotsi, BIIA Dec., 15 20961 (2016)\n\nA declaration in support of summary judgment is insufficient if opinions are not related to the critical date or contain only conclusory opinions, without the requisite supporting facts showing the basis for those opinions. When a declaration is deficient, the opposing party is not required to file a responsive declaration from a medical expert. .In re Nathan Rosentrater, BIIA Dec., 08 20200 (2009)\n\nTo raise an issue of credibility on a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must present contradictory evidence or otherwise impeach the evidence of the moving party. The non?moving party may not rely on speculation or argumentative assertions to establish an issue of material fact. .In re David Gruger, BIIA Dec., 08 14143 (2009)\n\nThe Board has the authority to resolve appeals, in whole or in part, by summary judgment. RCW 51.52.140; WAC 263-12-125; CR 56. .In re David Potts, BIIA Dec., 88 3822 (1989)\n\nSummary judgment - time limits\n\nSummary judgment is not appropriate when the motion was filed later than permitted under CR 56 and the worker failed to establish that there were no issues of material fact. CR 56 does not provide for discretion with respect to filing timelines, the only discretion permitted is with respect to the requirement that the motion be heard more than 14 days before the hearing. .In re Duane Harper, BIIA Dec., 99 11127 (2000)\n\nTelephone hearings\n\nAn industrial appeals judge has discretion to determine in what circumstances telephone testimony will be allowed over the objection of a party. Factors impacting that decision include objections related to oath giving and verification of the witness's identity, and assessing credibility. Oath giving and identification are germane only to objections based on concerns that the witness may not be who they purport to be. Objections related to assessing credibility should be tempered by the realities of the appeal process where the Board members or the court or jury are the ultimate assessors of credibility, not the industrial appeals judge. .In re Peter Kim, BIIA Dec.,00 21147 (2002) [Editor's note: See also WAC 263-12-115(10).]\n\nTranscript corrections\n\nIf a party believes there is an error in the transcript, the party should file a motion with the industrial appeals judge, who will then hold a proceeding and place the burden on the moving party to explain why the transcript is in error and should be changed. .In re Cascade Utilities, BIIA Dec., 04 W1392 (2006) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under King County Cause No. 06-2-38556-0 SEA.]\n\nTwo member Board\n\nThe Department order must stand when the Board is reduced to two voting members who disagree on the disposition of the appeal. .In re Herbert Thomas, BIIA Dec., 42,061 (1973) [Editor's Note: But see Dep't of Ecology v. City of Kirkland, 84 Wn.2d 25 (1974).]\n\nBURDEN OF PROOF\n\nSee also MOTION TO DISMISS\n\nAbandonment\n\nWhen the Department rejects a claim for survivor's benefits on the grounds of abandonment, the Department has the burden of proving abandonment. .In re Loren Snavely, Dec'd, BIIA Dec., 95 7778 (1997) Citing Johnson v. Department of Labor & Indus., 3 Wn.2d 257 (1940).\n\nEmployer appeal\n\nIn an employer's appeal, the employer must present a prima facie case which includes the fact that it filed a timely appeal. If the defending party asserts the affirmative defense of res judicata, the defending party has the burden of establishing the facts supporting the defense. .In re Jimmy Rice, BIIA Dec., 12 14962 (2013)\n\nIn an employer appeal, when the Department or worker moves to dismiss for failure by the employer to make a prima facie case, the Department or worker may rest on their motion or choose to present evidence. Proceeding in this manner does not relieve the employer of its burden. Overruling In re Christine Guttromson, BIIA Dec., 55,804 (1981) to the extent it holds that there does not need to be a determination as to whether the employer presented a prima facie case if the claimant does not rest on its motion. .In re Kathleen Stevenson, BIIA Dec., 11 13592 (2012) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to King County Superior Court No. 12-2-29291-4KNT.]\n\nIn an employer appeal, the employer must first present evidence sufficient to make a prima facie case. The burden then shifts to the worker to establish her entitlement to benefits by a preponderance of the evidence. .In re Christine Guttromson, BIIA Dec., 55,804 (1981) [Editor's Note: The language in the order erroneously refers to the burden shifting to the claimant when the claimant chose to present evidence. To the extent it is inconsistent, Guttromson was overruled by In Re Kathleen Stevenson, BIIA Dec., 11 13592 (2012).]\n\nFraud  See FRAUD Burden of Proof\n\nHearing loss\n\nWhen the evidence shows that a worker continued to be placed in a noisy work environment after the date of a given audiogram, the burden shifts to the employer to show by persuasive evidence that the subsequent workplace noise was not injurious to the workers hearing. .In re Eugene Williams, BIIA Dec., 95 3780 (1998) [dissent] [Editor's Note: The burden-shifting requirement set forth by the Board in Williams was reversed by the Washington State Supreme Court in Boeing v. Heidy 147 Wn.2d 78 (2002).]\n\nInjury  See INJURY Burden of Proof\n\nNew in-home healthcare\n\nIn an appeal by the claimant to a Department determination rescinding authorization of an in-home healthcare provider to provide care to the claimant, the claimant had the burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the Department should not have rescinded the provider's authority to provide services. .In re Tim Potterf, BIIA Dec., 10 18174 (2011)\n\nPresumption in RCW 51.32.185\n\nThe presumption that certain cancers are related to employment as a firefighter shifts the burden of production and persuasion to the Department or self-insured employer. Citing Spivey v. City of Bellevue, 187 Wn.2d 716 (2017). The presumption can be overcome by a preponderance of evidence that established the cancer was not caused by exposures in the course of employment as a firefighter.\n\n.In re Daniel Apodaca, BIIA Dec., 19 11160 (2020) [dissent]\n\nPresumption under RCW 51.32.187\n\nThe lack of causation data does not mean that an association between the worker's medical condition and exposure to radiation or chemicals does not exist. The Board held that the employer failed to rebut the RCW 51.32.187 presumption by the requisite clear and convincing evidence standard of proof. ....In re Amy Elsey, BIIA Dec., 19 25936 (2022)[dissent] [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Benton County Cause No. 22-2-00430-03.]\n\nIn a Hanford appeal, just as in any other appeal at the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals, to overcome a CR 41(b)(3) motion, the party with the burden of production must establish a prima facie casesubstantial evidence which, if unrebutted, would convince an unprejudiced, thinking mind of the truth of the issues on appeal. The Board will follow the Morgan theory of presumptions in claims arising under RCW 51.32.187. Accordingly, RCW 51.32.187 shifts both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion (proof) to the employer, in this case, DOE. .In re Glenn Hannaman Jr., Dec'd, BIIA Dec., 19 12787 (2021) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Benton County Cause No. 21-2-01716-3]\n\nWISHA appeals  See SAFETY & HEALTH Burden of Proof\n\nWISHA  failure to abate  See SAFETY & HEALTH Burden of Proof-failure to abate\n\nVocational Rehabilitation  See VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION Burden of Proof\n\nCAUSAL RELATIONSHIP\n\nSee also AGGRAVATION, PERMANENT TOTAL DISABILITY, and SUBSEQUENT CONDITION TRACEABLE TO ORIGINAL INJURY\n\nAudiologist\n\nAudiologists may testify about the causation of a condition if their opinion is admissible under ER 702 using the analysis from Frausto v. Yakima HMA, 188 Wn.2d 227 (2017). Overruling In re Virgil Degolier, BIIA Dec., 60,471 (1983). .In re Dean Babbitt, BIIA Dec., 18 20492 (2020)\n\nHearing loss must be established by medical evidence. The testimony of an audiologist is therefore insufficient to make a prima facie case for causal relationship and extent of permanent partial disability. .In re Virgil Degolier,BIIA Dec., 60,471 (1983) [Editor's Note: Consider the effect of the analysis of ER 702 contained in Frausto v. Yakima HMA, 188 Wn.2d 227 (2017) on this decision.]\n\nChiropractor\n\nFollowing the amendment of RCW 18.25.006, chiropractors are allowed to treat upper and lower extremities and can testify about causation of upper and lower extremity conditions as matters within the scope of chiropractic practice. .In re Tami Lynn, BIIA Dec., 09 16657 (2010)\n\nBecause the low back is a part of the anatomy falling within the special field of chiropractic, a chiropractor may testify to the causal relationship between the worker's low back condition and the injury. .In re Ernest Pfenniger, BIIA Dec., 41,425 (1973) [dissent]\n\nChiropractic testimony is sufficient to establish a prima facie case for a causal relationship between an industrial injury and the worker's low back condition, since the treatment of low back conditions is within the \"special field\" of chiropractic. .In re H.U. Shipley, BIIA Dec., 08,043 (1957)\n\nExpert Testimony\n\nPhysical therapists may testify about the causation of a condition if their opinion is admissible under ER 702 using the analysis from Frausto v. Yakima HMA, 188 Wn.2d 227 (2017). Overruling In re Juan Muñoz, BIIA Dec., 05 11698 (2007). .In re Adele Palmer, BIIA Dec., 16 16600 (2017)\n\nPhysical therapist\n\nPhysical therapists may testify about the causation of a condition if their opinion is admissible under ER 702 using the analysis from Frausto v. Yakima HMA, 188 Wn.2d 227 (2017). Overruling In re Juan Muñoz, BIIA Dec., 05 11698 (2007). .In re Adele Palmer, BIIA Dec., 16 16600 (2017)\n\nA physical therapist is not qualified to render opinions of medical causation. .In re Juan Muñoz, BIIA Dec., 05 11698 (2007) [Editor's Note: Overruled In re Adele Palmer, BIIA Dec., 16 16600 (2017). The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under King County Cause No.07-2-38541-0KNT.]\n\nPhysician's Assistant\n\nBecause the Department's medical aid rules permit a physician's assistant to render opinions on causation, a physician's assistant's opinion is a sufficient expert opinion to prove causation of a diagnosed condition. .In re Evelyn Woods, BIIA Dec., 07 23506 (2009)\n\nPsychologist\n\nPsychologist diagnoses of certain mental health conditions not listed in DSM-IV were within the psychologists' scope of practice and were valid diagnoses of the worker's conditions caused by the exposure at work. .In re Diana Gegg, BIIA Dec., 08 16647 (2010)\n\nA licensed clinical psychologist is competent to testify on the issue of the cause of mental conditions. .In re Robert Hedblum, BIIA Dec., 88 2237 (1989) [Editor's Note: The Board's decision was appealed to superior court under Thurston County Cause No. 89-2-02751-5.]\n\nCHIROPRACTORS\n\nSee CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP\n\nCOLLATERAL ESTOPPEL\n\nSee also RES JUDICATA\n\nDepartment order in another claim\n\nWhere the worker filed both an application to reopen a prior claim for aggravation of condition and a new claim, the Department's denial of the application to reopen for the reason that the worker had sustained a new injury did not establish, as a matter of law, that the worker had sustained a new industrial injury. .In re Will"
