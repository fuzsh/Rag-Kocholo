Hoping that he might be alive, he attempted to land on absolutely unsafe ground at very close range fire from the enemy, but after touching the ground 12 yards from the crashed machine he saw at once that no hope could be entertained that the occupant was alive, by reason of the condition of the wreck, and he was accordingly compelled to abandon further action. The attempt at rescue involved much risk, as had he actually landed it is improbable that he would have been able to take off again, apart from the attention which the tribesmen would have given him at that time.\n\nCORYTON, William Alex, F/L\n\nMember, Royal Victorian Order awarded as per London Gazette dated 8 August 1919.
