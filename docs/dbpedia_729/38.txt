This is a list of personnel who received the Navy Cross for events after the Vietnam War.

Navy Cross[]

The Navy Cross is the second-highest military decoration of the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. It is received by personnel who distinguish themselves for extraordinary heroism in combat with an armed enemy force.[1] The medal is equivalent to the Army's Distinguished Service Cross, the Air Force and Space Force's Air Force Cross, and the Coast Guard Cross.

The Navy Cross is bestowed by the Secretary of the Navy and may also be awarded to members of other armed services, and to foreign military personnel while serving with the U.S. naval services. The Navy Cross was established by Act of Congress (Public Law 65-253) and approved on February 4, 1919.

Operation Just Cause recipients[]

The United States Invasion of Panama, more commonly referred to as Operation Just Cause, was the invasion of Panama by the United States in December 1989. It occurred during the administration of U.S. President George H. W. Bush, and ten years after the Torrijos–Carter Treaties were ratified to transfer control of the Panama Canal from the United States to Panama by 1 January 2000.

During the invasion, the de facto Panamanian leader, general and dictator Manuel Noriega was deposed and was replaced by president-elect Guillermo Endara. In addition, the Panamanian Defense Force was dissolved.

During this action two people from Seal team 4 received the Navy Cross for their actions during the conflict.

Operation Urgent Fury recipient[]

The United States invasion of Grenada, also known as Operation Urgent Fury, began at dawn on 25 October 1983. The United States and a coalition of six Caribbean nations invaded the island nation of Grenada, 100 miles (160 km) north of Venezuela. It resulted in military occupation within a few days.[4] It was triggered by the strife within the People's Revolutionary Government which resulted in the house arrest and execution of the previous leader and second Prime Minister of Grenada Maurice Bishop, and the establishment of the Revolutionary Military Council with Hudson Austin as Chairman. The invasion resulted in the appointment of an interim government, followed by elections in 1984.

The Reagan administration launched the military intervention operation following receipt of a formal appeal for help from the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. In addition, the Governor-General of Grenada Paul Scoon secretly signaled he would also support outside intervention, but he put off signing a letter of invitation until 26 October.[5] Reagan also acted due to "concerns over the 600 U.S. medical students on the island" and fears of a repeat of the Iran hostage crisis.

During this action one Marine Captain with HMM-261, 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit named Jeb H. Seagle posthumously received the Navy Cross (United States).

Operation Desert Storm recipients[]

The Gulf War was an armed campaign waged by a United States-led coalition of 35 countries against Iraq in response to the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait.

On 2 August 1990, the Iraqi military invaded the neighboring State of Kuwait, and fully occupied the country within two days. Throughout much of the 1980s, Kuwait's oil production was above its mandatory OPEC quota, which kept international oil prices down.[7] Iraq interpreted Kuwait's refusal to decrease its oil production as an act of aggression towards the Iraqi economy.[8] The invasion of Kuwait was met with international condemnation, and economic sanctions against Iraq were immediately imposed by the United Nations Security Council in response. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher[9] and American president George H. W. Bush deployed troops and equipment into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. In response to the call, an array of nations joined the U.S.-led coalition, forming the largest military alliance since World War II. The bulk of the coalition's military forces were from the United States, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and Egypt as the largest lead-up contributors, in that order. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US$32 billion of the US$60 billion cost.[10]

The war marked the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle, principally by the American network CNN.[11][12][13]

Operation Inherent Resolve recipients[]

Operation Inherent Resolve is the U.S. military's operational name for the International military intervention against ISIL,[16] including both a campaign in Iraq and a campaign in Syria, with a closely-related campaign in Libya. Through 18 September 2018, the U.S. Army's III Armored Corps was responsible for Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF—OIR) and were replaced by the XVIII Airborne Corps.[17] The campaign is primarily waged by American air forces in support of local allies, most prominently the Iraqi security forces and Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Combat ground troops, mostly special forces and artillery, have also been deployed, especially in Iraq. Of the airstrikes, 75–80% have been conducted by the military of the United States, with the other 20–25% by the United Kingdom, France, Turkey, Canada, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Australia and Jordan.[18]

According to the Pentagon, by March 2019, the day of the territorial defeat in Syria of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), CJTF-OIR and its partner forces had liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles) of land and 7.7 million people from ISIL, the vast majority of the self-proclaimed caliphate's territory and subjects.[19] By October 2017, around the time of ISIL's territorial defeat in Iraq, CJTF-OIR claimed that around 80,000 ISIL militants had been killed by it and its allies (excluding those targeted by Russian and Syrian Air Force strikes). By the end of August 2019, it had conducted 34,573 strikes.[20][21] Tens of thousands more were killed by partner forces on the ground (the SDF alone claimed to have killed 25,336 ISIL fighters by the end of 2017).[22]

Iraq War recipients[]

The Iraq War was a protracted armed conflict in Iraq from 2003 to 2011 that began with the invasion of Iraq by the United States–led coalition which overthrew the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the coalition forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government.[28] US troops were officially withdrawn in 2011. The United States became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition, and the insurgency and many dimensions of the armed conflict continue today. The invasion occurred as part of the George W. Bush administration's War on Terror following the September 11 attacks.

In October 2002, Congress granted President Bush the power to decide whether to launch any military attack in Iraq.[29] The Iraq War began on 20 March 2003,[30] when the US, joined by the UK, Australia, and Poland, launched a "shock and awe" bombing campaign. Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as coalition forces swept through the country. The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist government; Saddam Hussein was captured during Operation Red Dawn in December of that same year and executed three years later. The power vacuum following Saddam's demise and mismanagement by the Coalition Provisional Authority led to widespread civil war between Shias and Sunnis, as well as a lengthy insurgency against coalition forces. The United States responded with a build-up of 170,000 troops in 2007.[31] This build-up gave greater control to Iraq's government and military, and was judged a success by many.[32] In 2008, President Bush agreed to a withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq. The withdrawal was completed under President Barack Obama in December 2011.[33][34]

An estimated 151,000 to 1,033,000 Iraqis died in the first three to five years of conflict. In total, the war caused at least one hundred thousand civilian deaths, as well as tens of thousands of military deaths (see estimates below). The majority of deaths occurred as a result of the insurgency and civil conflicts between 2004 and 2007. Subsequently, the War in Iraq of 2013 to 2017, which is considered a domino effect of the invasion and occupation, caused at least 155,000 deaths, in addition to the displacement of more than 3.3 million people within the country.[35][36][37]

War in Afghanistan recipients[]

Operation Enduring Freedom was the official name used by the U.S. government for the Global War on Terrorism, primarily referring to the War in Afghanistan[61][62]. On 7 October 2001, in response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush announced that airstrikes targeting Al-Qaeda and the Taliban had begun in Afghanistan.[63]

On 28 December 2014, after 13 years of conflict in the region, President Barack Obama announced the end of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.[64] Subsequent operations in Afghanistan by the United States' military forces, both non-combat and combat, occurred under the name Operation Freedom's Sentinel until 30 August 2021 when President Joe Biden ordered the remaining US troops to evacuate in a controversial withdrawal.[65]

2012 Benghazi attack[]

The 2012 Benghazi attack was a coordinated attack against two United States government facilities in Benghazi, Libya, by members of the Islamic militant group Ansar al-Sharia.

On September 11, 2012, at 9:40pm local time, members of Ansar al-Sharia attacked the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi resulting in the deaths of both United States Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith.[92][21]

At around 4:00 a.m. on September 12, the group launched a mortar attack against a CIA annex approximately one mile (1.6 km) away, killing two CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty[21][93][94] and wounding ten others. Initial analysis by the CIA, repeated by top government officials, indicated that the attack spontaneously arose from a protest.[95] Subsequent investigations showed that the attack was premeditated—although rioters and looters not originally part of the group may have joined in after the attacks began.[96][97][98]
