        "text": "By of the\n\nAurora Health Care has spent more than $150 million to move to electronic health records since it began the arduous task 15 years ago.\n\nThe foundation for its system, spanning its hospitals throughout eastern Wisconsin, has been software from Cerner Corp. Aurora was one of the company's first large customers.\n\nYet this year, Aurora decided to replace its system with one designed by Cerner's biggest competitor, Epic Systems Corp. in Verona.\n\nThe move will cost Aurora more than $100 million and take at least three years.\n\nIt suggests Epic's enviable position in its market as federal incentives spur health care systems to convert to electronic health records.\n\n\"Right now, Epic is winning three to four times more than anyone else,\" said Kent Gale, chairman of KLAS Enterprises LLC, a research firm known in the industry for its customer surveys.\n\nProHealth Care in Waukesha also decided this year to replace its existing software, made by a unit of GE Healthcare, with Epic.\n\n\"From everything I hear, Epic really is the best system in the market today,\" said Robert Mlynarek, ProHealth's chief financial officer. \"And if you measure them by their sales, they are just killing everyone now.\"\n\nEpic is projected to end the year with roughly $780 million in revenue. That's up from $650 million last year and $47 million in 2000.\n\nIts workforce has grown from 396 people in 2000 to about 4,000 today. It has added 500 people this year alone. All but a few dozen of them work in Verona, and its Wisconsin payroll this year will top $300 million.\n\nStarted in 1979 with an initial investment of $70,000, privately held Epic now has an estimated market value of $2.6 billion.\n\nEpic's market also is suddenly booming.\n\nHealth care systems throughout the country are scrambling to be eligible for additional payments available next year to hospitals and doctors that have moved from paper to electronic health records.\n\nPurchases of full systems doubled last year, according to KLAS.\n\nTo be eligible for the incentives, though, hospitals and doctors must show they are making \"meaningful use\" of their systems, such as tracking quality measures. Those requirements get progressively stricter between 2011 and 2015.\n\nThey also have prodded health care systems to question whether to invest in their existing systems - some of which have been pieced together over the years - or start anew.\n\nAurora and ProHealth aren't alone in deciding that starting anew is the wiser move.\n\nYale School of Medicine and the Yale-New Haven Health System, which has systems from a hodgepodge of vendors at its three hospitals, signed a multiyear contract with Epic this summer.\n\n\"It has been one of our busiest years in the number of customers who have joined Epic,\" said Sam Butler, a physician with the company.\n\n'Ripping and replacing'\n\nEpic's market is large health care systems and hospitals. It's particularly strong in academic medical centers, including University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, Froedtert Health and the Medical College of Wisconsin.\n\nOther customers include the Cleveland Clinic, Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York and the University of Chicago Medical Center. Its software also underpins Kaiser Permanente's multibillion-dollar conversion to electronic health records, the largest private health information project in the country.\n\nAs recently as a few years ago, the conventional view was that nearly all of the market for large health systems had been claimed and that no one would want to go through the ordeal of \"ripping and replacing\" their existing systems.\n\nThat hasn't been the case.\n\nOne of Epic's strengths is the company has grown organically and patiently, steadily adding new features and applications to its software. That has enabled it to offer customers an integrated system that links hospitals, clinics and home health care as well as handles billing and other tasks.\n\nIn contrast, many of its competitors have grown partly through acquisitions, stitching different features or applications into their systems over the years. The result can be more complexity and more problems. And many competitors' systems lack features offered by Epic.\n\n\"They have all the pieces,\" said Gale, whose firm was among those hired by Aurora to help with its decision.\n\nEpic also has a strong following among doctors based in clinics. And they can have considerable influence when a health care system is weighing whether to move to one system for both its hospitals and clinics.\n\n\"The docs have the power,\" said Bret Jones, an analyst with Brean Murray, Carret & Co.\n\nEpic's system isn't for everyone. Epic doesn't sell its software to small hospitals or to independent physician practices. And its system is more complex and costly.\n\nMaking full use of all its features requires more training, Gale said. And some of its specialized products, such as those for oncology and radiology, still need work.\n\nThe complexity of Epic's system is another challenge, said Rick Gillis, chief medical information officer for Froedtert Health and director of the Office of Clinical Informatics at the Medical College of Wisconsin.\n\n\"They are leading the industry,\" Gillis said. \"That doesn't mean the product is perfect. There still is a great deal of work to be done.\"\n\nAurora switches systems\n\nEpic's main competitor is Cerner, based in North Kansas City, Mo. The company, twice the size of Epic, is the country's largest developer of software for electronic health records. It also has had a longstanding relationship with Aurora.\n\nThat's partly why the industry has taken note of Aurora's decision. It wasn't made lightly.\n\n\"This is a huge decision,\" said Philip Loftus, Aurora's chief information officer. \"You want to make sure you are right.\"\n\nAurora's buying Advanced Healthcare, one of the largest physician practices in the Milwaukee area, had a key role. Advanced Healthcare has had an Epic system for more than a decade. Aurora briefly gave thought to linking the two systems but realized that it needed one fully integrated system.\n\nIt then began talking to doctors and others who were familiar with Cerner and Epic systems.\n\n\"There was a huge preference for Epic,\" Loftus said.\n\nEpic's system includes a popular feature, MyChart, that enables patients to make their own appointments and get lab results through a secure Web portal. Aurora's system has a similar feature, but Aurora wrote much of the software itself.\n\nCerner's product for home health care also is not integrated with its main system.\n\n\"That was important to us,\" Loftus said. \"We had always wanted to integrate it with our hospitals and clinics.\"\n\nEpic's billing system was another advantage. Aurora uses billing software from different companies for its hospitals and clinics instead of Cerner's software. Maintaining and integrating three different systems would be a costly and ongoing headache.\n\n\"Cerner can't cover the whole circle, and Epic can,\" Gale said.\n\nNow the challenge for Epic could be managing its growth.\n\nEpic consistently has ranked first for customer service in the KLAS surveys. It also has gotten faster at installing its system. And it has more than a decade of experience with rapid growth.\n\n\"So far, Epic has been able to keep up,\" said Gillis of Froedtert Health and the Medical College of Wisconsin. \"But it is a concern.\"\n\nThe company will face the demands of not only its existing customers but also new customers as both work to meet the federal requirements for the incentive payments.\n\nIt will mean an onslaught of business in coming years. But that's a problem that many companies in today's economy would welcome.\n\n\"At the moment,\" Gillis said, \"they seem to be cleaning up.\""
