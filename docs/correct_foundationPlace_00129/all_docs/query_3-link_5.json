        "text": "About Madison Community Foundation\n\nThe mission of Madison Community Foundation is to engage Greater Madison in philanthropy to advance a more vibrant and equitable community.\n\nCreated in 1942 as Madison Community Trust, MCF helps people do their charitable giving their way, to causes they care about most. By starting a named endowment fund, or by giving to a Community Impact Fund, a fund that supports their favorite cause or nonprofit, or leaving a permanent legacy of support, donors become catalysts for good today and for generations to come.\n\nAs the communityâ€™s foundation, MCF plays a vital role in local philanthropy. MCF is unique in its deep knowledge of the community and its philanthropic expertise. But what makes a community foundation strong is the community of donors who come together through it. Together with donors and the nonprofits they support, MCF strives to help the Madison area become a vibrant and generous place where all people thrive. (Learn about MCF's Mission, Vision and Values.)\n\nMCF is a tax-exempt, 501(c)(3) community trust, as designated by the Internal Revenue Service. Contributions are deductible to the fullest extent of the law. Endowment fund assets are invested in either a broadly diversified or socially responsive portfolio. Charitable distributions can be made to any charity throughout the United States, and can benefit people and support charitable causes close to home and around the world.\n\nAbout Community Foundations\n\nCommunity foundations are charitable organizations created through gifts from people who care about a particular community or geographic area. At MCF, over 90% of gifts go into endowed funds. Endowments are permanent funds. Anyone can contribute any amount of money to a community foundation, which invests these gifts for growth and income. A community foundation then makes grants that strengthen their community. Any individual, business or qualified charity can start an endowment fund, which is managed by their community foundation in perpetuity, meaning that gifts made to it will continue to grow and provide resources for their own community forever."
