        "text": "Healthcare IT leaders to lead innovation session at 2020 Early Stage Symposium\n\nMADISON, Wis. – Two people who are helping to shape the Epic Health Research Network will explain how it is tapping digital health records to push out data to better inform clinical experts during the 2020 Wisconsin Early Stage Symposium, to be held on a virtual platform Nov. 9-11. Registration is now open.\n\nThe EHRN is a journal designed for rapid sharing of knowledge to help solve medical problems. This anonymous information is made available with internal peer review, but without third-party peer review, to expedite sharing. Developers believe it’s important that good data be available sooner, rather than perfect data be available too late.\n\nDr. Nichole Quick of Epic Systems brings over a decade of diverse healthcare and public health experience to Epic’s work to improve population health and preventive care. She is part of the team focusing on rapid sharing of new medical knowledge by bringing observational data directly to physicians and researchers. She is trained in preventive medicine, public health and addiction medicine.\n\nMatt Doyle is a software developer working to advance observational research using health record data collected during clinical care. He has 13 years of experience working on safety-critical applications, including extensive experience exchanging clinical data to facilitate treatment, both within the United States and abroad. Past work has involved collaboration with non-profit and federal agencies to advance information standards and improve access to clinical information. Doyle and Quick will speak the morning of Nov. 10.\n\nGeneral registration is now open by clicking here!\n\n“Electronic health records have long held the promise of contributing to the study of population health,” said Tom Still, president of the Tech Council, which is producing the conference. “The creation of the Epic Health Research Network is turning that promise into reality. It is a trend that deserves attention from investors, practitioners and young companies alike.”\n\nThe Early Stage Symposium is a leading forum for young companies that want to pitch to investors. Investor Intros will feature scheduled one-on-one meetings with interested investors on Nov. 9. The Elevator Pitch Olympics will take place live on Nov. 11 with 90-second presentations by younger companies who will be scored and get immediate feedback from investors. Companies chosen for Tech Council Investor Network Presentations will utilize AirDeck to create their pitch decks and they will be available to attendees in advance.\n\nHere are investor groups so far participating in the Early Stage Symposium: 4490 Ventures, Atlene, Baird Capital, Bascom Ventures, the BioIndustrial Institute of Manufacturing Excellence, Bold Coast Capital, Brightstar WI Foundation, Capital Innovators, CMFG Ventures, Cream City Venture Capital, Dundee VC, Golden Angels Investors, Great North Labs, HealthX Ventures, Hyde Park Ventures, Idea Fund of La Crosse, Inventure Capital, Iron Forge, Lancaster Investments, Lewis & Clark Ventures, Lightbank, Lightship Capital, M25 Capital, Madison Development Corporation, MaSa Partners, Matchstick Ventures, Midwest Wealth Ventures, N29 Capital, NVNG Investment Advisors, Oshkosh Corp., Plymouth Growth Partners, Rock River Capital Partners, Sandalphon Capital, Silicon Pastures, Stateline Angels, TASC Ventures, The Ardent Group, Tundra Angels, Venture Investors, Winnebago Capital Partners, Winnow Fund, Wisconn Valley Ventures, Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., Wisconsin Investment Partners, WISC Partners and Ziegler.\n\nThe conference will also feature:\n\nA variety of insightful keynote speakers, including recently announced entrepreneur and viral influencer Jon Jacques and targeted panel discussions featuring leading entrepreneurs, investors and others tied to the tech and investor sectors\n\nA previously announced presentation on a new Wisconsin partnership involving the international Creative Destruction Lab\n\n7th annual “Triple E” award winner Lorrie Keating Heinemann to be recognized\n\nVirtual sponsor exhibit hall showcasing more than 40 innovative Wisconsin companies"
