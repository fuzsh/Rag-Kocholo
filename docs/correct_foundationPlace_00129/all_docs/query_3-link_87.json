        "text": "Opened in 1976 by Odessa Piper and sold to her Chef de Cuisine, Tory Miller, in 2005, L’Etoile’s tradition of commitment to generations of Wisconsin farmers has never wavered. We have encouraged and supported young farmers to explore heirloom varieties, heritage breed animals, and the production of new artisan products while also working to preserve Wisconsin’s fertile terroir. In 2012, Chef Tory won the James Beard Foundation's Award for Best Chef Midwest. L'Etoile continues to win high praise both locally and nationally for its excellence in food, wine, and service. Notable recognitions include Gourmet Magazine’s “America’s Top 50 Restaurants”, Saveur’s “Top 100” and the title of Madison Magazine’s “2010 Chef of the Year”.\n\nIn June of 2007, Dianne Christensen joined Chef Tory as a co-owner. They soon began to dream up a new space for L’Etoile, and the addition of a gastropub that became our sister restaurant Graze, opened in 2010. Their motivation stemmed from a desire to expand their support of local farmers by inviting a larger audience, and expanding their ability to highlight the abundance of Wisconsin's rich agricultural landscape."
