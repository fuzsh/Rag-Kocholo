        "text": "**The Veridian Homes Foundation is not currently accepting requests for funding for 2024, rather we are thrilled to be building our second “Generous Home” during MABA’s Parade of Homes this June!**\n\nFrom day one, building quality homes in this community has been our calling, and giving back to it an important piece of who we are. We provide funding to many local non-profit organizations such as American Family Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Habitat for Humanity, Clean Wisconsin, Second Harvest Foodbank and Project Baby’s Community Baby Shower. As we continue to grow, we will steadfastly keep sight of what matters most – environmental stewardship, giving back to the greater community and customer satisfaction.\n\nSince establishing the Veridian Homes Foundation in 2004, we have contributed more than $2 million to local charities and are excited to continue to help worthy causes in Southern Wisconsin and beyond. This year, all charities being considered for The Generous Home were nominated by Veridian Homes employees, and proceeds from the sale of this home will benefit these organizations, just as our 2021 home did.\n\nWe invite you to follow along on our progress as we feature The Collins home plan, located at the Golden Ponds Parade Site in Waunakee, homesite 28.\n\nThe Veridian Homes Foundation will resume quarterly meetings in 2025, and we look forward to your request for funding at that time."
