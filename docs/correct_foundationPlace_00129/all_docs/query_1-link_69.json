        "text": "Although there are a variety of robust EHR systems, few enjoy the staying power and accolades of Epic. As an industry leader, Epic recently secured the top spot for the sixth straight year for Overall Software Suite in the Best In KLAS: Software & Services report. The company was also named best Overall Physician Practice Vendor; received Best In KLAS awards in seven segments; and regularly tops the list of EHR systems in similar surveys.\n\nAlthough there are numerous reasons why healthcare organizations choose Epic over other EHR systems, we’ve highlighted 5 of the most common ones below:\n\n1. Reliability and Sustainability\n\nFounded in 1979, Epic is a well established and respected company. Healthcare facilities utilizing the Epic system gain a competitive advantage, which helps them to attract and retain top-level practitioners. The company employs physicians and nurses, who participate in customer site visits and help guide best practices. Organizations striving to achieve and maintain Meaningful Use attestation can have confidence in Epic’s sustainability and staying power.\n\n2. Integration\n\nEpic is able to deliver results across the healthcare continuum. As a fully-integrated solution, its suite of products were developed in-house and designed to work together synergistically. This creates economies of scale in developing reporting and analytic solutions using common tools.\n\n3. Certified Consultants\n\nEpic maintains strict guidelines for its consultants, only those holding Epic certifications can guide an implementation. The company offers product or module specific training, and requires consultants to demonstrate mastery of the subject matter by passing an exam to obtain Epic certification.\n\n4. Proven Performance\n\nThe enterprise-wide Epic solution has proven its worth at hospitals, health systems, and other healthcare organizations across the United States. Current notable clients include Baptist Health, Cedars-Sinai Health, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins Medicine, and Mount Sinai Health.\n\n5. Scalability\n\nEpic’s inherent scalability allows healthcare organizations of all sizes to utilize their software. The company offers a flexible, scalable foundation that fits varying budgets and workflows, and supports growth within a healthcare facility.
