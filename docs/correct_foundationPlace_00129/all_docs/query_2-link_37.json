        "text": "Epic Systems Corporation provides a range of software solutions designed to help hospitals and health systems provide better patient care, improve communication, streamline workflows, and more.\n\nFounded in 1979, Epic is one of the top vendors for inpatient and ambulatory electronic health record systems in the country. The company offers a suite of in-house developed healthcare software for a variety of tasks ranging from clinical record-keeping to registration, scheduling, billing, and more.\n\nAlthough there are many proven electronic health record (EHR) systems available, Epic is the leading choice among providers. The ease with which Epic’s software integrates within a health system’s existing infrastructure and communicates with other programs—a factor known as interoperability—likely drives some of its appeal.\n\nUsing data from Definitive Healthcare’s HospitalView product, we take a look at the hospitals and health systems integrating Epic into their systems for 2022 and 2023.\n\nWhat percentage of health systems use Epic?\n\nAround 70% of all health network EHR implementations in 2022 and 2023 involved Epic Systems Corporation EHRs, making it the top EHR vendor by market share. Those IDNs include 1,079 out of 1,395 U.S. hospitals that implemented EHR systems during that period.\n\nThe vendor with the next largest share of EHR usage in 2022 and 2023 is Oracle Cerner, with just over 6% of implementations. Sixty-four hospitals within six IDNs installed Oracle Cerner EHR products during that period. Check out our list of top hospitals using Oracle Cerner for more details.\n\nLearn more\n\nHealthcare Insights are developed with healthcare commercial intelligence from the Definitive Healthcare platform.
