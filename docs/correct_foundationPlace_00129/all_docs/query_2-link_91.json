        "text": "Hamilton Health Sciences has been an Epic hospital since June 2022. Epic is a fully digital, state-of-the-art hospital information system to store patient health records.\n\nA new system for you.\n\nOn June 4, 2022, Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS) launched Epic – a modern system that provides a single personal health record for each patient. Putting all of your health information in one easy-to-access place will improve patient safety and quality of care. It is the largest clinical transformation in the history of HHS.\n\nEpic is used at all HHS sites. It will vastly improve how we deliver care across all our programs and services for the community of 2.3 million people we serve in South-west Ontario.\n\nMoving to a new electronic platform to manage all of our patients’ health-care data will:\n\nIncrease patient safety and quality of care by having everything in one place\n\nMake patients more active partners in their care with tools like MyChart\n\nImprove health across the continuum of care by allowing providers to communicate better with clinicians across our sites and beyond the hospital\n\nGive our staff and physicians a better way to manage patient data and make smarter decisions in real time\n\nKeep our organization among leading hospitals in Canada as a centre of excellence in care, research and learning\n\n7 things you need to know about Epic\n\nWhile you’re here\n\n1. Tell your story once: When you arrive, we’ll work with you to compile a complete list of your medications, allergies, vaccinations and more. Before you leave, we’ll provide you with an updated list based on your doctor’s orders. This helps prevent medication mix-ups, and makes it easier for you to manage your prescriptions.\n\n2. You may receive an armband that allows us to verify your identity, medications, allergies and other important information that helps us keep you safe.\n\n3. Your healthcare provider may use mobile devices such as a smartphone or tablet to document details about your care. These devices are secure and help us capture your information accurately and quickly, directly into your medical record.\n\n4. You will receive a summary of your visit and steps to take when you get home, including new prescriptions, dietary information and exercise instructions.\n\nWhen you go home\n\n5. You may have the option to follow up with your health-care provider from the comfort of your home, through a secure virtual platform.\n\n6. The launch of Epic also includes a new MyChart patient portal integrated with the Epic system. This secure, online portal allows patients to access their medical records and personal health information in one secure place from your phone or computer. You can designate a loved one to have access, too. Read more about MyChart.\n\n7. You now have educational materials at your fingertips to support your health journey beyond the hospital. Your health-care team can send articles to you by email, or you can read these materials right in your MyChart account.\n\nAs our team transitions to our new system, Epic, your visit may take a little longer. We appreciate your patience and understanding as our teams make this important change to serve you better.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns, talk to your care team or contact Patient Experience at patientexperience@hhsc.ca or call 905-521-2100 ext. 75240.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"
