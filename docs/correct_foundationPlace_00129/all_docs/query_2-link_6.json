        "text": "American businesswoman\n\nJudith R. Faulkner (born August 11, 1943) is an American billionaire businesswoman who is the CEO and founder of Epic Systems, a healthcare software company located in Verona, Wisconsin.[2] Faulkner founded Epic Systems in 1979, with the original name of Human Services Computing.[3] In 2013, Forbes called her \"the most powerful woman in healthcare\",[4] and as of July 2024, estimated her net worth at US$7.8 billion.[5]\n\nFaulkner was born in August 1943[6][7] to Louis and Del Greenfield.[8] Faulkner's parents inspired her early interest in healthcare; her father, Louis, was a pharmacist, and her mother, Del, was the director of Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility.[8] She was raised in the Erlton neighborhood of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and graduated from Moorestown Friends School in 1961.[9][10] She received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Dickinson College and a master's degree in computer science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.[8]\n\nIn 1979, shortly after receiving her master's degree, Faulkner co-founded Human Services Computing, with Dr. John Greist.[8] Human Services Computing, which later became Epic Systems, began in a basement at 2020 University Avenue in Madison, Wisconsin.[8] The company was started with a $70,000 investment from friends and family but has never taken investment from venture capital or private equity and remains a privately held company.[11] In fact, Faulkner prides herself in the fact that Epic is homegrown; they have never acquired another company,[8][12] and Faulkner has stated they will never go public.[13] Epic Systems now holds the medical records of over 300 million people.[14] Faulkner and her family currently own 43 percent of Epic Systems.[15]\n\nForbes' America's Top 50 Women In Tech 2018[5]\n\nForbes ranked her as the 55th most powerful woman in the world in 2023.[16]\n\nFaulkner lives in Madison, Wisconsin.[5][3] She is married to Dr. Gordon Faulkner, a pediatrician.[17] They have three children.[5][17]"
