Sinking concrete can be an eyesore, lowering your home's curb appeal and value. That is why Badger Basement Systems provides a fast-acting, long-lasting concrete lifting and leveling solution with PolyLevelÂ®. Other companies offer outdated and disruptive concrete repair methods, such as mudjacking. These services fail to address the underlying cause of sinking slabs, so you'll have to pay more to have the work done again. But with PolyLevel, you won't have to worry. This lightweight, incredibly durable concrete leveling solution provides accurate, water-resistant results you can rely on for years to come.\n\nHow PolyLevel concrete leveling works:\n\nFirst, we inject a two-part polyurethane foam beneath the sinking slab through Small 5/8 inch holes and ports.\n\nAfter, it quickly expands to fill every gap, providing an incredibly durable and accurate lift.\n\nFinally, the concrete cures in 15 minutes and creates lasting, waterproof results! Mudjacking or slabjacking can take up to 24 hours and is not resistant to moisture.\n\nSchedule a free concrete leveling estimate to learn more. We offer concrete lifting services throughout Wisconsin & Illinois in Kenosha, Madison, Rockford, IL, and nearby."
