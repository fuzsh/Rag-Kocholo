        "text": "A HUGE Madison River Foundation THANK YOU to all of you for making this event such a success! The gala was SOLD OUT this year…Yeehaw!\n\nWe cannot express enough gratitude to our 256 guests, our gracious hosts (Dave and Kathy Cope), our generous auction item donors (look for your name listed in one of our Gratitude Posts on FB), our talented vendors, and our hardworking volunteers!\n\nMRF announces new Executive Director\n\nKeith Brauneis has dedicated the better part of his career to helping conserve wild places and wild things. He has been standing in rivers, streams and creeks since childhood and his passion for trout, aquatic life and the outdoors at large permeates everything he does.\n\nHis career has been diverse. Over the years he has owned and operated three businesses and held job titles ranging from Marketing Director to Producer to Creative Director. This path helped him refine a strong level of business acumen.\n\nHe has also worked with a long list of conservation organizations - relationships that most recently led him to the MRF. He is a loyal advocate for the Madison River watershed as well as a former board member of the Madison River Foundation.\n\nHe currently resides in Ennis, Montana with his wife Wendy. The two of them take great pride in their community. When they’re not on a river or mountain, they enjoy spending their free time volunteering for local organizations such as Jack Creek Preserve Foundation, Madison Valley Woman’s Club, Ennis Chamber Of Commerce and Madison Valley Search And Rescue.\n\n“I can’t think of a better match. An individual who is professionally involved and dedicated to this community is now overseeing the Madison River Foundation. Keith understands on a deeply personal level, the relationship between a healthy river and the health of the Madison Valley. We are thrilled to have him on board.” - Anne Morgan, Board President\n\nIrrigation Ditch Fish Rescue\n\nBetween October 16th-20th, volunteers working with the MRF and FWP relocated more than 3,000 fish from the West Madison/Valley Garden irrigation canal back to the Madison River. Mature native brown, rainbow, and cutthroat trout were returned to the mainstem of the Madison to continue their reproductive cycles. It's estimated that the volunteers spent a combined total of 1,800 hours walking the canals, catching fish, and transferring them via buckets to the river. Many members of the community rallied around the process, including students at the Madison Valley Adventure Academy and members of the Ennis High School Lady Mustangs Volleyball Team. Due to this hard work and commitment, thousands of fish were given a second chance at life and are continuing to thrive in their natural habitat.\n\nJack Creek Beaver Dam Analog Installation\n\nIn August, the MRF partnered with Jack Creek Preserve to install 3 beaver dam analog structures and 12 scour pools along sections of Upper Jack Creek. These structures will help reactivate historic floodplains in the area, revitalize surrounding riparian vegetation, restore eroded riverbanks, and supply water to nearby aquifers. We also hope to see more trout utilizing the slow, shallow pools, providing a place for Jack Creek campers to learn to fish!\n\nIn October, foundation staff members accompanied Ennis Middle School students on a field trip to report on the progress of the analog structures and measure flow rate, water depth and temperature, and the riverbank profile. Students learned about the impact of beavers on riparian habitats and practiced conducting scientific measurements in the field. Jack Creek staff members Abi and Addison gave engaging presentations and the students spent a memorable afternoon hiking around the preserve!\n\nMany local community members worked with the Madison Conservation District on the Stream Team water monitoring project, visiting 4 creek sites weekly to monitor flow rate, temperature, and other river conditions and compile a log of citizen science data for MSU research projects. In August, the MCD conducted a Tributary Blitz, a one-day water quality sampling event of 16 tributaries of the Madison River. The information collected will be used to monitor the health of the tributaries and identify possible restoration opportunities.\n\nMadison Valley locals also donated their time to assist the Madison Valley Ranchlands Group in monitoring the growth of noxious weeds along the riverbank. Volunteers rowed drift boats, logged weed species on a web application, and marked areas for future weed pulls.\n\nFinally, members of the MRF taught skills such as fly tying, trail etiquette, and astronomy at the Jack Creek Preserve Outdoor Skills Camps in July and August. The MRF would like to thank everyone who volunteered their time and effort on projects this year!\n\nIf you would like to be added to our volunteer list for 2024, send us an email at info@madisonriverfoundation.org.\n\nThanks for another great year! Here’s to the next!\n\n-The MRF Team"
