        "text": "Epic is the name of our new electronic health record system for patients. Epic has replaced multiple different systems, allowing us to securely store and access all the information about your care in one place.\n\nEpic will make your experience as a patient with us smoother, safer and more convenient. Staff will be able to access your information quickly and more easily, and patients will also be able to see information about their own health record using MyChart, our new app and website for patients and carers.\n\nWhile Epic is a company based in the United States, the systems and applications Epic owns and operates are fully compliant with UK laws relating to privacy.\n\nProtecting your data\n\nWe take great care to ensure that health information is kept private and secure.\n\nEpic does not store patient data or Protected Health Information (PHI).\n\nEpic does not sell or provide patient data to third parties.\n\nEpic collects non-identifying data such as the mobile device ID, carrier, OS version, connection type (wi-fi vs mobile) for the purposes of troubleshooting errors and for development of improvements to the MyChart app.\n\nCompliance with UK regulations\n\nUnder the UK General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) 2021 and Data Protection Act 2018 we are required to keep your health records secure and confidential. We require all our partner organisations to apply the same strict security to your records as we do, and we make sure that those restrictions are in place before sharing any information. We only share your information in strict accordance with the law.\n\nMyChart is owned and operated by Epic and is fully compliant with UK laws relating to privacy. Names and email addresses will be treated with the same care and privacy given to health records and will never be sold or leased by MyChart, Epic, Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, or King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nSecurity on MyChart, our patient app\n\nMyChart uses the latest encryption technology and passwords and two-step authentication to keep your information safe. We always recommend using a personal email address to sign up to MyChart and avoid shared email addresses. Keep your log in details safe and do not share them.\n\nIf you do not agree to the mobile app agreement, you can choose to use the web version of MyChart which is hosted by Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, and not Epic.\n\nOur commitment to cyber security\n\nBoth Guy’s and St Thomas’ and Epic take cyber security very seriously and guard against attacks and threats in a number of ways. Most breaches can be prevented by simple steps, like making sure all users use strong passwords and deploying software updates automatically.\n\nWe also employ robust IT processes, such as using the Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT) as a self-assessment against National Standards, and have strong procedures in place to detect and eliminate malware within our systems.\n\nData sharing and confidentiality\n\nThe launch of Epic means that your health record will be accessible by health and care staff at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nYour health record will be stored securely and will only be accessed when needed, and to support your care. Your personal information will remain secure and will not be used inappropriately.\n\nIf you do not want your health record to be accessible to both trusts, you can contact the Data Protection Officer. Write to:\n\nInformation governance, St Thomas' Hospital, Westminster Bridge Road, London SE1 7EH\n\nOr email: [email protected]\n\nPlease include:\n\nwhich hospital you receive care at (e.g. King’s College Hospital)\n\nyour hospital number, also known as your NHS number\n\nconfirmation that you understand the implications of your request to limit access to your health record\n\nIf you decide to limit access, this will prevent staff from seeing clinical activity displayed on your record. Demographic information (names, address, and date of birth) will still be available to view. The only exception to limiting access to your record is if there is a clinical need to view your health record, for instance if you require emergency care at one of our hospitals.\n\nPlease note that limiting access across our two organisations will not prevent sharing of your health record to the London Care Record which already shares patient data with other health and care organisations across London."
