        "text": "By of the\n\nMore than a dozen years ago, George Halvorson, the chief executive of Kaiser Permanente, pressed Judy Faulkner on her \"number\" — the sum that would entice her to either sell Epic Systems Corp. or take the company public.\n\nEpic was a finalist for a huge contract with the private health system, a contract big enough to turn the Madison-area software maker into a major player in the fast-growing industry of electronic health records.\n\n\"We're from the Bay Area. Technology companies build themselves up and then go public and then go 'poof.' Right?\" Andrew Wiesenthal, who was Kaiser Permanente's lead physician for the project, recalled years later. \"That's everybody's get-rich strategy.\n\n\"She did not blink,\" Wiesenthal said. \"She said, 'There is no number. We are not going to have an IPO.'\"\n\nIt was one of the early signs that money is not what drives Faulkner, Epic's founder and chief executive.\n\nAnother came last May when Faulkner — now a multibillionaire — pledged to give 99% of her family's wealth to a nonprofit foundation.\n\nShe made her plans public in a letter to the Giving Pledge, an initiative led by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett that encourages the world's richest people to commit to giving more than half of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nFaulkner's foundation, funded with her Epic shares, will give money to health care, education, especially for those who have the least opportunities, and \"if possible, help create a more peaceful world,\" Faulkner wrote.\n\nForbes has estimated Faulkner's wealth at $2.6 billion. Based on the stock market value of Epic's top competitors and estimates of the company's profit margins, more than $4 billion is closer to a reasonable estimate.\n\nFaulkner and her family control about 43% of Epic, a company with more than $1.8 billion in annual revenue and 9,500 employees. In all, about 75% of the company is owned by about 200 employees and their families. All other employees are eligible for stock appreciation rights.\n\nThe only outside stockholders are the initial investors and their families, a few people who bought stock from those investors and some outside directors given stock in 1990s.\n\nFaulkner declined a request to talk about her pledge. But in her letter, she said she never had any personal desire to live lavishly. She is among the billionaires who are indifferent to the lifestyle that great wealth can buy. There is no apartment in New York or Paris. There is no ranch in Aspen. There are no private or even corporate jets.\n\nShe drives a 5-year old Audi wagon and has had two cars in the past 15 years. And she and her husband, Gordon, a pediatrician, have lived in the same house in a Madison subdivision for almost three decades.\n\nFaulkner avoids publicity and began granting occasional interviews only when Epic became too big to escape attention. She asks that her picture not be taken because she likes to be able to go out without being noticed.\n\nFaulkner grew up in New Jersey and earned an undergraduate degree in math at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa. In the 1960s, she came to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for graduate school in computer science — and now is one of the best examples of the economic benefits of a state's having a respected university.\n\n\"I took a class in computers and medicine, and one of my professors asked me to work with them,\" she said in an email. \"That got me started working with health care.\"\n\nAfter graduate school, while working for UW Hospital and Clinics, she was asked to create a database to collect and track patient information. Other physicians began asking her to customize the database for their specialties. They eventually encouraged her to start a company.\n\nHaving no idea how to start a company, she was told to get permission from UW, get a good lawyer and get a good accountant.\n\nIn 1979, Faulkner and about a dozen other people, most of them co-workers, founded Human Services Computer Inc. to sell and customize a database management system for various tasks in health care. Most kept their day jobs and pitched in after hours; technically, the company started with the equivalent of 11/2 employees.\n\n\"I was the CEO and I was half-time (although I worked a lot more than that),\" Faulkner said, \"and I had a morning assistant and an afternoon assistant.\"\n\nThe initial investors put up $70,000 and included her parents, who invested despite Faulkner's efforts to dissuade them. The investment, she acknowledged, worked out.\n\nFor more than a decade, the company was a successful but small software shop. By 1990, it had sales of $1.7 million and 29 employees.\n\nCompany folklore has it that in the early days, workers would go home and return the next day only to find Faulkner still at her computer, according to Sean Bina, an Epic vice president.\n\nWith the power of computers improving at a stunning rate, the company sensed an opportunity. Around 1992, the renamed company introduced EpicCare, its first electronic medical record. Epic focused on large physician practices, and sales began to take off, reaching $18 million in 1995.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Epic turned its attention to hospitals, a market dominated by much larger companies. Sales soon exploded, jumping to $162 million in 2003.\n\nThat same year, Epic stunned the industry by winning the contract with Kaiser Permanente.\n\nAlong the way, Faulkner learned what she needed to know about running a fast-growing company. She took her own path, though, vowing that it will never go public, in part because she has never wanted to be beholden to Wall Street.\n\nThe company is known for hiring academic superstars almost exclusively, people who majored in math, physics, computer science, engineering and philosophy. Applicants take intelligence and personality tests as well as tests for specific jobs, such as programming. The typical Epic employee is exceedingly bright, accomplished and disciplined.\n\nThe company is not for everyone. Voluntary turnover is about 10% a year. And the company has a reputation for being a demanding employer. Bina contends that the hours that Epic employees work are overstated, estimating that the typical Epic employee works about 45 hours a week, though he acknowledges some work much more.\n\nThe atmosphere is neither uptight nor laid back. Much is made of Epic's somewhat zany campus, with each cluster of buildings having a theme, such as New York, a jungle or a farm, and its tree house. But you also get the sense that this is a company that has to work at being zany.\n\nFor one expansion, the architect suggested putting motion detectors in the offices to turn off the lights when empty. Faulkner told him that it would never work, because the lights would constantly go off when programmers were motionlessly staring at their computers thinking about a problem. The architect later acknowledged that she was right.\n\nThe goal is for each employee to have his or her own office, because Faulkner says that is how she likes to work.\n\nFaulkner's priorities and values also are manifested in other ways. Epic supports local businesses, from buying local produce for its three cafeterias to local bookstores, whenever possible. Its campus doesn't have a fitness center or day care center partly so that it doesn't take business away from other businesses. The company is the state's largest generator of solar power. It also owns six wind turbines off campus.\n\nAnd after Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state's largest business lobby, ran a large advertising campaign to support a candidate for the state Supreme Court, Epic announced that it would no longer do business with companies that belonged to the group.\n\nEpic instead has focused on building its system for electronic health records, steadily adding features and improving existing ones.\n\n\"Epic is a software factory,\" she said.\n\nPeople say Faulkner, who describes programming as \"a mix of language, math and art,\" remains a software developer at heart. And at 72, she has no plans to retire or even slow down.\n\nWealth was a byproduct, and maybe an unexpected one. Now, she has taken steps to ensure it will be put to good use for decades to come.\n\nIn her letter to the Giving Pledge, she wrote:\n\n\"Many years ago I asked my young children what two things they needed from their parents. They said 'food and money.' I told them 'roots and wings.' My goal in pledging 99% of my assets to philanthropy is to help others with roots — food, warmth, shelter, health care, education — so they too can have wings.\""
