        "text": "Epic EHR\n\nHello - I am an Epic instructional designer/trainer for professional and hospital coding at the Hospital for Special Surgery in NY. I've been an Epic trainer for over 12 years. I just wanted to give my thoughts.\n\nClinical - providers will document in Epiccare and select appropriate E/M and procedures from a populated charge list that is created for them prior to go live. They also have the ability to add other charges not listed on their list. They will also select and link the Dx codes. When the provider signs the encounter, charges are released and are reviewed by charge edits in the charge router (high level checks - think charges with fatal errors such as charges not in system, no guarantor account, etc). Those errors are typically worked by your analysts. If no charge router edits charges are then checked against charge review workqueue edits (CCI/LCD and whatever edits your organization creates - you can create your own rules). Depending on your organization set up, coders will work these charge review workqueues for coding. In smaller organizations, the office manager will work the coding charge edits.\n\nIf the charges have no errors, they just keep swimming down the revenue cycle stream. When you first go live on Epic, your org may have set up a 100% charge review, where you will check documentation and charges for ALL encounters to ensure it accuracy. This allows you to educate providers initially, but also get you tooling around in the chart to get more familiar with it. After about 90 days, the 100% review is reduced to about 2% or your compliance department may set up a workflow where they push certain accounts to your charge review workqueues for review.\n\nThe charges are then checked for claim errors defined by your organization. Claim edits route to claim edit workqueues that are worked by billing staff, registration staff and coders, depending on the edit. Edits here can be coverage related (which will be a LOT at go live), billing related and coding (I find these coding claim edits to be repeats of charge edits because end users can bypass charge edits if they have security to do so).\n\nOnce the claims are clean, they are released to a third party clearinghouse that checks for additional edits. If the clearinghouse finds errors, they will send the claim back to Epic for someone to fix (not necessarily coding errors). If there are no errors, the claims go to the payors.\n\nWhen a denial is received, the biller will note the account and set a flag that coding needs to be reviewed (if it's a coding denial, that is, they also do this for registration and billing denials) and the account routes to an account workqueue for coders to work. The coder will review the error, update any Px, Dx, etc, note the account and then remove the coding review flag so the account routes back to the biller. The biller will then rebill or perform other actions based on your findings.\n\nThat's about it in a nutshell. It's the same workflow for IP and OP Hospital coding as well, except there is a button that launches the encoder. In 12 years, the encoder has always been 3M. You enter info into 3M and then that info is pulled into Epic. Some organizations may have you launch 3M outside of Epic (the Encoder button won't open 3M). The coder would have manually enter info into 3M and then manually enter 3M findings into Epic because the link isn't there. That's currently how it is at HSS, which is being changed to the launching 3M via the Encoder button.\n\nIt's a pretty slick system. The one complaint I get from coders is that information in the chart isn't as robust as it needs to be - it is, but it wasn't accounted for to be included on coding reports. But this is quickly fixed!! You would just tell your analyst what chart information you want to see and they add it to your coding report. It's just frustrating at first having to dig and dig to find stuff at go live.\n\nHope that helps a little bit. Again, this is just my experience with coding/charging in Epic. The above are typical foundation Epic workflows for coding. One thing I would recommend is that you ask for what you want.\n\nGood luck!!\n\nKelley O\n\nEpic EHR\n\nHello - I am an Epic instructional designer/trainer for professional and hospital coding at the Hospital for Special Surgery in NY.

I code outpatient encounters and while in a quick tutorial ( we haven't had our official training yet), they mention simple coding. Can you explain what that is exactly. I'm pretty nervous and excited at same time and wondering if indeed this will eliminate some coding jobs"
