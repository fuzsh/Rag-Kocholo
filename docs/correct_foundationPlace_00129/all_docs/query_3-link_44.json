        "text": "Finding and applying for scholarships\n\nScholarships are available through the Madison College Foundation and external sources. They help with tuition costs and—unlike a student loan—don’t need to be repaid.\n\nMadison College Foundation Scholarships\n\nThe Madison College Foundation is the home for scholarships specifically for Madison College students. They make it easy to apply for a pool of scholarships with one application.\n\nA few things to keep in mind before you start the application process:\n\nApplications are open twice a year. Visit the Madison College Foundation website for current deadlines.\n\nYou must be taking at least 6 credits.\n\nYou must be accepted into a program at Madison College.\n\nYou must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher.\n\nYou must upload a letter of recommendation.\n\nYou must upload your college or high school transcript.\n\nCheck out a list of 50 scholarships offered through the Madison College Foundation at madisoncollege.academicworks.com.\n\nExternal Scholarships\n\nExternal scholarships are not specific to Madison College and can be a great way to help offset your cost of attending school.\n\nApplication Process\n\nYou must apply directly to the source of external scholarships.\n\nIf you receive a scholarship and a FAFSA has been completed, you must notify the Financial Aid Office at financialaid@madisoncollege.edu.\n\nThe scholarship provider must mail the check to the Madison College, PO Box 7906, Madison, WI 53707 along with your information to put it in the correct account.\n\nIf the check is made out to you and Madison College, you must endorse it in the Truax Payment Center.\n\nThe scholarship is disbursed after the Pell recalculation date and will go to your student account to pay towards any remaining balances.\n\nIf the scholarship is more than the amount you owe to the college, you will receive a refund.\n\nView External Scholarships\n\nWe're Here to Help\n\nYou’re never alone in trying to figure this all out. Our financial aid counselors are experts in helping students tap into the aid they need.\n\nIf you have a question about a scholarship from the Madison College Foundation, contact Ruth Hankes at rhankes@madisoncollege.edu or 608.246.6719.\n\nCheck out our Guide to Financial Aid at Madison College (PDF)\n\nBook a virtual appointment with one of our financial aid counselors.\n\nChat now with one of our financial aid counselors."
