        "text": "2.0\n\nA zippia user wrote a review on Jan 2024\n\nPros of working at Epic Systems\n\nBenefits (PCP and BH free, Rx under $20) and high salary. Learned a lot about myself and how I function in an office-setting. lots of skills developed, learned about Epic and the software world, connected with coworkers and customers. The software is good and truly helps users in the medical field.\n\nCons of working at Epic Systems\n\nOverworked, under-trained. Expectations are way too high way too quickly. They claim to care about work/life balance but then have lots of things that encourage long hours and high stress. They are very resistant to providing accomodations or considering their employees' perspectives. Require in-person even for devs who never leave their offices. There is a lot of corporate culture and competitiveness, and though they say they value feedback and have various feedback tools, all the feedback I ever got was my team lead telling me \"I've gotten feedback that you...\" rather than the person telling me directly. There's a lot more training on culture and broad concepts, but all the day to day stuff is basically learn-as-you-go and you have to sink or swim on your own. There's also a ton of systemic issues (classism is the biggest, but racism/sexism/etc are also apparent in various ways) that are not being heard or addressed.\n\nEpic Systems Benefits\n\nThe cow bikes they have on campus in the summer were honestly one of those \"little joys\" for me, they are cute and fun and give me a mental break with some physical movement. Also free therapy and GP visits is huge for me.\n\nWhat do you like best about Epic Systems's CEO and the leadership team?\n\nShe has good ideas for the software, and is a female CEO, which helps counter gender norms (though she doesn't do much to fix the sexism in her company).\n\nHow would you improve Epic Systems's culture?\n\nWay more focus on mental and physical health, more sick and vacation time. Allowing 100% remote work as an accommodation and offering more work from home days in general. Unionize.\n\nHow did you prepare for the Epic Systems interview?\n\nLearning about the company, reading reviews on sites like this, writing down answers to common interview questions\n\nHow does your compensation at Epic Systems compare to the industry average?\n\nHigher than average (I think). Epic pays employees a lot, presumably to try to get them to stay since they have so much turnover\n\nWhat's the diversity at Epic Systems like?\n\nLacking. There does not seem to be much effort put towards hiring diverse candidates, and the demographics of the various roles align with typical stereotypes (construction/facilities are overwhelmingly male). There are ERGs for various groups, but not much else. Our DEI team doesn't seem to be able to push much up the chain, I dont think leadership wants to change\n\nWhat brings you the most joy at Epic Systems?\n\nHelping my analysts figure things out and understand things"
