        "text": "UnityPoint Health – Meriter Foundation partners with donors like you to ensure access to high-quality health care for patients and families who rely on the compassion and expertise of UnityPoint Health – Meriter, a not-for-profit health care organization. Your generosity supports a standard of excellence in care, innovation and comfort that would not be possible without you.\n\nOur rich history dates back more than a century when Meriter’s predecessor hospitals (Methodist Hospital and Madison General Hospital) were founded by a group of caring, committed philanthropists dedicated to providing comprehensive and affordable health care to a growing community. Today, the dedicated team at Meriter Foundation continues this legacy of impactful philanthropy, ensuring that every gift creates a lasting impact where it's needed most.\n\nAll funds raised through Meriter Foundation support various programs at Meriter. We do not provide direct grants to external organizations. Meriter Foundation operates as a not-for-profit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization and serves as the charitable arm of UnityPoint Health – Meriter.\n\nI joined UnityPoint Health – Meriter in December 2019 and I love working here! As a career fundraising leader, the role itself was familiar, but it was my first time working in the healthcare field. Just weeks into my new job, the Covid-19 pandemic hit, and the all-hands-on-deck environment required the Meriter Foundation team to pivot overnight to launch a supplemental supply chain operation, managing the 24/7 acquisition of supplies through volunteer and donated sources. I will forever remember this as one of the most impactful, humbling and rewarding career seasons of my life. I was so proud of our team and our hospital for coming together with such grit and grace.\n\nEvery day, I am extremely proud of the donor-centered work that I am fortunate to do alongside my team and board members for patients, healthcare teams and the community. We create meaningful philanthropy-powered impact every day, and I love seeing the look on donors’ faces when they see what they’ve made possible.\n\nOn the personal side, I live in a small rural town south of Madison with my husband, John, and our three sweet dogs: a Labrador, a Golden Retriever and a Beagle. We have four grown children who live close by. In my free time, I love to write and perform folk music locally under my stage name, Becky Wiles.\n\nCommunications, Stewardship, Storytelling\n\nI'm deeply passionate about the transformative power of philanthropy and feel fortunate to have transitioned from a decade-long career in Marketing to the fulfilling world of fundraising. Each day, I have the privilege of hearing about the profound impact your generosity has on patients and families—often during their most critical moments. My role is to amplify their stories alongside yours, showcasing how your compassion is shaping our community into a more caring and compassionate place.\n\nI'm regularly moved by the gratitude expressed by caregivers and families at Meriter, thanking YOU for the difference your support through Meriter Foundation has made in their lives. Being able to contribute, even in a small way, to this positive impact is incredibly meaningful.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy spending time with my husband and our sweet elderly dog, exploring parks and trails around Madison. I love travel and scuba diving, but on an average day, you’ll find me experimenting with new recipes, working on the Board of Directors for my historic Madison neighborhood, or determinedly solving the New York Times Crossword!\n\nLeadership Annual Giving, Corporate Giving, Grateful Patients\n\nPhilanthropy is at the heart of my core values. I’ve always had a passion for volunteering and fundraising for local nonprofits. As an undergraduate at Drake University, I volunteered at UnityPoint Health – Des Moines Foundation where my experience was influential in solidifying my plans to pursue a career in philanthropy.\n\nI joined Meriter Foundation in 2022 and am incredibly grateful to have found the perfect intersection of my passions. Getting to work in a field that brings me joy, while helping others create a meaningful impact on our community is a great honor. I love meeting our donors, learning what they’re passionate about and connecting them with the causes and programs closest to their heart. It means the world that I get to play even a small role in the inspiring work happening here at Meriter.\n\nI enjoy spending my free time with my amazing family exploring all that Madison has to offer. Whether it’s going to the Farmer’s Market, attending a concert or trying a new restaurant, I’m so thankful to call this community home!\n\nI’d be delighted to treat you to coffee to share my heartfelt thanks for the impact you’ve made, hear your story and talk about how you’d like to stay connected to your gift through Meriter Foundation.\n\nMajor Gifts, Planned Giving\n\nI’m driven by a profound desire to enact positive change in our world. I believe the best way to do that is through connection and fostering unity, which is one of UnityPoint Health – Meriter’s core values.\n\nAs you can imagine, I was grateful for the opportunity to join Meriter Foundation team in 2023. While it has been a powerful and humbling experience to learn more about the struggles our community is facing, I am deeply moved by the generosity, love and support I see every day through inspired giving.\n\nI’d love to learn more about you. What are you most proud of? What worries you? What brings you joy? I’m here to help connect you to the causes closest to your heart in a meaningful way so that your impact is felt today and for generations to come.\n\nLet’s grab coffee or lunch and dream about the ways we can make the world a better place together.\n\nI started my time with Meriter Foundation in 2021, and I have discovered this is the work I was meant to do. I specialize in database optimization and keeping all information up to date within the system. I am a support person to all foundation staff and assist with events, prospect research, list pulls and more to make sure all donors can have the best experience possible.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy running, camping, and spending time with my family by the lake. My husband and I have three boys, three dogs, and a cat that keep us very busy outside of business hours.\n\nThis has been wonderful journey learning all I can about the power of philanthropy, and I am very excited to continue to learn and make a difference in our community.\n\nGrant Writing\n\nI joined Meriter Foundation in 2003 and, since that time, I’ve been involved in the development of many innovative projects that have changed the way UnityPoint Health – Meriter delivers care. I’ve enjoy working with hospital leadership to take a project from concept to implementation with the generous support of caring donors who shared in our vision.\n\nMy specialization lies in working with foundations, and state and federal agencies to identify projects that meet the interests of external grantors. I’m especially inspired by the legacy work of family foundations that involve multiple generations in philanthropic efforts to address the most pressing needs in our communities. Guided by a commitment to service and a passion for addressing the needs of the underserved, family foundations take a long-term approach to transforming lives. I celebrate your philanthropic spirit!\n\nAway from work, I’m an avid gardener—an interest developed in my childhood when my parents operated a greenhouse. I always enjoy hearing about what’s coming up in your garden.\n\nI’ve witnessed amazing transformation at Meriter over the past 20 years. I look forward to working with you—innovators, leaders and visionaries—who share our bold approach to making lasting change.\n\nTransformational Gifts, Major Gifts, Grateful Patients\n\nMy lifelong love of philanthropy began at the age of seven, when I watched my mother plan a grassroots community run to raise money in honor of her best friend’s son, who was born with cerebral palsy. I understood the impact of philanthropy early on seeing her organize these fundraising events with grit, compassion, and dedication. It is what inspired me to pursue a career in philanthropy focused on keeping kids healthy.\n\nEach day, I learn about the profound and unexpected ways healthcare touches your life. It brings me joy to listen and understand why you are passionate about creating a healthy community. It is fulfilling to build a lasting connection with you: moments made up of talking together, showing a genuine interest in your life, opinions and experiences and remembering those intricate details in thoughtful ways. Let’s work together to make your philanthropic giving a meaningful, memorable and joyful experience.\n\nI am a small-town Wisconsin girl married to the love of my life of over 20 years, Andy, and blessed with our sweet little girl. My happiest days are spent with them exploring the Midwest’s parks, hiking trails, and mini-golf courses. My idea of heaven is a leisurely afternoon people watching at a café or in the library reading a latest best-seller."
