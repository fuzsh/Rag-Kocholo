They are a great value for the compressive strength they offer, supporting your foundation and home for years to come.\n\nWith concrete piers, we provide a standard, lifetime warranty for all of our work. A highlight of our workmanship warranty is for the address – not just the customer – so if a homeowner sells their house, the workmanship warranty will transfer to the new owner.\n\nConventional Foundation Repair\n\nOther foundation companies in Madison, MS can’t repair your conventional foundation like Superior Foundations can!\n\nWhen doing a conventional foundation repair, two major issues must be addressed to get the job done correctly:\n\nFoundation Repairs\n\nFramework/Masonry Repairs\n\nDue to the complexities of addressing both foundation and framework/masonry issues, most contractors in the Madison area will not work on conventional foundations. Too many things can go wrong, which is why you need someone you can trust to get the job done right. Our team is uniquely qualified to find the root cause of your conventional foundation issues.\n\nWith over 37 years of combined experience in conventional foundation repairs, Superior Foundation Services has the construction expertise to address both foundation and framework/masonry issues. Frankly, we repair conventional foundations that the other guys won’t touch.\n\nFinally – and most importantly – we will not only repair the results of your foundation issues, but we will identify and fix the source of the problem to prevent future troubles. For any conventional foundation issues in central Mississippi, we’re here to make it right.\n\nFrench Drain Installation & Drainage Solutions\n\nA foundation company in Madison, MS that installs French drains? That doesn’t make sense!\n\nYes, it does! Water is the root cause of most foundation damage. Installing deep French drains can resolve underlying foundation problems AND prevent future damage. For many of the water management issues we fix, no repair work is required for the foundation itself. We install a drain to divert water away from the soil under your home, and this minimizes the chances for swelling or shrinking of the clay under your foundation.\n\nEven when foundation work is needed, part of the solution may be to install a drain to help prevent the same foundation issue from recurring.\n\nA proper water management plan is critical to protecting the foundation of your home. Our French drain installations are guaranteed to get to the root of your water management woes and minimize water’s negative impacts on your home’s foundation.\n\nPost-Tension Cables\n\nIf you want the strongest possible foundation for your home, start with post-tension cables in Madison, MS!\n\nFirst, high-grade steel cables in poly sleeves, called post-tension cables, are placed in a grid pattern according to precisely engineered specifications inside the slab. Then, after the foundation is poured, the cables are hydraulically tightened to required pressures to secure the foundation into one mass – eliminating the problems commonly associated with expansive soils here in Mississippi.\n\nThere are a wide variety of reasons for utilizing post-tension slabs versus conventional slabs. Post tension slabs are a form of pre-stressed slabs which means they are compressed prior to use so that the slabs are able to bear weight or service loads beyond their own natural weight. This is accomplished by pre-stressing cables which run throughout the slab and by compressing the concrete. Thus, the cables and slab are able to handle over 33,000 pounds of tension, making the slab stronger and less likely to crack. The purpose behind this is to avoid the common problems which are associated with typical concrete slab structures. This technique has been around for over 30 years and is the industry standard for pouring slabs in areas with expansive soils."
