        "text": "Endres Manufacturing Company Foundation, the company’s philanthropic arm, is proud to be involved in a community that gives back. Look around and consider all the resources, services, arts, and sports venues, health initiatives, and innovations that would not exist if not for philanthropic human beings. We are pleased that we are able to provide approximately $300,000 to community services annually. Since its beginning in 1996, EMC Foundation has given over $2.5 million to area non-profits in our 20-year history.\n\nWow! Every grant review period becomes more challenging and more motivating! In November 2022 our Foundation Trustees awarded grants to 22 non-profit agencies, for a grand total of $164,500.\n\nThe Foundation achieved their goal to grow the funds to $1,000,000 by 2006, the tenth anniversary, and continue to grow the funds. Our present annual giving level is approximately $100,000, with grants ranging from approximately $1,000 to $25,000. Grant requests are reviewed twice a year, in May and November.\n\nThe EMC Foundation Goals:\n\n• Give impacting gifts\n\n• Focus on community priorities\n\n• Promote collaborative matches\n\n• Foster philanthropic development\n\n• Not be a sustaining donor\n\nAll grant gifts are made possible through the generosity of Endres Manufacturing Company and the donations of the following friends and employees who work to quench the world’s thirst:\n\nYour contribution to the Endres Manufacturing Company Foundation makes a positive difference.\n\nWhether it’s the new DAIS Shelter to protect abused women and children, a Halloween party for people with special needs that Catholic Charities serves, a fishing trip for the handicapped through Adaptive Sportsmen, beds and cribs for the YWCA families, the Ronald McDonald wing at St. Mary’s Hospital, new equipment for the Waunakee Fire Department, or music scholarships for underprivileged children, many great causes and worthy people are served by EMC Foundation funds.\n\nEndres Mfg. Company gives a percentage of their annual profits, and with your additional help, the fund has grown to over $2.5 million in the past 12 years. Annually, approximately 40% of EMC Foundation funds go to children and family programs, 25% to education and business mentoring, 25% to the arts and cultural groups, and 10% to environmental concerns. All donations go directly to area non-profits, and no salaries or operation fees are taken from the foundation funds.\n\nAs Helen Keller once said, “Alone we can do so little. Together we can do so much.” Join us in our effort to make EMC a community contributor and asset builder. Your gift means so much to those who are receiving it.\n\nYou can make a tax-deductible contribution to EMC Foundation by writing a check and dropping it off at the company office, or mail it to 350 S. Hamilton Street, Madison WI 53703. It’s that simple. Your gift will make a difference.\n\nThank you.\n\nTo make a donation or to receive more information please contact Diane Ballweg. Email Diane here.\n\nWhen are the grant request deadlines?\n\nMay 1 and November 1, with responses being made by the end of those months.\n\nWhat is an appropriate size grant request?\n\nTypically the smallest grant given is $500 and the largest is $20,000. The Foundation tries to be creative in funding, sometimes giving matching challenges or funding part of a project with suggestions for additional funding sources. It depends on the request.\n\nAre there any recommendations?\n\nWhen making a request, it is helpful to provide the Foundation trustees with some levels of giving and options. For example: Big Brothers Big Sisters sponsored an event with giving levels at $1,000, $2,000, and $10,000, and in their grant request they clearly defined what was covered at each level.\n\nCan we submit more than one grant request?\n\nWe recommend only one grant request per period. You may submit a new request for each grant review period. Again, each request is studied and evaluated individually, so occasionally the Foundation has given to a particular organization multiple times. In other cases, the Foundation seeks to impact the community in a variety of ways, so we don’t want to become a regular funding source for a limited population.\n\nIs there a particular area of interest for the Foundation?\n\nOur primary focus includes programs that impact our community and our employees. If there is a connection to either of those areas, we pay particular attention to the need.\n\nWhere do I send the grant request application and materials?\n\nApplications must be emailed directly to Diane Ballweg.
