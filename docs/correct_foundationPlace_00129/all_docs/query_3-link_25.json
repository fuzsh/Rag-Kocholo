DISCOVER.\n\nThe Discovery Building was completed in 2010, marking a new chapter in WARFâ€™s long tradition of supporting the UW-Madison campus.\n\nThe first floor of the building, the Town Center, was designed as a central space where campus, community and industry could gather and discover more about the research and innovation that takes place at UW-Madison. Visitors to the Town Center can host their own event, participate in a variety of programs or enjoy a meal. WARF and our campus partners host many programs throughout the year, including lectures, demonstrations and field trips that bring the wider Wisconsin community onto campus.\n\nThe Discovery Building is also home to twin research institutes, the private Morgridge Institute for Research and the public Wisconsin Institute for Discovery. Their private-public collaboration helps facilitate breakthrough discoveries to advance health and well-being.\n\nPlan your visit to the Discovery Building\n\nReserve a space at the Discovery Building\n\nOffering inspiring spaces for rent by the campus and community. The building can accommodate expos, lectures, meetings, weddings and more.\n\nVISIT THE UW CONFERENCES & EVENTS SITE TO VIEW RESERVABLE SPACES\n\nPrograms for campus & community members\n\nThe Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery, known as the Discovery Building, is home to many programs that highlight science and creativity for campus and community members.\n\nVIEW WARF PROGRAMS\n\nVIEW MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE PROGRAMS\n\nVIEW WID EVENTS\n\nBuilding donors\n\nA generous gift from UW-Madison alumni John and Tashia Morgridge started the project.
