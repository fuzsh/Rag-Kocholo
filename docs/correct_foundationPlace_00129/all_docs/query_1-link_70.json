        "text": "In October 2015, the Foundation invited a group of journalists with a strong focus on health policy and state health reform to participate in a week-long fellowship program focused on health care in Wisconsin. The site visits in Milwaukee and Madison gave the journalists the opportunity to hear from a variety of experts and stakeholders on access to health care and insurance, quality of care and cost containment, managing pediatric population health, redesigning care delivery, and collaborative partnerships in health care. The program included a full-day briefing — led by Epic Systems Corp. founder and CEO Judy Faulkner at the company’s headquarters — on the role of electronic health record systems and their implications for health policy. Wisconsin’s health secretary and Medicaid director gave an update on the state’s approach to providing coverage to low-income residents while not implementing the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n2015 Wisconsin Site Visit Agenda\n\nThe Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured published a fact sheet that summarizes Wisconsin’s Health Care Landscape.
