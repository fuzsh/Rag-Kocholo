        "text": "A Foundation System Refuel project can be a long, complex process that often puts additional pressure on an already strained support team. It’s especially arduous if it's been a while since your Epic go-live and/or you have significantly customized your system. However, a Refuel project leads to easier and faster upgrades, higher Gold Stars and Honor Role ratings, and more standardization, making the significant effort worthwhile. Here are some key items to consider when preparing for a Refuel project:\n\nStrategize: One of the most important aspects of this project is to implement a strategy for maintaining a Foundation-like system. You may need a partner that can team up with application and master file owners to develop standard operating procedures and/or assist with the development of a deviation request process, advise on governance procedures, and help develop a strategy for quarterly upgrades.\n\nReview: You will need to review Epic's assessment and create an implementation plan with timelines and operational considerations based on the recommendations provided by Epic.\n\nOutsource: A strategic partner can assist with heavy lifting such as feature design and build, adoption sessions with stakeholders, training material development and ultimately, will take the load off your support team. Additionally, security experts should do a review of your template and EMP provisioning processes (common challenges during a Refuel project).\n\nWhile you may have limited resources, this type of project doesn’t have to weigh your team down or affect your organization’s ability to meet other critical project demand. By engaging with a strategic partner to guide and supplement your in-house staff during a Refuel, you can leverage the technical expertise of an experienced team to establish a strong foundation for future IT projects while still maintaining or exceeding standards in patient care. We have the experience and resources to help you through this process.\n\nNext Steps:"
