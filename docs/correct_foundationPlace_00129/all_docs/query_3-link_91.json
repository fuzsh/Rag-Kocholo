Skating is a life-long individual sport in which everyone can participate and we want to give everyone the opportunity to do so!\n\nPlease watch this area during the season for inclement weather conditions, and we will update this area if we decide to close the rinks for any reasons such as school closings.\n\nThough it is rare when we close the rink, it happens. When it does, this is where you will be notified, unless you have otherwise been told by your team/managers.\n\nThank you,\n\nManagement"
