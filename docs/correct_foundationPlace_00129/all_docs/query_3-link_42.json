        "text": "In 2014, the Wisconsin Alumni Association (WAA) merged with the UW Foundation to form the Wisconsin Foundation and Alumni Association (WFAA). As one organization, we provide a unified effort to engage alumni and friends who support and celebrate the UW. WFAA is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\n\nOur organization is deeply rooted in UW–Madison traditions. Both WAA and the UW Foundation were founded by alumni. Today we continue to operate separately from the UW, and honor our founders’ intentions to help our great public research university thrive."
