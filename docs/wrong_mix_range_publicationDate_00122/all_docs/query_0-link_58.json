        "text": "K. Allen Wood has contributed a gem of a story to The Zombie Feed Anthology Vol. 1 with “Goddamn Electric,” and those readers from the Northeast U.S. will likely recognize the deft portrayal of the region’s inhabitants. New Englanders don’t scare easy–maybe it’s the dark woods, or twisting dirt roads that don’t ever seem to go to the same place twice, or all the crumbling stone walls and old forgotten cemeteries–and Everett Sykes is no exception, even at a ripe old age. When mysterious dark clouds descend on Bridgetown and starts tossing vicious lightning like no one’s ever seen, he responds at first with calm rationalization from the shelter of his front porch. But as things get stranger, and people start coming back from the dead, crackling with the strange blue electricity from the clouds, Everett begins to realize that the world he knows has changed irrevocably. Survival is now squarely set on his own shoulders, and in typical New England fashion, he won’t be going down without a fight.\n\nYou can pick up your copy of The Zombie Feed Anthology on Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble.com, or from The Zombie Feed directly. Get it on your Kindle or your Nook (or in any e-format from Smashwords) for just $2.99! Seventeen awesome zombie stories for $2.99? It’s too good to be true! :D\n\n1. The Writing Question: What piece of writing advice would you give yourself if you could go back in time to when you started writing?\n\nWithout a doubt, start sooner.\n\nI’ve been writing since childhood. Unfortunately there was never anyone there to encourage me, to push me, so writing just kind of blended into the background of my life. It was always there, something I always did, but it was never really something I consciously acknowledged doing. I just did it. Like breathing.\n\nWhen I was around 12 or 13, I discovered Def Leppard and Run DMC and fell in love with music. I soon began playing the drums and guitar, then singing, and music quickly became this wonderful thing that I wanted to do in life. It became “the dream.” I was still writing of course, but music became this new thing that I needed to pursue. Or so I told myself.\n\nI joined the Air Force at 20, spent nearly ten years traveling the world, playing in a band here and there, writing songs at home, but never really doing anything on a serious level. I told myself that was because it wasn’t very feasible while in the military, which was largely true. But after I left the Air Force, I quickly learned that my desire to play in bands had long ago burned out.\n\nThat was about eight years ago. A few years passed and I slowly began to realized that writing was my true love. For the first time in my life I was consciously thinking about what I was doing. The light was coming on, so to speak. However, I continued to find it hard as hell to let go of the music thing, even though I hadn’t played the guitar in two years, and probably hadn’t written a song in four! But I still couldn’t let go. Then I read Stephen King’s On Writing, and this short, so-goddamn-obvious passage kicked my ass in gear:\n\n“Talent renders the whole idea of rehearsal meaningless; when you find something at which you are talented, you do it (whatever it is) until your fingers bleed or your eyes are ready to fall out of your head. Even when no one is listening (or reading or watching), every outing is a bravura performance, because you as the creator are happy. Perhaps even ecstatic.”\n\nWithin a month I had sold all my recording equipment and all my guitars save for one, my first. I began to write stories and polish them, finish them, rather than just doing rough drafts and moving on. And now, after years of polishing those stories, honing my skills, and reading, reading, reading, I’m slowly beginning to submit some of my work and even see some of it published.\n\nSo if I could go back in time, I’d take all those old notebooks full of stories and poems and lyrics, and I’d kick myself in the ass and say, “This is you, dude!”\n\n2. The Horror Question: What horror novel or short story are you ashamed (or proud) to admit you’ve never read?\n\nWay too many to name. I’m a slow reader, so I’ve missed out on a lot of the classics. But since it’s been sitting on my desktop for months now, I guess I’ll admit to never reading “The Lottery,” by Shirley Jackson.\n\nYou would think I’d have read what many consider to be one of the best horror tales ever written, but I never have. Been meaning to, of course. And in light of my previous answer, I probably should. Now.\n\n3. The Oddball Question: What, in modern society, do you consider to be the biggest waste of people’s time?\n\nTechnology.\n\nI’ve worked in the IT field since 1995, so I know how wonderful technology can be, but I also know how utterly pointless much of it is. Sadly, it sucks you in…and you like it. Trust me, I’ve spent countless hours wasting time surfing the Internet, arguing with dummies on forums, playing video games, and loved every minute of it. Technology is great. Technology sucks.\n\n#\n\nK. Allen Wood is a former musician and music journalist. His fiction has appeared in 52 Stitches, Vol. 2, The Zombie Feed, Vol. 1, and is forthcoming in Epitaphs, a Shroud Publications anthology. He is also the editor/publisher of Shock Totem, a bi-annual horror fiction magazine. He lives and plots in Massachusetts.\n\nFor more info, visit his website at www.kallenwood.com.\n\n(This was originally posted on the Apex Magazine blog in early 2011.)\n\nLife happens. That’s something I’ve learned day, by painstaking day, since I decided to pursue writing fiction seriously. Something is always getting in the way. During my senior year of college, it was the substantial strain of classes, thesis work, finals, getting engaged and prepping for an elopement, along with some stressful family health crises. After graduating, it was picking up a new volunteer side job, getting married, honeymooning overseas, coping with the inevitable end to one of the family health crises, moving across the country, renting our first apartment, and—oh yah!—finding a day job in a busted-up economy.\n\nI had always presumed, during those months of chaotic change and growth, that things would eventually settle down, and give me the time I’d need to finally be able to dig back into writing. They didn’t. If it wasn’t one thing, it was another. Juggling multiple responsibilities, multiple roles, and the ever-present flux of life, I finally had to admit to myself that there was never going to be a “good time” to write. If I was going to take writing seriously–as nothing short of a career goal–it would mean pushing it up my priorities ladder and making time.\n\nI’ve learned a few things about how to make all the tasks on my to-do list fit into a single day, and no—I’m often not as productive as I want to be. I’m a naturally messy, scatter-brained, stressed-out, over-extended creative type, who’s more likely to find things when they’re not put away in their “proper place.” It did not come easily, and I’m not done learning. Every new month, week, and day is a fresh learning opportunity for me. But of all the tiny, ah-ha! moments I’ve had to help me figure out the finesses of fitting the writing life into the rest of life, I’ve had four revelations that I always come back to. These are not secrets I’ve derived from the mysteries of the universe. In fact, they’re probably things you’ve heard before in different places, scattered throughout all the plentiful sources of writing advice. But let me boil it down to its essentials for those of you, like me, who wake up in the morning and think, “How on Earth am I going to get all this done, and write?”\n\n1. Decide it’s worth it. And sacrifice for it. – This was perhaps both the easiest and the hardest thing for me to understand when I started out. On the one hand, I knew I really, really, REALLY wanted to write. It was in my blood. I thought about it all the time. I scribbled scraps of story ideas on infinite post-it notes and in journals and on the back of my hand or a napkin. Sometimes I even sat down for an hour or two and hammered out the first half of a short story before life caught up with me again. I loved it, but I wasn’t making any progress. I didn’t have time to finish things, or polish things, much less submit things. It was frustrating, and that frustration fed right into that evil editor inside my head who was constantly whispering, “Come on. You really think you can do this?”\n\nI knew I had to do something, but it seemed like I’d already committed. I’d already said aloud to friends and family, and most importantly myself, that I wanted to focus seriously on writing. What was missing?\n\nIt took me writing out a schedule of my week, looking at how much time was spent doing any number of extra curricular activities, school work, actual day-job, and commuting (not to even mention making meals, sleeping, and spending time with family) to realize that even with the best intentions, I couldn’t possibly just “squeeze writing in” during those elusive downtime moments. I needed to cut back on things, to examine everything I was involved in and make the hard choices. If I wanted writing at the top of my priorities list, I had to make it the priority. I couldn’t feel that writing time was something that could be shifted, rescheduled, pushed off while I did things for other people. I had to start thinking about it as a career move, and that by skipping my writing time, or pushing other responsibilities ahead of it, I was cheating myself out of something really important. The writing time then came to symbolize “me time”: the time I spent working on something for myself, for my betterment, and as something that was important for my own happiness.\n\n2. Set (reasonable) goals. – It may sound simple, but it’s often not. It’s easy to say “I’ll finish four short stories in a month!” or “I’ll get this novel draft done in twelve weeks, tops.” Even something as seemingly simple as “I’ll write 1000 words a day” can be a recipe for falling off the wagon.\n\nI dream big, and often my aspirations are vastly more impressive than they are realistic. It’s important to set goals that you can actually hit despite your busy schedule, otherwise it’ll be all too easy to break the writing habit and let your resolve slide. Unobtainable goals, at least for me, make me sluggish, grumpy, and ultimately lazy. I’ll start off strong, but when I realize a goal is impossible to reach, my interest in even trying fades rapidly.\n\nI make those goals all with the best intentions, but I’ve had to learn who I am and what I can and can’t do in order to find ways to trick myself into being productive. It’s also important to get to know yourself and understand your weaknesses. For example: I’m highly distractible. Ask anyone: my husband, my friends, my parents, my sister—they’ll all tell you it’s true. Setting a goal to sit down and write for five hours on a Saturday will not work for me. I’ve tried. And I’ve failed many, many times. I’ll sit down, totally focused, for about one to two hours, and then my brain just won’t take it anymore. I’ll start daydreaming. I’ll need to get up for various things I need to keep going. I’ll take a “twenty minute break” which ends up encompassing the rest of the day.\n\nFor me, a goal of 500 words per day (excluding Saturdays) does the trick: it takes me approximately half-an-hour to write 500 words, whether I’m on a roll or repeatedly smacking my head against a wall. It’s just long enough for me to suck it up and stick it out, even when I really, really don’t want to, but not so long that I’ll give up prematurely. And often, I end up writing a lot more than just 500 words, because once I get past the idontwannas, things tend to flow surprisingly fast. So whether it’s a word-count goal you can actually achieve, or a time requirement, or just a sentence a day, reasonable goals can achieve a lot more than huge ones.\n\nBut don’t neglect setting reasonable long-term goals, too. I keep two lists (because lists keep this scattered mind in order): one for monthly goals, and one for the year’s goals. I don’t necessarily worry if I don’t hit these longer goals in exactly the time-frame I’m hoping, but they do tend to keep me on track, and moving in the right direction. I think part of the benefit for me of having lists like this is that it protects my distractible mind from dwelling on what I want to accomplish in the upcoming months and year: another trick for keeping in-the-moment and on-task.\n\n3. Reward yourself for achieving goals. – This doesn’t have to be expensive. I know a lot of authors who reward themselves with a new book, or chocolate, or a Starbuck’s coffee, for achieving their goals. Me, I’m even cheaper. I reward myself with stickers!\n\nSilly as it may seem, I’m a sucker for positive—if cheap—reinforcement. I’ve got a variety of stickers, some for big goals, some for little ones. Double my 500 word requirement for a day? Sticker! Submit a rejected story within 24 hours of its last rejection? Sticker!\n\nClock in 3k words in one sitting, or sell a story? HUGE FRIGGIN STAR.\n\nThe reward really only needs to be something that makes you smile, and gives you that little extra push when you’re close to achieving one of those reasonable goals. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve wanted to stop writing for the day, only to see that I’m at 897 words, and just a hundred more would get me a smiley sticker. ^_^\n\n4. Cut yourself some slack. – Here’s another hard lesson I learned after two years of getting very frustrated with my sluggardly progress. Life happens. It gets in the way, it clogs up the cogs, it throws you and everything else off the boat in the middle of the ocean. Sometimes, it’s important to just let go. Stop stressing. Take a walk. Take a week-long break. Breathe and recuperate. Read. Relax. Goals are great, but if you’re making yourself miserable because it’s the holidays and your kids are home from college and work is going nuts and you haven’t gotten more than four hours of sleep for the last two nights and you haven’t gotten your word count done for the past three days? Take the day off. Don’t beat yourself up with guilt that you aren’t writing. Just remember to take a look at your goal list and get back on the horse as soon as you can swing it (or even if you can’t—just make smaller goals and work your way back up!).\n\nHappy Writing!\n\nFor those of you out there who look at the daily helter-skelter rush of your life and think, “I can’t read a whole bunch of stories! I don’t have time between work and family and commuting and volunteering and housework and driving my kids to their extracurriculars and night school and my second job, not to mention squeezing my own writing in!”: you’re in luck! “The Twenty-Three Second Anomaly” by Ray Wallace is only two-and-a-half pages long! And it’s two and a half pages that pack a punch. Unlike some of the other stories, Wallace’s contribution to The Zombie Feed Anthology Vol. 1 takes on the government and scientific response to the suddenly rising epidemic of undead with tight, quick-paced prose that will pull you through the story and leave you a bit breathless, but satisfied. And it’ll probably only take you about a minute to read! So no excuses. Get your hands on Ray Wallace’s “The Twenty-Three Second Anomaly” today in The Zombie Feed Anthology Vol. 1!\n\nYou can pick up your copy of The Zombie Feed Anthology on Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble.com, or from The Zombie Feed directly.

The Writing Question: What story (published or unpublished) of yours is your personal favorite and why?\n\n“One of the Six”. Not that it’s my best story (an H.P. Lovecraft/Clive Barker inspired tale that I have to admit I still enjoy reading on occasion all these years later) but it’s the one that got everything rolling for me. In 1998, I had yet to publish my first story. I had sent a few out, had managed to start my rejection letter collection, but not much else. Then I came across a website called The Chiaroscuro. They were holding their second fiction contest and I was told by the site’s creator, Brett Savory, that if I had a story ready to go then I should enter. There were some pretty well known judges, including Brian Hodge, so the idea was a little intimidating. I did have a story ready, though, called “One of the Six” and I figured, why the hell not? A couple of weeks later, I was informed that my story had made it into the final round of entries. A week after that, I was told that I had taken first place. That was the moment that I realized that, hey, maybe I actually can do this writing thing. The story’s still online at the site (now Chizine) for anyone interested in checking it out: www2.chizine.com/oneofsix.htm\n\n2. The Horror Question: Some writers claim that writing dark stories is easier than writing light ones. True or false for you, and why?\n\nTrue. Unquestionably. And the answer, as far as I’m concerned, is a simple one: Because writing dark stories is so much more fun! By working within the literary realms of dark fiction a writer can do pretty much anything that he or she feels like doing. Want to send someone to Hell? Unleash a global apocalypse? Make the dead walk? (As I do in my upcoming One Way Out Novel, Escape From Zombie City, coming soon from TZF Press – – now there’s a shameless plug for you.) Make a sword that steals souls? An army of relentless cyborgs? A weapon that can destroy entire worlds? As a writer of dark fiction, you can do all of that and so much more. You also get to create atmosphere. Fog shrouded cemeteries. Crumbling old mansions. Desolate landscapes. Try doing any of that while writing a “light” story. Sorry, not going to work. And not going to be nearly as much fun to create either.\n\n3. The Oddball Question: Are you an e-reader or tree reader, or both? Why?\n\nI’ve recently become both. After purchasing a Kindle about a year ago, I find myself spending most of my money on e-books instead of paper books. The reason for this is a simple one: I’ve collected more than 2,500 hard copy books over the years and, basically, I’m just sick of dealing with them. Especially when it’s time to move. Nothing will put your back through the ringer quite as much as lugging around boxes full of books. Also, it’a all about instant gratification. If I see a book online that catches my interest and it’s, say, two o’clock in the morning, I love being able to aquire it instantaneously as opposed to waiting a week for it to arrive by mail. Although, I have to admit, that ever since I got my Kindle the impulse buying has increased rather dramatically. Ah, well, I guess you can never own too many books. Especially when they don’t weigh anything.\n\n#\n\nRay Wallace hails from the Tampa, FL area and is the author of The Nameless, a hardcore horror novel published by Black Death Books. He has two forthcoming releases: Escape from Zombie City: A One Way Out Novel (The Zombie Feed Press) and The Hell Season (Severed Press). More than two dozen of his short stories have appeared in such magazines and anthologies as The Zombie Feed: Vol. 1, The Blackest Death Vol. 1 & 2, Erotic Fantasy: Tales of the Paranormal, and at Bloodfetish, Dark Muse, and Delirium Online. A few of his other stories have appeared at The Chiaroscuro website where he took first place in their second annual fiction contest. He also wrote a long running book review column for The Twilight Showcase webzine and now writes reviews for Chizine and SFReader.com.\n\nOk, so anybody who follows this blog regularly knows pretty well by now that aside from writing original fiction, I also write a very, very long fanfiction called The Thief Dilemma set in the Eidos Thief trilogy (mostly The Metal Age, though, if I’m being honest). This was a story I started alllllll the way back in Junior year of high school, and when I wrote the first scene, it was just to prove a silly point: if I ever actually had to do anything in that game for real, I’d fail miserably. Picking someone’s pocket? Yeah, I’m too nervous and clumsy to pull that off. Blackjacking someone to unconsciousness? Um…yeah…I’m not that mean. Then get into the guilt-trips I’d actually suffer from (via myself) if I actually broke into someone’s home and took their valuables. I know for a fact that pulling a bow string is FRICK hard, and my aim–which has gone unpracticed since elementary, back before I could (or–let’s be honest–even now I can’t) pull the string on my dad’s compound bow–was not so good. Hefting a broadsword? HA. Try again, skinny arms.\n\nThe games themselves where a huge part of my life back in mid high school, particularly The Metal Age, which mixed medieval cathedrals, twisting city streets, and a sense of ancientness in with some awesome steam-powered machines. I have always loved the juxtaposition of old-tech with new-tech. Just see my post about the game Riven. The Metal Age not only had awesome design (albeit, computer graphics have come a long way since), but the storyline and the characters were GREAT. Garrett, the thief through whom you see the world, is the snarkiest in TMA, constantly making little snap comments on the side that perpetually made me laugh. The Mechanists were the perfect creepy religious sect with their minion of robots and mechanical Servants (who used to be human, no less). The world-building isn’t extensive–you focus almost entirely on a single city, occasionally venturing out to one or two new locations, though you never see much of your travel to those spots–but what’s there is solid. Plus, the sneaking, creeping,\n\nsword-and-arrow wielding game-play was incredibly appealing to someone like me who typically is not sneaky, and not creeping (much), and certainly isn’t sword-and-arrow wielding, unless you mean a wooden practice sword, and even then, I wouldn’t fear for my life if I was you. I’ll admit it freely: I am (and have always been) a bit of a goody-two-shoes. I think way too hard about consequences, and as a kid, I never suffered from the “immortal” complex. I would admit I’m probably a bit of a coward. I’ve always admired those who could throw caution to the wind and just see where the pieces fell. Me? I’d be too worried about catching all the pieces to even throw them in the first place.\n\nSo having a game where I can do pretty much whatever I want (and there are separate philosophies, I’ll have you know, in the Thief community, about killing people in the game and whether or not–as a thief, not a murderer, they say–you should or not), it’s pretty liberating. At the same time, I still managed to worry about the morality of committing crimes against fictional or AI characters just because I know (or think I know) that they don’t feel pain, and are not “really” alive. Is something wrong even when you know there are no consequences? It’s a moralistic dilemma that plagued me in high school (thus leading to the title of The Thief Dilemma, which refers to just that).\n\nWith The Thief Dilemma, I’ve been trying to explore that very theme, as well as some other more meta ideas about life/death/souls/etc. I do use characters from the original games, or groups from the original games, as accents. Garrett shows up here and there in all his angry glory, but he’s not a main character in my story. Artemus, a member of the mysterious Keepers, shows up about as much as Garrett does. Basso, who plays a bit of a larger roll in my story than he ever did in the games, is a fun character to work in now and then as a point of maturity amongst a bunch of hot-head teens and twenty(*mumblethirtymumble)-somethings. I’ve made extensive use of the Hammerite (Builder cult), Mechanist (Karras cult), Pagan (Trickster cult), and City Guard (just a bunch of jerks) mythologies. But the vast majority of the story is carried by my own original characters: the two silly seventeen year olds who were originally me and my high school friend D—-, but have since evolved into their own characters as they learn how inept they are at thieving; the amateur, self-centered thief who always manages to get stuck with them; the feisty bar wench who knows the streets and can take care of herself, at least until things get really bad; and the young City Guard’s son, now a protegee Keeper acolyte, who knows Keeper magic upside down and backwards, and is quite pleased with himself.\n\nI’ve had an absolutely blast writing this story, even though I know I will never be able to do much more with it than just leave it up on the web. It’s also one of the longest pieces I’ve ever written, and is proving that it will be the longest still by the time I finish it this year (at long last, after nearly eight years of a chapter every two to six months). It’s provided me with a great sounding board for looking at why I have so much trouble with original novel-length work, and has always been the project that reminds me that writing should be fun. I don’t have to worry about “where to submit” it, because I can’t. I have no pressure on me to write anything but what I want to write in this story. No constraints, save for the rules of the world.\n\nAnd I think that’s where the value of fanfiction comes in: it’s like writing with training wheels. You don’t have to build a world from scratch (which can seem a daunting task when you’re starting out), and you don’t have to create a whole history for that world. There’s already a cannon, and you have to stick relatively close to it (or at least make it VERY clear where you’re diverging so it’s an “alt-” story). It’s kind of like Jane Austen’s two inches of ivory: you can only do so much, but within that two inches, you can fit the world if your creative enough and have a fine enough brush. It’s safe to write fanfiction; in some ways, you’re preaching to the choir, because those who read your story in it’s specific fan category are likely already fans of the cannon. It means you can’t make gross errors with the cannon, but if you follow the established rules all right, you may find folks really enjoy your stuff. Ideally, of course, through the fanfiction I’m hoping to learn a little about my novel-writing style, to find out what my personal weaknesses are and what I need to do to make an original novel move smoothly forward like TTD does. Hopefully, that will not require me to write one chapter a month, like I’m doing now, though that definitely helps. It keeps my attention span from getting too distracted by other, shorter, flashier projects, and though it certainly creates inconsistencies throughout the main text (like, in TTD, I realized a few months ago that Megan has lost her glasses, and I’m not quite sure where they went…but she hasn’t seemed to have any trouble seeing! XD, but overall I think it has created a story that while, yes, it would need editing if I were to submit it (which I can’t–weee! liberation!), it’s got a good solid bulk of story in it that I absolutely love. Every few months I get an itch to read some particular section, and I’ll go to my much-beaten print-out of all 200 something pages, and I’ll reread and reread and laugh and giggle to my heart’s content, because at the end of the day, I write this fanfiction for me. :0)\n\nIf you’re looking for an original take on the classic zombie-survival story, look no further than Simon McCaffery’s story in The Zombie Feed Vol. 1, “Lifeboat.” Recently separated Jack Anthony wasn’t thinking that a cruise ship would be the best bet for survival when he and his teenage son Nick decided to spend spring break on board the Mystique: sometimes survival has more to do with luck than with foresight. But when the dead do arise, a floating fortress is just about the best place to hole up. “Lifeboat” is a survival story–it’s got the blazing guns, the rushing hoard, the hapless victims–but it’s more than that. This story has very real characters you will root for, even when all the odds seem to be stacked against them, and the setting is wonderfully realized. So if you’re interested in an adventure trip with some great companions, definitely sink your teeth into Simon McCaffrey’s “Lifeboat” in The Zombie Feed Vol. 1!\n\nYou can pick up your copy of The Zombie Feed Anthology on Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble.com, or from The Zombie Feed directly.

That’s crazy efficient! :D\n\n1. The Writing Question: If you could sit down with one author, from any time in history to today, to get a writing lesson, who would it be?\n\nThis is a difficult question, because the list is so long. I imitated the styles of Richard Matheson and Stephen King in many of my early published stories, and what wouldn’t I do to perform the Vulcan mindmeld on Tom Disch, Peter Straub and Thomas Harris? Or bring back Michael Crichton, the king of the plausible techno-thriller? But if I could sit down with a single author for some writing advice, it would be Alfred Bester. I’ve read thousands of books in my lifetime, but I remember where I was and what I was doing when I stumbled across The Stars My Destination. No writer has ever equalled that novel’s thrilling blend of speculative science, sociology and pure, breakneck-paced adventure. Bester was a master of sly and perceptive commentary on society and human psychology, and his dizzying blends of SF, horror and thrillers have never been surpassed. And could he breathe life into unforgettable characters? Who has ever been able to forget Gully Foyle? My son read the novel when he was thirteen, and it’s still his favorite. It probably will be when he’s sixty.\n\n2. The Horror Question: Blood and gore: scary or not scary?\n\nI sold a story some years ago called “Little Men” to Algis Budrys. I had submitted several conventional science fiction stories to TOMORROW, but the story he accepted was a ghost story missing a ghost. I challenged myself to write a contemporary gothic tale of a haunted house, but it couldn’t involve any supernatural spirits. I came up with a pretty unusual, nasty premise, and Budrys commended me for not showing the reader the creatures — allowing the imagination to fill in the blanks. He was right. The more you reveal, the more you may lessen the impact. A writer also must decided when blood and gore are appropriate to the tale, but I’ve found that less is usually more. This also applied to stories I sold to John Skipp and Craig Spector for Book of the Dead 2 andMondo Zombie. If you have to dunk your readers like doughnuts in blood and gore to frighten or shock them, you need to go back and strengthen your storytelling skills.\n\n3. The Oddball Question: What was your favorite toy or game as a child?\n\nBesides the Aurora monster and television sci-fi model kits my father brought home from his travels, my favorite childhood toy was a Corgi Toys die-cast Batmobile. Dad bought one each for my brother and I when our Icelandic Airlines plane was grounded for six hours in Iceland having an engine repaired. These toy cars were the pinnacle of late 1960s die-casts with a tremendous attention to detail, and best of all, lots of working gadgets like a chain-cutter and a thumb-wheel that fired tiny orange plastic pellets from the car’r rocket stacks. I began collecting those old cars again ten years ago. Like my old Aurora model kits, they’ve gained a lot of collectibility over the decades. God knows what happened to my childhood Batmobile, but the ones I own today rest safe and sound behind glass.\n\n#\n\nSimon McCaffery saw his first UFO at age ten and encountered the undead the following summer — it was a drunk shambling through the French Quarter at dusk, but it sure as hell looked like a zombie — so it’s no wonder he grew up to write SF, horror and hybrids of both genres. Simon’s stories have appeared in Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine, Tomorrow SF, Space & Time and in anthologies such as Book of the Dead 2: Still Dead and Mondo Zombie. His latest story appears in BLACK STATIC #24, and another story will appear in the upcoming anthology Zombie Kong. He lives in Tulsa, Okla.

It’s been a busy week. ^_^ Starting with Labor Day weekend down at my folks’ place was great, but the apartment was a wreck, per usual. So when Tuesday rolled around, I at least managed to creep out of the house long enough during my lunch break to go grocery shopping and at least make it so we weren’t starving like the *last* two weeks when we didn’t make time for a grocery run. All I can say is that while we didn’t succumb to “Ketchup Soup” (recipe: ketchup, hot tap water, salt + saltine crackers), we were definitely scraping the bottom of the pantry. But! We got the kitchen restocked as of Tuesday, thank goodness, and the pile of dishes is slowly coming down, which is also good. Still have a lot of boxes to unpack, but since we haven’t needed the stuff for about a month, it’s hard to get motivated to see what’s in there. ^_^\n\nI’ve been reading a lot too, in my spare time. Dhalgren by Samuel R. Delany mostly (*amaaaazing*), but I’ve been plowing through A Tale of Two Clocks (Legacy) by James H. Schmitz also (hilarious!). Having a lot of fun with both for totally different reasons. Delany always reminds me that there’s so much more to writing than just laying down sentences. He has such a finesse to his writing that pulls out the potently real amidst very unreal happenings. And I love his dialogue. Schmitz is just fun. I love Trigger. She’s hilarious–and just such a fun heroine in a field that often (myself included) seems to portray “tough” girls as stiff, cold, and mean to compensate for having a…well…you know… It’s such a riot, and I’m so glad I’m getting a chance to read it. :)\n\nI’ve actually been writing all week, but haven’t had a chance to post anything about it. Probably good, because most of the last few days would have probably just consisted of whining.\n\nToday’s Session – 8AM-9AM – Finished TFGoOS! At LAST! Holy crap, my brain hurts. I’ve been so ready for this story to end for so long! It probably gets ridiculously thin toward the end, but I’m okay with that for now. Rough draft, finished. PHEW.\n\nI need to work on something else. Anything else. Finished re-reading Hope City and it’s not so bad, actually. I’m going to try to summary-draft it out moving forward, so we’ll just see if that can’t pull itself together. Need to consider rewrites, too, of Learning to Laugh and a few others. GOSH. I just want to write something short and new! Like this one untitled vengeance story. I’ve been obsessed with that one in mind, but gosh–it’s gotta be short. Tight and short. Maybe 3.5k tops. I want it tiiiiiight. Which means I’ve got to plan ahead, got to really reel it in and get it started at the meat. Need to spend some thinking time on that.\n\nHave also been–sneakily–working on a summary draft for Shadow Engines. It’s my illicit little project on the side that I don’t fully admit I’m working on. Chances are, it’ll all fall to pieces in a few sections, but I gotta say, I LOVE summary drafting it. It’s going places I didn’t anticipate, but that I think will actually maybe make it richer in the long run. We’ll see, we’ll see.\n\nFor now, I’m going to listen to a genetics lecture and then maybe watch a bit of Dead Like Me, which I rather like! :)\n\nI’m not doing so well on this 2hr thing–I can really only stay focused on one project (if not summary drafting with music playing) for about a half-hour to 45 minutes. I trained myself so well on that 500 words/day thing–it’s cemented into my brain. I think to overcome that, I’m just going to have to get better at running two projects at a time: one new words, one revision. I think that’ll work in the long run. And I NEED to do that with Learning to Laugh. There’s a deadline for an antho I think it could work for, so if I want that one done up and polished for that, I darn well better get started on it. It’s the having lost my notes thing that’s driving me half mad about it. I *know* I wrote down what I wanted to do there, and not being able to remember it is making me batty. OMG I just FOUND THEM. Like… JUST NOW. I was like “hey, I wonder if they’re in XXX notebook,” and BAM. Here they ARE! Ok, no excuses now. I gotta polish up that story. :)\n\nMonica Valentinelli’s contribution to The Zombie Feed Vol. 1 is a visceral, irreverent, stream-of-consciousness narrative from the perspective of troubled Officer Mike Francis, a badge-carrying member of civilized society’s last-stand response to a world gone mad. It’s not the zombies Office Mike worries about–with a little fire, he can manage them–it’s all the other nutcases left behind, the ones who hide behind their fancy gated mansions and pretend like nothing’s changed. With them, you just never know what to expect, and that can be deadly. This is no quiet tale of love and loss: it’s a story that cuts to the quick and reveals the rotten madness even the living try to hide.

The Writing Question: Do you tend to plan your stories before you write them, or do you write and just see what you discover in the process?\n\nDepends upon the story. If I’m writing on spec, I have to hear the story in my head otherwise the prose is robotic and stunted. If I’m writing “to” spec, on the other hand, I often work with the editor or project manager to make sure I’m fitting whatever voice they need for the publication. Then, I let that idea simmer for a bit before I start working on a draft. Longer stories like novels and novellas, on the other hand, I have to plot out regardless. Otherwise I wind up wasting precious time because I have no idea where Plot A begins and Plot D ends.\n\n“Tomorrow’s Precious Lambs” was interesting because I heard a song in my head before I sat down to write it. Wrote the song first, then the story. The process felt like I was writing a creepy refrain to a musical pastiche. I think this was the fastest story I’ve ever written and polished because it was just that clear in my head. Doesn’t always happen that way, though I wish it would.\n\n2. The Horror Question: Some writers claim that writing dark stories is easier than writing light ones. True or false for you, and why?\n\nTrue! When I write in the dark, I focus on conflict and contrast. What isn’t dark, as opposed to why the dark is so terrible. Why did the dark infiltrate into a normal world? Where did the dark come from? Those questions help me develop the world I want to tell my story in. Then I hone in on characterization. How does that character feel about the dark? What is their role in that world? Are they contributing to the dark, or are they fighting against it?\n\nWriting lighter themes requires me to employ different techniques for conflict, plotting and characterization. Satire or black humor is still dark enough, but when it comes to penning the happy, happy… I often feel those stories come across as disingenuine and not compelling enough to submit to any market. Mind you, I am my own worst critic, but what can I say? I like big guns, vampires, and a little blood in my stories. :)\n\n3. The Oddball Question: If you could be friends with one fictional character, who would it be and what kind of venue would you meet at?\n\nI am a huge “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” fan, so I would have to say Arthur Dent would be that guy. In terms of what venue? A pub, of course! I’d gladly share a pint just to hear about his travels and near misses. Especially with the Vogons and their terrifying bouts of poetry. ‘Course, I’d ask him to take me along on a trip or two…\n\n#\n\nMonica Valentinelli is a professional author and game designer.
