A raw ranking of them would be of little use to others, unless I explained why I gave them the ranks I did, and anyway I'd probably give different rankings by the time your read this.

At the moment, I'd say his three best are Gateway, The Space Merchants and the Eschaton Sequence (taken as a whole), but I'm open to persuasion.]\n\nBlack Star Rising\n\nThe Eschaton Sequence [Series premised on Frank Tipler's Omega Point Theory, only correcting a serious defect in Tipler's formulation, viz., realizing that there's no reason why Omega should be benevolent.]\n\nThe Other End of Time\n\nThe Siege of Eternity\n\nThe Far Shore of Time\n\nGateway [The sequels are OK]\n\nHomegoing\n\nMining the Oort\n\nNarabedla Ltd.\n\nO Pioneer!\n\nOutnumbering the Dead\n\nThe World at the End of Time\n\nand C.

It has all the virtues: plot, character, world-building, neat ideas, description, suspension of disbelief, prose style (at least eight, all handled expertly), nuance of language and allusion and construction. \"The Scholar's Tale\" in Hyperion reduced me to tears; \"The Detective's Tale\", immediately following, is a hilarous dead-pan satire of hardboiled detective stories. Simmons must have cackled while writing this book, thinking of what he was doing to the reader's mind. It deserved every award which was thrown at it and more. The second set of novels, Endymion and Rise of Enydmion, are however vastly inferior.]\n\nHyperion\n\nFall of Hyperion\n\nMary Sisson\n\nTrang\n\nTrust\n\nTribulations\n\nJohn Sladek\n\nKristine Smith, Code of Conduct\n\nK.

Very plainly a first novel, but very amusing to anyone who's attended an American college of over, say, 20,000 students. The first edition has an especially embarrassing cover.]\n\nCryptonomicon [No visible SF elements. I liked the historical part, during the Second World War, far better than the modern story about the descendants of those characters. Said characters are, principally, twerps and idiots. (Will somebody tell me why the cornflakes scene is supposed to be funny?) Plus, Stephenson rode various unruly hobby-horses with them, showing profound cluelessness about economics. And the ending was bizarre and pointless --- whereas normally his endings are strained, abrupt and unsatisfying. But the WWII story was brilliant.]\n\nThe Diamond Age, or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer\n\nSnowcrash\n\nBruce Sterling\n\nAscendancies [Best-of stories]\n\nThe Caryatids\n\nCrystal Express [Stories]\n\nDistraction\n\nA Good Old-Fashioned Future [Stories]\n\nThe Hacker Crackdown [Nonfiction, actually]\n\nHeavy Weather\n\nHoly Fire\n\nIslands in the Net\n\nPirate Utopia\n\nSchismatrix [Now available in Schismatrix Plus, the plus being a new introduction and about half the stories earlier collected in Crystal Express, which are set in the same universe]\n\nTomorrow Now: Envisioning the Next Fifty Years [Nonfiction, 2002]\n\nZeitgeist [Taking the social construction of reality seriously is so science fiction]\n\nR.

For instance, I don't think I've ever read a better portrayal of the special intoxication which comes when sexual love coincides with intellectual collaboration. And The Praxis, in particular, contains an embedded novella about identity, ambition, friendship and betrayal which is simply devastating.]\n\nThe Praxis\n\nThe Sundering\n\nConventions of War\n\nImpersonations\n\nInvestments\n\nThe Accidental War\n\nFleet Elements\n\nImperium Restored\n\nFacets [Stories]\n\nKnight Moves\n\nImplied Spaces\n\nVoice of the Whirlwind\n\nThe near-future-if-not-present alternate reality game series:\n\nThis Is Not a Game\n\nDeep State\n\nThe Fourth Wall\n\nConnie Willis\n\nAnd Not Forgetting the Dog [Sequel to Doomsday Book, but can be enjoyed independently]\n\nImpossible Things [Stories]\n\nDoomsday Book [Prequel to the title story in Fire Watch, but can be enjoyed --- if that is the word --- independently]\n\nFire Watch [Stories]\n\nRemake\n\nGene Wolfe\n\nThe Book of the New Sun\n\nShadow of the Torturer\n\nClaw of the Conciliator\n\nSword of the Lictor\n\nCitadel of the Autarch\n\nThe Book of the Long Sun\n\nNightside the Long Sun\n\nLake of the Long Sun\n\nThere Are Doors\n\nDavid Wong, Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits\n\nJohn Wyndham\n\nConsider Her Ways [Stories]\n\nDay of the Triffids\n\nGooseflesh and Laughter [Stories]\n\nKraken\n\nThe Midwich Cuckoos\n\nRoger Zelazny\n\nCreatures of Light and Darkness\n\nThe Doors of His Face, the Lamp of His Mouth [Stories]\n\nDoorways in the Sand\n\nFour for Tomorrow\n\nJack of Shadows\n\nLord of Light [Review by Danny Yee]\n\nMy Name is Legion\n\nSarah Zettel\n\nFool's War\n\nThe Quiet Invasion\n\nBitter Angels (as \"C.
