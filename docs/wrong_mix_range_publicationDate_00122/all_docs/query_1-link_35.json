        "text": "It was inevitable, since it’s January and I just read Assault on the Deadwood Stage, that I would be reading some weird westerns.\n\nReview: Six-Guns Straight From Hell 3, eds David B. Riley and J. A. Campbell, 2020.\n\nIn the past, we have been most appreciative of the efforts of Mr. Riley, both by himself and with a company of selected writers, in presenting the sort of tales known as “weird westerns”. These stories of marvel bring strangeness and horror into the lands and times of this great country’s expansion and settlement. The wonders displayed to us may be marvelous and horrible creatures invented solely by Mr. Riley’s authors or the introduction of fabled beasts into the western lands or, on occasion, some fanciful extension of the sciences and inventions which have brought so many modifications of our old ways of life.\n\nIt is with regret that we must say Mr. Riley’s latest offering in this area is quite disappointing not only in its tales but even its basic presentation.\n\nSam Knight is an author that has found favor with us before and who has given us stories of imagination that also take care to present those times in an accurate way. However, his “Leaving Dry Gulch on the Midnight Train” is too stuffed, a complaint, which we will see, is somewhat unique to the offerings here. His story starts out with mystery and dreaded doom as Mr. Grandy, manager of the railroad station of Dry Gulch, Colorado, hears mournful train whistles in the midnight air. But they are not those of Dry Gulch’s weekly train, and Mr. Grandy’s has heard their like before the town’s tragedy of twenty-one miners grievously dying in a gas explosion in the local zinc mine. The impending festivities of nineteen couples anticipating their nuptials on “Wedding Day” does nothing to ease Mr. Grandy’s apprehensions while he deals with a new employee of the railroad learning his duties.\n\nWhile, at story’s end, Knight gives us a wonderous vision, its effect is too much weakened by reference to events we have not been presented to us including the appearance of a citizen who does not seem to be human. Upon investigation, we have learned that this tale is joined to an earlier project of Riley’s, Tales of Dry Gulch. The effect of seemingly bringing so much into this tale from that earlier book rather gives us the impression of having an interesting story interrupted at the end by the half-heard story of some eccentric family.\n\nWe are not sure when the curious method of a doomed character giving us his account without recording it in some way and with no one present was first invented, but Matthew Hellman avails himself of it in “My Nameless Beast”. He presents us a thoroughly bad man fleeing after a murder and robbery and aided by a magnificent, intelligent horse he has stolen. As is his custom, he considers many appellations for his mount. But, as events progress, the horse gives less in aid and assumes a menacing presence. It is one of the few tales in this book where the author has endeavored to give us atmosphere and a voice appropriate to his tale.\n\nMr. Riley himself gives us the enigmatic“Whatever Happened to Ignacio Cortez?” We are introduced to an exceedingly calm and nonplussed Abigail Perkins who has experienced the horror of the Cortez brothers, on the day of her sixteenth birthday, killing her mother and attempting a violation of her body as well as that of Miss Perkins. Two of the vile men are killed by Miss Perkins, but the remaining one, Ignacio, is only wounded. On his way to trial, he gives Miss Perkins a strange watch with the words “Killing time” and “Perdition” written on it. Marvelous events ensue though Riley does not tell us what the watch is exactly.\n\nOn many occassions, the word “underdeveloped” occurs to us when reading this book’s stories, and so it is with Patrick Dorn’s “A Taste of Purgatory”. It is little more than a tale of attempted vulgar humor and events that do not shock or engender horror. We are presented with a defrocked preacher attending the call of nature in an outhouse and a fiery and stinking mass emergeing from the depths to consume him.\n\nWe welcome the inclusion of figures from the history of the frontier into these “weird westerns”. They are often depicted in ways paradoxical from our knowledge of them or as being involved in some occulted activity we were not cognizant of. John Kiste’s “Tinhorn Tintype” is of this type. Granted, he does not give us a famous personage but, instead, Camillus Fly which some may recognize as the proprietor of the photography studio adjacent to the locale of the famed Gunfight at the OK Corral. Mr. Fly has acquired, from the mayor of Tombstone, a camera which has recorded the unquiet deaths of several Indians, and Fly believes it has captured their souls. In the wake of the famed fracas, Mr. Fly’s brother captures the image of Billy Clanton as he expires. Yet, the proof of Mr. Fly’s contention is quite anticlimactic, a story that uses apparitions but does little to develop drama from their presence.\n\nKristal Stittle’s “Grober” is not much more than another battle between a man and a monstrous beast though here our “hero”, Dale Beckerson, is aided by his faithful horse Muriel. We learn that the grobers are known to all peoples and governments though not spoken of. Beckerson has inherited his vocation from his father and must turn, in his solitary quest, to occasionally turn to robbery to supply his needs and obtain gold, a substance of great use when confronting these beasts. While it possesses little novelty apart from its monsters, at least Stittle has given us emotion and character in his story.\n\nRob Francis’ “God’s Own Land” offers us another tale of battle with fabulous beasts though of a more complicated sort. Its hero, known only by the appellation “Scout” in honor of his army service (and he, perhaps, is a deserter) joins a party into the lands along the Gila River that have recently been liberated from Mexico. There they find a curiously abandoned town they seek to rehabilitate. But soon “sand lions” show up to render violent death, a horror heightened by their motives and the revelation of their secret confederate. While not a tale destined to live long in memory, it is another acceptable entertainment.\n\nWe have not had a great fondness for the majority of works we have encountered from David Boop’s hands (though his “Bleeding the Bank Dry” did find favor with us) and his “The Metal Skins” is no exception. He again gives us a tale taking place in and around the cursed town of Drowned Horse. While the use of use of “metal men” operated by strange creatures with the intent of provoking a war between white and Indian is of interest, Bopp denies us details of this scheme that are of obvious interest. Also, we hear too little of the nature and motives of the genius behind them.\n\nThough he is a desperate and dangerous man of criminal disposition, Bryan Stubbles compels us to avidly follow his narration in “The Surest Shot”. As he is dying, he is determined to avenge himself on the posse pursuing him. But we must also note that this tale again uses the old chestnut of a deal-with-the-devil.\n\nRoss Baxter starts his “Foolproof Plan” with an account of troubling grandeur, the desolation of the fortunes and peoples of America when a plague known as The Wrath arises. It transforms its victims, though its means of spread seem peculiar, into violent people. When the story starts, America’s ports are blockaded by foreign powers to prevent the spread of the sickness, and anarchy has overtaken much of the country. Our hero, Texas Ranger Captain Chats Harris, is of an age making him fixed in habits so he continues his duties and is called to investigate the cult of a defrocked clergyman, Father Murphy, who claims to chose who will catch the fearsome disease. Harris seeks to apprehend him, but what ensues seems a rash action by him and also makes the story seemingly a prelude to a larger tale Baxter wants to tell.\n\nJames Fitzsimmons’ “Fiori’s Cabinet of Curiosities” illustrates that a furious hurly-burly of action does not a satisfying tale make. It seems as if it is a schema of a larger work, perhaps half of a novel, and has no time to develop either drama or character. Fitzsimmons thinks that, at this present age, the skillful use of firearms by Pinkerton agent April O’Casey and her contemplation of pressing physical intimacy on her parter is more novel than it is. Into this fitful mix is also a magical cabinet that conveninetly provides aid to both heroes and villains alike.\n\nWe can commend Bert Edens for matching grasp and reach in his “Blood, Mud and Retribution”, a simple, if compelling, beater-beaten story in which a soiled dove, brutalized by a customer, takes her revenge.\n\nOr should we know the story under the title “Death’s Horse” and presented by K. C. Grifant for, in a disgraceful lapse in the care of presentation, there is a story under that title that is identical to the aforementioned “Blood, Mud, and Retribution”? However, we believe credit must be given to Edens given the latter title being more appropriate to this tale.\n\nC. W. Blackwell’s “Apostles of the Spider God” also deals with unfortunate ladies of the evening, here driven from their town into the desert. Most die, but the survivor meets an ancient god in a cave in which she seeks shelter. The means of vengeance is offered to her.\n\nMore monsters are battled in “Manifest Destiny” by A. K. McCarthy. It is a thrilling, well-presented drama of a wagon train beset by a horror out of the night. Our heroine, Madeline Montague, is courageous and inventive, but, at story’s end, she has, perhaps, not survived unscathed.\n\nA tale of friendship formed in the cauldron of the Civil War is at the heart of J. A. Campbell’s “Survive til Dawn”. A marshal and a preacher confront the depredations of a skinwalker on a mining camp and group of Indians. It is pleasant enough but not remarkable, and it is hinted that we will have further adventures from these two.\n\nRadar DeBoard’s “Dead Hand Shooting” is a simple but well-told tale of revenge. A man unjustly lynched by a corrupt sheriff and his gang returns from the grave to render violent justice.\n\nThere is a bitter, sardonic use of history with “In Return” from Asher Ellis. Two army scounts, Briars and Weaver, save the proprietor of a travelling medicine show from an attack from Indians. In gratitude, he offers them an elixer that promises to extend life. Briars mocks the incredulous Weaver in taking it and for believing the salesman’s story. But, perhaps, Weaver has the last, terrible, wheezing laugh.\n\nAn outlaw, shot up after committing a bank robbery, and now horseless, loyally looks for the young man, the Kid, who he involved in the event to his regret. The main interest of Jay Scate’s “Jacob Lowe’s Return” is the surprsing revelation at the end as to how the outlaws’ vengeance and survival is accomplished.\n\nWe have been quite amenable to the works of Joel Jenkins in the past and his “In the Night Watches” did not disappoint. Its joys come less from the confrontation of bounty hunter Lone Crow, possessor of a magical revolver blessed by a prophet, battling a beast known as the behinder from its method of attack than the characters he aids and, in one case, give him valueable assistance. In his monster hunting, Lone Crow ponders matters of the heart and the moral issues surrounding them.\n\nGenerally, we found this anthology to possess little novelty or variety in its tales’ conceits and too often the premises presented have been shorn of drama, character, and that quality of transporting us to another time and place and the resulting engenderment of emotions. In short, these tales too seldom give us “atmosphere” and rely on the, too often, impuissant ability of mere surface detail to retain our attention. We were momentarily held by some of the tales, but very few will live on in our memories.\n\nHowever, while we shall regard this as, largely, a regrettable fall of standards for Mr. Riley, we shall not deny ourselves other examples of his editorial work.\n\nFinally, we wonder, given Mr. Riley’s frequent lamentation that he can find so few hands that will turn to the weird western, if the paucity of such artists reduced the quality of this book."
