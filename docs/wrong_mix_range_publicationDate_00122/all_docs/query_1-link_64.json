        "text": "Peril in Prague…\n\n😀 😀 😀 😀 🙂\n\nThe Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II, is fascinated by all things mystical, especially the fabled Philosopher’s Stone which it is said will give immortality to anyone who possesses it. He has filled his court in Prague with alchemists and mystics of all kinds, offering patronage to anyone he believes has the talent to make progress in his quest for the stone. At one time his favourite was John Dee, philosopher and mystic, late of Elizabeth’s court in England and one of Walsingham’s ring of spies, but recently John Dee’s position has slipped in favour of a younger man, a skilled alchemist called Zikmund Bartos. So when Bartos is found dead and horribly mutilated with cabalistic signs on his body, Dee falls under suspicion – it was known he resented the younger man’s rise. Walsingham asks Giordano Bruno to travel to Prague to aid Dee, but by the time Bruno arrives, Dee has disappeared…\n\nI loved the first couple of books in this series about the fictional adventures of the real-life Giordano Bruno, but gradually Parris gave more prominence to his love interest – one of these dreadful anachronistic “strong females” that contemporary authors seem to feel obliged to insert inappropriately into historical fiction, who live outside all the conventions and outsmart and outfight all the men. I found her so annoying I stopped reading the books. So when I was sent a copy of this one for review I had mixed feelings about it. However I’m delighted to say that apparently their love affair is over and she’s still in England while Bruno is wandering the courts and universities of Reformation-era Europe alone – hurrah!\n\nParris’ great skill is in creating her settings and here she brings Rudolf’s court to life. It’s refreshing to get away from the Tudors and see what was happening in the rest of Europe at the time while, by bringing Dee and Bruno into the story, and Walsingham from a distance, there are still the connections with the English history of that period in which most historical fiction fans are well versed. Knowing nothing about Rudolf’s court I have no way to judge the accuracy of the portrayal of him and of Prague, but based on Parris’ previous outings in Tudor history I’m happy to assume this will have been just as well researched and based on a sound factual footing. It certainly seems to be the case that both Dee and Bruno did go to Prague in real life.\n\nThe upheavals in religion are still plaguing Europe with the Church of Rome and its adherents trying to undermine those of the monarchs who have turned to Protestantism. Rudolf is flirting not only with the new religion but with the supernatural – heresy as far as Rome is concerned, and entirely unsuited to his role as Holy Roman Emperor. Dee and Bruno too have both fallen foul of Rome for different reasons, so Rudolf’s openness is a kind of protection to them and to many others who have been exiled from their home countries. There is also a large Jewish enclave inside Prague, and Rudolf is tolerant towards them – too tolerant, in the eyes of many. The Jews in turn know that their position is precarious – if anything happens to turn Rudolf against them they will be expelled from the city, and may face even harsher treatment than that. All of these factors play into the plot.\n\nI loved the setting and all this insight into the religious/political turmoils of the time. The plot itself, however, gets rather bogged down and occasionally lost among all the historical detail. Like so much contemporary fiction, the book could have easily lost a hundred pages and been the better for it – the central section required the exertion of willpower to pull myself through it. However the first and last thirds made up for this dip in the middle, and the solution when it eventually comes is a good mix of the personal and political and with enough thrills to raise the excitement level.\n\nThe characterisations are another of Parris’ strengths. Bruno is a likeable protagonist (even if I never can truly believe the real Giordano Bruno would have been anything like him) and in this one he has a young assistant, Besler, who is great fun – a young man brought up by strict Protestant parents sampling the delights of freedom for the first time. There’s a large cast of characters in Prague, most of whom are potential suspects and each of whom give us a look at some aspect of society, from the alchemists to the publicans to the religious leaders and the spies. And Rudolf himself is interestingly portrayed as a man who is highly superstitious, nervy, but also with a kind of determination not to be boxed in by the role he has inherited.\n\nOverall, this one reminded me of why I loved the early books in the series and I enjoyed it far more with Bruno back as a loner. The historical setting is interesting and refreshingly different, and although I felt the plot was a bit weak in places and stretched out over far too many chapters where nothing much happened, in the end it all comes together satisfyingly. So long as Bruno stays away from “that woman”, I’ll be happy to read more of his wanderings through Europe and the adventures he meets there.\n\nNB This book was provided for review by the publisher, HarperCollins."
