No one pretends that science fiction is in the forefront in trend-setting, but facts require no pretense—or defense. It is no longer uncommon to visit a bookstore with a large paperback section and to see as many as one hundred science-fiction titles on display. The majority of these titles are reprints from science-fiction mag­ azines and clothbound books, and they run the gamut of the range and history of the literature. But predominantly the books are those written by the “modern” science-fiction writers of the past few years. Science-fiction titles are a regular part of hard-cover book publishing. Significantly, an increasing number of “main­ stream” authors are discovering that it is an effective way of presenting certain themes, particularly social criticism. The realization has dawned that Aldous Huxley in Brave\n\n1\n\n2\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nNew World and George Orwell in 1984 had made no mis­ take in adopting a science-fiction framework any more than had Jonathan Swift in Gulliver’s Travels. Pierre Boulle, French author of The Bridge Over the River Kwai, tqnqtsqs the positions of man and apes on a distant planet around the star Betelgeuse to expose the weaknesses of man’s behavior in Planet of the Apes; William Burroughs, fresh from the sen­ sationalism of Naked Lunch, takes his lurid satirical obser­ vations into space in Nova Express; Anthony Burgess, ex­ hilarated by favorable response to A Clockwork Orange, moves into the future in The Wanting Seed to warn of the social impact of the population explosion. Should there be doubt that these writers adopt the genre because they read modern science fiction, Burgess gives evidence to the point when he attaches the names Heinlein and Asimov to char­ acters in his story. Among the “angry” talented young stars on the literary horizon, ample evidence is present of fascination with sci­ ence fiction. Kingsley Amis, highly regarded for such “comic” novels as Lucky Jim, gave a series of lectures on science fiction at Princeton University during 1958 and 1959 and collected and expanded these talks into New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction (Harcourt, Brace & World, 1960), concluding that “at least a dozen current practitioners seem to me to have attained the status of the sound minor writer whose example brings into existence the figure of real standing.” He has also edited a series of sci­ ence-fiction anthologies (with Robert Conquest) underscor­ ing his point. Colin Wilson, who caused a literary stir with The Outsider, displays high regard for science fiction. He very much likes the work of Robert A. Heinlein, of whom he states in his book The Strength to Dream (1962): “Among living writers of science fiction, he has the most consistently high quality and, together with Weinbaum, is the writer whose work most deserves to be considered as literature.” His most laudatory view of science fiction itself is expressed in the lines: “Again one becomes aware that\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nscience fiction seems to have escaped the general sense of defeat, the cult of ‘the little man’ that pervades so much modern writing.” s' One peculiarity of modern science fiction is that the same stories possess appeal for the teenage student and the literK ary intellectual. Of the former, the late Max Herzberg, nationally known educator and chairman of the Selection Com­ mittee of the Teen Age Book Club, writing in Scholastic Teacher for October 8, 1952, pointedly stated: “Teachers who continue to regard all science fiction as trash will do well to look into some of it and test their judgment against the claim of one devotee, for instance, that Robert Heinlein has done work comparable to that of John Erskine.” He then announced selections for the Teen Age Book Club by A. E. van Vogt and Edmond Hamilton as well as Heinlein, and recommended that, in addition, teachers sample Ray Bradbury, Murray Leinster, and Clark Ashton Smith. The influence of science fiction is widespread. The comic books, spearheaded by Superman, abound with its concepts. } The current vogue for monster magazines, inaugurated by James Warren and Forrest J. Ackerman’s famous monsters , of filmland, owes as much to the science-fiction magazines as it does to the motion pictures their contents reflect. Even a large number of children’s toys and games have evolved \\ from popular elements of the science-fiction story. The men and women who weave the fabric that forms the tapestry of modem science fiction should therefore be of more than casual interest to the thinking members of our society. The waves created by the notions they have dropped into the communal pool of world ideas have traveled to the four corners of the earth. Their influence may not be profound but it is slowly being recognized, even in the academic world, as undeniably significant. Term papers on science fiction are becoming increasingly numerous; a science-fiction library has been established in a temperature-controlled vault at Harvard College; a specialized space-fiction collection was begun at the university library in Syracuse, N. Y.; a credit\n\n4\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\ncourse in science fiction has been inaugurated at Colgate University under the direction of Mark Hillegas; a scholarly biannual, extrapolation: a science-fiction newsletter, is being published by the Department of English, The College of Wooster, edited by Thomas D. Clareson. Fundamentally, though, the academic world, like the literary world, possesses no more than the most superficial and elementary information concerning the authors who are the movers of today’s sci­ ence-fiction advance. This book is an effort to fill that void. Chronologically it follows the author’s Explorers of the Infinite: Shapers of Science Fiction (World, 1963), a synoptic history of science fiction to 1940. This volume is a webwork history of science fiction from then to 1965, told through the lives, works, and influences of more than a score of its most outstanding practitioners of the past twenty-five years. Each of the authors treated here was selected for his de­ monstrable contribution toward building the pattern of to­ day’s science fiction. It must be recognized that many of these men (and one woman) are still very much engaged in developing their careers. It is not possible, without historical hindsight, to wrap up an opinion about them with finality, yet their status as leaders can be justified by reference to their accomplishments to date. Two of the choices perhaps require brief explanation; they carried science fiction into new areas of mass enter­ tainment. Mort Weisinger was not selected for his contri­ butions as an author, but for his role in transferring the ideas of science fiction to the comic magazines, foremost of which is Superman, which he edits. Robert Bloch, while a skillful and highly original writer of science fiction, has been included to indicate the debt that the motion picture and television world owes to science fiction in its handling of suspense. The dominant status of the other authors in shaping the direction of modem science fiction can scarcely be chal­ lenged. Yet there is another group of writers whose contri­\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nbutions cannot be ignored. Those are the craftsmen who have written at least one major story so outstanding that it has already become a recognized science-fiction classic. Specific mention is made in the final chapter of this book of such notables. Brief reference is also made to authors who obviously rank high, but who are just entering the summer of their careers. This volume, therefore, while the most comprehensive dis­ sertation yet published on modern science fiction and the authors who create it, is essentially selective. With the ex­ ception of Ray Bradbury, on whose career several mono­ graphs have been published, the material in this book repre­ sents the most complete biographical and critical treatment the several authors discussed have ever received. For all but two, it is the only serious appraisal in depth yet at­ tempted. Fundamentally, all material in this book is the result of basic research. Since all but one of the authors were alive at the time of writing, biographical material was obtained, in a majority of the cases, directly from the individual by inter­ views and correspondence, and supplemented by material from relatives, friends, and other secondary sources. The entire published science-fiction output of every sci­ ence-fiction writer discussed in this book (the average career spans more than twenty-five years) was read, or rather re­ read. With very few exceptions, all the books, periodicals, letters, clippings, and other related material referred to in the text of this book are owned by the writer and on file in his library. As a prelude to writing this book, every sciencefiction magazine containing original material ever published in the English language was collected (as well as hundreds in foreign languages), and thousands of the key books, bul­ letins, newspaper clippings, and related items were assem­ bled. Quite literally, it took thirty years of reading and col­ lecting to make the writing of this book possible. In the earlier volume, Explorers of the Infinite, which covered the first three hundred years of the history of science\n\n6\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nfiction, each major figure more or less cleanly represented an era or facet of the field. The authors covered in this second volume wrote mainly in the twenty-five year period between 1940 and 1965. Their works, in many cases, ap­ peared contemporaneously. Therefore, this part of the his­ tory is a webwork, a reworking of the same period over and over again from the point of reference of each author, until the pattern of the era emerges. In the process, the roles of all the major editors, particu­ larly that of the tremendously influential John W. Campbell, Jr., are exposed in historical bas-relief. The part played by the science-fiction fan movement in shaping modem science fiction is acknowledged. The contributions of general fiction and specialized magazines to the development of the genre are revealed. The first part of the book is devoted to six “bridge” authors, men who helped lay the foundation for modem sci­ ence fiction and whose works spanned both the early and late periods of development. A second group, Eric Frank Russell, L. Sprague de Camp, and Lester del Rey, represent the precursors of the “mod­ ems,” pioneering techniques of storytelling. With one exception, Clifford D. Simak, the heavy guns of the movement did not get their start until 1939; exempli­ fying modern science fiction in its purest form are Robert A. Heinlein, A. E. van Vogt, Theodore Sturgeon, Isaac Asimov, Fritz Leiber, as well as Simak. A third group is characterized by the infusion of the fan­ tasy element, since C. L. Moore, Henry Kuttner, and Robert Bloch were nurtured by weird tales and later turned to science fiction. The final group includes three authors who developed in­ dependently of the main movement and achieved success on their own terms: Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, and Philip José Farmer. These twenty-one are the masters of modem science fic­ tion. They represent just one step in the history of science\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nfiction, but a major one. What form science fiction may take in the future has not yet crystallized. Perhaps its interna­ tionalization will see the rise of major writers in many na­ tions. Predicting that trend, on the basis of present evidence, falls more in the province of science fiction itself than in literary surmise. It is a particular source of satisfaction to the author that the definition of science fiction given in Explorers of the Infinite is beginning to gain circulation and acceptance. Gratifying were statements by reviewers such as August W. Derleth in the (Madison, Wisconsin) capital times, June, 27, 1963, who said it was “perhaps the most satisfactory definition ever set down on paper.” The definition is re­ peated here: Science fiction is a branch of fantasy identifiable by the fact / that it eases the “willing suspension of disbelief” on the part of its readers by utilizing an atmosphere of scientific credibility ' for its imaginative speculations in physical science, space, time, social science, and philosophy.\n\nA note of appreciation is due Norman Lobsenz and Cele Lalli, editors of amazing stories, who published as special features much of the material that appears in this book. A real affection is expressed for Jerome Fried, who conceived this history as a two-volume project and took a personal interest in seeing that it was considered. Most especially, recognition must be given to Wallace Exman, who saw the potentials of this volume within the context of the new di­ rection The World Publishing Company was taking, and carried it through. SAM MOSKOWITZ Newark, N. J. June, 1965\n\n1\n\nEDWARD E. SMITH, Ph.D\n\nX\\e hypothesis of an expanding universe was first for­\n\nmulated in 1912, when Vesto Melvin Slipher applied what is today known as the Doppler-Fizeau effect to the Andro­ meda nebula, establishing that it was one of only a few not receding into space. Despite this, the imagination of the science-fiction world stagnated within the confines of our solar .system until 1928, when Edward E. Smith’s The Sky­ lark of Space lifted mental horizons to the inspiring wonder of the galaxy. Why the awakening had to await the coming of Smith is difficult to say. It should have occurred when Camille Flam­ marion, the famed French astronomer and author, popular­ ized the theories of worlds around other stars in the nine­ teenth century. It seemed to have arrived in 1904 when Jean Delaire’s heroes outraced light on their way to the far places in Around a Distant Star (John Zony, London), or 9\n\n10\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nwhen, the following year, the Rev.. W. S. Harris merchan­ dised Life in a Thousand Worlds (G. Holzapfel, Cleona, Pennsylvania) into a best-seller by subscription. It is possible that because Delaire and Harris were pri­ marily intent upon expounding religious ideas their spotlight on the devil blinded men to a new approach to reverence. When The Skylark of Space, which began as a three-part serial in the August, 1928, amazing stories, reached its final installment, publisher Hugo Gernsback said: “. . . We are certain you will agree with us that it is one of the out­ standing scientifiction stories of the decade; an interplanetarian story that will not be eclipsed soon. It will be referred to by all scientifiction fans for years to come. It will be read and reread.” Eighteen-year-old John W. Campbell, Jr., on summer vacation preparatory to entering Massachusetts Institute of Technology, would haunt the newsstands relentlessly, im­ patient at the wait between installments. Because of the im­ pact that story would have on him and others like him, science fiction would never again be the same. What were the elements that have caused writers as well as readers to cherish The Skylark of Space as the seedling of cosmic literature destined to burgeon limitlessly in awesome concepts? It was not that it stood alone. That same month of August, Edmond Hamilton began a two-part novel on an extra-solar-system scale, Crashing Suns, in weird tales. Earlier that year, invasion and counterinvasion had criss­ crossed the vastness between earth and the system of Sirius in J. Slchossel’s The Second Swarm (amazing stories quarterly, Spring, 1928). Perhaps it was the description of an atomic explosion perilously close to prophecy. More likely it was the suspense­ ful presentation of scientific dilemmas solved by miracle men with bus bars and test tubes. Unquestionably, the mar­ vel of distances and places which strained comprehension, unrolled in an enthralling odyssey, contributed. Certainly it could not have been the plot line, involving\n\nEdward E. Smith, Ph.D\n\n11\n\ncloak-and-dagger manipulations for scientific secrets or the “corny” kidnapping of Dorothy Vaneman, the betrothed of the almost superhuman scientist Richard Seaton, by the vil­ lainous Dr. Marc “Blackie” DuQuesne. Surely the stilted love scenes and the use of ephemeral slang in the dialogue detracted more than they added. Yet, despite the superficial Victorianisms of the plot, most likely it was the combination of these very elements with the superscience concepts that gave The Skylark of Space titanic stature in science fiction’s hall of fame. The events described were happening to people, some of them stereo­ types, others superhuman; but what happened in the novel was more than an attempt at prediction, it was a story. Characters reacted to mind-staggering situations. Not all the characters were cardboard. No more remark­ able villain has been depicted in the annals of science fic­ tion than DuQuesne. He steals the show. Physically power­ ful, mentally a genius, distinctly amoral, he is the ultimate pragmatist: murder without compunction for an end, but do not lift a finger for mere sadistic satisfaction nor permit a promise of pleasure to distract you from your purpose. Despite the fact that Smith had a Ph.D. after his name and his character Seaton was prone to semitechnical mono­ logues with jarring frequency, such hard-to-accept notions as speed many times that of light and the manipulation of matter by the power of the mind were strongly challenged in the “Discussion” department of subsequent issues of amazing stories. These criticisms failed to alter the fact that apotheosis to the Olympus of science fiction was im­ mediately in prospect for the author. This soon-to-be saint of the starways, the second youngest of five children, was born to Fred J. Smith, an ex-whaler working at shipping on the Great Lakes, and Caroline Mills Smith on May 2, 1890, in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Both parents were of British extraction and staunch Presbyterians. They christened the boy Edward Elmer, and the same year moved to Spokane, Washington, where the father became a\n\n12\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\ncontractor in carpentry and cabinet work. A poor business­ man, after many lean times he settled on a homestead of 160 acres on the Pend d’Oreille River in northern Idaho, raising baking potatoes for the dining cars of The Great Northern Railroad. The youthful E. E. Smith logged in the winter, swamped brush, felled trees, worked in sawmills, did stretches as a lumberjack, and floated lumber down the river. His grammer school education was in the Spokane schools and he began high school at Priest River, five miles from home, where he was regarded as an outsider by the other children and had to pulverize every other boy in the school pugilistically to achieve minimal toleration, let alone friendship. There might have been no education beyond that had the father been less of an emotional disciplinarian. The break came at the age of 18 in a near-violent disagreement over the fine points of fertilizing a potato field with a load of manure. Young E. E. stormed off to Spokane for a brief stint as a conductor on a horse-drawn streetcar. There had been great closeness and affection between E. E., his two brothers, and his two sisters. His older broth­ er, Daniel, soon teamed up with him to haul asphalt for a street-paving job. The profits from this enterprise, together with contributions from his older sister Rachel, were used to send him to prep school at the University of Idaho. After the first year, he decided he wanted to be a civil engineer. At the age of 19, he helped run a railroad line north from Belton, Montana, into Canada, but seven months of life in the wilderness changed his mind about civil engi­ neering. He went to work in a mine to get enough money to re-enter school. One night he awoke in his room on the fourth floor of a boarding house to find that his bed was afire. In a single convulsive leap he was out through the window, sash ancf all. He broke five ribs and a leg, but the worst damage was to his wrist, which couldn’t be used for a year and hurt for ten years more. Manual labor was now out of the question and home he came.\n\nEdward E. Smith, Ph.D\n\n13\n\nThe resourceful brother, Daniel, soon afterward emerged from a Saturday-night-to-Monday-moming poker game with the pot, $310.50 in winnings. “You,” he said, gesturing at E. E., “with your gimpy wing can’t earn much. Take this money and go back to college.” Not only sister Rachel, but sister Mary Elizabeth, as well, sent money to help him through. Their confidence was justified. Majoring in chemical en­ gineering, he secured a junior year scholarship for the high­ est scholastic rating. The schedule called for 160 credits to graduate and he got “A” in all 160 credits. Before gradua­ tion, he had taken a civil service examination for junior chemist in Washington, D.C., and had been offered the position. He had no money, so Daniel, who was now work­ ing as a railroad clerk, collected $150 in five minutes from his fellow employees for the fare. There was one piece of unfinished business to take care of before he left. During his senior year, roommate Allan MacDougall had shown him pictures of a sister, Jeanne Craig MacDougall, back in Boise, Idaho. Bowled over, E. E. started a correspondence with her. He went to Washington, D.C., via Boise, where he met Jeanne for the first time. He discovered that a contributing reason for the superlative photos of her was that Jeanne worked as a photographer’s model. They were engaged within 10 minutes of their meeting. Working for the U.S. Bureau of Standards in Washing­ ton, D.C., Smith helped establish tolerances on the weight of commercially sold butter. He established standards for oysters in New England in a laboratory on the prow of a ship at the price of perpetual seasickness. By the fall of 1915 he had saved enough money to marry and bring his wife to Washington, D.C. It appeared, though, that his ambition of obtaining a doctorate would have to be sacrificed to the responsibility of supporting a family. But Jeanne went to work as a stenographer to help out, and in 1919 he got his Ph.D. from George Washington University.\n\n14\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nSmith’s writing career started at a men’s smoker in 1915. It was a hot, humid night and a discussion ensued with a former classmate of his, Carl D. Garby, Ph.D., who now lived across the hall from him, on what the temperature was in outer space. Others present contributed their ideas on the subject. That night, Carl told his wife, Lee Hawkins Garby, about the conversation. She thought the idea was intriguing and urged Smith to write a story based on it. He was dubious bacause he felt a story had to have love interest and he doubted his ability to handle that part of the plot. She suggested a collaboration in which Smith handled the science and action and the love element could be left to her. It wasn’t necessary to twist Smith’s arm too hard to get him to agree. A regular reader of argosy, he was partic­ ularly fond of that magazine’s science fiction. In book form, he cherished everything published of H. G. Wells, Jules Verne, H. Rider Haggard, Edgar Allan Poe, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Beyond that, his reading enthusiasms included poetry, philosophy, ancient and medieval history, and all of English literature. The two worked at the novel industriously through 1915 and 1916, finishing about one-third of it. Then interest waned, and the work was put aside. At the end of the war Smith became chief chemist for F. W. Stock & Sons, Hillsdale, Michigan, a position he was to occupy until 1936. His specialty was the infant field of doughnut mixes, the formulation of which is regarded as a specialized art by cereal chemists. One evening late in 1919, bored with baby sitting while Jeanne was out to a movie, he took up the unfinished novel and continued where it had been left off. He kept Garby informed about his progress, but wrote the remainder of the story himself, including the love interest. In the spring of 1920, the completed story began to make the rounds of the publishers. The consistency of rejections was ego-shattering. The\n\nEdward E. Smith, Ph.D\n\n15\n\nonly encouragement he received in eight years of submis­ sions was a three-page letter from Bob Davis, editor of argosy, in 1922. Davis liked the story immensely, but felt it was just too “far out” to be accepted by his readership. “Every” book publisher in the country had a look at the manuscript and turned it down. Whenever a new magazine appeared, Smith hopefully sent it out. Finally, one day he picked up the April, 1927, amazing stories at a newsstand, read a few pages on the spot of the first story, The Plague of the Living Dead, by A. Hyatt Verrill, dashed home, got the manuscript, and mailed it out. Editor T. O’Conor Sloane replied with high enthusiasm and a low offer of $75 for the 90,000-word novel. Smith accepted (though he had spent more than that on postage through the years), but by the time the novel appeared, amazing stories had examined its conscience and a check arrived for $125. He split the sum with Mrs. Garby and The Skylark of Space was published as a collaboration. The first installment had not been on sale a month when Sloane wrote asking for a sequel. Mrs. Garby wasn’t inter­ ested in participating further, so Smith started on his own. The sequel, Skylark Three, was in every sense a continuation of the first novel. As science fiction it was also a better novel. The story was unified and the pace sustained. Most important, Smith showed that, whatever his weaknesses at dialogue and love interest his ability to develop suspenseful action grippingly on a cosmic scale was limited only by the scope of his imagination. He was probably the only writer alive who could weave a thousand words of scientific ex­ planation into a battle scene and not slow the pace for an instant. Skylark Three, upon its appearance in the August, Sep­ tember, and October, 1930, issues of amazing stories, did more than even its predecessor to change the paraphernalia of science fiction. Tremendous battles of conflicting forces with an assortment of offensive rays and defensive force screens were popularized by the new novel. Spaceships miles\n\n16\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nin length and a fabulous array of bizarre aliens which justi­ fied the novel’s subtitle: “The tale of the galactic cruise which ushered in universal civilization,” became standard science-fiction fare. Science-fiction writers would never again be bound to their solar system. Smith had sold all rights to The Skylark of Space but he released only magazine privileges for its sequel, amazing stories voluntarily paid him % of a cent a word for that second story, 'A of a cent more per word than they had paid any author up to that time. The Skylark stories had been carried as far as Smith planned, and he now proceeded on what he thought would be a new series. The Spacehounds of IPC began in the July, 1931, issue of amazing stories, before the letter column had ceased ringing the praises of Skylark Three. It was an ex­ citing, imaginative story depicting space battles, stupendous scientific discovery, and ingeniously conceived alien intel­ ligences, every bit as good and as well-sustained as Skylark Three. It even predicted the ion drive for space ships dec­ ades before Herman Oberth proposed it in radio elec­ tronics magazine in the early fifties. Nevertheless, letters tempered praise with protest because Smith had stayed with­ in the confines of our solar system in the development of the story. Editor Sloane sided with the readers and made a point of suggesting that Smith make the setting of his next story far out in the Milky Way. Smith was angered at Sloane, not only for the reprimand but for unauthorized changes in the published story, so when Harry Bates, editor of Clayton’s astounding stories, dangled the carrot of 2 cents a word on acceptance for first look at his next story, he agreed. A sequel to The Spacehounds of IPC was now impossible, since the new story must be offered to a competing magazine. Instead, Smith wrote Triplanetary, a novel of the unified worlds of Earth, Mars, and Venus attacked by an amphibian menace from a distant star. Though much of the action appeared to ad­ vance the plot but little, Smith’s writing had improved over\n\nEdward E. Smith, Ph.D\n\n17\n\neven The Spacehounds oj I PC and he had once again ven­ tured out into the far places, so the story was great fun. Scientifically, it introduced the notion of the “inertialess” drive to attain speeds faster than light, which while not provable, cannot be disproved and therefore is considered the best device over proposed to conquer the light-speed limit. The problem here turned out to be with the market. By the time Smith submitted Triplanetary to astounding stories, that magazine had become a bimonthly and was paying on publication instead of acceptance. An announce­ ment that the story was forthcoming appeared in their Jan­ uary, 1933, issue, and the cover illustration of the March, 1933, number (the last under the Clayton chain’s owner­ ship) was taken from a situation in Triplanetary. But the company was being disbanded so the manuscript was re­ turned to Smith. Still not talking to amazing stories, he decided to give wonder stories a look at Triplanetary. To his humiliation, he not only received a rejection, but the editor, Charles D. Hornig, later bragged about it in an article titled Stories We Reject—in the science fiction fan magazine fantasy maga­ zine (December, 1934-January 1935). Now there was no alternative but to submit Triplanetary to amazing, by whom it was accepted and published in four parts beginning with the January, 1934, number; but Smith’s rates were ignominiously dropped to a half-cent a word. Further to embitter his cup of hemlock, shortly after the sale to amazing, Smith received a letter from F. Orlin Tre­ maine, new editor of astounding stories, which had been bought and revived by Street & Smith Publications in the interim, offering a cent a word for Triplanetary. When Tre­ maine learned that it was already scheduled for amazing stories, he suggested a third story in the Skylark series. All winter of 1933-34, Smith worked away on The Skylark oj Valeron. With each succeeding chapter, the concepts grew increasingly grandiose. In over his head, the story out of\n\n18\n\nSeekers Of tomorrow\n\nhis control, Smith collected his first draft, typed on an as­ sorted mass of pink, blue, and white sheets of paper, and sent it to Tremaine with a distraught note explaining that he couldn’t handle the theme and would welcome any sug­ gestions. Tremaine wrote to say that he had only one suggestion: that Smith cash the enclosed check for $850. What happened then makes one of the most remarkable chapters in the history of science-fiction magazine publish­ ing. Tremaine, a crack editorial hand, veteran of top posts at smart set, true story, and the Clayton pulp chain, had been building a dramatic and exciting new team of authors. The Smith name was just what he needed. The fullpage editorial in the June, 1934, astounding stories was titled “The Skylark.” “For six long years, readers of science fiction have talked about the ‘Skylark’ stories,” it began. “They have been called the greatest science fiction ever written. There were two, you remember, both pointing to­ ward a culminating story which never appeared. ... The Skylark of Valeron starts in the August issue of astounding stories!” Not only did the editorial cover a full page, but there was another thiee-quarter-page announcement of the virtues of The Skylark of Valeron in the same issue. The following month, he announced that a new type style would increase wordage by 25,000 so readers would get the “Skylark” in addition to everything else. He exhorted each reader to in­ troduce one new friend to astounding. “We have kept faith with you,” he told the readers, “now you keep faith with us.” They did. The circulation of astounding stories leaped 10,000 with the first installment of The Skylark of Valeron (which ran in no less than seven parts) and the magazine showed a profit for the first time in its history. Before the novel was finished, both competitors, amazing and wonder, were financially on the ropes. Within a year, the two of them were skipping issues. Eventually they had to sell out. As much as he accomplished for himself, Tremaine ac­\n\nEdward E. Smith, Ph.D\n\n19\n\ncomplished even more for Smith. Great as had been Smith’s reputation after Skylark Three, it was incomparably greater now. But Smith was unable to take immediate advantage of the situation. Personal problems interfered with his writing. Though he was one of the few doughnut mix specialists in America (running a $5,000,000 annual doughnut mix busi­ ness) he found after years of effort there was a low ceiling on his salary. He shifted to Dawn Doughnut, Jackson, Michigan, in January, 1936, on a salary plus share-of-theprofit arrangement. To get his new firm out of the red, he worked 18 hours a day, seven days a week, for almost a year, even designing new machinery to implement his plans. Once the company was over the hump, he sat down and wrote an 80-page outline for a 400,000-word novel divided into four segments: Galactic Patrol, The Grey Lensman, Second Stage Lensman, and Children of the Lens. He actual­ ly wrote the last chapter of Children of the Lens after com­ pleting the rough draft of Galactic Patrol. This outline was submitted to Tremaine, who told him to go ahead; he would buy the entire package. Galactic Patrol (astounding stories, September, 1937, to February, 1938) shares with Olaf Stapledon’s The Star Maker (published earlier in 1937) the distinction of popu­ larizing the “community of worlds” or galactic empire backdrop in science fiction. Edmond Hamilton had presented the idea eight years earlier, but Smith and Stapledon appear to have brought its potentialities into focus. The Galactic Patrol is an interstellar police force organ­ ized to combat the piracy and lawlessness threatening the structure of galactic civilization. Behind the scenes, dimly seen, are prime movers. The Arisians, whose spores, pro­ jected through the galaxy, caused life to form in their image on many worlds, manipulate events for good. The Eddorians, creatures from another space continuum, in their lust for power are the cause of most ills. Good and evil are sharply defined and the battle is joined.\n\n20\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nWhile the allegory seems obvious, the device of the prime mover shows up in a slightly more sophisticated form in a number of A. E. van Vogt’s novels, including Sian, The Weapon Shops, and World of A. The idea of a prime mover is implied in references to a Second Foundation in Isaac Asimov’s stories. These are but two of many authors who demonstrate that Smith has been influential on several levels, shaping not only the background but the plot structure of modern science fiction. Kimball Kinnison is the hero of the novels that would become known as the “Lensman” series. The lensmen are a group of men and women from many worlds, trained to mental and physical attainment so high as to mark them as the beginning of a superior race. Ultimately, through selec­ tive mating, they will achieve a point of development where they can replace the Arisians as guardians of the galaxy. The lens itself is a communication device worn on the wrist of a lensman, so attuned to the personality of the wearer that it is virtually artificially alive. If worn by anyone but its owner it proves deadly. The Grey Lensman is probably best of the series, with Galactic Patrol running it a close second. When Fantasy Press decided to publish all of Smith’s works in hard covers, he rewrote Triplanetary, adding six chapters in the process, to make it part of the series. Several of the new chapters, each of which is a complete story in itself, are quite as good as anything Smith ever did, but the interpolation of Arisian and Eddorian influences into the body of the original Tri­ planetary removes much of the zest from the work. Writing Triplanetary into the series made necessary a bridge novel, The First Lensman, to link it with Galactic Patrol. The First Lensman was published in hardcover by Fantasy Press in 1950, never appearing in magazine form. It deals vividly with the events that required the organiza­ tion of a Galactic Patrol and the training experiences of the first lensman. It was partially because serialization of The Grey Lens-\n\nEdward E. Smith, Ph.D\n\n21\n\nman in astounding science-fiction began in October, 1939, that Edward E. Smith, was invited to be guest of honor at the Second World Science Fiction Convention, held in Chicago September 1 and 2, 1940. Few of his au­ dience listening to him deliver a speech on “What Does This Convention Mean?’’ in the style of the most active and rabid science-fiction fan, realized that Smith was in trouble. Be­ cause of the war, any company selling products containing sugar and flour needed no formulation specialist, least of all one who received a percentage of the profits. Smith found himself out of a job. He tried to do some writing, but couldn’t seem to concentrate. Meanwhile, he lived on his savings. Then suddenly there was a special appeal. F. Orlin Tre­ maine, who had left Street & Smith in 1938, was back editing a new science-fiction magazine titled comet. There were nearly a dozen competitors, most of them better fi­ nanced. He was finding the going rough. Could Smith help him? Smith readily agreed to do a series of novelettes construc­ ted around the character Neal Cloud, a professional blaster of atomic vortices from power plants out of control, an ex­ trapolation of the business of dynamiting blazing oil wells. The Vortex Blaster, first of the series, proved too little too late. It appeared in the July, 1941, issue of comet, the magazine’s last. Circumstances would not collaborate in a repeat performance of the previous Tremaine-Smith success. Politically, Smith’s move had been ill-advised, astound­ ing science-fiction was the leading market and John W. Campbell, Jr., its editor, was not happy about Smith’s move, particularly since Tremaine was reportedly aiming to re­ place astounding in its position of leadership among science-fiction magazines. Campbell began to pay more at­ tention to building up strong newcomers; the old-timers would have to take their chances. Two other stories in “The Vortex Blaster” series, Storm Cloud on Deka and The Vortex Blaster Makes War ap­\n\n22\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\npeared in astonishing stories in 1942. In 1960, the first three stories together with additional new material were combined into a book called The Vortex Blasters. Two sep­ arate editions, one by Fantasy Press and one by Gnome Press, were published, but after a promising title story, the whole proved undistinguished. Unable to find work immediately after Pearl Harbor, Smith applied to the army. At 51, he was overage, but they put him to work at the Kingsbury, Indiana, Ordnance Plant, working on explosives and shells. He was fired in 1944 for his refusal to pass shells he regarded as below standard. This phase of his life is described in complete detail in Chap­ ter 5, “1941,” of the book version of Triplanetary. He fin­ ished out the last year of the war as a metallurgist for AllisChalmers. In 1945, he reentered the doughnut mix business with J. W. Allen, Chicago, remaining there until his retirement in 1957. Settled in his new job at the end of World War II, Smith began work on the final novel in his series, The Chil­ dren of the Lens. It was a scarcely camouflaged secret that traits of Smith’s own three children, Roderick, Verna Jean, and Clarissa, would appear in the physical and mental char­ acteristics of the novel’s protagonists. But, in truth, “Doc” Smith was a father image to thousands of the science-fiction readers and he regarded them with a benign paternalism that implied he regarded them all as his “children.” Therefore, when the son of a well-to-do Boston family, Thomas P. Hadley, decided to take a flyer at book publish­ ing and asked for The Skylark of Space, it is doubtful if Smith even bothered to ask for terms. Hadley knew nothing about book publishing or marketing, but he managed to get a seven-line notice of the book with the correct price and full address on the bottom of page 110 of the August, 1946, astounding science-fiction. A limited edition of 1,000 copies at $3 each sold out completely by mail order from that single mention! Inundated with orders, Hadley didn’t even begin to know\n\nEdward E. Smith, Ph.D\n\n23\n\nhow to go about handling them. In desperation he appealed to Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, a former science-fiction author who had some familiarity with publishing procedures. Esh­ bach bailed him out and the book went into an elaborate illustrated second printing which cost almost as much per copy to print as it sold for. Years later the book would see still a third printing under the auspices of F. F. F. Publish­ ers, Brooklyn, but in the meantime Eshbach threw up his hands at Hadley’s economics and withdrew. Borrowing Hadley’s list of The Skylark of Space pur­ chasers, he formed his own publishing company, Fantasy Press, leading off with Smith’s The Spacehounds of IPC and eventually printing all ten remaining novels Smith had then written, among other titles. So popular were the Smith books that at one point Fantasy Press took the six volumes in the Lensman series, titled them The History of Civiliza­ tion, bound them uniformly in half morocco, boxed them, and sold the set for $30. The spate of book publishing firms specializing exclu­ sively in fantasy that sprang up after World War II may be attributed in no small measure to the success of the Smith titles. Scores of pulp-magazine classics were immortalized in hard covers under the imprint of such firms as Shasta Publishers, The Fantasy Publishing Co., Inc., Gnome Press, The Avalon Co., and New Era Publishers, in addition to Arkham House, which had been established by August Derleth before the war. Most of them perished when the big trade publishers began to schedule science fiction seriously in the early 1950’s. The excitement accompanying revision of novels for book publication, plus the implied prestige of hard covers, distracted Smith’s attention from the fact that Children of the Lens, which began in the November, 1947, astounding science fiction, was being presented with something less than the customary fanfare. It was the first Smith novel that rated less than two covers in that magazine. The ad­ vance notice was a masterpiece of casualness: “The No­\n\n24\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nvember cover will be a Rogers cover—he’s working on it now. It’s for . . . something called . . . uhumm . . . oh, yes! ‘Children of the Lens’ by an author we haven’t heard from since he stopped making edible powders for dough­ nuts and started making the more active kind about De­ cember, 1941. “Doc Smith is back.” The novel failed to have any special impact. It didn’t matter. Smith was too busy working on his books to notice and remained so for the next ten years revising his novels for book publication. When Fantasy Press, virtually with its dying gasp, passed on The Vortex Blaster like a literary baton to be distributed under the Gnome imprint, all of Smith’s magazine serials but one, The Galaxy Primes, had found their way between boards. While Smith’s books, the past ten years, had sold comfort­ ingly well, they had been reviewed with a great deal of con­ descension as period pieces. This bothered Smith, who now was determined to prove that he could emulate the current vogue. Campbell at astounding science fiction was then partial to stories with a strong element of what he termed psi phenomena: stories of teleportation, telekinesis, tele­ pathy, levitation, and extrasensory perception. Smith built The Galaxy Primes around those elements with a dash of naughtiness and considerable “way out” dialogue to prove he was no back number. It didn’t set well with Campbell, who rejected it, but it was serialized in three installments beginning in the March, 1959, amazing stories. Smith set­ tled back for the reaction. It proved considerably less than enthusiastic. Popularity frequently carries obligations. A fan named E. Everett Evans had been among Smith’s most ardent boosters. In his fifties, Evans determined to become a writer and succeeded. Among his published works were two very Smithlike novels aimed at teenagers, Man of Many Minds (1953) and Alien Minds (1955), both published by Fan­ tasy Press. Evans died of a heart condition with the first\n\nEdward E. Smith, Ph.D\n\n25\n\ndraft of another novel, Masters of Space, on his desk. To help Evans’ widow sell it, Smith did a complete revision and polishing job and the story ran as a collaboration in if (No­ vember, 1961-January, 1962). Dealing with the pooling of minds telepathically as a means of invading and destroy­ ing a planet, the story failed to come off. Smith then experimented with a detective novel, but it interested no one. A rapprochement with Campbell resulted in the plotting of a new novel, for which Subspace Survivor, a novelette ap­ pearing in the July, 1960, astounding science fiction was a prelude. The major story and sequel, Subspace Ex­ plorers, was another attempt on the part of Smith to write what he felt was wanted in modern science-fiction. Campbell didn’t agree with him in the result and the effort was eventu­ ally published as an original book by Canaveral Press, publishers of Edgar Rice Burroughs hard-cover editions (1965). It was time for Smith to review. Here he was 73, retired and living in a trailer in Florida. What was he trying to prove? The Skylark of Space in 1928 had given the science-fiction world the stars. Galactic Patrol in 1937 had unified those stars into a community. Each time he had dared to be himself and the result had altered the direction of a literature. What he had been doing the past few years was attempt­ ing to conform to a literary vogue instituted by someone else, in the process imitating writing methods popularized by someone else, rewriting a story conceived by someone else, and patterning a plot to suit someone else. At the 21st World Science Fiction Convention in Wash­ ington, D.C. (birthplace of The Skylark of Space nearly a half-century earlier), September 1, 1963, First Fandom pre­ sented its Hall-of-Fame Award to Edward E. Smith for his pivotal contributions to science fiction. From the floor, John\n\n26\n\nSeekers of .Tomorrow\n\nW. Campbell honored him with the statement: “Smith made the last big breakthrough in science fiction; we’re still wait­ ing for someone else to make another.” Almost too over­ come with emotion to speak, Smith, whose eyes were al­ most blinded by cataracts, accepted the award. Inevitably, someone asked the question: “What’s your next story, Doc?” Smith’s hand trembled slightly, but the answer was sharp and clear. “The title of my next story,” he said, “is Skylark DuQuesne!” August 31, 1965, Edward E. Smith died of a heart attack. Two weeks earlier, the October, 1965 if had appeared, completing serialization of Skylark Duquesne begun in its July issue. In it Blackie Duquesne proposes marriage and finds a soul mate. It was as though Skylark Duquesne was his last literary will and testament. E. E. Smith had finally done right by the no­ blest villain of them all.\n\n2 JOHN W. CAMPBELL\n\nAnd NOW CAMPBELL!” That was the title, set in thick 36-point type, of an editorial in the October, 1934, ASTOUNDING STORIES.\n\nIn December we bring you a great booklength novel by an author you have asked us to get for Astounding Stories. John W. Campbell, Jr., comes to us with a story of vast con­ ceptions, The Mightiest Machine. ... He has been called one of the two greatest science fiction authors. We have obtained stories from both (E.E.) Smith and Campbell. . . . Don’t miss this story. It’s Campbell at his best. Diametrically opposed to Smith’s theories but a worthy opponent.\n\nThe editorial voice behind the “pitch” was that of F. Orlin Tremaine. Procuring Campbell for his magazine was almost like driving the last nail in the coffins of his com­ petitors. One year earlier astounding stories had been re­ vived by Street & Smith as the third science-fiction monthly\n\n27\n\n28\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nin a field of three. Now it was the unquestioned leader in quality and circulation. Campbell was a true giant in popularity among those authors who had grown out of the science-fiction magazines. The Mightiest Machine, which began in the December, 1934, astounding stories and ran for five issues, epitomized the type of story that had created his following. Mighty space­ ships move at speeds faster than light from star system to star system, warping themselves through another dimension at the whim of Aam Munro, a mental and physical super­ man, descendant of earthmen raised on the surface of the planet Jupiter. He custom-contrives universe-shaking energy weapons to combat alien fleets in uni verse-wide battles. Like Edward E. Smith, Campbell was undeniably a literary Houdini in the mind-staggering art, convincingly manipulating stupendous forces on a cosmic scale. Time was running out on macrocosmic spectaculars like The Mightiest Machine; changes were occurring in plotting and writing science fiction that were to make the story a period piece before it was completed; yet its impact was so profound on a youthful Englishman, Arthur C. Clarke, that nearly twenty years later he would use a race similar to the devillike villains, the Teff-hellani, in his greatest critical success, Childhood’s End. At the other literary extreme, Richard S. Shaver (or Raymond A. Palmer, who actually wrote most of the stories carrying the Shaver name) would adapt Campbell’s premise that this evil race once lived in vast caverns under Mu and was driven away in a prehistoric Ragnorok, as the basis of the Shaver “Mystery.” Notwithstanding, Campbell’s major contribution in both storytelling and influence was yet to come. More than is true of most writers, his early life and background shaped the direction he would take in specific plot ideas as well as in method. John Wood Campbell, Jr., was bom in a two-family frame house at 16 Tracey Ave., Newark, New Jersey, on June 8, 1910. The street bordered the then fashionable\n\nJohn W- Campbell\n\n29\n\nClinton Hill section. His father, John W. Campbell, Sr., an electrical engineer, had come to Newark one year earlier. Having secured a position with New Jersey Bell Telephone, whose headquarters were in Newark, the elder Campbell returned to Napoleon, Ohio, to marry Dorothy Strahem, whose family tree made her eligible for the Daughters of the American Revolution. He took his wife back to Newark, a break in family tradi­ tion, since the Campbells were influential society in Napo­ leon. They had come to Napoleon from Rochester, Ver­ mont, where members of the family had been in the state legislature. Campbell’s father had been a Congressman for that district, a Master in Chancery, and a Judge of Equity. After seven years in Newark, the family moved to Maple­ wood, a suburb of Newark, where John, Jr., attended public school. Precociously intellectual, interested in everything around him, young John had virtually no friends. At home, his relationship with his parents was emotionally difficult. His father carried impersonality and theoretical objectivity in family matters to the brink of fetish. He almost never used the pronoun “I.” All statements were in the third per­ son: “It is necessary,” “One must,” “It appears that,” “One should.” Not only was he an authoritarian in his own home but a self-righteous disciplinarian as well, who put obedience high on the list of filial duties. Affection was not in his make­ up, and if he felt any for the boy he managed to repress it. The mother’s changeability baffled and frustrated the youngster. Self-centered, flighty, moody, she was unpredict­ able from moment to moment. While she was not deliber­ ately cruel, her gestures of warmth appeared to him so transitory and contrived as to be quickly discounted. His mother had a twin sister who was literally identical. So close were they in appearance that no one, let alone John, could tell them apart. The sisters were in psychological conflict because John’s mother had married first, and he found him­ self used as an innocent pawn by his mother who fawned over him at great length as a subtle taunt to her twin.\n\n30\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nThe result was that John’s aunt treated him with such abruptness that he was convinced she thoroughly hated him. This created a bizarre situation. The boy would come run­ ning into the house to impart something breathlessly to a woman he thought was his mother. He would be jarred by a curt rebuff from her twin. Every time his aunt visited the home, this situation posed itself until it became a continu­ ing and insoluble nightmare. Was the woman standing in front of him friend or “foe?” His only “friend” was a sister, Laura, born in 1917. The two got along well, but the seven-year gap in their ages made her always too young to be much of an ally. So loneli­ ness directed his alert and curious mind into everything. He blew up the basement with his chemistry experiments. Man­ ually dexterous, he repaired bicycles for other kids. For their parents he revitalized electrical appliances. He read omnivorously, particularly myths, legends, folklore, and an­ thropology. He discovered Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan and John Carter of Mars at the age of 1V2. At 8 he was perusing Jeans, Eddington, and astronomy texts. At 14 he was packed off to Blair Academy, an exclusive boys’ school in Blairstown, New Jersey. He succeeded in making only a few friends there, none of them instructors, whose “errors” he corrected in class. Sports did not attract him, though he developed a good game of tennis and a mild interest in intramural football. Despite four years at Blair, he never obtained a diploma. He was strong in physics and Spanish, but his marks ran the gamut in other subjects. One of the few times he and his father saw eye to eye was when the latter suggested that he be enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1928. Perhaps his reasonableness in this was partly motivated by John’s in­ genuity. At 15, in order to circumvent directives, he had become so facile in the use of logic that the father found himself hard-pressed to justify himself, his ideas, or his behavior.\n\nJohn W. Campbell\n\n31\n\nIn still another respect, a disciplinary pecularity of his father had a direct bearing in sharpening his embryonic writ­ ing skills. The older Campbell frequently checked the boy’s homework, and if he didn’t approve of a phrase he would demand it be rewritten. To save revision time, John made a game of rewording the phrase in the same line. The result was increased dexterity and economy in the use of words. Though he did not mingle much socially with the other students at MIT, John became very close with his roommate Rosario Honoré Trembley, who had a sense of fun and humor the teen-age Campbell found compatible. That, how­ ever, was as far as he cared to go in conforming. In class, Campbell was up to his old trick of straightening out in­ structors. In one instance, this penchant made him a friend. He challenged, before the students, a statement by Professor Blanchard, his chemistry instructor, regarding the “impos­ sibility” of amalgamating iron. Campbell brought in an ex­ perimental arrangement and performed the “impossible” in the classroom. Instead of being angry, the professor was de­ lighted and began to take a personal interest in Campbell, expressing sincere disappointment when his “prodigy” did not go on to make chemistry his life’s work. John had instinctively gravitated toward science fiction. He bought argosy fairly regularly and weird tales when­ ever he was certain it contained science fiction. He spotted the first issue of amazing stories when it appeared in April, 1926, and became a regular customer. When science-fiction authors’ imaginations showed signs of breaking out of the confines of the solar system, Campbell was enthralled. Smith’s The Skylark of Space established a lifelong admiratio'n for that author and an immediate desire to emulate. Stemming from his awareness that science-fiction authors frequently made obvious scientific errors, his first writing attempt, a short story called Invaders from the Infinite, was aimed at correcting one of the more widespread miscon­ ceptions: that there would be a problem in heating an inter­ planetary ship in space. The story, sent to amazing stories,\n\n32\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nwas accepted. Elated, Campbell pounded out a longer story, When the Atoms Foiled, and that, too, was accepted. His enthusiasm waned, however, as the months passed and nei­ ther sjtory appeared. Home on vacation in the summer of 1929, Campbell decided to visit T. O’Conor Sloane, the editor who had been in correspondence with him, and straighten out the matter. Now six-foot-one, with hawklike features, he presented a formidable appearance as he was ushered into Sloane’s edi­ torial offices at 381 Fourth Avenue, New York. Sloane had a flowing, long white beard. At the age of 80 he had finally been given the title of “Editor,” following the passing of the magazine from the ownership of its founder, Hugo Gemsback, to that of The E. P. Co., Inc. Despite his appearance, the old man was anything but a stuffed shirt. Kindly, almost genial, he made the embryonic author at home and then owned up to the fact that the manuscript of Invaders from the Infinite had been lost. Every corner of the office had been searched but it couldn’t be found. Did the author, perhaps, have a carbon? He did not? Well, his career would have to be launched with When the Atoms Failed, to be scheduled soon. In retrospect, Campbell always felt that the lost story would have more aptly been cast as an article and it was better lost. Sloane more than made up for the disappointment by carrying an illustration for When the Atoms Failed on the cover of the issue in which it appeared and beginning the blurb of the story: “Our new author, who is a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, shows marvelous ability at combining science with romance, evolving a piece of fiction of real scientific and literary value.” The story did contain original ideas. First,- though the idea of thinking brains in robots had been used frequently before, the concept of a stationary supercalculator, like to­\n\nJohn H7. Campbell\n\n33\n\nday’s Univac, had not appeared in the magazines. Scientists in science fiction, never sissies, previously disdained to use even an adding machine in whipping together mathematical concepts destined to change the very shape of the cosmos. Not so Steven Waterson, Campbell’s hero, who, improving on the Integraph, an electrical machine capable of calculus in use at MIT in 1930, built himself a pre-space-age elec­ tronic “brain” to aid in his problems. Secondly, it delved into the greater power to be derived from material energy—the actual destruction of matter—as opposed to atomic energy. This knowledge enables Steven Waterson to defeat a group of invading Martians, force the nations of the earth to scrap all their weapons, and set him­ self up as “president” of the planet. The issue in which Campbell’s first published story, When the Atoms Failed, appeared was dated January, 1930. By one of those coincidences that seem destined to gird the faith of doubting astrologers, just then a new magazine of science fiction appeared on the newsstands. The first issue of ASTOUNDING STORIES OF SUPER SCIENCE, tOO, Was dated January, 1930, and this was the magazine that Campbell was to make his literary monument. A sequel to When the Atoms Failed, The Metal Horde, appeared in the April, 1930, amazing stories. This attemped to show what would happen if calculators were re­ fined to the point where they could reason. Scientist Steven Waterson, in the course of the story, defeats and destroys a thinking machine, (originating on a planet of the star Si­ rius,) that has traveled through space for 1600 years ac­ companied by a brood of obedient mechanicals intent upon setting up a world of machines on Earth. Elements of J. Slchossel’s The Second Swarm (amazing stories quarterly, Spring, 1928) are apparent in this story and in The Voice of the Void, his next appearance, in the Summer, 1930, amazing stories quarterly. This nov­ elette tells of a ten-billion-year-old civilization on Earth, confronted by the final cooling of the sun, which utilizes\n\n34\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\n“phase velocity” as a means of going faster than light and escaping to another system. Campbell explained it this way: Phase velocity is due to a wave traveling along the wave chain. A man can go faster than the train he is riding on by walking\n\ntoward the engine, but practically speaking he cannot reach the station before the train. Similarly, the phase velocity can­ not reach the station before the light or X-rays do. But for countless ages the light has poured forth from the sun, and a message sent down that long train would be able to go many, many trillions of miles at a speed far greater than that of light.\n\nUtilizing this principle, earth ships, in an attempt to col­ onize plants around the star Betelguese, fight a series of battles with sentient force-creatures in that system. Though mindless, the force creatures adapt to a series of ever-morepotent weapons and give the earth men quite a tussle before they are exterminated. Few of the students at MIT during that period seemed to be interested in science fiction, but Campbell did secure the friendship of Norbert Weiner, professor of mathematics who is today hailed as the godfather of “thinking machines.” Weiner helped the young author with the scientific back­ ground of some of those early stories and may have been the inspiration of the “thinking machine” ideas. The names (Arcot, Wade, and Morey) of a group of characters in Piracy Preferred (amazing stories, June, 1930) provided the label for a major series that was to catapult Campbell to the top rank among science-fiction writers. In the world of 2126, a super criminal, Wade, with the technology to make his high-speed rocket ship invisible, uses a gas that will penetrate metal and temporarily para­ lyze all who come in contact with it, for his antisocial ac­ tivities. He puckishly leaves stock certificates for Piracy, Inc., in the amount of the money he steals. A team of young geniuses—Richard Arcot, a physicist; William Morey, mathematician and son of the president of Transcontinental Airways—in company with John Fuller, a design engineer, chase the pirate into an orbital trap\n\nJohn W. Campbell\n\n35\n\naround the earth. The culprit is permitted to join the group instead of being punished. The sympathetic handling of the “evildoer” may have been a holdover from E. E. Smith’s creation of the popular “villain” DuQuesne in The Skylark of Space. The group, in a ship powered by a new discovery which causes all molecules to move in the same direction and uses the power derived from the heat so created, takes off for the planet Venus in Solarite (amazing stories, November, 1930). There they find two warring races and side with one against the other, employing Wade’s invisibility device and paralyzing gas in the process. When the enemy fathoms the secret of invisibility and uses it against them, pellets of radium paint are employed to locate them, whereupon they are finished off with a molecular-motion weapon. amazing stories quarterly was an 8^ by 11 pulp pro­ duction, almost 34 of an inch thick, featuring 130,000 words of text and plenty of illustrations for 50 cents. This magazine would sometimes run three complete novels in a single issue and publication in it was a mark of prestige. The Black Star Passes, which received the cover of the Fall, 1930, edi­ tion, focused attention on Campbell and launched him on his first high wave of popularity, which was to challenge that of E. E. Smith, whose Skylark Three was running concur­ rently in the monthly amazing stories. In The Black Star Passes, an ancient race of hydrogenbreathing creatures living on a planet circling a vagrant dead star sweeps close to our solar system and decides to transfer to a fresh planet, Earth. In thousands of words of thrilling action (and many thousand dull words of scientific gobbldygook) they are defeated by the team of Arcot, Wade, Morey, and Fuller and retire to their retreating star. However, the battle has instilled them with new spirit and they are de­ termined that the next star they pass they will conquer. The Islands of Space in amazing stories quarterly for Spring, 1931, was Campbell’s first full-length novel and he let out all the stops. Exceeding the speed of light by bending\n\n36\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nthe curvature of space, Arcot, Wade, and Morey in their good ship Ancient Mariner tour a succession of worlds, find­ ing new wonders and challenges on each. Finally, lost in an infinity of light, they seek to find a race that can guide them, and in the process they help decide a war on a world tenmillion light years away from earth. The novel that followed, Invaders from the Infinite (amazing stories quarterly, Spring-Summer, 1932), represented the apex of approval for Campbell’s super­ science stories. This time, a tremendous ship manned by canines that have risen high on the evolutionary ladder lands on Earth to seek help against a universal menance. In the ne plus ultra of intergalactic ships, Thought, Arcot, Wade, and Morey search the far-flung star clusters for an answer to the danger, finally discovering it after as pyrotechnic a series of space battles as has ever appeared in science fic­ tion. Especially gripping is one episode illustrating the power of suggestion on the course of a battle, when emotions are magnified and projected by a special device. Campbell’s preoccupation with writing might have had something to do with his standing at MIT for in 1931 he was asked to leave. He had flunked out in German. While at MIT he had met Dona Stuart, a young girl at­ tending a Latin school in Waltham. He married her in the summer of 1931, after leaving school. Despite their differences, his father helped maintain him while he majored in physics for one year at Duke University and received his degree in science. Writing now became a welcome source of income as well as an avocation. Trying to support a wife and himself while finishing col­ lege during the depths of the worst depression in the history of the United States, Campbell decided to try other markets. He sold The Derelicts of Ganymede to wonder stories, where it appeared in January, 1932. The story is a satiric slap at the questionable ability of a business tycoon to come out on top if he lets a young man start on even keel. This was followed by The Electronic Siege (wonder\n\nJohn IF. Campbell\n\n37\n\nstories, April, 1932), featuring Captain Don Barclay, a physically powerful and mentally extraordinary Jovian pro­ totype of Aarn Munro, who breaks up an illicit medical ex­ perimental station on a planetoid. He brought Don Barclay back again in Space Rays (wonder stories, December, 1932) to aid in the capture of a space pirate. Hugo Gemsback, the publisher, was moved to write a special editorial instead of the customary blurb for this story. Titled “Rea­ sonableness in Science Fiction,” it offered the opinion that Campbell was obviously writing a science-fiction burlesque: “If he has left out any colored rays, or any magical rays that could not immediately perform certain miraculous won­ ders, we are not aware of this shortcoming in this story. . . . We were tempted to rename the story ‘Ray! Ray!’ but thought better of it.” The truth was that Campbell wasn’t burlesquing anybody. This was the way he always wrote. The combination of the left-handed compliment and the fact that wonder stories, in financial difficulties, was paying very slowly soured him on that market. Average rates for amazing stories and wonder stories in 1932 was Vi cent a word on publication, amazing stories paid promptly on publication, but its editor, now heading for 90 years of age, tended to take the long view. One year after acceptance was a breakneck race into pub­ lication for him and instances where five years intervened were not unknown, wonder stories published quickly, but frequently paid a good time after publication. In these cir­ cumstances, Campbell was obliged to find a job. He tried selling Fords for a short period. Then he switched to exhaust fans for homes and stores in the sum­ mer. As a salesman, he found that his imagination was an asset. For example, he sold four 30-inch fans to a chain restaurant by suggesting that all the windows be open when they were in use so the establishment could carry the slogan: “Always a breeze.” At the approach of winter he took to promoting gas\n\n38\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nheaters. The Boston utility company had a much lower rate for those who also used gas for heating. Campbell was able to show a restaurant chain that by converting their heating units to gas, they would pay for their cooking gas at lower rates and save $2,500 a year. It worked! Three other com­ panies signed up for the change-over and he was out of a job. It would take his small company years to install all the business he had obtained, so they wouldn’t be needing any salesmen for a while. So, as was to happen to E. E. Smith when the war years came, Campbell found himself looking for work despite—or perhaps because of—his efficiency. Subtly, though, a change was taking place in Campbell’s thinking and writing. It was first evidenced in the intro­ ductory passages of The Black Star Passes, where an atmo­ sphere of hopelessness and sympathy was engendered for the great people of a dying planet now thousands of years on the decline. It began to take form in The Last Evolution (amazing stories, August, 1932), in which the courageous battle of thinking machines to save their creators from a cosmic menace, climaxing in the evolution of the mechanisms into energy consciousnesses of pure thought, raises them to an allegorical heaven. Our machines will be our friends to the last, inevitably outlive us, progress beyond us, and possibly even go to their just reward, Campbell suggests. The Last Evolution marks the point of transition in Camp­ bell’s writing career, the change to stress on mood and writing technique from the superscientific action character­ istic of past Campbell stories. Campbell credited his reading of The Red Gods Call by C. E. Scoggins for the change. Temporarily living in Wilson, North Carolina, he set out to write a story in which mood and characterization would predominate and science would play a secondary role. He had in mind a story that would “sing,” that would figura­ tively serve as a symphonic mood piece in words set to a science-fiction theme. This was the story; Twilight. Seven million years from today, it is the twilight of man.\n\nJohn W. Campbell\n\n39\n\nA mighty civilization served by faithful automatic machin­ ery continues to function: “When Earth is cold, and the Sun has died out, those machines will go on. When Earth begins to creak and break, those perfect, ceaseless machines will try to repair her—.” No drive, no progress lies in the dwindling human race. Only stagnation. The man from our day, visiting this future, programs machines to work on the creation of a mechanism with built-in curiosity. The story suggests, as did The Last Evolution, that even if man goes, the machines can build their own civilization. Despite Campbell’s popularity, every magazine of early 1933 rejected the story and it went back into his files. Then, in late 1933, F. Orlin Tremaine assumed editorship of astounding stories and began a drive for leadership in the field. A high point in his dramatic bid was securing the third story in E. E. Smith’s “Skylark” series, The Skylark of Valeron. The logical next step was to obtain Campbell, the leading contender for Smith’s popularity. Tremaine wrote to Campbell, asking if he had a superscience story along the lines that had established his popularity. In 1933 Campbell had sold The Mightiest Machine to Sloane at amazing. Over a year had passed and Sloane had not published this story, nor had he yet scheduled another Campbell novel, Mother World. Campbell got Sloane to return the story and sub­ mitted it to Tremaine, who purchased it immediately. Heartened, Campbell dusted off Twilight and sent it in. Tremaine went quietly mad about it and couldn’t get it into print fast enough. Twilight, rushed into the November, 1934, issue, a month before The Mightiest Machine, could not be published under Campbell’s own name for two reasons. First, most obviously it would destroy the build-up in progress for The Mightiest Machine. Secondly, it was so different in approach that it would disorient the readers accustomed to a certain style of story from Campbell. The problem was solved with a pen\n\n40\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nname, Don A. Stuart, derived from the maiden name of Campbell’s wife, Dona Stuart. “A new writer,” Tremaine blurbed, “a profoundly differ­ ent and beautiful treatment of an always fascinating idea— Twilight by Don A. Stuart. A story of the far, faint future, of the fabulous cities and machines of man—and of his slow decline into eternal sleep.” H. G. Wells’ Time Machine possessed, in its description of the decadent civilization of the Eloi, certain elements of Twilight. The concept of automatic, near-perfect cities, func­ tioning long after man has forgotten how to repair them, was superbly delineated in The Machine Stops (1928) by E. M. Forster. Similarly, the lonely, magnificent, nearly eternal, but deserted cities of Bronson Beta are described movingly by Edwin Balmer and Philip Wylie in After Worlds Collide (blue book, 1933). Yet mood had never been the primary purpose in the presentations of the civilizations and cities of these other authors. Nor had anyone so completely attempted to canonize the machine. Over and over again, Campbell’s message remained clear: The machine is not the enemy and ruination of man; it is his friend and protector. Don A. Stuart bid fair to eclipse Campbell in popularity as a result of this single story, Twilight. Its appearance was to alter the pattern of science-fiction writing. Warner Van Lome’s immensely popular Strange City (astounding stories, December, 1935) and World of Purple Light (astounding stories, December, 1936) were unquestion­ ably inspired by it. Arthur C. Clarke, in both Rescue Party (astounding science-fiction, May, 1946) and Against the Fall of Night (startling stories, November, 1948),' displays his debt to Twilight. Lester del Rey’s inspiration for intelligent dogs in The Faithful may derive from a brief section in Twilight. Stuart appeared again with Atomic Power in the Decem­ ber, 1934, astounding stories, a story in which men pre­ vent the structure of our solar system from being blown up\n\nJohn W- Campbell\n\n41\n\nby atomcrackers in the macrocosmos. The lead story of the issue was the first installment of The Mightiest Machine, and a third story by Campbell in the same issue, The Irrelevant, resulted in months of debate in the readers’ column, since he presented a theoretical evasion of the law of conservation of energy. This was published under the pseudonym Karl van Kampen, the name of a Dutch great-grandfather on his father’s side. Blindness (astounding stories, March, 1935), as Stuart, was a poignant sketch of a scientist who loses his sight in space to bring the world the blessings of atomic energy, only to learn that inadvertently another discovery of his provides a cheaper power source. He dies embittered because the world does not want his atomic energy. One of the most remarkable and underrated performances under the Stuart name was The Escape (astounding stories, May, 1935), written as the result of an argument with a would-be writer as to whether or not it was possible to write a successful love story in the framework of science fiction. A girl who runs off with a boy she loves to escape marrying the selection of the Genetics Board is finally cap­ tured and brought back and psychologically reconditioned to “love” the “right” man. This remains one of the finest love stories science fiction has yet produced. With The Mightiest Machine receiving reader accolades, Campbell thought sequels were in order. He wrote three, continuing the adventures of Aarn Munro and his com­ panions. The first, a 15,000-word novelette, The Incredible Planet, utilized the well-worn device of losing his characters in space thus enabling them to stumble upon a world whose inhabitants have remained in suspended animation for 400 billion years; a second sequel, The Interstellar Search, finds the earthmen aiding a planet whose sun is about to become a nova; and in the final story, The Infinite Atom, they ar­ rive home in time to block an invasion by creatures whose previous visit to earth gave rise to the centaur legends.\n\n42\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\nTremaine rejected all three. He felt that the day of the superscience epic was past and insisted that Campbell stick strictly to Stuart-style stories. Another augury was the mild response to Mother World, a story of the revolt of the op­ pressed working groups against their fiendish masters, with the planet as the prize, serialized at last in the January, February, and March, 1935, issues of amazing stories as The Contest of the Plants. The three sequels to The Might­ iest Machine eventually were published as a Fantasy Press book, The Incredible Planet, in 1949. Campbell was forced to give full emphasis to Don A. Stuart in a series which he called “The Teachers,” but which never was so labeled, beginning in the February, 1935, astounding stories with The Machine. In this story, a thinking machine that has provided every comfort for men leaves the planet for their own good, forcing them to forage for themselves. This story inspired Jack Williamson’s With Folding Hands and its sequel . . And Searching Mind,” concerning robots that overprotect man from every possible injury or error, and from himself. The Invaders (astounding stories, June, 1935), a se­ quel to The Machine, describes a mankind reverted to savagery, easily enslaved by the Tharoo, a race from an­ other world. Rebellion (astounding stories, August, 1935) finds the human race, through selective breeding, becomes more in­ telligent than the Tharoo, driving the invaders back off the planet. The foregoing were not primarily mood stories, but they were adult fare—the predecessors of an entirely new type of science fiction. In Hight, a sequel to Twilight, published in the October, 1935, astounding stories, Campbell stirringly returned to the mood story. A man of today moves into the inconceiv­ ably distant future, when not only the sun but the stars themselves are literally burnt out. At his presence, machines\n\nJohn W- Campbell\n\n43\n\nfrom Neptune move to serve him, but he recognizes them for what they are: “This, I saw, was the last radiation of the heat of life from an already-dead body—the feel of life and warmth, imitation of life by a corpse,” for man and all but the last dregs of universal energy are gone. “You still wonder that we let man die out?” asked the machine. “It was best. In another brief million years he would have lost his high estate. It was best.” Campbell had matured. A civilization of machines, he now understands, is but parody, movement without consciousness. It is not and can never be “the last evolution.” Campbell returned to his home state of New Jersey, in 1935, working at a variety of jobs: the research department of Mack Truck in New Brunswick; Hoboken Pioneer Instru­ ments; and finally Carleton Ellis, Montclair, in 1936, setting up residence at Orange, New Jersey, to be near his work. Carleton Ellis, namesake and founder of the firm, had more chemical patents than any man in the world and was a con­ sultant on the subject. He is credited with making the first paint remover that worked. Campbell was able to tolerate only six months of writing and editing textbooks and tech­ nical literature for Ellis, but nevertheless the position gave him discipline in editing and publishing that would soon prove invaluable. Out of work, Campbell accepted the assignment of writ­ ing a monthly article on astronomy for Tremaine, plus an occasional Stuart story. These activities barely kept food on the table. Campbell’s most successful story in 1936 was Frictional Losses (astounding stories, July, 1936), under the Stuart byline, in which a method of eliminating friction proves the ultimate weapon against invaders from outer space. wonder stories had been sold by Gernsback to Standard Magazines and now appeared as thrilling wonder stories. Campbell arranged with the editor, Mort Weisinger, for a series of stories under his own name, built\n\n44\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\naround the characters of Penton and Blake, two fugitives from Earth. The best of the group was the first, Brain Stealers of Mars (thrilling wonder stories, December, 1936), concerning Martians capable of converting them­ selves into an exact replica of any object or person. They provide a knotty problem for the visitors from Earth. This story and those that followed had the light note of humor and the wacky alien creatures which Stanley G. Weinbaum had recently made so popular. Closest in quality to Night and Twilight proved to be For­ getfulness (astounding stories, June, 1937), in which earthmen landing on a distant planet assume that a race is decadent because it has deserted the automatic cities and mighty power devices that man, in his current state of pro­ gress, associates with civilization. Influential as well as entertaining was his novelette of the Sarn, Out of Night (astounding stories, October, 1937). A matriarchial society of aliens who have conquered the earth and have ruled it for 4,000 years are challenged by Aesir, a black, amorphous mass vaguely in the shape of man, ostensibly personifying humanity’s unified yearnings past and present. This device was picked up by Robert A. Heinlein in Sixth Column, where it helps to route the Asiatic conquerors. Cloak of Aesir, a sequel, demonstrated the use of psychol­ ogy in driving the “people” of the Sarn from their domina­ tion of Earth, and terminated the short series in astounding science-fiction for March, 1939. Tremaine’s duties had been expanded to cover editorial directorship of top-notch, bill barnes, romance range, clues, and a number of other Street & Smith periodicals. To assist him, he hired an editor for each of the magazines. Campbell’s availability, his skill as a writer, and his intensive if limited editorial experience with Carleton Ellis put him in line for the position with astounding. He was put on the payroll of Street & Smith in September, 1937. Inevitably his writing, except for special occasions, had to cease.\n\nJohn W- Campbell\n\n45\n\nF. Orlin Tremaine left Street & Smith in May, 1938, as the result of internal politics. Campbell was completely on his own, and there would be less time than ever. Few authors ever made their literary exit more magnifi­ cently than did Campbell. From the memories of his childhood he drew the most fearsome agony of the past: the doubts the fears, the shock, and the frustration of repeatedly discovering that the woman who looked so much like his mother was not who she seemed. Who goes there? Friend or foe? He had attempted the theme once before, employing a light touch, in Brain Stealers of Mars. This time he was serious. Who Goes There? (astounding science-fiction, August, 1938) deals with an alien thing from outer space that enters the camp of an Antarctic research party and blends alternately into the forms of the various men and dogs in the camp. The job is to find and kill the chimera before, in the guise of some human being or animal, it gets back to civilization. An impressive display of writing talent, Who Goes There? is in one sense one of the most thrilling detective stories ever written. The suspense and tension mount with each paragraph and are sustained to the last. Reading this story inspired A. E. van Vogt to turn to science fiction with Vault of the Beast, a direct take-off on the idea. In Europe, Eric Frank Russell picked up the notion in Spiro, one of his most effective stories. RKO, altering the story considerably, pro­ duced it as a profitable horror picture called The Thing (1951). A few more Stuart stories would sporadically appear. The Elder Gods (unknown, October, 1939), a swiftly paced sword-and-sorcery tale, was written as a last-minute fill-in when a cover story by Arthur J. Burks proved unsatisfac­ tory. Together with The Moon Is Hell, a short novel of stark realism drawing a parallel between the survival problems of Antarctic and moon explorers, it made its appearance as a Fantasy Press book in 1951. Fifteen years after he had quit writing for a living, Camp­\n\n46\n\nSeekers of Tomorrow\n\nbell still displayed excellent technique in The Idealists, a novelette written expressly for the hard-cover anthology 9 Tales of Space and Time, edited by Raymond J. Healy for Henry Holt in 1954. Scientists aren’t always “good guys,” was the point he made, and a high degree of technical de­ velopment does not necessarily carry with it maturity in dealing with different cultures. But for all practical purposes, Campbell’s writing career ended at the age of 28 with Who Goes There? As one of the first of the modern science-fiction writers, he had a profound influence on the field. As editor of the leading, best-paying magazine, he taught, coerced, and cajoled his type of story. As a result, for the more than a quarter-century since he ceased writing, older readers have been haunted by halfremembered echoes in the plot structure of hundreds of stories and in the lines of scores of writers. It is not strange if sometimes readers shake the hypnotic wonder of the wheeling cosmos from their minds and demand: “Who goes there?”\n\n3 MURRAY LEINSTER\n\nThe whole thing began when the clock on the Metropoli­ tan Tower began to run backwards.” That was the opening sentence of The Runaway Skyscraper in the February 22, 1919, issue of argosy, and with those words Murray Lein­ ster began his science-fiction writing career. Already a vet­ eran with two years of steady magazine sales behind him, young Leinster had sold argosy a series of Happy Village stories and was fed up with predigested pabulum. There would be no more in that series for a while, he wrote editor Matthew White, Jr., since he was working on a story open­ ing with the lines, “The whole thing began when the clock on the Metropolitan Tower began to run backwards.” “By return mail,” recalls Leinster, “I got a letter telling me to let him see it when I finished. So I had to write it or admit I was lying.” At the time the story was written, the tower of the home 47\n\n48\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\noffice of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company was one of the tallest and most distinctive skyscrapers in New York topped by a clock that was a city landmark. Readers of argosy were enthralled to read of the building’s remarkable journey in time back to a period hundreds of years before white men appeared on this continent. Some two thousand workers in the skyscraper thus find themselves confronted with the task of obtaining enough food to eat and suitable fuel to run the building’s mammoth generators. Little help can be expected from the few thoroughly “shaken” Indians that have witnessed this strange occurrence. The scientific “explanation,” that the skyscraper has sunk back in time instead of down into a pool of water created by a spring beneath it, taxed one’s credulity only slightly less than the unimpaired functioning of the entire elevator, telephone, and cooking systems of the building, even though outside sources of power were hundreds of years away. Leinster’s characters poked around a bit, but since the author couldn’t quite seem to figure out the solution of the sustenance pro­ blem, he had the hero reestablish the equilibrium of the structure in its own time by pouring soapsuds into the sub­ surface water. The building reappears at exactly the same moment it left, and no one believes the tale its occupants tell. An argosy readership that was still completing Garret Smith’s novel that whisked them into the future of After a Million Years and had accepted the revival of Aztec gods in the modern world as offered by Francis Stevens in Citadel of Fear only months earlier was not inclined to quibble over “details.” They greeted Murray Leinster’s effort with enthusi­ asm and one of the most fabulous writing careers in sciencefiction history was launched. Forty-three years later, in 1962, Murray Leinster was voted one of the six favorite modern writers of science fiction; more of his stories had been antho­ logized than any living science-fiction writer’s, including classics as First Contact, The Strange Case of John Kingman, Symbiosis, A Logic Named Joe, and The Lonely Planet. Other writers who started and achieved fame in the same\n\nMurray Leinster\n\n49\n\nperiod as Leinster—Ray Cummings, Garret Smith, Victor Rousseau, Francis Stevens, Homer Eon Flint, Austin Hall, J. U. Giesy—are dead and their work lives only in the nostalgic memories of a dwindling group of old-time readers. But their contemporary, Murray Leinster, is very much alive; his novelette Exploration Team received the Hugo* as the best story in its class in 1956, and in 1960 his novel Pirates of Ersatz was nominated for the best novel of the year. William Fitzgerald Jenkins was born in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1896. His alter ego, Murray Leinster, would not come into being until Jenkins had passed his twenty-first birthday. His family tree has roots deep in colonial times; an ancestor eight generations back, was governor of North Carolina. Another of his roots lay in Leinster County, ireland, in­ habited by a people proud in the knowledge that the kings of Leinster were the last of that country to give up their independence. His education terminated abruptly after only three months of the eighth grade, never to be resumed. Young Jenkins’ burning ambition was to be a scientist, and inquiry into the nature of things prompted him to buy materials to build a glider, which he successfully flew at Sandstorm Hill, Cape Henry, Virginia, in 1909, winning a prize from fly, the first aeronautical magazine, for his achievement. The same year, at the age of 13, he placed an essay about Robert E. Lee in the Virginian pilot, making that his first published work. Technically, it was also his first “paid” authorship, for an old Confederate veteran sent him five dollars upon reading it. To earn a living, he worked as an office boy, writing at night. Every day for a year he wrote 1,000 words and tore it up. At the age of 17 he began to place fillers and epigrams with smart set, the new yorker of pre-World War I days. Such fragments did not constitute a living ($5 for 12 epigrams) so Will Jenkins set his sights * The “Hugo” is the science fiction world’s synonym for the “Oscar,” a cast metal space ship awarded annually at the World Science Fiction Convention, to the fields outstanding contributors.\n\nARCHBISHOP MITTY HIGH SCHOOL. LIBRARt San Jose. California\n\n50\n\nSeekers Of Tomorrow\n\non the pulps, which were replacing the dime-novel as the reading matter of American youth. The editors of smart set, George Jean Nathan and H. L. Mencken who included one epigram in a book and paid a five-cent beer for royalties, perfectly straight-faced, suggested that he use a pen name for argosy or all-story so as not to hurt his reputation in the “big time.” Jenkins thought this was Grade-A advice and together with a friend, Wynham Martyn, concocted Murray Leinster out of his family lineage. He had moved to Newark, New Jersey, to work as a bookkeeper for the Prudential Insurance Company, and that city later served as the locale of a number of his stories, most notably The Incredible Invasion. Clicking regularly at Mun­ sey and other publishing houses, Leinster resigned his post with Prudential on his twenty-first birthday and, apart from a stint in the Office of War Information during World War II, has never held a salaried position since. In 1919, Street & Smith, watching the prosperity of Mun­ sey’s argosy and all-story magazines, with their heavy emphasis on science-fiction, fantasy, supernatural, and offtrail stories, decided to bring out a magazine whose fiction would stress those elements. They called it thrill book and put it under the editorship of Eugene Clancy and Harold Hersey. Before the first issue appeared, dated March 1, 1919, the editors found that new fantasies were difficult to obtain, so they dropped the notion of an all-fantasy periodical and filled out the greater part of the magazine with straight adventure and mystery stories. Hersey had read Leinster’s The Runaway Skyscraper in argosy a few weeks earlier and was also familiar with the Will Jenkins stories in smart set. He urged the young writer to try his hand at science fiction for thrill book. Three stories resulted. The first, A Thousand Degrees Below Zero, in the July 15, 1919, number, involved an inventor who succeeds in building a machine which will draw all heat from objects toward which it is directed, resulting in death for liv­\n\nMurray Leinster\n\n51\n\ning things and brittle disintegration for inanimate objects. A vigorous bout with the United States government ends in the inventor's defeat, but this story pattern, with a variety of inventions, was to remain a Leinster standard for the next twenty-five years. A sequel, The Silver Menace, appeared in two install­ ments, in the September 1 and September 15, 1919, numbers of thrill book. This time the world is threatened by a swiftly multiplying life-form that virtually turns the seas to glimmering jelly. The final issue of thrill book, October 15, 1919, carried Leinster’s third story, Juju, a straightforward adventure novelette set in an African locale. What makes this story worth mentioning is that by this time the value of the “Mur­ ray Leinster” name rated the cover illustration of the maga­ zine. Jean Henri Fabre’s books on insects inspired Leinster to write The Mad Planet, the first of a trilogy which, if not his finest contribution to science fiction, is among his best. A secondary purpose of the author was to confound those literary critics who claimed that stories with little or no dialogue could not retain a modern reader’s interest. The Mad Planet was a sensation when it appeared in argosy for June 12, 1920. Depicting a world of the far distant future, where climatic conditions have made it possible for insects and plants to grow to gigantic proportions and mankind is reduced to a primitive, hunted state, The Mad Planet held readers in thrall. Burl, a primitive genius, slowly begins to lead man back out of savagery. The Mad Planet struck a chord of universal appeal. The sequel, Red Dust, in argosy for April 2, 1921, is an even better story than the original. Burl’s adventures and explorations thrillingly expand the scope of man’s knowledge and hopes. Each time these two stories have been reprinted -in amazing stories in 1926; in tales of wonder in 1939; and in fantastic novels, 1948-49—a new genera­ tion of readers has endorsed Leinster’s artistry.\n\n52\n\nSeekers Of'Tomorrow\n\nFinally, twenty-two years after the appearance of the first story, Leinster completed the trilogy with Nightmare Planet in the June, 1953, issue of science-fiction plus. It was an older, more philosophical, more thoughtful Leinster writing in this story, but the magic of the first two was still there. With the locale changed to another planet for scientific reasons, the three appeared in hard covers as The Forgotten Planet, a book of such appeal that it is unlikely to become a forgotten classic. From 1923 on, one of the pillars of fantasy in the United States was weird tales, a magazine which developed such favorites as H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, Clark Ash­ ton Smith, Henry S. Whitehead, C. L. Moore, and many others during its lifetime. Leinster’s initial contribution to this magazine, The Oldest Story in the World, was done more as a favor to editor Farnsworth Wright than for monetary reward. A tale of greed and torture in Old India, it was the favorite story in the August, 1925, issue in which it appeared, receiving such wildly enthusiastic salutes from fellow writers Seabury Quinn and Frank Belknap Long as “equal to Kipling.” A three-part novel, The Strange People, about a group of foreigners held in bondage in a New England valley because of an artificially induced skin condition that resembled le­ prosy, beginning in the March, 1928, issue of weird tales, scored very high with the readers and kept the name of Mur­ ray Leinster before the readers in the fantasy field at a time when most of his efforts were concentrated elsewhere. In 1929, Leinster submitted a novelette entitled Darkness on Fifth Avenue to detective fiction weekly, along with sketches of three sequels. Howard Bloomfield, the editor, returned the story and recommended a try at argosy, noting that though it might qualify as a detective yarn on a technicality, its suggested sequels could make no similar claim. The editors of that magazine gave the cover of the November 30, 1929, issue to this story of a detective who,\n\nMurray Leinster\n\n53\n\nusing nothing but common sense, hunts down and defeats a brilliant scientific criminal who has built a device which will absorb all light from any area in which he desires to function. This carefully wrought story deserved t"
