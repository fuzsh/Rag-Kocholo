Cacek\" as the Best Non-Fiction Article of 1999. Drop by and see what else won.\n\nTerence M. Green Reading List: his novel, A Witness to Life is a gem. Any of his books is a pleasant suprise and a treat, if you like fine writing.\n\nTopical Book Lists: would you like to see what's been written on certain topics? Here are a few lists to pique your interest.\n\nAre you a writer? Do you know about these writers' resources?\n\nWebs of Wonder is a web contest to build SF resources for educators on subjects faced in today's classroom.\n\nAuthor & Fan Tribute Sites: we've built 26 pages of them (plus one for Mc).\n\nOur Contents Page highlights reviews of The Garden of the Stone by Victoria Strauss, Teranesia by Greg Egan, White of the Moon edited by Stephen Jones and Emphyrio by Jack Vance.\n\nSF Site Interviews: In past issues, we've interviewed Neal Stephenson, Tad Williams, Tim Powers and many others.\n\nConventions: we've updated our coverage to include listings broken down by date, by location and by category.\n\nSF Site Chronological and Alphabetic List: wondering what appeared in previous SF Site issues?\n\nHindSite: we've summarized and listed the SF Site's past editorials for your convenience.\n\nOr perhaps you're just interested in our recent issues:\n\nSF Site is host to:\n\nVisit our sister site\n\nfor the best in SF-oriented chat.\n\nFor SF TV movie listings from SF Site and TVNow, visit\n\nThe Kingless Land by Ed Greenwood\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nAglirta, a land studded with feuding baronies, lethal mages, travelling bards, and -- given the title -- no king to unite the country. There is a king, but he has been sleeping for some 1000 years now; only those wielding a mighty magic and legendary relics can awaken him. Magic is in no short supply in this world. Lady Embra Silvertree, daughter of the most powerful and most ruthless baron of all, is a sorceress in her own right. Until she is liberated by a pair of reluctant rescuers, she is destined to become the lifeforce of his castle. Add one reclusive healer to the mix and you have a motley crew heading out to save Aglirta.\n\nFlights of Fantasy edited by Mercedes Lackey\n\nreviewed by Georges T. Dodds\n\nWith 10 original tales of birds of prey (plus one about crows) ranging from humorous to dark fantasy, this anthology has tales of falconry, Native American tribal totem birds, Arthurian reincarnations, along with stubborn princesses and nasty sorcerers. As a bonus, there is a novella by Mercedes Lackey which further develops one of the neglected characters of her recent novel, Black Swan.\n\nSultan of the Moon and Stars by Tom Arden\n\nreviewed by Neil Walsh\n\nThe 1001 Arabian Nights is the main inspiration for the 3rd book of The Orokon. Driven by his quest to the exotic, desert lands of Unang Lia, Jem finds himself in a world of magic and mystery, with flying carpets, genies, harems of beautiful women, eunuchs, clever thieves, illusory palaces, real palaces, cobras, curses, sexual innuendo and explicit sex (although less of these last two items than in the original tales of Shahrazad). And it's all done with wit and style.\n\nThe Guardian by Beecher Smith\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nSooner or later, every horror author does it. They can't help themselves. The overwhelming compulsion to rewrite Dracula -- the need to trot that old vampire legend out for another go. It wouldn't be so sad if most of them were well done. Or original. It would be wonderful if all of them were as entertaining as this novel.\n\nThe Stars Compel by Michaela Roessner\n\nreviewed by Kristen Chew\n\nThe sequel to The Stars Dispose is likewise set in the well-mined battlefield that was 16th-century Italy. Caterina is the sole legitimate heir to the once great Medici line, and powers both in this world and in others are warring over possible futures for her. Pope Clement, wanting to keep a closer eye on his great niece, moves Caterina to Rome. Tommaso the chef joins her and becomes her eyes and ears outside of the palace, following the events of his life -- his love affair with Michelangelo, his continuing development as a master cook and reluctant spy, and the slow, inevitable blossoming of his talents as an heir to the Old Religion.\n\nForthcoming Books\n\ncompiled by Neil Walsh\n\nYou've got more to look forward to in the coming months than just a change of season. There are new authors to discover, such as Juliet Marillier or Alastair Reynolds, as well as new books on the way from Gregory Benford, James Alan Gardner, Terry Pratchett, and others.\n\nThe Removal by Warren Patabendi\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nSome people go for horror with scary monsters, mutated insects, nameless evils. Some people go for horror with scary people -- the real monsters to watch out for. Alfred Hitchcock had it down to an art form; nothing is more frightening than the things human beings are willing to do to each other. Want some horror like that?\n\nAsimov's SF, February 2000\n\nreviewed by Trent Walters\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin once again turns convention on its head in \"The Royals of Hegn,\" which details the customs and habits of the royal family in a country where everyone is royal except for a single common family; L. Timmel Duchamp wrestles with compelling issues of personhood in \"How Josiah Taylor Lost His Soul\"; and Esther M. Friesner presents \"The Shunned Trailer,\" which chronicles 2 days in the life of an Ivy League city-boy who stumbles upon the Cthulhu horrors of the South.\n\nNew Magazines\n\ncompiled by John O'Neill\n\nThe SF Site's FictionHome page brings you the latest news and reviews of genre magazines and other short fiction. We look at brand new issues of Talebones, Interzone, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and many more.\n\nSimon Ings\n\nAn interview with David Mathew\n\nOn starting to read SF:\n\n\"I have the local library to thank: Petersfield Library, whose staff, in their wisdom, decided that science fiction was children's literature. Presumably, not only because of the covers, but because, in the 70s, the books were nice and short: 45-50,000 words long. Also, I have a brother who is 12 years older than me, and I inherited his entire science fiction collection.\"\n\nRoverandom by J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nreviewed by Trent Walters\n\nThis is a children's fantasy under whose spell Trent occasionally forgot he was critiquing. It follows the picaresque adventures of Rover the dog after a wizard transforms him into a toy dog and his subsequent trials and tribulations in a toy shop, on a beach, to the moon, through the dream world beyond, under the Deep Blue Sea, and back again.\n\nMid-February Books\n\ncompiled by Neil Walsh\n\nThe past month has brought us some exciting first novels, some classic reprints, and long-awaited conclusions to some favoured series. On the shelves of your local bookstore, you can expect to find new titles by Guy Gavriel Kay, Nalo Hopkinson, Alan Dean Foster, William Shatner, Stephen Baxter, Piers Anthony, and more.\n\nThe Robot's Twilight Companion by Tony Daniel\n\nreviewed by John O'Neill\n\nAll of the 9 short stories and novellas in this collection were originally published in Asimov's Science Fiction magazine between 1992 and 1999. They include the Hugo nominee \"Life on the Moon,\" the title story and the basis for the novel Earthling and the near-masterpiece \"A Dry Quiet War,\" a tale of warfare and loss at the end of time. John felt this was one of the best books he read last year, and the most original short fiction collection he's stumbled across in a long time.\n\nBabylon 5.1\n\nTV reviews by Rick Norwood\n\nRick offers us tips on what's worth watching during March of the four episodes from The X-Files and five for Star Trek: Voyager (X-Files looks like the better bet).\n\nThe Edge: Tales Of Suspense #6 edited by Greg F. Gifune\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nIf talent will out (sometimes it does) some of these names will be popping up on best-of lists everywhere. Chilling, heinous, even sickening -- there's something here for every appetite. Just don't assume every bite will be a pleasure.\n\nThe Demolished Man by Alfred Bester\n\nreviewed by Todd Richmond\n\nIt takes place in a future where a small percentage of the population has developed telepathic powers. Called peepers, they have revolutionized business, government, and, most importantly, law enforcement. In fact, no act of premeditated murder has been committed in more than 70 years. So Lincoln Polwell is somewhat astonished to be summoned to a popular socialite's home to investigate both a murder and a disappearance.\n\nSky Coyote by Kage Baker\n\nreviewed by Rich Horton\n\nThe Company makes a profit by saving things lost to history: works of art, rare plants, even whole cultures. The Company's immortal agents are mostly recruited from among doomed children throughout history and pre-history. For, you see, the Company has discovered the secrets of both time travel and immortality... but the use of both is limited.\n\nIn the Beginning... Was the Command Line by Neal Stephenson\n\nreviewed by Peter D. Tillman\n\nIt is an amusing guide to the whole dos/mac/windows/unix/gnu/linux/beos soap opera, for the perplexed -- highly recommended. It's aimed at the Unix-literate (whose ranks certainly don't include Peter), but anyone who's messed about with computers will find some goodies."
