        "text": "Here is this year’s challenge bingo card that you can download here. At the moment I don’t know who created this card so let me know in the comments.\n\nAnd this is my initial TBR for this yearly challenge. I won’t be describing each of the prompts, so for a better challenge description look here.\n\nI might need to change a couple of books because one of the rules states that “You may not repeat an author on the card” and I thought of books by Adrian Tchaikovsky for four of the prompts. I wrote the books I thought about here even if they won’t be my final choice but I plan to read all of those anyway and I recommend them too.\n\nA couple of my book choices may be not speculative fiction, but as usual I will either change my final choice or not submit a card next year since I always participate in this challenge in a low key way.\n\nFirst Row Across\n\nA Book from r/Fantasy’s Top LGBTQIA List:\n\nThe Cloud Roads (The Books of the Raksura #1) by Martha Wells\n\nI want to start this series since years.\n\nWeird Ecology:\n\n(Semiosis Duology #1) by Sue Burke\n\nThis has been in my TBR for a couple of years now and it qualifies for hard mode since it isn’t written by Jeff VanderMeer or China Miéville.\n\nTwo or More Authors:\n\nObsidio by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff\n\nI have the third book in this trilogy since years in my list of series to finish, so I might just finally read it.\n\nHistorical SFF:\n\nThe Diviners (The Diviners #1) by Libba Bray.\n\nThe setting here is New York City 1926, so this probably qualifies for hard mode.\n\nSet in Space:\n\nThis is probably the easiest prompt in this bingo board for me. I might read Mickey7 by Edward Ashton.\n\nSecond Row Across\n\nStandalone:\n\nThe Bone Maker by Sarah Beth Durst\n\nAnti-Hero:\n\nThe Amulet of Samarkand (Bartimaeus #1) by Jonathan Stroud\n\nBook Club OR Readalong Book:\n\nWinter’s Orbit by Everina Maxwell\n\nCool Weapon:\n\nI have no idea yet, but I think many of my fantasy books will be fine for this prompt.\n\nRevolutions and Rebellions:\n\nI also still have no idea yet, but I think I’ll just find it along the way too.\n\nThird Row Across\n\nName in the Title:\n\nThe 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton. Another book I have since years in my TBR.\n\nAuthor Uses Initials:\n\nSwordheart (The World of the White Rat) by T. Kingfisher\n\nPublished in 2022:\n\nEyes of the Void by Adrian Tchaikovsky. I read the first book in this duology in March and I want to continue it asap.\n\nUrban Fantasy:\n\nThe Nightjar (The Nightjar #1) by Deborah Hewitt. I don’t know much about this book but let’s try a new author for this prompt.\n\nSet in Africa:\n\nRosewater (The Wormwood Trilogy #1) by Tade Thompson. Yet another case of a book I have had for years in my TBR.\n\nFourth Row Across\n\nNon-Human Protagonist:\n\nChildren of Ruin by Adrian Tchaikovsky. I read the first book in this series awhile ago, but I want to continue it this year.\n\nWibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey:\n\nThe First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North. Yet another case of a book that has been in my TBR for years now.\n\nFive SFF Short Stories:\n\nI have a lot of anthologies I want to read so I hope to read one of them for the hard mode of this prompt.\n\nFeatures Mental Health:\n\nWe Are the Ants by Shaun David Hutchinson. This seem to be an interesting mixture of Contemporary and Sci-fi.\n\nSelf-Published OR Indie Publisher:\n\nDeath Trace (Hound of Hades #1) by Zoe Cannon\n\nFifth Row Across\n\nAward Finalist, But Not Won:\n\nThe Doors of Eden by Adrian Tchaikovsky- finalist for the BSFA award 2021, didn’t win. I know this is now my third book by this author but until I find better choices for these prompts, this will be my choice.\n\nBIPOC Author:\n\nA Snake Falls to Earth by Darcie Little Badger.\n\nShapeshifters:\n\nI still have no book for this prompt but I often come across shifters in my fantasy books. I would recommend here The Tiger and the Wolf (Echoes of the Fall #1) by Adrian Tchaikovsky since it also has shifters.\n\nNo Ifs, Ands, or Buts: It’s difficult to find a title that does not include the following words: the, a/an, and, or, if, of, but. More Than Human by Theodore Sturgeon did the trick though.\n\nFamily Matters: I can’t think of any SFF book for this prompt at the moment so I hope to come across it as I read my books this year. As a no SFF book I could think of The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield but yet again, even if I read this book, it would not fit as a final choice.\n\nI hope though that I could inspire you to participate in this challenge even if in a low key way like me.\n\nI participated in this challenge in a low key way in 2021. More information about this challenge can be found here.\n\nHere is the 2021 r/Fantasy Bingo Card made by u/eriophora.\n\nBINGO CARD\n\nFirst Row Across:\n\n✔️Five SFF Short Stories\n\nI did this one hard mode. I read The Midnight Circus by Jane Yolen with an introduction by Theodora Goss.\n\nRating: 5 stars! A book with beautiful prose, some of the stories were extremely sad and heart breaking, but the exquisite writing style made me not able to put this short story collection down. The stories were original and heartfelt, I want to read more books by this author in the future. I recommend this anthology if you like fairy tales with a modern, original twist. This author and Theodora Goss are especially talented for fantasy with mythical themes.\n\nThanks to NetGalley and the publisher for giving me an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\n✔️Set in Asia\n\nI read Jade City (The Green Bone Saga #1) by Fonda Lee\n\nRating: 2 stars.\n\nThis book reminds me of The Gilded Wolves by Roshani Chokshi where the world was interesting and there were loads of action but I had difficulty caring enough to go on reading even though.\n\nI can’t explain why really… I continued this book but I won’t continue the series.\n\n✔️First Person POV\n\nI read The Black Witch (The Black Witch Chronicles #1) by Laurie Forest.\n\nRating: 3 stars.\n\nFantasy with a very interesting world and powerful themes.\n\n*Spoiler alert: The only thing I didn’t like is how slow the plot moves for the main character, the story feels stretched with so many side characters storylines. I do care about the side characters but each of them gets a subplot full of new questions of their own and it becomes too much altogether.\n\n*End of Spoiler\n\nEven though, I’ll continue this series.\n\nSecond Row Across:\n\n✔️Book Club OR Readalong Book\n\nBrown Girl in the Ring by Nalo Hopkinson\n\nRating: 4 stars. I liked the dialect, the characters (especially Mami) and the plot. It was a fast, original read and I could not put it down.\n\n✔️New to You Author\n\nI haven’t heard anything about this author before deciding to pick up this book, so I think this qualifies for hard mode.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with Moon of the Crusted Snow by Waubgeshig Rice. Rating: 4,5 stars. This was a very beautiful book that I wanted to take my time and hear slowly. I wish it had been longer. I’ll keep an eye for more books by this great author.\n\n✔️Gothic Fantasy\n\nThe Witch of Willow Hall by Hester Fox\n\nRating: 4 stars.\n\nVery atmospheric, and with gothic elements quite present in the plot. I liked all the characters,\n\nspoiler alert\n\neven if all of them were really unnerving either by being toxic, quite messed up or way too passive/slow to act and very emotional and dramatic at the same time. end of spoiler\n\nI could not put it down.\n\n✔️Backlist Book\n\nThe Well of Ascension (The Mistborn Saga #2) by Brandon Sanderson\n\nRating: 4 stars.\n\nI liked this book but I think that some great concepts had to be more fleshed out. Most of the creatures are very much only monsters with details so disgusting that you don’t want to hear much about them.\n\nI missed the fleshing out that the non-human sentient beings have in Stormlight and that make them beings with a culture and objectives of their own, not only monsters to be killed because they are bent on wrathful destruction all the time. The whole idea of “non-human creatures are evil and we have to kill them all so we survive” is not the best kind of story. It might work in a middle grade book, but I expect more from Sanderson after Stormlight, therefore this doesn’t get five stars.\n\nZane was also a very promising character but he doesn’t get the fleshing out he deserved so the reader would understand better what was happening to him and what of that was connected to the Cosmere, you can mostly draw your own conclusions and wonder about the story behind it. An idea would be a Novella about Zane’s journey to the extremely powerful Mistborn he became, he would be the perfect unreliable narrator.\n\nA very entertaining book, but the Stormlight series, with its fleshed out characters, non-human sentient beings, and world is still my favorite.\n\nThird Row Across:\n\n✔️Mystery Plot\n\nUntamed Shore by Silvia Moreno-Garcia\n\nRating: 5 stars!\n\nThis hidden gem is not talked and hyped enough, the story is full of edge-of-your-seat tension, many layered characters and the best writing ever.\n\nI could not put this down!\n\n✔️Comfort Read\n\nDiamonds and Daggers (Vampire Knitting Club #11) by Nancy Warren.\n\nRating: 4 stars. Again a very entertaining mystery with paranormal fantasy elements. This whole series was my main comfort read in 2021.\n\n✔️Published in 2021\n\nReDawn (Skyward #2.2) by Brandon Sanderson, Janci Patterson\n\nRating: 5 stars!\n\nThis packs a punch! I don’t want to say much because Novellas are so easy to spoil but all Skyward Flight Novellas are a wonderful addition to the series.\n\nFourth Row Across:\n\n✔️Latinx or Latin American Author\n\nMy chosen book has only 571 ratings at the moment which it’s a pity since this series does deserve more eyes on it.\n\nPrime Deceptions (Chilling Effect #2) by Valerie Valdes\n\nRating: 5 stars!\n\nWith a plot that goes, happens and explodes and funny, relatable characters, this was a very entertaining sequel. The Spanish expressions are as extremely funny to hear on the Audiobook as they were to read on the book. And it even has a Portuguese dialogue, we always need more of that. I need more books in this series too! Thankfully the next book in the series will come out now in 2022.\n\n✔️Genre Mashup\n\nThe Boundless (The Deathless Trilogy #3) by Peter Newman. Rating: 5 stars!\n\nI would say that this series is fantasy with horror elements. This third and final book was awesome and beautifully epic in so many ways. The characters are rarely done in such relatable ways and I really liked how this story wrapped up. One of the best fantasy series I ever read!\n\nFifth Row Across:\n\n✔️Trans or Nonbinary Character\n\nThe Vela (The Vela #1) by Yoon Ha Lee, Becky Chambers, Rivers Solomon, S.L. Huang.\n\nRating: 5 stars! This serial has four things I really liked:\n\n1) Great writers collaborating in a cohesive and well done narrative,\n\n2) Well done, many layered, characters,\n\n3) A surprising and fast paced plot that never gets boring and\n\n4) Food for thought of extreme, utmost importance. Many of the questions this story asks could be translated to our current world situation and how we handle world problems like refugees and climate change.\n\nThis serial packs a punch. I liked how it made me think about a lot of important things and I recommend it to anyone who wants to get out of their comfort zone while reading a very entertaining science fiction story with fast paced action. Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for giving me an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\n✔️Debut Author\n\nMachinehood by S.B. Divya\n\nRating: 3 stars.\n\nThis had a very good premise and ideas but the narrative style wasn’t unfortunately for me. I would recommend this to people who like science fiction technological thrillers and are OK with a narrative in Michael Crichton’s style.\n\nThanks to Netgalley and the publisher for giving me an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\nI will again be participating in a low key way in next year’s challenge.\n\nIn April 2019 I was planning to post quarterly updates on this challenge, but after my first quarterly update in June 2019, I completely forgot about it. Anyway, now that the Bingo Challenge is finished , I decided to post this complete Wrap-up because late is better than never… Therefore, here is my final Wrap-up on this yearly challenge created by Lisa from WayTooFantasy\n\nLike the last time I participated in 2018, I did not complete the 25 reading prompts for all bingo squares, since what happens is that I often read more than one book for the same prompt, and tend to procrastinate on a couple of prompts.\n\nThis time only three prompts weren’t completed, and they were:\n\n1)Self Published SFF Novel\n\n2)SFF Novel by an Australian Author and\n\n3)Lit RPG\n\nbut that doesn’t really matter much, since I’ll eventually get to read the books I had planned for them and post the review here on the blog. I might even swap one of the squares of the new bingo card for one of these last years’s squares, let’s see.\n\nLastly, to make this post shorter, I won’t repeat the reviews from my June update here, so please take a look in that post for the books where a link to the June quarterly update is provided.\n\nRow 1\n\nSlice of Life / Small Scale Fantasy\n\nI was setting aside the book I chose for this prompt, The Scorpio Races by Maggie Stiefvater after a few pages. I can’t really explain what happened and I’ll eventually pick up this book again to give it a second chance. Instead, I read Strange the Dreamer (Strange the Dreamer #1) by Laini Taylor.\n\nRating: 3 stars. This took long to unfold. It wasn’t so bad that I DNFed it but it was slow, really slow. It had the flaw of a couple of books I read recently, too much play-by-play, repetitions, and the pace drags. If 100 or more pages of filler had been cut out of it, it would have been a five star book.\n\nA SFF Novel Featuring a Character With a Disability\n\nPlanetfall (Planetfall #1) by Emma Newman\n\nRating: 4 stars. This was a very suspenseful, and character-driven science fiction.\n\nSFF Novella\n\nEnvy of Angels (Sin du Jour #1) by Matt Wallace June. Please see my June 2019 Post with my first quarterly reviews.\n\nWitches of Lychford (Lychford #1) by Paul Cornell\n\nRating 4 stars: This was a novella that could have been easily a novel, but perhaps the other books in the series will flesh out the very interesting characters a bit more. I heard this as part of the Tor.com collection Audiobook and the narrator was good too.\n\nThe Builders by Daniel Polansky\n\nRating 3 stars: This was very well written. With as much action and violence as a Quentin Tarantino movie and very interesting characters. Not exactly for me, but I could imagine fans of stories full of action enjoying it.\n\nNovel Featuring Twins\n\nI was reading The Black Tides of Heaven (Tensorate, #1) by J.Y. Yang for this bingo square and my review is in the June 2019 Post\n\nRow 2\n\nNovel Featuring Vampires\n\nDead Until Dark (Sookie Stackhouse #1) by Charlaine Harris June\n\nJune 2019 Post\n\nTantalize (Tantalize #1) by Cynthia Leitich Smith\n\nThis was an entertaining, page-turner, first book of a series. Only the end was a bit rushed up.\n\nOn a second note, the end if this book was quite tragic too. To me the MC and her caretaker uncle seemed to be emotionally lost people. Especially the main character was a very lonely teen without proper guidance and support from anyone in her life, so she just started to lean on the seductive new chef which was slowly turning her into a vampire.\n\nThis fictional thing could be compared to real life problems of teen girls who get drug addicted or too attached to bad people due to lack of parental support.\n\nI considered the end tragic for this reason, but I was intrigued by the plot thematic layers that turned a girl becoming a vampire not to a romantic thing, as many other YA books, but rather to a Machiavellian murder.\n\nFormat: Graphic Novel (at least 1 vol.) OR Audiobook / Audio drama\n\nAudiobook: We Are Legion (We Are Bob) (Bobiverse #1) by Dennis E. Taylor (Author), Ray Porter (Narrator)\n\nJune 2019 Post\n\nI was hearing more Audiobooks last year. My plan is to make a blog post only featuring Audiobooks in the near future.\n\nGraphic Novel: The Wicked + The Divine (Single Issues) by Kieron Gillen, Jamie McKelvie (Cover Art), Matt Wilson\n\nRating: 3,5 stars. I read most of the 45 single issues of this graphic novel. This was an entertaining, page-turner graphic novel that I could not put down, even if now and then things were not so well explained, or fleshed out.\n\nSFF Novel by a Local to You Author\n\nDream a little dream (Silber #1) by Kerstin Gier\n\nRating: 4 stars. This was an entertaining page-turner, and a light, humorous book. I’ll be reading the next in the series for sure.\n\nSFF Novel Featuring an Ocean Setting\n\nEvermore (Everless #2) by Sara Holland\n\nRating: 3 stars. Beautifully written even if slow-paced. The ending was nicely wrapped-up too.\n\nCyberpunk\n\nAltered Carbon (Takeshi Kovacs #1) by Richard K. Morgan\n\nJune 2019 Post\n\nRow 3\n\n2nd Chance\n\nI chose Shadow of the Fox (Shadow of the Fox #1) by Julie Kagawa for this prompt because this was a second chance I was giving to books by this author after not really enjoying her Iron King series. I set this aside after a few pages. Call me heartless, but I don’t really like when the MC is a victim who has no resources against her oppressors. I think that this type of story might work better with a younger audience, so I’m probably not the target audience for her books.\n\nAfrofuturism\n\nThe Book of Phoenix (Who Fears Death #0.5) by Nnedi Okorafor\n\nRating: 3,5 stars. I’m not really sure about how to review this book. It was very original, but its pacing was all over the place, sometimes dragging, sometimes rushed up.\n\nSFF Novel Published in 2019\n\nThe Gilded Wolves (The Gilded Wolves #1) by Roshani Chokshi\n\nRating: 3,5 stars. Kind of the same uncertainty on this review. I liked the characters in this book a lot, but perhaps I’m the wrong audience for too much action? This isn’t the first time a book full of action made me tired of it.\n\nMiddle Grade SFF Novel\n\nThe Cavendish Home for Boys and Girls by Claire Legrand (Author), Sarah Watts (Illustrator)\n\nRating: 2 stars. This was interesting, not much is explained and I’m not sure I would read this for young kids. (It seemed more directed towards young adults than middle-grade.)\n\nA Personal Recommendation from r/fantasy\n\nI read two books for this prompt. Elantris and The Emperor’s Soul, a Novella, by Brandon Sanderson. Both were 5 stars reads for me, since I really enjoy this author’s books and plan to read more on them in the future.\n\nRow 4\n\nAny r/fantasy Book Club Book of the Month OR r/fantasy Read-along Book\n\nFoundryside (Founders #1) by Robert Jackson Bennett\n\nRating: 3 stars. This was long and full of action. I somehow could not really get immersed in this book.\n\nMedia Tie-In Novel\n\nI read three books that fit this prompt, and the reviews are in my June blog post.\n\n1)Children of the Nameless (Magic:The Gathering) by Brandon Sanderson\n\n2)Mortal Engines (Mortal Engines Quartet #1) by Philip Reeve\n\n3) The Circle by Dave Eggers\n\nNovel Featuring an AI Character\n\nSilently and Very Fast by Catherynne M. Valente.\n\nRating: 4 stars. This novella’s writing style was towards stream of consciousness, and this was in any case food-for-thought.\n\nSFF Novel That Has a Title of Four or More Words\n\nAn Unkindness of Magicians (An Unkindness of Magicians #1) by Kat Howard – June blog post.\n\nA Memory Called Empire (Teixcalaan #1) by Arkady Martine\n\nAudiobook Rating: 5 stars. It did take me a while to hear this because I didn’t want to loose any detail of this book full of political intrigue and twists. I will be following this series for sure. The Audiobook narration, by Amy Landon, was five stars too.\n\nRetelling!\n\nI set aside my first choice for this prompt, which was Deathless (Leningrad Diptych #1) by Catherynne M. Valente, because I didn’t feel immersed enough in the story and I didn’t want to repeat authors in the reading prompts. So, instead I read:\n\nThe Dark Descent of Elizabeth Frankenstein by Kiersten White\n\nAudiobook Rating: 5 stars. A magnificent retelling of Frankenstein, and the Audiobook Performance of Katharine McEwan was five stars too.\n\nRow 5\n\nThe Final Book of a Series\n\nMagic Triumphs (Kate Daniels #10) by Ilona Andrews\n\nRating: 5 stars. This was amazing, a great final book for this awesome series. I could not put it down.\n\n#OwnVoices\n\nTrail of Lightning (The Sixth World #1) by Rebecca Roanhorse.\n\nRating: 4 stars. This was very interesting, I don’t consider it YA due to the amount of violence tough. The heroine is not at first sight likable, mainly because I have not seen enough layers to understand her well enough but I hope that the next book in the series shows more of her journey. The love interests are also shown superficially, but hopefully I’ll get deeper arcs in the next book too. Since the character’s presentations mainly skipped the surface in this first book, I hope we get deeper developments in the next book of the series.\n\nI’ll give it 4 and not 5 stars due to the reasons I already stated and because I missed more depth in the story world, a lot of things I would have gladly know more about went unexplained or were shown in a superficial way. The plot also moved in all directions, as if the story was starting anew at every chapter.\n\nPerhaps my impressions of the story world were like this because I am not familiar with Native American Culture. I would have gladly read a glossary with explanations about the Native American cultural references used in the story.\n\nIn any case, this book was a very original page-turner that I could not put down.\n\nFive SFF Short Stories\n\nNow in 2020, I am making a Short-Story Challenge where I plan to read at least 52 short stories from different anthologies/collections. And the resulting Wrap-up blog will be posted in December this year.\n\nThe Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964 (Science Fiction Hall of Fame #1).\n\nThis anthology has been a mixed bag for me so far.\n\nA couple of stories were awesome and extremely original, and a few had lines filled up with misogyny. I don’t enjoy reading such stuff at all, and my tolerance for an author’s horrible attitude towards women is really low, to the point that more than one book with that kind of flaw by the same author is reason enough for me to avoid the works of such author in the future.\n\nI am even tough planning to read the whole anthology and take note of the authors who positively impress me to read more by them in the near future.\n\n5 Stories:\n\nNightfall • (1941) • novelette by Isaac Asimov – 5 stars! Isaac Asimov shows again why he is one of my favorite authors!\n\nThe Weapon Shop • [Weapon Shops of Isher] • (1942) • novelette by A. E. van Vogt– I didn’t like this so much due to a couple of misogynistic lines.\n\nMimsy Were the Borogoves • (1943) • novelette by Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore [as by Lewis Padgett ] –Very interesting story- 5 stars!\n\nHuddling Place • [City] • (1944) • shortstory by Clifford D. Simak\n\nDon’t get to attached to your comfort zone…\n\nArena • (1944) • novelette by Fredric Brown – There is an episode of Star Trek that reminds me of this story a lot.\n\nI’ll soon post a TBR for the R/Fantasy Bingo Challenge of 2020. Stay Tuned!\n\nIn the picture above:\n\nTitles in blue: Books I read for that square prompt, and included a mini-review here.\n\nTitles in black: The books I chose for the challenge prompts and haven’t read yet.\n\nThis year I started the R/fantasy 2019 Bingo challenge with enthusiasm and already read books for seven of the prompts in the bingo card.\n\nI decided to post the Bingo Challenge Wrap-Ups (with the mini-reviews on the finished prompts) quarterly, instead of writing a long, with 25 books or more, Wrap-Up in April 2020.\n\nSo here is my TBR with the finished prompts. If you are mainly interested in the mini-reviews and not so much on my planned TBR, just jump to where I put “(Done!)” before the prompt. I also put the already read book titles in bold. And a last warning, sometimes it was difficult to be completely spoiler free on my review, so if you don’t want to know too much about the story, skip the parts with *spoiler alert*.\n\nSlice of Life / Small Scale Fantasy – The Scorpio Races by Maggie Stiefvater\n\nA SFF Novel Featuring a Character With a Disability– Planetfall-E.Newman\n\n(Done!) SFF Novella– Envy of Angels (Sin du Jour #1) by Matt Wallace\n\nRating 3 stars: This was very different and entertaining. The reasons I’m not giving it more stars is that for me, the plot didn’t have much structure, being a constant run of crazy and bizarre events on top of each other. For a novella, it also had many characters, to a point where I wasn’t following who was who and not caring much either because *spoiler alert* zombie clowns were attacking. I hope though that the next books of the series may deepen their story arcs.\n\nSelf-Published SFF Novel – It’s a though decision, since I have many writer friends. I will probably start five different books and read the one that I like best entirely. One I might try is Lady of the Veils by M.L. John.\n\n(Done!) SFF Novel Featuring Twins – The Black Tides of Heaven (Tensorate, #1) by J.Y. Yang Rating: 3 stars *spoiler alert*\n\nThis was the first book I read with the pronouns they and them for a character and I considered this new and interesting. The writing style though sounded almost like a fairy tale and now and then I felt that important things were told too quickly, like for example, *spoiler alert*, when one of the characters went to a mountain to get phoenix feathers and came back with them almost in the next phrase. I was so surprised that such a thing that could have been a book on its own was just thrown in like that.\n\n*spoiler alert* I also could not really connect with the main character as most of the time Akeha seemed to only react to what happened in the plot, the action being carried by other secondary characters that should have been main characters instead of him, since they were the ones who moved the plot. Even the so feared (for unexplained reasons btw) ‘Mother’ would have been a more interesting POV. The passive way how Akeha mainly reacted dragged the story so much I wished other character had been chosen to be the main POV of the book, because any other character would have done more. I considered the situation with the mother of the twins very superficially told, in a way I didn’t understand why everybody was so extremely afraid of facing her. This was the kind of book that could have been much improved from rewriting and more active POVs.\n\n(Done!) Novel Featuring Vampires – Dead Until Dark (Sookie Stackhouse #1) by Charlaine Harris– Rating: 3 stars\n\nThis was funny. *spoiler alert* The end was a bit rushed up and out of the blue, but I’ll probably go on reading this series.\n\n(Done!) Format: Graphic Novel (at least 1 vol.) OR Audiobook / Audio drama\n\nWe Are Legion (We Are Bob) (Bobiverse #1) by Dennis E. Taylor (Author), Ray Porter (Narrator) Format: Audiobook – I enjoyed this book a lot, it made me laugh and the writing style reminded me of The Martian by Andy Weir.\n\nI just wished that when authors would put Brazilians in a story, that they would use Brazilian names and not use Portuguese words (even curse words) out of context. Brazilians don’t use Mexican or Spanish curses.\n\nI’m not saying this because I’m upset about the role of the Brazilian ships in the story. I’m happy that Brazil was portrayed in this book as a powerful country. (I hope one day it gets there but definitely not as a military empire.)\n\nI will surely go on reading this funny and entertaining, page-turner series. The Audiobook performance of Ray Porter was five stars too.\n\nSFF Novel by a Local to You Author – Dream a little dream (Silber #1) – Kerstin Gier\n\nSFF Novel Featuring an Ocean Setting -The Priory of The Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon.\n\n(Done!) Cyberpunk – Altered Carbon (Takeshi Kovacs #1) by Richard K. Morgan\n\nRating: 2 stars. The story world/mystery was interesting and I really tried to like this, reading until around 30% of the book, but it wasn’t for me.\n\nI didn’t like the pacing, writing style, and the visceral/gory details didn’t help.\n\n2nd Chance– I’ll give a second chance to an author I didn’t like the previous books so much, so I might read the Shadow of the Fox (Shadow of the Fox #1) by Julie Kagawa for this prompt, even if the first books in the The Iron Fey series were three stars for me and I didn’t go on reading the series.\n\nAfrofuturism – Brown Girl in the Ring – Nalo Hopkinson.\n\nOne of my continuing goals is to read more POC Authors, so I intend to read not only this, but many other books of Afrofuturism. Probably still this year if I manage, so stay tunned. 😉\n\nSFF Novel Published in 2019 – The Gilded Wolves (The Gilded Wolves #1) by Roshani Chokshi\n\nMiddle Grade SFF Novel – The School for Good and Evil (The School for Good and Evil #1) by Soman Chainani\n\nA Personal Recommendation from r/Fantasy – The Cloud Roads (The Books of the Raksura #1) by Martha Wells\n\n(Done!) Any r/fantasy Book Club Book of the Month OR r/fantasy Read-along Book – Foundryside (Founders #1) by Robert Jackson Bennett\n\nThis is long and full of action. I could not really get immersed in this book so I’ll set it aside it for now and pick it up again eventually.\n\n(Done!) Media Tie-In Novel – I read three books that can fit this prompt!\n\n1)Children of the Nameless (Magic:The Gathering)by Brandon Sanderson\n\nRating: 5 Stars! This novella that Sanderson has written for Magic: The Gathering was awesomely well written. Brandon Sanderson is one of my favorite new authors!\n\n2)Mortal Engines (Mortal Engines Quartet #1) by Philip Reeve\n\nThis was one of the most interesting books I came across for a long time; with an extremely well built story world and every single one of the characters had many layers and something unique and special about them. The movie is on my asap list to watch.\n\n3) The Circle by Dave Eggers\n\nThis book, that warns about the dangers of Social Media, may seem exaggerated and therefore ridiculous, but is it really so exaggerated? I look at the world around me and don’t think it is.\n\nI see how a lot of people are looking at their smartphones for hours and hours, sending pictures of everything, nearly showing everyday reports of their lives. I receive messages of people upset because I was a couple of hours offline and didn’t send them an immediate answer, I do look around me and encounter similarities to the Circle world in an uncomfortable and unpleasant way. So I wonder how much the uncomfortable truths of this book can be dismissed.\n\nMy opinion is that the film based on this book had a *spoiler alert* very happy ending that seemed forced and not faithful to the tone and message of the book .\n\nNovel Featuring an AI Character– Silently and Very Fast by Catherynne M. Valente.\n\n(Done!) SFF Novel That Has a Title of Four or More Words\n\nAn Unkindness of Magicians (An Unkindness of Magicians #1) by Kat Howard – Rating: 5 stars!\n\nThis is a masterpiece, it has magic but even though it managed to have an extremely original plot of fantasy filled up with so many important themes and written in such an awesome style that I can’t believe it doesn’t has a higher rating and it isn’t all that hyped. Quality food-for-thought that everybody interested (or not) in stories with magic should read.\n\nI might still read A Memory Called Empire (Teixcalaan #1) by Arkady Martine for this prompt, in any case this book is on my asap radar.\n\nRetelling! – Deathless (Leningrad Diptych #1) by Catherynne M. Valente.\n\nSFF Novel by an Australian Author – Nevernight (The Nevernight Chronicle #1) by Jay Kristoff.\n\nThe Final Book of a Series– It will come up eventually, when I decide to follow up on a series. Lately I have had many reasons not to follow book series, but this will be the topic for one of my next blog posts.\n\n#OwnVoices – Trail of Lightning (The Sixth World #1) by Rebecca Roanhorse. I also want to read the anthology New Suns: Original Speculative Fiction by People of Color by Nisi Shawl for this prompt.\n\nLitRPG – Sufficiently Advanced Magic (Arcane Ascension #1) by Andrew Rowe. I didn’t manage to read this book last year so I want to do this in 2019. I am an ocean of good intentions, really. 😉\n\nFive SFF Short Stories – The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964 (Science Fiction Hall of Fame #1). (I love me old sci-fi tales from even before the time Spock was our most loved alien.)\n\nI am also hearing the anthology “Tor.com Collection: Season 1” so I’ll post all reviews when I have achieved this year’s goal of hearing and reading-a-ton (this sound funnily the same as Readathon) of these short stories/novellas.\n\nAnd you? Are you doing reading challenges this year or are you just picking up the next book on the shelf? Have you find any of my picks interesting ? Or not?\n\nLet me know in the comments.\n\nI must confess that at a certain point in the year I lost track of the Bingo Challenge and my reading went to other directions. I think that one of the reasons was that I wasn’t always lucky with my picks for the different prompts, so eventually I distanced myself and started prioritizing shorter Readathons with the idea that I still had enough time to finish the Bingo later, but April came and the last four remaining books to complete the card remained unread. I completed only one of the rows entirely, even if I managed to read four prompts in all five rows.\n\nSince I like no stress attached to my reading goals, I decided to post my final results in this Wrap-Up even though. And the unread books I chose for the last year’s challenge will be read, eventually. Not all books I chose for the challenge were for me, but I still liked going out of my favourite authors scope and trying new ones.\n\nIn addition, certain prompts were very interesting so I also read more than one book for them, I will be adding the additional books when I consider them special enough to mention.\n\n1st Row:\n\nNovel that was Reviewed on r/Fantasy\n\nI chose Nice Dragons Finish Last by (Heartstrikers #1) by Rachel Aaron for this challenge and even started reading it, but somehow got distracted by other books, so I still didn’t finish reading this.\n\nNovel Featuring a Non-Western Setting\n\nThe Killing Moon (Dreamblood #1) by N.K. Jemisin\n\nI liked this book even if I considered it quite slow-paced (even for epic fantasy). The relationships, magic system and world could have been much more fleshed out too. I’m yet in doubt whether I will go on reading this Duology or not.\n\nAdditional Book:\n\nThe City of Brass (The Daevabad Trilogy #1) by S.A. Chakraborty\n\nAwesome story world with Ifrits, Ghouls, Marids, Peri, Djinn and multi-layered characters. I’m following this series for sure.\n\nFive Short Stories\n\nI chose to read the anthology “The Djinn Falls in Love & Other Stories” by Mahvesh Murad (Editor)\n\nI set it aside after reading five stories, mainly because I expected mainly a fantasy anthology when I started reading this and, true, all stories there have fantastic elements, but apart from this they are a mixture of genres. Therefore, I’ll finish reading this when I feel like reading literary, slice-of-life, or magical realism short stories.\n\nNovel Adapted by Stage, Screen, or Game\n\nFor this prompt I read the whole trilogy of Ruby Red (Edelstein-Trilogie #1) by Kerstin Gier, Anthea Bell (Translator)\n\nKerstin Gier is my new favorite fantasy and young adult author even if I don’t read her books in their original language, German. I may try it though sometime with “Die Mütter-Mafia” books. The whole trilogy was told in a light and humorous way that makes it a real treat for a relaxing afternoon. I also like the tension created by the time-travel plot and multi-layered characters. This was an entertaining, page-turner trilogy. The Audiobooks, narrated by Marisa Calin, were also very good.\n\nHopeful Spec-Fic\n\nThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet (Wayfarers #1) by Becky Chambers\n\nThis was a different kind of science-fiction, quite enjoyable and focused on the characters and human interactions.\n\n2nd Row:\n\nFantasy Novel that Takes Place Entirely Within One City\n\nBeautiful Creatures (Beautiful Creatures #1) by Kami Garcia, Margaret Stohl.\n\nThis was entertaining, very romantic and full of magic atmosphere. I watched the film based on this book, and will eventually go on reading this series.\n\nSelf-Published Novel\n\nI had chosen Sufficiently Advanced Magic (Arcane Ascension #1) by Andrew Rowe for this, but unfortunately lost track of it. This remains in my TBR though.\n\nNovel Published Before You Were Born (1973, GenXer here!)\n\nThe Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester (first published 1955)\n\nThis book was a trip, you will want to jaunt yourself after reading it, LOL. Some allowances have to be made since this was written in the 50s, but I can fully understand why this is in a science fiction masterworks list. All the settings this book goes through, often in a disturbing, and very possible dystopian way, make it the revered classic that it is.\n\nAny r/Fantasy Goodreads Group Book of the Month\n\nAll Systems Red (The Murderbot Diaries #1) by Martha Wells.\n\nMurderbot is a very original character, you can see why this novella has won the 2018 Hugo Award. I’ll be following this series.\n\nNovel Featuring a Library\n\nThe Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins\n\nSometimes I read outside my favorite genres and with that I discover a great read. This wasn’t unfortunately the case here, but it could be due to Horror not really being a genre I enjoy. I started this book due to all good reviews on Booktube, but found it too confusing and at a certain point I stopped caring about the characters and plot and DNFed the book.\n\n3rd Row:\n\nSubgenre: Historical Fantasy OR Alternate History\n\nServant of the Underworld (Obsidian and Blood #1) by Aliette de Bodard\n\nI mainly picked up this book because it is extremely rare to find books with an Aztec setting. I liked the original world building/story elements in this book. I can imagine that for someone who likes the blend of mystery/historical fiction this is a four/five star read.\n\n** spoiler alert ** One of the reasons I rated it three stars is that for me alone the main character’s arc was very slow paced dragging the plot with it. I couldn’t understand why Acatl acted the way he did most times, always in doubt whether he should act, blending aloofness and insecurity with resourcefulness. It was part of the story, but it was also shocking how Acatl and others sacrificed animals all the time without a second thought on the waste and cruelty of their way of life, and how quickly they dismissed people’s deaths as every moment occurrence. I wonder if the Aztecs were really like that or if they were more like us, willingly ignorant of the brutality of our world most of the time? An original, thought-provoking and interesting read in any case.\n\nNovel Published in 2018\n\nFawkes by Nadine Brandes\n\nThis book was an entertaining page-turner. I liked especially the original characters, and the well-constructed fantasy world with historic background. I’ll be checking out the next books by this author.\n\nI would like to thank NetGalley and Thomas Nelson–FICTION for providing me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\nNovel Featuring a Protagonist Who is a Writer, Artist or Musician (NOT: Kingkiller Chronicles)\n\nWintersong (Wintersong #1) by S. Jae-Jones\n\nWere it for the writing style and the original premise and setting alone I would have given this book five stars, but the main relationship in this book is so… ** spoiler alert ** I’m not really sure of how to finish this phrase, perhaps: “hopeless-through-the-whole- book-until-the-end-when-I-was-happy-that-it-was-finished”?\n\nI’m tired of stories were the heroine is unnaturally and endlessly humble, selfless and self-sacrificing and the (anti) ‘hero’ is cruel, blase, cold and treats other women badly because supposedly they were not as great as the heroine is.\n\nPerhaps this is how fairy tales are supposed to be, but to me it feels really outdated and even unfair as gender roles go? I’m tired of the trope of “there isn’t a bad man, only a man who has not found the perfect woman to change him for the better,” because for teenage girls this is not the best thing to believe in. Perhaps the purpose of the story was to show that the heroine was better off without that troublesome relationship, but it didn’t feel as if she made the decision of finishing the relationship herself. No, she was freed by the cruel ‘hero’ because ‘she was better than the other girls.’\n\nI cringed every time Liesl said ‘Mein Herr’ to her husband, always so subservient and meek. Again, this was only another of the story elements but it made everything sound so old fashioned. True, the Goblin King helped her to grow up enough to express her music, but did she really need him to become a composer or to be happy at all? Perhaps the next book in the series will answer this question\n\nNovel Featuring a Mountain Setting\n\nA Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses #3.1) by Sarah J. Maas.\n\nIt’s with the same characters from the trilogy, that I liked well enough to reread, but extremely little really happens. I hope the next books have more plot to them.\n\nMy pet-peeve with novellas is that they are mostly too short to introduce as many new and interesting things as a novel, and this one felt like a long epilogue of the third book. I would rather have a spin-off based on any other character than the main ones, or a collection of different POVs from side characters.\n\n2017 r/Fantasy Top Novels List\n\nThe Goblin Emperor (The Goblin Emperor #1) by Katherine Addison.\n\nThis is so hyped but I can’t see what’s that all about…\n\nThe story reminds me of “The Queen of the Tearling” by Erika Johansen. However, the stakes, the tension and the action of the mentioned book aren’t present at all. The main character has a lot of time to think, meditate and complain about life… I’ve already read 110 pages and not much happened. I don’t manage to care enough to read everything. This book isn’t for me.\n\n4th Row:\n\nNovel with Fewer than 2500 Goodreads Ratings\n\nBlood of Wonderland (Queen of Hearts Saga #2) by Colleen Oakes.\n\nI expected more from this sequel after enjoying the first book so much. It felt flat and rushed up, I was just wondering why characters were acting into certain directions, it felt forced with the main character, Cheshire and Wardley.\n\nThe story world just went by, interesting but not being really explored in detail, although this seems to happen often in YA.\n\nNovel with a One Word Title\n\nArmada by Ernest Cline.\n\nI liked this even if I still prefer “Ready Player One” by this author. I would love a next book where Zack Lightman would meet the aliens and try to find out what they are plotting 😉\n\nNovel Featuring a God as a Character\n\nI chose The Curse of Chalion (World of the Five Gods #1) by Lois McMaster Bujold for this prompt, but haven’t read it yet. However, all Bujold books are on my TBR!\n\nNovel by an Author Writing Under a Pseudonym.\n\nLeviathan Wakes (The Expanse #1) by James S.A. Corey\n\nI started this but stopped because I could not bring myself to go on reading. I’ll perhaps pick this one later again, right now I find it too slow-paced and I don’t fell like committing to a very long series when the first book isn’t for me.The world is interesting though and it left me curious enough to watch the first season episodes based on the books. **spoiler alert** Sigh… I’m really tired of zombies whether they come from ice or space, and I think they spoil every story they appear in. To me zombies always seem like a cheap and cliché plot device to add action to a plot the author has no other stakes for.\n\nSubgenre: Space Opera\n\nThe Empress (The Diabolic #2) by S.J. Kincaid\n\nI’m in doubt how to rate this book, it was quite original and full of really unexpected plot twists. I wonder how the story is going to continue and can’t wait for the next book.\n\nAudiobook: The reading of Candace Thaxton was as five stars good as in the first book.\n\n5th Row:\n\nStand Alone Fantasy Novel\n\nThe Coldest Girl in Coldtown by Holly Black.\n\nThis was an original take on vampire stories and the world building was awesome.\n\nI found it somehow slow paced and thought that a couple of flashbacks were placed too late in the story, but I was happy to find similarities between this book and The Cruel Prince.\n\nThis book should be getting a sequel.\n\nNovel by a RAWRR Author OR Keeping Up With the Classics\n\nI chose The Black Company (The Chronicles of the Black Company #1) by Glen Cook but couldn’t get to it.\n\nNovel from the r/Fantasy LGBTQ+ Database\n\nCrooked Kingdom (Six of Crows #2) by Leigh Bardugo.\n\nI liked more this sequel than the first book in the Duology due to all the feels and the depth of the character stories.\n\nAdditional Book:\n\nChina Mountain Zhang by Maureen F. McHugh\n\nThis was very well written, a literary, slice-of-life, dystopia. At the beginning I thought Zhang aloof and could not relate to him, but as the story progressed I understood that it isn’t easy to survive in a world that condemns most things about you. I considered the chapters with the other characters really great too and loved the story set in Mars.\n\nA beautiful book, to be read without hurry, as the awesome food-for-thought about human condition that it is.\n\nFormat: Graphic Novel (at least 1 vol.) OR Audiobook\n\nPaper Girls, Vol. 1 (Paper Girls #1- #4)\n\n#1- I like it but the story is all over the place. I’ll go on reading and see where is going.\n\n#4- Finally we start to get some answers after three volumes of saying “Um, what just happened” like one of the robots in the series and we go on reading this page turner.\n\nAdditional Graphic Novels:\n\nBitch Planet, Vol. 1: Extraordinary Machine – (Bitch Planet (Collected Editions) #1) by Kelly Sue DeConnick (Goodreads Author) (Writer), Taki Soma (Illustrator), Valentine De Landro (Artist), Robert Wilson IV (Artist)\n\nThis is awesome, I would recommend it to anyone, especially with how politics is going nowadays in the world.\n\nBitch Planet, Vol. 2: President Bitch (Bitch Planet (Collected Editions) #2) by Kelly Sue DeConnick (Goodreads Author) (writer), Taki Soma (artist), Valentine De Landro (artist). – This is awesome and everybody should read it. 😉\n\nNovel Featuring the Fae\n\nAn Enchantment of Ravens by Margaret Rogerson\n\nThis book has nice descriptions, a really nice cover, premise, and so much hype that I was completely underwhelmed by it.\n\nIt could have been better but the pace was terribly slow and at a certain point I wasn’t caring anymore about the story or the characters. I dropped it on several occasions because nothing interesting was happening. Even the romance was insta-love, and it also dragged. For me this was only an over hyped book where the hype had not real reasons to be there.\n\nAnd you, do you agree/disagree with my opinions on the books I picked? And have you already committed to a year-long reading challenge?"
