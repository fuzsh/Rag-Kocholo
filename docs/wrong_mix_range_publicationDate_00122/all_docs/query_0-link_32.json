        "text": "It’s Wednesday, so that means it’s time for another weird fiction discussion to begin over at LibraryThing.\n\nReview: “The Adventure of the Death-Fetch”, Darrell Schweitzer, 1994.\n\nYou don’t have to try very hard, if you read fantastic fiction, to find Sherlock Holmes stories which go beyond Arthur Conan Doyle’s rational framework for the character. I’ve already done posts on three such works.\n\nThis one is, kind of, barely, also a kind of a Cthulhu Mythos story.\n\nThis is a twice-told Sherlock Holmes story.\n\nOur narrator is a 19-year old college student visiting relatives in England over Christmas break. The relatives know Dr. John Watson, and he’s staying with them.\n\nOne night, a few days before his death, Watson tells just the narrator a story. It’s a Sherlock Holmes case never documented. That’s because Holmes made Watson promise, on pain of their friendship, that he would never write it down.\n\nMany Christmases ago, around the turn of the twentieth century, a Miss Abigail Thurston runs up to Holmes in the street to ask for help. Her father has bolted himself in his room and won’t come out. He also keeps an elephant gun nearby and has smashed all the mirror in his room.\n\nHer father is none other than famed explorer Sir Humphrey Thurston.\n\nHolmes agrees to make a call on Sir Humphrey with Miss Thurston and Watson.\n\nOn the way over, they see Thurston on the street, and Holmes gives chase but loses him.\n\nWhen they visit Thurston, he confirms he has not been out of the room. He’s also dressed differently than the man on the street.\n\nHe gives us the true account of his earlier life before he married and became a famous explorer: desertion from the British Indian Army, travels in Asia and Australia, murder and robbery. Finally, he fell in with Hawkins, a man who fancied himself the reincarnation of pirate Edward Teach. He was on the search for a treasure, a winged dog made of jade, on the Plains of Leng. He needs Thurston to read an old Burmese map to find the treasure. Through hardship and murder most of the expedition dies.\n\nDespite the mention of Leng, there are no further Lovecraftian elements unless you want to consider the dog as somehow being a Hound of Tindalos.\n\nAnyway, Thurston managed, through guile, to escape Hawkins and thought Hawkins died but now he thinks Hawkins is back. He’s received letters from something like Hawkins – a corpse animated by the priests of Leng, skin flayed from his face, his heart ripped out and a inextinguishable fire put in his hollowed out chest. (Presumably this is communicated through the letters since Hawkins and Thurston have not yet reunited.)\n\nThurston rightly thinks a death fetch, a figure identical to him, is coming to kill him. He saw it in mirrors before he removed them from the room.\n\nHolmes won’t admit to the possibility of anything supernatural even though the earlier sighting of someone looking like Thurston on the street is consistent with Thurston’s account.\n\nThe death-fetch shows up and does kill Thurston, moments after his daughter and Holmes and Watson leave the room. Near Thurston’s body is the jade idol he spoke of looking for in Leng.\n\nThe story ends with the college student narrator receiving the dog idol in the mail back in America.\n\nThe story nicely undercuts expectations. Holmes exhibits no occult knowledge. He does not defeat a supernatural menace. Holmes realizes he cannot – and will not – operate in the supernatural realm thus his very firm admonition to Watson – on pain of ending their friendship – that the matter be suppressed.\n\nThere is one amusing reference to Indiana Jones too."
