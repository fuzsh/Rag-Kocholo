With his renoved and reformer vision of the sciencephilosophy, as this one was originally expressed by the Greeks, Nicol confronted the radical crisis that beat to the thought, understood as a free vocation, under the pressure of the modern utilitarism and his current culmination in the imperalism of the technocracy.En 2007 se conmemora el centenario de Eduardo Nicol, uno de los filÃ³sofos de lengua espaÃ±ola mÃ¡s sobresalientes de las Ãºltimas dÃ©cadas. Con su renovada y reformadora visiÃ³n de la ciencia-filosofÃ­a, tal y como Ã©sta fue originariamente expresada por los griegos, Nicol afrontÃ³ la crisis radical por la que atraviesa el pensar, entendido como una vocaciÃ³n libre, bajo la presiÃ³n del utilitarismo moderno y su culminaciÃ³n actual en el imperalismo de la tecnocracia.\n\nJosÃ© NicolÃ¡s de Azara : un icono del Grand Tour\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJorge GarcÃ­a SÃ¡nchez\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFull Text Available JosÃ© NicolÃ¡s de Azara, bien conocido como Agente de Preces y ministro plenipotenciario ante la Santa Sede, fue tal vez la personalidad espaÃ±ola de mayor influencia en los cÃ­rculos intelectuales y artÃ­sticos de la Roma del siglo XVIII. Su asumida funciÃ³n de guÃ­a ilustrado y su vocaciÃ³n pedagÃ³gica para con los jÃ³venes viajeros lo convirtieron en un autÃ©ntico icono del Grand Tour.JosÃ© NicolÃ¡s de Azara, well known as Agente de Preces (Agent of Supplications and ministro plenipotenciario (Plenipotentiary Minister in the Holy See, was perhaps the most influential Spanish personality in the intellectual and artistic circles of Eighteenth-Century Rome. His wilful function of enlightened guide and his pedagogic attitude towards the young travellers made of him an authentic icon of the Grand Tour.\n\nLe Â«Â commerce dâamour-propreÂ Â» selon Pierre Nicole\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDominique Weber\n\n2007-04-01\n\nFull Text Available La notion de Â«Â commerce dâamour-propreÂ Â» telle quâelle a Ã©tÃ© Ã©laborÃ©e par Pierre Nicole constitue-t-elle une sorte de prÃ©figuration de lâutilitarisme moderneÂ ? Il est commun de le penser. Mais câest peut-Ãªtre lÃ faire trop peu de cas du soubassement thÃ©ologique augustinien de la doctrine de Nicole. Pour analyser le problÃ¨me, il convient de confronter la pensÃ©e de Nicole Ã celles de Pascal, de Hobbes et de saint Augustin lui-mÃªme.\n\nMultiple Sclerosis, Personal Stories | NIH MedlinePlus the Magazine\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n... of this page please turn Javascript on.

It has topological soliton solutions classified by the integer-valued Hopf charge, and all currently known solitons are axially symmetric. A volume-preserving flow is used to construct soliton solutions numerically for all Hopf charges from 1 to 8. It is found that the known axially symmetric solutions are unstable for Hopf charges greater than 2 and new lower energy solutions are obtained that include knots and links. A comparison with the Skyrme-Faddeev model suggests many universal features, though there are some differences in the link types obtained in the two theories.\n\nInfluencia del Pseudo Dionisio en NicolÃ¡s de Cusa\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAndrÃ©s Hubert R\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull Text Available NicolÃ¡s de Cusa (1401-1464 reconoce la influencia del Pseudo Dionisio en su propio pensamiento, especialmente en su teologÃ­a negativa. Este trabajo busca mostrar esta influencia en el libro referencia del Cusano: el De Docta Ignorantia (la Docta Ignorancia. Esta obra consta de 3 partes. Solo en la primera parte, NicolÃ¡s sigue de cerca las ideas del Pseudo Dionisio y solo en ella lo cita. En las demÃ¡s, aunque se nota la influencia, nuestro autor se siente mÃ¡s libre: las fundaciones estÃ¡n firmes, el constructor puede construir libremente. Para probar esta tesis, se toman dos ejemplos: el tema de las tinieblas y la coincidencia de los opuestos. Este ejercicio permite conocer cÃ³mo y por quÃ© se recibiÃ³ al Pseudo Dionisio en la historia de la teologÃ­a. Permite tambiÃ©n profundizar el sentido de la teologÃ­a de NicolÃ¡s de CusaThe reflections of Nicolas of Cusa (1401-1464 recognise the influence of Pseudo Dyonisius, particularly in his negative theology. The present study shows this influence on Nicolas' most important book: the De Docta Ignorantia (the Learned Ignorance. The book is divided into three parts and it is in the first part that Nicolas directly pursues the ideas of Pseudo Dyonisius and it is only here that he quotes them. In the other parts of the book although the influence is noted, the foundations have been set and are solid and the author or builder can construct with freedom. To prove this thesis, 2 examples are presented: the theme of darkness and the coincidence of opposites. This exercise shows how and why Pseudo Dyonisius has been accepted into the history of the theology. It also deepens the meaning of the Nicolas of Cusa's theology\n\nIn Memoriam: Dr. Frank John Fenner\n\nCenters for Disease Control (CDC) Podcasts\n\nThis podcast reflects on one of the greatest pioneers in virology, Dr. Frank John Fenner.

A reply to Nicole Gerrand.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMerle, J C\n\n2000-01-01\n\nNicole Gerrand is right to criticize Munzer for not connecting a person's dignity to the \"capacity to exhibit humanity by acting rationally.\" However, connecting these does not mean that they are one and the same concept. Gerrand fails to make two distinctions that are decisive in the context of Kant's ethics. First, she does not distinguish between vital organs, integral organs and mere \"accumulations\", each of which requires a specific moral argument. Second, she does not distinguish between human rational nature in itself, or the capacity to have free will, and the possibility of action rationally, or freedom of choice. Having drawn these distinctions, I argue that Kant's own principles fully allow certain kinds of organ transplants such as blood, skin and marrow transplants from living bodies as well as the transplantation of both vital organs and essential organs from fresh corpses. In fact, Kant's own moral principles should make of these an enforceable duty of right. Unlike Gerrand, then, I think that the question of whether or not donors should be paid--and the patient should pay--is a key issue even in a Kantian context.\n\nLos avatares de la biblioteca privada de NicolÃ¡s Antonio (1687-1690\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLuis ARIAS GONZÃLEZ\n\n2009-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Cuando fallece en Madrid NicolÃ¡s Antonio, el aÃ±o de 1684, toda la fortuna que deja a sus herederos, son deudas; deudas a las que fundamentalmente le habÃ­a llevado el afÃ¡n investigador y publicista al que dedicÃ³ su vida entera.

With his passing, the motivation community has lost a seminal member, a mentor, and a friend. Dr. Lens â a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and Founding Fellow of the American Educational Research Association â made fundamental contributions to the study of motivation both through his own work and through his caring and thoughtful mentorship of a large community of scholars. With this tribute, we want to honor Dr. Willy Lensâ significance to psychology and education as well as his positive influence, both personally and professionally, on the lives of dozens of scholars. With his contagious enthusiasm and caring mentorship, Willy was an example for our academic community and with this tribute we express our gratitude for the privilege to have collaborated with him.\n\nTeaching medicine with the help of \"Dr. House\".\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJerrentrup, Andreas; Mueller, Tobias; Glowalla, Ulrich; Herder, Meike; Henrichs, Nadine; Neubauer, Andreas; Schaefer, Juergen R\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTV series such as \"House MD\", \"GreyÂ´s Anatomy\" or \"Emergency Room\" are well perceived by medical students. Seminars featuring medical TV series such as \"House MD\" might serve as door-opener to attract medical students to learn more about rare diseases. The TV series \"House MD\" is troublesome for the main character Dr. House is an excellent diagnostician but at the same time a rather misanthropic person. Therefore, lecturing medicine with the help of \"House MD\" requires constant evaluation. From 2008 to 2016 we are using the well-known TV series \"House MD\" continuously to attract medical students and teach them about rare diseases as well as diagnostic strategies. We collected from 213 students a detailed questionnaire assessing their learning experience. 76.6% of our students (n = 157) reported to watching medical dramas on a regular basis. The Dr. House seminar was compared to traditional seminars and our students reported an improved learning effect (69.9%), better concentration (89.7%), higher motivation to participate (88.7%), and more fun (86.7%) (all pHouse's behavior quite critically. Likert assessment on a 5-point scale identified strong disagreement with Dr. HouseÂ´s interpersonal skills in dealing with his colleagues (median = 1) and patients (median = 1). At the same time, the students strongly agreed with his outstanding diagnostic (median = 5) and therapeutic capabilities (median = 4). Medical students visiting a Dr. House teaching seminar are highly motivated to learn more about rare diseases. They were positively influenced by TV series such as Dr. House to improve their diagnostic and clinical skills. At the same time, they are critical enough not to see Dr. House as a role model for their own personality. Well performed medical TV shows such as Dr. House can successfully be used in an educational setting to motivate medical students to come into seminars to learn more about rare diseases.\n\nFlora medicinal en San NicolÃ¡s, municipio de Malinalco, Estado de MÃ©xico\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nWhite-Olascoaga, Laura; Juan-PÃ©rez, JosÃ© Isabel; ChÃ¡vez-MejÃ­a, Cristina; GutiÃ©rrez-Cedillo, JesÃºs GastÃ³n\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSe determinaron aspectos sobre el hÃ¡bitat, uso y funciÃ³n de los recursos vegetales utilizados en la medicina tradicional, en la comunidad de San NicolÃ¡s, municipio de Malinalco, ubicada al sur del Estado de MÃ©xico.

He was a first-generation ITER EDA person. Three months after the signing of the ITER EDA Agreement in July 1992, he arrived at the Naka Joint Work Site as Deputy Director of the ITER Central Team and Head of the site and he stayed for more than ten years. The Naka site was for design and technical co-ordination in the areas of magnets, plasma control and heating, plant systems, buildings, etc. Dr. Huguet was considered a highly qualified person to fill the position, since he had been successful as Deputy Director in similar areas in the JET Joint Undertaking. During the ITER EDA he co-ordinated the R and D activities in areas for which the Naka Joint Work Site was responsible. These R and D results permitted the completion of the ITER design in the above areas under his supervision. We thank Dr. Huguet for his achievements and contributions to ITER. He played a crucial role in establishing the convincing scientific and technical basis for ITER implementation. This was only made possible by his broad abilities and his dedication to the cause of fusion in general and ITER in particular\n\nReflexiones sobre la actualidad del relativismo cultural: respuesta a NicolÃ¡s SÃ¡nchez DurÃ¡\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nJacorzynski, Witold\n\n2013-01-01\n\nEste ensayo propone entablar una discusiÃ³n con las tesis contenidas en el artÃ­culo de NicolÃ¡s SÃ¡nchez DurÃ¡, \"Actualidad del relativismo cultural\".

This versatile facility, providing a large degree of controlled nuclear polarization, was used for a long-standing study of magnetic moments at shell closures in the region Z Â =Â 28, N Â =Â 28â50 but also for dedicated studies in the deformed region around A Â â¼Â 180. Another physics program was conducted to test symmetry in the weak sector and constrain weak coupling beyond VâA . Those two programs were supported by careful measurements of the involved solid state physics parameters to attain the full sensitivity of the technique and provide interesting interdisciplinary results. Future plans for this facility include the challenging idea of measuring the betaâgammaâneutron angular distributions from polarized beta delayed neutron emitters, further test of fundamental symmetries and obtaining nuclear structure data used in medical applications. The facility will also continue to contribute to both the nuclear structure and fundamental symmetry test programs.

South Africaâs political transformation not only offers a context for understanding the novel, but also provokes questions for the South African writer: how does the writer respond to the oppression of apartheid and the possibility of a new dispensation given the memory of such oppression? What forms best articulate that response? In the case of Horseman, how does one read the bookâs pessimism against the backdrop of the first democratic elections? A consideration of Nicolâs greater body of workâhis realist and more allegorical modesâpoints to a complicated relationship between the South African writer and the period of transition leading up to the 1994 elections.\n\nDrÃ¦b, drÃ¦b, drÃ¦b!

We aimed to determine the ability of this device, incorporated in clinical work flow, to detect retinopathy in persons with type 2 diabetes. Retinal images of persons treated by the Hoorn Diabetes Care System (DCS) were graded by the IDx-DR device and independently by three retinal specialists using the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy severity scale (ICDR) and EURODIAB criteria. Agreement between specialists was calculated. Results of the IDx-DR device and experts were compared using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), distinguishing between referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) and vision-threatening retinopathy (VTDR). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated. Of the included 1415 persons, 898 (63.5%) had images of sufficient quality according to the experts and the IDx-DR device. Referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) was diagnosed in 22 persons (2.4%) using EURODIAB and 73 persons (8.1%) using ICDR classification. Specific intergrader agreement ranged from 40% to 61%. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of IDx-DR to detect RDR were 91% (95% CI: 0.69-0.98), 84% (95% CI: 0.81-0.86), 12% (95% CI: 0.08-0.18) and 100% (95% CI: 0.99-1.00; EURODIAB) and 68% (95% CI: 0.56-0.79), 86% (95% CI: 0.84-0.88), 30% (95% CI: 0.24-0.38) and 97% (95% CI: 0.95-0.98; ICDR). The AUC was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88-1.00; EURODIAB) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83-0.92; ICDR). For detection of VTDR, sensitivity was lower and specificity was higher compared to RDR. AUC's were comparable. Automated grading using the IDx-DR device for RDR detection is a valid method and can be used in primary care, decreasing the demand on ophthalmologists. Â© 2017 The Authors.

The data collected during the first 22 months of the nominal, five-year mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC), resulting into this second data release. A summary of the release properties is provided in Gaia Collaboration et al. (2018b). The overall scientific validation of the data is described in Arenou et al. (2018). Background information on the mission and the spacecraft can be found in Gaia Collaboration et al. (2016), with a more detailed presentation of the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) in Cropper et al. (2018). In addition, Gaia DR2 is accompanied by various, dedicated papers that describe the processing and validation of the various data products. Four more Gaia Collaboration papers present a glimpse of the scientific richness of the data. In addition to this set of refereed publications, this documentation provides a detailed, complete overview of the processing and validation of the Gaia DR2 data. Gaia data, from both Gaia DR1 and Gaia DR2, can be retrieved from the Gaia archive, which is accessible from https://archives.esac.esa.int/gaia. The archive also provides various tutorials on data access and data queries plus an integrated data model (i.e., description of the various fields in the data tables). In addition, Luri et al. (2018) provide concrete advice on how to deal with Gaia astrometry, with recommendations on how best to estimate distances from parallaxes. The Gaia archive features an enhanced visualisation service which can be used for quick initial explorations of the entire Gaia DR2 data set.

A recent, unsuccessful attempt to censure Dr. Oz raises the issue of whether the medical profession can effectively self-regulate at all. It also raises concern that the medical profession's self-regulation might be selectively activated, perhaps only when the subject of professional censure has achieved a level of public visibility. We argue here that the medical profession must look at itself with a healthy dose of self-doubt about whether it has sufficient knowledge of or handle on the less visible Dr. \"Ozes\" quietly operating under the profession's presumptive endorsement.

Here, we investigated each receptor's contribution to rhTRAIL sensitivity and rhTRAIL resistance. We assessed whether agonistic DR4 or DR5 antibodies could be used to circumvent rhTRAIL resistance, alone or in combination with various chemotherapies. Our study was performed in an isogenic model comprised of the SW948 human colon carcinoma cell line and its rhTRAIL resistant sub-line SW948-TR. Effects of rhTRAIL and agonistic DR4/DR5 antibodies on cell viability were measured using MTT assays and identification of morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, after acridine orange staining. Sensitivity to the different death receptor ligands was stimulated using pretreatment with the cytokine IFN-gamma and the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the changes in rhTRAIL sensitivity, alterations in expression levels of targets of interest were measured by Western blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to determine the composition of the death-inducing signalling complex at the cell membrane. SW948 cells were sensitive to all three of the DR-targeting agents tested, although the agonistic DR5 antibody induced only weak caspase 8 cleavage and limited apoptosis. Surprisingly, agonistic DR4 and DR5 antibodies induced equivalent DISC formation and caspase 8 cleavage at the level of their individual receptors, suggesting impairment of further caspase 8 processing upon DR5 stimulation.

It is felt that at least two remarkable personalities namely, Dr. Samuel Johnson from England, a man of letters and the compiler of the first ever English dictionary, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart from Austria, one of the greatest musical genius of all time, possibly suffered from this condition. Tourette's syndrome is often described as the classical borderzone between neurology and psychiatry and every neurologist wonders at the curious and fascinating clinical features of this condition. It seems that at least two remarkable personalities, Dr. Samuel Johnson, a man of letters and the first person to compile an English dictionary, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, arguably the most creative musical composer of all time, were possibly afflicted with this condition.\n\nDr. med. â obsolet? Eine Querschnittserhebung zur Wahrnehmung und Akzeptanz der medizinischen Doktorarbeit\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHeun, Xenia\n\n2014-08-01\n\nFull Text Available [english] Purpose: To obtain the German Medical Degree âDr.med.â candidates are required to write a scientific thesis which is usually accomplished during Medical school education. This extra work load for the students amongst a lack of standardization and an M.D. awarded upon graduation in other European and Anglo-Saxon countries leads repeatedly to criticism of the German system. However, a systematic survey on the perception and acceptance of the German doctoral thesis among those affected is overdue.Methods: Using an online questionnaire, medical students as well as licensed doctors were asked for the status of their medical degree, their motivation, personal benefit, time and effort, scientific output, its meaningfulness and alternatives concerning their thesis. Patients were asked, how important they value their general practitionerâs title âDr. med.â. The resulting data were evaluated performing basic statistic analyses.Results and Conclusions: The title âDr. med.â does not seem to be obsolete, but there is room for improvement. The scientific output is good and only a mere 15.1% of the candidates do not publish their results at all. Moreover, while at an early stage motivation, appreciation and recognition of personal benefits from the medical degree are considered as independent aspects, they merge to a general view at later stages. The current practice is considered most meaningful by the ones who have already finished their thesis. However, there are discrepancies between the expected and the actual length as well as the type of the thesis indicating that mentoring and educational advertising need improvement. As for the patients, their educational level seems to correlate with the significance attributed to the title âDr. med.â held by their physician.\n\nEl converso sevillano NicolÃ¡s MartÃ­nez de Medina (o de Sevilla, contador mayor de Castilla.

Several strong methanol masers were found. The positions of the two brightest masers were measured with an accuracy of about + or - 0.3 arcsec. Toward DR 21(OH), the positions, velocities, and line shapes of the 95 GHz masers are in excellent agreement with those of the 84-GHz 5(-1) to 4 () methanol masers previously mapped by Batrla and Menten (1988), demonstrating that maser emission in both transitions originates from the same clumps of gas. The methanol masers are offset from CS emission peaks and from other known infrared and maser sources; they may possibly be clustered along the interface between outflows, traced by shock-excited H2 emission, and dense ambient gas, traced by CS emission. 25 refs\n\nDr Stanislaw Huskowski, Mayor of Wroclaw, Poland\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nPatrice LoÃ¯ez\n\n2002-01-01\n\nDr Stanislaw Huskowski, Mayor of Wroclaw, Poland visiting the ATLAS magnet assembly hall, building 180 with Mr Carlo Lamprecht, State Councillor, Dr Stanislaw Huskowski and Dr Peter Jenni, ATLAS Spokesperson\n\n[The anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp: The beginning of a medical utopia].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRosler, Roberto; Young, Pablo\n\n2011-04-01\n\nThe Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp was painted by Rembrandt Harmen-szoon van Rijn at the early age of 26 years. In the XVII century these paintings were very popular in the Netherlands, and in this country the cities flourished as cultural centers searching the anatomy knowledge. Nicolaes Tulp was one of the persons in the center of Amsterdam's scene during XVII century. In 1632 Tulp was 39 years old, and he was an anatomist and a surgeon. Rembrandt masterly shows an autopsy performed by Dr. Tulp. This picture is the description of the beginning of a medical intellectual utopia: the absolute visibility of the disease. Unfortunately this utopia is blind to the complete visibility of the psycho-socio-cultural dimensions of the ill.\n\nDr Stanislaw Huskowski, Mayor of Wroclaw, Poland\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nPatrice LoÃ¯ez\n\n2002-01-01\n\nDr Stanislaw Huskowski, Mayor of Wroclaw, Poland visiting the ATLAS magnet assembly hall, building 180.

Was Caroline Browne suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis? Was hydrocyanic acid an accepted treatment at that time? Did Mrs Browne take the wrong dose? Was an incorrect concentration of the drug prepared by Dr Pugh? Did he use the wrong pharmacopoeia in preparing the hydrocyanic acid? Why was there no inquest?

In contrast, the implication of intestinal Afa/Dr DAEC in diarrhea is still under debate. These strains are age dependently involved in diarrhea in children, are apparently not involved in diarrhea in adults, and can also be asymptomatic intestinal microbiota strains in children and adult. This comprehensive review analyzes the epidemiology and diagnosis and highlights recent progress which has improved the understanding of Afa/Dr DAEC pathogenesis. Here, I summarize the roles of Afa/Dr DAEC virulence factors, including Afa/Dr adhesins, flagella, Sat toxin, and pks island products, in the development of specific mechanisms of pathogenicity. In intestinal epithelial polarized cells, the Afa/Dr adhesins trigger cell membrane receptor clustering and activation of the linked cell signaling pathways, promote structural and functional cell lesions and injuries in intestinal barrier, induce proinflammatory responses, create angiogenesis, instigate epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like events, and lead to pks-dependent DNA damage. UTI-associated Afa/Dr DAEC strains, following adhesin-membrane receptor cell interactions and activation of associated lipid raft-dependent cell signaling pathways, internalize in a microtubule-dependent manner within urinary tract epithelial cells, develop a particular intracellular lifestyle, and trigger a toxin-dependent cell detachment. In response to Afa/Dr DAEC infection, the host epithelial cells generate antibacterial defense responses. Finally, I discuss a hypothetical role of intestinal Afa/Dr DAEC strains that can act as âsilent pathogensâ with the capacity to emerge as âpathobiontsâ for the development of inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal carcinogenesis.

It is felt that at least two remarkable personalities namely, Dr. Samuel Johnson from England, a man of letters and the compiler of the first ever English dictionary, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart from Austria, one of the greatest musical genius of all time, possibly suffered from this condition. Touretteâ²s syndrome is often described as the classical borderzone between neurology and psychiatry and every neurologist wonders at the curious and fascinating clinical features of this condition. It seems that at least two remarkable personalities, Dr. Samuel Johnson, a man of letters and the first person to compile an English dictionary, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, arguably the most creative musical composer of all time, were possibly afflicted with this condition.\n\nLa musa que tose.

However, biochemical characterization of the serologically defined DR4 haplotype from normal individuals revealed five DR4 and three DQW3 molecular forms. Hence, in this study, they investigated the heterogeneity of the DR4 haplotype, using B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) generated from patients with IDD and seropositive for DR4. Class II molecules, metabolically labeled with 35 S-methionine, were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies specific for DR(L243), DQ(N297), DQW3(IVD12) or DR and DQ(SG465) and analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). The isoelectrofocusing (IEF) conditions employed in this study allow representation only of the DR4 haplotype from either DR3/4 or DR4/4 cell lines. The analysis of six different DR4 haplotypes from seven IDD patients, revealed the presence of two DR4 Î² and two DQW3 Î² chains. Three of the six DR4 Î² haplotypes analyzed shared the same DR4 Î² chain and three others shared a different one. Additionally five of the six haplotypes shared a different one. Additionally five of the six haplotypes shared the same DQW3 Î² chain and only one was carrying a different one. Different combinations of the two DR4 and two DQW3 Î² chains constitute three distinct patterns of DR4 haplotypes. These results suggest the prevalence of a DQW3 Î² chain in the small sample of IDD patients studied. Studies of a large number of patients should clarify whether IDD is associated with unique variants of DR4 or DQW3 Î² chains\n\nDr. von Braun and Dr. Stuhlinger With a Model of the Nuclear-Electric Vehicles\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2004-01-01\n\nIn this photo, taken at the Walt Disney Studios in California, Dr. Wernher von Braun and Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger are shown discussing the concepts of nuclear-electric spaceships designed to undertake the mission to the planet Mars.

Study Design: Cross sectional / analytical study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Immunology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi in collaboration with Rheumatology departments of Military Hospital, Rawalpindi and Fauji Foundation Hospital, Rawalpindi, from January 2009 to January 2010. Methodology: HLA DR beta 1 genotyping of one hundred Pakistani patients, diagnosed as having RA as per American College of Rheumatology revised criteria 1987, was done. HLA DR beta 1 genotyping was carried out at allele group level (DR beta 1*01-DR beta 1*16) by sequence specific primers in RA patients. Comparison of HLA DR beta 1 allele frequencies between patients and control groups was made using Pearson's chi-square test to find possible association of HLA DR?1 alleles with RA in Pakistani rheumatoid patients. Results: HLA DR beta 1*04 was expressed with significantly increased frequency in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (p <0.05). HLA DR?1*11 was expressed statistically significantly more in control group as compared to rheumatoid patients indicating a possible protective effect. There was no statistically significant difference observed in frequencies of HLA DR beta 1 allele *01, DR beta 1 allele *03, DR beta 1 allele *07, DR beta 1 allele *08, DR beta 1 allele *09, DR beta 1 allele *10, DR beta 1 allele *12, DR beta 1 allele *13, DR beta 1 allele *14, DR?1 allele *15 and DR beta 1 allele *16 between patients and control groups. Conclusion: The identification of susceptible HLA DR beta 1 alleles in Pakistani RA patients may help physicians to make early decisions regarding initiation of early intensive therapy with disease modifying anti rheumatic medicines and biological agents decreasing disability in RA patients.

Trevor began his study of magnetism as a PhD student at Monash University in Melbourne in the early 1960s, working with Professor Jack Smith. From the very beginning magnetism in alloys, and disordered systems in general, became a key aspect of his career. After a postdoctoral position at Harwell working with Dr Graeme Low Trevor returned to Australia and took up a position with Monash. He soon became a key figure in developing the capability for neutron scattering using the HIFAR reactor at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, now the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO. The instrumentation was always developed to further his studies of magnetism. The development of polarization analysis measurements of diffuse magnetic scattering, first using iron filters and then his own design of supermirror benders for beam polarization, took place through the 1970s, 1980s and into the 1990s. Throughout this time, Trevor mentored a series of PhD students and postdoctoral fellows, many of whom have contributed to this issue (and, indeed, guest edited it). As befits a scientist and university academic for whom teaching has always been important, Trevor has not only created a strong body of significant research, he has also made a major contribution to preparing several generations of neutron scattering scientists, and this issue reflects that. When I approached Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter with a proposal for an issue in honour of Trevor, the response was immediate and positive. It is with great pleasure that I present the result of that proposal. The great diversity of the content, all centred on neutron scattering and magnetism, reflects the breadth of Trevor's own career and of the scientists with whom he has interacted. Finally, I would like to make some\n\nComparaison du SrÅÅ¡ DrÅn avec le DrÅn YaÅ¡t\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nRedard, CÃ©line\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper draws a parallel between two texts having the same textual base: The SrÅÅ¡ DrÅn, derived from the Long Liturgy and the DrÅn YaÅ¡t, belonging to the short liturgies.

A significant increase in HLA-DR7 was found in the nonradiation-associated thyroid cancer patients (42.5%, 20/47 cases), compared to 22.8% of 979 normal controls. The association is stronger in the follicular and mixed papillary-follicular subgroup (52.0%, 13/25 cases, P corrected less than 0.01). The occurrence of various malignancies in family members was found in 57.9% of HLA-DR7 positive patients, versus 20% of HLA-DR7 negative patients, in a retrospective record review. Although the frequency of HLA-DR7 was not increased in the radiation-associated thyroid cancer patients (22.2%, 6/27 cases), the interval from the irradiation date to the onset date of thyroid cancer was shorter in HLA-DR7 positive cases (17.3 +/- 6.2 years) than in HLA-DR7 negative patients (29.4 +/- 11.5 years). This data suggest that HLA-DR7 is associated with and may influence development of thyroid cancer\n\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as Spiritual Leader\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAndrea Pierce\n\n2013-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The purpose of this paper is to explore Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.âs spiritual leadership through his âI Have a Dreamâ speech. The paper explores the three characteristics of spiritual leadership as posed by Fryâs (2003 spiritual leadership theory: vision, hope/faith and altruistic love. The research draws upon these characteristics through qualitative content analysis of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.âs âI Have a Dreamâ speech to illustrate Dr. Kingâs leadership as that of a spiritual leader. The research advances the spiritual leadership theory by establishing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a spiritual leader.

A cross sectional survey to investigate the perception and acceptance of the German medical degree.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHeun, Xenia; EisenlÃ¶ffel, Christian; Barann, Bastian; MÃ¼ller-Hilke, Brigitte\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo obtain the German Medical Degree \"Dr.med.\" candidates are required to write a scientific thesis which is usually accomplished during Medical school education. This extra work load for the students amongst a lack of standardization and an M.D. awarded upon graduation in other European and Anglo-Saxon countries leads repeatedly to criticism of the German system. However, a systematic survey on the perception and acceptance of the German doctoral thesis among those affected is overdue. Using an online questionnaire, medical students as well as licensed doctors were asked for the status of their medical degree, their motivation, personal benefit, time and effort, scientific output, its meaningfulness and alternatives concerning their thesis. Patients were asked, how important they value their general practitioner's title \"Dr. med.\". The resulting data were evaluated performing basic statistic analyses. The title \"Dr. med.\" does not seem to be obsolete, but there is room for improvement. The scientific output is good and only a mere 15.1% of the candidates do not publish their results at all. Moreover, while at an early stage motivation, appreciation and recognition of personal benefits from the medical degree are considered as independent aspects, they merge to a general view at later stages. The current practice is considered most meaningful by the ones who have already finished their thesis. However, there are discrepancies between the expected and the actual length as well as the type of the thesis indicating that mentoring and educational advertising need improvement. As for the patients, their educational level seems to correlate with the significance attributed to the title \"Dr. med.\" held by their physician.\n\nA survey in the West Midlands on the use of the courtesy title 'Dr' by UK dental practitioners.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nThomas, D J; Allsopp, J\n\n1997-10-25\n\nTo assess the 1995 General Dental Council's decision to remove restrictions on GDPs using the courtesy title 'Dr'. In 1996 this survey undertook a qualitative analysis of the views of four groups involved in primary dental care: 72 GDPs, 25 medical practitioners, 46 vocational dental practitioners, 89 patients. These indicated that some respondents thought that there would possibly be better quality of patient care due to improved medical history taking, that the public's image of the dental profession might be enhanced and that 87% of newly qualified dentists were in favour of the use of the title 'Dr'. Use of the title appears to be on the increase and if use of the title does become widespread, then all practitioners will need to re-evaluate their choice of personal titles. GDPs need to consider if using the title 'Dr' will encourage patients to give more detailed medical histories.\n\nA tribute to Dr. Robert C. Allen, an inspirational teacher, humanitarian, and friend (Nov. 18, 1950-Mar. 24, 2005).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEdlich, Richard F; Greene, Jill A; Long, William B\n\n2006-01-01\n\nDr. Robert C. Allen was a gifted educator, as well as experienced ophthalmologist, who was a close personal friend of Dr. Edlich at the University of Virginia Health System. While serving on the faculty at the University of Virginia Health System, Dr. Allen proved to be a compassionate physician, who developed close personal relationships with the residents, faculty, and his patients. Dr. Allen was invited by Dr Edlich to be a member of the Editorial Board of the Journal of Long-Term Effects of Medical Implants. When Dr. Allen told Dr. Edlich that he had ocular melanoma in 2000, this news was a wake-up call to Dr. Edlich on the need to prevent skin cancer, as well as ocular melanoma. Empowered by this news, Dr. Edlich was honored to co-author four articles on skin cancer prevention, as well as the latest article focusing on prevention of ocular melanoma. The Ocular Melanoma Foundation (Richmond, VA (USA)) was founded in 2003 by Dr. Robert C. Allen to increase awareness, enhance education, and provide advocacy among both patients and health care professionals regarding this rare, but potentially lethal cancer. It has a website that provides patient information, up-to-date information and enables communication/ discourse between and among patients and practitioners (admin@ocularmelanoma.org). Dr. Allen died on March 24, 2005, at his home surrounded by family and loved ones. When surgeons are faced with challenging healthcare diseases, Dr. Edlich's mentor, Dr. Owen Wangensteen, advised Dr. Edlich that he should seek the advice and guidance of skilled basic scientists, who are familiar with the problem. Dr. Wangensteen is recognized as the greatest surgical teacher during the 20th century. Consequently, Dr. Edlich enlisted the advice and guidance from the two co-authors of the next article regarding the scientific basis for the selection of sunglasses to prevent the development of cataracts, pterygia, skin cancer, as well as ocular melanoma.

Large stresses...... are generated in the anterior muscles that cross the knee and hip joint, mainly employing the quadriceps at an intensity of 30-40% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), sometimes exceeding 100% MVC. Better sailing level is partially determined by a lower rate of neuromuscular fatigue during hiking and for â60...\n\nHuman immune responsiveness to Lolium perenne pollen allergen Lol p III (rye III) is associated with HLA-DR3 and DR5.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAnsari, A A; Freidhoff, L R; Meyers, D A; Bias, W B; Marsh, D G\n\n1989-05-01\n\nA well-characterized allergen of Lolium perenne (perennial rye grass) pollen, Lol p III, has been used as a model antigen to study the genetic control of the human immune response. Associations between HLA type and IgE or IgG antibody (Ab) responsiveness to Lol p III were studied in two groups of skin-test-positive Caucasoid adults (N = 135 and 67). We found by nonparametric and parametric analyses that immune responsiveness to Lol p III was significantly associated with HLA-DR3 and DR5. No association was found between any DQ type and immune responsiveness to Lol p III. Geometric mean IgE or IgG Ab levels to Lol p III were not different between B8+, DR3+ subjects and B8-, DR3+ subjects, showing that HLA-B8 had no influence on the association. Lol p III IgG Ab data obtained on subjects after grass antigen immunotherapy showed that 100% of DR3 subjects and 100% of DR5 subjects were Ab+. A comparison of all the available protein sequences of DRB gene products showed that the first hypervariable region of DR3 and DR5 (and DRw6), and no other region, contains the sequence Glu9-Tyr-Ser-Thr-Ser13. Our observations are consistent with the possibility that immune responsiveness to the allergen Lol p III is associated with this amino acid sequence in the first hypervariable region of the DR beta 1 polypeptide chain.\n\nThe Chymistry of \"The Learned Dr Plot\" (1640-96).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRoos, Anna Marie\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn the seventeenth century, there were developing norms of openness in the presentation of scientific knowledge that were at odds with traditions of secrecy among chymists, particularly practitioners of chrysopoeia, or the transmutation of metals. This chapter analyzes how Dr. Robert Plot, the first professor of chymistry at Oxford, negotiated these boundaries within an institutional context. I first delineate his chymical and experimental practice, which incorporated procedures from medieval alchemical sources, particularly the Lullian corpus, as well as more novel practices from seventeenth-century chymistry. Then, I analyze how personal and institutional ambitions and economic considerations shaped to what extent Plot negotiated the boundaries between secrecy and the public dissemination of chymical knowledge.\n\nA Personal Reflection on the History of Radiation Oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChu, Florence C.H.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nPurpose: To provide a historical and personal narrative of the development of radiation oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), from its founding more than 100 years ago to the present day.

El peso de entidades como la monarquÃ­a, la nobleza y la Iglesia seguÃ­a siendo grande, pero el espÃ­ritu renovador de la Ã©poca dio lugar a nuevos organismos como las academias, sociedades econÃ³micas, e incluso instituciones menos definidas como la prensa y la tertulia cultural. Este artÃ­culo traza la carrera de NicolÃ¡s FernÃ¡ndez de MoratÃ­n, describiendo cÃ³mo se enfrentÃ³ con esas entidades y precisando cÃ³mo influyeron en sus escritos. Algunas instituciones como las educativas, profesionales o eclesiÃ¡sticas conformaron las actividades del escritor tanto en el terreno ideolÃ³gico como en el estilÃ­stico; otras, como en el caso de MoratÃ­n la Sociedad EconÃ³mica Matritense, abren nuevas perspectivas para dar resultados literarios singulares al producirse una confluencia entre formas tradicionales y temas nuevos.ABSTRACT: In eighteenth-century Spain, where the literary world was insufficiently developed to allow authors to live by the pen, writers had to learn to negotiate the complex ways of established institutions. The prevailing influence of the monarchy, nobility and Church was great, but the spirit of renewal evident during the period gave rise to new organizations such as the royal academies, economic societies and less clearly identifiable institutions such as the press or the cultural club. The present article outlines the career of NicolÃ¡s FernÃ¡ndez de MoratÃ­n, demonstrating how the author negotiated these organizations and how they influenced his writings. Some institutions, like those belonging to the educational, professional and ecclesiastical worlds, influenced the writer both in an ideological and stylistic sense; others, as in MoratÃ­nâs case the Madrid Economic Society, provided an\n\nPrakash, Dr Vishweshwaraiah\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nPrakash, Dr Vishweshwaraiah Ph.D. (Mysore), FNASc, FNAE, FRSC,FNAAS.

Surgeons at Harlem Hospital in New York City removed a 17.8-cm (7-in)-long letter opener from Dr King's chest. Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist Goldie Brangman remembers this event because she participated in Dr King's anesthetic. This article correlates Brangman's memories with published accounts of the event. It also places the event within the context of the modern civil rights movement that Dr King led.\n\nDr. Steve Thompson, Chief Executive, The Royal Society of New Zealand\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nMaximilien Brice\n\n2002-01-01\n\nL. to r.: Dr Austin Ball, Deputy Technical Coordinator, CMS experiment; Dr Roland Horisberger, Paul Scherrer Institute and CERN, CMS experiment; Dr Steve Thompson, Chief Executive, The Royal Society of New Zealand; Dr Michel Della Negra, Spokesman, CMS experiment and Dr Alick Macpherson, Paul Scherrer Institute and CERN, CMS experiment, in the CMS Silicon Tracker assembly hall.\n\nAntero-posterior patterning of the vertebrate digestive tract: 40 years after Nicole Le Douarin's PhD thesis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGrapin-Botton, Anne\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis review is dedicated to the work on chick digestive tract organogenesis that Nicole Le Douarin performed as a PhD student under the direction of Etienne Wolf. I discuss how she laid the grounds for future work by establishing fate maps at somitic stages, by describing morphogenetic movements between germ layers and by pointing to signaling events between endoderm and mesoderm. Her inspiring work was extended by others, in particular at the molecular level, leading to a better understanding of antero-posterior patterning in the digestive tract. Antero-posterior patterning of endoderm is initiated at gastrulation when future anterior and posterior endoderm ingress at different times and accordingly express different genes. Plasticity is however maintained at somite stages and even later, when organ primordia can be delineated. There is a cross-talk between endoderm and mesoderm and the two layers exchange instructive signals that induce specific antero-posterior identities as well as permissive signals required for organogenesis from previously patterned fields. Recent experiments suggest that several signaling molecules involved in neural tube antero-posterior patterning are also instrumental in the digestive tract including retinoic acid and FGF4.\n\nBhandari, Dr Nita\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nElected: 2015 Section: Medicine.
