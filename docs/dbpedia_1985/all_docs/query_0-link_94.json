A frequent form of presentation of systemic sarcoidosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarcoval, Joaquim; MaÃ±Ã¡, Juan\n\n2016-03-29\n\nIn recent years we have observed with increasing frequency granulomatous papular lesions involving the knees, for which we proposed the term papular sarcoidosis of knees. To evaluate the clinicopathological features of papular sarcoidosis of the knees. Patients with papular lesions of the knees and histopathologically sarcoid granulomas were included in the study. Systemic sarcoidosis was investigated in all cases. Clinical charts were retrospectively retrieved. Biopsy specimens were evaluated under polarized light to detect foreign bodies. Fifty-three patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. In 36 cases systemic sarcoidosis was diagnosed and these cases were considered as papular sarcoidosis of the knees. Foreign particles were observed in 21 of these 36 patients. In only 9/36 patients did the activity of systemic disease persist over two years. In 17 cases sarcoidosis could not be demonstrated during follow-up. Papular sarcoidosis of the knees can be considered a relatively frequent form of cutaneous sarcoidosis usually present at the beginning of the disease that can be useful for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. It is mainly observed in acute forms of sarcoidosis and can be considered a sign of good prognosis.\n\nOcular sporotrichosis: A frequently misdiagnosed cause of granulomatous conjunctivitis in epidemic areas.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamagata, JoÃ£o Paulo M; Rudolph, Fabiana B; Nobre, Maria Clara L; Nascimento, Leninha V; Sampaio, Felipe MaurÃ­cio S; Arinelli, Andrea; Freitas, Dayvison F\n\n2017-12-01\n\nSporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis caused by Sporothrix sp., a dimorphic fungus. Although the cutaneous form is the most frequent form, the ocular presentation has been increasingly diagnosed in epidemic areas. We describe three cases of ocular sporotrichosis with the involvement of the ocular adnexa due to autoinoculation without trauma with successful antifungal treatment. Patient 1: A 68-year-old woman presented with granulomatous conjunctivitis of the right eye with an ulcerated nodule on the right temporal region for 5 months. Patient 2: A 46-year-old woman with conjunctival hyperemia of the left eye with associated periorbital edema and erythema for the past 4 months was referred to the Dermatology Department due to an ulcerated nodule on the left malar region. Patient 3: A 14-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with inferior palpebral edema with a 5-day evolution. Specimens were obtained from the lesions of the three patients, and the cultures were positive for Sporothrix sp. The three cases were diagnosed as ocular sporotrichosis and were successfully treated with itraconazole (200-400 mg/d). Two of the three patients developed sequelae such as conjunctival fibrosis and symblepharon. We emphasize the importance of the ophthalmologist being familiar with the diagnosis and management of this rare and frequently misdiagnosed form of sporotrichosis.\n\nChest CT scans are frequently abnormal in asymptomatic patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nVallipuram, Janaki; Dhalla, Sidika; Bell, Chaim M; Dresser, Linda; Han, Heekyung; Husain, Shahid; Minden, Mark D; Paul, Narinder S; So, Miranda; Steinberg, Marilyn; Vallipuram, Mayuran; Wong, Gary; Morris, Andrew M\n\n2017-04-01\n\nChest computed tomography (CT) findings of nodules, ground glass opacities, and consolidations are often interpreted as representing invasive fungal infection in individuals with febrile neutropenia. We assessed whether these CT findings were present in asymptomatic individuals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at low risk of invasive fungal disease. A retrospective study of consecutive asymptomatic adult patients with newly diagnosed AML over a 2-year period was performed at a tertiary care oncology center. Radiology reports of baseline chest CTs were reviewed. Of 145 CT scans, the majority (88%) had pulmonary abnormalities. Many (70%) had one or both of unspecified opacities (52%) and nodules (49%). Ground glass opacities (18%) and consolidations (12%) occurred less frequently. Radiologists suggested pneumonia as a possible diagnosis in 32% (nâ=â47) of scans. Chest CT may result in over-diagnosis of invasive fungal disease in individuals with febrile neutropenia if interpreted without correlation to the patients' clinical status.\n\nNursing diagnoses in elderly residents of a nursing home: a case in Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nGÃ¼ler, Elem KocaÃ§al; EÅer, Ismet; Khorshid, Leyla; YÃ¼cel, Sebnem Ãinar\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThere are limited studies on nursing diagnoses of the elderly living in nursing homesÂ worldwide. This study aimed to define the most frequent nursing diagnoses in the elderly residents of a nursing home elder care and rehabilitation center. Seventy-four elderly individuals were included in the study. Data were collected using the \"Elderly Individual's Introduction Form\" between April 2007 to August 2007. The content of the form was based on a guide to gerontologic assessment, and Gordon's Functional Health Patterns. The nursing diagnoses (NANDA-I Taxonomy II) were identified by the 2 researchers separately according to the defining characteristics and the risk factors. The consistency between the nursing diagnoses defined by the 2 researchers was evaluated using Cohen's kappa (Îº). There was an 84.7% agreement about nursing diagnoses defined by the 2 researchers separately. The weighted kappa consistency analyses showed there was an adequate level of consistency (Îº = 0.710), and the findings were significant (p < 0.0001). The most frequent diagnoses were ineffective role performance (86.5%), ineffective health maintenance (81.2%), risk for falls (77%), and impaired physical mobility (73%). The diagnosis of ineffective role performance was more frequent in patients with dementia (x(2) =10.993, df = 1, p = 0.001). There was a very significant relationship between dementia and the diagnosis of impaired verbal communication (x(2) = 32.718, df = 1, p = 0.0001). The relationship between mobility disorder and self-care deficit was also significant (x(2) = 19.411, df = 1, p = 0.0001). To improve quality in patient care, nurses should use nursing diagnoses with a systematic assessment and should help the elderly in health promotion or use of the maximum current potential.

A descriptive and cross-sectional study involving 38 patients with respiratory problems, of referral hospitals, in a city in northeastern Brazil, in the period from August to October, 2012. Data collection was performed using a form and diagnostic inference was made according with the Taxonomy II of NANDA I. The average age of the patients was 46 years and males predominated (60.5%). The most frequent nursing diagnoses were: Risk for infection (97.3%), Acute pain (68.4%), Poor knowledge (68.4%), Sedentary lifestyle (65.7%), Ineffective airway clearance (65.7%), Risk-prone health behavior (63.1%), Activity intolerance (52.6%) and Disturbed sleep pattern (33.3%). Evaluated patients exhibited an average of 8.6 nursing diagnoses (SD = 2.8). With respect to the defining characteristics and related factors the average per person was 7.2 and 9.3, respectively. In this group of patients the most frequent diagnoses were the domain activity/rest. Knowledge of nursing diagnoses profile presented by people with respiratory disorders is important, because it is part of the Nursing Process and nurses who take care of such patients should exercise them in their care practice. Knowledge of the mains nursing diagnosis presented by patients with respiratory disorders are important for the practice of nurses who care for these patients, because it allows the choice of responses to problems of their clientele.\n\nHashimoto thyroiditis is more frequent than expected when diagnosed by cytology which uncovers a pre-clinical state\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Our Thyroid-Multidisciplinary Clinic is a large referral site for thyroid diseases. Thyroid biopsies are mainly performed for thyroid cancer screening. Yet, Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is being too frequently diagnosed. The prevalence of HT is reported as 0.3-1.2% or twice the prevalence of type 1 diabetes. However, the prevalence of HT confirmed by cytology is still uncertain. To evaluate different aspects of thyroid physiopathology including prevalence of Hashimoto's, a database of clinical features, ultrasound images and cytology results of patients referred for FNA of thyroid nodules was prospectively developed. Methods We retrospectively studied 811 consecutive patients for whom ultrasound guided thyroid FNA biopsies were performed at our clinic over 2.5 year period (Mar/2006-Sep/2008). Results The analysis of our database revealed that from 761 patients, 102 (13.4%) had HT, from whom 56 (7.4%) were euthyroid or had sub-clinical (non-hypothyroid) disease, and 46 (6%) were clinically hypothyroid. Conclusions This is the first study to show such a high prevalence of HT diagnosed by ultrasound-guided FNA. More strikingly, the prevalence of euthyroid HT, appears to be >5% similar to that of type 2 diabetes. Based on our results, there might be a need to follow up on cytological Hashimoto's to monitor for thyroid failure, especially in high risk states, like pregnancy. The potential risk for thyroid cancer in patients with biopsy-proven inflammation of thyroid epithelium remains to be established prospectively. However, it may explain the increased risk for thyroid cancer observed in patients with elevated but within normal TSH.

We audited the completion of hand-written consent forms and trialled a web-based application to generate modifiable, procedure-specific consent forms. The investigation comprised two phases at separate UK hospitals. In phase one, the completion of individual responses in hand-written consent forms for a variety of procedures were prospectively audited. Responses were categorised into three domains (patient details, procedure details and patient sign-off) that were considered \"failed\" if a contained element was not correct and legible. Phase two was confined to a breast surgical unit where hand-written consent forms were assessed as for phase one and interrogated for missing complications by two independent experts. An electronic consent platform was introduced and electronically-produced consent forms assessed. In phase one, 99 hand-written consent forms were assessed and the domain failure rates were: patient details 10%; procedure details 30%; and patient sign-off 27%. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was the most common procedure (7/99) but there was significant variability in the documentation of complications: 12 in total, a median of 6 and a range of 2-9. In phase two, 44% (27/61) of hand-written forms were missing essential complications. There were no domain failures amongst 29 electronically-produced consent forms and no variability in the documentation of potential complications. Completion of hand-written consent forms suffers from wide variation and is frequently suboptimal. Electronically-produced, procedure-specific consent forms can improve the quality and consistency of consent documentation.

There is a lack on studies about psychiatric inpatient characteristics and possible relationships among these characteristics with nursing diagnoses. A quantitative-descriptive, cross-sectional, completed data sampling study was performed. The data were collected from the electronic patient record system. Frequencies for the social-demographic data, the prevalence of the NANDA-I diagnoses and the explanatory variables were calculated. In total, 410 nursing phenomena were found representing 85 different NANDA-I diagnoses in 312 patients. The NANDA-I diagnosis \"Ineffective Coping\" was the most frequently stated diagnosis followed by \"Ineffective Health Maintenance,\" \"Hopelessness\" and \"Risk for Other-Directed Violence\". Men were more frequently affected by the diagnoses \"Ineffective Coping,\" \"Hopelessness,\" \"Risk for Self-Directed Violence,\" \"Defensive Coping\" and \"Risk for Suicide,\" whereas the diagnoses \"Insomnia,\" \"Chronic Confusion,\" \"Chronic Low Self-Esteem\" and \"Anxiety\" were more common in women. Patients under the age of 45Â years were more frequently affected by \"Chronic Low Self-Esteem\" and \"Anxiety\" than older patients. \"Ineffective Coping\" was the most prevalent diagnosis by patients with mental disorders due to psychoactive substance use. Patients with schizophrenia were primarily affected by the diagnoses \"Ineffective Coping,\" \"Impaired Social Interaction\" and \"Chronic Low Self-Esteem.\" This study demonstrates the complexity and diversity of nursing care in inpatient psychiatric settings. Patients' gender, age and psychiatric diagnoses and settings are a key factor for specific nursing diagnosis. There are tendencies for relationships between certain nursing diagnosis and patient characteristics in psychiatric adult inpatients. This enhances the specific, extended\n\nVytra Healthcare forms a frequent user plan focusing on wellness.\n\nPubMed\n\nHerreria, J\n\n1998-01-01\n\nVytra Healthcare's \"Constellation Club\" marks the first time the concept of wellness has been applied to health plans.

Our aim was to assess defects in the GH1 in short Brazilian children with different GH secretion status. We selected 135 children with postnatal short stature and classified according to the highest GH peak at stimulation tests in: severe IGHD (peak GHâ¤3.3 Î¼g/L, n=38, all with normal pituitary magnetic resonance imaging); GH peak between 3.3 and 10 Î¼g/L (n=76); and GH peak >10 Î¼g/L (n=21). The entire coding region of GH1 was sequenced and complete GH1 deletions were assessed by Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification and restriction enzyme digestion. Patients with severe IGHD had a higher frequency of consanguinity, were shorter, had lower levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, and despite treatment with lower GH doses had a greater growth response than patients with GH peak â¥3.3 Î¼g/L. Mutations were found only in patients with severe IGHD (GH peak<3.3 Î¼g/L). Eight patients had autosomal recessive IGHD: Seven patients were homozygous for GH1 deletions and one patient was compound heterozygous for a GH1 deletion and the novel c.171+5G>C point mutation in intron 2, predicted to abolish the donor splice site. Only one patient, who was heterozygous for the c.291+1G>T mutation located at the universal donor splice site of intron 3 and predicts exon 3 skipping, had an autosomal dominant form. Analysis of GH1 in a cohort of Brazilian patients revealed that the autosomal recessive form of IGHD was more common than the dominant one, and both were found only in severe IGHD.

Asperger-Syndrome is rarely reported in adult ADHD and commonly little attention is paid to this possible comorbidity. We investigated 53 adult ADHD-patients which visited our out patient clinic for first ADHD-diagnosis (17 females, 36 males; range of age: 18-56 years) for the frequency of a comorbid Asperger-Syndrome. Diagnosis of this autism-spectrum disorder was confirmed by applying the appropriate DSM-IV-criteria. Additionally we tested the power of the two screening-instruments \"Autism-spectrum quotient\" (AQ) and \"Empathy quotient\" (EQ) by Baron-Cohen for screening Asperger-Syndrome in adult ADHD. Eight ADHD-patients were diagnosed with a comorbid Asperger-Syndrome (15.1%). The difference in AQ- and EQ-scores between pure ADHD-patients and comorbid patients was analysed, showing significantly higher scores in AQ and significant lower scores in EQ in comorbid patients. Results show that the frequency of Asperger-Syndrome seems to be substantially increased in adult ADHD (versus the prevalence of 0.06% in the general population), indicating that investigators of adult ADHD should also be attentive to autism-spectrum disorders. Especially the AQ seems to be a potential screening instrument for Asperger-Syndrome in adult ADHD-patients.\n\nPsychiatric diagnoses in patients with burning mouth syndrome and atypical odontalgia referred from psychiatric to dental facilities\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTakenoshita, Miho; Sato, Tomoko; Kato, Yuichi; Katagiri, Ayano; Yoshikawa, Tatsuya; Sato, Yusuke; Matsushima, Eisuke; Sasaki, Yoshiyuki; Toyofuku, Akira\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) and atypical odontalgia (AO) are two conditions involving chronic oral pain in the absence of any organic cause. Psychiatrically they can both be considered as âsomatoform disorderâ. From the dental point of view, however, the two disorders are quite distinct. BMS is a burning or stinging sensation in the mouth in association with a normal mucosa whereas AO is most frequently associated with a continuous pain in the teeth or in a tooth socket after extraction in the absence of any identifiable cause. Because of the absence of organic causes, BMS and AO are often regarded as psychogenic conditions, although the relationship between oral pain and psychologic factors is still unclear. Some studies have analyzed the psychiatric diagnoses of patients with chronic oral pain who have been referred from dental facilities to psychiatric facilities. No study to date has investigated patients referred from psychiatric facilities to dental facilities. Objective To analyze the psychiatric diagnoses of chronic oral pain patients, diagnosed with BMS and AO, and referred from psychiatric facilities to dental facilities. Study design Psychiatric diagnoses and disease conditions of BMS or AO were investigated in 162 patients by reviewing patientsâ medical records and referral forms. Psychiatric diagnoses were categorized according to the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision. Results The proportion of F4 classification (neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders) in AO patients was significantly higher than in BMS patients. BMS patients were more frequently given a F3 classification (mood/affective disorders). However, 50.8% of BMS patients and 33.3% of AO patients had no specific psychiatric diagnoses. Conclusion Although BMS and AO are both chronic pain disorders occurring in the absence of any organic cause, the psychiatric diagnoses of patients with BMS and AO differ\n\nFrequent users of rural primary care: comparisons with randomly selected users.\n\nPubMed\n\nMehl-Madrona, L E\n\n1998-01-01\n\nFrequent users of primary care have not been adequately characterized. The unique characteristics of this population was sought--why they come so often, what their care costs, and whether psychosocial factors play a role in their high utilization of health care. The billing system of a rural primary care clinic was used to find the frequency of visits for all patients attending the clinic for the previous 12 months. The 211 most frequent visitors were selected. A comparison group of 250 patients was drawn from the billing records using a random number generator. Charts were reviewed to compare diagnoses (by frequency), number of procedures, amount billed for care, amount received from those billings, number of psychotropic medications prescribed, and response to medication. A subgroup of each group was interviewed to confirm chart review findings and to inquire about personal reasons for coming to the clinic. Compared with patients who were random users, patients who were frequent users were more likely to come from the younger and older age groups, they averaged significantly more emergency department visits and visits to other specialists (P < 0.0001), and they had more mental health problems diagnosed (P < 0.01). Significantly more frequent users were insured by Medicaid and fewer were insured by Medicare. They had more detailed office visits and more laboratory tests. They received twice as much psychotherapy and had a higher percentage of problem-focused office visits. Chart audits and interviews of selected patients revealed that many nonmedical reasons were related to visits in addition to psychosocial stressors. Nonmedical factors are important among the most frequent users of a primary care clinic. Proposals to improve care for frequent users should consider the psychosocial needs of this population.\n\n[Case of interval form of carbon monoxide poisoning without increased carboxyhemoglobin level diagnosed by characteristic MR spectroscopy findings].\n\nPubMed\n\nKamisawa, Tomoko; Ikawa, Masamichi; Hamano, Tadanori; Nagata, Miwako; Kimura, Hirohiko; Yoneda, Makoto\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA 67-year-old man living alone was admitted for acute disturbance of consciousness during winter. He presented with semicoma, a decorticate posture, and exaggerated tendon reflexes of the limbs, but brainstem reflexes were intact. The carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level was normal in arterial blood gas on admission, and protein in cerebrospinal fluid was increased without pleocytosis. Brain MRI showed diffuse T2 high intensities in the deep white matter bilaterally without a contrast effect and abnormal T1 intensity in the pallidum. (1)H-MR spectroscopy (MRS) of the white matter lesion demonstrated findings suggesting demyelination as an increased choline peak, enhanced anaerobic metabolism as increased lactate and lipids peaks, and reduced neurons as a decreased N-acetylaspartate peak, which corresponded to delayed encephalopathy due to the interval form of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. The possibility of CO exposure due to coal briquette use 2 weeks before the symptomatic onset was indicated by his family, so he was diagnosed with CO poisoning. His consciousness slightly improved with corticosteroid therapy and repetitive hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but brain MRI and MRS findings did not improve. Characteristic MRS findings of leukoencephalopathy are helpful for diagnosing the interval form of CO poisoning in the case of a normal COHb level.\n\nGiant condyloma acuminata: Incidence among cases diagnosed as carcinoma of the penis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDavies, Sylvia W.\n\n1965-01-01\n\nTwenty-four cases of giant condyloma acuminata were found among 100 cases diagnosed as carcinoma of the penis. One of the 24 tumours showed early malignant change. The characteristic histological pattern of giant condyloma consists of broad processes composed of prickle cells associated with little keratinization. The malignant condylomas show, in comparison, a loss of prickle cell preponderance, increased basal cell activity and frequent keratinization, or may present as a solid papillary epithelioma forming broad sheets of uniform cells with many mitoses. The incidence of malignant change in the giant condyloma and the relationship between the benign and malignant tumours are discussed.

However, the preliminary experience with children who have undergone procedures such as \"daily\" intensive hemodiafiltration and nocturnal hemodialysis has been positive, with the allowance for unrestricted diets and fluid intake, the lack of need for phosphate binders, excellent metabolic and blood pressure control, and, in the case of hemodiafiltration, excellent growth. The provision of frequent daily hemodialysis with the NxStage System has also recently been introduced to pediatrics.

This form of PHPT represents 80% in developed countries. Although PHPT patients are asym-ptomatic, target organ (bone and kidney) involvement is frequently observed. Mild PHPT is associated with a reduction of bone mineral densityand, moreover, with increased risk of vertebral fractures. The extent of a patient evaluation and indications for parathyroidectomy are based on expert guidelines from 2014. Normocalcemic variant of PHPT has been recently recognized, possibly with higher prevalence in general population than the hypercalcemic form of PHPT. Normal but with respect to hypercalcemia inadequately high parathormon levels characterize normohormonal PHPT. If a hereditary form of PHPT is suspected, genetic testing is recommended. Although there are new clinical forms of PHPT, parathyroidectomy still represents the only curative approach to PHPT followed by substantial osteoprotective effect.Key words: asymptomatic form - normocalcemic form - normohormonal form - parathyroidectomy - primary hyperparathyroidism - recent guidelines for the management PHPT.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions: IDEA Early Childhood--Disclosure Avoidance\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCenter for IDEA Early Childhood Data Systems (DaSy), 2014\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis 2014 document is an adaptation of the 2012 release of \"Frequently Asked Questions--Disclosure Avoidance\" intended for K-12 audiences.

It, therefore, is essential that nurses in radiology departments be competent to care for all types of patients. Use of nursing classification systems can improve care by providing standardized language for documentation. We conducted a project that involved 25 patients undergoing interventional radiology procedures between August and October 2006 in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, to identify the most frequent North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) nursing diagnoses used and then compared the NANDA diagnoses to Perioperative Nursing Data Set diagnoses. The most frequent nursing diagnoses in the participants were anxiety, chronic pain, inefficient tissue perfusion-peripheral, deficient knowledge, and risk for falls. These results are similar to diagnoses that have been reported in outpatient centers. The NANDA and Perioperative Nursing Data Set diagnoses were found to be similar. Copyright 2010 AORN, Inc.

Thus, cumulative seasonal occurrence of diseases can be detected. From 2004 to 2010 we recorded 22,293 main diagnoses and DRGs at the clinic for trauma surgery. Injuries with the same localization and treatment were pooled. The most frequent injuries were concussion, followed by spinal and lower leg fractures. They showed no seasonal accumulation. Proximal fractures of the humerus occurred approx. 25% more often in winter and ankle fractures about 33% more frequently. The diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee is twice as high in the winter as in the summer. It has to be verified if logistic conclusions of these results can lead to more efficiency in a hospital. The underlying analysis is applicable for every hospital and poses a valid controlling tool.\n\nForms of Dystonia\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

An extensive workup was negative for infectious causes and she was subsequently diagnosed with anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis is a highly lethal but treatable form of autoimmune encephalitis that has recently been characterized.

Retrospective analysis of hospital case records. Pediatric nephrology department of a tertiary referral pediatric hospital. 62 children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome and 35 children with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. Case records of children who were diagnosed as steroid-dependant or frequently-relapsing nephrotic syndrome from June 2004 to June 2011, were reviewed. Levamisole was given daily (2 mg/kg/d) along with tapering doses of alternate day steroids after remission on daily steroids. Levamisole was effective in 77.3% children with a better (80.6%) efficacy in frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. A total of 34 children completed 1 year follow-up post levamisole therapy. The cumulative mean (SD) steroid dose 1-year before therapy was 4109(1154) mg/m2 and 1-year post therapy was 661 (11) mg/m2 (P<0.001). The relapses were also less during the period of post-levamisole therapy. Levamisole is an effective alternative therapy in frequently relapsing and steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome.\n\n[Intravesical active prostate bleeding diagnosed in B-mode ultrasound].\n\nPubMed\n\nKirchgesner, T; Danse, E; Tombal, B\n\n2013-09-01\n\nHematuria is one of the most frequent minor complications after prostatic biopsy.

Cross-sectional study of patient-FP encounters for fatigue. Ten FP practices in southwestern Ontario. A total of 259 encounters involving 167 patients presenting to their FPs between March 1, 2006, and June 30, 2010, with concerns about fatigue. The frequency of psychological and social diagnoses made at the end of visits, and whether diagnoses were made by FPs at the end of the visits versus whether the code for fatigue remained. The associations between patient age, sex, fatigue presenting with other symptoms, or the presence of previous chronic conditions and the outcomes was tested. Psychosocial diagnoses were made 23.9% of the time. Among psychosocial diagnoses made, depressive disorder and anxiety disorder or anxiety state were diagnosed more often in women (P = .048). Slightly less than 30% of the time, the cause of patients' fatigue remained undiagnosed at the end of the encounter. A diagnosis was made more often in men. Causes of fatigue frequently remain undiagnosed; however, when there is a diagnosis, psychosocial diagnoses are common. Therefore, it would be appropriate for FPs to screen for psychosocial issues when their patients present with fatigue, unless some other diagnosis is evident. Depression and anxiety could be considered particularly among female patients with fatigue.

The aim of this study is to compare patients given a diagnosis of GORD with those diagnosed with heartburn. Data from the UK General Practice Research Database were extracted for patients newly diagnosed with heartburn (n = 1841) or GORD (n = 5318) in 1996. Patient characteristics, morbidity, healthcare use and prescribed treatments were compared using unconditional logistic regression analysis. GORD was diagnosed more frequently than heartburn (3.2 vs. 1.1 per 1000 patient-years). A diagnosis of GORD was less likely among females (odds ratio (OR): 0.8; confidence interval (CI): 0.7-0.9), smokers (OR: 0.8; CI: 0.7-0.9) and patients who consulted their physician frequently (OR: 0.8; CI: 0.7-0.9). There was a wide distribution in the ratio of GORD-to-heartburn diagnoses between primary care practices (mean 2.9; range 0-infinity). GORD patients were more likely to receive proton pump inhibitors (OR: 2.9; CI: 2.6-3.4), but 24% of GORD patients and 40% of heartburn patients received no acid-suppressive treatment in the month after diagnosis. Several factors influenced the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms by primary care physicians. Further research is needed to aid the diagnosis of GORD in primary care.\n\nAssociations among Major Psychiatric Diagnoses.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWolf, Abraham W.; And Others\n\n1988-01-01\n\nExamined the frequency and associations of multiple diagnoses in 205 psychiatric inpatients, assessing past and current episodes of illness.

Here we describe a case of an adolescent male who presented with clubbing and polyarthralgia. On evaluation with scintigraphy and SPECT-CT, he was diagnosed to have incomplete form of PHOA(skeletal manifestations without skin changes). The identification of incomplete form of primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy which can be easily misdiagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis is discussed here.\n\nNegative and Positive Association Rules Mining from Text Using Frequent and Infrequent Itemsets\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMahmood, Sajid; Shahbaz, Muhammad; Guergachi, Aziz\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAssociation rule mining research typically focuses on positive association rules (PARs), generated from frequently occurring itemsets. However, in recent years, there has been a significant research focused on finding interesting infrequent itemsets leading to the discovery of negative association rules (NARs). The discovery of infrequent itemsets is far more difficult than their counterparts, that is, frequent itemsets. These problems include infrequent itemsets discovery and generation of accurate NARs, and their huge number as compared with positive association rules. In medical science, for example, one is interested in factors which can either adjudicate the presence of a disease or write-off of its possibility. The vivid positive symptoms are often obvious; however, negative symptoms are subtler and more difficult to recognize and diagnose. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for discovering positive and negative association rules among frequent and infrequent itemsets. We identify associations among medications, symptoms, and laboratory results using state-of-the-art data mining technology.

Mucosal melanoma differs from cutaneous melanoma not only in terms of poorer clinical outcome but also on the molecular level having e.g. less BRAF and more frequent KIT mutations than cutaneous melanomas. For the majority of mucosal melanomas oncogenic driver mutations remain unknown. In our study, 75 tumor tissues from patients diagnosed with mucosal melanoma were analyzed, applying a targeted next generation sequencing panel covering 29 known recurrently mutated genes in melanoma. NF1 and RAS mutations were identified as the most frequently mutated genes occurring in 18.3% and 16.9% of samples, respectively. Mutations in BRAF were identified in 8.4% and KIT in 7.0% of tumor samples. Our study identifies NF1 as the most frequently occurring driver mutation in mucosal melanoma. RAS alterations, consisting of NRAS and KRAS mutations, were the second most frequent mutation type. BRAF and KIT mutations were rare with frequencies below 10% each. Our data indicate that in mucosal melanomas RAS/NF1 alterations are frequent, implying a significant pathogenetic role for MAPK and potentially PI3K pathway activation in these tumors.\n\nTargeted next generation sequencing of mucosal melanomas identifies frequent NF1 and RAS mutations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCosgarea, Ioana; Ugurel, Selma; Sucker, Antje; Livingstone, Elisabeth; Zimmer, Lisa; Ziemer, Mirjana; Utikal, Jochen; Mohr, Peter; Pfeiffer, Christiane; PfÃ¶hler, Claudia; Hillen, Uwe; Horn, Susanne; Schadendorf, Dirk\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPurpose Mucosal melanoma represents ~1% of all melanomas, frequently having a poor prognosis due to diagnosis at a late stage of disease.

Children (10- to 12-year-olds) practiced a soccer throw-in task and were provided feedback about movement form. The feedback statements, provided either after every (100%) or every third (33%) practice trial, were similar in content but induced either an internal focus (body-movement related) or external focus (movement-effect related). The results demonstrated that learning of the movement form was enhanced by external-focus feedback after every trial (100%) relative to external-focus feedback after every third trial (33%) or internal-focus feedback (100%, 33%), as demonstrated by immediate and delayed transfer tests without feedback. There was no difference between the two internal-focus feedback groups. These findings indicate that the attentional focus induced by feedback is an important factor in determining the effectiveness of different feedback frequencies. We argue that the informational properties of feedback cannot sufficiently account for these and related findings, and suggest that the attentional role of feedback be given greater consideration in future studies.\n\nFrequent Itemset Hiding Algorithm Using Frequent Pattern Tree Approach\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAlnatsheh, Rami\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA problem that has been the focus of much recent research in privacy preserving data-mining is the frequent itemset hiding (FIH) problem.

It was conducted a descriptive exploratory study involving 83 mothers and their babies in the period of February to April 2011. Data were collected by means of an instrument based on the Theory of Basic Human Needs and, after statistical analysis, presented in tables. The results showed that the most frequent nursing diagnosis was Effective breastfeeding, identified in 65 (78.3%) cases. It is estimated that the nursing diagnoses related to breastfeeding can contribute to nursing care so that it can be more targeted, in order to promote a more qualified, effective and human care.\n\nThe recognition of diagnosable psychiatric disorders in suicide cases' last medical contacts.\n\nPubMed\n\nPan, Yi-Ju; Lee, Ming-Been; Chiang, Hung-Chi; Liao, Shih-Cheng\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study is to examine physicians' awareness of diagnosable psychiatric disorders in suicide cases' last medical contacts (MCs). The contact rates and proportions of both psychiatric and somatic diagnoses in a national cohort of suicide subjects (N=3468) in Taiwan seeking psychiatric or nonpsychiatric medical services within 1 month and 1 year preceding death were examined. The overall rates of MCs were 72.6% within 1 month and 89.2% within 1 year preceding suicide. While around 99.9% of the suicide subjects who contacted psychiatrists within 1 month preceding death were diagnosed as having psychiatric disorders, only 19.7% of those visiting nonpsychiatric physicians had psychiatric diagnoses. Suicide subjects, however, frequently complained of somatic symptoms, for example, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache/dizziness and back problem during their contacts with nonpsychiatric physicians within 1 month preceding death. Despite the high rates of MCs preceding suicide, the majority of suicide subjects were not diagnosed. Emphasizing psychosomatic manifestations of psychiatric disorders in physician education programs may help enhance the awareness of psychiatric disorders/suicide risk in clinical settings.\n\nFive cases of neurocysticercosis diagnosed in Sydney.\n\nPubMed\n\nWalker, J; Chen, S; Packham, D; McIntyre, P\n\n1991-12-01\n\nCysticercosis, once rare in Australia, is now more frequently diagnosed. This change reflects the countries of origin of new immigrants and the destinations of Australians travelling. Five cases of neurocysticercosis diagnosed at Westmead Hospital in Sydney are described. Two involved Australians, a father and son who had visited eastern and southeastern Asia 10 years before presentation. The other three included immigrants from Chile and India and a visitor from Timor. Ages ranged from 5 to 57 years. Three individuals presented after focal seizures involving the upper limb, one had a long standing history of neurological dysfunction and one suffered from persistent headaches. In all cases computed tomographic scanning (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed cystic brain lesions and three of the five were seropositive as well. Four were treated with praziquantel and in one the lesions regressed significantly following treatment. However, the lesion in one case had decreased in size prior to treatment and that in the untreated individual also became smaller.\n\n[Clinical analysis of 138 multiple primary cancers diagnosed of digestive system malignant tumor initially].\n\nPubMed\n\nLyu, J M; Xiong, H C; Wu, B; Zhou, X Q; Hu, J\n\n2018-02-23\n\nObjective: To study the clinical characteristics, strategy of treatment and prognosis of multiple primary cancers(MPC) diagnosed of digestive system malignant tumor firstly. Methods: From January, 2000 to December, 2015, the clinical, follow-up and prognostic data of 138 MPC patients diagnosed of digestive system malignant tumor firstly were retrospectively analyzed. Results: 138 cases were found in 10 580 cases with malignant tumors, and the incidence was 1.30%. There were 129 cases of duplex primary cancers, 8 cases of triple primary cancers and 1 case of quintuple primary cancers. The repetitive primary cancer was occurred in digestive system (61cases, 44.2%) most frequently, with the next in respiratory system (46 cases, 33.3%). 52.2% (72 cases) suffered second primary cancer in 2 years after first primary cancer diagnosed, and 75.4% (104 cases) in 5 years. The median overall survival in patients with all cancer lesions radically treated was 168 months, better than any other treatment (68 months, P <0.05). Conclusions: The second primary cancers of MPC cases initially diagnosed of digestive system malignant tumor most frequently occurred in the digestive system and respiratory system. More concern should be attracted in follow-up, especially in the first 5 years. The key to improve patient' prognosis was radical treatment to every primary cancer.\n\nEpidemiologic analysis of an urban, public emergency department's frequent users.\n\nPubMed\n\nMandelberg, J H; Kuhn, R E; Kohn, M A\n\n2000-06-01\n\nTo determine how the demographic, clinical, and utilization characteristics of emergency department (ED) frequent users differ from those of other ED patients. A cross-sectional and retrospective cohort study was performed using a database of all 348,858 visits to the San Francisco General Hospital ED during a five-year period (July 1, 1993, to June 30, 1998). A \"frequent user\" visited the ED five or more times in a 12-month period. Frequent users constituted 3.9% of ED patients but accounted for 20.5% of ED visits. The relative risk (RR) of frequent use was high among patients who were homeless (RR = 4.5), African American (RR = 1.8), and Medi-Cal sponsored (RR = 2.1). Frequent users were more likely to be seen for alcohol withdrawal (RR = 4.4), alcohol dependence (RR = 3.4), and alcohol intoxication (RR = 2.4). Frequent users were also more likely to visit for exacerbations of chronic conditions, including sickle cell anemia (RR = 8.0), renal failure (RR = 3.6), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR = 3.3). They were less likely to visit for all forms of trauma (RR = 0.43). Survival analysis showed that only 38% of frequent users for one year remained frequent users the next year. However, 56% of frequent users for two consecutive years remained frequent users in the third year. Frequent use of the ED reflects the urban social problems of homelessness, poverty, alcohol abuse, and chronic illness. Frequent use of the ED shows a high rate of decline from one year to the next. This rate of decline slows after the first year and suggests the existence of a smaller group of chronic frequent users.\n\nThe challenge of diagnosing focal hand dystonia in musicians.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosset-Llobet, J; Candia, V; FÃ bregas i Molas, S; Dolors RosinÃ©s i Cubells, D; Pascual-Leone, A\n\n2009-07-01\n\nTo most clinicians, medical problems in musicians, particularly those concerning focal hand dystonia, constitute an unfamiliar domain difficult to manage. The latter can importantly influence diagnostics and the course of treatment. The purpose of this study was to enlighten the issue and to identify possible problems in diagnosing musicians' cramp within the Spanish medical community. We used a brief questions' catalog and clinical histories of 665 musicians seen at our clinic for performing artists. We analyzed patients' diagnosis records in 87 cases of focal hand dystonia (13.1%). In so doing, we surveyed previous diagnoses and diverse treatments prescriptions prior to referral to our clinic. Referrals came primarily from orthopaedists and neurologists. The 52.9% arrived at our clinic without a diagnosis or a suspicion of suffering from focal dystonia. The most frequently attempted diagnoses other than musicians' dystonia included nerve compression, tendonitis and trigger fingers. Commonly prescribed treatments included rest, various surgical procedures, physiotherapy and oral anti-inflammatory medication. This data depicts the diagnostic challenges of medical professionals may encounter when confronted with musician's focal dystonia.\n\nIdentifying core NANDA-I nursing diagnoses, NIC interventions, NOC outcomes, and NNN linkages for heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Hyejin\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThe purpose of the study was to identify the core nursing diagnoses, interventions, outcomes, and linkages using standardized nursing terminologies for patients with heart failure (HF). For this study a retrospective descriptive design was used. The frequently used NANDA-I, NIC, NOC, and NNN linkages were identified through 272 inpatient records of patients discharged with HF in a midwestern community. The findings indicate that the top 10 NANDA-I, NIC, and NOC accounted for more than 50% of nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes. The most frequently used top 10 NNN linkages were identified for patients with HF. The identified core NANDA-I, NIC, NOC, and NNN linkages for HF from this study provide scope of practice of nurses working in HF clinics.

For purposes of this study we divided frequent users into the following groups: low- frequent users (4 EMS transports in 2012), medium-frequent users (5 to 6 EMS transports in 2012), high-frequent users (7 to 10 EMS transports in 2012) and super-frequent users (11 or more EMS transports in 2012). Overall, we identified 539 individuals as frequent users. For all groups of EMS frequent users (i.e. low, medium, high and super) one or more hospital admissions, receiving a referral for follow-up care upon discharge, and having no insurance were found to be statistically significant with frequent EMS use (P<0.05). Within the diagnostic categories, 41.61% of super-frequent users had a diagnosis of \"primarily substance abuse/misuse\" and among low-frequent users a majority, 53.33%, were identified as having a \"reoccurring (medical) diagnosis.\" Lastly, relative risk ratios for the highest group of users, super-frequent users, were 3.34 (95% CI [1.90-5.87]) for obtaining at least one referral for follow-up care, 13.67 (95% CI [5.60-33.34]) for having four or more hospital admissions and 5.95 (95% CI [1.80-19.63]) for having a diagnoses of primarily substance abuse/misuse. Findings from this study demonstrate that among low- and medium-frequent users a majority of patients are using EMS for reoccurring medical conditions. This could potentially be avoided with better care management. In addition, this study adds to the current literature that illustrates a strong correlation between substance abuse/misuse and high/super-frequent EMS use. For the subgroup analysis among individuals 65 years of age and older, we did not find any of the independent variables included in our model to be statistically significant with frequent EMS use.\n\nA French multicenter study of over 700 patients with 22q11 deletions diagnosed using FISH or aCGH.\n\nPubMed\n\nPoirsier, CÃ©line; Besseau-Ayasse, Justine; Schluth-Bolard, Caroline; Toutain, JÃ©rÃ´me; Missirian, Chantal; Le Caignec, CÃ©dric; Bazin, Anne; de Blois, Marie Christine; Kuentz, Paul; Catty, Marie; Choiset, AgnÃ¨s; Plessis, Ghislaine; Basinko, Audrey; Letard, Pascaline; Flori, Elisabeth; Jimenez, MÃ©lanie; Valduga, MylÃ¨ne; Landais, Emilie; Lallaoui, Hakima; Cartault, FranÃ§ois; Lespinasse, James; Martin-Coignard, Dominique; Callier, Patrick; Pebrel-Richard, CÃ©line; Portnoi, Marie-France; Busa, Tiffany; Receveur, Aline; Amblard, Florence; Yardin, Catherine; Harbuz, Radu; Prieur, Fabienne; Le Meur, Nathalie; Pipiras, Eva; Kleinfinger, Pascale; Vialard, FranÃ§ois; Doco-Fenzy, Martine\n\n2016-06-01\n\nAlthough 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most recurrent human microdeletion syndrome associated with a highly variable phenotype, little is known about the condition's true incidence and the phenotype at diagnosis. We performed a multicenter, retrospective analysis of postnatally diagnosed patients recruited by members of the Association des CytogÃ©nÃ©ticiens de Langue FranÃ§aise (the French-Speaking Cytogeneticists Association). Clinical and cytogenetic data on 749 cases diagnosed between 1995 and 2013 were collected by 31 French cytogenetics laboratories. The most frequent reasons for referral of postnatally diagnosed cases were a congenital heart defect (CHD, 48.6%), facial dysmorphism (49.7%) and developmental delay (40.7%). Since 2007 (the year in which array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was introduced for the routine screening of patients with intellectual disability), almost all cases have been diagnosed using FISH (96.1%). Only 15 cases (all with an atypical phenotype) were diagnosed with aCGH; the deletion size ranged from 745 to 2904âkb. The deletion was inherited in 15.0% of cases and was of maternal origin in 85.5% of the latter. This is the largest yet documented cohort of patients with 22q11.2DS (the most commonly diagnosed microdeletion) from the same population. French cytogenetics laboratories diagnosed at least 108 affected patients (including fetuses) per year from among a national population of â¼66 million. As observed for prenatal diagnoses, CHDs were the most frequently detected malformation in postnatal diagnoses. The most common CHD in postnatal diagnoses was an isolated septal defect.\n\nQueer diagnoses revisited: The past and future of homosexuality and gender diagnoses in DSM and ICD.\n\nPubMed\n\nDrescher, Jack\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association (APA) recently completed a several year process of revising the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). During that time, there were objections raised to retaining DSM's gender identity disorder diagnoses and calls to remove them, just as homosexuality had been removed from DSM-II in 1973. At the conclusion of the DSM-5 revision process, the gender diagnoses were retained, albeit in altered form and bearing the new name of 'gender dysphoria'. The author of this paper was a member of the DSM-5 Workgroup on Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders and presently serves on the WHO Working Group on Sexual Disorders and Sexual Health. Both groups faced similar tasks: reconciling patients' needs for access to care with the stigma of being given a psychiatric diagnosis. The differing nature of the two diagnostic manuals led to two different outcomes. As background, this paper updates the history of homosexuality and the gender diagnoses in the DSM and in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) as well as what is expected to happen to the homosexuality and gender diagnoses following the current ICD-11 revision process.\n\n[Would the Screening of Common Mental Disorders in Primary-Care Health Services Hyper-Frequent Patients Be Useful?].\n\nPubMed\n\nRincÃ³n-Hoyos, HernÃ¡n G; LÃ³pez, MÃ©rida R RodrÃ­guez; Ruiz, Ana MarÃ­a Villa; HernÃ¡ndez, Carlos Augusto; Ramos, Martha LucÃ­a\n\n2012-12-01\n\nHyper-frequentation in health services is a problem for patients, their families and the institutions. This study is aimed at determining the frequency and characteristics of common mental disorders in hyper-frequent patients showing vague symptoms and signs at a primary healthcare service during the year 2007 in the city of Cali (Colombia). Cross sectional. The most frequent mental disorders in hyper-frequent patients were detected through a telephone interview which included several modules of the PRIME MD instrument. In general, healthcare service hyper-frequenters are working women, 38,7-year old in average. Basically, the consultation is due to cephalalgia but they also exhibit a high prevalence of common mental disorders (somatization, depression and anxiety) not easily diagnosed by physicians in primary care. Expenses for additional health activities generated by these patients are attributed basically to medical consultation and required procedures. Considering hyper-frequenters in health care services as a risk group in terms of common mental disorders involves screening as an efficient strategy to prevent abuse in service use and to improve satisfaction with the attention received.

Data were obtained from a 2010 telephone survey of a population-based sample of 113,936 adults in 20 states. Respondents were asked how often they did not get enough rest or sleep and if they had ever received a diagnosis of an anxiety or depressive disorder. Frequent insufficient sleep was defined as insufficient rest or sleep during â¥ 14 of the past 30 days. Frequent insufficient sleep was reported by 27.0% of the sample and was significantly more common (p<.05) among respondents who reported both anxiety and depressive disorders (48.6%), depressive disorders only (39.0%), or anxiety only (37.5%) than among adults who reported neither disorder (23.1%). Frequent insufficient sleep is associated with depressive and anxiety disorders, and the odds of the sleep disorder are increased when both classes of psychiatric disorders are diagnosed.\n\nIdentifying nursing interventions associated with the accuracy used nursing diagnoses for patients with liver cirrhosis 1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGimenes, Fernanda Raphael Escobar; Motta, Ana Paula Gobbo; da Silva, PatrÃ­cia Costa dos Santos; Gobbo, Ana Flora FogaÃ§a; Atila, Elisabeth; de Carvalho, Emilia Campos\n\n2017-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Objective: to identify the nursing interventions associated with the most accurate and frequently used NANDA International, Inc. (NANDA-I) nursing diagnoses for patients with liver cirrhosis. Method: this is a descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study. Results: a total of 12 nursing diagnoses were evaluated, seven of which showed high accuracy (IVC â¥ 0.8); 70 interventions were identified and 23 (32.86%) were common to more than one diagnosis. Conclusion: in general, nurses often perform nursing interventions suggested in the NIC for the seven highly accurate nursing diagnoses identified in this study to care patients with liver cirrhosis. Accurate and valid nursing diagnoses guide the selection of appropriate interventions that nurses can perform to enhance patient safety and thus improve patient health outcomes.\n\nDifferentially Private Frequent Subgraph Mining\n\nPubMed Central\n\nXu, Shengzhi; Xiong, Li; Cheng, Xiang; Xiao, Ke\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMining frequent subgraphs from a collection of input graphs is an important topic in data mining research. However, if the input graphs contain sensitive information, releasing frequent subgraphs may pose considerable threats to individual's privacy. In this paper, we study the problem of frequent subgraph mining (FGM) under the rigorous differential privacy model. We introduce a novel differentially private FGM algorithm, which is referred to as DFG. In this algorithm, we first privately identify frequent subgraphs from input graphs, and then compute the noisy support of each identified frequent subgraph. In particular, to privately identify frequent subgraphs, we present a frequent subgraph identification approach which can improve the utility of frequent subgraph identifications through candidates pruning. Moreover, to compute the noisy support of each identified frequent subgraph, we devise a lattice-based noisy support derivation approach, where a series of methods has been proposed to improve the accuracy of the noisy supports. Through formal privacy analysis, we prove that our DFG algorithm satisfies Îµ-differential privacy. Extensive experimental results on real datasets show that the DFG algorithm can privately find frequent subgraphs with high data utility.

FÃ bregas i; Dolors RosinÃ©s i Cubells, D.; Pascual-Leone, A.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground and purpose To most clinicians, medical problems in musicians, particularly those concerning focal hand dystonia, constitute an unfamiliar domain difficult to manage. The latter can importantly influence diagnostics and the course of treatment. The purpose of this study was to enlighten the issue and to identify possible problems in diagnosing musiciansâ cramp within the Spanish medical community. Methods We used a brief questionsâ catalog and clinical histories of 665 musicians seen at our clinic for performing artists. We analyzed patientsâ diagnosis records in 87 cases of focal hand dystonia (13.1%). In so doing, we surveyed previous diagnoses and diverse treatments prescriptions prior to referral to our clinic. Results Referrals came primarily from orthopaedists and neurologists. The 52.9% arrived at our clinic without a diagnosis or a suspicion of suffering from focal dystonia. The most frequently attempted diagnoses other than musiciansâ dystonia included nerve compression, tendonitis and trigger fingers. Commonly prescribed treatments included rest, various surgical procedures, physiotherapy and oral anti-inflammatory medication. Conclusions This data depicts the diagnostic challenges of medical professionals may encounter when confronted with musicianâs focal dystonia.

ALD is due to mutation of a gene located in Xq28 that encodes a peroxisomal transporter protein of unknown function. The most common phenotype of ALD is the cerebral form (45%) that develops in boys between 5-12 yr. Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) involves the spinal cord and peripheral nerves in young adults (35%). Adrenal insufficiency (Addison`s disease) is frequently associated with AMN or cerebral ALD and may remain the only clinical expressionmoreÂ Â» of ALD (8% of cases). The prevalence of ALD among adults with Addison`s disease remains unknown. To evaluate this prevalence, we performed biochemical analysis of very long chain fatty acids in 14 male patients (age ranging from 12-45 yr at diagnosis) previously diagnosed as having primary idiopathic adrenocortical insufficiency. In 5 of 14 patients (35%), elevated plasma concentrations of very long chain fatty acids were detected. None of these patients had adrenocortical antibodies. By electrophysiological tests and magnetic resonance imaging it was determined that two patients had cerebral ALD, one had adrenomyeloneuropathy with cerebral involvement, and two had preclinical AMN. Our data support the hypothesis that ALD is a frequent cause of idiopathic Addison`s disease in children and adults. 30 refs., 5 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nFrequent users of the Royal Flying Doctor Service primary clinic and aeromedical services in remote New South Wales: a quality study.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarne, David L; Perkins, David A; Boreland, Frances T; Lyle, David M\n\nTo examine activity patterns of the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia (RFDS) in far western New South Wales and to determine whether frequent use of RFDS services, particularly emergency evacuations, is a useful indicator of patients who may benefit from care planning and review. We conducted a retrospective audit of the RFDS South Eastern Section's Broken Hill patient database. Patients with a residential address in the study area who had accessed at least one RFDS medical service between 1 July 2000 and 30 June 2005 were included in the study. Number of evacuations, clinic consultations and remote consultations; clinic usage by frequent evacuees; number of primary diagnoses recorded for frequent evacuees; number of frequent users who might benefit from multidisciplinary care or specialist shared care. Between July 2000 and June 2005, the number of residents requiring evacuation or remote consultations declined by 26% and 19%, respectively, and the number of residents accessing clinics declined by 6%. (Over the same period, the population of the study area fell by about 24%.) Of the 78 patients who were identified as frequent users of the evacuation service (> or = 3 evacuations/year), 34 had three or more primary diagnoses recorded; 15 were infrequent or non-users of the clinics (< or = 3 attendances/year); 53 may have benefited from multidisciplinary care, and 41 from specialist shared care. Simple, practical clinical review systems can help health care organisations in rural and remote communities to achieve better outcomes by identifying patients who may benefit from planned care.\n\nProstate cancer incidence and newly diagnosed patient profile in Spain in 2010.\n\nPubMed\n\nCÃ³zar, JosÃ© M; MiÃ±ana, Bernardino; GÃ³mez-Veiga, Francisco; RodrÃ­guez-AntolÃ­n, Alfredo; Villavicencio, Humberto; Cantalapiedra, Arancha; Pedrosa, Emilio\n\n2012-12-01\n\nWhat's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Prostate cancer (PCa) accounts for 12% of newly diagnosed cases of cancer in Europe. It is one of the most frequently diagnosed tumours in the developed world. Since the introduction of prostate specific antigen as a test for early detection of PCa, the rate of diagnosis has increased significantly and specific mortality has reduced in most western countries. Most of the data on the incidence of PCa are obtained from population-based cancer registries which frequently do not cover the whole population. This first national hospital-based PCa registry aims not only to estimate the incidence of the disease but to ascertain the clinical profile of newly diagnosed PCa patients, a useful tool for evaluating the impact of the disease and its socio-health management. â¢ To estimate the 2010 incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) in Spain. â¢ To describe the clinical profile of newly diagnosed cases using a nationwide hospital-based registry. â¢ This was a national epidemiological observational study in 25 public hospitals with a specific reference population according to the National Health System. â¢ Sociodemographic and clinical variables of all newly diagnosed, histopathologically confirmed PCa cases were collected in 2010, in the area of influence of each centre. Cases diagnosed in private practice were not collected (estimated nearly 10% in Spain). â¢ Data monitoring was external to guarantee quality and homogeneity. â¢ The age-standardized PCa incidence was determined based on the age distribution of the European standard population. â¢ In all, 4087 new cases of PCa were diagnosed for a reference population of 4933940 men (21.8% of the Spanish male population). â¢ The estimated age-standardized PCa incidence was 70.75 cases per 100000 men. â¢ Mean age at diagnosis was 69 years; 11.6% of patients presented with tumour-related symptoms and 39.5% with LUTS. Median PSA was 8 ng/mL.

This has been successfully extended to French (Chemla, Mintz, Bernal, & Christophe, 2009). In this paper, we show that, as for Dutch (Erkelens, 2009), frequent frames in German do not enable such accurate lexical categorization. This can be explained by the characteristics of German including a less restricted word order compared to English or French and the frequent use of some forms as both determiner and pronoun in colloquial German. Finally, we explore the relationship between the accuracy of frames and their potential utility and find that even some of those frames showing high token-based accuracy are of limited value because they are in fact set phrases with little or no variability in the slot position.

Yet, little work in this area has assessed whether trauma-related appraisals can differentiate complex trauma-related disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative identity disorder (DID). The current study evaluated whether any of 6 trauma-related appraisals distinguished adults diagnosed with DID from those diagnosed with PTSD. To accomplish this, we first examined the basic psychometric properties of a Dutch-translated short-form of the Trauma Appraisals Questionnaire (TAQ) in healthy control (n = 57), PTSD (n = 27) and DID (n = 12) samples. The short-form Dutch translation of the TAQ showed good internal reliability and criterion-related validity for all 6 subscales (betrayal, self-blame, fear, alienation, shame, anger). Of the 6 subscales, the alienation appraisal subscale specifically differentiated DID from PTSD, with the former group reporting more alienation. Abuse-related appraisals that emphasize disconnection from self and others may contribute to reported problems of memory and identity common in DID. The current findings suggest that addressing experiences of alienation may be particularly important in treatment for clients diagnosed with DID.

Methods A follow-back study of all preceding diagnoses in all patients aged 21â34Â years with a primary, first time diagnosis of BD (Nâ=â784) or SZ (Nâ=â1667) in 2008 to 2010. Data were taken from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register (DPCRR) including ICD-10 and ICD-8 diagnoses. Results The numbers of patients with any preceding diagnoses amounted to 69.3% in BD and 76.6% in SZ with affective disorders (excluding BD) being the most frequent preceding diagnosis (46.6 vs. 28.0%), followed by psychoses (PSY) other than SZ (14.2 vs. 41.5%, pâ<â.001), and substance use disorders (SUD) (16.1 vs. 26.9%, pâ<â.001). Reactions to severe stress were equally frequent in both samples (26.3 vs. 26.6%) as were personality disorders (21.8 vs. 22.4%) and ADHD (4.2 vs. 3.5%), whereas rates of conduct disorders (1.7 vs. 3.1%) were rather low in both samples. Very few of the preceding diagnoses had their onset in childhood and adolescence. Overall patients with SZ had a minor but statistically significant earlier onset of any psychiatric disorder compared to BD (mean age: 23.3 vs. 22.5, pâ<â.001). Regression analyses indicated that BD was associated with an increased risk of having experienced preceding affective disorders and ADHD, while SZ was associated with an increased risk of preceding substance use disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. Conclusions Specific developmental trajectories of preceding disorders were delineated for BD and SZ with affective disorders being more specific for BD and both SUD and PSY more specific to SZ. There are different patterns of vulnerability in terms of preceding diagnosis in young adults with BD and SZ.

The recommendations are based, in part, on anecdotal evidence that the diagnoses are infrequently used. To assess the assignment rates for SFD, FD, and related diagnoses among general medical inpatients. The National Hospital Discharge Survey was queried for instances of SFD and FD, along with related diagnoses identifying medical cases in which psychological factors play a role. Diagnoses of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder were queried for comparison purposes. The target diagnoses were assigned far less frequently than published prevalence and recognition rates suggest. Nearly half of the assigned target diagnoses were generic diagnoses (esp. physiological malfunction due to psychological factors) other than SFD or FD. However, the apparent degree of underassignment of the target diagnoses was not dramatically greater than the underassignment observed for major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. The results provide empirical support for the impression that physicians do not assign SFD and FD diagnoses in recognized cases, but do not strongly support the assertion that these diagnoses are uniquely problematic.

Knowledge of the relative frequency of neuromuscular diseases within the investigated population is important to allow the neurologist to perform the most appropriate diagnostic tests. To report the relative frequency of common neuromuscular diagnoses in a reference center. A 17-year chart review of patients with suspicion of myopathy. Among 3,412 examinations, 1,603 (46.98%) yielded confirmatory results: 782 (48.78%) underwent molecular studies, and 821 (51.21%) had muscle biopsies. The most frequent diagnoses were: dystrophinopathy 460 (28.70%), mitochondriopathy 330 (20.59%), spinal muscular atrophy 158 (9.86%), limb girdle muscular dystrophy 157 (9.79%), Steinert myotonic dystrophy 138 (8.61%), facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy 99 (6.17%), and other diagnoses 261 (16.28%). Using the presently-available diagnostic techniques in this service, a specific limb girdle muscular dystrophy subtype diagnosis was reached in 61% of the patients. A neuromuscular-appropriate diagnosis is important for genetic counseling, rehabilitation orientation, and early treatment of respiratory and cardiac complications.\n\nExercise recommendations in patients with newly diagnosed fibromyalgia.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, Brad; Spencer, Horace; Kortebein, Patrick\n\n2012-04-01\n\nTo evaluate exercise recommendations in patients newly diagnosed with fibromyalgia. A retrospective chart review. A public university rheumatology clinic. Patients newly diagnosed with fibromyalgia (N = 122). Frequency and type of exercise recommendations. The mean (standard deviation) age of these patients with fibromyalgia was 45 Â± 12 years; 91% were women. Exercise was recommended as part of the documented treatment plan in 47% of these patients (57/122); only 3 patients had a documented contraindication for exercise. Aquatic exercise was most frequently recommended (56% [32/57]), followed by combined aquatic-aerobic exercise (26% [15/57]), and, infrequently, aerobic exercise only (5% [3/57]); only 7% of these patients (4/57) were referred for physical therapy. The primary method of communication was verbal discussion (94% [54/57]). Although there is well-documented evidence that exercise is beneficial for patients with fibromyalgia, we found that less than half of patients with newly diagnosed fibromyalgia in our study were provided recommendations to initiate an exercise program as part of their treatment plan. Further investigation of these findings are warranted, including evaluation of other university and community rheumatology practices as well as that of other physicians caring for patients with fibromyalgia. However, our findings indicate that there appears to be an opportunity to provide more specific and practical education regarding the implementation of an exercise regimen for patients with newly diagnosed fibromyalgia. Physiatrists may be particularly well suited to manage the exercise component of patients with fibromyalgia because of their specialized training in exercise prescription.

However, the so-called isolated true undescended testis (ITUT) diagnosed at the third postnatal month seems to be an independent defect-entity, and this hypothesis was planned to confirm or reject in the study. The evaluation of birth outcomes and maternal socio-demographic data of cases with ITUT in the population-based large dataset of the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry. There was a higher rate of preterm birth and particularly of low birthweight in 2052 cases with ITUT compared to 24,814 population male controls without any defects. The rate of twins was not higher in cases with older mothers, higher birth order and lower socio-economic status. The comparison of data of boys with undescended testis diagnosed at birth found in the previous study and with ITUT in this study confirmed our hypothesis. Undescended testis can be differentiated into two subgroups: boys with frequent postnatal descensus mainly after preterm delivery and boys with ITUT without postnatal testis descensus with frequent intrauterine growth restriction, older mothers with higher birth order and low socio-economic status.\n\nMental disorder diagnoses among children and adolescents who use antipsychotic drugs.\n\nPubMed\n\nNesvÃ¥g, Ragnar; Hartz, Ingeborg; Bramness, JÃ¸rgen G; Hjellvik, Vidar; Handal, Marte; Skurtveit, Svetlana\n\n2016-09-01\n\nAntipsychotic drugs are used increasingly by children and adolescents and there is concern about off-label use. We aimed to study which substances, and for which mental disorder diagnoses, antipsychotic drugs were prescribed to 0-18-year-old boys and girls in Norway. Linked data from the national health registry for prescription drugs in 2010 and mental disorder diagnoses in 2008-2012 were used to study the prevalence of antipsychotic drug use, the type of antipsychotic drug substances used, mental disorder diagnoses in users and distribution of drugs per diagnostic category across gender. In total, 0.18% of Norwegian children and adolescents were prescribed antipsychotic drugs during 2010, of which there were more boys (0.23%) than girls (0.13%). Risperidone was the most frequently used substance among boys (57.4%) and girls (32.3%), followed by aripiprazole (19.4%) in boys and quetiapine (27.4%) in girls. The most common mental disorder diagnoses among male users were hyperkinetic (49.9%) and autism spectrum disorder (27.1%), while anxiety disorders (41.5%) and depressive illness (33.6%) were most common among female users. A schizophrenia-like psychosis diagnosis was given to 11.1% of the male and 18.2% of the female users. A hyperkinetic disorder was diagnosed among 56.9% and 52.4% of the male risperidone and aripiprazole users, respectively. Among female quetiapine users, 57.1% were diagnosed with anxiety disorders and 52.4% with depressive illness. These results demonstrate that children and adolescents who use antipsychotic drugs are predominantly diagnosed with non-psychotic mental disorders such as hyperkinetic disorder among boys and anxiety disorder or depressive illness among girls.

We included 959 patients undergoing CTA for the evaluation of suspected AMI. The final clinical diagnosis was used to determine the prevalence of ischemic and alternative diagnoses and to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of CTA. Prevalence of diagnoses by age, sex, and admission status was compared using Cochran-Armitage and Ï 2 tests. Prevalence was 18.8% (180/959) for AMI and 61.2% (587/959) for specific alternative diagnoses. In the remaining 20.0% (192/959), no clear clinical diagnosis was established. The most frequent alternative diagnoses were small-bowel obstruction (10.4%; 61/587), infectious colitis (8.7%; 51/587), pneumonia (6.5%; 38/587), cholecystitis (6.1%; 36/587), and diverticulitis (5.6%; 33/587). Prevalence of specific alternative diagnoses varied significantly according to both age (pÂ <Â .013) and admissions status (pÂ <Â 0.001). CTA had a sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing AMI of 89.4%/99.5% and for alternative diagnoses of 86.7%/96.9%, respectively. In the setting of suspected AMI, the prevalence of ischemic and alternative diagnoses varies significantly by age, sex, and admission status. CTA provides for rapid and non-invasive assessment of ischemic and alternative diagnoses with high diagnostic accuracy.\n\nAutopsy interrogation of emergency medicine dispute cases: how often are clinical diagnoses incorrect?\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Danyang; Gan, Rongchang; Zhang, Weidi; Wang, Wei; Saiyin, Hexige; Zeng, Wenjiao; Liu, Guoyuan\n\n2018-01-01\n\nEmergency medicine is a 'high risk' specialty. Some diseases develop suddenly and progress rapidly, and sudden unexpected deaths in the emergency department (ED) may cause medical disputes. We aimed to assess discrepancies between antemortem clinical diagnoses and postmortem autopsy findings concerning emergency medicine dispute cases and to figure out the most common major missed diagnoses. Clinical files and autopsy reports were retrospectively analysed and interpreted. Discrepancies between clinical diagnoses and autopsy diagnoses were evaluated using modified Goldman classification as major and minor discrepancy. The difference between diagnosis groups was compared with Pearson Ï 2 test. Of the 117 cases included in this study, 71 of cases (58 class I and 13 class II diagnostic errors) were revealed as major discrepancies (60.7%). The most common major diagnoses were cardiovascular diseases (54 cases), followed by pulmonary diseases, infectious diseases and so on. The difference of major discrepancy between the diagnoses groups was significant (p<0.001). Aortic dissection and myocardial infarction were the most common cause of death (15 cases for each disease) and the most common missed class I diagnoses (80% and 66.7% for each), higher than the average 49.6% of all class I errors of the study patients. High major disparities between clinical diagnoses and postmortem examinations exist in emergency medical disputes cases; acute aortic dissection and myocardial infarction are the most frequently major missed diagnoses that ED clinicians should pay special attention to in practice. This study reaffirmed the necessity and usefulness of autopsy in auditing death in EDs. Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

We used US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) electronic health records from 2001 to 2014 to examine incidence rates and sociodemographic risk factors for mental health diagnoses among 888â142 veterans. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was the most frequently diagnosed mental health condition across gender and age groups. Incidence rates for all mental health diagnoses were highest at ages 18 to 29 years and declined thereafter, with the exceptions of major depressive disorder (MDD) in both genders, and PTSD among women. Risk of incident bipolar disorder and MDD diagnoses were greater among women; risk of incident schizophrenia, and alcohol- and drug-use disorders diagnoses were greater in men. Compared with Whites, risk incident PTSD, MDD, and alcohol-use disorder diagnoses were lower at ages 18 to 29 years and higher at ages 45 to 64 years for both Hispanics and African Americans. Differentiating high-risk demographic and gender groups can lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of mental health diagnoses among veterans and other high-risk groups.\n\nCHD associated with syndromic diagnoses: peri-operative risk factors and early outcomes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLandis, Benjamin J.; Cooper, David S.; Hinton, Robert B.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCHD is frequently associated with a genetic syndrome. These syndromes often present specific cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular co-morbidities that confer significant peri-operative risks affecting multiple organ systems. Although surgical outcomes have improved over time, these co-morbidities continue to contribute substantially to poor peri-operative mortality and morbidity outcomes. Peri-operative morbidity may have long-standing ramifications on neurodevelopment and overall health. Recognising the cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular risks associated with specific syndromic diagnoses will facilitate expectant management, early detection of clinical problems, and improved outcomes â for example, the development of syndrome-based protocols for peri-operative evaluation and prophylactic actions may improve outcomes for the more frequently encountered syndromes such as 22q11 deletion syndrome. PMID:26345374\n\nFrequent Exertion and Frequent Standing at Work, by Industry and Occupation Group - United States, 2015.\n\nPubMed\n\nShockey, Taylor M; Luckhaupt, Sara E; Groenewold, Matthew R; Lu, Ming-Lun\n\n2018-01-12\n\nRepeated exposure to occupational ergonomic hazards, such as frequent exertion (repetitive bending or twisting) and frequent standing, can lead to injuries, most commonly musculoskeletal disorders (1). Work-related musculoskeletal disorders have been estimated to cost the United States approximately $2.6 billion in annual direct and indirect costs (2). A recent literature review provided evidence that prolonged standing at work also leads to adverse health outcomes, such as back pain, physical fatigue, and muscle pain (3). To determine which industry and occupation groups currently have the highest prevalence rates of frequent exertion at work and frequent standing at work, CDC analyzed data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Occupational Health Supplement (OHS) regarding currently employed adults in the United States. By industry, the highest prevalence of both frequent exertion and frequent standing at work was among those in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting industry group (70.9%); by occupation, the highest prevalence was among those in the construction and extraction occupation group (76.9%). Large differences among industry and occupation groups were found with regard to these ergonomic hazards, suggesting a need for targeted interventions designed to reduce workplace exposure.\n\nICD-10 classification in Danish child and adolescent psychiatry--have diagnoses changed after the introduction of ICD-10?\n\nPubMed\n\nMÃ¸ller, Lene Ruge; SÃ¸rensen, Merete Juul; Thomsen, Per Hove\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe aim was to test this in a nationwide register study of diagnoses used in child and adolescents psychiatry in Denmark. A larger number of different diagnoses were expected to be applied after the introduction of the 10th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Reflecting the time trend, we particularly expected an increase in the number of neuropsychiatric diagnoses. From the Danish Psychiatric Central Register data were drawn on clinical discharge diagnoses. All patients aged 0-15 years examined at psychiatric hospitals from 1995-2002 were included; 22,469 children and adolescents with a first contact were registered. The most frequent discharge diagnoses were pervasive development disorders (PDD; 11.9%), adjustment disorders (10.6%), conduct disorder (9.5%), emotional and anxiety disorders (7.6%), hyperkinetic disorders (7.3%), and specific developmental disorders (7.3%). We found a significant increase in the number of neuropsychiatric and affective diagnoses and a significant decrease in the number of adjustment, conduct and anxiety diagnoses during the study period. Of the 22,469 diagnoses, 45% were only partly specified according to ICD-10. Thirty-four per cent had diagnoses unspecified on the four-character level (Fxx.9) and 11% had Z-diagnoses. A larger number of different diagnoses and an increase in the use of neuropsychiatric diagnoses were seen after the introduction of ICD-10. Many diagnoses were only partly specified; consequently, a more detailed specification of the ICD-10 is still required.\n\nDirect Microscopy: A Useful Tool to Diagnose Oral Candidiasis in Children and Adolescents.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarty, Mathieu; Bourrat, Emmanuelle; Vaysse, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Bonner, Mark; Bailleul-Forestier, Isabelle\n\n2015-12-01\n\nOral candidiasis is one of the most common opportunistic fungal infections of the oral cavity in human. Among children, this condition represents one of the most frequent affecting the mucosa. Although most diagnoses are made based on clinical signs and features, a microbiological analysis is sometimes necessary. We performed a literature review on the diagnosis of oral candidiasis to identify the techniques most commonly employed in routine clinical practice. A Medline-PubMed search covering the last 10 years was performed. Microbiological techniques were used in cases requiring confirmation of the clinical diagnosis. In such cases, direct microscopy was the method most commonly used for diagnosing candidiasis. Direct microscopy appears as the method of choice for confirming clinical diagnosis and could become a routine chair-side technique.\n\nLow-Dose CT for Evaluation of Suspected Urolithiasis: Diagnostic Yield for Assessment of Alternative Diagnoses.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeinrich, Julius Matthias; Bannas, Peter; Regier, Marc; Keller, Sarah; Kluth, Luis; Adam, Gerhard; Henes, Frank Oliver\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the diagnostic yield of low-dose (LD) CT for alternative diagnoses in patients with suspected urolithiasis. In this retrospective study, we included 776 consecutive patients who underwent unenhanced abdominal CT for evaluation of suspected urolithiasis. All examinations were performed with an LD CT protocol; images were reconstructed using iterative reconstruction. The leading LD CT diagnosis was recorded for each patient and compared with the final clinical diagnosis, which served as the reference standard. The mean (Â± SD) effective dose of CT was 1.9 Â± 0.6 mSv. The frequency of urolithiasis was 82.5% (640/776). LD CT reached a sensitivity of 94.1% (602/640), a specificity of 100.0% (136/136), and an accuracy of 95.1% (738/776) for the detection of urolithiasis."
