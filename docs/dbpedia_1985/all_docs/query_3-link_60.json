One transition, with an apparent transition temperature (Tm) at 79.88Â°C, was detected in the thermogram of Î²-HaH in 20âmM HEPES buffer, containing 0.1âM NaCl, 5âmM CaCl2, and 5âmM MgCl2, pH 7.0, at scan rate of 1.0Â°Câminâ1. By means of successive annealing procedure, two individual transitions were identified in the thermogram of Î±D+N-HaH. Denaturation of both hemocyanins was found to be an irreversible process. The scan-rate dependence of the calorimetric profiles indicated that the thermal unfolding of investigated hemocyanins was kinetically controlled. The thermal denaturation of the isoforms Î²-HaH and Î±D+N-HaH was described by the two-state irreversible model, and parameters of the Arrhenius equation were calculated.

The polyionâs charge density and the counterion properties were considered as variables. The special attention was put to evaluate the contribution of electrostatic and hydrophobic effects to the properties studied. The contribution of the CH2 group of the polyionâs backbone to molar volumes and heat capacities was estimated. Synergistic effect between polyion and counterions was found.

The lamellar subgel/lamellar liquid-crystalline (Lc â LÎ±), lamellar gel/lamellar liquid-crystalline (LÎ² â LÎ±), and lamellar liquid-crystalline/lamellar gel (LÎ± â LÎ²) phase transitions proceed via coexistence of the initial and final phases with no detectable intermediates at scan rates 0.1 and 0.5Â°C/min. At constant temperature within the region of the LÎ² â LÎ± transition the ratio of the two coexisting phases was found to be stable for over 30 min. The state of stable phase coexistence was preceded by a 150-s relaxation taking place at constant temperature after termination of the heating scan in the transition region. While no intermediate structures were present in the coexistence region, a well reproducible multipeak pattern, with at least four prominent heat capacity peaks separated in temperature by 0.4-0.5Â°C, has been observed in the cooling transition (LÎ± â LÎ²) by calorimetry. The multipeak pattern became distinct with an increase of incubation time in the liquid-crystalline phase. It was also clearly resolved in the x-ray diffraction intensity versus temperature plots recorded at slow cooling rates. These data suggest that the equilibrium state of the LÎ± phase of hydrated DPPE is represented by a mixture of domains that differ in thermal behavior, but cannot be distinguished structurally by x-ray scattering.

The denaturation was irreversible, and the thermal transition recorded at scan rates of 0.5-1.5 K/min was significantly scan-rate dependent, indicating that the thermal denaturation was kinetically controlled. The absence of a protein-concentration effect on the thermal transition indicated that the denaturation was rate-limited by a mono-molecular process. From the analysis of the calorimetric thermograms, a one-step irreversible model well represented the thermal denaturation of the protein. The calorimetrically observed thermal transitions showed excellent coincidence with the turbidity transitions monitored by UV-absorption as well as with the unfolding transitions monitored by circular dichroism. The thermal denaturation of the protein was thus rate-limited by conformational unfolding, which was followed by a rapid irreversible formation of aggregates that produced the solution turbidity. It is thus important to note that the absence of the protein-concentration effect on the irreversible thermal denaturation does not necessarily means the absence of protein aggregation itself. The turbidity measurements together with differential scanning calorimetry in the irreversible thermal denaturation of the protein provided a very effective approach for understanding the mechanisms of the irreversible denaturation. The Arrhenius-equation parameters obtained from analysis of the thermal denaturation were compared with those of other proteins that have been reported to show the one-step irreversible thermal denaturation. Maltodextrin glucosidase had sufficiently high kinetic stability with a half-life of 68 days at a physiological temperature (37Â°C).\n\nSensitivity and systematics of calorimetric neutrino mass experiments\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNucciotti, A.; Cremonesi, O.; Ferri, E.\n\n2009-12-16\n\nA large calorimetric neutrino mass experiment using thermal detectors is expected to play a crucial role in the challenge for directly assessing the neutrino mass. We discuss and compare here two approaches for the estimation of the experimental sensitivity of such an experiment. The first method uses an analytic formulation and allows to obtain readily a close estimate over a wide range of experimental configurations. The second method is based on a Montecarlo technique and is more precise and reliable. The Montecarlo approach is then exploited to study some sources of systematic uncertainties peculiar to calorimetric experiments. Finally, the toolsmoreÂ Â» are applied to investigate the optimal experimental configuration of the MARE project.Â«Â less\n\nIrreversible Denaturation of Maltodextrin Glucosidase Studied by Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Circular Dichroism, and Turbidity Measurements\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGoyal, Megha; Chaudhuri, Tapan K.; Kuwajima, Kunihiro\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThermal denaturation of Escherichia coli maltodextrin glucosidase was studied by differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism (230 nm), and UV-absorption measurements (340 nm), which were respectively used to monitor heat absorption, conformational unfolding, and the production of solution turbidity.

A.; Elsenbeck, M.; Zastavker, Y. V.\n\n2009-04-19\n\nFormation of biological self-assemblies at all scales is a focus of studies in fields ranging from biology to physics to biomimetics. Understanding the physico-chemical properties of these self-assemblies may lead to the design of bio-inspired structures and technological applications. Here we examine self-assembled filamentous, helical ribbon, and crystal microstructures formed in chemically defined lipid concentrate (CDLC), a model system for cholesterol crystallization in gallbladder bile. CDLC consists of cholesterol, bilayer-forming amphiphiles, micelle-forming amphiphiles, and water. Phase contrast and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy indicate the presence of three microstructure types in all samples studied, and allow for an investigation ofmoreÂ Â» the structures' unique geometries. Additionally, confocal microscopy is used for qualitative assessment of surface and internal composition. To complement optical observations, calorimetric (differential-scanning and modulation) experiments, provide the basis for an in-depth understanding of collective and individual thermal behavior. Observed ''transition'' features indicate clustering and ''straightening'' of helical ribbons into short, increasingly thickening, filaments that dissolve with increasing temperature. These results suggest that all microstructures formed in CDLC may coexist in a metastable chemical equilibrium. Further investigation of the CDLC thermal profile should uncover the process of cholesterol crystallization as well as the unique design and function of microstructures formed in this system.Â«Â less\n\nEvaluation of the interaction of coumarins with biomembrane models studied by differential scanning calorimetry and Langmuir-Blodgett techniques.\n\nPubMed\n\nSarpietro, Maria Grazia; Giuffrida, Maria Chiara; Ottimo, Sara; Micieli, Dorotea; Castelli, Francesco\n\n2011-04-25\n\nThree coumarins, scopoletin (1), esculetin (2), and esculin (3), were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and Langmuir-Blodgett techniques to gain information about the interaction of these compounds with cellular membranes. Phospholipids assembled as multilamellar vesicles or monolayers (at the air-water interface) were used as biomembrane models. Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to study the interaction of these coumarins with multilamellar vesicles and to evaluate their absorption by multilamellar vesicles. These experiments indicated that 1-3 interact in this manner to different extents. The Langmuir-Blodgett technique was used to study the effect of these coumarins on the organization of phospholipids assembled as a monolayer. The data obtained were in agreement with those obtained in the calorimetric experiments.\n\nAccounting for apparent deviations between calorimetric and van't Hoff enthalpies.\n\nPubMed\n\nKantonen, Samuel A; Henriksen, Niel M; Gilson, Michael K\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn theory, binding enthalpies directly obtained from calorimetry (such as ITC) and the temperature dependence of the binding free energy (van't Hoff method) should agree. However, previous studies have often found them to be discrepant. Experimental binding enthalpies (both calorimetric and van't Hoff) are obtained for two host-guest pairs using ITC, and the discrepancy between the two enthalpies is examined. Modeling of artificial ITC data is also used to examine how different sources of error propagate to both types of binding enthalpies. For the host-guest pairs examined here, good agreement, to within about 0.4kcal/mol, is obtained between the two enthalpies. Additionally, using artificial data, we find that different sources of error propagate to either enthalpy uniquely, with concentration error and heat error propagating primarily to calorimetric and van't Hoff enthalpies, respectively. With modern calorimeters, good agreement between van't Hoff and calorimetric enthalpies should be achievable, barring issues due to non-ideality or unanticipated measurement pathologies. Indeed, disagreement between the two can serve as a flag for error-prone datasets. A review of the underlying theory supports the expectation that these two quantities should be in agreement. We address and arguably resolve long-standing questions regarding the relationship between calorimetric and van't Hoff enthalpies. In addition, we show that comparison of these two quantities can be used as an internal consistency check of a calorimetry study. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

P., E-mail: veretenk@inr.ru; Gavrin, V. N.; Danshin, S. N.\n\nExperimental study of nonstandard neutrino properties using high-intensity artificial neutrino sources requires the activity of the sources to be determined with high accuracy. In the BEST project, a calorimetric system for measurement of the activity of high-intensity (a few MCi) neutrino sources based on {sup 51}Cr with an accuracy of 0.5â1% is created. In the paper, the main factors affecting the accuracy of determining the neutrino source activity are discussed.

In addition, the relationship between steady state skin permeation rate and skin hydration in various concentrations of glycerin was investigated. Water vapor absorption-desorption was studied in the hairless mouse stratum corneum. Dry SC samples were exposed to different conc. of glycerin (0-50%) followed by exposure to dry air and the change in weight property was monitored over time by use of TGA. In DSC study, significant decrease in DeltaH of the lipid transition in 10% glycerin and water treated sample: the heat of lipid transition of normal, water, 10% glycerin treated SC were 6.058, 4.412 and 4.316 mJ/mg, respectively. In 10% glycerin treated SCs, the Tc of water shifts around 129 degrees C, corresponding to the weakly bound secondary water. In 40% glycerin treated SC, the Tc of water shifts to 144 degrees C corresponding to strongly bound primary water. There was a good correlation between the hydration property of the skin and the steady state skin flux with the correlation coefficient (r2=0.94). As the hydration increased, the steady state flux increased. As glycerin concentration increased, hydration property decreased. High diffusivity induced by the hydration effect of glycerin and water could be the major contributing factor for the enhanced skin permeation of nicotinic acid (NA).\n\nThermally decarboxylated sodium bicarbonate: Interactions with water vapour, calorimetric study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVolkova, Natalia; Hansson, Henri; Ljunggren, Lennart\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIsothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to study interactions between water vapour and the surface of thermally converted sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). The decarboxylation degree of the samples was varied from 3% to 35% and the humidity range was 54â100%. The obtained enthalpy values were all exothermic and showed a positive linear correlation with decarboxylation degrees for each humidity studied. The critical humidity, 75% (RHo), was determined as the inflection point on a plot of the meanâÎHÂ kJ/mole Na2CO3 against RH. Humidities above the critical humidity lead to complete surface dissolution. The water uptake (m) was determined after each calorimetric experiment, complementing the enthalpy data. A mechanism of water vapour interaction with decarboxylated samples, including the formation of trona and Wegscheiderâs salt on the bicarbonate surface is proposed for humidities below RHo.

The Cu-doped Ni2MnGa Heusler alloy with a first-order magneto-structural phase transition is used as a case study to illustrate how commonly-used magnetization measurement protocols result in spurious entropy evaluations. Two magnetization measurement protocols which allow for the accurate assessment of the magnetic entropy change across first-order magneto-structural transitions are presented. In addition, calorimetric measurements were performed to validate the results from the magnetization measurements. Self-consistent results between the magnetization and calorimetric measurements were obtained when the non-equilibrium thermodynamic state was carefully handled. Such methods could be applicable to other systems displaying giant magnetocaloric effects caused by first-order phase transitions with magnetic and thermal hysteresis.\n\nCalorimetric evidence for two distinct molecular packing arrangements in stable glasses of indomethacin.\n\nPubMed\n\nKearns, Kenneth L; Swallen, Stephen F; Ediger, M D; Sun, Ye; Yu, Lian\n\n2009-02-12\n\nIndomethacin glasses of varying stabilities were prepared by physical vapor deposition onto substrates at 265 K. Enthalpy relaxation and the mobility onset temperature were assessed with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Quasi-isothermal temperature-modulated DSC was used to measure the reversing heat capacity during annealing above the glass transition temperature Tg. At deposition rates near 8 A/s, scanning DSC shows two enthalpy relaxation peaks and quasi-isothermal DSC shows a two-step change in the reversing heat capacity. We attribute these features to two distinct local packing structures in the vapor-deposited glass, and this interpretation is supported by the strong correlation between the two calorimetric signatures of the glass to liquid transformation. At lower deposition rates, a larger fraction of the sample is prepared in the more stable local packing. The transformation of the vapor-deposited glasses into the supercooled liquid above Tg is exceedingly slow, as much as 4500 times slower than the structural relaxation time of the liquid.\n\nEffect of Heat Generation of Ultrasound Transducer on Ultrasonic Power Measured by Calorimetric Method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUchida, Takeyoshi; Kikuchi, Tsuneo\n\n2013-07-01\n\nUltrasonic power is one of the key quantities closely related to the safety of medical ultrasonic equipment. An ultrasonic power standard is required for establishment of safety. Generally, an ultrasonic power standard below approximately 20 W is established by the radiation force balance (RFB) method as the most accurate measurement method. However, RFB is not suitable for high ultrasonic power because of thermal damage to the absorbing target. Consequently, an alternative method to RFB is required. We have been developing a measurement technique for high ultrasonic power by the calorimetric method. In this study, we examined the effect of heat generation of an ultrasound transducer on ultrasonic power measured by the calorimetric method. As a result, an excessively high ultrasonic power was measured owing to the effect of heat generation from internal loss in the transducer. A reference ultrasound transducer with low heat generation is required for a high ultrasonic power standard established by the calorimetric method.\n\nMethod for measurement of diffusivity: Calorimetric studies of Fe/Ni multilayer thin films\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLiu, JX; Barmak, K\n\n2015-07-15\n\nA calorimetric method for the measurement of diffusivity in thin film multilayers is introduced and applied to the Fe Ni system. Using this method, the diffusivity in [Fe (25 nm)/Ni (25 nm)](20) multilayer thin films is measured as 4 x 10(-3)exp(-1.6 +/- 0.1 eV/ k(B)T) cm(2)/s, respectively. The diffusion mechanism in the multilayers and its relevance to laboratory synthesis of L1(0) ordered FeNi are discussed. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The calorimetric glass transition, Tg, decreases from 247 K for pure xylitol to about 181 K at a water concentration of approximately 37 wt. %. At water concentrations in the range 29-35 wt. % a plentiful calorimetric behaviour is observed. In addition to the glass transition, almost simultaneous crystallization and melting events occurring around 230-240 K. At higher water concentrations ice is formed during cooling and the glass transition temperature increases to a steady value of about 200 K for all higher water concentrations. This Tg corresponds to an unfrozen xylitol-water solution containing 20 wt. % water. In addition to the true glass transition we also observed a glass transition-like feature at 220 K for all the ice containing samples. However, this feature is more likely due to ice dissolution [A. Inaba and O. Andersson, Thermochim. Acta, 461, 44 (2007)]. In the case of the BDS measurements the presence of water clearly has an effect on both the cooperative Î±-relaxation and the secondary Î²-relaxation. The Î±-relaxation shows a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence and becomes faster with increasing concentration of water. The fragility of the solutions, determined by the temperature dependence of the Î±-relaxation close to the dynamic glass transition, decreases with increasing water content up to about 26 wt. % water, where ice starts to form. This decrease in fragility with increasing water content is most likely caused by the increasing density of hydrogen bonds, forming a network-like structure in the deeply supercooled regime. The intensity of the secondary Î²-relaxation of xylitol decreases noticeably already at a water content of 2 wt. %, and at a water content above 5 wt. % it has been replaced by a\n\nCalorimetric Measurements of Magnetic-Field-Induced Inhomogeneous Superconductivity Above the Paramagnetic Limit\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAgosta, Charles C.; Fortune, Nathanael A.; Hannahs, Scott T.\n\nWe report the first magnetocaloric and calorimetric observations of a magnetic-field-induced phase transition within a superconducting state to the long-sought exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state, first predicted over 50 years ago.

To test the proposed structural model, we have analyzed the structural organization of two members of the spermadhesin protein family, porcine seminal plasma proteins I/II (PSP-I/PSP-II) heterodimer and bovine acidic seminal fluid protein (aSFP) homodimer, using differential scanning calorimetry, far-ultraviolet circular dichroism and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Thermal unfolding of PSP-I/PSP-II and aSFP were irreversible and followed a one-step process with transition temperatures (Tm) of 60.5 degrees C and 78.6 degrees C, respectively. The calorimetric enthalpy changes (delta Hcat) of thermal denaturation were 439 kJ/mol for PSP-I/PSP-II and 660 kJ/mol for aSFP dimer. Analysis of the calorimetric curves of PSP-I/PSP-II showed that the entire dimer constituted the cooperative unfolding unit. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and deconvolution of circular dichroic spectra using a convex constraint analysis indicated that beta-structure and turns are the major structural element of both PSP-I/PSP-II (53% of beta-sheet, 21% of turns) and aSFP (44% of beta-sheet, 36% of turns), and that the porcine and the bovine proteins contain little, if any, alpha-helical structure. Taken together, our results indicate that the porcine and the bovine spermadhesin molecules are probably all-beta-structure proteins, and would support a beta-barrel topology like that predicted for the CUB domain. Other beta-structure folds, such as the Greek-key pattern characteristic of many carbohydrate-binding protein domains cannot be eliminated. Finally, the same combination of biophysical techniques was used to characterize the\n\nIntroduction of Differential Scanning Calorimetry in a General Chemistry Laboratory Course: Determination of Thermal Properties of Organic Hydrocarbons\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nD'Amelia, Ronald; Franks, Thomas; Nirode, William F.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nIn first-year general chemistry undergraduate courses, thermodynamics and thermal properties such as melting points and changes in enthalpy ([Delta]H) and entropy ([Delta]S) of phase changes are frequently discussed.

The shape of the calorimetric curves was compared with the theoretical data and interpreted in terms of the lateral interactions and critical temperatures determined for each lipid studied. A critical chain length has been found (between 16 and 17 C-atoms per chain) which subdivides PCs into two classes with different phase behavior. In shorter lipids, the transition takes place above their critical temperatures meaning that this is an intrinsically continuous transition. In longer lipids, the transition occurs below the critical temperatures of the lipids, meaning that the transition is intrinsically discontinuous (first-order). This conclusion was supported independently by the ultrasonic relaxation sensitive to density fluctuations. Interestingly, it is this length that is the most abundant among the saturated chains in biological membranes.\n\nCalorimetric gas sensor\n\nDOEpatents\n\nRicco, A.J.; Hughes, R.C.; Smith, J.H.; Moreno, D.J.; Manginell, R.P.; Senturia, S.D.; Huber, R.J.\n\n1998-11-10\n\nA combustible gas sensor is described that uses a resistively heated, noble metal-coated, micromachined polycrystalline Si filament to calorimetrically detect the presence and concentration of combustible gases.

At pH 7.0, 0.1 M NaCl and in the absence of divalent cations, aqueous dispersions of these lipids, which have not been incubated at low temperature, exhibit a single calorimetrically detectable phase transition that is fully reversible, highly cooperative, and relatively energetic, and the transition temperatures and enthalpies increase progressively with increases in hydrocarbon chain length. Our spectroscopic observations confirm that this thermal event is a lamellar gel (L(beta))-to-lamellar liquid crystalline (L(alpha)) phase transition. However, after low temperature incubation, the L(beta)/L(alpha) phase transition of dilauroyl phosphatidylserine is replaced by a higher temperature, more enthalpic, and less cooperative phase transition, and an additional lower temperature, less enthalpic, and less cooperative phase transition appears in the longer chain phosphatidylserines. Our spectroscopic results indicate that this change in thermotropic phase behavior when incubated at low temperatures results from the conversion of the L(beta) phase to a highly ordered lamellar crystalline (L(c)) phase. Upon heating, the L(c) phase of dilauroyl phosphatidylserine converts directly to the L(alpha) phase at a temperature slightly higher than that of its original L(beta)/L(alpha) phase transition. Calorimetrically, this process is manifested by a less cooperative but considerably more energetic, higher-temperature phase transition, which replaces the weaker L(beta)/L(alpha) phase transition alluded to above. However, with the longer chain compounds, the L(c) phase first converts to the L(beta) phase at temperatures some 10-25 degrees C below that at which the L(beta) phase converts to the L(alpha) phase\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetric study of the binding between native DNA and its primary water of hydration.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarlowe, R. L.; Lukan, A. M.; Lee, S. A.; Anthony, L.; Rupprecht, A.\n\n1996-03-01\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry was used to measure the binding strength between calf-thymus DNA and its primary water of hydration. The specific heat of wet-spun films was found to have a broad endothermic transition near 80 ^oC and a sharp exothermic transition near 250 ^oC. The broad transition is believed to be mainly due to the breaking of the bonds of the strongly bound water of hydration. This transition was found to be reversible, as expected. Kissinger analysis indicates that the activation barrier for breaking the bonds of these water molecules is about 0.6 eV. The sharp transition appeared to be an indication of a thermal decomposition of the DNA. Samples taken above this transition lost mass, showed evidence of having melted, and had turned black in color. This transition is irreversible.\n\nRadiation beam calorimetric power measurement system\n\nDOEpatents\n\nBaker, John; Collins, Leland F.; Kuklo, Thomas C.; Micali, James V.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nA radiation beam calorimetric power measurement system for measuring the average power of a beam such as a laser beam, including a calorimeter configured to operate over a wide range of coolant flow rates and being cooled by continuously flowing coolant for absorbing light from a laser beam to convert the laser beam energy into heat.

The objective of this study was to simultaneously investigate glucose excursion and substrate oxidation in a whole body calorimetre when Chinese male subjects were provided a low or high GI meal. In a randomized, controlled crossover non blind design, 12 healthy Chinese male adults (BMI 21.8âÂ±â1.3âkgm -2 ) attended two sessions consisting of either four low or high glycaemic meals (LGI vs HGI). Breakfast, lunch and snack were consumed in a whole body calorimetre while dinner was consumed at home. Daily changes in glycaemic response (GR) and postprandial GR responses were measured using a continuous glucose monitoring system. The GR was further calculated to obtain the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for glucose concentrations. Glycaemic variability was calculated as mean amplitude of glycaemic excursion (MAGE). Substrate oxidation was calculated by measuring respiratory quotient and urine nitrogen excretion. After LGI meals in the whole body calorimetre, iAUC for glucose (Pâ=â0.008) was lower compared to the HGI session. The HGI treatment produced a significantly greater MAGE than the LGI treatment over the 24 hour period (Pâ<â0.001). Additionally, higher fat oxidation and lower carbohydrate oxidation were observed following breakfast and lunch when comparing LGI to HGI (Pâ<â0.05). Consumption of LGI meals was capable of attenuating 24-hour blood glucose profiles and decreasing postprandial glucose excursions in healthy Asian males. Additionally, LGI mixed meals were able to promote fat oxidation over carbohydrate oxidation when compared to HGI mixed meals. The consumption of low GI meals may be a strategic approach in improving overall glycaemia and increasing fat oxidation in Asians consuming a high carbohydrate diet.\n\nSynthesis and interaction of sterol-uridine conjugate with DMPC liposomes studied by differential scanning calorimetry.\n\nPubMed\n\nEscobar, Jhon Fernando BerrÃ­o; Restrepo, Manuel Humberto Pastrana; FernÃ¡ndez, Diana Margarita MÃ¡rquez; MartÃ­nez, Alejandro MartÃ­nez; Giordani, Cristiano; Castelli, Francesco; Sarpietro, Maria Grazia\n\n2018-06-01\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a thermoanalytical technique which provides information on the interaction between drugs and models of cell membranes. Studies on the calorimetric behavior of hydrated phospholipids within liposomes are employed to shed light on the changes in the physico-chemical properties when interacting with drugs. In this report, new potential anti-cancer drugs such as uridine and uridine derivatives (acetonide and its succinate), 3Î²-5Î±,8Î±-endoperoxide-cholestan-6-en-3-ol (5,8-epidioxicholesterol) and conjugate (uridine acetonide-epidioxicholesterol succinate) have been synthesized. Steglich esterification method using coupling agents allowed to obtain the uridine acetonide-sterol conjugate. The study on the interaction between the drugs and dimiristoyl-phophatidilcholine (DMPC) liposomes has been conducted by the use of DSC. The analysis of the DSC curves indicated that the uridine and derivatives (acetonide and its succinate) present a very soft interaction with the DMPC liposomes, whereas the 5,8-epidioxicholesterol and the conjugate showed a strong effect on the thermotropic behavior. Our results suggested that the lipophilic character of uridine acetonide-sterol conjugate improves the affinity with the DMPC liposomes. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The key focus of this paper is on the thermal performance of the British Aerospace (BAe) 80 K split-Stirling-cycle cryocooler as measured in a unique calorimetric thermal-vacuum test chamber that accurately simulates the heat-transfer interfaces of space. Two separate cooling fluid loops provide precise individual control of the compressor and displacer heatsink temperatures. In addition, heatflow transducers enable calorimetric measurements of the heat rejected separately by the compressor and displacer. Cooler thermal performance has been mapped for coldtip temperatures ranging from below 45 K to above 150 K, for heatsink temperatures ranging from 280 K to 320 K, and for a wide variety of operational variables including compressor-displacer phase, compressor-displacer stroke, drive frequency, and piston-displacer dc offset.\n\nDesign and fabrication of a differential scanning nanocalorimeter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZuo, Lei; Chen, Xiaoming; Yu, Shifeng; Lu, Ming\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThis paper describes the design, fabrication, and characterization of a differential scanning nanocalorimeter that significantly reduces the sample volume to microliters and can potentially improve the temperature sensitivity to 10 ÂµK.

Vibrating grid experiments performed periously produced inhomogeneous turbulence, making the results hard to interpret. We have developed experimental methods to produce homogeneous isotropic turbulence by pulling a grid at a variable constant velocity through superfluid 4He. While using calorimetric technique to measure the energy dissipation, the Meissner effect was employed to eliminate all heat sources except from turbulent decay. A controlled divergent magnetic field provides the lift to a hollow cylindrical superconducting actuator to which the grid is attached. Position sensing is performed by measuring the inductance change of a coil when a superconductor, similar to that of the actuator, is moved inside it. This position sensing technique proved to be reliable under varying temperatures and magnetic fields, making it perfect for use in the towed-grid experiment where a rise in temperature emerges from turbulent decay. Additionally, the reproducible dependency of the grid's position on the applied magnetic field enables complete control of the actuator's motion.\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetric study of nonionic surfactant mixtures with a room temperature ionic liquid, bmimBF4.\n\nPubMed\n\nInoue, Tohru; Higuchi, Yuka; Misono, Takeshi\n\n2009-10-01\n\nThe melting behavior of polyethyleneglycol dodecyl ethers (C(12)E(6), C(12)E(7), and C(12)E(8)) in a room temperature ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (bmimBF(4)), was investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The melting temperature as a function of the surfactant concentration, combined with the cmc curve and cloud point curve, provided phase diagrams for the surfactant/bmimBF(4) mixtures in solvent-rich region. The characteristic feature of the mixtures is an existence of the Krafft temperature which is usually not observed with aqueous solutions of nonionic surfactants. The heat of fusion as a function of the surfactant concentration provided the interaction energy between the surfactant and bmimBF(4). The interaction energy shows a linear dependence on the length of polyoxyethylene (POE) chain of the surfactants, which suggests that the solvation takes place around the POE chain.\n\nA Calorimetric Study of Almandine: Are the Thermodynamic Properties of the End-Member Aluminosilicate Garnets Finally Known Quantitatively?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDachs, E.; Geiger, C. A.; Benisek, A.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe aluminosilicate garnets (E3Al2Si3O12 with E = Fe2+, Mn2+, Ca, Mg) form an important rock-forming mineral group. Much study has been directed toward determining their thermodynamic properties. The iron end-member almandine (Fe3Al2Si3O12) is a key phase in many petrologic investigations. As part of an ongoing calorimetric and thermodynamic study of the aluminosilicate garnets, the heat capacity of three synthetic well-characterized polycrystalline almandine garnets and one natural almandine-rich single crystal was measured. The various garnets were characterized by optical microscopy, electron-microprobe analysis, X-ray powder diffraction and 57Fe MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy. Heat capacity measurements were performed in the temperature range 3 to 300 K using relaxation calorimetry and between 282 and 764 K using DSC methods. From the former, So values between 336.7 Â± 0.8 and 337.8 Â± 0.8 J/molK are calculated for the different samples. The smaller value is considered the best So for end-member stoichiometric almandine, because it derives from the \"best\" Fe3+-free synthetic sample. The Cp behavior for almandine at T > 298 K is given by the polynomial (in J/molK): Cp = 649.06(Â±4) - 3837.57(Â±122)T-0.5 - 1.44682(Â±0.06)107T-2 + 1.94834(Â±0.09)109T-3, which is calculated using DSC data together with one published heat-content datum determined by transposed-drop calorimetry along with a new determination that gives H1181K - H302K = 415.0 Â± 3.2 kJ/mole. Almandine shows a Î»-type heat-capacity anomaly at low temperatures resulting from a paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase transition at about 9 K. The lattice heat capacity was calculated using the single-parameter phonon dispersion model of Komada and Westrum (1997), which allows the non-lattice heat capacity (Cex) behavior to be modelled. An analysis shows the presence of an electronic heat-capacity contribution (Cel - Schottky anomaly) around 17 K that is superimposed on a larger magnetic heat-capacity effect (Cmag\n\na Calorimetric Study of the Precipitation Hardening Mechanisms in AN Al-Cu-Mg-Si Alloy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHayoune, Abdelali\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThe precipitation phenomena and the related hardening in an Al-Cu-Mg-Si alloy were studied by calorimetry, X-ray diffraction analysis and microhardness measurements. The main calorimetric peaks were identified to be due to Î²â§â§, Î¸â§ and Qâ§ phases precipitation. The hardening during aging at room temperature and 160Â°C, was respectively, explained by atomic clusters and GP zones formation and by GP zones and Î²â§â§/Î¸â§ phases coprecipitation. Although the mechanical properties variation during aging at 200Â°C is simple, the corresponding microstructural evolution is complex: on the basis of the DSC results, the increasing of microhardness values, is mainly due to the coprecipitation of GP zones and Î²â§â§/Î¸â§ phases, however, the maximum hardening is explained by the coexistence of Î²â§â§/Î¸â§ and Î¸â§â§ phases. Another important conclusion is that during aging at 160Â°C and 200Â°C, the Î¸â§ phase is essentially developed from GP zones.\n\nA calorimetric investigation of the interaction of the lac repressor with inducer.\n\nPubMed\n\nDonnÃ©r, J; Caruthers, M H; Gill, S J\n\n1982-12-25\n\nA calorimetric study has been made of the interaction between the lac repressor and isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG). The buffer-corrected enthalpy of reaction at 25 degrees C was found to be -15.6, -24.7, -4.6 kJ/mol of bound IPTG at pH 7.0, pH 8.1, and pH 9.0, respectively. This large range of enthalpy values is in contrast to a maximum difference in the free energy of the reaction of only 1.5 kJ/mol of bound IPTG between these pH values. The reaction was found by calorimetric measurements in different buffers to be accompanied by an uptake of 0.29 mol of protons/mol of bound IPTG at pH 8.1. The pH dependency of the reaction enthalpy suggests differences in the extent of protonation of the binding site and the involvement of H bonding with IPTG. The lack of strong hydrophobic contributions in the IPTG binding process is revealed by the absence of any determinable heat capacity change for the reaction at pH 7.0. The presence of phosphate buffer significantly alters the enthalpy of IPTG binding at higher pH values, but has little effect upon the binding constant. This implies that highly negative phosphate species change the nature of the IPTG binding site without any displacement of phosphate upon IPTG binding.\n\nMagnetic fluid hyperthermia probed by both calorimetric and dynamic hysteresis measurements\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuibert, ClÃ©ment; Fresnais, JÃ©rÃ´me; Peyre, VÃ©ronique; Dupuis, Vincent\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we report an investigation of magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) using combined calorimetric and newly implemented dynamic hysteresis measurements for two sets of well characterized size-sorted maghemite nanoparticles (with diameters of about 10 nm and 20 nm) dispersed in water and in glycerol. Our primary goal was to assess the influence of viscosity on the heating efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles described in terms of specific loss power (SLP or specific absorption rate, SAR) and dynamic hysteresis. In particular, we aimed to investigate how this SLP depends on the transition from NÃ©elian to Brownian behavior of nanoparticles expected to occur between 10 nm and 20 nm (for maghemite) and dependent on the viscosity. While we observed a good agreement between calorimetric and dynamic hysteresis measurements, we found that the SLP measured for the different systems do not depend noticeably on the viscosity of solvent. Calculations performed according to Rosensweig's linear model [1] allow us to quantitatively reproduce our results at low field intensities, provided we use a value for the magnetic anisotropy constant much smaller than the one commonly used in the literature. This raises the question of the temperature dependance of the magnetic anisotropy constant and its relevance for a quantitative description of MFH.\n\nInteraction of chloroquine and its analogues with heme: An isothermal titration calorimetric study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBachhawat, K; Thomas, C J; Surolia, N; Surolia, A\n\n2000-10-05\n\nQuinoline-containing drugs such as chloroquine and quinine have had a long and successful history in antimalarial chemotherapy. Identification of ferriprotoporphyrin IX ([Fe(III)PPIX], haematin) as the drug receptors for these antimalarials called for investigations of the binding affinity, mode of interaction, and the conditions affecting the interaction. The parameters obtained are significant in recent times with the emergence of chloroquine resistant strains of the malaria parasites. This has underlined the need to unravel the molecular mechanism of their action so as to meet the requirement of an alternative to the existing antimalarial drugs. The isothermal titration calorimetric studies on the interaction of chloroquine with haematin lead us to propose an altered mode of binding. The initial recognition is ionic in nature mediated by the propionyl group of haematin with the quaternary nitrogen on CQ. This ionic interaction induces a conformational change, such as to favour binding of subsequent CQ molecules. On the contrary, conditions emulating the cytosolic environment (pH 7.4 and 150 mM salt) reveal the hydrophobic force to be the sole contributor driving the interaction. Interaction of a carefully selected panel of quinoline antimalarial drugs with monomeric ferriprotoporphyrin IX has also been investigated at pH 5.6 mimicking the acidic environment prevalent in the food vacuoles of parasite, the center of drug activity, which are consistent with their antimalarial activity.

In this work, we analyze how the energy reconstruction may be affected by realistic detection capabilities, such as energy resolutions, efficiencies, and thresholds. This allows us to estimate how well the detector performance needs to be determined a priori in order to avoid a sizable bias in the measurement of the relevant oscillation parameters. We compare the kinematic and calorimetric methods of energy reconstruction in the context of two Î½ Î¼ â Î½ Î¼ disappearance experiments operating inmoreÂ Â» different energy regimes. For the calorimetric reconstruction method, we find that the detector performance has to be estimated with an O(10%) accuracy to avoid a significant bias in the extracted oscillation parameters. Thus, in the case of kinematic energy reconstruction, we observe that the results exhibit less sensitivity to an overestimation of the detector capabilities.Â«Â less\n\nRemote calorimetric detection of urea via flow injection analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGaddes, David E.; Demirel, Melik C.; Reeves, W. Brian; Tadigadapa, Srinivas\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe design and development of a calorimetric biosensing system enabling relatively high throughput sample analysis are reported. The calorimetric biosensor system consists of a thin (~20 Î¼m) micromachined Y-cut quartz crystal resonator (QCR) as a temperature sensor placed in close proximity to a fluidic chamber packed with an immobilized enzyme. Layer by layer enzyme immobilization of urease is demonstrated and its activity as a function of the number of layers, pH, and time has been evaluated. This configuration enables a sensing system where a transducer element is physically separated from the analyte solution of interest and is thereby free from fouling effects typically associated with biochemical reactions occuring on the sensor surface. The performance of this biosensing system is demonstrated by detection of 1â200 mM urea in phosphate buffer via a flow injection analysis (FIA) technique. Miniaturized fluidic systems were used to provide continuous flow through a reaction column. Under this configuration the biosensor has an ultimate resolution of less than 1 mM urea and showed a linear response between 0â50 mM. This work demonstrates a sensing modality in which the sensor itself is not fouled or contaminated by the solution of interest and the enzyme immobilized KaptonÂ® fluidic reaction column can be used as a disposable cartridge. Such a system enables reuse and reliability for long term sampling measurements.

This work demonstrates a sensing modality in which the sensor itself is not fouled or contaminated by the solution of interest and the enzyme immobilized KaptonÂ® fluidic reaction column can be used as a disposable cartridge. Such a system enables reuse and reliability for long term sampling measurements. Based on this concept a biosensing system is envisioned which can perform rapid measurements to detect biomarkers such as glucose, creatinine, cholesterol, urea and lactate in urine and blood continuously over extended periods of time.\n\nCalorimetric low temperature detectors for low-energetic heavy ions and their application in accelerator mass spectrometry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKraft-Bermuth, S.; Andrianov, V.

P.; Shrivastava, A.; Weber, M.; Golser, R.; Kutschera, W.; Priller, A.; Steier, P.; Vockenhuber, C.\n\n2009-10-01\n\nThe energy-sensitive detection of heavy ions with calorimetric low temperature detectors was investigated in the energy range of E =0.1-1 MeV/amu, commonly used for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The detectors used consist of sapphire absorbers and superconducting aluminum transition edge thermometers operated at T Ë1.5 K. They were irradiated with various ion beams (C13,A197u,U238) provided by the VERA tandem accelerator in Vienna, Austria. The relative energy resolution obtained was ÎE /E=(5-9)Ã10-3, even for the heaviest ions such as U238. In addition, no evidence for a pulse height defect was observed. This performance allowed for the first time to apply a calorimetric low temperature detector in an AMS experiment. The aim was to precisely determine the isotope ratio of U236/U238 for several samples of natural uranium, U236 being known as a sensitive monitor for neutron fluxes. Replacing a conventionally used detection system at VERA by the calorimetric detector enabled to substantially reduce background from neighboring isotopes and to increase the detection efficiency. Due to the high sensitivity achieved, a value of U236/U238=6.1Ã10-12 could be obtained, representing the smallest U236/U238 ratio measured at the time. In addition, we contributed to establishing an improved material standard of U236/U238, which can be used as a reference for future AMS measurements.\n\nCalorimetric Thermoelectric Gas Sensor for the Detection of Hydrogen, Methane and Mixed Gases\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPark, Nam-Hee; Akamatsu, Takafumi; Itoh, Toshio; Izu, Noriya; Shin, Woosuck\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA novel miniaturized calorimeter-type sensor device with a dual-catalyst structure was fabricated by integrating different catalysts on the hot (Pd/Î¸-Al2O3) and cold (Pt/Î±-Al2O3) ends of the device. The device comprises a calorimeter with a thermoelectric gas sensor (calorimetric-TGS), combining catalytic combustion and thermoelectric technologies. Its response for a model fuel gas of hydrogen and methane was investigated with various combustor catalyst compositions. The calorimetric-TGS devices detected H2, CH4, and a mixture of the two with concentrations ranging between 200 and 2000 ppm at temperatures of 100â400 Â°C, in terms of the calorie content of the gases. It was necessary to reduce the much higher response voltage of the TGS to H2 compared to CH4. We enhanced the H2 combustion on the cold side so that the temperature differences and response voltages to H2 were reduced. The device response to H2 combustion was reduced by 50% by controlling the Pt concentration in the Pt/Î±-Al2O3 catalyst on the cold side to 3 wt%.

The experiments were carried out along Ag0.25Sb0.75, Ag0.5Sb0.5 and Ag0.75Sb0.25 sections of the ternary system in the temperature range from 973 K to 1223 K. From the measured emf, the tin activity in liquid solutions of Ag-Sb-Sn was determined for the first time. The partial and integral enthalpy of mixing were determined from calorimetric measurements at two temperatures. These measurements were performed along two cross-sections: Sb0.5Sn0.5 at 912 K and 1075 K, and Ag0.75Sb0.25 at 1075 K. Both experimental data sets were used to find ternary interaction parameters by applying the Redlich-Kister-Muggianu model of the substitutional solution. Consequently, the set of parameters describing the thermodynamic properties of the liquid phase was derived.\n\nThermodynamic properties of chlorite and berthierine derived from calorimetric measurements\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBlanc, Philippe; Gailhanou, HÃ©lÃ¨ne; Rogez, Jacques; Mikaelian, Georges; Kawaji, Hitoshi; Warmont, Fabienne; Gaboreau, StÃ©phane; Grangeon, Sylvain; GrenÃ¨che, Jean-Marc; Vieillard, Philippe; Fialips, Claire I.; Giffaut, Eric; Gaucher, Eric C.; Claret, F.\n\n2014-09-01\n\nIn the context of the deep waste disposal, we have investigated the respective stabilities of two iron-bearing clay minerals: berthierine ISGS from Illinois [USA; (Al0.975FeIII0.182FeII1.422Mg0.157Li0.035Mn0.002)(Si1.332Al0.668)O5(OH)4] and chlorite CCa-2 from Flagstaff Hill, California [USA; (Si2.633Al1.367)(Al1.116FeIII0.215Mg2.952FeII1.712Mn0.012Ca0.011)O10(OH)8]. For berthierine, the complete thermodynamic dataset was determined at 1 bar and from 2 to 310 K, using calorimetric methods. The standard enthalpies of formation were obtained by solution-reaction calorimetry at 298.15 K, and the heat capacities were measured by heat-pulse calorimetry. For chlorite, the standard enthalpy of formation is measured by solution-reaction calorimetry at 298.15 K. This is completing the entropy and heat capacity obtained previously by Gailhanou et al. (Geochim Cosmochim Acta 73:4738-4749, 2009) between 2 and 520 K, by using low-temperature adiabatic calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. For both minerals, the standard entropies and the Gibbs free energies of formation at 298.15 K were then calculated. An assessment of the measured properties could be carried out with respect to literature data. Eventually, the thermodynamic dataset allowed realizing theoretical calculations concerning the berthierine to chlorite transition. The latter showed that, from a thermodynamic viewpoint, the main factor controlling this transition is probably the composition of the berthierine and chlorite minerals and the nature of the secondary minerals rather than temperature.\n\nA combined calorimetric and computational study of the energetics of rare earth substituted UO 2 systems\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZhang, Lei; Solomon, Jonathan M.; Asta, Mark\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe energetics of rare earth substituted UO2 solid solutions (U1-xLnxO2-0.5x+y, where Ln = La, Y, and Nd) are investigated employing a combination of calorimetric measurements and density functional theory based computations. Calculated and measured formation enthalpies agree within 10 kJ/mol for stoichiometric oxygen/metal compositions. To better understand the factors governing the stability and defect binding in rare earth substituted urania solid solutions, systematic trends in the energetics are investigated based on the present results and previous computational and experimental thermochemical studies of rare earth substituted fluorite oxides (A1-xLnxO2-0.5x, where A = Hf, Zr, Ce, and Th). A consistent trend towardsmoreÂ Â» increased energetic stability with larger size mismatch between the smaller host tetravalent cation and the larger rare earth trivalent cation is found for both actinide and non-actinide fluorite oxide systems where aliovalent substitution of Ln cations is compensated by oxygen vacancies. However, the large exothermic oxidation enthalpy in the UO2 based systems favors oxygen rich compositions where charge compensation occurs through the formation of uranium cations with higher oxidation states.Â«Â less\n\nStructural, Morphological, Differential Scanning Calorimetric and Thermogravimetric Studies of Ball Milled Fe Doped Nanoscale La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 Manganite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAstik, Nidhi; Jha, Prafulla K.; Pratap, Arun\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe ball milling route has been used to produce the La0.67Sr0.33Mn0.85Fe0.15O3 (LSMFO) nanocrystalline sample from oxide precursors. The sample was characterized using x-ray diffraction (XRD), a scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TGA) measurements. The x-ray diffraction confirms the phase purity of sample and shows that the sample crystallizes in the rhombohedral perovskite structure with a R-3c space group. The scanning electron micrograph shows the presence of well-faceted crystallites of LSMFO. The EDAX spectrum demonstrates the molar ratio of different elements of nanocrystalline LSMFO. Furthermore, the crystallite size using the Debye-Scherrer formula and William-Hall analysis has been found as 24 nm and 29 nm, respectively. Our results support the idea that a good quality nanocrystalline LSMFO sample can be obtained using the ball milling route. We also discuss the DSC and TGA curves and analyse the results in terms of phase transition, calcination temperature and activation barrier energies.\n\nKinetic and calorimetric study of the adsorption of dyes on mesoporous activated carbon prepared from coconut coir dust.\n\nPubMed\n\nMacedo, Jeremias de Souza; da Costa JÃºnior, Nivan Bezerra; Almeida, Luis Eduardo; Vieira, Eunice Fragoso da Silva; Cestari, Antonio Reinaldo; Gimenez, Iara de FÃ¡tima; Villarreal CarreÃ±o, Neftali LÃªnin; Barreto, Ledjane Silva\n\n2006-06-15\n\nMesoporous activated carbon has been prepared from coconut coir dust as support for adsorption of some model dye molecules from aqueous solutions. The methylene blue (MB) and remazol yellow (RY) molecules were chosen for study of the adsorption capacity of cationic and anionic dyes onto prepared activated carbon. The adsorption kinetics was studied with the Lagergren first- and pseudo-second-order kinetic models as well as the intraparticle diffusion model. The results for both dyes suggested a multimechanism sorption process. The adsorption mechanisms in the systems dyes/AC follow pseudo-second-order kinetics with a significant contribution of intraparticle diffusion. The samples simultaneously present acidic and basic sites able to act as anchoring sites for basic and acidic dyes, respectively. Calorimetric studies reveal that dyes/AC interaction forces are correlated with the pH of the solution, which can be related to the charge distribution on the AC surface. These AC samples also exhibited very short equilibrium times for the adsorption of both dyes, which is an economically favorable requisite for the activated carbon described in this work, in addition to the local abundance of the raw material.\n\nStructural characterization/correlation of calorimetric properties of coal fluids: Final report, September 1, 1985--August 31, 1988\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStarling, K.E.; Mallinson, R.G.; Li, M.H.\n\nThe objective of this research is to examine the relationship between the calorimetric properties of coal fluids and their molecular functional group composition.

The differential scanning calorimetry transitions predicted for these models can be broadly classified into four groups: situations A, B, C, and Câ². (A) The transition is calorimetrically irreversible but the rate-limited, irreversible step takes place with significant rate only at temperatures slightly above those corresponding to the transition. Equilibrium thermodynamics analysis is permissible. (B) The transition is distorted by the occurrence of the rate-limited step; nevertheless, it contains thermodynamic information about the reversible unfolding of the protein, which could be obtained upon the appropriate data treatment. (C) The heat absorption is entirely determined by the kinetics of formation of the final state and no thermodynamic information can be extracted from the calorimetric transition; the rate-determining step is the irreversible process itself. (Câ²) same as C, but, in this case, the rate-determining step is a previous step in the unfolding pathway. It is shown that ligand and protein concentration effects on transitions corresponding to situation C (strongly rate-limited transitions) are similar to those predicted by equilibrium thermodynamics for simple reversible unfolding models. It has been widely held in recent literature that experimentally observed ligand and protein concentration effects support the applicability of equilibrium thermodynamics to irreversible protein denaturation. The theoretical analysis reported here disfavors this claim.

It is based on a technique used at 4.2 K for conventional superconducting wires that allows an easy loss measurement in parallel or perpendicular external field orientation. This paper focuses on ac loss measurement setup and calibration in a rotating magnetic field. This experimental setup is to demonstrate measuring loss using a temperature rise method under the influence of a rotating magnetic field. The slight temperature increase of the sample in an ac-field is used as a measure of losses. The aim is to simulate the loss in rotating machines using HTS. This is a unique technique to measure total ac loss in HTS at power frequencies. The sample is mounted on to a cold finger extended from a liquid nitrogen heat exchanger (HEX). The thermal insulation between the HEX and sample is provided by a material of low thermal conductivity, and low eddy current heating sample holder in vacuum vessel. A temperature sensor and noninductive heater have been incorporated in the sample holder allowing a rapid sample change. The main part of the data is obtained in the calorimetric measurement is used for calibration. The focus is on the accuracy and calibrations required to predict the actual ac losses in HTS. This setup has the advantage of being able to measure the total ac loss under the influence of a continuous moving field as experienced by any rotating machines.\n\nEffect of sulfoxides on the thermal denaturation of hen lysozyme: A calorimetric and Raman study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTorreggiani, A.; Di Foggia, M.; Manco, I.; De Maio, A.; Markarian, S. A.; Bonora, S.\n\n2008-11-01\n\nA multidisciplinary study of the thermal denaturation of lysozyme in the presence of three sulfoxides with different length in hydrocarbon chain (DMSO, DESO, and DPSO) was carried out by means of DSC, Raman spectroscopy, and SDS-PAGE techniques. In particular, the Td and Î H values obtained from the calorimetric measurements showed that lysozyme is partially unfolded by sulfoxides but most of the conformation holds native state. The sulfoxide denaturing ability increases in the order DPSO > DESO > DMSO. Moreover, only DMSO and DESO have a real effect in preventing the heat-induced inactivation of the protein and their maximum heat-protective ability is reached when the DMSO and DESO amount is â©¾25% w/w. The sulfoxide ability to act as effective protective agents against the heat-induced inactivation was confirmed by the protein analysis. The enzymatic activity, as well as the SDS-PAGE analysis, suggested that DESO, having a low hydrophobic character and a great ability to stabilise the three-dimensional water structure, is the most heat-protective sulfoxide. An accurate evaluation of the heat-induced conformational changes of the lysozyme structure before and after sulfoxide addition was obtained by the analysis of the Raman spectra. The addition of DMSO or DESO in low concentration resulted to sensitively decrease the heat-induced structural modifications of the protein.\n\nStructural characterization/correlation of calorimetric properties of coal fluids: Second annual report, September 1, 1986-August 31, 1987\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStarling, K.E.; Mallinson, R.G.; Li, M.H.\n\nThe objective of this research is to examine the relationship between the calorimetric properties of coal fluids and their molecular functional group composition.

Our results demonstrate the following features: (1) UV thermal analysis reveals that the Tm for triplex decreases with increasing pH value in the presence of neomycin, while the Tm for the duplex remains unchanged. (2) The binding affinity of neomycin decreases with increased pH, although there is an increase in observed binding enthalpy. (3) ITC studies conducted in two buffers (sodium cacodylate and MOPS) yield the number of protonated drug amino groups (În) as 0.29 and 0.40 for neomycin and paromomycin interaction with 5â²-dA12-x-dT12-x-dT12-3â², respectively. (4) The specific heat capacity change (ÎCp) determined by ITC studies is negative, with more negative values at lower salt concentrations. From 100 mM to 250 mM KCl, the ÎCp ranges from â402 to â60 cal/(mol K) for neomycin. At pH 5.5, a more positive ÎCp is observed, with a value of â98 cal/(mol K) at 100 mM KCl. ÎCp is not significantly affected by ionic strength. (5) Salt dependence studies reveal that there are at least three amino groups of neomycin participating in the electrostatic interactions with the triplex. (6) FID studies using thiazole orange were used to derive the AC50 (aminoglycoside concentration needed to displace 50% of the dye from the triplex) values. Neomycin shows a seven fold higher affinity than paromomycin and eleven fold higher affinity than ribostamycin at pH 6.8. (7) Modeling studies, consistent with UV and ITC results, show the importance of an additional positive charge in triplex recognition by neomycin. The modeling and thermodynamic studies indicate that neomycin binding to the DNA triplex depends upon significant contributions from charge as well as shape complementarity of the drug to the DNA triplex\n\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetric Study and Potential Model of the Binding of the Primary Water of Hydration to K-Hyaluronate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWhitson, K. B.; Marlowe, R. L.; Lukan, A. M.; Lee, S. A.; Anthony, L.; Rupprecht, A.\n\n1997-11-01\n\nDSC was performed on samples of K-hyaluronate (KHA) through a temperature range of 25-180^oC. A transition peak was observed which is due to the desorption of the primary water of hydration. The maximum position of the peak was observed to change with different scan rates. The average energy of activation, E_A, and enthalpy for desorption of the primary water of hydration was determined to be 0.62 and 0.17 eV per water molecule, respectively. Analysis of Mossbauer data(G. Albanese et al., Hyperfine Int.,) 95, 97 (1995) allowed us to determine the effective force constant, k_eff, of the water bound to KHA to be approximately 19.4 eV/nm^2. The parameters E_A, ÎH,and k_eff allow us to construct a potential model for the primary water of hydration of KHA. Comparison of these parameters with the same parameters for HA and DNA with different counterions reveal that the energy of activation is similar, as well as the enthalpy change.\n\nThermal explosion analysis of methyl ethyl ketone peroxide by non-isothermal and isothermal calorimetric applications.\n\nPubMed\n\nChi, Jen-Hao; Wu, Sheng-Hung; Shu, Chi-Min\n\n2009-11-15\n\nIn the past, process incidents attributed to organic peroxides (OPs) that involved near misses, over-pressures, runaway reactions, and thermal explosions occurred because of poor training, human error, incorrect kinetic assumptions, insufficient change management, and inadequate chemical knowledge in the manufacturing process. Calorimetric applications were employed broadly to test organic peroxides on a small-scale because of their thermal hazards, such as exothermic behavior and self-accelerating decomposition in the laboratory. In essence, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKPO) is highly reactive and exothermically unstable. In recent years, it has undergone many thermal explosions and runaway reaction incidents in the manufacturing process. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), vent sizing package 2 (VSP2), and thermal activity monitor (TAM) were employed to analyze thermokinetic parameters and safety index. The intent of the analyses was to facilitate the use of various auto-alarm equipments to detect over-pressure, over-temperature, and hazardous materials leaks for a wide spectrum of operations. Results indicated that MEKPO decomposition is detected at low temperatures (30-40 degrees C), and the rate of decomposition was shown to exponentially increase with temperature and pressure. Determining time to maximum rate (TMR), self-accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT), maximum temperature (T(max)), exothermic onset temperature (T(0)), and heat of decomposition (DeltaH(d)) was essential for identifying early-stage runaway reactions effectively for industries.\n\nStructural characterization/correlation of calorimetric properties of coal fluids.

Correlation of differential scanning calorimetric data with IR and dissociation vapor pressure studies of transitions of hexamethonium chloride and bromide dihydrates and hexamethonium bromide monohydrate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSnider, Barbara L.; Harmon, Kenneth M.\n\n1994-03-01\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry of hexamethonium chloride dihydrate shows an endothermic transition of 2.70 kcal mol -1 at 36.81Â°C. This correlates well with the temperatures observed by IR spectra (36Â°C) and equilibrium dissociation vapor pressure studies (37Â°C) for the transition between Type I planar cluster and Type II extended linear HOH&ctdot;Cl - hydrogen bonding, and with the value of 2.77 kcal mol -1 for this transition derived by Hess' law treatment of dissociation vapor pressure data. Differential scanning calorimetry of hexamethonium bromide shows a rapid endothermic transition of 2.38 kcal mol -1 at 35.15Â°C and a very slow endothermic transition of about 12-13 kcal mol -1 centered near 50Â°C. This latter endotherm corresponds to the transition between Type I and Type II HOH&ctdot;Br - hydrogen bonding observed by IR and vapor pressure studies at 49Â°C. The nature of the 35.15Â°C endotherm is not known. Hexamethonium bromide also shows a third endotherm at 142.91Â°C, which presumably results from melting of hydrate in the sealed DSC cell. Combined analysis of differential scanning calorimetry and dissociation vapor pressure data predicts a value of about -13 kcal mol -1 for an exothermic disproportionation at 52Â°C of two hexamethonium bromide monohydrate to Type II dihydrate and anhydrous bromide.\n\nInteraction of Antiinflammatory Drugs with EPC Liposomes: Calorimetric Study in a Broad Concentration Range\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMatos, Carla; Lima, JosÃ© L. C.; Reis, Salette; Lopes, AntÃ³nio; Bastos, Margarida\n\n2004-01-01\n\nIsothermal titration calorimetry was used to characterize and quantify the partition of indomethacin and acemetacin between the bulk aqueous phase and the membrane of egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Significant electrostatic effects were observed due to binding of the charged drugs to the membrane, which implied the use of the Gouy-Chapman theory to calculate the interfacial concentrations. The binding/partition phenomenon was quantified in terms of the partition coefficient (Kp), and/or the equilibrium constant (Kb). Mathematical expressions were developed, either to encompass the electrostatic effects in the partition model, or to numerically relate partition coefficients and binding constants. Calorimetric titrations conducted under a lipid/drug ratio >100:1 lead to a constant heat release and were used to directly calculate the enthalpy of the process, ÎH, and indirectly, ÎG and ÎS. As the lipid/drug ratio decreased, the constancy of reaction enthalpy was tested in the fitting process. Under low lipid/drug ratio conditions simple partition was no longer valid and the interaction phenomenon was interpreted in terms of binding isotherms. A mathematical expression was deduced for quantification of the binding constants and the number of lipid molecules associated with one drug molecule. The broad range of concentrations used stressed the biphasic nature of the interaction under study. As the lipid/drug ratio was varied, the results showed that the interaction of both drugs does not present a unique behavior in all studied regimes: the extent of the interaction, as well as the binding stoichiometry, is affected by the lipid/drug ratio. The change in these parameters reflects the biphasic behavior of the interactionâpossibly the consequence of a modification of the membrane's physical properties as it becomes saturated with the drug.

Phys. 15, 115006 (2013), 10.1088/1367-2630/15/11/115006 for calorimetric measurements of thermodynamic indicators in an open quantum system. As a theoretical model we consider a periodically driven qubit coupled with a large yet finite electron reservoir, the calorimeter. The calorimeter is initially at equilibrium with an infinite phonon bath. As time elapses, the temperature of the calorimeter varies in consequence of energy exchanges with the qubit and the phonon bath. We show how under weak-coupling assumptions, the evolution of the qubit-calorimeter system can be described by a generalized quantum jump process including as dynamical variable the temperature of the calorimeter. We study the jump process by numeric and analytic methods. Asymptotically with the duration of the drive, the qubit-calorimeter attains a steady state. In this same limit, we use multiscale perturbation theory to derive a Fokker-Planck equation governing the calorimeter temperature distribution. We inquire the properties of the temperature probability distribution close and at the steady state. In particular, we predict the behavior of measurable statistical indicators versus the qubit-calorimeter coupling constant.\n\nRaman studies of phase transitions in ferroelectric [C2H5NH3]2ZnCl4\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBen Mohamed, C.; Karoui, K.; Bulou, A.; Ben Rhaiem, A.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe present paper accounted for the synthesis, differential scanning calorimetric and vibrational spectroscopy of [C2H5NH3]2ZnCl4grown at room temperature.

Raman spectra as function temperature have been used to characterize these transitions and their nature, which indicates a change of the some peak near the transitions phase.

Y.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nTo determine the variation of A f along the axial length of rotary nickel-titanium endodontic files (RNEF). Three commercial brands of 4% taper RNEF: GTX (#20, 25 mm, Dentsply Tulsa Dental Specialties, Tulsa, OK, USA), K3 (#25, 25 mm) and TF (Twisted File #25, 27 mm) (Sybron Kerr, Orange, CA, USA) were cut into segments at 4 mm increment from the working tip. Regional specimens were measured for differential heat-flow over thermal cycling, generally with continuous heating or cooling (5 Â°C/min) and 5 min hold at set temperatures (start, finish temperatures): GTX: -55, 90 Â°C; K3: -55, 45 Â°C; TF: -55, 60 Â°C; using differential scanning calorimeter. This experiment demonstrated regional differences in A f along the axial length of GTX and K3 files. Similar variation was not obvious in the TF samples. A contributory effect of regional difference in strain-hardening due to grinding and machining during manufacturing is proposed.\n\nThermogravimetric, Calorimetric, and Structural Studies of the Co3 O4 /CoO Oxidation/Reduction Reaction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUnruh, Karl; Cicho"
