Feel free to ask questions, seek help, give advice/ideas, share an experience or interesting Tombstone or ask for research lookup help. A BIG thanks to everyone for your support and work on [[:Category:Georgia%2C_Cemeteries|Team Georgia!]] ==Quick Links== :[[:Category:Georgia%2C_Cemeteries|County List]] of Georgia Cemeteries :Team Georgia [[Space:Georgia_Cemeteries_Team_Progress|Progress Page]] :[[Space:Guidance_for_Creation_of_United_States_Cemeteries|How to Create Cemetery Categories on WikiTree]] :[http://gravestonepreservation.info/articles/cleaning-gravestones-monuments-stone-sculptures Gravestone Preservation Tips for Cleaning Tombstones] ==Example for CATEGORY PAGES== '''PLEASE Use this Template Box (called the Category Info Box or CIB) at the Top of the Cemetery CATEGORY Page.''' DO NOT USE THIS FOR CEMETERY FREE SPACE PAGES. For an example, look at the [[:Category:Rest_Haven_Cemetery%2C_Alpharetta%2C_Georgia|Rest Haven Cemetery]] Category Page. Copy and Paste and Edit the following table to Match your Cemetery. Fill out as many of the options as possible. Some might not be applicable. {{CategoryInfoBox Cemetery\n\n| name = Rest Haven Cemetery\n\n| aka = Alpharetta City Cemetery\n\n| parent = Fulton County, Georgia (Note: DO NOT add the \", Cemeteries\" here)\n\n| location = Alpharetta, Georgia\n\n| findagraveID = 277913\n\n| spacepage = Rest_Haven_Cemetery\n\n| webpage = URL if the actual Cemetery has a Private Webpage\n\n| billiongravesID = 258959\n\n| coordinate = 34.07563, -84.29823\n\n| address = 90 Milton Avenue, Alpharetta, Georgia 30009 (County not needed in address}\n\n|team= Georgia Cemeteries\n\n|image= optional\n\n|TOC= (do not use unless there are over 200 profiles in the category)\n\n}} See: [[:Space:Rest_Haven_Cemetery|Space Page for Rest Haven Cemetery]] ===A couple of Notes About the Cemetery Template Box (CIB): === # Replace the specific details in the above Template with the Cemetery you are working on. # If you notice, the Template doesn't require a lot of the WikiTree \"code\". Instead, the answers are in simple text (ex. the parent = Fulton County, Georgia vs the URL link). #spacepage: When adding your matching Space Page, use the URL AFTER \"Space:\" (ex. Rest_Haven_Cemetery) on the spacepage line. # If the Cemetery has a private website, add the URL on this line. (ex. Arlington National Cemetery has a private website so the URL would be entered - https://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/) # Here is the really great thing..... when using the CIB, it automatically adds the required Categories for you! You will see those automatically added Categories AFTER you save. (ex. adding parent= Fulton County, Georgia IN the CIB, automatically put the category [[Fulton County, Georgia]] at the top of my finished page. No extra work for us! # The TOC (table of contents) is not to be used unless there are over 200 profiles in the category. # The \"aka\" will show under the name of the Cemetery as the title in bold. #'''ALL CEMETERY CATEGORY PAGES MUST HAVE \"FULL NAME, CITY, STATE\" (spelled out, not abbreviated). For Example, there are TOO MANY Smith Cemeteries across the WORLD and if in Georgia it needs to be Smith Cemetery, Roswell, Georgia NOT just Smith Cemetery.''' # This Template Box is only on the Category Page.... never the Free Space Page. #If adding additional cemetery categories, such as Category:Georgia, Catholic Cemeteries, that category tag should be placed beneath the Category Info Box template. #The line ---- does not need to be placed below or above the CIB ==Cemetery SPACE Pages== Good news! No more adding tables with details and Tombstone Photos to the Cemetery Free Space pages!! Instead the Cemetery Free Space Page should have just the basic information on the Cemetery, a Photo (or two) of that represents the Cemetery, Listing of Famous People and any other details that are specific and important to the Cemetery. '''Do NOT list individual Profiles on the Cemetery Free Space Page.''' Profiles are to be placed on the Cemetery Category Page only (unless you are listing Famous/Infamous Profiles.) I know this might be a hard habit to break for some but it does save a tremendous amount of time while allowing the Category Page to be the Main Index. '''PLEASE put the following on every Free Space Page (at the top):''' This page is part of the [[:Space:Georgia Cemeteries Team|Georgia Cemeteries Team]]. See the [[:Category:YourCemeteryURL|NameOf Cemetery]] for people buried in this cemetery."
