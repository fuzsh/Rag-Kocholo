        "text": "V√≠ctor Mallet's comments on Spain's 2008 financial and real estate crisis, should disqualify him as an \"authority\"on unbiased, professional journalism in Asian countries. His narrative reminds me of History as seen from the bow of a pirate ship, of the city of London. Fine, Victor's problem is his ignorance of Asian languages and cultures, and it is also pretty obvious he doesn't have a clue about Spain, our body politic and our economy. If you had read Victor's comments on Spain in 2008, my country would be, in 2024, something like Burkina Faso. And it is my humble opinion that we have already beaten the UK in GDP per capita in PPP, by accounting for the shadow economy. Notwithstanding football and tennis. Poor Mariano Rajoy, former PM of Spain, crucified absurdly by this simplistic and pretty thick pirate from Perfidious Albion. Those English language Asian newspapers, are only read by a minority of Asians, and it might be true their editorial lines are influenced by authoritarian mores, and developing country cultures. However, Mallet, that hooligan, would be the least likely candidate to pass for a period movie \"British mandarin\" in Asia, in the worst style of Chris Patten, who couldn't tell the difference between a Cantonese street hawker and a Tibetan monk. Hollywood aside, these characters are very dangerous in their Imperial hubris - where is the Empire?\"-. Their British centric view of foreign nations, might have very sad consequences for the finances of countries where English is not spoken. He hurt Spain in the markets badly, and he doesn't have a clue about Spain. I feel he doesn't have a clue about Asia. There is something wonderful about certain Asian journalists, they can expose delicate realities in a considerate, diplomatic manner. Most definitely, this is not Mallet's style.\n\nIn 2018, the Nigerian journalist, Olukorede Yishau, debuted with his, 'In the Name of Our Father' which in 2021 was longlisted for The Nigeria Prize for Literature. In 2023 Netflix released a docuseries, 'In the Name of God: A Holy Betrayal' which handles the same issue of religious deception as Yishau's debut, albeit to a varying degree especially in excellence. While I recommend the series, I will not recommend Yishau's debut, unless as an example of a book where journalism murders creative writing and my sentiment is summarized here in this opening paragraph of my review: \"Yishau‚Äôs 2018 debut novel, 'In the Name of our Father,' that made it to the hallowed longlist of the Nigeria Prize for Literature in 2021 is one of those novels that promises to tell a great story ‚Äì a promise the reader would discover few pages into the novel is like that of Nigerian leaders (who also featured as characters in the novel): this promise never materializes. In fact, at the end of the novel, the reader feels, and rightly so, that they are being mocked for believing in this promise.\" You can read the full review here: https://lnkd.in/dpZU4dXd Meanwhile the author is back in 2024 with 'After the End,' and we can only hope that things have greatly improved.\n\nüïí Only one week left to apply! üì¢ Spheres of Influence Uncovered at n-ost - Network for border crossing journalism is looking for stories.

I never expected a letter from the CRA to deliver such a ‚Äúpinch me‚Äù moment. The news felt surreal. I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night.

It‚Äôs a proud moment for our team. It validates our original journalism, journalistic standards, and the fact that our journalism can benefit Canadians coast to coast to coast‚Äîa real first for social purpose and solutions journalism.

A new Nordicom Review article highlights the role of these other genres ‚Äì letters to the editor, celebratory items, and editorials ‚Äì and how they have developed over a hundred years. \"Over time, fewer voices are heard, and a much narrower a section of the audience is celebrated, leading us to conclude that newspapers in the period of the party press saw its audience in term of class, in the period of the omnibus newspaper more as very inclusive population, and in later times more address a segmented audience as representatives of different kinds of elites\", says Ida Willig, one of the authors behind the article. The study helps to explain how different epochs in press history played out in parts of the press that are often overlooked, and how historical decisions taken long ago still effect the future. The article should be of interest to anybody studying news media in any of the Nordic countries, but of course especially to scholars of media history. Read the article ‚ÄúSo much more than news: Revisiting press epochs from an explorative study of non-news genres in Danish newspapers, 1918‚Äì2018‚Äù by Ida Willig, Mette Bengtsson, Mark Blach-√òrsten and Hanne J√∏rndrup: üîó https://lnkd.in/dhPv-RxU #mediaresearch #mediahistory #newspapers #news #OpenAccess #Nordics #newsmedia\n\nNEW NORDICOM REVIEW ARTICLE! Read it Open Access here: https://lnkd.in/e_NgBaPX The article, written by Johan Farkas and Sabina Schousboe, examines how journalists in Denmark use and define the terms fake news, junk news, misinformation, and disinformation. The study finds that journalists often disagree on which concepts and definitions to use, resulting in a messy conceptual landscape. The article shows how this messiness arises from a tension within the journalistic ideal of objectivity, as journalists often search for value-neutral concepts, but ‚Äì in doing so ‚Äì end up altering meanings and terminologies in process. \"Fake news and related phenomena have been key topics of academic, journalistic, and political concern in recent years. This study adds to our understanding of how journalists use the terms fake news, junk news, misinformation, and disinformation as well as how these concepts often end up having conflicting meanings in journalism\", says Johan Farkas. üìç \"Facts, values, and the epistemic authority of journalism: How journalists use and define the terms fake news, junk news, misinformation, and disinformation\" #OpenAccess #fakenews #junknews #misinformation #disinformation #journalism #Denmark"
