        "text": "12:30 PM - 2:00 PMMulti-Stakeholder Engagement in Evidence Synthesis\n\nBackground: Involving stakeholders in evidence syntheses may increase relevance and uptake, while reducing health and social inequities. Stakeholders include interested groups and people: health care providers, patients and caregivers, payers of health research, payers of health services, publishers, policymakers, researchers, product makers, program managers, and the public.\n\nObjectives: Our project objectives are to: A) Identify, map, and synthesize qualitative and quantitative findings related to stakeholder engagement in evidence syntheses B) Explore stakeholder perspectives on how stakeholder engagement in evidence syntheses promotes health equity C) Develop equity-oriented guidance on methods for stakeholder engagement in evidence synthesis D) Develop guidance on methods for evaluating stakeholder engagement in evidence syntheses E) Develop a guideline for reporting stakeholder engagement in evidence syntheses (PRISMA Extension).\n\nMethods: We will co-produce 1 scoping review, 3 systematic reviews and 1 evidence map focusing on a) methods, b) barriers and facilitators, c) conflict of interest considerations, d) impacts, and e) equity considerations of stakeholder engagement in evidence synthesis. Next, we will contextualize the findings of step 1 by assessing a sample of evidence syntheses reporting on engaging with stakeholders and through interviews with stakeholders who have been involved in producing evidence syntheses. We will use these findings to develop draft guidance checklists and will assess agreement with each item through an international survey. The guidance checklists will be co-produced and finalized at a consensus meeting with stakeholders. We will co-produce a dissemination plan with our stakeholders and work collaboratively to improve adoption of our guidance by key organizations.\n\nResults: We will present our experiences establishing an international advisory group which will include additional representatives of our 11 stakeholder groups. We will present the preliminary results of the series of reviews.\n\nConclusions: We aim to develop guidance for stakeholder engagement in health care evidence syntheses. This guidance will be co-produced with stakeholders, including patients, caregivers and the public. This guidance will be of interest to individuals or organizations that conduct evidence reviews, such as Cochrane, Campbell, JBI and GRADE.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMMapping the Evidence Related to Health and Climate Change Mitigation\n\nBackground: To avoid waste in research, we first need to establish what research has already been undertaken. The results of the mapping reviews can be used inform research priorities and research funding; however, presenting the results of an evidence mapping review visually can be challenging.\n\nObjectives: To explore how to visually present the research evidence landscape measuring or evaluating the public acceptability of local actions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change.\n\nMethods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and HMIC for relevant research, as well as reference checking of relevant articles and related reviews using the snowballing technique with six iterations. Articles met our inclusion criteria if they reported on empirical evidence (such as surveys or interviews) to evaluate the public acceptability of local actions (such as those involving clean air zones, eco-housing, land and waste management, and green energy supply) to mitigate climate change or provide adaptation and resilience strategies. We used the shiny app EviAtlas to present a summary of the research undertaken to date. We used evidence atlases to present the data by geographical location using the longitude and latitude of the stated locations and heat maps to visualize further details of the research categorized by type of local action.\n\nResults: A total of 1,074 records were retrieved, of which 116 representing 111 studies met our inclusion criteria. Using the evidence map feature in EviAtlas provided clear visualizations by location (Figure 1), and using the heat map feature in EviAtlas provided a longitudinal summary of the actions most commonly researched (Figure 2).\n\nConclusions: Using the open software EviAtlas, we were able to provide research funders and those setting priority-setting agendas with a visualization of what research has been undertaken to date and where. EviAtlas may be particularly useful where geographical location is important and where there is a large number of included studies to summarize. Patient and public involvement was paramount to our research and helped focus the research on local action relevant to the public, particularly in relation to socioeconomic status.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMOrphan drugs – major evidence gaps and persisting unmet medical needs\n\nBackground: In the EU alone, about 30 million people are affected by more than 6000 different rare diseases, thus representing a major public health issue. The development of drugs for rare diseases (orphan drugs) used to be commercially less attractive due to small markets, resulting in huge unmet medical needs in affected patients. This led to legislation to incentivise orphan drug development, such as the EU Orphan Regulation of 2000. Since then, there has been a sharp increase in the number of orphan drugs approved in the EU.\n\nObjectives: To assess whether the increase in orphan drug approvals has led to an evidence based improvement in patient relevant outcomes for a relevant number of patients with rare diseases.\n\nMethods: Results of health technology assessments (HTAs) of orphan drugs in Germany were analysed to determine the frequency of an added benefit (i.e. an improvement in patient relevant outcomes) compared to the standard of care. The evidence underlying these assessments was examined. Clustering of orphan drugs in certain therapeutic indications was evaluated by comparing approved indications with all known rare diseases.\n\nResults: No proof of added benefit was shown for 54% of the research questions on orphan drugs. This was mostly due to the lack of robust evidence compared to the standard of care. If there was a high unmet medical need in an indication, an added benefit was twice as likely. Clustering of orphan drugs was evident in oncology.\n\nConclusions: Major evidence gaps exist for many orphan drugs, hampering informed treatment decisions by patients and doctors, potentially resulting in suboptimal care. While there are clusters of orphan drugs in some therapeutic indications, a large number of patients with rare diseases remain without adequate treatment options. Therefore, orphan drug regulations need to be reformed to improve the generation of robust evidence in comparison with the standard of care and guide research to indications with the highest unmet medical needs outside of existing clusters. Patient involvement: Patient representatives are regularly involved in German HTAs in an advisory capacity. Their opinions are taken into account for decisions on the added benefit of orphan drugs.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMCore outcome set development for intervention research on snakebite in South Asia: methodological case study\n\nBackground: Core outcome set (COS) are a consensus-derived set of outcomes that should be minimally measured in future research or practice for a specific condition. A COS for intervention research on snakebites in South Asia was developed, and several new methodological insights were obtained.\n\nObjectives: To describe and discuss methodological insights obtained from COS development on snakebites in South Asia.\n\nMethods: A case-study approach is being taken, wherein the COS development process is described in brief together with methodological insights for future methods work.\n\nResults: The COS development process involves results from a systematic review to develop an initial list of outcomes for a Delphi survey to develop COS for five intervention groups. The two-stage Delphi survey involved healthcare providers, patients and the public, and potential COS users. This was followed by a final consensus meeting and workshops to finalise “what” and “how” outcomes in COS should be measured in future. Insights around setting scope (global versus regional), modular design of Delphi, and several challenges for patient and public involvement (most people with a snakebite have poor literary, and there are no organised survivor groups).\n\nConclusions: The case study suggests the need for revising the current COS-STAndards for Development (STAD) with more nuanced standards, in relation to scope, and stakeholder involvement thresholds. It also indicates the need for developing guidance on modalities for patients and public engagement for disease conditions for which no organised survivor groups exist and in populations in which literacy is poor. Patient and public involvement: Snakebite patients, their caregivers, and community representatives were involved in the COS development process.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMConstruction of minimum data set for core outcome set in real-world settings: A data-driven approach\n\nBackground: Hundreds of core outcome sets (COS) have been developed for standardized outcome reporting in clinical trials, whereas their usage in real-world settings is largely limited because of the data availability and difficulty in data cleansing. Although a few COS have matched core data sets (CDS), the CDS generally consist of description of data elements but lack of details on how to locate these elements in a given real-world databases and how the data elements are matched to each outcome in the COS. This study aimed to propose a data-driven approach to build minimum data set (MDS) for the COS. Study design: We used a set of healthcare quality measures and a set of real-world data elements, both released by the healthcare officials in China, as an illustrating example of building MDS for COS. We first compiled a data element set with the source and description of the data elements extracted. We also include a list of quality measures along with characteristics and calculation requirements. We then map the data elements to each of the quality measures according to their requirements and created a relational database that stores these mapping relationships. We then build a platform based on this relational database to allow an interface for the input of quality measures and the presentation of the outcome, which is the MDS that is calculated as the union set of the data elements mapped to the selected measures. Conclusion and implication: This is an ongoing project funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. The project innovatively applies the concept of MDS on COS by adopting a data-driven method to construct the MDS from existing real-world data instead of proposing an independent set of date elements based on experts’ consensus. This approach should ease the effort on data cleansing for COS, saving the cost of extra data collection and promoting the more efficient use of existing real-world data. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: With the methodology proposed by this study, more core outcome sets can be applicable in real-world clinical practices instead of being largely restricted to clinical trials.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMCan the Cochrane RCT classifier be used to speed up screening for a qualitative evidence synthesis? A retrospective evaluation\n\nBackground: Study selection is time and resource intensive. Using machine learning to identify studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria can decrease time use. The Cochrane randomized controlled trial (RCT) classifier has been trained to recognize and classify RCTs into two categories: likely or unlikely to be an RCT. The quick identification of references—for example, RCTs, which are unlikely to meet the inclusion criteria of a qualitative evidence synthesis (QES)—can speed up the study selection process.\n\nObjectives: The first objective of this study is to evaluate whether we can use the Cochrane RCT classifier to identify nonqualitative studies that can be excluded or deprioritized during screening for a QES. The second objective is to evaluate whether there is a cutoff point in the likely-to-be-an-RCT category beyond which no qualitative studies are lost.\n\nMethods: Using a preidentified number of QES, we will perform the following: - extract the included studies; - run them through the Cochrane RCT Classifier in EPPI Reviewer - map studies that are predicted “likely to be an RCT” - create a combined map of the predictions for all included studies across the included QES; and - explore the studies that are classified as having a high likelihood of being an RCT to determine how they are different from the other included studies that were not given this classification.\n\nResults: This retrospective evaluation is ongoing (completion June 2023). The results will be the map over qualitative studies that were classified as likely to be an RCT as well as the overview of how these studies are different from the studies that did not receive this classification.\n\nConclusions: Based on the mapping of the studies, we will conclude whether there is a threshold that reviewers can apply to automatically exclude or deprioritize studies based on their high likelihood of being an RCT. This would enable reviewers to screen faster and prioritize certain search hits for screening above others.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Speeding up the review process allows evidence to become available faster to consumers. Qualitative research brings consumer perspectives forward.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMAre patient-reported outcomes evaluated in randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses regarding reconstruction methods after distal gastrectomy?\n\nBackground: Reconstruction method following gastrectomy affects the quality of life, which is often measured by patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Incorporating PROs within clinical trials provides a patient’s perspective for shared decision-making among patients and healthcare providers. However, it remains unclear how much attention is paid to PROs when conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses (MAs) regarding reconstructions after distal gastrectomy.\n\nObjectives: To evaluate how many RCTs and MAs incorporate PROs, and how the PRO is reported in RCTs.\n\nMethods: This study is a cross-sectional analysis. We comprehensively searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library for topics that included gastrectomy and reconstruction. We included patients who underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. We included RCTs and MAs comparing postoperative outcomes among reconstruction types. We described the number of RCTs which measured PROs and MAs which incorporated PROs into the outcomes and then assessed the completion of the CONSORT-PRO checklist adaptation for all RCTs reporting PROs.\n\nResults: We identified 18 articles on 13 studies, and 10 articles of systematic reviews with MA. Of the 13 RCTs, 7 studies (53.8%) measured PROs, including quality-of-life and study-specific questionnaires. However, no article completes the CONSORT-PRO checklist adaptation. The remaining six studies assessed surgical outcomes (e.g., reconstruction time, postoperative complications) and endoscopic findings of gastritis (e.g. RGB score) without PROs. In terms of systematic reviews with MA, only one study (10%), a Cochrane Review, set PROs as the outcome. Four studies of the remaining 9 included non-randomized studies.\n\nConclusions: Our study found a disparity between the use of PROs in RCTs and these of MAs. No RCTs using PROs adhered to the CONSORT-PRO adaptation. Our findings suggest that RCTs assessing postoperative quality of life among reconstruction types need to improve PRO reporting, and future MAs should incorporate PROs. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: As reconstruction methods affect postoperative quality of life, shared decision-making in surgery is necessary among patients and medical personnel. There was no direct patient or healthcare consumer in this project, but the increasing number of accurate reporting PROs in RCTs and MAs will become direct benefits to these groups.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMRisk Ratio vs Odds Ratio: Optimal presentation in GRADE evidence profiles\n\nBackground: Evidence profiles (EPs), used for evidence-to-decision processes by guideline developers, present relative effects, baseline risk, and risk difference (RD). Because of ease of interpretation, reviewers most often report risk ratios (RR) and calculate RD with 95% CI through application of the RR to baseline risk.\n\nObjectives: To highlight limitations of applying RR to baseline risk for RD calculation in EPs.\n\nMethods: Through methods support for a World Health Organization guideline, we produced EPs summarizing the effectiveness of specially formulated foods compared with counselling alone in children with moderate wasting on anthropometric recovery (desirable outcome). We wanted to present the RD stratified by mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Without receiving SFFs, patients with MUAC in the lower end of the moderate wasting range (115 to 119 mm; worse prognosis) had a 50% chance of anthropometric recovery, whereas those in the higher end (120 to < 125mm; better prognosis) had a 72% chance. We initially applied the treatment effect to the baseline probability of each prognostic group, encountered problems, and identified a solution.\n\nResults: As absolute effects of treatments are always larger in those with a higher baseline risk of poor outcomes, we anticipated finding greater benefit in patients with worse prognosis compared with patients with better prognosis. However, applying the RR to each baseline chance produced counterintuitive results. Applying the treatment RR of 1.29 produced an RD of 145 more anthropometric recoveries per 1,000 for those with worse prognosis and 207 more per 1,000 for those with better prognosis, suggesting that children with better prognosis will achieve greater benefit compared with those with worse prognosis. We subsequently changed the output from RR to OR, which resulted in 180 more anthropometric recoveries per 1,000 in those with worse prognosis and 125 more per 1,000 in those with better prognosis. This RD agreed with our expectation that patients with worse prognosis can expect greater benefit from the intervention.\n\nConclusions: When the probability of a desirable outcome is high, OR applied to the baseline probability will yield a more accurate estimate of absolute benefit than the RR. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMA Scoping Review of Published and Ongoing Prospective Meta-Analyses in Health Research\n\nBackground: Prospective meta-analyses (PMA) may reduce many of the issues that can occur in retrospective meta-analyses, such as reducing biases in publication and selective outcome reporting. However, common misunderstandings of the PMA methodology remain, leading to inappropriate and/or suboptimal implementation by researchers.\n\nObjectives: To investigate the landscape of the published and ongoing prospective meta-analyses.\n\nMethods: We systematically searched the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) for PMAs from inception to January 2023, and two reviewers screened these studies in COVIDENCE. The results of this search were combined with a search of medical databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) up to 2018 to capture PMAs that started prior to the launch and subsequently increasingly wide implementation of PROSPERO in 2011. All PMAs conducted in human health research were eligible for inclusion. All records were double-screened, and data were double extracted, with conflicts resolved through consensus.\n\nResults: We identified 1,445 studies in the PROSPERO search. One hundred thirty-two were screened at full text, and 32 were identified as PMAs. These identified PMAs were combined with the 43 articles of the second search of medical databases for extraction and analysis. We found that the number of published PMAs has been increasing over time (Figure 1). PMAs have been conducted across a range of health areas, and across all continents. Identified PMAs varied reporting on details, such as collaboration structure, or methods used to identify studies for inclusion. There were 1,091 records on PROSPERO that claimed to be a PMA but were found not to meet the eligibility criteria because they were including studies retrospectively.\n\nConclusions: Whilst PMAs are increasing in numbers, many researchers still do not understand what a PMA constitutes, with over 1,000 standard meta-analyses on PROSPERO falsely labelling themselves as PMAs. In addition, reporting of PMAs is currently inconsistent and lacks important details. Therefore, a standardised procedure for reporting PMAs and greater education on this method are crucial to facilitate the conduct and interpretation of impactful PMAs. This scoping review will help inform the development of such standardised reporting tools. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMDissemination of Evidence-Based Medicine by Taiwan Evidence-Based Medicine Association\n\nBackground: Taiwan Evidence-Based Medicine Association (TEBMA) was established in 2007 to promote the implementation of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). It is not clear what impact TEBMA has on the dissemination of EBM.\n\nObjectives: The current study aimed to investigate how TEBMA disseminated EBM in Taiwan.\n\nMethods: We reviewed the annual reports of TEBMA. In addition, we interviewed the stakeholders of TEBMA to investigate the effectiveness of the activities of TEBMA.\n\nResults: Over the 15 years, TEBMA provided abundant EBM-related activities, such as workshops, annual conferences, and EBM competitions. A variety of workshops were conducted every 1 to 2 months with the duration of 8-12 hours for beginners, instructors, advanced experts, and researchers. The lectures comprise basic and advanced implementation, such as how to teach EBM, how to conduct systematic review and meta-analysis, and how to implement EBM. Invited lecturers came from worldwide, such as Taiwan, Singapore, America, and so on. The average number of attendees for workshops was about 350 each year. There were decreased numbers of attendees to 200 each year in the recent three years of COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, there was a steady increase in the publication of EBM-related articles in Taiwan, especially in systematic review and meta-analysis. In addition, TEBMA has hosted national conferences since 2008. The average number of attendees from hospitals and universities in Taiwan for the annual conference was about 450 each year. Furthermore, TEBMA set up a peer-reviewed journal called Evidence Counts with two issues each year. Overall, the active members of TEBMA are increasing year by year. Members have a privileged discount for all activities above.\n\nConclusions: TEBMA has important achievements in the dissemination of EBM. With the efforts of TEBMA to promote EBM, EBM has been an accredited important skill for personal career and hospital management. The establishment of TEBMA is successful in the promotion of EBM. Our findings provide evidence to show a model in the dissemination of EBM. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMInvestigating Impact of Dietary Patterns: Can Consistent Findings Between Controlled Trials and Observational Evidence Improve Confidence?\n\nBackground: Designs of studies examining dietary patterns (DPs) carry different limitations including short durations and conditions not reflective of the real world in controlled trials (CTs) and confounders associated with dietary choices and health outcomes in observational studies (OSs). Examining both study designs may allow for a more accurate understanding of the impact of DPs. Objective: To compare the direction of findings, effect sizes and certainty of evidence (COE) between CTs and OSs examining the relationship between a vegan DP and body mass index (BMI).\n\nMethods: An overview of systematic reviews (SRs) was conducted by healthcare consumers by searching five databases for SRs published from 2018 to January 2023 that examined adults in the general population who followed a vegan, compared with a nonvegetarian, DP. SRs could include primary studies with any study design. If COE was not assessed in included SRs, authors assessed COE for CTs and OSs separately using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) method.\n\nResults: A total of 524 abstracts were screened, 73 full SRs were reviewed, and 5 SRs examined the impact of a vegan diet on BMI. Three SRs included 11 CTs ranging from 12 to 26 weeks in duration and concluded that a vegan diet reduced BMI compared with no intervention or another intervention diet. However, nearly all included CTs demonstrated some risk of bias and sample sizes were relatively small, resulting in low COE. Two SRs focused on OSs, summarized 67 cross-sectional and cohort studies, many reflecting several years of follow-up, and described low risk of bias in individual studies. COE was not marked down for any domain but was low owing to study design. Pooled mean effect size from OSs (-1.72 kg/m2) was similar to the range in mean reduction found in CTs comparing a vegan diet with no intervention (no pooled data; mean reduction from -1.03 to -3.90 kg/m2). Conclusion: Interpreting the full body of evidence when examining the impact of a DP revealed consistent findings across study designs and led to improved confidence in findings. Methodologists may consider upgrading OSs for plausible confounding if results are consistent with CTs.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMPrevention and control of surgical site infection: preliminary results of a best practice implementation project\n\nBackground: Surgical site infections (SSIs) can cause significant harm to the patient, such as increased length of stay, readmissions, suffering or even death. Depending on several factors, SSIs can occur in approximately 2%-5% of inpatient surgeries and, for certain types such as abdominal surgery, can range from 4%-25%. By preventing it, professionals can reduce the risk of adverse events and improve patient safety.\n\nObjectives: To implement evidence-based recommendations and promote compliance with the best evidence-based recommendations on prevention and control of SSIs in a central operating room.\n\nMethods: This project follows the JBI Evidence Implementation framework, which included three phases: i) Establishing a project team and undertaking the baseline audit; ii) Providing feedback and implementing strategies based on JBI Getting Research into Practice (GRiP) framework; and iii) A follow-up audit to assess the outcomes and plan for sustainability.\n\nResults: The project is being developed. A baseline audit was carried out (100-patient sample) and identified inconsistencies in professionals’ adherence to the bundle of SSIs prevention and control interventions (9 criteria). Areas of noncompliance were highlighted (Figure 1), including inconsistent handover (9%), operating room doors unreasonably open too long (17%), and unaccomplished with trichotomy criteria (46%). Feedback was given to the staff team, and results were analysed against the nine criteria through discussion groups to identify the noncompliance causes. After, a root cause analysis identified four significant barriers: lack of knowledge regarding interventions bundle; unfamiliarity with a structured and standardized clinical handover; manual and obsolete doors; and reduced number of cutting machines. An intervention plan to mitigate barriers and increase compliance, a follow-up audit and a sustainability plan are under development.\n\nConclusions: The improvement of compliance with those evidence-based recommendations will reduce adverse events associated with SSIs in inpatient surgeries in this central operating room. Consequently, we hope that this project will lead to better health outcomes, with a positive impact on patients’ safety, costs and healthcare quality.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMValues and preferences in asthma patients for health care decision making: a systematic literature review.\n\nBackground: Effective asthma management requires clear communication between the patient and the healthcare provider. Patient values and preferences are the relative importance people place on health outcomes. Decisions for asthma treatments aligned with patient values and preferences may make treatments more readily adhered to.\n\nObjectives: To identify patients’ and caregivers’ values and preferences for asthma treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and to describe the instruments and/or techniques to determine them.\n\nMethods: Paired reviewers independently screened six databases from inception to February 2023. We included quantitative and qualitative studies of patients with asthma or their caregivers, eliciting values and preferences about ICS treatment.\n\nResults: Initially, we identified 25,429 studies in our searches. After title and abstract and full-text screening, we identified 10 quantitative and 10 qualitative studies that met our inclusion criteria (Figure 1). From the 10 quantitative studies, 4 (40%) implemented a discrete choice approach to elicit utilities, 1 (10%) used EQ-5D-5l and visual analogue scales (VAS), 3 (30%) applied questionnaires or surveys), and 2 (20%) used discrete choice and willingness to pay (WTP). Regarding the qualitative studies, 8 studies (80%) were cross-sectional studies, 1 (10%) was a focus group study, and 1 (10%) was an ethnographic interview. Qualitative findings showed with moderate certainty evidence that fears about adverse events were a significant concern when patients and caregivers selected their preferred treatment and patients valued treatments capable of relieving symptoms (Table 1).\n\nConclusions: From the quantitative studies, we have identified different techniques implemented for eliciting values and preferences in patients with asthma receiving ICS. In qualitative studies, we have found five key themes to address patient values and preferences in asthma treatment with ICS. Although we are still finalizing data extraction for quantitative studies, our findings suggest that multiple instruments and themes have been used to determine patients’ values and preferences and how patients value the relative importance of the main health status.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Our systematic review summarizes relevant research evidence about patient values and preferences for asthma treatment with ICS to facilitate the integration of values and preferences in healthcare decision processes.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMUtilizing evidence of Cochrane in decision making by policy makers: Gaps needs to be filled\n\nBackground: Cochrane helps in generating evidence across the world by collecting, analyzing and critically appraising the findings of different languages. A total of 90% of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines were cited by at least one Cochrane review. Most of the reviews are of low or moderate level of evidence. There is a strong need to improve this certainty of evidence, especially health issues related to developing countries, to utilize resources adequately and efficiently.\n\nObjectives: What are the major gaps in decision-making by policy makers, and how can these gaps be filled?\n\nMethods: We searched different websites for health priorities in India and related present evidence by Cochrane. For various health issues, evidence is of very low/low/moderate level, and evidence even is lacking for research questions.\n\nResults: The lack of evidence was mainly found in intervention due to difference in treatment and difference in nature and severity of disease, concomitantly taking more than one treatment/alternative form the therapy such as Ayurveda, Homeopathic, and unpublished data, etc. Various suggestive gaps need to be filled by facilitating clinical trial in medical institutions, training and encouraging all the steps required in conducting interventional studies, including translational research with faster approval for intellectual property rights and including regulatory approvals. There is need to encourage clinical trial in Ayurveda/homeopathic with standardization of interventions and methodology. Publications need to be encouraged by master and PhD students from these healthcare establishments.\n\nConclusions: Founded major gaps are at various levels such as participants level, institutional level, technical and financial agencies, etc. The role of Cochrane affiliate centers is very crucial in not only helping in training but also informing about steps to be taken by policy makers to generate evidence. This will help them to make informed decisions on various health priorities.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Involving participants in filling these gaps is very important to find out how better can be resources utilized by policy makers and Cochrane affiliate centers.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMNocturnal enuresis in children: Rapid scoping review and semi-structured interviews to inform development of a core outcome set\n\nBackground: Quantitative synthesis of interventional studies is challenging owing to variations in outcome measures (domain, measurement, metric, aggregation and timepoints) and missing outcome data. Additionally, the relevance of outcome measures to people with lived experience is often unknown. Cochrane Incontinence planned to harmonise outcomes across reviews to ensure relevancy and quality.\n\nObjectives: To facilitate the development of a core outcome set (COS) for use in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews by generating a list of outcome measures.\n\nMethods: Following COMET methodology, this work used a mixed-methods design comprising a scoping review and semistructured interviews. Nine databases were searched for outcome measures reported in RCTs and systematic reviews published from 2017 to 2022 (search date: 11/05/2022). A date restriction was applied, limiting the synthesised articles to those published between 2018 and 2022. Eligibility was children with enuresis (all subtypes), all interventions, comparators and outcomes. Two reviewers screened 20% of the records at both screening stages, with one screening the remaining. Two reviewers piloted the data extraction form with 10 articles, with one extracting the remaining articles. Semistructured interviews took place online (April to June 2022) with a convenience sample of six participants recruited by snowballing utilising existing contacts with patient organisations and professional bodies. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed abductively using the framework method. Findings were integrated into the COMET taxonomy within five core outcome areas (mortality, physiological and clinical, life impact, resource use, and adverse events).\n\nResults: One hundred twenty-eight outcomes were extracted verbatim from 38 synthesised articles and charted to the taxonomy alongside 262 codes generated from the interview transcripts. Enuretic episodes were a commonly reported outcome domain identified as important by participants. However, heterogeneity exists in descriptions, timings and measurements. In contrast to patient preferences, outcome domains relating to life impact and resource use were lacking in scoping review findings, possibly due to a focus on trials.\n\nConclusions: Reviews of interventions for treating nocturnal enuresis could be more relevant to people with lived experiences by capturing social, role and emotional functioning. In addition, outcome measures relating to enuretic episodes should be standardised to facilitate meta-analysis. Subsequent multistakeholder stages are required to finalise the development of a COS.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMCONSENSYS: an instrument to support CONtextual SENsitivity in SYStematic reviews\n\nBackground: Systematic reviews are considered important in answering what works, for whom and in which circumstances. They often include a section on implications for policymakers and practitioners, in which they discuss relevant options to engage with. Implementation sections are coloured by the cultural background, theoretical and disciplinary perspective of the reviewers formulating them. They do not necessarily consider local contexts in which the evidence needs to be applied; hence, the recommendations may be too general to be useful. When policymakers and practitioners implement systematic review findings, the evidence presented needs to be translated to their local context.\n\nMethods: We applied a multimethod approach in two main phases: in a developmental phase, we conducted a literature review and inventoried theoretical models and frameworks addressing contextual dimensions affecting decision-making and extracted core theoretical categories from these models. We then conducted five transnational focus groups to investigate how to best translate research evidence into implications for practice and policy. Based on these results, we developed a draft of the guiding instrument. In a testing phase, we first conducted a face validity procedure by inviting comments from experts in the field and then piloted the instrument on existing review projects and an ongoing mixed-methods review.\n\nResults: CONSENSYS is an instrument in the form of a checklist. It contains 52 contextual factors categorised as either of ecological and sociocultural relevance or pitched as an influencing actor. CONSENSYS facilitates the transfer from review evidence into practice.\n\nConclusions: CONSENSYS is a theoretical framework that serves as a structure thereby assisting (a) reviewers to formulate context-specific implications for policy and practice and (b) end users of systematic reviews to translate the review evidence into local contexts. It is the first rigorously developed instrument that focusses on implications for policy and practice sections in systematic reviews.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We engaged practitioners, academics and policymakers in the focus group study. The face validity procedure of the drafted instrument was organized with reviewers and methodologists.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMLandscape of nutrition or diet-related randomised controlled trials: data from protocols published between 2012 and 2022\n\nBackground: As part of a project to consolidate reporting guidance for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), protocols of RCTs and systematic reviews of nutritional interventions, it was important to understand the nutrition interventions research landscape over the past decade.\n\nObjectives: To assess the nutrition or diet-related interventions research landscape using data from RCT protocols published as research articles between 2012 and 2022.\n\nMethods: We searched six databases for eligible protocols published between January 2012 and March 2022. Data extracted included bibliometrics, study scope (population, intervention, comparator, outcome and study design) and research transparency practices (protocol registration, conflicts of interest and funding statements, and mention of reporting guidelines). We screened the ‘Instructions for Authors’ webpages of each journal contributing publications to our sample to check whether they endorsed reporting guidelines.\n\nResults: We included 1,068 protocols. The frequency of publication of RCT protocols as research articles increased annually, with a mean of 161 (range: 155 to 163) publications per year. Healthy adults (n=342; 32.0%) and older individuals (n=350; 32.7%) made up the most frequent target population. Isolated nutrition or diet-related interventions (n=724; 67.8%) were most frequently studied, with supplementation (n=405; 37.9%) being the most common type of intervention. The most frequent primary outcome reported was clinical status (n=308; 28.8%). Most protocols described a single-centre (n=838; 78.5%), two-arm (n=844; 79.1%), parallel (n=1,014; 94.9%) RCT. Of the 148 journals in which the included protocols were published, general medical journals (n=518; 48.5%) contributed more publications than methods journals (n=479; 44.9%), and nutrition journals (n=71; 6.6%). The SPIRIT statement was endorsed by 33.8% (n=50) of the journals, CONSORT by 75.3% (n=111) and TIDieR by 2.7% (n=4). In 32.1%, 27.8% and 1.9% of publications, the authors mentioned SPIRIT, CONSORT and TIDieR, respectively. Most protocols (n=1,006; 94.2%) reported the study registration and included conflicts of interest (n=952; 89.1%) or funding (n=994; 93.2%) statements.\n\nConclusions: The number of nutrition or diet-related RCT protocols being published as research articles is increasing over time, showing the importance of this type of publication. The adoption of research transparency practices by researchers and journals can still improve.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMDo healthcare professionals and consumers prefer reporting statements based on statistically significant differences or do they prefer non-binary options?\n\nBackground: For decades, the p value-based interpretation and reporting of results dominated the publications. Nowadays, the scientific community agrees that this binary approach is not enough. A systemic reform is necessary for moving from this binary approach to some other non-binary options. Some of them, which were discussed in the last Cochrane Handbook version (2019), are the point estimate, the confidence interval, and the minimal important difference, suggesting some narrative statements. However, it is not clear how healthcare professionals and consumers agree with this approach and, even more important, whether all retrieve the same conclusions when they look at some specific results.\n\nObjectives: To evaluate how healthcare professionals and consumers interpret results and which preferred reporting style is for them.\n\nMethods: We are conducting an online survey among healthcare professionals and consumers. These stakeholders have to choose the binary or non-binary option that better expresses the results for the following scenario: After exhaustive literature searches, a systematic review identified only two pivotal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of drug X versus placebo (P) in patients with a rare genetic disease. The risk of bias for all domains was low in both RCTs, and there were no important differences in populations and results between both studies. The combined results were: Mortality risk: X 26%(10/39) and P 45%(18/40) Risk difference: X 19% lower (95% CI 40% lower to 1% higher) Risk Ratio: 0.57 (95% CI 0.30 a 1.08) P = 0.0721 *95% CI: 95% Confidence Interval (represents the range of values you expect your estimate to fall between if you redo your trial, within a 95% level of confidence).\n\nResults: Will be shown at the colloquium.\n\nConclusions: It will be interesting to see which preferred reporting statements are for healthcare professionals and for consumers. Besides, we will know the level of agreement or disagreement among these groups, which is critical for the patient-physician communication process.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Healthcare professionals and consumers responded to the survey.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMAnalysis of continuous outcomes when a large proportion of the data are zeroes\n\nBackground: Continuous outcomes are not straightforward to analyse if there are a large proportion of zeroes, as frequently occurs with outcomes such as volume of blood transfused for conditions for which blood transfusion is not always necessary. Should we analyse volume per person randomised (PPR) or per person transfused (PPT)? If numbers randomised and transfused are both known, we can convert between PPR and PPT using the relationship between sums of squares familiar from analysis of variance, but several statistical and practical issues arise. Statistical Issues: Standard methods of analysis for continuous outcomes rely on the Central Limit Theorem. When the underlying distribution is extreme owing to a large proportion of zeroes in the data, an intention-to-treat analysis (PPR) may require sample sizes of many hundreds or even thousands before the sampling distribution of the mean is closely approximated by the normal distribution. A PPT analysis will converge with smaller sample sizes, but if only a small proportion required transfusion, this still requires a large number randomised. Practical Issues: Some trials report the mean volume transfused without reporting the number receiving a transfusion and so would be excluded from a PPT analysis. It is sometimes unclear whether a trial has reported PPR or PPT. Converting between PPR and PPT may produce impossible values (negative sums of squares), helping to clarify this. This may also highlight cases where a standard error has been mislabelled as a standard deviation.\n\nConclusions: When extracting these sorts of outcomes, it is important to be sure which value (PPR or PPT) was reported and to ensure that pooled results are all based on the same denominator. Extracted data should be carefully assessed for unusual or impossible values. There is no clear answer as to which analysis is best under any given circumstance; it may be useful to present both and note where the sample sizes available may not be sufficient to meet the underlying assumptions. We have produced a spreadsheet (available on request) to convert between PPR and PPT, including error flags and plots to help diagnose issues with the data extracted.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMThe impact of blinding on trial results: a systematic review and meta-analysis\n\nBackground: Blinding, the concealment of the arm to which participants have been randomized, is an important consideration for assessing risk of bias of randomized trials. A growing body of evidence has, however, yielded inconsistent results on whether trials without blinding produce biased findings. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence addressing whether trials with and without blinding produce different results.\n\nMethods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Reviews, JBI EBP, and Web of Science, from inception to May 2022, for studies comparing the results of trials with and without blinding. Pairs of reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to screen search results for eligible studies, extract data, and assess the certainty (quality) of evidence using the GRADE approach. We pooled the results of studies comparing trials with and without the blinding of patients, healthcare providers/investigators, and outcome assessors/adjudicators using frequentist random-effects meta-analyses.\n\nResults: We identified 47 studies. We found low certainty evidence that trials without the blinding of patients and healthcare providers, outcome assessors/adjudicators, and/or patients may slightly overestimate treatment effects. Limitations: Nearly all studies were rated at high risk of bias, primarily because of potential for confounding. Our results are further limited by the potential inconsistency in the direction of the effect of blinding. For example, although we anticipate that trials without blinding overestimate the beneficial effects of treatments, it is possible that the direction of bias caused by lack of blinding may not be consistent. That is, in certain circumstances, open-label trials may overestimate effects and in other circumstances, they may underestimate effects.\n\nConclusions: Our systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that blinding may influence trial results in select situations—albeit the findings are of low certainty, and the magnitude of effect is modest. Our findings have implications for clinical trialists and for evidence users interpreting the results of unblinded trials. In the absence of high certainty evidence suggesting that trials with and without blinding produce similar results, investigators should be cautious about interpreting the results of trials without blinding. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We did not involve consumers in this investigation.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMExamining data visualisation formats used within Cochrane’s qualitative evidence reviews\n\nBackground: Systematic reviews are intended to inform professional discussion and lay person healthcare decisions. Presenting review findings visually in tables and graphs is useful to clearly and concisely deliver information and identify patterns. Cochrane recommends the use of visual tools such as matrix and logic models for the integration of qualitative review findings with related Cochrane intervention reviews. However, it is unclear how often such visualisation formats are used in practice.\n\nObjectives: To examine the formats used by Cochrane to visually present results of systematic reviews of qualitative studies to help inform evidence users.\n\nMethods: Qualitative evidence reviews were searched via The Cochrane Library using the ‘qualitative review type’ tag and a ‘qualitative research’ MeSH term search. Owing to a limited search burden, two reviewers independently screened full texts of all records. Reviewers then extracted and assessed relevant characteristics including the year, topic, qualitative analysis approach, and the types and frequency of data visualisation methods used to depict review findings.\n\nResults: The search yielded 24 Cochrane reviews, spanning from 2013 to 2023. All 24 reviews were eligible for inclusion; 20 were qualitative evidence syntheses, and 4 reviews synthesised both qualitative and quantitative evidence. Summary or study-level tables were the most common method of presentation of qualitative findings (22/24 reviews); of these, six reviews used solely tables. Two additional reviews used tables to present quantitative findings only. Logic model diagrams or matrix models were used in 5/24 reviews (1-12 uses per review) and in 12/24 reviews (1-2 uses per review), respectively. Whereas most matrix models were tables, they were labelled as figures in 3/12 reviews. Five reviews utilised infographics, four of which used them to depict a conceptual framework developed from the review findings. A minority of reviews provided a rationale for not considering certain data visualisation formats.\n\nConclusions: Different visual formats are used to present qualitative review findings, with tables and matrix models being most common. However, logic models and infographics are under-utilised. In line with existing research, greater utilisation of different visualisation formats beyond summary tables to present qualitative data is recommended. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMA rapid, fit-for-purpose QES for a WHO guideline: processes and challenges\n\nBackground: The evidence-to-decision (EtD) criteria for World Health Organization (WHO) guideline development requires the explicit consideration of acceptability, feasibility and equity implications of interventions. We were commissioned by WHO to produce a qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) on these phenomena, for a broad range of interventions, within a tight timeline.\n\nObjectives: To describe the processes and challenges to produce a rapid QES for a WHO guideline.\n\nMethods: Our approach was informed by a rapid Cochrane QES and the need for a ‘fit-for-purpose’ product. To ensure completion in a rapid but rigorous manner, authors continuously discussed and reflected on their approach and met with the WHO team regularly. Eligible interventions mirrored those in the systematic review of effectiveness, commissioned for the same guideline. We limited perspectives to those of critical stakeholders; searched only MEDLINE (PubMed), supplementing this with targeted searching for ‘siblings’ of relevant trials; and included a ‘pre-screening’ step before full-text screening. Data extraction, analysis and synthesis was done iteratively using best-fit framework synthesis.\n\nResults: The broad range of interventions resulted in the inclusion of >80 studies. Inclusion of trial siblings enabled us to discern evidence that was ‘directly’ and ‘indirectly’ applicable to interventions included in the related effectiveness review. To produce fit-for-purpose evidence, we presented findings per intervention category and for each phenomenon of interest. This approach resulted in the richness of some pertinent cross-cutting perspectives not being captured and some interventions having very sparse data. The best-fit framework approach was suitable for this accelerated synthesis; though construct-level coding enabled systematic analysis, it was time-intensive. Constant communication and extensive time spent on calibration and synchronous discussions by at least three authors was key to successful QES completion. WHO was positive about the aptness of the QES evidence for the multiple EtD frameworks.\n\nConclusions: Pragmatic processes and decisions, continuous communication and a dedicated team ensured the timeous completion of the QES. This was not without challenges and methodological limitations, particularly due to the composite question. Decisions about which elements should be prioritised, and which accelerated, in rapid QES are challenging.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMChallenges of systematic reviews in the field of traditional Chinese medicine\n\nNowadays, systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRs) are widely applied in the field of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with about 14,754 SRs having been published. However, there are some challenges in the construction of clinical questions, topic selection, methodology design, and reporting of SRs in the field of TCM, including the following: 1) The western medicine diagnostic system was mostly used in the inclusion criteria instead of the TCM diagnostic system; 2) Lack of represent of Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment of TCM; 3) The interventions were set broadly, for example, when the TCM was set for the intervention, the studies of Chinese medicine treatment and non-pharmaceutical therapy were generally combined, which led to great heterogeneity and made it difficult to clarify the effect of the single therapy and translate evidence into clinical practice; 4) It may difficult to clarify the effect that comes from the acupuncture treatment or acupoint selection when combined the acupuncture trials; 5) Some did not state whether the intervention was used directly or loaded in addition to usual care when the comparison was usual care; 6) The selection of outcomes was not comprehensive, lacking of safety outcomes, economy outcomes, gold-standard outcomes, and outcomes with TCM characteristic; 7) Lack of registration; 8) There were some irregularities in the formulation of search terms, such as missing aliases and processed products of Chinese medicine or Chinese patent medicine, and missing international codes of acupoints; 9) Some only searched Chinese databases without English databases or specialized databases, inviting incomplete literature retrieval; 10) Grey literature was ignored because some studies did not search protocol registration platforms or include unpublished studies; 11) Some did not strictly follow the inclusion and exclusion criteria for literature screening; 12) Improper meta-analyses, for example, the combination of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs or the combination of high-quality trials and low-quality trials may cause biased results; 13) Lack of publication bias assessment; and 14) Lack of reports on conflicts of interest. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No involvement.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMFostering the evidence-based methodology in clinical practice guidelines development in the Czech healthcare system\n\nBackground: In the Czech Republic, access to the public healthcare system is ensured, so healthcare can be provided to anyone in the country. Heterogeneity of provided care in various settings and areas of healthcare were identified. Guidelines following the evidence-based healthcare (EBHC) principles should help optimize the care, by recommending the best healthcare option(s), and make it available to all patients. There had been no unified or standardized process of clinical practice guideline (CPG) development.\n\nObjectives: The main aim of the 5-year-long project was to implement evidence-based methodology in CPG development in the Czech healthcare system, considering, e.g., GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) principles and processes and methods of (inter)national bodies coordinating development of CPGs. The specific objectives were to establish the managing bodies of the project, draft a guideline development process, develop at least 40 CPGs and design a system of education and training in CPG development.\n\nMethods: A baseline audit was conducted in November 2017. Within the national project Clinical Practice Guidelines, led by the Czech Health Research Council, the Ministry of Health, Czech Republic, and Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, the Czech National methodology for CPG development based on the GRADE approach was drafted, pilot tested and reviewed. Identification of barriers in implementation of evidence-based and GRADE principles and suggestion of steps to overcome the barriers followed. Further audits were conducted in 2019, 2020, 2022 and 2023.\n\nResults: Nearly 1,909 CPGs were identified in 2017, developed by healthcare organizations, differing in ways of development, quality and accessibility. The main obstacles to implementing the drafted Czech national CPG methodology were a lack of both knowledge of CPG development and motivation in healthcare professionals. Workshops focused on the trustworthy CPG development were organized, and methodologists supported teams developing CPGs. The project yielded 41 CPGs informing health and care decisions.\n\nConclusions: The project has helped to establish a CPG process and enhanced knowledge and skills on EBHC in healthcare professionals. A national center focusing on methodology is being created in the Ministry of Health to sustain and increase the project’s achievements.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMThe value of Cochrane reviews for informing health decisions on optimal use of albumin\n\nBackground: Albumin is a plasma derivative widely used in routine clinical practice. However, its administration in some scenarios is not always justified by evidence of benefit in relevant clinical outcomes. This, together with the increasing consumption and the limited availability, makes it necessary to review its indications for use.\n\nObjectives: To analyse the existence of evidence from systematic reviews on the efficacy and safety of albumin in different scenarios. To describe the value of Cochrane systematic reviews for decision-making in clinical practice and the impact on the efficient use of health resources.\n\nMethods: A search for Cochrane systematic reviews was conducted in December 2019. This evidence was complemented by non-Cochrane reviews. The identified evidence was evaluated by a multidisciplinary committee, which established the criteria for the use of albumin in Navarre (Spain) based on these data. Subsequently, we assessed the impact of the measures adopted on albumin consumption and expending.\n\nResults: We identified four Cochrane reviews [two in people with cirrhosis (Simonetti RG 2019, Best LM 2019), one for resuscitation in critically ill people (Lewis SR 2018), and one in nephrotic syndrome (Ho JJ 2019)] and seven non-Cochrane reviews. Thirty-six percent of evidence synthesis products used were Cochrane reviews. Supported by this evidence, measures for its appropriate use were adopted. In critically ill patients, albumin was restricted to shock, traumatic coagulopathy, surgery and burns refractory to crystalloids. In patients with cirrhosis, adequate indication was established after paracentesis >5 liters. In spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, it was restricted to high-risk patients. In hepatorenal syndrome, it should be used in combination with vasoconstrictors. In patients with cirrhosis with severe oedema, a maximum of 10 g/day was established. Albumin concentration in plasmapheresis was reduced from 5% to 4%. Routine use of albumin is not justified in other clinical conditions. Following the establishment of usage criteria, consumption decreased by 12.4% in 2020 and 19.4% in 2021 compared with 2019, with a savings of approximately €67,000.\n\nConclusions: Cochrane reviews facilitate decision-making in clinical practice, resulting in better utilisation of available resources.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMHow to avoid retraction of systematic reviews? a cross-sectional study\n\nBackground: Systematic reviews, which are the highest level of evidence, are an important source of evidence for decision-makers to make scientific decisions. Fraudulent publication is a scourge of scientific research. Retracting is an important way to avoid circulation of low-quality research.\n\nObjectives: To assess the reasons for retraction and characteristics of systematic reviews retracted from 2012 to 2022.\n\nMethods: A review of the Retraction Watch database for retracted systematic review published between 2012 and 2022 was performed. Retractions with the term “health science” in the subject code were selected. We extracted the reasons for retraction, the journals and publishers of the retraction, and the correlation between the journals and their impact factors for statistical analysis.\n\nResults: A total of 235 retracted systematic reviews were included. Retracted papers were published in 228 different journals with IF ranging from 0.27 to 202.73. Most journals were from Q2 (38.7%). The three journals with the highest number of retractions were Tumor Biology (Tumour Biology), Medicine, and PLoS One. From the perspective of publishers, the retracted paper was also mainly concentrated in a few publishers, and more than 50% of the publishers had only one retracted paper. Seven out of 10 papers were withdrawn within three years. The publication years of retracted papers were between 2012 and 2022, with the most retracted systematic reviews in 2014 (n=46, 19.6%). Retracted articles originated from 33 countries. Compared with other countries, China had the highest percentage of retracted papers (n=162, 68.9%), followed by America (n=10, 4.3%), and the United Kingdom (n=9, 3.8%). Most of the articles had multiple reasons for retraction. The most common reported reason for retraction was fake peer review (n=66, 11.8%), followed by Investigation by Journal/Publisher (n=58, 10.4%). Errors (n=157, 28.1%) in paper is the main reason for retraction, including error in data (7.7%), methods (6.6%), image (0.5%), analyses (7.2%), etc.\n\nConclusions: Academic misconduct is the main problem of systematic review retraction. At the same time, reviewers need to strictly control the publication process to reduce drastically the acceptance of fraudulent papers. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMUse of Simulation Scenarios and Vote Cards in Teaching Critical Appraisal of Randomized Controlled Trials\n\nBackground: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. However, understanding biases arising from a trial can be challenging for medical students to grasp.\n\nObjectives: We used simulation scenarios in a Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 2.0) framework and engaged vote cards to teach the various biases that may affect RCTs and assessed whether including this interactive session in an evidence-based medicine course for third-year medical students can optimize their understanding of critical appraisal concepts.\n\nMethods: Prior to this interactive session, third-year medical students were given a two-hour didactic lecture on critical appraisal. During the interactive session, students were given a scenario for each domain of bias, and options in which they could express their appraisal using color vote cards. At the beginning of each module, the facilitator presented a scenario for each domain of bias. Students expressed answers by holding up a red, yellow, or green card, each representing a particular option. Students were asked to explain their rationale and feedback was given by the facilitator after each module. Participants were asked to complete an anonymous survey about their level of satisfaction and understanding of the RoB 2.0 tool.\n\nResults: We included 306 students across two pilot sessions. The students were least able to discern the following problems: baseline imbalances when assessing allocation bias (correct answers: 9.06%), missing outcome data when assessing attrition bias (correct answers: 11.65%), and balanced nonprotocol interventions when assessing performance bias (correct answers: 14.88%). The postcourse survey revealed several aspects of the interactive session that the students appreciated or found challenging.\n\nConclusions: These simulation scenarios based on a structured RoB framework were feasible for teaching critical appraisal. Through the use of vote cards, we further consolidated critical appraisal concepts, discovered areas that were challenging for medical students to understand, and encouraged their active participation.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Learning theoretical concepts through didactic lectures can be challenging for medical students. Simulated scenarios and vote cards increase relevancy and can be used to clarify and reinforce abstract concepts. Furthermore, it was engaging, stimulating, and fun.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMSupporting evidence-based decisions of the Brazilian Regulatory Agency for Supplementary Healthcare: a case study\n\nBackground: The Brazilian health system is composed of a public system (Sistema Único de Saúde [SUS]) and a supplementary health sector regulated by the Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar (ANS), an autonomous government agency responsible for maintaining a catalogue that informs which medicines, devices, and procedures must be provided by health plans [1,2]. The process of evaluating a technology to be incorporated into the catalogue is continuous and has been qualified by the adoption of health technology assessment (HTA) guides and evidence-based health concepts. To this end, ANS has relied on the impartial support of institutions of excellence in research and HTA.\n\nObjectives: To report the implementation and partial results of the project “Supporting the Brazilian regulatory agency for supplementary healthcare using health technology assessment actions”, an initiative from Hospital Sírio-Libanês, Brazil, conducted from 2020 to 2023, to support the ANS and is funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health initiative (PROADI-SUS).\n\nMethods: This was a case study [3] conducted at Health Technology Center, Hospital Sírio-Libanês, São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nResults: From 2020 to July 2022, the following activities and products were completed: 59 technical methodological reports assessing the efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of technologies received by the ANS to compose its catalogue of drugs products and services; 50 analyses of society contributions from public consultation; 34 methodological or clinical tutorial sessions to support ANS team; 2 templates to standardise the update process of ANS catalogue; and 1 training course on systematic reviews and meta-analysis for ANS team.\n\nConclusions: The project has contributed to increasing ANS autonomy in HTA, collaborating to efficiency in technologies offer to the users. By adopting and fostering evidence-based knowledge construction, the project reinforces its bridging role in supporting the consonance between public system and supplementary sector of healthcare in Brazil. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The actions developed in this project are structuring and contribute to the rational choice of technologies available to the almost 50 million users of the supplementary health sector, improving the efficiency of this system and ensuring robustness and reliability for decision-making.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMDeveloping a core outcome set for assessing clinical safety outcomes of cardiovascular diseases in clinical trials of integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine\n\nBackground: Integrative medicine is commonly used in China. Researchers prefer to report efficacy outcomes rather than safety outcomes in clinical trials; thus, evidence regarding safety in integrative medicine is unclear. Developing a core outcome set (COS) for safety outcomes is necessary.\n\nObjectives: In this study, a representative example of the methodology for developing COS to assess safety outcomes of cardiovascular diseases in clinical trials investigating integrated medicine was developed.\n\nMethods: Safety information will be extracted from package inserts and through systematic reviews of treatments for cardiovascular diseases (including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, bradyarrhythmia, and hypertension) to develop an extensive list of safety outcomes, which will then be categorized according to whether subjective or objective outcomes. Patients participated in semi-structured interviews. Questionnaires for clinician-reported safety outcomes and patient reported safety outcomes will be developed. Two rounds of the Delphi survey will then be conducted for different stakeholders (traditional Chinese medicine clinicians and researchers in cardiovascular diseases, Western medicine clinicians and researchers in cardiovascular diseases, integrated medicine clinicians and researchers of cardiovascular diseases, pharmacologists, methodologists of evidence-based medicine, and patients). After round 2 of the Delphi analysis, a face-to-face consensus meeting will be held to determine the final COS for assessing safety outcomes in cardiovascular diseases.\n\nResults: Anaphylaxis, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, hypotension, mortality, and bleeding are clinician-reported core adverse events for all cardiovascular disease. Cardiopalmus, chest distress, dizziness, and syncope are patient-reported core symptoms for all cardiovascular disease. We also recommend clinician-reported and patient-reported core adverse events for angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, bradyarrhythmia, and hypertension.\n\nConclusions: The core safety outcomes for cardiovascular disease may improve the consistency of adverse events reporting in future clinical trials.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Clinicians, researchers, methodologists participated in the design, management, and process of the research. Patients participated in semi-structured interviews and online survey.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMLearning by updating a Cochrane Review: teaching systematic review methods to undergraduate medical students\n\nBackground: evidence synthesis skills should be acquired during the medical degree. Since 2017 medical students at Universidad Francisco de Vitoria-Madrid (UFV), which hosts Cochrane Madrid, update Cochrane Reviews for their end-of-degree research projects.\n\nObjectives: to describe our experience in teaching Cochrane methods in the medical degree.\n\nMethods: we designed a subject for the last two years to guide medical students to update an intervention Cochrane review. The two-year subject (5th and 6th courses) includes theory sessions, seminars and requires student group and individual work. The teaching staff comprises one co-ordinator, five methodologists, and 20 clinical experts. Students are evaluated by attendance, participation, written essay, oral presentation, and peer assessments by other students.\n\nResults: The last promotion enrolled 104 medical students (82.7% women) (September 2021- June 2023). Twenty Cochrane Reviews were under update. Their topics included paediatrics (25%), psychiatry (10%), gynaecology (10%), pneumology (10%), traumatology (15%), neurology (10%), pneumology (10%), endocrinology (%) and other topics (20%). The students have learnt to formulate clinical questions, search CENTRAL and PubMed, critically appraise studies, and use Review Manager 5.4 and Rayyan. Review publication is not the goal, but we anticipate the students have identified new eligible studies for the SRs. Challenges: 1) demanding subject for students and teachers; 2) explicit teaching materials are needed, and their elaboration is time-consuming; 3) reviews may not find new eligible studies; Increasing cost of review software. Opportunities: 1) focusing on intervention SRs with RCTs facilitates the process; 2) group work lightens students' burden while acquiring teamwork skills; 3) students acquire research skills and competencies for evidence-based medicine; 4) standardised teaching materials facilitate the work of teachers and students.\n\nConclusions: learning to update a Cochrane Review during the medical curriculum helps to acquire research skills oriented to evidence-based medicine. While challenging, this course model is successful and implementable in other universities. Patient or healthcare consumer involvement: Cochrane methods in the undergraduate curriculum helps medical students to formulate patient-oriented clinical questions. This is an essential skill for an evidence-based practice that will benefit patients.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMSpin bias in clinical trials of cannabis derivatives and their synthetic analogues: a meta-epidemiologic study\n\nBackground: Numerous trials have been conducted to investigate the effects of cannabis derivatives and their synthetic analogues for different conditions, including pain, nausea and vomiting, eating and anxiety disorders, depression, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, among others. Against the setting of a promising novel intervention, investigators may tend to emphasise benefits when interpreting the findings of trials on cannabinoids, which supports the rationale for assessing the frequency of spin bias in these studies. Spin bias occurs, for example, when the results of a study are misreported with overestimation of positive findings and underestimation of negative ones [1].\n\nObjectives: To estimate the frequency and conduct a qualitative analysis of spin bias in publications of clinical trials about the therapeutic use of cannabis derivatives and their synthetic analogues for any medical condition.\n\nMethods: Meta-epidemiologic study [2] conducted in the Discipline of Evidence-Based Medicine, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Unifesp), Brazil, and supported by academic scholarship from Fundação de Apoio à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP, number 2019/20691-4).\n\nResults: Sixty-five publications with at least one efficacy primary outcome were included. The results analysis for the primary outcome indicated statistically significant effects in 44.6% (29/65) of the publications, and 70.7% (45/65) of the conclusions were considered favorable to the intervention. Among the 36 publications that found statistically nonsignificant results for the primary outcome, 44.4% (16/36) presented conclusions favorable to or recommended the intervention, which represents spin bias. Qualitative analysis of the 16 studies with spin bias showed selective outcomes reporting (elevating secondary outcomes that had positive results or reporting only subgroup results), deviations from the planned statistical analysis and failure to consider or report uncertainty in the estimates of treatment effects.\n\nConclusions: Spin bias were found in 44.4% of the publications of trials assessing the therapeutic use of cannabis derivatives and their synthetic analogues and presenting statistically nonsignificant results. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: When not observed by readers, spin bias can lead to misconduct in clinical practice through the use of interventions that are not efficacious or whose efficacy is uncertain.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMA tool to assess risk of bias in studies estimating the prevalence of mental health disorders (RoB-PrevMH)\n\nBackground: Studies of prevalence provide essential information for estimating the burden of mental health conditions, which can inform research and policymaking. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has generated a large volume of literature on the prevalence of various conditions, including those related to mental health. Biases affect how certain we are about the available evidence. It is one of the essential steps when conducting a systematic review; however, no standard tool for assessing the risk of bias (RoB) in prevalence studies exists.\n\nObjectives: For the purposes of a living systematic review on prevalence of mental health disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a RoB tool to evaluate prevalence studies in mental health (RoB-PrevMH) and tested its interrater reliability.\n\nMethods: We reviewed existing RoB tools for prevalence studies until September 2020 to develop a tool for prevalence studies in mental health. We tested the reliability of assessments by different users of RoB-PrevMH in 83 studies stemming from two systematic reviews of prevalence studies in mental health. We assessed the interrater agreement by calculating the proportion of agreement and Kappa statistic for each item.\n\nResults: RoB-PrevMH consists of three items that address selection bias and information bias. Introductory and signaling questions guide the application of the tool to the review question. The interrater agreement for the three items was 83%, 90%, and 93%. The weighted kappa was 0.63 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.73), 0.71 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.85) and 0.32 (95% CI –0.04 to –0.63), respectively.\n\nConclusions: RoB-PrevMH can determine if selection or information biases are present when the prevalence of mental health disorders is measured. Our tool aims to approach bias accurately by excluding reporting questions. The tool’s validity, reliability, and applicability should be assessed in future projects.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMA co-produced e-toolkit to support patient and public involvement in developing and promoting core outcome sets\n\nBackground: This work links to the international Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative. Core Outcome Sets (COS) can reduce research waste by promoting consistency in outcome reporting. Over 400 COS have been published; another 300 COS are in development. COS should be relevant to all research stakeholders, including patients, carers and the public. Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) in COS research helps to ensure that COS studies are accessible and acceptable to all stakeholders, yet PPI in COS studies is not undertaken consistently, is often of limited scope, and its impact is rarely documented. This may partly reflect a lack of tools and training for COS teams. We aim to address this gap in resources using a COS specific PPI toolkit that will help COS developers to consider the range of ways that PPI could be integrated in their study and provide practical support on how to achieve this.\n\nObjectives: To produce a practical resource supporting PPI throughout COS development and dissemination\n\nMethods: The toolkit has been co-created with patient research partners. It is designed to follow the timeline of a COS study. At each stage, COS developers are provided with questions to consider with their public research partners. Specifically, designed PPI resources, including co-produced animations and guidance, are provided at key COS development stages. We also provide links to relevant resources produced by other international organisations. The toolkit includes a template for documenting PPI activity and impacts throughout the study.\n\nResults: The PPI toolkit will soon be available on the COMET website. It will be promoted in the COMET Initiative newsletter and through social media.\n\nConclusions: The co-produced COMET PPI toolkit is an evolving resource for COS developers. Further resources for the toolkit will also be co-designed with patients. Feedback from toolkit users will be used to refine the content.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The toolkit was co-designed by a team including two patient research partners with COS experience. Many resources in the toolkit were also co-designed with patient research partners, including an animation about PPI in COS development, which will be showcased along with the toolkit.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMDissemination efforts to optimize service delivery to children, adolescents, and their families – How systematic reviews (SRs) can be utilized\n\nBackground Access to research is a prerequisite for decision-making in policy and practice. Those who strive to enhance the mental health of children and adolescents often encounter difficulties while attempting to locate and utilize reliable evidence. Objectives Our aim is to support practitioners and decision-makers in child and adolescent mental health and welfare (CAMHW) in optimizing the delivery of services. Further, to contribute to the implementation of evidence-based practice, by providing access to trustworthy information based on systematically reviewed research. Outcomes Four closely cooperating research centres in Norway have developed an ecosystem of digital resources, to disseminate research findings derived from SRs in CAMHW: PsykTestBarn (psyktestbarn.no) publishes SRs on the psychometric properties of tests and diagnostic tools used to assess mental health and other traits in children and young people, in a Norwegian context. Ungsinn (ungsinn.no) publishes SRs on specific psycho-social interventions/programs and their evidence of effectiveness. It grades the quality of evidence on a scale of 0 to 5, based on the number and quality of studies, beneficial effects and implementation quality. IN SUM (insum.no) is a database containing all international SRs on the effects of CAMHW interventions. IN SUM includes the SRs published by Ungsinn and serves as the basis for The Intervention Handbook. The Intervention Handbook (tiltakshandboka.no) presents living (i.e., updated yearly) reviews of SRs on diagnostic areas and interventions. SRs are evaluated using Cochrane methodology for Overviews of Reviews. Ungsinn, PsykTestBarn, and The Intervention Handbook are peer-reviewed and registered open-access scientific journals. Conclusion Each resource – as well as the collaboration between them - has been funded by the Norwegian government. Growing interest and use from the practice field and government indicates that accessible evidence-based information is important. Our next challenge is to further increase the use of our resources, and ensure that local decision-making is based on these resources.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Resource users are active in initiating reviews, and are included in the review processes as reviewers together with researchers. This work may be of relevance to patients in making trustworthy evidence available, on a common platform, in an accessible format.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMA comprehensive approach to assess the existing evidence and appropriateness of anticancer drugs on advanced cancer: the ASTAC project\n\nBackground: Appropriateness of Systemic Treatments for Advanced Cancers (ASTAC) is a collaborative research project aiming to assess the appropriateness of anticancer drugs in advanced digestive non-intestinal cancers (ADNIC), contributing to reduce potential scenarios of misuse. Objective: To describe the ASTAC approach for broad evidence synthesis.\n\nMethods: We synthesised evidence on efficacy and safety through overviews, evidence gap maps (EGMs) and systematic reviews (SRs), according to the following steps: 1) We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, Epistemonikos and PROSPERO for SRs, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies regarding our research questions. 2) We classified the identified SRs according to cancer location, and conducted three overviews. These overviews included all relevant SRs. We created matrices of evidence and de novo meta-analyses. 3) For conducting the EGMs, we used all the previously identified SRs (plus the RCT and observational studies already identified), and we ran a new and broader search strategy. We re-started the screening process, complementing the search with clinicaltrials.gov. 4) Once we had all the SRs, RCTs and observational studies identified, we conducted three EGMs. The EGMs informed which new SRs were more appropriate to conduct. 5) We used the RCTs included in the EGMs for the new SRs. At this stage, we also conducted a forward citation search to retrieve newer studies. 6) We conducted data extraction and analysis for the SRs, comparing our assessments with those made by authors of other SRs (identified by previous overviews). In parallel, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study to describe ADNIC patients’ treatments, for judging the appropriateness of these interventions.\n\nResults: The project is in its final stage. At the moment of this submission, we have published three overviews and one EGM, and submitted other two EGMs. We are in the final phase of five SRs. In parallel, we are finishing data analysis for the cohort study.\n\nConclusions: ASTAC has managed to combine optimally different methodological approaches for synthesising evidence, contrasting them with current clinical practice. Evidence to treat ADNICs with anticancer drugs is sparse and, in consequence, treatments could be often considered inappropriate.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None\n\nASTAC.png\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMSimplifying Cochrane Systematic Reviews with AI for Improved Shared Decision Making\n\nBackground: Cochrane systematic reviews provide high-quality, evidence-based information for healthcare decision-making. However, the language used in these reviews can be complex, making it difficult for patients and nonexperts to understand. This can hinder shared decision-making, where patients are equipped with the necessary information to make informed decisions about their health and treatment options. To facilitate shared decision-making and better communication with patients, it is important to simplify the information contained in Cochrane systematic reviews.\n\nObjectives: This study aimed to evaluate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in simplifying the lay language summaries of Cochrane systematic reviews to an 8th-grade level. The study compared the readability and accuracy of the simplified summaries generated by AI with those created by human experts and with the original Cochrane systematic reviews.\n\nMethods: A sample of Cochrane systematic reviews was used in the study. Lay language summaries were created both by human experts and through an AI-powered simplification process to an 8th-grade level. The readability and accuracy of the summaries were assessed using established metrics.\n\nResults: The results showed that the 8th-grade-level lay language summaries generated by AI were more accessible and understandable for patients and the general public without sacrificing the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the information. The simplified summaries had higher readability scores and were more accurately understood by patients and nonexperts compared with the original Cochrane systematic reviews.\n\nConclusions: The study highlights the importance of simplifying evidence-based information for shared decision-making and better communication between healthcare providers and patients. Using AI to generate 8th-grade-level lay language summaries of Cochrane systematic reviews is an effective way to achieve this goal. By making the information more accessible, patients can make informed decisions about their health and treatment options, leading to improved health outcomes. The study demonstrates the potential for AI to support shared decision-making by simplifying complex scientific information into understandable language for patients and the general public.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMAn overview of Cochrane reviews of predictive, prognostic or prognostic modelling studies\n\nBackground: Prognostic or prognostic modelling studies are developed to give accurate and discriminating predictions about the likelihood of a future outcome in individuals with a given disease or health condition and are increasingly being used in evidence-based medicine of the XXI century. Predictors or prognostic factors typically include laboratory variables, biomarkers, patient/disease/clinical characteristics, comorbidities, treatment-related factors, or concomitant medications.\n\nObjectives: This overview aims to a.) synthesise evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews (CSRs) of predictive, prognostic, or prognostic modelling studies and b.) map conditions/outcomes evaluated in CSRs against non-CSRs.\n\nMethods: Cochrane Central (2023, Issue 2) and Medline (from inception until 03.02.2023) were searched (without language restrictions) for all relevant studies. CSRs and non-CSRs of predictive, prognostic, or prognostic modelling studies in any healthcare area were eligible. Other types of reviews i.e., effectiveness, diagnostic, or safety, were excluded.\n\nResults: Fourteen CSRs of predictive, prognostic, or prognostic modelling studies were included. The conditions involved unprovoked seizure (n=1), cognitive impairment or dementia (n=2), autism spectrum disorder (n=1), major depressive disorder (n=1), noncardiac surgery (n=1), cancer (n=6), non-specific low back pain (n=1), and venous leg ulcers (n=1). Those conditions were mapped against non-CSRs and included seizures (n=19), cognitive impairment or dementia (n=24), autism spectrum disorder (n=7), major depressive disorder (n=80), noncardiac surgery (n=8), cancer (n=1,190), non-specific low back pain (n=33), and venous leg ulcers (n=1). The ratio of non-CSRs versus CSRs of prognostic modelling studies in oncology is 99.5% versus 0.5% and 98.75% versus 1.25% in psychiatry.\n\nConclusions: There is a paucity of CSRs of predictive, prognostic, or prognostic modelling studies and a plethora of conditions or outcomes evaluated in non-CSRs. The biggest and most worrying gap exists in oncology. Given that non-Cochrane reviews report larger and often less precise effect sizes compared with CSRs, this could lead to over or under-interpretations of predictive or prognostic factors under investigation further contributing to unnecessary suffering, poor life quality, and excessive fear or unrealistic optimism in certain populations, such as oncology. There should be more CSRs evaluating predictive and prognostic factors.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMIntroducing The Cochrane Nutrition & Public Health Thematic Group\n\nIntroduction: Improving nutrition and physical activity is a global health priority. Within Cochrane’s new production model, a Thematic Group (TG) with specialist content and methods expertise to support the development and dissemination of high-quality evidence on these priority issues in accessible formats was needed. We established a Nutrition and Physical Activity TG, which will serve as a Cochrane hub for expertise in this area. Approach: In establishing the TG, we brought together Cochrane members and groups with considerable experience in systematic reviews, methods and knowledge translation, as well as expertise in public health, nutrition, physical activity and obesity. Our strategic plan ensures TG decisions, and actions are deliberate and consistent with our shared values and guiding principles and contribute to achieving our TG goals and objectives. A governance structure aims to ensure the integration of teams across the partners and to manage resource allocation procedures and processes to maximise the impact of the TG’s programs of work. Our goals: The TG goals are to support and enable evidence-informed decision-making for policy and practice by advancing the preparation and impact of high-quality, relevant evidence syntheses; be a collaborative and sustainable component of Cochrane’s ecosystem for producing high-quality, trusted evidence; and to add value to Cochrane’s vision of better health for all people. It will achieve this via four objectives: 1) Increase the relevance, timeliness and quality of evidence synthesis aligned with our scope; 2) Ensure the sustainability of the TG; 3) Increase the impact and visibility of evidence synthesis aligned with our scope across all target audiences; and 4) Ensure accountability of the TG to the Cochrane Charity and between the partnering groups.\n\nConclusions: The Nutrition and Physical Activity TG is an aggregation of multi-disciplinary Cochrane entities, as well as partnering organisations and people from around the world, representing both a broadening of global collaboration and potential impact.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We will create opportunities for patients, public and/or healthcare consumers to be involved in priority setting, commenting on reviews in-development and other activities of interest, to ensure our evidence products are accessible and relevant to them.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMComparison of several systematic review process software tools among health care professionals: A questionnaire based survey.\n\nBackground: Systematic reviews are an important tool for synthesizing and summarizing evidence in healthcare research. There are numerous software tools available for conducting systematic reviews, but it is unclear which tools are most commonly used or most effective among healthcare professionals.\n\nObjectives: This study aimed to compare several systematic review process software tools used by healthcare professionals through a questionnaire-based survey. The objectives were to identify which tools were most commonly used, which were considered most effective, and what factors influenced tool selection.\n\nMethods: A questionnaire was developed and distributed to healthcare professionals who had experience conducting systematic reviews. The questionnaire included questions on demographics, experience with systematic reviews, and experiences using various software tools. Participants were asked to rate the ease of use, effectiveness, and overall satisfaction with each tool they had used.\n\nResults: A total of 150 healthcare professionals completed the questionnaire. The most commonly used software tools were DistillerSR, Covidence, and Rayyan. Participants rated DistillerSR as the most effective tool, followed by Covidence and Rayyan. Factors influencing tool selection included cost, ease of use, and availability of training and support.\n\nConclusions: This study suggests that healthcare professionals prefer software tools that are effective, easy to use, and affordable. Although DistillerSR was rated the most effective tool, Covidence and Rayyan were also highly rated and commonly used. Healthcare professionals should consider these factors when selecting a software tool for conducting systematic reviews.\n\nPatient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients, the public, or healthcare consumers were not directly involved in the development or implementation of this study. However, the study’s results may ultimately benefit patients and healthcare consumers by helping healthcare professionals identify and use more effective tools for conducting systematic reviews, which could lead to better-informed healthcare decisions.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMContextualizing evidence-based nurse-led peri-discharge interventions for reducing 30-day hospital readmissions using GRADE Evidence to Decision Framework: A Delphi study\n\nBackground: Effectiveness of nurse-led peri-discharge interventions on 30-day hospital readmissions has been synthesized in previous network meta-analysis. However, generalizability of such results is expected to vary in health system contexts given their complexity.\n\nObjectives: To translate evidence-based nurse-led interventions into local-adaptable intervention options for reducing 30-day hospital readmissions with the engagement of local stakeholders, using Hong Kong as an example.\n\nMethods: Eighteen local healthcare stakeholders were recruited to carry out a two-step process. In step 1, stakeholders were invited to prioritize nurse-led interventions which are supported by existing evidence and suggest important combinations of different interventions. For all interventions prioritized in step 1, step 2 involved stakeholders to perform a two-round Delphi questionnaire aiming to generate consensus-based interventions appropriate to the local context. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework was applied to guide the decision-making process, taking into account certainty of evidence, benefits and harms, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility.\n\nResults: Four out of eight nurse-led interventions reached a positive consensus with percentage agreement ranging from 70.6% to 82.4%. GRADE EtD criteria ratings showed that over 70% of stakeholders agreed these four interventions were probably acceptable and feasible, although the certainty of evidence was low or moderate. Half of stakeholders believed their desirable effects compared to undesirable effects were large. However, the resources required and how these nurse-led interventions might affect health inequities when implemented were uncertain. Preliminary implementation issues included high complexity of delivering multiple nurse-led intervention components and challenges of coordinating different involved parties in delivering the interventions. Appropriate resource allocation and training should be provided to address these potential problems, as suggested by stakeholders.\n\nConclusions: Using the GRADE EtD framework, four nurse-led interventions were recommended by healthcare stakeholders as possible strategies for reducing 30-day hospital readmissions among general medical patients in Hong Kong. To address preliminary implementation issues, nurses’ role as care coordinators should also be strengthened to ensure smooth delivery of nurse-led intervention components and to facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration during service delivery. Patient, public, healthcare consumer involvement: NA.\n\n12:30 PM - 2:00 PMA comparison of two search filters for economic evaluations. The CADTH Narrow vs the NHS EED search filter\n\nObjectives: The aim of this project was to evaluate if the CADTH narrow economic search filter (CADTH narrow) could produce a similar sensitivity to the NHS EED search filter (NHS EED) while achieving a lower number needed to read (NNR) when searching for economic evaluations in the Ovid MEDLINE database.\n\nMethods: We identified references of economic evaluations from a sample of 13 systematic reviews conducted by the Swedish Ag"
