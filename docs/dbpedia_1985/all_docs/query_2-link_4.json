It provided analysis of state and municipal politics as well as insight into state and regional issues in a current affairs journalistic style. The program was known for its interviews with politicians, and for its coverage of important regional issues.\n\nThe program premiered on 16 February 1996 at 6 pm.[2] It moved to 7:30 pm in February 2001, which resulted in The 7.30 Report being removed from Fridays.[3][4]\n\nThe ABC announced in December 2010 that the state-based current affairs program Stateline would be folded into a new 7.30 brand from March 2011.[5] The change saw 7.30 extended to five nights a week, although Friday editions were to be presented locally and focus on state affairs.[5] The Friday state-based editions of 7.30 were eventually axed in December 2014.[6]\n\nFormat\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is broadcast on ABC TV, ABC News and ABC iview on Sundays during the state-based news bulletins, with eight separate state and territory specific editions.[citation needed] It was also broadcast on the new digital channel ABC2 after its launch in March 2005.[7]\n\nWith the launch of ABC News 24 in 2010, each local version of Stateline was also broadcast nationally on the channel over the weekend.[citation needed]\n\nAs of 2024 the Stateline brand name is in use by the ABC again.[8] Local presenters of state news bulletins anchor episodes of Stateline.\n\nFormer presenters of Stateline until 2011 include:\n\nState/Territory Presenter New South Wales Quentin Dempster Victoria Josie Taylor Queensland Jessica van Vonderen Western Australia Eliza Blue South Australia Ian Henschke Tasmania Airlie Ward Australian Capital Territory Chris Kimball Northern Territory Laetitia Lemke\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
