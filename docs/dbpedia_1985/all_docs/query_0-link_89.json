        "text": "Jim Jeffrey from SAPOL has been accused of corruption.\n\nNews Corp Australia is in midst of the phone hacking scandal that has shut down one of their leading papers. Following momentarily after a huge public outcry in Britain due to the hacking of Milly Dowler, a murdered 13yo schoolgirl's phone, similar allegations of hacking into deceased British soldiers, victims of 7/7 London bombings, led eventually to the closure of News of the World, Britain's best-selling newspaper after 168 years of publication, by James Murdoch. The British PM announced a public government inquiry into phone hacking and police bribery, as well as investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on claims News Corp has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, accessing voicemails of victims of the 9/11 attacks. Since then, Rupert Murdoch has issued a personally signed statement where he admitted \"serious wrongdoing\", and signed it with \"putting right what's gone wrong\".\n\nIn what has become the \"Hacked Off\" campaign calling for greater press regulation (receiving nearly 100k petition signatures already), and has affected such stars as Jemima Khan, Max Mosley, Sienna Miller, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, the Jonas Brothers, and various other celebrities, politicians and members of the British Royal Family - the scandal has moved its attention to Australia now, where Murdoch media's Eastern Courier is accused of hacking into the accounts of political candidate Jeremy Shum and leaking private details, just days before an election.\n\nWhat's made it even more flagrant is an arrogant admission by the editor of the Eastern Courier, Matt Deighton, in his editorial section. For that, he has been labeled psychopathic.\n\nHugh Grant has described News Corp as \"cheap and pathetic\", and that he was \"revolted and astonished\". Paul McMullan agreed it was \"morally bankrupt\". Jemima Khan (Hugh Grant's former girlfriend) has made an even more serious claim, stating \"press, police and Parliament have all colluded on the issues of phone hacking\". Unsurprisingly, there's also allegations of Police corruption, but at SA's very own SAPOL. In fact, Hugh Grant has taken to himself to sue London's Metropolitan Police, which will be a means to obtain evidence on the hacking scandal. We can only startle at whether Mr. Jim Jeffery at SAPOL will be next?\n\nJude Law has also filed a lawsuit against News Corp, directly targetting The Sun (also owned by News Corp). The action was launched on June 17 in London, England.\n\n\"We believe this is a deeply cynical and deliberately mischievous attempt to draw the Sun into the phone-hacking issue,\" a Newscorp spokeswoman said.\n\nMark Thomson, a lawyer for Law, said News International's \"record speaks for itself\". \"By their own admission, News International have misled the police, Parliament and the public for nearly five years.\"\n\nHugh Grant said, \"You should try real journalism because you're not an idiot - You could probably do it!\"\n\nAm Freitag, 15.
