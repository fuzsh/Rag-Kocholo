        "text": "Conceptual Astronomy Knowledge among Amateur Astronomers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBerendsen, Margaret L.\n\nAmateur astronomers regularly serve as informal astronomy educators for their communities. This research inquires into the level of knowledge of basic astronomy concepts among amateur astronomers and examines factors related to amateur astronomy that affect that knowledge. Using the concept questions from the Astronomy Diagnostic Test Version 2, an online survey was developed as an assessment. In particular, astronomy club members with at least some college-level astronomy education score substantially higher on the assessment (mean score: 85) than do college undergraduates after taking their first astronomy course (mean score: 47). Astronomy club members scored up to 17% higher than unaffiliated amateurs, an indication that regular contact with like-minded hobbyists improves basic knowledge. Proportionally more astronomy club members report doing outreach than do unaffiliated amateurs (87% vs. 46%). It appears that those who are likely to be more knowledgeable are also those doing more outreach.\n\nFactors Contributing to Amateur Astronomers' Involvement in Education and Public Outreach\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nYocco, Victor; Jones, Eric C.; Storksdieck, Martin\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAmateur astronomers play a critical role engaging the general public in astronomy. The role of individual and club-related factors is explored using data from two surveys (Survey 1 N = 1142; Survey 2 N = 1242) of amateur astronomers. Analysis suggests that formal or informal training in astronomy, age, club membership, length of club membership,â¦\n\nAmateur Astronomers As Public Outreach Partners\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBennett, M. A.\n\n2006-08-01\n\nAmateur astronomers involved in public outreach represent a huge, largely untapped source of energy and enthusiasm to help astronomers reach the general public. Even though many astronomy educators already work with amateur astronomers, the potential educational impact of amateur astronomers as public outreach ambassadors remains largely unrealized. Surveys and other work by the ASP in the US show that more than 20% of astronomy club members routinely participate in public engagement and educational events, such as public star parties, classroom visits, work with youth and community groups, etc. Amateur astronomers who participate in public outreach events are knowledgeable about astronomy and passionate about sharing their hobby with other people. They are very willing to work with astronomers and astronomy educators. They want useful materials, support, and training. In the USA, the ASP operates \"The Night Sky Network,\" (funded by NASA). We have developed specialized materials and training, tested by and used by amateur astronomers. This project works with nearly 200 local astronomy clubs in 50 states to help them conduct more effective public outreach events. It has resulted in nearly 3,600 outreach events (reaching nearly 300,000 people) in just two years. In this presentation we examine key success factors, lessons learned, and suggest how astronomers outside the US can recruit and work with \"outreach amateur astronomers\" in their own countries.\n\nIs Amateur Astronomersâ Astronomy Knowledge a Barrier to Successful Outreach?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSlater, Timothy F.; Slater, S. J.; Price, C. A.; CenterAstronomy, CAPER; Education Research, Physics\n\n2012-01-01\n\nConsiderable effort in astronomy education research has focused on developing assessment tools in the form of multiple-choice conceptual diagnostics and content knowledge surveys. This has been critically important for establishing the initial knowledge state of students and measure impacts of innovative instructional interventions over a universe of topics. Unfortunately, few of the existing instruments were constructed upon a solid list of clearly articulated and widely agreed upon learning objectives that span an entire introductory survey course. Moving beyond the 10-year old Astronomy Diagnostics Test, scholars at the CAPER Center for Astronomy & Physics Education Research developed and validated criterion referenced assessment tool, which is tightly aligned to the consensus learning goals stated by the AAS Chair's Conference on ASTRO 101, the AAAS Project 2061 Benchmarks, and the NRC National Science Education Standards, called the Test Of Astronomy STandards (TOAST). This multiple-choice instrument has a high degree of reliability and validity and is being deployed in a number of formal and informal learning environments. A collaborative research endeavor between the CAPER Team and the American Association of Variable Star Observers measured the astronomy content knowledge amateur astronomers, relative to widely agreed upon learning targets. We uncovered that our sample of 300 amateurs have higher than expected scores on the TOAST, significantly higher than students leaving our top-tier ASTRO 101 survey courses. Given recent learning sciences research demonstrating the potential of highly specialized languages that exist within some communities and rapidly declining membership rolls of formal amateur organizations, these scores could be interpreted as a potential communication barrier existing for engaging novices who are potential future club members. These results suggest that organizations may need to strategically clarify the nature of educational\n\nThe Effect of New York's Elite Athletic Clubs on American Amateur Athletic Governance 1870-1915.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWettan, Richard; Willis, Joe\n\nDuring the early history of amateur athletics, the large and affluent athletic clubs--mostly in New York City--took the initiative in the formation of the first associations of amateur clubs, the National Association of Amateur Athletes of America (NAAAA), and its successor, the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). Athletic clubs in New York City in theâ¦\n\nAlbion's Astronomy Club--A Community of Many Faces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGanem, Alysandra; Matti, C.; Ciastko, L.; Zellner, N.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Albion College Astronomy Club has a bright and rich history, and an even more luminous future. The club has always been and continues to be rooted in educating club members, fellow undergraduates and the community about astronomy. Public observing events are held several times each year, with the support of physics faculty and astronomy club members. In the spring of 2013, the club built and launched its first model rocket. The building of rockets has expanded club membership, which will ensure the continuity of our astronomy club. Additionally, in the 2013-2014 academic year, we plan to work with the local science museum to educate after-school groups about constellations and how much fun can be had observing, sans telescope. All of these activities culminate into a club that is integrative and educationally enriching.\n\nGetting organized: A history of amateur astronomy in the United States\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilliams, Thomas R.\n\n2000-10-01\n\nDuring the twentieth century, American amateur astronomers attempted to form national organizations with structures and intents similar to the British Astronomical Association (BAA), an amateur organization dedicated to the advancement of astronomy and widely admired by American amateurs and professionals alike. The Society for Practical Astronomy (1910), the American Amateur Astronomers Association (1935), and the National Astronomical Association (1945) were each intended to facilitate amateur scientific contributions in BAA-like topical sections, but each of these societies failed. Founded in 1911, the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) and the American Meteor Society (AMS) provided an alternative for amateur astronomers who were interested in those specific topics. However, it was not until 1947, when the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers (ALPO) formed, that another large segment of amateur astronomers found a home for their interests. A second mode of national organization succeeded at mid- century and grew to include most avocational astronomers. Founded in 1947, the Astronomical League consists of regional associations of local societies, and is oriented largely towards recreational astronomy. The League sponsors annual national and regional conventions, but contributes little to scientific programs. This study concludes that avocational astronomy cannot simply be compared with professional astronomy, and instead must be viewed on its own terms as a complex and variegated field. Although the failure of American amateurs to form a BAA-like organization was at first disappointing, the specialized associations of observers, together with a separate and larger organization devoted to recreational astronomy, have served the American astronomical community well. Professional support for both types of activity was facilitated in this mode of organization. The style in which professional support is rendered appears to be important\n\nRunning an Elementary School Astronomy Club: Engaging Children in the Wonders of Space\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMayo, L.; Odenwald, S.; Lundberg, C.; Dimarco, A.\n\n2000-10-01\n\n``At the elementary school level, children are motivated by two things, dinosaurs and space\" (Dr. Harold Williams, Montgomery College Planetarium Director). Yet, many elementary school science objectives include only the most basic astronomical concepts. Some ignore the subject all together in favor of more traditional courses (e.g. math and reading) or Earth science based curricula such as weather and local ecosystems. In addition, most elementary school teachers are unfamiliar with astronomical concepts and are poorly equipped to teach the subject. With teacher requirements increasing due to increasing class sizes, state competency exams, and a back to basics political climate, there is often little room to capitalize on the natural sense of curiosity children have about the universe during the normal school day. An after school astronomy club can provide a solution. In this paper, we present a model for setting up and running an after school astronomy club for students in grades 3-6. Our model was developed at two Maryland schools, Sligo Creek Elementary and Holy Redeemer Elementary/Middle School and incorporates national education standards as well as NASA OSS guidelines for effective education outreach programs. We propose here, a Community Based Learning (CBL) approach with the goal of engaging multiple elements of the community in the learning process including local amateur astronomy clubs, industry, community colleges, parents, and teachers. Methods for using astronomy as a basis for teaching reading, writing, math, and presentation skills are introduced. Resources, teaching methods, preparation guidelines, discipline, and safety are discussed and a list of grade appropriate, hands-on astronomy activities is presented along with procedures and expected outcomes.\n\nEncouraging a Culture of Outreach in Astronomy Clubs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nManning, J.; Berendsen, M.; Schultz, G.; Gurton, S.; Santascoy, J.; White, V.; Frank, K.; Jones, E.; Yocco, V.; John, M. S.; Castori, P.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nAstronomy clubs constitute a âmarching armyâ of knowledgeable, experienced astronomy enthusiasts deployed in a national network: an important resource for engaging the public through educational outreach events and activities. The Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) in partnership with the Institute for Learning Innovation (ILI) and Inverness Research, Inc., has been engaged in a multi-year NSF-supported project focusing on this network and its potential to advance astronomy education and outreach. The project has explored the culture of astronomy clubs, identified impediments to building cultures of outreach within clubs, and developed and introduced new mechanisms to overcome these impediments and enhance clubs' abilities to encourage and sustain cultures that value and promote outreach efforts. This paper shares initial research, development and evaluation findings of the project, and describes ongoing supplemental efforts that continue to advance project objectives.\n\nPushing Glass: Engaging Young People in Astronomy Through Amateur Mirror Making Classes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLarsen, Kristine; Slater, K.; Drew, B.\n\n2008-05-01\n\nMore than any other science, astronomy has benefited from the work of well-trained, enthusiastic and dedicated amateurs. In an online survey of more than 1100 amateur astronomers conducted by Storksdieck et al., 63% of respondents reported being engaged in educational outreach. Such activities aid in the recruitment of young members to amateur associations in an attempt to stem the well-known \"grayingâ of the field. One of the activities utilized by amateur astronomy groups to excite both young people and the general public about astronomy is mirror and telescope making. In 1925, Arctic explorer, architect, and optical and mechanical designer Russell Porter asked an interviewer, \"Why not make your own telescope? Astronomy would mean a lot more to you if you did.â Today, the Springfield Telescope Makers of Vermont carry on their founder's tradition of promoting amateur telescope making and the enjoyment of the night sky through regular mirror making classes. Among the target groups included in these classes are young people, some still in elementary school. In doing so, the STMs capitalize on research which demonstrates that interest in astronomy not only peaks around the transition between elementary and middle school, but also that the widely-reported gender gap in achievement and interest in science begins at this crucial juncture. This poster reports on the results of a study of mirror making classes conducted by the STMs and nine other amateur astronomy groups in the Northeast U.S., including class organizersâ reflections on their successes and challenges in recruiting and retaining young men and women through the completion of a workable telescope mirror.\n\nBoosting productivity: a framework for professional/amateur collaborative teamwork\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAl-Shedhani, Saleh S.\n\n2002-11-01\n\nAs technology advances, remote operation of telescopes has paved the way for joint observational projects between Astronomy clubs. Equipped with a small telescope, a standard CCD, and a networked computer, the observatory can be set up to carry out several photometric studies. However, most club members lack the basic training and background required for such tasks. A collaborative network between professionals and amateurs is proposed to utilize professional know-how and amateurs' readiness for continuous observations. Working as a team, various long-term observational projects can be carried out using small telescopes. Professionals can play an important role in raising the standards of astronomy clubs via specialized training programs for members on how to use the available technology to search/observe certain events (e.g. supernovae, comets, etc.). Professionals in return can accumulate a research-relevant database and can set up an early notification scheme based on comparative analyses of the recently-added images in an online archive. Here we present a framework for the above collaborative teamwork that uses web-based communication tools to establish remote/robotic operation of the telescope, and an online archive and discussion forum, to maximize the interactions between professionals and amateurs and to boost the productivity of small telescope observatories.\n\nOutreach and Astronomy-Education Activities of the University of Arizona Astronomy Club\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcGraw, Allison M.; Hardegree-Ullman, K.; Walker-LaFollette, A.; Towner, A. P.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe University of Arizona Astronomy Club provides unique outreach experiences for all ages. Our undergraduates work together to volunteer their time for various types of outreach events. This club uses several techniques to execute astronomy education such as hands-on 3D models, exciting demonstrations of scientific phenomena, and multiple small telescopes for both solar and night-time viewing. The students bring the models and telescopes to locations both on and off campus; from dark sky locations in the desert southwest to elementary schools, our undergraduates are willing to teach astronomy just about anywhere.\n\nWhat Happened to the Amateurs After Professionalization? The Amateurization of Astronomy in Britain and the United States\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilliams, T. R.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nFor nearly two centuries, astronomers have felt the need for a journal in which to publish their results, a venue for meetings in which to discuss those results, and a means for standardizing techniques and coordinating programs within the discipline. These factors are typically the basis on which professional associations have been formed, but in many countries some form of an amateur organization now exists to serve these same purposes. In two case studies, this paper will explore the different paths along which amateur organizations have developed in response to radically different dynamics in the professionalization of astronomy. In Britain, several failures preceded the successful formation of the British Astronomical Association (BAA). Within no more than a decade after its founding, the BAA's specialized observing sections and credible journal were admired by professional and amateur astronomers alike, and served as a model for at least three failed attempts to form a similar organization in the United States. What emerged in the United States instead were six separate specialized observing associations, some of which now legitimately claim international status. This talk will consider how the radically different circumstances under which the professionalization of astronomy occurred in Britain and the United States influenced the amateurization of astronomy in both countries.\n\nInteractions and Interventions: Current Research on Improving Informal Astronomy Education via the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nManning, James G.; Gurton, S.; Hurst, A.; Berendsen, M.; Storksdieck, M.; Haley-Goldman, K.; Stein, J.; Pompea, S.; Garmany, C.; Sparks, R.; Pollock, W.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nIn building national capacity for better informal astronomy education and public outreach (EPO), what sorts of professional development interactions are most effective in what situations--and what interventions for improvement can be effectively applied? Building on previous experience, the ASP, in conjunction with its partners, is conducting two National Science Foundation (NSF) funded projects investigating astronomy teaching and learning in informal contexts to explore these questions in both museum-based and amateur astronomy club settings. \"Astronomy from the Ground Up\" (AfGU) develops capacity for hands-on astronomy education in small and medium-sized science centers and nature centers through on-site and online professional development workshops and the establishment of a \"community of practice\" network. The ASP, in collaboration with the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) and the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC), is investigating which model--face-to-face or online professional development--works best and will be sustainable for that target group. \"Sharing the Universe\" (STU) builds on the Night Sky Network in which amateur astronomy clubs, through the ASP with financial and logistical support from NASA and its missions, are provided tools and training to conduct EPO activities with their public audiences. The ASP, in collaboration with the Institute for Learning Innovation (ILI), launched a national survey in late 2007 to investigate the factors that either support or discourage sustained amateur astronomer EPO efforts, followed by an in-depth study of a subset of both successful and struggling clubs, and leading to the development of interventions that support amateur astronomy outreach within the context of a nurturing club environment. The presentation will offer some early and initial results of the AfGU project--which reveal some interesting and unforeseen advantages of the online model over the on-site model--and some\n\nThe Role of Amateur Astronomy to Outreach Astronomical Knowledge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhachatryan, Vachik; Voskanyan, Tsovak\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIt is known that in the educational system of republic the astronomy is not taught as a separate subject. Moreover, there are no telescopes in the vast majority of schools. \"Goodricke John\" NGO of amateur astronomers tries to fill this gap by organizing practical lessons of astronomy in secondary schools. NGO is equipped with high quality portable amateur telescopes and organizes periodic mass observations of planets, Moon, star clusters, nebulae in Yerevan and in regions. In addition, mass observations of rare astronomical phenomena are organized, such as the transit of Venus and Mercury across the disk of the Sun. Being the only NGO of amateur astronomers, it has a goal to contribute to publicizing astronomical knowledge and to ensure the availability of astronomical equipment, telescopes also to those segments of the society who have no opportunity to deal with them, in particular, persons with disabilities, prisoners, persons with disabilities, prisoners, soldiers, children from orphanages, school children and others.\n\nMarshall Amateur Radio Club experiment (MARCE) post flight data analysis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRupp, Charles C.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe Marshall Amateur Radio Club Experiment (MARCE) data system, the data recorded during the flight of STS-61C, the manner in which the data was reduced to engineering units, and the performance of the student experiments determined from the data are briefly described.\n\nAmateur Astronomy in the U.S.: A Survey.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFraknoi, Andrew\n\n1980-01-01\n\nLists and describes a variety of major national astronomy organizations which amateurs can join.

(Editor)\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe present volume on amateur astronomy deals with solar observations; planet, asteroid, and comet studies; photometry; education and communication; and history and sociology. Particular attention is given to the observation of the 1984 annular eclipse in Mexico, amateur solar astronomy in Germany, the Ashen Light of Venus, dust clouds on Mars in 1990, and the importance of comets Encke and Machholz. Also discussed are a UBVRI and occultation photometry acquisition and reduction software package for PC-based observatories, a Skyweek weekly newsletter on astronomy and spaceflight, and the Hubble Space Telescope and the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph.\n\nAmateurs - just amateurs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSmye-Rumsby, Greg\n\n2005-05-01\n\nFocus: Amateur astronomy beyond the backyard.

The club promotes many undergraduate opportunities; research projects, participating in telescope observational runs, sponsoring conference attendance as well as several public outreach opportunities. Research projects involving exoplanet transit observations and radio observations of cold molecular clouds allow undergraduates to experience data collection, telescope operations, data reduction and research presentation. The club hosts many star parties and various other public outreach events for the Tucson, Arizona location. The club often constructs their own outreach materials and structures. The club is currently working on creating a portable planetarium to teach about the night sky on the go even on the cloudiest of nights. The club is also working on creating a binocular telescope with two 10\" mirrors as a recreation of the local Large Binocular Telescope for outreach purposes as well. This is a club that strives for undergraduate activity and involvement in a range of academic and extracurricular activates, and is welcoming to all majors of all levels in hopes to spark astronomical interest.\n\nResults and Implications of Seven Years of the University of Arizona Astronomy Club\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWalker-LaFollette, Amanda; Towner, A. P.; Hardegree-Ullman, K.; Brissenden, G.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nParticipation in an undergraduate astronomy club or organization, be it social, academic, outreach-, or research-oriented, can be extremely beneficial to astronomy students. In this talk, we present the numerical results of the past seven years of University of Arizona Astronomy Club activities, particularly those relating to published papers, poster presentations, attendance at AAS meetings, and retention within the major. We also discuss less-quantifiable results, such as social, academic, and emotional support for club members. Finally, we highlight the efforts being performed by undergraduates at institutions all around the country, as presented in this Session.\n\nThe University of Arizona Astronomy Club Outreaches out to the Public and Beyond\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcGraw, Allison M.; Hardegree-Ullman, K.; Towner, A. P.; Walker-LaFollette, A.; Robertson, A.; Biddle, L. I.; Turner, J.; Smith, C.\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe University of Arizonaâs Astronomy Club utilizes many outreach tools in order to make astronomy exciting and obtainable for all demographics of the public. Hands-on activities are integrated along with three-dimensional models to explain many different astronomical topics including star clusters, habitable zones, and the local stellar neighborhood. The club hosts free monthly star parties to provide the public a better opportunity to explore the Tucson night sky. Club members volunteer their time and provide telescopes in a darker location just outside the city. No limits exist to types, shapes, and forms of outreach and providing education for this club. From toddlers to senior citizens, the club is always ready for a new event or opportunity to engage any audience. This is a unique experience for members of the public, as all of the members of the club are undergraduates of astronomy. Furthermore, it is an excellent and effective bonding experience between the students involved as they construct the models and work together to reach out to all members of the Tucson community.\n\nScopes for Schools: A Low-Cost Model for Bringing Hands-On Astronomy to the K-12 Classroom\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStassun, K. G.; Lattis, J.\n\n1999-12-01\n\nWe present a low-cost, field-tested model for astronomy and space-related outreach aimed at minority and under-serviced populations at the middle-school and high-school levels. The model centers around the creation of an extracurricular astronomy ``club\" at a middle school or high school, and an in-service training activity for teachers who will serve as club leaders. Students in the club engage in two hands-on activities: telescope-building and model rocketry. Implementation of the model requires a time investment of 1--2 hours per week over the course of one school year. The primary end products are (1) an ongoing extracurricular school club with trained teacher-leaders, (2) a set of portable Dobsonian telescopes for night-time sky-viewing sessions performed by the club as a service to the community, and (3) basic materials for continued model-rocketry activities. In its ideal implementation, the model brings together teachers and amateur astronomers in a lasting partnership. A specific example for funding an outreach program based on this model is presented. This outreach development was funded by a Special Initiatives outreach grant from the Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium, and by the UW-Madison College Access Program. Additional support was provided by Madison's amateur astronomy organization, the Madison Astronomical Society.\n\nBringing Astronomy to the Classroom: A Model for Planting Seeds of Interest\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStassun, K.

M.; Robertson, A.; Smith, C.; Biddle, L. I.; Turner, J.\n\n2013-06-01\n\nMembership in formal or informal groups of students with similar interests provides many benefits to undergraduate astronomy majors at the University of Arizona. First and foremost, members benefit from peer social and academic support within the major. These benefits are both tangible and intangible: students form friendships with like-minded peers, which can sustain them through difficult periods of study, but these social networks are the basis of later professional networks as well. Students in the U of A Astronomy Club have received both informal and formal research positions at other institutions as a direct result of the support, peer mentoring, and connections of club members, and at least six also hold paid, non-research positions within the department as a result of their connection to the club. Finally, most Astronomy Club members take their first steps into professional astronomy, such as attendance at a AAS Meeting, as a result of Club membership and the encouragement of older club members.\n\nA Workshop on High Energy Astrophysical for Amateur Astronomers\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFishman, Gerald J.; Mattei, J. A.; Rose, M. Franklin (Technical Monitor)\n\n2000-01-01\n\nAmateur astronomers are, in general, an enthusiastic and dynamic group of individuals who can help greatly in astronomy public outreach and education programs. In the U.S., they outnumber professional astronomers by over a factor of ten. Over eighty amateur astronomers from all over the U.S. and abroad attended a unique workshop in Huntsville, Alabama in April of this year. Most attendees were provided with travel grants under the condition that they disseminate knowledge gained at the workshop to civic groups, astronomy clubs and science teacher groups in their home communities. Twelve lecturers were given over two days, primarily by active high-energy researchers from NASA-MSFC and NASA-GSFC. Funding for the workshop was provided by a variety of NASA-sponsored projects, offices within OSS and private funding sources. The workshop attendees were selected by the AAVSO, which also administered the funding for the workshop. This high-leverage educational and public outreach program was deemed to be highly successful and bodes well for similar, future workshops. Many of the participants have already begun to give public talks on HEA and GRBs.\n\nA Wide Spectrum of Solar Science for After School Astronomy Club\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMayo, Lou; Thieman, James R.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAfter School Astronomy clubs are an important method of exposing students to astronomy at the critical middle school age when sparking an interest can inspire a lifelong career or hobby. We know that teachers complain that they can spend little time on astronomy in the classroom since they must teach to the test and the curriculum requirements do not have very extensive astronomy coverage. We also know that space is a very popular subject with students that can motivate them to join an after school club. One of the problems with after school astronomy clubs is that they don't often have a chance to observe the night sky. We propose to train club mentors on how to do daytime solar observing so students fulfill the IYA goal of looking through a telescope. We propose to provide a half day workshop for elementary and middle school teachers on starting and maintaining After School Astronomy clubs with special emphasis on observing the Sun not only in the visible spectrum but with radio waves and other parts of the spectrum as well. We will use NASA-oriented or NASA-funded educational materials and websites to bring a variety of ideas to the mentors and a broad knowledge of astronomy to the students. Attendees will be given an overview of the science of the Sun and how it can affect us on the Earth. They will be shown the dynamic nature of the Sun and what to look for to track the events happening there. The educators will be shown simple approaches to directly observing the Sun such as pinhole cameras, use of projection techniques with telescopes or binoculars, etc. They will be acquainted with sunspotter scopes and the advantages and disadvantages (such as expense) they pose for getting students involved. We will also point out the possibilities of using regular telescopes with solar filters and the specialized solar viewing telescopes such as the Coronado. Once the educators are comfortable with the simple approaches to viewing the Sun we will expose them to advanced\n\nPopular Astronomy in the World and in Armenia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMickaelian, A. M.\n\n2014-10-01\n\nA review on the popular astronomy and astronomy outreach in the world and in Armenia is given. Various ways and methods of popularization of astronomy are described. The International Year of Astronomy (IYA-2009), amateur astronomy, publication of books and other materials, the database of astronomical books, AstroBook exhibition, science-popular articles, \"Astghagitak\" online science-popular astronomical journal, calendar of astronomical events, databases of Solar and Lunar eclipses 2001-2050, planetary triple conjunctions 2001-2050, and of periodic comets at ArAS webpage, ArAS School Lectures Program, public lectures, \"Universe\" club at \"Mkhitar Sebastatsi\" educational ensemble, the online database of Armenian astronomers, biographies of famous Armenian astronomers, astronomers' anniversaries, scientific journalism of Armenia, and \"Mass media news\" section at ArAS webpage are described and discussed.\n\nThe Astronomical Society of the Pacific - Education and Public Outreach in the International Year of Astronomy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGibbs, Michael; Manning, J.; Gurton, S.; Fraknoi, A.; Berendsen, M.; Hurst, A.; White, V.\n\n2008-05-01\n\nAt the forefront of sharing the excitement of our exploration of the universe for 120 years, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) is poised to use its networks and services to implement education and outreach programs for the 2009 International Year of Astronomy (IYA).

J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Society of Astronomy Students (SAS) at New Mexico State University (NMSU) was founded in October of 2012 and chartered in January 2013. New Mexico State University is located in Las Cruces, New Mexico, which is a small city with a population of just over 100,000. The main campus at NMSU has an enrollment of approximately 14,300 undergraduate students and 3,375 graduate students. The NMSU Astronomy Department is a vibrant research environment that offers Ph.D. and M.S. Graduate degrees and serves the undergraduate population through a large number of general education courses. Although there is no undergraduate major in Astronomy at NMSU, students can earn an undergraduate Astronomy Minor. The SAS was conceived as a way to provide undergraduates with an interest in astronomy a way to communicate, network, and provide mutual support. Currently, the SAS is in its second year of being a chartered organization and has about 18 active members, about half of whom are planning on pursuing an Astronomy Minor. The SAS is striving to become one of the most active clubs on the NMSU campus in order to raise awareness about Astronomy and encourage the option of pursuing the Astronomy Minor. One of the main focus areas of the SAS is to be involved in both astronomy-related and non-astronomy-related public outreach and community service events. Since the clubs inception, the SAS members have contributed a total of over 120 volunteer hours. We do many outreach events with the elementary and middle schools around the community; these events are done jointly with the Astronomy Graduate Student Organization at NMSU. In the near future, the SAS is also planning a wide range of activities, including a guest speaker series at weekly club meetings, tours of the Apache Point Observatory, full moon outings, and participation in amateur astronomy events such as the Messier Marathon. This presentation will include an overview of the club's history, accomplishments, and future activities.\n\nPrepared for sudden cardiac arrest? A cross-sectional study of automated external defibrillators in amateur sport.\n\nPubMed\n\nCronin, Owen; Jordan, Joseph; Quigley, Fionnuala; Molloy, Michael G\n\n2013-12-01\n\nSudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a rare but tragic part of professional and amateur sport. Following multiple high profile deaths in professional sport over the past two decades, there has been a significant trend towards the widespread availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) at amateur sports grounds. To examine the availability of AEDs in amateur sports clubs in Cork, Ireland, and to investigate club practices with respect to the purchase, accessibility, maintenance and use of AEDs. A cross-sectional survey of 218 amateur Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), soccer and rugby clubs was conducted between July and September 2012. Club committee representatives answered a 22-point questionnaire. 126 GAA clubs and 28 soccer and 17 rugby (n=171) clubs were enrolled in this study. A total of 81.3% of amateur clubs own an AED. We estimate an AED-use rate of one AED use for every 54.5 years an AED is available. Almost 50% of club representatives thought the location of their club AED could be improved while 12.9% of clubs admitted to not maintaining their club AED on a regular basis. A large proportion of amateur clubs in Cork City and County own an AED. Many clubs engage in regular maintenance and storage of AEDs. However, this study identifies several areas for improvement in facilitating a secure chain of survival for players in the event of an SCA.\n\nThe New Amateur Astronomer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMobberley, Martin\n\nAmateur astronomy has changed beyond recognition in less than two decades. The reason is, of course, technology. Affordable high-quality telescopes, computer-controlled 'go to' mountings, autoguiders, CCD cameras, video, and (as always) computers and the Internet, are just a few of the advances that have revolutionized astronomy for the twenty-first century. Martin Mobberley first looks at the basics before going into an in-depth study of whatâs available commercially. He then moves on to the revolutionary possibilities that are open to amateurs, from imaging, through spectroscopy and photometry, to patrolling for near-earth objects - the search for comets and asteroids that may come close to, or even hit, the earth. The New Amateur Astronomer is a road map of the new astronomy, equally suitable for newcomers who want an introduction, or old hands who need to keep abreast of innovations. From the reviews: \"This is one of several dozen books in Patrick Moore's \"Practical Astronomy\" series. Amid this large family, Mobberley finds his niche: the beginning high-tech amateur. The book's first half discusses equipment: computer-driven telescopes, CCD cameras, imaging processing software, etc. This market is changing every bit as rapidly as the computer world, so these details will be current for only a year or two. The rest of the book offers an overview of scientific projects that serious amateurs are carrying out these days. Throughout, basic formulas and technical terms are provided as needed, without formal derivations. An appendix with useful references and Web sites is also included. Readers will need more than this book if they are considering a plunge into high-tech amateur astronomy, but it certainly will whet their appetites. Mobberley's most valuable advice will save the book's owner many times its cover price: buy a quality telescope from a reputable dealer and install it in a simple shelter so it can be used with as little set-up time as\n\nThe Astronomical League\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStevens, J. A.; Stevens, B. L.\n\n2000-10-01\n\nFounded over fifty years ago, the League is the largest general astronomy society in the world. It is a recognized non-profit, educational organization, promoting the science of astronomy. This includes astronomical education, research, individual observing of the heavens and coordination between the amateur and professional astronomy communities. The Astronomical League publishes a quarterly newsletter, the \"Reflector\", which details amateur activities and amateur collaboration with professional astronomers. The League's Observing Clubs hone the skills of the amateur astronomer in using their telescopes. These clubs provide awards to encourge observing and learning the sky. More general awards are presented to encourage amateur astronomy and the science of astronomy. These include the National Young Astronomer Award, amd the Horkheimer Planetary Imaging Award. They also sponsor conventions on both the National and Regional levels. This year's national is in Ventura, California, next year, near Washington, D.C.\n\n75 FR 78169 - Amateur Service Rules\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-12-15\n\n..., club, or military recreation station and it is certified by a civil defense organization as registered...

However, this is a rather recent situation. Meteor astronomy, although popular among amateurs, was the very last topic within astronomy to benefit from a truly international approach. Anyone attempting long term studies of, for instance, meteor stream structures will be confronted with the systematic lack of usable observations due to the absence of any standards in observing, recording and reporting, any archiving or publishing policy. Visual meteor observations represent the overall majority of amateur efforts, while photographic and radio observing were developed only in recent decades as technological specialties of rather few meteor observing teams.\n\nThe Networks Of The Astronomical Society Of The Pacific And The International Year Of Astronomy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFraknoi, Andrew; Manning, J.; Gurton, S.; Gibbs, M.; Hurst, A.; White, V.; Berendsen, M.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nSerious planning has begun for the International Year of Astronomy (IYA) in 2009, which will also be the 120th anniversary of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP). A key element required for IYA's success in reaching the maximum number of people in the U.S. will be to find effective ways of disseminating the programs and materials that are being developed. The ASP's national networks of educational intermediaries can play a major role in training, dissemination, and organization for IYA. These networks include: the Project ASTRO National Site Network (13 regional sites training professional and amateur astronomers to work with local teachers and families), the Night Sky Network (over 200 amateur astronomy clubs engaged in active outreach), the Astronomy from the Ground Up Network (smaller science and nature centers increasing their offerings in astronomy), and the Cosmos in the Classroom Network (hundreds of instructors of introductory astronomy in community, state, and liberal arts colleges). The ASP also offers \"The Universe in the Classroom\", a quarterly newsletter for those teaching astronomy in grades 3-12, an extensive web site of educational resources, podcasts, workshops, national conferences, and awards to help improve the public understanding of astronomy. At the Summer 2008 AAS meeting, the ASP will sponsor a major symposium and workshops on preparing for IYA (and working with a range of different audiences.)\n\nThe Victorian Amateur Astronomer: Independent Astronomical Research in Britain 1820-1920\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChapman, Allan\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThis is the first book to look in detail at amateur astronomy in Victorian Britain. It deals with the technical issues that were active in Victorian astronomy, and reviews the problems of finance, patronage and the dissemination of scientific ideas. It also examines the relationship between the amateur and professional in Britain. It contains a wealth of previously unpublished biographical and anecdotal material, and an extended bibliography with notes incorporating much new scholarship. In The Victorian Amateur Astronomer, Allan Chapman shows that while on the continent astronomical research was lavishly supported by the state, in Britain such research was paid for out of the pockets of highly educated, wealthy gentlemen the so-called Grand Amateurs . It was these powerful individuals who commissioned the telescopes, built the observatories, ran the learned societies, and often stole discoveries from their state-employed colleagues abroad. In addition to the Grand Amateurs , Victorian Britain also contained many self-taught amateurs. Although they belonged to no learned societies, these people provide a barometer of the popularity of astronomy in that age. In the late 19th century, the comfortable middle classes clergymen, lawyers, physicians and retired military officers took to astronomy as a serious hobby. They formed societies which focused on observation, lectures and discussions, and it was through this medium that women first came to play a significant role in British astronomy. Readership: Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying the history of science or humanities, professional historians of science, engineering and technology, particularly those with an interest in astronomy, the development of astronomical ideas, scientific instrument makers, and amateur astronomers.\n\nAmateur Astronomers: Secret Agents of EPO\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBerendsen, M.; White, V.; Devore, E.; Reynolds, M.\n\n2008-06-01\n\nAmateur astronomers prime the public to be more interested, receptive, and excited about space science, missions, and programs. Through recent research and targeted programs, amateur astronomy outreach is being increasingly recognized by professional astronomers, educators, and other amateurs as a valued and important service. The Night Sky Network program, administered by the ASP, is the first nationwide research-based program specifically targeted to support outreach by amateur astronomers. This Network of trained and informed amateur astronomers can provide a stimulating introduction to your EPO programs as Network members share the night sky with families, students, and youth groups.\n\nEncouraging A Culture Of Outreach In Astronomy Clubs: Findings From The Astronomical Society Of The Pacific, The Institute For Learning Innovation, And Inverness Research\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nManning, Jim; Jones, E.; St. John, M.; Berendsen, M.; Schultz, G.

K.; White, J. C.\n\n2004-05-01\n\nExperienced amateur astronomers represent a unique resource for their professional counterparts. Many knowledgeable amateurs now have telescopes in the 0.2- to 0.5-m class equipped with high-grade CCDs and software. To foster stronger ties between these observers and astronomical researchers, the AAS Council established a Working Group for Professional-Amateur Collaboration (WGPAC) during the Society's 193rd meeting in January 1999. Initially given a five-year charter, the WGPAC was made permanent at the 202nd Council meeting in May 2003. Since its creation the WGPAC has coordinated its activities with major amateur-astronomy organizations, sponsored a tutorial workshop at the annual meeting of the Astronomical League, laid the groundwork for a national registry of highly qualified amateur observers, and promoted pro-am collaborations through articles in the AAS Newsletter and leading amateur-astronomy publications.\n\nContribution to the popularization of the astronomy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarkishki, Pencho\n\nThe purpose of this report is the representation of a WEB-book, related to astronomy, astro-photography, optics and some additional areas that have direct practice for the amateur astronomers. The popularization of astronomy worldwide is the purpose of many amateur astronomers. It is interesting and maybe fascinated, requires often innovative solutions from the hobby star observers. Today it is possible to share the science information by different methods, using the modern information technologies - a possibility used by the amateur astronomers too. In Internet existing currently thousands of WEB- sites, related to astronomy, completed training programs developed by amateur astronomers are included. They are addressed often to the schools, to the hobby beginners or to the wide audience.\n\nGrote Reber, Radio Astronomy Pioneer, Dies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2002-12-01\n\nsomething of a minor tourist attraction, he later recalled. Using electronics he designed and built that pushed the technical capabilities of the era, Reber succeeded in detecting \"cosmic static\" in 1939. In 1941, Reber produced the first radio map of the sky, based on a series of systematic observations. His radio-astronomy work continued over the next several years. Though not a professional scientist, his research results were published in a number of prestigious technical journals, including Nature, the Astrophysical Journal, the Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers and the Journal of Geophysical Research. Reber also received a number of honors normally reserved for scientists professionally trained in astronomy, including the American Astronomical Society's Henry Norris Russell Lectureship and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific's Bruce Medal in 1962, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Jansky Lectureship in 1975, and the Royal Astronomical Society's Jackson-Gwilt Medal in 1983. Reber's original dish antenna now is on display at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's site in Green Bank, West Virginia, where Reber worked in the late 1950s. All of his scientific papers and records as well as his personal and scientific correspondence are held by the NRAO, and will be exhibited in the observatory's planned new library in Charlottesville, Virginia. Reber's amateur-radio callsign, W9GFZ, is held by the NRAO Amateur Radio Club. This callsign was used on the air for the first time since the 1930s on August 25, 2000, to mark the dedication of the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope.

And there is a whole army of amateur astronomers around the world who just love doing astronomy. They don't get paid for the privilege of experiencing the sky in all its glory, but by making detailed observations they do make a very important contribution towards the Science. These observations are especially useful when organized as a collective effort. Citizen science has really taken off in the last few years and the GAIA project will soon be producing so much data, that the professionals just will not have enough manpower to tackle all the data. They will rely on amateurs sitting on their computers at home. But it is under a dark sky that astronomy really comes alive. The fact that you have picked up this book, must mean that you are interested in taking the hobby a step forward.\n\nAmateur radio communications in a disaster preparedness simulation When all else fails . . . amateur radio.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcCamey, Randy; Yeager, Jennifer\n\nDuring natural disasters, communications can be disrupted, which negatively impacts response time of first responders thus diminishing the level of care provided to disaster victims. In the fall of 2014, as part of a larger community-based participatory research study, the Tarleton Area Amateur Radio Club (TAARC) joined the Department of Nursing, Tarleton State University, and provided amateur radio communications during a disaster preparedness simulation. The simulation was conducted to determine the ability of the university to provide rapid response and render quality, acute healthcare to its neighbors during a natural disaster. The primary goals of the TAARC were to assess the ability to quickly establish radio communications, accurately relay messages, and establish rapport and affiliation between each facility commander and the amateur radio operators. It was determined that communication was key to provide quality care, and the inclusion of amateur radio operators in the simulation helped ensure rapid response times and rapid transport of critical victims.\n\nThe Next Generation of NASA Night Sky Network: A Searchable Nationwide Database of Astronomy Events\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAmes, Z.; Berendsen, M.; White, V.\n\n2010-08-01\n\nWith support from NASA, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) first developed the Night Sky Network (NSN) in 2004. The NSN was created in response to research conducted by the Institute for Learning Innovation (ILI) to determine what type of support amateur astronomers could use to increase the efficiency and extent of their educational outreach programs. Since its creation, the NSN has grown to include an online searchable database of toolkit resources, Presentation Skills Videos covering topics such as working with kids and how to answer difficult questions, and a searchable nationwide calendar of astronomy events that supports club organization. The features of the NSN have allowed the ASP to create a template that amateur science organizations might use to create a similar support network for their members and the public.\n\nWhat's Up?

Background: What's Up Podcasts are 2 minute video podcasts available through RSS feed, You tube, and NASA websites every month. They feature an astronomy related viewing target in the sky each month, targets visible to everyone, from city or country, just by looking up! No telescope is required to view these objects. Summary: Expand and broaden the scope of the existing \"What's Up\" public astronomy themed video podcasts. NASA builds partnerships and linkages between Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics formal and informal education providers. What's Up podcasts provides a link between astronomical views and events, or \"what's up in the night sky this month\" with current NASA missions, mission milestones and events, space telescope images or press releases. These podcasts, plus supporting star charts, hands-on activities, standards-based educational lessons and mission links will be used by museums, planetariums, astronomy clubs, civic and youth groups, as well as by classrooms and the general public. They can be translated to other languages, too. Providing the podcasts in high definition, through the NASA websites, You Tube, iTunes and other web video sharing sites reaches wide audiences of all ages. Third Saturn Observation Night - May 18, 2008 Centered on Saturn Opposition, when the Sun and Saturn are on opposite sides of the Earth, all IYA participants - in all countries around the world - will be encouraged to take their telescopes out and share the planet Saturn with their communities. NASA's International Saturn Observation Campaign network of astronomy enthusiasts has now conducted a Saturn Observation Night event for the past 2 years, and it succeeds by building an international community all sharing Saturn.

Carleton College offers monthly open houses at Goodsell Observatory and donated its recently \"retire\" observing equipment to local schools. While public evenings continue to be popular, the donated equipment was underutilized due to a lack of trained student observing assistants. With sponsorship from NASA's IYA Student Ambassador program, the sustainable astronomy project began in 2009 to generate greater interest in astronomy and train middle school and high school students as observing assistants. Carleton physics majors developed curricular materials and instituted regular outreach programs for grades 6-12. The Northfield High School Astronomy Club was created, and Carleton undergraduates taught high school students how to use telescopes and do CCD imaging. During the summer of 2009, Carleton students began the Young Astronomers Summer Experience (YASE) program for middle school students and offered a two-week, astronomy-rich observing and imaging experience at Goodsell Observatory. In concert with NASA's Summer of Innovation initiative, the YASE program was offered again in 2010 and engaged a new group of local middle school students in hands-on scientific experiments and observing opportunities. Members of the high school astronomy club now volunteer as observing assistants in the community and graduates of the YASE programs are eager to continue observing as members of a public service astronomy club when they enter the Northfield High School. These projects are training future scientists and will sustain the public's interest in astronomy long after the end of IYA 2009.\n\nAstronomical Book Trek: Astronomy Books of 1983.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFraknoi, Andrew\n\n1984-01-01\n\nPresents an annotated list of technical and non-technical astronomy books.

H.; Henden, A.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nAmateur astronomers are professionals in other areas. They bring expertise from such varied and technical careers as computer science, mathematics, engineering, and marketing. These skills, coupled with an enthusiasm for astronomy, can be used to help manage the large data sets coming online in the next decade. We will show specific examples where teams of amateurs have been involved in mining large, online data sets and have authored and published their own papers in peer-reviewed astronomical journals. Using the proposed LSST database as an example, we will outline a framework for involving amateurs in data analysis and education with large astronomical surveys.\n\nAstronomy Explained\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNorth, Gerald\n\nEvery year large numbers of people take up the study of astronomy, mostly at amateur level. There are plenty of elementary books on the market, full of colourful photographs, but lacking in proper explanations of how and why things are as they are. Many people eventually wish to go beyond the 'coffee-table book' stage and study this fascinating subject in greater depth. This book is written for them. In addition, many people sit for public examinations in this subject each year and this book is also intended to be of use to them. All the topics from the GCSE syllabus are covered here, with sample questions at the end of each chapter. Astronomy Explained provides a comprehensive treatment of the subject in more depth than is usually found in elementary works, and will be of interest to both amateur astronomers and students of astronomy.\n\nAstronomy Books of 1984: The Non-Technical List.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFraknoi, Andrew\n\n1985-01-01\n\nPresents an annotated list of nontechnical astronomy books in these categories: amateur astronomy; children's books; cosmology; galaxies; general astronomy; history of astronomy; life in the universe; physics and astronomy; pseudoscience; quasars and active galaxies; solar system; space exploration; stars/stellar evolution; sun; astronomyâ¦\n\nResolution of low-velocity control in golf putting differentiates professionals from amateurs.\n\nPubMed\n\nHasegawa, Yumiko; Fujii, Keisuke; Miura, Akito; Yamamoto, Yuji\n\n2017-07-01\n\nIt is difficult for humans to apply small amounts of force precisely during motor control. However, experts who have undergone extended training are thought to be able to control low-velocity movement with precision. We investigated the resolution of motor control in golf putting. A total of 10 professional and 10 high-level amateur golfers participated. Putting distances were 0.6-3.3Â m, in increments of 0.3Â m. We measured the impact velocity and the club-face angle at impact, and the acceleration profile of the downswing. The professionals showed significantly smaller coefficients of variation with respect to impact velocity and smaller root mean square errors in relation to acceleration profiles than did the amateurs. To examine the resolution of motor control for impact velocity, we investigated intra-participant differences in the impact velocity of the club head at two adjacent distances. We found that professionals had higher velocity precision when putting small distance intervals than did amateurs. That is, professionals had higher resolution of low-velocity control than did high-level amateurs. Our results suggest that outstanding performance at a task involves the ability to recognise small distinctions and to produce appropriate movements.\n\nAmateur Astronomers as Champions of IYA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBerendsen, M.; White, V.; Hawkins, I.; Mayo, L.; Pompea, S. M.; Sparks, R.; Day, B.; Mann, T.; Walker, C.; Fienberg, R. T.\n\n2008-11-01\n\nOne of the main goals of the International Year of Astronomy 2009 (IYA2009) is to provide the public with opportunities to experience the universe through the eyepiece of a telescope. Amateur astronomers are uniquely equipped to fulfill this goal by offering their knowledge, time, and telescopes at public events in their communities. The NASA Night Sky Network (http://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov) will be a hub for access to programs that support amateur astronomers doing such outreach during IYA2009, including a set of monthly themes with materials and activities to complement each theme. Many of the programs will be available to amateur astronomers worldwide. Among the other programs and organizations collaborating with the ASP to provide resources to amateur astronomers in their roles as informal educators during IYA2009 are: GLOBE at Night, Dark Skies Discovery Sites, NASA's LCROSS Mission, IYA's Looking through a Telescope working group, NASA's Sun-Earth Connection, and Galileoscopes.\n\nNathaniel Bowditch, Early American Amateur Astronomer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilliams, Thomas R.\n\n1984-10-01\n\nNathaniel Bowditch had very successful careers as a seaman/ship's master and as an actuary/insurance executive. In addition he managed to make very substantial contributions to mathematics and astronomy. Bowditch is therefore important as one of the earliest significant amateur astronomers in the United States.\n\nReception and dissemination of American amateur telescope making in Sweden\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKarnfelt, Johan\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThis paper discusses the appropriation of the American Amateur Telescope Making (ATM) movement in Sweden in the 1940s and 1950s. A key player was the Swedish Astronomical Society, which in 1943, and inspired by the American example, launched a campaign to raise interest in ATM and disseminate the necessary knowledge amongst potential amateur astronomers. The campaign was successful and in just a few years it quadrupled the number of amateurs with access to telescopes. Swedish amateurs kept on building telescopes through the 1950s, but the activities then stalled with the introduction of cheap mass-market telescopes. The appropriation of ATM in Sweden is an important example of how technical innovations have shaped the course of amateur astronomy.\n\nMusic and Astronomy Under the Stars 2009\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLubowich, D.\n\n2010-08-01\n\nBring telescopes to where the people are! Music and Astronomy Under the Stars is a three-year NASA-funded astronomy outreach program at community parks during and after music concerts and outdoor family eventsâsuch as a Halloween Stars-Spooky Garden Walk. While there have been many astronomy outreach activities and telescope observations at city sidewalks and parks, this program targets a completely different audience: music lovers who are attending summer concerts held in community parks. These music lovers who may never have visited a science museum, planetarium, or star party are exposed to telescope observations and astronomy information with no additional travel costs. Music and Astronomy Under the Stars increased awareness, engagement, and interest in astronomy at classical, pop, rock, and ethnic music concerts. This program includes solar observing before the concerts, telescope observations including a live image projection system, an astronomical video presentation, and astronomy banners/posters. Approximately 500-16,000 people attended each event and 25% to 50% of the people at each event participated in the astronomy program. This program also reached underrepresented and underserved groups (women, minorities, older adults). The target audience (Nassau and Suffolk Counties, New York) is 2,900,000 people, which is larger than combined population of Atlanta, Boston, Denver, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Although eleven events were planned in 2009, two were canceled due to rain and our largest event, the NY Philharmonic in the Park (attended by 67,000 people in 2008), was cancelled for financial reasons. Our largest event in 2009 was the Tanglewood Music Festival, Lenox MA, attended by 16,000 people where over 5000 people participated in astronomy activities. The Amateur Observers' Society of New York assisted with the NY concerts and the Springfield STARS astronomy club assisted at Tanglewood. In 2009 over 15,000 people participated in astronomy\n\nNight Sky Network: A partnership with NASA, the ASP and Astronomical League\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChippindale, S.; Berendsen, M.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nIn 2002, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) surveyed amateur astronomers to determine their views and experiences with public outreach. The ultimate goal was to discover methods to support amateur astronomers in their outreach efforts. The survey discovered that they are looking for ready-made, themed materials, training in astronomy content and presentation skills, mentoring, and networking to enhance their astronomy events and support their ability to do educational outreach. Acting on these results and with funding from NASA, the ASP is forming a nationwide coalition of amateur astronomy clubs whose members bring the science, technology and inspiration of NASA's missions to the general public. The program consists of three primary components: outreach materials, training, and community building. Member-based astronomy clubs will receive kits of materials on various astronomy topics to supplement and enhance their events as well as a \"professional development\" component that includes training on how to use the materials and tips to strengthen their individual presentation skills. The Night Sky Network web site includes public pages and a user area where success stories and challenges can be exchanged, new information downloaded, and a support area for amateur astronomers doing outreach. We are currently testing our first kit, \"PlanetQuest: The Search for Another Earth\", in over two dozen clubs across the country. The second kit, \"Big Bang to Black Holes\" is under development for NASA's Structure and Evolution of the Universe Forum through the SAO and will be beta tested over the spring and summer of 2004. Sponsored and supported by NASA-Navigator Program, NASA-SAO Education Forum, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and the Astronomical League.\n\nEngaging Generation Now, Inspiring Generation Next\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSimonsen, Mike; Gay, P.\n\n2008-05-01\n\nIn 2008, the Education and Public Outreach Committee of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) initiated several new strategies for disseminating accurate, stimulating, engaging information on general astronomy and variable star science to thousands of students, parents, and amateur astronomers each year through astronomy clubs, societies, and star party events. We are initiating contact with astronomy clubs and organizations to offer qualified speakers from the AAVSO Speakers Bureau for their meetings and activities. The current roster of speakers include, professional astronomers, doctors, engineers, teachers and some of the world's leading variable star observers. Request information is available on the AAVSO website. For organizations and individuals unable to engage one of our speakers due to time, distance or financial constraints, we have made PowerPoint presentations used in previous talks available free for download from the same web pages. Thousands of amateur astronomers and their children attend star parties each year. As an extension of our speakersâ bureau, our goal is to have an AAVSO representative at each of the major star parties each year giving an enthusiastic talk on variable stars or related astronomical subject and supplying inspirational printed materials on astronomy and amateur contributions to science. The nation's largest astronomy clubs have monthly newsletters they distribute to their membership. Newsletter editors are constantly in need of quality, interesting content to fill out their issues each month. We are offering a `writersâ bureauâ service to newsletter editors, similar to the news wire services used by newspapers. We will supply up to a half dozen articles on astronomy and variable star science each month for editors to use at their discretion in their publications. Our goal is to provide information, inspiration and encourage participation among amateur astronomers and their kids, our next\n\nMusic and Astronomy Under the Stars - 2009 Update\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLubowich, Donald A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBring telescope to where the people are!

The modern astronomy movement is believed to have started when an official observation programme of Haley's comet was organized by Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (RONAST) in 1986. Following the huge pressure from the scientific community, the Nepal government (Kingdom of Nepal at that time) established B.P. Koirala Memorial Planetarium, Observatory and Science Museum Development Board in 1992. Initiatives of the project started with observatory set up and the development of astrophysics syllabus for university students. Astrophysics is included as an elective paper in the Physics masters course. The lead astrophysicist of Nepal Dr. Binil Aryal is running a research group in Tribhuvan University since 2005 which has a significant number of international publications. The developing government initiatives and achievements will be discussed. In 2007, a group of astronomy enthusiastic students along with amateurs working independently in past established Nepal Astronomical Society (NASO), which surprisingly increased the amateur activities and inspired other amateur groups to revive. During IYA 2009, more than 80 outreach and observation events were organized solely by NASO. NASO was able to collaborate with many international programmes and projects like GHOU/GTTP, EurAstro, AWB, UNAWE, SGAC, Star Peace, TWAN etc during and beyond IYA2009. Currently Nepal is recognized as the most eventful country of outreach and astronomy education among the amateur community. The success story of the astronomy movement and the local difficulties while organizing the events will be explained.\n\nAstronomy in New Zealand\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHearnshaw, John B.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nAlthough New Zealand is a young country, astronomy played a significant role in its early exploration and discovery during the three voyages of Cook from 1769. In the later 19th century several expeditions came to New Zealand to observe the transits of Venus of 1874 and 1882 and New Zealand's rich history of prominent amateur astronomers dates from this time. The Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand (founded in 1920) has catered for the amateur community. Professional astronomy however had a slow start in New Zealand. The Carter Observatory was founded in 1941. But it was not until astronomy was taken up by New Zealand's universities, notably by the University of Canterbury from 1963, that a firm basis for research in astronomy and astrophysics was established. Mt John University Observatory with its four optical telescopes (largest 1.8 m) is operated by the University of Canterbury and is the main base for observational astronomy in the country. However four other New Zealand universities also have an interest in astronomical research at the present time. There is also considerable involvement in large international projects such as MOA, SALT, AMOR, IceCube and possibly SKA.\n\nExoplanet Research at a Southwestern Urban High School: Lessons Learned from the Tucson High Astronomy Club Research Program\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWatson, Zachary T.; Pompea, Stephen M.; Tucson High Astronomy Research Club\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe present the results of introducing talented youth to research astronomy projects related to the study of exoplanets. We present the results of students' development of their identities as scientist, their interest in the STEM field as a career, and their knowledge retention through individual surveys. The design of the student interaction was to have weekly after-school club meetings where basic material would be taught to aid the students addressing the research problems themselves by planning observations, observing, and ultimately reducing the data of observations of their selected exoplanets. The after-school club was composed of 12 students of varying backgrounds attending the urban TucsonMagnet High School. The program is ongoing and began September 2013.\n\nThe Supernova Club: Urban Youth Engagement that Works\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSakimoto, Philip J.; Luckey, V.; Balsara, D.\n\n2008-05-01\n\nOne of IYA's goals is to promote greater involvement by underrepresented minorities in scientific and engineering careers. IYA can serve as a catalyst for such involvement, but ultimate success requires a longer-term approach. The Supernova Club is an experiment in such a long-term approach. The goal is to see if engagement in a year-round astronomy club can propel youths from some of the most severely disadvantaged areas of our region into careers in science. We recruited club members by bringing astronomy activities to over a hundred youths ages 10-16 who were on campus in Summer 2007 for Notre Damesâ National Youth Sports Program (NYSP). Approximately 20 percent of the participants, most of who were underrepresented minorities and from below poverty level, expressed interest in joining an after-school astronomy club, and thirteen of them ultimately did so. The club meets one evening a week at Notre Dame's Robinson Community Learning Center. Center staff provide extensive support with logistics, meals, training in social skills and conduct, and communications with parents. Notre Dame scientists, assisted by local teachers, provide weekly activities. After one year, the club members have shown large improvements in interest in science and astronomy, ability to focus on tasks or discussions, and general behavior at school and at home. Funding for this first pilot year was provided through education supplements to HST research grants. With NASA space science education funding currently on an indefinite stand down, we are seeking other funds with which to carry on this experiment.\n\nAstronomy from the chair - the application of the Internet in promoting of Astronomy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTomic, Zoran\n\n2014-05-01\n\nInternet and modern communication technologies are an indispensable part of modern life. The use of the Internet makes it possible to enhance the education and expand opportunities for acquiring new knowledge. One example is Astronomy, where today thanks to the Internet, we can control telescopes that are distant from us and listen to lectures from Universities in other countries. \"Astronomy from the chair\" is the name for a concept where amateur astronomers can deal with astronomy from their homes using the Internet. The concept can be divided into four sections depending on the content being offered: Robotic Observatory, Virtual Observatory, Online astronomy broadcasting and Online courses. Robotic observatory is defined as an astronomical instrument and detection system that enables efficient observation without the need of a person's physical intervention. Virtual Observatory is defined as a collection of databases and software tools that use the Internet as a platform for scientific research. Online astronomy broadcasting is part of concept \"Astronomy from the chair\" which gives users the opportunity to get directly involved in astronomical observation organized by an amateur astronomer from somewhere in the world. Online courses are groups of sites and organizations that provide the opportunity to amateur astronomers to attend lectures, save and watch video materials from lectures, do homework, communicate with other seminar participants and in that way become familiar with the various areas of Astronomy. This paper discusses a new concept that describes how the Internet can be applied in modern education. In this paper will be described projects that allows a large number of astronomy lovers to do their own research without the need to own a large and expensive set of astronomical equipment (Virtual Telescope from Italy, Observatory \"Night Hawk\" from Serbia and project \"Astronomy from an armchair\" at Faculty of Sciences and Mathematics in Nis), to help\n\nTelescope Kits: A Teaching Vehicle for the International Year of Astronomy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPompea, Stephen M.; Fienberg, R. T.; Isbell, D.; Deustua, S.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nWe are examining a variety of telescope kits suitable for assembly by school-age children in order to design a cornerstone educational program for the International Year of Astronomy 2009-400 years after Galileo's observations. In our experience, telescope kits are superior to pre-assembled telescopes for use in an educational setting as the students feels a stronger sense of ownership and have a better understanding of the components and how they work. We examined several low to medium power refracting telescope kits including one kit used in the Hands-On Optics project at NOAO. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of each kit from an educational and optical perspective and what modifications may be made to enhance their educational utility. We also describe the optical and education requirements for a low-powered \"Galileoscope\", to be distributed widely during the IYA. We also describe how the \"Galileoscopeâ will be embedded in an educational program disseminated through science centers, amateur astronomy clubs and other Hands-On Optics centers and partners.\n\nSchool Astronomy Club: from Project to Knowledge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFolhas, Alvaro\n\n2016-04-01\n\nPrepare a generation of young people for the challenges of the future is a task which forces us to rethink the school, not just for being difficult, but also because students feel that the school has very little to offer, especially something that interests them. Thus, the school is dysfunctional, is ill, and needs prompt treatment. School have to adjust to the new times, and this does not mean changing the old blackboards by advanced interactive whiteboards. The school has to find the way to the students with something that seduce them: the Challenge. The Astronomy Club that I lead in my school is essentially a Project space. Students who voluntarily joined the club, organize themselves according to their interests around projects whose outcome is not defined from the beginning, which requires them to do, undo and redo. Which obliges them to feel the need to ask for help to mathematics or physics to achieve answers, to feel the passion to study with a genuine purpose of learning. Some examples of the work: The younger students are challenged to reproduce the historical astronomical experiments that have opened the doors of knowledge such as the Eratosthenes experiment to determine the perimeter of the Earth (on equinox), or by using congruent triangles, determine the diameter the sun. These students are driven to establish distance scales in the solar system, which, to their astonishment, allows them to clear misconceptions that arise from some pictures of books and allows them to have a scientifically correct idea of the planetary orbit and distance separating the planets of the Solar System. For students from 15 to 18 years, I have to raise the level of the challenges and use the natural tendency of this age bracket to assert making new and exciting things. To this purpose, I am fortunate to have the support of large organizations like NUCLIO, ESA, CERN, and Go-Lab Project, Inspiring Science Education, Open Discovery Space and Global Hands on Universe.

It covers topics such as terrestrial and astronomical coordinate systems, stars and constellations, the relative motions of the sky, sun, moon and earth leading to an understanding of the seasons, phases of the moon, and eclipses. Topics are discussed and compared for observers located in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Written in a conversational style, only addition and subtraction are needed to understand the basic principles and a more advanced mathematical treatment is available in the appendices. Each chapter contains a set of review questions and simple exercises to reinforce the reader's understanding of the material. The last chapter is a set of self-contained observation projects to get readers started with making observations about the concepts they have learned. William Charles Millar, currently Professor of Astronomy at Grand Rapids Community College in Michigan, has been teaching the subject for almost twenty years and is very involved with local amateur astronomy groups. Millar also belongs to The Planetary Society and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and has traveled to Europe and South America to observe solar eclipses. Millar holds a Masters degree in Physics from Western Michigan University.\n\nEffectiveness of Amateur Astronomers as Informal Science Educators\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGibbs, Michael G.; Berendsen, Margaret\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) conducted a national survey of in-service teachers participating in Project ASTRO.

V.; Suvaryan, Yu. M.; Mickaelian, A. M. (Eds.)\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe book contains 29 articles of the Proceedings of the Young Scientists Conference \"Cultural Astronomy in the Armenian Highland\" held at the Armenian National Academy of Sciences on 20-23 June 2016. It consists of 4 main sections: \"Introductory\", \"Cultural Astronomy\", \"Archaeoastronomy\", \"Scientific Tourism and Journalism, Astronomical Education and Amateur Astronomy\". The book may be interesting to astronomers, culturologists, philologists, linguists, historians, archaeologists, art historians, ethnographers and to other specialists, as well as to students.\n\nHow Create an Astronomy Outreach Program to Bring Astronomy to Thousands of People at Outdoor Concerts Astronomy Festivals, or Tourist Sites\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLubowich, Donald\n\n2015-08-01\n\nI describe how to create an astronomy program for thousands of people at outdoor concerts based on my $308,000 NASA-funded Music and Astronomy Under the Stars (MAUS) program (60 events 2009 - 2013), and the Astronomy Festival on the National Mall (AFNM, 10,000 people/yr).MAUS reached 50,000 music lovers at local parks and at the Central Park Jazz, Newport Folk, Ravinia, or Tanglewood Music Festivals with classical, folk, pop/rock, opera, Caribbean, or county-western concerts assisted by astronomy clubs. Yo-Yo-Ma, the Chicago and Boston Symphony Orchestras, Ravi Coltrane, Esperanza Spalding, Phish, Blood Sweat and Tears, Deep Purple, Tony Orlando, and Wilco performed at these events. AFNM was started in 2010 with co-sponsorship by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. MAUS and AFMN combine solar, optical, and radio telescope observations; large posters/banners; hands-on activities, imaging with a cell phone mount; citizen science activities; hand-outs; and teacher info packet. Representatives from scientific institutions participated. Tyco Brahe, Johannes Kepler, and Caroline Herschel made guest appearances.MAUS reached underserved groups and attracted large crowds. Young kids participated in this family learning experience-often the first time they looked through a telescope. While < 50% of the participants took part in a science activity in the past year, they found MAUS enjoyable and understandable; learned about astronomy; wanted to learn more; and increased their interest in science (ave. rating 3.6/4). MAUS is effective in promoting science education!Lessons learned: plan early; create partnerships with parks, concert organizers, and astronomy clubs; test equipment; have backup equipment; create professional displays; select the best location to obtain a largest number of participants; use social media/www sites to promote the events; use many telescopes for multipl"
