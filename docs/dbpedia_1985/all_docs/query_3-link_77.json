        "text": "Independent, single-sex, day & boarding school in Kent Town, South Australia, Australia\n\nPrince Alfred College (also referred to as PAC, Princes, or in sporting circles, the Reds)[3][4][5] is a private, independent, day and boarding school for boys, located on Dequetteville Terrace, Kent Town – near the centre of Adelaide, South Australia. Prince Alfred College was established in 1869 by the Methodist Church of Australasia, which amalgamated with other Protestant churches in 1977 to form the Uniting Church in Australia.\n\nThe school has enrolment of some 1,160 students from Reception to Year 12 (ages 2 to 18),[1] including some 151 boarders from years seven to twelve.[2] Prince Alfred College launched its own Early Learning Centre, Little Princes, in 1999, which was renamed Princes ELC in 2009, with a current enrolment of 260 students.[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPrince Alfred College was named after Prince Alfred during his visit to Adelaide in 1867. Alfred was one of the four sons of Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert. The school has attracted many royal visitors since its foundation, including Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in 1954.\n\nThe founders of PAC were determined that the religious traditions of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, should be indoctrinated in the school. Young Methodist men of the colony and PAC were encouraged to live disciplined, hard working and predominantly Christian lives, even though they were mocked facing society's temptations.\n\nThe only female student to attend the school was Lilian Staple Mead, daughter of Baptist minister Silas Mead, in 1883–1884, in order to matriculate and enter University at a time when few schools were available for girls to do so.[7][8][9]\n\nAt one time, Princes was the only college in Adelaide to offer the IB Diploma at all three stages; the PYP and MYP are compulsory units of work for Preparatory and Middle school students, enabling its students to continue to complete the Diploma in year 11 and 12, or to be recognised nationally with the SACE.[10][11][12]\n\nOn Wednesday 18 April 2018, Elizabeth II's son, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, visited Prince Alfred College, and participated in an unveiling a stone to commemorate the sesquicentennial of the College.[13] In 2019, Prince Alfred College celebrated its sesquicentenary 150th Anniversary.\n\nList of headmasters\n\n[edit]\n\n1869–1870 Samuel Fiddian\n\n1871–1875 John Hartley\n\n1876–1914 Frederic Chapple\n\n1915–1929 W. R. Bayly\n\n1930–1948 Fred Ward[14]\n\n1949–1969 John Dunning\n\n1970–1987 Geoffrey Bean\n\n1988–1999 Brian Webber\n\n2000–2004 Dr. Stephen Codrington[15]\n\n2004–2014 Kevin Tutt\n\n2014–2022 Bradley Fenner\n\n2022–current David Roberts\n\nCampuses\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original school campus is in the Adelaide suburb of Kent Town. The school also owns two other campuses, one for outdoor education in Scott's Creek, and the other in Point Turton named 'Wambana'.[16]\n\nKent Town\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original and main campus is located in Kent Town, approximately 2 km east of the Adelaide city centre. The land, originally leased by Dr Benjamin Archer Kent from 1840 to 1859, then bought by Charles Robin,[17] was bought at auction from Charles Robin for £2750 on 18 September 1865.[citation needed] However, it was not until 22 June 1969 that the college celebrated its inauguration, two years after the laying of the foundation stone by H.R.H. Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh.[18][19]\n\nThe school campus is divided by the main building, with the preparatory school on the Flinders Street (south) side of the school, and the middle and Senior schools on the Capper Street (north) side.\n\nScotts Creek Campus\n\n[edit]\n\nScotts Creek campus is the college's Murray River retreat. The Scotts Creek Outdoor Centre is located near Morgan, approximately 165 km from Adelaide. It provides a mix of environmental education, adventure and personal development activities.[20]\n\nWambana Campus\n\n[edit]\n\nWambana Campus is an off school ground recreational camp. The primary purpose of Wambana is to foster growth by helping adolescent boys better manage the transition to adulthood through immersion in community, academic, spiritual and outdoor adventures.[16]\n\nWambana is a six-acre (approx. 2.5 hectares) property situated on the coast of southern Yorke Peninsula, bordering the township of Point Turton and rural farming land. Students and staff live in a small village in which residential accommodation and a classroom are clustered around a central meeting facility. The property consists of six accommodation buildings known as \"Wardlis\" (aboriginal word meaning \"dwelling\"). Wambana accommodates up to 32 students for five-week periods.[16]\n\nSport\n\n[edit]\n\nPrince Alfred College is a member of the Sports Association for Adelaide Schools (SAAS).\n\nRowing\n\n[edit]\n\nRowing began at PAC in 1883 and has played an important part in the school's sporting culture since that time. The school has two boat houses, at West Lakes and by the Torrens Lake in the City of Adelaide's parklands. The school employs a full-time Director of Rowing, (currently Mr. Will Maling). Although competition in local and national regattas forms an integral part of the rowing programme, the main event for each year is the Head of the River. The school won the Head of the River in 2012, 2013 and 2014, captained by Jack Kelly (2012), Nicholas Parletta (2013) & William Burfield (2014). These years marked the first time the college has won three consecutive titles at the event.\n\nIntercol\n\n[edit]\n\nEach sports team at Princes has an annual fixture against traditional longtime rivals Saint Peter's College, known as the \"Intercol\" (Inter-collegiate). These are considered by the two colleges to be the most important games of the seasons, and the fiercely fought matches of the more popular sports draw big crowds of students and old scholars from both schools.[21] The Intercols have been played for over 100 years. At one time, the Australian rules football and the Cricket intercols were both played on Adelaide Oval. The Cricket Intercollegiate match has been competed since 1878. According to Richard Sproull[who?] this is \"the oldest unbroken annual contest in the history of cricket\" (Weekend Australian 5/6 December 1992).\n\nOutdoor education\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Prince Alfred College Outdoor Education programme provides a variety of integrated activities designed to allow boys to face challenges beyond those possible in a suburban day school. Current activities are focused on the Scotts Creek Outdoor Centre at Morgan on the River Murray.\n\nIn 2008, the college opened its Wambana Campus at Point Turton on the Yorke Peninsula. Year 9 students spend 5 weeks at the new facility, learning field science and mathematics along with other subjects and life skills as well as community service.\n\nYear 11 students undertake practical leadership training and are encouraged to nominate for trips to Nepal, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Kangaroo Island.\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also People educated at Prince Alfred College\n\nRhodes scholars\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Rhodes Scholarship is a postgraduate scholarship for study at Oxford University.
