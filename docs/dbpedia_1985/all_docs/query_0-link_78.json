When space permits, more than one crew can be featured per issue.\n\n\"Photo Gallery\" - A suggestion has been made for an ongoing photo gallery, where the vets or family members could submit WWII photos from their collections to be published in each issue. Please send in your photos!\n\n\"Then and Now\" - It is always interesting to see photos of people \"then\" (in our case, during the war) and how they look now! Send in your photos!"
