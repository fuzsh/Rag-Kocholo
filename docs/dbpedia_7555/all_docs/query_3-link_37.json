        "text": "Lori Lieberman \"Daughters And Sons\"\n\nLori Lieberman has remained in the shadows of the spotlight since the early seventies, quietly gleaning the respect of an industry and a devoted base of fans. As the one responsible for such hits as \"Killing Me Softly With His Song\" she consistently recorded album after album for Capitol Records, RCA, EMI, Pope Music, and currently, Drive On Records.\n\nThroughout the years of ever-changing styles and fads, one thing has remained constant in Lieberman's music-- her honest and heartfelt lyrics, coupled with her haunting, and beautiful melodies, always cutting right through to the heart of the listener.\n\nBorn in California, but raised in Switzerland, Lieberman felt the isolation and loneliness of growing up a foreigner early on, and as a young girl, turned to her writing as a form of connection, expressing her feelings in journals and in songs. One of three sisters, and the daughter of a chemical engineer and a homemaker, Lori Lieberman’s earliest influences came through her older sister, Susan, who, from her college in Maine, sent Lieberman her greatest and most life-changing gift of all, then current music from the states: Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins, Leonard Cohen, Jefferson Airplane and Tom Rush. Their music and sensibilities inspired her writing even more.\n\nLanding her first record deal with Capitol Records, amongst the collection of songs was a simple folk song, detailing Lieberman's experience of sitting in the back of a nightclub, transfixed by the musician onstage who seemed to sing right through her. The album, simply titled, \"Lori Lieberman,\" garnered both critical and audience appeal, and as it crept up the charts, it was Roberta Flack who heard Lieberman's version featured on an American Airlines music channel, immediately contacted her producer, Joel Dorn, and recorded the now classic, Grammy award winning song,\"Killing Me Softly.\"\n\nLori Lieberman went on to record four more albums (\"Becoming,\" \"A Piece Of Time,\" \"Straw Colored Girl,\" and \"The Best Of Lori Lieberman\"), touring extensively throughout the U.S. and Europe. It was, however, a little known New York based record label, Millennium,where Lieberman was most encouraged to step away from the mainstream. Under Jimmy Ienner's guidance, she wrote one of her most candid collections of songs, entitled, \"Letting Go.\"\n\nAs the styles of the music industry changed from James Taylor to disco, Lieberman retreated from the spotlight, becoming the mother of three children, and living a settled country existence in the hills of California. For many years, her music took a back seat to her busy day to day life, and it wasn't to come forward again, until producer Joseph Cali coaxed a reluctant Lieberman out of the shadows, and got her singing again. In the time spent away from the music business, Cali was surprised to see that she had continued writing, consistently putting her thoughts and music hidden in her treasure trove.\n\nTogether they released her first of three CDs on the Pope Music label.\n\n\"A Thousand Dreams,\" marked Lieberman's return to the music industry. A two mic live recording, engineered by Mark Levinson of Red Rose Music, captured her performance which was nominated for The Golden Note Award for the best original recording of the year. The featured performances by Amanda McBroom, Paulinho da Costa, Chuck Delmonico, The Gay Men's Chorus Of Los Angeles, and Dean Parks, to name a few, further enhanced an intricate musical experience. Followed by two more CDs on the Pope Music Label, (\"Home Of Whispers,\" and \"Gone Is The Girl\"), Lieberman established herself amongst a devoted following in the Audiofile community, and re-united herself with her large fan base once again.\n\nLieberman returned to performing, playing to sold out crowds with \"An Evening With Lori Lieberman\", at Pepperdine's Smothers Theatre, playing to sold out crowds. She was the featured artist on WFMT's Midnight Special with Rich Warren in Chicago, a staple of John Platt’s WFUV playlist, and a favorite of the legendary recording artist, Christine Lavin, who rated Lieberman’s two CDs, “A Thousand Dreams” and “Home Of Whispers”\n\namong her top ten recommended favorites.\n\n\"Monterey,\" her first release for Drive On Records, holds particular importance for Lieberman, the artist, whose compositions and arrangements embrace Lieberman’s signature subtle, beautiful vocals. With co-producer Joseph Cali, and featuring the talents of such superior musicians as Greg Liesz, John Leftwich, Stefanie Fife and Timothy Drury, “Monterey” is another exquisite work from one of our most enduring talents.\n\nLori Lieberman’s latest release, “Gun Metal Sky,\" is the definitive Lori Lieberman recording. Four years in the making, this CD reflects Lieberman’s growth as a vocalist, writer, producer and arranger. With eight songs penned by Lieberman, it also includes four songs by some of our most beloved songwriters and interpreted by her unique sensitivity and style. Named “Album Of The Month” UK, “Gun Metal Sky” has received stellar reviews for its unique arrangements and musical choices.\n\nV2 Records Benelux has released “Takes Courage,\" a digitally re-mastered, re-packaged, “Gun Metal Sky” with an additional track by Dennis Wilson, and a booklet of photographs and lyrics. To celebrate the release, Lori Lieberman will return to the Netherlands in September and November 2010, to perform three special concerts with the inimitable Mathilde Santing, and will be accompanied by the Matangi Quartet, with her special guest, Michiel Borstlap.\n\n\"Daughters And Sons\"\n\nMy father had three daughters. My being the middle one, it was always in my nature to try to please. I wanted to be like the neighbor boy, who my Dad always took to the football game, and many times I just about broke my neck jumping, as he had always done with ease and my father’s accolades, across the wide hedge that separated our two houses. I had always wanted a Patty Play Pal life-sized doll, but I wanted it in secret, as I didn’t want to blow my tomboy cover. So when Christmas came and we opened our presents, my younger sister got the doll, while I got a model Tiger airplane. Later that Christmas afternoon the palm tree fronds fell onto the street as the Santa Ana winds blew stronger. And while my sister watched helplessly, I cut the new doll’s long strands into a jagged bowl cut, insisting to her, that it looked better that way,\n\nsomething I still stand by, all these years later."
