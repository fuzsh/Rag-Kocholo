Hindus have given Jesus a place among the teachers and gods of their own religion, seeing in his life something of the wisdom and mysticism that is so central to Hinduism. Christians in India also make use of the concepts provided by Hinduism when they wish to express the meaning of Christ.Thus, in any case, Jesus is-for Hindus and Christians-a guru, a teacher of wisdom who speaks with divine authority. But for many Hindu philosophers and Christian theologians there is much more that can be said about him within theIndian framework. He can be described as an avatara, a divine descent, or linked to the Brahman, the all-encompassing Reality. This study looks at both Hindu and Christian views of Christ, starting with that of the Hindu reformer Rammohan Roy at the beginning of the nineteenth century, as well as those of the first Christian theologians of India. The views of Mahatma Gandhi and the monks of the Ramakrishna Mission are discussed, and those of influential Christian schools such as the Ashram movement and dalit theology.Five intermezzos indicate how artists in India portray Jesus Christ. ...

Famke Beumer Janssen was born in Amstelveen, Netherlands. The first name means little girl in West Frisian, the native language of the Dutch province Friesland. Besides her native Dutch, Janssen speaks English and French. She also learned German, but has not kept up with it. She has two sisters, director Antoinette Beumer and actress Marjolein Beumer. Before coming to the United States, Janssen studied economics for a year at the University of Amsterdam, calling it \"the stupidest idea I ever had.\" Janssen moved to the United States in 1984 and began her professional career as a fashion model. She signed with Elite Model Management and worked for Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel and Victoria's Secret. While with the agency, her European measurements were listed as 92-61-92, 1.8 meters tall and 36 dress size.
