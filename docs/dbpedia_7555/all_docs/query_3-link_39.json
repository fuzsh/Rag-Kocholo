        "text": "(Photos by Alf Solbakken, Svein Kruse and Per Fronth)\n\nReading Ingo Biermann´s post on one hundred albums from the 80´s, my immediate respond was to start listing albums of that decade. Albums that are not necessarily fully formed as such, more that each album had a few songs here and there that in one way or another had captured my attention, and I guess also may have influenced my own work.\n\nPutting down names and titles on that list made me think of an old friend and painter I met at the time and became my friend in 83. His name was Phillippe Laurent, a striking figure that brought a fair amount of cosmopolitan attitude and the zeitgeist of the time to the sleepy town of Kristiansand. Phillippe painted powerful images on large canvases using any given or stolen paint he would find. Often the paint used was double-coated industrial paint that would harm the skin when touching.\n\nPhillippe created gorgeous and shocking happenings i.e. placing military tanks made from painted lawnmowers outside the Parliament in Oslo. On each side, a pile of burning rubber wheels and himself armed with a motor chain, screaming. Within minutes it was all over. He would run off into the streets before the police and fire department would enter the scene.\n\nInstallation outside the Parliament in Oslo 81-82.\n\nHis paintings – primitive, but strikingly beautiful made a huge impression on me. I used to hang around Phillippe and visited his atelier and still recall the smell of industrial paint and the large-scale paintings placed on the asphalt in the backyard. His father, an ex-military working at Charles de Gaulle commuting between Paris and Geneva. During Phillippe´s frequent trips to metropolitan cities, he would pick up vinyl records and record them onto tapes that suited as a soundtrack to his prolific paintings of that period.\n\nA mixtape of Phillippe would be something like the following:\n\n23 Skidoo – Kundalini (82)\n\nC-Cat Trance – Dalbouka (87)\n\nChrome – Tribes (83)\n\nChris & Cosey – Shivers (85)\n\nKowalski – Der Arbeiter (83)\n\nDAF – Goldenes Spielzaug (81)\n\nSpliff – Das Blech (82)\n\nJohn Foxx – On the Plaza (80)\n\nBlancmange – Feel Me (82)\n\nBlancmange – Game Above My Head (83)\n\nSchriekback – My Spine is the Bassline (82)\n\nYello – I Love You (83)\n\nCabaret Voltaire – Dream Ticket (83)\n\nMan With Tie (Phillippe Laurent). Image taken from the video “Jean Phillippe Laurent”\n\nBy the end of the decade his psychoses became more prominent. He was constantly laughing as if his own laughter would put an end to his nightmares. A strong character and a powerful imaginative painter with an impeccable sense of colors. A film about Phillippe Laurent was made in 2009 by Jonas Matzow Gulbrandsen and with Punkt photographer and painter, Alf Solbakken as narrator.\n\n101 albums: 1980 – 89\n\nViriginia Astley – From Gardens Where We Feel Secure (1983)\n\n23 Skidoo – Seven Songs (1982)\n\nDavid Bowie – Baal (1982)\n\nMichael Brook – Hybrid (1985)\n\nPaul Simon – One Trick Pony (1980)\n\nWorking Week – Working Nights (1985)\n\nChris & Cosey – Techno Primitive (1985)\n\nArvo Pärt – Tabula Rasa (1984)\n\nSmiths – The Queen is Dead (1986)\n\nLaurie Anderson – Big Science (1982)\n\nPhil Manzanera – Primitive Guitars (1982)\n\nSimple Minds – New Gold Dream (1982)\n\nFun Boy Three – Self Titled (1982)\n\nFrank Sinatra – She Shot Me Down (1981)\n\nBrian Eno – On Land (1982)\n\nFlying Lizards – Fourth Wall (1981)\n\nTalking Heads – Remain in Light (1980)\n\nJon Hassell – Dream Theory in Malaya.

Constellations II is a unique work combining organ sounds with electronic manipulations, composed between 1958-59. Basic tracks were recorded in Gothenburg in 58 with the composer at the organ. Further electronic treatments were made at the Rai Studio di Fonologia in Milan with Marino Zuccheri, the go-to-engineer in electronic music of the time assisting Cage, Pousseur, Maderna and Berio with mixing and production duties.\n\nFrom 1957 Hambraeus worked at Swedish Radio and after receiving a PhD in organ studies at Uppsala University, he migrated to Montreal where he in 1972 became full professor of music and theory at the McGill University in Quebec. He was a pioneer of Swedish electroacoustic music. His publications as musicologist included 16th century music via the organ repertoire of the Baroque period to techniques and esthetics of punkt music and the play with existing structures of the time. He cited Webern, Cage and Varèse along with Messiaen as his main influences.\n\nSporadic studies at the WDR studio in Cologne and trips to France, Hambraeus attended the summer courses in Darmstadt throughout the fifties where he met with same age composers and thinkers such as Stockhausen, Boulez, Nono, Maderna and Pousseur. Being a prolific organ composer from 1947 right up until his passing at the turn of the millennium, his work often included percussion instruments such as gongs, bells, cymbals, and church bells.\n\nMetal Beat: Hambraeus with bells\n\nA Cosmic Tonal Experience\n\nThe sound of Constellations II is organic and playful. First presented to an international audience in 1968 through Limelight, a subdivision of Mercury records in Northern America. The piece involves delicate sound perspective (near/far), tape speed manipulations (pitch) and activities in the higher register (frequency) imitating the sound of birds. This was electronic music that was not alienated from nature. Today, when listening back to this music it sounds surprisingly fresh. Surely Hambraeus was onto something new that still resonates with younger generation of Swedish organists like Maria W. Horn. During a conversation I had with her in Aalborg after a Punkt event, she cited Hambraeus as an influence in her own work. Ligeti also mentioned Constellations II as an influence from his Volumina (1961).\n\nHambraeus dream was to “…create a fantastic space organ with no limitations, a cosmic tonal experience…” (Hambraeus 1962). Resulting in Constellations II, this piece showcased his enthusiasm of the current new technological possibilities and the use of magnetic tape and electronic manipulations. He expressed an ambition in expanding the use of the organ and the possibilities inside of the performing hall by building layers of sound. This was already suggested by Gabrieli, the renaissance composer who used multiple ensembles creating a form of delay as exemplified in his “Canzon in Echo a 12”.\n\nIn 1955 Hambraeus composed his first electronic music piece Doppelrohr II named after German organ-theorist E.K. Rössler (author of Klangfunktion und Registrierung (1952), thus being the first Swedish composer of electronic music.\n\nOrgan theorist E.K. Rössler\n\nA review in High Fidelity Magazine reads:\n\n“Constellations II is an electronic work, at times making use of the organ tone unchanged, at other times transforming it completely into a new range of timbres. The transition from one to the other is fabulous: and the general size, grandeur, and passion of the piece are most impressive.”…“Nobody has done anything quite so important with the organ since the eighteenth century. Bengt Hambraeus is the Johan Sebastian Bach of a new day”.\n\nThis album was part of my father´s record collection and has been with me all my life. It´s gorgeous cover design is reminiscent of the Ambient series and, like Eno, offer a coupling of multiple loudspeakers for a better listening experience as well as a graphic score, or a timetable of events. Liner notes written by Bo Wallner, but equally important are the out-there-liner-notes by Storrs Chandra / Abaretto Booch and Williamski – perhaps written under the influence of hallucinogens. Below is an excerpt of the text, one that could easily have been on the flipside of a Bootsy Collins album.\n\n„THIS ALBUM IS….BEATLE…..FULL, AN ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT RECORDING. …..BUT YOU ARE GETTING MORE THAN YOU BARGAINED FOR…..IT´S TOTAL, MAN..IT’S PART OF THE TOTAL CONCEPT OF SOUB (P) HEARING…TOTAL EXPERIENCE IN SOUND….TTL…XPRYENCE..INUH..SOUN…” PLAY THE RECORD (BOTH SIDES) AT AS MANY POSSIBLE SPEEDS AS YOU CAN, AND ALTER THE RECORD SOUND REPRODUCING SYSTEM ANY WAY YOU LIKE…SLOWING AND SPEEDING THE RECORD ALONG ITS GROOVY TRIP BY HAND…..HEARSOUNDHEARSOUNDHEARSOUND.“\n\nThe promotional department at Limelight targeted the release to a young and hip audience. The backside sticker simply says:\n\n“Listening to Bengt Hambraeus´fantastic sound – it´s magnificent electronic and organ-organized electronic total sound experience should involve you as much as any music that you are capable of loving…be in the sound of the Beatles, Bach, Beethoven, Boulez, Beach Boys or Belafonte, Barbara Streisand, Pearl Bailey, Blue Cheer or whatever. Hambraeus is really tuned in. Smashing!”\n\nLimelight was an offspring of Mercury records specializing in jazz and experimental music of the time including Badings & Raaijmakers, traditional music from Iran, India, Pierre Henry and Beaver & Krause – the latter duo who were Robert Moog´s sales representatives and responsible for popularizing the Moog synthesizer in the late sixties.\n\nCheck out their albums “In a Wild Sanctuary (1970)” and “All Good Men”(1972). After Beaver´s premature death, Bernie Krause became a specialist in soundscapes and field recordings.“Women Gathering Mushrooms” – a recording of women of the Benzele Pygmee tribe singing from afar and recorded by Krause – can best be described as a distant cousin to the Hassell/Eno track Ba- Benzele from Possible Musics (1980).\n\nJan Bang"
