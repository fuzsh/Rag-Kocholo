        "text": "25 versions of Windmills of Your Mind\n\nEver have a tune keep playing over and over in your brain?\n\nThat's 'cause...there are WINDMILLS in your mind. Really. And they respond especially well to catchy kitsch.\n\nSeemingly put together as a homework assignment for Similes 101, \"Windmills of Your Mind\" offered spooky psychedelia via the French version of Mancini, Mr. Michel Legrand, and English words supplied by middle-aged hack lyricists Alan & Marilyn Bergman. They toss snowballs down a mountain and think the world is \"like an apple whirling silently in space.\"\n\nFirst line sets our theme:\n\nROUND.\n\nThe lyrics get so numbing Jazz singer Carmen Lundy mistakenly sings of a \"clock whose hands are SLEEPING\" past the minutes of its face.\n\nThe song seems to be saying that as endless as the world is, life isn't and love isn't.\n\nActual lyric variation: you have a choice of \"when you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware that the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair,\" OR, \"when you knew that it was over in the autumn of goodbyes, for the moment you could not recall the color of his eyes.\" The latter is represented here by Ms Lefeber.\n\nYears ago, comedian Frank Fay made a living satirizing the lyrics of pop tunes like \"Tea for Two.\" It's a cruel trick. A cheap trick. So we'll surrender any further impulse to insult a song that keeps saying \"like\" over and over, and mentioning \"things that are round\" like a bad game of $25,000 Pyramid.\n\nFact is, the song's circles and spirals and wheels are kind of mesmerizing, they are \"words that jangle in your head\" (a nod to Bob's Tambourine Man perhaps). Like some Dylan tunes, notably \"Lenny Bruce,\" there are some good lines jammed against bad ones. In Bob's case, in that song, it was \"they stamped him and they labeled him, like they do with pants and shirts\" followed by the good \"he fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.\" Here, a cliche about lovers leaving footprints in the sand is followed by: \"Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?\" Not too shabby. There are also some effective and eerie images: \"Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own...\" or \"Like a door that keeps revolving in a half-forgotten dream.\" Like, you gotta like that.\n\nLike, listen for yourself. Over and over.\n\nYou get 25 different versions (five are French, known as Les Moulins de mon Coeur) including Legrand, Frida Boccara, Dorothy Ashby, Mathilde Santing, Paul Muriat, James Galway and of special interest, the top 10:\n\n1. Psychedelic and slow: Vanilla Fudge\n\n2. Eerie border colic: Baja Marimba Band\n\n3. Oliver Twists: Trinity Boys Choir\n\n4. Disco Dizziness: Sally Anne Marsh\n\n5. A gargle of goo: Jim Nabors\n\n6. Swanky swinging: Judith Lefeber\n\n7. Vintage French Fluff: Vicky Leandros\n\n8. Scat with Scuffy Grapelli-style Violin: Carmen Lundy\n\n9. Accapella Angst: The Lettermen\n\n10. How Elton Might've Done It: Jose Feliciano\n\nGo Dutch: Here's the WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND\n\nIll-Ustrated Songs #12 LAURIE/STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN - Dickey Lee\n\nHere's one of the great teen-death songs, a campfire horror tale set to music. Unusual for any Top 40 hit, this was one continuous story, evolving through three minutes to the punchline. Like any good anecdote, it was fun to re-tell, or to hear again and again.\n\nIf \"Laurie\" seems like a familiar old fashioned ghost story, it's because it is.\n\nIt's based on the folklore of \"Resurrection Mary.\" Her story seems to have originated in Chicago, around the time \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" were in movie theaters. Mary would appear to motorists, asking for a lift.\n\nThey would notice that she was wearing a rather ghostly white dress, and when she touched them, to point them down the road to where she needed to be left off, her hands felt cold. And where did she ask to be dropped off? Why in front of Resurrection Cemetery. She'd glide out of the car and...disappear.\n\nThis simple, creepy little anecdote would be one of many told late at night around the camp fireside, or as a bedtime story to scare the little kiddies.\n\nIt's similar to \"One Step Beyond\" anecdotes...like the one about the girl who is scared a maniac is on the loose. She asks her boyfriend to go outside and investigate...and he doesn't come back. She waits and waits. She listens. Then is petrified by a scratching noise at her front door. When it finally stops, she cautiously opens the door...to see her boyfriend with an ax in his head, his fingernail worn out from trying to scratch at the door for help.\n\nA variation on the \"Resurrection Mary\" story is called \"Just Beyond the Cemetery,\" (told by Boris Karloff on the Mercury record album \"Tales of the Frightened,\"). A motorist is helped by a girl who then vanishes as if she was a ghost.\n\nThe idea with horror quickies is to leave the listener momentarily shaken, if not stirred. The urban legend of ghostly Mary was submitted to the Memphis Commercial Appeal by a teenage girl, Cathie Harmon. It was read by Dr. Milton Addington, an amateur songwriter.\n\nHe knew Dickey Lee, and when Dickey was looking for a follow-up to \"Patches,\" and thinking, \"maybe we can come up with some kind of ghost story,\" Addington was inspired.\n\nIn Harmon's version, Mary appears at the Liberty Grove dance hall, and seems to enjoy a last dance with a fellow who asks to take her home. He drops her off at, yeah, Resurrection Cemetery. She walks away and vanishes. Strange, she had given him her address, but insisted on stopping at the cemetery instead! Puzzled, the next day he visits her house. A woman answers. She says the girl USED to live there, but DIED. Oooooooooh.\n\nAn irony is that a rather faithful version of this ghost story was performed by Frankie Miller for Starday. The single (credited to the trio of John Duffey, Joe Kingston and Chaw Monk) is titled \"Bringing Mary Home.\" Mac Wiseman, Smiley Bates, Red Sovine and the great Billy Edd Wheeler also performed vintage versions of the song, but most recall THIS guy, Frankie Miller:\n\n\"Bringing Mary Home\" on YouTube\n\n\"There was something strange about her. Her face was deathly white. She sat so pale and quiet there, in the back seat all alone. I never will forget that night, I took Mary home. I pulled into the driveway where she told me to go. Got out to help her from the car, and opened the door. But I could not believe my eyes, the back seat was bare. I looked all around the car but Mary wasn't there.\n\n\"A small light shone from the porch. Someone opened up the door. I asked about the little girl that I was looking for. And the lady gently smiled, and brushed a tear away.\n\n\"(spoken) She said it sure was nice of you to go out of your way. But sir, 13 years ago today, in a wreck just down the road, our darling Mary lost her life and oh, we miss her so. So thank you for your kindness, and the troubles you have shown. You're the 13th one who's been here, bringing our Mary home.\"\n\nKindly Dr. Addington included Cathie Harmon as co-writer of his version of the song, which transplants the action to a dance and then to the graveyard. Dickey Lee once mentioned that he never did actually meet Cathie. But \"Laurie?\" He said, \"Around Halloween it gets the heck play out of it...that song did cause a bit of trouble. There was a report of some kids who went out and wrote 'Laurie' on a bunch of tombstones in a cemetery.\"\n\n\"Mitt\" Addington wrote about four dozen songs. Being Memphis-based, most were C&W oriented. The closest one in fame to \"Strange Things Happen (Laurie)\" is \"The Girl I Can't Forget,\" also recorded by Dickey Lee. The Vogues recorded his song \"Five O'Clock World,\" Jerry Lee Lewis sang \"Memphis Beat\" Homer and Jethro yocked \"Charlie Cheated on His Income Tax\" (co-written with Dickey Lee and Allen Reynolds) and his co-writer Allen Reynolds tried \"Though The Eyes of Love.\"\n\nOther songs by \"Mitt\" Addington include: \"Baby No No,\" \"Burned Fingers,\" \"Car Nine,\" \"Dodo\" \"Doll House,\" \"Don't Knock What You Don't Understand,\" \"El Toro de Goro,\" \"Elmer the Elf,\" \"Five Chicks,\" \"Hide the Hurt,\" \"I Go Lonely,\" \"If It Wasn't for a Woman,\" \"Impressions,\" \"Julie Never Meant a Thing,\" \"Lollipops and Teardrops,\" \"The Long Walk from Childhood,\" \"Lovers By Night,\" \"Medicine Man,\" \"Mr. Santa Claus,\" \"Not Wisely But Too Well,\" \"Out of Sight Out of Mind,\" \"Ring Around the World,\" \"Sunday Jealous,\" \"Teach Me to Moan,\" \"Trifling Around,\" \"When Marty Throws a Party,\" \"You Can't Turn Me Off Cause You Didn't Turn Me On,\" \"You Name it She's Got It\" and \"Your Kisses.\" He was 55 when he died in 1979.\n\nDickey Lee \"told\" the story well, his adenoids at just the right level of innocence and cringe. It's hard not to sound dorky while singing the word \"sweater.\" His song's character is quite a sympathetic fool, missing obvious clues (\"an angel of a girl.\")\n\nFor what most would consider a \"cheapie\" single on an obscure label a lot of production work went into the song to help make it a hit. The arrangement is first rate, with it's tentative bits of harpsichord, it's surge of heavenly brass, and a graceful pause when the father reveals the song's punchline. From there, the production (arrangement by Ray Stevens) kicks into eerie overdrive thanks to a choir and apparently the ethereal vocalise from none other than Marni Nixon. I haven't confirmed that the anecdote is a fact, but apparently Addington and/or Lee knew Ernest Gold, the famous (\"Exodus\" among others) composer. He in turn was married at the time to Marni (their son was pop singer Andrew Gold). So Ernest may have done some un-credited production on the song and figured it needed some the ghostess-hosting of Marni to drive the tune home. Boots Randolph (sax) and Jerry Reed (guitar) were also on this historic recording. When it was completed, Lee listened to the playback and thought, \"This is cool — kinda weird.\"\n\nDickey Lipscomb (born September 21, 1936 in Memphis) had a regional hit in 1957 called \"Dream Boy\" on the Tampa label. In 1962 he ironically covered \"Tell Laura I Love Her\" on the album \"Patches\" (two death songs on one album!) He also covered \"Teen Angel.\" Looking to switch up on morbid ballads, Dickey's next top ten was \"I Saw Linda Yesterday,\" which he originally thought might be good for George Jones. After \"Linda,\" in May, 1965, \"Laurie\" peaked at #14 and led to another album...this one larded with cover-songs with girls' names in them: Nadine, Marie, Annie, Gina, etc. Dickey vanished, then reappeared on RCA with seven C&W albums (1971-76). Dickey's biggest hit was a song he wrote for George Jones: “She Thinks I Still Care.\" More recently (ok, ten years ago) he co-wrote the Tracy Byrd hit \"Keeper of the Stars.\" Dickey began touring Europe circa 1985 on the \"oldies\" circuit, doing a bunch of his hits along with a handful of other 60's artists. Who knows, once in a while one of them may have taken to the stage to cover the George Jones tune \"She Thinks I Still Care,\" which was the biggest hit Dickey has as a solo songwriter.\n\nLastly from Mr. Lee: \"My advice to any would be songwriters: If you kind of want to do it forget it or do it as a hobby. If you really want to do it you will know because outside of your family (in most cases) you will sacrifice everything it takes to hang in there. My first BMI check was for 69 cents and I cashed it because I needed the money!\"\n\nLaurie \"Strange Things Happen\" Instant Download or Listen on Line.

Stump!\n\nAll right. Same person. 90 years old.\n\nSince the illfolks blog tilts toward the odd, let's just briefly sketch some basics on the woman's MOR side. Jo Stafford was similar to Patti Page, Doris Day, or Rosemary Clooney, but less well known now because she didn't make hit movies or photogenic album covers, and retired fairly young.\n\nJo was the only female member of the annoying \"Pied Pipers,\" a quartet that backed Tommy Dorsey, Sinatra, and Johnny Mercer. They tended toward ooky crooning or way too hearty chorusing. She moved on, but kept their style, as a soloist, another reason she's not popular with the retro or lounge crowd. Her 40's music suffers from big band cliches including dated, lumbering swing beats and middle aged men backing her in the chorus. Things like \"Watcha Know Joe\" are unendurable, in the same league as thrift shop Mitch Miller albums. Novelty hits like \"Shrimp Boats\" just sink. Today's listener has to really pick and choose through a greatest hits collection or later (1960's \"Jo + Jazz\") albums to find songs that do her justice.\n\nRosemary Clooney described Jo's voice best: \"beautiful, pure, straightforward, no artifice, matchless intonation, instantly recognizable. Those things describe the woman too.\"\n\nA few times Jo took a serendipitous dippy detour from straight tunes to dopey ditties.\n\nIn 1947, Jo noticed Red Ingle rehearsing a parody of \"Temptation.\" She was so amused, she asked if she could sing it. The girl hired for the session was paid off and Jo took over, recording as \"Cinderella G. Stump.\" The song became a Top 10 hit.\n\nIn 1957, Jo had some free time left over at the recording studio and goofed around with some deliberate off-key singing. She was urged to make a comedy album, and as \"Darlene Edwards\" (with husband Paul Weston on piano as Jonathan, the pianist with two left hands) issued some \"so bad it's funny\" discs. Jo's queasy \"I Love Paris\" was a notable fracture (a song also butchered by Leona Anderson on her \"Music to Suffer By\" album). Following The Cherry Sisters and Florence Foster Jenkins, two notorious examples of strange vocalizing, the Edwards' success revived the genre and led to \"Morris\" Garner's ham-fisted lp parody of Errol Garner, and pooped pop albums from Sam Chalpin and Mrs. Miller among others. Of course guys like Homer & Jethro went out of tune deliberately for a laugh, too: \"Gimme an E flat.\" \"You know I can't play an E flat.\" \"Then gimme an E, and I'll flatten it out m'self!\"\n\nFolks who hate pop standards still chuckle at the way the duo warped 'em. Back in 1961 \"Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris\" netted a Grammy for Best Comedy Album. Ironically, Jo Stafford never won one for straight singing. The Edwards' bent take on \"Carioca\" was used in \"The Kentucky Fried Movie.\"\n\nIn 1977, the duo un-retired for a single, \"Stayin' Alive\" b/w \"I am Woman.\" Paul Weston died in 1996. He and Jo were able to get the rights back to much of their back catalog (straight and humorous) for their own Corinthian label, and re-issues serve as a legacy to the artists and income for their children.\n\nYour trio of samples highlight Jo's humor: the hillbilly song with Red Ingle, a sample of vintage Darlene, and her comeback shot at The Bee Gees.\n\nTIM-TAYSHUN Instant Download\n\nI LOVE PARIS No Pop-Ups\n\nSTAYIN' ALIVE No Porn Ads\n\nOne Less Bozo LARRY HARMON (1925-2008)\n\nJust before July 4th...Bozo departed the bus. There he is, on the right, standing with one of his Bozo clones, tempting fate. Would you believe he lived another dozen years after that photo was taken?\n\nLarry Harmon didn't originate Bozo the Clown, but when he bought the rights to the clown's image, he turned a minor kiddie character into an empire.\n\nBozo appeared in 1946 via some Capitol Records novelty tunes. The first \"Bozo\" TV show appeared on KTLA-TV in L.A. in 1959. In 1960 Harmon bought the rights to Laurel & Hardy, and soon hundreds of Bozos on local TV shows were hosting the cheap Bozo and Laurel & Hardy cartoons that Larry was making.\n\nHe proclaimed,\"Bozo is a star, an entertainer, bigger than life. People see him as Mr. Bozo, somebody you can relate to, touch and laugh with.\" Larry claimed Capitol saw his potential almost from the start, and during early negotiations, suggested he be hired to play Bozo on a TV pilot. The real creator of Bozo, Capitol's Alan W. Livingston grumbled, \"I can't believe Larry Harmon says we'd ever hire him to star in anything. Harmon is very good at marketing. He sold Bozo shows all over the country. But I suppose he never got over the fact that he's really not much of a clown.\"\n\nIn 2004, the International Clown Hall of Fame in Milwaukee took back the Lifetime of Laughter Award they gave Harmon in 1990, huffing that they'd been fooled into thinking Harmon originated the character. They put up a plaque to honor Pinto Colvig, the Capitol records voice instead. \"Isn't it a shame,\" Harmon declared, \"...like I didn't do anything for the last 52 years.\"\n\nBorn in Toledo, Ohio, on Jan. 2, 1925, the former Lawrence Weiss got into show biz after attending USC in Los Angeles, where he majored in theater and played drums in the Trojan Marching Band. And so it's fitting that the man who missed July 4th by this-much, is honored on the illfolks blog with a segment from one of his kiddie records where Bozo recites, with a marching band, the patriotic \"Marine Corps. Hymn.\" Then he joins the crowd in singing a song about the Army, too. Why not. Let's remember\n\nRed Skelton's words: \"A clown is a warrior who fights gloom.\" Harmon and his army of Bozos put up a good fight, and while that hamburger Ronald may now be the world's most famous clown, there's no harm in saying bye-bye to Harmon...not the original Bozo, but definitely a real Bozo for over fifty years. He leaves behind a wife, four daughters and a son...as well as white grease, oversized shoes and a half of a red ping-pong ball with traces of snot in it.\n\nBOZO MARCH!

That's 'cause they're sick. They also seem to have set their Casio keyboard to violin and accordion simultaneously, which will make your cat cry. Thanks guys, for the musical equivalent of an IV drip.\n\nAnna Ternheim - To Be Gone\n\nAnna's a depressed Swede who sings pretty tunes with suicidal tendencies: \"Leave the body, leave the mind...I just happen to feel so alone....I just wanna be gone.\" Her accent is thick enough to make \"body\" sound \"bawdy...\" Sad girls ARE sexy, especially when they're trying to shuck off their mortal coil via a bossa nova shuffle.\n\nLee Hazlewood & Nancy Sinatra - She Won't\n\nA twangy dirge...a portent that Lee & Nancy Volume 3 was not going to be a hit. Did they know that their album would not even get a U.S. or U.K. release?\n\nMary McCaslin and Jim Ringer - Oh Death\n\nTraditional folk music is as close to a death experience as you get in life.\n\nJerry Yester-Judy Henske - Mrs. Connor\n\nYester was briefly with The Association. Here he sings lead on a moody number with lyrics from then-wife Judy Henske: \"When death comes for Mrs. Connor, he will lay his heavy leg on her and groan.\" Necrophilia at its best. No wonder Andrew Vachss is a Henske fan.\n\nAnna Singt - Gloomy Sunday\n\nThe famous Hungarian suicide song, which did indeed lead to documented suicides, continues to be covered by new generations of depressives. Anna and coffin-sized piano.\n\nThea Gilmore - Everybody's Numb\n\nGet the zeitgeist...these days are so alarming, the next wonder drug will be a topical anesthetic you massage into the scalp. Thea has plenty more where this came from.\n\nPamela Morgan - It Ain't Funny\n\nNo, it isn't. This one's about the economic woes of fishermen...in an age when most fish is now farm-raised and bad for you.\n\nMary Gauthier - I Drink\n\nIt's almost cheating to include a country song like this, but Mary is a crossover artist. She's cross over mean men, hard times and a world of hurt. Guthrie-esque Gauthier is a balladeer for the mental dust bowl.\n\nMathilde Santing - Wonderful Life\n\nWith an opening guitar riff unwittingly referencing the start of \"Suicide is Painless,\" Santing floats in to assure us, \"no need to run and hide.\" Except this minor key ballad is as lively as a beached jellyfish. \"Don't give up,\" Kate Bush sang, but she hadn't heard this kind of optimism.\n\nEva Cassidy - Ain't No Sunshine\n\nSad songs say so much...and so does the way there's been a cottage industry mourning a pretty blonde singer who died young.\n\nBeth Nielsen Carpenter & John Hiatt - World of Hurt\n\nThe truth: \"It's a world of hurt, nothin' works. It's a lonely little planet made of dust and dirt. Who'd ever think that in the midst of this, something as beautiful as love exists?\" Yeah? For how long? See \"Hurt\" by Trent Reznor and look under \"dirt, my empire of.\"\n\nThe Magic Numbers - Which Way to Happy?\n\nSort of a gay Leonard Cohen with a wan chick singing in the background, and a vibe of being totally wilted. Nice. All too often, artists now go from total unknowns to superstars via a debut album! But are they happy? No? Good.\n\nTownes Van Zandt - Waiting Around to Die\n\nNo longer an accurate title.\n\nKendra Smith (of Big Star) - Holocaust\n\nWhy rhyme moon and June when you can open with: \"Your eyes are almost dead. Can't get out of bed...\"\n\nRandy Newman - It's a Jungle Out There\n\nAs usual, he's tap dancing on the edge, and really, if you can't find humor in impending disaster, then you might as well be Morrissey. This pungent one minute theme song is for a TV show involving a germ-phobic Arab.\n\nTo reference Jann Arden and Sheryl Crow...Happy? If it makes you happy...\n\ndownload here\n\nAnd if you just want a quickie from Mathilde Santing...\n\nWONDERFUL LIFE"
