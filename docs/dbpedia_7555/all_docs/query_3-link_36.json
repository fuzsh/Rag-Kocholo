        "text": "1986 song by Black\n\n\"Wonderful Life\"Single by Blackfrom the album Wonderful Life B-side\"Life Calls\"ReleasedSeptember 1986[1]\n\n14 August 1987 (re-release)[2]StudioPowerplant Studios, Willesden, LondonGenrePopLength4:49Label\n\nUgly Man (1986)\n\nA&M (1987)\n\nSongwriter(s)Colin VearncombeProducer(s)Dave \"Dix\" DickieBlack singles chronology\n\n\"Sweetest Smile\"\n\n(1987) \"Wonderful Life\"\n\n(1987) \"I'm Not Afraid\"\n\n(1987)\n\nMusic video on YouTube\n\n\"Wonderful Life\" is a song by British singer Black from his 1987 debut album, Wonderful Life. The song was released twice as a single and was successful the second time, becoming a top-10 hit in Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Black, who wrote the song while broke, commented: \"I was really being ironic... Most people took it at face value.\"[3]\n\nSingle release\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst released in 1986 by Ugly Man Records, it initially peaked at number 72 on the UK Singles Chart.[4] The label and Vearncombe then decided to re-release the song with a new record company, A&M Records after the success of \"Sweetest Smile\" and the single reached a higher peak of number eight on the chart in August 1987.[5]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a contemporary review in Smash Hits, Vici McDonald called it a \"wonderful record – sentimental without being slushy\". She went on: \"It's heartening to see someone who a) isn't particularly handsome, b) has a spook-name (i.e. Colin Vearncombe), c) has no discernible 'image' and d) writes slightly odd lyrics, get into the charts purely on the strength of their music, which in this case is very strong indeed.\"[6] The song was described by AllMusic as a \"seductive, bittersweet ballad\".[7] The Daily Telegraph said: \"Its oddly uplifting lyrics... combined with Black's melancholy croon created, as one critic observed, 'luxuriantly melodic pop that sounds something like a male version of Sade'.\"[8] Lesley O'Toole of Record Mirror praised the song, describing it \"a beeeautiful [sic] balmy antidote to today's 99 per cent inconsequential output. A smooth coating of non-drip vocal gloss glides over a melody which seduces you with its eyes shut... Simplicity and perfection itself\".[9]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe music video, shot in black and white, was filmed around the English seaside resort of Southport, Merseyside, as well as Wallasey near Black's hometown of Liverpool, and features New Brighton Lighthouse and promenade. The video includes the Looping Star rollercoaster, a ride at Pleasureland at the time, as well as The Galleon fairground ride, the shrimping boat, local shops and residents.[10] It was directed by Gerard de Thame, husband of television presenter Rachel de Thame, and won an award at the New York Film Festival in 1988.[11]\n\nCredits and personnel\n\n[edit]\n\nCredits are lifted from the single's liner notes and AllMusic.[12][13]\n\nStudios\n\nRecorded at Powerplant Studios (London), Square One Studio (Bury) and Pink Studio (Liverpool).\n\nPersonnel\n\nColin Vearncombe – vocals\n\nRoy Corkill – fretless bass\n\nJimmy Hughes – drums\n\nMartin Green – saxophone\n\nDave \"Dix\" Dickie – keyboards, programming\n\nThe Creamy Whirls (Tina Labrinski, Sara Lamarra), Doreen Edwards – backing vocals\n\nJimmy Sangster – fretted bass\n\nThe Sidwell Brothers – brass section\n\nFormats and track listings\n\n[edit]\n\n7-inch single\n\n\"Wonderful Life\" – 4:49\n\n\"Life Calls\" – 3:51\n\n12-inch maxi single\n\n\"Wonderful Life\" – 4:49\n\n\"Life Calls\" – 3:51\n\n\"Had Enough\" – 4:58\n\n\"All We Need Is the Money\" – 4:23\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications and sales for \"Wonderful Life\"\n\nMathilde Santing version\n\n[edit]\n\nDutch singer Mathilde Santing recorded her own cover version of \"Wonderful Life\" on her 1999 album To Others to One.
