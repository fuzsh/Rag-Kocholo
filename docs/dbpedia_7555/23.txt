The grandiosity and the warm climate of his birth ground California resound in the music of bassist Paul Berner. Before he moved to Amsterdam in 1990 he toured America with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and the Monty Alexander Trio. In The Netherlands he played with Toots Thielemans, Mathilde Santing and Hein van der Geyn. With reed player Michael Moore and Metropole Orchestra guitarists Ed Verhoeff and Peter Tiehuis he recorded the CD Back Porch. ‘The rough diamonds who worked on this country jazz album speak the same language’ (Parool).
