The lyrics of the song "Wonderful Life" by Mathilde Santing describe the singer's sense of freedom and empowerment as she goes out to sea. The imagery of the sun, dreams, and magic demonstrate a sense of possibility and optimism. The presence of gulls in the sky creates a sense of contrast, as the singer feels that it is unfair that she is able to experience this sense of joy while others may not.

As the song progresses, it becomes clear that the singer is also looking for connection and companionship. She acknowledges that she feels alone and in need of a friend who can make her happy. Despite this vulnerability, however, the refrain repeats the idea that it is a "wonderful life." This juxtaposition suggests that while the singer may be aware of life's difficulties, she is choosing to focus on the positive aspects and to be grateful for the beauty and freedom she is experiencing.
