        "text": "The Nobel Prize in Literature File:Johannes Jensen Nobel Prize.jpg\n\nNobel Prize in Literature awarded to Johannes Vilhelm Jensen, 1944Awarded for Outstanding contributions in LiteraturePresented by Swedish AcademyCountry SwedenFirst awarded 1901Official website nobelprize.org\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is an international literary prize awarded annually. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n\nBackground[]\n\nAlfred Nobel stipulated in his last will and testament that his money be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in physics, chemistry, peace, physiology or medicine, and literature.[1][2] Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last was written a little over a year before he died, and signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895.[3][4] Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31 million Swedish kronor (US$186 million in 2008), to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes.[5] Due to the level of scepticism surrounding the will it was not until April 26, 1897 that the Storting (Norwegian Parliament) approved it.[6][7] The executors of his will were Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organize the prizes.\n\nThe members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that were to award the Peace Prize were appointed shortly after the will was approved. The prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on June 7, the Swedish Academy on June 9, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on June 11.[8][9] The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[7][10][11] According to Nobel's will, the Royal Swedish Academy were to award the Prize in Literature.[11]\n\nOverview[]\n\nSince 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature (Template:Lang-sv) has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words from the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\" (original Swedish: den som inom litteraturen har producerat det utmärktaste i idealisk riktning).[12][13] Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \"Work\" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October.[14]\n\nNobel's choice of emphasis on \"idealistic\" or \"ideal\" (English translation) in his criteria for the Nobel Prize in Literature has led to recurrent controversy. In the original Swedish, the word idealisk translates as either \"idealistic\" or \"ideal\".[13] In the early twentieth century, the Nobel Committee interpreted the intent of the will strictly. For this reason, they did not award certain world-renowned authors of the time such as James Joyce, Leo Tolstoy, Marcel Proust, Henrik Ibsen, and Henry James. [15] More recently, the wording has been more liberally interpreted. Thus, the Prize is now awarded both for lasting literary merit and for evidence of consistent idealism on some significant level. In recent years, this means a kind of idealism championing human rights on a broad scale. Hence the award is now arguably more political.[13][16]\n\n\"The highlight of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm is when each Nobel Laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of His Majesty the King of Sweden. ... Under the eyes of a watching world, the Nobel Laureate receives three things: a diploma, a medal, and a document confirming the prize amount\". The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Mario Vargas Llosa for \"his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat\".\n\nControversy[]\n\nThe Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism in recent years. Some critics contend that many well-known writers have not been awarded the prize or even been nominated, whereas others contend that some well-known recipients do not deserve it. There have also been controversies involving alleged political interests relating to the nomination process and ultimate selection of some of the recent literary Laureates.[16]\n\nNomination procedure[]\n\nEach year the Swedish Academy sends out requests for nominations of candidates for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Members of the Academy, members of literature academies and societies, professors of literature and language, former Nobel literature laureates, and the presidents of writers' organizations are all allowed to nominate a candidate. However, it is not permitted to nominate oneself.[17]\n\nThousands of requests are sent out each year, and about fifty proposals are returned. These proposals must be received by the Academy by 1 February, after which they are examined by the Nobel Committee. By April, the Academy narrows the field to around twenty candidates, and by summer the list is reduced further to some five names. The subsequent months are then spent in reviewing the works of eligible candidates. In October members of the Academy vote and the candidate who receives more than half of the votes is named the Nobel Laureate in Literature. The process is similar to that of other Nobel Prizes.[18]\n\nThe prize money of the Nobel Prize has been fluctuating since its inauguration but at present stands at ten million Swedish kronor. (About 1,356,610 USD or 1,067,950 Euros.)[19] The winner also receives a gold medal and a Nobel diploma and is invited to give a lecture during \"Nobel Week\" in Stockholm; the highlight is the prize-giving ceremony and banquet on December 10.[20]\n\nPrizes[]\n\nA Literature Nobel Prize laureate earns a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[21] The amount of money awarded depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation that year.[22] If a prize is awarded to more than one laureate, the money is either split evenly among them or, for three laureates, it may be divided into a half and two quarters.[23] If a prize is awarded jointly to two or more laureates the money is split among them.[23] It is the richest literary prize in the world by a large margin.\n\nNobel Prize Medals[]\n\nThe Nobel Prize medals, minted by Myntverket[24] in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902, are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse (front side of the medal). The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833–1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design.[25][26] The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design.[27]\n\nNobel Prize Diplomas[]\n\nNobel laureates receive a Diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden. Each Diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate that receives it.[28] The Diploma contains a picture and text which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize.[28]\n\nControversies about Nobel Laureate selections[]\n\nThe Prize in Literature has a history of controversial awards and notorious snubs. Notable literati have pointed out that more indisputably major writers were ignored by the Nobel Committee than were honored by it. These include Leo Tolstoy, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Marcel Proust, Ezra Pound, Fernando Pessoa, James Joyce, Harry Mulisch, Vladimir Nabokov, Jorge Luis Borges, August Strindberg and others, often for political or extra-literary reasons.[30] Conversely, many writers whom contemporary and subsequent criticism regarded as minor, inconsequential or transitionalTemplate:Who have been the recipient of the award.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1912, the committee was characterized by an interpretation of the \"ideal direction\" stated in Nobel's will as \"a lofty and sound idealism\". This caused Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, Émile Zola and Mark Twain to be rejected.[15] Also, many believe Sweden's historic antipathy towards Russia is the reason neither Tolstoy nor Anton Chekhov was awarded the prize. During World War I and its immediate aftermath, the committee adopted a policy of neutrality, favouring writers from non-combatant countries.[15]\n\nThe academy considered Czech writer Karel Čapek's \"War With the Newts\" too offensive to the German government. He also declined to suggest some noncontroversial publication that could be cited as an example of his work, stating \"Thank you for the good will, but I have already written my doctoral dissertation\".[31] He was thus denied the prize.\n\nAccording to Swedish Academy archives studied by the newspaper Le Monde on their opening in 2008, French novelist and intellectual André Malraux was seriously considered for the prize in the 1950s. Malraux was competing with Albert Camus, but was rejected several times, especially in 1954 and 1955, \"so long as he does not come back to novel\". Thus, Camus won the prize in 1957.[32]\n\nSome attribute W. H. Auden's not being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature to errors in his translation of 1961 Peace Prize winner Dag Hammarskjöld's Vägmärken (Markings)[33] and to statements that Auden made during a Scandinavian lecture tour suggesting that Hammarskjöld was, like Auden, homosexual.[34]\n\nIn 1964 Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, but he declined it, stating that \"It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre, Nobel Prize winner. A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.\"\n\nSoviet dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the 1970 prize winner, did not attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm for fear that the U.S.S.R. would prevent his return afterwards (his works there were circulated in samizdat—clandestine form). After the Swedish government refused to honor Solzhenitsyn with a public award ceremony and lecture at its Moscow embassy, Solzhenitsyn refused the award altogether, commenting that the conditions set by the Swedes (who preferred a private ceremony) were \"an insult to the Nobel Prize itself.\" Solzhenitsyn did not accept the award, and prize money, until 10 December 1974, after he was deported from the Soviet Union.[35]\n\nIn 1974 Graham Greene, Vladimir Nabokov, and Saul Bellow were considered but rejected in favor of a joint award for Swedish authors Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson, both Nobel judges themselves, and unknown outside their home country. Bellow would win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976; neither Greene nor Nabokov was awarded the Prize.[36]\n\nArgentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was nominated for the Prize several times but, as Edwin Williamson, Borges's biographer, states, the Academy did not award it to him, most likely because of his support of certain Argentine and Chilean right-wing military dictators, including Pinochet, which, according to Tóibín's review of Williamson's Borges: A Life, had complex social and personal contexts.[37] Borges' failure to win the Nobel Prize for his support of these right-wing dictators contrasts with the Committee honoring writers who openly supported controversial left-wing dictatorships, including Joseph Stalin, in the case of Sartre and Neruda.[38][39]\n\nThe award to Italian performance artist Dario Fo in 1997 was initially considered \"rather lightweight\" by some critics, as he was seen primarily as a performer and had previously been censured by the Roman Catholic Church.[40] Salman Rushdie and Arthur Miller had been strongly favoured to receive the Prize, but the Nobel organisers were later quoted as saying that they would have been \"too predictable, too popular.\"[41]\n\nThere was also criticism of the academy's refusal to express support for Salman Rushdie in 1989, after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for Rushdie to be killed. Two members of the Academy even resigned over its refusal to support Rushdie.[42][43]\n\nThe choice of the 2004 winner, Elfriede Jelinek, was protested by a member of the Swedish Academy, Knut Ahnlund, who had not played an active role in the Academy since 1996; Ahnlund resigned, alleging that selecting Jelinek had caused \"irreparable damage\" to the reputation of the award.[42][43]\n\nThe selection of Harold Pinter for the Prize in 2005 was delayed for a couple of days, apparently due to Ahnlund's resignation, and led to renewed speculations about there being a \"political element\" in the Swedish Academy's awarding of the Prize.[16] Although Pinter was unable to give his controversial Nobel Lecture in person because of ill health, he delivered it from a television studio on video projected on screens to an audience at the Swedish Academy, in Stockholm. His comments have been the source of much commentary and debate. The issue of their \"political stance\" was also raised in response to the awards of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Orhan Pamuk and Doris Lessing in 2006 and 2007, respectively.[44]\n\nThe heavy focus on European authors, and authors from Sweden in particular, has been the subject of mounting criticism, even from major Swedish newspapers.[45] The absolute majority of the laureates have been European, with Sweden itself receiving more prizes than all of Asia. In 2008, Horace Engdahl, then the permanent secretary of the Academy, declared that \"Europe still is the center of the literary world\" and that \"the US is too isolated, too insular. They don't translate enough and don't really participate in the big dialogue of literature.\"[46] In 2009, Engdahl's replacement, Peter Englund, rejected this sentiment (\"In most language areas ... there are authors that really deserve and could get the Nobel Prize and that goes for the United States and the Americas, as well\") and acknowledged the Eurocentric nature of the award, saying that, \"I think that is a problem. We tend to relate more easily to literature written in Europe and in the European tradition.\"[47] The 2009 award to Herta Müller, previously little-known outside Germany but many times named favorite for the Nobel Prize, has re-ignited criticism that the award committee is biased and Eurocentric.[48] However, the 2010 prize was awarded to Mario Vargas Llosa, a native of Peru in South America.\n\nSee also[]\n\nNobel Prize\n\nList of Nobel laureates in Literature\n\nList of literary awards\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\n\"All Nobel Laureates in Literature\" – Index page on the official site of the Nobel Foundation.\n\n\"The Nobel Prize Award Ceremonies\" – Official hyperlinked webpage of the Nobel Foundation.\n\n\"The Nobel Prize Medal for Literature\" – Official webpage of the Nobel Foundation.\n\nGraphics: National Literature Nobel Prize shares 1901-2009 by citizenship at the time of the award and by country of birth.
