        "text": "PART ONE: GOING LONG\n\nAfter Doctor Faustus defeated me last year, I developed a low-level psychic hum, an unease around a readerly question: could I still go long? I mean Don Quixote long; the three-volume Autobiography of Mark Twain long; The Complete Poems of Heinrich Heine long (982 pages, English only, translated from the German by Hal Draper). And what about Gibbon’s Decline and Fall? What, for cryin’ out loud, about Proust? Well, it so happened I’d embarked on such an adventure in 2020 with the first volume of Rodrigo Fresán’s three-book novel (not a trilogy, but one vast Proustian novel), The Invented Part. The third volume wasn’t available then, so I skipped a couple of years in order to read the final two sections, The Dreamed Part and The Remembered Part. They more or less book-ended (hah!) my 2023 and proved to myself that I could still go long. Best of all, the three novels altogether offer a large-hearted, mind-expanding experience, full of wit and insight and passion. But how many more years will going long be possible for me? The “Mother of Muses” Dylan sings about must know. But I doubt she’ll tell me any time soon.\n\nAs for the books before, between, and after my two Fresáns, they’re listed below. I recommend all of these (the two or three I read with, ultimately, little pleasure have been dropped from the list), although among my personal “short list” are those whose titles are shown in green.\n\nCheers and Happy New Year!\n\nTITLE AUTHOR PUBLISHER YEAR ISBN GENRE FORMAT TRANSLATOR ETC.

I deny that this was due to laziness! No, it was due to an already unsteady hand that seems to have declined into a scrawl. My first few entries were unreadable to me when I went back to them. Another example of Time’s cold brutality.\n\nIn any case, here are the extracts from various books listed in Part One. Enjoy!\n\nRodrigo Fresán, The Dreamed Part:\n\nFamily as subject is one of the two pillars of the novelistic genre. The other pillar is the solitary journey. [212]\n\nThe Canadian writer Robertson Davies also invoked the Russian word—”shamanstvo”—and cmopared it “to the silk-spinning and web-casting gift of the spider: and the writer who makes use of it “must not only have something to say, some story to tell or some wisdom to impart, but he must have a characteristic way of doing it….” [309]\n\n… [W]hat Franz Kafka in his Diaries called “the essence of magic.” Something only comes and arrives if it’s called with the precise word and by the right name. Something that “does not create but summons.” Something that ceased to create when no one summoned it. [311]\n\nWriters are bonsais who dream they are oaks. [323]\n\nWhen you sleep you neither consume nor consult and don’t contribute to the growthj and perfection of your persona algorithm/robot portrait that needs to be monitored more or less periodically by databases of secruity agencies and stock exchange. And so, lat capitalism like the only economic system that never sleeps. Like sharks.” [331]\n\n[W]hen you sleep badly or don’t sleep well, it’s been proven that the brain begins to create false memories. Cryptomnesia, they call it: the paradox that the impossibility of dreaming leas you to invent yourself a dreamed life, a waking-dream past that ends. up swallowiing the nightmare of the real. [340]\n\n[Y]ou can be interesting for more years than you can be attractive. [383]\n\nNow, editorial departments were virtual, places in the air and always on the verge of crashing, you connected to via cables and antennas. And journalism was virtual too. For a while now, the fixed or to-be-fixed idea that writing was done with no hope for remuneration beyond the one-off mention and the fleeting attention. Editorial straategy where the work of the cultural editors consisted of, basically, receiving spiels and responses via email. Bombarding you as if you were a family member when Kurt Vonnegut died or when they gave Bob Dylan the Nobel (to get him to recount his enounters with both; to his bewilderment, he’d received more congratulations for thje latter’s recent award than for any of his own books or achievements). Or when, spurred on byu the global psychosis cause by so many confessional blogs and comments where nobody showed their face but just their alias (more and more of them abandoned by their onetime proud owners, rusting in the air like those ars on the side of the road, that subject of fiction versus reality (what was true and what false in stories and ovels)—oh so scandaloously new and modern for so many, and as old as humanity for hyim—became “hip.” [414]\n\nNothing mattered less to him than reality, because, in his opinion, reality was always poorly written. [444]\n\n[S]ooner or later everyone ends up an exiled king of their own childhood, driven mad by the memory of youth in a world far wider than the world of adult life, fearing that a shadow of that past will catch up to it and sacrifice it in its name and its story. [495]\n\nA book with all times at the same time, which, when seen all at once, produce an image of life that’s beautiful and surprising and deep. There;s no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no cause, no effect. Nothing but marvelous moments, where invention is the control, dreams the entropy, and memory somewhere in between, somnambulant and ambulating through what’s created while awake and what’s thought while asleep. [535]\n\nAdam Zgajewski, True Life:\n\nA Provincial Roman Town\n\nThe town swept clean by archaeologists\n\nno longer holds secrets.\n\nSince they lived exactly like us.\n\nThey gazed at the sea each evening,\n\nsipped sweet wine lazily,\n\nand dreamed the same things we do.\n\nThey knew that dreams to unfulfilled.\n\nThey had their gods, quarrelsome, preoccupied,\n\nneglectful. but there was also divinity,\n\nhidden everywhere, invisible.\n\nThey tried to catch it in paintings,\n\ninn poems and melodies, without success.\n\nThe town plan was transparent as the dawn,\n\nand the sun made its way without toruble,\n\nsummer and winter, always, daily.\n\nThey waited for barbarians, afraid,\n\nraisiing ever higher walls and towers.\n\n(But the barbarians never came.)\n\nTime’s light wagons crushed them,\n\nthe wheels ran swiftly, silently,\n\nand still run.\n\n[46]\n\nW. C. Williams, The Autobiography of William Carlos Williams\n\nThese were the years just before the great catastrophe of our letters—the appearance of T. S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land.” There was heat in us, a core and a drive that was gathering headway upon the theme of a rediscovery of a primary impetus, the elementary principle of all art, in the local conditions. Our work staggered to a halt for a moment under the blast of Eliot’s genius which gave the poem back to the academics. We did not know how to answer him. [146]\n\nAlmost no one seems to realize that this movement is straight form the Poetics, misinterpreted for over two thousand years and more. The objective is not to copy nature and never was but to imitate nature, which involved active invention, the active work of the imagination invoked by suh a person as Virginia Woolf. […] We have, above, all, for our own Occidental thought Shakespeare’s, “To hold a mirror up to nature”—as vicious a piece of bad advbie as the budding artist ever gazed upon. [241]\n\nThe Objectivist theory was this: We had had “Imagism” … which ran quickly out. That, though it had been useful in ridding the field of verbiage, had no formal necessity implicit in it. It had already dribbled off into so called “free verse” which, as we saw, was a misnomer. There is no such thing as free verse! Verse is measure of some sort. “Free verse” was without measure and needed none for its projected objectifications. Thus the poem had run down and became formally nonexistent. [264]\n\nThe little magazine is something I have always fostered; for without it, I myself would have. been early silenced. […] When it is in any way successful it is because it fills a need in someone’s mind to keep going. When it dies, someone else takes it up in some other part of the country—quite by accident—out of a desire to get the writing down on paper. I have wanted to see established some central or sectinal agency which would recognize, and where possible, support little magazines. I was wronbg. It must be a person who does it, a person, a fallible p;erson, subjerct to devotions and accidents. [266]\n\nI believe heartily what Dallas Simpson has said or quoted that: “The whole aim of the gang that runs Russia, U.S.A., Britain, and France, is to destroy the contemplative life altogether, to its last vestige, and to create ‘WORK’ until no one shall be left with time to think about anything.” [307—and aren’t we reaching the apotheosis of this aim in Social Media and the Great Con that is A.I.? Replacing contemplation with distraction and a phony “intelligence”?]\n\nThe thing isn’t to find the time for [writing]—we waste hours every day doing absolutely nothing at all—the difficulty is to atych the evasive life of the thing, to phrase the words in such a way that stereotype will yiled a moment of insight. [359]\n\nThe key, the master-key to the age was that jump from the feeling to the word itself: that which had been got down, the thing to be judged and valued accordingly. [381]\n\n“The first thing to do in hearing poems is not to try to understand them at the start at least, but to listen. The arts are sensual in their intention to impress. Let the poem come to you. Put all you have into trhying to hear the poem, hear it. Otherwise, how can you know it is a poem?” [386-387]\n\nJohn Dewey has said (I discovered it quite by chance), “The local is the only universal, upon that all art builds.” [391]\n\nRobin Robertson, A Painted Field:\n\nOyster\n\nBandage your hand\n\nagainst the bladed shell,\n\nwork the knife well into the slot\n\n(imagine a paint-scraper at a rusted rim)\n\nand prise the lid off,\n\nkeeping the juices in.\n\nRaise carefully to the chin\n\nthen bite the tongue out by the root:\n\nsuck it from its mouth of pearl\n\nand chew, never swallow.\n\nThis is not sex, remember;\n\nyou are eating the sea.\n\nLeonard D. Moore, Long Rain:\n\n[Tanka]\n\nquiet before dawn\n\nthe salty wind slipping\n\ninto the cottage\n\nher black panties drift backwards\n\non the rusty hanger\n\nfragrance of old lilacs\n\nacross the hospital lawn—\n\nwheelchair in the sun;\n\nbeyond the gravel side road\n\nthe sea rumples more and more\n\nClarice Lispector, Near to the Wild Heart\n\nSometimes, for the sheer pleasure of it, she even invented reflections: if a rock falls, the rock exists, there was a force that caused it to fall, a place from which it fell, a place where it fell, a place through which it fell—I don’t think anything has escaped the nature of the fact, except the very mystery of the fact. [85]\n\nShe could not longer deny … what? she wondered in suspense.The luminous centre of things, the confirmation underpinning everything, the harmony that existed beneath the things she didn’t understand. [90]\n\n“A certain blindness is necessary in order to see certain things. This is perhaps the mark of an artist. Any man might know more than him and safely reason, according to the truth. But those things in particular cannot be seen with the light on. In the darkness they become phosphorescent.” [110]\n\nOh, maybe she was exaggerating, maybe women’s divinity wasn’t specific, but merely resided in the fact of their existence. Yes, yes, there was the truth, they were the symbol of the thing in the thing itself. And woman was mystery in itself, she discovered. There was in all of them a quality of raw material, something that might one day define itself but which was never realized, because its real essence was “becoming.” Wasn’t it precisely through this that the past was united with the future and with all times? [133]\n\nShe learned to think at a young age because she hadn’t seen any human being up close except herself, she was awe-struck, she suffered, her pride was painful, sometimes light but almost always difficult to carry. [163]\n\nWhere does music go when it’s not playing? [164]\n\n“It’s just that everything I have can’t be given. Or taken. I myself could die of thirst in my presence. Solitude is mixed up with my essence …” [172]\n\n“[E]verything that comes to us is raw material, but there is nothing that escapes transfiguration.” [173]\n\n“The mystery explains more than the light….” [181]\n\nPattiann Rogers, Flickering:\n\nThe Perfect Lover\n\nBe brave, be skilled, the one who rappels,\n\ndraped with rings and double ropes, kicking\n\naway down the mountainside named for you.\n\nBe pale, shriven too, shrinking in a crumpled\n\nwhite linen suit beside your tea table in July\n\nunder a striped beach cabana.\n\nBring red grapes in a muslin bag\n\nwhen you come. And bring half a cow\n\nroasted, balanced on your shoulder.\n\nIn your spotless spats and vanilla suede\n\ngloves, carry sugar lace and vials of rose\n\nwater, jujubes and cherry brandy.\n\nWear right leather trousers and rattlesnake\n\narmbands. Wear a silk kimono lined\n\nwith violet velvet, appliquéd with satin willows\n\nsewn with silvewr threads.\n\nShirtless, just in off the harvest, wear wheat dust\n\nand sweat, wear grain gavel in your hair.\n\nBe fire eater. Be flame chewer. Suck smoke.\n\nSuffer. Burn. Blow frost, implacable,\n\nunmoved, a cylinder of ice buried\n\nin furry sawdust.\n\nBe bold. Before crowds, ikn a loincloth, swallow\n\nbrass swords with musk/horn handles from Asia.\n\nSquat, at the same time, in rat feces, hidden\n\namong the balcony audience, thumbing\n\nyour nose at the stage.\n\nBe embarrassed, be fumbler, be novice.\n\nBe virgin. Be slick, seasoned, oiled\n\nand patted with aphrodisiacs, smoothed\n\nin particular places with opium cream, all over\n\nwith sweet plum blossom and emerald jelly.\n\nBe Moses. Be Buddha. Be saved. Be God,\n\nBeelzebub gaping, straggly goatee, a sharp\n\ndiamond barb stuck in your navel.\n\nDisappear. Don’t exist.\n\nCome back tomorrow night. [51-52]\n\nHomero Aridjis, Self-Portrait in the Zone of Silence:\n\nCity Without Sleep\n\nIn the sky, no one sleeps.\n\n—Federico García Lorca, “City Without Sleep”\n\nNo one sleeps in the city of crime.\n\nFear creeps in under closed eyelids.\n\nAnxiety seals the lips of men\n\nhiding out in basements of silence\n\nwhile killer patrolmen make their rounds.\n\nMounted on black motorbikes, pale riders rake up and down\n\nthe unlit avenue. They carry no scythes,\n\nthey carry machine guns, pistols, and grenades.\n\nTheir mouths smack of semen, ashes, and dust. And blind butterflies.\n\nNo one sleeps in the city of man.\n\nThe streets are an open-air graveyard,\n\nthe field of loneliness where the orphans graze\n\ntheir day-to-day hunger. On the tombstones, among\n\nhowling dogs, to no music, death dances a paso doble. [115]\n\nDiscreation\n\nAnger is a brief madness\n\n—Horace\n\nAmazonia turned into the biggest bonfire in the world.\n\nThe Alps and the Andes were converted into chasms.\n\nOn the tree of life, the bird that sang the four hundred\n\nvoices of blue faded into the flames.\n\nOf all creatures, human eyes had the deepest pits.\n\nSuddenly, it was night on earth.\n\nA searing silence came over all.\n\nThe most orphaned of beings was the son of man.\n\nOld as the moon was the baby’s face.\n\nEons dissolved into instants.\n\nSomewhere, at some moment\n\na deranged Godzilla and a maddened Batman\n\npitched nuclear strikes at one another.\n\nAll of it was brief.\n\nThe Apocalypse shall be the work of man, not of God. [153]\n\nSelf-Portrait at Age Eighty\n\nI never thought I’d spend my eightieth\n\nin a year of plague and populists.\n\nBut here I am, confined to my house\n\nin Mexico City, accompanied by Betty,\n\nmy wife—all life long,\n\nand by three feral cats that came in off the street;\n\nand oh, by the Virgin of the Apocalypse’s image\n\nlit day and night on the stairway wall.\n\nAstral twins, my daughters Chloe and Eva\n\nhave turned into my spiritual mothers,\n\nand Josephine, my only grandchild, into a playful grandma.\n\nThey are in London and Brooklyn, separated from us,\n\nbehind windows, seeing and hearing\n\nthe ambulances of death pass by.\n\nParadises there are that have no country\n\nand my suns are interior suns,\n\nand love—more so than dream—\n\nis a second life,\n\nand I will live it to the last moment\n\nin the tremendous everydayness of the mystery.\n\nSurrounded by light and the warbling of birds,\n\nI live in a state of poetry,\n\nbecause for me, being and making poetry are the same.\n\nFor that I would want, in these final days,\n\nlike Titian, to depict the human body one more time.\n\nDust I shall be, but dust in love. [163]\n\nYannis Ritsos, A Broken Man in Flower:\n\nRitsos’s poem Epitaphios (1936), a lament for a young man shot dead by the police during a tobacco workers’ strike, was publicly burned by the Metaxas regime and his books banned. During the post-World War Two civil war – because he sided with the left – Ritsos was arrested and sent to prison camps. Then, in 1967, when the Papadopoulos military junta took control of the country, he was again arrested, again his books were banned, again he spent time in prison camps, before being confined to house arrest on the island of Samos. The poems in A Broken Man in Flower were written during that period of arrest.\n\nKnowledge\n\nHe grew distant, silent, sad, and strangely calm,\n\nas though he held some overwhelming secret,\n\nknowledge beyond knowledge, beyond imagining.\n\n‘What?’ we asked. ‘What is it?’ He stayed silent. Strangely calm.\n\nYou’re not worthy, he seemed to say. You never will be.\n\nWe were his friends but, yes, we turned him in.\n\nHe stood silent in the dock and strangely calm.\n\nThey questioned, cross-questioned. Not a word.\n\nThe judge was enraged. ‘Quiet!’ he bellowed;\n\nhis gavel hammered the bench, ‘Don’t listen to his silences!’\n\nThe verdict came in.\n\nOne by one, we turned our faces to the wall. [62]\n\nStones\n\nA wind blew in from nowhere. The shutters creaked.\n\nThe leaf-fall was suddenly airborne, then gone.\n\nStones were left; just stones.\n\nWhen night falls on the mountain,\n\na black door slams and locks. The key is in the well.\n\nThis is all we have, he said, stones, just stones, these stones.\n\nI’ll cut faces into them, nameless, and cut\n\nthe image of myself, fist raised above the wall. [74]\n\nHimself Alone\n\nHe sits down. He wants to find peace. It’s here.\n\nThat’s a door, he’s sure of it, and that’s a window. Good.\n\nOutside there are houses, a street, a garden. Good.\n\nA leaf falls to the garden railings and holds for a moment. Good.\n\nThese things are lost to darkness, but still exist.\n\nGet up. Light the lamp. Rinse the cup.\n\nChange the water in the birdcage.\n\nSmall movements sanctified by repetition. [132]\n\nIn Flower\n\nHe’d had enough. He wanted to scream.\n\nThere was no one to hear him. No one gave a damn.\n\nHis own voice frightened him.\n\nHe buried his voice in himself: an explosive silence.\n\nIf I explode, he thought, I’ll gather the pieces in silence\n\nand put myself back together.\n\nIf I happen to find a poppy (and perhaps a yellow lily)\n\nI’ll make them part of the pattern.\n\nAnd that’s how it is — a broken man in flower. [161]\n\nGreece\n\nVangelis never came back. The house has been locked\n\nand the shutters up for years. Dead vines, thorn-bushes, stones,\n\nthe garden patch laid waste. A broken jug.\n\nThere’s a view of the sea if you look beyond the stable.\n\nHe sold the horse but that didn’t save the day.\n\nA bay gelding with white fetlocks, I remember…\n\nA seagull shed a feather. An old woman sat in her doorway.\n\nThe feather fell at her feet. She said:\n\n‘Small moments such as that can seem a blessing.’\n\nThat man in the doorway opposite seemed lost in thought,\n\nbut he crossed himself and went to her and stooped\n\nas if to kiss her hand, or lift the feather. [183]\n\nTestament\n\nI believe in love, he said, and I believe in death.\n\nI believe in poetry, so I believe in the immortal.\n\nI write lines: I exist. I write the world: the world exists.\n\nA river flows from my fingertip. The sky is impossibly blue.\n\nThis vision is all I have and all I need.\n\nRodrigo Fresán, The Remembered Part:\n\nNo place better to bring it all together than scattershot Mexico. No place more apropos than Mexico the incomprehensible […] to wind up comprehending everything. [62]\n\n“Why can’t we all forgive each other before becoming inoffensive?” [Re: Saul Bellow]. [73]\n\nWriting and always remembering that you write to forget: extracting a given memory and putting it in writing to convince yourself that something that already happened is happening again somewhere else, corrected, invented and dreamed and remembered better. [81]\n\nHe’d always had a real problem with reality. For him, reality wasn’t life but just the opposite. [85]\n\nOne thing was certain: sooner or late—if you didn’t protect them as you should—memories wound up taking on the consistency of dreams. [101]\n\nTo say that style was the absence of style (not to mention being proud of it) was to him as idiotic as stating that justice was the absence of injustice. Because for him style was synonymous with truth, with essence: that thing that had always been and would always be there: because trends changed and passed, but true style would remain. [121]\n\nHe’d even fantasized about a multimillion-dollar prize, the Mortem Prize, which, to win, first a writer had to die. And in that way become one of those many rediscoveries that came far too late for the recipient. But thanks to which, for a while, that writer who’d been ignored while alive, would become the best dead writer of the year. [167]\n\nThe whole Canon thing was really contrived for people who didn’t read or for those who wanted to read only what was necessary to feel well-read and so they needed those training wheels on the bicycle of universality because they couldn’t pedal their own Canon and maintain the most personal of balances, no hands, at top speed and, every so often, fall and crash with a smile of pleasure and pain at the same time. [201]\n\nDo you remember the last time you read or heard the phrase “the twenty-second century”? It’s not used, it serves no purpose, it doesn’t work. The twenty-second century is the same as the twenty-first century: part of the present. We don’t have a future in the same sense that our grandparents had one. We no longer have that unattainable and solid and distant and futuristic “Tomorrow” that they enjoyed and longed for and that we even briefly touched with our fingertips during our childhood. What we have now is, merely, tomorrow, tiny tomorrow…. [271]\n\nIt was, yes, the best beginning of the worst of times … that would bring increasingly small screens and increasingly brief messages wherein orthographical errors would be allowed and been validated as a distinctive and inclusive feature of a new language! [363]\n\nThe imminent artistic maturity of Proust was already demonstrating the eloquent knowledge that “For, although our memories are entirely personal, they resemble those estates which have hidden side-gates, which often we ourselves have not discovered and have to have opened by a neighbor, so that we find ourselves arriving home from at least one direction which we had never taken before.” [395]\n\nProust actually thinking so wisely about how “Some critics now liked to regard the novel as a sort of procession of things upon the screen of a cinematograph. This comparison is absurd … the sort of literature which is content to ‘describe things,’ to provide nothing more of them than a miserable list of lines and surfaces, despite calling itself realist, is the furthest away from reality, the most impoverishing and depressing, because it unceremoniously cuts all communication between our present self and the past, the essence … it is precisely this essence that an art worthy of the the name must seek to express.” [396]\n\n“Accumulated little by little in the memory, the chain of all the obscure impressions where nothing of what we actually experienced remains, constitutes our thought, our life, reality and it is that lie which a so-called lived art would only produce, an at crude as life, without beauty…. The duty and task of a writer are those of a translator.” [Proust] [439]\n\n… The art of tsundoku, which made you buy books that you wouldn’t necessarily read, but that you just had to have. To have them there, not reading them, but so you were able to read other books in peace. [445]\n\nEach moment is the fruit of forty thousand years. [468]\n\nHe and Ella would never forgive Dalí—with the consent of Alfred Hitchcock—for that absurd and implausible and exceedingly childish oneiric sequence in Spellbound. [472]\n\nHe knows that they’re his parents because they look at him in a way that only parents look at their children: with one eye full of love and the other eye full of fear. [486]\n\nAutumn is the season of memory and the sepia of fallen leaves is its color. [495]\n\n[John Updike:] “When I set out on this trail, in the Fifties, writers were not expected to promote their books, go on the road, or sign them, none of that. You were supposed to produce the books, and that was about the extent of your responsibilities, Now producing the books is almost the beginning of your real responsibilities, which are to get out and sell it.” And Updike added: “If an artist had a set of opinions for purvey he’d be a preacher or a politician. A work of art, a work of literary art … is an attempt to make a kind of an object, with the mystery that objects have. You can look at it in one way, find another light, and see another. All of these breaches of [artists’] privacy are in danger of taking the art out of it.”\n\nAnd, yes, if you think about it, there may be no greater form of humiliation for a writer—for any artist—than finding himself obliged to explain, live and in person, as if defending a terrible crime before a court, what he does and what he did and what he hoped to do in private. [498]\n\nHe’d read that thing about how the molecules of a person—their words and even the vapors given off by their imagination—remained, in a way and forever, in the places that person had inhabited and frequented. Not like a ghost but like a kind of echo of what’d once lived there. [512]\n\nEverybody has and passes through a golden age but they’re never aware of it until it’s too late, when the shine has faded to reveal the corrosion and make apparent everything you didn’t know how to see at the time. So, better, try to be aware of it at the time and not after; knowing that the most important decisions you make are only understood as decisions and important a long time ate you make them without even realizing that you are making them. [534]\n\nReading was one of those “soft” and recreational drugs that ended up being a gateway to the “hard” and demanding drug of writing. [563]\n\nEllipsis is a figure of speech whose sound and letters come from the Greek (έλλειψη, élleipsis) and that it amounts to omitting or leaving something out of the story and yet, that absent thing is still sensed, intuited, it’s there, though it’s neither seen nor mentioned. [581]\n\nIf all of this were being written, it would be the third and final part of a third and final book. Not the revelatory conclusion of a linear trilogy advancing in a single direction through time an space. No. Rather, yes, something more reminiscent of a triptych: something that would fold in on itself with the mechanism of a divider or partition or taboret or screen. And that would overlay thoughts with actions, memories with predictions, reflexive repetition with calculated insistence. And on like that, until it achieved the beautiful and surprising grand style of the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time. [654-655]\n\nThe Love of the Last Tycoon, where first it said that thing about how “Writers aren’t people exactly: and then conceded that, if they are, “they’re a whole lot of people trying so hard to be one peson.” [702]\n\nKubrick achieved in film the most special effect of all, the one literature had been putting into practice since the dawn of time: turning the first and third perrson—character and reader—into a single person. [728]\n\nA good life is a life in which you comprehend that you have more things you want to remember than things you want to forget. [753]\n\nLars Gustaffson, A Time in Xanadu:\n\nCenturies and Minutes\n\npoem for New Years Eve 1999\n\nIt is short, and it is always laoite,\n\nall of it far too short—\n\nit doesn’t last long\n\nand the end rears up\n\nlike a graphite-colored snow-cloud\n\non the northern horizon.\n\nBut it is also wrong.\n\nTime never ends.\n\nThere is always time,\n\nbut time—what is it?\n\nWhat is time? A coiled snake\n\nthat slowly unwinds\n\nfrom the dark hole of night where it resided?\n\nA breeze through peaceul fields?\n\nThe velvet surface of water\n\nthat softly parts before the bow.\n\nClocks make no difference.\n\nIt is not the clocks, not the small sharp\n\nsounds of the balance wheel that ticks\n\nand not centuries either,\n\nnot death that comes no matter what we do.\n\nTime is presence.\n\nYesterday’s tennis ball is irrevocably\n\ngone and cannot be returned.\n\nAll that exists is a now\n\nand that now can never end.\n\nCome, new century—you cannot scare me!\n\nYou clocks, you pendulums, you banners that flutter\n\nin the wind, you waves that break,\n\nand you stubborn rain that falls—\n\nif only you could be still for a moment\n\nit would be a beginning, the second coming\n\nthat we always dreamed of. A beginning without time,\n\na beginning where everything is stillness, is peace,\n\nwhere the wind blows in rain\n\nacross light green fields where no one\n\nknows anymore the clenched fist of fear\n\nin the solar plexus, a beginning of wind and of light\n\nin a land that is not here but very close by;\n\nreal time has no cracks;\n\nreal time is whole like a still ocean.\n\nCome, new centuries. You cannot scare us. [34]\n\nDan Beachy-Quick (commentator/translator), The Thinking Root:\n\n[About and by Heraclitus]\n\nIt [the word ethos in ancient Greek] says, as Sir Thomas Browne does, channeling across the millennia something of Heraclitean wisdom, “Life is a pure flame, and we live by an invisible sun within us.” [47-48]\n\nHeraclitus sees, and so asks us to see, that the world is full of gods, and life the sacred work of being among them. [49]\n\nTime is a child playing checkers. [62]\n\nThose born wish to live and have their fates—mostly they want to go to sleep and leave behind children born to their own dooms. [63]\n\nWe all work together toward one total end, some knowingly and with undestanding, others knowing nothing at all—I think, says Heraclitus, even the sleepers are workers laboring together to bring forth the world. [64]\n\nMost of us endlessly battle the burden we spend our whole lives bearing. [65]\n\nTo hide your ignorance is best—hard work when relaxing over wine. [67]\n\n[Parmenides:] Gaze in on all that is absent but still rooted in the mind—\n\nYou won’t be cut away from being if you hold on to what is…. [103]\n\n[Empedocles:] It is proclaimed necessary, by god’s ancient decree,\n\neternal, made fast by broad oaths—\n\nwhen from fear one fails, he defiles his lovely limbs,\n\nand from that failure follows the holy oath sworn false;\n\nthen souls gain a life long-lasting, but not immortal,\n\nthree times, for endless hours, they stray from bliss’s blessing,\n\nborn into time and eery mortal form,\n\nlife changes into this painful path—\n\nfrom air tossed down to angry sea,\n\nfrom sea crushed to earth’s edge, from earth to the sun’s\n\ndawn-day blinding shine, then thrown into the whirling eddies of the air—\n\neach from the others is taken, each grown hateful to all.\n\nAnd now I am among them, too; god’s exile, wandering—\n\nall because I put my faith in Strife’s madness. [123]\n\nKnow this: all things think and have their share of mind. [128]"
