        "text": "We should stop obsession with winning Nobel Prize\n\nby Jorim Alosa\n\n“What they are doing now – and I urge them to end it shame-facedly – is to confine Chinua’s achievement space into a bunker over which hangs an unlit lamp labeled “Nobel”. Is this what the literary enterprise is about? Was it the Nobel that spurred a young writer, stung by Eurocentric portrayal of African reality, to put pen to paper and produce Things Fall Apart?\n\nThis conduct is gross disservice to Chinua Achebe and disrespectful of the life-engrossing occupation known as literature.....I find that disgusting.....Chinua is entitled to better than being escorted to his grave with that monotonous lament,” — Wole Soyinka on calls for Achebe to be awarded the Nobel Prize.\n\nWhenever I go through that Wole Soyinka quote, I substitute everywhere Chinua is mentioned with ‘Ngugi Wa Thiong’o’ and Things Fall Apart with The River Between and the statement rings just as true.\n\nLook at these two lists. List A: Leo Tolstoy, George Orwell, Chinua Achebe, Jorge Luis Borges, Henrik Ibsen. List B: Elfriede Jelinek, Hermann Hesse, Rabindranath Tagore, Knut Hamsun, Herta Muller.\n\nWhat do you notice from the two lists? We’ll come back to that later. While many Kenyans say they are sick and tired of Ngugi Wa Thiong’o not winning a Nobel Prize, frankly, I’m sick and tired of those sleepless nights hoping he does. As a matter of fact all this clamour is driven primarily by either low self esteem or plain ignorance. Just how much do these people know about the Nobel Prize, anyway? How sure are they that Ngugi is even nominated each year? The inaugural Nobel Prize committee failed to award that year’s most obvious candidate, Leo Tolstoy.\n\nShouldn’t we be spending more time on literature professors and past winners like Wole Soyinka, who have the power of nomination, urging them to forward Ngugi’s name?\n\nThese fanatics do not even know what kind of man Alfred Nobel, the awards founder, was. Or the kind of untold horrors that were caused by the work of his hands. They wouldn’t know that the awards are the product of the guilt conscience of a wealthy man out to sanitise his bloody legacy. All this without even mentioning the controversies of winners. In 1974, the prize was given to two guys (Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson) who also happened to be part of the Nobel judges. However, concentrating too much on the negatives of the prize would reek of sour grapes. It’s better to understand the objective of the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Nobel Foundation statutes define literature as “not only belles-lettres, but also other writings which, by virtue of their form and style, posses literary value.” According to Alfred Nobel’s will, the prize is meant for “the most outstanding work in an ideal direction” and the candidate should have bestowed “the greatest benefit on mankind.” Kjell Espmark, former member of the Swedish Academy and former chairman of its Nobel committee, notes that these two requirements are vague, and thus the history of the Literature Prize has been “a series of attempts to interpret an imprecisely worded will.” From 1901 to 1912, the. Academy’s secretary, Carl David, interpreted Nobel’s “ideal” as “a lofty and sound idealism.” In the First World War era, the criteria changed and attention was given to writers from countries neutral in the conflict. The prize has continued to metamorphose with each era, until 1980s when the then secretary Lars Gyllensten declared that attention to non-European writers was growing in the Academy. Subsequently, winners like Wole Soyinka emerged in 1986, and another African, Naguib Mahfouz, followed two years later.\n\nThat brief Nobel Prize history is important if one is to appreciate why some have won and others haven’t. There was a time I used to think the Nobel Prize for Literature was an indication of a generation’s best writer. However, I’ve since learnt that the Academy doesn’t necessarily pick the best writer but rather the best vis-sa-vis its own requirements. We should fight this temptation of holding up some awards as the standard by which we measure our own before they qualify as heroes. We should stand with the same zeal and air that we did for Nelson Mandela. Mandela’s Nobel Peace Prize mattered and made him a hero only to those Western countries that had branded him a terrorist. To Africans, he was always a hero.Then there’s the issue of the two lists; the first list contained iconic literary names while the second one had barely recognisable names. None of those in the first list ever won a Nobel Prize while those in the second list are all laureates.\n\nJorim Alosa is a budding writer based in Nairobi\n\n***\n\nWhy Kenyans are craving consistency\n\nby George Mathenge\n\nCertainly, Education Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiangi deserves a pat on the back for a job well done. This country needs such public servants. Our education system has failed to match hard work with academic results. Results are mismatched with mental ability. Learners have been exposed to a ‘sit back, relax’ system that has instilled in them a culture of laziness. This has created a paradox on the Kenyan job market where employers are constantly looking for employees and jobless people looking for jobs. There are no workers, rather what we have are employees who just pass time at their place of work.\n\nThe education system is craving for consistency. Careers that have in the past been a preserve of the best brains need not be diluted. Let’s have few lawyers, doctors or engineers as products of a brilliant education system.\n\nWe need to strengthen technical colleges. We must stop commercialising higher education. We have to clear the ill mentality that you have to attain a university degree to be successful in life. Discipline and hard work is the way to success.\n\nDr Matiang’i should also audit private universities’ admission processes. KNEC should also be involved in the internal examinations of all our institutions.\n\nThe writer is the principal, Brookhurst International Schoo\n\n***\n\nTeachers can arrest poor performance\n\nby Ndege Maosa\n\nLast year’s KSCE results sent shockwaves around the country. The number of straight As plummeted from a high of 2,636 the previous year to a low of 141. Worryingly, students scoring Es shot up considerably from 5,350 in 2015 to 33,399 last year. 112,135 scored Ds while 149,929 posted D-. This is a lot whose future is bleak as they are precluded from joining institutions of higher learning. To arrest poor performance in national examinations, we need to start somewhere. Currently, all subjects in our schools are taught and examined in the English language, save for Kiswahili. Learners whose grasp of the English language is feeble are unlikely to comprehend concepts taught in the other subjects. Teachers of English face the daunting challenge of raising learners’ comprehension levels. It is over to you Mr. Vivere Nandiemo and team.\n\nThe writer is a banker based in Nanyuki.

It calls forth from people an intrinsic reverence for life and passionate love of learning. It is concerned with the development of every person’s intellectual, emotional, social, physical, artistic, creative and spiritual potentials. Not all these aspects of growth are examined in our national exams. That is why a student who is incompetent in stand-up comedy but competent in chemistry will end up thinking she or he is useless. Our teaching is skewed towards examinations. Students have been made to believe that the ultimate goal of learning is examinations and grade A and B. This is where the rain started beating us. There is more to learning than scoring A.\n\nMoreover, love of learning is lacking in most students. What comes out of this is failing grades and cheating. When students fail, they may blame teachers, parents and even the examiner. To curb cheating and failure in exams, values such as integrity, hard work, empathy and love should be taught and lived. Disciplines such as humanities and literature enlarge our capacities for empathy. For instance, in Bertolt Brecht’s The Caucasian Chalk Circle, we meet Grusha Vashnadze, a servant of Governor George Abashwili, who rescues Michael, Governor’s son, from the Ironshirts, after the execution of the Governor in a mutiny and after his wife, Natella Abashwili, is whisked away by the soldiers, leaving her son behind.\n\nStudents should appreciate literary works and live the values they endorse. Teacher should equip them with critical and analytical skills to interpret, analyse and evaluate the works. This will go a long way in stamping out cheating in exams. Physical education lessons should not be used to solve maths problems. Pastoral programmes should not be dispensed with. Guidance and counselling should play its role. Clubs, societies and movements should be reinforced. This can in turn motivate them to work hard and excel in studies.\n\nThe writer is a teacher of English and literature at Kabaa High School in Machakos County\n\n***\n\nFuture of literature lies in extensive reading\n\nby Nobert Oluoch Ndisio\n\nWriter Collins Odhiambo’s insistence that change in our education system has to yield results (Saturday Nation, December 31, 2016) called two things to my mind. First, it reminded me that the contribution of teachers to the curriculum review discourse has not been as robust as it ought to be. Save for teachers’ unions and a teachers, there has been a lull from teachers. In fact, the last time literature teachers expressed an opinion on the curriculum review, they had just one wish — that the integrated syllabus be done away with and the two subjects English and literature be separated.\n\nThe other thing that crossed my mind is the thread of the conversations I have had with an elderly educationist friend. He always asks me how come he has read more literary works than me. In Form Two, he had already read some of the books we only met for the first time at university. In his days, literature was independent of English.\n\nWhether or not teachers are right in their insinuation that the biggest problem that ails literature is the integrated English-literature syllabus remains open to debate.\n\nWhen the time comes for the development of instruction materials, publishers must offer learners text books that will give them an entirely new experience. I know just how different the text books will be from the ones we currently have in our classrooms. When it comes to English and literature, learners should not be exposed to text books that have the same kind of comprehension passages we currently have but real literary excerpts.\n\nWhen, thanks to the new curriculum, continuous assessment tests replace summative examinations, teachers will not have any reason to peg a premium on intensive reading at the expense of extensive reading. When this happens, there will be significant improvement in learners’ expressive capacity.\n\nThe more the learners will be exposed to works of literature, the more accurate they will get in their engagement with texts. This is the right time to put speech in its rightful place in our education system. We must offer learners an opportunity to appreciate the art of speech. This will in turn mould learners into citizens who appreciate language as an important instrument of power that can be used to spur cohesion, and not division.\n\nFinally, extensive reading will make all of us appear refined and intelligent. So you see, all we have to do is to ensure the space of extensive reading is not infringed.\n\nThe writer is a primary school teacher and author in Migori County. [email protected]"
