        "text": "The Speaker's opening speech\n\nHonourable Nobel Peace Prize Laureates,\n\nMinister,\n\nMembers of Parliament,\n\nYour Excellencies,\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIt is a great honour for me to welcome this year's Nobel Peace Prize Laureates:\n\nAles Bialiatski – represented by Alena Laptsionak,\n\nMemorial – represented by Yan Zbignevich Rachinskii,\n\nCenter for Civil Liberties - represented by Sasha Romantsova.\n\nA warm welcome to the Swedish Parliament!\n\nI would also like to welcome Alieksei Kolchyn from Viasna Human Rights Center and Elena Zhemkova and Tanya Smith from Memorial.\n\nAccording to the will of Dr Alfred Nobel, the Nobel Prize is awarded to those who have “conferred the greatest benefit to humankind”. Regarding the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022, this could not be more true.\n\nThis year´s Nobel Peace Prize puts not only peace, human rights and democracy in the spotlight, but also highlights the importance of civil society and civil courage – necessary for peaceful and prosperous development in any society.\n\nThe laureates represent civil society in their respective home countries, and the Swedish Parliament acknowledges that they are awarded for their work on human rights, democracy and peaceful coexistence in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThis is a part of the world, and of our neighbourhood, in which the people of one country are most regrettably fighting a war against a cruel and illegal aggressor, and in which people of all three countries are carrying on a fight for democracy, human rights and a future in peace under the rule of law – a struggle most strongly supported by the Swedish people.\n\nThe laureates embody the words of the former UN Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjöld: Speaking truth to power – Never, for the sake of peace and quiet, deny your own experience or convictions.\n\nIn fact, people and organisations in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, such as our distinguished laureates, are taking on a huge task, as they strive for peace, democracy and human rights.\n\nThey are, through sacrifices, commitment and hard work, contributing not only to taking their own countries forward. They are also contributing to a future for all of us, brighter than today. Their humanity is a beacon of light shining upon that path.\n\nNevertheless, there are people among us who do not recognise the crucialness of this struggle. There are people who do not want to see peace – nor democracy. That is why your work is so important.\n\nIn the words of the Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson, from his epic poem Aniara:\n\nThere is protection from near everything,\n\nfrom fire and damage by storm and frost,\n\noh, add whichever blows may come to mind.\n\nBut there is no protection from mankind.\n\nNo, there is no protection from ourselves if we do not stand up – every one of us – to form a shield of light to defend humanity.\n\nOn behalf of the Swedish Parliament, I would like to thank you for your efforts and your sacrifices for a greater and common good – for being that shield.\n\nIt is a privilege for me and for the Parliament to host a seminar on such a crucial topic – a topic that has strong support in this parliament, in our society and among our civil society organisations.\n\nFriends,\n\nI have spoken about light and I believe nothing could be more suitable here and now.\n\nIn Sweden, on precisely this day, we are celebrating Lucia. It is a tradition devoted to bringing light in a dark time, as we know December to be on these latitudes. And just as the Lucia Day brings light and hope, so does your work.\n\nWith these words I would like to give the floor to the moderator, Cecilia Ruthström-Ruin, Ambassador for Human Rights at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThank you."
