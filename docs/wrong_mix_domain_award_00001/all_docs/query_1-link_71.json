Jay Butler, head coach of women's basketball, spoke on \"The New Athletics at Columbia.\" It was very upbeat and engendered a lively discussion with the audience. Vincent King, AIA, offered a critique of \"New Trends in Architecture.\" It was interesting and embellished only as Vince can do. Professor William Hance presented \"Geology of the Mediterranean Region\" with picturesque slides and humorous anecdotes. David Mautner's \"The Crisis in the Airline Industry\" drew on his long experience as a commercial pilot.\n\n39\n\nRalph Staiger\n\n701 Dallam Road\n\nNewark, Del. 19711\n\nrstaiger@brahms.udel.edu 40\n\nSeth Neugroschl\n\n1349 Lexington Avenue\n\nNew York, N.Y. 10028\n\nsn23@columbia.edu 41\n\nStanley H.
