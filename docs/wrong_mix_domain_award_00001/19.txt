On 27 November 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will and testament, giving the largest share of his fortune to a series of prizes, the Nobel Prizes. As described in Nobel’s will one part was dedicated to “the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction”. Learn more about the Nobel Prize in Literature from 1901 to 2023.

Number of Nobel Prizes in Literature

116 Nobel Prizes in Literature have been awarded since 1901. It was not awarded on seven occasions: in 1914, 1918, 1935, 1940, 1941, 1942, and 1943.

Why were the literature prizes not awarded in those years? In the statutes of the Nobel Foundation it says: “If none of the works under consideration is found to be of the importance indicated in the first paragraph, the prize money shall be reserved until the following year. If, even then, the prize cannot be awarded, the amount shall be added to the Foundation’s restricted funds.” During World War I and II, fewer Nobel Prizes were awarded.

Shared Nobel Prizes in Literature

The Nobel Prize in Literature has been shared between two individuals on four occasions only. Sharing the Nobel Prize is a more common phenomenon within the other Nobel Prize categories.

1904 – Frédéric Mistral, José Echegaray

1917 – Karl Gjellerup, Henrik Pontoppidan

1966 – Shmuel Agnon, Nelly Sachs

1974 – Eyvind Johnson, Harry Martinson

Why is the literature prize so seldom divided? The last time was in 1974.

It probably belongs to the nature of literature. The science prizes are often awarded jointly, as the achievement is jointly, or for doing things that are very close to each other.

(Answer from Peter Englund, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, June 2009-May 2015)

Posthumous Nobel Prizes in Literature

In 1931, the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded posthumously to Erik Axel Karlfeldt. From 1974, the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation stipulate that a Nobel Prize cannot be awarded posthumously, unless death has occurred after the announcement of the Nobel Prize. Dag Hammarskjöld was also awarded a posthumous prize, the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961.

Awarded members of the Swedish Academy

One particular problem faced during the nomination and selection process for the Nobel Prize in Literature is how to deal with candidates who are members of the Swedish Academy, the Nobel Prize awarding institution responsible for selecting Nobel Prize laureates in literature. All Swedish Nobel Prize laureates in literature before 2011, when Tomas Tranströmer was awarded, were members of the Swedish Academy. In virtually every case it appears that they have declined nomination and a routine has been established, were they are not subjected to the appraisal of either an expert or the Nobel Committee for Literature.

Awarded for a particular literary work

While the Nobel Prize in Literature is for a writer’s life work, there are nine literature laureates for whom the Swedish Academy singled out a specific work for particular recognition.

Mikhail Sholokhov in 1965

“for the artistic power and integrity with which, in his epic of the Don, he has given expression to a historic phase in the life of the Russian people” Ernest Hemingway in 1954

“for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in The Old Man and the Sea, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style” Roger Martin Du Gard in 1937

“for the artistic power and truth with which he has depicted human conflict as well as some fundamental aspects of contemporary life in his novel-cycle Les Thibault” John Galsworthy in 1932

“for his distinguished art of narration which takes its highest form in The Forsyte Saga” Thomas Mann in 1929

“principally for his great novel, Buddenbrooks, which has won steadily increased recognition as one of the classic works of contemporary literature” Wladyslaw Reymont in 1924

“for his great national epic, The Peasants” Knut Hamsun in 1920

“for his monumental work, Growth of the Soil” Carl Spitteler in 1919

“in special appreciation of his epic, Olympian Spring” Theodor Mommsen in 1902

“the greatest living master of the art of historical writing, with special reference to his monumental work, A history of Rome”

Who did the Nobel Prize laureates in literature nominate?

The Swedish author August Strindberg (1849-1912) was nominated once in 1911 by Nathan Söderblom (but the nomination arrived too late and was retrieved).

The Austrian neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was nominated for 12 years for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In 1929, the Nobel Committee for Medicine engaged an expert who came to the conclusion that a further investigation in Freud was not necessary, since Freud’s work was of no proven scientific value. What is less known, perhaps, is that Romain Rolland, Nobel Prize laureate in literature 1915, and an acquaintance of Freud, nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1936.

The Nobel Prize amount

Alfred Nobel left most of his estate, more than SEK 31 million (today approximately SEK 1,702 million) to be converted into a fund and invested in “safe securities.” The income from the investments was to be “distributed annually in the form of prizes to those who during the preceding year have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”

The Nobel Prize amount for 2023 was set at Swedish kronor (SEK) 11.0 million per full Nobel Prize.

*Why are the individuals and organisations awarded a Nobel Prize called Nobel Prize laureates?

The word “laureate” refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo is represented wearing a laurel wreath on his head. A laurel wreath is a circular crown made of branches and leaves of the bay laurel (in Latin: Laurus nobilis). In Ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honour – both in athletic competitions and in poetic meets.
