My jaw literally dropped when I saw the front cover of yesterday’s The New Paper. Jamie Yeo’s attached with a hot hunk, and Glenn Ong is together with Jean Danker. I was like, “What?! That was fast!”

Okay, I don’t believe that one could fall in love so quickly after a break-up unless it’s a rebound. But I may not know the true picture in this case.

Glenn Ong mentioned that he likes Jean Danker because she is traditional, which Jamie Yeo’s “an ang moh trapped in a Chinese body”. That’s makes me ponder what kind of person I am.

Well, I used to be the so-called “ang moh” because I will go after the guy I like. But now, I guess I’ve kind of leave it to God. The little “ang moh” stays inside of me–I will still confess my feelings when I like someone; I will not hide. I will still try my means to get close but I draw my boundaries. Just like my “relationship” with him. I will still tell him I missed him but I will never ask him out again. Maybe because twice bitten, thrice shy. I prefer carrying the passive role in the relationship if I can (I don’t like to make decisions, if I can.. tired of doing it!), I will never propose to a guy (no way!) and over my dead body will I go for match-making (even if I’m going to stay single my entire life).

Yup, that’s me… both the “ang moh” and the traditionalist.

This was from his Facebook.

RULE: Once you’ve been tagged you are supposed to write a note with 25 random things, facts, habits or goals about you. At the end, choose 25 people to be tagged. You have to tag the person who tagged you. If I tagged you it’s because I want to know more about you.

To do this, go to “Notes” under tabs on your profile page, paste these instructions in the body of the note, type your 25 random things, tag 25 people (in the right hand corner of the app then click publish..)
