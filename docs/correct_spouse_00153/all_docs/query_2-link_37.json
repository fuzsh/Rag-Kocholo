        "text": "Over the years, we’ve seen celebrity couples come and go and while celebrity breakups seem to be the norm rather than the exception, there are still a handful of them we can’t seem to get over.\n\nHere are 10 Singaporean celebrity couples we always thought were endgame but that just didn’t work out. Pass the popcorn.\n\n1. Rosalyn Lee & Justin Vanderstraaten\n\nMany of us shed a tear (or two) when news broke that DJ Rosalyn Lee and Justin Vanderstraaten were splitting back in 2015. The unorthodox pair received harsh criticism from the public regarding their 12 year age gap, but that didn’t seem to faze them whatsoever.\n\nThey flaunted their love on Instagram and even got matching tattoos (talk about commitment), but as they say, all good things must come to an end. After 2 years, the duo decided to end their relationship, and like many others before it, insecurity came between them.\n\n2. Michelle Chia and Shaun Chen\n\nAfter 6 long years of dating, Michelle Chia and Shaun Chen finally registered their marriage in 2008. Their wedding ceremony was televised and we all witnessed two very attractive people being brought together in holy matrimony. Unfortunately, their marriage was short-lived and citing personality and lifestyle differences, the couple divorced in 2012.\n\n3. Allan Wu and Wong Li-Lin\n\nThis also very good-looking couple were together for 2 years before they tied the knot in Los Angeles–Allan’s hometown–in December 2003. Fast forward 9 years, they have 2 kids, moved to Shanghai, ended their marriage in 2016 and then moved back here to Singapore. The reason for their split remains unknown as the couple would rather keep it private.\n\n4. Naomi Neo and JianHao Tan\n\nPreviously known as #NaoHao, these YouTubers called it quits in 2015 after being together for 1.5 years. Naomi confessed to dating someone else while still in a relationship with Jian Hao because he just wasn’t giving her enough attention.\n\nUltimately, work got in the way and the two decided to go their separate ways. We’re still trying to get used to not seeing this cute couple on each other’s YouTube channels.\n\n5. Nicole Choo & Ridwan Azman\n\nJust as Dee Kosh had predicted, this pair ended things in January this year. Hands down the most dramatic breakup of all time, the two dated since 2015 and over time, their relationship grew abusive—both mentally and physically.\n\nThings started to get really blown out of proportion when they took to social media to voice their anger. What ever happened to not airing your dirty laundry in public?\n\n6. Jaime Teo & Daniel Ong\n\nAfter 9 years together, former Miss Singapore Universe, Jaime Teo, and ex-radio DJ, Daniel Ong, decided to dissolve their marriage in 2016.\n\nThey both still work together on their business venture, Twelve Cupcakes, and have a daughter they co-parent. We said goodbye with heavy hearts but are glad they can put their issues aside for their daughter’s sake. Now, that’s what you call an amicable split.\n\n7. Jamie Yeo & Glenn Ong\n\nDated in 2001, married in 2004, divorced in 2009. For a long time, Glenn bore the brunt of the blame for the breakup, until Jamie revealed in an interview in 2015 that she was the cause of it. Both have since moved on and married other people, but it’s hard for us to forget that these two were once lovebirds.\n\n8. Vernetta Lopez & Mark Richmond\n\nHere’s a real #tbt – DJs Vernetta Lopez and Mark Richmond were once in love and married. After 9 years together, this power couple annulled their marriage in 2003.\n\nVernetta recently published a book titled ‘Memoirs Of A DJ’, and in it she writes about how Mark cheated on her, as well as the events that followed after. Let’s just say current relationship status? Divorced and pissed off.\n\n9. Bobby Tonelli & Joanne Peh\n\nRadio DJ Bobby Tonelli and actress Joanne Peh ended their 4 year relationship in 2013. It seemed like a match made in heaven, but as it turns out, Joanne felt they were both on different pages and had different goals in life. Poor Bobby, our hearts are with him.\n\n10. Benjamin Kheng & Sandra Riley Tang\n\nThough they’ve never spoken publicly about this, something definitely went on and fizzled out between these two in the past. Subtle hints from photos on social media, however, show that the two members of The Sam Willows are no longer together. The flawless pair who got us swooning over their good looks and even better vocals still work together… Awkward much?\n\nFret Not!\n\nWith every one of these breakups, our faith in love has wavered a little and our hearts were left a little more broken than before. Love is a risk and it can be unpredictable—one moment you’re in love, the next, who knows? That’s just the way love works.\n\nWhile we can’t make ourselves completely invulnerable to heartbreak, there are actually small ways we can protect ourselves. In time for Valentine’s Day and for hearts potentially breaking all over Singapore on this “special” occasion, Insurance Market has designed a totally unique Broken Heart Insurance to insure against a broken heart.\n\nBasically, you insure yourselves in the lead up to Valentine’s Day (from now till 13th Feb) and on Valentine’s Day itself, in the event of a heartbreak, you file a claim by submitting your heartbreak story. As a small consolation to a really crappy situation, you stand to receive two movie tickets. A sweet and definitely unusual gesture by the new fully online insurance brokerage, Insurance Market."
