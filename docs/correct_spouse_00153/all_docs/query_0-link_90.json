        "text": "I've been following the ongoing controversy involving the legality of organ donation with much interest due partly to the fact that I have renal agenesis. It's nothing serious. It just means I was born with a single kidney. The condition is actually quite common as it occurs in one out of 750 people. And even though there are no serious or fatal long-term problems for people with one kidney, I can't help but empathize greatly with those who are in a situation where they need a kidney or an organ transplant because theirs isn't working anymore. Obviously, my empathy arises from the fact that I'm in a rather precarious situation because unlike \"normal\" people, I don't have another kidney to fall back on in case one fails.\n\nLook, I understand all the fuss surrounding the trading of organs and how you need to have strict ethical guidelines such as, donations can only be made by family or spouses, and you can't just simply buy one from someone off the streets who's willing to make some cash. The strict laws are in place to discourage the illegal trading of organs. If organs can be so easily bought and sold, who's to know that the organ sold belongs to a donor/seller who actually gave their consent? We've all heard horror stories of people who have gotten kidnapped, then murdered for their organs. Well folks, these stories are true unfortunately.\n\nBut see, human beings are depraved. Give them a set of rules and they'll soon find a way to break them. As the saying goes, there will always be a few bad eggs. Illegal trading is going to happen anyway with or without strict guidelines. But of course, I do recognise that if there ARE stringent laws in place, it might happen less frequently.\n\nThen again, as with every other situation in life, it is much easier passing judgment from afar when it doesn't concern you in any way.\n\nThe stats are grim. Kidney-failure patients here in Singapore wait an average of nine long years for a kidney if they don't have matching family donors. Healthy people will never ever understand the amount of fear, uncertainty and desperation people in dire life-or-death circumstances face. We think we do but we don't.\n\nI'm not here with answers today because I'm aware that it is somewhat of a pandora's box we're dealing with. I think the safest bet is to view this with as much compassion as we can muster and to realize that not everything in this world is black and white. Sometimes we have to take on each situation individually and not apply the same set of ethics and rules all the time. It's like a teacher dealing with her students. You can't apply the same tuition, encouragement and attention to all of them because they all come from different backgrounds, environments, etc.\n\nWhat I can say for sure though, is if I were to be in a situation where I needed an organ transplant to live, you can be sure I'd be doing anything and everything I can to get hold of a willing donor, stranger or family, man or woman, whatever. As long as there's consent, money and everything isn't going to be a problem. I'm sorry. I don't want to die."
