        "text": "Another National Day, another song, another chance for you to marvel at our “dropkick-yo-in-the-face” Ministry of Defence. I love it. August 9th is pretty darn amazing. Singapore isn’t/ wasn’t perfect but I think we can be grateful for safety, world class public transport and a fairly good education system (I have a lot of thoughts on this but overall I got a good education that I wish could have been given to other kids more deserving and hungrier than I was).\n\nOn that note, I’ve compiled a list of 50 things you might recognize from having grown up as a local in Singapore, especially in the 90-2000s. I was pretty bummed when I found out that there were already some things like these floating around (and they had some of my stuff!) but all I can say is, heck, we ARE talking about the SAME childhood on the SAME 714.3 km² island, so just laugh twice. I write mostly from a Chinese, private school perspective, so some of these things might be hard to relate to, or perhaps I have missed out on something. But know that none of this is meant to offend, I say these things with all the love and affection and sass in my heart.\n\n*All images are linked to their original source, I take credit for none of them because I am a lazy bum.\n\n1) FBT shorts may be Thai but they are also the unofficial national shorts of all teenagers in Singapore. And truly, they’re cheap, durable and so dang comfortable.\n\nooh, colours!\n\n2) You felt the horrific pinch of $0.45 (or $0.35 for a non-AC bus) to potentially $1.50 or more on Public Transport.\n\nIn 2027, Alice Goh will experience a real first world problem\n\n3) At one point in your life, you probably were part of Flag Day Mafia.\n\nIt’s just a time in my life that I don’t like to talk about\n\n4) Heeren. Neoprints, pick and mix, HMV, 77th street, do kids still hang out there?\n\nHeeren or was it Far East had two 77th Street stores in the building. You know, just in case you forgot to buy your coloured shoelaces on the 3rd floor, you could buy it on the 5th.\n\n5) The MRT has some pretty exotic Malay names. But let’s face it, you (unfortunately) know next to nothing about how they got their names. Except for Bukit Merah.\n\nThe Kris, ancient Singaporean’s weapon of choice.\n\n6) Heritage tours ensured that 50% of Kampong Glam’s perfume industry was kept afloat by the Singapore student body.\n\nThat kid in the center is stressed out by the tour guide’s hard sell of the perfumes.\n\n7) Your tween hoarder self also bought a useless peacock feather that was half dead by the time you came back from Little India’s tour.\n\n8) Project work did as much good for your creativity as the BCG did for your health.\n\nBusywork is synonymous with pain.\n\n9) 一个风和日丽的一天／早晨. Duh.\n\nThe day was so good till 小明 不小心地把 Kopitiam set on fire了. #kenasai\n\n10) You’re almost 30 but the ACES day workout’s toilet-flush move still makes you chuckle.\n\nI can’t find the original one with the lady who tells you she likes your smile.\n\n11) Homework friends included Gopal, Siti, Ahmad, Limei, Bala and freaking Cheryl who couldn’t just tell you when her birthday was.\n\nBecause Cheryl made it so complicated, Gopal, Siti, Ahmad, Limei, Bala were like “forget you”, so she made friends with weirdo friends who philosophized her birth date. #whatislife\n\n12) Forget the live bacteria and the overkilling your digestion system, you probably drank more than the prescribed one Yakult a day because it was so tasty.\n\n13) But it was ok because you stopped at two– other than the Grape and Green Apple Yakult, none of the other flavours really buzzed your tastebuds.\n\nLike an old boyband, only two really get attention while the rest are backup.\n\n14) Unless your class was super enthu, it was still a lot easier to wear your uniform on racial harmony day.\n\nThis class is so racially harmonious.\n\n15) Friendster beat Facebook and LinkedIn by having you write testimonials (or “testis”, no joke) for your friends.\n\ngive mi a testi too. thnx in adv, c u!\n\n16) At some point you hung a bagged drink on a doorknob, a railing, park bench or wherever you could. You probably forgot about it once or twice too. Singapore, forever testing your intelligence.\n\nCups are overrated. Hang it like a hipster.\n\n17) While people elsewhere were trying to figure out how to efficiently fill 100 balloons at once, Singapore students are/ were nifty and use(d) those same plastic bags to make water bombs. Easy fill, easy tie.\n\nFor all your orientation/ leadership/ team camp needs. **revising this in 2017, I’m in a ball thinking about just how much plastic was wasted\n\n18) THE PYRAMID GAME. OMG, REMEMBER THE PYRAMID GAME??\n\nCheryl’s friends.\n\n19) Foolscap paper. People always needed some from you and it was lame because somehow it would happen when you bought the expensive school letterhead kind too.\n\nThis chick is too rich, she put foolscap letterhead in her rough paper pile??\n\n20) You FOR SURE did CIP on the East Coast beach because uhhh, easiest lah.\n\n一个风和日丽的早晨\n\n21) Hydroponic farm excursions 😀 😀 😀\n\nLook Ma, no soil.\n\n22) Darryl David!\n\nNow THAT’s racial harmony.\n\n23) You always needed more exercise books than the prescribed 4 on the booklist, it was mostly for math. Sometimes, teachers got anal and made you buy the ones with school letterhead -.-\n\n24) You memorised the 手册 to get your A because you were absolute crap at the reading comprehension.\n\nExcept for this bugger who puts us all to shame. 3 points for one line, smart sia.\n\n25) UNSW tests didn’t do for you what your math teachers said it would. Schools couldn’t care less if you got a high distinction. At least we got to pay for it with our GIRO.\n\nThey’re probably going to Cheryl’s birthday party after this.\n\n26) Once upon a time Jamie Yeo was so wittle and Tammy Tay in “Growing Up” before you followed her radio segment on 98.7.\n\nLook at how cute she is on the far left!\n\n27) Once upon a time, Jean Danker, Daniel Ong, Jamie Yeo and Glenn Ong all worked at the Perfect 10.\n\nYeah, that was so long ago that I can’t even find pictures of it. But apparently this is happening now? Perfect 10,000 work relationships.\n\n28) “Growing Up” was pretty good. But “VR Man”, no words. Watch if you want your IQ to decrease by 10 points.\n\nI’m sorry James Lye, but you sold yourself so short on this one.\n\n29) When STOMP = the SS. Heaven send help if you did something in your school uniform.\n\n30) As a result, you thought that maybe taking your badge off your uniform gave you some form of incognito status. Not true.\n\nOr Hor, drink on MRT. Kena Stomp, Nanchiau.\n\n31) Queensway. You went with your team or classmates to get matching shoes/ raquets/ print team shirts and when you were done, you probably went to Ikea to get useless crap and eat Swedish meatballs. 32) You were present for that Esplanade debacle and discussion. Durian bra? Mosquito eyes? And then you decided whatever, loved the kick butt acoustics and thought it was pretty unique anyway.\n\nMosquito eyes on fire.\n\n33) You hardly heard anyone call Singapore’s national anthem “Majulah Singapura”, almost everyone around you, teachers included, called it “Mari Kita”.\n\n“Then, you sing Mari Kita”\n\n34) You thought that winning Singapore Idol only meant Big Gulp and Mr. Softee endorsements.\n\nSingapore Idol made all my 7-11 dreams come true\n\n35) Oyapeyasompapeya…roti prata… your dog died… fishcakes… I dunno. There are probably ten thousand variations of this team picking rhyme.\n\nOi, don’t cry lah, we already oyapeyasom.\n\n36) Pepsi-cola was not a drink.\n\nDude on the right be like KENA SAI at wonder-socks’ killer move\n\n37) Autograph books.\n\nThe original Friendster.\n\n38) Despite having a ton of department stores on Orchard, somehow, New Urban Male was the ONLY place to get Havaianas. This is why they put Project Work in our syllabus.\n\nProblem: Help the cute aunty find another place to buy Brazilian slippers.\n\n39) Along with the Havaianas trend, Crumpler bags all of a sudden took over the backs of teenagers of Singapore.\n\nStomp you and your matchy matchyness! I don’t think they did very well on their PW either.\n\n40) You can probably say 1, 2, 3 in only three of the four national languages; English, Malay and Chinese. However, for some reason and courtesy of SMRT, the only Tamil number you know is 9. Indian friends, you polyglots.\n\nOnpatu, onpatu, onpatu\n\n41) Snowman Markers were the best, until the Maxiflo markers came out. You know this.\n\nA rich red Maxiflo marker\n\n42) Channel 8 had the most ridiculous shows but just like a gossip magazine, you kept coming back for more no matter how awful it got. 7pm then 9pm, Mondays to Fridays baby.\n\n杨过，为什么，为什么！！？？\n\n43) If you traveled out of the country, you realized that Singapore was probably the ONLY place that had absolutely no reference to anything Chinese in naming her Chinatown. Bullock Cart Water.\n\ndamn original, damn stylo.\n\n44) That one time when the Vengaboys were all over Singapore. Why, why, why? How, how, how?\n\nEven in 2014 we’re still playing their songs at band concerts!? Impressive.\n\n45) Question spotting. Just. Don’t. Do. It.\n\n天灵灵, 地灵灵你 spot question 好太平。\n\n46) Milo trucks. The drink of champions, drink of the gods, drink for anyone who just wants a happier life. You just made sure your teacher didn’t see you sneak back around for a second cup.\n\nThis school is so happy for the Milo truck, they even made their uniform match it.\n\n47) Was anyone else disappointed that Kong Guan at the school canteen never EVER sold the elusive corn pau?\n\nThe Corn Pau isn’t even pictured with the big boss. Curious.\n\n48) You were there for the glorious inception of the blanco cartridges.\n\nisso beutifuhl\n\n49) Copper was always a tricky one at O’levels. Some sources said to call it pink, others reddish-brown. And then you had to be careful about when it was what colour sometimes. Sian.\n\nReddish-brown with a hint of pink, can?\n\n50) Serious question: What does Chan Mali Chan mean?"
