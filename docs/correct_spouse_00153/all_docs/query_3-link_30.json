        "text": "Singapore radio host Jamie Yeo gave birth to a son last month, she announced on her Instagram page on Sunday (Sept 24).\n\n“Arrived 29 August, a little early at 35 weeks, but healthy and at a respectable 2.35kg. After 3 weeks getting spoilt by the amazing world class nurses and docs in the HD ward of SGH, our little man Luke is finally home!” Yeo, 40, shared in her post about her second child.\n\nYeo is married to a 38-year-old British expat, Rupert, whom she met on Tinder and wed after 10 months.\n\nIn her post, Yeo also thanked the staff at the Singapore General Hospital.\n\n“Massive thanks also to the medical staff especially the ever cheerful nurses in the maternity and labour wards, whose experience helped get us through a month of hospitalisation for Mummy and got baby Luke to a safe place for delivery,” she wrote.\n\nYeo had announced that she was expecting in June this year. In an Instagram post announcing her pregnancy, Yeo had joked, “Also just in case you bump into me on the streets, no, it’s not a beer belly!”\n\nYeo has a seven-year-old daughter, Alysia, from her previous marriage to Thorsten Nolte, a Briton. Before that, she was married to fellow radio deejay Glenn Ong."
