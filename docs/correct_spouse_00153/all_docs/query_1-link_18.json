GLENN ONG!!!!!!\n\nI was like OMG OMG OMG..\n\nToo stunned.\n\nBut I kept my cool..\n\nThen he introduced himself.\n\n“Im Glenn.”\n\nIn my heart I was like..\n\nD’UH!!!!!!!\n\nOf course la I know you are Glenn Ong!\n\nThe GLENN ONG!\n\nGoodness me you are my idol!\n\nThen I told him im supposed to find their office.\n\nSo he pressed level 3 and when we reached their office,\n\nROD MONTEIRO was there too!\n\nAnd GLENN introduced me to ROD too..\n\nWOW WOW!\n\nThem 2 are like the bestest bestest pair ever..\n\n“brudder brudder..”\n\nHaha..who could forget that!\n\nAnd so I collected my prize\n\nfrom one of the girls in the office..\n\nAnd I said my goodbyes to them..\n\nAnd that was it..\n\nYou know sometimes I get people telling me\n\nI looked like Jamie Yeo\n\n(ni betol eh..bukan bedek bedek).\n\nShe is the ex wife to Glenn Ong.\n\nWhen they got married last time,\n\nI told people\n\n“Seee…see…that’s me with Glenn Ong..”\n\nHehe..\n\nIts just some lame joke lah ok.\n\nBut sadly\n\nthey did not last..it was a shocker.\n\nAnd now Glenn is with Jean Danker.\n\nThe media are very interested in their\n\npersonal life..\n\nbut hey, leave them alone lah ah..\n\ni respect them for their profession.\n\nI wish them all the best for their future.\n\nI love our DJs..\n\nThey are a funny bunch.\n\nIm a happy bunny today.\n\nheehee.\n\nAnd later, we’ll be having Botak Jones for lunch!\n\nYABEDABEDOOOOOOO!!"
