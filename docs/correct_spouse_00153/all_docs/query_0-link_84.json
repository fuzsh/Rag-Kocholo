        "text": "i'm in my mid twenties.. and i'm married for 3 years already.\n\ni want to divorce him, but do i need his consent to file for divorce?\n\ni've got 2 kids, eldest is coming 3 years and i'm pregnant (due in october)\n\nwe are both working &amp; i wonder who will the kids goes to?\n\nwhat if he doesn't want to sign the papers as in, dont agree to divorce?\n\ni appreciate your help..\n\nyou got strong attitude towards divorcing with your husband . but you are actually quite lazy to read it up ...\n\nscroll down and you will see this topic has been discuss and type out too many times le .. all the advices that can be given has been given ....\n\ni do not know the reason .. but .. take care .. the child inside you is innocent . any mental stress will be on him/her also\n\nI am in the midst of divorce, as I am working, my ex refused to pay me $1. I am fine with it. He only want to pay $50 per month for child maintenance. (I have moved out with my child). My ex is self-employed and told my lawyer he is in debt about $150K, hence only can pay $50 per month? I can support my child but he wants weekday/weekend/PH and school holiday access, shouldnt he do his part too? I paid for ALL my child expenses, tuition, swimming, school bus, school text book, uniform, haircut, assessment books etc. DOES THAT MEAN HE DONT HAVE TO PAY 50% OF THIS EXPENSES,EQUIVALENT TO $500 per month. Since he is in debt, does it mean that the court will allow????????????\n\nI think there are 2 separate issues: child maintenance and access to the child and you should not mix them up - of course you could use the child access as a negotiation tool and bargaining chip - but you should not carry to the extreme.\n\nChild access for divorced parent not having custody should be provided. It is for the good of the child to have access to both parents. As to the frequency, my personal thoughts is that it should be as frequently as possible given the practical limitations.\n\nSo, even if the other parent did not provide for child maintenance, they should still be given access to the child.\n\nAs for child maintenance, yes, you can fight for it. But I guess the best is to negotiate for an appropriate amount. Ideally you should get 50% but since the child is with you, naturally you pay more. So whatever the amount, you should try to negotiate, it could be $50 as he suggested or $100 or $200 or more..\n\nAt the end of the day, even if the courts awarded higher amount of child maintenance (say the $500 that you asked for), it may not be easy to enforce.\n\nI would think that if you are fully capable of bringing up your child yourself, just get some token amount and put it in an account for the child\n\nIs it the society or the 'trend' now?\n\nDivorce seems to be a frequent topic,\n\ntoo many temptations or hectic worklife is making people stress up and thus making them short tempered?\n\nNana, what's wrong? Cannot salvage your marriage at all?\n\nDue date in Oct, meaning you are just pregnant and sex with your hubby is very recent too, what can happen within these few months?\n\nTake care of yourself,\n\nAll the best.\n\nSM, seen your blog and read your story.\n\nyou have my respect.\n\nMelissa.\n\njean,\n\nWhat in your view is a valid reason for divorce?\n\nEveryone who file for divorce will have reasons.. you mean we just file for divorce for fun?\n\nDecision to divorce should be whether the marriage can continue ..\n\nSale/non-sale of house should not be a major factor when compared to our happiness..\n\nChild custody shouldn't be a major factor for divorce. The handling of the child custody is an after effect of divorce and that has to be considered - in the best interest of the children.\n\nBut in a divorce, there won't be win-win and you can't stay in a love-less marriage because of the children.\n\nI am not saying that divorce is for fun. As I already pointed out, marriage is not to be taken lightly as in once married, you need to considered carefully before deciding on a divorce. There could be alot of reasons why divorce is necessary (just an example. husband is a compulsive gambler and incur huge debts without intention to change etc.). If Nana did make attempts to work things out with her hubby and failed, then divorce becomes inevitable. But of course some efforts need to be made 1st unless it's very serious (ie.hubby is a violent abuser which puts wife and children's lives in jeopardy). Yes, here is no win win situation in a divorce and of course custody of child as well as sale of house will be the next step. And of course ultimately children will be the ones facing the effects of a divorce.\n\n\"And of course ultimately children will be the ones facing the effects of a divorce.\"\n\nHOw about the effects on children in a love-less marriage?\n\nDivorce is not necessary the worse for the children. It is our attitude towards handling of the children that is more important than the divorce itself.\n\nDon't always think thank children of a divorced family are ill-adjusted and the worst off.. if the love of both the parents are still there - even after divorce, children can grow up happily.\n\nYa...agreed. I didn't mean that kids from divorced family are worst off. Kids will not be happy if both parents ignore each other or quarrel and fight most of the time while being together. They may even grow up thinking that fighting is normal. Initial stage of a divorce, children will need time to adjust to the new lifestyle and that is the time when they may be emotionally and psychologically affected. Parent with the custody of the children play a very important role to guide them through. My fren's kid turned out fine now even though she was a very frustrated kid at 1st. This is cause her family members are very supportive, they help to take care and teach her kid while she was at work. She also played her part as a mum and took good care of her kid. It took a year before her child got out of the frustrated mode.\n\nI think we can safely say that kids, or for that matter, humans, are very adaptable.\n\nI've seen how my children adapt. They are ok in general, when their basic needs and entertainment wants are fulfilled. Occasionally daughter do cry when divorce was mentioned. Like the recent breakup of Glenn Ong and Jamie Yeo, tears just welled up in her eyes and she just felt sad. I took pains to explain to her some of the reasons why adults break up and why sometimes it is necessary. i also told her that as long as both daddy and mummy love you very much, that is all that matters. that seems to settle her down a bit.\n\nI think the crux is that children of divorced parents will never be able to receive the education or the love coming from when both parents are around. when something happens, with both the father and mother, they can work out a better solution or form a better informed opinion or simply give the best advise to the children. As they say, two heads is better than one. This is one area where children of divorced parents lose out."
