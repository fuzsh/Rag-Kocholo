        "text": "Woke up this morning to a delightful surprise - Advisory Singapore on this year's Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list, in the Social Impact category! The Under 30 list needs no introduction, and it's an honour to have our work supporting young people from all walks to make informed career choices, recognised alongside inspiring peers. What has felt particularly special about Advisory's inclusion in this year's Under 30 list, is the opportunity to be featured alongside my co-founders, Brendan and Yau Xuan. Advisory has always been a team effort, and while we have so many to thank for their time and contributions, I say with full confidence that none deserve more credit than them. The number 30 is a (slightly harsh!) reminder of how much time has passed - from a small, scrappy group of friends at 18, to the charity that Advisory is today some 8 years later. It has been the privilege of a lifetime to lead Advisory, and we're beyond grateful to every individual and organisation that has been a part of, and will be part of, our mission to help young people transition from school to work. Thank you Aaron and Nadine, for agreeing to support us as referees, after we found out we had been nominated. With thanks as well to Rana Wehbe Watson and the team at Forbes as well, for recognising our work. #ForbesUnder30 #ForbesU30Asia You can find our profile on the Forbes website, and read more about this year's listees, at: https://lnkd.in/dJBvPueG https://lnkd.in/dN3Tt9AW\n\n$682,495,840.00. When I first saw the figure, I did a double take. The One Young World team reached out to us at Advisory Singapore late last year, to feature our work in their 2023 Impact Report. Since 2016, we've supported young people from all walks of life to make informed career choices - through our online repository of interviews with working professionals, industry panels and learning journeys with firms, and our nationwide mentorship efforts. As part of the report, the #OYW team analysed this work between 2016 and 2023, and estimated Advisory's social return on investment (SROI) to be $682,495.840.00 - the savings from correcting for job mismatches due to choosing the wrong professions. This is the first time that we've had an SROI appraisal of Advisory's work. And it's affirming, to know that the work we do to ensure young people have the support they need to transition from school to the workforce, is working. But to me, the more important figure is 1,967,400. That's the number of hours that our fully pro bono team and working professional volunteers have put in over the last seven years. It has taken a village to help us support over 200,000 young people, and we owe a debt of gratitude to everyone who has been a part of this journey. I would be remiss not to highlight the role that #OneYoungWorld played. Joining the OYW Summit virtually (due to COVID!) in 2021 was transformational, and was the platform that introduced us to Deloitte. Getting to hear from senior Deloitte leaders - like Michele Parmelee, Stasha Santifort, Elizabeth Faber, Leena Patel, and Emma Codd - on issues ranging from diversity and inclusion, education, and climate, was thought-provoking. It was also the genesis of Advisory's partnership with Deloitte. Over the years, it's been a joy to work with Jeanette and the Deloitte team in Southeast Asia as a mentorship partner for the Advisory Mentorship Programme, and as a supporter of the Advisory Educators Roundtable in line with Deloitte's own #WorldClass ambition to empower 100 million people by 2030 with education and skills. To the One Young World team - Kate, David, Ella, Dan, David, Kamal, Valeria, Samantha, and many others - thank you for giving young people a platform that accelerates their ability to deliver on the world's most pressing problems. It has helped us advance our work in support of #SDGs 4, 8, and 10 - as it has for countless other young people trying to make a difference. Special thanks as well to our Chief Impact Officer Kay Siong, who helped to collate the statistics for this SROI appraisal.

In early March, I had the privilege of travelling to Tokyo for the inaugural Schwarzman Scholars x Asia Society seminar for #SchwarzmanScholars alumni. Across two days at the International House of Japan, we had the chance to engage with a variety of speakers on a range of issues - from regional peace and stability in Northeast Asia, to digital and sustainable cities, to cyber development and AI governance, and even the interplay of zen and technology. Beyond the seminar's content, I'm most grateful for the opportunity to connect and reconnect with #Schwarzies new and old. Community is so important - and it's incredibly affirming to meet with others who are living their careers in a fearless and impact-driven way. It's been an important reminder that it's ok to be unconventional and trek off the beaten path - so long as you hold a conviction of what you want to work on, and are willing to commit to staying the course. Many thanks to the Schwarzman Scholars team (Doug Hughes, Wenting Zhu, Hayley Treider), the Asia Society Policy Institute team (Danny Russel, Rorry Daniels, fellow alumnus Daria Kurushina), and our generous hosts at the International House of Japan (James Kondo, Ken Jimbo) for an insightful convening. To many more inspiring gatherings ahead!\n\nThis #EducationDay, we reflect on the transformative power of education - to help young people learn about the world around them, to equip them with the skills they need to succeed, and to prepare them to contribute to those around them. At Advisory Singapore, we’re privileged to be able to work with young people everyday. We believe every young person deserves the chance to pursue their aspirations and to find meaningful work - and it all starts with quality education and career guidance. Thank you to UNDP and Samsung Mobile for supporting the work we do at Advisory, and for sharing our story with the world. UNESCO has also dedicated the 2024 International Day of Education to the crucial role education and teachers play in countering hate speech. As we move into a digital future, education’s role will be more important than ever in helping us to build cohesive and integrated societies. Happy International Day of Education to one and all - and thank you to teachers, mentors, and educators everywhere for the good work you do, not just today, but everyday!\n\nIn October this year, a small team came to Singapore to capture the Advisory Singapore story on film, as part of my role as a #Generation17 Young Leader with UNDP and Samsung Mobile. To be honest, the three days of shooting filled me with some dread. Because how do you capture seven and a half years of work, and the contributions of so many people, in under two minutes? When we started out in 2016, we were just a group of friends spread across three continents with big dreams, lots of video calls, and no clue what we were doing. But we were guided by a single goal - to empower young people from all walks of life to make informed career and further education choices. Our work spoke to the #SDGs of 4 (#QualityEducation), 8 (#DecentWork), and 10 (#ReducedInequalities) before we even knew what they were. Fast forward to the present day, and we're a fully youth-led charity, somehow still entirely volunteer-driven with no full-time staff. Our online repository of interviews with working professionals has reached over 500,000 people, and we have supported over 3,000 young people through 1-1 career mentorship since 2020. We run learning journeys, industry panels, and in-school programmes. It boggles my mind how far we've come. While I'm grateful to be part of it, the Advisory story doesn't belong to me. It has been written by so many people, foremost of which are my co-founders, Brendan and Yau Xuan. Advisory would not exist without you - as well as the hard work and dedication of folks past and present like Aaron, Joyce, Junhao, Ryan, Justin, Sabariesh, Denise, Jamie, Bao Shin, Wei En, Kay Siong, Clarence, Yusi, Su Chen, Owen, Kester, and so many others. It was also important that we tell the Advisory story authentically. We returned to film in spaces we spent much time in like The Red Box and the National Library. We featured industries critical to Singapore that Advisory has profiled, and were thrilled to film with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), PSA Singapore, and Changi Airport Group at iconic locations like Pasir Panjang Terminal and Changi Airport. We sought to highlight Singapore-based companies, and made a visit to Grab HQ. We covered Advisory events co-organised with Ant Group, Workforce Singapore, and Singapore Maritime Foundation (SMF). To the Edelman, Method & Madness, and Wave Films teams - Alex, Domenic, Nicole, Marty, Lindsey, Sabrina, Gia, Ross, Jerry - thank you for helping us to tell the Advisory story in the most responsible way possible. I'm beyond grateful to everyone who has been part of the Advisory story. The work continues, and we stand guided by our belief in supporting every young person - no matter their socio-economic circumstance, family background, or schooling history - to pursue their aspirations, find meaningful work, and have a fair shot at life.

At #UNFCCC COP28 UAE, #Singapore 🇸🇬 signed its first ever Implementation Agreement on carbon credits collaboration under #Article6 of the #ParisAgreement with #PapuaNewGuinea 🇵🇬. Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu and Papua New Guinea’s Minister for Environment, Conservation and Climate Change Simo Kilepa signed the agreement at the COP SG Pavilion. It’s a delight that this first agreement is with a fellow member of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). What this means is that both countries have established a bilateral framework for the trading of carbon credits with #correspondingadjustment - enabling the channeling of investment into projects that will achieve additional mitigation outcomes. As part of this agreement, Singapore has committed to contributing 5% of the share of proceeds from carbon credits toward climate adaptation efforts in Papua New Guinea. High integrity carbon markets are a critical enabler to raise climate ambition. Getting this Implementation Agreement through has been a long process with the involvement of many public officers, and no one has worked harder on this than Rui Yun Gan. Thank you for seeing this process through! Read more about this first ever Implementation Agreement in this article by Cheryl Tan for The Straits Times: https://lnkd.in/ghX98sxs Rui Yun Gan | Sin Liang Cheah | Rueban Manokara | Arun Vignesh | Wen Lin L. | Tan Ching Ying | Fam Wee Wei | Dorothy Lee | Deanna Tan | Vicki Yong | Lydia T. | Phyllis Kai Ling Brown National Climate Change Secretariat, Singapore Strategy Group, Prime Minister's Office Ministry of Trade and Industry (Singapore) Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Singapore\n\nAt #UNFCCC COPs, each day has a thematic focus. Today is #Youth Day at COP28 UAE. At Expo City Dubai, there will be a range of youth-focussed programming, spotlighting young people and climate change. #Singapore believes that youth have an important role to play in tackling climate change. For this reason, we have brought our first official youth delegation to #COP28, with our youth delegates selected from the climate youth development programme co-led by Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Singapore, National Climate Change Secretariat, Singapore, and National Youth Council Singapore. Our youth delegates are supporting the operations of the COP SG Pavilion, shadowing our negotiators, and running programmes for youth delegates from around the world. They even met and had a dialogue in #Dubai with our Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean! Our youth delegates come from diverse backgrounds and from all walks of life. Some are students (our youngest is 18!), while others are social entrepreneurs and PhD researchers. They are teachers, civil society leaders, and private sector professionals. Each is addressing the climate challenge in their own meaningful ways - a representation that there is no one solution or pathway to take action on climate change. This Youth Day at COP28, and in my mid-twenties, I’m reminded that young people can play a big part in solving the pernicious challenge that is climate change. This is true in the COP negotiating rooms, where there are youth are at the forefront of negotiations and policymaking on behalf of their governments. This is true in the world of business, where young people are making companies more sustainable and are launching start-ups that are delivering transformational change. This is true in civil society and academia, where young people are driving ambition and strengthening our understanding of climate science. As the generation that will be most affected by the impacts of climate change, young people have an important role to play. I look forward to what our youth delegates will do when they return to Singapore - and how they can constructively galvanise action and ambition to help keep 1.5 degrees within reach. Get a glimpse into what one of our youth delegates, Rachel, does at COP28 in this reel: https://lnkd.in/g2UkqBCR David Chua | Jianwei Heng (王健威) | Gayle Goh | Tan Lin Teck | Hasliza Ahmad | Sarah Q. | Charissa Tang | Rueban Manokara | Derek Ng | Deborah Lim | David Tay | Valerie Tan | Gracia Ong | Arinna Fithriyya | Immanuel Lim | Min Jie Lee | Samantha T. | Qiyun Woo (胡绮芸) | Man Jing Kong 江曼菁"
