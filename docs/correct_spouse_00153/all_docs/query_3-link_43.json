        "text": "Singapore — Singaporean DJ, actress, TV host and model Jamie Yeo has just announced recently on social media that she and her family have plans to move to England which is the hometown of her third husband, Rupert.\n\nIn the post, the artist said that she has been “working my butt off because we’re ready to buy that home in England.”\n\nThis is what she wrote on the Nov 7 post on Instagram:\n\n“Been working my butt off because we’re ready to buy that home in England. It would be so good for the kids to experience life somewhere else. They’re too indulged at the moment and it would do them good to be without an Aunty picking up after them, among other things.\n\nLiving in America when I was a teen gave me confidence and social EQ. Also taught me to be independent. I want that for the kids. The world has become small again with travel resuming so I can always fly back and forth for work. Btw anyone looking for a cozy 3 bedroom walk-up apartment here in Singapore with lush 360degree greenery views? 😝 If all goes well, it will be available for rent around May next year.”\n\nIn 2001, Yeo started going out with DJ Glenn Ong and the pair tied the knot in New Creation Church three years later in 2004. Unfortunately, things did not work out so they split up in early 2009. Yeo then married Thorsten Nolte, a British immigrant in Singapore in 2010. They share a daughter together. In February 2015, Yeo and Nolte got divorced. Yeo gained sole custody of her daughter, Alysia, in April 2016.\n\nAbout a year later in June 2017, Jamie Yeo announced to the media that she was tying the knot for the third time to another British immigrant Rupert and was five months pregnant with a baby boy. On August 29, 2017, their son Luke was born./TISG"
