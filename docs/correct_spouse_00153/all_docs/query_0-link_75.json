        "text": "Anon Guy\n\nThe Straits Times (Singapore)\n\n9/28/03\n\nTHE EMAIL INTERVIEW: GLENN ONG\n\nWho says I'm a jerk?\n\nBy Wong Kim Hoh\n\nGLENN Ong, 33, is Singapore's equivalent of a shock jock. A\n\nradio personality with MediaCorp since 1994, he has cultivated as\n\nmany fans as he has critics with his sexist, bawdy and often times,\n\npolitically incorrect, humour.\n\nHe made headlines last year when he broadcast the breakdown of\n\nhis marriage to fellow DJ Kate Reyes on radio and when he got\n\nsuspended, together with partner Rod Monteiro, for two weeks for\n\nbeing too risque on their show Five Guys and A Girl on Perfect\n\n10.\n\nOng, who once worked as a karaoke lounge\n\njockey, now helms the popular The Morning\n\nExpress on Class 95 FM with Monteiro and Mark\n\n'The Flying Dutchman' van Cuylenberg.\n\nQ. Ok, what is your Chinese name? Do you\n\nknow what it means?\n\nA. Wang Shu Jia, I understand it means very\n\nscholarly.\n\nQ. Your partner Rod Monteiro mentioned in a magazine\n\ninterview that you are from the banking industry. He was\n\njoking, right?\n\nA. No, he wasn't. I was indeed on the way to becoming a futures\n\ntrader, paying my dues on the trading floor of the Singapore\n\nInternational Monetary Exchange before I received the desperate\n\ncall from the then Singapore Broadcasting Corporation. The\n\nsituation was grave and I had to save Perfect 10 98.7FM.\n\nQ. Apparently, after a post-mortem of your new show with\n\nRod and The Flying Dutchman on Class 95 earlier this year,\n\nyou left in a foul mood, and banged into someone's\n\nMercedes? What did they say to make you so moody? Was\n\nresponse to the show negative?\n\nA. It wasn't so much the negative response from the audience. It\n\nwas more a case of too many cooks trying to cook up the ultimate\n\ndish. It was like, 'let's add caviar, red wine, escargots, fillet\n\nmignon and foie gras to the chicken rice'. I thought to myself:\n\n'**** that! **** you all. This is crazy, it's impossible.' We hadn't\n\neven got the chemistry right between the three of us. But looking\n\nback, everyone just wanted it to work. I took it a little too\n\npersonally. Ratings jumped three points, went down two points,\n\nplateaued and now all's good, it's up 10 points. Singapore's fallen\n\nin love with the new Morning Express.\n\nQ. A lot of listeners think the Flying Dutchman cramps your\n\nstyle, and Rod's of course. Seriously, do you think the FD's\n\ntrying very hard to be hip? If you had a choice, would you\n\nwant him out?\n\nA. No! The man is a very important person on The Morning\n\nExpress. He's a hard worker, contributes a great deal and has a\n\nwealth of experience to get Rod and myself out of trouble. He\n\ndoesn't cramp our style, we can still say whatever we want. It's\n\njust that, with an extra man on the show, we try to refrain from\n\nbabbling on the way we used to. I must say, at times, the boy can\n\nbe a troublemaker. The boy is more controversial than Rod and I\n\nconjoined, err, I mean, combined.\n\nQ. So do you fancy yourself as the Howard Stern of\n\nSingapore radio?\n\nA. No, no, no. I hate the guy. Caught his show while I was in\n\nNew York and I personally think he's a waste of time. He's lucky\n\nI'm a Singaporean DJ because if I were American, I swear I'd kick\n\nhis ass.\n\nQ. A lot of women - and men - say you are a jerk because you\n\ntalked about your failed marriage to Kate Reyes on national\n\nradio and you always make lewd sexist jokes. Are you a jerk?\n\nA. A lot of women - and men - have also hailed me as a radio god\n\nbecause I talked about my failed marriage to Kate Reyes on\n\nnational radio and make lewd sexist jokes about women. And\n\ndon't forget the faggadydoodahdeis and the call for Superman to\n\nsave the twin towers from collapsing. So am I a jerk? Nope... I'm\n\na radio god.\n\nQ. Faggadydoodahdeis?\n\nA. Rod and I were the first ones to introduce concepts like\n\nInternational Nipple Day and Faggadydoodahdeis on radio. People\n\nthink we were homophobic but we weren't. We gave gays a lot of\n\nexposure. We may sound nonsensical on radio but by talking\n\nabout taboo subjects, we made people think. We try to open\n\nthings up, even cans of worms.\n\nQ. Don't deny it. You are going out with Jamie Yeo, right?\n\nA. Yes. And she's so damn fine. Love ya, babe!\n\nQ. Word has it despite your chauvinistic persona, Jamie calls\n\nthe shots in the relationship.\n\nA. She knows when and how to call the shots. She knows I have\n\na fiery temper and she knows what I like and what I dislike. At the\n\nend of the day, I am man, she's woman and as far as I'm\n\nconcerned, we're great for each other.\n\nQ. You've just bought yourself a new Subaru WRX?\n\nObviously, the CPF cut is not hurting you too badly.\n\nA. I've been saving up for six months to buy my dream car. Guess\n\nit's easier for someone like me because I'm not married and I don't\n\nhave kids to support. CPF cut? What CPF cut? Just kidding.\n\nQ. If your ideal woman were a car, what would she be?\n\nA. A red Honda FIT with white sports rims and 15-inch tyres for\n\nnow.\n\nQ. Seriously, what kind of man goes bald, blonde and trims\n\nhis armpit hair?\n\nA. Glenn Ong will try anything except shave his armpits. I think\n\nyou got me mixed up with Mr Epilady Rod Monteiro.\n\nQ. Apparently, you think that singlets are the height of\n\nsartorial finesse...\n\nA. No. I just think it's practical. It's bloody hot in Singapore,\n\nman.\n\nIf your boss allowed you to come to work in a tank top, wouldn't\n\nyou? It's all about comfort and staying cool makes me more\n\nproductive. And yes, I think the air-conditioner is the greatest\n\ninvention of the century. I mean if they allowed me to come to\n\nwork naked, I would. It's too damn hot.\n\nQ. Have you ever been stalked? Has anyone spat at you in\n\npublic?\n\nA. Never. It's not easy to get past the security guards where I live.\n\nPeople part like the Red Sea the moment they see me coming. No\n\none wants to mess with me; there's really no reason to. If they\n\ninsult me in public, I'll insult them back 10 times over. Not worth\n\nit lah, brudders and sistas. Smile and I'll smile back, say hello and\n\nI'll say hello.\n\nQ. Do you have any role models?\n\nA. I have mentors. I'm a bit schizoid, I have a bit of Philip Chew,\n\nBernard Lim and Mark Richmond in me. They showed me the\n\nropes. Mark taught me all the bad things lah. I get my feminine\n\nside from Florence Lian. Eh, I'm not the sexist people think I am,\n\nok?\n\nhttp://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/talk/story/0,4386,211995,00.html"
