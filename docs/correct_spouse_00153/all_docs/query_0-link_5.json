        "text": "After keeping it within her for the past six years, Mediacorp DJ Jamie Yeo has admitted that it was her fault that her marriage with ex DJ Glenn Ong broke down in 2009.\n\nThe 37-year-old told 8 Days:\n\n\"Let's not pretend that things won't get awkward if I were to return when he's still there. He's my ex and things would be awkward. I don't think I've said it before, but our break-up [in 2009] was my fault and I'm really sorry for it. You can put that down on record.\"\n\nFunny that the hot mama decided to issue an apology through a magazine rather than in person. At least, Millennials break up via text, which is really much more personal.\n\nAnd to mark her return to Mediacorp with a really newsworthy interview, the Gold 90FM DJ also added thatÂ she is now separated fromÂ Englishman Thorsten Nolte, her husband of four years. In fact, they have been separated for about 10 months.\n\nYes, all you hot-blooded males, the mother-of-one is back up on the market.\n\nIn other news, Glenn Ong, who is probably still full of angst after his divorce with Yeo, was fighting with Nicholas Lee (is Ronnie) on Twitter. The ex DJ ridiculed Channel 5's futuristic drama 2025, which was createdÂ by Lee. Ong desecrated 2025, saying that \"at least VR Man is funny\".Â Check out the bitch fight:\n\nGlenn Ong sending Channel 5 his love on V Day\n\nExecutive Producer Nicholas Lee using the F word. #SG50shadesofgrey\n\nThe ex-most powerful man on radio giving it toÂ Ronnie. What would Tan Ah Teck do?\n\nIt's funny @nicklee7788 how you were always so cordial towards me when I was still on radio these past years and while I was always critical or taking mean digs at Ch5 shows,( there have been some really bad ones ) this really should be nothing new to you. I didn't know you were involved with 2025, until I read your reaction. Perhaps I should have checked if your studio produced 2025 before posting my crazy,unqualified,shite opinion on Twitter? Maybe I should have just supported local for the sake of supporting local? Or perhaps not say anything if something is bad? How long have we been acquainted, 16 years or more @nicklee7788 ? Now that I'm no longer on radio, you f#%k me in front of all my followers, some as young as your kids. Well I'm glad we were just acquainted and never friends because from today onwards we're just strangers, just pray I never become the most powerful man on radioÂ again...because I always keep it real, and I always keep my word, you will be entitled to nothing, because we were once aquatinted but now we are complete strangers. @nicklee7788Â (emphasis mine)\n\nGlenn Ong blowing more kisses to \"Nicholas Lee is Ronnie\", someone get them a room.\n\nThe future most powerful man on radio taking on a TV man.\n\nWhat is this? The stone age?\n\nRelated articles\n\nJamie Yeoâs apology also reveals that Glenn Ong is actually Sâporeâs Batman\n\nGlenn Ong and âNicholas Lee is Ronnieâ continue to slug it out over local sci-fi drama 2025\n\nJamie Yeo returns to Mediacorp a month after ex-husband Glenn Ongâs departure\n\nTop photo from Jamie Yeoâs Facebook."
