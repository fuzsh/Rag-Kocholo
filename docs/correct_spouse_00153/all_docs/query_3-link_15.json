        "text": "My jaw literally dropped when I saw the front cover of yesterday’s The New Paper. Jamie Yeo’s attached with a hot hunk, and Glenn Ong is together with Jean Danker. I was like, “What?! That was fast!”\n\nOkay, I don’t believe that one could fall in love so quickly after a break-up unless it’s a rebound. But I may not know the true picture in this case.\n\nGlenn Ong mentioned that he likes Jean Danker because she is traditional, which Jamie Yeo’s “an ang moh trapped in a Chinese body”. That’s makes me ponder what kind of person I am.\n\nWell, I used to be the so-called “ang moh” because I will go after the guy I like. But now, I guess I’ve kind of leave it to God. The little “ang moh” stays inside of me–I will still confess my feelings when I like someone; I will not hide. I will still try my means to get close but I draw my boundaries. Just like my “relationship” with him. I will still tell him I missed him but I will never ask him out again. Maybe because twice bitten, thrice shy. I prefer carrying the passive role in the relationship if I can (I don’t like to make decisions, if I can.. tired of doing it!), I will never propose to a guy (no way!) and over my dead body will I go for match-making (even if I’m going to stay single my entire life).\n\nYup, that’s me… both the “ang moh” and the traditionalist.\n\nThis was from his Facebook.\n\nRULE: Once you’ve been tagged you are supposed to write a note with 25 random things, facts, habits or goals about you. At the end, choose 25 people to be tagged. You have to tag the person who tagged you. If I tagged you it’s because I want to know more about you.\n\nTo do this, go to “Notes” under tabs on your profile page, paste these instructions in the body of the note, type your 25 random things, tag 25 people (in the right hand corner of the app then click publish..)\n\n1) Well, first things first. I have no clue why i’m doing this. Nevertheless, i reckon it would benefit me slightly to pen some of my thoughts in words. (beats just thinking about it)\n\n2) My new year resolution is to be a better man, perhaps to lead a more god-ly life (yes now is the time to laugh)\n\n3) I’ve always been serious about every single relationship i’ve had be it unofficial or official.\n\n4) On that note, I guess I prefer some to others (girls, yes THEY ARE ALL GIRLS)\n\n5) One of my closest buddies, stole someone’s gf of late. what a dick (yes you know who you are mister)\n\n6) I’m single and I hate to be single\n\n7) I’m a self proclaimed catholic even though I pick and choose certain parts of it and leave out most of the nitty gritty details. In actuality i think i personalised it. (isn’t that the trend? to customize things?)\n\n8 ) I love my bosses more than i love my job lol. Well its a form of motivation still isn’t it?\n\n9) I believe in Karma, well partly why i’m single seems to have something to do with my past. lol.\n\n10) I reminisce very often, about the same few people actually.\n\n11) Contrary to popular belief I am NOT gay.\n\n12) I wish I could relive my college days. I think i made less than 5 friends.\n\n13) Beijing was beautiful, plus I made a ridiculous friend. Trust me, even though I would say he’s a friend for keeps, he’s a fucking moron. (fucking 3SG CLERK)\n\n14) I realised I’m becoming more eager to succeed in life.\n\n15) Nobody really interest me anymore.\n\n16) I believe a good long lasting relationship are ones which are accidental\n\n17) I’m FUCKING addicted to poker\n\n18) I’m still waiting to meet a certain MISS ENG, after EONS of not seeing her.\n\n19) My bunch of friends are slowly disintegrating.\n\n20) I aim to quit smoking by my 25th birthday\n\n21) I’ve long wanted to live overseas for more than a month, i just might have that chance this year.\n\n22) Cold countries are by far, the best places on earth\n\n23) My next destinations would be: 1) New York, 2) California, 3) Krakow/Warsaw, 4) Peru, 5) Japan.\n\n24) Sometimes i wish I had been a better boyfriend to a certain someone\n\n25) And I’ve been wishing to re-acquaint myself with another someone from my past.\n\n25) Part 2 – Thanks for reading……!!!! hur\n\nSo I told him I’ll also give my 25, each a day, and to him only. I’m at item 13 today and it’s ‘I miss you’. 🙂 He said he liked it the most. Hehe!"
