They divorced in 2003.\n\nJamie was widely-rumoured to be the cause of the split, which she has denied. According to a report in Wanbao, the couple first started dating in 2001.\n\nAfter Glenn's divorce, he and Jamie were married in Dec 2004 at the New Creation Church.\n\nThe couple, who are known to embrace publicity, have often been spotted at media events together, openly displaying their affection for each other.\n\nA shock\n\nThe news came as a shock to many.\n\nOne of them was Jamie's ex-colleague, Robin Leong.\n\nRobin, who was briefly linked to Jamie in the past, expressed his surprise at the news.\n\nHe said he always thought they were \"very loving\". He also said he still kept in touch with Jamie, \"once in a while\"."
