        "text": "About a month after local radio DJ Jamie Yeo revealed that she had separated from ex-husband Thorsten Nolte last year, the latter is now in a relationship.\n\nHis girlfriend?\n\nFHM cover girl and model-DJ Tenashar.\n\nThe pair have been dating for six weeks, shortly after they were introduced by a mutual friend.\n\nSpeaking to The New Paper in a joint telephone interview yesterday, the happy couple were generous with their praise of each other and described each other as \"perfect\".\n\nTenashar, whose real name is Debbie Valerie Long, said: \"We clicked immediately and we are very compatible, like two peas in a pod. We are both smart and successful. I like that we are equals. We have a lot of fun when we are together.\n\n\"We are extremely in love.\"\n\nA mutual friend who thought the 40-year-old Briton would be a good match for her had set them up on a date, she said.\n\n\"She knows Thorsten is a good, honourable, funny and smart guy, and she said to me, 'You deserve someone like him',\" said Tenashar, who is in her 20s.\n\nSEPARATED\n\nLike Mr Nolte, she is unsure if Yeo is aware of their relationship.\n\nIn February, Yeo, the former Growing Up star, revealed in an interview with lifestyle magazine 8 Days that she had been separated from her digital marketing agency CEO ex-husband for the past 10 months.\n\nThe 37-year-old was previously married to local ex-radio DJ Glenn Ong in 2004 before splitting up in 2009.\n\nShe tied the knot with Mr Nolte in 2010 and they have a four-year-old daughter named Alysia.\n\nIn the magazine interview, Yeo described the break-up as a \"gradual process\", which arose from \"deep-seated problems that stemmed from their inherent personality differences\".\n\nShe said it was a mutual decision she and Mr Nolte had arrived at \"when (they) saw how much unhappiness it was causing Aly\" and that they had exhausted all options to salvage the marriage, including attending marriage counselling and seeing a psychologist.\n\nAsked about her first date with Mr Nolte, Tenashar said that they had taken a stroll in the park with their dogs and spent the time talking and getting to know each other.\n\n\"We had a lot of fun talking and we haven't been apart since. I see him every day,\" said the DJ, who has big plans in her career this year following a partnership with a record label here.\n\nWhile Tenashar would not talk about her past boyfriends, she said: \"(Nolte) is the best man I've ever met. He is the sweetest man. My friends love that I'm happy and tell me this is the happiest I've ever been.\n\n\"He is also the happiest he has ever been.\""
