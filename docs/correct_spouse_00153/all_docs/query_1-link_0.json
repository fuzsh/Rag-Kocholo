        "text": "Singaporean actress and radio presenter (born 1977)\n\nJamie Yeo (born 17 April 1977) is a Singaporean former television host, actress and radio presenter.[1] She is known for starring in Growing Up and for co-hosting the shows Castrol Football Crazy and Maxis Football Extra on ESPN Star Sports.[2]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nYeo was born in Singapore[citation needed] on 17 April 1977.[3] She attended Fairfield Methodist Primary School[4] and Nanyang Girls' High School before moving to Dayton, Ohio[citation needed] for four years, where her father was posted as an engineer in the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF).\n\nShe completed her secondary school education at Dayton Christian High School.[citation needed] After returning to Singapore, she entered Ngee Ann Polytechnic and studied mass communications,[5] because her certificate from the United States was not recognised in Singapore so she could not take her A Level at a junior college. She eventually graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 1998.[6]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nYeo began as an actress portraying Tammy in the long-running series Growing Up,[7][8] She has also acted in MediaCorp Channel 8 Mandarin-language productions Holland V and Baby Boom in 2003.[9][10]\n\nYeo left acting to pursue a radio career. From 2000 to 2006, she was a full-time DJ at MediaCorp Radio's 987FM.[8][5]\n\nIn 2005, Yeo joined ESPN and became the face of shows like Nokia Football Crazy and Football Extra. In 2009, Football Crazy was renamed Castrol Football Crazy due to a change in sponsorship and it went off air in 2010.[11][12]\n\nIn 2012, Yeo went back to radio with SAFRA Radio on the Singapore station Power98FM.[13]\n\nIn 2015, Yeo returned to Mediacorp as radio DJ for Gold 905FM. In March 2016, she took over the drive-time show The Homestretch.[14][citation needed]\n\nYeo is also the host of the travel and lifestyle program Inside Singapore on Insider TV.[14]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn an interview with TheSportsCampus in 2009, Yeo said her favorite football club is Arsenal F.C. and her favourite player Thierry Henry.[15]\n\nYeo began dating Glenn Ong in 2001 and the couple married in New Creation Church three years later in 2004, but separated in early 2009.[16]\n\nIn 2010, Yeo married Thorsten Nolte, a British immigrant in Singapore and the couple had a daughter.[17][18] However, they divorced in February 2015. In April 2016, she gained sole custody of her daughter, Alysia.[19]\n\nIn June 2017, she announced to the media that she was getting married for the third time to another British immigrant in Singapore, Rupert, and was five months pregnant with a baby boy.[20] Their son, Luke, was born on 29 August 2017.[21]\n\nYeo moved to England with her family in July 2022.[22][23] She currently lives in Lewes.[24]\n\nIn October 2023, in support of the Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Yeo revealed that she was diagnosed with an early-stage breast cancer in 2021. Yeo said she underwent a lumpectomy and radiation therapy and is currently on an \"ongoing regimen of pills\" to treat the condition.[25]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
