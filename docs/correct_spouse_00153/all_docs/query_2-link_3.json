        "text": "After a whirlwind romance – getting to know her beau Rupert on Tinder within two weeks, and tying the knot some 10 months after – radio DJ Jamie Yeo has announced that she’s expecting a son with her new husband.\n\nYeo said in an Instagram post: “So much has happened in the past few months! @Urbanfarmerly [Rupert] and I have gotten married and are now expecting! When he first suggested marriage last year, we decided we really wanted another little one pottering around the house.\n\nNow here we are, 5 months pregnant. It’s been a rather exhausting 5 months dealing with the usual nausea, fatigue, and everything that comes along with it, but it’ll all be worth it when we finally get to carry our little man in our arms.”\n\nShe added, “Also just in case you bump into me on the streets, no, it’s not a beer belly!”\n\nThe DJ didn’t release any other information about her nuptials or pregnancy.\n\nThis is Yeo’s second pregnancy and third marriage. She currently has a six-year old daughter with ex-husband Thorsten Nolte, and she was also previously married to radio DJ Glenn Ong."
