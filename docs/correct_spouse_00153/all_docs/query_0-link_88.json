        "text": "Famewhore…..?\n\nBy: Meena Current\n\nWay to announce your return to radio by declaring that you are sexually frustrated, and whilst you are at it, making a pass at your ex-husband. Jean Danker will be very pleased indeed.\n\nLocal celebrity Jamie Yeo has been separated from Englishman Thorsten Nolte, her husband of four years, for the past 10 months.\n\nThe former Growing Up actress, who last week announced that she would be returning to MediaCorp as a DJ with Gold90.5FM next month, dropped the bombshell in an interview with lifestyle magazine 8 Days.\n\nThe couple have a four-year-old daughter, Alysia, whom they now share custody of.\n\nIn the same interview, Yeo also issued an apology to ex-husband and fellow DJ Glenn Ong, who recently left MediaCorp to join hospitality consulting firm CIR VIS as a director, saying that their split in 2009 was her fault.\n\nThere is shameless and then there is shameless. What some people will do get that a little bit of attention.\n\nSheeesh!!"
