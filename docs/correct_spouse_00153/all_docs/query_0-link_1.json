        "text": "[Editor's note: Jamie Yeo is now separated fromÂ Thorsten Nolte. Read it here.]\n\nNot that you listen to radio anymore but if you remember Say it With Music and the Ego Trip radio programmes on Perfect 10 (now 987fm), this is a trip down memory lane for you.\n\nMediacorp announced yesterday that the-babe-for-all-NSF-back-in-the-early-2000s DJ Jamie Yeo is returning to Caldecott Hill as a Gold 90fm DJ after eight years. Her last Mediacorp gig was the uber-popular Say it With Music segment from 2001 to 2006.\n\nOkay, this isn't exactly news.\n\nThe news, or rather from Mothership's keen observation, is that Yeo is rejoining just one month after ex-hubby DJ Glenn Ong's departure from Mediacorp.\n\nIt could all be a big coincidence but it is factual to say that the ex-lovebirds, who were married for five years, didn't really see eye to eye.Â Yeo is married to Englishman Thorsten Nolte and has a daughter while Ong, who has a habit of marrying colleagues, is currently engaged to Class 95 DJ Jean Danker.\n\nWhile Yeo said in 2012 that \"there are no hard feelings\" between the two of them, it was still quite a high profile breakup with plenty of speculations.\n\nIn what was a shocking announcement in 2009, Ong told Singaporeans (yes, we still listen to radio then) aboutÂ the split up on air on Feb. 13 (what a nice Valentine's Day gift, by the way).\n\nAÂ listicle byÂ XinmsnÂ revealedÂ that the main reason for their marriage breakdown is believed to be fidelity issues, growing career and personality differences.\n\nThere were also some rumours that Jamie was the guilty partyÂ . However, she did clear the air with this interview:\n\nShe said: \"Right from the start, it's always been, 'It must be Jamie. She's seeing someone from work'.Â Just because I'm the girl who wears make-up and all about town, it's natural to assume that I'm the bad one.\"\n\nWith her return and his timely departure, you couldn't write the script better.\n\nFollowing his resignation from Mediacorp, Ong saidÂ that he might return to the airwaves in the future.Â Let's see if Yeo leaves if Ong returns.\n\nOh before we forget, isn't Yeo too hot for Gold 90fm - a station playing old school music?\n\nJust saying.\n\nPhotos from Jamie Yeo's Facebook."
