        "text": "Glenn Ong Su Kar (zh-sp|s=王舒佳|p=Wáng Shūjiā) is a DJ at MediaCorp Radio's Class 95FM, a Singapore English radio station, hosting the weekday morning show with \"The Flying Dutchman\", Mark Van Cuylenberg. A deeply spiritual member of New Creation Church, he has been described as \"foul, politically incorrect and refreshingly candid\" [Kim Hoh, Wong, \"Ego tripped?\" (15 May 2006), \"Straits Times\"] .\n\nAn alumnus of St Patrick's [Kim Hoh, Wong, \"Ego tripped?\" (15 May 2006), \"Straits Times\"] and Siglap Pre-University Institute [\"The nasty king of night radio\" (9 May 1999), \"Straits Times\"] , Glenn has been in the radio industry for many years, becoming a full-time DJ for 987FM in 1993, and also helps host outdoor roadshows and provide voice-overs for commercials. He hosted shows like Say It with Music, ATrax, Top 20 countdown and, starting in 1995, a late-night show called The Ego Trip [Kim Hoh, Wong, \"Ego tripped?\" (15 May 2006), \"Straits Times\"] , which was on every weekdays from 11pm to 2 am.\n\nIt was the \"Ego Trip\" that the characters \"short fart\", \"Simone\", \"The Godfather\" and the \"Honky tong Man\" were born. Known for his wit and mean remarks to callers, the \"Ego Trip\" became a controversial but highly discussed among students. It was virtually impossible to call through the phonelines and if you were unfortunate enough to, be prepared to be unjustifiably embarrassed on national radio.\n\nHe was once banned from broadcasting for two weeks for risqueness on the show, \"Five Guys And A Girl\" with co-host Rod Monteiro [Kim Hoh, Wong, \"Ego tripped?\" (15 May 2006), \"Straits Times\"] .\n\nGlenn was also the radio voice in the film \"The Teenage Textbook Movie\".\n\nIn January 2000, Ong married Kate Reyes, another DJ, but they were divorced by April 2003. Though lambasted by many for that, with Joe Augustin calling him 'scum', he married ESPN Star Sports presenter Jamie Yeo in December 2004 in New Creation Church [\"Radio DJs wed\" (3 December 2004), \"Straits Times\"] .\n\nOng owns his 5th Jack Russell, who is named Fudge and was born in 2002 [\"YOU DAWG!\" (29 January 2006), \"The New Paper\"] .\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links"
