        "text": "It's always a pleasant surprise to find out that you share the same birthday as someone else.\n\nBut to be born on the exact same day and have the same name â now that's a tad coincidental.\n\nHere's a disclaimer though: For those who are numerate and understand probability and statistics, there is about a 50 per cent chance that two people have the same birthday in a random group of 23 people.\n\nBorn on the same day, month and year\n\nRegardless, former Miss Universe Singapore Jaime Teo recently took to Instagram to reveal that she was born on the same day, month and year as former DJ Jamie Yeo.\n\nBoth women are born on April 17, 1977.\n\nIn addition, Teo and Yeo also happen to share the same-sounding first name, but spelt differently.\n\nIn her post, Teo also revealed that their daughters, Renee and Ally, were born in the same year.\n\nShe also revealed that they get along well:\n\n\"They don't get to meet up much but when they do, they pick up right off where they last left off. Just like their mommies .\n\nAlways happy to see the girls hanging out, esp when they spent all afternoon playing board games!\"\n\nHowever, observers of local entertainment will note that the coincidence that intertwine both women extent beyond just their names and daughters' ages.\n\nBoth women were previously married to local radio deejays, whose surnames are Ong.\n\nTeo was previously married to Daniel Ong, while Yeo was previously married to Glenn Ong.\n\nDaniel Ong has left the industry, while Glenn Ong is still in it.\n\nGreat minds think alike\n\nOn Instagram, Teo also showed a shiny pair of earrings that were presumably given to her by Yeo.\n\nShe said that it was the \"exact design\" that Teo would have selected for herself.\n\nYeo also uploaded a photo on her Instagram, describing that Teo was \"definitely more artistic and fit\" than her:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CQNgrYyH6W2/\n\nView Teo's original post here:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CQNSu6iAHWw/\n\nTop photo via Jaime Teo/Instagram"
