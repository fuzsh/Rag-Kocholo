        "text": "Filmmaker Siddharth Anand finds actor Abhishek Bachchan to be the perfect fit to play the antagonist in upcoming film King starring Shah Rukh Khan. He reveals to bring the actor in a never-seen-before avatar on screen.\n\nSiddharth said, “Abhishek is an actor whose full potential has yet to be fully realized. He has the ability to astonish audiences when given complex roles. King presents him in an out-and-out negative role for the first time in such a large-scale commercial movie, and he is sure to make a significant impact with his performance.”\n\nAdding to that he said, “The Jr. Bachchan was surprised when he was offered this role but accepted it immediately, intrigued by the depth of his character. It’s a special role, and Siddharth Anand has grand plans to present Abhishek in a manner audiences have never seen before.”\n\nKing marks the director’s second collaboration with SRK after Pathaan, the film will be the producer-director's first full-fledged collaboration with Abhishek. The film will witness father-daughter duo SRK and Suhana Khan sharing screen space for the first time."
