        "text": "Lately, Bollywood actors have been working on Hollywood projects and winning over admirers around the world. Shah Rukh Khan, who already has a sizable global fan base, is yet to sign a Hollywood film.\n\nKhan reportedly came very close to playing a major role in a Hollywood movie, which would have let him impress a worldwide audience. Reportedly, a mafia movie titled 'Xtreme City' was supposed to star the two biggest stars in Hollywood and Bollywood, Leonardo DiCaprio and Shah Rukh Khan, respectively. Martin Scorsese, a legendary director, was supposed to helm the movie, but it was never finished for some reason.\n\nEven screenwriter Paul Schrader, who revealed that Shah Rukh Khan was the one who wasn't willing to take the film, was supposed to be involved in the now shelved project.\n\nIn a 2013 interview with Open The Magazine, Paul said, “Just got the feeling that he was never going to be comfortable doing an international film that he didn’t control. You know that everything SRK does, he has total control over? So if he did something like this at an international level, he wouldn’t have that control. I think in the end he wasn’t that comfortable not being a hundred per cent in control\".\n\nThe Bollywood actor previously addressed the question about his Hollywood debut and gave an explanation for why, despite a long acting career, he hasn't appeared in any international projects. Shah Rukh Khan declared he would not work in Hollywood at the Berlinale 2008 press conference.\n\n\"I am not trying to be modest but I am 42 years old, I am little brown, and I don't have any special USP as an actor. I don't know Kung fu, I don't dance Latin salsa, and I am not tall enough. I think anyone who is my age in the western world, I have seen recent films of Europe, films of what you call ‘the dream factory’, I think there is no space for me,\" Shah Rukh Khan said.\n\nOn the work front, Shah Rukh Khan also has upcoming projects like Rajkumar Hirani's 'Dunki', which stars Taapsee Pannu in the lead role, and Atlee's 'Jawan', which also co-stars Nayanthara."
