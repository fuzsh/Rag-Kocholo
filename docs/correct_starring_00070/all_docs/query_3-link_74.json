        "text": "At the World Government Summit 2024 in Dubai, Indian superstar Shah Rukh Khan revealed that he was approached by Danny Boyle for the lead role in Slumdog Millionaire.\n\nDespite a close relationship with Boyle, Khan declined the offer while simultaneously hosting Kaun Banega Crorepati, as per India Today. Explaining his decision at the event, the actor remarked, “Yes, Slumdog was there, now that you mention it. And I spend a lot of time with Mr. Boyle. He’s very sweet. But I was doing Kaun Banega Crorepati on television, successfully at that time. And I just felt in the story that was being told, the guy who was hosting was very mean, the story that was being told.”\n\nHe further added, “I was cheating and being dishonest as the host (in the movie). So I just found that it’s very strange that I’m being a host (on KBC) and I’m cheating in the film. So I explained to Mr. Boyle that I wouldn’t like to do it, please, and there are way better actors than me. And I think Mr Anil Kapoor did it and he was fantastic as the host.”\n\nAddressing the prospect of Hollywood ventures, Khan admitted to engaging in discussions but clarified that he hadn’t received any solid offers. “I’ve said this honestly, but nobody believes it. So I’m going to say it to you very, very honestly. Nobody’s ever offered me any work. Crossover of substance. I may have had conversations with people I know lots of lovely people from the West, from the English film industry, from the American film industry. But nobody’s offered me any good work,” he asserted.\n\nHe was then asked if he would like to play James Bond. The star said, \"I really wanted to, but I think I am too short. But I am brown enough to play the Bond baddie.\" From Pierce Brosnan to Daniel Craig, many actors have played the role of a fictional spy in the Bond series over the years.\n\nHave something to add?
