King is his passion project and he has been meticulously working on all aspects of the project with Siddharth Anand and Sujoy Ghosh. They have collectively carved a very cool full of attitude and swag character with shades of grey for SRK in King,” he said.\n\nSRK To Sport A Rugged Look?\n\nAccording to the report, the superstar will be seen in a long-haired look. He will also sport a faint beard.\n\nAbout ‘King’\n\nHelmed by Sujoy Ghosh (best known for ‘Kahaani’), ‘King’ will explore the journey of a mentor and disciple and their attempts to survive against all odds. The movie will mark Suhana’s big-screen debut. Previously, she essayed the role of Veronica in the Netflix drama ‘The Archies’.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n4 reasons why MFs are stocking up on CreditAccess Grameen and other microfinance lenders\n\nOnce declared dead, Nifty Next 50 is up 70%.
