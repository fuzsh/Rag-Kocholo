        "text": "Hollywood make-up guru Greg Cannom and the VFX team at Shah Rukh Khan’s Red Chillies Entertainment did a remarkable job turning the 50-year-old star into a 25-year-old look-alike fan in the thriller Fan.\n\nJust how they achieved this transformation is revealed in a 15 minute video released on Tuesday by the producers, Yash Raj Films. The combination of prosthetics and make-up created by Cannom, an Oscar winner for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and VFX is the first time in the world that technology had been used in a film, according to the director Maneesh Sharma.\n\nIn the video Khan reveals he hated having to sit in a chair for 4-5 hours each day as he was transformed into the fan Gaurav , describing it as “the single most irritating thing in the world.” But he adds, “I promised myself I would not get angry.” Unable to feel his face under the silicon mask, he had to rely on others to know whether or not a particular scene worked.\n\nAt the outset when the filmmakers approached senior make-up artists overseas, they were told it was virtually impossible to make an actor look much younger for an entire film and the job could not be done. Sharma says, “The Red Chillies people remained confident and did a lot of R&D work. When we connected with Greg he took up the challenge.” The director sent the make-up artist current photos of the actor and as a young man.\n\nLooking for inspiration, Cannom looked around his Los Angeles studio and spotted the cheeks he had created for Brad Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and decided to use that as the model for Gaurav. In his painstaking preparation Cannom designed eyebrow pieces, a new nose and teeth while the VFX team shrunk the fan’s body, sharpened the jaw line, removed the Adam's apple and gave him bigger eyes and narrower shoulders.\n\nCannom says, “I was shocked at how many days Shah Rukh was going to work in young make-up. It was 70 days. Usually with make-ups like this it is 10 or 15 or maybe 20 days.” Even he was astounded by the results, observing, “When I saw the first clip I was shocked at how good it looked. I was pretty amazed at how well it worked.”\n\nSRK says, \"Nobody had done anything like this before. It was the first time using prosthetics to make someone look younger and in different circumstances and in India's weather. It was much more difficult.\""
