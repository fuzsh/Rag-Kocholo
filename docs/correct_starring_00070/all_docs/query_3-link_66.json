        "text": "Shah Rukh Khan, also known by the initials SRK, is one of the most prominent and influential actors in the history of Indian cinema. Often referred to as the “King of Bollywood,” he has appeared in more than 80 Hindi films and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. His life story is one of dramatic rise from humble beginnings to international stardom.\n\nEarly Life and Education:\n\nShah Rukh Khan was born on November 2, 1965, in New Delhi, India. His parents, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan and Lateef Fatima Khan, were of Pathan descent. His father was an entrepreneur and his mother was a magistrate as well as a social worker. Khan grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighborhood of Delhi and was educated at St. Columba’s School where he excelled in his studies and sports, especially in football.\n\nHowever, it was the theater and acting that drew his interest. He studied at Hansraj College and earned his bachelor’s degree in Economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi’s Theatre Action Group (TAG), where he learned acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John.\n\nEarly Career in Television:\n\nAfter the death of his parents in the early 1980s, Khan moved to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in acting. He started his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His first starring role was in the television series “Fauji” (1988), where he played the role of a commando. This was followed by roles in other TV shows like “Circus” and “Wagle Ki Duniya.”\n\nBollywood Success:\n\nShah Rukh made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with “Deewana.” The film was a box office hit and launched his career in the Indian film industry. He initially played roles in films that portrayed him as the romantic hero, but it was his willingness to take on negative roles in films like “Baazigar” (1993) and “Darr” (1993) that set him apart from his peers.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, Khan starred in a series of blockbuster films, including “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” (1995), “Dil To Pagal Hai” (1997), “Kuch Kuch Hota Hai” (1998), and “Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham” (2001). These films, among others, established him as a leading actor in Bollywood.\n\nBeyond Acting:\n\nBeyond acting, Shah Rukh Khan is known for his business acumen; he co-owns the production company Red Chillies Entertainment and the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders. His charisma and charm have made him a beloved public figure, not just in India but around the world.\n\nPersonal Life:\n\nShah Rukh is married to Gauri Khan, an interior designer and film producer. They met in Delhi before Shah Rukh became a star, and they married in 1991. The couple has three children: Aryan, Suhana, and AbRam.\n\nGlobal Recognition:\n\nKhan has a massive fan base globally and has been referred to as the world’s biggest movie star by various international media sources. His contributions to film and his charismatic personality have earned him numerous honors, including the Padma Shri by the Government of India and the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the Government of France.\n\nShah Rukh Khan continues"
