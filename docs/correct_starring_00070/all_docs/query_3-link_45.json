        "text": "Who accepts to play a negative role at the beginning of his career? Definitely not the one who wants to \"rule on the city one day\", right? You're wrong.\n\nIn an industry where it's as easy as a pie to get typecast in a role and thereafter as difficult as walking through a patch of thorns to get out of that image, Shah Rukh Khan, the king of Bollywood, accepted negative roles in Darr and Baazigar that everyone else including actors like Sunny Deol, Ajay Devgn and Aamir Khan rejected, and proved \"Agar kisi cheez ko dil se chaho; to puri kainaat usse tumse milane ki koshish mein lag jaati hai\"\n\nIn his second innings as well, he is once again set to take risks. After the action hero in Pathaan, he is going to be seen playing a negative role in Jawan - not the one that people will hate to the core but the one that we are supposed to hate but secretly fall in love with like Ganesh Gaitonde from Sacred Games or Walter White from Breaking Bad.\n\nAlso Read: 11 Thrilling Details About 'Jawan' You Should Know If You Call Yourself A Shah Rukh Khan Fan\n\nNot just a negative role, SRK is playing double roles in the film too.\n\nShah Rukh Khan in double roles\n\nAlso Read: An Outsider To King Of Bollywood: How Shah Rukh Khan Became A Living Legend To Millions Of Fans\n\nBefore Shah Rukh Khan's Jawan, here's a look at some iconic films in which he played dual roles!\n\n1. Duplicate\n\nIn this Mahesh Bhatt directorial which also stars Juhi Chawla and Sonali Bendre, Shah Rukh Khan plays a naive chef and his criminal doppelganger. Bablu and Manu are poles apart from each other but quite menacing too. The film was a sleeper hit.\n\n2. Paheli\n\nPaheli is a story of a ghost who falls in love with a newlywed. Shah Rukh Khan plays the role of both the ghost and the newlywed's - played by Rani Mukerji - husband.\n\n3. Don\n\nIn this epic film whose next installment has been delayed for years that now rumours suggest Ranveer Singh might be cast in it, Khan not only played a negative role but also dual roles. While one was a ruthless don, the other one was an innocent commoner.\n\n4. Om Shanti Om\n\nBased on the concept of re-birth, in this Farah Khan film that marked the debut of Deepika Padukone, Shah Rukh Khan plays Om Prakash Makhija, a junior artist and Om Kapoor, a superstar.\n\n5. Fan\n\nThis was one of the unforgettable double roles that SRK ever played. In this one, he plays a superstar Aryan Khan and his obsessed fan Gaurav Chandna, who beats up a rival actor to appease Aryan, but is instead punished. Heartbroken, he plans revenge.\n\n6. Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi\n\nIn Anushka Sharma's debut movie, Shah Rukh Khan played dual roles of Raj and Surinder Suri to woo his own wife.\n\n7. Ra. One\n\nThe film that everyone was talking about after the release of Adipurush, for its VFX and 'Ravan' inspiration, SRK plays the double roles of a scientist and his virtual character.\n\n8. Karan Arjun\n\nAnother OG film based on the concept of reincarnation starred Salman and Shah Rukh Khan both in double roles. When Karan and Arjun die at the hands of Thakur Durjan Singh, their mother prays \"aayenge, mere karan arjun aayenge\". Reincarnated as Vijay and Ajay, they seek revenge.\n\n9. English Babu Desi Mem\n\nNot two, but he played three roles in this one. Shah Rukh is seen as a father, a millionaire named Gopal Mayur and his son Hari Mayur who elopes and marries a girl. When they both die in fire, Vikram Mayur (played by SRK) comes in the scene to protect their only heir, Hari and Katariya's (Rajeshwari Sachdev's) son.\n\nIn Jawan, he will be seen in a deadly villainous avatar much like Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. Are you excited?"
