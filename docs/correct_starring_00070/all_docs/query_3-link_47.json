        "text": "Shah Rukh Khan knows how to make an entrance. In fact, he’s so skilled at it that the makers of Jawan gave him multiple; each one eliciting deafening applause from the star-struck audience.\n\nBut the best Shah Rukh Khan entries are the ones that no one saw coming. While the actor has — in the truest sense of the word — main character energy, he’s also delighted in surprising his fans with some memorable cameos in the past. Give the man a two-minute screen time, and he’ll end up stealing the show. While SRK’s cameos in popular movies like Brahmastra (2022) and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016) are well-known, there are a series of Bollywood films he’s popped up in where you probably missed him. As the superstar turns 58 today, we take a look at some of the lesser-known cameos he’s made over the course of his career.\n\n7 memorable Shah Rukh Khan cameos you probably missed\n\n1. Luck By Chance (2009)\n\nZoya Akhtar’s 2009 film starring Farhan Akhtar was decidedly ahead of its times. The story chronicles the journey of a struggling actor trying to make it big in Bollywood, with several stars making an appearance in the first half of the movie. But it's in the second half when Vikram (Akhtar) and a few of his actor-friends are out for dinner and providence (or the upscale dining place in question) brings him in front of Shah Rukh Khan, who tells him to never forget the people who stood by him when he was nothing.\n\n2. Rocketry: The Nambi Effect (2022)\n\nInterestingly, this particular cameo marked SRK’s return to the big screen after four long years. R. Madhavan’s directorial debut saw him also donning the role of the lead character — Nambi Narayanan, the ISRO scientist who was wrongly accused of espionage. The scene with Shah Rukh Khan comes at the end, with the superstar playing himself as he interviews Narayanan about the allegations.\n\n3. Tubelight (2017)\n\nKabir Khan’s 2017 directorial starring Salman Khan was reportedly inspired by the movie Little Boy (2015). While Salman plays Laxman, a young man on the hunt for his brother who was drafted in the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Shah Rukh Khan makes a powerful cameo as Goga Pasha, a magician who helps him in his mission.\n\n4. Pehla Nasha (1993)\n\nStarring Deepak Tijori, Pooja Bhatt, and Raveena Tandon, Pehla Nasha is a 1993 movie about a struggling actor who becomes obsessed with his two beautiful neighbours. What many don’t know is that the movie featured cameos by Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Aamir Khan, where they all plugged their movies. In his cameo, SRK tells Deepak: “Tumne toh Chamatkar kardiya, Gentleman. Main toh tumhara Deewana hogaya”. Chamatkar, Deewana, and Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman were all SRK films that were released in 1992.\n\n5. Shahrukh Bola \"Khoobsurat Hai Tu\" (2010)\n\nShahrukh Khan’s cameo in Makrand Deshpande’s 2010 film was integral. Not only did the actor warm hearts in the scene where he tells a flower girl “khoobsurat hai tu” — the film’s entire USP — he even offered for the director to use his house and car in some of the shots.\n\n6. Saathiya (2002)\n\nAlthough the movie starred Rani Mukerji and Vivek Oberoi, powerful cameos by Shah Rukh Khan and Tabu stole the show, SRK plays Yeshwant Rao, an IAS officer, and deeply compassionate husband to Savitri (Tabu), the woman who accidentally hit Suhani (Mukerji) with her car.\n\n7. Achanak (1998)\n\nGovinda featured as one of Bollywood’s icons in the 90s, and like most of his films, Achanak had his loyal fans flocking to the halls. But the audience was in for a surprise when a young, spunky Shah Rukh Khan made a cameo; tweaking his trademark line. After a scene where a character breaks through a wall of glass, SRK is heard saying: “Koi baat nahi, aisi badi badi shootings mein, glass tutti rehti hain”."
