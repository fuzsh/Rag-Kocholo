        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn 1977, Star Wars exploded onto screens and caused industry and cultural shifts like no other work of popular art before or since.\n\nAt 13 years old, I was one of the instant phenomenon’s opening-year audience members. I’ve written about this before: As the film segued to its end credits, my legs went totally numb.\n\nLiterally.\n\nMy parents and two brothers left the theater and headed to the lobby. I could not move. I was thunderstruck.\n\nBy a movie.\n\nIt happened for the first time when I was 13. Against all expectations it happened again… when I was 58.\n\nEnter RRR and my life-changing introduction to Indian cinema.\n\nBefore we go there, however, a brief primer of Indian cinema proper, for those unfamiliar, is in order."
