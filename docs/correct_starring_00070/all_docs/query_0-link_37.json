        "text": "Farah Khan's film Om Shanti Om was released on November 9, 2007. 15 years later, the film was re-released in cinemas today, November 17. Starring Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone, the film was a hit upon its release. It marked Deepika's big Bollywood debut. The actress recently completed 15 years in the Hindi film industry. Talking about Om Shanti Om, the film will be screened in 20 cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Patna, Bhopal, and Ahmedabad.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOM SHANTI OM RE-RELEASES IN CINEMAS\n\nAccording to media reports, the idea of Om Shanti Om's re-release was an initiative planned by Shah Rukh's biggest fan club - SRK Universe. It was only a few days ago when SRK's film, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, was re-released in theatres. The film set a huge record upon its re-release by minting Rs 25 lakh at the box office.\n\nAfter the release of Om Shanti Om, SRK and Deepika shared screen space with each other in Happy New Year and Rohit Shetty's Chennai Express. Both movies did well at the ticket window.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT FOR DEEPIKA, SRK?\n\nOn the movie front, SRK and Deepika will next be seen in Pathaan. Directed by Siddharth Anand, the film also stars John Abraham and it is scheduled for release on January 25, 2023. The teaser of the film was released on SRK's birthday, November 2.\n\nBesides Pathaan, Shah Rukh will be seen in Jawan with Nayanthara. The film is directed by Atlee and it will release on June 2, 2023. The superstar also has Dunki with Taapsee Pannu lined up.\n\nOn the other hand, Deepika has Siddharth Anand's Fighter with Hrithik Roshan. The actress will also be seen in Project K with Prabhas. She also has The Intern's Hindi remake with Amitabh Bachchan lined up."
