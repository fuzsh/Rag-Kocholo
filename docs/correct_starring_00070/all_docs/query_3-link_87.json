        "text": "When we think of Shah Rukh Khan, we often associate him with the iconic image of the romantic hero, known as the 'King of Romance.' However, have you ever realised that beneath that charismatic smile lies an enchanting talent for portraying some of bollywood's most memorable antagonists?\n\nThe bollywood superstar, often referred to as the 'Badshah of bollywood,' fearlessly embraced negative roles in his earlier works and even managed to revive the allure of a villain later in his career. As King Khan approaches his 58th birthday, it's worth revisiting some of his outstanding villainous performances that ultimately made us cheer for the antagonist.\n\n1. ‘Darr’\n\nAny compilation of Shah Rukh Khan's antagonistic portrayals wouldn't be complete without recalling his role as the obsessive Rahul Mehra. Back in 1993 King Khan collaborated with director Yash Chopra to bring to life the character of a cynically obsessed one-sided lover in a thriller drama. This portrayal of Rahul Mehra garnered him a string of awards and firmly established his reputation as an exceptional talent in the world of cinema. The character of SRK became iconic, enduring elements that continue to resonate with his dedicated fan base.\n\n2. ‘Baazigar’\n\nShah Rukh Khan has an innate talent for keeping the audience on the edge of their seats with his knack for delivering unexpected plot twists. In the 1993 crime thriller ‘Baazigar,’ he plays Ajay Sharma, a young man driven by a desire for retribution against those who have harmed his family. His portrayal of a charismatic yet ruthless anti-hero, executing a sinister scheme involving a string of murders, not only captured hearts but also left viewers with restless nights.\n\n3. ‘Fan’\n\nIn the 2016 psychological thriller 'Fan,' Shah Rukh Khan delivers a remarkable performance that blurs the distinction between a fan and a nemesis. He plays a double role, playing superstar Aryan Khanna and his obsessive admirer Gaurav Chandna. The story revolves around the dangerous consequences of extreme fandom when Gaurav's unwavering love turns into an obsession, leading to a path of revenge and chaos.\n\n4. ‘Anjaam’\n\nIn the 1994 drama film 'Anjaam,' Shah Rukh Khan portrayed the character of a wealthy businessman named Vijay Agnihotri. The film followed a theme akin to 'Darr,' once again transforming King Khan into a one-sided psychopath. Although the movie achieved moderate success at the box office, it couldn't quite surpass the records set by his earlier hits. Nevertheless, SRK's performance received considerable critical acclaim, earning him awards for his compelling portrayal of a negative character.\n\nDon't Miss:25 Years Of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai: Iconic Dialogues From The Movie That Still Echo In Our Hearts\n\n5. ‘Don’\n\nShah Rukh Khan brought us the contemporary adaptation of the beloved Hindi film 'Don.' In this action-packed thriller, the actor astounded audiences with his portrayal, reaffirming his status as a bad boy on screen. While the movie had a modest response at the box office initially, it gradually gained a devoted following and evolved into a cult classic over the years. For those unversed, now Ranveer Singh will be next playing the character of Don.\n\nDon't Miss:Happy Birthday Ishaan Khatter: 6 Fascinating Lesser-Known Facts About The Bollywood Sensation\n\nYour skin and body like you are unique.
