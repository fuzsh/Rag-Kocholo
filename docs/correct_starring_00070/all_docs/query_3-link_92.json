        "text": "Shah Rukh Khan has been ruling over Bollywood for decades. The superstar had a smashing 2023 with two blockbusters, Pathaan and Jawan, alongside an epic cameo in Tiger 3 with his third film of the year Dunki is set to end the year for SRK on a grand note. While Khan is known for his innate passion behind every film he undertakes, there was a time when Shah Rukh starred in a movie solely for money.\n\nThe brutally honest reason why Shah Rukh Khan did only one film for money:\n\nDuring an appearance on Yaaron Ki Baraat in 2016, Shah Rukh Khan disclosed that there's one film in his career that he did solely for financial reasons. According to Indian Express, the 58-year-old superstar didn’t name the aforementioned film but confessed (Note: Translated from Hindi to English), “I won’t take the name, but there’s only one film that I did for money. I’ve done 60 films so far. I knew, and I told my producer too… I had bought a house with that film’s fees, I was in dire need of the money… I didn’t have the heart to do that film, however, I have only starred in one film until now, where I sold my conscience for money.”\n\nHowever, Shah Rukh Khan is a man of his word and didn’t let his guilty conscience get the better of him: “When my financial situation became more stable, and I started buying back my films, that was the first film I bought back. I felt as if I returned that film’s payment.”\n\nBefore moving into their grand mansion Mannat, SRK and Gauri Khan used to live in a 3 BHK sea-facing flat in Bandra."
