        "text": "In Farah Khan’s ode to the Hindi film industry titled Om Shanti Om, Shah Rukh Khan played the character of Om Prakash Makhija, a struggling actor who gets reborn as a star kid and a superstar himself Om Kapoor.\n\nIn the film, Arjun Rampal played the character of big shot film producer Mukesh Mehra, the film’s main antagonist.\n\nWhile Arjun’s character is present throughout the film, he interacts only with Om Kapoor and doesn’t share a scene with Om Prakash Makhija.\n\nAnd according to Arjun, the reincarnated Om played by Shah Rukh Khan was “irritating”.\n\nIt so happened that during a recent interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Arjun was asked about his take on nepotism in the Hindi film industry.\n\nHe replied, “I've had many arguments on nepotism with a lot of people. Yes, there is definitely a huge advantage that a person from a film family has; if they want to join the profession, they surely have a head start. They would maybe get more chances than another person, but that's the destiny of that person. You don't choose the family that you're born into.”\n\nThe host then pointed out that Shah Rukh Khan’s character in Om Shanti Om was a nepo baby. To this, Arjun stated, “When he (Shah Rukh Khan’s character) is born the second time, he becomes a nepo. It was an irritating character.”\n\nOn the same note, he was also asked about how he would feel if his kids join the film industry. Arjun replied, “I think Mahikaa is quite keen. She has studied it and trained in it, because I told her that’s the best way to do it. But finally, it’s up to them– what they want to do and how they want to find themselves.”"
