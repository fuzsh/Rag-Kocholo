        "text": "Abhishek Bachchan will star alongside Shah Rukh Khan in King, Amitabh Bachchan announced. He expressed excitement, stating it's the right time for this collaboration. The news confirms Abhishek's pivotal role in the upcoming film, promising an intriguing on-screen face-off with King Khan. Directed by Sujoy Ghosh with Siddharth Anand overseeing the action, Amitabh praised Abhishek's previous portrayal of antagonistic roles, citing his performance in 'Raavan.'\n\nAmitabh wrote, \"All the best Abhishek… It is TIME!!!\"\n\nAccording to Peeping Moon, \"Abhishek is an actor whose full potential has yet to be fully realized. He has the ability to astonish audiences when given complex roles. King presents him in an out-and-out negative role for the first time in such a large-scale commercial movie, and he is sure to make a significant impact with his performance. The Jr. Bachchan was surprised when he was offered this role but accepted it immediately, intrigued by the depth of his character. It’s a special role, and Siddharth Anand has grand plans to present Abhishek in a manner audiences have never seen before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, filming for the movie is scheduled to commence in May this year. Siddharth Anand and Sujoy Ghosh have maintained regular communication with Shah Rukh Khan and Suhana Khan, holding several meetings between October 2023 and February 2024.\n\nReportedly, the training sessions are taking place at Mannat, where Suhana is joined by Shah Rukh Khan, for certain practice sessions. Renowned international trainers are coming together to coach both Suhana and SRK, as King will delve into a more rugged style of action. Sujoy has already begun casting for the supporting roles, aiming to kick off production in May 2024 and position it as Shah Rukh Khan's major cinematic offering for 2025. Siddharth is concentrating on creating high-caliber action sequences in collaboration with Sujoy and SRK.\n\nPinkvilla earlier reported, the plot of King will distinguish itself with a unique action style, contrasting Shah Rukh Khan's previous roles in Pathaan and Jawan. It promises sleek action sequences and intense chase scenes, embedded within an emotionally driven storyline filled with twists and turns. Sujoy Ghosh's direction is pivotal in bringing this multifaceted narrative to life.\n\nALSO READ: Kim Kardashian Brutally Trolled For Using Lord Ganesha Idol As Prop In Photoshoot, Deletes Photo"
