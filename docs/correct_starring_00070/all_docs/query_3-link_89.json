        "meta_description": "Shah Rukh Khan's much-awaited film 'Jawan' has finally hit the screens and took the box office by storm. While garnering extremely positive reviews, the action flick received a record-breaking opening. In the film, SRK's body double for the past 17 years, Prashant Walde has helped the 'Pathaan' actor a lot to play a double role and stand out against all odds. While spilling some on-set secrets, during a conversation with AajTak, Prashant said, 'There is a scene where Shah Rukh is hugging his look-alike father. A very interesting incident happened here during the shoot.' He further shared, 'When he was in a young getup, I was in the form of old Shah Rukh. Whereas when he became old, I had to take the getup of young. So that only his close-up shot can be done with the camera. Shah Rukh’s looks in this film were quite different, due to which we had to prepare daily. Only two looks were shot in a day.' Helmed by Atlee, 'Jawan' is a high-octane action thriller that outlines the emotional journey of a man, who is set to rectify the wrongs in society. Apart from Shah Rukh, the film also stars Nayanthara in the lead, Vijay Sethupathi as the antagonist, and Sanya Malhotra and Priyamani in pivotal roles.
