        "text": "Shah Rukh Khan starrer King is one of the highly-anticipated films of 2025. King Khan will be seen sharing screen space with his daughter Suhana Khan in the same. And now, the makers have roped in Abhishek Bachchan to play the villain in the film. Yes, it will be SRK vs Junior Bachchan in Sujoy Ghosh's directorial film.\n\nOn July 15, Peeping Moon quoted a source saying, \"King presents him (Abhishek Bachchan) in an out-an-out negative role for the first time in such a large-scale commercial movie, and he is sure to make a significant impact with his performance.\" The report further added that Abhishek was 'surprised' when he was first offered the role but accepted it immediately. Junior Bachchan will be seen in a never-seen-before avatar in King.\n\nOn July 16, Amitabh Bachchan confirmed reports about his son joining SRK and Suhana in King. Reacting to a fan's post, Big B wrote, \"all the best Abhishek... It is TIME!!\"\n\nAbhishek Bachchan has been a part of movies like Dasvi, Guru, Dostana, and Ghoomer among others.\n\nComing back to King, it will reportedly go on the floors later this year. The Sujoy Ghosh directorial will feature some over-the-top action sequences directed by Siddharth Anand, who helmed SRK's blockbuster film Pathaan.\n\nOn the other hand, the upcoming film will mark SRK and Suhana's first onscreen collaboration. Suhana made her Bollywood debut with Zoya Akhtar's Netflix film, The Archies. King will mark her debut on the big screen."
