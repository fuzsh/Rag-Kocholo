Rizvan’s journey takes him from the 30,000-strong town of Banville in California to the 204-strong village of Wilhelmina in Georgia.

He was out of the city with his wife Gauri Khan during the first protest in the Mumbai while his mother in law was at home with his children and also his sister was at home so he was very worried about them and got too emotional. Saamna editorial asked him to go to Karachi and Islamabad to play cricket with the Pakistanis to Uddhav Thackeray comparing him to Ajmal Kasab when he said, “Kasab and Shah Rukh are the most secure people in Mumbai.” Shah Rukh Khan did not bend his knees in front of Shiv Sena and country accepted him by making his movie a big hit of the year.
