        "text": "Sorry, guys for posting this bit late. Had watched this movie last night but this holiday season kept me on the bed till now haha..\n\nAnyways, back to the movie.\n\nFarah Khan, I still remember her not so good but super hit masala film Main Hoon Na. I was very disappointed with the film and I was expecting the same kind of thing from her next movie, Om Shanti Om. I knew it is going to have all typical bollywood masala stuff with no logic and all, and to the extent the movie was all about that only but the only changed thing was, I liked the movie. Yes, I did like it despite of all illogical 2nd half. Let me just quickly take you through the story and then come on to why I liked the movie.\n\nThe story is very straight forward. Om (Shahrukh Khan) junior artist of 70s era falls in love with superstar Shanti (Deepika Padukone) and later he finds out that she was already married to the producer Mukesh Mehra (Arjun Rampal). Mukesh Mehra who eventually kills Shanti after finding out that she is pregnant (Her pregnancy ruined his film project “Om Shanti Om”). Om tries to save her but both of them could not survive. 30 years later.. Om Kapoor the superstar (Shahrukh Khan) visits that place (Where Shanti had died) for shooting purpose and suddenly he starts recollecting everything which happened in his past life. Now, his mission is to reunite with his Past life mother (Krron Kher) and friend Pappu (Shreyas Talpade), find the girl who looks like Shanti, (They found her also, Sandy – Deepika Padukone) AND punish Mukesh Mehra (Who is now well known producer of Hollywood, known as Mike). Rest is for you to watch.\n\nOkay, now it’s review time.\n\nThe movie gears with great start in the first half, the way 70s era was shown was fantastic, everything was just perfect but the movie falls down badly in the 2nd half. The direction in the 2nd half is exactly opposite of 1st half. Very poor direction, infact I am sure director must have got confused in what she was trying to portray. It was looking as if the scenes were just shot for the songs. Take example of the song, Dard E Disco, to show that stupid song, they had to waste whole 5 minutes, just to start that song (they had some stupid scene added to have that song in the movie). Pointless song, they could have shown that in the end. The whole filmfare awards thing in 2nd half was also pointless, Om Kapoor was being awarded as best actor for his stupid acting. (Check his nominations), again this whole thing was created just to show the song Om Shanti Om (with 31 film stars), now that’s a different story that the song was a treat. But again, they could have shown it as some birthday party song or something.\n\nNow, there were few more blunders and flaws. Apart from bad portrayal of Om Kapoor in the 2nd half, the character of Sandy was also very poorly portrayed, damn.. I don’t understand what the hell she was doing without any good dialogues.. all I could see was, she trying out new clothes and staring with those killing eyes. No chemistry between Om and Sandy.\n\nNow, if you ask me what were the good parts of the movie. Well, the good parts were the bad points I have just mentioned above. What the hell? Why? How come? Because all these stupid things have one big factor involved, i.e. ENTERTAINMENT. Aam Janta does not understand these things much nor they will go so much deep into it. They came to watch SRK doing stupid things and make them laugh. They came to watch SRK showing his six-pack abs, they came to watch those 31 stars dancing with SRK. And that’s it. They don’t care, why Sandy do not have more lines, they do not care why Om Kapoor was superstar.. they do not care about the logic in the 2nd half.\n\nThey got all they wanted and that’s it. Movie is a hit, paisa wasool. SRK got what he wanted, public got what they wanted. So why to worry about those 10% who did not like the movie or found the 2nd half stupid.\n\nThe only reason I liked the movie was, it’s entertainment factor. Despite of 2nd half being awful, it made me laugh, it made me tap my feet on couple of songs. And that’s what i call paisa wasool movie. SRK knows how to make money out of the worst things too.\n\nOkay, let’s sum up the things.\n\nOn the acting front, SRK ruled like always… (though he was not good in 2nd half). Deepika Padukone was excellent in 1st half. She looked like a cutie pie. Again, like SRK, she was not at all good in 2nd half. Krron Kher was good, Shreyas Talpade was good in 1st half. Arjun Rampal gave one of his better performances.\n\nMusic was very impressive, Music played a major role in the movie. Direction was very poor (last category) in the 2nd half but SRK handled everything on his shoulders, and we will see the results in couple of weeks.\n\nSo, overall, the movie was total time pass, with high entertainment value. The movie will be loved by aam janta. The movie surely deserves atleast [rating:3/5] BUT if you ask for my personal rating, I would simply rated it [rating:1.5/5] This is just because technically speaking, 2nd half was pathetic but it works the other way in India."
