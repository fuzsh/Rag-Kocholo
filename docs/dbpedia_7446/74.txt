A tale loved by many from one of Britain’s best-known authors, this wonderful new edition of The Sheep-Pig comes with a delightful introduction by Michael Morpurgo. The Sheep-Pig is one of Dick King-Smith’s most famous tales. It shot to further fame when the film adaptation, Babe, was released in 1995.

‘Why can’t I learn to be a Sheep-Pig?’

When Babe, the little orphaned piglet, is won at a fair by Farmer Hogget, he is adopted by Fly, the kind-hearted sheep-dog. Babe is determined to learn everything he can from Fly. He knows he can’t be a sheep-dog. But maybe, just maybe, he might be a sheep-pig.
