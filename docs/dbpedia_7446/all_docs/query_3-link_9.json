        "text": "Where the Wild Things Are\n\nby Maurice Sendak\n\nISBN: 9780060254933\n\nAuthor Maurice Sendak offers a tale of suspense, action, and fun, with this story about a young boy named Max who wears a wolf suit to bed. Max has been naughty and is sent to bed without any dinner. The real adventure begins with the forest growing and creatures appearing as wild and free. Being wild with the wild things can be tiring, as Max discovers on his adventure. As things begin to happen in his room, creatures appear that are a cross between scary and funny.

Shel Silverstein tells the story of love between a boy and a tree that is an example of this sacrificial love. From the time the boy is young and needs shade as he plays to growing up and being allowed to climb in her branches to the time when he is older and wants something that may mean the end of the tree, the tree keeps on giving to him- out of love. Though there are many ways to interpret this story, the true message of love shines through. Even when the boy is an old man and long after the tree has been cut down, what is left of the tree is still giving. The old man, once the little boy who played under the tree, now uses the stump of the tree to rest on.\n\nGoodnight Moon\n\nby Margaret Wise Brown\n\nISBN: 9780064430173\n\nBedtime stories are a favorite among children and parents alike, and this is one of the most beloved bedtime stories of all time.

Nothing beats a good downpour, especially when it consists of fun and yummy treats, right?

Judy and Ron Barrett bring this fantasy to life with a spin that you might be surprised at.
