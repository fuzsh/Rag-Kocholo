        "text": "It was strange timing that found us finishing up one of the more famous of Mr. King-Smith’s books when we found out he had passed away. We’ve enjoyed so many of his stories but this one is definitely a favorite with my boys when they are younger (ages 4-6). It’s also a great book for kids to pick up and read to themselves a few years later.\n\nBabe, the Gallant Pig\n\nby Dick King-Smith\n\nillustrated by Maggie Kneen\n\npublished 1983\n\nThe chapters are short enough to read two in one fifteen-minute time slot, or even one chapter at bedtime every night for almost two weeks. We’ve been reading it at lunch time and it’s so much fun to look up from the page and catch my boys with the fork halfway to their mouths, forgotten, as they are caught up in the story.\n\nBabe, a very young pig, finds himself at the home of a quiet sheep-farmer named Mr. Hoggett (wink). He develops a mother-son relationship with the sheep-dog on the farm, Fly, and over time has some adventures in learning to become a sheep-pig. The humor is wonderful — not slap-stick but more subtle and intelligent. It assumes the children reading the book (or hearing it) have some native ability to think. The boys also laugh out loud at the contrast between the taciturn farmer Mr. Hoggett and his chattering wife.\n\nBabe himself is so amazingly sweet and polite. He’s cheerful and perseveres even though it is a bit ridiculous to have a pig herding sheep around the pasture and in contests with true sheep-dogs.\n\nWe’ve read plenty of other pig stories over the years (Charlotte’s Web, Piggies, If You Give a Pig a Pancake) but few pigs are as endearing as little Babe is. Definitely a family favorite and worthy of the 90 minutes it will take to read aloud!\n\n(N.B. The edition we read this last week included the official name for a female dog which is a word that has come to have quite a different, unpleasant meaning in modern day America. I changed the word to “momma” when reading it aloud. I don’t remember it being written that way previously but I do often edit a few words here and there when reading a book aloud, depending on the age of my audience! Certainly I won’t hand this book over to my 9-year old to read to himself without an explanation.)"
