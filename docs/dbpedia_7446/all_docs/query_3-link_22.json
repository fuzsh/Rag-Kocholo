But when the Big Bad Wolf comes looking for a snack, he huffs and puffs the first little pig right out of the story . . . and into the realm of pure imagination!\n\nTell the Truth B.B. Wolf\n\nBig Bad Wolf’s first visit to his local library (as related in Mind Your Manners, B.B. Wolf) was such a success that he returns to tell his version of “The Three Little Pigs.” His outrageous spin on the tale draws skeptical remarks from his audience: “Isn’t that wolf’s nose getting longer?” asks Pinocchio. “It’s a cooked-up, half-baked tale,” snaps the Gingerbread Boy. And “Tell the truth, B.B. Wolf!” squeal the Three Little Pigs. Caught in his own lie, B.B. explains that he is a reformed villain: “Now I’m begging on my knees, Little Pigs, forgive me, please!” How B.B. turns his bad old deed into a good new one provides a happy ending to this fun-to-read fractured fairytale.\n\nThe Three Little Pigs\n\nJames Marshall retells the familiar tale in which one of three pigs survives a wolf’s attacks by using his head.\n\nThe Three Little Pigs\n\nThree little pigs are happily working away in their delicious family business — making the best-tasting waffles in the world. Business is so good, in fact, that the three siblings can live comfortably in their very own homes — Percy in his straw bungalow, Pete in his log cabin, and Prudence in her brick cottage. Then Tempesto, the meanest wolf on the block, shows up and wants more than waffles for breakfast — he wants the three little pigs!\n\nThe True Story of the 3 Little Pigs\n\nYou thought you knew the story of the “The Three Little Pigs”… You thought wrong. In this hysterical and clever fracture fairy tale picture book that twists point of view and perspective, young readers will finally hear the other side of the story of “The Three Little Pigs.”\n\nThe Three Little Pigs\n\n“Then I’ll HUFF and I’ll PUFF and I’ll blow your house down!” cried the wolf. Find out what happens when the three little pigs build homes made of straw, sticks, and bricks.\n\nThe Three Ninja Pigs\n\nWhy does this wolf think he can come to town and blow all the houses down? These three little pigs just aren’t going to take it from that bully anymore! The first starts aikido lessons—he’ll make mincemeat out of that wolf! His brother learns a little jujitsu–he’ll chop that guy to pieces! But when the wolf actually appears, it turns out these two pigs aren’t quite ready after all. Good thing their sister has been training every day to master some serious karate moves that save the day. KIYA!\n\nThe Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig\n\nWhen it comes time for the three little wolves to go out into the world and build themselves a house, their mother warns them to beware the big bad pig. But the little wolves’ increasingly sturdy dwellings are no match for the persistent porker, who has more up his sleeve than huffing and puffing. It takes a chance encounter with a flamingo pushing a wheelbarrow full of flowers to provide a surprising and satisfying solution to the little wolves’ housing crisis.\n\nNo Lie, Pigs (and Their Houses) Can Fly\n\nHe was a huffing, puffing wolf who caused the three little pigs some big-time headaches. End of story? Not quite. Get the full scoop from the wolf’s point of view in this lighthearted twist on the classic fairy tale.\n\nThe Three Little Fish and the Big Bad Shark\n\nMama tells her three little fish that it’s time to make their own homes. Jim builds his house of seaweed, but the big bad shark munches it up. Tim builds his house of sand, but the shark crunches it up. It’s smart Kim who sets up house in an old sunken ship!\n\nThe Three Little Bass and the Big Bad Gar\n\nWritten by a precocious 8 year old boy named James, this adorable adaptation of the classic Three Little Pigs story is a sweet twist with a fishy theme! Illustrated by his mother, a former Disney Animation graphic designer, this tale of three little bass fish living in Lake Gaston and the Big Bad Gar will delight young readers everywhere!\n\nThe Three Little Pigs and the Somewhat Bad Wolf\n\nWhen a farmer and his wife decide to move to Florida, they pay the three little pigs for their good work and send them on their way. And so begins the familiar adventure, with a comic twist. One pig spends his wages on potato chips, one buys “sody-pop,” and the third, “who was altogether un-pig-like,” buys building supplies. Teague’s take on the story includes a hapless wolf who is very hungry and only somewhat bad.\n\nWhere’s the Big Bad Wolf?\n\nWhenever there’s trouble on Detective Doggedly’s beat, that low-down, no-good, chicken-chasing, pig-poaching Big Bad Wolf is always the prime suspect. But when the three little pigs’ house is huffed and puffed into a pile of straw and only a sheep named Esmeralda is found at the scene of the crime, Doggedly has a new mystery to solve: Where’s the Big Bad Wolf? With the help of some wise elderly cows who live in a home across the road, Doggedly sniffs out the clues. But can he catch the culprit before the three little pigs get gobbled up?\n\nHuff & Puff\n\nThis interactive retelling of the Three Little Pigs story allows the reader to play the part of the big bad wolf. Three interior die-cut holes invite readers to huff, puff, and blow the pigs’ houses down! This fractured fairy tale ends sweetly when, rather than blowing down the third pig’s brick home, the wolf/reader blows out the candles on a cake baked by the pigs!\n\nWait! No Paint!\n\nThe three little pigs go off to build their separate houses one out of straw, one out of sticks, and one out of bricks. But wait! Who just spilled juice on the first little pig′s house? Why are the pigs turning green? And what is that mysterious Voice the pigs keep hearing?2\n\nThe Three Little Superpigs\n\nAfter defeating the Big Bad Wolf, the Three Little Superpigs spend their days fighting crime and enjoying their newfound fame. But one day, the Big Bad Wolf escapes from prison and plunges Fairyland into fear. Our curly-tailed friends soon discover that bricks are missing all over town. The Superpigs return to their homes to solve the mystery when they realize it has all been a trap!\n\nThe Three Little Superpigs: Once Upon a Time\n\nEveryone thinks they know how the Three Little Pigs defeated the Big Bad Wolf. But that’s not the whole story. The Three Little Pigs always dreamed of being superheroes. They wore superhero outfits and played superhero games. But when they move to Fairyland, they finally get to put their superhero skills to use! When the Big Bad Wolf blows down the houses of the first little pig and the second little pig, all seems lost. But, luckily, the third little pig comes up with a SUPER plan to save the day!\n\nThe Three Little Superpigs: Trick or Treat?\n\nIt’s time for Fairyland’s Halloween Parade! The festivities are sure to be extra sweet this year with the Superpigs leading the way as the guests of honor. But disaster strikes when a wicked witch steals all the Halloween candy to decorate her gingerbread house!\n\nIt’s up to the Three Little Superpigs to recover the candy in time for the parade, but not everything is as it seems in this Halloween heist. Will a familiar villain ruin the celebration before it even begins?\n\nIt’s Not the Three Little Pigs\n\nMeet the three (ahem—four!) little pigs as they convince the narrator to tell a slightly different version of their fairy tale: First, there’s Alan, the one pig in the bunch who is actually a builder. He’s got a BIG problem with building a home out of flimsy straw. Next, there’s Alfred, who wants to be an actor and wouldn’t dream of getting his hands dirty. Then we have Alvin, whose dream is to be…a pumpkin. Last but not least is Alison, the fourth pig, who is ready to bring some flair to this story—if only she can get the narrator to agree to a few changes…And what about that wolf? Grab your jetpacks and get ready for this rollicking retelling of the popular tale.\n\nThe Great Gran Plan\n\nIn this riff on Little Red Riding Hood, the pig from The Three Little Pigs gets mixed up in the Big Bad Wolf’s plot to eat Granny. Fortunately, Granny is a tough old bird who can take care of herself―and everyone else, too.\n\nThe 3 Little Dassies\n\nMimbi, Pimbi and Timbi hope to find “a place cooler, a place less crowded, a place safe from eagles!” to build their new homes. The handsomely dressed Agama Man watches from the borders as the eagle flies down to flap and clap until he blows a house down. But in a deliciously funny twist, that pesky eagle gets a fine comeuppance!\n\nThe Three Little Aliens and the Big Bad Robot\n\nGREEP BOINK MEEP! The three little aliens are happily settling into their new homes when the Big Bad Robot flies in to crack and smack and whack their houses down! A chase across the solar system follows in this humorous and visually stunning book.\n\nThe Three Little Gators\n\nA delightful retelling of the three little pigs story. Three little gators strike out on their own in an east Texas swamp. Their mother warns them to build strong houses that can protect them from Big-bottomed Boar, who likes to eat tasty, tender gators for his snack. Soon, First Gator builds himself a nice house out of rocks. Second Gator reckons rocks are too much work, so he builds his house with sticks. And Third Gator’s house of sand is the easiest one to build! But soon Big-bottomed Boar shows up. With a bump, bump, bump of the fierce boar’s rump, he knocks over Third Gator’s house of sand. It doesn’t take long for that rump to bump Second Gator’s house of sticks. But he can’t knock over Third Gator’s house of stones, so he tries another way in – through the chimney! Guess what happens to the Boar’s rump after that?!\n\nThree Little Cajun Pigs\n\nTrosclair, Thibodeaux, and Ulysse are three pigs with a whole lot to do. Their mom has just kicked them out of the house and it’s time they make their own way and start constructing new homes in the heart of the swamp. When ol’ Claude the gator comes sneaking along, however, the three brothers are forced to question their choice of construction materials!\n\nThe Three Little Javelinas\n\nEveryone knows the story of the three little pigs, but now you’re going to meet the three little javelinas – loveable, wild, southwestern cousins of pigs. Living in homes built out of tumbleweeds and saguaro ribs (from the fallen giant cacti), the first two javelinas are soon running from the hungry coyote, who had hoped to eat them with red chile sauce. And where do they go for shelter? Why, to their wise sister’s house, made strong with adobe bricks.\n\nThe Three Little Tamales\n\nWhile the three little tamales cool off on a windowsill, a tortilla rolls by. “You’ll be eaten. You’d better run!” he tells them. And so the tamales jump out the window. The first runs to the prairie and builds a house of sagebrush. The second runs to a cornfield and builds a house of cornstalks. The third runs to the desrt and builds a house of cactus. Then who should come along but Señor Lobo, the Big Bad Wolf, who plans to blow their houses down!\n\nPig Pigger Piggest\n\nWhen three scary witches decide they want the beautiful castles that three pigs have built for themselves, there are surprising results.\n\nOops! A Preston Pig Story\n\nThe cunning Mr. Wolf carefully stalks Preston, but each time he gets close, clumsy Preston unwittingly eludes his pursuer. Children will cheer for Preston the pig’s unlikely victory.\n\nToo Many Pigs and One Big Bad Wolf\n\nOnce upon a time, there were three little pigs. Then the wolf ate them. THE END.\n\nThis story is too short! I want a longer one!\n\nIn this clever counting book, the big bad wolf doesn’t want to tell a long story. He wants to get to the eating part. But the reader has other ideas. From a pig soccer team to a pig for every letter of the alphabet to 101 pigs in an animated movie, the stories get more and more fantastical . . . but they’re always too short and they ALL end the same way.\n\nThe Three Little Guinea Pigs\n\nOnce upon a time there were three little pigs… three little guinea pigs! Their names were Rosie, Minty, and Pumpkin. They lived with their mama in a cozy little house. Then they bid her a fond farewell and set off on their own. So far, so good….But what will they do if a hungry fox comes along? Will they go wheek, wheek, wheek all the way home? Or can they find a way to save their fluffy behinds?\n\nPenny, the Engineering Tail of the Fourth Little Pig\n\nPenny isn’t just the fourth little pig–she’s an engineer. So when big bad Wolfgang destroys her brothers’ homes, Penny comes to the rescue! When Wolfgang returns, Penny must use all her engineering know-how to save her family from his huffing and puffing.\n\nPrak Fills the House\n\nPrak is a practical pig who is often overlooked by her two older brothers: Mo the muscly one, and Bo the beautiful one. So when Poppa Pig offers his house to whichever of his children can fill it to the brim, everyone assumes Mo or Bo will be up for the task. No one expects Prak to have the strength or charisma to fill a house. But with a lot of creativity and a bit of luck, Prak might just surprise them all!\n\nThe Three Little Yogis and the Wolf Who Lost His Breath\n\nOnce upon a time there lived a wolf who lost his huff and his puff. It was a BIG, BAD problem!\n\nOne morning, the wolf came upon a peaceful little yogi doing sun salutations. The wolf wanted to huff and puff and blooow her hut down into a big pile of straw. But instead, the yogi suggested, “Let’s meditate on that!”\n\nSoon the wolf met a second yogi, and then a third. He may have lost his huff and puff—but with the help of three new yogi friends, can the wolf find his breath?\n\nProfessor Goose Debunks The Three Little Pigs\n\nMother Goose’s fairy tales are NOT based in science, and her great niece Professor Goose thinks it’s time to share the truth. Join Professor Goose as she — literally — travels through the pages of The Three Little Pigs, fact-checking, exposing the flaws and explaining the science. Did you know that pigs run in a zigzag pattern? And that there’s no way a wolf’s breath would be strong enough to blow down anything, even if he has his whole pack with him? And that hay bales are strong enough to resist most up, down and sideways forces? Sounds like the perfect material for building a house! . . . Or, not. But not to worry — Professor Goose is armed with helpful hints on how to make a structure strong enough to withstand hurricane forces!\n\nComparing and Contrasting Stories About The Three Little Pigs\n\nSince most of your students are probably familiar with the original version of The Three Little Pigs, comparing and contrasting different versions is a natural next step in the process.
