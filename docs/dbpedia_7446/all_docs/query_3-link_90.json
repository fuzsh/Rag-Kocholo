        "text": "I just received this letter from a Cozy Mystery Site reader:\n\n“Subject: Help with Author List\n\nDear Danna: I mostly read Christian fiction because it is clean and glorifies Christ. I read your web page definition of a cozy mystery and it said that “cozy mysteries are considered “gentle” books… no graphic violence, no profanity, and no explicit sex”. I tried a few books from your list and within the first chapter there was profanity. I guess not all authors follow the guidelines for a cozy mystery. If you know of any that are a good clean read please send me a list of the authors that do follow the guidelines.\n\nI appreciate any help you can give me.\n\nThank you, Tina”\n\nHere is my (+/-) answer:\n\nI know exactly what you are talking about… I recently finished a book by one of my favorite cozy authors, and had that very same problem! I wonder if their publishers tell them to “spice things up” these days…\n\nI just went through the site and found these authors who might be of interest to you.
