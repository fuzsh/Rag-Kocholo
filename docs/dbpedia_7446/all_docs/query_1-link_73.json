        "text": "Animal fantasies are among the most famous stories in children’s literature.\n\nIn these types of tales, animals talk, make decisions and solve problems that are common to the life situations of most people. \"Charlotte’s Web\" by E.B. White may be the most memorable animal fantasy ever written. Elementary-school children enjoy this genre of literature because it is entertaining and addresses problems that they encounter.\n\nDick King-Smith, an English writer, has crafted a delightful story about an animal wanting to become greater. The name of this engaging fantasy is \"Babe: The Gallant Pig.\"\n\nMr. Hogget is an English sheep farmer. Little given to speech, he works his farm with diligence and the assistance of an outstanding collie named Fly. In short order, Fly can encircle a herd of sheep and drive them into holding pens. The sheep are terrified of Fly because she bites them when they don’t move fast enough. Being sheep, they do not have highly-developed intellects, and constantly bleat out the word \"wolf\" each time they see a dog. Fly holds all sheep in contempt for their low I.Q.’s.\n\nWhen Mr. Hogget goes to town one day, he sees a pig being given away. Though he doesn’t raise pigs, this pig is free if you will pay 10 pence and guess the correct weight. The pig has an interesting look about him, so the farmer pays the money and guesses 31 pounds and a quarter. Much to his surprise, his estimate is completely accurate, and he wins the pig.\n\nThe new pig is introduced to Fly in the barn and soon loves her like his own mother. When asked his name, the pig says his first mother simply called him Babe. Fly takes a liking to the little porker and takes him all around the farm. When Babe sees Fly, whom he calls Ma, rounding up the sheep, he makes a momentous decision. He too will round up the sheep by becoming a sheep-pig.\n\nBut the first day Babe tries to round up the sheep, he discovers that a pig cannot run as fast as sheep or dogs. So he sits down and begins conversing with the sheep. Stunned that anyone would treat them with kindness, the sheep immediately obey Babe and quickly go down to the pen. Farmer Hogget carefully watches this and begins to hatch a plan. Each day Babe gets better and better at rounding up the sheep, and discovers the secret password that will get the sheep to follow him anywhere. Sensing something special, Mr. Hogget loads Babe into his ancient Land Rover and enters him in the National Sheepdog Trials. But will the officials allow a sheep-pig to enter the National Sheepdog Trials? The tension builds.\n\nWhat happens to Babe at the National Trials? Does the password change the way the new sheep react to him? Can he chug along fast enough to keep up with the sheep? Will the judges accept such an unusual entry? Have you ever done anything really out of the ordinary like this? What finally happens? To find out go to the library and check out this highly entertaining animal fantasy, \"Babe the Gallant Pig.\"\n\nThis story is simply delightful. The author understands that childhood should have a time of wonderful innocence. You can’t help but root for the chubby Babe as he attempts to transform himself into a sheep-pig. Dick King-Smith knows how to keep middle grade students laughing as they follow Babe’s exploits. I hope you get a chance to read this funny book."
