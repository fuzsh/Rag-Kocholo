        "text": "Uhoh, time is running away with me!! As usual, orchard season hit like a typhoon and life suddenly got insanely busy. You’d think I’d be prepared for it by now, considering this is my 8th season working there, but ah well haha Still working my way through reviewing some June books!!\n\nNancy’s Mysterious Letter by Carolyn Keene\n\nSeries: Nancy Drew #8\n\nPublished: 1932/1968\n\nRating: 3.5*\n\nOverall not a bad mystery, but the coincidence level was high on this one!! There was also a random influx of bad guys at the end (like throughout it seemed like the bad guy was working alone, but apparently he had a lil mini-gang or something?? Henchmen??) that felt kind of abrupt. But I still really enjoyed reading this one. Like I’ve said, these are nostalgia-heavy, so I’m not really here to judge them too hard haha\n\nThings Jolie Needs to Do Before She Bites It by Kerry Winfrey\n\nPublished: 2018\n\nRating: 3.5*\n\nFirst off, winner of the longest book title goes to…\n\nI’ve mentioned this before, but sometimes I read YA that makes me remember that I am not longer a young adult haha This did that, not necessarily in a bad way, but I found myself wondering if I would have gotten more out of this if I had read it in high school. Jolie was born with a severe underbite that gives her headaches and interferes with her ability to chew. And, of course, affects how she looks. Approaching the end of her junior year in high school, she’s planning to have corrective surgery that summer. Even though the odds of her dying while under anesthetic are low, they aren’t zero, so Jolie starts wondering if she should check some things off her life list just in case. With the help of her two best friends (one of whom definitely isn’t the obvious love interest) she sets off to do just that.\n\nThere was a lot about this book that I really liked. Jolie herself is relatable and likable. She has warm and affectionate parents and a sister with whom she gets along at a realistic level. She lives in a medium-sized town in Ohio and doesn’t spend all her time bashing on it because actually it’s a perfectly nice, regular place to live. Most of what happens in her story felt like things that could happen to any teenager, in a good way.\n\nHowever, Jolie is really hung up on her looks because of her underbite, and is convinced that the surgery is going to “fix” her and make her “less ugly.” The whole point of the book is her realizing that she doesn’t need “fixed” etc etc but I honestly did get a little tired of her obsession with “beautiful” people (she literally has a scrapbook where she has cut out pictures of pretty women with “regular” faces that she looks at and dreams about being) and despite many people she loves and trusts telling her that they think she is lovely the way she is and that they love her no matter what happens with her face anyway, she just keeps blowing them off again and again. It’s been a long time since I was the age (if I ever really was) where what other people think about how I look really matters (these days, as long as what I’m wearing doesn’t make me look pregnant, I’m good to go haha), so it was somewhat difficult for me to relate to this aspect of the story.\n\nIn the end, an enjoyable one-off, but not a book I see myself rereading.\n\nLunar Love by Lauren Kung Jessen\n\nPublished: 2023\n\nRating: 3.5*\n\nI’m not sure if I’ve mentioned this or not, but I’ve been a bit of a reading slump for quite some time now. I’m still reading, but not as much, and I’m so… I don’t know, hard to please? Nothing I read feels MAGICAL and I think the problem is me, not the books. Maybe. But it’s like everything I read I get done and go, hmm that was fine. I’m not sure if I’m clocking more hours in Stardew Valley because of this, or if clocking more hours in Stardew Valley is causing this lol\n\nAt any rate, this was yet another “that was fine” kind of book. Olivia is taking over her grandmother’s matchmaking business. Her grandma was a Chinese immigrant and then entire business is built around the tradition of matching people based on their Chinese zodiac. Olivia is rather obsessed with the concept, and when she meets a young man who is setting up his own Chinese zodiac matchmaking business, she’s suspicious – especially when it turns out to be an app that is a bit loosey-goosey with sticking with genuinely “compatible” animal matches. Soon the two of them are trying to prove whose system is the best. Of course, there’s no way that the two of them are a match, because their zodiac animals are NOT compatible!!\n\nI really liked Olivia and Bennett, and I especially appreciated that there were several times when miscommunication drama could have ensued, but instead the author decided to have them converse like adults and use their words and I found that just so refreshing. It never felt like there was drama for the sake of drama. The two of them were super cute together and seemed like such a great balance.\n\nMy main problem is that Olivia is SO OBSESSED with “compatible matches”! Eventually we’re given a brief backstory on why, but it just didn’t feel like enough to justify her refusal to even consider a relationship with Bennett despite there being soooo many green flags for the two of them. It was to the point where I was starting to wonder if the ending of the book would actually be Olivia literally refusing to date this guy because he was born in the year of the Rat. It felt like this book needed a prologue with more details about Olivia’s bad incompatibility experience in the past, or her having a real heart-to-heart and really sharing with her grandma or SOMETHING because I spent most of the book just wanting to tell her to get over it and stop blowing off this super nice guy just because of when he was born!\n\nI did like this one but I also wanted to shake some sense into Olivia a lot haha\n\nLady Lollipop by Dick King-Smith\n\nPublished: 2000\n\nRating: 3*\n\nHonestly, Jill Barton’s adorable illustrations are what leveled up this rather mediocre story from King-Smith. He was producing SO many books that some of them are just pretty meh, and this was one of them. The concept is fun – a spoiled princess is allowed to pick whatever she wants for her birthday, so she chooses a pig! Her pig pick happens to come with an orphan who becomes the royal pig-keeper. Throughout the story, the princess learns to be less selfish (kind of). It’s a perfectly cute little story, but the princess never really became likable to me.\n\nHot and muggy here, but thankfully the wildfire smoke has moved on!!! I’m only three months behind on reviews, which somehow feels almost manageable!\n\nThe Death of Mrs. Westaway by Ruth Ware – 4*\n\nI have had some mixed results with the Ware books I’ve read. I always find them completely engrossing when I’m reading them, but some are more plausible than others. She also has a tendency to create very unlikable characters, which can sometimes work and sometimes lowers my enjoyment of the book. While, like all her other books, I would consider this one a one-off read that I’m unlikely to revisit, I was very much drawn into it while I was reading. I actually did like this MC, and felt like Ware did a good job putting her into a situation where even though she wasn’t making the choices I would have personally made, I could still get why she was doing what she was doing. This book is actually kind of slow, but the reveals are paced fairly well, and kept me turning the pages.\n\nMr. Ape by Dick King-Smith – 3*\n\nAnother of King-Smith’s random little children’s books, this one was quite odd. I loved the set-up – an elderly, wealthy man is living on his own after his children have grown up and moved out, and his autocratic wife decides she is moving out, too. For the first time in his life Mr. Ape can just do whatever he wants to do, which includes things like moving his bed into the kitchen so he can comfortably eat cereal in bed whenever he wants. Mr. Ape’s wife never let him have any pets, so he begins to collect some. And what better place to keep them than in his own house? Soon there are chickens in the dining room and bunnies in the living room, etc. In the meantime, a man and his son are living in a caravan nearby and are gypsies, so many of the townspeople are prejudiced against them. (While Mr. Ape owns a car, the caravan is pulled by a horse, so I also had a lot of trouble figuring out when this book was supposed to take place.) Mr. Ape hires them both to help him with his growing menagerie. In the end, the father and son decide to move on because so many people in town are treating them poorly – and Mr. Ape buys his own caravan and travels with them! The pacing was just really odd, and while King-Smith makes it obvious that the father and son are actually really good, kind people, no one other than Mr. Ape ever realizes that, and it felt a bit sad that they were just forced to move on. I was hoping that Mr. Ape’s acceptance of them would help the townspeople see that they were wrong, but apparently not. It was also weird because we spend a bunch of the book with him collecting pets, then he gives almost all of them away! It wasn’t a bad story, just rather disjointed, as though he couldn’t decide exactly what story he wanted to write.\n\nThe Bridal Quartet by Nora Roberts – 4.5*\n\nI’ve already reviewed this series of books (Vision in White, Bed of Roses, Savor the Moment, and Happy Ever After) more than once (here’s my first review), so I don’t have a great deal more to say. Sometimes I look at my pile of books I’m planning to read and they all just look – meh. When that happens, I turn to old favorites, and I really do love this series so much. I love the friendships, the banter, the believable romances, the setting, all the backstories – these are just borderline perfection for me. The only part of the whole series that I don’t like is the end of Bed of Roses, which I actually skip now. It just makes me SO MAD that Emma goes off on Jack, gets all wound up about a whole bunch of stuff, starts a fight when he’s had this horrible, long day and wasn’t even expecting to see her at that moment, doesn’t let him say a SINGLE WORD in his defense or to explain his side of the story, storms off, and then refuses to let him talk to her at all for days. And all her friends are like, “she just needs time to even decide if you’re worth it” and a bunch of other absolute garbage. Of course Jack has to do all the apologizing because Emma is perfect and he’s just a stupid man. GRRRR. I think it’s extra annoying because the rest of the series isn’t like that all??? In general, Roberts writes men really well and rarely falls into the “women are perfect and emotionally balanced and men are stupid cavemen who only understand beer” trap, so it’s quite frustrating to see this book just absolutely fall apart in the last 50 pages while Emma “punishes” Jack for literally nothing. They’re my least favorite couple anyway. But the rest of the series is just so completely delightful. Happy Ever After is definitely my favorite because my husband and I have stronger Parker/Mal vibes (although I’m not nearly as organized haha), but they are all just SO much fun.\n\nThe Sword in the Stone by T.H. White – 4*\n\nI’ve had this book on my TBR for ages, so when a Litsy group decided to do a readalong of the entire Once and Future King series/book (originally published separately, the quartet was revamped and edited later to be bound into one book), I decided to jump in. This book was so much fun! All the characters are sweet and friendly – in the Disney animated movie (which I also loved growing up) Sir Ector and Kay are kind of bullies, but here they are actually very sweet and good to Wart. This book is FULL of anachronisms, like that is part of the humor, so if that bothers you, give this one a miss. I found the asides quite hilarious and really enjoyed them. I was definitely not expecting Robin Hood, so that part was also cracking me up. For some reason, some chapters were removed entirely when the book was combined with the others into one volume in 1958, but one of the Litsy ladies had a pdf she shared of those missing chapters, which were quite interesting, and included the famous battle between Merlin and Madam Mim. The 1958 edition also added chapters, giving Wart more opportunities to be different animals than he had in the original. All in all, while this didn’t become one of my new favorites, I did really enjoy this one, which was full of unexpected humor and likable characters.\n\nDangerous Island by Helen Mather-Smith Mindlin – 3.5*\n\nWell, I got this one for a quarter in 2003, so it only took me 20 years to get around to read this 178pg MG book! It was good fun but not amazing. Three kids are playing on a raft when it breaks free from its moorings and goes out with the tide, stranding them on a small, rocky island. All of that, and their survival stuff, was great fun. However for some reason the island is sinking (never explained). The kids mark the water line to see if it’s just the tide and we’re told “the water didn’t move” … but shouldn’t the tide be coming in and out regardless?? And then they find an entire huge pile of gold, but we never find out who put it there or why! So basically it’s a fun story, but it also felt like the author was just trying to make it dramatic and exciting rather than remotely believable – but sometimes that’s fun, too. A soft pick.\n\nRunning Total: Books that I’ve read but haven’t reviewed yet: 59!!! High/Low: 97/55\n\nIn the Dark by Loreth Anne White – 4*\n\nThis is a dollar Kindle book I’ve had for quite a while. Back in 2017 I read another dollar Kindle book by this author, A Dark Lure, that I wasn’t particularly impressed with, so I wasn’t in a rush to pick this one up. But when it came up on my random draw in March, I decided I might as well give it a try. Here’s the thing, this is a riff on And Then There Were None, one of the greatest mystery thrillers of all time. This has been done a lot in recent years, so I think it’s one of those things where it kind of depends on how many of these types of books you’ve read recently. If you’ve been reading a bunch of thrillers with an isolated group of people that are getting picked off one by one… this probably doesn’t add much new to the trope. But if you’re like me and you haven’t read that style of thriller in a while, this was a pretty enjoyable read. The pacing was quite good, alternating between different perspectives of what is happening with the “lodge party” and what is happening with the rescue party. Because of the prologue, the reader knows that one member of the group survived, but not who. As various motivations and connections are revealed, I kept changing my mind as to who was behind what was going on. In the end, it wasn’t exactly a huge shock; I had figured out most of the big pieces, but it was still paced well enough that I wanted all the details of how things had come together. Not a perfect thriller, but it kept me turning pages at a good clip, and put White back on my radar for future reads.\n\nThe Stray by Dick King-Smith – 3.5*\n\nI’ve talked about Dick King-Smith before and his amazing prolificness (new word haha) as an author. The Stray is another of those random middle grade books that he wrote in the 90s, and, like so many of his books from that era, is a perfectly enjoyable little read, but not especially memorable. Henny is 75 years old and tired of living in an old-folks’ home. She takes all her money and uses it to purchase a train ticket to the seaside, where she runs into a happy family who basically decide to adopt her. Everyone in this story is so likable that it made it a pleasure to read, even if half the time the adults did NOT make choices that made sense to me!! I also couldn’t 100% get behind the life-lesson of playing the lottery being the path to life-long wealth, but you’ll have that lol A cute story, but not a brilliant one.\n\nThe Cliff’s Edge by Charles Todd – 3.5*\n\nThis is the latest installment to the Bess Crawford series, which I really love. The majority of the series is set during World War I, with Bess as a front-lines nurse. But for the last couple of books, the war is over and Bess, along with so many other people displaced and changed by the war, is still trying to find her place in a society that looks so different than it did just a handful of years ago. Here’s the thing – this was a perfectly fine mystery, although definitely one of the weakest of the series. However, there has been an ongoing potential romance between Bess and another character for literally the entire series. This is book 13, and it’s starting to just feel antithetical to these characters that they haven’t had a conversation about what is going on. Another character has this mysterious background, but we’re only being given information about it in tiny dribbles, so I’ve really lost the thread there since, you know, there’s an entire year between books, here’s your next two paragraphs of information, surely you’ll remember that come next year. It’s frustrating because I really like all of these characters, but the long-term threads are really starting to feel frayed with the complete lack of resolution. After I finished this book, I was reading some other GR reviews and discovered that the mother-half of the mother-son duo that comprises the pen name of Charles Todd has passed away, and this was the last book that they completed together. So it will be interesting to see if the son continues the series on his own, and if the writing style changes. And hopefully we’ll get some actual forward progress with the overarching character development!!\n\nThe Healing Woods by Martha Reben – 4*\n\nYou know how when you read a lot, people are always giving you books just because you read a lot, so obviously you’ll want to read this? That happened to me TWICE in March, with this book and The Girl and the Stolen Fiddle. Thankfully they were both decent reads – and this one was honestly a surprise win. My grandpa has been having me provide him with books to read for about a year. He’s 100% not picky, so I’ve literally taken him some of just about everything. Even though he enjoys reading, they don’t own a lot of books, so I was a bit surprised when he handed me this one. In her 20s, Martha was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was sent various places to try different “cures.” Around 1930 she had surgery but was still an invalid. She took the rather bold choice of trying to just simply live out of doors for an entire season, April-October. She hired an elderly guide, Mr. Rice, who took her to live in a tent for the summer along a small lake in the Adirondacks. In all, she did this for six years, and The Healing Woods is about the first two years that she spent there. I’m not usually a big one for memoirs, but I found Martha’s writing to be surprisingly engaging. She doesn’t talk a lot about their every day life, but just shares little adventures and observations from their time there. The narrative isn’t strictly linear, so I sometimes did get a little confused when she wandered back in time a bit, but overall it worked quite well. I think I enjoyed this book so much because, for one, it wasn’t preachy. Martha, for the most part, lets you draw your own conclusions about the importance of conservation. Secondly, this book really reminded me of how much pleasure can be found in just resting in the woods. When I’m outside, it’s almost always because I’m doing something – hiking, gardening, target shooting, working. But so much of the joy of the outdoors is found by simply being there – because of her poor health, Martha had to spend a great deal of time just sitting and observing what was going on around her, and it’s lovely to read. I will say that I was a bit surprised that Mr. Rice encouraged her in her feeding of various wild animals – knowing how much of a terrible pest raccoons can be once they get going!! Martha wrote two more books about the next four years she spent on the lake. My grandparents own the second book, The Way of the Wilderness, but not the third, A Sharing of Joy. Unfortunately, these books have long been out of print and are very hard to find, but I’m definitely keeping my eyes peeled. Martha’s cure worked, by the way – she recovered from TB and went on to live to the age of 58. I found this article – https://www.saranaclake.com/story/2015/08/martha-reben-staring-down-great-white-plague – that tells more about her life and made me want to visit Saranac Lake even more.\n\nRunning Total: Books that I’ve read but haven’t reviewed yet: 62!!! High/Low: 97/58\n\nFinal batch for January!!\n\nTwelve Percent Dread by Emily McGovern – 2*\n\nThis graphic novel started strong, with an fun story and likable characters, but the story went literally nowhere. There is a bunch of build-up and then it just… ends. No resolution. Every single character is left hanging. It was incredibly frustrating. I also struggled with this one because the writing is SO tiny and hard to read, and because many of panels are so small, it could sometime be difficult (especially at first) to tell characters apart. And also, I’m sorry but this is just the way it is, having someone’s pronouns be they/them can make it SO hard to follow a narrative when you can’t tell if the narrator is referring to one person or several. I really like McGovern’s artwork, and many of her short-form comics (especially the Background Slytherin comics), but this book just really fell short of the mark.\n\nFrankenstein by Mary Shelley – 3.5*\n\nI had never read this classic before and was honestly quite intrigued to pick it up, considering that it is such a foundational piece of literature. However, it wasn’t really for me. The narrative structure can definitely be confusing (it’s someone writing a letter telling a story, and then he starts quoting someone else telling a story, who frequently quotes someone else telling a story… I mean, seriously), and while I understood why Shelley wrote it that way, it was sometimes difficult to remember who was telling who what. Frankenstein himself drove me a little crazy and frequently did and said things that made no sense to me. I was especially aggravated with (1) the fact that he creates the monster and then literally runs away immediately without a moment’s hesitation – seriously??? and (2) how long it takes him to actually take up arms against the monster, like literal months trailing this thing around and not actually figuring out a battle plan against it. I also found the monster to be a bit unbelievable – I could buy him teaching himself to speak and read, but to be able to eloquently quote from ancient classics, and to formulate the kinds of arguments he did? Well.\n\nAs a story warning about the dangers of dabbling in things we really don’t understand, and claiming that “science” justifies things like creating the atom bomb or seeing what kind of horrific diseases we can create in a lab, this reads great. As gothic horror, it reads okay. It was definitely worth the one-time read, and I think it deserves its status as a classic, but it isn’t one I see myself rereading.\n\nJonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach – 2*\n\nMy husband was given this book to read at an influential age, and would mention it from time to time as the first time he ever considered the concept of transcendence, so I got him his own copy for his birthday. It’s the story of a seagull who isn’t content to just hang out on the beach and eat stuff like the rest of the flock – he wants to pursue the true magic of flight, beyond just the necessities. Of course, this kind of attitude can’t be tolerated (for some unknown reason) so he is cast out from the rest of the flock. Over time, Jonathan Livingston Seagull uses his extreme flight speeds to achieve another level of existence, which he teaches to the other young, rebellious seagulls as well, as they all pursue their flying nirvana, much to the horror of those boring, traditional seagulls who just want to do regular seagull stuff.\n\nMy husband enjoyed the nostalgia trip, although he wasn’t quite as enamored with the story as he was when he was 13. That said, he did write, “Seagull is to flying as I am to _____” on our chalkboard as he contemplated what it is in his life that makes him fly haha However, I’m not as “heady” as my husband, so I honestly just found the entire parable to be quite aggravating. What’s the big problem with wanting to just hang out on the beach and eat breakfast? Why does everyone have to suffer and struggle to try and transcend to the next level? At the end of the day, it wasn’t a bad book, it just wasn’t a match for me. I like doughnuts and sitting in the sunshine too much to spend my days trying to transcend!\n\nBen and Me by Robert Lawson – 4*\n\nLawson wrote a few of these books, taking historical figures, putting some kind of animal in their life, and then telling the person’s story from the perspective of the animal. This is the most well-known of them, with the life of Ben Franklin told from the perspective of his friend and companion, Amos the mouse. Amos helps Ben make most of his discoveries and inventions, and helps him become a renown diplomat as well. Amos lives in Ben’s hat, where it’s convenient for him to take notes and give Ben advice on the fly. My favorite part was how many other famous people from the time had their own secret mouse-companions helping them along. This one is fun and silly with fabulous illustrations by the author. An all-around good time.\n\nThe Roundhill by Dick King-Smith – 3*\n\nKing-Smith was incredibly prolife, writing, I don’t know, probably close to a hundred children’s books over his lifetime. (I mean seriously, look at his list of published works on Wiki!) I pick up his books whenever I come across them on the cheap, and have quite a few of them sitting unread on my shelves, despite most of them only being around 75-100 pages long. With such a large body of work, some are definitely stronger than others (he’s best known for The Sheep-Pig, which is what the movie Babe the Gallant Pig is based from; I personally have a soft spot for the first of his books I ever read, The Fox Busters.) All that to say, while this story was okay, it wasn’t one of his best (in my opinion).\n\nEvan is a rather lonely boy who has a love for his special, secret place, which he calls The Roundhill. One day, he finds a girl there, who tells him her name is Alice. At first annoyed that someone else has invaded his space, over the next few meetings Evan finds himself drawn to her. However, she is also rather mysterious – to the point that Evan begins to wonder if she is even real. This book is weirdly sad and doesn’t exactly go anywhere. I never could particularly like Evan, who is rather mean to his visiting cousin at one point, and whom I just never quite connected to. At the end of the book he is an elderly adult reflecting on his life, and I felt quite sad for him as he said he wished he could believe in God but just couldn’t. All in all, there is a sad undertone to the story that kept me from really enjoying it. At only 84 pages long it didn’t take me long to read, but I doubt I’ll pick this one up again.\n\nMr. Mulliner Speaking by P.G. Wodehouse – 4.5*\n\nLike Meet Mr. Mulliner, this collection of short stories are all told by Mr. Mulliner from his usual spot in the Angler’s Rest. With so many relatives inclined to get entangled in all sorts of adventures, Mr. Mulliner has a tale for every occasion. These stories are fun and silly, and delightful Wodehouse fare.\n\nSalute by C.W. Anderson – 4*\n\nAnderson’s Billy and Blaze books were some of my first introductions into the joys of horse stories, and I still snatch up any book written and/or illustrated by him that I can find. He wrote several books for younger readers that are short chapter books (so a step up from the Billy and Blaze picture books, difficulty-wise), and Salute is one of those. At only 64 pages, many of which are illustrated, it’s not a very in-depth book, but is still a fun story about a boy who is given a retired racehorse. The odd part about this story is that Salute himself doesn’t show up until the very end of the story – it’s more about this first horse that the boy owns, helps restore to health, and then retrains to race. Still, a nice little story that definitely added to my conviction as a child that someone would just show up and give me a horse someday! LOL\n\nRunning Total: Books that I’ve read but haven’t reviewed yet: 59!!! High/Low: 97/59\n\nSometimes I don’t feel like writing a full review for whatever reason, either because life is busy and I don’t have time, or because a book didn’t stir me enough. Sometimes, it’s because a book was so good that I just don’t have anything to say beyond that I loved it! Frequently, I’m just wayyy behind on reviews and am trying to catch up. For whatever reason, these are books that only have a few paragraphs of thoughts from me.\n\nCogheart by Peter Bunzl – 3*\n\nThis book definitely seemed like one I should like. Middle-grade steampunk with super fun world-building and interesting characters, yet somehow the story just fell flat for me. There were some minor continuity issues that annoyed me – things like several sentences explaining why a certain mechanical animal can’t get wet, but then later in the book he gets completed doused in a huge barrel of water, yet is completely fine. There were little things like that throughout that really distracted me. The drama was just a little too over-the-top and choppy. Overall, while I enjoyed it for a one-time read, I don’t really feel interested enough to read the rest of the series.\n\nPoirot Investigates by Agatha Christie – 3.5*\n\nThis is a collection of short stories featuring (you guessed it) Hercule Poirot. Like all short stories, this batch had its strengths and weaknesses, but overall were just sort of meh. There wasn’t really one that jumped out at me as being particularly clever or interesting. Much of Christie’s brilliance is in her characterizations, and this format doesn’t really allow for that to happen, so it’s mostly just random set up of a problem, Poirot is clever while Hastings is a bit slow, and then conclusion. A fine little read but not one that blew me away.\n\nThe Decorated Garden Room by Tessa Evelegh – 3.5*\n\nThis was a nonfiction read and focuses on turning outdoor areas into living spaces. The book was an odd mixture of the super practical and then the super impractical. Overall, Evelegh presents some useful information, like where to start (floor/ground) and gives some ideas for other aspects of creating a garden nook. But some of her ideas were just so over-the-top that I can’t imagine anyone doing them from scratch. Still, there are a lot of lovely photographs and some interesting concepts. I’m not sure how happy I would be if I had paid full price, but since I picked it up as a library discard for a quarter, it was worth the investment.\n\nWatching You by Lisa Jewel – 4*\n\nDo you ever have one of those authors that you just keep adding their books to your TBR but never seem to actually read one?? Jewel has definitely been one of those authors for me, and I finally got around to reading one of her books this month! I really enjoyed this one, although Joey’s pattern of self-sabotage (“I’m a terrible person because I do terrible things/I may as well do terrible things because I’m a terrible person”) really began to get on my nerves. There was also a married couple in this book that didn’t end up staying together, and I think the story would have been a lot stronger if they had. Instead, it’s just another one of those messages about how “sometimes things just don’t work out” instead of “marriage is work so you’d best work on it.”\n\nBut all of those things are side issues. The main story/mystery was done very well. The pacing was absolutely fantastic – I loved the way the police interviews were sprinkled throughout the story, giving little tidbits of what is going to happen in the future. The majority of this book was written in third person, past tense – YAY. At the end of the day, this was an easy 4* read, and I definitely want to see what else Jewel has to offer.\n\nA Mouse Called Wolf by Dick King-Smith – 3*\n\nThis is a very short children’s book (less than 100 pages) that has been on my shelf a long time. I have a lot of love for many of King-Smith’s books (Babe the Gallant Pig, Harry’s Mad, The Fox Busters, The Queen’s Nose, etc.), but he also went through a time period where he was cranking out books at a ridiculous rate, so some of his stories do lack depth, and this was one of those. A story about a singing mouse and an elderly lady, this was a perfectly nice little story that I can see younger readers enjoying, but it was a bit too simplistic for me.\n\nSometimes I don’t feel like writing a full review for whatever reason, either because life is busy and I don’t have time, or because a book didn’t stir me enough. Sometimes, it’s because a book was so good that I just don’t have anything to say beyond that I loved it! Frequently, I’m just wayyy behind on reviews and am trying to catch up. For whatever reason, these are books that only have a few paragraphs of thoughts from me.\n\nA Duchess in Name by Amanda Weaver – 3*\n\nI picked this Kindle book up for free somewhere along the line because I’ll pretty much always pick up marriage of convenience tropes. This one was pretty average. I actually liked the story and the characters a great deal, but there was a lot of pretty explicit sex in this one, which always brings down my overall enjoyment of a story. It also meant that even though this was the first in a series of four, I didn’t really feel like paying to read the rest.\n\nVirtually Sleeping Beauty by K.M. Robinson – 2.5*\n\nAnother Kindle freebie, and another book that I really wanted to like. The premise is fun with a very Ready Player One vibe, with one character stuck inside a popular virtual reality game. The narrator and his best friend go into the game to try and rescue her. However, the execution of the story was incredibly flat. It honestly felt more like an outline or rough draft than it did an actual book. The plotting was choppy and cliché. The characters were one-dimensional and rather insipid. The ending was incredibly abrupt. I didn’t remotely believe that the characters had become even basic friends, much less that they had fallen in love, especially considering the whole story takes place over a few hours. It turns out that this was more of a short story than an actual book, so that’s why I ended up finishing it. If the writing had been this poor for the full length of a novel, I wouldn’t have continued. I do have a few other of Robinson’s books as free Kindle books, but reading this one hasn’t made me exactly eager to try the rest.\n\nThe Fox Busters by Dick King-Smith – 4*\n\nAlthough I’ve only reviewed a couple of King-Smith’s books here, his books were an absolute delight to me growing up, and The Fox Busters was the story that introduced me to the magical absurdity of his writing. This isn’t really a book I would recommend to very small children, as there is, frankly, a decent amount of death, but I remember loving the military-like execution of events. Basically, the chickens of Foxearth Farm have, through generations of natural selection (due to generations of farmers not really being bothered to take much care of said chickens), become almost like wild birds. This means that generations of foxes around the farm have very rarely ever been able to experience the delights of a chicken dinner. The events in The Fox Busters occur when a trio of especially intelligent pullets are hatched right around the time that a quartet of particularly clever foxes are growing up nearby. This is the story of their battle.\n\nSo yes, it’s honestly a rather violent book. A lot of chickens – and several foxes – die during the course of it. But the sheer creativity is fantastically engaging. King-Smith’s writing is brisk and to the point – he doesn’t tend to linger over descriptions or unneeded details. Yet somehow that suits the overall military feel of the book. There is a sly tongue-in-cheek humor throughout that I think I rather missed as a child, but found quite amusing as an adult.\n\nWhile this isn’t a perfect book, it’s well worth a read if you’ve ever raised chickens, or if you’re just looking for a quick bit of British humor.\n\nShow Lamb by Hildreth Wriston – 4*\n\nThis is another book from my personal collection, one that I picked up at a book sale eons ago but never got around to reading. It’s a shame, because this is a book I would have quite enjoyed as a child – a bit of historical fiction set in 1850 Vermont, focusing on 10-year-old Chad. Chad, along with his parents, sister, and aunt, live together on a sheep farm, and Chad wants nothing more than to also be a sheep farmer like his father. He feels that the best way to start on that path is to get to choose his own lamb to take to the fair that fall, but Chad’s father doesn’t think he’s old enough yet. This story follows Chad from lambing season through the fair (he of course does choose his own lamb, secretly, which is part of the story) and is a delight the entire way. One of the things I liked best about this book was that there were multiple times that Chad was strongly tempted to do the wrong thing, but for the most part he choose not to – and even if that behavior wasn’t rewarded immediately, it always paid off in the end. This is a lesson sadly lacking in virtually all children’s literature these days, as modern authors seem to think it’s much better to tell children that their parents are the enemy and also rather stupid and inept. In Show Lamb, Chad’s father is not at all perfect, but he is good and genuinely loves Chad, and this really comes through in the story. We’re also shown a contrast in the lazy, no-good neighbor, which was also done well.\n\nAll in all, it seems a shame that literally no one else on Goodreads has ever come across this one (I added it myself), as I found it a delightful little piece of historical fiction with a lot to offer.\n\nThe Unknown Ajax by Georgette Heyer – 3.5*\n\nI’m not sure if it’s because I had the large print version or what, but this was one of the few times where a Heyer book felt like it went on forever. While the last third of the book picked up the pace and become much more engaging and humorous, the beginning and middle really dragged. Without any insight into what Hugo was thinking, it was hard to recognize that he was pulling the collective leg of his relatives, because it’s hard to recognize, in writing, that he’s speaking in “broad Yorkshire,” beyond his saying “happen” instead of “perhaps.” There were also moments where supposedly he accidentally forgot to use his Yorkshire accent, but again this was hard to pick up in writing, so a lot of the subtlety of humor was lost on me. It was a fun story with some likable characters and a lot of potential, but this one felt too directionless for too long, as though Heyer couldn’t quite decide where she was headed with this story. It was (sadly) still better than a very large chunk of modern romances, but it wasn’t a Heyer I particularly felt I needed to add to my permanent collection.\n\nSo I find that I not-infrequently read books that I just feel rather “meh” about and they don’t seem worth writing an entire post about. However, since I also use this blog as a sort of book-review diary, I like to at least say something. So I’ve started a monthly post with minireviews of all those books that just didn’t get more than a few paragraphs of feelings from me.\n\nI had a lot of minireviews for July, so Part 1 can be found here.\n\nWater Song by Suzanne Weyn\n\nThis book was a retelling of The Frog Prince, but set in World War I Belgium without (much) magic. I really, really liked the concept and setting for this story, but honestly the book was just too short for what was going on. This ended up feeling more like an outline/draft for a story instead of a full story, which meant the characters were very flat and I couldn’t get behind the main love story because it felt so abrupt. The ending felt rushed and a little strange, and after a big build up around the locket, the actual reveal was quite anticlimactic.\n\nThis was a book where I found myself wishing that Weyn had taken the time to turn it into a real, full-length novel. There was so much potential in the story and characters, but this book barely skimmed across the surface. 3/5 for a decent read and a fantastic concept, but not a book that I would bother reading again.\n\n#16 for #20BooksofSummer!\n\nFarewell, My Lovely by Raymond Chandler\n\nThis is the second book starring hard-bitten private detective Phillip Marlowe. As with the first book, The Big Sleep, Marlowe’s narrative is what makes this book worth reading. While the story is fine, with a decent mystery and fair pacing, it’s Marlowe’s slang-ridden, dryly humorous observations that keep me turning the pages.\n\nAfter a little while, I felt a little better, but very little. I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat and a gun. I put them on and went out of the room.\n\nThis book is, as with the first, very reflective of the ingrained prejudices of its time, and the easily offended will probably not make it past the first page, where ‘negro’ appears three times, but I found the story to be all the more engaging because of its unvarnished view of its time – so much more interesting to read the books written then, where these words and concepts flow naturally because it was just the way it was, rather than books set during that time but written now, that frequently try too hard to belabor the point that there were prejudices. It was genuinely disturbing to see how no one really cared about the first murder in the story because the victim was ‘only a negro,’ and that the case was given to a man on the police force generally considered to not be important or skilled enough to deal with something ‘more worthwhile.’ In the end, when Marlowe mentions to the murderer that he may have been able to get away with killing ‘just a shade,’ he really won’t be able to get out of also killing a white woman.\n\nSo yes, a fun story with a lot of twists and a fairly satisfying (if somewhat hurried) ending; Marlowe’s voice is absolutely hilarious; and, to me, an absolutely fascinating look and reminder of how in the not-so-distant past, having separate ‘joints’ for blacks and whites was not only normal, but considered completely unlikely to ever change. 3.5/5, and I plan to continue reading more of Chandler’s works.\n\nThe Methods of Lady Walderhurst by Frances Hodgson Burnett\n\nThis is the sequel to The Making of a Marchioness, which I read earlier this month. I found myself a bit ambivalent towards that read, and I actually enjoyed this one even less. The story begins with the marriage of Emily and Walderhurst, but the majority of the book focuses on Emily’s relationship with Walderhurst’s current heir, Osborn, and his wife. Osborne has spent his whole life anticipating becoming the next Lord Walderhurst, and is quite upset when Walderhurst marries a reasonably young and healthy wife. The entire book is a bunch of melodramatic nonsense that would have been a good story if Emily’s devotion to Walderhurst (who is mostly absent in India for the book) actually made a bit more sense.\n\nI would have been willing to go along with the whole thing if the ending hadn’t been so odd and abrupt. Just – quite, quite strange. All in all, I think that I’ll stick with The Secret Garden and A Little Princess, and leave Emily Fox-Seton on the shelf. 2/5.\n\n#19 for #20BooksofSummer!\n\nMartin’s Mice by Dick King-Smith\n\nI’m not sure whether or not I’ve rambled on about King-Smith on this blog before, so even if I have it’s been a while. While he’s best known for his classic Babe: The Gallant Pig, King-Smith was an incredibly prolific writer of children’s books. While I don’t love all of them – some are really just too fast and shallow to be considered good reading, even for a children’s book – others have become lifelong favorites, like The Fox Busters and The Queen’s Nose.\n\nIn this tale, we have the story of a farm kitten, Martin, who doesn’t like eating mice. He thinks they are so beautiful and precious. When he discovers that the farmer’s daughter keeps rabbits as pets, he is intrigued by the concept – and when he catches a mouse one day, he decides to keep her as a pet. The rest of the story follows the adventure (especially when his long-lost dad finds out), and involves all sorts of funny critters, like an extremely intelligent hog, a crafty fox, and some quick-thinking mice.\n\nWhile this isn’t a book that’s likely to win a lot of awards or to cause you to ponder your life, it’s still a very fun and witty story that would be a great read aloud or early reader book. 4/5.\n\nSo over the years, I’ve noticed a pattern: if I read the book first, I love the book more. If I see the movie first, I love the movie more. It’s strange but true. Something about those first impressions, I think.\n\nThere are, of course, exceptions. Actually, the BBC’s Pride & Prejudice comes to mind. I don’t exactly love it more – but when I read Pride & Prejudice, the BBC actors ARE the book characters! But dearly beloved books, like The Hundred and One Dalamations and Little Women, just to name a few, have been utterly destroyed by the movies. Some movie adaptations I can get through by pretending that it’s a completely different story that just happens to have the same title (The Hundred and One Dalamatians, actually), but others fill me with such rage that I can’t. Even. Handle. It.\n\nThen there are the weird, rare occasions where I actually like the movie better. The most obvious example is The Princess Bride. While the book is actually quite fabulous and witty, it’s a little more cynical and cold than the movie. The movie version captures the intelligence and delightful dialogue of the book, while coming across as much warmer and lighthearted.\n\nAll of that rambling brings us, in due course, to Babe the Gallant Pig. I first read this book as a child. The first King-Smith book I discovered was actually The Fox Busters, which is, as an aside, absolutely brilliant. I soon realized that King-Smith was a (very) prolific author, and devoured many of his other stories. Some were rather meh reads, but others, like The Queen’s Nose, The Water Horse, Harry’s Mad, and Babe, became instant favorites.\n\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar, Babe is the story of a sheep farmer who wins a pig at a fair. Farmer Hogget has every intention of feeding the pig out and slaughtering him for Christmas, but Babe becomes close friends with Hogget’s border collie, Fly. His friendship with Fly leads Babe to try his best to be a pig who herds sheep: a sheep-pig. The story unwinds delightfully and gently. Babe is guaranteed a long life when he rescues the flock from sheep rustlers, and, in the end, his sheep-pig dream is realized, too.\n\nKing-Smith’s books frequently come through almost more as outlines of stories than full-fledged books. They’re children’s books, so that’s part of it. While all of his stories could use a little more fleshing out, he still manages to give clear character sketches with just a few lines.\n\n“I knows that,” said Mrs. Hogget, “because I’m late now with all these cakes and jams and pickles and preserves as is meant to be on the Produce Stall this very minute, and who’s going to take them there, I’d like to know, why you are, but afore you does, what’s that noise?”\n\nThe squealing sounded again.\n\n“That noise?”\n\nMrs. Hogget nodded a great many times. Everything that she did was done at great length, whether it was speaking or simply nodding her head. Farmer Hogget, on the other hand, never wasted his energies or his words.\n\n“Pig,” he said.\n\nMy edition has delightful pen-and-ink drawings by Mary Rayner that really add a lot to the story. Illustrations are especially important in children’s books, and I am always happy to find ones that are simple, realistic, and actually follow the story.\n\nThere isn’t a lot of depth to Babe, but it is still a wonderful little book that I highly recommend.\n\nBut what about the movie?? Well, I simply cannot decide whether I prefer the book or the movie. The movie adds a lot to the story, actually, by introducing several extra characters, such as Ferdinand the duck, Rex (Fly’s mate), and the evil Cat. None of these exist in the original story, but they work really well in the movie. The movie does a great job of retaining the spirit and basic storyline of the book, while fleshing it out a great deal.\n\nHonestly, what holds me back from wholeheartedly endorsing the movie is the fact that, in the movie, the Hoggets have grandchildren, and they are so obnoxious. Unbelievably obnoxious. The Hoggets children spend a lot of time nagging their parents about how the Hoggets need to “get with the times” and embrace technology and modernization. Farmer Hogget spends hours carefully constructing an absolutely beautiful dollhouse for his granddaughter who, when she opens it on Boxing Day, responds by wailing and screaming that it isn’t like the one she saw on the telly. UGH.\n\nThe silly thing, the movie on the whole is absolutely delightful. It’s so well done. All the animal characters are fantastic, the narration wonderful, and Farmer and Mrs. Hogget are EXACTLY as one would picture them. But those grandchildren, and the way the Hogget’s children are so disdainful about their parents’ life just really is quite terrible.\n\nSo, final verdict? Definitely read the book, because it’s only about a hundred pages (full of pictures) and adorable. Then watch the movie, because it’s great, too. Just fast forward through the big where the Hogget’s family comes to visit for Christmas."
