        "text": "Show Details\n\nDescription:\n\nLondon: Victor Gollancz Ltd, 1983. First Edition. Hardcover. Fine/fine. First edition (preceding the 1985 U. S. edition retitled \"Babe, the Gallant Pig\"). Signed by King-Smith (in ink) on the title page. Fine in fine dustjacket, perfect, and not common when it's signed, an exemplar of a \"book code\" imperative saying that even if every book you buy doesn't ultimately make you happy, always buy the best of them so as to deserve it. The 1995 film (Babe) won the Golden Globe for Best Picture and it is not crazy to call it one of the best movies of the last 40 years. The file copy has a rubber stamp on the front pastedown, the front free endpaper has been cut off, there is some foxing to the page edges and some spotting to the copyright and contents pages, else very good in a jacket with a faded spine. An interesting thing to have for a book that is beginning to, justifiably, gain recognition among collectors and dealers. King-Smith won the 1984 Guardian Children's Fiction Award for this book."
