Fly names the piglet Babe and teaches him all he needs to know about the farm and its animals.\n\nAs he watches his 'mum' round up the sheep, he decides he would love to try too. However, his legs are too short and he is far too plump to run around after a flock of sheep. He then tries a different tactic; politely asking the sheep to form an orderly line! The sheep are so surprised to be treated with respect that they happily oblige and Farmer Hogget soon notices that Babe has a certain knack with them...\n\nOne of Dick King-Smith's best-loved tales, this wonderful book is full of gentle humour. The short chapters make it ideal for early confident readers, and it will be especially adored by young animal lovers."
