It shot to further fame when the film adaptation, Babe, was released in 1995.\n\n'Why can't I learn to be a Sheep-Pig?'\n\nWhen Babe, the little orphaned piglet, is won at a fair by Farmer Hogget, he is adopted by Fly, the kind-hearted sheep-dog. Babe is determined to learn everything he can from Fly. He knows he can't be a sheep-dog. But maybe, just maybe, he might be a sheep-pig."
