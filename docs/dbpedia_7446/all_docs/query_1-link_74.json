        "text": "AMBROSE FOLLOWS HIS NOSE\n\nAmbrose may seem like an ordinary rabbit, but he has the most extraordinary sense of smell. He can detect any aroma from sweets to kittens - and even niffy foxes! He lives with his family in a hutch and is visited every day by Biddy, who is desperate to take him home to be her pet - if only her mum and dad would let her. Biddy trains Ambrose to become a tracker rabbit - which comes in very handy when Ambrose's little sister, Roly, goes missing. But when Biddy's family find themselves in real danger, can Ambrose's sensitive nose save the day?\n\nDICK KING SMITH'S FARM YARD TALES\n\nPuffin presents five classic children's stories from master storyteller Dick King-Smith. This collection features tales from the farm yard including Julius Caesar's Goat. Julius Caesar's Goat is the story of how Julius Caesar became the owner of a goat so smelly the enemy ran away at the merest whiff of him! And then there's Caesar's girlfriend... Queen Cleopatra may be beautiful but she uses Siberian wolf's wee for perfume and rancid donkey milk for bathwater. How can Caesar stand to be near this pungent pair? The other stories included in this collection are The Rats of Meadowsweet Farm Cuckoo Bush Farm and Farmer Bungle Forgets.\n\nEMILY'S LEGS\n\nEmily the spider seems exactly the same as all her brothers and sisters, until she races for the Spider Sports, when they discover she has ten legs instead of eight. They accuse her of being a cheat, and she is catapulted from the web. After being swallowed by a vacuum cleaner, she meets another spider, James, who befriends her.\n\nTHE HODGEHEG\n\nMax the hedgehog lives with his family on the wrong side of the road from the park. The road is very busy but Max notices that humans manage to cross it quite easily. He decides to try to find a safe way to reach the park but his first attempt results in a bump on the head, after which his words are all mixed up when he speaks.\n\nMAGIC STORIES\n\nThis collection of exciting stories includes The Magic Carpet Slippers! The great thing about being 75 years old is that you can wear your slippers everywhere - Percy Sloggett wears his in the garden and to the shops as well as in the house. In time his battered old slippers need to be replaced and he gets something of a surprise when he discovers that his new pair are magic. They make him feel years younger and also make him strong and clever. Percy is desperate to tell someone his secret and so tells his friend's grand-daughter, Lollie - for of course children understand magic better than adults do. Percy's slippers turn out to be life-savers as they enable him to leap across the road to save Lollie from a disaster! The other brilliant stories included in this collection are: The Magic Carpet Slippers, Uncle Bumpo, Philibert the First and The Ghost at Codlin Castlee"
