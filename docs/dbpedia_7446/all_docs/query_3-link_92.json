        "text": "Click Clack Moo, Cows that Type\n\nFarmer Brown has a problem. His cows like to type. All day long he hears:\n\nClick, clack, moo.\n\nClick, clack, moo.\n\nClick, clack, moo.\n\nBut Farmer Brown’s problems REALLY begin when his cows start leaving him notes! Come join the fun as a bunch of literate cows turn Farmer Brown’s farm upside-down!\n\nGiggle, Giggle, Quack\n\nFarmer Brown is going on vacation. He asks his brother, Bob, to take care of the animals. “But keep an eye on Duck. He’s trouble.”\n\nBob follows the instructions in Farmer Brown’s notes exactly. He orders pizza with anchovies for the hens, bathes the pigs with bubble bath, and lets the cows choose a movie.\n\nIs that he giggling he hears?\n\nGiggle, giggle\n\nquack, giggle, moo,\n\ngiggle, oink…\n\nThe duck, the cows, the hens, and the pigs are back in top form in this hilarious follow-up to the beloved Caldecott Honor Book Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type.\n\nDuck for President\n\nMy fellow Americans:\n\nIt is our pleasure, our honor, our duty as citizens to present to you Duck for President. Here is a duck who began in a humble pond. Who worked his way to farmer. To governor. And now, perhaps, to the highest office in the land.\n\nSome say, if he walks like a duck and talks like a duck, he is a duck.\n\nWe say, if he walks like a duck and talks like a duck, he will be the next president of the United States of America.\n\nThank you for your vote.\n\nDooby Dooby Moo\n\nDuck and his friends are at it again. But this time they’re pooling their considerable resources to win a local talent show, because the first prize is a trampoline.\n\nThe cows want to sing.\n\nThe sheep want to sing.\n\nThe pigs want to…dance.\n\nDance?\n\nAnd Duck? Duck just wants to win that trampoline. But first he’ll have to handle Farmer Brown.\n\nThump, Quack, Moo\n\nIt’s time for the annual Corn Maze Festival.\n\nThe farm is bursting with activity.\n\nCluck\n\nWhack!\n\nThe chickens build a fence around the cornfield.\n\nMoo\n\nThwack!\n\nThe cows give the barn a fresh coat of paint.\n\nThump. Quack!\n\nDuck builds the ticket booth for the hot-air balloon ride.\n\nEveryone is excited. Well, Duck is not excited exactly. But he has a plan. As Farmer Brown designs the corn maze for the festival, Duck does some designing of his own. Guess who’s in for a big surprise?\n\nClick Clack Peep!\n\nThere’s more trouble on the farm, but Duck has nothing to do with it, for once. This time the trouble is a four-ounce puff of fluff who just won’t go to sleep, and whose play-with-me “peeps” are keeping the whole barnyard awake with him.\n\nPeep!\n\nPeep!\n\nPeep!\n\nHow do you get a baby duck to hit the hay? Poor Farmer Brown will find out—and Duck might just find himself in trouble after all…\n\nClick, Clack, Surprise! Happy Birthday!\n\nHappy birthday, Little Duck!\n\nEveryone wants to look their best for the party. But Little Duck has never had a birthday before—so how better to learn how to prepare than to do what all the other animals do! The sheep trim their wool—so Little Duck trims her feathers. The pigs need a mud bath—so Little Duck quish and quashes, too. All over the barnyard Little Duck snips, slurps, squishes, and shimmy shakes herself ready until…WHOOPS! It’s party picture time—and Little Duck is a big mess. No matter—it’s not something Farmer Brown’s frosted maple cake can’t fix!\n\nQuack to School\n\nThe animals were very excited. They’d been invited to spend the day at school! The cows stomped and clomped. The chickens clapped and snapped. The pigs hooted and hollered. And Duck was…being Ducky. But Farmer Brown said that school was a very serious place. So he set some rules. No stomping. No clomping. No clapping. No snapping. And no being Ducky! Was school really that serious? Find out when the animals show up in the schoolyard!\n\nClick, Clack Boo!: A Tricky Treat!\n\nFarmer Brown does not like Halloween. So he draws the shades, puts on his footy pajamas, and climbs into bed.\n\nBut do you think the barnyard animals have any respect for a man in footy pajamas? No, they do not. For them, the Halloween party has just begun. And we all know these critters far prefer tricks over treats.\n\nThere are big surprises in store for Farmer Brown!\n\nClick, Clack, Ho, Ho, Ho!\n\nSanta comes to the barnyard in this holiday addition to the award-winning Click, Clack series from the New York Times bestselling and Caldecott winning team who brought you Click, Clack, Moo and Click, Clack, Peep!\n\nIt’s the night before Christmas and all through the farm, not a creature is stirring, not even a…duck?\n\nFarmer Brown is busy decorating his home in preparation for Santa’s arrival on Christmas Eve! All seems calm in the barnyard, but Farmer Brown isn’t the only one who is getting ready…\n\nHo\n\nHo\n\nOH NO!\n\nOnce again, Duck has gotten the whole barnyard STUCK in quite a predicament! Will anyone be able to un-stuck Duck and save Christmas?\n\nClick, Clack, Moo: I Love You!\n\nIt’s Valentine’s Day and on the farm that means a Valentine’s party. Little Duck is wildly excited. She hangs balloons, streamers, sparkling lights, and hearts everywhere, and hand-makes a valentine for everyone. On top of a hill, a little fox hears the music from the party and follows Little Duck’s many decorations to the barn…but foxes are not at all welcome on farms. The chickens stop dancing. The sheep stop dancing. The pigs stop dancing. The mice hustle off to hide. Will Little Fox ruin the dance? Or, perhaps, she’s just what the party needs!\n\nAbout Click, Clack Illustrator Betsy Lewin:\n\nAfter graduating from Pratt Institute where she studied illustration, Betsy Lewin designed greeting cards. Then she began to write and illustrate stories for children’s magazines. When an editor at Dodd, Mead & Company asked her to expand one of those stories into a picture book, Betsy says, “I jumped at the chance. I’ve been doing picture books ever since and loving every moment.”\n\nBetsy’s art is usually humorous, drawn in pen or brush with watercolor washes, as in Click, Clack, Moo; Cows That Type, but she also paints in a naturalistic style as in Chubbo’s Pool. Gorilla Walk is her first collaboration with her husband Ted and is about their trek to see the mountain gorillas in Uganda. This was followed by five more collaborations; Elephant Quest, set in the Okavango Delta, Top To Bottom Down Under, about their adventures in Australia, Horse Song; A Story of the Naadam, set in Mongolia, Balarama; A Royal Elephant, set in India, and Puffling Patrol, about the puffins of Iceland."
