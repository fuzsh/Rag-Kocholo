        "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nThank you so much for making the decision to come and do this reading lesson with me today.\n\nMy name's Miss Clarke and in today's lesson we are going to be starting to read a book called The Sheep-Pig.\n\nHave you heard of that book before? It's a really popular book that has been loved by many many children before and I can't wait to get started.\n\nSo for today's lesson you will need a copy of the book.\n\nYou need a copy that looks just like mine.\n\nSo have a look at the front cover carefully.\n\nCan you pause the video and go and find your copy of the book now? Off you go.\n\nOkay, I am so pleased you all now have a copy of the book in front of you.\n\nNow we can get started.\n\nThe outcome for today's lesson is I can summarise the opening of The Sheep-Pig.\n\nLet's have a look at our keywords for today's lesson.\n\nThese are words that will come up time and time again as we move through the learning.\n\nI'm going to say them and I'd like you to repeat them back.\n\nMy turn, your turn.\n\nAre you ready? Fiction.\n\nWell done, nice and loud.\n\nSummarise.\n\nStructure.\n\nOpening.\n\nGreat job.\n\nLet's have a look at what these words mean.\n\nFiction is when authors create made up stories with characters, places, and adventures which did not happen in real life.\n\nSo fiction stories are made up or imagined, from the author's imagination.\n\nTo summarise, which is what we're going to be doing at the end of the lesson, means to pull out the key events and ideas from the text.\n\nWe don't retell the whole story with every detail, we just give the key events and ideas.\n\nStory structure refers to the order of events within a narrative that gives it a coherent and engaging flow.\n\nSo it helps the story flow.\n\nAnd the opening of the story is the beginning of the story which establishes the setting, it introduces the key characters, and sets the tone, creating the foundation for the narrative.\n\nSo looking at our learning today, it is going to be divided into two learning cycles.\n\nWe will start with an introduction to the story and then in our second learning cycle, we will be summarising the opening.\n\nSo let's get started.\n\nThis text is called The Sheep-Pig by Dick King-Smith.\n\nYou can see the front cover there on the slides and I now know that you all have a copy of the book in front of you as well that looks just like mine.\n\nThe Sheep-Pig is a fiction text.\n\nThat's one of our keywords.\n\nCan you remember what fiction means? Fiction means it is a story which is made up or imagined.\n\nThe author of the story is Dick King-Smith.\n\nThe author is the person who writes the story.\n\nDick King-Smith wrote many children's books, you might have heard of some of them.\n\nSome of the other popular ones were The Hodgeheg and The Queen's Nose.\n\nGive me a thumbs up if you've heard of either of those.\n\nGreat.\n\nAnd The Sheep-Pig was so popular as a book that in 1995, it was adapted into a movie, into a film, and that movie is called Babe.\n\nI wonder, have you ever read The Sheep-Pig or have you watched the movie Babe? I bet some of you have.\n\nThe Sheep-Pig tells the story of Babe, a pig who defies expectations and stereotypes and forms a bond with his kind and patient owner, Farmer Hogget.\n\nNow, Dick King-Smith, the author of the story, he grew up on a farm and spent much of his life working with and caring for animals.\n\nAnd his experiences with farm life and his understanding of animals' behaviour inspired him to create stories that celebrate the unique personalities and relationships between humans and animals.\n\nLet's check what you've understood so far.\n\nTrue or false? Dick King-Smith often wrote stories about the relationships between humans and animals.\n\nIs that true or is that false? Pause the video and have a think.\n\nWell done if you said true, that's exactly what I said.\n\nAnd now let's justify that answer.\n\nHis experiences with farm life meant he had a good understanding of animals' behaviour, which inspired his stories.\n\nOr is it B, he loved animals so he often wrote about them in his books? Which one best justifies this answer? Have a think, pause the video, and make your choice, off you go.\n\nOkay, well done if you said A.\n\nHe probably did love animals, but that wasn't the inspiration behind his stories, it was his knowledge and his understanding from living on a farm which helped him to develop these characters around animals.\n\nOkay.\n\nStory structure refers to the order of events within a narrative that gives it a coherent and engaging flow.\n\nSo, coherent means a kind of logical order, so the story is structured so that the story develops and evolves as you keep reading.\n\nIt's really important for stories to have a clear structure to present the narrative in a meaningful way, so that readers can understand and enjoy it.\n\nIt wouldn't make sense if a story kept jumping around, it would be quite difficult to follow.\n\nSo stories tend to follow a similar structure.\n\nAnd there are four main parts of a story structure.\n\nHere's our story mountain and I'm going to talk through the four parts.\n\nThe opening, that's the beginning of the narrative where we are introduced to the characters, introduced to the setting, and we get a bit of a feel of what the story is going to be like.\n\nThen we have the build-up, a little bit more happens and we learn more about the characters or the evolving tale.\n\nThe climax, which is at the top of the mountain because it's the really, really exciting part where there maybe is a problem that needs resolving, something's happened, we're not sure how the story is going to progress.\n\nAnd then the resolution, usually where a problem might be solved or perhaps not, but the story will come to its natural end.\n\nThe beginning of a story is what we're focusing on today, and that is sometimes called the opening.\n\nThe opening of a story establishes the setting, so where the story takes place, introduces the key characters, and sets the tone of the story, creating the foundation for the narrative.\n\nThe tone is the mood or attitude that the author creates through their choice of words, so we get a feel for the type of story that it's going to be.\n\nThe opening often poses questions or perhaps presents a conflict or a problem that hooks the reader in, sparking curiosity, so making us interested, and drawing the reader into the unfolding tale.\n\nSo really important that the opening catches our attention, otherwise you might pick up a book, read the opening, and think, I don't want to read the rest of this book.\n\nBut, hopefully it will present in a way that makes you curious, want to read on, want to learn what's going to happen.\n\nSo let's check your understanding.\n\nWhat does the opening of a story usually do? A, it introduces the characters.\n\nB, it solves the problem, and C, it introduces the setting.\n\nThere might be more than one answer.\n\nPause the video and answer the question now.\n\nOkay, welcome back.\n\nWell done if you said A and C.\n\nThe opening introduces the characters and it introduces the setting.\n\nThe opening doesn't solve the problem, that typically will happen towards the end of a narrative.\n\nWell done.\n\nSo, The Sheep-Pig opens with an introduction to one of the main characters, Farmer Hogget and his wife, Mrs Hogget, who live on a farm in England.\n\nNow, I need you to get your book ready.\n\nI know you've all got it in front of you.\n\nI need you to get The Sheep-Pig book.\n\nHave you all got the book? And I would like you to open it and read chapter one.\n\nWhen I say read chapter one, perhaps a teacher might be reading it to you, or perhaps a grown-up at home might read it to you, or maybe you will be reading the book yourself or with a partner.\n\nEither way, you are all going to read the same chapter.\n\nSo find the start of chapter one now and then read the whole chapter.\n\nCan you all open your books now and find where it says chapter one and then pause the video, read the whole chapter, and then come back to my video.\n\nOff you go.\n\nOkay, welcome back.\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading the first chapter of The Sheep-Pig.\n\nNow, the chapter ended with a phone call, the phone rang, for Farmer Hogget.\n\nCan you talk to your partner, who do you think is on the phone to Farmer Hogget? And what would they be calling to say? Have a think about what happened in that chapter, who do you think is on the phone? And what are they calling to say? Pause the video and give an idea with your partner.\n\nOff you go.\n\nOkay, what great ideas.\n\nI heard lots of brilliant ideas.\n\nI did hear this answer.\n\nI think that it will be the vicar calling to say that he has won the pig.\n\nThat was really good thinking because the farmer did say he wasn't going to stay at the fair for very long and the vicar said he will call him to let him know, so that was a really, really good prediction of who you think might've been on the phone.\n\nSo well done.\n\nLet's check your understanding from reading that first chapter.\n\nWhat did Farmer Hogget have to guess correctly in order to win the pig at the fair? Was it A, his name? Was it B, his age? Or was it C, his weight? Pause the video and choose your answer.\n\nOff you go.\n\nOkay, great job, well done if you said C, you're absolutely right, it was his weight.\n\nThat's why Farmer Hogget had to pick up the pig and hold him to try and guess his weight correctly.\n\nOkay.\n\nI would like you to get your book again and turn to page four.\n\nCan you all find page four and point to page four in your book so I know you have found it? And I want you to reread the last two paragraphs on page four.\n\nSo work up, think that's the last paragraph at the bottom of the page, and then the next paragraph up.\n\nI would like you to reread those two paragraphs.\n\nAnd once you've done that, I want you to answer this question with your partner or somebody at home.\n\nWhat do you notice about the relationship between Farmer Hogget and the pig? Use these clues from the story to help you.\n\nHow does the farmer pick up the pig? How does the pig react, respond to being picked up by Farmer Hogget? And what does the vicar say? So, find page four, reread those last two paragraphs, and then answer this question with your partner.\n\nPause the video, and off you go.\n\nOkay, great job everybody.\n\nSome really, really amazing thoughts and answers coming from you all.\n\nI heard, I think that the farmer was caring towards the pig because it says he held the pig gently.\n\nIt did use that word in the book, gently, so obviously he was showing care and affection towards the pig.\n\nHe didn't just grab it and shake it around, he was very gentle with the pig.\n\nWell done if you spotted that.\n\nSome of you might have said, I think the pig felt safe with Farmer Hogget because the vicar said that the pig screamed when anyone else touched him, but with the farmer he was calm.\n\nWell done if you read those words what the vicar said, he was saying that the pig really didn't like being picked up by anyone else, but he was very calm with Farmer Hogget, and that kind of shows us a little bit about this relationship that is going to develop.\n\nOkay, that is learning cycle one finished.\n\nNow we are moving onto learning cycle two where we are going to be summarising the opening of the story.\n\nTo start with, let's see, do you know what a collie is? If you do, if you've heard that word before, can you tell your partner or somebody near you what you think a collie is? Off you go.\n\nDon't worry if you haven't heard of a collie before, I'm going to explain what it is now.\n\nSo, a Border Collie, and collie is short for a Border Collie, which is a type of dog, and here's a picture of a Border Collie there on the beach.\n\nA Border Collie is a highly intelligent and energetic herding dog breed known for its agility, that means it's very good and quick at moving and nipping in between things, its trainability, so the ability to train it to do what you want, and its distinctive black and white coat, so it's got a very obvious black and white coat.\n\nCollies are excellent sheepdogs.\n\nAnd I've put sheepdogs in green here because you might not have heard of that before.\n\nA sheepdog is a working dog, so not just a dog that's kept as a pet and taken on walks and stays at the home, a sheepdog's a working dog, specifically bred and trained to assist shepherds or farmers as we might refer to them, in herding and managing sheep.\n\nSo in herding their sheep, moving their sheep around from place to place where they need them to go.\n\nAnd many farmers still keep sheepdogs today to support them in moving their animals around.\n\nSo, the farmer does win the piglet, well done if you thought that was going to happen, and he is brought back to the stables where he meets the sheepdog, a collie, and her puppies.\n\nI need you to get your books out again.\n\nHave you got it? Okay, can you turn to the start of chapter two? Get your finger and put it at the start of chapter two, it is on page eight.\n\nYou are going to read from page eight to the little break in paragraphs on page 15.\n\nSo you'll notice there's a gap between two paragraphs on page 15.\n\nSo I'd like you to start from the start of chapter two on page eight and read all the way to that break in paragraphs on page 15.\n\nGet your book, pause the video, and do your reading now.\n\nOkay, well done everybody.\n\nGreat reading from all of you.\n\nSo now you have met Fly, the collie dog, because the piglet was put in the stables next to Fly and her puppies.\n\nWhat is your first impression of Fly and why? Your first impression means, what do you think about her? What's your view on her? What kind of feeling do you get from her? Can you turn to your talk partner and tell them now? Off you go, pause the video.\n\nOkay, great job.\n\nYou might have said I think that Fly is kind and caring because she wants to care for the piglet.\n\nShe does give off that impression, doesn't she? She says she wants to look after him, she's asking him things, so it does seem like she's going to be a kind and caring dog, but we will find out more as we read on.\n\nLet's check your understanding of what you just read.\n\nWhat was Fly teaching her puppies to do? Was she A, teaching them their names? B, training them how to be sheepdogs? Or C, training them how to herd hens? Can you pause the video, have a think, and make your choice? Off you go.\n\nOkay, well done everyone.\n\nLet's see what you said.\n\nB, well done, I'm sure you did say training them how to be sheepdogs.\n\nThat is what she was doing.\n\nShe wants them to be excellent sheepdogs like she is.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna check your understanding once more.\n\nWe've met a few characters now in the story, I just want to check that you all know who is who.\n\nSo can you match the name to the character? We've got Farmer Hogget, Mrs Hogget, Fly, and Babe.\n\nAnd the characters are the piglet, the farmer, the farmer's wife, and the sheepdog, collie.\n\nSo can you match the name to who they are? Pause the video, have a go.\n\nOkay, great job everybody.\n\nSo, Farmer Hogget, you did it, well done, is the farmer.\n\nBrilliant.\n\nMrs Hogget is the farmer's wife, well done.\n\nFly is the sheepdog, brilliant.\n\nAnd Babe, of course, is the name they have given to the piglet, well done.\n\nSo Fly and Babe form a bit of a special bond, which surprises Farmer Hogget.\n\nA bond is like a special relationship, when you feel quite caring and attached to each other.\n\nYou are going to do a bit more reading now, so you need your book again.\n\nMaybe a teacher is reading to you, maybe somebody at home is reading to you, or maybe you are reading the words.\n\nHowever you are doing it, I want you to read chapter two from where we just left off, which was the break on page 15, the little break in paragraphs.\n\nI want you to read from there on page 15 all the way to the end of chapter two.\n\nOkay, so find chapter two, find page 15, go from that break where you got to last time, and read all the way to the end of chapter two.\n\nPause the video, off you go.\n\nOkay, great reading.\n\nSo, based on what you've just read, I want you to have a think.\n\nMrs Hogget at the end was saying about fattening the pig up and eating him for Christmas.\n\nMy question to you is do you think they will eat Babe and why? Pause the video and talk to your partner about that question, off you go.\n\nOkay, some great ideas.\n\nSome of you might have said I think they won't eat Babe because he seems to be unique and special.\n\nUnique means one of a kind.\n\nAnd he's showing some signs of being quite special already, so perhaps they will form relationships with this pig and not want to eat him in the end.\n\nMaybe some of you thought they are going to eat him.\n\nSo based on what we've read so far, can you order the following events from the story? Here are the events, but they're all jumbled up and not in the right order.\n\nA, the piglet is put in the stables with Fly, the sheepdog and she calls him Babe.\n\nB, Farmer Hogget goes to the fair and guesses the weight of the piglet.\n\nC, Babe curls up to Fly and he copies her actions, which surprises the farmer.\n\nD, the vicar calls Farmer Hogget to let him know he has won the piglet.\n\nCan you number them one, two, three, and four to show the correct order of these events? Pause the video, off you go.\n\nWell done everyone.\n\nOkay, of course that first thing that happened was Farmer Hogget goes to the fair and guesses the weight of the piglet.\n\nThe next one was the vicar calls Farmer Hogget to tell him he has won the piglet.\n\nThe piglet comes home, number three is that he's put in the stables with Fly, the sheepdog, and she calls him Babe.\n\nAnd then fourth, Babe curls up to Fly and he copies her actions, which surprises the farmer, he goes and sits just like Fly does.\n\nSo we have now read the opening of the story and I'm going to ask you to summarise the opening for your next practise task.\n\nSummarise means to pull out the key events and ideas from the text.\n\nSummarise does not mean retell the whole story with every detail of what we've read so far, just put out the key events that have happened and summarise, tell them as a story.\n\nSo for your practise task I'd like you to summarise the opening with a partner.\n\nTake it in turns to say one sentence each.\n\nSo one person says a sentence, the next person says the next sentence just on what we've read so far.\n\nPause the video and summarise the opening now.\n\nAmazing.\n\nWell done everyone, really, really great retelling, summarising of the story so far.\n\nI'm going to show you my summary of the story.\n\nIt may be different, there might be some similarities.\n\nOne day at the village fair, there was an exciting game where people could guess the weight of a piglet.\n\nSurprisingly, Farmer Hogget won the nervous, little piglet by guessing the correct weight and brought it back to his farm.\n\nMeanwhile in the stables, Fly, who was an obedient and kind collie, was training her puppies to be sheepdogs.\n\nFly immediately felt sorry for the lonely piglet and asked his name.\n\nThe piglet did not know his name, but told Fly how his mother called him Babe.\n\nLater that day, Farmer Hogget found Fly and Babe cuddled up together having a sleep.\n\nAfter that, something surprising happened.\n\nWhen Farmer Hogget gave Fly an instruction, Babe copied too.\n\nWell done if you managed to also include some exciting adjectives or some exciting sentence starters to make your speaking a little bit more exciting.\n\nSo the opening of the story hints at some special relationships that Babe will form on the farm and provides a bit of a clue that his journey will be unique and special.\n\nWe can already tell he is not an ordinary little piglet, is he? Okay.\n\nSo let's look at a summary of our learning together.\n\nThe Sheep-Pig is a fiction story set on a farm in England.\n\nThe main character in the story is Babe, who appears to be unique, to be one of a kind.\n\nThe opening of the story establishes the setting, introduces key characters, and sets the tone, creating the foundation for the narrative.\n\nTo summarise means to pull out the key events and ideas from the text.\n\nYou've done a brilliant job today, lots and lots of reading and talking about the story, and also fantastic summarising of the key events that have happened so far.\n\nI really hope to see you again soon and thank you so much for your engagement and all of your brilliant learning today.\n\nWell done everyone."
