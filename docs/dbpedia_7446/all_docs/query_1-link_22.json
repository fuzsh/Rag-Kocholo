        "text": "That'll do\n\nWords of praise shepherds have for their sheep dogs ring true in this delightful story about a pig who embarks on a life and career far different from the norm when he winds up at farmer Hoggit's sheep farm\n\nSheep Pig\n\nThis was a lovely story of a \"underdog\" making good. i really enjoyed it and the performance was understated perfection.\n\nReally: just lovely\n\nThe original story behind Australian film \"Babe\", about the sheep-herding piglet. Here, Babe grows into a proper adult Great White hog. Alas, there are no singing mice, but it's still a beautiful story, with beautiful narration. Recommended for young and old alike.\n\nFantastic\n\nIt was a fun \"feel good\" story.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the performance and the light hearted plot. Animal stories are so sweet. This would be a good listen for any age.\n\nMy favorite animal story. It's so adorable!\n\nSTORY - Babe (or B-a-a-a-a-a-b as pronounced by the sheep) is a pig who is raised by a collie sheepdog and wants to follow in his mother's footsteps. Most of the story takes place on a sheep farm somewhere in Wales or maybe Ireland (not sure). Yes, it's totally fictitious and unbelievable, complete with talking animals, but it's heartwarming and clever. If you saw the movie \"Babe,\" this is the same story.\n\nPERFORMANCE - Good job.\n\nOVERALL - I listened to this book alone because I loved the movie years ago and wanted to hear the story again, but I'd highly recommend it for family road trips! One caution for animal-lovers, however: There is a sad part, but it doesn't last long and then the story is happy again."
