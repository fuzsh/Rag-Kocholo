EXT. WORD WORLD - OUTSIDE SHEEP'S HOUSE - DAY 2 OPEN ON a blustery day. Trees sway; leaves blow. PAN WITH THE BLOWING LEAVES to reveal SHEEP, setting up a makeshift magician’s table. 2 NARRATOR (V.O.) It was a wildly windy day in Word World, and Sheep was pretending to be... Sheep ZIPS O.S., then ZIPS back wearing a flowing cape and twirling a magic wand. She’s missing a hat, however. 3 SHEEP (TO CAMERA) Magician Sheep! 4 NARRATOR Nice costume, Sheep. 5 SHEEP (CONT’D) (as Sheep) Why, thank you. (as Magician Sheep) And now, for my first magic trick, I will pull a rabbit out of my hat! 6 NARRATOR (V.O.) Uh, Sheep? Aren’t you forgetting something? 7 SHEEP (looks around)Uh, No, I don’t think so. 8 NARRATOR (V.O.) Well, how are you going to pull a rabbit out of your hat when you don’t have a hat! Sheep looks up, touching her hatless head, and REACTS. 9 SHEEP Oh, uh, oh, well, No problem! I’ll just make one! Sheep rolls up her sleeves and waves her arms dramatically, building the anticipation for her trick. WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" She finally extends her cape, which is LINED WITH POCKETS FULL OF LETTERS. She pulls out the letters H, A, and T, and says each letter as she sets it down. 10 SHEEP All I need are letters! The letters H...A...T. She puts them together as she sounds them out. 11 SHEEP (CONT’D) (sounding) /H/ /A/ /T/... ON LETTERS - They morph into a MAGICIAN’S TOP HAT. 12 KIDS (V.O.) Hat! 13 SHEEP That’s right! Hat! And it’s just the kind of hat magicians wear! Or so I've heard. Sheep drops the hat on the table. She readies her wand. 14 SHEEP (CONT’D) Now to pull that rabbit out of my hat! She waves the wand and gives the hat three little taps. 15 SHEEP (CONT’D) Doobily-doo, doobily-dope, out comes a rabbit, I doobily-hope! Sheep reaches impossibly deep into the hat (her entire arm DISAPPEARING) and pulls out... DOG! 16 DOG Dog poses dramatically and hams it up for the camera. 17 SHEEP (CONT’D) Dog! You’re not a rabbit! (Beat) But it’s nice to see you anyway, Dog. Dog gives her a long sloppy LICK. 19 DOG Sheep blushes. 2 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" 20 SHEEP (giggles)Oh Dog! DOG Dog trots off. Sheep turns back to her hat... 21 NARRATOR (V.O.) Just then, a big gust of wind blew Sheep’s hat up, up and away! A sudden GUST OF WIND blows the hat up and out of sight! Alarmed, Sheep zips off after it! 22 SHEEP Oh no, my hat! Come baaaaaack! WIPE TO: EXT. WORD WORLD - SOON AFTER 3 TRACK WITH THE TOP HAT, as it is blown through the rolling Word World landscape. 23 NARRATOR (V.O.) The wind was very strong, and the hat flew very fast! It was off and heading for... TRACK WITH THE HAT as it drifts down toward... EXT. PIG’S BARN - CONTINUOUS 4 24 NARRATOR (V.O.) ...Pig’s barn! INT. PIG’S BARN - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 5 PIG stands at the counter with an empty plate, some cooking utensils, and a bowl full of letters. Pig’s stomach . [NOTE: He is not wearing his Chef’s hat.] 25 PIG Ooh, something’s telling me it’s time for lunch. Pig bends over and addresses his stomach. 3 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" 26 PIG Alright there, belly, stop with all the jiggling and giggling and tell me what you’d like to eat. Pig leans over his stomach for an answer. 27 NARRATOR How about a salad? Pig REACTS - STARTLED! 28 PIG AAAAHHHH! PIG bolts straight up in the air! PAN UP TO reveal him hanging upside down from an overhead light. He looks up. 28a PIG Who said that? 28b NARRATOR I did. 29 PIG Oh, Mr. Narrator, you startled me. I thought my tummy was talking to me! (Smiles) But a salad does sound like a good idea. Pig begins to come down from his perch. 30 PIG Hmm... I’ve got my ingredients, a bowl, my chef’s hat... He reaches up and realizes that he’s not wearing his hat. 31 PIG My chef’s hat! Where is it?!? 32a PIG (looking walla) 33 PIG I can’t cook without my chef’s hat! 34 NARRATOR (V.O.) Just then, Sheep’s hat came a knockin’! 4 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" EXT. PIG’S KITCHEN - CLOSE ON THE DOOR 6 The TOP HAT swoops in and SLAMS into the door! The hat breaks apart! The letters H-A-T fall to the ground with a ! 35 PIG Who’s that? PIG swings open the bottom half of the door, startled. He spots the letters H-A-T at his feet and picks them up. 36 PIG Hey, it’s the letters H-A-T! He puts the letters on the counter. 37 PIG (sounding them out) /H/ /A/ /T/... ON LETTERS - They morph into a CHEF’S HAT. 38 KIDS (V.O.) Hat! 39 PIG That’s right! Hat! 40 NARRATOR (V.O.) Hmm... that’s strange... 41 PIG (TO CAMERA) What’s strange? 42 NARRATOR (V.O.) That's not a magician’s hat, that’s a chef's hat... Pig puts on the hat -- BEAMING. 43 PIG Yep, For none other than Chef Pig! Today’s my lucky day! Time to get cooking! Beaming, PIG stands over a big bowl, tossing the letters S-A-L-A-D with salad tongs. ON LETTERS - They morph into a delicious CHEF’S SALAD. 5 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" 45 KIDS (V.O.) Salad! 46 PIG Ha, ha! You said it! Salad! Hmm... Pig takes a dainty bite of salad, then dives in. 47 PIG Mmm... then A GUST OF WIND blows the hat off his head. Pig sits up quick and sees the hat flying out the window. 49 PIG Oh no! The wind carries the hat through: HIS KITCHEN Pig chases after it! 50 PIG My hat! It’s getting away! The hat flies out through an open window! Pig dives after it -- SQUIRMING his butt to fit through the window! He makes it and takes off in hot pursuit! 51 PIG Pig pops out of shrub. The hat is far in the distance. 52 PIG Come back hat! Come back! Hat! Hat come back here! Hat! PIG Hat, would you stop blowing! Hat! I can’t run that fast. EXT. WORD WORLD - A HILL - SOON AFTER 7 WIDE SHOT. Pig chases after the tumbling hat - entering from screen left, exiting screen right. 6 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" Just then, Sheep rushes in, entering from screen left, stopping center screen, and throwing her arms in the air! 54 SHEEP Where, oh where is my hat?! 54a SHEEP (Gasp!) My hat! DOG (speaking walla) EXT. BEAR’S CAVE - SOON AFTER 8 The hat tumbles toward the cave. 55 NARRATOR (V.O.) But the hat was too fast for them. The wind kept blowing, and the hat kept flying, all the way to Bear’s cave... EXT. BEAR’S CAVE - SOON AFTER 9 Pig runs after the hat as it blows towards Bear’s Cave where we see BEAR has set up a LEMONADE CART. She stands next to the cart piled high with lemons and pitchers of lemonade. She forms a cup out of the letters C,U,P. 58 BEAR Who wants a nice, delicious cup of lemonade? She hears commotion and turns to look. Pig is running toward her. 59 PIG Hat! Hat! Dog and Sheep run toward Bear. 60 SHEEP (panting) My haattt!!! 60a DOG She realizes that they aren’t going to stop. 62 BEAR (panicked)n Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! 7 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" 63 PIG Ahhhhhhhhh!! 64 SHEEP/DOG Ahhhhhhhhh!! 64a SHEEP/DOG (slipping walla) The hat flies over the lemonade cart. Pig and Sheep crash into the cart, demorphing the letters and sending lemons flying everywhere. They try to regain their composure, but lose their footing and fall off in different directions! 64b BEAR Oh my! 65 NARRATOR But the wind kept blowing the hat through Word World... The hat floats O.S. EXT. DUCK’S DOCK - SOON AFTER 10 ON THE SHORE. DUCK skips along, singing a silly song: 66 DUCK Ohhh!! what a lucky duck am I/ just watching a breezy day blow by... As he sings, ANGLE TO REVEAL the HAT falling from above and landing with a near Duck’s NEST. The hat breaks apart! Duck, still singing, watches it happen. 67 DUCK I sure do not know why/ but something just fell from the skyyyyyy!!!! (gasps) The sky is falling! (panics) The sky is falling!!! Duck ZIPS over to his nest where the letters H-A-T stick out above some shrubbery. 67a DUCK Huh? Oh. I guess the sky isn’t falling. 68 DUCK What’s with these three big thingamadoodles in my nest! 8 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" He starts trying to yank them out, struggles, and falls over backwards. The letters fall over, landing on him. 69 DUCK YAAHH--OOF! ON THE DOCK. FLY and BUG observe. 70 FLY What’s with Duck? 71 BUG I think he’s finally quacked-up. 72 FLY/BUG BACK ON DUCK - climbing out from under the letters. 73 DUCK Hey, These aren’t thingamadoodles! They’re letters H-A-T KIDS HAT! Duck pushes together the letters H-A-T. 79 DUCK Well lookee there! Hat. A silly hat, that’s what it is! Woohoo... Duck plops the hat on his head! Its propellers spin in the breeze, lifting Duck up. He floats in the air! 80 DUCK I'm a helicopter! But again - - the wind carries the hat up and away! 81 DUCK Whaa!!! Duck lands on his butt, then flies off after it! 82 DUCK Oh, my hat!!!! Hey! TRACK WITH THE HAT as it flies through the air. 9 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" 83 NARRATOR (V.O.) Oh no! The hat was on the move! Again! A hat that was once a magician’s hat, then a chef’s hat was now, well, a silly hat! EXT. HAY - MOMENTS LATER - CLOSE ON THE HAT 11 It swoops in, into HAY, and breaks apart! PIG and DUCK zip in and dive onto the letters! 84 PIG/DUCK MY HAT!!!! Pig grabs the letter H, Duck grabs the letter T and then they both grab the letter A at the same time. A game of tug of war ensues. 85 PIG (pulling the letter A) Let go, Duck! I need my Chef’s hat back! 86 DUCK (pulling on the A) What’re you quacking about?! This is my silly hat! 87 PIG No, no, no, it’s MY hat! 88 DUCK No, it’s MY hat! They keep pulling when suddenly89 SHEEP (O.S.) Um, I don’t mean to interrupt, but uh, actually, it’s my hat, you see. DUCK/PIG Huh? Pig and Duck REACT. CUT WIDE to reveal SHEEP. She smiles sheepishly at them. 90 SHEEP Here, I'll show you - if you don't mind. She collects the letters from the confused looking duo, then smushes them together. 10 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" 91 SHEEP (sounding) /H/ /A/ /T/... ON THE LETTERS - They morph into the MAGICIAN’S TOP HAT. 92 KIDS (V.O.) Hat! 93 SHEEP Yesiree! Hat! See? It's my magician’s hat; it's part of my magic act! 94 DUCK Magic?! Now hold on one minute, Sheep! He paces, putting things together. 95 DUCK If it was a chef's hat for Pig and a silly hat for me then -- then Sheep must be right! (gasps!) It’s a MAGIC hat! Pig and Duck turn and look at the hat. It GLISTENS! 96 PIG/DUCK Whoa. 97 SHEEP Ummm, you can use this hat to do magic tricks, but it's not a magic hat. It's just a regular old hat I put together out of the letters H, A and T! Sheep tosses it up - but Duck catches it on its way down. 98 DUCK But Sheep, when you put the letters together it makes any kind of hat you want! That sounds like magic to me! 99 SHEEP Yes, but if I may, it's not the hat that's magic - it's the word HAT! DUCK/PIG Huh? She smiles, taking back the hat. Duck and Pig look confused. 11 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" 100 SHEEP That's the amazing, magical thing about words! They can mean different things to different people. Like the word 'Hat'-- (to Pig) -- to you it’s a chef's hat-- (to Duck) -- and to you, Duck, it’s... well, what exactly is your hat, Duck? 101 DUCK Oh, It’s sort of a, kind of a, well it’s kind of uh... it’s, it’s, probably easier just to show you. 102 SHEEP What a great idea! In fact, why don’t you both show me your special hats? She dramatically opens her cape, revealing all the letters. 103 PIG Let’s do it! Duck, it looks like it’s time to... SFX: BUILD A WORD SONG COMES UP. 104 SHEEP/PIG/DUCK/DOG BUILD A WORD! Sheep pulls two sets of the letters H-A-T out of her hat, tossing them each to Pig and Duck. They put their respective letters in to their correct positions. 105 SHEEP/PIG/DUCK It's time to build a word - let's build it, let's build it now! PAN ACROSS ONE SET OF LETTERS. 106 PIG/DUCK (V.O.) /H/ /A/ /T/ ON LETTERS - They morph into a chef’s hat. WIDEN ON SECOND SET OF LETTERS - They morph into a propeller beanie. 107 KIDS (V.O.) Hat! ON PIG AND DUCK AND THEIR HATS. 12 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" 108 SHEEP/PIG/DUCK Yeah, we just built a word! We built it! We built it! 109 DUCK Yahoo! We built a hat! 110 PIG Two very different hats! 111 DUCK Yeah, Out of the very same letters! 112 SHEEP That’s the magic of words, I do believe! 113 NARRATOR (V.O.) Sheep was right. 114 DUCK 117 NARRATOR A word like hat can mean something very different to different word friends. Pig, Sheep and Duck wear their hats, beaming! The wind blows in! The propellers on Duck’s beanie twirl Duck up in the air! 118 DUCK Whoo-hoo! This is what I call flying the easy way! 119 NARRATOR (V.O.) Pig, Duck and Sheep each had a hat that fit perfectly... But the wind picks up and carries Duck up, up and away! Duck tries to take off his beanie, but it’s stuck! 119a DUCK 13 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\" 121 NARRATOR Well, maybe Duck’s hat fit a little too perfectly. Duck is carried away by the wind. 122 DUCK 123 NARRATOR The End. FADE OUT. 14 WW46 \"One Hat Fits All\""
