        "text": "October 18, 2018\n\nRead as part of the ‘Rory Gilmore Reading Challenge’.\n\nThe charming tale that captured originally captured my imagination as a child due to the movie adaptation, it’s the heart warming story of a young pig on a sheep farm.\n\nBeing brought up by Fly a sheepdog, young babe aspires to follow in the dogs footsteps by becoming a sheep-pig.\n\nI liked how the movie stayed really faithful to the book, it really is a timeless classic.\n\nMay 7, 2012\n\nWhen I was in primary school Babe was the biggest blockbuster film and was extremely popular! I remember our teacher telling us that the film was based on a book and when I read the book that I enjoyed it even more! I was delighted therefore to have the opportunity to revisit one of my favourite childhood stories. The story begins with Mr. Hogget winning a pig at the fair by correctly guessing the pig’s weight. Originally Babe was going to be fattened up by Mrs. Hogget but miraculously Babe escaped! Babe was then adopted by Fly, the sheepdog on the farm. Babe then goes about copying Fly’s mannerisms and he is determined to become a sheep pig. Babe’s journey throughout the book is very enjoyable as the reader wills him on to succeed. The story deals with a lot of issues that are appropriate to a primary audience. Fly’s assumption that all non canine animals are stupid is quickly disproven once she met Babe. This shows children that we cannot base ideas on people by appearances only. Furthermore the way in which Babe treats the sheep shows that he does not judge others by their appearances. King-Smith has written some brilliant dialogue within the book that really helps bring the story to life. Furthermore the characters are excellently described and relatable. I would really enjoy reading this book to children in year 2 to upper key stage two as I think it is a very important story with themes that are important for all children.\n\nAugust 2, 2017\n\nSuch a fun story. I think I like the movie better actually and this book has a lot of charm. It's clever and funny and show how far politeness can get you in life. I think this is often overlooked and I think the world can use more kindness and politeness. I think Babe also shows that life doesn't always have to be what you expect. The unexpected can be as much fun, even more so. A bit of kindness can land us in the prize winning sheep-dog circle. I'm glad I took the time to read this.\n\nJune 9, 2023\n\n“That'll do, Pig. That'll do.\"-Farmer Hogget\n\nAugust 31, 2021\n\nRe-read as audiobook. Never gets old.\n\nOctober 18, 2022\n\nThis short novel was a great read-aloud choice for my older two girls. The 5-year-old loves all talking animal stories and her 3-year-old sister likes pigs, so they loved following the adventures of the orphaned piglet who is taken in by a farmer, fostered by a sheepdog and taught to herd sheep himself. I have never seen the movie this book is based on, so the story was new to me as well. I was impressed by Dick King-Smith's ability to tell such a complete story in such a short book. The ending also unexpectedly made me choke up, which made me love it even more. I'm planning to check out more Dick King-Smith books from the library on my next visit!\n\nAugust 31, 2014\n\nLovely. Glad to see that the movie didn't deviate too much from the book.\n\nOctober 3, 2022\n\nA bit dated and my daughter was bored by some of the detail, but I thought it was a sweet story and I'm glad we read it.\n\nFebruary 7, 2015\n\nOne of the rare instances where the movie is better than the book. I listened to it with my two daughters on a day trip in the car, otherwise I would have never finished it.\n\nIf you do decide to read it to your kids, get ready for lines like, \"the Collie bitch was pleased to see Babe growing up so strong. And \"the bitch told the pig that the farmer was pleased with his progress.\"\n\nAfter the 2nd reference to this term, and after laughing out loud at the surprise of it, I had to tell my 10-year old that the term was not acceptable to use for humans - and was especially derogatory for women. When I went to discuss it further with her, she just rolled her eyes at me and said, \"I know, Dad, I know, jeeez.\" After the 4th reference in the book, and with me telling her again that this was not appropriate for humans, she was completely irritated! It was actually pretty funny and was perhaps the most fun and excitement we got from the entire experience.\n\nAugust 5, 2024\n\nI started by reading one amusing line aloud to the PandaBat. Then he made me start over at the beginning and read it all out loud, and then he read a chapter or two to me. It's hilarious and adorable. He's our favorite pig, now. We have nothing but contempt for poor Wilbur, bless his heart.\n\n***\n\nJust to be clear, I'm not a farm sort of gal. For five years my father kept chickens and we lived in the middle of nowhere and I hate that. Nonetheless, King-Smith has charmed me no end. He writes with great humor and insight into the way people think (even dog and sheep and pig people). Perfect for reading aloud, appealing to all ages.\n\nBut please note, the illustrations, though attractive, aren't well suited. The author is talking about how big and lean Babe has grown, and the illustrator is still drawing him as a piglet.\n\nLibrary copy\n\nJune 27, 2017\n\nDieses Buch würde von mir uneingeschränkt das Prädikat \"Pädagogisch besonders wertvoll\" erhalten. Die Handlung kennt man eventuell vom Film \"Ein Schweinchen namens Babe\", dem dieses Buch als Grundlage diente. Den Filmemachern war damals ein sehr schöner Familienfilm mit liebevoll ausgearbeiteten Charakteren gelungen.\n\nUnd diesen Charme merkt man auch im Buch. So man daran interessiert ist, seinen Kindern soziale Werte zu vermitteln, ist dieses Buch hervorragend dafür geeignet. Das kleine Schweinchen hat ein freundliches Wesen und mit seiner Höflichkeit erreicht es mehr, als der Hütehund durch sein ruppiges Wesen.\n\nSei nett zu deinen Mittieren/-menschen, bitte um etwas, das du willst oder getan haben möchtest, sage bitte und danke, nimm Rücksicht auf andere. Nichtsdestotrotz hat die Geschichte nichts schweres oder behäbiges. Sie liest sich wie ein modernes Märchen und wenn das Schweinchen sich dann mit der Bitte \"Wenn nun freundlicherweise die vier Damen mit dem Halsband den Kreis verlassen würden...\" an die Schafen wendet, ist es, als würde es seinen Zauberstab heben.\n\nSeptember 14, 2019\n\nOk, despite that one absolutely AWFUL scene, this book is a solid 5 out of 5 stars. I love Babe, I love all of the animals and I LOVE that by being polite and friendly, Babe was able to succeed in his chosen path. He couldn’t do the job the way the dogs could, he was too different, some would say it was a handicap, but he not only found a way to do the job, but to flourish in it. He helped to alter the prejudiced views of his foster mother and on the humans who saw him work. Just by being polite, kind, open to others and true to himself. Important lesson for any era, seems to be especially true for the current time.\n\nI loved this book so much!! That one horrible scene makes sense, but SHUDDER. It was scary! There is some animal on animal violence in this book and a scene with a gun as a tool, not a weapon per say. I would agree with the 8-12 age range recommended on the back of the book.\n\n5, HIGHLY recommended, stars. Important lessons on manners and respect.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nFebruary 27, 2023\n\nI enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would!\n\nDecember 12, 2022\n\nDelightful read-aloud with my 3 boys. They were on the edge of their seats at the end of the chapter where the farmer is about to kill Babe thinking he had harmed the sheep. Highly recommend!\n\nNovember 17, 2023\n\nThis is one of those rare occasions where the movie added to the main story in all the right ways, but there is still nothing wrong with the book.\n\nJune 19, 2020\n\nAn incredibly sweet story that I enjoyed revisiting in book form. I watched the film adaptation, Babe, in the 90s and got the sudden urge last week to rewatch the film. First things first though, I wanted to know if it was based on a book. A very brief google search later and I had the answer.\n\nThe Sheep-Pig, or Babe, provided a much needed breather, interlude - what have you - to the past few days. Pick it up and have a go if you want a story of a piglet, Babe, that takes it upon himself to be a sheep-pig, a big-hearted collie named Fly who teaches him how, and the multitude of sheep, led by Ma, who really aren't as dumb as they're made out to be.\n\nFebruary 4, 2014\n\nI don't think I've ever read this book before, but I did today for class. At the beginning I thought I wasn't going to like it all that much--after all, there already is a great book featuring a pig as the main character, and that's Charlotte's Web--but awww, as I kept on reading I liked Babe more and more (and also the minor characters, Mr. Hogget and Fly especially) until by the end I was wishing I had a Babe of my own to cuddle with as he sheep-pigs his way to victory!\n\nJune 9, 2015\n\nWhat a fabulous read aloud book! I enjoyed it as much as my son. My 5 year old would give it 100 stars. I did omit the word \"bitch\" referring to the collie as it wasn't necessary and didn't want to get into a discussion of when it is not appropriate to use the word or how people could misinterpret it coming from a 5 year old.\n\nApril 14, 2024\n\nSimpatico libro per bambini (pubblicato originariamente nel 1983), che narra di un maialino che vuole diventare un cane da pastore, si legge in giornata, mi ha piacevolmente sorpreso che il film del 1995 (vincitore di un oscar su sette nomination) da cui è tratto e che da piccola ho visto infinite volte, sia molto fedele al testo.\n\nApril 28, 2018\n\nDistracția de mini-vacanță. O carte despre puterea de transformare, politețe și prietenie, încrederea în semeni. La fel de potrivită pentru copii, ca și pentru adulții care mai înțeleg semnificațiile din spatele cuvintelor.\n\nSă nu uităm de filmul din 1995, desigur.\n\nApril 14, 2019\n\nWhat an incredibly sweet, heartwarming story. I love the message that one only need to be kind and genuine to attain their desires, and that everyone should be treated with respect, regardless of how intelligent one might *think* they are.\n\nHowever, after re-reading the last page again to double-check, the most famous quote from this book is misattributed. Farmer Hogget says \"that'll do\" twice, but he never says \"Pig\" at the end, as it is often quoted.\n\nPerhaps that is said in the movie, but it is certainly not said in this book, despite the quote that is attributed to it on this website. Interesting!\n\nDecember 29, 2021\n\n2021 52 Book Challenge - 34) A book you'd rate 5 stars\n\nHonestly, I cannot describe how much I love this book. I never knew that there was a book version that the film was based on, but I was so delighted to discover and read this and I was so happy when the film was so close to the book. Its just really great.\n\nFebruary 18, 2023\n\nWhat a delightful story sill off bacon though. Now want to rematch babe which the film is based on this book\n\nJuly 23, 2023\n\nThey don't write 'em like this no more\n\nNovember 24, 2021\n\nOf course I loved this book, it is what one of my all time favorite movies is based from. Delightful quick read. And fun to see the story as it was originally told. I am glad I have seen the movie because then I had better voices for all the characters as I read.\n\nOctober 23, 2018\n\nSo cute! Loved it as much as the movie.\n\nSeptember 20, 2016\n\nObviando la tragedia que le pasa a estos pobres animales de campo, y cómo si somos humanos en verdad no querríamos que fueran inteligentes ni valientes (así por lo menos no sufren TANTO)... es un libro genial. Lindo, divertido, inteligente, y todos los personajes, sin excepción, son adorables.\n\nPero no puedo dejar de comentar la tragedia. ¿Cómo podemos comernos a los mismos animales que decimos amar? ¿Cómo podemos sentirnos compasivos por librarlos de un destino de muerte, cuando fuimos nosotros mismos los que habíamos pensado ejecutarlo en primer lugar? Encuentro que es muy cruel, y que no basta con una simple anécdota sobre EL ejemplar que se salvó, para consolarlo todo. Hay, además, estudios reales que dicen que los chanchos son tanto o más inteligentes que los perros, pero luego igual siguen viviendo solo para terminar en el matadero.\n\nBueno, ya, sé que no es blanco y negro, que también es comida, y las proteínas y etcétera, pero NO es como antes, y hoy en día ya no se justifica tanto. Si fuera una necesidad, yo lo podría entenderlo... sería incluso capaz de comer a alguien o permitirme ser comida, en una situación tipo \"Viven\" (tragedia de Los Andes), pero... no es el caso. Y eso me aflige.\n\nEs que ni siquiera es solamente cómo \"el ganado\" muere, sino que también cómo vive. Si se criaran con humanidad, y los comiéramos solo luego de haber tenido una vida feliz, tampoco sería tan malo, porque los alimentamos y cobijamos después de todo, pero no es así realmente cómo sucede, y las granjas NO SON como las del libro. Hay gallinas que nunca ven la luz solar, y vacas que son recluidas en celdas, para que no se ejerciten y así no hagan músculos... animales genéticamente tan mutilados que a veces ni siquiera pueden caminar, etcétera. De momento, ni siquiera me da el ánimo de querer recordar y además ya estoy siendo lo suficientemente aguafiestas.\n\nSolo agregaré una cita de Schweitzer (Nobel de la Paz de 1952): \"No me importa si el animal es capaz de razonar, solo sé que es capaz de sentir dolor y sufrir y, por eso, lo considero mi hermano.\". O sea, que mejor que NO comamos (y torturemos) a los animales, si podemos evitarlo.\n\nEn fin, además de que este libro es muy bonito, me gustó que trae conciencia sobre el tema. Hace que los niños (y adultos) pensemos un poco más de dónde vienen el jamón y las hamburguesas. Porque quizá Babe se salvó, pero el chanchito amigo hoy está en el sándwich de turno, y eso ya no se ve con la misma cara que antes.\n\nCreo yo.\n\nMuy recomendable, en todo caso. Más allá del dilema moral es, ya lo dije, un libro genial, y por eso las cinco estrellas. Porque, aún si los animales en verdad no sintieran y así no existiera todo ese dilema, las merece. Es una historia dulce, inspiradora, y bonita, y se lee con una sonrisa de principio a fin.\n\nEs solo que el trasfondo es TAN CRUEL. Incluso para los perros. Incluso para las personas. No es un mundo en el que me dan ganas de vivir.\n\nMay 24, 2009\n\nThis is one of those Dick King-Smith books that show very well his strong potential as a writer, nearly perfect as a blend of sensitivity and fun in coming up with a starkly imaginative, thrillingly unique tale that is really not like anything that the reader will have previously seen.\n\nBabe encapsulates the most saliently positive qualities of kids themselves, which will do nicely in commending this story to young readers. He doesn't accept that sheep are \"stupid\" and unworthy of addressing as equals based on what he has been told all his life by the sheepdogs; he senses that sheep are most certainly NOT mentally deficient, and he will not treat them as if they are no more than underlings to be pushed around.\n\nMany will primarily take from this situation the reinforced lesson of \"It's easier to attract flies with honey than vinegar\", and note that it is Babe's exceedingly polite treatment of the sheep that ultimately garners success. These are valid points, to be sure, but what I take from it more is that people (\"personified\" in the form of Babe's mum, the sheep dog Fly) have a natural tendency to sort those around them based on prejudiced opinion, and not based on really knowing the people and making assessments on the quality of their personal character. Babe shirks this tendency, however, and shows that if one is willing to view with fresh eyes the others around them, good things can happen.\n\nI recommend this hearty book to anyone; additionally, without this volume it is doubtful that we ever would have experienced the movie, \"Babe\".\n\nDecember 6, 2016\n\n\"Babe: The Gallant Pig\" by Dick King-Smith is a wonderful read-aloud or individual read for middle elementary students. It is considered a classic, and it is a quick, easy read. I especially loved the depiction of simple, \"down home\" farmers. The greatest lesson I gained from reading this is that anyone can achieve anything they desire if they put their minds to it. That lesson can be used to encourage students in a classroom to follow their dreams. Another lesson that students can learn is to put away any former opinions or stereotypes before interaction with someone or something that they have never encountered before. By putting this away, just as Babe did with the sheep, you get to know other people or other situations for who or what they really are. If you are encouraging your students to read this book or reading it aloud to your students, you must be aware that there is a controversial word scattered in it: \"bitch\". Teachers and parents must be aware of this in order to explain the real meaning of the word and that the farmer is not being vulgar or name-calling. I would recommend this book to middle or upper elementary children, because it is an easy and enjoyable read."
