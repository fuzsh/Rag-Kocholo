The little piglet she\n\ncalled Babe had been won at a fair by Farmer Hogget and was surely destined to be fattened up for\n\nthe family freezer--yet here he was, wanting to herd sheep! Who'd ever heard of such a thing? But\n\nBabe was determined to learn and so kind-hearted Fly taught him everything she knew, wondering\n\nwhat would happen when Farmer Hogget noticed what was going on ....\n\nChapter 1\n\n\"Guess my weight\"\n\n\"What's that noise?\" said Mrs Hogget, sticking her comfortable round red face out of the kitchen\n\nwindow. \"Listen, there 'tis again, did you hear it, what a racket, what a row, anybody'd think someone\n\nwas being murdered, oh dearie me, whatever is it, just listen to it, will you?\"\n\nFarmer Hogget listened. From the usually quiet valley below the farm came a medley of sounds: the\n\noompah oompah of a brass band, the shouts of children, the rattle and thump of a skittle alley, and\n\nevery now and then a very high, very loud, very angry-sounding squealing lasting perhaps ten\n\nseconds.\n\nFarmer Hogget pulled out an old pocket-watch as big round as a saucer and looked at it. \"Fair starts\n\nat two,\" he said. \"It's started.\"\n\n\"I knows that,\" said Mrs Hogget, \"because I'm late now with all ^theyer cakes and jams and pickles\n\nand preserves as is meant to be on the Produce Stall this very minute, and who's going to take them\n\nthere, I'd like to know, why you are, but afore you does, what's that noise?\"\n\nThe squealing sounded again.\n\n\"That noise?\"\n\nMrs Hogget nodded a great many times. Everything that she did was done at great length, whether it\n\nwas speaking or simply nodding her head. Farmer Hogget, on the other hand, never wasted his\n\nenergies or his words.\n\n\"Pig,\" he said.\n\nMrs Hogget nodded a lot more.\n\n\"I thought 'twas a pig, I said to meself that's a pig that is, only nobody round here do keep pigs, 'tis all\n\nsheep for miles about, what's a pig doing, I said to meself, anybody'd think they was killing the poor\n\nthing, have a look when you take all this stuff down, which you better do now, come and give us a\n\nhand, it can go in the back of the Land Rover, 'tisn't raining, 'twon't hurt, wipe your boots afore you\n\ncomes in.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Farmer Hogget.\n\nWhen he had driven down to the village and made his delivery to the Produce Stall, Farmer Hogget\n\nwalked across the green, past the Hoopla Stall and the Coconut Shy and the Aunt Sally and the skittles\n\nand the band, to the source of the squealing noise, which came every now and again from a small pen\n\nof hurdles in a far corner, against the churchyard wall.\n\nBy the pen sat the Vicar, notebook in hand, a cardboard box on the table in front of him. On the\n\nhurdles hung a notice--\"Guess my weight. Ten pence a go.\" Inside was a little pig.\n\nAs Farmer Hogget watched, a man leaned over and picked it out of the pen. He hefted it in both\n\nhands, frowning and pursing his lips in a considering way, while all the time the piglet struggled\n\nmadly and yelled blue murder. The moment it was put down, it quietened. Its eyes, bright intelligent\n\neyes, met the farmer's. They regarded one another.\n\nOne saw a tall thin brown-faced man with very long legs, and the other saw a small fat pinky-white\n\nanimal with very short ones.\n\n\"Ah, come along, Mr Hogget!\" said the Vicar. \"You never know, he could be yours for ten pence.\n\nGuess his weight correctly, and at the end of the day you could be taking him home!\"\n\n\"Don't keep pigs,\" said Farmer Hogget. He stretched out a long arm and scratched its back. Gently, he\n\npicked it up and held it before his face. It stayed quite still and made no sound.\n\n\"That's funny,\" said the Vicar. \"Every time so far that someone has picked him up he's screamed his\n\nhead off. He seems to like you. You'll have to have a guess.\"\n\nCarefully, Farmer Hogget put the piglet back in the pen. Carefully, he took a ten pence piece from his\n\npocket and dropped it in the cardboard box. Carefully, he ran one finger down the list of guesses\n\nalready in the Vicar's notebook.\n\n\"Quite a variation,\" said the Vicar. \"Anything from twenty pounds to forty, so far.\" He wrote down\n\n\"Mr Hogget\" and waited, pencil poised.\n\nOnce again, slowly, thoughtfully, the farmer picked the piglet up.\n\nOnce again, it remained still and silent.\n\n\"Thirty-one pounds,\" said Farmer Hogget. He put the little pig down again. \"And a quarter,\" he said.\n\n\"Thirty-one and a quarter pounds. Thank you, Mr Hogget. We shall be weighing the little chap at\n\nabout half past four.\"\n\n\"Be gone by then.\"\n\n\"Ah well, we can always telephone you. If you should be lucky enough to win him.\"\n\n\"Never win nothing.\"\n\nAs he walked back across the green, the sound of the pig's yelling rang out as someone else had a go.\n\n\"You do never win nothing,\" said Mrs Hogget at tea-time, when her husband, in a very few words,\n\nhad explained matters, \"though I've often thought I'd like a pig, we could feed 'un on scraps, he'd come\n\njust right for Christmas time, just think, two nice hams, two sides of bacon, pork chops, kidneys, liver,\n\nchitterling, trotters, save his blood for black pudding, there's the phone.\"\n\nFarmer Hogget picked it up.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said.\n\nChapter 2\n\n\"There. Is that nice?\"\n\nIn the farmyard, Fly the black and white collie was beginning the training of her four puppies. For\n\nsome time now they had shown an instinctive interest in anything that moved, driving it away or\n\nbringing it back, turning it to left or right, in fact herding it. They had begun with such things as\n\npassing beetles, but were now ready, Fly considered, for larger creatures.\n\nShe set them to work on Mrs Hogget's ducks.\n\nAlready the puppies were beginning to move as sheep-dogs do, seeming to creep rather than walk,\n\nheads held low, ears pricked, eyes fixed on the angrily quacking birds as they manoeuvred them about\n\nthe yard.\n\n\"Good boys,\" said Fly. \"Leave them now. Here comes the boss.\"\n\nThe ducks went grumbling off to the pond, and the five dogs watched as Farmer Hogget got out of the\n\nLand Rover. He lifted something out of a crate in the back, and carried it into the stables.\n\n\"What was that, Mum?\" said one of the puppies.\n\n\"That was a pig.\"\n\n\"What will the boss do with it?\"\n\n\"Eat it,\" said Fly, \"when it's big enough.\"\n\n\"Will he eat us,\" said another rather nervously, \"when we're big enough?\"\n\n\"Bless you,\" said his mother. \"People only eat stupid animals. Like sheep and cows and ducks and\n\nchickens. They don't eat clever ones like dogs.\"\n\n\"So pigs are stupid?\" said the puppies.\n\nFly hesitated. On the one hand, having been born and brought up in sheep country, she had in fact\n\nnever been personally acquainted with a pig. On the other, like most mothers, she did not wish to\n\nappear ignorant before her children.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"They're stupid.\"\n\nAt this point there came from the kitchen window a long burst of words like the rattle of a machine-\n\ngun, answered by a single shot from the stables, and Farmer Hogget emerged and crossed the yard\n\ntowards the farmhouse with his loping stride.\n\n\"Come on,\" said the collie bitch. \"I'll show you.\"\n\nThe floor of the stables had not rung to a horse's hoof for many years, but it was a useful place for\n\nstoring things. The hens foraged about there, and sometimes laid their eggs in the old wooden\n\nmangers; the swallows built their nests against its roof-beams with mud from the duckpond; and rats\n\nand mice lived happy lives in its shelter until the farm cats cut them short. At one end of the stables\n\nwere two loose-boxes with boarded sides topped by iron rails. One served as a kennel for Fly and\n\nher puppies. The other sometimes housed sick sheep. Here Farmer Hogget had shut the piglet.\n\nA convenient stack of straw bales allowed the dogs to look down into the box through the bars.\n\n\"It certainly looks stupid,\" said one of the puppies, yawning. At the sound of the words the piglet\n\nglanced up quickly. He put his head on one side and regarded the dogs with sharp eyes. Something\n\nabout the sight of this very small animal standing all by itself in the middle of the roomy loose-box\n\ntouched Fly's soft heart. Already she was sorry that she had said that pigs were stupid, for this one\n\ncertainly did not appear to be so. Also there was something dignified about the way it stood its\n\nground, in a strange place, confronted with strange animals. How different from the silly sheep, who\n\nat the mere sight of a dog would run aimlessly about, crying \"Wolf! Wolf!\" in their empty-headed\n\nway.\n\n\"Hullo,\" she said. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm a Large White,\" said the piglet.\n\n\"Blimey!\" said one of the puppies. \"If that's a large white, what's a small one like?\" And they all four\n\nsniggered.\n\n\"Be quiet!\" snapped Fly. \"Just remember that five minutes ago you didn't even know what a pig was.\"\n\nAnd to the piglet she said kindly, \"I expect that's your breed, dear. I meant, what's your name?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the piglet.\n\n\"Well, what did your mother call you, to tell you apart from your brothers and sisters?\" said Fly and\n\nthen wished she hadn't, for at the mention of his family the piglet began to look distinctly unhappy. His\n\nlittle forehead wrinkled and he gulped and his voice trembled as he answered.\n\n\"She called us all the same.\"\n\n\"And what was that, dear?\"\n\n\"Babe,\" said the piglet, and the puppies began to giggle until their mother silenced them with a growl.\n\n\"But that's a lovely name,\" she said. \"Would you like us to call you that? It'll make you feel more at\n\nhome.\"\n\nAt this last word the little pig's face fell even further.\n\n\"I want my mum,\" he said very quietly.\n\nAt that instant the collie bitch made up her mind that she would foster this unhappy child.\n\n\"Go out into the yard and play,\" she said to the puppies, and she climbed to the top of the straw stack\n\nand jumped over the rail and down into the loose-box beside the piglet.\n\n\"Listen, Babe,\" she said. \"You've got to be a brave boy. Everyone has to leave their mother, it's all\n\npart of growing up. I did so, when I was your age, and my puppies will have to leave me quite soon.\n\nBut I'll look after you. If you like.\" Then she licked his little snout with a warm rough tongue, her\n\nplumed tail wagging.\n\n\"There. Is that nice?\" she said.\n\nA little while later, Farmer Hogget came into the stables with his wife, to show her his prize. They\n\nlooked over the loose-box door and saw, to their astonishment, Fly curled round the piglet. Exhausted\n\nby the drama of the day, he lay fast asleep against his new-found foster-parent.\n\n\"Well, will you look at that!\" said Mrs Hogget. \"That old Fly, she'll mother anything, kittens,\n\nducklings, baby chicks, she's looked after all of they, now 'tis a pig, in't he lovely, what a picture,\n\ngood job he don't know where he'll finish up, but he'll be big then and we'll be glad to see the back of\n\nhim, or the hams of him, I should say, shan't us, wonder how I shall get it all in the freezer?\"\n\n\"Pity. Really,\" said Farmer Hogget absently.\n\nMrs Hogget went back to her kitchen, shaking her head all the way across the yard at the thought of\n\nher husband's soft-heartedness.\n\nThe farmer opened the loose-box door, and to save the effort of a word, clicked his fingers to call the\n\nbitch out.\n\nAs soon as Fly moved the piglet woke and followed her, sticking so close to her that his snout\n\ntouched her tail-tip. Surprise forced Farmer Hogget into speech.\n\n\"Fly!\" he said in amazement. Obediently, as always, the collie bitch turned and trotted back to him.\n\nThe pig trotted behind her.\n\n\"Sit!\" said Farmer Hogget. Fly sat. Babe sat. Farmer Hogget scratched his head. He could not think of\n\nanything to say.\n\nChapter 3\n\n\"Why can't I learn?\"\n\nBy dark it was plain to Farmer Hogget that, whether he liked it or not, Fly had not four, but five\n\nchildren.\n\nAll the long summer evening Babe had followed Fly about the yard and buildings, aimlessly, it\n\nseemed to the watching farmer, though of course this was not the case. It was in fact a conducted tour.\n\nFly knew that if this foster-child was to be allowed his freedom and the constant reassurance of her\n\ncompany for which he obviously craved, he must quickly learn (and patently he was a quick learner)\n\nhis way about the place; and that he must be taught, as her puppies had been taught, how to behave\n\nlike a good dog.\n\n\"A pig you may be, Babe,\" she had begun by saying, \"but if you do as I tell you, I shouldn't be a bit\n\nsurprised if the boss doesn't let you run about with us, instead of shutting you up. He's a kind man, the\n\nboss is.\"\n\n\"I knew that,\" said Babe, \"when he first picked me up. I could feel it. I knew he wouldn't hurt me.\"\n\n\"You wait ...\" began one of the puppies, and then stopped suddenly at his mother's warning growl.\n\nThough she said nothing, all four of her children knew immediately by instinct what she meant.\n\n\"Wait for what?\" said Babe.\n\n\"Er ... you wait half a tick, and we'll take you round and show you everything,\" said the first puppy\n\nhastily. \"Won't we, Mum?\"\n\nSo Babe was shown all round the yard and the farm buildings, and introduced to the creatures who\n\nlived thereabouts, the ducks and chickens and other poultry, and the farm cats. He saw no sheep, for\n\nthey were all in the fields.\n\nEven in the first hour he learned a number of useful lessons, as the puppies had learned before him:\n\nthat cats scratch and hens peck, that turning your back on the turkey-cock means getting your bottom\n\nbitten, that chicks are not for chasing and eggs are not for eating.\n\n\"You do as I do,\" said Fly, \"and you'll be all right.\"\n\nShe thought for a moment. \"There is one thing though, Babe,\" she said, and she looked across at the\n\nback door of the farmhouse, \"if I go in there, you stay outside and wait for me, understand?\"\n\n\"Aren't pigs allowed in there?\" asked Babe.\n\n\"Not live ones,\" said one of the puppies, but he said it under his breath.\n\n\"No, dear,\" said Fly. Well, not yet anyway, she thought, but the way you're going on, I shouldn't be\n\nsurprised at anything. Funny, she thought, I feel really proud of him, he learns so quick. Quick as any\n\nsheep-dog.\n\nThat night the loose-box in which Babe had first been put was empty. In the next door one, all five\n\nanimals slept in the straw together. Though he did not tell his wife, Farmer Hogget had not had the\n\nheart to shut the piglet away, so happy was it in the company of the dogs.\n\nAt first the puppies had not been equally happy at the idea.\n\n\"Mum!\" they said. \"He'll wet the bed!\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Fly. \"If you want to do anything, dear, you go outside, there's a good boy.\"\n\nI nearly said \"there's a good pup\" she thought. Whatever next!\n\nIn fact, in the days that followed, Babe became so doglike, what with coming when Fly came and\n\nsitting when Fly sat and much preferring dog's food to anything else he was offered, that Farmer\n\nHogget caught himself half expecting, when he patted the piglet, that it would wag its tail. He would\n\nnot have been surprised if it had tried to accompany Fly when he called her to go with him on his\n\nmorning rounds, but it had stayed in the stables, playing with the puppies.\n\n\"You stop with the boys, Babe,\" Fly had said, \"while I see to the sheep. I shan't be long.\"\n\n\"What's sheep?\" the piglet said when she had gone.\n\nThe puppies rolled about in the straw.\n\n\"Don't you know that, you silly Babe?\" said one.\n\n\"Sheep are animals with thick woolly coats.\"\n\n\"And thick wooly heads.\"\n\n\"And men can't look after them without the help of the likes of us,\" said the fourth.\n\n\"Why do they need you?\" said Babe.\n\n\"Because we're sheep-dogs!\" they all cried together, and ran off up the yard.\n\nBabe thought about this matter of sheep and sheep-dogs a good deal during the first couple of weeks\n\nof his life on the Hoggets' farm. In that time Fly's puppies, now old enough to leave home, had been\n\nadvertised for sale, and Fly was anxious to teach them all she could before they went out into the\n\nworld. Daily she made them practise on the ducks, while Babe sat beside her and watched with\n\ninterest. And daily their skills improved and the ducks lost weight and patience.\n\nThen there came, one after another, four farmers, four tall long-legged men who smelt of sheep. And\n\neach picked his puppy and paid his money, while Fly sat and watched her children leave to start their\n\nworking life.\n\nAs always, she felt a pang to see each go, but this time, after the last had left, she was not alone.\n\n\"It's nice, dear,\" she said to Babe. \"I've still got you.\"\n\nBut not for all that long, she thought. Poor little chap, in six months or so he'll be fit to kill. At least he\n\ndoesn't know it. She looked fondly at him, this foster-child that now called her \"Mum\". He had picked\n\nit up, naturally enough, from the puppies, but it pleased her to hear it, now more than ever.\n\n\"Mum,\" said Babe.\n\n\"Yes, dear?\"\n\n\"They've gone off to work sheep, haven't they?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear.\"\n\n\"Because they're sheep-dogs. Like you. You're useful to the boss, aren't you, because you're a sheep-\n\ndog?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear.\"\n\n\"Well, Mum?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear?\"\n\n\"Why can't I learn to be a sheep-pig?\"\n\nChapter 4\n\n\"You'm a polite young chap\"\n\nAfter the last of the puppies had left, the ducks heaved a general sigh of relief. They looked forward\n\nto a peaceful day and paid no attention when, the following morning, Fly and Babe came down to the\n\npond and sat and watched them as they squattered and splattered in its soupy green depths. They knew\n\nthat the old dog would not bother them, and they took no notice of the strange creature at her side.\n\n\"They'll come out and walk up the yard in a minute,\" said Fly. \"Then you can have a go at fetching\n\nthem back, if you like.\"\n\n\"Oh yes please!\" said Babe excitedly.\n\nThe collie bitch looked fondly at her foster-child. Sheep-pig indeed, she thought, the idea of it! The\n\nmere sight of him would probably send the flock into the next county. Anyway he'd never get near\n\nthem on those little short legs. Let him play with the ducks for a day or two and he'd forget all about\n\nit.\n\nWhen the ducks did come up out of the water and marched noisily past the piglet, she half expected\n\nhim to chase after them, as the puppies usually did at first; but he sat very still, his ears cocked,\n\nwatching her.\n\n\"All right,\" said Fly. \"Let's see how you get on. Now then, first thing is, you've got to get behind them,\n\njust like I have to with the sheep. If the boss wants me to go round the right side of them (that's the\n\nside by the stables there), he says \"Away to me\". If he wants me to go round the left (that's the side by\n\nthe Dutch barn), he says \"Come by\". O.k.?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mum.\"\n\n\"Right then. Away to me, Babe!\" said Fly sharply.\n\nAt first, not surprisingly, Babe's efforts met with little success. There were no problems with getting\n\nround the ducks--even with his curious little see-sawing canter he was much faster than they--but the\n\nbusiness of bringing the whole flock back to Fly was not, he found, at all easy. Either he pressed them\n\ntoo hard and they broke up and fluttered all over the place, or he was too gentle and held back, and\n\nthey waddled away in twos and threes.\n\n\"Come and have a rest, dear,\" called Fly after a while. \"Leave the silly things alone, they're not worth\n\nupsetting yourself about.\"\n\n\"I'm not upset, Mum,\" said Babe. \"Just puzzled. I mean, I told them what I wanted them to do but they\n\ndidn't take any notice of me. Why not?\"\n\nBecause you weren't born to it, thought Fly. You haven't got the instinct to dominate them, to make\n\nthem do what you want.\n\n\"It's early days yet, Babe dear,\" she said.\n\n\"Do you suppose,\" said Babe, \"that if I asked them politely ....\"\n\n\"Asked them politely! What an idea! Just imagine me doing that with the sheep--\"please will you go\n\nthrough that gateway\", \"would you kindly walk into that pen?\"' Oh no, dear, you'd never get anywhere\n\nthat way. You've got to tell 'em what to do, doesn't matter whether it's ducks or sheep. They're stupid\n\nand dogs are intelligent, that's what you have to remember.\"\n\n\"But I'm a pig.\"\n\n\"Pigs are intelligent too,\" said Fly firmly. Ask them politely, she thought, whatever next! What\n\nhappened next, later that morning in fact, was that Babe met his first sheep.\n\nFarmer Hogget and Fly had been out round the flock, and when they returned Fly was driving before\n\nher an old lame ewe, which they penned in the loose-box where the piglet had originally been shut.\n\nThen they went away up the hill again.\n\nBabe made his way into the stables, curious to meet this, the first of the animals that he planned one\n\nday to work with, but he could not see into the box. He snuffled under the bottom of the door, and\n\nfrom inside there came a cough and the sharp stamp of a foot, and then the sound of a hoarse\n\ncomplaining voice. \"Wolves! Wolves!\" it said. \"They do never leave a body alone. Nag, nag, nag all\n\nday long, go here, go there, do this, do that. What d'you want now? Can't you give us a bit of peace,\n\nwolf?\"\n\n\"I'm not a wolf,\" said Babe under the door.\n\n\"Oh, I knows all that,\" said the sheep sourly. \"Calls yourself a sheep-dog, I knows that, but you don't\n\nfool none of us. You're a wolf like the rest of 'em, given half a chance. You looks at us, and you sees\n\nlamb-chops. Go away, wolf.\"\n\n\"But I'm not a sheep-dog either,\" said Babe, and he scrambled up the stack of straw bales and looked\n\nover the bars.\n\n\"You see?\" he said.\n\n\"Well I'll be dipped,\" said the old sheep, peering up at him, \"no more you ain't. What are you?\"\n\n\"Pig,\" said Babe. \"Large White. What are you?\"\n\n\"Ewe,\" said the sheep.\n\n\"No, not me, you--what are you?\"\n\n\"I'm a ewe.\"\n\nMum was right, thought Babe, they certainly are stupid. But if I'm going to learn how to be a sheep-\n\npig I must try to understand them, and this might be a good chance. Perhaps I could make a friend of\n\nthis one.\n\n\"My name's Babe,\" he said in a jolly voice. \"What's yours?\"\n\n\"Maaaaa,\" said the sheep.\n\n\"That's a nice name,\" said Babe. \"What's the matter with you, Ma?\"\n\n\"Foot-rot,\" said the sheep, holding up a foreleg. \"And I've got a nasty cough.\" She coughed. \"And I'm\n\nnot as young as I was.\"\n\n\"You don't look very old to me,\" said Babe politely.\n\nA look of pleasure came over the sheep's mournful face, and she lay down in the straw.\n\n\"Very civil of you to say so,\" she said. \"First kind word I've had since I were a little lamb,\" and she\n\nbelched loudly and began to chew a mouthful of cud. Though he did not quite know why, Babe said\n\nnothing to Fly of his conversation with Ma. Farmer Hogget had treated the sheep's foot and tipped a\n\ndrench down its protesting throat, and now, as darkness fell, dog and pig lay side by side, their rest\n\nonly occasionally disturbed by a rustling from the next-door box. Having at last set eyes on a sheep,\n\nBabe's dreams were immediately filled with the creatures, all lame, all coughing, all, like the ducks,\n\nscattering wildly before his attempts to round them up.\n\n\"Go here, go there, do this, do that!\" he squeaked furiously at them, but they took not a bit of notice,\n\nuntil at last the dream turned to nightmare, and they all came hopping and hacking and maa-+ after him\n\nwith hatred gleaming in their mad yellow eyes.\n\n\"Mum! Mum!\" shouted Babe in terror.\n\n\"Maaaaa!\" said a voice next door.\n\n\"It's all right, dear,\" said Fly, \"it's all right. Was it a nasty dream?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"What were you dreaming about?\"\n\n\"Sheep, Mum.\"\n\n\"I expect it was because of that stupid old thing in there,\" said Fly. \"Shut up!\" she barked. \"Noisy old\n\nfool!\" And to Babe she said, \"Now cuddle up, dear, and go to sleep. There's nothing to be frightened\n\nof.\"\n\nShe licked his snout until it began to give out a series of regular snores. Sheep-pig indeed, she\n\nthought, why the silly boy's frightened of the things, and she put her nose on her paws and went to\n\nsleep.\n\nBabe slept soundly the rest of the night, and woke more determined than ever to learn all that he could\n\nfrom their new neighbour. As soon as Fly had gone out on her rounds, he climbed the straw stack.\n\n\"Good morning, Ma,\" he said. \"I do hope you're feeling better today?\"\n\nThe old ewe looked up. Her eyes, Babe was glad to see, looked neither mad nor hateful.\n\n\"I must say,\" she said, \"you'm a polite young chap. Not like that wolf, shouting at me in the middle of\n\nthe night. Never get no respect from they, treat you like dirt they do, bite you soon as look at you.\"\n\n\"Do they really?\"\n\n\"Oh ar. Nip your hocks if you'm a bit slow. And worse, some of them.\"\n\n\"Worse?\"\n\n\"Oh ar. Ain't you never heard of worrying?\"\n\n\"I don't worry much.\"\n\n\"No no, young un. I'm talking about sheep-worrying. You get some wolves z'll chase sheep and kill\n\n'em.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Babe, horrified. \"I'm sure Fly would never do that.\"\n\n\"Who's Fly?\"\n\n\"She's my more... she's our dog here, the one that brought you in yesterday.\"\n\n\"Is that what she's called? No, she bain't a worrier, just rude. All wolves is rude to us sheep, see,\n\nalways have been. Bark and run and nip and call us stupid. We bain't all that stupid, we do just get\n\nconfused. If only they'd just show a bit of common politeness, just treat us a bit decent. Now if you\n\nwas to come out into the field, a nice well-mannered young chap like you, and ask me to go\n\nsomewhere or do something, politely, like you would, why, I'd be only too delighted.\"\n\nChapter 5\n\n\"Keep yelling, young un\"\n\n\"Keep yelling, young un\" Mrs Hogget shook her head at least a dozen times.\n\n\"For the life of me I can't see why you do let that pig run all over the place like you do, round and\n\nround the yard he do go, chasing my ducks about, shoving his nose into everything, shouldn't wonder\n\nbut what he'll be out with you and Fly moving the sheep about afore long, why dussen't shut him up,\n\nhe's running all his flesh off, he won't never be fit for Christmas, Easter more like, what d'you call\n\nhim?\"\n\n\"Just Pig,\" said Farmer Hogget.\n\nA month had gone by since the Village Fair, a month in which a lot of interesting things had happened\n\nto Babe. The fact that perhaps most concerned his future, though he did not know it, was that Farmer\n\nHogget had become fond of him. He liked to see the piglet pottering happily about the yard with Fly,\n\nkeeping out of mischief, as far as he could tell, if you didn't count moving the ducks around. He did\n\nthis now with a good deal of skill, the farmer noticed, even to the extent of being able, once, to\n\nseparate the white ducks from the brown, though that must just have been a fluke. The more he thought\n\nof it, the less Farmer Hogget liked the idea of butchering Pig.\n\nThe other developments were in Babe's education. Despite herself, Fly found that she took pleasure\n\nand pride in teaching him the ways of the shepp-dog, though she knew that of course he would never\n\nbe fast enough to work sheep. Anyway the boss would never let him try.\n\nAs for Ma, she was back with the flock, her foot healed, her cough better. But all the time that she had\n\nbeen shut in the box, Babe had spent every moment that Fly was out of the stables chatting to the old\n\newe. Already he understood, in a way that Fly never could, the sheep's point of view. He longed to\n\nmeet the flock, to be introduced. He thought it would be extremely interesting.\n\n\"D'you think I could, Ma?\" he had said.\n\n\"Could what, young un?\"\n\n\"Well, come and visit you, when you go back to your friends?\"\n\n\"Oh ar. You could do, easy enough. You only got to go through the bottom gate and up the hill to the\n\nbig field by the lane. Don't know what the farmer'd say though. Or that wolf.\"\n\nOnce Fly had slipped quietly in and found him perched on the straw stack.\n\n\"Babe!\" she had said sharply. \"You're not talking to that stupid thing, are you?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, Mum, I was.\"\n\n\"Save your breath, dear. It won't understand a word you say.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Ma.\n\nFor a moment Babe was tempted to tell his foster-mother what he had in mind, but something told him\n\nto keep quiet. Instead he made a plan. He would wait for two things to happen. First, for Ma to rejoin\n\nthe flock. And after that for market day, when both the boss and his mum would be out of the way.\n\nThen he would go up the hill.\n\nTowards the end of the very next week the two things had happened. Ma had been turned out, and a\n\ncouple of days after that Babe watched as Fly jumped into the back of the Land Rover, and it drove\n\nout of the yard and away.\n\nBabe's were not the only eyes that watched its departure. At the top of the hill a cattle-lorry stood\n\nhalf-hidden under a clump of trees at the side of the lane. As soon as the Land-Rover had disappeared\n\nfrom sight along the road to the market town, a man jumped hurriedly out and opened the gate into the\n\nfield. Another backed the lorry into the gateway.\n\nBabe meanwhile was trotting excitedly up the hill to pay his visit to the flock. He came to the gate at\n\nthe bottom of the field and squeezed under it. The field was steep and curved, and at first he could not\n\nsee a single sheep. But then he heard a distant drumming of hooves and suddenly the whole flock\n\ncame galloping over the brow of the hill and down towards him. Around them ran two strange collies,\n\nlean silent dogs that seemed to flow effortlessly over the grass. From high above came the sound of a\n\nthin whistle, and in easy partnership the dogs swept round the sheep, and began to drive them back up\n\nthe slope.\n\nDespite himself, Babe was caught up in the press of jostling bleating animals and carried along with\n\nthem. Around him rose a chorus of panting protesting voices, some shrill, some hoarse, some deep\n\nand guttural, but all saying the same thing.\n\n\"Wolf! Wolf!\" cried the flock in dazed confusion.\n\nSmall by comparison and short in the leg, Babe soon fell behind the main body, and as they reached\n\nthe top of the hill he found himself right at the back in company with an old sheep who cried \"Wolf!\"\n\nmore loudly than any.\n\n\"Ma!\" he cried breathlessly. \"It's you!\"\n\nBehind them one dog lay down at a whistle, and in front the flock checked as the other dog steadied\n\nthem. In the corner of the field the tailboard and wings of the cattle-lorry filled the gateway, and the\n\ntwo men waited, sticks and arms outspread.\n\n\"Oh hullo, young un,\" puffed the old sheep. \"Fine day you chose to come, I'll say.\"\n\n\"What is it? What's happening? Who are these men?\" asked Babe.\n\n\"Rustlers,\" said Ma. \"They'm sheep-rustlers.\"\n\n\"What d'you mean?\"\n\n\"Thieves, young un, that's what I do mean. Sheep-stealers. We'll all be in this lorry afore you can\n\nblink your eye.\"\n\n\"What can we do?\"\n\n\"Do? Ain't nothing we can do, unless we can slip past ^theyer wolf.\"\n\nShe made as if to escape, but the dog behind darted in, and she turned back.\n\nAgain, one of the men whistled, and the dog pressed. Gradually, held against the headland of the field\n\nby the second dog and the men, the flock began to move forward. Already the leaders were nearing\n\nthe tailboard of the lorry.\n\n\"We'm beat,\" said Ma mournfully. \"You run for it, young un.\" I will, thought Babe, but not the way you\n\nmean. Little as he was, he felt suddenly not fear but anger, furious anger that the boss's sheep were\n\nbeing stolen. My mum's not here to protect them so I must, he said to himself bravely, and he ran\n\nquickly round the hedge side of the flock, and jumping on to the bottom of the tailboard, turned to face\n\nthem.\n\n\"Please!\" he cried. \"I beg you! Please don't come any further. If you would be so kind, dear sensible\n\nsheep!\"\n\nHis unexpected appearance had a number of immediate effects. The shock of being so politely\n\naddressed stopped the flock in its tracks, and the cries of \"Wolf!\" changed to murmurs of \"In't he\n\nlovely!\" and \"Proper little gennulman!\" Ma had told them something of her new friend, and now to see\n\nhim in the flesh and to hear his well-chosen words released them from the dominance of the dogs.\n\nThey began to fidget and look about for an escape route. This was opened for them when the men\n\n(cursing quietly, for above all things they were anxious to avoid too much noise) sent the flanking dog\n\nto drive the pig away, and some of the sheep began to slip past them.\n\nNext moment all was chaos. Angrily the dog ran at Babe, who scuttled away squealing at the top of\n\nhis voice in a mixture of fright and fury. The men closed on him, sticks raised. Desperately he shot\n\nbetween the legs of one, who fell with a crash, while the other, striking out madly, hit the rearguard\n\ndog as it came to help, and sent it yowling. In half a minute the carefully planned raid was ruined, as\n\nthe sheep scattered everywhere.\n\n\"Keep yelling, young un!\" bawled Ma, as she ran beside Babe. \"They won't never stop here with that\n\nrow going on!\"\n\nAnd suddenly all sorts of things began to happen as those deafening squeals rang out over the quiet\n\ncountryside. Birds flew startled from the trees, cows in nearby fields began to gallop about, dogs in\n\ndistant farms to bark, passing motorists to stop and stare. In the farmhouse below Mrs Hogget heard\n\nthe noise as she had on the day of the Fair, but now it was infinitely louder, the most piercing, nerve-\n\ntingling, ear-shattering burglar alarm. She dialled 999 but then talked for so long that by the time a\n\npatrol car drove up the lane, the rustlers had long gone. Snarling at each other and their dogs, they had\n\ndriven hurriedly away with not one single sheep to show for their pains.\n\n\"You won't never believe it!\" cried Mrs Hogget when her husband returned from market. \"But we've\n\nhad rustlers, just after you'd gone it were, come with a girt cattle-lorry they did, the police said, they\n\nseen the tyremarks in the gateway, and a chap in a car seen the lorry go by in a hurry, and there's been\n\na lot of it about, and he give the alarm, he did, kept screaming and shrieking enough to bust your\n\neardrums, we should have lost every sheep on the place if 'tweren't for him, 'tis him we've got to\n\nthank.\"\n\n\"Who?\" said Farmer Hogget.\n\n\"Him!\" said his wife, pointing at Babe who was telling Fly all about it. \"Don't ask me how he got\n\nthere or why he done it, all I knows is he saved our bacon and now I'm going to save his, he's\n\nstopping with us just like another dog, don't care if he gets so big as a house, because if you think I'm\n\ngoing to stand by and see him butchered after what he done for us today, you've got another think\n\ncoming, what d'you say to that?\"\n\nA slow smile spread over Farmer Hogget's long face.\n\nChapter 6\n\n\"Good Pig\"\n\nThe very next morning Farmer Hogget decided that he would see if the pig would like to come, when\n\nhe went round the sheep with Fly. I'm daft, he thought, grinning to himself. He did not tell his wife.\n\nSeeing him walk down the yard, crook in hand, and hearing him call Fly, Babe was about to settle\n\ndown for an after-breakfast nap when to his surprise he heard the farmer's voice again.\n\n\"Come, Pig,\" said Farmer Hogget and to his surprise the pig came.\n\n\"I expect it's because of what you did yesterday,\" said Fly proudly, as they walked to heel together up\n\nthe hill. \"The boss must be very pleased with you, dear. You can watch me working.\"\n\nWhen they reached the lower gate, Farmer Hogget opened it and left it open.\n\n\"He's going to bring them down into the home paddock, away from the lane,\" said Fly quickly. \"You\n\nbe quiet and keep out of the way,\" and she went to sit waiting by the farmer's right side.\n\n\"Come by!\" he said, and Fly ran left up the slope as the sheep began to bunch above her. Once behind\n\nthem, she addressed them in her usual way, that is to say sharply.\n\n\"Move, fools!\" she snapped. \"Down the hill. If you know which way \"down\" is,\" but to her surprise\n\nthey did not obey. Instead they turned to face her, and some even stamped, and shook their heads at\n\nher, while a great chorus of bleating began.\n\nTo Fly sheep-talk was just so much rubbish, to which she had never paid any attention, but Babe,\n\nlistening below, could hear clearly what was being said, and although the principal cry was the usual\n\none, there were other voices saying other things. The contrast between the politeness with which they\n\nhad been treated by yesterday's rescuer and the everlasting rudeness to which they were subjected by\n\nthis or any wolf brought mutinous thoughts into woolly heads, and words of defiance rang out.\n\n\"You got no manners! ... Why can't you ask nicely? ... Treat us like muck, you do!\" they cried, and one\n\nhoarse voice which the pig recognised called loudly, \"We don't want you, wolf! We want Babe!\"\n\nwhereupon they all took it up.\n\n\"We want Babe!\" they bleated. \"Babe! Babe! Ba-a-a-a-a-be!\"\n\nThose behind pushed at those in front, so that they actually edged a pace or two nearer the dog.\n\nFor a moment it seemed to Babe that Fly was not going to be able to move them, that she would lose\n\nthis particular battle of wills; but he had not reckoned with her years of experience. Suddenly, quick\n\nas a flash, she drove in on them with a growl andwitha twisting leap sprang for the nose of the\n\nforemost animal; Babe heard the clack of her teeth as the ewe fell over backwards in fright, a fright\n\nwhich immediately ran through all. Defiant no longer, the flock poured down the hill, Fly snapping\n\nfuriously at their heels, and surged wildly through the gateway.\n\n\"No manners! No manners! No ma-a-a-a-a-a-nners!\" they cried, but an air of panic ran through them\n\nas they realised how rebellious they had been. How the wolf would punish them! They ran helter-\n\nskelter into the middle of the paddock, and wheeled as one to look back, ears pricked, eyes wide with\n\nfear. They puffed and blew, and Ma's hacking cough rang out. But to their surprise they saw that the\n\nwolf had dropped by the gateway, and that after a moment the pig came trotting out to one side of\n\nthem.\n\nThough Farmer Hogget could not know what had caused the near-revolt of the flock, he saw clearly\n\nthat for some reason they had given Fly a hard time, and that she was angry. It was not like her to\n\ngallop sheep in that pell-mell fashion.\n\n\"Steady!\" he said curtly as she harried the rear-guard, and then \"Down!\" and \"Stay!\" and shut the gate.\n\nShepherding suited Farmer Hogget-- there was no waste of words in it.\n\nIn the corner of the home paddock nearest to the farm buildings was a smallish fenced yard divided\n\ninto a number of pens and runways. Here the sheep would be brought at shearing-time or to pick out\n\nfat lambs for market or to be treated for various troubles. Farmer Hogget had heard the old ewe\n\ncough; he thought he would catch her up and give her another drench. He turned to give an order to\n\nFly lying flat and still behind him, and there, lying flat and still beside her, was the pig.\n\n\"Stay, Fly!\" said Hogget. And, just for fun, \"Come, Pig!\"\n\nImmediately Babe ran forward and sat at the farmer's right, his front trotters placed neatly together,\n\nhis big ears cocked for the next command.\n\nStrange thoughts began to stir in Farmer Hogget's mind, and unconsciously he crossed his fingers.\n\nHe took a deep breath, and, holding it .... \"Away to me, Pig!\" he said softly.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation Babe began the long outrun to the right.\n\nQuite what Farmer Hogget had expected to happen, he could never afterwards clearly remember.\n\nWhat he had not expected was that the pig would run round to the rear of the flock, and turn to face it\n\nand him, and lie down instantly without a word of further command spoken, just as a well-trained dog\n\nwould have done. Admittedly, with his jerky little rocking-horse canter he took twice as long to get\n\nthere as Fly would have, but still, there he was, in the right place, ready and waiting. Admittedly, the\n\nsheep had turned to face the pig and were making a great deal of noise, but then Farmer Hogget did\n\nnot know, and Fly would not listen to, what they were saying. He called the dog to heel, and began to\n\nwalk with his long loping stride to the collecting-pen in the corner. Out in the middle of the paddock\n\nthere was a positive babble of talk.\n\n\"Good morning!\" said Babe. \"I do hope I find you all well, and not too distressed by yesterday's\n\nexperience?\" and immediately it seemed that every sheep had something to say to him.\n\n\"Bless his heart!\" they cried, and, \"Dear little soul!\" and, \"Hullo, Babe!\" and, \"Nice to see you\n\nagain!\" and then there was a rasping cough and the sound of Ma's hoarse tones.\n\n\"What's up then, young un?\" she croaked. \"What be you doing here instead of that wolf?\"\n\nAlthough Babe wanted, literally, to keep on the right side of the sheep, his loyalty to his foster-mother\n\nmade him say in a rather hurt voice, \"She's not a wolf. She's a sheep-dog.\"\n\n\"Oh all right then,\" said Ma, \"sheep-dog, if you must have it. What dost want, then?\"\n\nBabe looked at the army of long sad faces.\n\n\"I want to be a sheep-pig,\" he said.\n\n\"Ha ha!\" bleated a big lamb standing next to Ma. \"Ha ha ha-a-a-a-a!\"\n\n\"Bide quiet!\" said Ma sharply, swinging her head to give the lamb a thumping butt in the side. \"That\n\nain't nothing to laugh at.\"\n\nRaising her voice, she addressed the flock.\n\n\"Listen to me, all you ewes,\" she said, \"and lambs too. This young chap was kind to me, like I told\n\nyou, when I were poorly. And I told him, if he was to ask me to go somewhere or do something,\n\npolitely, like he would, why, I'd be only too delighted. We ain't stupid, I told him, all we do want is\n\nto be treated right, and we'm as bright as the next beast, we are.\"\n\n\"We are!\" chorused the flock. \"We are! We are! We a-a-a-a-a-are!\"\n\n\"Right then,\" said Ma. \"What shall us do, Babe?\"\n\nBabe looked across towards Farmer Hogget, who had opened the gate of the collecting-pen and now\n\nstood leaning on his crook, Fly at his feet. The pen was in the left bottom corner of the paddock, and\n\nso Babe expected, and at that moment got, the command \"Come by, Pig!\" to send him left and so\n\nbehind the sheep and thus turn them down towards the corner.\n\nHe cleared his throat. \"If I might ask a great favour of you,\" he said hurriedly, \"could you all please\n\nbe kind enough to walk down to that gate where the farmer is standing, and to go through it? Take your\n\ntime, please, there's absolutely no rush.\"\n\nA look of pure contentment passed over the faces of the flock, and with one accord they turned and\n\nwalked across the paddock, Babe a few paces in their rear. Sedately they walked, and steadily, over\n\nto the corner, through the gate, into the pen, and then stood quietly waiting. No one broke ranks or\n\ntried to slip away, no one pushed or shoved, there was no noise or fuss. From the oldest to the\n\nyoungest, they went in like lambs.\n\nThen at last a gentle murmur broke out as everyone in different ways quietly expressed their pleasure.\n\n\"Babe!\" said Fly to the pig. \"That was quite beautifully done, dear!\"\n\n\"Thank you so much!\" said Babe to the sheep. \"You did that so nicely!\"\n\n\"Ta!\" said the sheep. \"Ta! Ta! Ta-a-a-a-a-a! 'Tis a pleasure to work for such a little gennulman!\" And\n\nMa added, \"You'll make a wunnerful sheep-pig, young un, or my name's not Ma-a-a-a-a-a.\"\n\nAs for Farmer Hogget, he heard none of this, so wrapped up was he in his own thoughts. He's as good\n\nas a dog, he told himself excitedly, he's better than a dog, than any dog! I wonder ...!\n\n\"Good Pig,\" he said.\n\nThen he uncrossed his fingers and closed the gate.\n\nChapter 7\n\n\"What's trials?\"\n\nEvery day after that, of course, Babe went the rounds with Farmer Hogget and Fly. At first the farmer\n\nworried about using the pig to herd the sheep, not because it was a strange and unusual thing to do\n\nwhich people might laugh at--he did not care about that--but because he was afraid it might upset Fly\n\nand put her nose out of joint. However it did not seem to do so.\n\nHe could have spared himself the worry if he had been able to listen to their conversation.\n\n\"That was fun!\" said Babe to Fly that evening. \"I wonder if the boss will let me do some more work?\"\n\n\"I'm sure he will, dear. You did it so well. It was almost as though the sheep knew exactly what it\n\nwas you wanted them to do.\"\n\n\"But that's just it! I asked them ....\"\n\n\"No use asking sheep anything, dear,\" interrupted Fly. \"You have to make them do what you want, I've\n\ntold you before.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mum. But ... will you mind, if the boss uses me instead of you, sometimes?\"\n\n\"Mind?\" said Fly. \"You bet your trotters I won't! All my life I've had to run round after those idiots,\n\nup hill, down dale, day in, day out. And as for \"sometimes\", as far as I'm concerned you can work\n\nthem every day. I'm not as young as I was. I'll be only too happy to lie comfortably in the grass and\n\nwatch you, my Babe.\"\n\nAnd before long that was exactly what she was doing. Once Farmer Hogget could see by her wagging\n\ntail and smiling eyes that she was perfectly happy about it, he began to use Babe to do some of her\n\nwork. At first he only gave the pig simple tasks, but as the days and weeks went by, Hogget began to\n\nmake more and more use of his new helper. The speed with which Babe learned amazed him, and\n\nbefore long he was relying on him for all the work with the flock, while Fly lay and proudly watched.\n\nNow, there was nothing, it seemed, that the pig could not do, and do faultlessly, at that.\n\nHe obeyed all the usual commands immediately and correctly. He could fetch sheep or take them\n\naway, move them to left or right, persuade them round obstacles or through gaps, cut the flock in half,\n\nor take out one individual.\n\nTo drench Ma, for instance, there was no need for Hogget to bring all the sheep down to the\n\ncollecting-pen, or to corner them all and catch her by a hindleg with his crook. He could simply point\n\nher out to the pig, and Babe would gently work her out of the bunch and bring her right to the farmer's\n\nfeet, where she stood quietly waiting. It seemed like a miracle to Hogget, but of course it was simple.\n\n\"Ma!\"\n\n\"Yes, young un?\"\n\n\"The boss wants to give you some more medicine.\"\n\n\"Oh not again! 'Tis horrible stuff, that.\"\n\n\"But it'll make your cough better.\"\n\n\"Oh ar?\"\n\n\"Come along, Ma. Please.\"\n\n\"Oh all right then, young un. Anything to oblige you.\"\n\nAnd there were other far more miraculous things that Babe could easily have done if the farmer had\n\nonly known. For example when it was time for the ewes to be separated from their lambs, now almost\n\nas big and strong as their mothers, Farmer Hogget behaved like any other shepherd, and brought the\n\nwhole flock down to the pens, and took a lot of time and trouble to part them. If only he had been able\n\nto explain things to Babe, how easy it could have been.\n\n\"Dear ladies, will you please stay on the hill, if you'd be so kind?\"\n\n\"Youngsters, down you go to the collecting-pen if you please, there's good boys and girls,\" and it\n\ncould have been done in the shake of a lamb's tail.\n\nHowever Babe's increasing skill at working sheep determined Farmer Hogget to take the next step in\n\na plan which had begun to form in his mind on the day when the piglet had first penned the sheep. That\n\nstep was nothing less than to take Pig with him to the local sheep-dog trials in a couple of weeks'\n\ntime. Only just to watch of course, just so that he could have a look at well-trained dogs working a\n\nsmall number of sheep, and see what they and their handlers were required to do. I'm daft, he thought,\n\ngrinning to himself. He did not tell his wife.\n\nBefore the day came, he put a collar and lead on the pig. He could not risk him running away, in a\n\nstrange place. He kept him on the lead all one morning, letting Fly do the work as of old. He need not\n\nhave bothered--Babe would have stayed tight at heel when told--but it was interesting to note the\n\ninstant change in the atmosphere as the collie ran out.\n\n\"Wolf! Wolf!\" cried the flock, every sheep immediately on edge.\n\n\"Move, fools!\" snapped Fly, and she hustled them and bustled them with little regard for their\n\nfeelings.\n\n\"Babe! We want Babe!\" they bleated. \"Ba-a-a-a-a-a-be!\"\n\nTo be sure, the work was done more quickly, but at the end of it the sheep were in fear and trembling\n\nand the dog out of patiience and breath.\n\n\"Steady! Steady!\" called the farmer a number of times, something he never had to say to Babe.\n\nWhen the day came for the local trials, Farmer Hogget set off early in the Land Rover, Fly and Babe\n\nin the back. He told his wife where he was going, though not that he was taking the pig. Nor did he\n\nsay that he did not intend to be an ordinary spectator, but instead more of a spy, to see without being\n\nseen. He wanted Pig to observe everything that went on without being spotted. now that he had settled\n\non the final daring part of his plan, Hogget realised that secrecy was all-important. No one must know\n\nthat he owned a ... what would you call him, he thought ... a sheep-pig, I suppose!\n\nThe trials took place ten miles or so away, in a curved basin-shaped valley in the hills. At the lower\n\nend of the basin was a road. Close to this was the starting point, where the dogs would begin their\n\noutrun, and also the enclosure where they would finally pen their sheep. Down there all the spectators\n\nwould gather. Farmer Hogget, arriving some time before them, parked the Land Rover in a lane, and\n\nset off up the valley by a roundabout way, keeping in the shelter of the bordering woods, Fly padding\n\nbehind him and Babe on the lead trotting to keep up with his long strides.\n\n\"Where are we going, Mum?\" said Babe excitedly. \"What are we going to do?\"\n\n\"I don't think we're going to do anything, dear,\" said Fly. \"I think the boss wants you to see\n\nsomething.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThey had reached the head of the valley now, and the farmer found a suitable place to stop, under\n\ncover, but with a good view of the course.\n\n\"Down, Fly, down, Pig, and stay,\" he said and exhausted by this long speech, stretched his long frame\n\non the ground and settled down to wait.\n\n\"Wants me to see what?\" said Babe.\n\n\"The trials.\"\n\n\"What's trials?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Fly, \"it's a sort of competition, for sheep-dogs and their bosses. Each dog has to fetch\n\nfive sheep, and move them through a number of gaps and gateways--you can see which ones, they've\n\ngot flags on either side--down to that circle that's marked out in the field right at the bottom, and there\n\nthe dog has to shed some sheep.\"\n\n\"What's \"shed\" mean?\"\n\n\"Separate them out from the rest; the ones to be shed will have collars on.\"\n\n\"And then what?\"\n\n\"Then the dog has to gather them all again, and pen them.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"It's not easy, dear. Not like moving that bunch of woolly fools of ours up and down a field. It all has\n\nto be done quickly, without any mistakes. You lose points if you make mistakes.\"\n\n\"Have you ever been in a trial, Mum?\"\n\n\"Yes. Here. When I was younger.\"\n\n\"Did you make any mistakes?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Fly. \"Everyone does. It's very difficult, working a small number of strange sheep, in\n\nstrange country. You'll see.\"\n\nBy the end of the day Babe had seen a great deal. The course was not an easy one, and the sheep were\n\nvery different from those at home. They were fast and wild, and, good though the dogs were, there\n\nwere many mistakes made, at the gates, in the shedding-ring, at the final penning.\n\nBabe watched every run intently,, and Hogget watched Babe, and Fly watched them both.\n\nWhat's the boss up to, she thought, as they drove home. He's surely never thinking that one day Babe\n\nmight ... no, he couldn't be that daft! Sheep-pig indeed! All right for the little chap to run round our\n\nplace for a bit of fun, but to think of him competing in trials, even a little local one like today's, well,\n\nreally! She remembered something he had said in his early duck-herding days.\n\n\"I suppose you'd say,\" she remarked, \"that those dogs just weren't polite enough?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Babe.\n\nChapter 8\n\n\"Oh Ma!\"\n\nFly's suspicions about what the farmer was up to grew rapidly over the next weeks. It soon became\n\nobvious to her that he was constructing, on his own land, a practice course. From the top of the field\n\nwhere the rustlers had come, the circuit which he laid out ran all round the farm, studded with hazards\n\nto be negotiated. Some were existing gateways or gaps. Some he made, with hurdles, or lines of posts\n\nbetween which the sheep had to be driven. Some were extremely difficult. One, for example, a plank\n\nbridge over a stream, was so narrow that it could only be crossed in single file, and the most honeyed\n\nwords were needed from Babe to persuade the animals to cross.\n\nThen, in the home paddock, Hogget made a rough shedding-ring with a circle of large stones, and\n\nbeyond it, a final pen, a small hurdle enclosure no bigger than a tiny room, with a gate to close its\n\nmouth when he pulled on a rope.\n\nEvery day the farmer would send Fly to cut out five sheep from the flock, and take them to the top of\n\nthe hill, and hold them there. Then, starting Babe from the gate at the lower end of the farmyard,\n\nHogget would send him away to run them through the course.\n\n\"Away to me, Pig!\" he would say, or \"Come by, Pig!\" and off Babe would scamper as fast as his\n\ntrotters could carry him, as the farmer pulled out his big old pocket watch and noted the time. There\n\nwas only one problem. His trotters wouldn't carry him all that fast.\n\nHere at home, Fly realised, his lack of speed didn't matter much. Whichever five sheep were selected\n\nwere only too anxious to oblige Babe, and would huury eagerly to do whatevere he wanted. But with\n\nstrange sheep it will be different, thought Fly. If the boss really does intend to run him in a trial.\n\nWhich it looks as though he does! She watched his tubby pinky-white shape as he crested the hill.\n\nThat evening at suppertime she watched again as he tucked into his food. Up till now it had never\n\nworried her how much he ate. He's a growing boy, she had thought fondly. Now she thought, he's a\n\ngreedy boy too.\n\n\"Babe,\" she said, as with a grunt of content he licked the last morsels off the end of his snout. His\n\nlittle tin trough was as shiningly clean as though Mrs Hogget had washed it in her sink, and his tummy\n\nwas as tight as a drum.\n\n\"Yes, Mum?\"\n\n\"You like being a ... sheep-pig, don't you?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Mum!\"\n\n\"And you'd like to be really good at it, wouldn't you? The greatest? Better than any other sheep-pig?\"\n\n\"D'you think there are any others?\"\n\n\"Well, no. Better than any sheep-dog, then?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I'd love to be! But I don't really think that's possible. You see, although sheep do seem to go\n\nvery well for me, and do what I ask ... I mean, do what I tell them, I'm nothing like as fast as a dog and\n\nnever could be.\"\n\n\"No. But you could be a jolly sight faster than you are.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Well, there are two things you'd have to do, dear,\" said Fly.\n\n\"First, you'd have to go into proper training. One little run around a day's not enough. You'd have to\n\npractise hard--jogging, cross-country running, sprinting, distance work. I'd help you of course.\"\n\nIt all sounded fun to Babe.\n\n\"Great!\" he said. \"But you said \"two things\". What's the second?\"\n\n\"Eat less,\" said Fly. \"You'd have to go on a diet.\"\n\nAny ordinary pig would have rebelled at this point. Pigs enjoy eating, and they also enjoy lying\n\naround most of the day thinking about eating again. But Babe was no ordinary pig, and he set out\n\nenthusiastically to do what Fly suggested.\n\nUnder her watchful eye he ate wisely but not too well, and every afternoon he trained, to a programme\n\nwhich she had worked out, trotting right round the boundaries of the farm perhaps, or running up to the\n\ntop of the hill and back again, or racing up and down the home paddock. Hogget thought that Pig was\n\njust playing, but he couldn't help noticing how he had grown; not fatter, as a sty-kept pig would have\n\ndone, but stronger and wirier. There was nothing of the piglet about him any more; he looked lean and\n\nracy and hard-muscled, and he was now almost as big as the sheep he herded. And the day came\n\nwhen that strength and hardness were to stand him in good stead.\n\nOne beautiful morning, when the sky was clear and cloudless, and the air so crisp and fresh that you\n\ncould almost taste it, Babe woke feeling on top of the world. Like a trained athlete, he felt so charged\n\nwith energy that he simply couldn't keep still. He bounced about the stable floor on all four feet,\n\nshaking his head about and uttering a series of short sharp squeaks.\n\n\"You're full of it this morning,\" said Fly with a yawn. \"You'd better run to the top of the hill and back\n\nto work it off.\"\n\n\"OK Mum!\" said Babe, and off he shot while Fly settled comfortably back in the straw.\n\nDashing across the home paddock, Babe bounded up the hill and looked about for the sheep. Though\n\nhe knew he would see them later on, he felt so pleased with life that he thought he would like to share\n\nthat feeling with Ma and all the others, before he ran home again; just to say \"Hello! Good morning,\n\neverybody! Isn't it a lovely day!\" They were, he knew, in the most distant of all the fields on the farm,\n\nright away up at the top of the lane.\n\nHe looked across, expecting that they would be grazing quietly or lying comfortably and cudding in\n\nthe morning sun, only to see them galloping madly in every direction. On the breeze came cries of\n\n\"Wolf!\" but not in the usual bored, almost automatic, tones of complaint that they used when Fly\n\nworked them. These were yells of real terror, desperate calls for help. As he watched, two other\n\nanimals came in sight, one large, one small, and he heard the sound of barking and yapping as they\n\ndashed about after the fleeing sheep. \"You get some wolves z'll chase sheep and kill 'em\"--Ma's exact\n\nwords came back to Babe, and without a second thought he set off as fast as he could go in the\n\ndirection of the noise.\n\nWhat a sight greeted him when he arrived in the far field! The flock, usually so tightly bunched, was\n\nscattered everywhere, eyes bulging, mouths open, heads hanging in their evident distress, and it was\n\nclear that the dogs had been at their worrying for some time. A few sheep had tried in their terror to\n\njump the wire fencing and had become caught up in it, some had fallen into the ditches and got stuck.\n\nSome were limping as they ran about, and on the grass were lumps of wool torn from others.\n\nMost dreadful of all, in the middle of the field, the worriers had brought down a ewe, which lay on its\n\nside feebly kicking at them as they growled and tugged at it.\n\nOn the day when the rustlers had come, Babe had felt a mixture of fear and anger. Now he knew\n\nnothing but a blind rage, and he charged flat out at the two dogs, grunting and snorting with fury.\n\nNearest to him was the smaller dog, a kind of mongrel terrier, which was snapping at one of the ewe's\n\nhindlegs, deaf to everything in the excitement of the worry.\n\nBefore it could move, Babe took it across the back and flung it to one side, and the force of his rush\n\ncarried him on into the bigger dog and knocked it flying.\n\nThis one, a large black crossbred, part collie, part retriever, was made of sterner stuff than the terrier,\n\nwhich was already running dazedly away; and it picked itself up and came snarling back at the pig.\n\nPerhaps, in the confusion of the moment, it thought that this was just another sheep that had somehow\n\nfound courage to attack it; but if so, it soon knew\n\nbetter, for as it came on, Babe chopped at it with his terrible pig's bite, the bite that grips and tears,\n\nand now it was not sheep's blood that was spilled.\n\nHowling in pain, the black dog turned and ran, his tail between his legs. He ran, in fact, for his life, an\n\nopen-mouthed bristling pig hard on his heels.\n\nThe field was clear, and Babe suddenly came back to his senses. He turned and hurried to the fallen\n\newe, round whom, now that the dogs had gone, the horrified flock was beginning to gather in a rough\n\ncircle. She lay still now, as Babe stood panting by her side, a draggled side where the worriers had\n\npulled at it, and suddenly he realised. It was Ma!\n\n\"Ma!\" he cried. \"Ma! Are you all right?\"\n\nShe did not seem too badly hurt. He could not see any gaping wounds, though blood was coming from\n\none ear where the dogs had bitten it.\n\nThe old ewe opened an eye. Her voice, when she spoke, was as hoarse as ever, but now not much\n\nmore than a whisper.\n\n\"Hullo, young un,\" she said.\n\nBabe dropped his head and gently licked the ear to try to stop the bleeding, and some blood stuck to\n\nhis snout.\n\n\"Can you get up?\" he asked.\n\nFor some time Ma did not answer, and he looked anxiously at her, but the eye that he could see was\n\nstill open.\n\n\"I don't reckon,\" she said.\n\n\"It's all right, Ma,\" Babe said. \"The wolves have gone, far away.\"\n\n\"Far, far, fa-a-a-a-a-ar!\" chorused the flock.\n\n\"And Fly and the boss will soon be here to look after you.\"\n\nMa made no answer or movement. Only her ribs jumped to the thump of her tired old heart.\n\n\"You'll be all right, honestly you will,\" said Babe.\n\n\"Oh ar,\" said Ma, and then the eye closed and the ribs jumped no more.\n\n\"Oh Ma!\" said Babe, and \"Ma! Ma! Ma-a-a-a-a-a!\" mourned the flock, as the Land Rover came up the\n\nlane.\n\nFarmer Hogget had heard nothing of the worrying--the field was too far away, the wind in the wrong\n\ndirection--but he had been anxious, and so by now had Fly, because Pig was nowhere to be found.\n\nThe moment they entered the field both man and dog could see that something was terribly wrong.\n\nWhy else was the flock so obviously distressed, panting and gasping and dishevelled? Why had they\n\nformed that ragged circle, and what was in the middle of it? Farmer Hogget strode forward, Fly\n\nbefore him parting the ring to make way, only to see a sight that struck horror into the hearts of both.\n\nThere before them lay a dead ewe, and bending over it was the pig, his snout almost touching the\n\noutstretched neck, a snout, they saw, that was stained with blood.\n\nChapter 9\n\n\"Was it Babe?\"\n\n\"Go home, Pig!\" said Farmer Hogget in a voice that was so quiet and cold that Babe hardly\n\nrecognised it. Bewildered, he trotted off obediently, while behind him the farmer picked up the dead\n\newe and carried it to the Land Rover. Then with Fly's help he began the task of rescuing those sheep\n\nthat were caught or stuck, and of making sure that no others were badly hurt. This done, he left Fly to\n\nguard the flock, and drove home.\n\nBack at the farm, Babe felt simply very very sad. The sky was still cloudless, the air still crisp, but\n\nthis was a very different pig from the one that had cantered carefree up the hill not half an hour ago. In\n\nthose thirty minutes he had seen naked fear and cruelty and death, and now to cap it all, the boss was\n\nangry with him, had sent him home in some sort of disgrace. What had he done wrong? He had only\n\ndone his duty, as a good sheep-pig should. He sat in the doorway of the stables and watched as the\n\nLand Rover drove into the yard, poor Ma's head lolling loosely over the back. He saw the boss get\n\nout and go into the house, and then, a few minutes later, come out again, carrying something in the\n\ncrook of one arm, a long thing, a kind of black shiny tube, and walk towards him.\n\n\"Come, Pig,\" said Farmer Hogget in that same cold voice, and strode past him into the stables, while\n\nat the same moment, inside the farmhouse, the telephone began to ring, and then stopped as Mrs\n\nHogget picked it up.\n\nObediently Babe followed the farmer into the dark interior. It was not so dark however that he could\n\nnot see clearly that the boss was pointing the black shiny tube at him, and he sat down again and\n\nwaited, supposing that perhaps it was some machine for giving out food and that some quite\n\nunexpected surprise would come out of its two small round mouths, held now quite close to his face.\n\nAt that instant Mrs Hogget's voice sounded across the yard, calling her husband's name from the open\n\nkitchen window. He frowned, lowered the shiny tube, and poked his head around the stable door.\n\n\"Oh there you are!\" called Mrs Hogget. \"What dost think then, that was the police that was, they'm\n\nringing every farmer in the district to warn 'em, there's sheep-worrying dogs about, they killed six\n\nsheep t'other side of the valley only last night, they bin seen they have, two of 'em 'tis, a big black un\n\nand a little brown un, they say to shoot 'em on sight if you do see 'em, you better get back up the hill\n\nand make sure ours is all right, d'you want me to fetch your gun?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Farmer Hogget. \"It's all right,\" he said.\n\nHe waited till his wife had shut the window and disappeared, and then he walked out into the sunlight\n\nwith Babe following.\n\n\"Sit, Pig,\" he said, but now his voice was warm and kindly again.\n\nHe looked closely at the trusting face turned up to his, and saw, sticking to the side of Babe's mouth,\n\nsome hairs, some black hairs, and a few brown ones too.\n\nHe shook his head in wonder, and that slow grin spread over his face.\n\n\"I reckon you gave them summat to worry about,\" he said, and he broke the gun and took out the\n\ncartridges. Meanwhile Fly, standing guard up in the far field, was terribly agitated. She knew of\n\ncourse that some dogs will attack sheep, sometimes even the very dogs trained to look after them, but\n\nsurely not her sheep-pig? Surely Babe could not have done such a thing? Yet there he had been at the\n\ncentre of that scene of chaos, bloodstained and standing over the dead ewe! What would the boss do\n\nto him, what perhaps had he already done? Yet she could not leave these fools to find out.\n\nAt least though, she suddenly realised, they could tell her what had happened, if the shock hadn't\n\ndriven what little sense they had out of their stupid heads. Never before in her long life had Fly sunk\n\nto engaging a sheep in conversation. They were there to be ordered about, like soldiers, and, like\n\nsoldiers, never to answer back. She approached the nearest one, with distaste, and it promptly backed\n\naway from her.\n\n\"Stand still, fool!\" she barked. \"And tell me who chased you. Who killed that old one?\"\n\n\"Wolf,\" said the sheep automatically.\n\nFly growled with annoyance. Was that the only word the halfwits knew? She put the question\n\ndifferently.\n\n\"Was it the pig that chased you? Was it Babe?\" she said.\n\n\"Ba-a-a-a-abe!\" bleated the sheep eagerly.\n\n\"What does that mean, bonehead?\" barked Fly. \"Was it or wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Wolf,\" said the sheep.\n\nSomehow Fly controlled her anger at the creature's stupidity. I must know what happened, she\n\nthought. Babe's always talking about being polite to these woolly idiots. I'll have to try it. I must\n\nknow. She took a deep breath.\n\n\"Please ...\" she said. The sheep, which had begun to graze, raised its head sharply and stared at her\n\nwith an expression of total amazement.\n\n\"Say that agai-ai-ai-ain,\" it said, and a number of others, overhearing, moved towards the collie.\n\n\"Please,\" said Fly, swallowing hard, \"could you be kind enough to tell me ....\"\n\n\"Hark!\" interrupted the first sheep. \"Hark! Ha-a-a-a-ark!\" whereupon the whole flock ran and\n\ngathered round. They stood in silence, every eye fixed wonderingly on her, every mouth hanging open.\n\nnincompoops! thought Fly. Just when I wanted to ask one quietly the whole fat-headed lot come\n\nround. But I must know. I must know the truth about my Babe, however terrible it is.\n\n\"Please,\" she said once more in a voice choked with the effort of being humble, \"could you be kind\n\nenough to tell me what happened this morning? Did Babe ...?\" but she got no further, for at the mention\n\nof the pig's name the whole flock burst out into a great cry of \"Ba-a-a-a-abe!\"\n\nListening, for the first time ever, to what the sheep were actually saying, Fly could hear individual\n\nvoices competing to make themselves heard, in what was nothing less than a hymn of praise. \"Babe\n\nca-a-a-a-ame!\" \"He sa-a-a-a-aved us!\" \"He drove the wolves awa-a-a-a-ay!\" \"He made them pa-a-a-\n\na-ay!\" \"Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hoora-a-a-ay!\"\n\nWhat a sense of relief flooded over her as she heard and understood the words of the sheep! It had\n\nbeen sheep-worriers, after all! And her boy had come to the rescue! He was not the villain, he was\n\nthe hero!\n\nHogget and Babe heard the racket as they climbed the hill, and the farmer sent the pig ahead, fearing\n\nthat perhaps the worriers had returned.\n\nUnder cover of the noise Babe arrived on the scene unnoticed by Fly, just in time to hear her reply.\n\n\"Oh thank you!\" she cried to the flock. \"Thank you all so much for telling me! How kind of you!\"\n\n\"Gosh, Mum,\" said a voice behind her. \"What's come over you?\"\n\nChapter 10\n\n\"Get it off by heart\"\n\nBecause Babe had now saved the flock not only from rustlers but also from the worriers, the Hoggets\n\ncould not do too much for him.\n\nBecause he was a pig (though Farmer Hogget increasingly found himself thinking of Pig as Dog and\n\nfed him accordingly), they gave him unlimited supplies of what they supposed he could not have too\n\nmuch of--namely, food.\n\nBecause he was strong-minded and revelled in his newfound speed, he ate sparingly of it.\n\nBecause there was always a lot left over, Fly became fat and the chickens chubby and the ducks\n\ndumpy, and the very rats and mice rolled happily about the stables with stomachs full to bursting.\n\nMrs Hogget even took to calling Babe to the back door, to feed him some titbit or other that she\n\nthought he might particularly fancy; and from here it was but a short step to inviting him into the\n\nhouse, which one day she did.\n\nWhen the farmer came in for his tea, he found not only Fly but also Pig lying happily asleep beside the\n\nAga cooker. And afterwards, when he sat down in his armchair in the sitting-room and switched on\n\nthe television, Babe came to sit beside him, and they watched the six o'clock news together.\n\n\"He likes it,\" said Hogget to his wife when she came into the room. Mrs Hogget nodded her head a\n\ngreat many times, and as usual had a few words to say on the subject.\n\n\"Dear little chap, though you can't call him little no longer, he've growed so much, why, he's big\n\nenough to you-know-what, not that we ever shall now, over my dead body though I hopes it ain't if\n\nyou see what I do mean, just look at him, we should have brought him in the house long ago, no reason\n\nwhy not, is there now?\"\n\n\"He might mess the carpet,\" said Farmer Hogget.\n\n\"Never!\" cried Mrs Hogget, shaking her head the entire time that she was speaking. \"He's no more\n\nlikely to mess than he is to fly, he'll ask to go out when he wants to do his do's, just like a good clean\n\ndog would, got more brains than a dog he has, why t'wdn't surprise me to hear he was rounding up\n\nthem old sheep of yourn, 'twoodn't honestly, though I suppose you think I'm daft?\"\n\nFarmer Hogget grinned to himself. He did not tell his wife what she had never yet noticed, that all the\n\nwork of the farm was now done by the sheep-pig. And he had no intention of telling her of the final\n\npart of his plan, which was nothing less than to enter Pig in that sternest of all tests, the Grand\n\nChallenge Sheep Dog Trials, open to all comers! Never in his working life had he owned an animal\n\ngood enough to compete in these Trials. Now at last he had one, and he was not going to be stopped\n\nfrom realising his ambition by the fact that it was a pig.\n\nIn a couple of weeks they would be competing against the best sheep-dogs in the country, would be\n\nappearing, in fact, on that very television screen they were now watching.\n\n\"No, you're not daft,\" he said.\n\nBut you won't half get a surprise when you sit here and watch it he thought. And so will a lot of other\n\nfolks.\n\nHis plan was simple. He would appear at the Grand Challenge Trials with Fly, and at the last\n\npossible moment swap her for Pig. By then it would be too late for anyone to stop him. It didn't matter\n\nwhat happened afterwards--they could disqualify him, fine him, send him to prison, anything--as long\n\nas he could run Pig, just one glorious run, just to show them all!\n\nAnd they couldn't say they hadn't been warned--the name was there on the entry form. He had been\n\nworried, for he was a truthful man, that the heading might say \"Name of Dog\", and then whatever he\n\nput would be a lie. But he'd been lucky. \"Name of Competitor\" (the form said) ... \"F. Hogget:. \"Name\n\nof Entry\" ... \"Pig\".\n\nThe simple truth.\n\nShepherds usually give their dogs short names, like Gyp or Moss--it's so much quicker and easier\n\nthan shouting \"Bartholomew!\" or \"Wilhelmina!\"--and though someone might say \"\"Pig\"? That's a\n\nfunny name,\" no one in their wildest dreams would guess that simple truth.\n\nThe two weeks before the Grand Challenge Trials were two weeks of concentrated activity. Apart\n\nfrom Mrs Hogget who as usual was busy with household duties, everyone now knew what was going\n\non. To begin with, Hogget altered the practice course, cutting out all the frills like the plank bridge\n\nover the stream, and building a new course as like as possible to what he thought they might face on\n\nthe day.\n\nAs soon as Fly saw this, she became convinced that the plan which she had suspected was actually\n\ngoing to be put into operation, and she told the sheep, with whom she was now on speaking terms.\n\nEvery night of course she and Babe talked endlessly about the coming challenge before they settled to\n\nsleep (in the stables still, though the Hoggets would have been perfectly happy for Babe to sleep in\n\nthe house, so well-mannered was he).\n\nThoughtful as ever, Babe was anxious, not about his own abilities but about his foster-mother's\n\nfeelings. He felt certain she would have given her dog-teeth to compete in the National Trials, the\n\ndream of every sheep-dog, yet she must sit and watch him.\n\n\"Are you sure you don't mind, Mum?\" he asked.\n\nFly's reply was as practical as ever.\n\n\"Listen, Babe,\" she said. \"First of all it wouldn't matter whether I minded or not. The boss is going to\n\nrun you, no doubt of it. Second, I'm too old and too fat, and anyway I was only ever good enough for\n\nsmall local competitions. And lastly, I'll be the happiest collie in the world if you win. And you can\n\nwin.\"\n\n\"D'you really think so?\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it,\" said Fly firmly, but all the same she was anxious too--about one thing.\n\nShe knew that the sheep-pig, speedy as he now was, would still be much slower than the dogs,\n\nespecially on the outrun; but equally she was confident that he could make this up by the promptness\n\nwith which the sheep obeyed his requests. Here, at home, they shot through gaps or round obstacles as\n\nquick as a flash, never putting a foot wrong; the ones to be shed nipped out of the ring like lightning;\n\nand at the final penning, they popped in the instant that the boss opened the gate. But that was here, at\n\nhome. What would strange sheep do? How would they react to Babe? Would he be able to\n\ncommunicate with them, in time, for there would be none to waste?\n\nShe determined to ask the flock, and one evening when Babe and the boss were watching television,\n\nshe trotted off up the hill. Since that first time when she had been forced to speak civilly to them, they\n\nno longer cried \"Wolf!\" at her, and now they gathered around attentively at her first words, words that\n\nwere carefully polite.\n\n\"Good evening,\" said Fly. \"I wonder if you could be kind enough to help me? I've a little problem,\"\n\nand she explained it, speaking slowly and carefully (for sheep are stupid, she said to herself: nobody\n\nwill ever persuade me otherwise.)\n\n\"You see what I mean?\" she finished. \"There they'll be, these strange sheep, and I'm sure they'll do\n\nwhat he tells them ... asks them, I mean ... eventually, but it'll all take time, explaining things. The last\n\ncreature they'll be expecting to see is a pig, and they might just bolt at the sight of him, before he even\n\ngets a chance to speak to them.\"\n\n\"Password,\" said several voices.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Fly said.\n\n\"Password, password, Pa-a-a-a-assword!\" said many voices now, speaking slowly and carefully (for\n\nwolves are stupid, they said to themselves: nobody will ever persuade us otherwise.)\n\n\"What our Babe's got to do,\" said one, \"is to larn what all of us larned when we was little lambs.\"\n\n\"'Tis a saying, see,\" said another, \"as lambs do larn at their mothers' hocks.\"\n\n\"And then wherever we do go ....\"\n\n\"... to ma-a-a-a-arket ....\"\n\n\"... or to another fa-a-a-a-arm ....\"\n\n\"... we won't never come to no ha-a-a-a-arm ....\"\n\n\"... so long as we do say the pa-a-a-assword!\"\n\n\"And if our Babe do say it to they ....\"\n\n\"... why then, they won't never run away!\"\n\nFly felt her patience slipping, but she controlled herself, knowing how important this information\n\ncould be.\n\n\"Please,\" she said quietly, \"please will you tell me the password?\"\n\nFor a long moment the flock stood silent, the only movement a turning of heads as they looked at one\n\nanother. Fly could sense that they were nerving themselves to tell this age-old secret, to give away--to\n\na wolf, of all things--this treasured countersign.\n\nThen \"'Tis for Babe,\" someone said, \"'tis for his sa-a-a-ake.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" they all said softly. \"A-a-a-a-a-a-ah!\" and then with one voice they began to intone:\n\n\"I may be ewe, I may be ram, I may be mutton, may be lamb, But on the hoof or on the hook, I bain't so\n\nstupid as I look.\"\n\nThen by general consent they began to move away, grazing as they went.\n\n\"Is that it?\" called Fly after them. \"Is that the password?\" and the murmur came back \"A-a-a-a-a-a-a-\n\na-a-a-ar!\"\n\n\"But what does it all mean, Mum?\" said Babe that night when she told him. \"All that stuff about \"I may\n\nbe you\" and other words I don't understand. It doesn't make sense to me.\"\n\n\"That doens't matter, dear,\" said Fly. \"You just get it off by heart. It may make all the difference on the\n\nday.\"\n\nChapter 11\n\n\"Today is the day\"\n\nThe day, when it dawned, was just that little bit too bright.\n\nOn the opposite side of the valley the trees and houses and haystacks stood out clearly against the\n\nbackground in that three-dimensional way that means rain later.\n\nFarmer Hogget came out and sniffed the air and looked around. Then he went inside again to fetch\n\nwaterproof clothing.\n\nFly knew, the moment that she set eyes on the boss, that this was the day. Dogs have lived so long\n\nwith humans that they know what's going to happen, sometimes even before their owners do. She\n\nwoke Babe.\n\n\"Today,\" she said.\n\n\"Today what, Mum?\" said Babe sleepily.\n\n\"Today is the day of the Grand Challenge Sheep-dog Trials,\" said Fly proudly. \"Which you, dear,\"\n\nshe added in a confident voice, \"are going to win!\" With a bit of luck, she thought, and tenderly she\n\nlicked the end of his snout.\n\nShe looked critically at the rest of him, anxious as any mum that her child should be well turned out if\n\nit is to appear in public.\n\n\"Oh Babe!\" she said \"Your coat's in an awful mess. What have you been doing with yourself? You\n\nlook just as though you've been wallowing in the duckpond.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You mean you have?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mum.\"\n\nFly was on the point of saying that puppies don't do such things, when she remembered that he was,\n\nafter all, a pig.\n\n\"Well, I don't know about Large White,\" she said. \"You've certainly grown enormous but it's anyone's\n\nguess what colour you are under all that muck. Whatever's to be done?\"\n\nImmediately her question was answered.\n\n\"Come, Pig,\" said Hogget's voice from the yard, and when they came out of the stables, there stood\n\nthe farmer with hosepipe and scrubbing brush and pails of soapy water.\n\nHalf an hour later, when a beautifully clean shining Babe stood happily dripping while Hogget\n\nbrushed out the tassle of his tight-curled tail till it looked like candy-floss, Mrs Hogget stuck her head\n\nout of the kitchen window.\n\n\"Breakfast's ready,\" she called, \"but what in the world bist doing with thik pig, taking him to a pig\n\nshow or summat, I thought you was going to drive up and watch the Trials today, anybody'd think you\n\nwas going to enter 'e in them the way you've got un done up, only he wouldn't be a sheep-dog, he'd be\n\na sheep-pig wouldn't 'e, tee hee, whoever heard of such a thing, I must be daft though it's you that's\n\ndaft really, carrying him about in the poor old Land Rover the size he is now, the bottom'll fall out, I\n\nshouldn't wonder, you ain't surely going to drive all that way with him in the back just so's he can\n\nwatch?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Farmer Hogget.\n\nMrs Hogget considered this answer for a moment with her mouth open, while raising and lowering\n\nher eyebrows, shaking her head, and drumming on the window-sill with her finger-tips. Then she\n\nclosed her mouth and the window.\n\nAfter breakfast she came out to see them off. Fly was sitting in the passenger seat, Babe was\n\ncomfortable in a thick bed of clean straw in the back, of which he now took up the whole space.\n\nMrs Hogget walked round the Land Rover, giving out farewell pats.\n\n\"Good boy,\" she said to Babe, and \"Good girl,\" to Fly. And to Hogget, \"Goodbye and have you got\n\nyour sandwiches and your thermos of coffee and your raincoat, looks as if it might rain, thought I felt a\n\nspot just now though I suppose it might be different where you'm going seeing as it's a hundred miles\n\naway, that reminds me have you got enough petrol or if not enough money to get some if you haven't if\n\nyou do see what I do mean, drive carefully, see you later.\"\n\n\"Two o'clock,\" said Hogget. And before his wife had time to say anything, added, \"On the telly.\n\nLive,\" and put the Land Rover into gear and drove away.\n\nWhen Mrs Hogget switched the television on at two o'clock, the first thing in the picture that she\n\nnoticed was that it was raining hard. She dashed outside to fetch her washing in, saw that the sun was\n\nshining, remembered it wasn't washing-day anyway, and came back to find the cameras showing the\n\nlay-out of the course. First there was a shot of a huge pillar of stone, the height of a man, standing\n\nupright in the ground.\n\n\"Here,\" said the voice of the commentator, \"is where each handler will stand, and from here each dog\n\nwill start his outrun; he can go left or right, to get into position behind his sheep; today each dog will\n\nhave ten sheep to work; they will be grouped near that distant post, called the Holding Post,\" (all the\n\ntime the cameras followed his explanations), \"and then he must fetch his sheep, through the Fetch\n\nGates, all the way back to the Handler's Post, and round it; then the dog drives the sheep away--to the\n\nleft as we look at it--through the Drive Away Gates, turns them right again and straight across the line\n\nof his fetch, through the Cross Drive Gates, and right again to the Shedding Ring, and when he's shed\n\nhis sheep and collected them again, then finally he must pen them here.\"\n\n\"Mouthy old thing!\" said Mrs Hogget, turning the sound off. \"Some folk never know how to hold their\n\ntongues, keeping on and on about them silly gates, why don't 'e show us a picture of the spectators,\n\nmight catch a glimpse of Hogget and Fly, you never knows, though not the pig, I hopes, he's surely not\n\ndaft enough to walk about with the pig, can't see why he wanted to take un all that way just to lie in\n\nthe back of the Land Rover, he'd have done better to leave un here and let un sit and watch it on the\n\ntelly in comfort which is more than some of us have got time for, I got work to do,\" and she stumped\n\noff into the kitchen, shaking her head madly.\n\nOn the silent screen the first handler walked out and took up his position beside the great sarsen-\n\nstone, his dog standing by him, tense and eager in the pouring rain."
