        "text": "If the TV show Through The Keyhole visited Dick\n\nKing-Smiths cosy cottage it wouldnt take the contestants long to work out who lives there.\n\nPlump model pigs in wood, china and brass stand on the windowsills of almost every room.\n\nThe mugs on hooks above the Aga are all decorated with pigs, and a cartoon of yet another pig with the legend Grandpa, I saw this and thought of you hangs on the kitchen wall alongside the biggest giveaway of all - a poster from the film Babe.\n\nWriting my books is like handing out presents. Giving children pleasure gives you a wonderful sort of Father Christmassy feeling. Dick King-Smith\n\nThe hit 1995 movie about the adventures of a talking pig was based on Dicks book The Sheep-Pig.\n\nHe had already made quite a name for himself as a childrens author after publishing his first book in 1976, but the success of the film that charmed audiences the world over catapulted him to global fame.\n\nThe movie was a pleasant surprise to the author who had qualms about what Hollywood would do with his story.\n\n\"One of the nicest things was that the actor who played Farmer Hogget on screen was the image of the man I had in my head eight or nine years before, right down to the last eyelash.\"\n\nThe moneyspinning business that Babe and Dicks books have become is a change of fortunes that he could scarcely have dreamed of 30 years earlier when he was struggling  and failing - to make ends meet as a Gloucestershire farmer.\n\nThe story of Babe was inspired by Dick's own farming experiences - and changed his life\n\nFinally he was forced to give the agricultural life up\n\nand look for a new career in his mid-40s. He says: \"Although Im good with words Im no good with numbers. If youre no good at numbers you are no good at business and if youre no good at business you are no good at farming.\"\n\nSo is Babe a Gloucestershire pig? \"No,\" explains Dick, \"Because he would have had to be a Gloucester Old Spot and hes not, hes a Large White \"\n\nPigs have always been Dicks favourite animals. When\n\nhe was farming his favourite of all time was a\n\nlarger-than-life boar called Monty who loved having\n\nhis head scratched.\n\n\"He was one of many characters but he is the one I mourn most. He had 10 wives and a pretty happy life.\"\n\nThe idea of Babe himself was born one summer day when Dick was in charge of the village fetes Guess-The-Weight-Of-The-Pig stall.\n\nHe started musing about what fate might have in store for the little pink porker if he didnt grow up, like most pigs, to end up on someones dinner plate.\n\nBut Dick admits his and wife Myrles affection for their\n\nanimals may have been the nail in the coffin of their farm life.\n\n\"We treated them like the pets we had as children and the whole farm was like the model farms we played with as kids.\n\n\"Everybody had names and while to some extent it mattered whether a cow gave 1,000 gallons or 500 it mattered more whether she had pretty eyes or a nice colour or a nice nature.\"\n\nWith a wife and three children to support after\n\nleaving the farm, Dick tried several jobs - including\n\na short spell as a travelling salesman and a slightly\n\nlonger one in a shoe factory - before deciding to\n\nre-train as a primary school teacher.\n\nThe job also allowed him time to write, and realising\n\nhow much his young pupils enjoyed animal stories Dick found himself dipping back into his farming\n\nexperiences for inspiration.\n\nDicks first book, published in 1976, was The Fox\n\nBusters, the tale of chickens who take their revenge\n\non their traditional enemy.\n\n\"When I was farming a fox killed lots of my chickens. Foxes are foxes and thats what they do but I did think one day I might have bash at a story where the weak are triumphant over the strong and the chickens beat up the foxes.\"\n\nNow 80, Dick is still writing and his stories come to life in a tiny study with walls crammed with framed illustrations from his books and a window with more little piggies on the sill overlooking open fields.\n\nHe writes in longhand for a couple of hours in the morning then copies it out one-fingered on a battered portable typewriter.\n\nDick relaxes in the armchair he bought when he sold his first book\n\nDicks affection for youngsters is obvious - which is just as well, really since he has 13 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren of his own.\n\nThen there are the millions of young fans to whom hes become a kind of honorary grandpa.\n\n\"I love children\" he says. \"They were the nice thing about teaching. I wasnt mad keen on some of the adults but the children were great. I like their lack of self-consciousness and their curiosity.\n\n\"The single nicest thing I think about my success is\n\nnot the critical acclaim or the money - its the tens of thousands of letters I get from children all over the world.\n\n\"Writing my books is like handing out presents. Giving\n\nchildren pleasure gives you a wonderful sort of Father\n\nChristmassy feeling.\"\n\nAt an age when many are happy to put their feet up\n\nDick still regularly travels all over the country to\n\nmeet his young fans at schools and book festivals,\n\nincluding the Cheltenham Festival of Literature where\n\nhe last appeared two years ago.\n\nAnd Dick hopes he has a \"a few more books in me yet\". That hope will be shared by his millions of fans around the world.\n\nDick King-Smiths autobiography, Chewing The Cud, is published in paperback by Penguin, price £5.99."
