        "text": "Histrionic personality disorder is one of a group of conditions called \"cluster B\" or \"dramatic\" personality disorders. People with these disorders have intense, unstable emotions and distorted self-images. For people with histrionic personality disorder, or HPD, their self-esteem depends on the approval of others and does not arise from a true feeling of self-worth. They have an overwhelming desire to be noticed, and often behave dramatically or inappropriately to get attention. The word histrionic means \"dramatic or theatrical.\"\n\nThis disorder is more common in women and people assigned female at birth, but researchers think that might reflect bias in how the condition is diagnosed.Â It's usually is evident by adolescence or early adulthood.Â\n\nHistrionic vs. borderline personality disorder\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is another \"cluster B\" condition. Like people with histrionic personality disorder, people with BPD have strong emotions that change rapidly. If you have BPD, you're very worried about people abandoning you.Â\n\nA major difference between these two personality disorders is that people with BPD feel more despair and show more suicidal behaviors.Â\n\nHistrionic vs. narcissistic personality disorder\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is also a \"cluster B\" condition. If you have NPD, you feel superior to other people and think you're entitled to praise and special treatment. A major difference between the histrionic and narcissistic disorders is that someone with NPD is very focused on how special they are, something experts call \"grandiosity.\"Â\n\nSymptoms of Histrionic Personality Disorder\n\nIn many cases, people with histrionic personality disorder have good social skills; but they tend to use these skills to manipulate others so that they can be the center of attention.\n\nIf you have this condition, you might:\n\nBe uncomfortable unless you're the center of attention\n\nAct seductively or dress provocatively â or both\n\nShift emotions rapidly\n\nAct very dramatically, as though performing before an audience, with exaggerated emotions and expressions, yet appear to lack sincerity\n\nBe overly concerned with physical appearance\n\nConstantly seek reassurance or approval\n\nBe gullible and easily influenced by others\n\nBe excessively sensitive to criticism or disapproval\n\nHave a low tolerance for frustration and be easily bored by routine, often beginning projects without finishing them or skipping from one event to another\n\nNot think before acting\n\nMake rash decisions\n\nBe self-centered and rarely show concern for others\n\nHave a hard time maintaining relationships, often seeming fake or shallow in dealings with others\n\nThreaten or attempt suicide to get attention\n\nÂ\n\nCauses of Histrionic Personality Disorder\n\nThe exact cause of histrionic personality disorder is not known, but many mental health professionals believe that both learned and inherited things play a role.Â\n\nFor example, the tendency for histrionic personality disorder to run in families suggests that a genetic cause might exist. But the child of a parent with this disorder might simply be repeating behavior they learned at home.Â\n\nOther things that experts think might play a role:Â\n\nNot being criticized or punished as a child\n\nGetting positive feedback from parents only when you show certain behaviors that they approve ofÂ\n\nInconsistent, unpredictable attention from parentsÂ\n\nConfusion about what behaviors will get approval from parentsÂ\n\nYour temperament, psychological style, and the way you learn to cope with stress while growing up all can play a role in the development of a personality disorder.Â\n\nÂ\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder Diagnosis\n\nYour personality continues to change and develop as you grow up, so it's unusual for a doctor to diagnose histrionic personality disorder before you're 18 years old.Â\n\nPersonality disorders are tough to recognize, and if you have one, you may not think there's anything wrong with you. Often, someone with histrionic personality disorder seeks help because their condition has caused problems in their life, such as relationship issues, leading to depression or anxiety.\n\nIf you show signs of HPD, your doctor may do a complete medical and psychiatric history. The doctor might do a physical exam and laboratory tests (such as neuroimaging studies or blood tests) to make sure a physical illness is not causing your symptoms.Â\n\nIf the doctor finds no physical ailment, they might refer the person to a psychiatrist,Â psychologist, or other licensed behavioral health professionalÂ who may use specially designedÂ interview and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a personality disorder.\n\nA mental health professional will ask questions about your:Â\n\nWork history\n\nRelationships\n\nImpulse controlÂ\n\nIf you have HPD, you might not be aware of your behaviors, so family members or others close to you could be asked for their input.\n\nYou may find quizzes and self-assessments online, but there's no exact histrionic personality disorder test. Only a mental health professional can make a diagnosis.\n\nThe American Psychiatric Associationâs Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders spells out the criteria for an HPD diagnosis. The most recent version of this handbook, published in 2013, Â is called DSM-5.\n\nIf you have HPD, you'll show five or more of these behaviors on a regular basis:Â\n\nYou're uncomfortable unless you're the center of attentionÂ\n\nYou behave seductively or provocativelyÂ\n\nYour emotions are shallow and shift easilyÂ\n\nYou use your appearance to draw attentionÂ\n\nYour speech is vagueÂ\n\nYou think your relationships are closer than they really are\n\nYou're easily influenced by othersÂ\n\nYour emotions are dramatic or exaggerated\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder Treatment\n\nIf you have histrionic personality disorder, you might not think you need therapy. Your dislike of routine might make following a treatment plan difficult.Â\n\nPsychotherapy (a type of counseling) is generally the treatment of choice for histrionic personality disorder. The goal of treatment is to help you uncover the motivations and fears linked to your thoughts and behavior, and to help you learn to relate to others in a more positive way.\n\nTypes of therapy that might help include:Â\n\nGroup therapy, which involves meeting with people who have the same diagnosis, supervised by a mental health professional. If you have HPD, it can give you a window into what your own behavior looks like to other people.Â\n\nPsychodynamic psychotherapy tries to get at the root of your emotions and behaviors.\n\nSupportive psychotherapy focuses on improving your symptoms and developing coping skills.Â\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy is a goal-oriented approach that helps you unlearn negative patterns and substitute healthier ones.Â\n\nYou might take medication to treat other conditions, such as depression and anxiety.\n\nComplications of Histrionic Personality Disorder\n\nHistrionic personality disorder can affect your social, professional, or romantic relationships and how you react to losses or failures. You're also at higher risk than the general population for depression and substance abuse.Â\n\nExtreme attention-seeking can include threats of suicide.Â\n\nIf you have HPD, you're more likely to have certain other psychological conditions. They include:Â\n\nSomatic symptom disorder. When you have this, you get very focused on a physical symptom you have and overly upset about it. You may not realize that the symptom itself is not serious, and you might have unnecessary medical tests and procedures trying to treat it.Â\n\nPanic attacks are brief, strong feelings of fear and a physical reaction to an ordinary situation that isn't threatening.Â\n\nConversion disorders are also called functional neurological symptom disorder. When you have this, your mental health condition causes physical symptoms such as seizures, paralysis, loss of sight, or loss of hearing. The symptoms are real, but they are caused by your mental health disorder disrupting your brain and central nervous system.Â\n\nWhat Is the Outlook for People With Histrionic Personality Disorder?\n\nMany people with this disorder are able to function well socially and at work. But if your case is severe, you might have significant problems in your daily life without treatment.\n\nCan Histrionic Personality Disorder Be Prevented?\n\nHPD can't be prevented. But treatment can help you manage your condition and learn healthier ways to deal with your emotions and relationships.Â\n\nÂ\n\nTakeawaysÂ\n\nHistrionic personality disorder, or HPD, is a \"cluster B\" personality disorder. When you have it, you have an overwhelming need for attention, and you try to get it through dramatic or inappropriate behavior. Researchers aren't exactly sure what causes it, but they think it may result both from genetic factors and patterns in your childhood. There's no specific drug for HPD, but several types of therapy are available. You might take medication to treat anxiety or depression, which can also affect people with HPD. In fact, depression or anxiety may be the trigger for your seeking help. People with this condition often don't believe their behaviors are a problem.Â\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder FAQs\n\nIs histrionic personality disorder a form of narcissism?Â\n\nHPD and narcissistic personality disorder are closely related, but they aren't the same. Both are \"cluster B\" personality disorders, which involve dramatic and impulsive behaviors. If you have narcissistic personality disorder, you have a sense that you're superior to other people and deserve special treatment.Â\n\nHow common is histrionic personality disorder?\n\nExperts believe about 1% of people have HPD.\n\nWhat happens if you ignore someone with histrionic personality disorder?\n\nIt's important to keep your emotions level when dealing with someone who has HPD. Don't match the intensity of their emotions. But if you ignore them, they might escalate their behavior to get your attention.Â"
