college, that's where I actually found boxing.\n\n(crowd cheering, applause) I dedicated everything to boxing.\n\n(crowd cheering) I won the Olympic trials for the 2021 Olympics.\n\n♪ ♪ And now I'm in the top three in the world, so getting the gold is definitely doable.\n\nWOMAN: What are you doing, Ginny?\n\nFUCHS: I just felt like my feet got very, very contaminated and it made my anxiety go to a ten.\n\nIt makes, it makes the world feel like everything's falling down.\n\nI feel like I'm gonna throw up, my heart's racing, I can't...\n\nI'm foggy, I can't think straight.\n\n(grunting) Boxing is the only thing that takes me away from my obsessive thoughts and my OCD world.\n\nLike, I know I'm a strong-willed person.\n\nAnd I have good self-control when it comes to boxing.\n\nBut when it comes to my OCD, it's, like, no self-control.\n\nI use, like, eight to 12 toothbrushes in one session.\n\nBecause I might brush it for ten seconds, be, like, \"Oh, the brush feels contaminated.\"\n\nI don't know why I get this thought.\n\nIt feels contaminated, throw it away, grab a new one.\n\n(repeatedly punching speed bag) I'm, like, \"Wow, Ginny.\n\n\"You can spar eight rounds, \"go hit the bag six rounds, and go do a 30-minute run.\"\n\nThat's easy to me.\n\nBut I can't clean a countertop and wash my hands in ten minutes.\n\nThere's no way I would be able to do that in ten minutes.\n\nThat would take me, like, two hours.\n\n♪ ♪ There's always a constant battle in my head.\n\nLike, \"Ginny, let's stop,\" but I can't stop.\n\nEven though I want to so bad.\n\n♪ ♪ Blows my mind, almost.\n\n(grunting) I don't understand why I can't.\n\nAnd that's what I'm still trying to figure out.\n\n(sniffs) ♪ ♪ JEREMIAH ROBINSON: Well, I was diagnosed with bipolar, PTSD, schizophrenia, and depression.\n\n♪ ♪ MATTHEW ROSENBERG: I've been diagnosed with co-morbid depression, but it is secondary to the OCD.\n\nLAURA DUNN: Generalized anxiety.\n\nI'm pretty confident that that is my formal diagnosis.\n\nNARRATOR: Half of all Americans are diagnosed with a mental illness during their lifetime.\n\nI don't want to be viewed as someone who has a psychological problem.\n\nMIA YAMAMOTO: I felt completely alone.\n\nEvery single person that you communicate with tells you you're crazy.\n\nHere I am saying, \"You know, my family would probably be better off without me.\"\n\nNARRATOR: For many, the diagnosis of a mental illness is made worse by the stigma that accompanies it.\n\nWe have a natural inclination as human beings to be afraid of the things that we don't understand.\n\nRYAN MAINS: I didn't think mental illness was something that happened to normal people.\n\nNARRATOR: And in the era of the COVID pandemic, even more Americans grapple with mental illness.\n\nRACHEL YEHUDA: One out of every five people that were treated for COVID have developed a mental health illness.\n\nWe know that there are a lot of people that have been traumatized.\n\nSIDNEY HANKERSON: Coronavirus has highlighted health inequities in general, and the rates of depression and anxiety are through the roof.\n\nNARRATOR: Now, more than ever, the cracks in America's mental health care system are exposed.\n\nJEFFREY LIEBERMAN: At this point in time in the 21st century, we know more than we ever have in history, but at the same time, far less is being done than could be done.\n\nBecause treatment of people with mental illness has always been sort of separate and unequal.\n\nThere's so much stigma and fear as it relates to mental illness.\n\nPeople might do whatever they can to say it's anything but that.\n\nNARRATOR: Why?\n\nWhy does mental illness carry such stigma?\n\nKEITH WAILOO: Lowering levels of stigma has proven to be very difficult.\n\nYou see this intermingling of social judgment and medical judgment always in the history of psychiatry.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: The past holds clues to why the puzzle of mental illness is so hard to solve.\n\n♪ ♪ Since the beginning of recorded history, people searched the body, the soul, and the brain for clues into mysterious behaviors, asking, \"Are they evil or illness?\"\n\nIn fifth century BCE Greece, Hippocrates, known as the father of Western medicine, wrote these words.\n\nANDREW SCULL: \"It is the brain which is the seat of madness \"and delirium of the fears and frights \"which assail us.\n\n\"Insomnia and sleepwalking of thoughts that will not come, \"forgotten duties and eccentricities-- \"all such things result from an unhealthy condition of the brain.\"\n\nNARRATOR: This was a radical notion at a time when most saw madness as a curse from the gods.\n\nSCULL: This idea that so much of what is essentially human about us runs through this thing that sits inside our head is a remarkable insight.\n\nNARRATOR: Hippocrates believed the health of the brain depended on the health of the whole body.\n\nHis ideas were inspired by the culture of his time.\n\nFor the Greeks, the four elements-- air, earth, water, and fire-- were essential to their understanding of the world.\n\nAnd Hippocrates claimed they corresponded to four fluids in the body called humors.\n\nANNE HARRINGTON: Humoral theory saw a variant of each of the four elements operating in the human body.\n\n♪ ♪ They were either dry or they were wet.\n\nAnd they were either hot or they were cold.\n\nThe way to stay healthy is to have everything in balance, not too hot, not too cold-- sort of the Goldilocks kind of principle of good health.\n\nNARRATOR: This theory would shape the treatment of the mentally ill for more than 2,000 years.\n\nAHMED RAGAB: Most physicians believed these humors affected the brain and therefore affected how people actually behaved.\n\nFor example, like, a person with more black bile in their body would be more depressed.\n\nSo it can lead to insomnia, forms of hallucinations.\n\nIt can lead to a number of other issues that we would identify as mental illness.\n\nNARRATOR: Doctors believed blood carried the humors throughout the body.\n\nSo they treated these imbalances by bleeding patients with leeches or knives.\n\nBut who was considered mentally ill was shaped by the culture of the time.\n\nCOOMBS: Historically, medicine in general and also psychiatry have looked at themselves as immune to the impact of society and culture, as if, that it would be unbiased, right?\n\nAnd totally just trying to be scientific.\n\nBut you see from the very beginning ways that people try to make sense of what they're seeing that are completely shaped and informed by the ways in which the world is biased.\n\nNARRATOR: One enduring bias embodied by an ancient Greek diagnosis targeted women who behaved too emotionally.\n\nSCULL: Hysteria is a diagnosis that doesn't exist anymore.\n\nIt derives from the Greek word for a womb.\n\nThere was a sense that the womb wasn't fixed in place, it could move about, and part of the mischief it created was upset in the body and in the brain and in the behavior of women.\n\nNARRATOR: Even late into the 20th century, when the female anatomy was better understood, doctors continued to diagnose women with hysteria.\n\nRAGAB: The term hysteria has expanded and shrank depending on society and depending on where women are.\n\nIn many cases, women simply voicing their opinion, participating in society, or offending a prominent male in their household would be branded as mentally ill. ♪ ♪ NARRATOR: The beliefs of the day often shape the understanding of mental illness.\n\nWAILOO: In societies where authority was organized around religion, it was common sense that mental illness was either divinely inspired or the product of devilish intent.\n\nNARRATOR: In the fourth century, the rapid rise of Christianity forged an enduring framework that would shape how society sees the mentally ill to this day.\n\nEarly proselytizers quoted the Old Testament, warning non-believers, \"The Lord shall smite thee with madness.\"\n\nALLEN FRANCES: One of the problems for the mentally ill that came with Christianity was that mental illness was related to the morality and the worthwhileness and the sinfulness of the person who was suffering.\n\nSo if life was a battle between God and the devil, the mentally ill were seen as pawns of the devil.\n\nNARRATOR: When it came to treatment, humoral techniques competed with religious ritual.\n\nGEORGE MAKARI: You would vet these people, triage them, like in an E.R., and try to figure out whether, let's say, a delusion was due to a supernatural spirit that had invaded their soul or a disruption of their body.\n\nIt was a critical fork in the road, because if it was a disruption of their body, you were going to send them to the humoral doctors, who would bleed, who would do their thing.\n\nIf it was a possession of the soul, you needed to really be careful with this person, 'cause the power of a witch and of being possessed, they can possess others.\n\nFRANCES: And so they were shunned, and even worse, they were often punished.\n\nSometimes with the best of intentions-- exorcisms, but exorcisms that might result in death.\n\n♪ ♪ SUSANNAH CAHALAN: Anyone that doesn't fit into the kind of archetype of what a woman is supposed to be is obviously ill or sick/a witch.\n\nThat is a direct reflection of the culture that it came from.\n\nSo psychiatry is a science that grapples constantly with cultural norms, because it's really deciding what's outside the kind of spectrum of normal behavior and what is inside it.\n\nThe question of what these behavioral problems mean has persisted, right?\n\nThe, \"Why this person?\"\n\n\"Why me?\"\n\n\"There must be some meaning associated with this affliction.\"\n\nSo even though our religious and social and scientific authority has shifted over time, there is still this notion, this quest for meaning.\n\n♪ ♪ (indistinct chatter) CECILIA McGOUGH: If I lived in a different time, I could have very easily have been labeled possessed.\n\nIt could have cost my life.\n\nWhen I was very young, maybe five, I remember seeing shadowy figures.\n\nI got very confused and scared about what it was.\n\n♪ ♪ I grew up in a very religious community, so I was embarrassed about these hallucinations, because I started thinking that maybe this is a punishment, maybe I did something wrong.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: Cecilia McGough turned away from religion and towards science for answers to the unknown.\n\nMcGOUGH: I loved school.\n\nIt was an escape for me.\n\nAnd I became quite the nerd.\n\nNARRATOR: When she was 17, Cecilia fell in love with astrophysics and helped discover a type of collapsed star called a pulsar.\n\n♪ ♪ McGOUGH: That was an amazing opportunity, but this was the same time that my hallucinations were becoming much more prevalent.\n\n(static hissing) I started hearing staticky whispers and struggling with scattered thoughts.\n\nUp to, like, the moment, I was, like, \"Cecilia, \"it just might come up on the screen as, like, you know, \"like, nothing's there, you know, or, oh, there's a lot of \"RFI there, you know, it must have been some wacky radio signal,\" you know?\n\nThese symptoms progressed.\n\nAnd then, I watched the older adaptation of Stephen King's \"IT.\"\n\nIt really resonated with me, because the kids were seeing something that the adults weren't.\n\nAnd I started seeing, like, these shadowy figures very similar to the clown.\n\nI think, like, something with my consciousness sort of, like, latched on to that figure, and it's still a hallucination that I struggle with 24/7, even to this day.\n\n♪ ♪ I kept these hallucinations very much a secret.\n\n♪ ♪ I was hoping that maybe if I moved away, things will change.\n\nBut it was quite the opposite.\n\n♪ ♪ In college, I tried to go to different mental health clubs, but no one was really talking about hallucinations.\n\nSo it in a way even stigmatized it more, because I felt like if I can't even open up about this in a mental health space, then, like, is there something that wrong with me?\n\n♪ ♪ It was just a very dark time in my life.\n\nI wasn't just losing my future, but I was also losing my mind, and I didn't know if I wanted to live like that.\n\n♪ ♪ I thought it would be better to just sort of end things.\n\n♪ ♪ And I tried to take my own life.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: A combination of the Greek words \"split\" and \"mind,\" schizophrenia is used today to describe Cecilia's hallucinations and scattered thoughts.\n\nWhile this diagnosis only dates to the early 20th century, individuals have experienced Cecilia's constellation of symptoms across time and culture.\n\nThis is the case for other mysterious disorders, as well.\n\n♪ ♪ In the 16th century, St. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order, blamed himself for his obsessive behaviors he called \"scruples\" or \"doubts\" about his faith in God.\n\nToday, psychiatrists still use the word \"scrupulous\" to describe certain types of obsessive behaviors.\n\nAnd for many, the legacy of self-blame persists.\n\nFUCHS: I was diagnosed with OCD when I was in sixth grade.\n\nMy family, they support me all the way.\n\nBut I hid my OCD, 'cause I was scared of getting judged.\n\nI didn't accept it, and I was, like, \"That's not who I am.\n\nI don't want people to know, that that's who I am.\"\n\nI came out to the public in 2015 at the Olympic trials, because I knew that I was going to be around, like, my team members 24/7 and rooming with them.\n\nSo, I knew I wasn't going to be able to hide it from them.\n\n♪ ♪ (groans) Okay, you know what?\n\nThat's not going to work.\n\nI forgot I was out of plastic bags, but I got an idea.\n\nSee, you wanna...\n\nWhen I'm out of something and I need to do something, I can figure out a way to get around it.\n\n(sniffs) This thing in the middle, the top of it is contaminated to me, because it doesn't really get washed, so I always have to cover that, 'cause it'd be impossible to take that out without my clothes touching it.\n\nNARRATOR: Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by anxiety, repetitive unwanted thoughts, and compulsive behaviors.\n\nANGELA SMITH: What we look at to determine if something meets the threshold of OCD is the frequency and intensity and level of distress that it causes.\n\n(Fuchs sighs) So this happens with this, um, washing machine.\n\nMy arm touched the side, so now I gotta go wash it off.\n\nSMITH: With Ginny, her symptoms right now are at a severe level, in that the compulsions take up several hours a day.\n\nFUCHS: I'm so focused on getting that clean feeling of what it is at the moment, I'm not realizing the mess I'm creating around me.\n\nThe tip of this just actually touched that, which is contaminated to me, so...\n\nI can't use, like, the squirter thing.\n\nI just have to take this off.\n\nI could spend almost $500 a week on just supplies.\n\nAnd I go through soap a lot.\n\nWhen I moved to the Olympic Training Center, so these past four years, I've relapsed really bad.\n\nIt has hit me very hard, to the point to where I feel no control over it.\n\nCoronavirus has not helped.\n\nIt's kind of made it

And this, he says, is a kind of illness that only the mind can have, mental illness-- has nothing to do with a soul.\n\nWe need to treat it.\n\nYou gotta attack these incorrect ideas.\n\nYou've got to refute them.\n\nAnd Francis Willis has the gall to do this to the king.\n\nNARRATOR: Willis took Locke's ideas and attempted to manipulate the mind of King George with physical force.\n\nBut a letter from the queen's attendant reveals this new therapy was not so different from the spiritual exorcisms of the past.\n\nSCULL: \"The unhappy patient was no longer treated \"as a human being.\n\n\"He was sometimes chained to a stake.\n\n\"He was frequently beaten and starved, and at best, was kept in subjection by menacing and violent language.\"\n\nYou know, as we've seen, exorcism involved, through

what have you, when there could be more of a underlining medical issue?\n\nYou just never know.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: Lorina's case sheds light on how biology and mental illness are intertwined.\n\nWas she suffering from a physical or mental disorder?\n\nIs there even a difference?\n\nThis question has long puzzled science.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a biological breakthrough raised hopes researchers were close to finding the root of all mental illness.\n\nAdvances in dissection revealed the brain contained cells called neurons.\n\nAnd scientists discovered different regions controlled different behaviors, like speech, movement, and sight.\n\nWould they find the source of madness next?\n\nThis was the era of the asylum.\n\nHundreds were built to treat and house the insane.\n\nWhen patients died, their bodies were often sold to researchers.\n\nThey probed these corpses and zeroed in on a mental illness afflicting about one in four asylum patients: general paralysis of the insane.\n\nSCULL: This came with both neurological symptoms and psychiatric symptoms, which were often quite subtle at first: difficulty articulating words, shuffling gait.\n\nYou at the same time developed these extraordinary psychiatric symptoms.\n\nYou often believed you were Jesus or Napoleon or Mary, Mother of God.\n\nAnd as this progressed, you became increasingly paralyzed and eventually you usually choked to death.\n\nSome psychiatrists thought that general paralysis of the insane was the end state of all forms of madness.\n\nNARRATOR: But then doctors noticed a surprising connection.\n\nDissections revealed that in many patients previously treated for syphilis, a common sexually transmitted disease, the infection had migrated to their brains.\n\nSCULL: It creates a sense that biology may be a way forward.\n\nIf a quarter of all madmen were really the result of infectious illness, what about the rest of them?\n\nNARRATOR: Soon, advances in imaging techniques unlocked the details of single neurons, and for the first time, scientists found physical evidence of diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\n\nCAHALAN: But this idea that we were going to make this major breakthrough in understanding all of madness through biology, through pathology, um, that didn't come to fruition.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: Today, ever more sophisticated tools provide new clues.\n\nGene sequencing may one day reveal the genetic origins of these diseases.\n\nMRIs and PET scans offer insight into how disorders like schizophrenia impact different regions of the brain.\n\nBut there are still many unknowns.\n\nCOOMBS: With schizophrenia, not unlike any other diagnosis, we know that there are multiple factors, but we don't know exactly, you know, which factors are playing out more in which person.\n\nHow much of it is, you know, a biological component, how much of it is social, how much is psychological, how much of it relates to trauma and all different kinds of aspects, is the question.\n\nFRANCES: So many genes are involved.\n\nFor schizophrenia, 150, interacting in permutations that are probably in the billions.\n\nThere's never any specific genetic pattern that explains a particular clinical presentation.\n\nWe know more than we ever have, but there's still a lot that's not known.\n\nAnd so that's a big reason why the stigma persists.\n\n♪ ♪ McGOUGH: I didn't talk about my hallucinations at all.\n\nAfter my first suicide attempt, I didn't feel comfortable.\n\nIt took me eight months after that to finally get treatment.\n\nI've had three near-attempts since then.\n\nNARRATOR: Even after her diagnosis, Cecilia tried to hide her symptoms, but events intervened.\n\n(sirens) McGOUGH: My second psych ward stay, I had to open up afterwards because the police were involved.\n\nThey patted me down in front of my roommates and I had to convince them not to put handcuffs on me.\n\nI wasn't at all refusing to

Monster Schizophrenia Project.\"\n\nI have a real problem of getting trapped, trapped in my bedroom, because my hallucinations are the worst when I wake up.\n\nI'm doing this live stream right now because it's important that I do these live streams, even when I'm, when I'm struggling.\n\nLIEBERMAN: There's extensive data which shows that if you're treated for an acute episode of schizophrenia, particularly early or at the beginning of your course of illness, your response to treatment is very good.\n\nNARRATOR: But if left untreated, studies suggest schizophrenia gets worse over time.\n\nCecilia didn't start therapy or medication until 15 years after her first hallucinations.\n\nMcGOUGH: This is my first video since coming back from my sixth psych ward stay.\n\nNARRATOR: And like many living with schizophrenia, she's tried a variety of drugs and therapeutic approaches.\n\nSometimes I feel like it's a choice for me to take my medicine, go to sleep, be a good patient, or stay up and do work, because my medicine makes me go to sleep.\n\nLIEBERMAN: 80%-plus people will have a very significant response to anti-psychotic drug treatment.\n\nThe thing is, is sustaining that.\n\nI tried different medications.\n\nSome of them would make the hallucinations worse.\n\nCOOMBS: With schizophrenia, we believe that there's a certain biological component, but it's not the full story.\n\nWhen I see those giant spiders, that usually happens during the medicine changes.\n\nCOOMBS: So what that means is that, when we look at treatment, we have to combine different interventions that target different types of challenges.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: More than a century ago, one doctor recognized this complexity and realized biology might not have all the answers.\n\nIn the late 1800s, Sigmund Freud was a frustrated neurologist hoping to discover the biological mechanisms of thought and feeling.\n\nMAKARI: The motor neuron had been found, the sensory neuron had been found.\n\nHe thought for sure there's gonna be a will neuron and a memory neuron and a thought neuron.\n\nAnd he scribbled out this thing called \"The Project for a Scientific Psychology.\"\n\nAnd then he looked at it and he said, \"This is a, this kind of a madness, this is all BS-- I'm making this up.\"\n\nSo Sigmund Freud is at the end of his academic tether when he gets this grant to go to Paris and study with Charcot.\n\nNARRATOR: When Freud met him in 1885, Jean-Martin Charcot was the world's most prominent neurologist.\n\nAt the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, he was trying to unravel one of psychiatry's oldest and most vexing diagnoses.\n\nHARRINGTON: This was a hospital for a lot of indigent, sick women.\n\nA group of those women had been diagnosed with hysteria.\n\nThey suffered from motor problems, paralyses, and most dramatically, fall into states of convulsion, like someone with epilepsy.\n\nMAKARI: Charcot, he thought \"You know, there's something to this illness.\n\n\"I bet you it's a neurologic illness and it has discrete neurologic stages.\"\n\nHe then tried to sort out what those stages were.\n\nNARRATOR: Charcot decided to use a technique popular at the time: hypnosis.\n\nA trance-like state was induced in patients to control their minds and bodies.\n\nHARRINGTON: Hypnosis drew from the exorcism rituals.\n\nExorcists often required the demon to obey commands.\n\n\"Make this person go rigid!\"\n\nAnd the person would go rigid.\n\n\"Okay, now, demon, now that you know that I control you, begone!\"\n\nSo hypnotists kind of do a little bit of that, too.\n\nCharcot uses hypnosis to create on command the various symptoms of hysteria that he believes occur naturally.\n\nHe can call them out on command, and then he can photograph them, or then he can demonstrate them.\n\nMAKARI: Everyone wants to come and see this.\n\nAnd Freud goes there and he's utterly blown away by this stuff.\n\nHe writes to his fiancée, \"My brain is sated as after an evening of theater.\n\nNo other human being has ever affected me in the same way.\"\n\nBut that theater was not all real.\n\nThe patients were figuring out what the doctors wanted them to do.\n\nThese apparently spontaneous pictures took two, three, four, five minutes to produce, and so these figures had to somehow learn to hold these poses.\n\nIt was suggestion, a bath of suggestion, where what the doctors wanted, the patients gave them.\n\nAnd soon it seemed like that was just the truth.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: The medical establishment dismissed Charcot's work as unscientific.\n\nMAKARI: And Freud goes back to Vienna just as Charcot's reputation starts to really plunge.\n\nAnd he comes out of it with a new synthesis.\n\nNARRATOR: The notion that doctors can tap into hidden parts of a patient's mind sparked an insight in Freud.\n\nAt the time, society was starting to embrace the concept that humans and animals alike possess innate instincts.\n\nCharles Darwin had recently introduced the revolutionary idea that evolution shapes not just humans' physical characteristics, but their behavior.\n\nFRANCES: Darwin said that we have inborn tendencies that developed during the evolution of our species, that our behavior is just as much a function of evolution as is our body.\n\nThat was the home run.\n\n♪ ♪ Freud applied this Darwinian thinking to clinical situations by saying we had inborn instincts that were not always available to consciousness.\n\nThe treatment is really basically getting the person to understand what was previously unconscious and to try to change those patterns through that understanding.\n\nMAKARI: He said, \"Whatever the brain has to do with that, \"someday we'll find out.\n\n\"I'm just going to say that's a black box and I'm gonna track these things psychologically.\"\n\nAnd that's psychoanalysis.\n\nNARRATOR: Psychoanalysis relies on dream interpretation and stream-of-consciousness exploration to resolve what Freud calls neurosis, the distressing conflict between the conscious and unconscious mind.\n\nFinally, after centuries wrestling with the question, \"Is mental illness an evil infestation or a biological disorder?\n\n\", Freud argues it's part of the human condition.\n\nBut how society applies his ideas changes as culture changes.\n\nCOOMBS: We know for a fact that when we're walking and living our lives, that there are all kinds of behaviors and actions that we do that are not within our conscious awareness, we just do them.\n\nSo why wouldn't that be the case when it comes to unconscious feelings, motivations?\n\nSo for me, sort of the lessons and teaching of Freud as it relates to some of that is helpful.\n\nOther things, not so much.\n\nMAN (in film): Tommy wouldn't be behaving as he is if he weren't seriously upset by something that we don't understand at the moment and that he's not aware of himself.\n\nNARRATOR: In the mid 20th century, American psychiatrists took Freud's ideas about the importance of early life experience to the extreme.\n\nAfter centuries of searching, they claimed to have finally found the source of mental illness: bad mothers.\n\nWOMAN (in film): You know it's the mother who is responsible for the child's character.\n\nHARRINGTON: This does lead to a kind of project to identify the range of ways that mothers can harm their kids' emotional development.\n\nMAN (in film): She inflicts on both her husband and son the kind of punishment she had.\n\n- Poor child.\n\n- And poor man.\n\nHARRINGTON: It has a kind of quasi-medical sort of spirit to it, because certain kinds of bad mothering lead directly to certain kinds of messed-up kids.\n\nMAN (in film): There's an angry, frustrated woman.\n\nHARRINGTON: There was a mother that was blamed for driving her children into states of schizophrenia, the \"schizophrenogenic\" mother.\n\nThere was a lot of controversy over what was exactly wrong with her.\n\nBut there was clarity that there must be something wrong with her, because her children were so sick.\n\nMAN (in film): He is placed on a couch and urged to let his mind roam freely.\n\nNARRATOR: Through the lens of this conservative era, Freud's ideas were widely adopted, but distorted.\n\nPSYCHIATRIST: Now, tell me about your mother.\n\nNARRATOR: Psychiatrists saw the need for new approaches and built off Freud's use of talk therapy.\n\nFRANCES: Starting in the '50s and '60s, there became the addition of different therapies that focused less on unconscious motivation and more on the current behaviors, thoughts, and feelings, with the idea that you might have a quicker and more efficient way of promoting change.\n\nSMITH: You are going to be doing a cleaning, and we want to try to achieve not clean enough.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Go.\n\nNARRATOR: To manage her OCD symptoms, Ginny relies on one of these different approaches, known as cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT.\n\nSMITH: Not clean enough... NARRATOR: CBT combines talk therapy with a theory pre-dating Freud: John Locke's notion that it's possible to identify problems and manipulate the mind.\n\nCOOMBS: Cognitive behavioral therapy is shown to be really helpful in how people build up and bolster tools for themselves to be able to, you know, ask themselves and challenge some of their automatic thoughts.\n\nNARRATOR: Ginny uses a form of CBT called exposure therapy.\n\nSMITH: Very different than lying on a couch talking about your mother.\n\nThat is just fine, and it's relevant, but the focus of exposure therapy is to be in contact with the thing that you've been avoiding.\n\nIt's a very active kind of treatment.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: Ginny's exposures include using a single toothbrush for two minutes... ...and touching dirty surfaces she'd usually avoid.\n\nSMITH: She's been in treatment now with me somewhat on and off over a year and a half.\n\nAnd she, she is still in need of treatment.\n\n- I just feel weird.\n\n- Mm-hmm.\n\nNARRATOR: Like many, Ginny continues to search for effective treatments.\n\nSMITH: Sometimes it's a matter of, is medication being taken consistently?\n\nSometimes the answer has been no.\n\nBut I always hold on to hope that things can be different and we'll keep on working for that.\n\n- It's a feeling, I don't know how to handle this feeling.\n\nLike, I feel like it's never gonna go away...\n\nWhen I'm having a bad time, I will go and do therapy with my therapist every day.\n\nTherapy for mental health disorders, it's out of network, so my insurance doesn't pay much of it.\n\nSo that adds up.\n\nIf I resist those thoughts sometimes, it's, like, sometimes I get all these other thoughts that overwhelm my brain that I, um... that I can't, like... that I feel stuck, like...\n\nI feel like I would just call my coach and say, like, \"I can't go to the gym.\"\n\n♪ ♪ Well, I think society doesn't help people with mental health as much as, like, physical problems, because a lot of people still don't understand it.\n\nThe United States Olympic Committee, they're willing to help me, because they want to see me succeed and win a gold medal.\n\nSo I'm lucky with that, but most people don't get that.\n\nMost of my therapists that I've had have been when I've been in a psych ward.\n\nI went to a therapist once.\n\nBut unfortunately, and this is the case for a lot of people, I couldn't afford to have a therapist and a psychiatrist and support myself.\n\nIt is frustrating that sometimes you have to make that choice on what, what can you afford for your mental health.\n\nNARRATOR: After centuries, mental illness is still shrouded in stigma and mystery.\n\nLike millions, Cecilia and Ginny live with disorders that are challenging to treat, and managing difficult symptoms dominates daily life.\n\nI sometimes actually take pictures of little spiders with my phone, because I've realized that if I take a picture, I don't hallucinate it on the...
