        "text": "< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nDisorders with Similar Symptoms\n\nSymptoms of the following disorders can be similar to those of Tardive dyskinesia. Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis:\n\nHuntington’s Disease (also known as Huntington’s Chorea) is an inherited neurological illness. Those affected experience involuntary movements, loss of motor control, changes in gait, loss of memory, and in some cases, dementia. In general, the first symptoms of HD appear between thirty and fifty years of age. HD runs a progressive course, severely weakening patients usually over a ten to twenty-year period, whereas there is no degeneration in Tardive Dyskinesia. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Huntington” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n\nCerebral Palsy is a disorder characterized by impaired muscle control or coordination (motor output system) resulting from injury to the brain during its early stages of development (the fetal, perinatal, or early childhood stages). There may be associated problems with sensory input, such as vision or hearing defects, central processing (such as communication), intellectual or perceptual deficits, and/or seizures. People with CP can have slow facial and tongue movements, which may resemble TD. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Cerebral Palsy” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n\nTourette Syndrome is a neurological movement disorder which begins in childhood between the ages of two and sixteen. The disorder is characterized by involuntary muscular movements called “tics”, and uncontrollable vocal sounds. Sometimes inappropriate words may unavoidably be spoken. Tourette Syndrome is not a degenerative disorder and those affected can expect to live a normal life span. Neuroleptic drugs such as haloperidol and pimozide can be prescribed as treatments for TS, so it may sometimes be difficult to determine whether facial and tongue movements in TS patients are caused by the disorder or the drugs. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Tourette” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n\nDystonia is a group of complex movement disorders with various causes, treatments, progression, and symptoms. These neurological conditions are characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, which force certain parts of the body into abnormal, sometimes painful movements and positions. Dystonia is not a single disease, but a set of symptoms that often cannot be attributed to a single cause. Both genetic and non-genetic factors contribute to different forms of dystonia. The major characteristics of all forms of dystonia are twisting, repetitive writhing movements affecting particular parts of the body (for example, the neck, trunk, or arm). Tardive dystonia is a particularly severe form of tardive dyskinesia. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Dystonia” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nClinical Trials and Studies\n\nStudies are ongoing to determine possible new drug therapies for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. Choline, lithium, bromocriptine, baclofen, methyldopa, valproate, clonidine, propranolol, amantadine, clonazepam, and nifedipine have occasionally been helpful but in most cases do not improve dyskinesia. Tetrabenazine is often useful for symptomatic treatment of tardive dyskinesia and is currently available for use in the US. However, it carries the risk of causing or aggravating depression. Other experimental drugs are being tested to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. For more information about these studies, please contact the agencies listed in the Resources section of this report.\n\nInformation on current clinical trials is posted on the Internet at www.clinicaltrials.gov. All studies receiving U.S. Government funding, and some supported by private industry, are posted on this government web site.\n\nFor information about clinical trials being conducted at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, contact the NIH Patient Recruitment Office:\n\nTollfree: (800) 411-1222\n\nTTY: (866) 411-1010\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nSome current clinical trials also are posted on the following page on the NORD website:\n\nhttps://rarediseases.org/living-with-a-rare-disease/find-clinical-trials/\n\nFor information about clinical trials sponsored by private sources, contact:\n\nwww.centerwatch.com\n\nFor information about clinical trials conducted in Europe, contact:\n\nhttps://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >"
