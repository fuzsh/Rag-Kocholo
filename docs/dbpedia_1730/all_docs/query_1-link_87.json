        "text": "Mental Maladies in the Twentieth Century\n\nPetteri Pietikainen in Madness, 2015\n\nKraepelin did not create dementia praecox merely by observing his patients; his ideas were partly preceded by those of his colleagues in France and Germany. Most importantly, his German predecessors Ewald Hecker and Karl Kahlbaum developed the diagnoses of hebephrenia and catatonia, which played a crucial role in Kraepelin’s construction of dementia praecox. First, in 1871, Ewald Hecker (1843–1909) coined the term ‘hebephrenia’, by which he meant disorganized speech and behaviour that typically afflicted adolescents, especially boys and young men. The emotions and affects of hebephrenic patients tended to be flat or strange, and they might manifest themselves as inappropriate facial expressions, bellowing or unmotivated laughter. The outlook and prognosis for patients with hebephrenia was poor: ‘All cases described by me can be regarded without hesitation as “incurable”’ (Hecker 2009, 242). A few years after Hecker’s seminal article on hebephrenia, his superior and friend Karl Kahlbaum (1828–99), director of the private mental asylum in Göritz, coined the term ‘catatonia’. It denoted a state of motor immobility and a level of consciousness wherein a patient was rigid and mute and more or less unresponsive to stimuli. Kahlbaum called this type of catatonia ‘motility psychosis’, because he believed that it affects the motor centres of the brain. Catatonic symptoms were first described in the third century by Galen, who called it catalepsy (Berrios 1996, 378–96). Cata-tonic patients typically ignore external stimuli and hold rigid poses for hours or even days, and they may also be trapped in stereotyped, repetitive movements (the Greek word katatonos means ‘stretching tight’) (Goldar, Starkstein & Hodg-kiss, 1995). The inner world of catatonic persons was, however, not empty and motionless. On the contrary, after waking up from the catatonic stupor, they were often able to remember even the tiniest details and events around them, as if external happenings were ‘registered with photographic exactness’ (Freeman & Watts 1950, 402).\n\nLunar cycle and psychiatric hospital admissions for schizophrenia: new findings from Henan province, China\n\nPublished in Chronobiology International, 2020\n\nRan-Ran Wang, Yu Hao, Hua Guo, Meng-Qi Wang, Ling Han, Ruo-Yun Zheng, Juan He, Zhi-Ren Wang\n\nAs shown in Table 1, this study included 5638 (43.1%) males and 7429 (56.9%) females. The average patient age was 34.69 ± 12.7 years. There were no significant differences in distributions of age, sex, and birth season by lunar phase (p > .05). However, the distribution of patients diagnosed with the positive syndrome (F20.0–F20.3), negative syndrome (F20.4–F20.6), and unspecified schizophrenia (F20.9) significantly differed by lunar phase (χ2 = 14.187, P = .028). Comparison of these three subgroups showed that a higher percentage of patients diagnosed with the positive syndrome were admitted at the full moon compared with patients with the unspecified type (p < .05). We further categorized positive symptoms as indicating paranoid schizophrenia, hebephrenic schizophrenia, and undifferentiated schizophrenia (Table 2). This showed that a higher percentage of patients with paranoid schizophrenia were admitted at the full moon compared with patients with unspecified schizophrenia (χ2 = 23.697, P = .022). There was no difference in the distribution of schizophrenia subtype during the other three lunar phases.\n\nConceptual and historical evolution of psychiatric nosology\n\nPublished in International Review of Psychiatry, 2021\n\nAwais Aftab, Elizabeth Ryznar\n\nEmil Kraepelin’s nosology, building on the work of his predecessors Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum and Ewald Hecker, is widely recognized as a watershed moment in psychiatric nosology. Kahlbaum and Hecker recognized that psychiatric diagnostic terms like ‘melancholia’, ‘mania’, and ‘dementia’ represented heterogenous symptom complexes, in the same way that ‘abdominal pain’ or ‘headache’ were diagnostically non-specific. They believed that reliance on such diagnoses had only furthered diagnostic confusion and had led to the near-complete failure of neuroanatomical and neuropathological research (which dominated 19th century European psychiatry) to shed light on the aetiology of mental illness. They did not think that aetiological research would yield results until it was guided by clinical, proto-disease entities that considered not just symptoms but the whole course of illness (Kendler & Engstrom, 2017). General paresis of the insane (GPI) served as the paradigm for this way of thinking, because even though the cause was still undiscovered at the time, its characteristic symptoms and course had been well-established. Based on their longitudinal observations of patients, especially adolescents and young adults, Kahlbaum and Hecker proposed the categories of hebephrenia, catatonia, and cyclic insanity. Kahlbaum observed that hebephrenia typically led to rapid development of mental deterioration or feeble-mindedness (‘dementia’), while catatonia (which was defined as a motor syndrome with psychosis) and cyclical insanity typically did not despite multiple recurrences (Kendler & Engstrom, 2017).\n\nCo-occurring psychiatric conditions in autism spectrum disorder\n\nPublished in International Review of Psychiatry, 2018\n\nTamara E. Rosen, Carla A. Mazefsky, Roma A. Vasa, Matthew D. Lerner\n\nThere is now considerable evidence for the differentiation of schizophrenia/psychotic disorders and ASD. For example, stereotypical and repetitive behaviour, resistance to environmental change, visual pre-occupations, and problems with non-verbal communication have been shown to differentiate adults with ASD from those with schizophrenia, with the ASD group showing elevations in these symptoms compared to the schizophrenic group (Konstantareas & Hewitt, 2001). Moreover, the same study found that the ASD group with schizophrenia was more likely to be diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia compared to those with schizophrenia, in which the paranoid sub-type was predominant. Additionally, a more recent line of work suggests specific differences in social cognitive deficits in ASD compared to schizophrenia, such as less attention to emotionally ambiguous stimuli (Sasson, Pinkham, Weittenhiller, Faso, & Simpson, 2016). Additionally, paranoia in schizophrenia is characterized by fear of victimization, suspicion, and threat of harm, while, in ASD, it is characterized by social cynicism (Pinkham et al., 2012). Lastly, the social deficits of the two disorders appear to be somewhat distinct; whereas adults with ASD ask fewer questions in conversations compared to adults with schizophrenia, adults with schizophrenia have flatter affect and poorer eye contact (Morrison et al., 2017). However, in this study, adults with ASD overall had poorer social skills."
