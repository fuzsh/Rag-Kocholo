        "text": "Discussion\n\nParenchymal neurosyphilis usually exists decades after syphilis infection.13 GPI is the dominant form of parenchymal neurosyphilis that is easily misdiagnosed because of multiple nonspecific symptoms and signs. It mostly occurred in the middle-aged population, no matter in the pre-antibiotic era14 or in the modern era.7 It was reported that the gender ratio of male to female in all types of neurosyphilis was about 1.53~5.1:14,5 and this ratio was even higher in GPI,6,15,16 which was the same as our results. In contrast, Tong et al discovered that compared with non-neurosyphilis dementia, GPI had a higher percentage of males and younger age.15 We suspected the reason was that syphilis patients increased most among men who had sex with men (MSM)17 and the females might have more opportunities (such as pregnancy and abortion) to screen syphilis-related variables detected than the males, thus, they were less likely to develop symptomatic neurosyphilis due to the early diagnosis and treatment. A previous study summarized the GPI patients from 1924–1954 and discovered the low education level of the total patients (95% completed elementary school only). They assumed the reason was that the patients at higher social class had the chance to be treated in private institutes or even at home.14 But in this study 87.4% of patients had a higher education level than elementary school. To our surprise, two college students were included. The improving education level of society could be the reason. The patients with high education level and high social class were all in great danger of suffering from GPI. Besides, sex education is still a critically important public health and policy issue, perhaps short films, educational pamphlets and wax models portraying syphilis would work.18 We recommend effective and comprehensive sexuality education in the society.\n\nUnfortunately, delayed diagnosis was found in our study. There were nine GPI cases that had a definite history of syphilis previously. However, four of them were not correctly diagnosed at their first visit to the doctor. And although three cases in the remaining 110 cases were detected positive syphilis when they were admitted in other hospitals, none of them were diagnosed with GPI and given related treatment. Previous studies showed the duration from symptom onset to final confirmed diagnosis was about 10–20 months,19–21 even after four years of misdiagnosis.22 Lack of vigilance for neurosyphilis by the clinicians including the neurologist and psychiatrist prolonged the time from symptom onset to final confirmed diagnosis. We suggest that syphilis curricula should be included in the training program of the clinicians especially neurologist and psychiatrist.\n\nCognitive impairment was the most common symptom of GPI patients. In this study, most of the GPI patients complained of memory decline, which was easily to be noticed due to its significant impact on their daily life. Furthermore, the abnormal rate of MoCA was much higher than MMSE in our study, This could be because that MoCA was more sensitive for screening out mild cognitive impairment patients and with less ceiling effect.23 Further investigation indicated that cognitive domains of delayed recall, visuospatial/executive and language ability were severely damaged. But in the stage of mild GPI, there was an overall cognitive function impairment, just like AD pattern.16 It was known that hippocampus was related to memory and language learning, and left parahippocampal gyrus played an integral role on the visuospatial/executive function.24 Thus, we suspected that the temporal lobe might be the earliest damaged brain region in GPI patients.\n\nThe incidence of neuropsychiatric symptoms of all types of neurosyphilis varied from 17% to 51%.25 But about 79–82.6% of total GPI patients had psychiatric symptoms.3,20 In this study, the frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms reached up to 89.9%. Among the 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms in NPI, irritability was the most common symptom, followed by agitation/aggression and aberrant motor behavior. A previous study showed that the incidence of neuropsychiatric symptoms from high to low were agitation/aggression (52.7%), irritability (47.3%), apathy (41.8%) and abnormal sleeping (38.5%).26 A report on the misdiagnosed GPI cases discovered that agitation was the most common mood disturbance,20 Roberts and Emsley considered agitation as an indicator for the diagnosis of GPI.27 The difference of the studies might have GPI patients with different disease severity enrolled. Dopamine pathway28 and glutamate signaling29 were hypothesized as the main neurotransmitter basis of neuropsychiatric symptoms.25 It was confirmed that the frontal lesions had significant associations with the overall degree of psychiatric morbidity.30 All the above results suggested that GPI should be considered when patients presented new psychiatric symptom. The basic treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms was penicillin G, together with other drugs for dealing with the psychiatric manifestations, such as olanzapine and quetiapine.25\n\nExcept for cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms, there were some other neurological symptoms and signs. The sign that was easily overlooked was Argyll Robertson’s pupil with the frequency of 23.5% in GPI patients. It was the typical sign of neurosyphilis, and usually together with tabes dorsalis.31 Pupil shape and size change and optic atrophy were common but not specific to GPI. Neurosyphilis might manifest with movement disorders, such as ataxia, parkinsonism, myoclonus, chorea and dystonia,32 sometimes presented the symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy.33 Here, it was found that GPI patients had dyskinesia, including gait instability, hypermyotonia, and bradykinesia, which might be due to the damage in the basal ganglia and midbrain. Particularly, the candy sign was a type of dyskinesia described as sucking with lips, jaws and lower facial muscles. It was first reported as a typical sign of neurosyphilis.34 In this retrospective study, we might overlook the candy sign in the early years, thus, its actual frequency might be higher than 22.7%. The incidence of hyperreflexia was only 10.9%, which was different from the result from other investigations.32 Thus, hyperreflexia might not be a specific sign of GPI. In conclusion, GPI patients can manifest with an array of symptoms and signs, which might be due to the extensive damage caused by syphilis in the brain and spinal cord. In clinical practice, when the clinicians encountered the patients complaining of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms, we should examine the patient carefully, especially pay attention to the specific signs such as the candy sign and Argyll Robertson pupil; this can help us make a direct test for syphilis.\n\nAccording to the reports, the misdiagnosis rate of GPI is very high at 38.2–100%,7,21,35 which was similar to our result that the frequency of misdiagnosis of GPI was 83.2%. It was considered that dementia and schizophrenia were the most frequently misdiagnosed diseases.7 In this study, however, the two diseases misdiagnosed with equal frequency were schizophrenia and mood disorders of anxiety and depression, which were followed by cerebral infarction, vascular dementia, etc. Given the high misdiagnosis rate of GPI, we also recommend every patient with neurological or psychiatric symptoms should have routine blood screening tests for syphilis. If the blood TPPA is positive, the lumbar puncture should be performed when it is necessary.\n\nAccording to the inclusion criteria, all the treponemal tests, including TPPA and FTA-ABS were all positive in both serum and CSF. Serum RPR titer ≥1:32 can help predict the likelihood of neurosyphilis in HIV negative subjects.36 However, about 39% of total GPI patients were with serum RPR ≤1:16 in this study. Hence, patients with a low serum RPR titer might not rule out neurosyphilis. CSF RPR titer in most of GPI patients was distributed between 1:1 and 1:8. It was reported that a fourfold decline of RPR titer in CSF but not in serum RPR was a good predictor for therapeutic efficacy in GPI patients with a positive RPR in CSF.37 However, when RPR in CSF was lower or even negative, the past medical history, symptoms and sign, and CSF routine test were very important in the diagnosis and follow-up of GPI.\n\nCSF pleocytosis and elevated protein can be negative in GPI patients, although WBC number in CSF was increased in most cases in our study. But it was reported that CSF pleocytosis was a sensitive marker for neurosyphilis except tabes dorsalis.38 Similarly to tabes dorsalis, GPI was also the late stage of neurosyphilis, thus, the inflammatory response was milder than that in the early stage of the disease. In addition, we found that the protein level in CSF was normal in 22.8% of total GPI patients, which was similar to other studies within 25–38.8% normal protein level.7,39 Elevated CSF protein was usually caused by the damage of blood–CSF barrier and increased protein synthesis in brain. Many diseases that obstructed the CSF pathway might elevate protein level, so the specificity of elevated protein level in CSF in late neurosyphilis was below 50%.13 There were 20.2% GPI patients with normal result of WBC and protein in CSF. Thus, the changes of WBC number and protein level were not specific for the neurosyphilis diagnosis. Accordingly, neurosyphilis, especially the late neurosyphilis, could not be excluded when the CSF routine test was normal."
