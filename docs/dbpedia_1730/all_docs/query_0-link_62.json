        "text": "Consider these guidelines when communicating with or about disabled people.\n\n1. Language guidelines\n\nNot everyone will agree on everything but there is general agreement on some basic guidelines.\n\n1.1 Collective terms and labels\n\nThe word ‘disabled’ is a description not a group of people. Use ‘disabled people’ not ‘the disabled’ as the collective term.\n\nHowever, many deaf people whose first language is BSL consider themselves part of ‘the deaf community’ – they may describe themselves as ‘Deaf’, with a capital D, to emphasise their deaf identity.\n\nAvoid medical labels. They say little about people as individuals and tend to reinforce stereotypes of disabled people as ‘patients’ or unwell.\n\nDon’t automatically refer to ‘disabled people’ in all communications – many people who need disability benefits and services don’t identify with this term. Consider using ‘people with health conditions or impairments’ if it seems more appropriate.\n\n1.2 Positive not negative\n\nAvoid phrases like ‘suffers from’ which suggest discomfort, constant pain and a sense of hopelessness.\n\nWheelchair users may not view themselves as ‘confined to’ a wheelchair – try thinking of it as a mobility aid instead.\n\n1.3 Everyday phrases\n\nMost disabled people are comfortable with the words used to describe daily living. People who use wheelchairs ‘go for walks’ and people with visual impairments may be very pleased – or not – ‘to see you’. An impairment may just mean that some things are done in a different way.\n\nCommon phrases that may associate impairments with negative things should be avoided, for example ‘deaf to our pleas’ or ‘blind drunk’.\n\n2. Words to use and avoid\n\nAvoid passive, victim words. Use language that respects disabled people as active individuals with control over their own lives.\n\nAvoid Use (the) handicapped, (the) disabled disabled (people) afflicted by, suffers from, victim of has [name of condition or impairment] confined to a wheelchair, wheelchair-bound wheelchair user mentally handicapped, mentally defective, retarded, subnormal with a learning disability (singular) with learning disabilities (plural) cripple, invalid disabled person spastic person with cerebral palsy able-bodied non-disabled mental patient, insane, mad person with a mental health condition deaf and dumb; deaf mute deaf, user of British Sign Language (BSL), person with a hearing impairment the blind people with visual impairments; blind people; blind and partially sighted people an epileptic, diabetic, depressive, and so on person with epilepsy, diabetes, depression or someone who has epilepsy, diabetes, depression dwarf; midget someone with restricted growth or short stature fits, spells, attacks seizures\n\n3. Some tips on behaviour"
