In the case reported here, a penicillin allergic patient with general paresis of the insane was successfully treated with chloramphenicol. This drug has been used in the treatment of syphilis and achieves high concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus chloramphenicol may be a more appropriate agent than tetracycline in treating patients with neurosyphilis who are allergic to penicillin.",
