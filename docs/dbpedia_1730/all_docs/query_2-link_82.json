        "text": "Janelle.pking\n\nThank you for posting your question on History Hub!\n\nInitially, we would recommend that you request a copy of your great grandfather’s Official Military Personnel File (OMPF). OMPFs and individual medical reports for soldiers of the U.S. Army who were separated from the service after October 1912 and before 1960 are in the custody of NARA's National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) in St. Louis. In many cases where personnel records were destroyed in the1973 fire, proof of service can be provided from other records such as morning reports, payrolls, and military orders, and a certificate of military service will be issued. Please complete aGSA Standard Form 180 and mail it to NARA's National Personnel Records Center, (Military Personnel Records), 1 Archives Drive, St. Louis, MO 63138-1002. Veterans and next of kin of deceased veterans also may use eVetRecs to request records. SeeeVetRecs Help for instructions. If there is any information requested by the form that you do not know, you may omit it or provide estimates (such as for dates), but the more information you provide, the easier it will be to locate the correct file if it survived the fire. For more information seeOfficial Military Personnel Files (OMPF), Archival Records Requests.\n\nWe searched the National Archives Catalog and located a series titled Records of Divisions, 1917 - 1920 in the Records of the American Expeditionary Forces (World War I) (Record Group 120) that includes the 126th Infantry Regiment, 32nd Division in boxes 23-24 as well as the 128th Infantry Regiment, 32nd Division in boxes 25-26. For more information about these non-digitized records, please contact the National Archives at College Park - Textual Reference (RR2R) via email at archives2reference@nara.gov. Also within RG 120 is the seriesName Files of Dead and Severely Wounded Casualties of Infantry Divisions in the American Expeditionary Forces, 1918 - 1918 (NM-91 568). Additionally, within the same RG we have the series Records of Machine Gun Battalions, 1917 - 1920. For more information about these non-digitized records, please contact the National Archives at College Park - Textual Reference (RR2R) via email at archives2reference@nara.gov.\n\nThe Textual Reference Archives II Branch (RR2RR) also has custody of series Records of the 1st Through 338th and the 559th Infantry Regiment, 1916-1921 within the Records of U.S. Regular Army Mobile Units (Record Group 391) that includes unit records of infantry regiments during World War I. Finally, Record Group 165 Records of the War Department General and Special Staffs series Records Relating to the History of the War Department, 1918–1941 (NM84 310) that includes unit records. For more information about these non-digitized records, please contact the National Archives at College Park - Textual Reference (RR2R) via email at archives2reference@nara.gov.\n\nWe invite you to continue the conversation with community members on History Hub, but should you have follow up questions for the staff at Archives II, please email us at archives2reference@nara.gov so that we can assist you further.\n\nWe hope this assists you with your research!\n\nSincerely,\n\nTextual Reference Archives II Branch (RR2RR)\n\n[RR2RR 24-25706-VVT]\n\nUntreated syphilis (and I mean untreated as in *no antibiotics*, they had ways to treat the symptoms) could result in an infection of the central nervous system. So it's possible that he could have caught syphilis, been treated, had the symptoms go away, but still had an infection that resulted in neurological damage.\n\nThere was a big fight between the line and the medics in World War I--the medics wanted to treat anyone who was infected, to keep VD from spreading; the line saw it as a discipline problem, so threatened court-martial for anyone who got infected. Eventually the medics won.\n\nThe Army Medical Department published a 16-volume history of the Medical Department in \"The World War\" (they didn't know that there would be a second).\n\nChapter seven of the Communicable Disease volume is on Venereal Diseases, and you can read it here:\n\nhttps://achh.army.mil/history/book-wwi-communicablediseases-chapter7\n\nThey maintain the original page numbering, and Syphilis starts on page 292. Also note that many soldiers had multiple infections when they came in for treatment.\n\nI'll also warn you that the terminology used for different classes of soldiers is archaic in its terminology for races, and the descriptions of available treatments sound both painful and barbaric."
