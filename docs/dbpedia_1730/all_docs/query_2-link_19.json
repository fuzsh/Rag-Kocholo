        "text": "I have just received a lovely little wad of death certs (two of which were sisters who died on the same day in their twenties of Scarlet Fever - was it usually fatal in the 1800s?), and the cause of death on one was just \"Paralysis\"......... nothing else. Does anyone know what this might have been referring to in the late 19th century please\n\nScarlet fever was always very serious until the use of antibiotics. Luckily it is one of the few 'childhood' diseases which is not a virus and can therefore be treated with antibiotics.\n\nIn 1954 when my brother had it the only thing that kept him out of an isolation hospital was that my granny 'barrier nursed' him in our home. He was about 4 at the time. I didn't get it!!\n\nAnne\n\nThank you for that - I didn't realise that Scarlet Fever used to be so dangerous.\n\nThe Paralysis thing is so very vague isn't it, and I did wonder about a stroke because it was something that happened to quite a few members of this branch of the family, including his daughter who had a stroke in her forties and died the following day. I doubt that it would have been syphillis, he was working too hard as a farmer in the middle of nowhere in Yorkshire, but you never know do you!\n\nScarlet fever is a streptococcal infection and left untreated, in severe cases, causes septacaemia which can lead to paralysis just before death.\n\nPeopkle do not normally directly die of paralysis - it is a condition of the body, not a mortal affliction, although in earlier years where nursing of paralytic patients would be rudimentary, they would quickly died anyway, usually from lack of nutrition and fluids.\n\nOC\n\nMy mother had scarlet fever as a child in the 1920's & was very ill on an isolation ward in hospital, she nearly died. Not even her mother was allowed to have contact with her.\n\nOne of the complications of scarlet fever is I believe Rheumatic fever which can leave you with heart problems afterwards.\n\nIn the nineteen forties, my elder sister had what my mother called 'Scarletina'. I know she was very ill, and they cut all her hair off. Was this a milder form of Scalet Fever do you think?\n\nAnn\n\nIn the early 1950s my sister aged 3 had scarlet fever and went into an isolation hospital.\n\nEverything that Mum took to the hospital to be handed to her,comics, jigsaws etc. ...no visiting or contact allowed, ..had to be burnt when she left there.\n\nWhen I had scarletina, my mother made me promise not to make too much of it as she'd packed me off to school for several days, disregarding my complaints that I felt ill\n\nI believe that its impact is far less than it was and it's gradually disappearing from the world.\n\nMy husband remembers having scarlet fever as a child, and he was confined to his bedroom until better, at which point his room was fumigated with something that he said smelt absolutely terrible.\n\nThank you all for your input, and it seems that as far as the one that died simply of Paralysis is concerned I will never know what it referred to - perhaps the doctor was in too much of a hurry to put anything else!\n\nPenelope thank you for that, it's a very interesting thought, and perhaps if the doctor was not aware of the cancer (as is highly likely from what you said) then he would have had little else to go on. I am sorry to hear about your father.\n\nAw thanks, Sally. He's one of the reasons I do family history - it was him set us off this years ago, wanting to find out more about his family.\n\nBut yes, whenever I see 'paralysis' mentioned I wonder if it's something like that as with no pain, etc - the first way it might present to a 19thC person would be as someone becoming paralyzed.\n\nDad is the little boy in my avatar!"
