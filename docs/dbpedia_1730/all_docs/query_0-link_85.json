        "text": "To the Editor:\n\nTwo letters in the March 20 Book Review discussed the question of Oscar Wilde dying of syphilis. Whether or not Wilde had syphilis is something we shall never know. However, he could not have had hereditary syphilis from his father, as the congenital disease comes from an infection in the mother; in the absence of evidence that she had the disease I think this hypothesis can be ruled out. Also, the congenital disease causes early stigmata and doesn't lead to acute attacks in adult life. If he had a typical sore or chancre as a young man it could have been diagnosed fairly accurately by ordinary examination, but one must remember that in those days syphilis, like tuberculosis, was often overdiagnosed and that the diagnostic Wassermann reaction did not exist.\n\nMercury, like lead or bismuth, makes a dark line on the gum margin but does not blacken the teeth. Furthermore the rash Wilde had late in his life is not a symptom of the tertiary disease but occurs in the early secondary stage. In tertiary syphilis the dramatic events are chiefly related to aneurysms of the thoracic aorta, which may obstruct the trachea or rupture; to general paralysis of the insane, or paresis; to tabes, or disease of the spinal cord, leading to gradual loss of ability to walk, loss of control of excretion and degenerative arthritis; or finally to narrowing of the origin of the coronary arteries, leading to angina.\n\nIt seems clear that Wilde suffered from suppurative disease of the middle ear, which leads to mastoiditis and often to meningitis. Meningitis may occur in early syphilis but not as an acute cause of death in the tertiary stage of the disease.\n\nI would guess that while it is quite possible that Wilde had syphilis, it is unlikely that it was the cause of death.
