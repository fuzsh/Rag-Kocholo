The recognition of Syphilis, as a factor in the causation of mental disorders was, however, very scant until the latter half of the 19th Century, when the possibility of General Paralysis being origin was first raised.\n\n.luetic in\n\nUntil then, probably only\n\nSyphilomania (later classified with Syphilitic Insanity by Skae), held any ground.\n\nShaw quotes Fournier as\n\nreferring to a mental form, as one of his six forms of cerebral syphilis.\n\nThis mental form he stated, existed\n\nin two varieties, the Depressive and the Expansive.\n\nIn\n\naddition, he also described a Syphilitic Pseudo-General Paralysis, which he differentiated from ^eal* General Paralysis under eight principle headings.\n\nTwo of these\n\nheadings are of great interest:\"The lesions differ in Syphilis, those of the meninges predominate, while in General Paralysis, those of the cortex11. \"Cure, possible in syphilis, is almost impossible in General Paralysis\".\n\n- 3 -\n\nHere Fournier differentiates between a meningeal and a paranchymatous disorder, by means of either the pathological findings, or by the response to treatment. The inference being that to differentiate on clinical grounds is likely to be difficult.\n\nFolsom, on the\n\nother hand, in discussing syphilitic insanity stated... tfthere are no diagnostic marks to distinguish it from insanity not caused by syphilis, except in a certain proportion of cases of organic syphilitic disease of the brain” . General Paralysis, which, from the psychiatric point of view, is invariably considered the most common form of syphilitic mental disorder, was not universally recognised as being due to syphilis until the early part of this century.\n\nNevertheless, Haslam, in 1798,\n\nunbeknowingly.described a case which is now regarded as the first to be mentioned in the literature, and in a later part of the second edition of his book (1808) he drew attention to the frequent association of paralysis with insanity, and of mental feebleness with elation and feelings of well-being.\n\nEsquirol, in the beginning of\n\nthe 19th Century, made several references to the disease, but it was left to Bayle in 1822 to recognise the disease as an entity, which he at that time called ”Chronic Arachnitis” . He separated it from other forms\n\n- 4 -\n\nof mental disorder, and claimed, from his observations, that there was a definite pathology as its basis, and that it was manifested in life by a recognisable set of mental and physical signs and symptoms.\n\nFour years\n\nlater Calmeil published details about the disease and named it 1General Paralysis*.\n\nIn this country, literature on the subject is sparse during the first half of the century, but in 1858 Bucknill and Tuke published their manual of 1Psychological Medicine1, and in it classified the various forms of insanity, all of which, they averred, could be 1complicated by General Paralysis or Epilepsy1.\n\nIn the later\n\nedition,\n\n(1874), they defined General Paralysis as:\"A disorder marked by general and progressive loss of co-ordinating power over the muscles, especially those of speech and locomotion, combined with mental enfeeblement, always tending £0 dementia, and frequently characterised by a sense of well-being or actual delusions of an exalted character’1. Maudsley, in his \"Pathology of Mind\" (1878) regards General Paralysis of the Insane as the most definite and satisfactory example of a clinical variety of mental disease.\n\nHe attributes it to sexual excess, though he\n\nmentions, in passing, that some writers deem syphilis to\n\n- 5 -\n\nbe the most frequent cause.\n\nHe also describes varieties\n\nof General Paralysis which begin with, or are associated with, symptoms of Tabes Dorsalis.\n\nFrom this time on, the question of the syphilitic origin of General Paralysis is met with frequently. Clouston, (1883), concludes his chapter on General Paralysis with the opinion, f,I do not think there is any proof that it is syphilitic in origin11.\n\nMickle (1886) was non-commital, while Folsom, in the same year stated that, \"recent investigators find syphilis to be a part of the anticedent history of from one half tb three quarters of the cases\", and that some writers \"think that so large a proportion can be accounted for only by some specific relation between the two diseases\". Savage, in 1892, wrote, \"Syphilis may produce mental disorder by causing loss or destruction of nerve tissue, such as organic dementia; it may cause sensory troubles leading to mental disorder; or it may cause disorder of nutrition and function, which may lead to ordinary insanity or epilepsy\".\n\nWith regard to General Paralysis his view was 11.... we consider syphilis is one of its most common causes. We believe it acts in different ways in different people, and affects different parts of the nervous system, but that its tendency is to start a process of degeneration, which ultimately produces the ruin we recognise as General Paralysis, and that it may play the sole, or only a partial cause\". Krafft-Ebing1s experiment in 1897 went a long way towards the theory of \"No Syphilis, no General Paralysis\", but two years later Mott did not accept this dictum unconditionally.\n\nBianchi, in 1904, in his chapter on\n\nGeneral Paralysis, also wrote, \"Numerous observations have clearly shown me that no difference exists, in any stage of the disease, either in symptomatology, or in course, between progressive paralysis arising from syphilis, and that from any other cause\". Kraepelin in his lectures on Clinical Psychiatry (1904), however, states.... \"The disease seems always to develop after syphilitic infection, and it must seem questionable if cases which have not been preceded by syphilis are really of the same kind as the bulk of those observed\". However, with the discovery of the Wasserman reaction in 1906, most authorities were finally agreed that syphilis was a necessary precursor of General Paralysis. Mainly owing to Mott*s teaching, General Paralysis and Tabes Dorsalis, were still regarded as Parasyphilis, but this doctrine was finally abandoned when, in 1913, Noguchi and Moore discovered the spirochaete in the\n\n- 7 -\n\nbrains from cases of General Paralysis.\n\n(b)\n\nGeneral Trends\n\nFrom Haslamfs time, until the introduction of the Wasserman reaction, the diagnosis of General Paralysis and ” syphilitic insanities’* had depended on clinical examination of the physical and mental states.\n\nAs a\n\nresult the descriptions of the disorders in the text­ books of the period could not be surpassed for detail of signs and symptoms.\n\nVarious types and stages were\n\ndescribed, and prognosis was formulated accordingly. The prognosis in General Paralysis of the Insane was invariably given as fatal, and many writers went so far as to state that any cases classed as recovered must have been wrongly diagnosed.\n\nSyphilitic insanity and\n\nSyphilitic Pseudo-General Paralysis, on the other hand, were given a more favourable prognosis, due to several factors, but mainly because there was a possibility of curing the syphilis.\n\nWith the establishment of the relationship of General Paralysis to Syphilis, and especially with the\n\n- 8 -\n\nWasherman reaction available as a diagnostic test, a tremendous change in the attitude towards General Paralysis took place, particularly in diagnosis.\n\nMany\n\ncases formerly not considered as General Paralysis, and not even classed as Syphilitic Insanity, were grouped under this label, while other cases, which would undoubtedly have been so classified,. were eliminated by the Wasserman.\n\nThis trend towards\n\nlaboratory diagnosis was further emphasised in 1912 when Lange introduced his Colloidal Gold Reaction, with its differentiation of \"Paretic” ,\n\n\",Luetic\", and \"Meningeal\"\n\ncurves.\n\nIn 1910 Ehrlich and Hata had introduced the arsenobenzol compound known as \"606\", or Salvarsan, for the treatment of Syphilis, and together with Mercury, Bismuth, and Potassium Iodide, formed a promising therapeutic armament, which, not unnaturally, was enthusiastically and optimistically directed against a disease which had hitherto been deemed incurable.\n\nThe\n\nresults were disappointing and we find Mott declaring in 1914, \"Candidly, I do not think any measure of success has attended any of the methods of treatment so far\n\n- 9 -\n\nemployed for General Paralysis11. Nevertheless, strenuous efforts were being made, by investigators in many countries, to produce drugs of less toxicity and greater therapeutic power.\n\nThe trend\n\nin relation to General Paralysis had now completely shifted to treatment, with the result that ”a clinical picture accepted for nearly a century before laboratory tests were invoked in the diagnosis” , (Brander), became neglected.\n\nThe introduction of malarial therapy by\n\nWagner-Jauregg in 1917, and of Tryparsamide in 1923 by Lorenz and Hodges, raised so much optimism that the diagnosis of General Paralysis became nearly as routine as the treatment.\n\nDuring the next few years the\n\nliterature on the subject of the treatment of General Paralysis became so abundant, and claims of cure so frequent, that following a provocative paper, read by Brander at the Annual Meeting of the Royal MedicoPsychological Association in 1928, a special committee was appointed to discuss the entire subject.\n\nDespite\n\nthis, or perhaps because of its non-committal findings, the tendency even to the present day, is to be dependent on laboratory findings, and to classify the majority of cases of Intracranial Neurosyphilis with mental symptoms,\n\n- 10 -\n\nas General Paralysis of the Insane.\n\nEven cases lacking\n\nthe characteristic physical and/or mental symptoms are so designated and treated.\n\nThe prodigious literature on\n\nGeneral Paralysis is mainly concerned with new methods of laboratory investigation, or refinements in treatment. Only sketchy clinical descriptions of patients appear in papers, and in arriving at the diagnosis the emphasis is invariably on serological findings.\n\nSuch, I feel,\n\nhas been the trend during the 1J0 years since General Paralysis was first described\n\n-\n\nfrom a distinct\n\nclinical entity, such as was described by Haslam and Bayle, to a comprehensive group of conditions which have, by neglect, been lumped together under the original term of General Paralysis of the Insane.\n\nOne might even\n\nsay that the disease, isolated by Bayle and Calmeil from the mass of insanities, has, with the swing of the pendulum, and the passage of time, become once more obscured.\n\n- 11 -\n\nSECTION\n\nII.\n\nOBSERVATIONS WHICH ACTUATED THE INVESTIGATIONS. AND STATEMENT OF THESIS\n\nAs a student, and so far as I am able to recall, my conception of cerebral syphilis as a mental disorder was General Paralysis, and the picture of this disease in my mind was of a grandiose, expansive, delusional state, accompanied by certain definite neurological and serological signs.\n\nI had not been long in the Mental Hospital service, however, before I had noted that most of the cases diagnosed as General Paralysis did not conform to this type.\n\nVery rapidly I came to recognise that the mental\n\npicture varied in an exceedingly wide range, and that neurological signs also were by no means constant.\n\nEven\n\nserological findings showed differingresults, but one almost constant feature was the Lange Colloidal Gold reaction\n\n- a paretic curve was, as far as I could judge\n\nat that time, invariable, and seemed to be the sign which clinched the diagnosis.\n\n- 12 -\n\nIn reviewing a number of cases I noticed that, not infrequently, some had been diagnosed as Mania, Melancholia, Primary Dementia, Delusional, or Confusional Insanity, though within a short time this diagnosis was altered to conform to the serological picture.\n\nWhat\n\nimpressed me most was that these cases had been diagnosed by very experienced Psychiatrists, and I was forced to the conclusion that\n\nwithout other methods of confirmation,\n\nthe clinical picture must have been indistinguishable, on admission, from true states of Mania, Melancholia, and so on.\n\nThe question which thrust itself at me at this stage was, 11Is it possible that many cases of mental disorder are lumped together as General Paralysis of the Insane merely because there is serological and/or neurological evidence of syphilis?1’\n\nI decided to collect details of all eases of General Paralysis admitted to the hospital over a definite' .period and to investigate and study them with three objectives in view.\n\nThese objectives are the aims\n\n- 13 -\n\nef my thesis which is to prove.... (1) That General Paralysis of the Insane, as defined and described throughout the 19th Century, is still a recognisable entity, but, in m o d e m times, a much rarer disease.\n\nTreatment may arrest\n\nthe progress of the disease, but cure, in the true sense of the word, is not possible, because it is primarily a degenerative disease of the parenchyma. (2) That many cases, designated as General Paralysis are, in fact, psychoses of a non-organic type, in which the neurosyphilis is not necessarily the precipitating agent, but in which, if not treated or inadequately treated, the effects of the neurosyphilis may eventually cloud the original disorder, by secondarily involving the parenchyma. (3) That it would be advantageous to differentiate between General Paralysis and other Insanities with Neurosyphilis, and to classify the latter as, for example, Mania with neurosyphilis or Schizophrenia with neurosyphilis and so on, in order that treatment appropriate to the psychosis could be initiated, where indicated, in addition to antisyphilitic measures.\n\n- 14 -\n\nSECTION\n\nIII.\n\nMETHOD ADOPTED TO ARRIVE AT CONCLUSIONS.\n\nI propose to show that General Paralysis can be separated from other psychoses associated with neurosyphilis, by considering........ (a) The mental states. (b) The neuropathology of the conditions. (c) The neurological signs. (d) The serological findings. (e) The response to treatment. In so doing, I shall refer to the literature on the several subjects, and also to a series of 539 cases, admitted to the County Mental Hospital, Rainhill, Lancashire, between January 1925 and December 1938.\n\nThis\n\nseries, comprising 421 male and 118 female patients had all been classified, at one stage or another, as General Paralytics.\n\nThe conclusions to be drawn from the study\n\nof such a series of cases have limitations: (1)\n\nIn nearly two-thirds of the cases I was\n\ndependent on the recorded observations of others, and, especially with neurological findings, this could lead to discrepancies.\n\n- 15 -\n\n(2) With few exceptions, the cases were certified prior to admission, and therefore, from the psychiatric point of view, might be considered well established. (3) Previous histories were inadequate in most cases. (4) There was no systematic follow-up scheme for the remissions in the series. There are advantages, however, from the view point of my thesis (1) All cases contained a mental statement in the form of the ”7 day’s notice” to the Board of Control which had, in practically every case, been made by the same reputable Psychiatrist. (2) The same serological tests were used in all cases --- (Blood and c.s.f. Sigma Reactions; Colloidal Gold Reaction]. estimation)\n\nFoam test;\n\nand Globulin\n\nand the readings assessed by the\n\nsame technician. The main results of my study of this series of cases are set out in tabulated and graphical form in the Appendix, whilst*; reference will be made in the text to these tables and graphs.\n\n- 16 -\n\nSECTION\n\nIV.\n\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON CASES\n\nMy case material consists of the 539 cases diagnosed at one stage or another while in hospital, as General Paralysis, and admitted to Rainhill Mental Hospital, Lancashire, during a period of 14 years.\n\nA detailed\n\nlist of the annual admissions is contained in Table I (Page 148).\n\nPerusal of this table shows several points\n\nof general Interest.\n\nThe first striking feature is the\n\nincidence of such a diagnosis as between male and female patients.\n\nThough many more women than men were admitted\n\nto hospital, with all types of mental disorder, among those diagnosed as General Paralytics there were 22 more men than women admitted in an average year.\n\nThe actual\n\nproportion of men to women was 4 : 1 , which is in keeping with the generally accepted ratio in standard works during the past 40 years.\n\nThe average annual\n\npercentage of male General Paralytics admitted was 11*9, a figure which indicates that this type of disorder plays by no means a minor role in the causation of insanity among the male population.\n\nAs only 2*9 per\n\ncentum of females admitted, in an average year, were given this diagnosis, the role, or possible\n\nrole, of\n\n- 17 -\n\nsyphilis as an aetiological factor would not appear to he so serious among women.\n\nFrom this table it will also\n\nbe noted that though the actual number of cases of ”General Paralysis” varied considerably from year to year, and in the sexes, the total percentage of these cases each year, varied within very narrow limits.\n\nThis\n\nfact is, perhaps, better illustrated by Graphs I and II (Pages 149 and 150).\n\nThe point is of special interest\n\nin view of the many opinions given that General Paralysis is less frequent in relation to other disorders than in former years.\n\nIt is probable that these opinions were\n\nformulated on actual numbers of cases, and without reference to the total numbers of certified admissions.\n\nTable II (Page 151) shows the actual numbers of cases, diagnosed as General Paralysis, who were admitted, discharged, and who died, each year throughout the period under review, and these figures are also presented in another form in Graph III.\n\nThe latter shows very\n\nclearly the steady fall in actual numbers of admissions which, as already pointed out, could indicate erroneously, that the incidence of ”General Paralysis” was on the wane. It is also important to consider this observation from\n\n- 18 -\n\nthe point of view of the !typef of mental state presented. Later in this thesis it will he contended that more than half the cases which had been diagnosed as General Paralysis should more correctly have been diagnosed as a fundamental reaction-type psychosis with neurosyphilis. In other words that Mania, Melancholia, Schizophrenia, and so on, existed in the presence of a neurosyphilitic infection, and that these mental disorders could, and almost certainly would, have arisen in the absence of syphilis.\n\nThe fact that the diagnosis flGeneral Paralysis”\n\nvaried directly with the total certified admissions each year, would appear to support this contention, as no one has indicated that the fundamental disorders, such as schizophrenia or melancholia, are on the decline, though no doubt, the actual numbers vary directly with the total numbers admitted each year to hospital.\n\nThe numbers and percentages of patients admitted, and their progress while in hospital, are given in Tables III and IV (Page 153).\n\nAll cases discharged, though not\n\nnecessarily recovered, were considered, for the purpose of this investigation, to have shown improvement with treatment.\n\nSimilarly those cases remaining in hospital\n\nat the end of 1938 were looked upon as improved in the sense that treatment had arrested the neurosyphilitic disease process.\n\nThough not strictly accurate conclusions,\n\nthe error must he so small as to be safely disregarded, and, in any case, it would be neutralised by those cases who did show arrest of the disease process, without mental improvement, but eventually died in hospital and were included in the deaths.\n\nThe improvement refers then to the beneficial effect of treatment on evidence of activity of the syphilis, as illustrated by those who were able to leave hospital and those still in hospital.\n\nOn this basis, the tables show\n\nthat improvement with treatment occurs more frequently among females than males and that the overall improvement rate in the series of cases is 38$.\n\nThis figure is well\n\nwithin the limits given by most investigators.\n\nWhen one studies the period of residence in hospital prior to discharge or death, it is found that the bulk of patients remained in hospital less than one year, and that more than 60% were discharged :br died in* less than 6 months.\n\nThe patients who received treatment were the\n\n- 20 -\n\nonly ones investigated from this aspect, and the results are shown in Graph IY (Page 154).\n\nThe ages of patients on\n\nadmission were considered\n\nin order to determine if age could he a prognostic factor.\n\nIt was found that age incidence varied little\n\nfrom that stated by authorities throughout the years, the vast majority of patients being aged between 36 and 55, and, that age on admission in males did not influence the prognosis to any extent.\n\nIn females, however, though\n\nthe numbers were relatively small, the prognosis was excellent in those under 35 years of age improvement.\n\n- - 60% showing\n\nGraphs Y and VI (Pages 155 and 156)\n\nillustrate these points.\n\nIn Table V the mental condition on admission of all patients is shown, and whether they died, were discharged, or remained in hospital.\n\nThough reference to this table\n\nwill be made in later parts of the text, I feel it would be pertinent to mention a few points of general interest* The cases tabulated as unclassifiable include cases of Tabo-paresis, in which the paresis had supervened on a\n\n- 21 -\n\ndiagnosed Tabes;\n\ncases of Juvenile Paralysis;\n\nCongenital Defect;\n\nof\n\nand one or two who died so soon\n\nafter admission that a reliable assessment of the mental state could not be obtained.\n\nThe ratio between males and females in the combined first two groups\n\n-\n\nwhich I intend to prove are cases\n\nof Dementia Paralytica\n\n-\n\nis approximately 4 : 1 .\n\nthe other groups it varies enormously. it is nearly 1 : 1 ;\n\nit is lj : 1 .\n\nIn the Manics\n\nin the Melancholics 2 : 1 ;\n\nthe Schizophrenics 2*5 : 1 ;\n\nIn\n\nin\n\nand in the Paranoid states\n\nThe significance, or otherwise, of these\n\nfigures is not at all clear, but may have some bearing on prognosis.\n\nIn these last four groups the rate of\n\nimprovement, as indicated by discharges and those remaining in hospital, is 47$, as compared with only 29$ in the other two groups, and an overall improvement rate of 38$.\n\nThe group showing the highest degree of\n\nbenefit from treatment is the Paranoid state in which the rate is 55$.\n\nNext in order are Mania 44$,\n\nMelancholia\n\n43$, Schizophrenia 40$, Confusional state 32$, and lastly the Demented group, 24$.\n\nThese figures and\n\npercentages are found in Tables VI - VIII (Pages 158 and 159)•\n\n- 22 -\n\nThe presence, or absence, of neurological signs was examined in order to decide if there were any group of signs which could differentiate between Dementia Paralytica and Meningo-vascular syphilis.\n\nNo positive\n\nconclusions could be drawn from the analysis made.\n\nIn\n\n103 cases no neurological signs were elicited on examination on admission.\n\nOf these, 28 were of the\n\nDemented or Confused types, that is, 11$ of the total cases in these groups. of the other groups.\n\nThis compares with 74, or 27$, One case was unclassifiable.\n\nThe\n\n74 cases who showed no neurological signs with mental states of Mania, Melancholia, Paranoid states, and Schizophrenia, will later be shown to have been eases of Latent or Asymptomatic Neurosyphilis.\n\nThe other\n\ncases showing these reaction-type psychoses, showed neurological signs varying from a slight to a marked degree, and the main changes are enumerated in Table XI (Page l6l), while the results of the analysis of all cases, and whether discharged, in hospital, or dead, are shown in Tables IX and X (Page 160).\n\nA further investigation\n\nwas made into the mental states on admission of all cases showing no neurological signs, but no significant conclusion could be drawn from the results, which may be\n\n- 23 -\n\nfound in Tables XII - XIV (Pages 162 and 163).\n\nIt\n\nwill be noted, however, in Table XIV, that, while in Groups 1 and 2, the percentage improved with treatment, and showing no neurological signs, is less than half the percentage improved in all cases in these groups.\n\nIn the\n\nother Groups (3,4 and 5) the percentage of cases, improved with treatment and showing no neurological signs, is even higher than in the Groups as a whole. findingis in\n\nThis\n\naccordance with the opinion of most\n\ninvestigators, with regard to Latent Neurosyphilis, and will be discussed in greater detail later in the text.\n\nIt was possible to examine the cerebrospinal fluid in 517 cases and the routine test used were... (1) The Dreyer-Ward Sigma Reaction. (2) The Foam Test. (3)\n\nThe Ross-Jones test for Globulin.\n\n(4)\n\nThe Lange colloidal gold reaction.\n\nThe Sigma reaction in the blood was carried out routine on all admissions, and that in the cerebrospinal fluid where any indication of neurosyphilis was suggested.\n\nThe Sigma reaction is a flocculation test and it was\n\n-\n\n24 -\n\ncompared with the Wasserman reaction, and the findings reported in a special report of the Medical Research Council.\n\nSome of the conclusions in this report can he\n\nsummarised as follows 5 a.\n\nComplete, or almost complete, agreement between the tests.\n\nb. Divergence occurred in sera with low Sigma readings, in other words, border-line cases. c. The Sigma persists longer than the Wasserman in cases under treatment, and generally falls regularly.\n\nIt is, therefore, more\n\nsensitive to .antisyphilitic drugs. d. Sigma seldom or never gives a false positive. e. Like the Wasserman, a negative Sigma does not necessarily mean no syphilis. f. The Sigma reading seems to correspond to the intensity of the clinical picture. g. It is a valuable method for determining the progress of a case under treatment, and for testing the effect of different remedies — a factor not possible with any other method.\n\n- 25 -\n\nAs a diagnostic test of syphilis the Sigma was found positive in the blood in my cases, with almost unfailing regularity.\n\nIn 70 cases, however, the reaction\n\nwas negative in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nThis finding,\n\nhowever, of a positive blood reaction and a negative c.s.f., is considered by most authorities to indicate a meningo-vascular syphilis rather than a parenchymatous infection, and will be considered more thoroughly later. The intensity of the Sigma reaction in the blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid did not give any indication as to prognosis (Table XV (Page 164)) other than that where the reaction was greater in the fluid, the prognosis is somewhat less promising than when the reaction in both blood and fluid is equal, or when the fluid reaction is less intense than that of the blood.\n\nThe readings in\n\nfemale patients, generally speaking, were less, or weaker, than in males.\n\nOn the assumption that the Sigma units\n\nindicate the degree of infection rather than the extent of damage, this may explain the better prognosis of neurosyphilis among women who receive treatment.\n\nThe Foam test and the Blobulin test were positive in all cases and I feel the most one can assign to them is\n\n- 26 -\n\nthat they indicate the presence of neuros^philis hut do hot identify the variety.\n\nA quantitative test for\n\nglobulin might be of diagnostic value, but all so far devised are complex to perform and unreliable.\n\nThe Lange colloidal gold reaction is a useful confirmatory test for clinically diagnosed General Paralysis, but in itself it is not a reliable indicator. The paretic curve, so named from its almost constant occurence in confirmed General Paralysis, is found very frequently in other varieties of neurosyphilis, and not uncommonly in non-syphilitic conditions.\n\nIt would,\n\nhowever, appear to indicate involvement of the parenchyma, and it would also seem that the zone with the greatest precipitation indicates the degree in which the parenchyma is damaged, the paretic indicating extensive destruction. Perhaps the most important function of the Lange lies in its sensitivity to treatment with antisyphilitic remedies. It is the most persistent of all tests, and the progress of a case can be judged by its gradual return to normal, over usually a period of years.\n\nNicole confirms this\n\nimpression in a series of post-treated cases.\n\n- 27 -\n\nIn my own series of cases a Lange curve, approaching the paretic, or actually paretic, was found in all but 23 cases.\n\nIn these latter, a mid-zone or\n\nluetic curve\n\nwas given in 16 cases, and a meningeal in 7 cases.\n\nAt\n\ndifferent stages subsequent to treatment, 117 cases were re-examined, and in the majority some indication of a return to normal was found.\n\nOf 31 cases remaining in\n\nhospital, for periods of from two to twelve years after treatment, whose cerebrospinal fluid was re-examined, fourteen had completely negative findings, and only two cases showed no change in the Lange\n\n-\n\none 4 years after\n\ntreatment (Malaria and Tryparsamide followed by Pyrifer, Neokharsivan and Bismuth) and one\n\nyears after a course\n\nof Pyrifer, Bismuth and Neokharsivan.\n\nVarious treatments and combinations of treatments were used on 414 patients during the fourteen years in which my cases were admitted.\n\nAs will be seen from Table\n\nXVII (Page 165), Malaria or Pyrifer alone, or combined with Tryparsamide, or the latter alone, were the only treatments given to 342 of these patients.\n\nFrom this\n\nTable, and also Tables XVIII and XVIIIA (Page 165), it will be apparent that the combined treatment of Malaria\n\n-\n\n28 -\n\nor Pyrifer and Tryparsamide, gave by far the best results.\n\nThe method of treatment was to start with\n\nweekly injections of Tryparsamide and, during this course of 12 injections, to inoculate with Malaria, or give 10 rigors with Pyrifer.\n\nThis procedure could\n\naccount for the apparently poor response to Tryparsamide alone, as many patients, started on a course of treatment, had died before pyrexial treatment could be commenced.\n\nA detailed list of the other treatments\n\nused. will. be found.in Table XIX (Page 166).\n\nThe most\n\nefficient of these treatments were those in which Pyrifer was combined with Neokharsivan and Bismuth, and the improvement rate of 62/o, is not only well above the overall improvement rate, but the response to the type of treatment suggests that the cases were almost certainly examples of Meningo-vascular syphilis.\n\nEven\n\nafter the syphilitic origin of 11General Paralysis” had been proved beyond argument, it was found that ordinary antisyphilitic remedies had little effect on prognosis in many cases.\n\nCarlill, and others, describing cures with\n\nsuch drugs, admitted that their cases should, more likely than not, have been diagnosed as Interstitial Neurosyphilis\n\n-\n\nthe differentiation arising from the\n\nknown fact that ordinary trivalent arsenical drugs could\n\n-\n\n29 -\n\nnot pass into the cerebro-spinal fluid.\n\nThe introduction\n\nof malaria therapy produced many statements of 11cured” paresis, but it was not until the advent of Tryparsamide, pentavalent arsenic, that it was apparent the disease process in General Paralysis could be permanently arrested, as witnessed by the return to normal of the Lange.\n\nEven so the use of trivalent arsenicals and\n\nbismuth was continued and was considered the treatment of choice in meningovascular conditions.\n\nAdams in 1941\n\nexpounded that Paresis calls for fever and tryparsamide, and ”Cerebrospinal syphilis for Neoarsenobenzol, bismuth, and occasionally tryparsamide” . My own figures, and experience, are in accord with this opinion, though, in modern times, penicillin and a combination of arsenicals would appear to be the treatment of choice.\n\n- 30 -\n\nSECTION\n\nV.\n\nMAIN DISCUSSION OF CASES. Classification.\n\n^\n\nIt was possible, with reasonable accuracy, to divide the mental states of patients on admission into six main groups: (1)\n\nThosecases in which Dementia predominated.\n\n(2)\n\nThosecases in which Confusion was the most pronounced feature.\n\nA further sub-division was possible in this group: (a) Confusion with extreme restlessness. (b) Confusion with emotional lability. (c) Confusion with exaltation. (3)\n\nThosecases of a Schizophrenic type.\n\n(4)\n\nThosecases with features of Mania-melancholia. (a) Mania. (b) Melancholia.\n\n(5) Those cases of a paranoid type (persecutory as a rule). (6) A very small percentage of cases which could not be reasonably classified under any of the above headings.\n\n- 31 -\n\nIt is possible from this grouping to postulate that the mental picture can be that of an organic-reaction type psychosis —\n\nthat is, of dementia, or a confusional\n\nstate leading to dementia, and including acute Fulminating General Paralysis of the Insane —\n\non the\n\none hand, and, on the other, the picture can be of Schizophrenia, Manic-depression, or a Paranoid state. The first two groups, therefore, could be called General Paralysis, but the other groups almost certainly are psychoses occurring independently of the syphilitic process, in the first place, though the latter is possibly the main exciting cause, and could secondarily overshadow the original picture.\n\n(i) CASES EXHIBITING PROGRESSIVE AND PROFOUND DEMENTIA. (a) Assessment of Dementia\n\nAnother name for General Paralysis of the Insane, unfortunately not now in common use, is Dementia Paralytica.\n\nUnfortunately, because such a name indicates\n\nmuch more clearly the essential clinical features of cerebral parenchymatous syphilis —\n\na dementia accompanied\n\n-\n\n32 -\n\nby paresis.\n\nEarlier descriptions of General Paralysis mention among the “varieties” a demented form.\n\nFolsom describes\n\nit as...... “consisting in a very slowly advancing mental impairment, making progress side by side with muscular loss of control and power” . A demented type of General Paralysis is mentioned frequently in the literature and in most of the present day standard text-books on Psychological Medicine.\n\nThe\n\noverall opinion appears to be that it is a progressive type which shows little or no response to treatment. The disease process may be arrested by treatment, but the dementia remains, and life is merely prolonged for a few years.\n\nReeve went as far as to state that.....\n\n“To succeed in prolonging life when the patient had already attained the stage of dementia is frankly not worth while” .\n\nMott described Dementia Paralytica many years ago as a primary atrophy of the neurones, and as such postulated the essential feature of the disease as dementia.\n\nFrom the histo-pathological point of view, it\n\nhas been well established that the greatest amount of\n\n- 33 -\n\nwasting in Dementia Paralytica, is in the frontal region.\n\nShaw Bolton has emphasised that the amount of\n\nthis wasting varies directly with the amount of dementia existing in the patients.\n\nHe further demonstrated that\n\nthe pyramidal layer of nerve cells in the frontal cortex develops, pari passu, with the development of the psychic powers of the individual, and is the only layer which appreciably varies in depth in normal brains;\n\nand that\n\nthe polymorphic layer, the first to develop, is the last to fail in dementia, and probably subserves the ordinary functions, such as attending to their own wants.\n\nHe\n\nshowed, by a series of micrometric examinations of the cortex, a marked resemblance between the condition of the cortex at birth, when mentation is about to begin, and at death, in the final stage of primary decay of the prefrontal cortex, when the mind had practically gone. It is also of interest to note that Bianchi*s conclusions, after frontal ablation in monkeys, were in keeping with Shaw Bolton*s findings.\n\nHis animals no longer showed\n\nany restraint or resourcefulness, and utilization of past experience was absolutely wanting.\n\nWatson has described\n\nthe changes he found in the cortex in General Paralysis, and, besides typical vascular changes in the meninges and\n\n- 34 -\n\nneuronic tissue, with glial proliferation, stresses the great destruction of the smaller pyramidal cells in the prefrontal region, as compared with that in the central and calcarine areas.\n\nLamination is completely destroyed\n\nin the frontal region, whereas it is still fairly definite in the central area, and normal in the calcarine. These findings are in accord with the frontal cerebral wasting which is so typical in the brains of General Paralytics.\n\nOf the patients in my series of cases,. 75? or 12$, could be classed.in my first group, where dementia predominated.\n\nOf these, 57 had died by the end of\n\n1938, and 32 came to post-mortem.\n\nIn all but one case\n\nthe diagnosis was confirmed by the marked frontal wasting;\n\nby the frontal, parietal and sylvian opacities\n\nin the meninges; the ventricles;\n\nby the varying degree of dilatation of by the decortication on stripping,\n\nparticularly meso-frontally;\n\nby the more or less\n\noedematous nature of the brain;\n\nand by the granulations\n\nin the Ventricles, and especially in the region of the calamus scriptorius.\n\nThe only other findings of note were,\n\na large sub-dural haemorrhage in one case, optic atrophy\n\n- 35- -\n\nin another, and carcinoma of the stomach in a third.\n\nIn\n\nthe case not confirmed at post-mortem, the patient, aged 58, would appear to have been diagnosed in the absence of any but mental signs of gross and relatively rapid dementia.\n\n(b) Neurological Signs.\n\nMott stated that unequal pupils, fixed to light and sometimes to accommodation, was the most important early physical sign of General Paralysis. muscles of the face, hands and tongue; exaggerated tendon reflexes;\n\nTremor of the\n\nslurred speech;\n\nand iridoplegia were given\n\nby H.W.Lewis, in 1897, as the four cardinal neurological signs of General Paralysis.\n\nHenderson and Gillespie in\n\ntheir description of the physical signs of Dementia Paralytica concur in this view, but stress that all these signs are variable.\n\nThey also believe that loss of\n\naccommodation response, and optic atrophy, occur more usually in cases of General Paralysis which are associated, with Tabes Dorsalis.\n\nWorster-Drought also emphasises the\n\nvariability of all these signs and that in many cases\n\n- 36 -\n\npupillary reactions, and tendon reflexes, are normal.\n\nTreatment is said to produce improvement in neurological signs.\n\nHead and Fearnsides cite numerous\n\nexamples in which improvement occurred in all directions. Most other investigators, however, are more conservative in their estimations of neurological improvement. Tennent found that considerable improvement could be expected in speech, tremor, and inco-ordination, but he did not consider that pupillary changes showed any alteration.\n\nHe quoted various authorities whose\n\ninvestigations led to similar conclusions.\n\nMy own\n\nexperience leads me to the same conclusions, for though I have frequently observed marked amelioration in speech, reduction of tremor, and improved co-ordination, I cannot recall having seen any change in reflexes or pupils.\n\nAmong my cases in Group (i) the variability of neurological signs was marked. are those recorded on admission.\n\nIn all cases the findings In nine cases no\n\nevidence of neurological involvement waseLicited. other cases some or all of the cardinal signs were\n\nIn all\n\n- 37 -\n\napparent —\n\nin 48 cases marked ophthalmoplegia was noted;\n\nin 27 cases tendon reflexes were grossly exaggerated, while in 15 cases reflexes were absent;\n\nand in 17 cases\n\nspeech was very slurred.\n\nFrom the neurological examination of cases in Group (i) no clear cut diagnosis could be made, though the presence of pathological eye changes can be said to be the most frequent neurological accompaniment of those cases in which dementia predominated.\n\n(c) Laboratory Examinations\n\nDattner, whose monumental book on HThe Management of Neurosyphilis11 is recognized universally as the standard work on serological reactions, states in this book.... ”there is not a single test that can be considered as exclusively characteristic of a specific type of neurosyphilis” . He, however, agrees 11that in the vast majority of instances the cases which do not give a colloidal gold reaction will not prove to be Paresis” . In addition he states himself in accord with Kilduffe,\n\n- 38 -\n\nwho had declared that a diagnosis of General Paralysis should never he made unless, in addition to the 1paretic curve1, increased globulin content, increased cell count, and positive blood and c.s.f. Wasserman reactions are also found.\n\nOn further reviewing the literature he arrives\n\nat the final opinion...... ”We find that none of the spinal fluid syndromes, per se, enables us to arrive at a proper differential diagnosis as to the exact pathological processes in a given case of neurosyphilis, since even a complete paretic humoral syndrome, which is considered as most specific, may be misleading. But this is not surprising, for here, as in other fields of medicine, one is dependent on more than the laboratory findings” . Worster-Drought asserts that in the absence of a paretic curve he would hesitate to make a definite diagnosis of General Paralysis, though...... 11In a few instances, however, the Lange curve may be 1luetic1 in type” .\n\nThese opinions appear, from perusal of the literature, to be conclusions that are generally accepted, and may be couched in another way.\n\nWhere clinically\n\nand neurologically the diagnosis points to General Paralysis, positive c.s.f. findings confirm the diagnosis, but in the absence of mental or neurological signs,\n\n- 39 -\n\npositive c.s.f. findings need not necessarily make the diagnosis.\n\nIn my group of cases, the dementia and neurological signs, pointed to the diagnosis of General Paralysis. In only one of these 75 cases was a paretic curve not found.\n\nIn addition to dementia, his tendon reflexes\n\nwere absent, he had Argyll-Robertson pupils, his blood and c.s.f. Sigma Reactions were positive, but his Colloidal Gold reading was 1123421000.\n\nHe was treated\n\nwith Malaria and Tryparsamide, and when he died, two years later, the diagnosis was confirmed by post-mortem examination.\n\nTwo cases had a positive blood Sigma,\n\nparetic curves and negative c.s.f. Sigma.\n\nOne of these\n\ncases was examined post-mortem and the diagnosis confirmed. Only one case had a negative blood Sigma and positive c.s.f. findings.\n\n(d) Effects of Treatment\n\nDuring the 19th Century, General Paralysis of the Insane was regarded as an invariably fatal disease, and '\n\n- 40 -\n\neven when syphilis was accepted as the cause, treatment had little effect on what was known as the progressively dementing type.\n\nWith the advent of malaria and\n\ntryparsamide hopes were aroused that this type would benefit, but several authors who classified their cases into clinical types, (Bamford, Smyth, Tennent), found that other types benefitted more than the dementing type.\n\nNicol and Hutton mention \"the bad prognosis\n\nassociated with the dementing case\".\n\nMuncie also states.*.\n\n\"The simple dementing type has a more unfavourable prognosis than the types with strongly affective features\".\n\nOf those in Group (i) of my series, of cases, 47 received treatment, but 38 of them died in hospital.\n\nOf\n\nthe remaining 9> one escaped, and one was transferred to another hospital.\n\nThe other seven were all discharged,\n\nunimproved mentally, to the care of friends, but five of them were known to have died within a year of leaving hospital.\n\nFrom the above observations I contend that I am Justified in classifying those cases in my first group as true Dementia Paralytica, but feel that there can be\n\n- 41 -\n\nfew people who would disagree that a picture of progressive dementia, relatively rapid, with or without evidence of muscular paralysis, and with positive serological findings indicative of neurosyphilis, should not he so diagnosed.\n\n(ii)\n\nCASES IN WHICH CONFUSION WAS PROMINENT\n\nAssessment of Mental State\n\nIn my second group are patients in whom, on admission, the predominant picture was mental confusion, but who, in the main also showed varying signs of dementia. Included in this group are the exalted, grandiose, expansive cases, who typify the classical text-book G.P.I., and who represent 27$ of the group, but only 8$ of the total cases in the series.\n\nIt was found possible to\n\nfurther sub-divide the fconfusionalsT according as to whether the confusion was associated particularly with extreme restlessness, with emotional lability, or with exaltation.\n\nIt is of interest to note that Nicol and Hutton, in\n\n- 42 -\n\ntheir classification of clinical types of G.P.I., include the Grandiose, the Manic, the Melancholic, the Dementing and the Confused;\n\nand that they consider \"the\n\ndifferentiation between definite confusion and dementia presents great difficulties\".\n\nShaw Bolton, in his work on Amentia and Dementia, defined mental confusion as a symptom-complex, which probably precedes all dementias, which is the result of a toxic process, and in which the prominent features are' disorientation;\n\nmore or less complete inability to\n\nretain impressions, even when frequently repeated; illusions of identity, such as mistaking total strangers for acquaintances, friends or relatives;\n\nand rapidly\n\nvarying and quite unsystematised delusions.\n\nThis is the\n\nearliest description of confusion which I have met with in the literature, and it differs in few respects from the changes described by Henderson and Gillespie, in the intellectual sphere, in Organic reaction-type psychoses, in which they include Dementia Paralytica,.... \"...there is impairment of comprehension,interference with elaboration of impressions, defects in orientation and retention, difficulty in activation of memories, and marked fluctuation of the level of attention\".\n\n- 43 -\n\nBevan Lewis, though he does not mention syphilis as a factor in the causation of mental disorder in his text­ book, quotes Campbell*s work ;on the *Neuro-muscular changes in General Paralysis* in support of the theory that the changes secondary to the primary brain lesions are identical to \"the conditions found in the group of primary toxaemic neuroses, dependent on an intrinsic toxic agent\".\n\nHenderson and Gillespie, in discussing the infection-exhaustion type of organic psychosis, write.... \"Where....confusion is present, it is a good working rule to search for a physical, especially a toxic or septic, basis\", but they do not mention syphilis as an infection commonly producing psychoses, yet they comment favourably on Fildes and McIntosh*s view that.... \"The *parasyphilitic* diseases are due to an exacerbation of Spirochaeta pallida about nerve elements which are in a state of hypersusceptibility. This state is induced as a reaction to an intoxication occurring in the secondary period, and the spirochaetes taking part in the exacerbation are remnants of those which produced the original infection\".\n\nSimilarly, Muncie, in his chapter on the Support disorders (Dysergasia), does not include Syphilis in his\n\n- 44 -\n\ntabulated list of causes, though later, in discussing Dementia Paralytica, he writes, \"....paresis has become the least significant of mental reactions.... Its greatest theoretical interest at this date is in the differentiation of dysergasic (toxic, infectious, etc) from anergasic (acquired organic deficit) reactions. The reversibility of the process, in whole or part, suggests the need for the determination of the factors, short of actual cell destruction, responsible for the well-known clinical features which were thought to be anergasic, but which in whole or in part yield to treatment\".\n\nWeil, in his text-book 011 Neuropathology, is much more definite on the toxic effects of syphilis and makes frequent reference to \"the histo-pathologic changes that may be produced by the toxins of Treponema Pallida within the brain and spinal cord\".\n\nThe tendency would, therefore, appear to be to regard Dementia Paralytica as a chronic infective and degenerative disease process, due to the direct action of the Spirochaeta Pallida, with a possibility that toxic effects of the organism may produce variations of the clinical picture.\n\n- 45 -\n\n(a) Confusion with Restlessness\n\nI consider that only by admitting the possibility of a toxaemia can one account for the extreme confusion met with especially in the 1so-called* acute, fulminating cases of G.P.I.\n\nThis would appear to be borne out by\n\nSmyth* s investigation into the relation of the Spirochaeta Pallida to the pathological changes of Dementia Paralytica.\n\nThough he was able to demonstrate\n\nSphochaetes in 38 of 52 cases, he found them few in number, or absent, in the acute variety, with a mental picture of marked confusion and rapid exhaustion, and a histological picture of gross neuronic destruction, vaso-dilation of the cortex, and slight or no neuroglial reaction in the deeper layers.\n\nThe slight, or absent,\n\ncerebral wasting in these cases, is explained by Shaw Bolton as due to the rapid course of the disease, and the consequent imcomplete removal of the products of degeneration.\n\nKraepelin describes in detail a case which\n\nhe states is typical of those cases in which the whole course of the \"illness is rapid and stormy\".\n\nHe terms\n\nsuch cases \"Galloping Paralysis\" and mentions confusion, and extreme restlessness and excitement, as the outstanding symptoms.\n\nShaw quotes Voisin as stipulating an \"Acute\n\n- 46 -\n\nGeneral Paralysis, in which the course is rapid, the stages are confounded, and death occurs early as a rule\".\n\nSurvey of Cases\n\nOf those cases in my series, dying within one month of admission, —\n\n51 or 70$, were grossly confused and\n\nviolently restless.\n\nAge bore no relation to the type of\n\nillness, the majority corresponding in proportion to the age incidence throughout the series of cases.\n\nNor did\n\neither sex preponderate other than in the greater proportion at which males acquire the disease.\n\nIn:only\n\n11 cases was it possible to commence treatment with tryparsamide or malaria, the majority rapidly exhausting themselves, despite all efforts to restrain them. Neurological signs were marked in 30 cases, absent in 9 cases, while, in 12 cases, only slight evidence of neurological involvement was elicited. to post-mortem —\n\n23 cases came\n\n20 (14 males and 6 females) were\n\nconfirmed as Dementia Paralytica, and three could not be confirmed histologically, despite positive neurological and serological findings.\n\nNo unusual phenomena were\n\ndiscovered, with the exception of evidence of a subdural haemorrhage in one female.\n\nIn three cases it had not\n\n- 47 -\n\nbeen possible to obtain cerebro-spinal fluid, but in one of these cases the fluid was examined post-mortem and gave positive readings.\n\nIn all other cases the Sigma\n\nwas positive in Blood and c.s.f., the Colloidal Gold Reaction gave a strong 1paretic1 curve, the foam test was positive, and globulin was increased.\n\nThe only\n\nother observation which need be mentioned, is, that the fluid Sigma reading was greater than that of the serum Sigma in rather more than half of the cases, whereas this occurred only in 75 of the remaining 466 cases in which a comparison could be made.\n\nFrom this evidence I feel justified in postulating that an acute fulminating type of Dementia Paralytica, due to a cerebral toxaemia, manifested clinically by a state of profound confusion and extreme restlessness, and associated with neurological and serological evidence o f . neurosyphilis, occurs more frequently than is commonly indicated.\n\nThe other cases in my series, in which confusion and restlessness predominated, differed only in severity\n\n- 48 -\n\nfrom the fulminating type\n\n-\n\n28 cases left hospital,\n\nrelieved to some extent, hut showing evidence, to some degree, of intellectual reduction.\n\nThere were nine\n\ncases remaining in hospital at the end of 1938. had received treatment\n\n—\n\nAll\n\n6 Malaria and Tryparsamide;\n\nand 3 Pyrifer and Tryparsamide.\n\nAll showed evidence of\n\nsevere dementia, though one male was still capable of simple routine work under supervision.\n\nThe average\n\nage on admission was 46 years, and the average period in hospital since admission was six years.\n\nAll showed\n\nimprovement in serological reactions, which on admission had been ’Paretic*, and two cases showed completely negative findings.\n\nFrom the above observations I feel that one is justified in diagnosing as Dementia Paralytica, those cases, in which Confusion and restlessness are the outstanding features of the mental picture, especially when associated with positive serological findings. One can also conclude that in a proportion of cases the prognosis is inevitably fatal, and that in others, though the disease process may be arrested, some degree of feeblemindedness remains, and that the end result is a gross dementia.\n\n-\n\n49 -\n\n(b) Confusion with Emotional Lability\n\nThe second sub-division of the confusionals which I have made in my series of cases, is one which is, more or less, universally recognized as a *tyjbe1 of Dementia Paralytica.\n\nThe older writers regarded it merely as a\n\nstage in the progress of the disease.\n\nFolsom, for\n\nexample, considered confusion with temporary outbursts of excitement or anger, and rapid changes in the emotional state as indications of transient vaso-motor disturbances in the brain.\n\nHe described such changes as\n\nbeing prodromal, and especially liable to be overlooked as indicators 11of the period of invasion of general paralysis of the insane” . More recent writers mention the emotional lability present in some cases, but apparently do not consider it other than an occasional happening.\n\nFor example, Tennent apparently includes\n\nthis ’type* in his Simple Dementias.\n\nMuncie mentions\n\nlability of mood only as a general symptom of the main disorder.\n\nI consider that there are sufficient cases\n\nin my series to justify a separate description of those confusional cases in which emotional lability was at one stage a prominent feature.\n\nThere is no doubt that the\n\n- 50 -\n\ncondition progresses, relatively rapidly, to dementia, and that other evidence, neurological, serological, and pathological confirms it as a variety of Dementia Paralytica.\n\nIt is, moreover, felt that thopgh the main\n\npresenting symptom is confusional, the subsidiary picture is so different from the other two varieties of the Confusional group as to warrant further observation and description.\n\nThese cases, 14 in number, proceeded\n\nto dementia, without showing either the extreme restlessness of the first sub-division, or the expansive exaltation of the third.\n\nSerologically all tests were positive.\n\nAll showed marked neurological signs, including, in nine cases, Argyll-Robertson pupils, a proportion incidentally, much higher than any type of case examined.\n\nTreatment\n\nwas begun in all cases, and one course of malaria and tryparsamide was completed, except in two cases, who died within a few weeks of admission.\n\nOnly one case\n\nremained in hospital, in a demented state.\n\nTwo had been\n\ndischarged to the care of friends, and the remainder died within an average of six months of admission.\n\nAt post­\n\nmortem, seven cases which were examined, were confirmed histologically as Dementia Paralytica, and no unusual findings were recorded.\n\n-51 -\n\nFrom these observations little difference emerges compared with the Demented group, other than in the initial mental picture.\n\nProgress, as noted, was towards\n\ndementia, but the instability of mood, the liability to anger, excitement, depression or laughter, on slight provocation, was quite different from the dull, apathetic demeanour of the straightforward demented type. Possibly, if an adequate assessment of the previous personality of these cases had been made, one would have found them to be emotionally unstable, childish, inadequate, self-centred types.\n\nThe syphilitic process,\n\non this hypothesis, would merely act, in its initial stage, to aggravate these features.\n\nAt all events, one\n\ncan, I believe, agree with Folsom, in that this type does occur, though, perhaps, it is but a stage in the course of, and progress towards, Dementia Paralytica.\n\n(e)\n\nConfusion with Exaltation\n\nConfusion with exaltation, in my series of cases, comprises the type of cases described as the classical examples of General Paralysis.\n\nIt conforms to the\n\nearliest description of the disease, and this group can,\n\n- 52 -\n\nin fact, be isolated from the other types described as Genera^ Paralysis, by adhering to Bueknill and Tuke's definition, which I have already quoted:lfA disorder marked by general and progressive loss of co-ordinating power over the muscles, especially those of speech and locomotion, combined with mental enfeeblement, always tending to dementia, and frequently characterised by a sense of well­ being, or actual delusions of an exalted character\".\n\nIn more recent times, the mental confusion has been stressed by all writers on the subject, either as a symptom-complex, or in detail, such as disorientation, liability to mistake identity, impairment of memory, and inability to concentrate.\n\nThe outstanding feature,\n\nhowever, of all descriptions, is the obvious sense of well-being apparent in all such patients, and expressed in ideas of exaltation or grandeur.\n\nIdeas of grandeur\n\nare not infrequent in other psychoses, but, in Dementia Paralytica, it is the expansiveness associated with the ideas that is so typical.\n\nDiscrimination and judgment\n\nare utterly lacking, and, consequently, the grandiosity knows no limits.\n\nThe extravagance of the delusions, and\n\nthe emotional exaltation, are so striking, that, according to Mickle,\n\n- 53 -\n\n\"....attention has been too withdrawn from other, and equally common, facts pertaining to the mental order of symptoms\". Mickle stressed that such expansiveness and exaltation were not constant, and were interrupted, even if only temporarily, by hypochondriacal ideas, childishness, peevishness, or simple dullness and stupidity.\n\nIn the\n\nmore detailed of the present day text-books, such as Henderson and Gillespie, similar descriptions are given, though in many books and articles the impression gained of the 'Expansive1 type of Dementia Paralytica is one of a delusional state, proceeding, relatively rapidly, if untreated, to dementia.\n\nSurvey of Cases\n\nI found it easier to classify my confusionals with exaltation than any of the other groups in my series of cases.\n\nThe only reason I can advance for this, is that\n\nfew doctors find it difficult to describe, in writing, the symptomatology of patients exhibiting expansive and grandiose ideas, whereas to record accurately and describe manic, melancholic, schizophrenic, or even demented cases, requires much wider psychiatric experience.\n\nThe\n\ncertificates on reception orders, usually written by\n\n- 54 -\n\nGeneral Practitioners, would bear this out, as, other than in delusional states, their certificates tend to be brief, vague, and non-committal.\n\nAs a result, a\n\ndetailed description of the mental condition of these patients was always found, and it left no doubt as to the clinical diagnosis.\n\nThe neurological and serological\n\nexaminations confirmed the diagnosis, in every case, and, those cases which ultimately came to post-mortem, proved the clinical diagnosis correct.\n\nOne observation which\n\nmay be noted from Table V (Page 157), is that, of 47 patients in the Group, only three were females, and this proportion of 16 males to 1 female is only found in one other t y p e —\n\nthe confusionals with emotional lability.\n\nIn all others the proportion of cases as between the sexes was much nearer that encountered in standard text-books, namely 1 female to 3 or 4 males.\n\nDiscussion on Cases with Confusion\n\nSuch then are the three sub-divisions of the confusional group of cases.\n\nI believe that I have\n\ndemonstrated that such types occur, and that such a division is a useful prognostic indicator,\n\nFor instance,\n\n- 55 -\n\nthose cases with Confusion and Emotional lability have a much poorer prospect of survival than the other types of confusion\n\n-\n\nonly three out' of fourteen showed any\n\nbenefit from treatment, i.e. only 21%.\n\nThe patients,\n\nwith Confusion and Exaltation as predominant features, showed the best response to treatment\n\n-\n\n16 out of 47,\n\nor 36%, showing some arrest in the disease process.\n\nWith\n\nrestlessness as the main accompaniment of confusion, 37 out of 116, or 32$, gained some benefit from treatment. It should be stressed, however, that in all cases one could generally speak only in terms of ’Hospital1 recovery, as distinct from ’Social1 recovery, and rather the arrest or slowing down of a disease process, than actual cure.\n\nThis conclusion is in keeping with that\n\nadvanced many years ago by Mott, and expressed in similar terms by Tennent, Henderson and Gillespie, Weil, WorsterDrought, and many others.\n\nMott wrote,.......\n\n”The mental aspect which is usual in General Paralysis, is the presence of a dementia of a progressive character; whatever else may be present, the only constant factor is this Dementia, and any temporary improvement of it is rare\". In a previous work, in discussing syphilitic arteritis he stated,....... \"It cannot be supposed that brain tissue can be\n\n-\n\n56\n\n-\n\nregenerated when softening has taken place, nor can it he supposed that the scar tissue in diseased arteries or the atheromatous process of degenerated arteries can he influenced by drugs. It is not, however, denied that their administration may prevent progress of the disease, and thus allow other parts of the brain to take on function to some extent\". Henderson and Gillespie state that they still hesitate to speak of General Paralysis in terms of recovery. Tennent expressed a similar view and added.... \"....any claim to recovery arouses in most minds grave doubts as to the diagnosis. In many cases under review a marked degree of improvement has been noticed as a result of treatment. In estimating these results one has to take into account the findings, if any, at clinical examinations, together with the social useful­ ness of the patient\". He believed that the effect of treatment is influenced by the duration of the mental symptoms prior to treatment, by the age of the patient, and by the clinical type, of the illness.\n\nAlso that the chances of a successful\n\noutcome diminished in direct ratio to the duration of the mental symptoms prior to treatment.\n\nWorster-Drought,\n\nin discussing prognosis, writes in terms of \"Complete Remissions\" and of \"about 301 of cases recovering\", though later, in his section on the therapeutic mechanism of malaria, he states..... \"....In cases responding favourably to treatment, there is a definite recession of pathological changes in the brain, although, of course, nerve cells and fibres once destroyed cannot be replaced\"1\n\n- 57 -\n\nWeil is much more cautious..... \"The interpretation of the histological picture, following fever therapy, is extremely difficult, because one does not know the condition of the brain before treatment....... It seems, however, to be established, that the degenerative process affecting the cortical neurones is arrested. Those observers, who have described a restoration to more normal conditions, assume a regenerative ability in the neurones, that has never been demonstrated, under other conditions, in the human brain\". Cases with confusion as the main symptom-complex proceed, if untreated, fairly rapidly to dementia.\n\nIf treated,\n\nthe syphilitic infection and destructive process is arrested, but there is always some residual evidence of feeblemindedness.\n\nSuch cases then would appear to be,\n\nwith the demented group, a definite disease entity, described as Dementia Paralytica.\n\nSome of the cases\n\nclassified as Dementias, pure and simple, could, conceivably, have shown confusion, at one stage or another, before the dementia became profound.\n\nThere is\n\nno question, however, that the cases classified as ’Confusional* terminated in dementia, and at this latter stage were indistinguishable from the Demented Group.\n\nI contend, therefore, that Dementia Paralytica, or, as it is more popularly named, General Paralysis of the\n\n-\n\n58\n\n-\n\nInsane, is a disease of the cerebrum, due to the Spirochaeta Pallida, or its toxins, and evidenced clinically by a rapidly progressive dementia, which may, or may not, be preceded by a state of mental confusion associated with extreme restlessness, emotional lability, or expansive exaltation.\n\nThe question of the parts heredity and psychopathy play in the incidence of General Paralysis is one which, even to the present day, is not satifactorily answered. Though I would not go so far as Adams, who has stated that the spirochaete.... \"serves simply to liberate underlying trends, the result being not paresis, but neurasthenia, hysteria, manic-depressive, schizophrenia, paranoid state, or other fundamental reaction types, with syphilis as the precipitating agent only\",..... I do believe that in a large proportion of cases hereditary factors or constitutional deficiencies are demonstrable, and that the majority of opinion agrees that General Paralysis occurs in such subjects more frequently than in well-adgusted people of.stable stock.\n\nSavage, for example, wrote that his experience\n\n- 59 -\n\nled him to believe that Syphilis did affect the nervous system of those who by \"age, habit, or inheritance are nervously weak\".\n\nLugaro maintained that in any organism there could be hidden weaknesses which might render it more vulnerable to one morbid agent than another.\n\nMott, many years ago, stated that.... \" one would predict the development'of the disease rather from their personal history than from their family history\". The inference from this statement is that heredity plays no part in the development of Dementia Paralytica, but in the same study we read...... \"\n\nIf we regard General Paralysis as a process of premature decay of the nervous system, affecting the structures latest and most highly developed, it is not reasonable to suppose that...... syphilis can play no part in the production of this disease, ....more particularly on those......which inherit a locus minoris resistentiae\".\n\nThis view of the disease particularly exhibiting itself in individuals with some prior neuronic defect, was stressed further by Bolton, who declared that General Paralysis only occurred in those individuals with defective cortical organisation, and who, in any case, probably would have developed a primary dementia, even\n\n-\n\n60 -\n\nin the absence of syphilis,\n\nHaskins believes that, if we investigated the past life of the individual paretic, we would find a definite relationship between the individual* s make­ up and the type of reaction that he develops.\n\nThis theory, and it can be no more, may account for the relatively sma^l percentage of individuals, among those with serological evidence of neurosyphilis, who ultimately develop Dementia Paralytica.\n\nDattner\n\nstates that at least 35% of patients with syphilis show spinal fluid changes in the first two or three years following infection, but that not more than 25% will ultimately show clinical evidence of neurosyphilis, and less than 10% parenchymatous changes.\n\nThe fact remains,\n\nhowever, that in a certain small proportion of syphilitics, a particular part of the cerebral hemispheres becomes affected by a primary neuronic destruction. The part of the brain so diseased is the fronto-parietal region, and particularly what is known as the prefrontal area of the cortex.\n\nAs mentioned previously, this\n\nneuronic degeneration is illustrated, macroscopically, in all but a few of the fulminating cases, by gross\n\n- 61 -\n\nwasting of the convolutions, the wasting varying directly according to Shaw Bolton, with the amount of dementia existing in the patients.\n\nIn other words as\n\nthe destruction of the neurones by the Spirochaete, or its toxins, in the frontal lobes, proceeds, so do the mental changes become apparent.\n\nI have already mentioned\n\nBianchi's experimental production of symptoms, similar to those in the plain demented forms of General Paralysis, following the removal of the frontal cortex in monkeys.\n\nShaw Bolton, himself, goes further, in\n\nhis researches into the functions of the frontal lobes, by. relating the destruction of different parts of the cortex to the production of mental symptoms.\n\nThe\n\ndelusional state he regards as a secondary development,.... \"having as its basis a deficient power of co­ ordination of psychic processes, — (as a result of primary atrophy) — and an inability to correctly interpret, and suitably co-ordinate, present experience in the light of past.... The capacity to develop delusions is present long before accident or environment determines the particular variety .but the primary causal factor — (neuronic destruction) — progresses more rapidly than does the delusional state, and hence in some cases mild, and, in others, more marked, dementia eventually becomes evident\". This hypothesis, in other words, based on a scientific study, and, bearing in mind the rapid destruction of nerve elements, explains feasibly, not only the production\n\n1\n\n- 62 -\n\nof the dementia in General Paralysis, hut also the peculiar expansive delusions found in the disease. The confusion is attributed more to the toxic affects of the syphilis, and it varies in degree with the intensity of the toxic state.\n\nThis latter opinion receives confirmation in a report by Gordon (1941) on a group of cases with mild secondary manifestations of syphilis, who presented mental symptoms normally found in toxic-infectious psychoses.\n\nIn all the cases vigorous anti-syphilitic\n\ntreatment had a rapid and efficacious effect on both the psychic and physical aspects.\n\nVarious other more recent studies of the effects of injury, and operations, on the frontal lobes, serve to give support to my contention, that the first two groupings into which I have classified my cases, are really one and the same disease.\n\nRylander, in a\n\nfollow-up of 32 cases, in which part of the frontal lobes had been removed, summarised his findings as:1.\n\nIntellectural deterioration\n\n-\n\n21 cases\n\nI\n\n- 63 -\n\n2.\n\nDiminished inhibition of affective responses.\n\n-\n\n25 cases\n\n3-\n\nDistinct Euphoria\n\n-\n\n20 cases\n\n4.\n\nRestlessness\n\n-\n\n14 cases\n\n5.\n\nLoss of initiative\n\n-\n\n12 cases\n\nAll these symptoms form the main mental pictures in my demented and confusional Groups.\n\nFreeman, Watts, and Lyerly, give further evidence of the loss of function, consequent on the involvement of the frontal lohe.\n\nThey mention as the usual secondary\n\nresults of lohotomy, euphoria, evasion, moria, innattention, poor judgment, and....11a divorce between imagination and affect, as it concerns the individual himself11.\n\nBrain and Strauss, in discussing the exact plane of the cortical incision in Prefrontal Leucotomy, write 11if it is made too far posteriorly, the effects will:be profound, amounting in extreme cases to the Organic reaction-type psychosis and dementia11. This statement, implying as it does, that, if too much of the frontal lobes, (or thus their functions), are removed, an organic reaction-type psychosis is produced,\n\n- 64 -\n\nmust be compared with the destruction of cortical neuronic elements in the frontal cortex in General Paralysis, which is an organic reaction-type psychosis. This comparison having been made, we are at once reminded of the three main changes which Henderson and Gillespie enumerate as comprising the organic syndrome: \"(1) In the intellectual sphere there is impairment of comprehension, interference with elaboration of impressions, defects in orientation and retention, difficulty in activation of memories^ and marked fluctuation of the level of attention\". \"(2) Affective disorder in the form of emotional instability, the patient laughing or weeping, without sufficient cause, and often in an explosive way\". \"(3) Character-change in the form of conduct foreign to the patient*s natural disposition\".\n\nThese changes are illustrated in Dementia Paralytica by the symptoms occuring in the two first groups of my eases.\n\nI have already given a summary of Watson*s enumeration of histological changes in the cortex in Dementia Paralytica, (Page 33).\n\nSimilar descriptions\n\nmay be found in the works of Ogilvie, Biggart, and Weil.\n\n-\n\n65\n\n-\n\nIn all these descriptions, the changes are mentioned as being most marked in the frontal cortex.\n\nWorster-Drought mentions that the orbital surfaces of the frontal lobes are particularly affected in many cases of Dementia Paralytica.\n\nLesions of this area\n\n(Area 11), according to some authors quoted by Cobb, are followed by emotional disturbances.\n\nThis, in turn, could\n\nexplain many of the disorders of affect which are encountered in cases of General Paralysis.\n\nHaving separated and classified these cases;\n\nhaving\n\ndemonstrated the clinical, neurological, serological, and pathological findings common to them; the symptomatology to the pathology; the relevant literature;\n\nhaving correlated and having reviewed\n\nI feel that I can finally\n\ncomplete my definition of Dementia Paralytica, and incidentally, the first objective of my thesis, as followss-\n\n(1)\n\nDementia Paralytica is a disease,\n\nespecially affecting the nerve elements in the frontal areas of the cerebral cortex, due to\n\n-\n\n66 -\n\nthe action of the Spirochaeta Pallida, or its toxins, and evidenced clinically hy a rapidly progressive dementia, which may he preceded hy a state of mental cnnfusion, associated with either extreme restlessness, emotional lability, or expansive exaltation.\n\nIt is\n\nprimarily a degenerative disease of the neurones, and as such, cure is not possible, though arrest of the disease process, by treatment, can prolong life, and even permit some social rehabilitation.\n\n- 67 -\n\n(iii)\n\nCASES WITH OTHER MENTAL SYNDROMES\n\nIn arriving at my first conclusion, I have discussed the views of neuropathologists and psychiatrists, and I have attempted to demonstrate that, in the disorder known as Dementia Paralytica, the pathological changes in the brain are expressed clinically in a definite pattern.\n\nIn other words, that Dementia Paralytica,\n\nbeing a primary neurone-destroying disease, is limited clinically to a picture of a relatively rapid and progressive dementia, with, in the majority of cases, a preceding, and accompanying, confusion, possibly due more to the toxic effects of the Spiroehaete, rather than to its direct action,\n\nThat is, diffuse cortical\n\nneuronic loss will always be recognised clincially in mental states of confusion and/or dementia.\n\nIf this\n\nconclusion is accepted, one must, ipso facto, exclude other mental syndromes which are commonly classified as General Paralysis.\n\nAt first sight this would appear to\n\nbe an impossible task, because many cases have been described in the literature, with such other clinical pictures, and in which the diagnosis has been confirmed, macroscopically, at post-mortem examination.\n\nI contend,\n\nhowever, that such cases could have been, and almost certainly were, cases in which the neuronic elements were\n\n-\n\n68 -\n\nnot primarily, but secondarily, involved.\n\nI believe\n\nthat many cases, in which the original infection was in the meninges or the blood vessels, were primarily non-organic reaction type psychosis, and that, with the spread of the infection to the nerve elements of the cortex, an organic reaction-type pyschosis was ultimately superimposed.\n\nI do not deny such a course\n\nof events, nor that it could be extremely difficult in some instances to separate, on clinical grounds, cases with a primary neuronic disorder from those with a purely meningo-vascular lesion, but I do believe it is possible to do so in the majority of cases.\n\nIt has\n\nbeen stressed by succeeding authorities on neurosyphilis, that the treatment of non-parenchymatous varieties should be attended with almost universal success.\n\nIf, therefore,\n\none could, from the clinical examination and history, differentiate between primary and secondary involvement of the cerebral neurones, or prevent the latter, prognosis would likely be much more favourable.\n\nIn the following pages I shall attempt to prove that, in my series of cases, such a differentiation is is possible, and that, by a study of the literature on\n\n- 69 -\n\nthe subject, a similar conclusion can be reached.\n\n(a) Analysis of 270 Cases\n\nAmong the 539 cases, diagnosed as General Paralysis, which I have collected, 19 were not classifiable on the facts noted at the time of admission.\n\nOf the\n\nremaining 520, I have already discussed the reasons on which I consider that a diagnosis of Dementia Paralytica was justified in 250 cases.\n\nThese are the cases in the\n\nfirst two groups in my classification (b) Confusion progressing to Dementia.\n\n-\n\n(a) Dementia,\n\nThere remain\n\n270 cases, which it will be my effort to prove, should, in general, have been diagnosed as a particular Psychosis with evidence of Neurosyphilis.\n\nReference to\n\nTable V (Page 157), shows that cases fall into three main groups:(1) Manic-Depressive. (2) Schizophrenia. (3) Paranoid States. The Manic-depressives are further sub-divided as to the phase presenting at the time of admission, and on this basis, of the 115 cases in the group, 50 are classed as\n\n- 70 -\n\nMania, and 65 as Melancholia.\n\nIn the Schizophrenia\n\ngroup are 72 eases, and though some showed hebephrenic features, the bulk were catatonics.\n\n83 cases came under'\n\nthe heading of Paranoid states, (including Paraphrenia), or Delusional Insanity, and the majority of these patients expressed persecutory ideas, were evasive, and morbidly suspicious, but were well-orientated and showed no evidence of mental confusion.\n\nI should once more emphasise that the mental state for the purpose of this classification was assessed entirely from the mental state exhibited on admission. The certificate on the Reception Order, and the admitting physician1s estimation of the mental state, were thken into consideration, but the governing principle was the Medical Statement, or 1seven day notice1 termed, to the Board of Control.\n\nas it is often\n\nA diagnosis is not\n\nessential . in this statement, but frequently in my series of cases one was given.\n\nThough this made classification\n\nin these cases easier, the diagnosis, though not altered, was not accepted at its face value, but only after appraisal of the statement in detail.\n\nThis statement,\n\nduring the years applicable to my series of cases, was\n\n- 71 -\n\nalmost invariably written by the Medical Superintendent of the Hospital, the late Dr.E.F.Reeve, who was also the lecturer in Psychological Medicine to the University of Liverpool.\n\nHis certificates were clear and concise,\n\nand rarely left any doubt in one!s mind as to the mental picture.\n\nIn the following pages I shall attempt to justify my action, in separating these 270 cases from those which I have already classified as true Dementia Paralytica, and, in proposing that each would have been more accurately diagnosed as a simple psychosis with neurosyphilis.\n\n(b)\n\nMental States\n\nThese cases, as has been shown above, fall into four main diagnostic groups, which are equivalent to the usual types of mental disorders among the non*syphilitic population in mental hospitals.\n\nIt will be noticed also\n\nthat the proportion of cases in each group corresponds approximately to the frequency of such disorders in patients with no manifestations or suggestion of syphilis. The mental state was such that, with no other findings,\n\n- 72 -\n\none would not have hesitated to allocate each case to its respective group.\n\nThe manics exhibited typical\n\npsychomotor activity, flight of ideas, and an elated, unstable mood.\n\nDelusions were abundant, but fleeting,\n\nunsystematised, and illogical.\n\nSpeech was incoherent\n\nat times, but merely from inability to express rapidly enough all the ideas apparently requiring simultaneous expression.\n\nConfusion was more apparent than real, and,\n\nas is the case in ordinary mania, memory for attacks was remarkably clear.\n\nWhere confusion was more\n\nsustained the diagnosis of Mania was not made, but the case was included under Confusion with restlessness.\n\nWhere Melancholia was the diagnosis, the patients showed depression, of varying severity, with retardation. They tended to be solitary, and asocial, to look, and be, miserable and dejected, and to express ideas of guilt or unworthiness.\n\nThey showed little interest\n\nin their environment but were well orientated, and could, though with difficulty, give a coherent and reliable account of themselves.\n\nThough for the purposes of this investigation the\n\n- 73 -\n\npresenting state of Mania or Melancholia on admission to hospital is used for the purpose of diagnosis, it was not uncommon to find alternating states appearing when the patients had been resident for some time.\n\nPeriods\n\nof normality, though generally very short, were also not infrequently noted.\n\nWhen such alternating or circular\n\nstates occurred it was considered that the diagnosis of Mania-melancholia was more firmly established.\n\nSome\n\ncases of confusion with emotional '.lability presented difficulties in differentiation, but the guiding factors were always the mental confusion, and the tendency to expansiveness in the delusional content, whether of a euphoric, or depressive nature.\n\nIn other words, care\n\nwas taken, as far as possible, to include as Manicdepressives, only those cases showing no ascertainable evidence of intellectual impairment.\n\nThe criteria borne in mind in the classification of Schizophrenics were similarly, the absence of signs or suggestions of gross dementia, and the presence of apathy, negativism, impulsiveness, bizarre delusions and hallucinations, mannerisms, and flexibilitas cerea. There can be little doubt that some cases of schizophrenia\n\n- 74 -\n\nhave been included in my first two groups —\n\nthose I\n\nconsider to be true primary parenchymatous neurosyphilis —\n\nespecially the simple and hebephrenic types, but\n\nthose cases which I have classified as Schizophrenia., displayed sufficient characteristics of this psychosis for only a small error to be possible.\n\nUnder paranoid states I have grouped those cases which, according to the Board of Control1s former classification, would have been diagnosed as Unsystematised Delusional Insanity.\n\nSome cases of Paranoid\n\nSchizophrenia will probably have been included as, with a diagnosis based on findings observed within' a week of admission, errors in assessing the type of delusional state are more than possible.\n\nThe standard adopted,\n\nhowever, in classification, was the presence of suspicion, evasiveness, and even hostility, together with varying or changeable delusions, sometimes accompanied by hallucinations, and invariably with a persecutory trend. The patients were generally well orientated, could respond to questions relevantly, if somewhat reluctantly, and discuss on general topics with reasonable clarity. A diagnosis was given to 63 cases in the medical statement,\n\n- 75 -\n\nand in no case was it found necessary to alter this from the observations recorded on admission. diagnosis in 14 cases; Praecox in 13;\n\nMania was the\n\nMelancholia in 27; Dementia\n\nand Delusional Insanity in 9.\n\nFive of .■\n\nthese cases were only recognised as Neurosyphilitics, and diagnosed as General Paralysis, at post-mortem examination. Two cases had been regarded, during life, as Melancholics, and one each as Dementia Praecox, Delusional Insanity, and Mania respectively.\n\nOnly one of these five cases had\n\npresented neurological signs\n\n-\n\nloss of light reflex\n\nand all had negative blood Sigma reactions.\n\n-\n\nPost-mortem\n\nexamination of the cerebrospinal fluid, however, was carried out in four cases, and all tests were positive.\n\nCc) Neurological Examination\n\nNo neurological signs were elicited in 74, or 27$ ? of these cases under review.\n\nThis compares with 28, or\n\n11$5 of the cases which I have already dealt with, and classified as Dementia Paralytica.\n\nIn other words, 27%\n\nof the cases which presented mental symptoms on admission, which were indistinguishable from ordinary non-organic type psychoses, in addition showed no evidence, in the form of demonstrable signs, of disease of the nervous\n\n- 76 -\n\nsystem.\n\nOne is, therefore, left with the conclusion that\n\nthese 74 cases were diagnosed as General Paralytics on the presence of positive serological reactions in the\n\ni\n\ncerebrospinal fluid.\n\ni\n\nIt is much more likely, as a survey\n\nof the literature will later show us, that these cases were oases:!\n\nip\n\nof asymptomatic, or latent, neurosyphilis with a\n\nI\n\nconcurrent psychotic disorder, and, as I have contended,\n\n|\n\nnot General Paralytics.\n\n|\n\nThe incidence of the asymptomatic\n\ncases in relation to the various psychotic types is\n\nji\n\nshown in Table XII (Page 162). On examining this table,\n\n|j\n\none is struck by the difference in numbers between the\n\n1\n\ncases benefitting by treatment, indicated by discharges\n\nI\n\nand those patients remaining in hospital, as compared\n\nI\n\nwith those cases in Table XIII and XIV (Page 163), who\n\nI\n\ncomprised the remainder of the patients with no\n\njf\n\nneurological signs, and who have been classed as\n\nij\n\nDementia Paralytica.\n\nOnly 14% had not died among the\n\nDementias, whereas 51% had shown some degree of improvement, with treatment, in the other category of cases.\n\nThis,\n\nI beliefe, clearly indicates that the latter were cases of Interstitial Neurosyphilis, or latent neurosyphilis, which aUauthorities are agreed respond most favourably to antisyphilitic measures.\n\nIn other words, this observation\n\n- 77 -\n\nupholds my belief that the correct diagnosis of these cases would have been the manifest psychosis and neurosyphilis.\n\nThe remaining cases displaying obvious psychotic syndromes, showed in addition, from mild to marked, clinical evidence of disease of the central nervous system.\n\nEvidence of speech impairment was slight, and\n\nwas found in only 22 cases.\n\nAbnormality in the deep\n\nreflexes of the lower limbs was elicited in nearly twothirds of the cases, and of these, one-third\n\n30\n\nshowed absence or diminution, while the remaining 67 cases showed increased responses.\n\nThe most consistent\n\nneurological signs were, however, significant of damage to the cranial nerves,\n\n-\n\npupillary\n\nabnormalities, loss of light reflex, optic atrophy, facial tremor, and lingual tremor.\n\nCranial nerve palsies\n\nare much more frequent, as would be expected, in meningeal infections,, than in primary parenchymatous conditions, and, therefore, their common occurrence in the groups of cases under review, would at least suggest that the cause here was meningo-vascular neurosyphilis rather than parenchymatous.\n\nTables IX to XI (Pages 160\n\nand I6l) give these figures in detail.\n\n- 78 -\n\nPrimary optic atrophy is considered by most authorities as being a special variety of the tabetic process, though the aetiology of it is still obscure. A condition of Tabo-paresis is also well recognised and two varieties of this occur.\n\nThe descending type which\n\nis in reality a spread of the cerebral degenerative process to the cord5\n\nand an ascending type which results\n\nfrom an extension of the parenchymatous infection in the cord to the cerebral cortex.\n\nThe latter is the more\n\ncommon origin, and Worster-Drought is of the opinion that fully 50% of the cases of Tabes with optic dtrophy develop General Paralysis.\n\nHe also considers that a 1\n\nsmall proportion of cases show mental symptoms from.... ”a supervening attack of one or other of the phases of a manic-depressive psychosis1’.\n\nIn my present series of cases optic atrophy was found in 16 patients.\n\nA diagnosis of tabo-paresis, from\n\nassociated mental and neurological signs, was definite in 12 cases, but the other four patients who had been blihd for periods of up to four years prior to admission, showed clear-cut mental pictures of mania and melancholia.\n\nTwo\n\nrecovered from their psychotic episodes, and were eventually discharged after treatment.\n\nThe other two died\n\n- 79 -\n\nseven months after admission, following a series of seizures.\n\n(d) Post Mortem Findings\n\nAs 46% of these cases, which I am attempting to exclude from the Paretic groups, showed, with treatment, at least arrest of the disease process, I feel that the response to treatment indicates, in these cases, a form of neurosyphilis less disastrous than Dementia Paralytica.\n\nThe cases in these groups who died and\n\nwere examined post-mortem had, on the average, survived for a period of several months, and all showed cerebral wasting to some degree, though evidence of meningo-vascular involvement was also generally demonstrated. I do not consider that these cases disprove my contentions, as, though a terminal diagnosis of Parenchymatous neurosyphilis ■v*as justified, the probability of this being secondary to a Meningo-vascular infection -could by no means be discounted.\n\nThe clinical picture could be explained, and\n\nrelated to the post-mortem findings, in the following manner.\n\nDuring life the neurological and serological signs\n\nindicate the existence of a syphilitic process, and the\n\n-\n\n80 -\n\nlatter, in the first place, occurs in association with a fundamental reaction-type psychosis.\n\nLater, as the\n\nparenchyma hecomes involved, the syphilis modifies the psychotic picture, and, finally, the original psychosis is completely masked by the dementia resulting from gross secondary neuronic destruction, which is demonstrated, macroscopically, at post-mortem examination, by cortical wasting.\n\nThis secondary neuronic degeneration\n\ncan frequently be so similar to primary degeneration that differentiation, with any certainty, is impossible. Dattner no doubt had this in mind when he stated that pathologists frequently found it impossible to distinguish Meningo-vascular syphilis from General Paresis in advanced cases.\n\nProm the time of Mott*s researches to the present day, neuropathologists declare that gummata are not found in Dementia Paralytica.\n\nIn seven of my cases gummata were\n\ndiscovered on examination of the brains, and yet the findings, in other respects, were considered sufficiently typical macroscopically, to confirm a diagnosis of General Paralysis.\n\nI am inclined to accept the view that\n\nthe presence of gummata imply a diagnosis of a primary\n\n-\n\n81 -\n\ninterstitial neurosyphilis, and therefore, that these cases were not true Paretics.\n\nThough we are concerned\n\nwith only a very few cases of this type, I believe that the conclusion is another point in favour of my contention, that General Paralysis is a distinct disease entity, and that other neurosyphilitic disorders are frequently confounded with it, especially in the later stages.\n\n(e) Serological Examinations\n\nDattner, and others, have stated that there are no cerebrospinal fluid syndromes which can be considered diagnostic of any particular variety of neurosyphilis, though in conjunction with other findings, they may aid diagnosis.\n\nI have considered the mental pictures in these\n\nseveral groups of cases, and found them sufficiently atypical to propound the opinion that they are not fundamentally cases of Dementia Paralytics.\n\nI have shown\n\nthat in a large proportion of these cases the evidence, or otherwise, of neurological signs, likewise creates doubt.\n\nFinally, I have considered the findings in those\n\ncases which were examined post-mortem, and I have endeavoured to prove that a terminal similarity to General\n\n-\n\n82 -\n\nParalysis need not necessarily mean General Paralysis.. Though the view expressed by Dattner is, in essence, true, a study of the serological reactions in my serfes of cases is considered necessary.\n\nI have already dealt\n\nwith the laboratory findings, in the 2J0 cases which I consider to be examples of Dementia Paralytica, and I have shown that, where a diagnosis on proved clinical principles has been made, characteristic reactions in the cerebro-spinal fluid, can confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThe tests used throughout my cases were: (a) The Sigma Reaction. (b) The Foam Test. (c) The Ross-Jones test for Globulin. (d) The Lange Colloidal Gold Reaction. Watson, who was neuro-pathologist at Rainhill for many years, gave his reasons, in a paper, for limiting the tests to these four.\n\nThe Sigma reaction, as a diagnostic test for both neuro- and somatic syphilis, was preferred to others because it was (a) equally reliable to the Wasserman (b) was much simpler than the latter to perform\n\n- 83 -\n\n(c) \"The reaction is standard, is more definitely quantitive, and comparative results can be obtained by independent workers11.\n\nThe colloidal gold reaction, he found from experience was the most reliable, and the most delicate, of the colloidal tests.\n\nThe cell count was abandoned as a routine procedure as it did not compensate for the time and labour involved.\n\nWhen all the tests mentioned were positive he considered a reliable laboratory diagnosis could be given, and he believed, from prolonged trial, that it was better to rely upon a limited number of tests, carried out with meticulous care, than to attempt a greater number of tests, some of which might have to be hurriedly completed.\n\nThese tests were used, where indicated, in examination fo the blood and c.s.f. of all cases being reviewed in this section, and an analysis of the findings show that the foam test was positive in every case, and also that\n\n-\n\n84 -\n\nglobulin was increased.\n\nA diagnosis of neurosyphilis is,\n\ntherefore, confirmed by positive results from these tests, but, as will be demonstrated later, they do not indicate the variety of neurosyphilis.\n\nThe Colloidal\n\nGold Reaction showed a paretic curve in all but 22 cases and the blood Sigma gave a positive reading in the majority of cases.\n\nThe c.s.f. Sigma reaction was, however,\n\nnegative in 68 cases and considerably weaker than the blood Sigma in the majority of the others.\n\nThis fact,\n\nof a positive blood and a negative cerebro-spinal fluid Sigma, is found commonly in neurosyphilis, and irrespective of the test used, but the unit reading used in the Sigma, permits of greater accuracy in comparing the strengths of reactions.\n\nAs most authorities on neurosyphilis regard\n\nthis sequence of findings as indicative of meningo-vascular syphilis, I consider that the cases giving a negative Sigma reaction in the c.s.f. among my cases can definitely not be regarded as cases of General Paralysis, and that those with a weaker reaction than that in the blood should, at least, be regarded as doubtful.\n\nConsideration of the results of serological tests, m all my cases, can be summarised thus: (a) Positive serological findings are the rule in\n\n- 85 -\n\ncases presenting the clinical features of Dementia Paralytica —\n\nthat is dementia with\n\nor without confusion, and neurological signs. (b) Positive \"fluid*1 syndromes may be found in cases not conforming clinically to the above definition of Dementia Paralytica, and, in such cases, do not necessarily make the diagnosis. (c) A diagnosis of Meningo-vascular syphilis is likely to be confirmed, if the mental state is not one of Dementia and/or Confusion, when the blood gives a positive reaction and the c.s.f. a negative reaction to a diagnostic test for syphilis, in the presence of other positive \"fluid\" tests. (d) The diagnosis of the form of neuro syphilis cannot be made accurately or dogmatically on the presence of a positive reaction to any test, or group of tests, without giving detailed consideration to the mental and neurological signs and symptoms.\n\n- 86 -\n\n(f) Response to treatment.\n\nThough various treatments had been used throughout the 14 years under review, Tables XVII - XIX (Pages l6f and 166), the main treatments given were, Malaria or Pyrifer or Tryparsamide, singly, or more usually, in combination.\n\nBy far the best results were obtained\n\nwith Tryparsamide, and an intercurrent course of Malaria or Pyrifer.\n\nThe response to treatment of cases\n\npresenting mental pictures similar to fundamental reaction-type psychoses, as illustrated in my sequence of cases, is considerably better than in those which could be grouped as General Paralysis.\n\nReference to\n\nTable XIV (Page 163), proves that 51# of the former type of case showed some degree of benefit from treatment, as evidenced by those who were able to leave hospital and those in whom life had been prolonged, compared to only 14% of those admitted to be cases of Dementia Paralytica. This result is what one would anticipate, bearing in mind the respective pathologies of the conditions, and it further serves to confirm my belief that the two main divisions to which, on clinical grounds, I have allotted cases, is correct.\n\n- "
