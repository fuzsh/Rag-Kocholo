        "text": "Henry R was concerned about his wife Lily, a 43-year-old mother-of-two. She had been nursing his stepmother “which was very trying” and it had “unhinged her mind”. Mindful of the stressful domestic environment, the family sought no treatment until the situation was desperate. The stigma of certification, the pauper lunatic label, and the belief that the war was nearly over so the stress would diminish, were likely to have contributed to their decision to wait. Lily was admitted to the mental observation ward at St. John’s Road workhouse infirmary in Islington in July 1918, and from there to Colney Hatch Asylum.1 Mentally disturbed people were frequently admitted first to an observation ward, likely to be relatively close to their home compared to an asylum beyond the suburbs. However, these wards were often ill-equipped and “without means of classification of maniacal, suicidal, or mildly affected patients”.2 Interactions between staff and patients could be unhelpful: a former asylum patient who had been certified while in an observation ward recalled that the workhouse medical officer was “a gentleman and very kind”, but the head attendant was “a complete savage in every way”.3\n\nFrom observation wardto certification under the Lunacy Act 1890 was a small medico-legal step with profound implications for the patient. Once a person was certified under the Act an asylum was obliged to accept them, regardless of any underlying physical disorder causing their mental disturbance. The most experienced psychiatrists, those working in the asylum, had no part in deciding who would be admitted under their care. This was inequitable with the authority given to general hospital doctors treating physical conditions, who decided which patients to admit to their wards. The system favoured the opinions of general hospital doctors who did not want to treat disturbed patients, especially if perceived as elderly or likely to have an unfavourable prognosis. As John Keay, president of the Medico-Psychological Association (MPA), commented in 1918: “the most trifling mental abnormality is used as the pretext for sending to the asylum”.4 One neurologist proposed that every general hospital should provide wards to treat mentally disturbed patients who had underlying physical disorders, including isolation wards where quiet was not essential, to ensure that they received the most appropriate treatment.5 The existence of such wards is elusive.\n\nAttitudes of senior doctors in general hospitals contributed to increasing the proportion of older people in asylums who were regarded as senile and untreatable. By the time war broke out, over 15 per cent of asylum patients were over 60 years old, drawn from five per cent of the population of the same age group.6 Some, such as Emma Matilda L (Fig. 3.1), were admitted “in a dying condition and all [were] in a very reduced bodily condition.”7 Asylum staff were perplexed why such physically ill people were sent to their institutions rather than treated in the local general hospital.8\n\nReturning to Lily, the obligatory doctor’s certificate required for asylum admission recorded her disturbed behaviour:\n\nhighly amused with herself; when asked questions she starts quoting some simple rhyme and keeps time to the metre by shaking her head from side to side and ends with an emphatic nod and then glares at you. She is sometimes very noisy and destructive, smashing the mug she is drinking from.\n\nOn arrival at Colney Hatch the medical officer examined her and summarised:\n\nShe is suffering from mania. Is very noisy, restless and agitated – wanders about the room talking incessantly to herself, and is at times resistive to attention. She has obvious hallucinations, both visual and auditory – hears and answers the voices of imaginary persons, and describes the wonderful coloured lights which appear in the padded room at night and by their movements convey messages to her. She mistakes identities recognising strangers as old friends and is faulty in her personal habits. She is in great impaired health suffering from advanced Pulmonary Tuberculosis and is regarded as not likely to live long.9\n\nThe term mania indicated a general state of mental and physical overactivity, rather than the specific diagnosis of manic-depression (bipolar disorder).10 Lily’s mania was probably “acute delirious mania” or “acute delirium”, both terms used at the time.11 It was often rapidly fatal because it was associated with underlying severe physical illness, a relationship recognised since antiquity.12 The workhouse infirmary did not mention Lily’s tuberculosis in its handover to the asylum. They may have overlooked it or ignored it in the course of their preoccupation with her mental state. It is doubtful that Lily’s physical illness trajectory could have been reversed, but for other people with less advanced or different illnesses, treatment in a general hospital might have secured a better outcome. Lily’s transfer to an overcrowded asylum which lacked isolation facilities also jeopardised other patients who were put at risk of catching her infection. Lily died a few weeks later. Her post-mortem confirmed the diagnosis: “Both lungs riddled with tubercle with cavities of varying sizes in both lobes.”13\n\nLily’s journey from community, via the observation ward and into the asylum raises many issues about the mental disorders suffered by people admitted as pauper lunatics. This chapter seeks to explore some of them. The chapter begins by touching on the stresses of wartime life in the community, even though the Lunacy Act did not permit asylums to undertake out-patient or community work. It then focusses on mental disorders more generally, but with special reference to the patients in the public lunatic asylums: classification; research; nature and nurture hypotheses; treatment and convalescence.\n\nDuring air raids early in the war, while some people ran for their cellars, others flocked onto the streets to watch the airships illuminated by search lights and to see their shells exploding. Anticipation of further raids caused some people anxiety, nightmares, insomnia and exhaustion. There was real danger, but Freudian interpretations also circulated, relating to the airships’ phallic shape.14\n\nMedical historians interested in the First World War have tended to focus on shell shock or the population’s physical health, as reflected in national agendas at that time.15 Concerning civilian mental health, there is little historical research about it, in contrast to much appertaining to it during the Second World War. Historical analysis about the latter provides some clues about issues likely to have been present in the earlier war, such as civilian morale, responses to threats of air raids and the presentation of symptoms. Edgar Jones and colleagues in their Second World War study, found that predictions of mass air raid neurosis failed to materialize: civilians proved more resilient than planners had predicted, largely because they had underestimated public adaptability and resourcefulness.16 Hazel Croft, in a study of civilian neuroses also in the Second World War noted that wartime camaraderie, full employment, active roles in civil defence and war work may have assisted wellbeing. Reluctance to admit to mental symptoms which could be seen as personal failings, the incentive to be an ideal, stoical citizen, and that many people would not have taken their worries as a health matter to their family doctor, may have both concealed the true amount of mental disturbance and kept the sufferer away from mental institutions.17 Croft’s and Jones’ analyses cannot be directly extrapolated backwards to the First World War, but they provide some possible explanations in support of the data which point to relatively few civilians being admitted to asylums due to unmanageable mental stress.\n\nOf a random sample of 49 First World War civilian admissions to Colney Hatch, Claybury, Hanwell and Napsbury,18stress, worry, fright and fear relating to daily life in London were identified as presumed causes in five. On the one hand, this may be an under-estimate because attributing causes was an in-exact science and asylum records were incomplete. On the other hand, of these five, possibly three whose conditions were initially attributed to stress had other disorders to explain their symptoms. Lily was one. James N was another who was subsequently diagnosed with general paralysis of the insane (GPI, brain syphilis). He is discussed later in this chapter. Arabella M (Fig. 3.2), a 53-year-old housewife, was admitted to Colney Hatch, with mental distress attributed to “Worry and Zeppelin fright”, but her case records also suggest overlap with physical illness.19\n\nThe figures do not suggest that the asylum population in the London area was overwhelmed with psychologically distressed patients. In contrast, in a study of the Denbigh Asylum serving north Wales, Pamela Michael identified 19 per cent of admissions in 1918 associated with “war worry”.20 Fear of raids in Wales may have caused more mental disturbance than for Londoners who developed strategies to deal with them. Similarly, as Harry Bernstein, born in 1910 and growing up almost 200 miles from London in Stockport, Cheshire, wrote: “The German zeppelins were bombing London and fear hung over us constantly.”21\n\nThreats other than bombs also created stress. Some people developed anxiety and depression fearful of the consequences for their loved ones fighting in the trenches or devastated by their deaths. For some women, keeping intensely busy was another way of coping, including making the most of new opportunities to work outside the home.22 For others changes in roles and employment, and consequent financial difficulties, were traumatic. For Louise F (Fig. 3.3), a single 34-year-old Turkish “enemy alien”, a financial crisis precipitated her admission to Claybury. Louise had worked in England for 12 years, but in 1917 she was unemployed, her status making work hard to find. She sold her belongings to support herself. Almost destitute, when the coal merchant failed to deliver her coal, she smashed his shop window in despair and anger. The magistrate sentenced her to a week in Brixton Prison from where she was released to the workhouse. There, she was distressed and refused to eat, and was certified for asylum admission. Six months later, she was discharged fully recovered via a Mental After Care Association convalescent house.23 The asylum had provided care and time for her to recover from her ordeal. She returned to work as a nurse and dress designer.24\n\nUndoubtedly some people were admitted to asylums suffering directly from the effects of war time stress, but given the limited data collected during the war by the asylums’ Board of Control (“the Board”), the patchiness of case notes, plus inaccuracies in specifying the causes of mental symptom and other factors affecting bed occupancy, it would be imprudent to estimate the number of asylum patients admitted directly and solely due to the stresses of war. Overall, asylum case notes suggest that they were admitted infrequently, and, as for Louise F, those whose symptoms were really due to stresses in civilian life, they improved and were discharged. This contrasts with the many admitted with life threatening or incurable mental and physical disorders.\n\nConcerning the healthcare of sick people in England, psychiatrist Adolph Meyer, looking on from the USA, commented:\n\nOne comes closest to the truth about English medicine in saying that it’s conceived as the art of healing, to which science is subordinated. Practical matters receive priority everywhere.25\n\nDoctors were trained as apprentices to treat patients to the best of their ability guided by their professional ethics, with hypotheses less important. In asylum practice, the Lunacy Act undermined the tradition of medical empiricism, of helping people when they needed help. It introduced conflict for doctors between providing timely treatment when the sufferer sought it or needed it or might benefit from it, and delays because certification was only possible with more severe symptoms. Clinical records reveal patients’ disabling psychiatric symptoms and the suffering of those admitted to the asylums. Sarah F’s tortured expression indicated her anguish (Fig. 3.4).26 She, and others unwell due to mental disorders, required compassion and help in the broadest sense, regardless of theories and legalities.\n\nMeyer’s observation fits with Tracy Loughran’s argument that “British doctors were self-consciously proud of the empiricism of their medical tradition”, in contrast to the “French and German taste for abstract theorisation.”27 Nevertheless, British psychiatrists were active in debates on some philosophical questions, such as the nature of insanity. There was no accepted single definition; all were unsatisfactory, vague and subjective with their value debated and with unclear dividing lines between normal, abnormal and eccentricity.28 The Lunacy Act was unhelpful, stating that “‘Lunatic’ means an idiot or person of unsound mind”.29 Psychiatrist Charles Mercier wrote on the difficulties of defining insanity:\n\nNo doubt we all have a certain vague notion in our minds, but the fact that we cannot put the notion into words shows that the notion is but vague and cloudy, sadly lacking in precision and definiteness.\n\nWith his own characteristic eccentricity and boldness, lack of clarity did not stop him declaring that his own equally vague definition of insanity, an all-encompassing disorder of mind and conduct, was the best.30 John Turner, medical superintendent of the Essex County Asylum at Brentwood, aimed for more precision and defined a “certifiable lunatic” as “one whose conduct (owing to disease) is persistently out of harmony with his environment, and who is, or may become, a source of harm to himself or a danger or annoyance to the community.”31 It too was inadequate, raising questions about the meaning of psychiatric “disease” and introducing social factors which could vary across place and time. Another physician, Edward Younger, advised that a doctor giving evidence in a law court should refuse to define insanity.32 The difficulty of defining it was also a concern outside the medical profession. Earl Russell, perhaps influenced by personal experience, his own behaviours from time to time being on the fringes of public acceptability, commented in the House of Lords in 1914 that “whether a person is sane or insane is one of the most difficult matters that doctors have to decide, the dividing line being so fine”.33\n\nNot only was the overall definition of insanity inadequate, but classifying the array of different disorders within it was likewise problematic. Disease classification was founded on the system of the biological sciences. Meaningful categories depended upon whether symptoms were consistent across time and culture: if they had a biological basis they would exist in the same form in different places and times. This bore out the need to identify the form of symptoms, rather than their culture-bound content which varied across time and place, influenced by contemporary cultural issues and belief systems.34Classification was challenging for psychiatric symptoms which often lacked a clear underlying physical pathology, but identifying the type of disorder was important as each type would be expected to behave in a characteristic way with regard to causes, prognoses and treatments. Without clear physical pathology, psychiatric classification was (and is) based on clinicans’ expertise in psychopathology, influenced by social and cultural expectations of disease and normality.35 A degree of subjectivity was inevitable. Recognising these uncertainties could also contribute to public fear of wrongful confinement due to inaccurate medical assessments.36\n\nClassification of psychiatric disorders was not just of interest in England, but was under consideration in Germany. Many psychiatrists outside Germany desired to emulate Emil Kraepelin’s “clinic”, but responses to his psychiatric classification varied.37Meyer initially welcomed Kraepelin’s diagnostic classification, particularly concerning manic-depression and dementia praecox (later known as schizophrenia), as the break-through which psychiatry was waiting for, but he later criticised it for being too neurological and failing to take into account the context of the patient’s life story.38Mercier accused his colleagues of following “Continental fashion”39and Havelock Ellis, a physician, better known for his studies on sexuality, acknowledged the snags of psychiatric classification generally and Kraepelin’s classification in particular:\n\nIt is impossible to consider the miscellaneous cases brought together by Kraepelin under the heading of manic-depressive insanity as a single disease….We learn nothing by placing a case in a “natural classification” which has no existence, and can have no existence, in the sense understood by Kraepelin.40\n\nThe war may have influenced negativity towards German psychiatric research. Near the end of the war, president of the American Medico-Psychological Association, James Anglin, described his colleagues as “infatuated with German pseudo-discoveries”. Subjectivity associated with personal anguish may have clouded his views, mentioning in that lecture, the death of his eldest son at Vimy Ridge, his second a “permanent cripple”, a third still fighting, and another preparing to travel to war.41\n\nDuring the First World War and through to today, uncertainties in knowledge and understanding reflect different and evolving psychiatric classification systems and a thirst to find meaning, order and clinical guidance. In the context of many divergent views, the Board classified mental disorders based on their presumed causes, in the hope that it could reveal information useful for prevention and treatment.42 Regarding causation, psychiatrist Bernard Hollander drew attention to the importance of environmental and social factors, Mercier emphasised concepts drawn from understandings about physical illness, while others favouredinherited risks.43 A search for causes fitted with the belief that mental disease originated beyond skull and brain, in line with recent discoveries of invisible causes of physical disease identified through studies of physiology, pathology and bacteriology.44 This was also compatible with observations that physical and mental disturbances overlapped, as in Lily’s case, and that they had common causes, despite mechanisms remaining obscure.45 These overlaps encouraged the practice of carrying out post-mortems on almost all asylum patients (discussed further in Chapter 7): if causes could not be determined during life, it was appropriate to search for them after death. Biological explanations also had other advantages, such as the potential to avoid blaming patients for their own mental problems and reducing punitive responses to their otherwise inexplicable behaviours. The colloquialism “pull yourself together” was known by the mid-nineteenth century,46 indicating that the speaker believed that a mentally disturbed person could immediately revert to normal. That was no truer for severe mental than physical illness: as Dr. Montagu Lomax advised in his critique of war time psychiatric practice: “it is as rational to punish a mental patient for refractory behaviour as it would be to punish a typhoid fever case for a rise in temperature.”47\n\nFor each patient admitted, the Board pragmatically sought to record “predisposing” and “exciting” factors which could occur alone or in combination. These fitted with the need to disentangle multiple theories of causation, but as indicated for Lily R, Arabella M and James N, attributing causation was prone to inaccuracies. Before the war, from 1907 to 1911, the Board identified the main causes of admission to be alcohol, prolongedmental stress, “insane heredity”, senility, GPIand epilepsy, with some gender variation for each (Table 3.1).48 Pre-war data is the best available because the Board discontinued its multi-page tabular compilations of causation as part of reducing the administrative workload during the war. Of note, very few people were admitted with so-called “moral insanity”, a subject which has entered recent public discourse through early twenty-first century novels depicting women incarcerated for no other reason than having given birth to an illegitimate child.49 There is little evidence that unmarried mothers were admitted to asylums in the war years unless they also had mental symptoms, or they fell under the rules of the Mental Deficiency Act (MDA) 1913. The MDA, but not the Lunacy Act, obliged authorities to admit to an institution a woman known to be mentally defective “who is in receipt of poor law relief at the time of giving birth to an illegitimate child, or when pregnant of such child”.50 Objectives of this rule included preventing further pregnancies and preserving the woman’s health and the ratepayers’ pockets. Punishment was not integral to the plan, on the assumption that the pregnancies resulted from vulnerable women being exploited by men. The women tended to be admitted to mental deficiency institutions, lunatic asylums being considered inappropriate for their long-term detention.\n\nDespite treatment implications derived from classifications based on symptoms or causation, they had little part in informing the organisation of asylums. Asylums adopted patient classifications based on “conduct, habits and bodily states” to place patients into “infirmary”, “quiet”, or “troublesome” wards.51 These categories often had little to do with the individual’s treatment or prognosis, but were convenient for the asylum. Some new patients were placed on wards appropriate to their needs, but others, such as some who were very disturbed, could be placed on wards with the most difficult to manage long-stay patients who had different disorders and therapeutic needs.52 If the acutely disturbed new patient settled while on a ward of mainly long-stay patients suffering persistent behavioural symptoms, he could be overlooked relative to those who demanded more attention. Alternatively, if a new patient saw that difficult behaviours attracted staff attention, this could accentuate his disturbances, which could bring about the assumption that he had a similar chronic disorder. Either way, the new patient would be disadvantaged. The outspoken psychiatrist Lionel Weatherly criticised the combination of inadequate classification together with overcrowding.53 The worst scenario, according to Nurse Jane Dagg who gave evidence to the post-war Cobb Inquiry, was overcrowding with no classification, as in the asylum where she had worked.54 Little attention was paid to the merits of clinically focussed classifications or the understanding that acute disorders were more likely to improve than chronic. According to Weatherly, and to Herbert Ellis, a magistrate and asylum management “visiting” committee member, the way patients were classified in asylums was influenced by short term financial considerations.55\n\n“Scientific” classification of mental disorders was an aid to undertaking meaningful research, and its haphazard utilisation may have been one factor contributing to Hugh Freeman’s analysis that British psychiatrists produced relatively little of importance from their research.56 Despite this, the Journal of Mental Science (JMS),57published by the Medico-Psychological Association (MPA), brought together much research from home and abroad, pointing to diverse concerns and priorities, including a tendency for researchers to grapple with somatic, bodily processes thought to be associated with mental disorders, rather than the mental disorders themselves. Reports in the JMS on “vaccinetherapeutics”, dysentery, enteric fever (typhoid) and inflammation, read more like a journal of microbiology, rather than psychiatry.58 Alongside the JMS, the Lancet, published for a broad medical readership, indicated other psychiatric preoccupations, including shell shock, lunacy legislation,59sedative medication60 and “sexual perversion”.61 Weighing up the multiplicity of often contradictory research findings was far from straight forward, itself a demonstration of the lack of a secure scientific knowledge-base for clinical, policy and administrative decision making. Randomised controlled trials were not yet established in medical research, and together with embryonic statistical methodology, these factors often made conclusions hard to draw. George Savage commented that new discoveries challenged earlier certainties: “we must ‘wait and see’; that we are prepared to follow truth where it leads, and that a dim light is better than none in such darkness as the realms of life and consciousness.”62\n\nAnother factor contributing to the paucity of psychiatric research in England was the lack of an academic backbone for psychiatry, in contrast to the world-leaders in the field in German speaking countries.63 Also, in contrast to the trend in much of western Europe, English-speaking countries separated the medical specialties of psychiatry (brain: mainly mental and behavioural manifestations) and neurology (brain: mainly bodily manifestations), despite much clinical overlap. British neurology became a discipline with high prestige and impressive clinical and scientific standards, in contrast to psychiatry. Many neurologists worked in private practice and had time for research. Most lacked experience of, or clinical responsibility for, patients in asylums although their research was pertinent to them. Neurologist John Hughlings Jackson, for example, researched epilepsy, yet he was unlikely to look after people with the severest forms of the disorder who frequently resided in asylums. In contrast to neurological research, little took place in asylums which were cut off, geographically and intellectually, at a distance from teaching hospitals and universities, and with their staff submerged by heavy workloads.\n\nDespite lack of participation in research, as the content of the JMS indicated, psychiatrists sought answers to many of the problems faced in their clinical work. In 1912, almost every asylum authority in England and Wales sent delegates to a conference in London to discuss improving research into mental diseases. The conference stressed the importance of government funding for research (as provided in Germany) and informed the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer of that.64 Just before war broke out, the Board and MPA planned further discussions on taking research forward.65 Later in 1914, the Treasury granted the Board £1500 to spend on research.66 This was a pitiful proportion of the overall government medical research budget of £58,000.67 The many applications for funding suggested interest in undertaking psychiatric research but limited expertise to carry it out.68 Around the beginning of the war, the JMS and the Board reported on progress made in research from the asylums, including on the perennial enigmas of asylum dysentery, biological markers of insanities, and the relationship between insanity and mental deficiency.69Research on mental disorders was challenging, but financial priorities may have contributed to John Keay’s frustration: “Why should insanity be left behind when so much forward endeavour is made in general medicine?”.70\n\nMost psychiatric research ceased during the war but a fresh clinical challenge loomed at its end: to unravel the new, disabling condition of encephalitis lethargica, later immortalised in Oliver Sacks’ Awakenings71 and Harold Pinter’s A Kind of Alaska.72 Despite an early consensus that the disorder resulted from the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic, evaluating the evidence was tricky and the hypothesis was gradually replaced by scepticism.73\n\nResearch guided by the desire to identify physical causes of mental disorders had direct relevance to the welfare of patients in the asylums. General paralysis of the insane (GPI) provides an illustration of this. GPI could be difficult to diagnose from the patient’s history and mental state examination, hardly surprising given that its symptoms were multiple and variable. The Wassermann blood test introduced in 1907 helped, but could give false positives. In 1913, Noguchiidentified the spirochaete treponema pallidum, a bacterium, in the cerebro-spinal fluid surrounding the brain, thus verifying that syphilis caused GPI. Cautious psychiatrists in England, however, remained wary of both the Wassermann test, which moved slowly and erratically into asylum use,74 and of Noguchi’s evidence, acknowledging in 1918 that the spirochaete “probably” caused GPI.75\n\nSome patients with GPI were women but most were men, often described as “powerful, hearty men, who had lived hard and never ailed…had ‘burnt the candle at both ends,’ and had led irregular if not debauched lives”.76 Syphilis was acquired sexually, but the spirochaete could spread to many body organs. When in the brain, its array of symptoms often included delusions of grandeur, which could result in financial ruin for a family.77Salvarsan, an arsenic-based drug, could cure bodily syphilis78 but had no effect on the spirochaetes once they had entered the brain.79Some men so feared developing GPI that, after an “indiscretion with a woman”, they developed another psychiatric disorder—syphilophobia—which could “drift into insanity” or lead to suicide.80\n\nGPI was inevitably fatal: disinhibited behaviour, restlessness, seizures and difficulty swallowing food were associated with an undignified asylum death, such for Emma Sarah M who gave birth at Claybury in November 1914 while suffering from seizures caused by the disorder. Her baby survived, and, aware of the stigma derived from insanity, the asylum arranged a birth certificate which did not state the place of birth.81 James N, a more typical patient with GPI, was a single, 34-year-old clothing factory machinist,82 admitted to Colney Hatch. He was described as suffering from stress, and was sullen, melancholic, and restless. He refused food, likely associated with his “delusions that he is ‘full up’ to the neck and that he cannot pass his water or faeces.” He developed seizures and died shortly after admission.83\n\nGiven the progressive and fatal nature of GPI, finding effective treatment was essential, even if the treatment itself had risks. During the war, Julius Wagner-Jauregg in Vienna, inoculated patients with malaria parasites to induce high fevers to kill the heat-sensitive spirochetes. He published his findings in 1919.84Malaria treatment was dangerous, but until penicillin became available nearly three decades later, it was the only hope. Malaria treatment, alongside other clinical innovations, received a characteristically cautious reception from psychiatrists in England. Drastic treatments in psychiatry were appearing around the same time as risky interventions for other fatal disorders. William Halstead, for example, introduced the “radical” mastectomy for breast cancer, in the belief that cure was more likely with ever wider surgical resection.85\n\nCaution and scepticism about innovative clinical methods was a double-edged sword. On the one hand it could prevent harm by avoiding insufficiently proven new methods, and on the other, it could cause harm by rejecting new and effective procedures. In contrast to the conservative approach of psychiatrists in England, and in the context of multiple hypotheses about infections combined with ideas about the benefits of radical treatments, less conformist colleagues risked generating over-zealous and unregulated treatments. This happened in the USA. Henry Cotton at Trenton State Asylum instigated a programme of radical surgery for psychiatric patients, to remove various organs harbouring suspected “focal infection” which supposedly produced or perpetuated their mental disorder.86 Some of Cotton’s patients, probably coincidentally, recovered mentally after his interventions, but evaluation of the treatment neglected the overall balance between healing and harm, including death. Surgery for focal infection, however, was not confined to psychiatry. It was also used for preventing physical disorders, such as “routine” tonsillectomy in children, once commonplace but later discredited as a prophylactic public health measure.87 Despite some admiration for Cotton’s work in the UK, his regime was not replicated on this side of the Atlantic where psychiatrists were arguably less innovative and more restrained in their treatments.88\n\nEnglish psychiatrists weighed up risks in a generally risk-averse asylum culture. They took clinical risks from time to time, usually in desperation. Tube feeding, is one example, undertaken on patients usually gravely ill, likely to have severe mental illness, stupor, food refusal and dehydration, all compounding the risks of the feeding.89 English psychiatrists also adopted some fashions or fads used for treating physical illness. The Royal Society of Medicine(RSM), alongside its more traditional medical and surgical sections, had a “Section of Electrotherapeutics”, which advocated the use of X-rays and therapeutic electricity, the latter compatible with the understanding of electrical impulses in the nervous system. It also had a “Section of Balneology and Climatology” which included therapeutic bathing considered beneficial for many physical and mental disorders. Accepted but unproven, balneological therapeutic measures in asylums included prolonged warm baths for “motor excitement”, Turkish baths for “simple melancholia” and brief cold showers or baths “to overcome certain resistances in the nervous system” in stupor.90\n\nUse of electricity became an attractive therapeutic tool, acceptable to professionals and public, and of interest even to cautious asylum doctors. Shifting from simple therapeutic bathing, more risky methods evolved, such as combining bathing plus electricity in an “electric bath”.91 This was believed to stimulate stuporose patients and to help excretion of toxins in schizophrenia. Using baths specially constructed from earthenware or wood, with a large flat copper electrode covered with towelling at each end connected to a battery, the procedure was considered safe. Twenty-two-year-old Annie H reportedly benefitted from electric baths, then died suddenly after a treatment. According to the Board, procedures had been followed correctly, staff supervised the bathing and applied the correct current. At post-mortem Annie was found to have “status lymphaticus”, characterised by large thymus, thyroid and lymph glands, and bone marrow hyperplasia. The coroner concluded that her death was due to sudden paralysis of the heart due to status lymphaticus, unrelated to the bath.92\n\nBut what was status lymphaticus? Detected at post-mortem, usually after a sudden death when under medical care, its incidence increased in parallel with the use of anaesthetics. It was a convenient post-mortem diagnosis. For bereaved relatives, scientific explanations were more acceptable than “a visitation of God” in an increasingly secular society. It also provided a way for coroners to justify a verdict of death from natural causes, much to the relief of the medical profession. The existence of status lymphaticus was debated during the first half of the twentieth century, then disappeared from the medical corpus.93 In reality, it never existed. It deflected blame for medical failure onto the patient. It was a diagnostic label created to fulfil professional and social needs. In this instance, it primarily protected the medical profession. Post-mortem findings were probably extremes of normal, modified by age, and mis-interpreted as abnormal, but with credibility compounded by the ferocious search for physical aetiologies.94\n\nIn their style of pragmatic and cautious consideration, psychiatrists in England tried to fathom out which vulnerabilities predisposed to mental breakdown, and why people responded differently to similar hazards, such as infective organisms, social circumstances, alcohol, or war stresses. In their clinical practice, according to Loughran, they took a “magpie approach”, choosing apparently useful aspects of particular theories without any one predominating.95 Meyer’s work also advocated a combined biological, psychological and social (“bio-psycho-social”) approach to mental disorders, and looked beyond single issues and promoted an eclectic approach to treatment.96 There was little consensus on the relative contributionsof heredity, brain disease, infection, psycho-social, spiritual and other medical and non-medical factors to causing mental disorders. Debates on causes of mental disorder in civilian patients dovetailed with those concerning aetiology of shell shock—commotion, emotion or both—which continued throughout the war.97 Baffled by the lack of clarity on causation of mental disorders, the Ministry of Pensions asked the Board for a simple rule to help clerical staff determine pension eligibility for mentally disturbed soldiers: the Board declined to provide one.98\n\nProminent biological theories of heredityincluded “degeneration”, a downwards movement of health and wellbeing of individuals, families and society. Degeneration theories had punctuated Western philosophy, politics and religion for centuries,99 and according to George Rosen, ideas included that once degeneracy set in, “the various generations of a family went inexorably to their doom.”100BénédictMorel introduced his Dégénérescence hypothesis in the 1850s, using it to explain mental and social disturbances.101 The theory gained ground, among public, politicians, physicians and scientists including the influential psychiatrist Henry Maudsley who regarded degeneration as a threat to the prevailing culture of the British Empire and to European “civilisation”.102 As well as being founded on dubious scientific evidence, degeneration had racist and eugenic interpretations.\n\nBenjamin Seebohm Rowntree proposed an alternative causal explanation for the numerous problems experienced by working class people: poverty.103 Since poverty tended to affect whole families, it complicated differentiating between nature and nurture, intrinsic and extrinsic causes. In contrast to poverty being a primary cause, degeneration provided excuses, convenient for the elite, for failures of society. Blaming the constitution of the individual rather than intervening to alleviate poverty assuaged the consciences of the ruling classes. Degeneration theory, by its message of inevitable decline, could also discourage public interest in people in asylums whose problems were attributed to it. It added to stigma and gave a sense of hopelessness, a lost cause.\n\nDegeneration had other effects on attitudes and practices in asylums. It was a reassuring and comforting “scientific” explanation for psychiatrists who failed to cure their patients. Nevertheless, many psychiatrists were also aware that theories of degeneration or heredity did not always hold: children of insane parents did not necessarily become insane or show other predicted decline or deficits.104 Ideas of degeneration or heredity, or as Bill Bynum characterised it, a “concept of progressive hereditary degeneration”,105 did not deter psychiatrists from treating their patients labelled in this way, nor did it preclude rehabilitation, discharge or normal life events, as in the case of Dorothea S, a 33-year-old a single woman from Islington who assisted her mother Adelaide to run a boarding house before her admission to Colney Hatch.106 Discharged after 18-months, labelled as suffering from “Mental Stress. Insane Heredity”, three months later she married George M, a clerical worker, one of the residents of the boarding house.107\n\nAlthough degeneracy and hereditary labels were ignored in terms of prognosis and treatment for individuals, according to Richard Walter, in his essay “What became of the degenerate?”, eugenicists “adopted many of the claims of the devotees of degeneration.”108Eugenics encouraged the reproduction of people with “desirable” traits, and discouraged reproduction of those with “undesirable”. Eugenic proposals included sterilising the “unfit”, such as insane people.109 The war added other dimensions to the degeneration debate: if British soldiers were not degenerate, why did so many succumb to shell shock? Conversely, if they were degenerate, how did they win the war? Edward Shorter argued that degeneration theories were being discredited within psychiatry before the war,110 although in England psychiatrists had never unanimously accepted them. Daniel Pick argued that the war “put paid to the dominance of dégénérescence within psychiatry and shifted the language of debate.”111 Nevertheless, the Board received the following statement before it was put to a meeting of the Board of Guardians at Sevenoaks in Kent in 1918:\n\nThe War has taken an appalling toll on the lives of the noblest and best of our manhood, yet, today, too little or nothing is being done to safeguard the Race from the menace of the weak and dependent who constitute an ever growing financial burden on the Ratepayers, who, in themselves, are becoming yearly less able to bear the strain.112\n\nThe Board of Control stood its ground against eugenic proposals, including from psychiatrists, to sterilise insane patients, and against public opinion which surfaced advocating for it.113 The war may have undermined degeneration theories, but related ideas around eugenics continued.\n\nBiological and degeneration theories had the potential to profoundly affect the wellbeing of patients, but over-enthusiasm in that direction was tempered by the conservative culture of the medical profession and ideas on causes and treatment of mental disturbance arising from new mind-focussed disciplines. Concepts of psychology, psychoanalysis, and suggestive therapies were expounded by new professional groupings.114 Some psychiatrists, such as Bernard Hart, medical superintendent of a private asylum and lecturer at University College Hospital, London, advocated for their methods as integral to the practice of psychiatry.115Lomax also recommended a psychological approach, such as placating and reasoning with patients to modify their behaviours.116 At a basic level of psycho-social treatment, asylum staff were meant to demonstrate exemplary conduct to help correct patients’ behavioural disturbances. While some staff used psychological skills acquired from experience, such as to diffuse a difficult ward situation, more widespread use of psychological methods would require more, and better trained, staff.117\n\nPsychoanalysis gave new perspectives on causes and treatment of mental distress. It became better known in England concurrent with the war. Sigmund Freud’s theories were translated into English by Ernest Jones, his disciple in England.118Carl Jung’s British followers began promoting his views, arguing that his more optimistic and less sexually oriented conception of the unconscious was preferable to Freud’s. However, mid-war, the JMS gave an airing to French zoologist Yves Delage who likened Freud’s theories to an army or infectious disorder:\n\nThis new affection, which threatens to invade France, had its birth in Austria, at Vienna, some twenty years ago. Its progress, at first very slow, soon became rapid, and the spread of the evil generally now knows no pause.…it would be imprudent to allow ourselves to be lulled to sleep under a delusive sense of security.119\n\nMercieralso ridiculed Freud’s theories of sexual excess, repressed complexes and infantile sexual longings, and asserted: “I do not hold that there is only one cause of mental disease. If I did so hold, I should be little better than a psycho-analyst.”120 Some doctors found psychoanalytic theories meaningful in their private work and when working with shell-shocked patients, such as WHR Rivers whose broadly psychological approach included catharsis, re-education, faith and suggestion.121 However, as with much of psychiatric practice, clinicians used different methods. Lewis Yealland, for example, in contrast to Rivers, advocated a “disciplinary” and physical approach to shell shock and administered electric shocks.122 More widely, psychoanalytic concepts and methods gained popularity mainly among the educated lay public.123 Psychological and psychotherapeutic processes were far-removed from asylum practices even though they fitted with ideals of practice recommended by psychiatrists, that treatment for insanity must be humane and “individual”.124\n\nWithin the asylums, despite psychiatric recommendations for treatment to be individual and commenced as early as possible, just as for physical illnesses,125 achieving this was beyond imagination. With the country’s military needs taking precedence asylums were short staffed, losing the precious commodity of staff time to build therapeutic relationships and use their existing psychological skills to manage the most difficult, and potentially dangerous, patients. Lomax wrote: “To crowd lunatics into asylums is worse than useless unless we have some recognized principles of treating them when once we have got them there”.126 At the Cobb Inquiry, one former patient said: “If a man gets better it is in spite of the treatment, not because of it”.127 Another declared that in the asylum where he was admitted “There was no mental treatment at all”.128\n\n“Moral” treatment, which emphasised achieving mental and physical well-being, emerged as an ideal way of treating psychiatric disturbance, but it was never adopted widely. It was particularly hard to implement in larger, impersonal, overcrowded and inadequately staffed asylums. The method was attributed to William Tuke, the non-medical founder of the York Retreat. Despite support from psychiatrists, Bynum argued that “Professional, social, and economic considerations coloured their own judgments and tempered the enthusiasm they showed towards moral therapy”. They were prepared to adopt features of it into their own therapeutic programmes, but not to jettison their medical models.129 Alongside medical models and some practices inspired by moral treatment, asylums used many other approaches including careful attention and watchfulness, dealing with “dirty habits” (incontinence), and preventing physical injury or suicide, or death due to “maniacal exhaustion, an ending which is looked upon in asylums as being something of an opprobrium to those who have had charge of the case”.130\n\nCurative medications were generally unavailable for psychiatric and physical disorders. The psycho-pharmacopoeia was limited. Iron, quinine, arsenic, and strychnine were used as tonics.131 A range of sedatives were available, with lack of consensus on whether to use them, which ones, and at what dosage.132 Suggested drug treatments were often accompanied by warnings of their limited usefulness and toxicity.133 Relying on imported medication, which was sometimes delayed at the docks during the war,134 could have benefits and drawbacks for patients.\n\nLaxatives were an ancient remedy for mental disturbance still within the psycho-pharmacopoeia. John Haslam, an eighteenth-century physician, referred to laxatives as “cathartics”, the cleansing process of catharsis referring to purging bowels or mind.135 They were also used to sedate, in the sense that profuse diarrhoea would temporarily weaken a patient, rendering him less liable to aggressive outbursts. Some doctors prescribed tiny doses of the laxative croton oil, up to 1 minim, the volume of a single drop of water, for constipation in patients who would not, or could not, cooperate with taking medication.136 However, the tiny volume also made croton oil liable to misuse, easy for staff to dispense on a whim or conceal in food or drink. Weatherlyand Lomax alleged that potent laxatives, particularly croton oil, were given punitively without the dose being documented.137The Cobb Inquiry investigated this allegation. It obtained records of purchases of croton oil at several asylums during 1919. Prestwich, where Lomas had worked, purchased around 6500 minims, compared to 480 minims at Colney Hatch and none at other asylums.138 Although drug purchases depended upon how much the asylum had in stock, this was unlikely to account for the enormous differences. Neither could asylum size nor different types of illness or symptoms account for it, adding weight to the suspicion that some asylums used croton oil to punish, exhaust and sedate. Punitive practices may have been deliberately malicious, but could also have reflected lack of training and a despairing staff body who could not cope with the demands placed upon them (see Chapter 4).\n\nLomax agreed with psychiatrist William Stoddart that hefty sedation was “a refined substitute for hitting [the patient] on the head with a club.”139 Another term for using medication to calm disturbed behaviour was “chemical restraint”, with controlling effects comparable to “manual restraint” which required person to person contact or “mechanical restraint” which required equipment. Manual and chemical methods were usually initiated by ward staff in response to a crisis. These methods were not formally monitored but there were guidelines to ensure safety of both parties: “A violent patient must be overcome by weight of numbers and never by blows or any such form of retaliation” wrote Stoddart.140 However, unregulated and transitory, chemical and manual restraint could be secretive, abusive and punitive, and manual restraint could cause severe injuries (see Chapter 8).\n\nBy the war, early forms of mechanical restraint such as chains and shackles had been replaced by devices usually of cloth or leather, such as straitjackets and strong dresses made of very thick material and fastened at the back with sleeves which could be tied to the patient’s torso. Jane Hamlett and Lesley Hoskins, in their study of asylum clothing, explained that restraint in a strong dress was “theoretically, a means of management and a treatment rather than a punishment but it did mark out ‘difficult’ patients and was certainly open to overuse or abuse by ward staff.”141 Mechanical restraint could be applied for prolonged periods and was known to be used punitively, hence it was monitored by the Board under the Lunacy Act.142 A senior staff member needed to authorise the procedure, to document the reasons for using it and the duration of use.143 Another method of control was seclusion, with reasons for monitoring similar to those for mechanical restraint. Lomax and Stoddart disapproved of restraint and seclusion generally, and instead advocated taking a disturbed patient out of doors to calm down, giving him a football,144 or “turning him into the garden by himself and keeping him there till his aggressiveness has blown over”.145 Restraint and seclusion methods were commonplace during the war, as they were less labour intensive for staff than finding out the cause of a patient’s restlessness, or providing social or psychological calming alternatives.146\n\nSome asylums used either mechanical restraintor seclusion, some both, others neither.147 Some differences in recorded usage may be accounted for by furtive completion of records.148 At Claybury, for example, medical superintendent Robert Armstrong-Jones reported to his committee that when patient Harriet R was wrapped in a wet blanket, a recognised means of mechanical restraint, “her limbs had been quite free to move, and therefore the case had not been entered in the register”,149 despite rules that the reasons for using it had to be documented rather than the outcome of doing so. Soon after this, the Board inspected Claybury and commended it for not using mechanical restraint.150 This sequence of events suggests that using methods of which the Board disapproved, encouraged deception, left the Board unaware of the extent of their use, and maintained appearances of good practice. Weatherly reflected on restraint procedures: “Whenever I see in the reports of the Commissioners the statement, “We are glad to see that there is no record of mechanical restraint,” I often wonder what substitute has been used”.151 He also wrote:\n\nNothing, to my mind, is worse than to see a suicidal patient struggling with two or three nurses or attendants, and I have often been told by such patients how much they appreciated the kindly supervised mechanical restraint that I had ordered.152\n\nPerhaps self-congratulatory, and although his opinion was contrary to the Lunacy Act and the official standpoint of the Board, others agreed with him that the type of restraint was not as important as using it humanely.153 Another method of mechanical restraint which by-passed official gaze was to sit particularly difficult patients against a wall with a heavy table pushed close in front of them, without amusement or employment, only allowing them out to use the lavatory. In this way, one attendant could observe several difficult patients. Lomax described this as a “brutalizing form of restraint”, “an inhuman device to save attendants trouble”.154 Established practices which made life easier for the staff persisted even when condemned as cruel: placing patients “behind the table” continued at Prestwich into the 1950s, according to a staff member witness speaking in an oral history interview.155\n\nSeclusion was meant to provide “time-out”, a cooling-off period for extremely disturbed people, but it could also be used punitively, resembling solitary confinement in prisons. Some seclusion rooms were padded, and many were unheated and lacked light and ventilation. Furniture was attached to the floor to prevent it being used to harm self or others. Each room generally had an observation window or peep hole in the door which was openable only from the outside.156Lomax advocated having an attendant always outside the door to avoid the patients’ “horror of loneliness and darkness which make them worse.”157 In an autobiographical account of his experience in an Australian asylum, Mr. D Davidson described his isolation in a “cell” with an “eye-hole” through which a tall man occasionally squinted at him. Davidson linked his isolation and observation to the worsening of his terrifying beliefs that he would be tortured and killed.158 Another patient, James Scott, wrote about “padded cells”, and drew one with a patient naked inside (Fig. 3.5). It is unclear whether the “hideous” sounds he referred to were the reason for, or outcome of, the seclusion:\n\nThe padded cells in an asylum are the most dreadful places imaginable; and the sounds which emanate from them, customarily, are hideous. I fervently ask the Almighty to spare me from ever again hearing such soul haunting noises, blasphemies, obscenities, cries and moans, as those which I so often heard during my four years imprisonment in the awful institution of which I am now disclosing the secrets.159\n\nDespite inadequate and harsh treatment in asylums, a proportion of patients recovered sufficiently to be discharged. However, in 1916, Weatherly reminded his readers that “the recovery-rate of mental diseases is…no higher than it was in the ‘seventies’ of the last century.”160 The annual recovery and discharge rate from lunacy institutions declined, from around 40 per cent of admissions between 1889 and 1905, to 32 per cent by 1914, and 27 per cent in 1918 (Table 3.2). In 1913, about 10,000 people were discharged, but some of them were classed as “relieved” (somewhat better) or “not improved”, rather than “recovered”. Recovery data are not straightforward, partly because the Board sometimes used the term synonymously with discharge. Data on recovery rates were also presented in two ways: as a proportion of the number of admissions in any one year and compared to the total asylum population (Table 3.2).161 The first gave a far more optimistic view than the second. These data are also difficult to interpret because numerous factors contributed to the changing discharge rates, such as admissions of more patients like Lily, with disturbed behaviour due to underlying physical illness, and bed shortages so that only the most unwell were admitted. Overcrowding and understaffing hindered staff-patient therapeutic relationships, reinforced custodial practices and minimised occupational and social treatments, all of which had the potential to affect recovery. Other less well-founded explanations for reduced recovery included that mental disorders were becoming more incurable and that clinicians were getting better at detecting insanity making them reluctant to discharge patients until all their symptoms had resolved.162 These explanations, convenient and credible to the leadership, exonerated the medical officers from failing to cure their patients while praising their expertise.\n\nAlthough discharge became increasingly unlikely with longer duration of admission,163 some discharges occurred after many years, such as for Ida D (Fig. 3.6164). Ida was a single 38-year-old cork cutter who lived with her widowed mother in Whitechapel.165 She was admitted to Colney Hatch in 1914 with a one-month history of mental disturbance. She was discharged “not improved” in 1951, 37 years later.166 This preceded Ministry of Health policies on closing institutions and developing community care, suggesting that the discharge initiative came from the asylum itself or from friends or a charity outside the institution. Contrary to stereotypical assumptions, age was no bar to discharge, either for Ida after her long admission or for Albert A in 1914 (Fig. 3.6167). Albert was a 73-year-old widowed, former horse cab driver from Stoke Newington then working as a messenger.168 He was admitted to Colney Hatch with his “first attack” of insanity attributed to alcohol and arteriosclerosis. Four months later, shortly before war broke out, he was discharged to the care of his son.169 Despite overall poor discharge rates, the stories of Ida and Albert go some way to counteracting the impression of inevitable and permanent long-term confinement, even for patients considered to have an unfavourable outlook.170\n\nAs with other aspects of psychiatric care, asylum doctors aspired to the clinical methods of their colleagues who treated patients with physical illness or injury. In this case, a period of convalescence (from Latin, con valescere, to grow strong or well) was a frequent part of medical and surgical practice to enhance recovery. The concept of convalescence was widely understood including outside medicine, such as for national and economic health; Winston Churchill used it to describe the country’s post-war recovery.171 Some asylums had convalescent wards in the main hospital, others had villas set aside in the grounds for that purpose. Unfortunately, detached villas were particularly vulnerable to being taken over for other purposes during the war, compounding the staffing and overcrowding challenges which impinged on therapeutic social interactions integral to the process of rehabilitation.\n\nConvalescence, as many other aspects of asylum life, has been criticised by social scientists and historians. Stephen Soanes summarised views of ErvingGoffman, Andrew Scull and others, that convalescence was part of a system of control, an extension of the ward system, a disciplinary mechanism, and that it “had a subordinate and perhaps deceptive place in the asylum, as classification that pointed to imminent release, but actually formed part of a primarily carceral institution.”172 This criticism ignored the imperative to discharge as many patients as possible in order to vacate beds to allow new admissions. It also failed to take into account the extraordinarily slow pace of recovery from mental breakdown, to rebuild self-confidence and self-esteem, deal with fear of relapse, and rebuild fractured social and employment relationships, hurdles recognised by some asylums which did provide convalescence.173\n\nAlongside convalescence, the asylums had the option of granting a patient up to four weeks trial leave to help identify their needs prior to full discharge, aiming to prevent “early relapses—so vexatious and dispiriting to the authority concerned”.174 Patients were described as being “on trial”, a term with ambiguous judicial connotations. Hubert Bond, a senior member of the Board, advocated that asylums should follow the Lunacy Act, which permitted them to provide a monetary allowance for each patient during leave.175 This could relieve financial stress and might help create a successful outcome. Despite these ideals, asylums varied in their approach to trial leave, from none,176 to leave plus allowance.177 Some asylums would not provide the allowance, viewing it as unnecessary, or extravagant, even though many patients had no other financial support at that time.178 During the war, austerity meant that the London County Council did not enforce the recommendation,179 despite the risk of that impeding outcome.\n\nTo promote successful discharge, Bond also encouraged “after-care”. The Mental After Care Association (MACA), was founded in 1879 by Henry Hawkins, chaplain at Colney Hatch. MACA mainly provided clothing, tools to help patients restart their trade, a place in a cottage home for convalescence, and assistance finding employment,180 tailoring its support to individual needs.181 It worked closely with local Guardians, who often had long-term knowledge about a family.182 MACA described itself as a “unique charity…doing work untouched by any other Association”,183 but it was relatively small, its resources only stretching to about 600 discharges each year, mainly in the London area.184 Bond encouraged medical superintendents to inform MACA of impending discharges, with the patients’ agreement, and MACA liaised constructively with medical superintendents, even after discharge.185\n\nBond wanted MACA to serve all patients who were likely to benefit from its support in the course of their discharge from a public asylum.186 However, there was diversity of opinion. Not all asylum committees agreed with Bond. One in Berkshire considered it inadvisable to have a dedicated “after-care committee” because\n\nwhen patients are discharged…they do not in any way wish to be considered as in need of after-care or different from their fellows.…in many cases it is obviously to their advantage, that their residence in a Mental Hospital should be forgotten.187\n\nThis opinion contradicted MACA’s experience. For example, in the employment-seeking advertisements which it placed in newspapers on the patients’ behalf, it often stated: “Has been mentally ill, now perfectly well and strong”.188 This honesty did not preclude former patients from obtaining work, although not all placements lasted, due to employer, employee, or wider social factors.189 Philanthropic donations also indicated public sympathy, rather than ostracism, towards people recovering from mental disorder, however, MACA’s focus on London does not allow judgement about generosity or attitudes elsewhere. Despite donations, without statutory support, MACA lacked the means to satisfy demand for its services. In Bond’s understanding, after-care helped prevent relapses, so was “economically worthy of generous support”190 and the Board requested funding for it in its proposals to the Reconstruction Committee in 1917.191 The evidence that after-care could benefit patients and that MACA received public support for its work, raises questions about the attitudes and understanding of those people running the asylums who opposed it.\n\nMACA was necessarily selective about whom it supported, but many of those it helped remained well.192 Recipients were generally grateful, and some reimbursed the charity all that it had spent on them.193 Some case studies are preserved in the MACA archive, but it is unclear if they form a representative sample or a successful-outcome sample. Nevertheless, they provide insights into the diverse and personal support given, and a few are therefore worthy of mention here. One, Norman B, a 36-year-old electrical engineer who worked well in the asylum engineer’s workshop during his admission, wanted to be a ship’s engineer. With some financial support from MACA, and their letters to potential employers, he got work on board a ship, and went to Ceylon (Sri Lanka).194 Another, Annie Sh, was also helped by MACA. Her asylum admission was precipitated by her husband’s marital infidelity. With MACA’s help, Annie obtained a legal separation from him, custody of their three children and 15 shillings a week to support them.195\n\nMACA also accepted a referral for George C who needed new clothes and sought work as a baker. It provided some clothing from its own store with the rest made-to-measure. It placed an advert in the Daily Chronicle: “Bakers.- Respectable young man, 20, seeks situation as assistant; experienced; good references.”196 George found a job quickly, but found the work too onerous, so left and enlisted with an infantry battalion in August 1914. Perhaps unsurprisingly, five months later he absconded, before embarking for France.197 George’s account is a reminder of the situation of many men who enlisted shortly after discharged from asylums. Later in the war, some recruiting offices requested the names of recovering patients and expected them to register for military service before leaving the institution.198 Likewise, and contrary to Board recommendations, there was a drive to recruit young men registered as mental defectives.199 Recruitment officials ignored advice from the men’s own doctors that they were unsuitable to serve,200 and a leader in the Times commented that physically fit men “were passed for service in the Army, when they were more fitted to be certified for asylums.”201 These criticisms point to Army recruitment officers paying little attention to existing understanding of mental disorders and the psychological resilience servicemen required. Such recruitment practices arguably contributed to the catastrophe of shell shock.\n\nBut, returning to George C, his story has a happy ending. He survived the war and appears to have had a satisfactory life thereafter. In 1936, 22 years after his discharge from the asylum, he sent Christmas greetings to his former MACA worker, Miss Vickers, indicating his gratitude to her.202\n\nTreating patients with mental disorder, the raison d’être of the asylum, was fraught with tensions. Understanding about mental disorders—their causes, classification, course and treatment—was subject to a mismatch between scientific evidence, opinions and practices. Psychiatrists were presented with contradictory hypotheses and information, with the significance of each difficult to evaluate. Psychiatrists in England, as a group, were at odds as to what to believe. Although they did little research, they questioned what was presented to them, from the UK and abroad. Much discussion appeared in the JMS, which was published regularly through the war. Caution and healthy scepticism and acknowledgement of the risk of harm from adopting new practices too readily, created a safety mechanism when faced with radical options. However, these collective traits were also associated with inertia, and lack of innovation when the opportunities arose for making other, constructive changes.\n\nPsychiatrists were trained, as were their medical contemporaries, to improve the lives of their patients, preferably to cure them. There was a sense of frustration that scientific advances in other medical disciplines surpassed those in their own. The overlap in symptoms between physical and mental disorders and the discovery of invisible causes of physical illnesses reinforced beliefs that mental and physical disorders had similar causes. This gave asylum doctors hope of scientific breakthroughs for the most severe forms of insanity. Lack of clinically useful discoveries, demoralising on the one hand, spurred some doctors on to persist with research, determined to achieve better for their patients. Various aspects of the lunacy system militated against this, such as geographical and intellectual isolation of asylums from teaching hospitals and universities, a lack of scientific expertise and heavy clinical responsibilities which gave no time for research. The paltry sum of money allocated for psychiatric research compared to that for physical illnesses was disproportionate to the challenge. It is arguable that heredityand degeneration hypotheses associated with negativity and inevitability about mental disorders may have deterred potential funders from sponsoring research. To achieve research-based improvements in clinical practice also required collaboration across professions and organisations—legal, medical, academic, asylum and governmental. That collaboration was absent before, during and after the war.\n\nThe Lunacy Act contributed to hindering asylum doctors from adopting patient-centred good medical practices expected of their counterparts in general hospitals. They were not allowed to offer out-patient treatment, to admit voluntary patients, or to decide who should be admitted to their beds, or at what stage of their illness. The Act did not serve the needs of many mentally unwell people. Convalescence, integral to treatment of physical illness and injury, was incorporated into some asylum regimes, but outside the asylum walls support was limited, mainly to that provided by MACA in the London area. MACA’s work supported the notion of some public sympathy towards people seeking to resume their normal lives following an asylum admission.\n\nFalling discharge rates (and high death rates; see Chapter 7) indicate declining standards in the asylums before the war. Pressures on the asylums during the war, particularly of overcrowding with a depleted staff, added to untherapeutic environments associated with more custodial care, some punitive practices, and a fall in therapeutic interventions. Overall, the impression given is of asylum practices pulled in all directions by scientific, legal, social, economic, military and other factors, sometimes floundering in uncertainty and at other times knowing what should be done but hampered by internal and external constraints.
