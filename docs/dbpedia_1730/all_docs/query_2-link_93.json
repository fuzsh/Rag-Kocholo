        "text": "(IMAGE: THE ENGLISH WORD ‘BEDLAM’ IS DERIVED FROM THE NICKNAME OF LONDON’S BETHLEHEM ROYAL HOSPITAL, ONE OF THE WORLD’S OLDEST INSANE ASYLUMS. - WILLIAM HOGARTH)\n\nThe fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual caused an outcry when it was published by the American Psychiatric Association last year. Some argued that the definitions in the new edition were so broad that 50 per cent of the population could now be diagnosed with a mental disorder. Yet, as Keri Phillips writes, a brief look at the history of mental illness shows that western ideas about its definition, symptoms, and treatment have always been debated.\n\nThe modern notion of mental disorders as diseases of the mind rather than something with a moral or religious dimension began to take shape during the 19th century. During the previous century, a handful of both private and public madhouses had confined lunatics in Britain, and elsewhere, in appalling conditions. In 1845, the Lunacy Act in Britain enshrined the rights of the mentally ill as patients who required treatment. Similar approaches in France, Germany and the United States encouraged the growth of public institutions to house the insane.\n\n‘The asylum goes from some place where people are restrained, literally restrained with shackles, to places by the 1830s and 1840s where the asylum is seen as a big family,’ says Sander Gilman, professor of psychiatry at Emory University, Atlanta. ‘People in asylums now grow their own food and the head of the asylum is seen as almost the father of the asylum. That's a big shift from the idea of un-treatability to the idea of treatability, from moral failing to behavioural change. Some of the therapies were social therapies, things like dances on the weekends. Some of therapies were shock therapies: water therapy for example, where people were wrapped in wet sheets and basically strapped into a chair.’\n\nNobody in the late '40s or early '50s would have believed that we ever could have treatments, medications for depression.\n\nPROFESSOR PHILIP MITCHELL, UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES\n\nGillman says that there were usually genuine reasons for confinement to institutions, although there were notorious cases like that of Elizabeth Packard, who was committed as insane because she would not agree with the religious beliefs of her husband.\n\n‘Most of the time people were put into asylums because of actions against people's own best interests,’ says Gillman. ‘People in the asylums for the most part were there because they were unable to work and love.’\n\n‘Some of things that they were in for today we understand as neurological diseases. The most common disease in the 19th century asylum was called general paralysis of the insane, GPI. By 1904 when we had a test for syphilis, it turned out that most of the people with GPI had a neurological deficit, they had tertiary syphilis.’\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the ideas of Sigmund Freud, an Austrian neurologist, became the catalyst for a revolution in western notions of mental illness. Freud was the founder of psychoanalysis, a set of psychological and therapeutic theories and associated techniques. Controversial at the time and criticised today as pseudoscience, Freud's ideas continue to influence our understanding of mental illness.\n\n‘Freud was one of the key people in pulling the domain of anxiety into the mental health field,’ explains David Healy, a professor of psychiatry at Bangor University. ‘Where before, all the way back for eons people had been scared, they had been fearful and maybe unduly fearful from time to time, Freud was the person who began to argue this isn't just a normal response to being alive, it can be a disorder in its own right.’\n\n‘One of the consequences is that it has led to an understanding that all mental problems are just an abnormal response to life's stresses, and all the person needs to do is to just learn how to cope with life's stresses, and if they do this they won't need physical treatments. That's an extreme point of view but it's one that a lot of people have.’\n\nHealy argues that Freud’s theories made it difficult to legitimise the idea that there are real mental illnesses that aren't simply abnormal responses to handling stress.\n\n‘It's extraordinarily important to be able to distinguish a physical illness of that sort, of which there may not be very many, from the huge range of ways in which we handle stress, at times inappropriately and at times to psychotic proportions.’\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century a drug called chlorpromazine was developed, fuelling an extraordinary explosion of new drugs including antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs as well as tranquillisers and stimulants. In one way or another, almost all the drugs now in use stem from the 1950s. These discoveries led to great expectations that the drugs would be tools to learn how the mind and the brain worked.\n\nThey were so successful at treating mental illness that it looked like it might be possible to close all the mental hospitals. By the 1960s, large asylums were considered to be terrible places and ideas about mental illness and how to treat it were about to undergo another shift, influenced by the social movements of the time.\n\n‘As part of that rethinking there were lots of new theories about what a mental illness really was, says Gillman. ‘Dr Thomas Szasz, a prominent critic of conventional psychiatry, said there is no such thing as mental illness, it's simply people trying to get a free ride, they're just acting.’\n\n‘Some people looked at mental illness in families and decided that the one defined as mentally ill was the healthy person and the family was in point of fact crazy. Some people talked about mental illness as if mental illness was a kind of societal label for people who really should be tolerated because they were eccentrics.’\n\nRead more: Dealing with anxiety disorders\n\nDeinstitutionalisation became the catchcry and across the world there were campaigns to replace asylums with smaller day hospitals and halfway houses which would allow patients to work, live normal lives and be better integrated into society.\n\nThe difficulty was that it was easier to close the big asylums than it was to create large numbers of smaller institutions. What really happened between 1960 and 1980 was that the asylums dumped their inmates onto the streets of cities. Today in the United States, Canada, Australia, Britain many of the severely mentally ill end up in prison.\n\nWhile the debate over the very existence of mental illness was going on, chlorpromazine and other new drug therapies were augmented by developments in neuroscience, the study of the nervous system.\n\n‘Nobody in the late '40s or early '50s would have believed that we ever could have treatments, medications for depression,’ says Professor Philip Mitchell from the School of Psychiatry at the University of New South Wales.\n\n‘What happened was that there was a molecule that was derived from chlorpromazine that a drug company in Europe was studying. They were used on some patients with schizophrenia in some private hospitals in Switzerland. One of the researchers decided to try it on his severely depressed patients, and much to his surprise it actually changed their behaviour. So for the first time we saw a medication actually changing depression and this was remarkable.’\n\nIt’s still not entirely clear how prescribed antidepressants work, however, and despite the optimism surrounding the early breakthroughs in understanding the brain, 40 or 50 years of research has not revealed essential differences in the brains of people with serious psychiatric disorders.\n\n‘I think that optimism was too simplistic and I think, in retrospect, naive,’ Mitchell says. ‘We thought that complex disorders like severe depression, bipolar and schizophrenia could be ascribed to simple changes in single neurone transmitters or neurochemicals. The brain has been the most difficult organ of the body to study. It's our most complex organ, and it's clearly the least accessible.’\n\n‘The pharmaceutical industry has essentially lost interest in psychiatric disorders over the last five years. Our understandings were so poor that they have retreated. It's only in the last year or so that you can see interest re-emerging that there are potential targets for new drug developments.’\n\nIn recent decades, while research into brain imaging, genetics, and molecular and cellular biology has continued to explore the idea that mental disorders are related to disturbances in brain function, debate over whether we are catching too many of life's normal experiences and behaviours in the mental illness net has continued.\n\n‘There has been a shift in views over time, and it's not necessarily clear that these shifts have always been based on progress in our understanding of the illnesses,’ says Healy. ‘They've often been based on the interests of the people who can earn a living out of treating the illness.’\n\n‘For instance, the pharmaceutical companies recently have clearly stood to gain from persuading people that there is a lot of depression and more recently a lot of bipolar disorder around the place, and the doctors who prescribe these drugs also stand to gain from seeing things that way.\n\nIt is obviously unrealistic to expect a consensus about what mental illness is and where the boundaries lie. Agreement is possible where specific causes can be identified, whether they are environmental like lead poisoning or neurological like Alzheimer's. There will continue to be debate over people who may have spectrum disorders or a mild forms of depression which allow them to function.\n\n‘We must not confuse those people with those with severe mental illnesses or severe developmental disabilities,’ cautions Sander Gillman. ‘We as a society have an obligation to provide succour, to provide asylum for people, and to provide the best possible treatment for them.’\n\n‘Yes, there are going to be expanding categories. Autism has grown in the United States greatly, ADHD has grown greatly. As a historian of mental illness, I can see that we really do create bigger categories which then, over time, self-correct. We mustn’t say that mental illness doesn't exist, nor that it's simply normal behaviour not recognised or eccentric behaviour.’\n\n‘Mental illness is illness, it's pain, it creates in people an inability for them to love and work. In this world, loving and working, having relationships with human beings and having a productive way in the world are the things that define us.’\n\nMental As: show your support and donate to mental health research today."
