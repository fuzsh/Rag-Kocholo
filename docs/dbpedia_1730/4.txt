Acta Neurol. Belg., 2011, 111, 69-71 <strong>General</strong> <strong>paresis</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>insane</strong>: a <strong>case</strong> <strong>with</strong> <strong>MR</strong> <strong>imaging</strong> Abstract We describe <strong>the</strong> <strong>case</strong> <strong>of</strong> a 36-year-old man presenting <strong>with</strong> cognitive impairment and personality change. <strong>General</strong> <strong>paresis</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>insane</strong>, <strong>the</strong> chronic cerebral parenchymatous form <strong>of</strong> neurosyphilis, was diagnosed. <strong>MR</strong>I showed <strong>the</strong> typical severe frontotemporal atrophy. Despite antibiotic treatment his mental state fur<strong>the</strong>r declined. <strong>General</strong> <strong>paresis</strong> is rare and diagnosis is difficult because <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> non-specific neuropsychiatric symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment are important. Key words: general <strong>paresis</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>insane</strong>; neurosyphilis; dementia. Introduction neurosyphilis has traditionally been divided into 4 main groups: syphilitic meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, general <strong>paresis</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>insane</strong> and tabes dorsalis (Carr, 2003). general <strong>paresis</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>insane</strong> (gPi), <strong>the</strong> chronic encephalitic form <strong>of</strong> neuro - syphilis, typically presents as progressive dementia beginning 15-20 years after <strong>the</strong> original infection (Luo et al., 2008). We report a patient <strong>with</strong> gPi who was at <strong>the</strong> time <strong>of</strong> diagnosis already in an advanced stage <strong>of</strong> this disease and failed to improve after antibiotic treatment. Case report A 36-year-old georgian bus driver consulted because <strong>of</strong> failing memory and character change. These symptoms were gradually progressive and were first noticed about 1 year before. According to his wife, he was <strong>of</strong>ten irritable and aggressive. Cognitive screening was virtually impossible because he was very hostile and not cooperative. He had a bilateral Babinski sign; somatic clinical examination was o<strong>the</strong>rwise unremarkable. A brain CT showed important global atrophy. At first, a hypo<strong>the</strong>sis <strong>of</strong> alcoholic gregory HeLsen Department <strong>of</strong> neurology, Antwerp University Hospital, edegem, Belgium dementia was made on account <strong>of</strong> a story <strong>of</strong> alcoholism although <strong>the</strong> patient had stopped drinking 2 years earlier and his mental problems seemed to be progressive. Because <strong>of</strong> this hypo<strong>the</strong>sis, no fur<strong>the</strong>r investigations were done and neurological follow-up was provided to determine if <strong>the</strong> problem was progressive after stopping alcohol abuse. About 6 months later neurosyphilis <strong>with</strong> gPi was diagnosed. Treponema pallidum RPR (rapid plasma reagin test) titer in blood was 1:32 positive and TPHA (Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay) > 1:20480 positive. HiV serology was negative. examination <strong>of</strong> cerebrospinal fluid (CsF) showed a normal cytosis <strong>of</strong> 4 leukocytes/µl and > 3 oligoclonal igg-bands. Treponema pallidum RPR in CsF was 1:2 positive and TPHA in CsF was > 1:20480 positive. Due to <strong>the</strong> significant cognitive deficit, a history <strong>of</strong> a primary syphilitic infection could not be reliably traced. On clinical re-examination we found Argyll Robertson pupils. Brain <strong>MR</strong>i at that time showed severe atrophy <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> frontal and medial temporal lobes and multiple small hyperintense le- Figs. 1A + B. — Axial FLAiR brain <strong>MR</strong>i demonstrates severe frontotemporal atrophy and small hyperintense lesions mainly in frontal lobes.
