William Phelps\n\nPO BOX 3215\n\nVernon, CT 06066\n\nHighest Praise for M. William Phelps\n\n“M.

Phelps packs wallops of delight with his skillful ability to narrate a suspenseful story.”\n\n—Harvey Rachlin\n\n“A compelling account of terror . . . the author dedicates himself to unmasking the psychopath with facts, insight and the other proven methods of journalistic leg work.”\n\n—Lowell Cauffiel\n\nIn June 2015, Phelps visited Bloomfield High School, in Bloomfield, CT. The school assigned Phelps’s book NATHAN HALE to a group of over 120 sophomores. Phelps was on hand to sign the books, give a short talk, and wish everyone a great summer.\n\n“It is such an honor for me that BHS chose this important book. Nathan Hale is CT’s state hero and his story is entirely misunderstood and even fabricated by much of what has been written about Hale in past history,” Phelps says. “It is so humbling to have BHS choose the book.”\n\nPhelps will be back in the fall at BHS to give a lecture on the book and answer questions from the students.\n\nGood friend and sometimes spiritual adviser, Sister Theresa, keeps Phelps in check, so the darkness does not ever overshadow and take the place of the light.\n\n“Sister and I go way back. She’s one of the best people I know. It’s an honor to be her friend. She has taught me so much about life, love, spirituality, and how to be a better human being.”\n\n“That Telecaster was the best guitar I ever owned. I call these my ‘Wedding Singer’ days. We were a terrible band, but it was fun. That time, the mid-eighties, seems like a blurry dream, actually. It’s funny, when you’re living within the boundaries lines of major historical moments in time, they seem mundane and commonplace—and yet, looking back, taking note of that period in American history, what was going on around us then, wow … just an incredible period.”\n\nThis photo was taken about midway to the summit of Hudson Bay Mountain in Smithers, British Columbia, Canada, by “Dark Minds” cameraman, Phelps’s good friend, Peter Heap.\n\nJust in back of where Phelps is standing is a clearing where much of the film “The Grey” was shot. The carcass of the airliner used in the film was at the base of the mountain. Phelps was there tracking the “Highway of Tears” serial killer for “Dark Minds.”\n\n“Smithers is one of the most remarkable places I have ever visited. It was as if the entire town had not been subjected to most of the frivolities of society. The people there were kinder and happier than most. We so much appreciated that. Granted, we had just spent a few days in Vancouver, so perhaps we were a little jaded, but our time in Smithers was more memorable than we could ever say. It’s funny, because Smithers was the one place on the entire trip that we were not looking all that forward to going because it is so far from the states and any major city.”"
