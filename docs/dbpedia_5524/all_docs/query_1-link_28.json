Welcome to the Wolfpack, Nico,\" one more added.\n\nLast December, in an exclusive interview with TODAY.com, Michael Phelps spoke about his brood of boys and adding a fourth.\n\n“I feel like I’m the best me, the best version of myself, when I’m present and in the moment ... And now having four little homies running around, I want to be as present and as active as I can in their life,” the athlete explained.\n\nThe Phelps are already parents to Boomer, 8, Beckett, 6, and Maverick, 4.
