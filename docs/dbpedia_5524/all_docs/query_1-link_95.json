        "text": "Nathan Alsobrook has served as Head Nordic Skiing Coach since 2007 and has led the Polar Bears to unprecedented heights since his arrival.\n\nSince Alsobrook’s return to Bowdoin in 2007, the nordic ski program has shown incredible progress, highlighted by 17 NCAA qualifiers and the program's first two All-Americans; Hannah Miller in 2017 and Renae Anderson in 2022. In the COVID-shortened 2020 nationals, Bowdoin had a school-record five competitors qualify for the NCAA Championship.\n\nA 1997 graduate of Bowdoin, Alsobrook was captain of the nordic ski team and also competed in track and cross-country. After graduating in 1997, he worked as a ski instructor at Sunday River before beginning his coaching career in 1999 as assistant to former Bowdoin head coach Marty Hall. After stops at Colby College, Pocatello Cross-Country Ski Foundation, and MSU, Alsobrook earned his first collegiate head coaching position at Whitman College, where one of his skiers earned All-American honors in 2006.\n\nAlsobrook holds a degree in English from Bowdoin and a master’s degree in Exercise Physiology from Montana State University. His thesis work focused on the role of upper body power in cross-country ski racing, an interest which continues to influence his training philosophy.\n\nThanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"
