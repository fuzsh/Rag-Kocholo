        "text": "Phelps was also excommunicated in March 1838 but apparently was reinstated later that year. (Minute Book 2, 10 Mar. 1838; Revelation, 8 July 1838–B.)\n\nThompson recorded this letter and Phelps’s June 1840 letter to JS immediately following a note dated 4 July 1840. (Note, 4 July 1840, in JS Letterbook 2, p. 154.)\n\nThe Book of Mormon related that when Christ set up his church in the Americas, “they which were baptized in the name of Jesus, were called the church of Christ.” The first name used to denote the church JS organized on 6 April 1830 was “the Church of Christ...\n\nView Glossary\n\nIn April 1839, a grand jury in Daviess County, Missouri, indicted JS and other church leaders for treason, riot, arson, burglary, and receiving stolen goods. On their way to Boone County, Missouri, where the trial was set to occur, the prisoners escaped. On 22 April 1839, they crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois, where they rejoined the main body of the Saints. (JS, “Extract, from the Private Journal of Joseph Smith Jr.,” Times and Seasons, July 1839, 1:7; JS, Journal, 22–23 Apr. 1839.)"
