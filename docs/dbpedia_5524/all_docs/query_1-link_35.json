In 1850, Daniel Phelps, 61, born in New Hampshire, and Lovisa Phelps, 52, born in Vermont, were living and farming at Milwaukee, with three children, all born in New York, Mary M., 24, Sarah L., 22, and Warren, 20.[3] In 1860, Daniel Phelps, 70, contractor, and Lovisa Phelps, 62, were living at Milwaukee with Mary W. Phelps, 35, and Sarah L. Phelps, 31, both born in New York and teachers at a private school, and a servant.[4]\n\nWill\n\nDaniel Phelps of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, made his will on 3 Apr 1857. He names his wife, Lovisa Phelps; his two daughters, Mary M. Phelps and Sarah A. Phelps; and his son, Abel Warren Phelps. His wife is named as the executor as Lovicy Phelps.[5]\n\nDeath\n\nA FindAGrave memorial says that Daniel Phelps died on 30 Jan 1861 and is buried in Seciton 19 at the Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There is a gravestone photo on the memorial, but the inscriptions cannot be read from the photo, and no other sources are cited.[6]\n\nProbate\n\nThe will of Daniel Phelps, deceased, was filed iwith the probate court of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, on 26 Feb 1861, and was admitted to probate on 21 Mar 1861.[5]\n\nResearch Note\n\nThe 1899 Phelps genealogy lists only one marriage for Daniel Phelps. It does not give the first name of his wife; her last name is given as Warner and it says that she was born at Montpelier, Vermont. It also says that they moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and it lists for them four children, James, Nathan, Sally, and Lucy, whom it says were born at Milwaukee, and for whom no birth dates are provided.[1] However, in the 1850 Census, which shows the family at Milwaukee, all three of the children listed there are recorded as being born in New York, and none of the children's names match the names given for their children in the Phelps genealogy, except possibly for a Sarah in the census and a Sally in the genealogy.[3] The death record of Abel Warren Phelps, shown in the 1850 Census as Warren Phelps, age 20, says that he was born at Fort Covington, New York, on 11 Aug 1829, the son of Daniel and Lavina Phelps.[7] The children shown in the 1850 Census are the same ones that appear in Daniel Phelps' will, made in 1857.[5] Another discrepancy is Lovisa's last name; the gravestone of Daniel and Lovicy Phelps records it as Warren, not Warner.[6] (Research Note by WikiTree contributor Stu Bloom, 22 Oct 2022)\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Oliver Seymour Phelps and A.
