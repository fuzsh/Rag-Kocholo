        "text": "I’m Nathan Crawshaw, PA-C, and I am a board-certified physician assistant who joined Phelps Health in December 2022. I see patients of all ages, and my collaborating physician is Family Medicine Physician Cory Offutt, MD. I commonly see patients for chronic illnesses, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. I also perform joint injections.\n\nSince an early age, medicine has always interested me. I remember “listening” to my dad’s heart with my toy stethoscope and gravitating towards science classes in school. Prior to becoming a PA, I served in the military and worked as a lab assistant and a phlebotomist.\n\nAs a PA, provider-patient teamwork is essential. We need to work together to manage medical conditions and to meet wellness goals. I consider myself a good listener and strive to ensure my patients are being heard.\n\nI choose to work at Phelps Health because of its esteemed reputation in the community. And working here is like coming home, as I was born and raised in Waynesville, Missouri.\n\nWhen I’m not taking care of patients, I can often be found at the gym. I also enjoy archery, target shooting, video games and spending time with my family. I have two cats, Lynx and Boo."
