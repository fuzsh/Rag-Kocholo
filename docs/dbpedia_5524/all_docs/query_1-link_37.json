        "text": "Nathan Adrian (born December 7, 1988, Bremerton, Washington, U.S.) is an American swimmer who was one of the most decorated Olympic swimmers of all time. A specialist in short-distance freestyle events, he won eight career Olympic medals—five gold, one silver, and two bronze. He also held numerous world championship titles.\n\nHe grew up in Washington, the youngest child of Cecilia Adrian, an immigrant from Hong Kong who was a school nurse, and James Adrian, a nuclear engineer born in the United States. Nathan Adrian’s older siblings were competitive swimmers, and he followed them into the sport, competing from the age of five. He developed into a standout swimmer at Bremerton High School, where he set a state record in the 200-metre freestyle during his senior year. Adrian earned a scholarship to swim at the University of California at Berkeley. In 2007, after finishing his first year in college, he decided to take a leave of absence in order to train full-time for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. He moved to Florida, where he began training with a prominent swim club founded by three-time Olympian Gary Hall, Jr.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThe Olympics Quiz\n\nOver the next year the 6-foot, 6-inch (1.98-metre), 225-pound (102-kg) Adrian saw rapid improvement in the pool. In April 2008 he had a breakout performance at the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA) short-course (25-metre) world championships, where he won the 100-metre freestyle race. He also teamed with Ryan Lochte, Bryan Lundquist, and Doug Van Wie to win the 4 × 100-metre freestyle relay, setting a new world record in the event (3 minutes, 8.44 seconds). At the U.S. Olympic trials a few months later, Adrian placed fourth in the 100-metre freestyle, which qualified him to compete in the upcoming Beijing Games. He was named to the 4 × 100-metre freestyle relay team. When that team won in Beijing, Adrian received a gold medal for having swum in the preliminaries.\n\nAt the 2009 FINA world championships Adrian won two gold medals (4 × 100-metre freestyle relay and 4 × 100-metre medley relay). Two years later he earned another world-championship gold medal in the 4 × 100-metre medley relay. Meanwhile, he returned to the University of California, where he garnered five individual National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) swimming titles before graduating with a degree in public health in 2012. Adrian competed in his second Olympics at the 2012 Games in London. There he prevailed in an epic 100-metre freestyle final. He bested the reigning world champion in the event, James Magnussen of Australia, by a mere one-hundredth of a second to capture the gold medal. Adrian also claimed a gold in the 4 × 100-metre medley relay and a silver in the 4 × 100-metre freestyle relay.\n\nAdrian collected two more world titles at the 2015 FINA world championships, winning gold medals in the 4 × 100-metre medley relay and 4 × 100-metre freestyle mixed relay. He was later named a cocaptain of the 2016 U.S. Olympic swim team. At that year’s Games in Rio de Janeiro, he won bronze medals in two individual events, the 50-metre freestyle and the 100-metre freestyle. Adrian also captured gold medals in the 4 × 100-metre freestyle relay and the 4 × 100-metre medley relay. In the latter event Adrian and teammates Michael Phelps, Ryan Murphy, and Cody Miller established an Olympic record with a time of 3 minutes, 27.95 seconds."
