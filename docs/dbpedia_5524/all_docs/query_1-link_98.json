        "text": "Former four-time Pro Bowler quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons and football analyst Matt Ryan, will join Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history who returns for a second year, in this year’s AmFam Champ Celebrity Foursome hosted by Andy North. The fourth participant will be announced next week.\n\nThe Celebrity Foursome is a fan favorite at the PGA TOUR Champions American Family Insurance Championship, which begins Friday, June 7 at University Ridge Golf Course in Madison. This year’s star-studded group will play in a 9-hole scramble on Saturday, June 8, teeing off from the 10th hole at approximately 2 p.m., following the final tournament group for the day.\n\n“We’re thrilled to have Michael back this year and welcome Matt to this year’s Celebrity Foursome with Andy,” said Nate Pokrass, tournament director. “They are not only phenomenal athletes but are committed to serving their communities through foundation and other work. We’re sure they’ll provide a spirited competition fans will enjoy and help us raise even more dollars to benefit charitable organizations.”\n\nRyan was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2008 NFL Draft, where he earned honors as the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player of the Year and four-time Pro Bowler. He also partnered with organizations such as Make-A-Wish Foundation, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and the Metro Atlanta Boys & Girls Club. After spending one season with the Indianapolis Colts in 2022, he joined CBS Sports as a football analyst. In June 2020, Ryan, along with his wife, Sarah, launched a Go Fund Me to advance the lives of Black Atlantans, personally committing $500,000 and raising an additional $800,000 through the initial campaign. They established the charitable trust that is now ATL: Advance The Lives, which works towards creating an Atlanta where every Black child has equal access to opportunities.\n\nPhelps is an avid golfer who was a fan favorite at the AmFam Champ in 2023. He’s participated in several Pro-Ams, and is widely regarded as one of the world’s greatest athletes. He holds 28 Olympic medals, including 23 gold. In 2008, he established the Michael Phelps Foundation to promote water safety, healthy living and the pursuit of dreams, especially for children. The Foundation has provided learn-to-swim, healthy living (emotional and physical), and goal-setting programming to more than 250,000 children and young adults around the world through strategic partnerships with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Special Olympics International and the Level Field Fund. The Michael Phelps Foundation will host its second annual fundraiser, Tee it Up, on September 23 in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nNorth, a two-time U.S. Open champion (1978, 1985) with over 600 career starts on tour, will be hosting the celebrity foursome event for the eighth time. North is a Madison native and recognized for his extensive philanthropic work in the community. His Andy North & Friends events have raised millions for cancer research.\n\nA friendly team challenge will have North and the player to be announced competing against Phelps and Ryan. The winning team will have a donation of $25,000 made in their names to the American Family Children’s Hospital.\n\nTournament ticket information\n\nTickets for the American Family Insurance Championship are available for purchase at www.amfamchampionship.com.
