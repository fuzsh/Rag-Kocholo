        "text": "Nathan Earwood\n\nNathan has represented individuals accused of criminal offenses ranging from minor speeding tickets to capital murder since 2003. Although the consequences and strategies differ in each case, his approach remains the same. In order for the client-lawyer relationship to be successful, there must actually be a relationship. It must be a relationship where the client feels comfortable and confident that their lawyer truly cares about their case. Secondly, there is no substitute for preparation. There is no consistent way for an attorney to reach the best possible result unless he takes the time and steps necessary to be fully prepared in each and every case. Finally, an attorney must be open to negotiating, but willing and able to aggressively litigate for his client. Nathan uses this approach to reach the best possible result for his clients. Nathan is a native of Western North Carolina and a graduate of Western Carolina University. He earned his law degree from Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia. While in law school, he was chosen to intern with the 30th District Attorney’s Office as well as one of Virginia Beach’s largest and most respected criminal defense firms. Upon graduation, he moved back home and for nine years worked with Melrose, Seago & Lay, P.A., where he was a partner for five years. After meeting attorney David Moore and recognizing similar commitment to client values, Earwood and Moore, P.A. was opened with a vision of being known for knowledgeable, well-prepared, and aggressive client representation. Over the next five years, the firm grew aggressively to five lawyers and three offices. In 2017, Nathan, in an effort to have a firm entirely committed to providing reliable and quality criminal defense representation, Nathan branched off to form the Law Office of Nathan Earwood. Nathan doesn’t dabble in criminal defense, this is all he does and he thoroughly enjoys finding solutions to difficult situations and protecting individual rights. Nathan is a skilled trial lawyer in the courtroom but has a calming and comforting demeanor in the office, where he can clearly explain the most complex legal situation with his clients. Nathan is active in his community, church, coaching youth sports, and legal organizations and has served on various boards including the Criminal Justice Partnership Program and the Salvation Army. He is a past member of the Academy of Trial Lawyers, North Carolina Bar Association, Advocates for Justice, Young Trial Lawyers Association, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and more. Nathan has represented several individuals throughout western North Carolina charged with first-degree murder and has attended the “Capital College” in Raleigh, NC. Nathan’s trial experience is second to none, having tried the most serious of cases including first-degree murder and rape. Each year, Nathan attends multiple continuing education courses devoted to innovative ways to better represent those accused of crimes. Nathan prides himself on being a “student of the law,” keeping current on the most recent Court of Appeals and Supreme Court opinions relating to his practice. Nathan has also worked on post-conviction cases throughout his career and received relief from the Court in State v. Chapman, 18 N.C. App. 378 (2007) and a new trial in State v. Webb, 197 N.C. App. 619 (2009) Nathan lives in Waynesville with his wife, the Honorable Kristina Earwood, a District Court Judge, and their two wonderful children.\n\nJake Phelps\n\nJake was born and raised just outside of Greenville, SC, and began his professional life in construction management. After moving to the Charlotte area, he focused on high-end renovations, winning local and national awards. The recession of 2008, however, would force him to rethink his future. With an amazing and supportive wife and three young kids, he went back to school full time. He earned a bachelor's degree of leadership in the public sector with honors from NC State. Then he and his family relocated to Oxford, MS, where he studied law at Ole Miss. He earned his J.D. with honors, being named to the Order of Barristers. In law school he was vice chair of the trial advocacy team and successfully competed in several national tournaments. After his first jury trial in the summer of 2013 (practicing under a mentor attorney while he was still in law school), he knew he was in the right spot professionally. He has tried cases to judge and jury across WNC since that day, both as a defense attorney and as a prosecutor. His unique life experiences and excellent education make him a great fit for someone that needs the best possible outcome. When he is not in a court room or the office you will find him enjoying time with his family or rambling about a hiking trail."
