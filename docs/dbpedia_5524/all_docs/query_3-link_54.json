        "text": "Bernice Yvonne Phelps was born November 17, 1940 to Robert and Josie Bassinger, who later married Aaron Copeland, Bernice’s beloved step-father. She was made whole in Christ on December 15, 2020 when He called her home to be with Him. Her eldest daughter, Doris Pedigo and great grandson, Ian Pedigo, were waiting there for her. Bernice will be missed by her husband, Nathan “Nate” Phelps, daughters, Toni Paveloff and Sherry Ballard, sons-in-law Mark Paveloff and Steve Pedigo, brother Jerry Don Bassinger and wife Sandra, grandchildren Ben and Holly Pedigo, Bill and Stephanie Pedigo, Brianna and Omar Vazquez, Blayne Ballard, Derek Paveloff and Morgan Paveloff, and great grandchildren Jack, Olivia, Braylon, Gavyn, and Mayson along with many church and local friends.\n\nBernice never missed a beat. To some, she was known as the Energizer Bunny, to others, she was known as Mother, and some called her Meme or Nana. No matter the name, she was the matriarch of her family and a trusted leader in her church home. She was an active member of Antioch Baptist Church, Bells for many years serving in the children, youth, and music ministries, influencing countless people for Christ. She also served at the Bells Community Center and Noah’s Ark Preschool for many years. She married her husband, Nate on November 22, 1958 and was proud of the life that she built with him after they moved with their daughters to a field of Johnson grass in Bells nearly 50 years ago. She loved her family and cared about her friends. When you came to her house, you never knew if you were going to get a cake that even the dogs wouldn’t eat, or maybe even “the look” if you were in trouble, but no matter what, she offered her love. She regularly won first place in the headless photo contest as well. Her love was returned by many and she will be deeply missed.\n\nA “come and go” visitation will be held on Sunday, December 20, 2020 at 3-5 PM at Mullican Little Funeral Home at 754 State Hwy 56 E. Bells, Texas 75414. A Private Funeral service will be held at Mullican Little Funeral Home Chapel on Monday, December 21, 2020 with Pastor Kenneth Van Horn officiating. Burial will be at Washburn Cemetery, Bells. Due to Covid-19 concerns, masks will be required at the visitation and the funeral service. Social distancing will be observed."
