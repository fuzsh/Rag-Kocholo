The feeling of emails needing to be answered? The social media comments, queries, complaints, trolls needing to be deleted perhaps? The data entry, invoicing, calendar updates, appointments?!

Hiring a Virtual Assistant guarantees this! Read on at www.circuit-assist.co.uk to find out how this life is possible by hiring a VA and taking the burden of back office responsibility off yourself. Rachel.va@circuit-assist.co.uk\n\nI've been getting many calls from the press this week asking for my opinion on the Robert DeNiro lawsuit with his personal assistant. My comment has been the same for the past 16 years of being an agent: If you are going to hire a personal assistant, there should be a detailed job description. All the cards should be laid on the table. No stone should be left unturned when it comes to discussing duties. If, by chance, things come up that are not part of the job scope, then talk about it. It's called \"personal\" assistant for a reason. The job is night-and-day different than an executive assistant who works in a corporate office, so just know that. Thumbs up👍if you think it's a good idea to have a detailed job description. 'nuff said."
