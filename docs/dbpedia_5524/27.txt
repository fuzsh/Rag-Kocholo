Nathan Phelps is a PhD student in Statistics at Western University, where he is a member of both the Wildland Fire Science Lab and the PHI Lab. Nathan has a BSc in Actuarial Science and Data Science and a MSc in Computer Science. After completing his MSc, he worked as a Research Associate in the Wildfire Analytics Lab at the University of Alberta, then joined the Financial Wellness Lab as a data engineer. He has transitioned to a part-time role in the lab during his PhD studies.
