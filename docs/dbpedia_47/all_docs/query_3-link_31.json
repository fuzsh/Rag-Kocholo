        "text": "Bark of Daphne bholua is an important non-timber forest product and makes a substantial contribution to the Nepalese economy. A precise estimate of the amount of D. bholua bark in mountain forests is possible using a biomass model. We developed an allometric bark biomass model for naturally grown D. bholua in Baglung District in the mid-hills of Nepal. The model was based on data from 101 destructively sampled D. bholua on 20 sample plots representing different growth stages (regeneration, established, and matured), site qualities, and stand densities, and we used diameter and height–diameter ratio as predictors. Among 9 functions evaluated, a simple power function showed the best fit to the data. This model described most of the variations in bark biomass with no substantial trends in the residuals. Leave-one-out cross-validation also confirmed the high precision of this model, because it described most of the variations in bark biomass with no substantial trends in the prediction errors. The model can be applied for a precise prediction of bark biomass for individuals of D. bholua with diameters and height–diameter ratios similar to those used in this study. It is site-specific, and its application should therefore be limited to sites with growth stage, site quality, stand density, and species distribution similar to those that formed the basis of this study. Further validation and verification of this model, with a larger dataset collected from sites with a wider range of these characteristics, is recommended.\n\nNon-timber Forest Products (NTFPs), an important provisioning ecosystem services, are recognized for their contribution in rural livelihoods and forest conservation. Effective management through sustainable harvesting and market driven commercialization are two contrasting aspects that are bringing challenges in development of NTFPs sector. Identifying potential species having market value, conducting value chain analyses, and sustainable management of NTFPs need analysis of their use patterns by communities and trends at a regional scale. We analyzed use patterns, trends, and challenges in traditional use and management of NTFPs in the southern slope of Kangchenjunga Landscape, Eastern Himalaya and discussed potential implications for conservation and livelihoods. A total of 739 species of NTFPs used by the local people of Kangchenjunga Landscape were reported in the reviewed literature. Of these, the highest number of NTFPs was documented from India (377 species), followed by Nepal (363) and Bhutan (245). Though the reported species were used for 24 different purposes, medicinal and edible plants were the most frequently used NTFP categories in the landscape. Medicinal plants were used in 27 major ailment categories, with the highest number of species being used for gastro-intestinal disorders. Though the Kangchenjunga Landscape harbors many potential NTFPs, trade of NTFPs was found to be nominal indicating lack of commercialization due to limited market information. We found that the unsustainable harvesting and lack of marketing were the major constraints for sustainable management of NTFPs sector in the landscape despite of promising policy provisions. We suggest sustainable harvesting practices, value addition at local level, and marketing for promotion of NTFPs in the Kangchenjunga Landscape for income generation and livelihood improvement that subsequently contributes to conservation.\n\nRhododendron arboreum Sm. is commonly used for fuelwood in mountainous regions of the Eastern Himalaya, however nothing is known about rates of extraction versus the annual increment capacity of the species in terms of biomass. In the study area, fuelwood is the major source of energy. We conducted household surveys and ecological surveys in and near two settlements to assess both fuelwood consumption and existing above ground biomass of R. arboreum. According to local residents, this species contributes 20–25% to household fuelwood requirements, while forest surveys and a survey of freshly cut stumps indicate that 15% of trees felled for fuelwood were R. arboreum. Trees were mostly young, comprised about 20% of all tree species in the forest, and accounted for 70.41 × 10^3 kg ha^−1 biomass in average. The biomass of felled trees was calculated as 8.71 × 10^3 kg ha^−1 at the time of study. Simulation based on the current rates of extraction and increment showed that the species will be in a critical condition in future at most of the monitored sites. In some places however, biomass was found to increase in spite of ongoing extraction. The results indicate that there is an urgent need of forest management which in a first step can be achieved through rotational harvesting that allows forest stands to regenerate and build up biomass. In addition, depletion of rhododendron stands can be reduced by economic development through ecotourism on the theme of rhododendrons, and by providing access to alternative sources of energy."
