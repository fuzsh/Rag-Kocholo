It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 as a part of the County Courthouses in Iowa Thematic Resource. The courthouse is the third building the county has used for court functions and county administration.\n\nJames A. Beck House(Opens in a new window)\n\nThe James A. Beck House, also known as the Sloca House, is a historic residence located in Fairfield, Iowa, United States. Beck was a Fairfield native who owned a grocery business, before starting a profitable career as a hotelier. He had this Queen Anne house built in 1896. It is based on a pattern designed by the George F. Barber & Co. of Knoxville, Tennessee. It is similar to the Linsay House in Iowa City, which was built closer to the original pattern. The 2½-story frame house follows an irregular plan and it is built on a stone foundation. It features a polygonal turret that rises from the second floor over the wrap-around porch. The porch itself features a circular pavilion that is capped by a flattened conical roof. A two-story carriage house is located behind the main house. It dates from 1875 when the previous house on this property was built, and was renovated to reflect the Queen Anne house. The Beck House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\nFairfield Public Library(Opens in a new window)\n\nFairfield Public Library is located in Fairfield, Iowa, United States. A library association was founded by a group of local men in 1853, and funded by dues from its members. It was housed in several different buildings for the first 40 years. U.S. Senator James F. Wilson from Fairfield was instrumental in obtaining a grant from Andrew Carnegie for a building of its own. The grant for $40,000 was accepted on January 15, 1892. It was the first Carnegie Library outside of Western Pennsylvania and the first of 101 built in Iowa. It was also one the few libraries Carnegie funded without stipulations concerning its use, public support, or design. The building was designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style by Kansas City architect C. Stafford. It was officially opened on Friday, September 29, 1893, and it was dedicated on November 28 of the same year. The association continued to run the library until 1899 when voters approved a referendum to support it with taxes. The building has been altered in the ensuing years, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The library moved to a new building in 1996, and the historic building is now home to the Jefferson Center of Indian Hills Community College.\n\nHenn Mansion(Opens in a new window)\n\nThe Henn Mansion, also known as Ewing Hall, is a historic building located in Fairfield, Iowa, United States. A native of New York, Bernhart Henn served two terms in the United States House of Representatives representing Iowa's 1st congressional district as a Democratic. Previously he had served as the Registrar of the U.S. Land Office. He had this two-story, brick, Greek Revival house built in 1858. However, the financial panic of 1857 almost wiped out his fortune. When he died in 1865, the house and the 40&nbsp;acre of land that surrounded it had to be sold. The house is representative of the financial success one had in the public sector in the pioneer economy. It was also the birthplace of Parsons College in 1875. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983."
