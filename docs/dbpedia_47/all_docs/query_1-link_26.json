        "text": "Nepal has witnessed high climate variability and increased extreme events in recent years and its people desperately seeking safety measures. Vulnerability assessment is prerequisite to address these problems. Increasing number of global and local initiatives taken so far to measure the risk and vulnerability are found varying according to place and institutions. A pilot study was undertaken in Nepal's Darbung village of Gorkha district, which aimed to integrate science and community knowledge in assessing the vulnerability. GIS was applied to prepare landslide susceptibility map, while community based participatory tools were used to perform vulnerability assessment. Weightage method for hazard ranking found, drought as the most hazardous event followed by landslide, flood, forest fire, wildlife encroachment, epidemic, windstorm, crop disease and thunderbolt. On the basis of six components of damage category, the vulnerability ranking found ward no. 7 as the most vulnerable one. Hazard mapping identified ward no. 7 covering highest area of landslide. Landslide susceptibility map showed ward no. 2 and ward no. 8 located in high susceptible zones. The combined approach using science and community knowledge revealed that ward no. 7 was the most vulnerable ward, and that the communities have enhanced capacity to reduce the vulnerability due to their direct involvement in vulnerability assessment.\n\nClimate change is a global phenomenon, and its implications are more critical in a mountainous country like Nepal. Moreover, nearly 80 % of annual precipitation occurs in four months (June-September). Also, Nepal contains 3,252 glaciers and 2,315 glacier lakes of various sizes above 3,500 m that are sensitive to climate change with the annual mean temperature increasing at a rate of 0.4Â°C per decade from 1975 to 2005. Similarly, the majority of meteorological stations examined from 1961 to 2006 also show an increasing trend in extreme rainfall events. On the other hand, overall forest area has decreased at an annual rate of 1.7 % in Nepal. Climate change has been found to have negative effect on the forests of Nepal. There has been loss of historic range of flagship species like tiger.Some of the widely adopted adaptation practices in the forestry sector by local communities include stall feeding, reduce number of livestock, use alternative to firewood, control fire and grazing, and improve forest management. The adaptive measure relevant to biodiversity conservation are buffer zone implementation, water holes construction, species translocation, commercial farming of medicinal plants, habitat restoration etc.Climatic alterations such as these, especially increasing temperatures, are having profound impacts on vital components of life such as forests and biodiversity, which make up the livelihoods of many people in Nepal. People living in developing countries like Nepal often depend on forests for water, food, medicine, shelter, fibers, fuel for cooking, forage for their livestock, and timber products. Losses of forested areas due to the impacts of climate change will subsequently threaten many livelihood capitals (i.e., human, social, physical, and economic capitals) of the Nepalese people. As some vegetable species such as tomatoes, millet, and wheat shift to higher elevations, local communities will lose income and will be forced to migrate.\n\nSuwal highlights damaging factors linked to the nationalization of forests in Nepal that coincided with the campaign to eradicate malaria in the Terai from the mid-1950s onwards and with the colonizing of areas of low population to increase agricultural production. As a result there was a loss of natural habitat that threatened plant and wildlife. Recognizing the danger, the government initiated programmes that established protected areas and buffer zones and community forest stewardship as self-sustaining mechanisms. Suwal argues that well-planned community engagement processes, linked to longer term local economic benefits, encouraged people to support and engage in natural heritage protection. Suwal notes the positive role NGOs, such as the World Wildlife Fund, have played in supporting community in activities such as community stewardship and eco-tourism."
