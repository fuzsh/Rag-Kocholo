It was originally started under a large Birch tree in the village main path. The first head master of the school was Mr Subha Ser Rai, who was living locally. At the beginning only 10 pupils (male) started to study at the proposed school and local people funded the salary for the teacher. Now the Nepalese government took over, but there are not enough funds available to run the school at a bare minimum standard. Until 1990 female students were not allowed to study in Shree Sahayogi Primary School. It was compulsory that they supported their family in the farm. Now this school runs for up to year five and around seventy students are currently studying.
