        "text": "The current study on the traditional use of medicinal plants was carried out from February 2018 to March 2020, in Gokand Valley, District Buner, Pakistan. The goal was to collect, interpret, and evaluate data on the application of medicinal plants. Along with comprehensive notes on individual plants species, we calculated Use Value (UV), Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC), Use Report (UR), Fidelity Level (FL), Informant Consensus Factor (FCI), as well as Family Importance Value (FIV). During the current study, a total of 109 species belonging to 64 families were reported to be used in the treatment of various ailments. It included three families (four species) of Pteridophytes, 58 families (99 species) of angiosperm, one family (three species) of Gymnosperms, and two families (three species) of fungi. The article highlights the significance of domestic consumption of plant resources to treat human ailments. The UV varied from 0.2 (Acorus calamus L.) to 0.89 (Acacia modesta Wall.). The RFC ranged from 0.059 (Acorus calamus L. and Convolvulus arvensis L.) to 0.285 (Acacia modesta Wall.). The species with 100% FL were Acacia modesta Wall. and the fungus Morchella esculenta Fr., while the FCI was documented from 0 to 0.45 for gastro-intestinal disorders. The conservation ranks of the medicinal plant species revealed that 28 plant species were vulnerable, followed by rare (25 spp.), infrequent (17 spp.), dominant (16 spp.), and 10 species endangered. The traditional use of plants needs conservation strategies and further investigation for better utilization of natural resources.\n\nThe present study documents the Traditional Botanical Knowledge (TBK) on the use of medicinal plants by the people in Sikles area (Kaski, Nepal), mainly focusing on three wards. Sikles is located to the N-E corner of Pokhara at mountain side perched on hillock and is one of the largest and most beautiful villages inhabited by Gurung along with minority of lower caste communities. The field was carried out using the semi-structured questionnaire with 45 informants (two groups i.e. below and above 40 years). The ethno medicinal TBK was also quantitatively analyzed using Relative Frequency Citation (RFC) and Use Value (UV) along with their Pearson Correlation. Our study documented 42 plants species used by the local people to cure 43 different ailments. Majority of the species are single in their respective families. The plant families with more than one medicinal plant species reported were Compositae, Ericaceae, Labiatae, Rosaceae, Urticaceae and Zingiberaceae (each with 2 species). The dominant life form of these plant species were herbs with 24 species followed by shrub (7 sp.) and trees (7 sp.). Out of total, roots of 11 sp. were dominant with maximum use against the diseases followed by leaf (8 sp.), whole plants (8 sp.) etc. The RFC and UV calculated indicate less correlation particularly with the use value of the plants and number of informants responding the use of plants. Thus to preserve TBK on use of medicinal plants, the forthcoming generations must be acquainted with species knowledge and their medicinal values.\n\nOver 80% of the world population relies on vegetation for health care; more than 30% of the entire plant species used for medicinal purposes. India displays large topography and various climatic conditions which accommodates more than 45,000 species. Uttarakhand state known as the ‘natural reservoir of India’ is in north-western Himalaya; it has 8000 vascular plants species, over 1748 of these are known for their therapeutic properties. In hilly areas of Uttarakhand, local communities still use the ethno-medicinal plants to cure various diseases and ailments. Although several researchers have conducted surveys across different areas of the Himalayan region, and to our knowledge, ethno-medicinal plants’ studies have not been conducted in Tarikhet block of Almora district, Uttarakhand. In this study, a total of 155 individuals of different age groups (20–93 years) with different socio-economic status (farmer, service man, ex-service man, businessman, housewives, students) participated. A total of 72 medicinal plant species were reported from which 31 were herbs, 20 trees, 15 shrubs, and 6 were climbers belonging to 44 families used in the treatment of various ailments. Furthermore, we recorded that local people used various plant parts i.e., leaves (35), fruit (15), root (10), whole plant (5), seed (6), bark (6) stem (4), rhizome (3) and others (4), to treat a wide range of health conditions. Thus, documenting the ethno-medicinal plants and for conservation is of the upmost important not only for cultural traditions and for biodiversity conservation. The study shows that locals have extensive ethnobotanical knowledge and are highly dependent on the forest for their livelihood. The valuable knowledge is anchored in cultural practices and orally transmitted from one generation to another; however, the loss is imminent as the new generation lacks the interest and the traditional ethnobotanical knowledge is unprotected."
