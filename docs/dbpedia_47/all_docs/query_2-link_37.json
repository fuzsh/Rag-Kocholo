        "text": "Agriculture is the main livelihood of most families in Sindhupalchowk, despite the many challenges. The hilly region means all the farmlands are terraced, making agriculture practice difficult, and one that yields comparatively little. Plowing these terraced lands by traditional means of oxen is possible but not cost-effective and physically challenging. Not everyone in the village owns an ox and when hired they can cost to up to Rs. 1,500 per day.\n\nA mini-tiller is a blessing to all farmers. It is portable, user-friendly, and apt for terrace farm lands. Under ACT – II NPL-161 project’s “Mini-tillers support for land tilling” activity, ISARD facilitated the distribution of three mini-tillers to three farmers group. The farmers group is responsible for the maintenance of the tiller, who uses it, and for how much. The money is saved, available for when the tiller needs its regular maintenance, fuel or when they need to buy another tiller.\n\nFor Kalpana Tamang, a young mother, the tiller is a means to self-dependency and empowerment. With her husband on abroad employment in Malaysia for the past 2.5 years, Tamang is solely responsible to take care of her household, her 2 year old daughter, and 6 ropanis land. Via Patle Krishak Samuha (Farmers’ Group) in Patle, Dhuskun – 5, she recently had access to using a mini-tiller.\n\nIn a country where plowing the field is considered a man’s job, Tamang would never have previously thought of literally taking things into her own hands. Usually, she would hire external help and a pair of oxen to plow the land. It would take 4 days to get the land ready, and would cost her Rs. 6,000 in total. A mini-tiller means Tamang is breaking an age old taboo in her field. And while she is empowered, she is also saving time and money. With access to a mini-tiller she can plow the field in almost half the time and in less than half the money.\n\nJyoti Nepal from Dhuskun – 3, Sindhupalchowk is a poultry farmer who has been in this business since 2070 B.S. She has been happily raising chickens and tells that this business has benefited her regarding income and lifestyle. Jyoti Nepal has been actively involved in poultry farming until a massive earthquake hit Nepal on April 25th 2015. Due to that earthquake she suffered a huge loss. From total number of 500 chickens, who were ready to sell in the market she was able to rescue only 125 of them.\n\nBut ambitious Jyoti Nepal didn’t panic and the earthquake could not stop her. After few months with the help of ISARD, she again continued her poultry farming by buying another 500 baby chicks. She collected some money by selling those remaining chickens and also ISARD supported her by giving NPR 60,000 (around $600). Not only she bought chickens Jyoti Nepal also reconstructed shelter for them and now the chickens have grown up and almost ready to go to the market."
