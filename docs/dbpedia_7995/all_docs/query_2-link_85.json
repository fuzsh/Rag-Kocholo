Anton Ratushnyi is the name of a 19-year-old who recently won the NPC title and earned the right to compete among professionals.\n\nWriting about his success, the media state that he went through the transformation from an average-looking teenager to the musculature that brings him victories in competitions in four years.\n\nSchwarzenegger started lifting weights as a 15-year-old, and at the age of 20 he won the title on the way to becoming, for many, the best bodybuilder of all time.\n\nFor Ratushnyi, the competition for the title of Mr. Olympia, the same one that Schwarzenegger won seven times. He should face five-time champion Chris Bamstedt there."
