His closest rival, Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, was on 32.4%.\n\nThe Austrian-born film star and former body builder - who made his name in action films such as The Terminator and Total Recall - galvanised the campaign when he announced he would be running on talk show host Jay Leno's television show earlier this year.\n\nLarge crowds have gathered to see him at campaign speeches and rallies.\n\nBut the political fight has been brutal at times, with Mr Schwarzenegger accused of sexually harassing a number of women, and allegations that he once praised Hitler.\n\nHe has denied the allegations, although he made an apology for \"rowdy behaviour\" on film sets.\n\nIn Context\n\nThe final result was 55.4% in favour of a recall, with 44.6% opposing it.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger won a decisive victory with 48.7% support, 16% ahead of his nearest rival.\n\nHe was sworn in as Governor of California on 17 November 2003.\n\nHis first act was to abolish an unpopular car tax rise imposed by Governor Davis. He also formally ruled out tax rises - one of the big question marks overhanging his campaign.\n\nLater policies, however, have caused controversy.\n\nIn February 2004 he ordered his top legal official to act against the city of San Francisco for allowing gay marriages in defiance of state law, saying they represented \"an imminent risk to civil order\".\n\nAfter weeks of wrangling with senators, Governor Schwarzenegger secured a last-ditch agreement on California's $103bn (£56bn) budget in July 2004.\n\nThe budget neither raised taxes, nor cut spending too deeply, instead committing the state to borrowing heavily to keep its finances on track.\n\nSome economists have warned the policy only postpones - and could exacerbate - the state's economic problems.\n\nSearch ON THIS DAY by date\n\nFront Page | Years | Themes | Witness ^^ Back to top | ©"
