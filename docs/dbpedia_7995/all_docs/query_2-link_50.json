        "text": "The Arnold Sports Festival is known worldwide for its bodybuilding and strength competitions, but the four-day event draws more than just onlookers there to see ripped and shredded bodies.\n\nThough many will flock to the Greater Columbus Convention Center for the festival’s centerpiece, the Arnold Classic, as well as the weightlifting and Strongman/Strongwoman events, you needn’t be a fan of those exhibitions to attend. There’s an array of other attractions — including pillow-fighting (seriously) — to captivate all comers.\n\n\"I think the Arnold appeals to a wide variety of people because it features a wide variety of competitions and events — not only bodybuilding and weightlifting, but events like cheerleading and dance, even foosball,\" said Brent LaLonde, events director for the Arnold, which takes place Thursday through Sunday, primarily at the Greater Columbus Convention Center.\n\nArnold trivia: 3 things you didn't know about the Arnold Sports Festival\n\nHow did the Arnold Sports Festival begin?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was a bodybuilder in his early 20s when he met Jim Lorimer, then mayor of Worthington, at the 1970 Mr. World bodybuilding championship. The pair enjoyed a decades-long friendship and partnership that included founding the Arnold Classic — which eventually became the Arnold Sports Festival — in 1989.\n\nIn an Instagram post after Lorimer’s death in November 2022, Schwarzenegger referred to their “handshake agreement” to promote bodybuilding together and the Arnold’s growth “from a small bodybuilding show to a sports festival with 200,000 visitors and more athletes than the Olympics.\"\n\nLaLonde echoed Schwarzenegger’s comments.\n\n\"The event has really grown over 36 years from a bodybuilding competition into a sports festival, one of the largest multi-sport festivals in the nation,” he said.\n\nGoing to the Arnold Sports Festival?: Here's what you need to know\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger to appear Friday through Sunday\n\nNo Arnold is complete without its namesake and co-founder, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who attends the sports fest each year. Spectators will spot him here and there Friday through Sunday, as well as at 5K Pump & Run, which begins at 10:30 a.m. Sunday at the convention center.\n\nIf you want to see Schwarzenegger up-close and personal, you'll want to attend the Arnold Showcase, which begins at 9:30 a.m. Sunday in the convention center’s Battelle Grand ballroom at 9:30 a.m. Sunday. Schwarzenegger will be present for the second half of the showcase.\n\n“The Arnold Showcase brings about 2,000 people to Battelle Grand. At the showcase, (Schwarzenegger) does a Q&A and touches on all aspects of his career from bodybuilding to movies and politics,” LaLonde said. “It’s the best opportunity to see Arnold, hear him speak and ask him a question.”\n\nAnd no, LaLonde added, Schwarzenegger doesn’t mind being asked to say famous “Terminator” catchphrases like “I’ll be back” and “Hasta la vista, baby.”\n\nWhat's new at this year's festival\n\nThe Stack3d Select Pavilion is a dedicated area at the front of the Arnold Expo that will house more than 25 exhibitors offering health-and-wellness products such as sports nutrition brands, energy drinks, foods and more.\n\nCombat sports among popular Arnold Sports Festival events\n\nIn addition to the physique and lifting events, LaLonde said combat sports round out the “three pillars” of the Arnold’s biggest crowd-pleasers. This year’s combat sports include Muay Thai boxing, grappling, MMA fighting and a martial arts festival taking place Friday through Sunday at the Ohio Expo Center.\n\nAlso under the combat umbrella is medieval fighting, which LaLonde called the sports festival’s “most unique” event. In it, combatants use 14th- to 16th-century armor and weapons, competing to be the last one standing.\n\nGuns & Hoses returns to festival boxing ring\n\nArguably the most popular combat attraction is the Guns & Hoses charity boxing event, which pits local police officers and firefighters against one another other. “It always draws a sold-out crowd. It’s a fun night of boxing and raising money for their charities,” LaLonde said.\n\nThis is the ninth year for Guns & Hoses and it's also a tiebreaker year since there's a 4-4 split between police and fire, according to Franklin County Sheriff's Office Deputy Troy Speakman, event director for Guns & Hoses.\n\nDonovan Byas, who will represent the Columbus Division of Fire when he defends the heavyweight title he won last year, said he looks forward to both firefighters and police officers getting the chance to showcase talents people don't usually get to see.\n\nWhy Columbus?: Why a sports festival named after Arnold Schwarzenegger is held in Columbus every year\n\nByas, 35, signed up for his first Guns & Hoses at the suggestion of colleague Tony Cupe, a former professional fighter who also has competed in the Arnold boxing event. \"I've always been a fan of boxing — of any sports growing up, really — and I've always wanted to box myself,\" he said.\n\n\"I (went) to the Barack Rec Center as much as possible and trained with E.J. Reed, another pro fighter with the (fire) department. I'm trying as much as I can to balance it with home life and work life to get some sparring in to get ready for this event.\"\n\nByas will raise his gloves against Franklin County Sheriff's Office Deputy Joe Smith, a first-time contender. Smith said he \"jumped at the opportunity\" to take part in Guns & Hoses after being approached by Speakman.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity for police and firefighters to come out and have a little bit of competition against each other and battle it out instead of talking trash about each other all the time,\" Smith said, joking about the friendly rivalry between police and fire.\n\nThe 40-year-old officer said Guns & Hoses also is a chance for the competitors to do something aside from their \"normal\" jobs. \"It's a good opportunity for people to come out and see police and firefighters doing something for the community,\" said Smith, who has done mixed-martial arts in the past.\n\n\"It's also an opportunity to represent who you're working for in a non-professional atmosphere, to have fun and step out of the normal day-to-day routine.\"\n\nThis year's pugilistic competition will benefit the Fraternal Order of Police Foundation and the International Association of Firefighters to help police officers and firefighters injured in the line of duty, Speakman said.\n\nGymnasts to spring into action at the Arnold Sports Festival\n\nLooking for a less contact-intensive sport? Integrity Athletics of Plain City will jump back into the Arnold this year for the gymnastics competition, which brings contenders from gyms across the country to participate in trampoline and tumbling as well as women’s artistic gymnastics.\n\nIntegrity gymnast Raf Bryant has competed internationally for several years, but his next contest will be on home turf when he makes his Arnold debut. “I’ve never been before, so it’s going to be a different experience for me, something new,” the 21-year-old Worthington resident said.\n\nAs a power tumbler, Bryant will be tasked with executing difficult mid-air twists, back-to-back series of single and double flips and more. Although a newcomer to the festival, he’s an old hand at facing off against other athletes, having begun gymnastics at an age when many kids are struggling to color inside the lines.\n\nFrom foosball to 'Wheel of Pain': 5 great moments in Arnold Sports Festival history\n\n\"I’ve been competing since I was 4. I started at Buckeye Gymnastics, doing the baby program with my dad. Then one day, we were watching (other gymnasts) and my dad said, 'Raf, why don't you try that? It looks fun.’\n\n\"I joined a team when I was about 4 or 5. When I got to a level where my coaches could only take me so far, I ended up switching to Integrity. I've been there for eight years; they've helped me to develop and become an international athlete to where I am now,\" said Bryant, whose athletic career has taken him to many countries including Japan, Bulgaria, Azerbaijan and England.\n\nArnold Classic, Strongman/Strongwoman anchor festival\n\nTouting the Arnold Classic as “the marquee event of the weekend,” LaLonde said contestants’ physiques are judged on criteria including shape, size and muscularity.\n\nOf the 90 or so total bodybuilders who will participate in this year’s sports fest, 11 will be oiled up and posed for the Classic. Representing the U.K., defending champion Samson Dauda — also known as “the Nigerian Lion” — will return to compete for a second title.\n\nWhile the Arnold Classic and other bodybuilding competitions focus on appearance, other events are judged on physical strength, LaLonde noted.\n\n“In the Arnold Strongman Classic and the Arnold Strongwoman Classic, these are athletes who are judged on how much they can lift, not how they look,” he said.\n\nChallenges in the strength competitions include the elephant bar deadlift of up to 1,100 pounds and the Dinnie Stone carry of more than 700 pounds. The stones are replicas of the Dinnie Stones, a 733-pound pair of granite lifting stones in Potarch, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\n\nMore must-see events at the Arnold Sports Festival\n\nIf you're looking for the latest in sports gear, apparel and nutrition, there's a good chance you'll find it at the Arnold Expo. The fitness exposition will return to the convention center with more than 800 booths representing 300 companies and three stages of nonstop competitions and entertainment. Stop by and snag an autograph or get your photo taken with your favorite pro bodybuilder or strongman.\n\nArnold Expo hours are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday through Saturday and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday. Admission to the expo and most events at the convention center is included in the daily expo ticket. Daily tickets, fast passes that include early admission, are available at arnoldsports.com. Children 14 and younger get into the expo free with a paying adult.\n\nLaLonde said women’s bodybuilding events are increasingly popular each year at the Arnold, with events adding new divisions \"by demand every few years so more women can get onstage and compete.\"\n\nAttendees can see female bodybuilders in these competitions:\n\nFitness International: prejudging at 12:30 p.m. Friday, Arnold Expo stage; finals at 7 p.m. Friday, Battelle Grand, at the convention center\n\nWellness International: prejudging at 12:30 p.m. Friday, Arnold Expo stage; finals at 7 p.m. Friday, Battelle Grand\n\nBikini International: prejudging at 11 a.m. Saturday, Arnold Expo stage; finals at 7 p.m. Saturday, Battelle Grand\n\nHistory in photos: The Arnold through the years, from bodybuilding to speedcubing\n\nLaLonde also recommended checking out the pro wheelchair bodybuilding events The contenders include reigning champ Harold Kelley, who has won the competition every year since 2016 except in 2022, when Gabriele Andriulli (who also is returning) was the victor.\n\nPro wheelchair prejudging will begin at 10 a.m. Saturday on the Arnold Expo Stage, followed by finals.\n\n“These athletes, for whatever reasons, are confined to wheelchairs and have done incredible upper body building,” LaLonde said. “It’s very inspiring to watch them compete.”\n\nYou don’t have to go pro to take part in the Arnold, which will also feature amateur competitions:\n\nNPC Worldwide Arnold Amateur: Prejudging will begin at 8 a.m. Thursday and Friday in Battelle Grand at the convention center; finals begin 30 minutes after end of prejudging.\n\nArnold Amateur Strongman and Strongwoman: All held in the convention center, men's and women's preliminaries are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. in Hall C; finals are 9 a.m. to noon Sunday on the Rogue Strength stage and 2-4 p.m. Sunday on the Arnold Expo stage.\n\nSeveral events require individual tickets\n\nAdmission to the Arnold Expo and most events at the Greater Columbus Convention Center is included in the Daily Expo Ticket.
