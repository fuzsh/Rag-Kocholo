After welcoming four children together, the pair announced their split in May 2011 amid reports of infidelity. (Schwarzenegger eventually admitted that he fathered son Joseph Baena with the family’s former housekeeper, Mildred \"Patty\" Baena, while he was still married to the Illinois native.)\n\n“I had personal setbacks, but this was, without any doubt, the biggest setback and the biggest failure,” the former governor of California told Howard Stern on his SiriusXM radio show in June 2015. “Without any doubt. Not only failure, but you feel like, 'I'm to blame for it. It was me that screwed up.' And you can't point the finger at anyone else. So yeah, I was disappointed in it. It's always easy to be smart in hindsight. The thing was how do you make the best of that situation?”\n\nHe continued: “[Going to couple’s therapy] was the biggest mistake I've ever made. That guy was so full of s—t. He said more crap and more nonsense. It was absolutely counterproductive to our future relationship. … Maria talked me into it. I went, and I felt instinctively maybe I shouldn't go because I know I screwed up. I don't have to go through anyone to have to explain to me anything. I apologized to Maria. I apologized to the kids.”\n\n[sendtonews type=\"float\" key=\"C75rfQuQ5u-2833998-14453\"]\n\nFollowing their split, the Austria native has continued to praise his former spouse as a coparent as they jointly raised children Katherine Schwarzenegger, Christina Schwarzenegger, Patrick Schwarzenegger and Christopher Schwarzenegger.\n\n“Luckily, Maria has been a terrific mother,” the Jingle All the Way star previously told Extra in 2012. “We work together even though we’re going through a divorce. … We make sure that the kids grow up to be really good human beings.”\n\nUs Weekly confirmed in December 2021 that the pair’s divorce paperwork was finalized after 10 years.\n\n“I grew up in a very strict Catholic household, and I was raised with a judgmental God, and I don’t believe in that anymore,” Shriver previously told Access Hollywood in March 2018 about how her divorce shifted her perspective. “I believe all religion is based in love, and the less judgmental we are across our life, the better we are.”\n\nThe now-exes eventually reached a settlement in their divorce in June 2022 when Shriver was awarded half of the actor’s retirement accounts per a court filing at the time.\n\nScroll below to revisit Arnold and the Women's Alzheimer's Movement founder’s complete relationship timeline:\n\nCredit: MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger and Ex-Wife Maria Shriver's Relationship Timeline Through the Years: The Way They Were\n\nFor nearly 25 years, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver were a Hollywood and political power couple.\n\nThe Terminator star and the journalist tied the knot in April 1986, nearly nine years after they first met at a tennis tournament.

At first, felt like, ‘Oh, I better go and figure out what is the truth,” Shriver said during an appearance on Hoda Kotb’s “Making Space” podcast while reflecting on how she found her voice. “One of the things I did is [I] went to a convent, a cloistered convent. To be in silence and look for advice.”\n\nThe journalist recalled speaking to the reverent mother before she left. “She said, ‘I think you came here looking for permission,’” Shriver recalled. “She goes, ‘You can’t come live here … but you do have permission to go out and become Maria.' I was sobbing. I was like, ‘Who is that?’”\n\nIn that moment, which came after she split from Schwarzenegger, the author remembered finally giving herself “permission to start learning” who she was outside of her famous family and high-profile relationship.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock(2)\n\nMay 2023\n\nWhile discussing his Netflix series FUBAR, in which he plays a divorced spy who had an affair on his wife, Schwarzenegger told The Hollywood Reporter the show “feels like it’s a documentary.” The difference, however, is that his TV character “doesn’t consider it cheating” because his actions were pegged to his job.\n\nWhen it comes to Schwarzenegger’s real-life affair and split from Shriver, he confessed, “It was my f—kup. It was my failure.”\n\nThe Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life author insisted that he doesn’t miss being married but he admitted the divorce was “very, very difficult in the beginning.” Now, the former body builder is in a good place with his ex-wife, whom he said he still loves.\n\n“She and I are really good friends and very close, and we are very proud of the way we raised our kids,” he said of Shriver. “Even though we had this drama, we did Easter together, Mother’s Day together, the Christmases together, all birthdays — everything together.”\n\nSchwarzenegger concluded: “If there’s Oscars for how to handle divorce, Maria and I should get it for having the least amount of impact on the kids. The sweetness and kindness you see in them, that’s from my wife. The discipline and work ethic is from me.”\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nJune 2023\n\nArnold opened up about his affair in his Arnold Netflix documentary. “Maria and I went to counseling once a week. In one of the sessions, the counselor said, ‘I think today Maria wants to be very specific about something. She wants to know if you are the father of Joseph.’ And … I thought my heart stopped, and then I told the truth,” he recalled. “She was crushed because of that.”\n\nHe added: “I think that I have caused enough pain for my family because of my f–k up. Everyone had to suffer. Maria had to suffer. The kids had to suffer. Joseph. His mother. Everyone. … I am going to have to live with it the rest of my life.”\n\nAfter the release of four-part doc, a source told Us that Shriver did not plan to comment on her ex-husband’s claims.\n\n“She would like to keep what happened in the past behind her and not relive some of the challenges she faced in her marriage,” the insider said at the time. “She’s in a really good place with Arnold now and they’re able to focus on what matters most to them — their children. She doesn’t live with regrets and chooses to focus her life on positive energy and moving forward.”"
