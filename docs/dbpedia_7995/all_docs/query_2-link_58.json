The costs to be a member of a sports school were too high, so he equipped his own sports room in the basement of his parent's home. But in 1961 he met Kurt Marnul, the former Mr. Austria. Marnul was impressed of Arnold's body and asked him to train in the Athletic Union in Graz. Arnold began his intense and extensive training.\n\nIn 1965 he enlisted in the Austrian army, but to compete in Stuttgart, Arnold had to go A.W.O.L and because of that, he was jailed when he came back. He won the competition in Stuttgart and he was awarded the title Jr. Mr. Europe. By the age of twenty he was named Mr. Germany and Mr. Universe. Later he won many other titles and he decided to try his luck somewhere else. After following some English lessons and after a job as roadworker in Santa Monica, California, he got the offer to play the leading part in the documentary Stay Hungry. The role brought in a Golden Globe Award and meant the start of a spectacular, successful career.\n\nHe's married to the American TV-presenter Maria Owings Shriver (in 1986). They have four children: Katherine Eunice Schwarzenegger (age 7), Christina Aurelia Schwarzenegger (age 5), Patrick Schwarzenegger (age 3) and Christopher Sergant Schwarzenegger (born: September 27th ,1997). They reside in Pacific Pallasades, California\n\nSome of the vehicles Arnold owns are: Porsche 911 Carrera convertible, Mercedes SL600, El Dorado Biarritz convertible, 4 Hummer Humvees, Harley Davidson motorcycle, Gulfstream III private jet\n\nArnold owns Oak Productions, Schatzi on Main, World Gym Enterprises, Planet Hollywood, Inc. (major co-owner), and All Star Fitness Products\n\nSome of Arnolds sports and hobbies are: bodybuilding, running, swimming, scuba diving, tennis, skiing, bowling, horseback riding, motorcycle riding, archery, skeet and trapshooting, bicycling, playing pool, traveling, drawing and collecting art.\n\nFun Facts"
