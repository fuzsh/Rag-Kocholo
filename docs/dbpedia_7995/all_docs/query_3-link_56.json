        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger, the future governor of California was born approximately 2 years after world war 2 when Austria was struggling to rebuild its economy. His family was living in poverty and owned a small family farm where Arnold had to help out as a young kid. There wasn't enough food for the family, so his mum had to go out to the streets and beg for food, then come back with a small piece of bread for the whole family to share. Arnold wanted more. He wanted to get a good job so that he could be wealthier. However, during the time in Austria, there weren't many exciting employment opportunities either. One day, Arnold saw newsreels of America. He wanted to leave Austria for the ‘American dream’. The so-called ‘land of opportunities.\n\nCaption for image: Arnold Schwarzenegger as a young kid\n\nArnold needed to think of a way to escape Austria because his family was getting poorer, and he wanted to be more successful. Then it hit him. Bodybuilding. He would get into America as a bodybuilder! Starting from the young age of 13, he began weight training for his career towards being a bodybuilder. Then, he did his national service in 1965, when he was 18. During his service, he ran away from the army for a bodybuilding contest and was arrested (and put in prison) for a week. This shows his determination to pursue his bodybuilding career.\n\nCaption for image: Arnold Schwarzenegger during his national service.\n\nWhen Arnold turned 19, he flew to London to participate in the Mr Universe competition and was placed 2nd. One of the judges was impressed and asked him to stay so he could train him for more opportunities. During this time, he also met his idol, Reg Park and in the coming year, he won the title of Mr Universe, in which he became the youngest person to do so.\n\nCaption for image: Young Arnold Schwarzenegger working towards his dreams as a bodybuilder (20s).\n\nFinally, Schwarzenegger moved to America as an immigrant in 1968, when he was 21 years old. However, he was still recognised as a migrant, since he did not have his green card (not an official American citizen).\n\nIn 1970, he won the ‘Mr Olympia’ title in New York and started acting.\n\n9 years after, he enrolled in the University of Wisconsin in America,\n\nand he graduated with a degree in business and marketing.\n\nCaption for image: Arnold Schwarzenegger in his academic dress graduating from university.\n\nIn 1982, he starred in his first successful movie - ‘Conan the barbarian’. During his acting years as someone who was not from the country (America), Arnold faced a lot of harsh criticism and was rejected by many people because he sounded different (Austrian accent) and because his name was too long. However, Schwarzenegger made these ‘negatives’ into a unique and iconic package. After living 15 years in his host country Arnold became an official American citizen in the year 1983.\n\nWhen Arnold turned 39 in 1986, he married Maria Shriver for 25 years (a journalist and member of the Kennedy family). This marriage is seen by many as an important event as it relates to his political connections (The Kennedy family remains a politically connected family).\n\nCaption for image: Arnold Schwarzenegger reciting the national oath of America on the day he became an official American citizen.\n\nDuring the presidential election, Arnold accompanied George H.W Bush at a campaign rally. Then, in 2003, he announced his candidacy to be the governor of California, and he made it. A few years later he ran for re-election in 2006 for governor of California and was successful.\n\nCaption for image: Arnold Schwarzenegger with his past wife celebrating the day of being elected governor of California.\n\nAfter his retirement in being governor, he returned to acting. Arnold had his first leading role in 10 years with The Last Stand and his first co-starring role with Sylvester Stallone in 'Escape Plan'. In 2015, he took over Donald Trump’s role as host for the ‘New celebrity apprentice’ show.\n\nCaption for image: Movie poster of one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's biggest movie- the 'Last Stand'."
