        "meta_description": "Camus’ first novel, L’Étranger, has been translated into English four times. In Stuart Gilbert’s 1946 domesticating version Meursault is verbose and less alienated than in the original. Joseph Laredo’s noticeably British 1982 version, is more colloquial and faithful to the letter, while Kate Griffith’s (1982) is unreliable. Poet Matthew Ward (1988) presents a more taciturn Meursault, rendering his alienation more apparent. The retranslations of L’Étranger reveal the most contemporary translation as being more open to alterity. Examples from the translations and the original help show that retranslation helped restore Camus’ philosophical project, conveyed by his spare writing and relative paucity of dialogue.",

        "text": "1To date, Camus’ L’Étranger has undergone four translations into English. Known as The Stranger in North America and The Outsider in Great Britain, it is very familiar to the English-speaking world. This novel of alienation, of the absurd, is often the first novel read in French by second-language learners in intermediate to advanced-level French courses, partially due to its short length and the relative facility of the language. In the US and Canada, the novel is often required reading in the last years of high school or in university, where, naturally enough, it is usually read in translation. Our goal is to look closely at the four texts, attempting to discern which factors are altered in the translation and subsequent retranslations and to determine what prompted the retranslations.\n\n7The late Matthew Ward, translator of the most recent version (New York, 1988), had translated works by Colette, Barthes, Picasso, Sartre and others. The poet and critic, thirty-seven years old at the time of the translation, had been educated at Stanford, at University College in Dublin, where he was a Fulbright Scholar, and at Columbia. He won the PEN translation prize in 1989. Although Laredo’s translation was only six years old, due to considerations of copyright it was unavailable to American readers. It was also considered markedly British and colloquial, as we will soon see. Knopf commissioned a new translation.\n\n8Ward’s is a systematic translation, one that inspires the confidence of the reader early on. Translating references of tutoiement into English is not always a straightforward task. Here Raymond Sintès has convinced Meursault to write a letter to a woman for him : “‘Je savais bien que tu connaissais la vie.’ Je ne me suis pas aperçu d’abord qu’il me tutoyait” (Camus, p. 54). “He said, ‘I could tell you knew about these things.’ I didn’t notice at first, but he had stopped calling me ‘monsieur’” (Ward, p. 33). This conforms to the original French text, as Sintès really does drop the “monsieur”. Laredo circumvents the problem by adding a detail that doesn’t appear in the French : “I didn’t notice at first, but he was calling me by my first name” (Laredo, p. 36). Gilbert’s rendering, however, with its markedly British flavour, may give today’s reader a jolt : “‘I could tell you was a brainy sort, old boy, and you know what’s what.’ At first I hardly noticed that ‘old boy’” (Gilbert, p. 41).\n\n9Gilbert’s 1946 translation reveals several other Briticisms. Referring to the query of Marie, his girlfriend, Meursault says : “I said I didn’t mind ; if she was keen on it, we’d get married” (Gilbert, p. 52). And describing a conversation with his employer, Meursault states : “[He] told me that I always shilly-shallied” (Gilbert, p. 52). His choice of words seems more appropriate for the United Kingdom than for Algiers. Laredo’s translation is characteristically direct : “[He] told me that I always evaded the question” (Laredo, p. 44), from the French “[Il] m’a dit que je répondais toujours à côté” (Camus, p. 69). Here Ward’s version succeeds in being more idiomatic than Laredo’s : “[He] looked upset and told me that I never gave him a straight answer” (Ward, p. 41). Is Laredo perhaps reacting to Gilbert’s flights of fancy, providing a scrupulously close rendering, whereas Ward, who surely would have been aware of the Laredo translation, feels comfortable experimenting more freely? While the first translator seems to have taken great strides to acclimatize readers to the foreign text, Laredo veers off in the opposite direction, adhering to the source text so closely that at times his rendering appears awkward. Ward tends to find expressions that fit idiomatically, where Laredo clings to the original : “J’allais lui dire qu’il avait tort de s’obstiner” (Camus, p. 107). Laredo translates this as : “I was about to tell him that he was wrong to insist,” whereas Ward comes up with the more idiomatic : “I was about to tell him he was wrong to dwell on it” (Ward, p. 69).\n\n10Laredo’s rendering also reveals other Briticisms, although less highbrow in nature than Gilbert’s. For instance : “I said I didn’t mind and we could do if she wanted to” (Laredo, p. 44). This seems to comply with Meursault’s rather taciturn nature. But Laredo’s prose occasionally startles the reader. He speaks of “white coffee” (Laredo, p. 14) for “café au lait” (Camus, p. 17), somehow unsettling in a novel set in a French-speaking country. At times Laredo’s Briticisms convey a working-class tone. Here Meursault is reporting on the words of Sintès : “I was a man of the world and I could help him and afterwards he’d be my mate” (Laredo, 33). The colloquial nature of Laredo’s version—which in itself is compatible with Camus’ prose—marks it as British.\n\n11Gilbert’s translation, however, steers off in the opposite direction and some of his characters appear very refined indeed : “Masson a dit qu’on avait mangé très tôt, et que c’était naturel parce que l’heure du déjeuner, c’était l’heure où l’on avait faim” (Camus, p. 84). “Masson remarked that we’d have a very early lunch, but really lunch was a movable feast, you had it when you felt like it” (Gilbert, 66). This allusion to Hemingway, which functions as an inside joke, is indicative of Gilbert’s highbrow rendering. Laredo’s is more straightforward : “Masson said we’d eaten very early and that was quite natural because the time to have lunch was when you felt hungry” (Laredo, p. 53).\n\n12Another marking characteristic of Gilbert’s translation is that he uses the pronoun “one” to render “on”, awkward to the contemporary reader, where Laredo and Ward tend to favour the more colloquial “you”. When Marie and Meursault meet up soon after the funeral to go out to the beach, Camus writes : “On devinait ses seins durs” (Camus, p. 57), which Gilbert renders as “One could see the outline of her firm little breasts” (Gilbert, p. 43). Laredo’s reads more naturally to the contemporary reader, “You could see the shape of her firm breasts” (Laredo, p. 37). In the above Gilbert quotation, note the “little” added to qualify the description of Marie’s breasts. This seems to indicate his discomfort at describing any kind of sexuality, proceeding as it does the following : “j’ai eu très envie d’elle” (Camus, p. 57) ; “I couldn’t take my eyes off her” (Gilbert, p. 41). Laredo’s rendering is markedly British : “I really fancied her” (Laredo, p. 37). Ward here is more straightforward : “I wanted her so bad” (Ward, p. 34).While there is nothing particularly shocking in Camus’ prose, at least from a contemporary point of view, both British translators shy away from its frank earthiness.\n\n13The first English translation of the novel also contains several instances of étoffement, making for a wordier, more explanatory text. Gilbert has clearly appropriated the text, crafting prose that reveals a style all his own. In Part II, the narrator describes his first days in prison : “En réalité, je n’étais pas réellement en prison les premiers jours: j’attendais vaguement quelque événement nouveau” (Camus, p. 113). Meursault’s feeling of otherness, even dreaminess, his vague anticipation, is rendered by Gilbert as : “In point of fact, during those early days, I was hardly conscious of being in prison ; I had always a vague hope that something would turn up, some agreeable surprise”. (Gilbert, p. 89). The bolded terms indicate his own interpretation, tantamount to embroidery. The strange, other-worldly aspect of not really being in prison is described by Gilbert’s Meursault in intellectual and analytical terms : he is “hardly conscious” of it, explains Gilbert. And Camus’ text does not actually speak of “hope”. The “agreeable surprise” of which the British-sounding narrator writes in the source text, is a matter-of-fact, apathetic waiting for something to happen. Here Gilbert’s narrator again appears less taciturn, more uppercrust. Laredo’s Meursault seems more matter-of-fact : “In actual fact I wasn’t actually in prison the first few days : I was vaguely waiting for something to happen” (Laredo, p 71).\n\n14Gilbert’s étoffement occasionally distorts Camus’ text. When Marie asks Meursault what Paris was like, he declares : “C’est sale. Il y a des pigeons et des cours noires” (Camus, p. 70). In the first translation, the taciturn protagonist becomes talkative and emphatic : “A dingy sort of town, to my mind. Masses of pigeons and dark courtyards” (Gilbert, p. 54). It is quite a jump from speaking of “cours noires” to portraying the city of light as “dingy”. The description of the concierge at the old age home is transformed from a nonchalant “Il s’est interrompu” (Camus, p. 14) to “He put back the screwdriver in his pocket and stared at me” (Gilbert, p. 6). A pattern emerges in Gilbert’s translation : he writes illustrative sentences explaining rather than directly translating the original. These flesh out the novel as he sees it, not necessarily how Camus wrote it. While Gilbert is consistent in his own writing style, a reader comparing his translation with the original is likely to get a different picture of the protagonist. He continually explains and interprets more than Camus does, at least in his revised édition. For instance, when the restaurant owner Céleste has finished testifying, we learn : “Il avait l’air de me demander ce qu’il pouvait encore faire” (Camus, p. 145). “It was exactly as if he’d said : ‘Well, I’ve done my best for you, old man. I’m afraid it hasn’t helped much. I’m sorry’” (Gilbert, p.l 16). And this departs from the disjointed quality of the French.\n\n16Laredo’s protagonist is less talkative and less emphatic, like Camus’, but in his apparent faithfulness to the source text the translator falls into a few traps, coming up with at least one calque : “Après l’enterrement au contraire, ce sera une affaire classée et tout aura revêtu une allure plus officielle” (Extrait A3). “After the funeral though, the death will be a classified fact and the whole thing will have assumed a more officiai aura” (Laredo, 3/b). “Classified fact” and “aura” are calques of “affaire classée” and “allure”. Here Gilbert succeeds in being more idiomatic : “The funeral will bring it home to me, put an officiai seal on it, so to speak...” (Gilbert, 3/a).\n\n17One of the most significant and startling differences between the Gilbert translation and Camus’ original, is the translator’s insertion of dialogue where Camus has written discours indirect libre. Describing the restaurant owner’s testimony at Meursault’s trial, the narrator describes the scene unemotionally, flatly : “L’avocat général lui a demandé si je payais régulièrement ma pension. Céleste a ri et il a déclaré : ‘C’étaient des détails entre nous’” (Camus, p. 144). Gilbert’s text is more colourful, and he specifies elements Camus left open. “The Prosecutor asked him if I always settled my monthly bill at his restaurant when he presented it. Céleste laughed. “Oh, he paid on the nail, all right. But the bills were just detailslike, between him and me” (Gilbert, p. 115). By increasing the amount of direct speech, Gilbert adds a liveliness to Céleste’s testimony that never appears in the original. Also during Céleste’s testimony, we learn : “[on lui a demandé] s’il avait remarqué que j’étais renfermé et il a reconnu seulement que je ne parlais pas pour ne rien dire.” (Camus, p. 143-144) “Was I a secretive sort of man?” “No,” he answered, “I shouldn’t call him that. But he isn’t one to waste his breath, like a lot of folks.” (Gilbert, p.115). Thus Gilbert’s translation takes on a chattier dimension that renders the work less strange.\n\n20Camus’ novel is also remarkable for its predominant use of the passé composé, a verb tense associated with spoken language, one that implies a link to the present of narration. This use of the passé composé would fall into what Émile Benveniste calls “discours”, which he opposes to “récit historique”, told in the passé simple, the usual tense for storytelling – largely absent in Camus’ novel. Similarly, Harald Weinrich opposes “monde commenté” (predominant in L’Étranger) and “monde raconté”. The distinction between the passé composé and the passé simple is one for which English has no equivalent. The novel begins in the passé composé, a sign of modernity that accentuates the solitude of each sentence and makes the hero appear more removed. Sartre claims : “C’est pour accentuer la solitude de chaque unité phrastique que M. Camus a choisi de faire son récit au parfait composé” (Sartre, p. 142-143). Do the translators compensate in other ways for this phenomenon, impossible to reproduce?\n\n21Camus’ use of poetic language is dealt with in various ways by the translators (Textes de référence, Excerpt B). When the court rises and Meursault is taken back to the prison in a van, Camus describes : “cette rumeur du ciel avant que la nuit bascule sur le port” (Excerpt B2), which Griffith renders as “the sudden surge of nightfall as it spills over the port” (Griffith, Excerpt B2/c). Yet “surge of nightfall spilling” eliminates the sound of nightfall described by “cette rumeur du ciel”, and her rendering doesn’t manage to correctly convey the referential meaning, let alone the poetry. “Rumeur” is rendered as “rustling” by Gilbert (Gilbert, Excerpt B2/a), and as “hum” by Ward (Ward, Excerpt B2/d).\n\n22Camus writes (at the end of this excerpt) : “tout cela recomposait pour moi un itinéraire d’aveugle, que je connaissais bien avant d’entrer en prison,” (Camus, Excerpt B2), which Griffith translates as “all of this reconstructed for me an itinerary that I groped through blindly, reacquainting myself with every object before entering the prison” (Griffith, p. Excerpt B2/c). The verb “groped” here is a cliché : its only purpose is to collocate with “blindly”. Gilbert opts for “All these sounds made my return to prison like a blind man’s journey along a route whose every inch he knows by heart” (Gilbert, Excerpt B2/a), managing characteristically to play with the order of the words.\n\n23Finally, Camus writes : “Comme si les chemins familiers tracés dans les ciels d’été pouvaient mener aussi bien aux prisons qu’aux sommeils innocents,” (Excerpt B3) which Gilbert renders as “And so I learned that familiar paths traced in the dusk of summer evenings may lead as well to prisons as to innocent, untroubled sleep” (Gilbert, Excerpt B3/a). The “untroubled” is another addition by Gilbert, and “dusk”, while logical enough in the context, simply isn’t present in the French. Here, aside from the referential meaning, Ward captures the significance of the prose : “as if familiar paths traced in summer skies could lead as easily to prison as to the sleep of the innocent” (Ward, Excerpt B3/d).\n\n24Ward takes some risks in his translation, many of which involve embracing foreign elements in the translation. He writes in his translator’s note :\n\nNo sentence in French literature in English translation is better known than the opening sentence of The Stranger. It has become a sacred cow of sorts, and I have changed it. In his notebooks Camus recorded the observation that “The curious feeling the son has for his mother constitutes all his sensibility.” And Sartre, in his “Explication de L’Étranger,” goes out of his way to point out Meursault’s use of the child’s word “Maman” when speaking of his mother. (Ward, p. vii)\n\n25While the other translators favoured the more colourless, bland and perhaps inaccurate “Mother” [died today], Ward recasts his as : “Maman died today”. He affirms : “To use the more removed, adult ’Mother’ is, I believe, to change the nature of Meursault’s curious feeling for her. It is to change his very sensibility” (Ward, p. vii). This latest translation is the one that most openly embraces foreign elements from the source text.\n\n27Richard Howard, in his introduction to his retranslation of Gide’s L’Immoraliste affïrms :\n\n29By casting aside Gilbert’s markedly British rendering, now peppered with expressions likely to be unfamiliar to young, especially North American readers, Ward manages to craft a text that is mid-Atlantic in flavour. His translation is in a position to influence young minds reading the novel for the first time. This most recent English version is finally more accessible than the Gilbert, or even the updated Laredo version could hope to be. The poetic language translated by a poet isn’t “lost”, but rather recreated to make for a living text as opposed to a relie. Pourquoi donc retraduire? Ward’s translation maintains the vitality of a work that – in English – would otherwise be waning. “Outside The Stranger?” The latest translation is one which certainly is in keeping – linguistically, spiritually and philosophically – with L’Étranger.\n\nCamus, Albert, L’Étranger, Paris, Gallimard, 1957 (1942)\n\n— The Stranger, tr.
