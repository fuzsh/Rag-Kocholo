        "text": "French intellectuals have heaped scorn on a proposal by Nicolas Sarkozy to bestow the country's greatest posthumous honour upon the writer Albert Camus, accusing the rightwing president of trying to cash in on the thinker's popularity with little respect for his politics or personality.\n\nSarkozy said in Brussels last week that he thought it would be an \"extraordinary symbol\" to transfer the Algerian-born author's remains to the Panthéon, the resting place for heroes of France, on the 50th anniversary of his death in January.\n\n\"I thought it would be a particularly pertinent choice,\" he told journalists, while cautioning that no decision had yet been taken. \"[It is] a project which is extraordinarily close to my heart.\" An Élysée adviser, Georges-Marc Benamou, told journalists last month that Camus's \"non-conformism in relation to France's elites\" appealed to the president, the son of a Hungarian immigrant who prides himself on not having come from the conventional politician's background.\n\nBut the idea of a rightwing leader often accused of authoritarian tendencies and anti-intellectualism celebrating the life of a man who made a career out of political resistance and literary endeavour has outraged many Camus experts.\n\nThey suspect Sarkozy is using a golden opportunity to bask in the reflected glory of a charismatic hero, whose ideas are being feted by the mainstream half a century after he died in a car crash.\n\n\"I don't think Albert Camus has any need of Sarkozy. I think Sarkozy has greater need of some intellectual sparkle,\" said Olivier Todd, a biographer of Camus, on French radio.\n\nJeanyves Guérin, another academic, said that while the author of The Outsider and The Fall deserved to be honoured, other politicians had had more right to order it than the current French president. \"Sarkozy is the friend of [George W] Bush, [Muammar] Gaddafi, [Vladimir] Putin, [Silvio] Berlusconi. His politics are the antithesis of the values and ideas which Camus defended,\" he claimed.\n\nSarkozy, for whom the Nobel prize-winner would be the first addition to the Panthéon, has said he would only be able to act with the approval of Camus's children, who hold the rights to his estate. The writer is currently buried in the cemetery of Lourmarin, the village in southern France to which he moved in 1958.\n\nCatherine Camus, his daughter, has said she has \"only doubts\" about the move, while acknowledging its potential to be a \"great symbol\" for hope given her father's humble origins and subsequent fame. More worryingly for the Élysée, Jean Camus, her twin brother, is believed to be set against it. According to Le Monde, he feels the transferral would be \"contradictory\" to Camus's life and work.\n\nAside from questions over Sarkozy's motives and legitimacy, others agree that the \"Panthéonisation\" of a notoriously discreet man would be inappropriate no matter who ordered it. Jean Daniel, an Algerian-born French journalist, said: \"Camus is the author ... of measured heroism. I do not see that the Panthéon glorifies measured heroism.\"\n\nHowever, Alain Vircondelet, author of a biography to be released in January, said that neither the unease with grandeur nor the president's supposed manipulation should get in the way of what could be an \"extremely symbolic\" move.\n\n\"This should be something that transcends that,\" he said, adding that although he is not a Sarkozy supporter he was \"irritated\" by attempts to turn \"a real event\" into a political row. \"The left is saying 'hands off Camus', but Camus doesn't belong to them. He was a person who went beyond [party] politics.\"\n\nHome for heroes\n\nInscribed above the entrance to the Panthéon on Paris's Left Bank are the words \"Aux grands hommes, la patrie reconnaissante\" (\"To great men the grateful homeland\"). Beneath its pale dome lie the remains of dozens of men – and one woman – decreed worthy of their country's most distinguished burial ground. For presidents, choosing who to add to the long list of names can be a tricky business. Jacques Chirac picked just two people – Alexandre Dumas and André Malraux, the writer and former culture minister. François Mitterrand selected many more, including the scientist Marie Curie. If Nicolas Sarkozy succeeds in transferring Albert Camus's ashes from Lourmarin, the 20th-century literary giant will be among the likes of Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Emile Zola."
