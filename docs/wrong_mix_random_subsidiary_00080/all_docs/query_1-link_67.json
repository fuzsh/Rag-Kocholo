        "text": "For four decades, millions of readers have opened the English translation of Albert Camus's classic French novel ''The Stranger,'' and encountered those famous three words:\n\n''Mother died today.''\n\nThe phrase has become a classic, but even classics can succumb to time. Now readers have another version to quote - the sentence found in a new translation of the novel:\n\n''Maman died today.''\n\nThat sentence, the rest of the first paragraph and practically every other paragraph has been dramatically revised in what is being called an Americanized translation that has just been published by Alfred A. Knopf.\n\nWhy has a French novel been Americanized?\n\nBecause the late Nobel laureate was influenced by American novelists and followed their style, according to Matthew Ward, a 37-year-old New Yorker who is a translator and poet. In a talk the other day, Mr. Ward said it was daring to undertake a translation of a book that has been so admired all these years. ''But what I've done is closer to the author's intent,'' he said confidently, ''and that's what counts.'' Short-Term French Study\n\nMr. Ward, who comes from a Spanish-speaking family in Colorado, studied French for only a year and a half at Stanford University before going on for advance degrees in Anglo-Irish literature at University College in Dublin and at Columbia University.\n\n''I internalized Romance languages listening to my mother,'' he said. ''Our family goes back to 1598 in old New Mexico, with a governor as an ancestor. And I really do have a mother named Carmen.''\n\n''The Stranger'' - the story of an ordinary man who gets drawn into a senseless murder on a beach outside Algiers - is one of the few modern European novels that has gained wide popularity in the United States. Since its first publication here in English by Alfred A. Knopf in 1946 and its subsequent appearance a few years later in a mass-market Vintage paperback, the novel has sold more than 3 1/2 million copies.\n\n''L'Etranger'' was first published by Libraire Gallimard in Paris in 1942. The original English translation was by Stuart Gilbert, a respected British author who translated the work of many major French novelists and essayists.\n\nAlthough ''The Stranger'' was recognized as an important novel from the beginning, many American readers have wondered about its British usage since its first appearance in English. 'Closer to London'\n\nIn a review in The New York Times written in 1946, for example, Charles Poore wrote: ''Mr. Gilbert's translation of the novel is at times rather Brittanic. Phrases such as 'good and proper' and sentences such as 'You've knocked around the world a bit, and I daresay you can help me,' sound closer to London than to Algiers.''\n\nJudith Jones, Mr. Ward's editor at Knopf, recognized that the time had come for a new translation that was closer to Camus. Mr. Ward said: ''I jumped at the chance and worked with Judith on it for nearly three years. It gave me an opportunity to push my one grain of sand up the beach of culture.''\n\nHow does he explain retaining ''Maman'' in an English translation instead of ''Mother''?\n\n''Well, I wouldn't use the word 'Mommy' because that belongs to our culture,'' Mr. Ward said, amused at the thought. '' 'Mother' is a colder word. By using it, Gilbert changed something essential about the sensibility of Mersault, the central character, and his relationship with his mother. It becomes much less complicated if he simply calls her 'Mother.' That gives the relationship a psychological shift - the mother becomes distanced from the son. As a translator, I was not free to change their relationship.''\n\nCould he justify Americanizing French sentences? 'More Like Cain'\n\n''Camus admitted using an 'American method,' particularly in the first half of the book,'' Mr. Ward said. ''He mentioned Hemingway, Dos Passos, Faulkner and James M. Cain as influences. My feeling is that 'The Stranger' is more like Cain's 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' than Camus cared to admit.''\n\nMr. Ward offered another example of the difference between his direct American style and Mr. Gilbert's British version:\n\n''At one point, Mersault observes 'Il etait avec son chien.' With the reflex of a well-bred Englishman, Gilbert restores the conventional relation between man and beast and gives additional adverbial information: 'As usual, he had his dog with him.' But I have taken Mersault at his word: 'He was with his dog' - in the way one is with a spouse or a friend. A sentence as straightforward as this gives us the world through Mersault's eyes.''\n\nJuggling the French, English and ''American'' versions in his hands, Mr. Ward said, ''All translations date, even Pope's translation of Homer. In fairness to Gilbert, his is over 40 years old. I bow in his direction - and hope that my translation will bring a new generation of readers to the great Camus novel.'' The French Original\n\nAujourd-hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-etre hier, je ne sais pas. J'ai recu un telegramme de l'asile: ''Mere decedee. Enterrement demain. Sentiments distingues.'' Cela ne veut rien dire. C'etait peut-etre hier. Traditional English Translation\n\nMother died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure. The telegram from the Home says: YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP SYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday. New 'American' Translation\n\nMaman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know. I got a telegram from the home: ''Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours.'' That doesn't mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday."
