        "text": "Today would have been Albert Camus's 100th birthday. Celebrations of his writing are taking place across Europe, including in London, and Penguin have just republished his works with new covers and introductions. So what makes Camus's books so important and so influential?\n\nHis interests were wide, and his ideas have filtered down to everyone from playwrights to indie rockers. The Algerian-born French writer has been called the master of the absurd, but while a student, Camus played in goal for his university's football team and later wrote: \"All that I know most surely about morality and obligations I owe to football\".\n\nDespite suffering from Tuberculosis throughout his life (which halted his football career), he was a dedicated smoker, so much so that he eventually named his cat Cigarette.\n\nCamus is the author of five novels: The Fall, The Outsider (L'Etranger), The Plague, A Happy Death and The First Man. The most famous is probably The Outsider, the story of a man known only as Meursault. After committing a crime and refusing to conform to society's expectations of him (he does not cry at his mother's funeral), he is labelled a psychopath.\n\nCamus's essays are some of the clearest expressions of his arguments. The Myth of Sisyphus, which at around 130 pages is similar in length to The Outsider, introduces Camus's interest in the absurd: the futility of a search for meaning in an incomprehensible world, and how humans might deal with the hostile realities of life.\n\nCamus's theories on the absurd became so widely admired that he reportedly stopped using the phrase \"that's absurd\" in conversation, as people kept thinking he was making a subtle philosophical point.\n\nThough Camus is probably most famous for his fiction and essays, he also wrote six plays. The best-known is Caligula, often cited alongside The Outsider and The Myth of Sisyphus as part of Camus's treatise on the absurd, and focusing on the philosophical problem of suicide.\n\nCamus began his writing life as a reporter for the Alger Républicain newspaper, later describing journalism as \"one of the finest professions that I can think of\". After the liberation of Nazi-occupied France, he became a columnist for the newspaper Combat. A collection of his political journalism, essays and interviews is published in several volumes as Actuelles, and includes radical opinions on Marxism and existentialism.\n\nCamus's final book, The First Man, was discovered as an unfinished manuscript in the wreckage of the car accident that killed him. Ostensibly a work of fiction, it has clearly autobiographical elements, particularly the inclusion of the main character's poor childhood in Algiers, and his illiterate mother.\n\nHis plays and his writing have influenced 20th-century dramatists including Samuel Beckett and Arthur Miller, while The Outsider in particular has had a lasting effect on the British music scene. The Cure's debut single, Killing an Arab, relates Meursault's crime (\"I'm alive / I'm dead / I'm the stranger / Killing an Arab\"), while Scottish indie rock band Meursault are named after Camus's character.\n\n\"As long as there are angry young men in the world there will always be a need for Camus and L'Etranger,\" the band's singer Neil Pennycook tells me. \"When I was a little younger I think it probably taught me a few harsh lessons, but when I read it now I find it a little too nihilistic in its overall message... I've found it useful to see the name as a kind of caricature of the darker elements of my work. It's a thing I do to keep from being too serious about it all.\"\n\n\"In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.\" – The Outsider (1942)\n\n\"We always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love – first to their advantage, then to their disadvantage.\" – A Happy Death (1938)\n\n\"A novel is never anything but a philosophy put into images.\" – from a review of Jean-Paul Sartre's Nausea, Alger Républicain (1938)\n\n\"Knowing that certain nights whose sweetness lingers will keep returning to the earth and sea after we are gone, yes, this helps us to die.\" – from The Sea Close By, first published in Lyrical and Critical Essays (1970)\n\nEvents to mark Camus's centenary include a week of programmes on BBC Radio 3, focusing on \"the man behind the existential theories\", while the Southbank Centre in London stages a dramatised reading of The Outsider on Thursday night, starring Justin Salinger and Emily Bruni.\n\nIn Camus' adopted town of Lourmarin in south-east France, there's a day of public lectures on Camus's philosophy on Saturday November 9, and a performance of his unfinished final novel. There are other academic talks, roundtables and discussions taking place across France this weekend."
