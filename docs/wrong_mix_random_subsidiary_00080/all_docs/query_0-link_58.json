        "text": "Peter Francev: ‘Gushing Over Nature, or Janine’s Sexual Exhibitionism’\n\nAbstract: For the past few years, I have been interested in the topic of Albert Camus and empathy and, rightfully so, as I am currently writing a monograph on the subject, it makes sense that I would be interested in such a subject. However, for as long as I have been formally and informally studying Camus (which is surpassing 25 years), I have always been plagued (no pun intended) by the seemingly hard-lined interpretation that the protagonist of one of Camus’s most recognizable short stories ‘The Adulterous Woman’, Janine has been largely contextualized as an unhappily married woman to her husband Marcel and has an ‘affair’ of sorts that is anything but sexual. In this paper, I plan to quickly examine what previous scholars have said about Janine, her mental state of mind and her supposedly adulterous actions, before I offer what seems to me a rather conventional and entirely plausible reading and interpretation of the short story, including Janine’s indeed adulterous actions. And this is not to say that Janine cannot be linked to previous Camusian characters who are both female and aware of their sexuality, namely Marie from The Stranger.\n\nWhilst there is no mention of the empathy or ethics of Edith Stein in the fiction and non-fiction of Albert Camus, one can easily surmise that Camus, being a part of the Parisian café scene during the years leading up to, including and beyond the second world war, would have encountered some discussions of Stein’s thought through Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir or Maurice Merleau-Ponty, prior to his falling out with both men. It is then the purpose of this paper to set out and accomplish several things: firstly, I would like to provide a very brief introduction to the empathy of Stein; secondly, I should like to offer readers a concise summary of Stein’s principle text on empathy (On the Problem of Empathy)1; finally, I would like to offer an exposition and an analysis of Stein’s concept of empathy, from a phenomenological perspective, whilst keeping in mind Camus’s philosophy of the absurd as posited in The Myth of Sisyphus.\n\nGina Breen: ‘French-Algerian Exile’\n\nAlbert Camus’s L’Exil et le Royaume was Camus’s last official literary publication before his death in 1960. It is a collection of six short stories, published in 1957, seven months before he received the Nobel Prize in Literature. In his acceptance speech, which was misreported, Camus specifically addressed justice and the Algerian situation, by discussing the role of the writer and the importance of truth, communicating his belief that the writer has a social duty as they bear witness to history.\n\nIn this paper, I will discuss three of the six short stories, namely “La Femme Adultère,” “Les Muets” and “L’Hôte” which are all set in Algeria. Written at the beginning of the armed struggle, the stories were published three years into the Algerian War. I argue that these stories demonstrate the moral dilemmas of the colonial situation, and they are vital to our understanding of Camus’s mythopoetics and the evolution of the pied-noir myth Camus first presents in L’étranger fifteen years earlier. Like Meursault, the characters in these stories suffer from estrangement. As the title suggests, Camus’s identity crisis still exists as he depicts the poverty, self-exile, exclusion, and solitude inherent in these dystopic Algerian spaces. None of the stories end with resolutions and the characters’ neutrality makes them victims of French colonialism. The stories and protagonists also mirror many of Camus’s personal confrontations because they hesitate about the future. They imply a certain degree of hopefulness, but their true feelings remain hidden\n\nFirst in a series of podcasts taken directly from the action at the annual meeting of The Albert Camus Society held on-line in November, 2021. This series of podcasts will give listeners first access to the newest (yet to be published) research on Albert Camus from the top Camus scholars in the world. The papers you hear on these podcasts will eventually appear in The Journal of Camus Studies, click HERE to go to the journal's webpage.\n\nFirst up - Siimon Lea of the U.K. His paper on Camus and Nietzsche and Myth is a deeply engaging tour of this under-researched area in both Camus and Nietzsche studies. You will fine Simon Lea a very engaging speaker mixing just a bit of humor with loads of top-flight scholarship. Enjoy.\n\nAlbert Camus, Edith Stein, and the Problem of Empathy in The Plague\n\nAbstract: Whilst there is no mention of the phenomenology or ethics of Edith Stein (1891-1942) in the fiction and non-fiction of Albert Camus (1913-1960), one can easily surmise that Camus, being a part of the Parisian café scene during the years leading up to, including and beyond the second world war, would have encountered some discussions of Stein’s thought through Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) or Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908-1961), prior to his falling out with both men. It is then the purpose of this paper to set out and accomplish several things: firstly, I would like to provide a very brief historical introduction to Stein; secondly, I should like to offer readers a concise summary of Stein’s principle text on empathy (On the Problem of Empathy)[1]; finally, I would like to offer an exposition and analysis of Stein’s concept of empathy, from a phenomenological perspective, in Camus’s novel The Plague[2]. To say that 2020 has been an ‘uneventful’ year is a gross understatement. Clearly, the Covid-19 pandemic affected us in ways which we could have never imagined. One benefit of the pandemic, as you are probably aware, is, once again, the intense interest in The Plague[3]. As I plan to illustrate, the novel contains six major and minor characters (Dr. Rieux, Paneloux, Tarrou, Rambert, Grand, and Cottard) from which Camus utilizes in order to demonstrate an individual’s interaction with empathy in the midst of an epidemic; however, I would like to first look at Stein in order to provide the framework for the novel’s analysis.\n\n[1] Edith Stein, On the Problem of Empathy. Translated by Waltraut Stein (Springer: The Hague, 1964).\n\n[2] Albert Camus, The Plague. Translated by Stuart Gilbert (Vintage: New York, 1948).\n\n[3] According to the NY Times, The Plague has seen a resurgence on the best seller list. In addition to Vintage having an extremely difficult time keeping the novel in stock, Camus scholars Dr. Robert Zaretsky and Dr. Peter Francev were interviewed by National Public Radio’s Salt Lake City affiliate regarding Camus’s life and the significance of The Plague, respectively.\n\nIn this episode I have uploaded my presentation to the Albert Camus Society annual meeting held on-line on October 23, 2020.\n\nTitle: Four Character Studies from The Plague and Their American Counterparts During COVID-19\n\nIn this paper I will take a close look at four characters in Camus’ The Plague and situate them in the current (2020) American landscape while suffering under COVID-19. I will illuminate Father Panloux in relation to American Christian response to COVID, particularly the Baptist Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America; Dr. Rieux and the American medical community paying special attention to the CDC; Cottard as the American radical right; and Rambert and the American press with attention given to the idea of “fake news” and social media. As a bonus, I will identify Dr. Castel and, although difficult, locate the American President Donald Trump in the text. I will use a descriptive tool from Simone Weil known as decreation to help illuminate the normative aspects of this comparison.\n\nGeorge Heffernan Professor of Philosophy at Merrimack College, he earned his B.A. and M.A. from The Catholic University of America and his Ph.D. from the University of Cologne, Germany. He also holds the highest degree in the German Language awarded by the Goethe Institute of Munich as well as the diploma of a State-Certified Translator and Interpreter for the German Language granted by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Bonn.\n\nEnjoy this lively and engaging scholar of the very first order. Professor Heffernan has presented many papers on Camus and has been the skillful author of several articles on Camus that have shaped the way we think about Camus. especially: “‘Rien, rien n’avait d’importance et je savais bien pourquoi’ (‘Nothing, nothing mattered, and I well knew why’): The World According to Meursault—or A Critical Attempt to Understand the Absurdist Philosophy of the Protagonist of Albert Camus’s The Stranger”, Journal of Camus Studies 2 (2012), 221–259\n\nA bit of a longer podcast at 1.37 but well worth your time.\n\nEnjoy this wonderful conversation about Camus.\n\nProfessor James Woelfel received his Ph.D. in Religious Studies from the University of St. Andrews, became a member of the University of Kansas faculty in 1966, and served as Director of Humanities & Western Civilization from 1985 until July 2010.\n\nHis teaching and research have been primarily 19th and 20th century European philosophical and religious thought. Among the books he has authored are Bonhoeffer’s Theology, Borderland Christianity, Albert Camus on the Sacred and the Secular, Portraits in Victorian Religious Thought, The Existentialist Legacy and Other Essays on Philosophy and Religion, and is an editor of Patterns in Western Civilization fourth edition.\n\nProfessor Woelfel was a 1997 recipient of the Kansas Humanities Council’s Silver Anniversary Public Scholar Award, and in 1998 received a Kemper Fellowship for Excellence in Teaching. He retired from KU in May 2015.\n\nIn this interview, I ask Dr. Woelfel 20 questions about Albert Camus. Enjoy this engaging interview with Dr Woelfel, my dissertation advisor!\n\nIn this episode you will find a fascinating conversation with Dr. Gordon Marino on Camus using my \"20 Questions\" format. I am confident you will find Dr. Marino deeply engaging, lucid, insightful, and a very enjoyable conversationalist.\n\nDr. Marino earned his Ph.D., from the University of Chicago, M.A. University of Pennsylvania, and his B.A. from Columbia University.\n\nHis areas of specialization include History of Philosophy, Philosophy of Religion, and Kierkegaard and clearly, a deep knowledge and understanding of Camus.\n\nProfessor Marino is the author of Kierkegaard in the Present Age and co-editor of The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard. His articles have appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, New York Times Magazine, Wall Street Journal, American Poetry Review, and many other periodicals.\n\nHis most recent book is The Existentialist's Survival Guide: How to Live Authentically in an Inauthentic Age.\n\nDr. Marino is also the Curator of the Hong Kierkegaard Library, an incredible treasure that generations of scholars have benefited from over the years, including the author of this blog.\n\nEnjoy this \"20 Questions on Camus\" interview:\n\nEnjoy this question and answer session with one of the premier Camus scholars in the world, Dr. Peter Francev.\n\nDr. Francev is the Chair of the English Department at Victor Valley College in California. Professor Francev holds an M.A in Philosophy from University College, Dublin, an M.A in English from California State University Polytechnic University, Pomona and his Ph.D. was granted in English from The University of Leicester. Dr. Francev has published multiple articles on Camus and he is the editor of two landmark text on Camus.\n\nIn this interview we discuss Camus's works and Camus as a person. Dr. Francev makes a number of very interesting observations and illuminates several aspects of Camus authorship that brings a new energy to his work. Take the time to learn from this distinguished scholar, and you can do it from your own home! Or while, driving across the country on a road trip!\n\nThe first installment covering the works of Albert Camus. In this podcast I will give a very short (16 minutes) introduction to Camus' novel The Plague.\n\nI will offer some insight into the construction, context, and background of the text. Some listeners prefer to read the book first then listen, others use these podcasts and videos as an entry point to the text. You can see a video version of this talk by \"clicking\" here: Albert Camus Radio blog.\n\nEnjoy the blog and these podcasts and please look for others podcasts covering all the work by Camus, a series of interviews with prominent Camus scholars from around the world, and podcasts on secondary sources about Camus.\n\nI wish you well,\n\nDr. Eric Berg"
