        "text": "Political freedom in the Arab world and rebellion against it underpin the novel al-Ayn dhat al-jafn alma dani (The Eye with an Iron Lid, 1980) by Egyptian author Sharif Hatatah (1923– ). This novel set in 1940s Egypt, a decade of national and social ferment, harshly criticizes British colonialism and the Egyptian governments of the time. The narrative depicts the struggle of the Egyptian national movement as well as the brutal denial of political and individual freedoms that led to the July 1952 revolution. The novel is profoundly autobiographical, and Hatatah’s life story as a doctor, writer and political activist depicted in his al-Nawafidh al-maftuhah (The Open Windows, 2006) contributes valuable background. A wide-ranging analysis of the author and his novel embraces comparative literature, especially within the Arabic prison literature genre, recent critical studies, the existential philosophy of Albert Camus and the psychological elements of fear of death, loneliness and persecution. At its root the article spotlights the adage, the people’s fear of the leadership and the leadership’s fear of the people, that drives so much of contemporary Middle Eastern conflict and oppression.\n\nIntroduction, and the final \"Algerian\" chapter of Camus, Philosophe: To Return to our Beginnings (Brill, 2015). The book argues that Camus is to understood as a philosopher, both in the classical lineage of philosophy as a way of life, and the enlightenment sense of a \"philosophe\": aiming to bring philosophical reflection and criticism to wider publics, by using literary as well as technical modes of writing.\n\nTHIS is not so much a history of the Arabs as an essay in interpretation. Rather than compress so vast a subject into a bare outline of dates and events, I have sought to isolate and examine certain basic issues—the place of the Arabs in human history, their identity, their achievement, and the salient characteristics of the several ages of their development. In a work of this nature it is not possible nor indeed desirable to acknowledge the sources of every point of fact and interpretation. Orientalists will recognize at once my debt to the masters, past and present, of Islamic historical studies. For the rest, I can only express my general indebtedness to my predecessors, teachers, colleagues, and students who have all helped, in different ways, to form the view of Arab history set forth in these pages. My special thanks are due to Professor Sir Hamilton Gibb, the late Professors U. Heyd and D. S. Rice for reading and criticizing my manuscript, to Miss J. Bridges for preparing the index, and to Professor A. T. Hatto for many useful suggestions."
