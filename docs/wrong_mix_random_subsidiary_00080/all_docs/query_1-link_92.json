People all over the world connect the book to their coming of age, to grappling with the toughest questions of existence. The story of Meursault, a man whose name contains a plunge (saut) into death (meur), is a deceptively simple one: his mother dies in an old people’s home and he travels to her funeral.1 When he gets back, he goes swimming with a girlfriend and takes her to the movies. He writes a letter for a friend who is a pretty rough character. He kills an Arab on a beach in Algiers. He is tried and sentenced to death, and, as the novel ends, he awaits execution. It’s not much to go on. Yet The Stranger is as gripping and puzzling today as it was in 1942, with its images both ordinary and unforgettable: a view from the balcony on a lazy Sunday, the whimper of a dog being beaten, the light shooting off a steel knife, a view of the sea from a prison window. And those four quick knocks on the door of unhappiness, echoes of a stupid vigilante ­killing. My experience teaching The Stranger, and giving talks about the novel, is that everyone in the room has read it—usually twice. The debate is always informed and heated. Does Meursault exemplify the human condition? Should we sympathize with him? Why doesn’t he cry at his mother’s funeral? And why, in the end, does he want people to gather at his execution and greet him with cries of hatred? English-­speaking readers of L’Étranger want to talk about whether it should be called, in translation, The Stranger or The Outsider. They want to know why the Algerian setting of the novel matters, what 1\n\n2 · Prologue\n\ndifference it makes that Meursault is an Algerian Frenchman in a colonial setting, and why the Arab he kills is given no name. Every reader of The Stranger has a theory, whether they read the book last week or fifty years ago. The allure of Camus’s novel means you can read it again and again and see something different in it each time. The critics have done just that, calling it a colonial allegory, an existential prayer book, an indictment of conventional morality, a study in alienation, or “a Hemingway rewrite of Kafka.”2 That critical commotion is one mark of a masterpiece, but not the only one. Camus was proud of a singular literary innovation, almost a trick: he told his story in the first person, which usually lets the reader inside the narrator’s head—but he did it so that there was no getting inside, no way to feel close to Meursault. How can such a distant and empty narrator capture so much attention, and how can such a disturbing book elicit so much loyalty? The absence of depth in Meursault, his strange indifference, has paradoxically drawn readers to him, since it is natural to hunger for understanding when it’s withheld. Anyone who loves to read knows that books have a life. They come to life as you read them, and they stay alive long after you’ve turned the last page. Among the intangible factors in The Stranger’s long life are certainly the limpid music of the sentences, the rough sensuality of the Algerian setting, the imagistic writing, and the perfect symmetry of the story of a life cut in two by a murder on the beach. All these formal and esthetic elements of the novel have been studied assiduously by scholars and taught to the generations of students who have read The Stranger for school since the 1950s—often as their first intense literary experience in an AP English course or a college philosophy seminar, or in the final two years of the French lycée. In fact, you can construct a pretty accurate history of twentieth-­century literary criticism by following the successive waves of analysis of The Stranger: existentialism, new criticism, deconstruction, feminism, postcolonial studies. Yet something essential is lacking in our understanding of the\n\nPrologue · 3\n\nauthor and the book. By concentrating on themes and theories—­ esthetic, moral, political—critics have taken the very existence of The Stranger for granted. Biographies have of course touched on Camus’s situation while writing The Stranger, but their focus is the man, not his book. The fact that Camus was such a glamorous and admirable person—a political activist, a great humanitarian—has meant that his life story has eclipsed the story of his writing more completely than if he had been mean, or homely. Yes, details about variations in the manuscript are available in small print, in the definitive French edition. But no one has told the story of exactly how Camus created this singular book—I’m tempted to say, how he discovered the novel within himself—and how it came to be published during the Nazi Occupation, in one of the most humiliating and complicated climates for publishing in French history.3 It’s an astonishing success story, with consequences so enormous for the future of the novel, you might consider the appearance of The Stranger on the literary landscape as an evolutionary accident that made way for a whole new species.4 · That is why I thought The Stranger deserved a biography, a story of its life, connected to the life of its creator but also separate and distinct from him. I first came upon the idea of a book’s biography reading Michael Gorra’s excellent Portrait of a Novel: The Making of an American Masterpiece, about Henry James’s Portrait of a Lady. From Portrait and from its exquisitely self-­conscious creator, writing in his maturity, Gorra drew rich and many-­layered reflections on life and work and literary influences.5 In the case of The Stranger, begun by a twenty-­six-­year-­old aspiring writer in the boondocks of Algeria, without reputation or œuvre, the life story of the book is at once more straightforward and more difficult to flesh out.6 Lloyd Kramer put it another way: “Like an historian looking for the causes of a war, the biographer of a book looks for the causes of that book.”7 ·\n\n4 · Prologue\n\nBy starting with the first glimmers of the novel in Camus’s notebooks and letters, I make my way through the years of its creation, moving from the writer at work to the words on the page. My method resembles what fiction writers call a “close third-­person narrative”: I follow Camus, month by month, as though I were looking over his shoulder, telling the story of the novel from his, rather than my own, point of view. My design is to get as close as I can to his process and his state of mind as he creates The Stranger, sends it out for review, and publishes it in wartime France. This is not the “omniscient voice” of standard literary criticism, although my own critical assessments guide the telling, and I use endnotes to complement this history with information about the rich literary criticism on the novel. I’ve also included maps of Algeria and wartime France, to give the reader a sense of The Stranger’s odyssey between North Africa and France as it went from manuscript to book. The story of The Stranger isn’t over when the novel is published in 1942: the first responses are dramatic, funny, and strange. Over the years, the book has had friends, enemies, and many offspring, including translations into sixty languages, films, comic books—even a recent recasting of the story in postcolonial Algeria. No author, no matter how powerful or influential, controls the fate of his or her work. At a certain point, a book leaves the author’s purview for points unknown. In the best cases, when the life of a book lasts for many generations, whatever the writer might have thought about what she or he was doing joins a hundred other voices and visions. The life of The Stranger has gone well beyond Camus’s own life, cut abruptly short by an auto accident in 1960, when he was only forty-­six. It shows no signs of dying: seventy-­four years after its first publication, and over a century after Camus’s birth, over 10.3 million copies of The Stranger have sold in France alone.8 As long as people keep reading novels, the The Stranger will live on: that’s more of a guarantee of an afterlife than any author, and most books, can hope for.\n\nFrance and North Africa (July 1940 - November 1942)\n\nOccupied Zone Free Zone Demarcation Line PARIS\n\nClermontFerrand\n\nBay of Biscay\n\nChambonsur-Lignon Sisteron Nice Cannes Cap d’Ail\n\nMe Aïn-el-Turck\n\nAix-lesBains\n\nLyon\n\nditerranean\n\nTipasa Marengo\n\nSea\n\nALGIERS\n\nOran\n\n0\n\n0\n\n250 km 250 mi\n\nFrance and North Africa (July 1940–­November 1942).

Into the fire went letters from girlfriends, from teachers, from school chums. It was an unexpected act of destruction for the young man who vowed in his notebook to produce an œuvre, a body of literature, within two years.1 He underlined the word œuvre with a thick stroke of his pen, three times. He burned the letters in October 1939, a month after France declared war on Germany. Troops were mobilized, waiting on the Maginot Line. Albert Camus, unfit for military service, journalist at a newspaper about to be shut down by the government, was staying with his mother in the apartment where he’d lived for the first seventeen years of his life. A three-­room flat on the rue de Lyon in Belcourt, the working-­class neighborhood of Algiers. The place was sparsely furnished, with shared toilets on the landing—­ impoverished, even by the standards of working-­class Europeans in Algeria. His brother, three years older, had married and moved downtown; his grandmother was dead. Only his mother remained, and his Uncle Étienne, both of them deaf and nearly mute. The flat was a shabby, silent place. Albert Camus was twenty-­five years old that October 1939. His hooded eyes were grayish green and his brown hair was combed straight back, emphasizing his high forehead. If you had to guess a nationality, you might see something Spanish in his prideful gaze— his mother’s people were from Minorca, one of the Balearic Islands. 7\n\n8 · Chapter 1\n\nAfter work he favored fashionably baggy high-­waisted trousers and plaid shirts, but in his job as a reporter he was never without a coat and a tie, and a trenchcoat or tweed overcoat. His face was handsome, but not so handsome as to be uninteresting. Something horsey and asymmetrical about his face, despite his fine features, gave him an expressive force that moved deftly from comic to tragic, from gangster to prince. His scrawny chest, his long legs and arms, his broad hands and physical grace made him seem taller than five feet eight. He was a passionate, deliberate young man whose energy overflowed the small rooms and low ceilings of his childhood. He dragged out the two trunks of correspondence he had left in the apartment for safekeeping, set himself up in front of the tiny stove in the empty parlor, and fed the pages to the flames in crumpled heaps. “I have five years less weighing on my heart,”2 he wrote to Francine Faure, his fiancée, after the bonfire did its work. It must have taken him a long time. Five years in the life of an ambitious young writer means a lot of paper. That apartment was the place where he felt most deeply, where he’d honed his sense of observation, his ear for language, and his sense of what he began to call, from the wisdom of his twenty-­five years, the absurd. He had studied the absurd in philosophy class, but his own sense of the concept came from his own body, from an illness contracted at age seventeen that threatened his sensual delight in the world around him. All men were condemned to death, some sooner than others. It was absurd not only that life was finite but also that humans were meaningless before the physical world. He was determined that his first important artistic creations be born out of these simple truths.3 · In the jargon of the colonies, you would say that Albert Camus came of age in a world of petits blancs (little white men) or petits colons (small-­time settlers): “poor white trash” would be too harsh a translation for an expression that meant a working-­class European who was neither a colonizer—a big landowner—nor a disenfranchised\n\nA Bonfire · 9\n\nnative. He was part of a settler class, at the bottom of the European hierarchy but with privileges of race and citizenship virtually unknown to the native population. He grew up in Algiers, a city of mixed ethnicities—Spanish, French, Arab, Berber, Jewish—in a country conquered in 1830, which France had not only colonized but annexed, turning the territory into three départements (states). Though technically they were living in France, most Algerians, whatever their ethnicity, had never seen the mainland. That was the case for Camus’s father, Lucien, who saw France for the first time as a soldier in the Battle of the Marne, where he promptly lost his life. Albert was less than a year old. His father’s death made him a “pupil of the nation”—a scholarship student. His mother worked as a cleaning lady; his uncle made barrels. School gave him his chance. A primary school teacher named Louis Germain recognized his talent and talked his grandmother, the real head of household, into letting him go on to secondary school rather than start an apprenticeship like his brother Lucien. For a boy from this family, from this neighborhood, going on to lycée was an almost unheard-­of step, transporting him into a totally unfamiliar environment. Albert Camus was a child who could barely sit still, whose exuberance in class, on the soccer field, at the beach, was exceptional. He was a force of nature, physically unstoppable until, in 1930, at age seventeen, he began to cough up blood. He’d contracted tuberculosis. He was sent to live with his uncle Gustave Acault, a butcher who had a ground-­floor flat on the rue Languedoc with a large library and a courtyard garden. His uncle’s comfortable home became a refuge for Camus, the place where he began to read seriously and where he could eat regular portions of red meat, considered essential for a cure. He was told he might die, and if he were lucky, he faced a lifetime of repeated treatments: months of bed rest, x-­rays, and injections to collapse the affected lung so that it might heal. The diagnosis coincided with his most formative intellectual relationship. In 1930, Camus met Jean Grenier, his lycée and then his university teacher, who guided his early reading and encouraged him to take the double path of philosophy and literature. Writing be-\n\n10 · Chapter 1\n\ncame essential, a conquest of the silence he grew up with and a compensation for the breath that began to elude him. Still only seventeen, he wrote literature and music criticism in a student magazine, Sud, with an acumen beyond his years, and he started to draft the barely disguised scenes from his childhood that he would transform, over the next seven years, into a first collection of personal essays, The Wrong Side and the Right Side. He shared his work in progress before it was published with a few loved ones but especially with Jean Grenier, who gave him a steady supply of novels to inspire him. When Camus first discovered Proust’s account of his wealthy childhood and Gide’s self-­conscious intellectual games, he feared that only the rich could become writers. Then Grenier gave him La Douleur, published in 1930 by a little-­known twenty-­three-­year-­old writer named André de Richaud. La Douleur—“grief ” in English—is the story of a World War I widow, her loving son, and the German prisoner of war who becomes a deadly wedge between them. The plot, driven by the widow’s guilty, sensual longings, ends in betrayal and tragedy. Camus was captivated by the desperate love of mother and son and by an aura of misery that permeates the book—not the economic misery he knew so well, but the moral misery of desperate people. He considered La Douleur his license to write, to let the circumstances and feelings of his childhood guide his creative work. Later he went back to Gide and Proust with enthusiasm, but he remained an anxious reader of fiction. When he discovered a writer he loved, he was often struck with a wave of envy, wondering if there was anything more for him to say.4 As he dreamed about what it would take to become a real writer, he approached philosophy as a discipline. In the 1930s, French lycées and universities transmitted a brand of continental philosophy that was a close cousin to literature. In courses such as Jean Grenier’s survey on esthetic creation, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Bergson, and Kierkegaard nourished Camus’s thinking about a godless world, and a world of forms. Philosophy also seemed the best path to a stable teaching career. Grenier, who wrote stylish, atmospheric essays for\n\nA Bonfire · 11\n\nthe best literary magazines in Paris, clearly had time to teach and to write, and so would he. Camus finished his advanced work in philosophy—the equivalent of a master’s degree—at the University of Algiers in 1935, with a thesis on two African philosophers, the Greek Plotinus, and the early Christian Saint Augustine. He sympathized with the tubercular Plotinus, and even more with the sensual but disciplined Saint Augustine. Though he refers in the thesis to Augustine’s Confessions, and to the use Augustine makes of his personal experiences, nowhere in this academic study does Camus mention the detail that links the fourth-­century Augustine, in word and deed, to Camus’s twentieth-­century Meursault, but it must have lodged in a corner of his imagination: miserable over the death of his mother, Augustine refuses to weep at her funeral, and looks for a cure to his sorrow by going to the baths.5 Camus’s education in philosophy lacked the depth and rigor it might have had in the Paris academy. But the fact that Camus never quite conformed to formal philosophical modes of reasoning was also a feature of his character. Nietzsche was the writer who counted most for Camus in those years, in style and substance; he admired Nietzsche, he wrote, as a poet-­philosopher, “susceptible of engaging in contradictions.”6 He might as well have described his own love of paradox, his attraction to images and intuitions above and beyond structured argument. Even when he still hoped that a career as a philosophy professor could buy him freedom for his creative work, he made a note to himself: “If you want to be a philosopher, write novels.”7 · The year he finished his philosophy thesis, 1935, Camus’s literary ambitions were sparked by a visit. André Malraux, the author of Man’s Fate and one of Camus’s literary and political heroes, flew to Algiers on a hydroplane to address a gathering of antifascist intellectuals. Malraux spoke in a movie theater in Camus’s neighborhood to an\n\n12 · Chapter 1\n\nenthusiastic crowd who greeted the writer with raised fists, signifying their shared commitment to the Popular Front against fascism.8 When Camus was a child, he used to go to movie houses in Belcourt with his domineering grandmother, who insisted that he shout the subtitles of silent films into her ear, since she couldn’t read and couldn’t hear very well, what with the piano and the moviegoers’ loud reactions.9 Those were humiliating memories. By 1935, he was just beginning his own career as a writer and a political activist, and his relationship to the places he associated with his childhood was changing. Camus may have had the chance to shake Malraux’s hand that day in Belcourt, but that was all. Only in his wildest dreams could he imagine he would ever see Malraux again. · By October 1939, when he burned his letters, a hopeful period of political and cultural activism was behind him: he had believed in the Popular Front against fascism, but it failed to stave off Hitler’s march through Europe. There was now little left for him in Algiers. With the start of the war in September, between the pressures of censorship and a dwindling paper stock, Alger-­Républicain, the newspaper that had galvanized his energies since 1938, was reduced to a two-­page bulletin called Le Soir Républicain, distributed locally and regularly censored for its antiwar positions. Camus, the solitary editor-­in-­ chief, was considered a security risk by the government. He’d applied to compete for a state-­sponsored teaching position, the logical next step after his philosophy degree, but he was declared ineligible because of his tuberculosis—one lung infected when he was seventeen and the other lung when he was twenty-­one. The government didn’t want to invest in a teacher who might not be around for very long, and official policy meant that no one with a contagious disease could join the teaching corps. The academic degree that should have led him to a stable career was worth nothing.10 The disease also disqualified him from military service while his comrades at the newspaper, and his brother, had all gone off to fight. He canceled a summer trip to Greece because of the war; turned down a temporary\n\nA Bonfire · 13\n\nteaching position, and used the time instead to finish a first draft of a play about the Roman emperor Caligula, whose story he knew from his studies. He had plenty of time on his hands to ruminate, and to imagine the future. Over the course of five years, Albert Camus lived in at least six different houses and apartments in Algiers. He even married, but it didn’t last. In 1939 he was separated, though still not divorced. After his wife came a new girlfriend, followed by others. Now he had reached a threshold in more ways than one. He had met a brilliant math student and pianist named Francine Faure. She lived in Oran, a smaller city to the west of Algiers, and her intelligent seriousness, the high standards she set for him, made him see himself in a new light. Telling her that he had burned his letters from other women was a way to reassure her, and perhaps himself, that his affairs were a thing of the past.11 There were personal reasons to burn letters, and plenty of political reasons as well. In August 1939, following the Hitler-­Stalin pact, the French government declared Communist Party membership illegal, and although Camus was expelled from the party in 1937, he feared he was under surveillance. He had begun his work for the Communists going door to door in Belcourt to recruit Muslim members. But Moscow was concerned about the coming war, and activism in favor of indigenous Algerians was not a priority. Camus was purged—a report to the Comintern said he was a “Trotskyist agitator.”12 He found a better outlet for his beliefs as a journalist, and was well known for the positions he defended in Alger-­Républicain, for his attacks on the colonial government’s heartless policies, and for his pacifism. Those positions were reason enough to add political correspondence with his university teachers and his friends to the flames. The past five years had been mixed, including gratifying work in the theater, where he founded two companies with friends, but also a miserable trip to central Europe, which ended his first marriage. He wrote a story called “Death in the Soul,” about lonely days spent in a rundown Prague hotel and concluded, with the sense of paradox already so like him: “Any country where I am not bored is a country\n\n14 · Chapter 1\n\nthat has nothing to teach me.”13 Camus found a home with friends from the theater after his separation, and he spent an idyllic period living with them in a magical house in the heights of Algiers. There on the chemin du Sidi Brahim, in the place he called “The House Above the World,” he first tried his hand at writing a novel. A Happy Death followed the story of a tubercular young man who commits murder for freedom. Camus wrote, rewrote, and finally abandoned the manuscript. His newspaper work covering trials turned out to be better preparation for The Stranger than this first jagged attempt at fiction. A journalist, a political activist, a writer, a man of the theater, a lover, briefly a husband, a son to his mother, a child of his poor neighborhood, Belcourt—by the time he was twenty-­five Camus had played many roles. That was the problem. “I haven’t kept the same face for any two people,” he wrote Francine, in the tone of melancholy self-­deprecation that would be a constant of his character. “I have never made anyone happy who loved me. . . .” And he added: “To really do it right, I’d need to burn your letters as well, since what good are these pieces of evidence? I was about to do it, and I don’t know what prevented me.”14 Even as he played on her sentiments, he was trying to stop playing, to strip himself down to the essential elements, to get rid of the pose, the décor. He was ready, he wrote, to destroy even the few precious letters he’d received from well-­known writers like Henry de Montherlant and Max Jacob, but he had to think about it. Those belonged to literature, not life, and he wasn’t giving up on literature. In two months, after the demise of Le Soir Républicain, he would be without work and without prospects. But he was already the author of two books—The Wrong Side and the Right Side, his essays reflecting on childhood and failed love in a discreet, melancholy first person, and Nuptials, a joyous ode to the Algerian landscape, including his beloved ruins at Tipasa.15 Both books were published locally at a small press started by Edmond Charlot, another student in Jean Grenier’s circle. Print runs for the books were tiny—350 copies each—and the reviews nearly nonexistent. But Monther-\n\nA Bonfire · 15\n\nlant, the great Henry de Montherlant, wrote from Paris in a dashing stylized hand to praise Nuptials: “I feel closer to what you’ve written than to anything else I’ve read about Algeria.” And if that wasn’t praise enough, he added, “you write the way I want to write.”16 Montherlant hoped a future volume would be published in Paris, so that Camus would have a larger audience. In the end, Camus saved the letter. What Camus saved from the flames that day in October was his literary future: Montherlant’s words of praise; the notebooks where he jotted down images and ideas; the manuscript of his failed experiment in fiction, A Happy Death. He was at work on three new projects in various states of draft, all of them related in his mind to the concept of the Absurd, the first “negative” phase of his ambitious life plan as a writer. He hoped to create three books in an “absurd cycle,” working in three distinct genres. On his desk was the rough draft of his play Caligula, still little more than a one-­man show, culminating in a scene where the murderous, incestuous young emperor stands before a mirror, contemplating his dreadful freedom. There were notes for a book about other struggles with godless freedom in history and literature, which he was calling The Myth of Sisyphus. Most important of all was a new novel, barely begun. He thought he might call it The Indifferent Man.17 Like Caligula and The Myth of Sisyphus, it explored one man’s “negative truth.” It was his second try at fiction, on the heels of a frustrating defeat, but the process already felt different. Instead of chasing down the words, they were coming at him. Between the day he burned his letters and the day he left for Paris five months later, Albert Camus finished a first chapter of the novel that became The Stranger. Camus and The Stranger were beginning a long and arduous voyage, and the manuscript wouldn’t leave his side until it was done. Fiction hadn’t come easily to him. Had the bonfire stripped him down to his essence and allowed him to begin writing, or was it an inkling of the universal bonfire to come? What had changed?\n\n2 From Belcourt to Hydra\n\nTo understand the talented young man who first sat down to write The Stranger in the summer of 1939, it helps to return to the five years that Camus wanted to burn out of his existence—years of dizzying change that began with his marriage to Simone Hié. He met her while taking classes for his undergraduate degree at the University of Algiers in 1933. With her mauve and blue eye shadow, her fake lashes and slinky see-­through dresses, Simone played the vamp to Albert’s man-­about-­town. When they married a year later, he was twenty-­one and she, twenty. Her flamboyant performance covered a starker reality: Simone’s mother, a successful ophthalmologist, had given her daughter morphine to ease her terrible menstrual cramps, and she had become addicted to the drug. Camus’s friends warned him that the marriage to Simone was nothing but a rescue mission. Louis Bénisti told him he was acting like an angel, or a Saint Bernard puppy.1 Yves Bourgeois, who traveled with the couple, remembered her bitterly: a “professional seducer . . . vocation, ‘femme fatale.’”2 But seduction is not a one-­way street, and the fact that Simone had been engaged to his friend Max-­Pol Fouchet and that Camus won her away added an element of triumph that intensified his fervor. Simone was as glamorous as a character in a book—she was Camus’s version of Breton’s Nadja, a seductress-­waif.3 And for a young man determined to become a writer, she appeared to be an ideal writer’s wife—a mystery to behold, rather than a partner. Camus’s uncle Gustave Acault, who heartily disapproved of Si‑ 16\n\nFrom Belcourt to Hydra · 17\n\nmone, gave him an ultimatum—either leave her or lose his financial support. Of the two families, only Simone’s mother, Martha Sogler, seemed enthusiastic about the match, which she saw as her daughter’s salvation. She set the newlyweds up in a little villa with the silly name Villa Frais Cottage on rue no. 12, Parc d’Hydra, a new housing development in Hydra, a suburb in the heights of Algiers. It was a fancy European neighborhood where Camus had often visited his lycée teacher Jean Grenier, who lived in a large villa on rue no. 9.4 Grenier knew how far a climb Camus had made. At the start of Camus’s long illness, the teacher took a taxi to the Belcourt address on file for his best student. He found the boy, speechless and embarrassed, in a flat whose poverty shocked him. The rue de Lyon, a busy artery of working-­class Belcourt, was unfamiliar territory to the dapper professor.5 · With his marriage in 1934, Camus found himself transported to his teacher’s neighborhood. Hydra represented bourgeois success but also the denial of what Camus loved most in Algiers—the smell of the ocean and a view of the bay on nearly every street corner.6 In Hydra, when you reached the central commercial roundabout, La Placette, you knew you were high up in the city, but the prospect, beyond the shops, was nothing but walled-­off villas in pristine white stretching out in spokes, and thick hedges of laurel and ­bougainvillea. · Camus relied on his mother-­in-­law for support, and when Simone went to a clinic to detox, he stayed in Martha Sogler’s apartment in another neighborhood on a hill, Les Sept Merveilles (the seven marvels), an enticing name. On Dr. Sogler’s bookshelves were issues of the surrealist magazine Le Minotaure and a copy of the death mask of the legendary “inconnue de la Seine,” the anonymous woman fished out of the Seine River around 1900, whose mysterious visage, smiling with eyes closed, became an icon for surrealist artists\n\n18 · Chapter 2\n\nand writers. Dr. Sogler’s apartment was “a nest of luxury and avant-­ garde culture.”7 · During those brief years with Simone and her mother, Camus insinuated to friends that his own mother was off in Oran with relatives, recovering from an illness—which wasn’t true—as if he wanted to sweep Belcourt out of his existence.8 His mother-­in-­law was an eminent medical specialist, up to date on the latest from Paris: how could Camus not have wondered what it would have been like to have a mother like that? To have grown up in Les Sept Merveilles instead of in Belcourt? He tried many times to capture in essay form the strange dependence he felt on his mother, and the difficulty of explaining anything about her to his entourage. This fragment, never published, was found inside a folder with the manuscript of A Happy Death: One day he fell gravely ill. Since that day, age 17, he lived with an uncle. His mother hadn’t taken care of him. Indifference? No but a strange personality, almost supernatural. She was from another world . . . The attitude of this mother towards her son: a mixture of wrongs and rights. Though she had neglected him, and especially had neglected his need for warmth and protection, she hadn’t abandoned him. To the woman he loved, the son told a very different story. A story made of truths but distorted, arranged. A false history that didn’t explain the reality. Why? Secret resentment. Pride especially. Pride.9\n\nThe fragment, for all its frank simplicity, is beautifully complex. The young man from Belcourt who won the hand of Dr. Sogler’s daughter is proud, and knows he’s lying. He’s unable to tell the truth about his mother to the bourgeois woman he loves. In a later draft about his childhood entitled “Voices from the Poor\n\nFrom Belcourt to Hydra · 19\n\nQuarter,” written during his marriage to Simone and dedicated “to my wife,” he backs off from shame and ventures into the safer domain of fiction: If the child comes in then, he sees her thin shape and bony shoulders, and stops, afraid. He is beginning to feel a lot of things. He is scarcely aware of his own existence. But this animal silence makes him want to weep in pain. He feels sorry for his mother, is this the same as loving her? She has never hugged or kissed him, for she wouldn’t know how. He stands for a long time watching her. Feeling separate from her, he becomes conscious of his suffering. She does not hear him, for she is deaf.10\n\nPutting mother and child together in a room, he is able to let the scene express his feelings. Perhaps it was from his mother’s silence that he derived his first lesson as a fiction writer: the idea, common currency among novelists today, that there is more power in showing than in telling, more emotion in silence than in speech. · Camus’s literary efforts were slowed by the pull of political commitment. He joined the Communist Party in 1935, urged on rather cynically by Grenier, who hated the Communists but thought party membership was a rite of passage for any ambitious young man, and by a school friend, Claude de Fréminville.11 In 1936, Camus spoke at meetings of his cell, the Amsterdam-­Pleyel Committee, to enthusiastic applause. He argued that fascism was a generator of violence and of war, and urged support of the Popular Front. A year after Malraux had mesmerized the crowds at the movie house in Belcourt, Camus gave a speech at the movie theater in the neighborhood called the Ruisseau. He warned the audience to beware of the fascist manipulation of language, of “the power of certain words like ‘fatherland,’ ‘glory,’ ‘honor’—synonyms of the bank vault.” Editorializing came more easily to him than fiction. He was a natural whose speeches were limpid, pedagogical without being pedantic. A police\n\n20 · Chapter 2\n\ninformant always filed a report on the Amsterdam-­Pleyel Committee meetings, quoting Camus and the other speakers and gauging the audience’s response. A typical meeting might have an attendance of around 150 people—140 European men, four or five Arab men, two or three European women.12 · Camus understood his work with the Communist Party as a cultural front against fascism, an appendage supporting the political Popular Front. The various committees and organizations he managed had their equivalents in metropolitan France. But the cultural activism he loved most came from his theater companies, where he thrived as a director and an actor. Following Malraux’s dramatic speech in Belcourt, he adapted Malraux’s antifascist novel, Days of Wrath, for Le Théâtre du Travail. With three friends, he wrote a play about a miner’s strike in Spain and its tragic repression. When the performance was canceled by the right-­wing mayor of Algiers, Camus presented the play in a public reading to a large crowd, the friends of the theater. Soon he was named general secretary of a cultural center, the Maison de la Culture, where he lectured on how the left might wrest the idea of a Mediterranean culture from Charles Maurras and the far right, who had hijacked it with their notion of a “Latin Genius.”13 Camus traveled in those years in a left intellectual milieu, whose informal headquarters was Edmond Charlot’s bookstore, Les Vraies Richesses. Charlot, who was even younger than Camus, was the friend who published Camus’s The Wrong Side and the Right Side and Nuptials along with books by Jean Grenier and Gabriel Audisio; he shared with them a vision of a vibrant Mediterranean culture. As soon as Camus published with the Éditions Charlot, he began to read manuscripts for Edmond—the beginning of his life-­long career as a book editor. If you spotted the young man in those years—­ meeting with his friends at the Brasserie de la Renaissance across from the University of Algiers, rehearsing with his theater company\n\nFrom Belcourt to Hydra · 21\n\ndown by the port—it would have been impossible to see the traces of his impoverished childhood. In May of 1935, soon after his marriage to Simone Hié, Camus began to jot down his insights in notebooks that would nurture every project to come. In a first entry, he reflected on those origins. Could he stay true to the poverty in which he had been born without giving in to romanticism, and could he ever convey the strangeness of his relationship to his mother? “A certain number of years lived in misery are all it takes to construct a sensibility. In this particular case, the bizarre feeling a son has for his mother constitutes his entire sensibility.”14 That summer, when the university wasn’t in session, he tutored adult students in philosophy and got a desk job with the government administration; he even worked for the City of Algiers department of motor vehicle registration—all to make ends meet. He was fed up with his exile to the heights of the city, and after a relapse of his tuberculosis in July kept him bedridden, he wrote to his teacher Jean Grenier, who was vacationing in France, “I’m getting back to work to dissipate this enforced idleness that chills me and also to escape the evening hours you know so well in Hydra Park.”15 · In the summer of 1936, during a trip to Eastern Europe with Simone, he intercepted a letter from her doctor in Algiers, who was also her supplier, and who, he now realized, had been her lover for quite some time. For the prideful Camus, it was a deep wound—the worst humiliation of his life. The marriage was already stormy but now any future was out of the question. He wrote to Grenier upon his return to Algiers, “I will no longer be living in Hydra.”16 Camus separated from Simone in the fall of 1936; it took another year for him to separate from the Communist Party. He published The Wrong Side and the Right Side in May 1937, with a dedication to Jean Grenier. The book was an apprenticeship, using the first person while maintaining a curious distance from himself in evocative\n\n22 · Chapter 2\n\nsketches. These included “Death in the Soul,” the piece inspired by his unhappy trip to Eastern Europe with Simone, and “Between Yes and No,” which incorporated the passage from “Voices from the Poor Quarter” about the child and his mother. The emotional power of his description, its evocation of estrangement and of a silence by now so far removed from his busy everyday life, continued to inhabit every book he wrote.\n\n3 A First Try\n\nAlong the boulevard Telemly in Algiers, where on a clear day you can see the bay and the mountains of Kabylia, is a residential neighborhood that has always attracted artists and intellectuals. Like Hydra, Telemly is considered to be in “the heights” of the city, but beyond the boulevard itself, there is higher still to go. In that place above the world, twenty-­three-­year-­old Albert Camus put his failed marriage behind him, recovered his joie de vivre, and dreamed that he could be a novelist. In 1935 and still today, if you cross the street at the “Algeria” apartment complex, built in 1935, and make your way along the west side of the park,1 a long sloping greenway set into the hillside, you can follow the Chemin du Sidi Brahim, a remnant of an ancient walkway from the Ottoman era, up a series of terraced steps that hug the length of garden, then leave it far behind. “A steep path, beginning in olive trees and ending in olive trees”;2 indeed, the way up was so steep, Camus wrote in his notebooks, there was no climbing it without feeling as if you had made a conquest.3 In the fall of 1936, when he first started taking the Chemin du Sidi Brahim, he was in remission from his second bout of tuberculosis. Every time he reached the top of that hill, it was a victory of his growing stamina over the disease. He would climb one set of steps, then another, until he came to a series of looping streets named for nut and fruit trees: the rue des Amandiers, the rue des Oliviers, the rue des Bananiers. There, in what felt like a timeless village, were modest houses whose 23\n\n24 · Chapter 3\n\nterraces took advantage of the skyline, and whose tiny gardens had just enough room for two or three trees and a wisteria bush.4 Marguerite Dobrenn and Jeanne Sicard, friends from Oran, members of Camus’s theater troupe and comrades in the Communist Party, rented the first floor of a house at the corner of the Chemin du Sidi Brahim and the rue des Amandiers: “a kind of balloon-­gondola suspended in the brilliant sky over the motley dance of the world.”5 In the months following his separation from Simone, Camus spent more and more time in the place they baptized “the House Above the World,” calling his roommates his “children” and himself “their boy.” Marguerite Dobrenn and Jeanne Sicard were a couple, and in their affectionate company Camus experienced for the first time a close platonic friendship with women. A fourth housemate joined the group. Christiane Galindo, a sensual free spirit, became his companion for hiking in the Roman ruins at Tipasa. She worked as a secretary in town and soon began to type Camus’s manuscripts. They doted on two housecats Camus dubbed Cali and Gula, mascots for the play he was writing, Caligula. This was a period of enormous activity for the young intellectual: adapting plays for his theater troupe, making political speeches at party meetings and at the Maison de la Culture, starting a second theater troupe after his break with the Communist Party. In the fall of 1937 he took a day job as an assistant at an Institute of Meteorology, measuring barometric pressure. When he was in the House Above the World, chaos retreated and the world itself became a character: “there are days when the world lies, days when it tells the truth. It tells the truth tonight—and with what insistent and sad beauty.”6 It felt like the perfect spot from which to write a novel. So he tried. In 1937, after the publication of The Wrong Side and the Right Side, Camus began working in earnest on the novel he called A Happy Death, living sometimes in the house and sometimes in a barren room he rented in the center of town, furnished only with a long trunk—bed by night, desk by day.7 The premise of the novel was inspired by his literary hero André Malraux, whose Man’s Fate, about an uprising in revolutionary Shanghai, was the cult novel of the Popular Front. In the first scene of Man’s Fate, an insurgent\n\nA First Try · 25\n\nplunges a knife into the heart of a government authority caught unawares in his sleep.8 Camus began A Happy Death with another kind of liberating murder: the morally restless Patrice Mersault befriends a philosophically minded paraplegic, Zagreus (named after the Greek god). He takes Zagreus’s gun and shoots him, steals his vast fortune from a safe, and makes it look like a suicide. This successful murder sets the plot in motion, because once Patrice is rich, he is free to seek happiness anywhere. It is a truism among writers of fiction that to succeed, a novel needs to take flight, to leave the real world for a specific flight of fancy, with its own logic and boundaries. The freedom Camus gave to his protagonist, and his desire to use every landscape and every important person he knew, made it hard for him to set limits for his story. All the characters were based on people in his life: his mother is a partial model for a deformed and diabetic mother who lives and dies in a shabby apartment in Belcourt; a deaf-­mute neighbor who works as a barrel maker is based on his Uncle Étienne; Marthe, based on Simone, is a seductress who makes Patrice jealous; and Camus’s housemates Marguerite, Jeanne, and Christiane become Rose, Claire, and Catherine. There are at least four settings: Patrice goes on a long voyage to Europe, stopping in Lyon, Prague, Breslau, Vienna, Genoa. Returning from Italy, he moves into the House Above the World—which keeps its real name—and realizes he has practically forgotten that he murdered a man. He finds happiness temporarily but longs for a more solitary, meditative life. So he moves near the sea, to Chenoua, by the Roman ruins of Tipasa. He acquires a wife, Lucienne, and befriends a doctor. Then in an unprepared and hurried ending, Mersault succumbs to tuberculosis and dies a happy man. Everything that didn’t work in A Happy Death was a cautionary tale for the novels to come, a challenge to approach the same themes with authority, to chase away the easy sentiment. A Happy Death is full of ruminations on being a man, on the difficulty of sexual love, on the beauty of youth and the beauty of the world. Patrice is vain (“His hair fell in a tangle over his forehead, down to the two deep creases between his eyebrows, which gave him a grave, tender ex-\n\n26 · Chapter 3\n\npression, he realized”); romantic (he felt “an enormous silence in himself as he faced the swelling waves and the steep hillsides”); but also sarcastic—he tells Marthe, who wants to know if he loves her, that love is for old people. Camus wrote about the life he was leading at the time he was writing—the pleasant camaraderie of the house, the day trips to Tipasa, the travel in Eastern Europe and Italy. He wanted to wrestle all of it into fiction, without deciding what was most important or how the pieces fit together. His manuscript was an airplane packed with cargo, too heavy to fly. Only the ending of the novel, sudden as it is, harbors a deeper fear. Anyone who has struggled with the symptoms of tuberculosis has enough material to write a death scene. Tuberculosis, before the advent of antibiotics, guaranteed an early death in the majority of cases, and the dread and curiosity provoked by the diagnosis were powerful incentives for fiction. Camus wanted the reader to feel the life go out of Mersault, to experience the very instance of his death: Slowly, as though it came from his stomach, there rose inside him a stone which approached his throat. He breathed faster and faster, higher and higher. He looked at Lucienne. He smiled without wincing, and this smile, too, came from within himself. He threw himself back on the bed and felt the slow ascent within him. He looked at Lucienne’s swollen lips and, behind her, the smile of the earth. He looked at them with the same eyes, the same desire. “In a minute, in a second,” he thought. The ascent stopped. And stone among the stones, he returned in the joy of his heart to the truth of the motionless worlds.9\n\nCamus sent the manuscript to Jean Grenier. Camus burned Grenier’s response with the rest of his correspondence in October, 1939—burned the harsh words of reproach. We know how harsh the letter must have been because the fussy and often disapproving teacher carefully saved Camus’s response:\n\nA First Try · 27\n\nFirst of all, thank you. Yours is the only voice today that I can heed with profit. What you say always revolts me for a few hours. But this forces me to reflect and to understand. . . . Today what you are saying is absolutely right. I took great pains over this book. . . . I am still happy that certain parts please you, happy to have made progress. I have to confess that I am not indifferent to this failure. I don’t need to tell you that I am not satisfied with the life I’m leading. And so I had given great importance to the novel. Clearly I was wrong.10\n\nThen, as he poured out his heart for many pages, Camus asked Grenier a question that gave his teacher enormous power over his future: Before going back to work, there is one thing I’d like to know from you because you’re the only one who can tell me straight: Do you sincerely believe I should continue writing?\n\nAfter such an abysmal failure, he had to ask. But however much he looked to Grenier to judge his work, Camus realized he could only answer the question for himself: I’m asking myself with quite some anxiety. You understand that it’s not about making this into a profession or extracting gains from it. I don’t have many pure things in my life. Writing is one of them. But at the same time, I have enough experience to know that it’s better to be a good bourgeois than a bad intellectual or a mediocre writer.\n\n“A bad intellectual, a mediocre writer”: he could fail either as a thinker, or as an artist, or both. It would be awful to fail. But he hung on to a basic belief, a knowledge that in writing he found the “pure thing” missing in the rest of his life. He recovered from his disappointment and prepared to revise his novel one more time.\n\n4 The Novel He Didn’t Know He Was Writing Camus was a craftsman who believed in the benefits of rewriting, in literary sweat equity: “Rewrite. The effort always gets you something, whatever it may be. For those who don’t succeed, it’s a question of laziness.”1 After the discouraging response to A Happy Death from Jean Grenier, followed by his teacher’s suggestions as to how he might proceed, the dutiful student went back to his manuscript.2 He was working from a lot of little slips of paper, from other manuscripts, from images and thoughts jotted down. But no matter how beautiful the sentences, the novel wouldn’t take off. He turned to his notebooks to think about his structure and admonish himself to rewrite. These work-­in-­progress notebooks tell a frustrating story: there was a first outline, then a second. He told himself to recycle material from “Death in the Soul” that he had published in The Wrong Side and the Right Side, inspired by his miserable experience in a Prague hotel.3 Another year passed. Finally, without saying when it happened, Camus abandoned the manuscript of A Happy Death. It might be truer to say that the manuscript abandoned him. To the people around him, his family, his friends in the theater and in the Party, the drama would have been invisible. Many people observed him; they knew him as a charming and seductive man who had separated from his wife and was making a name for himself in politics and theater. He was ambitious and he was busy, rushing from play rehearsals to political and editorial meetings, to odd jobs. For Camus, what was happening in his solitary hours was a 28\n\nThe Novel He Didn’t Know He Was Writing · 29\n\ngently unfolding mystery he wouldn’t have been able to describe. At his writing table, surrounded by piles of books, smoking Bastos, his ever-­present Algerian cigarettes, he was more and more surprised. As he tried to figure out the plot, characters, and locale of the novel that wasn’t working, elements of a completely different book began to creep into his notebooks. The ambitious writer who wanted to control every aspect of his craft found himself confronted with the unexpected. The novelist Catherine Lépront once compared the characters in a novel to the neighbors upstairs: you can’t see them at first, you don’t know exactly what they’re doing, but you can hear them stomping around.4 In Camus’s case, there were already plenty of upstairs neighbors making a commotion in A Happy Death when suddenly his ear became attuned to different footsteps. On their own, the characters of The Stranger entered the apartment of his mind and made themselves heard. The process began in the summer of 1936, when he returned from his trip to Eastern Europe and ended his marriage to Simone Hié. After one of his attempts at an outline for A Happy Death, Camus imagines Patrice, his main character, recounting a story about a man condemned to death. And Patrice says, “I see this man. He is inside me. And every word he says grips my heart. He is living and breathing with me. He is afraid with me.”5 Camus was learning to use his notebooks as guidebooks to his instincts as a writer. Imagining that Patrice feels this other character, this man condemned to death, entering his body, his breath, was the clue that would lead him to a new character. Camus had no notion that there was a second novel in him, and yet the sentences were a perfect premonition of what would indeed come to pass: a man condemned to death named “Meursault” instead of “Mersault” would grow into the main character of The Stranger. The substitution of one name for the other would take a very long time. In April 1937, Camus wrote in his notebook, “Story: the man who doesn’t want to justify himself. He prefers the idea others have of him. He dies, only he retains the consciousness of his truth—vanity\n\n30 · Chapter 4\n\nof this consolation.”6 Meursault’s principal character trait is born— the refusal to bend to society’s expectations. Two months later, in June 1937, he imagines a priest visiting a man condemned to death. “And each time,” Camus writes in his notebook, “resistance in the man who doesn’t want this easy way out, who wants to savor his fear. He dies without a word, his eyes filled with tears.”7 An atheist on death row, dying in silence: it is the ending for another novel. July 1937 was a turning point. Camus and his closest friends had broken with the Communists, and his first collection of essays, The Wrong Side and the Right Side, was in print. The press was silent about the book, except for a single article in the Oran Républicain, by a young man in Camus’s crowd, who said that he sounded too much like Jean Grenier.8 Camus decided to leave the heat of Algiers behind for a vacation in Marseille, then Paris. In the French capital, between visits to the Exposition Universelle and to the rue Mouffetard, which reminded him of Belcourt, he grasped the gist of that future novel and had a first awareness of what would become its title: “A man who looked for life where people usually find it (marriage, position, etc.), and who realizes suddenly, reading a fashion catalog, how he has been a stranger to his life. . . .”9 Paris, the unfamiliar city, clarified his vision. There’s only one place in the notebooks where Camus reflects upon the mysterious process by which a new book was coming into focus. This was after leaving Paris, en route to a mountain resort in Embrun, in the Alps—not quite a sanitarium but a place where he could rest and breathe easily. From his train compartment, with the green pastures and foothills rushing by him, he wrote about the way words or characters would rise up in him without his knowing why. “Sometimes I need to write things that escape me in part, but which are proof of precisely what within me is stronger than I am.”10 Pieces of The Stranger were bursting through his consciousness from a source that was becoming more and more accessible— first the voices, then the characters, then the stories. A lesser writer, annoyed or frightened, might have pushed those voices aside, because they didn’t fit.\n\nThe Novel He Didn’t Know He Was Writing · 31\n\nThere may have come a moment when Camus decided to welcome the incongruous images, and even began to invite them consciously. When he returned to Algiers, he was offered a job teaching grammar in a Foreign Legion outpost, Sidi-­bel-­Abbès. Turning it down was an act of faith in his future as a writer, and he wrote to his friend Jacques Heurgon: “It finally seems to me that I’ve made a wager that forces me to create something meaningful, otherwise my life will be totally absurd.”11 Notebook entries concerning A Happy Death continued in August and September 1937. In May 1938, he had an odd experience that turned out to be central to the novel he still didn’t know he was writing. His brother’s wife moved her grandmother to an old people’s home in Marengo, a town on the outskirts of Tipasa. When she died, Camus attended the burial.12 He wrote in the notebooks, in May and yet again in August, about a little old man, the fiancé of the old woman who had died, following the muddy funeral procession to the church and the cemetery.13 There was a scene in A Happy Death where Patrice Mersault buries his mother, but there was no Marengo, no old people’s home. On a June list of seven things to do that summer, Camus noted as item six “rewrite the novel” and as item seven, “The Absurd.” Did “rewrite the novel” mean revising A Happy Death one more time or starting another novel?14 It’s possible that Camus didn’t know. In a notebook entry written in the fall of 1938, Camus outlines “the story of R”—a glimpse of two characters who will become, in The Stranger, Raymond, Meursault’s neighbor, and Raymond’s Moorish mistress, who has no name. Camus loved to imitate the familiar patoùete, the particular slang and accent of the working-­class characters on the streets of Belcourt, and here was an opportunity to put his mimicry to work: Story of R. I knew a lady. She was for all intents and purposes my mistress. . . . I realized there was cheating going on: story of lottery tickets. . . . He asks for advice. He still thought “she was a good lay.” He wants a letter with a “kick in the pants” and “things\n\n32 · Chapter 4\n\nto make her sorry.” Ex: “all you want is to screw around, that’s all you care about.” “I hit her, but real gentle, you know what I mean? She yelled, I closed the shutters.”15\n\nCamus adds to this entry, in tiny letters: “C’est une arabe” (she is an Arab).16 It was an afterthought that would have momentous consequences for his unborn novel. And so the backbone of The Stranger emerged: the bonding of Meursault with his neighbor, Raymond the pimp, who will ask Meursault to write a letter to his Moorish mistress, part of a plan to punish her for her infidelity. Camus had found the larger social reality in which his novel could resonate: the tension between poor and rough-­edged Europeans and Arabs in Belcourt and neighboring Bab-­el-­Oued. He’d found a tone of voice he liked and got a glimpse of his plot, which connects the pimp to his narrator. Camus started developing a set of principles for his fiction. “The true work of art,” he writes, “is the one that says the least.”17 These were truths he had never articulated; his first try at a novel and his essays were lush with description. One of the problems with A Happy Death was Patrice’s constant ruminations and his tedious explanations of his state of mind, which gave the story a sentimental quality. “To write,” Camus now realized, “one must fall slightly short of the expression (rather than beyond it). No chit chat.”18 A single line, set apart in his notebook, became a motto for the work to come: “The dry heart of the creator.”19 If there was a point of no return, a moment when A Happy Death gave way to The Stranger, it came in the fall of 1938, in a notebook entry marked “22,” with no month. Camus wrote five sentences. It is tempting to say he unearthed them, for they landed on his page exactly as they would appear in print four years later, the first five sentences of The Stranger: Today, Maman died. Or yesterday maybe, I don’t know. I got a telegram from the home: “mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow.\n\nThe Novel He Didn’t Know He Was Writing · 33\n\nFaithfully yours.” That doesn’t mean anything. Maybe it was yes‑ terday.20\n\nCamus added no explanation of the paragraph in his notebook. He’d spent a day with his brother Lucien and Lucien’s wife at her grandmother’s funeral in Marengo, but that experience couldn’t have been more obscure, less connected to his personal dramas. Perhaps a distance from his sources was exactly what was missing from A Happy Death, exactly what he needed for his new fiction to take off. The other aspect of those sentences was fundamental: since 1936, Camus had been writing and rewriting a novel narrated in the third person, pouring emotion into his story to make it come alive. Now, two years later, he had come up with a new narrator, who said “I,” but coldly. A narrator with no resemblance to Camus. The day Camus wrote the first paragraph of The Stranger in his notebook, pieces of the novel already existed in his imagination. His narrator would have to make sense of all those pieces. A man who didn’t know which day his mother died and didn’t mind not knowing. Who had a way of talking that was almost mechanical, and strangely empty, given the circumstances. Gone was the pressure he’d felt writing A Happy Death to make Patrice Mersault appealing. The following spring, under the heading “brawl in Tolba,” he wrote another notebook entry that would go almost word for word into the mouth of Raymond Sintès, the pimp, and set a rhythm for his prose: The other guy says: “If you’re man enough you’ll get off that streetcar.” I said to him: “Take it easy.” He said, “You’re not a man.” So I got off and I said to him “Enough, you’d better or I’m gonna have to teach you a lesson.” And he says “you and who else.” So I let him have it.21\n\nIt was clear by then that The Stranger would not be set in the heights of the city, in the lovely house above the world, or in the Roman\n\n34 · Chapter 4\n\nruins at Tipasa. It would come from the streets of Belcourt, the place that harbored his earliest memories. A Happy Death was a labored effort to create a novel, but by listening to an inner voice, irrepressible, Camus had found another way. In letters, in interviews, and in his many literary essays to come, he rarely referred to A Happy Death, his unpublished manuscript.22\n\n5 A Reporter on the Beat\n\nAs the second novel began to emerge, how to make a living so he could keep writing? Camus’s meager 1,000 francs a month at the Institute of Meteorology weren’t enough.1 Martha Sogler, his mother-­in-­law, helped—a kind of alimony—as did Camus’s Uncle Acault, who hadn’t stayed angry with his nephew for long. In September 1938, a few weeks after he scribbled, “Today, Maman died,” in his notebook, a chance meeting and a job offer set his life on a new course. A man named Pascal Pia arrived in Algiers from Paris to start a newspaper. He interviewed Camus and hired him on the spot. If you had to compare Camus’s earliest mentors, men whose opinions were key in the years when he conceived and wrote The Stranger, it would be hard to place Jean Grenier and Pascal Pia in the same universe. Grenier was an elegant esthete, in his writing and in his looks. Short and compact, he had wavy black hair, sensual lips, and a distant gaze that reminded Camus of an oriental sage.2 He wore silk ties and matching pocket handkerchiefs. Grenier published with André Gide’s Nouvelle Revue Française (known as the NRF) in Paris, and he impressed his students with his insider’s knowledge of the literary scene. Pia, the newspaperman, lanky, with a receding hairline and a long, forward-­leaning neck that made him look like a tortoise peeking out of its shell, was obviously a man who had spent too many hours bent over copy. While Grenier went to all the right schools and had the highest academic degrees, Pia remained 35\n\n36 · Chapter 5\n\nan irregular: a used-­book fanatic, a specialist in archaic pornography, a barker, a forger of Baudelaire poems, a magazine writer and art critic. When Pia was seventeen, he and André Malraux worked for the same private library near the Madeleine, rummaging for old books in the stalls along the Seine, and they were still friends. Pia was completely indifferent to literary fame or glamor, and a sudden sense of the futility of all things had caused him to cancel the publication of his own book of poems at Gallimard just as it was going to press. He was a nihilist but was a driven and obsessional worker when it came to other people’s writing. He would rather spend hours on footnotes for an obscure encyclopedia than shine as an author. These qualities made him an excellent editor.3 In 1938 Pia was hired by an agronomy engineer and urbanist named Jean-­Pierre Faure, who was financing a new newspaper. Oran already had a progressive newspaper and Algiers needed one. In the fall of that year, Alger-­Républican was born—antifascist, anticolonialist, and independent, with scarcely a penny to its name. Pia had no resources to hire professional journalists, so he looked for talented neophytes he could train. He remembered that first encounter with Camus as an instant meeting of minds: “Nothing he said was insignificant, while he was clearly even-­handed. Whatever the subject, his comments showed both solid general knowledge and an experience beyond that of the usual man of his age (he was only 25 years old). I didn’t have to submit his candidacy to any employer. I invited him immediately to work with me.” Camus, he observed, was disillusioned with party politics, but hadn’t abandoned his hopes for change.4 They didn’t talk about literature in that first meeting. Pia was equally at home among artists, writers, and journalists, but the last thing he was looking for was a literary dreamer: he had a newspaper to produce. The Wrong Side and the Right Side, A Happy Death, Camus’s work in the theater—he didn’t know anything about them. Everyday journalism was indeed a completely different form from the lyrical essays that Camus had been learning to write. At Alger-­ Républican, his intense introspection and sensibility were turned\n\nA Reporter on the Beat · 37\n\noutward, and his political and moral judgments put to the test of deadlines and limited space. Camus wrote Jean Grenier, who had left Algiers for a new teaching position in metropolitan France: “I’m doing journalism (at Alger-­ Républicain): dogs run over by cars and reporting—a few literary articles as well. You know better than I do how disappointing this work can be. Yet I’ve found something in it—an impression of freedom—I’m not constrained and everything I do seems lively. One finds as well satisfactions of rather base quality, but too bad.” In case the literary esthete remained unconvinced, Camus added that a government commission had taken a long time determining whether or not he’d be able to take the state teaching exam, and decided, based on his health, that he wouldn’t: “That is why I accepted the job of editor at Alger-­Républicain.”5 Grenier had been a powerful influence on him since high school, and if Camus had been allowed to take that exam, he would have followed in his teacher’s path and become a professor. Tuberculosis threatened his life and and matured him beyond his years. The disease was also going to save him from a conventional academic career. · As of October 1938, Camus’s theatrical and bohemian habits gave way to the frenetic activities of a journalist on the beat. He would no longer resemble his character Patrice Mersault, “lounging on a couch in the terrace room, a detective story in his hands.”6 Now the detective stories in Camus’s hands were real. The headquarters of Alger-­Républicain was on the rue Koechlin, in Bab-­el-­Oued, close to the docks. The paper had a tiny staff and was produced on ancient equipment. What were the “satisfactions of rather base quality” Camus was talking about in his letter to Grenier? Describing low-­life criminals and hookers did not have the same descriptive potential as evoking the Roman ruins at Tipasa. At least so it seemed. But right away, Camus learned that in the world of journalism, he could do more than describe. He could wrestle with justice and sometimes affect its course.\n\n38 · Chapter 5\n\n· Justice in 1930s Algeria was French justice. From a strictly administrative point of view, Algeria was part of France. Colonized in 1830, it was incorporated into the French administrative structures, with three large “départements” (states): Algiers, Constantine, and Oran. Algiers was France’s fourth largest city, after Lyon. A popular guide to Algeria vaunted a huge population explosion in its European community over the course of the 1930s.7 Statistics from the period of Camus’s young adulthood are biased, and should be taken with a grain of salt. Of nearly 6.5 million people living in Algeria in 1931, Europeans were said to represent 50 percent of the urban population of the four major cities.8 In the rural areas, the so-­called natives or indigenous Arabs and Berbers represented 78 percent according some accounts and 95 percent, according to others. Greater Algiers had a population of 319,095 inhabitants—212,487 Europeans and 106,608 indigenous. What was certain was the huge difference between the urban and rural areas: In Algiers, you could be in a neighborhood like Hydra, in the heights of the city, and imagine you were in any French metropolis. The Arab population was heavily concentrated in the Casbah, while the Europeans lived on boulevards that looked exactly like Marseille or Paris. But in a rural area such as Kabylia, the mountainous region east of Algiers, there was not a European in sight. On the docks and in Camus’s working class neighborhood, Belcourt, the populations mixed. Linguistically, the separations between the European and native communities were both strict and uneven. Europeans living under a French administration had little reason to learn Arabic; Arabs working for Europeans necessarily knew enough French to do their jobs—only a small elite read and wrote French. The Arabic spoken in Algiers was a dialect, oral rather than written, and the majority of the Arab population was unschooled and illiterate. Arabic was not taught in French schools. Camus didn’t speak Algerian Arabic, but it was a language whose sounds were familiar to him, and he would have known phrases—\n\nA Reporter on the Beat · 39\n\nhow to ask for a cigarette, or shout down his opponents on the soccer field.9 All members of the society, Muslims, Jews, and Europeans, were subject to French law and French courts. Their status within those institutions was uneven. Algerian Jews, for example, most of whom were native to Algeria well before the European conquest, received full citizenship rights in 1870, separating them from their Muslim counterparts and pulling them toward European assimilation.10 In a situation where Europeans and Jews had civil rights and an overwhelming majority of Arabs had none, the courts became a theater for the tensions and dramas of a society structured on inequality. During the two-­year life of Alger-­Républicain, political trials gave Camus the opportunity to cover events over several weeks and earn a reputation as a troublemaker with the colonial government.11 And this world-­within-­a-­world served another more enduring purpose for the writer. At a time when The Stranger was barely a speck in his imagination, and A Happy Death definitively abandoned, Camus sat in closed courtrooms, hour by hour, discovering the well-­oiled machinery of judicial plots, studying an extravagant cast of characters who were ready-­made and waiting for a story teller’s transpositions. In the long run, his time spent in court would allow him to plot The Stranger around a crime that grew out of ethnic tensions in Algerian society, and around a trial that made a mockery of the justice system. In the very first trials he covered for the paper, Camus was both writer and a lobbyist for justice. A government agricultural agent, Michel Hodent, purchased wheat from Arab farmers and stockpiled it in order to regulate prices and prevent the kind of speculation that was rampant among rich landowners. Hodent was set up and imprisoned by the colonial government for embezzlement, with no proof. He wrote to Alger- Républicain for support. Camus took up his cause, and the case went to trial. Camus had great characters to work with for his series of articles on the Hodent affair. The judge tried to prove Hodent’s motive for embezzlement by suggesting that his honeymoon must have been expensive. No, Hodent retorted, he and his bride had gone camp-\n\n40 · Chapter 5\n\ning. When Hodent’s colleague defended him courageously, a lawyer named Navarro, representing the rich landowner in a civil case against Hodent, claimed that “people only defend their friends when they are guilty.”12 As Camus became familiar with the ways of the court, there was nothing he disliked more than lies clothed in judicial pretension—and he would make his impatience with the hypocrisy of the courts a cornerstone of The Stranger. He was becoming an expert at setting scenes and reporting dialogue with an economy of style, to give a sense of the here and now. Hodent was acquitted. It was a victory for the accused, and for the journalist who had taken up his cause. Camus wrote a quietly philosophical assessment. It would take Hodent a long time to get over what had happened to him, yet “there always comes a time when injustice is forgotten.”13 This gentle ending was modest, since Camus was in large part responsible for getting Hodent his day in court. It was also the kind of open ending that allows a reader to dream about a character’s future—a writer’s ending. Camus’s next series of articles covered a politically charged murder trial that galvanized the public and set religious and state institutions against one another. Many considered the Cheikh El Okbi trial an Algerian Dreyfus affair. Cheikh El Okbi, a theologian who believed in the modernization of Islam, had been lobbying the government for the extension of legal rights to Muslims. The conservative Mufti Kahoul, violently opposed to the reform, considered Okbi and his allies dangerous agitators. When the mufti was stabbed to death in broad daylight on the streets of Algiers, El Okbi was the first to be accused. El Okbi and Camus had worked together in the French-­Muslim Union and Cercle du Progrès—they were political allies on the Algiers left. Camus wrote Jean Grenier, who was curious about the case, that he had always respected El Okbi, but it was impossible to really know him: every time a rapprochement was possible, he acted in a way that Camus found strange.14 The issue in the trial was whether the murder was a set up. Had the colonial government ordered the murder of Kahoul and framed\n\nA Reporter on the Beat · 41\n\nEl Okbi to destroy the reformist movement? Or did El Okbi order the murder? Speculation was rampant. The young reporter sat in a criminal courtroom hour after hour and listened to voices. One of the key players in the trial was a garrulous man named Akacha, an Arabic speaker and ex-­con whose initial accusation had led to El Okbi’s arrest. “Akacha, when questioned, responds to the interpreter briefly, in his dull voice, with a rapid and confident flow of words. First he defends himself against charges that he was a drunk and a pimp, adding that he had been absent from Algiers for sixteen years. He also said, ‘I have always worked.’”15 The El Okbi trial offered Camus an even larger parade of full-­ fledged characters than the Hodent case, beginning with the lower-­ class Akacha, who had no sooner retracted his accusation than he came under suspicion of murder himself. Even more perfect was the French magistrate, Louis Vaillant, who waved a crucifix at Akacha in court: M. Vaillant explains the figure of Christ that he shows the accused. He says to Akacha: “If you are religious, we can understand one another, I am a Christian. And I also believe in God. I have an image here that helps me when I turn to it.” And showing [the crucifix] to him, he says to Akacha, “When you believe in God, how could you have killed a religious leader and want to send another religious leader to prison?” Akacha intervenes and declares: “No, I said I don’t believe in God. He is too old. He needs to be changed.”16\n\nSome courtroom banter is as clever as fiction. Akacha’s quip was well placed, since the court was supposed to be secular. Instead, in this highly publicized trial, a French judge brought Jesus into the courtroom in the form of a crucifix and tried to discuss his faith with the Muslim witness. For the judge, it was a gesture of empathy, but for Camus and Alger-­Républican, it was proselytizing, ridiculous and inappropriate. Camus wrote one of the strongest scenes in The Stranger using the dialogue between Akacha and Vaillant about the\n\n42 · Chapter 5\n\ncrucifix and transposing it to Meursault and the examining magistrate. At the end of the theatrical trial, Akacha, not El Okbi, was condemned to life in prison. Although Camus admired and shared El Okbi’s political views, he had doubts about who was responsible for the murder. Instead of the answers, which he didn’t have, he concluded with a very literary scene that left the reader wondering: Akacha cries out ironically: “Long live French Justice.” And he adds: “My conscience is clear.” By a curious coincidence, at the moment the sentence is pronounced condemning Akacha, the bells of a neighboring church ring out and a cluster of pigeons fly off the wall we see from the window in the courtroom. Then Akacha is taken away, and with him goes the entire secret of the crime.17\n\nCamus was already an artful journalist who knew how to build suspense through a few well-­chosen details. On his walk from the newspaper to the Palais de Justice, he never failed to notice, at an angle behind the courthouse, the Église Saint-Augustin, which was named after the patron saint of Algeria but looked as if it had never left the French countryside. The ringing of those church bells was the perfect way for Camus to underline the intrusion of religion into a judgment that was supposed to be secular. When he wrote the verdict scene of The Stranger, he remembered that bell. In July, Camus traveled to Philippeville in Eastern Algeria to report on a heartbreaking case. Twelve native farm workers who had fought for a pay raise were accused of setting fire to empty shacks. They were tortured in an attempt to extricate confessions, then condemned to forced labor. Camus covered the appeal of their sentence, which failed. Ahmed Boualeg, Mohammed Alimi, Mohammed Fisli, Amar Bettiche, Salah Sellaoui, Khemis Sadouni: he named them, calling them “innocent men condemned to forced labor and their families condemned to misery ‘in the name of the French people.’”18\n\nA Reporter on the Beat · 43\n\nBut there were other trials in the Algiers criminal court—stories of murder and petty violence that were just as likely, perhaps even more likely than the political cases, to nourish the imagination of a novelist in search of stories about colonial encounters. Violence in the bars and on the streets, especially during the hot Algerian summer, pitted native Muslim Algerians (referred to in the press as “indigènes”) against Europeans. These stories got a few columns in the paper and were generally unsigned. Anyone on staff might have written them, and you’d have to conduct the literary equivalent of a DNA test to determine whether the sentences were written by Camus. Whether or not he wrote the stories, he certainly read them. He knew, in the spring and summer of 1939, that the narrator of his new novel was going to kill an Arab, and there was an abundance of material in the press about conflicts between Arabs and Europeans. In March and July of 1939, two murder cases reported in Alger-­Républican were suggestive, because they were so ordinary. On March 4, 1939, the murder trial of Raphael Cozzolino packed the Algiers criminal court with Europeans and Muslims, most of them dockers.19 Vaillant was once again the presiding judge. The case turned around an issue of self-­defense: Toubal Salah, an angry unemployed Arab dockworker, had accosted Cozzolino, his union representative, in a bar. Cozzolino claimed that he saw Toubal Salah put his hand in his pocket, so he took out his gun and fired in self defense. The bullet struck Toubal Salah in the abdomen and he died in the hospital two days later. The prosecution argued that Cozzolino did not appear to have been provoked. The defense countered, arguing that life for a man of the docks was a struggle, and that “the defensive gesture was a natural reflex” for Cozzolino. In his youth, Cozzolino had attacked a man to defend his sister—and had endured a prison sentence for that offense, which made him even more vigilant. The defense also argued that Toubal Salah was lazy, drunken, and quarrelsome. Whoever wrote the unsigned article took Cozzolino’s side and expressed surprise—practically outrage—that the European union man was sentenced to seven years in a penal colony for the crime. He would\n\n44 · Chapter 5\n\nbe leaving Algiers for Cayenne. It wasn’t a death sentence—for that he would most likely have to have committed several murders, or commit a felony murder involving several crimes—but it was one instance where a European suffered a serious legal consequence for killing an Arab. That July an even stranger trial put a European named Billota on the stand for having shot his neighbor, an Arab named Belkacem ben Amar, who had chopped down a hedge dividing their property, then trespassed. Billota, who wept throughout the trial, was represented by the defense as “mentally diminished” by a workplace accident: “He was an instinctive man, without any culture, without any control over himself.” Billota lacked, according to his defense lawyer, an “exact notion of social obligations.” The case for self-­defense was flimsy: Belkacem had punched Billota and thrown rocks at him, which hardly justified murder. The jury condemned Billota to two years in prison with a suspended sentence.20 The sentence was laughable, and the defendant bizarre. For Camus, in search of a character, here was a man without social obligations who seemed to have gotten away with murder. It was always the details that counted. In trial after trial, he observed how the prisoner waited inside a tiny room for the bell to ring before the gendarme escorted him to the stand, like someone throwing a bull into the corrida. He knew what to expect next. And he was keenly aware that the mechanisms of the court led inexorably to a sentence, which might or might not be just.\n\n6 Any Person Condemned to Death Shall Have His Head Cut Off Like most writers with a novel on their minds, Camus carried his story around with him. And once he understood that Meursault would be condemned to death, he began to see death sentences everywhere. An old family story made him especially sensitive to the issue, and it may have been the initial reason he ended his novel with the prospect of a guillotine. When he was a little boy, Camus’s grandmother told him a story about his father. He listened with the rapt curiosity of a child who has never known his parent: Lucien Camus had died in World War I, when Camus was barely a year old. The story was gruesome. An agricultural worker had murdered an entire family in cold blood, and Lucien, shocked by news of the crime, decided to attend the execution. Camus couldn’t leave the story alone. He made a place for the anecdote in The Stranger and in The Plague, but it is in a postwar essay, “Reflections on the Guillotine,” that he describes his father’s experience most powerfully, without the ornaments of fiction: What he saw that morning he never told anyone. He came rushing home, his face distorted, refused to talk, lay down for a moment on the bed, and began to vomit . . . Instead of thinking of the slaughtered children, he could think of nothing but that quivering body that had just been dropped onto a board to have its head cut off.1 45\n\n46 · Chapter 6\n\nThe story had lodged itself in the writer’s imagination with physical precision. When Camus described his father at the scene, he imagined that what must have captured his horrified attention was not the guillotine itself, but the body of the condemned man, quivering. That an execution made Lucien Camus sick, that it filled him with such horror he couldn’t speak, was really the only thing Albert Camus ever learned about his father. After his death, the military hospital sent Camus’s mother a piece of the shrapnel that killed her husband, which she kept in a little box, the way other widows might keep a wedding band or a pair of cufflinks.2 The execution story became, as the years passed, the son’s special inheritance. As a boy, Camus would wake up in terror of being executed, and the fear got even worse when he came of age and came down with tuberculosis. He put the words in Patrice Mersault’s mouth in his 1936 notebooks: a man condemned to death was living and breathing inside him.3 As his new novel simmered, he watched and he listened for a way to tell the story his father had refused to tell. He didn’t have to look hard for stories of capital punishment in those years leading up to World War II. · In the House Above the World, when he still had time to read at leisure, Camus was drawn, like most French intellectuals of his generation, to American crime fiction.4 Not the staid British mystery novels based on clues and suppositions, reassuring puzzles resolved by aristocrats, but stories coming from mean streets, where the plots moved fast and the style didn’t call attention to itself. Sartre rewrote Nausea after reading Dashiell Hammett. For Camus the model was James M. Cain’s The Postman Always Rings Twice, which appeared in French translation in 1936. Several critics have speculated that this novel led Camus from the dead end of A Happy Death to The Stranger. Whenever anyone asked, Camus acknowledged its influence. What was he thinking when he read it for the first time? The plot goes like this: Nick Papadakis runs a gas station and roadhouse twenty miles outside of Los Angeles. His wife, Cora, is a\n\nAny Person Condemned to Death Shall Have His Head Cut Off · 47\n\nproduct of the Hollywood dream factory: she won a beauty contest in Iowa, came out to California, and failed to make it, so she settled for life with Nick instead. Everything changes when a handsome drifter named Frank Chambers shows up. Papadakis hires Frank to do odd jobs, and soon enough he and Cora are in the throes of a searing affair. In a first sex scene in the novel, Frank bites Cora’s lip until it bleeds—it was enough to get the book banned in Boston. The adulterous couple decides to kill Nick and run off together, and from there ensues the infernal machinery of plot. It wasn’t the storyline—a classic adulterous triangle—that appealed to Camus, it was the way the story was told. Frank speaks right to the reader, in the first person, confessing as he waits for his punishment in the death house. The effect of this first-­person narrator was the opposite of what Camus had achieved in the third person with the emotionally expansive Patrice Mersault. The sentences were short and taut and there was no rumination, no analysis, no deep inner self, just a very ordinary American voice—“a hobo with good grammar,” as Cain called Frank.5 “That night at supper, the Greek got sore at her for not giving me more fried potatoes. He wanted me to like it there, and not walk out on him like the others had.” The first reviewers of the novel were impressed that Cain could achieve sensationalism though understatement.6 Cora and Frank are acquitted of Nick’s murder for lack of proof, though the district attorney tries to set them up against each other. What happens next gives the ending of the novel a cruel twist. Cora, pregnant with Frank’s child, takes ill on the beach, and in a loving scene, Frank rushes her to the hospital. He is so anxious to protect mother and unborn child that he races at top speed and crashes the car. Cora dies in the accident. Frank is then accused of murdering her, and a jury finds him guilty—he gets the death sentence. From a legal point of view, the ending is completely unrealistic, but philosophically, it’s perfect: Frank gets away with the crime he actually committed—the murder of Nick Papadakis—but he will die for an act of love. Frank finishes writing his long confession—the book we’ve just\n\n48 · Chapter 6\n\nread—as he waits to be taken to the gas chamber: “Here they come. Father McConnell says prayers help. If you’ve got this far, send up one for me, and Cora, and make it that we’re together, wherever that is.”7 It is an uplifting religious ending, a sentimental retreat that betrays the brutal core of the novel: Frank is going to be executed for the wrong reason. That was the logic Camus retained for his own novel. Cain’s crime novel had other appealing traits. First, the ethnic tensions in the California setting. When Frank speaks to Nick Papadakis directly, he calls him “Nick.” But when Frank thinks about him or talks about him to Cora, it’s always just “the Greek.” Easier to talk about murdering the Greek than to contemplate killing a man with a name. “The Greek” sets the tone for other kinds of ethnic hatred. Cora is terrified she’ll be taken for a Mexican because she’s married to “a soft greasy guy with black kinky hair.” The Greek makes her feel she isn’t white. These California highways, so close to the Mexican border, were defined by the everyday racism and violence that Camus knew well, where, as he put it, just like in Africa, “people also live short and violent lives.”8 The crimes against Arabs that had come to trial in the Algerian courts—the Cozzolino case, the Billota case—offered up a gritty social reality that suited a hard-­boiled approach. When Camus said The Postman Always Rings Twice inspired The Stranger, he didn’t go into detail.9 It is easy to imagine that when he observed the effect Cain got by using “the Greek” in place of a proper name, he realized he could create a similar effect by calling the murder victim in his own novel “the Arab.” It was a way of describing prejudice without explaining it, by reducing a man to his ethnic label. · Clearly Camus couldn’t get away from The Stranger, even on his day off, and what he retained from a popular 1938 movie called Le Schpountz becomes fundamental to The Stranger’s plot.10 “I am sure I have a gift,” claims Irénée Fabre, the hero of Le Schpountz, to his disbelieving family of grocers in Provence.11 He\n\nAny Person Condemned to Death Shall Have His Head Cut Off · 49\n\npre­sents himself for judgment before the American movie moguls who happen to be passing through his village. They indulge him by offering him a screen test, but really they’re toying with him. Behind his back they call him a schpountz, an easy mark. And in this most unlikely situation, the death penalty rears its head again, this time as pure comedy. Le Schpountz opened at the Régent cinema on the rue d’Isly the week of November 22, 1938. Camus had been working as a journalist for a month with barely a break. His novel was on hold, and he didn’t have a second to spare. But who could resist the French comic actor known simply as Fernandel? Ten years older than Camus, he was a box office comedy star, in part because no one could look at his horsey face and enormous smile without laughing. This time, Fernandel’s character was as ridiculous as ever—Irénée Fabre, trapped between the dried cod and the soggy Roquefort in his uncle’s grocery, is convinced he has a god-­given genius for acting and is bound to become a movie star, if he can only audition. Unlike Camus’s Uncle Acault, a butcher who supported his intellectual life, Irénée’s uncle doesn’t understand his nephew. The screen test is Irénée’s big chance. He chooses to showcase his talents by repeating, in a series of distinct moods, Article 12 from the French penal code, which describes the death sentence: “Any person sentenced to death shall have his head cut off.” As the cynical Parisian film crew cheers him on, Irénée performs the sentence in distinct moods: fearful, pitying, affirmative, thoughtful, comic. His face devours the screen as he moves from one exaggerated mood to another with overwrought passion. The filmmakers convince him he has a lead in an American film called Le Schpountz. They give him a fake contract, and off he goes to Paris. For the reporter who was spending his days in the courthouse, Le Schpountz provided excellent comic release. In Fernandel’s rubbery face, Camus could see a version of his own. And in the Mediterranean hick, Irénée, he saw another boy dreaming of glory as an actor, or a writer, in the metropolis. He had done every kind of theater, from the sublime to the ridiculous: Malraux, Aeschylus, Dos-\n\n50 · Chapter 6\n\ntoyevsky, Gide, Rojas. In 1937, Camus toured with the popular Radio Algiers theater, playing comic roles. In Courteline’s Article 330, he played Monsieur La Brige, who hangs his bare buttocks out the front window of his apartment to taunt the crowds at the World’s Fair! There was also A Happy Death, put aside for now, and with it his dreams of success as a novelist. When the Schpountz sticks out his chest and proudly imitates a fearful, then thoughtful, then comic man, Camus could laugh at his own ambitions. After a series of misadventures, Irénée Fabre triumphs. With the support of a good woman, Irénée’s luck turns when he comes to understand that his face, his gestures, are perfect for comedy—not tragedy, as he once thought. He has to accept what he’s good at to become a star. Then comes a true Hollywood ending. He returns to his hometown in an enormous car with a chauffeur, and the local children gather around in wonder while he embraces his family. “I’m a mixture of Fernandel, Humphrey Bogart, and a Samurai,” Camus is supposed to have quipped to friends, mocking his reputation as the handsome man-­about-­town.12 Fernandel was Camus’s alter ego—an idiotic part of himself, ambitious, grandiose, deluded. Without ever mentioning Le Schpountz in The Stranger, Camus would make a Fernandel film central to his plot, and to Meursault’s destiny. You could even argue that Fernandel and his movie become the main cause of Meursault’s demise. A few hours in the meditative darkness of the Régent cinema, free from the pressures of the newsroom, had advanced his novel in the most unexpected way. · In The Stranger, Camus stopped short of portraying Meursault’s execution. But as he was conceiving the novel, a murder trial in metropolitan France put the death sentence in international headlines. The week the story came to a head, his thoughts were miles away. It was early June 1939, and Camus was in Kabylia. He had just finished the most intense assignment of his two years at the paper, a multipart investigative report on conditions in the mountainous re-\n\nAny Person Condemned to Death Shall Have His Head Cut Off · 51\n\ngion that tore at his heart. The Kabyle people traced their ancestry back before the Arab conquest; they spoke their own language and had their own forms of government. The French colonizers tended to romanticize them as a purer, more democratic people than the Arabs, but that didn’t improve their commitment to the region. Neglectful policy, subsistence wages, children so hungry they ate the poisonous roots of plants: Camus saw in all of it the likelihood that France, without the most radical reforms, would lose Algeria.13 It is important in understanding Camus’s reactions not to rush ahead to the Algerian revolution with its hard-­and-­fast opposition between revolutionary Arab nationalists and intransigent French colonizers. Even though Camus was appalled by colonial violence and deeply hostile to government policy, his point of view throughout the 1930s was French, and he saw his duty as a social critic to strengthen French humanistic values. His idealism was repeatedly coming up against reality: reform was not working, at least not enough to address massive inequalities. Referring to France’s generosity to its neighbors devastated by World War I, he contrasted the hypocrisy of colonial avarice: “We managed to come up with the money to give the countries of Europe nearly 400 billion francs, all of which is now gone forever. It seems unlikely that we cannot come up with one-­hundredth that amount to improve the lot of people whom we have not yet made French, to be sure, but from whom we demand the sacrifices of French citizens.”14 France was willing to help out a neighboring country while it ignored the suffering in its own Algerian territories—ignored people who sacrificed their well-­being in wartime and in peacetime in the service of France, without a living wage or the rights of citizenship. It was as if France were condemning the natives of Kabylia to a long, slow death sentence. When Camus returned to Algiers from Kabylia on June 16, he was jolted out of one poli"
