        "text": "I took the plunge this month, and joined the bookgroup organised by A French Journey in Hampton, where I have French lessons every week. As anyone who’s ever tried to learn a language knows, it is essential to have authentic opportunities for speaking and listening, so AFJ learners can attend cultural occasions, lunches, meditation sessions, film nights, cooking classes and immersion trips to France and New Caledonia. But when they introduced a French book club this year I thought it would be too advanced for me, and it wasn’t until the book of the month turned out to be L’étranger (The Outsider) by Albert Camus that found I could not resist the opportunity to join in. We had a month to read the book… it couldn’t be that hard if French students read it at school, right?\n\n(And I’d read it twice before, so I already knew what happened).\n\nThere are thousands of thoughtful reviews of L’étranger already, so I thought instead that I would share the discussion points we explored (me in my limping French). The consensus among our group was that it was a difficult book, not because of the French, but because of the philosophical issues raised and the absurdism of the text. We discussed the way Meursault is shown to be an outsider disconnected from his society, observing life but not really participating in it. Most of the time he shows no emotion at all, even on occasions when almost anyone would. (Someone brought up the idea that he was perhaps somewhere on the autism spectrum, but I think that’s a contemporary preoccupation, and interpreting the characterisation like that misses Camus’s point.)\n\nWe also talked about Meursault’s alienation from the Algerian society he lives in. In this respect, our teacher explained that Camus was presenting a critique of the way French colonial society was not integrated into the country. Meursault exoticises the sounds and smells of the city, and he is always bothered by the weather, especially outside when he seems to suffer from heatstroke which affects his ability to think or concentrate or make sensible decisions. He is the narrator of this story, and the reader notices that while he names all the characters, even quite minor ones, the ‘Arabes’ are never named, and they are presented as people who do not belong. In this respect you can have an interesting discussion about who Camus is representing as the stranger/outsider of the title, Meursault or the Algerian man that he kills, and in what ways the title is ironic.\n\nOne aspect that I hadn’t noticed (because my grasp of French tenses is feeble, to say the least) is that there is a stylistic difference between Parts I and II. The first part (when Meursault has some agency though he chooses not to exercise it) is narrated in the active voice, while the second part is in the passive voice, when he has lost control of what will happen in his life. This bifurcation is signalled at the end of Part 1 when the Arab draws his knife and Meursault fires the first shot, the precise moment in the present tense:\n\nTout mon être s’est tendu et j’ai crispé ma main sur le revolver. La gâchette a cédé, j’ai touché le ventre poli de la crosse et c’est là, dans le bruit à la fois sec et assourdissant, que tout a commencé. J’ai secoué la sueur et le soleil. J’ai compris que j’avais détruit l’équilibre du jour, le silence exceptionnel d’une plage où j’avais été heureux. Alors, j’ai tiré encore quatre fois sur un corps inerte où les balles s’enfonçaient sans qu’il y parût. Et c’était comme quatre coups brefs que je frappais sur la porte du malheur.\n\nMy entire being tensed and I clutched the revolver. The trigger gave way, I touched the smooth belly of the butt and it is there, in the noise both brittle and deafening, that it all started. I shook off the sweat and the sun. I realized that I had destroyed the equilibrium of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I had been happy. Then I fired four more times at an inert body where the bullets sank in without a trace. And it was like four short blows that I knocked on the door of misfortune.\n\nSince Meursault’s only defence is that the first shot was an accident, a shot fired in panic at the sight of the knife, his decision to fire four more shots is crucial. IMO he fires those four shots into the body because he may as well. He has already ruined the day, and his entire life. (Not to mention the Arab’s of course, but IMO that first shot was self defence, and he wouldn’t have had that gun if he hadn’t tried to prevent violence by taking it away from Raymond in the first place). The question as to whether he ever comes to rue his action, is also crucial to the penalty he receives…\n\nThough it came up late in the conversation, I want to share how we talked about the famous opening lines narrated by the doomed central character Meursault: Aujourd’hui, maman est morte, which translates as Today, mother died. However, the way that the simple word maman is translated can, depending on your own cultural background, set the tone of the entire book in a direction perhaps not intended by the author. Camus could have chosen the word mama, but he didn’t. In this article at the NYT Ryan Bloom argues that for the modern American reader the translation of ‘maman’ to ‘Mother’ instead of ‘mom’ implies an impersonal, formal relationship, not one of affection. Since the ensuing prosecution for murder makes much of Meursault’s callousness towards his mother, ‘Mother’ has the power to change the way we read everything that follows. Well, I beg to differ. In British/Irish culture or class, far from being a cold and unfeeling term analogous to ‘dog’ or ‘husband’, ‘Mother’ is what I called my mother, with affection, as she, coming from an Anglo-Irish family also addressed her mother. Amongst the Brits, using ‘mum’ rather than ‘mummy’ is a marker of class. Gilbert (the translator of the edition under discussion, who was an Oxford scholar) was simply trying to avoid such class distinctions because he would have considered France to be a classless society.\n\nWe also briefly discussed the strange inclusion of a story about a Czech that seems to have nothing to do with anything. Meursault finds under the bed in his cell, a scrap of newspaper about a crime which seems meaningless. We came up with no satisfactory explanation for why Camus included this, but did better with the strange reappearance of ‘the woman in the restaurant.’ Meursault sees this woman and notes her odd behaviour, and she turns up as a witness at his trial but is not called to the stand. This can be explained, perhaps, if she had read about his case in the papers which were featuring it because it was a dry spell for news, and she came forward, but there is no explanation for why the prosecution would want her testimony except that her presence reinforces the absurdity of the trial proceedings. I am happy to be enlightened about these minor points by anyone who’s read the book too.\n\nI enjoyed two concluding exercises… we had to choose which of these applied to Meursault\n\nça m’était égal\n\nje me suis ennuyé\n\nc’est ne pas de ma faute\n\nj’avais tout le ciel dans les yeux et il était bleu et doré\n\nIt was all the same to me\n\nI was bored\n\nIt’s not my fault\n\nI was blinded by the sunlight\n\nand then which of these applied best as a summary of the book:\n\nCela ne veut rien dire.\n\n(Pour moi) c’est un malheur.\n\nC’est alors que tout a vacillé.\n\nIt n’y avait rien de change.\n\n(J’ai répondu qu’)on ne changeait jamais de vie, qu’en tout cas toutes se valaient.\n\nIl n’y a pas d’issue.\n\nIt does not mean anything.\n\n(For me) it’s a misfortune.\n\nIt was then that everything altered.\n\nNothing had changed.\n\nYou can’t change your life and whatever you do it’s all the same\n\nThere is no way out.\n\nIf you’ve read L’étranger, which ones would you choose?"
