        "text": "No matter what we discover, no matter what we can now explain- certain views skeptical of the meaning and intelligibility of life remain intact. Yet, if I am gauging this right, my young students arrive at College less and less familiar with writers who insist on life's absurdity.\n\nThis works out fine for me, because getting to suggest that life is absurd- to people who will be pondering the idea for the first time- is especially rich. The authors themselves (I'll use Albert Camus as my example) might even find this \"all at once\" approach superior to some process of warming up to the idea.\n\nSure, they scoff it off as they read the work at home. It is only once I get to them to class that I can begin to explain that Camus was not offering arguments against the meaning they recognize in their lives. He was addressing people who had already experienced the unsettling feeling that most of what we tell ourselves is wishful and protective.\n\n'Those poor saps! So unlike me!', the students initiallly respond to these imagined people without their confidence. But then I try to get them to consider these people's reasons. The modern artist on our campus who agrees so deeply with Camus (and his art represents the philosophy) because, as he asks, \"Who can tell pretty stories and paint pretty pictures after the Holocaust? Who?\" (His paintings are here.)\n\nThe connection to real-world historical events helps. But students still won't see a connection to their lives today, lucky as they are, full of promise, affluent, and well-loved. Yet Camus explains, they too should recognize what he takes to be evidence of his claims. We experience the absurd even in safe places.\n\n\"A man is talking on the telephone behind a glass partition; you cannot hear him, but you see his incomprehensible dumb show: you wonder why he is alive.\"\n\nDo my students acknowledge experiencing this? Without a doubt. When we watch someone else talking on the phone, crossing the street thoughtlessly, or doing other mundane things that happen to annoy us- we feel disgust and disdain. We wonder what the point of this person is- so loud on the point, so inane in conversation, so inattentive in the street.\n\nThis is part of my students' lives 'on a daily basis', they offer, suddenly interested. 'What of it?'\n\nWell- Camus points out that we are no different than the people who annoy us in line, in their cars, interviewed on television. We are like them to others. We are like them to ourselves. Just have someone tape you as you go about your day- you'll do the things you despise watching. The disdain we feel is for ourselves. The uncongeniality we feel is to ourselves. We are no less absurd.\n\nOf course, this might be to get no more than a quick taste. Our life situation may not pit us against the more stark evidence that life has no meaning. We may escape the Holocaust. We may not get kidnapped by some dimwit, our loved ones may not die in a car accident when they could have safely taken the train. But some people are not so lucky. How do these people's experiences get integrated into the stories we tell ourselves? What would we think were we to experience the same?\n\nThinking of life as absurd, is it ever any kind of guide?\n\nIn response to views like Camus's, philosopher Joel Feinberg maps out the different notions of absurdity that we are usually not careful enough to distinguish. Most of them are more harmless than anything. Some absurdity is just incongruity, a dog dressed in human clothes. Some absurdity is just an unsettling of our typical expectations (Alanis Morissette's lyrics come to mind). Feinberg makes a very deft case against the idea that our lives as a whole are absurd merely because they don't serve some one coherent purpose. He points out against Camus that life can be fulfilling with the goals and activities we do have, even if we grant that from some 'cosmic' perspective, our tasks might seem absurd.\n\nBut he cannot explain away everything Camus describes.\n\nFeinberg includes in his essay a description of the last moments of some British soldiers' lives. They chose to obey orders to march to certain death, in a battle unstrategic enough to give them no sense of playing a helpful role in a larger campaign. When faced, starkly, with the most resilient type of absurdity, they chose to use the kind of method Camus recommended. They sang the very bravest thing possible as they marched,\"we're here because we're here because we're here because we're here...\"\n\nThis is to live (or die in this case) without appeal, to not shirk but to face head-on what life brings us. It is all we can really do, Camus explains. It is the most we can expect of ourselves. It is heroic.\n\nIs this advice handy? Well, even in times of general peace and prosperity, there do seem to be certain situations we have difficulty explaining away. Should a well-intentioned person fall on his face before admired peers, should a life-long research program come to a complete dead end, should a person's child have Tay-Sachs- what is it we can say? What resources do we have? What comfort is there?"
