Meursault is a young man who works as a clerk in Algiers. He lives in the usual manner of a French-Algerian, middle-class bachelor ? cooking his evening meals for himself in his small flat, sleeping with his girl at the weekends, bathing, going to the pictures. But he has a glaring fault in the eyes of society ? he seems to lack the basic emotions and reactions (including hypocrisy) that are required of him. He is the outsider.* This is a NEAR VG copy with some age and minimal wear reducing it to GD++. 0 138 pp. 1963-01-01. n."
