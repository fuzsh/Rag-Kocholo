        "text": "Profession: Author\n\nBiography: Albert Camus was a French-Algerian philosopher and author, best known for having received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957. He received the prize \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times.\"\n\nCamus was born into a pied-noir family in the poor neighborhood of Mondovi, Algeria. Following the death of his father, Lucien, in World War I and given the deafness and illiteracy of his mother, Catherine Hélène Camus', he faced a challenging youth.\n\nOvercoming these difficulties, Camus excelled academically and earned a scholarship with the help of his teacher, Louis Germain, which enabled him to attend a lyceum. At the University of Algiers, he studied philosophy and supplemented his income with various odd jobs.\n\nIn his 20s, Camus married Simone Hié, however, the marriage eventually fell apart due to her infidelity and struggles with addiction. His initial involvement with the French Communist Party was motivated by a desire to fight Algerian inequalities, but he later left the party over ideological disagreements.\n\nHis interests in theatre and politics manifested through his activities with the Algerian People's Party and the Théâtre du Travail, and he advanced his journalism career through his work with Alger républicain where he opposed colonialism and fascism.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Camus settled in Paris and contributed to Paris-Soir. The German invasion prompted him to relocate to Lyon. During this turbulent period, he married Francine Faure and briefly returned to Algeria where he composed The Plague and The Misunderstanding.\n\nEventually returning to Paris, he developed a friendship with Jean-Paul Sartre and took part in the French Resistance, editing Combat using a pseudonym to protect his identity.\n\nAfter the war, Camus enjoyed fame and respect, traveling extensively to lecture and promoting libertarian socialism. His outspoken critiques of totalitarianism eventually caused a fallout with Sartre. Meanwhile, Camus maintained a stance of neutrality during the Algerian War, championing a vision of a multicultural Algeria.\n\nIn 1960, Camus's life was cut short at the age of 46 when he died in a car crash. In the aftermath, his unfinished manuscript, The First Man, was discovered at the accident site. He was buried in Lourmarin Cemetery, and his death was mourned by notable figures including Sartre and William Faulkner, who penned his obituary.\n\nHe is perhaps best remembered for his The Myth of Sisyphus, which revolves around the Greek mythological character of Sisyphus who is doomed to roll a rock uphill anew everyday. Camus took this as a representation of the human condition, concluding that we \"must imagine Sisyphus happy.\"\n\nBorn: November 7, 1913\n\nBirthplace: Dréan, Algeria\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Ox\n\nStar Sign: Scorpio"
