        "text": "THE FIRST MAN By Albert Camus. Translated by David Hapgood. 336 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $23.\n\nText:\n\nWHEN Albert Camus died in an automobile accident in 1960 at the age of 46, his wife and friends decided against publishing the manuscript of an unfinished novel, \"Le Premier Homme\" (\"The First Man\"). Though Camus had recently won the Nobel Prize in Literature, he was out of favor with the French intellectual establishment, which, at the height of the Algerian war, decried his voice of moderation. The correct stance at the time was to support the Algerian independence movement, and therefore terrorism. Camus, who was born and grew up in Algeria, opposed extremism and violence on both sides, favored a multicultural Algeria and ultimately preferred to remain silent on issues that he felt were distorted by ideology.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it seemed unwise to publish an unfinished, unpolished manuscript that was, moreover, bound to incur the wrath of ideologues on both the left and the right. \"The First Man,\" in its uncompleted form, eventually came out in France, but only a year ago, and it made quite a stir. It now appears in an excellent English translation by David Hapgood. The book is a fascinating autobiographical novel, told in the third person (heightening the semblance of fiction), and represents a search for the author's self as well as a kind of testament. The novel helps put all of Camus's work into a clearer perspective and brings into relief what separates him from the more mili tant literary personalities of his day, like Malraux and Sartre.\n\nHabitually reticent about himself, in his final work Camus quite explicitly sets out on a pilgrimage to his past and to his private world, compelling the reader to question the ideas conventionally associated with his name: existentialism, the notion of the absurd, the stranger's alienation from society, the theory of revolt, the myth of Sisyphus.\n\nWHAT emerges instead is Camus's deep attachment to the Algeria of his childhood and adolescence, where he locates his roots and his most meaningful bonds. Seen from that point of view, France was an abstraction. To a certain extent, it remained a foreign country throughout his life. His father, whom he never knew, did not set foot on its soil until he was sent there in 1914; he died near the Marne in the early weeks of World War I, when Albert was only a year old. \"The First Man\" reveals that Camus never felt truly at home in France, that the mere thought of Paris gave him a sense of entrapment.\n\nHis solidarity with the Algeria of his youth is another side of his deep attachment to his illiterate and largely deaf mother, whom he loved with a speechless love. He continued to cherish moving memories of the life of poverty he shared with her, a brother, an inarticulate uncle and a stern Spanish grandmother in one of the disinherited quarters of Algiers. Despite his eventual celebrity and the material comfort he enjoyed, Camus never tore himself away emotionally from what he describes as the warm and innocent world of the poor.\n\nIn his quest for his origins, as he revisits his childhood and tries to imagine an unknown father, Camus discovers himself to be a homo duplex, a split or ambivalent personality. There is the author of \"The Stranger\" and \"The Plague,\" the former editor of the clandestine resistance paper Combat, the public figure engaged in polemics in the Parisian arena. But there is also the other Camus. As he puts it in \"The First Man\": \"The Mediterranean separates two worlds in me.\" And what lies on the other side of the vast expanse of the sea is the world of North Africa, to which he feels his deepest being belongs -- a world of wind and sand, open ranges and anonymity. The time he was writing the book coincides, moreover, with the turmoil of Algeria at war. There are the sounds of terrorists' bombs, glimpses of jeeps bristling with guns, the awareness that torture is a daily occurrence.\n\nThe title, \"The First Man,\" suggests archetypal patterns. The search for identity is linked to the search for the vanished father, a \"dead stranger,\" as Camus puts it. When he visits his father's tomb at the military graveyard in Brittany, he confronts the fact that at the age of 40 he is older than his father was when he was fatally wounded in the head by shrapnel. Fatherless, he realizes that his father, too, had no fatherland.\n\nThe evocations of his childhood are gripping: the apartment that had no gas and only an alcohol stove, no newspapers, no books, not even a radio; the whippings administered by his grandmother whenever he damaged his shoes playing soccer during recess in school; the gentle smile of his mother, who worked long hours as a cleaning woman, whose vocabulary was limited to 400 words and who lived in mute resignation. But there is humor, too, and evidence of a great capacity for affection, friendship and gratitude -- the most lasting of which went to his schoolteacher, a surrogate father who encouraged him to pursue his studies and coached him outside of class to compete successfully for a state scholarship to the lycee. The distance between the illiterate home and the world of books and ideas in which the young self-made intellectual exulted only increased his sense of estrangement. But Camus would never deny his humble background or feel shame about having grown up among the ignorant and the poor.\n\nThe notion of the self-made person lends further significance to the book's title. The \"first man,\" the young Camus, had to bring himself up alone, without the authority and guidance of a father, without a heritage handed down. He had to work out his own truth and morality. But the title has broader implications as well, for it refers to Algeria itself, living in a vacuum, forgetful of its past, a \"land of oblivion where each one is the first man.\"\n\nSelf-creation implies self-examination. But does it mean self-knowledge? The final chapter of the book is entitled \"A Mystery to Himself.\" By way of the boy he remembers having been, Camus catches glimpses of his more lasting traits. Little Albert (named Jacques in the book) loathes conventional gestures and behavior; he is hot-blooded, rambunctious and capable of foolish acts; he adapts easily to all kinds of people and loves to try out roles; he has a will to be courageous that may be more precious than courage itself. His ravenous appetite for life is rooted in his early knowledge of death. The blind stirrings and dark fire he felt as a boy remain buried in him, and inform his intensely poetic perception of the world.\n\nCamus is generally not at his best when trying to be an abstract thinker. His richest perceptions are sensuous and poetic. His evocations of Algiers and Algeria are precise and suggestive: brief twilights, the change of seasons, the departure of the swallows, labyrinths of vegetation, ravines full of scents, summer days when the sun grinds plaster and stone into fine dust and the sky is gray with heat. The teeming quarters of Algiers are made vivid, with their narrow arcaded streets, peddlers' stands, workshops, food stalls and intermingled ethnic and religious groups. Camus noted on the manuscript that he wanted this book to be \"heavy with things and flesh.\" He also succeeded in bestowing a mythical dimension on the physical landscape, as when he compares the \"holy dread\" felt when the North African evening descends on the sea to the effect experienced on the slopes of Delphi's mountain, with its nearby temples and sanctuaries.\n\nThe device of the third person allows Camus to apply an ironic perspective. There is at times a Faulknerian quality to the syntax and the deliberate blurring of past and present. Mr. Hapgood's translation deals skillfully with the literary devices at work, capturing the tone of Camus: direct, understated, occasionally aphoristic, sustained by subdued lyricism and a nostalgic attention to detail.\n\nLove of sun and sea, a need for friendship and games, a passion for soccer, these were only normal for the schoolboy eager to escape the grim confinement of his home. More telling is his early enthusiasm for the world of artisans, their dedication and solidarity. Camus describes his visit to the cooperage where his uncle worked and where he would watch with fascination the pounding on hoop-drivers and the boisterous dance of hammers. It is this kind of respect for the dignity of work that separates Camus from the Parisian intellectuals who merely theorized about the proletariat.\n\nLarger themes acquire new meaning in the autobiographical perspective. Camus's loathing for violence goes back to a childhood fistfight, when he inflicted a black eye on a classmate and then realized that \"vanquishing a man is as bitter as being vanquished.\" His lifelong aversion to capital punishment was, it would seem, the only concrete bond with the dead stranger, his father. He had been deeply impressed by the story of how his father attended the public execution of a criminal and returned home choked with nausea and horror. If Camus became, so to speak, the conscience of his time, it is because he refused all his life to side with the executioners, even when the victims were guilty.\n\nDeath is a constant presence in the life of Camus, who, as an adolescent, spat blood and later had recurrent bouts with tuberculosis. But so is the joy of convalescence and health. His love of the human body and of its beauty is never oblivious of its fragility. Camus remembers with intense precision how he and his friends played on the grounds of the Home for Disabled Veterans, where the mother of one of his schoolmates was chief laundress. The presence of the cripples lent a special poignancy to their games and to the rapture of the fragrant vegetation. Loss and retrieval are at the core of Camus's personal mythology, and they illumine the notion of exile to which he returns so often. For exile, as he makes clear in \"The Plague,\" is not so much an existential condemnation as a potentially redemptory awareness of an inner void that needs to be filled -- a longing for something lost or largely forgotten, and at the same time a forward quest.\n\nCamus's voice has never been more personal than in \"The First Man.\" It speaks directly to a sense of decency, refuses to become the accomplice of events, extols neither the hero nor the saint and proclaims that there is no shame in happiness, that a loveless world is a dead world. This is not to say that Camus is ever indifferent to the realities of history. But he knows that \"history\" can become a tyrannical encroachment, an oppressive justification or even a weapon for the ideologues of this world.\n\nCAMUS'S resistance to political and philosophical abstractions is best summed up by two statements from earlier works. The first comes from the preface to an early collection of essays: \"Poverty prevented me from judging that all was well under the sun and in history; the sun taught me that history was not all.\" The other, from one of his \"Notebooks,\" elaborates on a pronouncement by Dostoyevsky: \"One must love life before loving its meaning, says Dostoyevsky . . . yes, and when love of life disappears, no meaning can console us.\"\n\nThe tragic humanism of Camus is not to be confused with pessimism. Camus knew that war, not peace, is normal; that Cain will always murder Abel -- just as Dr. Rieux in \"The Plague\" knows that the deadly bacillus will not disappear. Hence the need for permanent vigilance. There can be no armistice in our struggle against suffering. The lesson Camus teaches is that we must learn to love that which is imperfect. This love must extend to loving that which is inevitable. Camus's allegiance to life, the life he lost so suddenly and so early, was from the start joyful and desperate."
