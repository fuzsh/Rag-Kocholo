        "text": "Albert Camus was born in Algeria in 1913. During World War II, he joined the Resistance movement in Paris, then became editor-in-chief of the newspaper Combat during the Liberation. A novelist, playwright, and essayist, he is most famous for his novels The Stranger and The Plague. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957.\n\nJacques Ferrandez was born in Algeria in 1955. In 1987, he began his Notebooks from the Orient, a series of panoramic portraits depicting the history of the French presence in Algeria, for which he was awarded the Historia Prix Spécial. An indisputable expert on the Algerian question, he adapted Camus’s novel The Stranger as well as his new interpretation of The First Man. His books have been the subject of many exhibitions in France and Algeria."
