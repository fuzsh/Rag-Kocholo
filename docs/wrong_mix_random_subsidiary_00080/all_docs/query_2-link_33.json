        "text": "I’d like to explore this short story by Albert Camus. It is a part of a collection of short stories entitled Exile and the Kingdom. After reading it a few times, I’m convinced it’s pretty brilliant in its execution. Albert Camus himself is a very interesting man. Here are a few articles on the man. I don’t know enough about him to know if the Christianity Today article has any veracity to it. But it is beside the point. He is worth reading regardless of whether he came to faith or not. And here is another about why Christians should read Camus.\n\nSo, if my plan isn’t doomed by a lack of follow through, is to first give an outline of the story and then in a post or two, talk about its relevance to faith in Christ.\n\nSummary\n\n“The Renegade, or a Confused Mind,” is about a man who began life in the Protestant country of Massif Central in France. He meets up with a Catholic priest who “hugged the walls as he passed through the village.” The priest tutors the man and eventually he goes to a Catholic seminary in order to become a missionary. He leaves the seminary before the faculty thinks wise in order to go to Taghaza, a city of salt, in Algeria and preach the gospel.\n\nUpon arrival in Taghaza the man is captured by the mysterious inhabitants and brought before their fetish, or idol. He is tortured and his tongue is torn out. It’s all pretty gruesome. But in the midst of his torture, the missionary converts to the tribe’s “religion” and begins to worship the fetish.\n\nHe then hears word that another missionary is coming to Taghaza along with a garrison of twenty men. He is shocked that the inhabitants have agreed to this deal. In his zeal, the missionary sneaks away from the tribe in order to shoot the incoming missionary with the hope that this will spark a battle that will lead to the proselytization of Europe by the devotees of the fetish. He kills the incoming missionary and then as he waits to die, begins to doubt his conversion to the fetish.\n\nA confused mind indeed.\n\nStyle & Setting\n\nThe first read was bizarre, but by the third read, I felt like I understood the story. The setting is behind a rock where the man is waiting for the incoming missionary. As he waits, he reviews his journey to this point. You literally read the inner-workings of a confused mind. Page one gives this insight, “Since they cut out my tongue, another tongue, I don’t know, goes on wagging inside my skull, something is talking, or someone, who suddenly shuts up and then begins all over again.” Stories are abruptly interrupted by a flashback all the while punctuated by “gha gha”: the sound of a man with no tongue trying to swallow.\n\nA Story of Religious Zeal\n\nThe missionary is a zealot through and through, from beginning to end. As he describes his lessons with the Catholic priest, he recalls the priest saying of him, “Intelligent child, but stubborn as a mule.” A little later he describes the headmaster at the seminary trying to stop him from condemning himself, “Oh no, there is good in you!” Good! There was only sour wine in me, that’s all, and so even better, for how can a man become better when he is not bad, I had understood that much in everything they taught me. That was the only thing I did understand, a single idea, and intelligent mule that I was, I would take it to its logical conclusion.”\n\nAs I said, the seminary tries to stop him from leaving because “it wasn’t missionary country, I was not mature, I had to prepare myself specially, to know who I was, and I still had to be tested . . .” He then condemns the priests for not aspiring to anything more than converting “decent people.”\n\nI won’t go too much into his description of his imagined encounter with the inhabitants of Taghaza. Here is a post describing his desire to subjugate the inhabitants through his non-violent encounter. He would prove God’s worth by enduring whatever they threw at him. The irony here is that the subjugation that he envisages will happen to him.\n\nNext, the man is tortured by the inhabitants. He is kept in a dark room with some grain thrown to him once a day. He lives with his own waste. He is beaten with whips and his tongue is twisted off. And yet he converts to the fetish in the midst of his torture. “I learned to worship the immortal soul of hatred.” He says of the fetish, “Never had a god so possessed me or enslaved me, my whole life day and night was devoted to him, and pain and the absence of pain – wasn’t that joy?”\n\nHe looks back at his life as Catholic missionary and condemns it, “The good is a daydream, a project endlessly proposed and pursued with exhausting effort, a limit never reached, its reign is impossible. Only evil can go to the limit and reign absolutely, it must be served in order to establish its visible kingdom . . . down with Europe, reason and honor and the cross.” Speaking of Christ, he says, “Lord of gentleness, whose very name revolts me, I deny him, for I know him now. He dreamed and he wanted to lie, they cut out his tongue so that his speech should no longer deceive the world, they pierced him with nails, even his head, his poor head, like mine now, what a muddle, how tired I am, and the earth did not tremble, I’m sure of it, it was not a righteous man they had killed, I refuse to believe it, there are nor righteous men but wicked masters who established the reign of the implacable truth.” Even in his renunciation of Christ, he identifies himself with Christ.\n\nAfter his conversion to the fetish, the man hears of a Father Beffort who will arrive before the garrison of troops. The man is shocked that the inhabitants have invited this priest and the garrison to their city, “The reign of evil would be postponed, there would still be doubt, they would waste more time dreaming of the impossible good, exhausting themselves in sterile efforts instead of hastening the coming of the only possible kingdom.”\n\nThis is when he plots his escape from the city in order to kill Father Beffort. This is a very interesting moment. When he was in the Catholic seminary he snuck off in order to go to Taghaza and now he sneaks out of Taghaza. In both cases he leaves the community because of his zealotry. In both cases he castigates his community for their lack of aspiration; the seminary for converting “decent people” and the people of Taghaza for not spreading “the reign of evil.” His zeal has consumed him.\n\nHe finally shoots Father Beffort and for good measure, smashes his face with the butt of his rifle. He raises his hands to the sky, but he is crying, “Why must I weep at the moment of triumph?” He then has a fantasy of the fetish’s reign over Europe, “Oh my masters, they will conquer the soldiers then, they will conquer the word and love, they will rise up from the deserts, cross the seas, fill the light of Europe with their black veils . . . the mute hordes with hobbled feet will make their way beside me in the desert of the world.” He will have company in his crippled condition. “I am laughing, I love the blow that nails me, crucified.”\n\nThe man is caught in some form or fashion and is awaiting his death. His language of crucifixion, with obvious parallels to Christ, continues. Twice he says that he is thirsty, and then, “O fetish why hast thou forsaken me? It’s all over (it is finished).” Prior to this he denounced Christ as deserving of death, and yet he cannot escape the language of his Catholicism.\n\nAnd yet again, as his weeping hints toward, the man begins to wonder if has made a mistake in his conversion, “Ah! What if I were mistaken again! . . . Leave behind that face of hatred, be good now, we were mistaken, we shall begin again, we will rebuild the city of God’s mercy, I want to go home.”\n\nThe man reaches out to a hand for help. The inner-narrative ends and we read, “A fistful of salt fills the mouth of the babbling slave.”\n\nAlbert Camus is quickly becoming one of my best buds. I love his writing style and his existential ruminations are exhilarating. I’m slowly making my way through his book of short stories Exile & the Kingdom. I have read “The Adulterous Wife” and it spurred these thoughts on marriage. The next story is, “The Renegade, or a Confused Mind.” It’s the story of zealous Catholic missionary intent on converting those nasty pagans in a mysterious city of salt, somewhere in Algeria. Upon arrival the missionary is tortured in front of the tribe’s fetish. He is converted to the tribal religion and, again, becomes a zealot. He then hears that another missionary is coming and, against the wishes of the tribe, goes out to kill the missionary in the hopes that this will spur the tribe to defend itself and therefore spread the gospel of the fetish.\n\nMore can, and will be said, about this story. But one of the scenes that grabbed my attention was before his conversion to the religion of the tribe. He is imagining the conversion of the tribe to his Catholic faith and it goes like this,\n\n” ‘Here is my Lord, look at him, he never strikes or kills, he commands in a gentle voice, he turns the other cheek, he is the greatest of lords, choose him, see how he made me better, offend me and you’ll have proof.’ Yes, I believed and I felt better, I had fattened up, I was almost handsome, I wanted to be offended. When we walked in tight black rows in the summer under the Grenoble sun and passed girls in light dresses, I did not look away, not me, I despised them, I waited for them to offend me and sometimes they would laugh. Then I would think: ‘Let them strike me and spit in my face,’ but their laughter was really just as bad, bristling with teeth and cutting remarks that tore me apart, the offense and the suffering were sweet! . . . in short I wanted to be an example, me too, so they would notice me, and in noticing me they would pay homage to what had made me better, praise my Lord through me.”\n\nA little later, “They would offend me, of course, but the offenses did not frighten me, they were essential to the demonstration, and by my endurance I would subjugate those savages, like a powerful sun. Powerful, yes, that was the word I kept rolling around on my tongues, I dreamed of absolute power, the kind that forces the adversary to kneel on the ground, to capitulate, that converts him in the end, and the blinder, crueler, more sure of himself he is, wrapped in his own conviction, the more his surrender proclaims the royalty of the one who provoked his defeat . . . I wanted to be recognized by the executioners themselves, to cast them on their knees and make them say, “Lord, here is Thy victory,” to reign at last with a single word over an army of the wicked.”\n\nThe irony is that this scene plays out in the missionary’s own life. It is he who “kneels on the ground” while being so zealous for his convictions. An amazing scene for many reasons. But the thing I noticed was how the missionary’s non-violence at the abuse of his imagined persecutors was still rooted in desire for absolute power. As someone who is convinced of the necessity of non-violence for discipleship, this is instructive. It is not enough to simply proclaim one’s non-violence or even act on it, but to have a thorough renewing of the mind where this desire for power over others is no more.\n\nAnyway, I’m sure I’ll have more to say about this story later. Food for thought. Love to hear your thoughts.\n\nA while back I picked up Albert Camus’ The Stranger. Quite enjoyed it and so I picked up a collection of his short stories called Exile and the Kingdom. The first story is “The Adulterous Wife.” There’s no actual adultery as in the Gospel story from which the name derives. Instead, we are allowed into a woman’s mind as she wrestles with the value of her relationship with her husband. The scene that really grabbed me was when they were both in bed. The wife watches her husband sleep and thinks about why she stays with him,\n\n“She simply followed Marcel, content to feel that someone needed her. The only joy he gave her was the knowledge that she was needed. He probably did not love her. Love, even hatred, did not have this closed face. But what was its face? They made love at night, without seeing each other, groping in the dark. Was there a love other than one in darkness, a love that would cry out in broad daylight? She did not know, but she knew that Marcel needed her and that she needed this need, that she lived by it day and night, especially at night – each night when he did not want to be alone or grow old or die, with that stubborn expression he assumed and which she sometimes recognized on the faces of other men, the only common expression of those madmen who camouflaged themselves as rational beings until delirium caught them and threw them desperately at a woman’s body to bury there, undriven by desire, what solitude and the night made them fear.”\n\nA little later,\n\n“No, he did not love her, he was simply afraid of anything but her, and they should have separated long ago and slept alone until the end. But who can always sleep alone? Only men who are cut off from others by vocation or misfortune, men who lie down every evening with death. But Marcel could never do that, he especially, a weak and helpless child, always frightened by pain, her child, indeed, who needed her and at that very moment gave a kind of groan.”\n\nLastly,\n\n“She too, after all, needed him, his strength, his little eccentricities, she too was afraid of dying. “If I could overcome this fear, I’d be happy . . .”\n\nShe then sneaks off into the night to stare up at the sky and for a brief moment, described somewhat erotically, she experiences release from the fear of death and consequently, her husband. Thus her “adultery.”\n\nThe idea that people get married because they have a need that the marriage partner fulfills is no great revelation. People get married for all sorts of reasons. Marriages fall apart and endure for all sorts of reasons. But the idea that some people get married out of a fear of death is very interesting to me. Earlier in the year I wrote a few posts on the church, marriage and celibacy (one and two). I don’t know that scripture offers this as a justification for the celibate life, but I wonder if one of the reasons why Jesus and Paul lift the celibate life up is in part because Christ has defeated death. If there is nothing to fear in death, then marriage has lost one of its primary drivers.\n\nThink about it. Marriage and even having children have their roots, in part, in securing ourselves in our old age. Children were social security. And, we need people to remember us after we die. But, if we are in Christ, then this fear is no more. “Because He lives, I can face tomorrow . . .” I am reminded of this story written by Benjamin Myers over at Faith & Theology about finding a nun’s possessions put outside on the curb. Give it a read.\n\nAgain, marriage has its place. I don’t mean to demean it. But I find the “sanctity” of marriage to be part of marriage’s problem. I understand that marriage was used as an analogy for Christ & the church. Maybe because I’m surrounded by people my age, it presents itself more vividly, but I get the sense that being chaste and/or celibate is strange more so because it means being alone rather than going without sex. Ok, sex is a big part of it, still . . . Marriage is the answer to loneliness, or so it is perceived. Or, marriage is comfort in the face of death’s inevitability.\n\nI’m sure I’m missing things. The dots connected like a good thirty minutes after I finished reading “The Adulterous Wife” and I’m posting this today.\n\nThrow the wheat up into the air and let the chaff fly away."
