It was extremely well organised by you and your team. I was amazed by the variety found in Algeria and believe I have to return to see more at some point in time. Please do pass on greetings to my guide Soumia and driver Mohammed as well as the colourful character in Ghardaia who was about to get married. TAM was an experience as well. Greetings to the owner of Mouflon- I must admit that I forgot his name- and his kind wife who invited me to her house. Everybody was so friendly.\n\nUrsula\n\nRob and I wanted to tell you how much we enjoyed our travels in Algeria. Both Azzedine and Mustafa were excellent. Azzedine was efficient, knowledgeable and nothing was too much trouble. Mustafa, too, could not have been more helpful and did a superb job of looking after us. All the hotels in which we stayed met our expectations. We would have no hesitation at all in recommending Algeria and your company to others.\n\nJane & Rob\n\nI am deeply indebted to my friend Ahcicene Segouini, who hasn’t only taken exemplary care of my tour groups through his company but also, at his expense, facilitated this journey. I was driven skilfully and with good humor over a very large distances by Mustapha Gueraini and was accompanied for the much of the time by Abdelkader Bensalah, who I have also long counted as a friend and whose acquaintance with antiquities staff through the country greatly facilitated my task.\n\nDr Philip Kenrick\n\nMake Tour Enquiry\n\nI agree that my submitted data is being collected and stored."
