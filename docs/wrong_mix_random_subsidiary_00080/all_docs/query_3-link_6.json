        "text": "Streaming on demand October 7 through November 21, 2021, Lantern Theater Company’s U.S. premiere digital production of The Plague was adapted by contemporary British playwright Neil Bartlett, based on a 1947 novel by French writer, journalist, and philosopher Albert Camus. Camus’ work, including The Plague, was informed by his experiences growing up in French Algeria and working for the Resistance in Nazi-occupied Paris.\n\nAlbert Camus was born in 1913 in Algeria during the 1830–1962 period of French rule. Though he and his family were poor, they were also accorded the privileges of French citizenship that more affluent French colonists enjoyed — but that Arab and Berber Algerians (the majority of the population) were denied. Growing up a witness and beneficiary of the brutality of colonialism left a lasting mark on Camus and his writing; he was a supporter of granting citizenship to all Algerians, and he spoke out in favor of reforms and concessions demanded by the Algerian people. However, he never supported full independence, and he remained neutral during the Algerian War. He had hoped instead that French, Arab, and Berber Algerians could live together with greater equity, but still under ultimate French rule.\n\nHis stance on fascism was more straightforward than his complicated relationship with colonialism. A staunch opponent of totalitarianism and fascism, Camus returned to Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943 after escaping it two years earlier. He began working for the Resistance. He wrote for and edited the underground Resistance paper Combat, using a pen name and fake ID cards to avoid capture by German forces. Over the rest of his life, he was a pacifist and opponent of capital punishment, and leaned toward anarchism in his beliefs about the role and power of the state.\n\nCamus won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 at 44 years old, the second youngest winner ever in that category. The Nobel Committee gave him the award “for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times.” His oeuvre, which includes plays, novels, and essays, is often categorized as absurdism and existentialism (though he rejected the latter label). It often dealt with the lack of meaning — or at least the lack of a knowable meaning — of existence, what he once called the “confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.” But his belief in individual human morality and freedom kept him from nihilism; Camus believed humans should accept the essential absurdity of existence and then go on to live ethical lives of self-determined meaning.\n\nIn writing the novel The Plague, Camus was inspired by cholera outbreak that struck the Algerian city of Oran in 1849. But while the given circumstances and events of The Plague’s medical emergency might be bracingly familiar to us today, Camus set his story in the 1940s for a particular reason: He was using the metaphor of a biological plague to warn against the rise of political fascism. Having lived in Paris during the Nazis’ approach and initial occupation and then returning later to resist them, Camus saw the insidious ways that fascism could take hold, first slowly and then swiftly. He also saw the ways that people under fascism’s boot can adapt and adjust to a new normal, shedding elements of their humanity to survive under its oppression — or banding together to force it back.\n\nCamus knew, shortly after the Nazis were defeated, that fascism would not be stamped out forever. In The Plague, he warns that something in human nature will allow an outbreak to happen again. Like a virus and its victims, the conditions and hosts may change, but the disease can always infect again. True to his belief in human morality and freedom, he also argues that if we remember and are vigilant against the ways in which fascism infects, we can also make a better, freer world. For Camus, it is only by collective action that we can hope to defeat the plague.\n\nRelated reading: Two Plagues: Biological and Political — Pandemics as metaphor and mirror of political plagues, in life and art"
