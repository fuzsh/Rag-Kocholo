It’s about decency. It may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency.\n\nThe personal and social struggle forced upon us by Covid has been extraordinarily revelatory in what it has revealed about our common humanity. And when we trace the trajectory of the pandemic we cannot but avoid the harsh truth that Covid denialism began, here in the UK, at the level of government."
