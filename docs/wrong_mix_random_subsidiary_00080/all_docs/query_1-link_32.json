        "text": "Albert Camus’s complex novel “The Stranger” is about an innocent person who chocks society by not accepting the rules and social conventions of the absurd society. Through main character’s circumstances, the author represents that Meursault, a protagonist, is an absurd hero who rejects the social conventional idea of love and marriage, however, his definition of love revolves around physical connection with the partner. One main existential theme of this novel is that the human life is meaningless, and love, sex and marriage are social conventions of the absurd society. Although love is the most meaningful feeling we know of, it works in the opposite way for Meursault; he is not interested in conventional love; rather, he seems to proposing that love be based on physical connection and sexual desires. Meursalt love for Marie is based on the fact that he values the physical relationship with Marie and rejects the idea of conventional love and marriage.\n\nThroughout the novel, Meursault’s continual concentration on Marie’s body and his lack of interest in her personality demonstrate that he has feelings of lust and desire because of her beauty.One day when Marie visits Meursault, he feels very happy to see her in “pretty red-and-white striped dress and leather sandals”(34). He just notices her “firm breasts”(34) and “her face”(34). His expressions and commentary about Marie’s body figure suggests that his happy feelings toward Marie are only based on physical and sexual pleasure. Later on in , the Stranger, Marie comes to visit Meursault in prison, and says him to have “hope”(73) ;he gets attracted by her “striped dress”(73) and “sun-tanned face”(73), therefore he wishes to “squeeze her shoulders through her dress” and thinks “I didn’t really know what else I had to hope for other than that”. This represents that even while he’s in prison, he can only be comforted by the physical, not by words or emotional support.\n\nMoreover, Marie visits to see Meursault because her affection for him evokes a deeper sentimental and emotional attachment.; however, Meursault only misses Marie because he misses sex. Their relationship reveals a lot of similarities and differences between them on basis of emotions and actions."
