        "text": "Suture\n\nFirst, Jessica Hopper linked to this interview recently, making me revisit an old favorite: \"But speaking of lesbianism, tell me about your mom’s favorite song on the new record.\" Check out this interview Miranda July did with Khaela from the Blow. (From/who is the Blow? I don't know how what is proper to use.)\n\nI keep giving this Mary a shout-out, so I think it's high time another Mary gets one. The East-Coast Mary has revived her blague Cindy Shmerman, which you should check out.\n\nTo the point, I was talking about Suture with West-Coast Mary a couple weeks back. As she said, anything with both Kathleen Hanna and Sharon Cheslow is bound to be awesome. Suture features Kathleen's signature roar, but is perhaps more similar to Viva Knievel than Bikini Kill, mixing grunge, post-punk, and general brattiness. I believe they performed at IPU's Girl Night (aka punk rock dream come true).\n\nAnd we're back to my shitty photobooth pictures...\n\nSuture released a 7\" in 1992, a split release between Decomposition and Dischord. My favorite is the more delicate B-side \"Pretty Is.\" They contributed these three songs (\"Good Girl,\" \"Falling,\" and the aforementioned \"Pretty Is\") to the compilation cassette A Wonderful Treat, which included another one-off Kathleen Hanna project, Wondertwins. I'm going to include all four tracks on A Wonderful Treat in this upload. The 7\" is long out of print, so snag it if you can!\n\nSuture- four tracks\n\nNeonates\n\nI gave this band a little bit of a shout out, and now it's time for a more proper one. Neonates are a new-ish band from the LA area. They pretty much got started when Mary wrote lyrics/recorded a few songs based on some interviews for a global sexualities class. This post is long overdue, and since I finally mailed a mix to Mary yesterday that I had been meaning to send out for a few months, I figure this should make an appearance as well.\n\nNeonates play mid-paced post-punk with plenty of no-wavey/new-wavey yelping, as if it were Max’s Kansas City in 1979, fitting in the league of girl-fronted arty punk bands coming from the West Coast these days-- think a more no-wavey Brilliant Colors, for example. The band’s variation comes from a combo of dual guitars at times and guitar-bass at others along with Mary’s perpetually changing vocal pace. Occasional backed vocals and frequently hi-hat-happy songs = toe-tapping all the time. Perhaps Mary's killer podcasts might also hint at what her band sounds like.\n\nThey put out a split CS with Pussy Patrol from France on ClanDestine Records (UK). You can get it here. You should join me in talking them into venturing out to the East Coast for a tour (hint, hint).\n\nNeonates- Demo\n\nSourpatch\n\nA bit of news to start off this post... My friend Lee who is in Titfit and The Facts We Hate is organizing a mini Brooklyn girl punk fest on Thursday, October 21. Hopefully you can make it!\n\nPicking up where my Bad Banana post left off, I have been crazy about Sourpatch for some time now. They played at Platonic Sleepover House a couple falls ago, but I couldn't go to the show and have been kicking myself ever since!\n\nI have been in love ever since the Sourpatch demo- a dose of delightfully fuzzy pop. Their LP, which came out late last year on Happy Happy Birthday to Me Records, took it in a slightly more art-punky direction while retaining the poppiness that hooked me to begin with, not dissimilar from some of their neighbors (Brilliant Colors for example)... perhaps most akin to a more art-punk Tiger Trap. I've always found in interesting that this band shares a drummer with the grindcore band In Disgust; I think the drums sound pretty rad on this record, coming in nicely at the end of \"Never (Ever Ever) Enough\" for example. I think recordings of little kids speaking kind of creep me out, so I always skip the first track, but I think \"Fun\" is my absolute favorite. Topics generally go along with standard indie pop themes of crushes (shocking given the title of the album) and so forth, but the lyrics never sound totally cliche or forced. \"Toothache\" has some pretty good dueling boy-girl vocals, which I'm always partial to. I would say this is my favorite pop full length of 2010, but I think it actually came out last year.\n\nThis one will only be up for a month, as per request from the band.\n\nGet it from HHBTM\n\nBad Banana\n\nSo last Monday morning I woke up around 5:30 or 6 am for no reason. The door to my room is possessed and creaks back and forth, seemingly endlessly. After about a half hour of that, I decided the internet would be a much more productive thing to do. I'm not a fan of all this facebook crap where people invite you to be a fan of their band and what not because I like to be all allusive on the internet (obviously why I write a blog). Anyway, turns out this fateful Monday morning a great great thing happened because Katie invited me to be a fan of her and Allison's new band, Bad Banana. These tracks would be enough to get me super excited and then I glanced to the bottom left corner to see \"tour with SOURPATCH east coast, USA.\" (More on Sourpatch to follow shortly, but hopefully you already know that they rule.)\n\nBut seriously, holy shit. For anyone who loves P.S. Eliot, especially their demo, Bad Banana is essential. Perfectly glorious fuzzy pop punk, probably a little bit more on the indie pop side. I've been listening to almost nothing else since Katie sent it to me. Each of them wrote half the songs and then recorded them, and then they were all mashed together into one demo, so you can try to guess which song is by which sister. (I'll put the answers in the comments.)\n\nMy new favorite punk show love song is \"Stand Next to Me.\" Cutest fucking lyrics ever: \"I don't know the words to this song, I want you to come sing along and put your arm around me/Stand next to me/I see you across the room and I'd like to get to know you/You seem to be in high demand but you're talking to me about your favorite bands-- Descendents & Dinosaur Jr./Maybe I should have spoken up sooner/I'm not looking for a boyfriend, but if I was I would like you to be him.\" That is what my crush on Bad Banana is like.\n\nBad Banana- Crushfield\n\nTape coming soon\n\nBlass\n\nThis one goes out to my darling friend Jess, who loves this 7\" as much as I do. It's another 7\" unearthed from the Record Hospital coffins, the first 7\" of two by German indie pop band Blass. I know this record came out in 1990 on Bad Moon Records, but not much else beside that.\n\nYou can see a few more reviews on my lovely photobooth picture of the copy in the RH collection.\n\nThis is in many ways more of a single than an EP for me as I only ever really listen to \"Bad Effect.\" I love the touch of art punk/indie rock they introduce from the beginning of the song with the bass line along with lazy jangling guitars and perfect pop lines like \"because my heart still burns only for you.\" \"Short Time\" certainly has some hooks as well, but who really cares when you have a pop song as superb as \"Bad Effect\"? I know Jess would back me up here.\n\nBlass- s/t 7\"\n\nMeat Joy\n\nWell, it has been a while. Good news is that I'm settled in my new home and have quite a few posts stocked up. Credit to Baris for the introduction to this one, and to Phoenix Hairpins for the link.\n\nHere's the sole, hard-to-track-down LP from Houston's Meat Joy. Only 1500 were pressed by Flesh & Blood Records in 1984, each with a different cover. Totally queer, totally weird, stripped down post-punk. My favorite is the ambling pop jam \"Another Pair,\" complete with snapping; some matter-of-fact promiscuity going on here. Meat Joy add some feminist social commentary with \"Slenderella\" and some criticism of hardcore with \"Proud to Be Stupid,\" which always reminds me of a quote from a Huntington Beach punk in Mark Andersen and Mark Jenkins' Dance of Days: \"The geeks, the people with new wave ties… When we see someone at a gig that we don’t like, we fuck them up.\" I'd been curious to know how this band interacted with a lot of the queer punk bands from Texas who were similarly turned off by the whole muscle head hardcore mentality. (For more on that check out the article on queer punks in Austin in MRR's queercore issue from last October.)\n\nMeat Joy- Self-Titled\n\nLibyans- Paralyzed\n\nKeeping a low profile these days but still one of the best bands in Boston, Libyans continue recording more than most other bands around. This time it's a one-sided, two-song 7\" with an etched B-side. I'm not sure if they all look the same (got the record-release edition when they played at Record Hospital Fest), but as always, you can expect great packaging from Libyans. (Mostly I'm thinking of their airplane-equipped 12\".)\n\nAnyway, the \"A-side\" (really just the first song), \"Paralyzed\" is going to be on the band's upcoming Sorry State 12\". Similar to their other 7\"s, the A-side is really more of the single, the catchy more Dangerhouse-esque song where the B-side packs a bit of a harder touch. On \"Paralyzed\" Liz even sounds a touch snottier, at least at the beginning of the song. We've gotten some backing vocals before, but Dan (Libyans' drummer) counters Liz on \"Keep Waiting.\" Normally I'm not a huge fan of bands releasing a single as an album teaser or whatever, but \"Keep Waiting\" is worth getting this record. In fact, one reviewer called it \"the most poignant love song Panella has ever written.\" (Scroll down all the way on that link. You know it's really saying something if you've ever heard Corner Club.) In all seriousness though, from the bass line starting off the song to the perpetually scratchy guitar riffs, you want to listen to \"Keep Waiting.\"\n\nLibyans are mostly on a break for the summer, but hopefully you can catch the tail end of the Eunuch tour and their new 7\" (Liz plays bass in that band) or Foreign Objects (Dan also drums with them).\n\nLibyans- Paralyzed 7\"\n\nBuy it from Upstate Commerce or Sorry State\n\nLAST CAFFEINE BLUES (April 29, 2010)\n\nAnd so goes our last show ever. Thanks to Adanma, Steve, Rob, Jim, Liz, Rachael, Milli, Karen, Sarah, & Alejandra for stopping by. Matt gets an extra special gold star for coming to almost every show this semester. It's been a good run.\n\nDownload it here.\n\nGray Matter- \"Caffeine Blues” | Food for Thought (LP, 1985) | R&B\n\nP.S.

Eliot have a new EP on Freedom School Records called Living in Squalor. Second, they did a short but sweet tour about a month ago at this point with Virginia's the Two Funerals. They'll also be hitting the road with Football, Etc. from Houston this summer. I just about peed myself with excitement at the St. Patty's Day show (some evidence here, thanks to Rob's trusty video camera), so definitely make your way to a show in your area.\n\nArtwork by Kate Wadkins.\n\nAs for the EP, it's pretty along the lines of Introverted Romances in Our Troubled Mines, which clearly can only be a good thing. Think Lemuria, Tsunami, Discount, and a bit more '90s indie rock. Four new songs plus the a new version of \"Broken Record.\" I was going to say what my favorite new tracks are, but I really can't decide... \"Cry Uncle,\" \"Acid Flashbacks,\" \"Dark,\" \"Bear Named Otis,\"-- I really don't know. With \"Acid Flashbacks,\" Katie's voice is just so earnest at the end. \"Bear Named Otis\" has some of the start-stop business that I loved so much in \"Sore Subject\" off the LP.\n\nI thought \"Broken Record\" was really a dark horse from the demo, the kind of song that doesn't jump out at you quite as much at first, but after you've been listening for the 25th time or so (I've probably listened to that about 10 times that amount), you realize just how awesome it is. I've had extensive discussions about this, and I think, like for many of my friends, the songs rerecorded from the demo will always remain in their original version in my mind, but I still enjoy hearing the more polished versions. I have to say though, I didn't have to adjust to the abrupt change in recordings, so I've eased into this version, and the EP as a whole pretty much instantly falling in love as I always do with this band.\n\nOn Living in Squalor, P.S. Eliot remain solid where they have been in the past, primarily Katie's songwriting (check out King Everything, her solo project, if you haven't already). In addition to that, I think Allison's drumming really comes together on this one, better recorded... tighter and looser simultaneously- not ever forced while remaining pretty seemlessly fluid. Will's guitar too, especially the slight scratchiness on \"Bear Named Otis.\" I think you can really tell that this band has started to come together as their line-up has solidified, yet they haven't become stale. I always have to cut myself on from continuing to ramble about this band because really just listening to their songs will tell you more than I ever could.\n\nGrab this 7\" from Freedom School for just $5 plus $2 shipping for up to three copies, and feel free to get in touch at or paypal (probably helpful to note somewhere what you're ordering) thehunchback@hotmail.com.\n\nP.S.

Luckily Mary Jane (P.S. check out her new band, Neonates) sent me some goodies. I did a quick search to see if anyone had posted these before, pretty much only to find results that Grass Widow had been touting the band as an influence. Well, if you want to listen to them for that reason, then here they are. If for other reasons, here they are still.\n\nHere's a little bit of history: \"The Neo-Boys, who came from the ashes of Portland’s first all-girl punk band (Formica and the Bitches) had two proper records in their day: A self-titled 7” on Greg Sage’s Trap Records in 1981, and the Crumbling Myths LP on Joe Records in 1982. They also had a couple of songs on the classic early PDX punk comp 10/29/79, a live LP that also included the Wipers, and Sado-Nation.\" (by Golnar at Maximum Rock n’ Roll)\n\nI first got hooked on their 7\" after finding it among our endless number of 7\"s over at the Record Hospital, but lately it's been all \"Poor Man's Jungle\" for me. A couple weeks ago I traded some books with Chuck who puts together the Messthetics comps. He's working on a new girl-band comp and was talking about the idea of uniquely women's music versus just working from the tradition of pre-established male tropes. Anyway, I think Neo Boys along with others like the Raincoats really exemplify this approach within sort of post-punk/art-punk realms.\n\nNeo Boys discography\n\nNo Boys Allowed!
