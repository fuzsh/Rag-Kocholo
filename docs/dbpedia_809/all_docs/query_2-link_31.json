        "text": "Scope and Contents\n\nWritings and Research includes subject files of clippings, articles, and publicity organized by topic, as well as drafts of Young's writings about the topic (articles written by Young are marked as \"by CMY\"). This series also contains a small amount of correspondence, which the archivist chose to leave interfiled to facilitate patrons researching these topics as well as to avoid artificially separating the materials from their original organization. The Correspondence series includes \"Fan Mail,\" \"Hate Mail,\" \"Crazy Mail,\" and \"Documents of Historic Import\" as organized and labeled by Young himself, as well as personal and professional correspondence. Juvenilia consists of writings and ephemera from Young's childhood through his graduate education at Columbia University. The Personal series includes materials relating to Young and his family, such as certificates, legal and financial documents, diaries and journals, and photographs of Young and his interviewees. Zines and Publications consists of Young's collection of punk and political zines as well as miscellaneous magazines and pamphlets. Miscellaneous includes any items whose contents could not be identified by the archivist in order to classify them into any other series. The Notebooks series includes nearly 300 notebooks containing Young's interview notes and drafts of writings. Audiovisual and Born-Digital includes drafts of Young's writings and interviews on a variety of formats, as well as albums and demo tapes sent to and collected by Young.\n\nArrangement\n\nThe collection is arranged into the following series: Writings and Research, Correspondence, Juvenilia, Personal, Zines and Publications, Miscellaneous, Notebooks, and Audiovisual/Born-Digital. Writings and Research are arranged alphabetically; there is some overlap between subseries, such as \"Led Zeppelin\" and \"Robert Plant,\" but the archivist attempted to differentiate based on the primary subject of the material. Additionally, some of the subseries in Writings and Research are subject files put together by Young himself; a list of the subseries originated by Young can be found in the Vertical File. Correspondence is arranged following Young's classifications, and within those subseries, by the Rolling Stone issue number in which the article discussed was featured. The rest of Correspondence is arranged chronologically. Juvenilia is organized into three main life stages: grade school, college, and graduate school. Zines and Magazines are arranged alphabetically and have (non-exhaustive) scope and content notes listing the musicians and bands discussed within, where applicable. Notebooks are numbered in order to differentiate between them, but are arranged in no particular order. A scope and content note on each notebook lists some of the contents and topics within, though again, these are not exhaustive."
