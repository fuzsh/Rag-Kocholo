        "text": "Preface: Confessions of a Bottom-Feeder\n\nI’ve decided to throw my hat in the yearly playlist ring, just at about the time everyone is again questioning whether Spotify’s whole deal is too gross to continue abiding. I’ve decided: yeah, probably too gross, but not enough to get me off the platform yet, for reasons I’ll get into below.\n\nI am standing on the shoulders of giant playlists, so this is the part where I link to projects by Brad Shoup and Jonathan Bogart and Centuries of Sound to name only a few. (If you click through those folks’ links, you’ll find even more people doing this work.)\n\nI’m not much of a researcher per se. My process is connected to a highly intuitive slog that I call Spotifreeganism, which I’ll describe below. That process makes it much less complete and subject to a lot of weird omissions – but also inclusions of stuff that maybe even the artists don’t remember putting out.\n\nBut I do enjoy putting songs together onto shiny discs. This is a collection of 25 80-minute CD-R mixes that can actually be burned to one CD each. There are good clues as to whether you’ll actually want to listen to the disc, so you can skip by 20’s. That mix CD format is how I’ve almost always engaged with music, and it hits a sweet spot between manageable listening and enough space for some archival curios or personal favorites. It’s exactly the amount of time you need to create a snapshot of an idea, a genre, or a vibe.\n\nBecause these are just snapshots, the goal isn’t completism. I play fast and loose with eligibility (Harvey Danger and Shania Twain put out albums in 1997 that had no impact anywhere until 1998, but Eiffel 65’s ‘98 album had no impact until 1999.) Everyone has a completism mea culpa, but I really mean it – my research beforehand is minimal and I actively try not to include songs I genuinely don’t want to listen to. I’m happy to cancel people whose music I would otherwise include at some point in the past (Marilyn Manson, R. Kelly, and Kid Rock are all out).\n\nI only do “research” when I’m done. I go through the lists and do some google hunting and pecking. I’ll often look up something I assumed was obscure and be astonished to learn it was a UK #1 (The Temperer and Maya!) or something. Every song I put on the mix is something I actually want to listen to, and I intentionally left stuff off that I can’t stomach anymore (sorry Fastball), didn’t fit on a specific mix due to the 80-minute time limit (sorry Soulwax), or seems like it tips the balance too far to the “archive” column and not to the “mix” column – 6’s that I can’t pretend are 7’s.\n\nSo, Spotifreeganism. I’ve always been a music economy bottom-feeder. In the record shop ecosystem I’m the guy hoovering up dollar bin CDs. Most of my box sets have been acquired as big chains go out of business. I recently came into possession of a giant gray tub full of CDs from 1988-2008 and gleefully scavenged every last find from it. It’s the way I prefer to take in music anyway – sifting huge, indiscriminate piles of shit through the industrial sieve of my brain. It’s probably not a great look ethical consumption-wise; I find it hard not to think of music purchasing as a form of charitable giving, and I mostly give to people I actually know.\n\nFor the last four years, my music listening to current music has followed this process: I pull in curated lists of Spotify New Music Fridays (and a few other updated-weekly playlists by genre) from about 60 different countries, regions, and genres. Spotify’s interface eliminates most duplicates as I combine them into one list, taking something like 7,000 total tracks and whittling them down to 1,500 each week. I listen to those tracks for as little as 5 seonds and as long as two minutes while I do the dishes, putz around online at night, or fold the laundry. It’s about 3 hours of listening a week, spread out in increments in which I can multitask. If I find something that rings a bell, whether in five seconds or two minutes (and I don’t overthink it), I put it on a separate list that I revisit once a month, cutting that down to about 90 minutes of music per month.\n\nI’ve discovered that this is what my ears were built for – taking in enormous streams of musical data and churning out a listenable mix of the stuff I like. This is always how I’ve listened, whether I was on torrent sites as a college student or buying old teen pop CDs for the cost of shipping when it was wildly unfashionable (some of us kept our CD collections through the mid-aughts!). But Spotify has centralized the process and dramatically increased the amount of information I can take in from places I wouldn’t think to look. The vast majority of music that gets heralded in critical conversations falls through the cracks this way. But my old habits also haven’t changed: I spend a lot of time reading about music on the internet. I just listen to less of it, until it comes more urgently to my attention. So over the course of the year I not only have a working knowledge of what happened according to most music critic types, but also a huge list of music that very few people have even mentioned in the places I tend to hang out.\n\nSo I wondered if I could apply this workflow to a year and come up with a kind of shadow playlist of 1998 songs that very few people have ever heard of. This initial idea fell by the wayside almost immediately, as even a quick glance at top songs of the year led to maybe 50 songs I genuinely love and would want to include. But I also didn’t want to do a ton of leg-work, just wanted lots of music to wash over me. I am incredibly absent-minded and formal research practices activate deep resistance in my “attentional-issues” brain. Because I can’t direct my hyperfocus to the task, I am almost useless for any kind of rigorous historiography. But I have really good ears, and I pick stuff out really quickly.\n\nThe question was how to replicate the data stream itself without having to do the research. The answer was to use various filters in the Discogs library of music to create a list of about 13,000 albums originally released in 1998. (I only made it through 10,000 before I got a weird error message.) Only 1 in 5 of those albums is available on Spotify, and I would guess that for about three quarters, at least one song is available on YouTube. I always checked Spotify but only followed up with YouTube if my interest was piqued, which got less common the longer I slogged through the list. (There’s still a bonus disc of non-Spotify tracks.)\n\nI started with a baseline list of album releases culled from Acclaimed, Billboard, and a couple of critics I follow (especially Fast n Bulbous and Chuck Eddy’s recent “150 Albums” lists). As I went through the lists, I tried to pull at least one song from each available album into the master list of possible tracks.\n\nAnd then I dove in to the Discogs list. I picked albums out of the master list in a way that is utterly arbitrary, copying and pasting titles into Spotify if the title struck my fancy, if the picture was interesting, if the picture was particularly uninteresting, if I recognized the record label, or if I want to hear more from the country of origin. If it was in Cyrillic, Japanese, Greek, Arabic, or Turkish script, I’d see if it was on Spotify. I tried to focus on a few of my blind spots – especially metal, of which after several attempts I included just about 0% across 25 mixes (I really can’t stand to listen to almost any of it, though I had much more luck when I did a lighter version of this process for 1987 a few months ago).\n\nI would guess that I ended up actually testing 1 in 3 of 10,000 albums, of which maybe 1 in 3 of those hits an available album. That means I “engaged with” somewhere between a thousand and two thousand albums, almost certainly less than a fraction of music actually released in 1998. When I find something in Spotify, I see if there was a “hit” according to Spotify’s listen count, which usually means something was popular in its particular region, or that it was chosen for a Spotify playlist at some point and cumulative advantage did its thing. I play that track for 5 seconds, and if I recoil, I try two or three other tracks until I’m satisfied that something can go on the long list. If there’s no obvious standout, I start from track one and skip around.\n\nFor 1998, I ended up with a total of 1,200 songs I figured I might put on a list. I ended up with 535 songs across 25 80-minute CD-Rs. (Brad Shoup describes his first 500+ track playlists as charmingly tiny at this point, so I hope that someday he will just throw everything I found into his playlist grinder and triple the song count.) To make the mixes, I formed rough ideas around moods, genres, and a fres higher-concept lists to get a rough idea of what the mix might be – I have mixes called “vibes” and “unstoppable” and “indee” and “booty” – and I carved away everything that wasn’t an elephant.\n\nI don’t know how much interest this whole process is to anyone, but I do think identifying my own corner in the playlist environment has been useful in a self-reflective sort of way. I’m the guy who’s going to have a handful of songs you’ve never heard of that you love, and they won’t be the same handful anyone else will love, and if you ask me I won’t be able to tell you almost anything about them, except that they are good and deserve to be on a mix about 1998, and probably defined someone’s 1998. And you’ll know almost instantly whether a mix will interest you, so you can skip by 20’s, which I think is a plus, since you probably have lots of important things to do with your time.\n\nI’ll share each mix with a few words of explanation separately over the course of the next couple of weeks. You can follow the #98mixes tag to see them as they get posted here."
