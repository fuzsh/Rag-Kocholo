They were one of Canada's best hardcore bands which is evidenced in how sought after the \"First Impressions\" single is today. Many tributes have been paid to the band one of which was the bootlegged dedication record to Tim Yohannon which contained the song \"Love Rat\" by the band. In fact I think one of the reason's why \"Primitive Air Raid\" is so good is because of their song \"Suburban Life\" which in my opinion is the best song on the compilation. The band is now scattered across the country, but every few years they get together to play amd for some big name people. They opened for Flag at this year's NXNE and I was able to speak to the two Robs who play guitar and Doug-O on bass (Saturday June 15th). We spoke about their songs, their recordings, the sows they played, the bands they played with, the scene and their beloved practise space known as the Bleury Beach Club or the BBC for short. The interview was long and thanks to Eric Betlam for cleaning up the audio quality and spending a couple of hours with me cutting it down so that we could fit in the openng song \"1984\" and some brief underlying recordings by the band. This band deserves a re-issue and maybe a collected discography but here is a bit of their story.\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - 1984 (Generic)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nS.C.U.M. - Home away from home (Psyche)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview\n\nFAIR WARNING - You are the Scene (Self-Released)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - I'm Eighteen (Unreleased)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Big Takeover (Unreleased)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Love Rat (Generic)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Brave New World (Generic)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - 1984 (Generic)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - First Impressions (Unreleased)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Urban Cowboy (Generic)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Licence to Kill (Unreleased)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Gilligan's Island (Unreleased)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Meet Billy (Unreleased)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Rockin with Seka (Unreleased)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Interview (CIUT)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL - Subruban Life (Generic)\n\nRadio - Sunday, July 14th, 2013\n\nTonight's show is can be heard on the player above or downloaded as an MP3 file.\n\nWe start off with an interview and in studio session of Make No Gains, who are originally from Halifax, but now live and play in Toronto.\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - Dark Days (CIUT)\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - Interview (CIUT)\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - TV (CIUT)\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - Interview (CIUT)\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - Funeral Pyre (CIUT)\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - Interview (CIUT)\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - Take Pause (CIUT)\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - Interview (CIUT)\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - Noose (CIUT)\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - Interview (CIUT)\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - Born Alone, Die Alone (CIUT)\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - Interview (CIUT)\n\nMAKE NO GAINS - Place Holders (CIUT)\n\nThis set is a tribute to Spiderfest.\n\nCONTAGIUM - Pawns (Self-Released)\n\nBURNING LOVE - Pig City 1 (Southern Lord)\n\nASILE - Rouge (Rust and Machine)\n\nIDNS - Athabasca (Self-Released)\n\nRODENT LORD - Gestapo! Gestapo!\n\nSOME GIRLS - No Fun (625 Productions)\n\nLEATHER - No Motivation (Jade Tree)\n\nFRANTIC - Ghoul (Die Slaughterhaus)\n\nSIN 34 - Join the Race (Spinhead)\n\nTH'INBRED - The Shithole (Frozen Sound)\n\nTHE STATE - Attention (Statement)\n\nTHE DICKS - Kill from the Heart (SST)\n\nThis set is a statement about the inconsistent rulings in the courts in the U.S.\n\nYAPHET KOTTO - Fact or Fiction (Ebullition)\n\nSCREAM - Fight / American Justice (Dischord)\n\nARM THE INSANE - Even the blind can see (Reactor)\n\nCRIMINAL AUTHORITY - Die on your feet (Self-Released)\n\nPOINTED STICKS - What do you want me to do? (Trouble in Mind)\n\nTonight's demo feature is Abduction from Cincinnati who were reviewed in the June issue of MRR as being a style of bass driven hardcore associated with knuckle dragging and then explosive burst of circle pit action. The demo can be downloaded through bandcamp.\n\nABDUCTION - Abducted\n\nABDUCTION - Said and Done\n\nABDUCTION - No Break\n\nABDUCTION - Poser Dust\n\nABDUCTION - Fence Walkers\n\nMake No Gains studio 3 session\n\nMake No Gains found their way to the local pub at Hart House and I just happened to find them while scouring the area not realizing that the playing field parking lot, which is the usualy meeting place for bands for these studio 3 sessions, was behind a construction fence. We lugged amps and equipment from Hoskins up to the 3rd floor and everyone was in good spirits, but Daren the drummer warned me that he had to be out of there early because he was jamming with his new band IDNS after the session. I was thinking this was going to be impossible to get done in a short period of time, but then D'Arcy showed up and he had seen the band at La Fraction's show a few weeks earlier. D'Arcy said the band is super tight and he would be surprised if they needed to do multiple takes of any songs.\n\nMake No Gains are originally from Halifax but moved here because Cole, the singer and guitar player, got a job out here. The band came in tow, which is pretty incredible to do.\n\nWhen we get upstairs, Vince (the bassist) realized he left his patch chords and guitar strap back at the rehearsal space. We found a patch chord and he sat down and played for the session even though he wanted to get up and move around. He made due.\n\nThe band has just recorded nine new songs with someone from End Program (R.I.P.). But these songs seem like they are on their recent recording \"Power\". Jonathon Hawkes enginneered and mixed the session which includes the following songs:\n\n1. Dark Days\n\n2. TV\n\n3. Take Pause\n\n4. Place Holders\n\n5. Noose\n\n6. Funeral Pyre\n\n7. Born Alone, Die Alone\n\n8. Dark Days, ID 1\n\n9. Dark Days, ID 2\n\n10. Funeral Pyre EXD ID\n\nI tried to get the band to do a Cure song or two but they were pressed for time, Cole's voice was giving out, and they were just happy doing their own material.\n\nPunks and Rockers put together a medley from this session of a couple of songs so you can witness the mayhem as it is played live."
