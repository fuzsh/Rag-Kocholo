Holly Mitchell:\n\nIt is a classist, sexist, anti-democratic, anti-child, anti-family policy whose premise did not come to fruition, it did not accomplish what it set out to accomplish. So itâ€™s appropriate to take it off the books.\n\nAline Brosh McKenna:\n\nI just think a lot of the ways things are run are just terribly anti-family, it's one of those subtle things that just selects out women. If we want to include women and their voices and the only way to work on these shows is to prove you're a machismo guy, staying until midnight every night, women are going to opt out of that. Parents are going to opt out of that."
