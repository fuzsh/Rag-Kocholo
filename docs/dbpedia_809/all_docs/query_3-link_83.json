Codex\n\nIntroduction omic book heroes are rarely limited by the constraints of time and space. Villains from the future travel back to the modern era to challenge heroes born in some distant past, and teams take side-trips to battle cowboys or pirates as part of bizarre plots to change the future. Time travel has been a cliché of comic books almost as long as superheroes have. But introducing time travel also opens a Pandora’s box of new storytelling tropes and problem-solving tools that can seem overwhelming.\n\nC\n\nChapter 1: Into the Time-Stream! looks at what purpose time travel might serve in a story and the common storytelling tropes associated with it thatyou can incorporate or avoid to create your own unique experience. It also looks at how time itself works (at least in fiction) to explain how time travel, alternate timelines, and similar concepts work. Finally, it introduces some basic rules to use in your campaign and advice to handle the uglier points of human history.\n\nThe Time Traveler’s Codex is a sourcebook for Mutants & Masterminds that brings all the excitement of time-hopping campaigns and villains to your game. These pages present everything you need to know for running games where time travel plays a role, including character archetypes, new rules, and suggestions for establishing the quantum physical rules for your campaign. With this guide, your heroes might visit famous historical figures, witness great moments in history, and punch history’s greatest villains, all to save not just the city, but all of history as we know it!\n\nChapter 2: Time Traveling Heroes looks at time travel from the player side and provides advice on how to build a hero for a time-travel campaign or a temporally-stationary hero who happens to hail from the past or future. It includes advice on how technology-dependent skills might adapt to new eras and new Advantages and gadgets to help travelers get by no matter when they end up. This chapter wraps up with a half-dozen ready-to-play hero archetypes you can use as player characters or supporting cast for your own adventures.\n\nTime traveling heroes can spend multiple lifetimes protecting causality from self-serving chrononauts and timehopping villains, but even ordinary superheroes may run up against time travel in their otherwise modern lives. Just because the heroes don’t travel through time doesn’t mean villains don’t, and scientific mishaps can dump Roman legionnaires or the death-dealing machines of a robot-ruled future into their own backyard.\n\nChapter 3: Gamemasters in Time provides plenty of detailed advice to the Gamemaster when it comes to running campaigns that hop through history and how hero actions might affect the present. It provides numerous options for your campaign’s timeline, including multiple methods of time travel so you can decide which one works best for the adventures you want to run. The chapter also includes plenty of temporal hazards and minion archetypes to threaten your heroes in the line of duty, as well as a summary of the major players in the past and future of Earth-Prime. It also provides six common villain archetypes whose powers or origins lie in the distant past or far future and often terrorize chrononauts.\n\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK The Time Traveler’s Codex contains basic and complex looks at time travel in superhero worlds, but it also provides plenty of material for any campaign. It includes lists of new equipment and enemies from all across Earth’s history (and the future), as well as overviews of some of the most iconic time periods in the history of superhero comics, making it an invaluable reference for running your own campaigns set in the Golden Age of the 1940s, the Silver Age of the 1960s, or the Iron Age of the 1990s. This book provides a variety of rules options that you can use or ignore to make the most exciting time travel stories for your table, as well as plenty of advice for designing the rules for time travel in your campaign. You aren’t limited to a single model of how to journey into the past in Mutants & Masterminds, or even within a single campaign!\n\nCHAPTER OVERVIEW The Time Traveler’s Codex begins with the broadest strokes, describing how time works and how time travel factors in to comic book history before delving into increasingly specific topics like player-facing rules, Gamemaster suggestions, and niche details on a dozen different eras.\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nChapter 4: The Heroic Eras looks at the three most iconic 20th-century time periods for superheroes: The Golden Age stretching from the 1930s to the early ‘50s, the Silver Age of the late 1950s through the ‘70s, and the Iron Age of the ‘80s and ‘90s. Each section looks at the major cultural, historical, and political events of the time to give context to the heroes and comics of the day before providing game guidance like rules adjustments, new Advantages, and classic equipment. This chapter also looks at three major cities from the past: Golden Age Emerald City, Silver Age Freedom City, and Iron Age New York, as well as the heroes who called those cities home. Chapter 5: Eras of Adventure looks at some of the most iconic targets for time traveling superhero stories, from dinosaur-rules primordial Earth to the age of highseas piracy to the dystopian future. Each era provides an overview of the history and suggestions for incorporating superheroes, as well as offering a selection of iconic equipment and statblocks for visiting time travelers to encounter. Each also provides suggestions for Gamemasters looking to build their own historical superhero games set in these evocative time periods of the past!\n\n3\n\nMUTANTS & MASTERMINDS\n\nChapter 1: Into the Time Stream!\n\nW\n\nhat if we could change the past? What if we could visit and know the future? These are questions humanity has asked itself for as long as we have had a concept of time, and numerous stories have explored these questions and their implications. Time travel was one of the first themes explored in the genre of fiction that would become recognized as “science fiction” in H.G. Wells’s The Time Machine. It didn’t take superhero comic books long to latch onto the concept and begin telling stories about characters traveling through time, or even building entire series around the idea. At first, time travel, like space travel, primarily served to expand the range of settings for characters and stories. Heroes could visit the past and interact with mythic and historical figures, or travel into the future to see the “world of tomorrow,” such as in 1958, when Superboy became friends with three super-powered teens from the 30th century in the fateful Adventure Comics #247, the debut of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Eventually, time travel stories focused on the question of changing the past, causing the present (and therefore the time traveler’s future) to follow a different course. Heroic time travelers needed to be careful not to cause inadvertent changes, and often dealt with unscrupulous foes looking to deliberately change things for their own ends. In some cases, it was possible to repair changes in history, undoing them and allowing things to return to\n\n4\n\ntheir proper course. In other stories, time is too delicate a fabric to be rewoven, or so complex that any changes create whole other realities. The alternate timelines approach became so popular, in fact, that it formed a major trope of superhero comics: the concept of a multiverse, where many (if not all) possible timelines coexist and can even visit each other. Although major comic book superhero universes have periodically attempted to rid themselves of the notion of parallel worlds and alternate timelines—with varying degrees of success— the idea is persistent enough to crop up again and again. This chapter looks at these and other notions about time travel and how to use them in a Mutants & Masterminds game—from time travel as a one-shot plot device to a whole series based around traveling back and forth through the past, future, and alternate timelines.\n\nTIME TRAVEL IN YOUR GAME Using time travel as an element of your Mutants & Masterminds adventures requires consideration of several things about the concept: • How accessible is the means of time travel? • Is this a one-time jaunt or an extended journey? • To what degree can travelers interfere with history?\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nGETTING THERE (OR THEN) First off, what are the means of time travel and to what degree do the player characters control them? The Time Travel Codex discusses this in more detail later in this chapter and in Chapter 3, but if you’re going to include time travel at all, the first thing to consider is whether or not your heroes get to drive. Often in comic-book stories, the means of time travel is either an accident or something controlled by an outside force—a plot-device controlled by the Gamemaster. This is most effective for a quick “there and back” adventure that sends the characters to a particular location in space-time and offers them a return trip home if they tackle whatever issue(s) initially sent them chronologically wandering. Other scenarios grant the heroes the power to travel through time (mostly) under their own direction. This suits the series approach to time travel, giving the players some control in the story’s direction and even letting them use time travel as a tool to unravel mysteries or defeat foes, although the GM may still place limits on how the ability functions. A means of time travel that allows the players total freedom to choose when they use it and when and where they go requires a great deal more improvisation from the Gamemaster, given the range of possibilities.\n\nA VISIT OR A TOUR? Are the characters just going on a brief jaunt to another time? Or will their travels consist of multiple “jumps” and various destinations? Typically, the first is most associated with a one-shot adventure while the latter is more the approach to an ongoing series, but that is not always the case. The short visit is suitable for a story that takes place in another specific time period, such as having the heroes time-jump back to the Second World War, perhaps to meet and work with their heroic predecessors in the “golden age” of their timeline, or ending up in Ancient Rome, the Wild West, or any of the various other eras detailed in Chapter 5. The definition of “short” is up to you; characters might spend months or even years of their personal timelines in another era before the end of the storyline. A single timejump could be the start and end to an entire campaign, such as when Doctor Tomorrow traveled back to WWII to prevent an Axis victory, spending the entire war adventuring with the Liberty League before finally returning to the future. Time travel can even allow heroes to return to the present with accumulated memories, but without any physical time having passed, or even return before they left to undo the trip in the first place (see Paradoxes under Time Travel Tropes for more on this possibility)! Alternately, the story might involve multiple time-jumps and a tour through various eras, either with the heroes at the helm or at the mercy of whatever means of time travel they employ. For example, heroes could pursue a timetraveling thief who steals history’s greatest treasures,\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nChapter 1: Into the Time Stream! TIME TRAVEL TERMINOLOGY Comic books play fast and loose with time travel technobabble, but this book tries to use some terms consistently to avoid confusion. Causality: The basic sequence of cause-and-effect that leads form one event to another. For example: You trip, which causes you to fall, which causes you to skin your knee, which causes you to be in a bad mood the rest of the day, which causes you to fight with your boss, which causes them to fire you. Changing causality—changing the outcome of an event—can change what it effects. Chrononaut: Another word for a time traveler. Era: A vague period in time defined by sweeping themes, such as “the Renaissance,” or “the Golden Age of comics,” or “the lifetime of Lucy Hobbs Taylor, DDS.” Home Era: The period of time where a time traveler naturally exists, and from which they first began traveling through time. Time-stream: The strange, otherworldly medium that all timelines flow through. Exposure to the time-stream may have unusual effects on creatures, like making them more resistant to changes in time or causing strange mutations. Time Travel: Moving from one point in time to another without crossing the moment in-between. Time Traveler: Someone who has traveled through time at least once. Timeline: A single chain of events leading from the Big Bang to the end of the universe.\n\nbut only have the ability to follow in the thief’s chronal “wake”—and possibly to make it back to their own time— but otherwise they can only follow in their GM-controlled quarry’s passage through the past and future. Likewise, heroes could be sent on a quest to recover various things scattered across space-time—all while avoiding dangerous alterations to history as they know it—with the ability to move only between those specific eras. Time travel with multiple destinations can be an element of a single adventure, or of an entire time travel series. For the latter, travelers commonly have some type of “home base” they return to between time-jumps, such as a fixed headquarters or even a time-traveling vehicle large enough to fill this role. Such a place is often located in the time-stream itself, “outside” of ordinary time (see A Brief History of Time).\n\nCHANGING HISTORY Consider: Can history be changed due to the time travel in the story and, if so, can any changes be “fixed” or otherwise changed back by other time travelers? One of the most common time travel adventures involves someone either attempting to change history or (from the presentday perspective of the heroes) has already done so. The heroes then need to time-jump to the affected era in order to change things back, or prevent the changes from happening in the first place.\n\n5\n\nMUTANTS & MASTERMINDS\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME Of course, every point in time is “history” to some future point, so it is equally possible for time travelers from the future to show up in the heroes’ present, looking to change their history and rewrite the future they call home. This can be particularly problematic for the heroes if they do not know what future the intervention will cause or prevent. Do they trust people claiming to be from the future who are willing to change history? Is it moral to up-end the lives of billions of people who haven’t been born yet without their consent? What if future time travelers reveal they intend to kill a child who is destined to grow up to become history’s greatest villain? While it might seem like the answer to “can history be changed?” must be “yes” for a time travel scenario to work, that’s not necessarily the case. Resistant and mutable timelines (see Chapter 3) offer some “give” so that it isn’t easy to change the past. This can make for a greater challenge for characters hoping to change the timeline, or offer a margin of safety for those looking to avoid altering the present. Alternate timelines (see Time Travel Tropes, following) even allow both outcomes to occur! The timeline both changes and does not change, in that intervention simply creates a new alternate branch of time. A timeline that cannot be changed presents dilemmas and challenges for the heroes, placing some things outside their influence, or exacting a high price for changing them. Even a completely immutable timeline is still not without story potential, allowing heroes to visit past eras as passive observers to gather information, and possibly play out unknown past events. See the Immutable Time section of Chapter 3 for more about this idea. How does time travel work? Obviously, we can only talk about it theoretically, and there are many fictional models for how time travel might work, but the following is a fairly broad and inclusive one that is the default assumption for the nature of time and time travel in this book and in the Earth-Prime setting for Mutants & Masterminds.\n\nTHE OMNIVERSE The temporal dimensions—all of the past, present, and future of Earth, alternate timelines, and alternate dimensions—are contained in the “omniverse,” the structure containing all possible universes. Just as physical reality has three measurable dimensions—height, width, and depth—the greater omniverse adds three additional dimensions: the past, the present, and the future. Imagine all three dimensions of space compressed down and represented by a single point or dot. Extend that dot into a line and you have what is commonly known as a “timeline,” stretching from the present back into the past and forward into the future. The timeline connects these dots, moving from the past to the future. Every point on this line is “the present” for the universe at that moment. Everything stretching away from that timeline—sideways\n\n6\n\nthrough the omniverse—are varying states of quantum potential; all the “maybes” of the past, present, and future, the infinite sea of possibilities. Now imagine that timeline, not as an unbroken line, but as a series of overlapping points, a near infinite number of “present” moments, all connected to each other, like pearls on a strand. Each pearl or bead is the entire universe at that particular moment, the strand is the quantum connection or causality—literally the cause and effect of creation—linking those different moments into a line or chain. Although there’s a natural tendency to think of a timeline as straight, it actually bends, winds, and twists like a river, flowing through different possibilities in the omniverse to connect all its various points. What’s more, there isn’t just one timeline, but a potentially infinite number of them, like threads in a vast tangle or tapestry. Each thread winds its way through the omniverse, sometimes coming close to—but not quite crossing—another. New lines may branch off from a previous thread and strike out in its own direction. Follow the various timelines backwards into the past and they become fewer and fewer, possibilities collapsing down into a common shared history towards the singularity of the origin of the omniverse. Follow the timelines far enough into the future, and they likewise begin to thin out, consolidate, and collapse towards the inevitable end of the universe, of every universe. What lies beyond that Final Point remains as much a mystery as what lies before that First Point.\n\nTHE TIME-STREAM Now that you have the whole vast tapestry of timelines, winding through the near infinitude of the omniverse, put them into motion. While the past, present, and future co-exist “simultaneously” from the perspective outside an individual timeline, those threads are not fixed. Just like you can take a connecting link out of the chain or a bead off a strand and replace it with another one, so too can you take a point—a moment or collection of moments— out of a timeline, replacing it with another. Doing so changes time, just like a landslide might change the flow of a river. From the perspective of those “upriver” from the change, the future has shifted. From the perspective of those “downriver” from the change, the past has shifted. However, from the limited perspective “inside” a timeline, the so-called change seems like it has always been that way—a fish traveling that diverted river would only know it is swimming along the course of the river. The alterations are as much a part of the timeline as anything, so no one is aware that they have been changed along with it unless they watched the process from outside the river— outside time. These changing quantum connections—the “thread” that strings together all those pearls of the present—is how\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\ntimelines can shift, and why time travel allows changes in one part of a timeline to affect the rest of it. Timelines shift and change continuously. But there is a form of “time” outside time—all the space between those threads, the neck that wears those pearls—known as “the time-stream.” Just like planets orbit in the vacuum of space, timelines snake through the time-stream, held in predictable patterns by monstrously complex laws of quantum physics. The time-stream makes time travel possible. So long as you have a means of moving “outside” of your current timeline into the time-stream, and a means of propulsion within the quasi-matter that makes up this strange fourth dimension, you can travel to another point on the timeline and re-enter it, shifting your place in space-time. If you can navigate further away from your timeline, you can even reach other, “nearby” timelines entering them and shifting, not just forward or backward along your own timeline, but “sideways” into a parallel or alternate timeline.\n\nChapter 1: Into the Time Stream! causing their personal time to run faster than the rest of the world. Chronal energy exists both inside and outside of timelines. Corralled within a time, it flows at a steady rate, but drifting free in the time-stream, chronal energy forms strange tides and currents that may run faster or slower than nearby areas, or small eddies where time all but stops entirely. The rapid changes in chronal density can cause strange mutations, aging-related effects, or simply rip physical beings apart as their individual atoms crumble from the pressure of entropy. Consequently, wary time travelers should always bring their own supply of chronal energy with them when they journey the timestream, just like sailors in a submarine must bring their own supply of air. This is also why many means of time travel simply bore a “tunnel” through the time-stream that their time machine travels through: the tunnel itself is\n\nThe time-stream exists as a place outside time, inhabited by strange, alien beings as far removed from human beings as we are from potential twodimensional life. Entities outside a timeline have no effective “past” or “future” beyond their recollections. Changes to their home timeline won’t and can’t affect them while they remain outside of it, and some powerful travelers even set up hidden safehouses outside time to protect themselves from major temporal upheavals. Such a strategy is dangerous, however, as time will catch up with them once they return to their timeline, essentially making these castaways into temporal refugees.\n\nCHRONAL ENERGY For all the loops and twists time takes, it never doubles back on itself. Every timeline flows from start to finish, First Point to Final Point. If a timeline is a river and the time-stream is the world that river occupies, then chronal energy is the force of gravity constantly tugging the water of that river down to the sea. It pushes all the omniverse from the beginning of time to the very end. The river never flows uphill, and while outside forces can transport the water and the fish back up the hill, doing so pushes against this constant force. Most things inside a timeline share the same pressure of chronal energy, pushing them all downstream with the same pressure. If an outside force drains the chronal energy from someone, they move more slowly (or from their perspective, they move normally while the rest of the world rushes past faster than normal). Supervillains who can “stop” time (such as Downtime of EarthPrime’s Freedom City) actually pump themselves full of excess chronal energy,\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\n7\n\nMUTANTS & MASTERMINDS flooded with the chronal energy from the traveler's point of origin, leaving them safely protected from unexpected chronal pressures. Thrillseekers can even leave the safety of their vessel in these tunnels, insulated as they are from the chaos beyond. But if the tunnel collapses, or a careless soul collides with the wall, they may crash back into a random point of their original timeline or even be cast into the time-stream, trapped forever in an infinite moment.\n\nYou may also want to decide if chronal energy is related to tachyons (mentioned in the Time Powers section of Power Profiles), a theoretical subatomic particle that travels faster than light and violates our current understanding of causality. Chronal energy might represent the movement of tachyons, or tachyons may be the only thing in the omniverse immune to the force of chronal energy (thus making them a key element in how time travel works).\n\nTIME TRAVEL TROPES The following are some common elements of superhero time travel stories. At the least, they are things to consider using—or deliberately avoiding—because they may be expected to one degree or another. If you’re looking to create time travel adventures that feel more like comics, take these tropes into account, either finding ways to use them or to give them an unexpected twist.\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL TRAVELER For some reason, time travel happens by accident a lot, resulting in time travelers who are not particularly prepared or well-suited for the experience. It’s almost never a trained historian or quantum physicist who travels through time, but a bystander, con-artist, criminal, or underage family member. This often includes superheroes, who happen to stumble into the time-stream because of super-science devices, magic spells, cosmic conjunctions, accidents involving their powers, or weird explosions. It is even the case with deliberate time travel technology: An experimental time machine may be stolen, hijacked, activated by accident, or used in desperation, resulting in time travelers who don’t really know what they’re doing or even how to steer their chronological conveyance. Accidental time travelers have a tendency to mess up the timeline, simply because they don’t know what they’re doing. Most stories involving them focus on the travelers finding a way to get back to their own time while either avoiding changing the timeline or restoring the timeline they screwed up before they return home. Sometimes accidental travelers manage to get back only to discover they have accidentally changed their present, and now must go back again and fix it.\n\nAlternate timelines might exist naturally—with every major event spinning off two different timelines with different results, or even minor events creating a near-infinite number of parallel timelines with only the most subtle of differences—or may only result when the actions of time-travelers change the results of the otherwise predetermined course of history. Some alternate timelines are similar to their previous configuration, except for small differences (like the life events of a single person) while others are radically different (like an Earth where the dinosaurs never died out). In some cases, an alternate timeline may also be distinguished from a timeline’s “proper” configuration (see Proper History, following). A parallel timeline is a branching timeline that runs very closely to another, such that the differences between them are relatively small—again, an Earth where historical events took a slightly different course, as opposed to a universe which might lack an Earth or human life altogether. The further “sideways” one ventures out from their home timeline in the time-stream, the less overall similarity there is between timelines.\n\nDIMENSIONAL LAYERS\n\nALTERNATE TIMELINES\n\nTime travel tends to focus around the timeline of Earth, and other timelines with some variation of an Earth. However, the omniverse may contain a vast variety of other dimensions, some of them quite different from any variation of Earth’s universe. Some of these can be considered parallel or branching timelines in their own right, just ones that diverge much earlier, such that they share even less in common with Earth’s timeline. Such parallels might not even have the same physical laws as the prime timeline. This is particularly true of realities where magic holds sway over science and rationalism.\n\nThe structure of time contains both branching and alternate or parallel timelines, as well as the potential for travelers’ actions to place them in—or even create—whole new universes.\n\nIt’s up to the Gamemaster whether or not particular dimensions “beyond” Earth’s timeline are parallel or branching timelines of the omniverse, or different “layers” of an even greater dimensional structure beyond the concept\n\nAccidental travel also applies to characters ending up in parallel timelines, although in those cases there is typically less onus on them avoiding changing things. Though they may sometimes wish to refrain from revealing the reality of time travel to the inhabitants of any parallel timelines to prevent them from traveling to (or invading) other universes.\n\n8\n\nA branching timeline is one that splits into two or more separate timelines due to a major event or “nexus point” that can turn out two or more ways to produce two or more very different futures. Theoretically, only one timeline exists at the very beginning of the universe, and it rapidly splits into multiple timelines, over and over again, as time moves forward and the field of possibilities expands wider and wider.\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nChapter 1: Into the Time Stream!\n\nof time as the universe knows it. This is particularly the case for seemingly timeless mystic dimensions: heavens, hells, limbos, and the like. They might lie in a “direction” above, below, or beyond the omniverse of space-time. Can heroes (or villains) use the same time travel method they use on Earth to leap into the past of Heaven, for example, or are the physical laws of such a world too alien to allow that kind of travel?\n\nFAMILIAR FACES Despite the sheer vastness of the omniverse, time travelers have a tendency to intersect with the same people— or versions of the same people—in different time periods and timelines. Versions of a hero’s supporting cast show up in alternate timelines, even ones where they are cartoon dinosaurs rather than people. Time travelers run into their own ancestors or descendants, or those of people they know, who tend to bear a remarkable resemblance and inexplicably carry the same grudges. There may be some kind of unseen quantum connection between people causing this “attraction” across space and time, but most often it’s just an odd coincidence. This trope is one way of including supporting cast and Relationship complications in a time travel series. It might not always be the same Relationship, but so long as the character keeps running into familiar faces with a sense of connection, it’s possible for the complication to come into play.\n\nPARADOXES Time travel leads to all kinds of potential logical paradoxes, situations that seem impossible from the perspective of linear time and our notion of cause-and-effect. Sometimes paradoxes resolve themselves, although in ways that raise other questions about the nature of free will (such as the predestination paradox) while other paradoxes cannot logically be solved, but some time travel stories simply jump right over them in different ways. You should consider how to resolve paradoxes when they come up. Does a paradox spin off a separate timeline? Does the omniverse create powerful time entities that attack and undo the paradox like a quantum immune system? Does an order of temporal law enforcement or a secret society of time wizards monitor the time-stream and resolve paradoxes? Does the time-stream itself rip the paradox from time and contain it (and any time travelers stuck in that moment) like a cyst?\n\nBILOCATION PARADOX In time travel stories, there is often a prohibition of some sort involving the bilocation paradox: Someone or something existing in two different places simultaneously. Most often, this says that a time traveler cannot meet or interact with themselves. In some cases, this paradox goes so far that a time traveler cannot even visit a time period in which they already exist, or that they can only do so as an immaterial ghost, unable to interact and only observe.\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nThere may also be an element of danger to bilocation: A situation where the different “quantum charges” (or other technobabble or mystical rules) of two versions of the same person or object can cause catastrophe if they come into contact. In other stories, there is no bilocation paradox, and time travelers can interact with themselves at different points along their own timeline, subject only to the various other paradoxes that can create.\n\nCAUSALITY LOOP PARADOX In a causality loop paradox, the results of an effect or action become its own cause, resulting in a closed loop. A classic example is a scientist discovers an old notebook with formulae and sketches leading to a breakthrough in the development of a time machine. That scientist later loses the notebook on a trip into the past, where it ends up in the place where they will discover it in the future, inventing time travel and creating the circumstances where the notebook will be lost, and then found, again and again. In this loop, no event created the notebook and nothing ever destroys it., so where did the notebook come from in the first place?\n\n9\n\nMUTANTS & MASTERMINDS\n\nEXAMPLE: PERSONAL VS. UNIVERSAL TIMELINES This book uses the word timeline to describe both the direction of an entire universe and of individuals. The universal timeline includes everyone and everything that ever existed along that course of events, while a personal timeline follows one individual from birth to death. Usually the two run seamlessly together, but once time travel enters the equation, things get complicated. Imagine if the heroine Backstep travels back 30 years to meet her own mother while her mother is still a teenager. Backstep has already met her mother—in her own personal timeline, this isn’t their first meeting. But her mother has never met her. From her mother’s perspective and the perspective of the universal timeline, this is their first meeting. If Backstep takes the teen version of her mom back to pirate times for a quick adventure, she’s making a major impact on her personal timeline AND her mother’s personal timeline, but probably only a minor impact on the universal timeline (especially if they only fight other time travelers). In general, whenever this book talks about “the timeline,” it refers to the universal timeline. When it talks about personal timelines, it says so, or talks about a character’s timeline using their name. It may be important to differentiate between the two to keep track of how much time-traveling NPCs know about the heroes and each other, but you can handwave the difference if it becomes too big a headache, especially after the “first” meeting between the heroes and the NPC.\n\nFERMI PARADOX The original Fermi paradox concerned the existence of alien life in the universe, stating that if intelligent life exists beyond Earth, it should be common enough among the trillions of stars that we’d have heard something from extraterrestrials by now. The temporal version of it asks, “If time travel is possible, then where are all the time travelers?” Wouldn’t every important moment in history be crowded with travelers trying to alter it, protect it, or just visit? Perhaps they are, and we just don’t know it somehow. If temporal enforcement agencies are effective, they may be preventing such interventions from changing history, at least enough so their traces are nothing more than odd coincidences and conspiracy theories. The bilocation paradox, or some other limit of the time-stream, may keep travelers from visiting the same moment repeatedly, and fixed points in time (following) make visiting certain events for anything other than covert observation pointless.\n\nGRANDPARENT PARADOX If a causality loop is an event becoming its own cause, then the grandparent paradox is when an event prevents its own cause. The classic example is: You travel into the past and accidentally cause the death one of your grandparents. Now you will never be born in the future! Which means that you couldn’t travel back in time to kill your\n\n10\n\ngrandparent. Which means they’re still alive, still raise your parent, who in turn raises you, which means you do go back in time to kill your grandparent! Of course, that raises the question: Who or what then caused the death of your grandparent? In some cases, the grandparent paradox does result in an event eliminating its cause: Kill your grandparent, and you disappear from reality, as if you never were. In other cases, the paradox changes the timeline, but the agent of change remains unaffected because it needs to have caused the change. In the classic example, this means that you kill your grandparent and continue to exist, even though you were never born and all evidence of your existence is erased from your timeline.\n\nPREDESTINATION PARADOX If the entire timeline already exists (in the greater sense of the omniverse) then any events on that timeline have “already” happened from a certain perspective. This can mean that any involvement in what a time traveler considers history is already a part of their personal past and therefore part of the “proper” flow of history. Presdestination paradoxes are a kind of causality loop (mentioned previously) that says a particular temporal intervention was “meant” to happen due to it already being a part of the fabric of the omniverse. Predestination paradoxes are sometimes used to justify time travel, especially if travelers find proof of a trip into the past before they depart. An easy out for the predestination paradox is to rule that time travel insulates a character from temporal effects, including anything that \"should\" happen after their first trip.\n\nPERSONAL TIMELINES One of the elements of time travel stories is that it is possible for events to happen out of sequence from the point of view of a character’s personal timeline. For example, a hero might meet a time traveler for the first time from the hero's own perspective, but the time traveler may have already met the hero in the future. The time traveler considers the hero—who is only meeting them now—an old and dear friend and treats them with trust and familiarity. Characters can run into the results and consequences of actions they have not yet taken from their, or have their “first” encounter with a foe after having already fought them multiple times, because their opponent has been traveling back in time to attack the heroes earlier and earlier. When time travel becomes a plot element, it is important to think about the past, present, and future in personal terms rather than universal experiences, because a time-traveling hero’s present may be the past relative to the era they grew up in and may be the past or future to other time travelers they encounter. Personal timelines that run out of sequence with the universal timeline greatly extends opportunities for scene edits (see Edit Scene under Hero Points in Chapter 1 of the Deluxe Hero’s Handbook). The Time Travel Rules Options section discusses this in more detail.\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nChapter 1: Into the Time Stream!\n\nPROPER HISTORY A major trope of time travel stories is that history has a “proper” or “correct” course and that interfering with, or altering, this has potentially serious consequences. The main reason for the proper history trope is to provide dramatic tension in a time travel story: the protagonists must either prevent changes to history or set things right after someone else changes things. It also offers a reason for time travelers to opt out of going around fixing all the terrible and tragic events of the past: they can’t if history must follow its proper course. Exactly who or what decides what is “proper” for any given history depends on the setting. In some cases, each timeline has a particular “shape” or “course,” with changes creating artificial dams and levies that change that shape. Efforts to bend the timeline out of shape creates tension, like water pressing against the dam or eroding the levies. That tension can result in “time-quakes” or other phenomena against whatever is exerting pressure on the timeline as existing forces try to compensate for the changes. The bigger the changes, the worse the tension; when the “dam” bursts, everything downstream risks being swept away as time rushes to resume its original course. In other settings, a temporal enforcement agency decides what constitutes “proper” history for the timeline—usually their own history, or the history that leads to the agency’s existence. Some time agencies protect a particular historical sequence ordained by higher powers without really knowing why it is or is not proper. This can lead to rebellious time agents, frustrated at maintaining history’s atrocities for a “higher good” that is never explained.\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nFIXED POINTS A common middle ground between “proper history” and a changeable timeline is the notion of “fixed points” in a timeline. Instead of the whole timeline having a proper shape or course, there are various fixed or anchor points along the timeline that are vital and cannot be changed without huge repercussions. These points exhibit a greater resistance to change, up to or including being impossible to change under normal circumstances. In some timelines, fixed points can be thought of as temporal “fire breaks”—changes in the rest of the timeline tend to run up against a fixed point and then stop, or at least lessen and even out, preventing smaller changes in the timeline from creating complex, long-term effects. Of course, it’s still possible for a change to pull part of a timeline between two fixed points so far out of shape that the tension seriously threatens the integrity of the whole. Fixed points offer a reason why temporal enforcement agencies don’t have to guard every moment throughout history, and why even the most well-intentioned time travelers cannot change certain events.\n\nSPOILERS If travel into the future is possible, then time travelers can have foreknowledge of everything that will happen to them, their loved ones, and anything else they hold dear. The same is true of travelers from the future visiting the past. If time travelers encounter one another out of sequence in their personal timelines (mentioned previously) the traveler who is “further ahead” may have knowledge of what is going to happen to those who are subjectively\n\n11\n\nMUTANTS & MASTERMINDS “behind” them. Sometimes this foreknowledge is the basis for trying to change the timeline in some way: Like going back to warn someone of a tragedy in their future before it happens. In other cases, travelers have to carefully avoid “spoilers” to keep from changing the timeline. Some stories prevent travelers from learning too much about their own histories the same way they manage paradoxes, while others keep secrets by seeding future history with dark ages and media blackouts that wipe out broad swathes of knowledge. Just as present-day humans can’t know all the life details of any given Roman citizen, neither can a traveler to the future simply look up every major event about themselves or their descendants. Modern historians still argue over the causes of major historical events, and so trying to learn what present-day effects cause future consequences—and how—is likewise fraught, even looking back from a far-future perspective.\n\nTEMPORAL ENFORCEMENT Time travel stories often feature some sort of agency that enforces restrictions on time travel and stops interference with timelines, either using a cosmic force, a literal agency of “time cops,” or both.\n\nusually devoted to the “proper” course of history and the flow of the time-stream (see Proper History, previously). Temporal enforcement agents may be literal employees of an organization devoted preventing interference in the timeline. These may be human agents from the future (or the distant past) with time travel capabilities, or possibly superhumans whose powers let them bridge the timestream. Given a time agency’s capabilities, agents are often equipped with incredibly advanced future technology, sufficient to allow them to take on super-powered opponents. A time agency might protect a single timeline (usually safeguarding their own history) or multiple timelines. They might even be responsible for the whole of the omniverse, which is a vast job, but how often they’re needed depends on how common time travelers are. Natural and organized temporal enforcement may cross over. Some time agencies are created or sustained by naturally-occurring cosmic entities, such as the cosmic Time Keepers of Earth-Prime appointing various Guardians to watch over history. The natural or cosmic forces tend to be concerned with the “big picture” while the individual agents carry out their vision to eliminate disruptions and minimize the harm corrections can cause to people’s lives.\n\nNatural temporal enforcement may be highly impersonal, such as a tendency for timelines to “resist” tampering, where circumstances seem to conspire against the wouldbe change agent: On their way to a historical intervention characters get into an accident, are waylaid by bandits, encounter unexpected weather, lose a vital piece of equipment, and so forth. Natural enforcement might also take the form of a type of “temporal sickness” for anyone interfering in a timeline, becoming progressively worse the more the character tries to effect change (see Time Travel Options, following).\n\nNote that temporal enforcement agencies are not necessarily good or moral. Some ruthlessly enforce their particular notion of “proper history” and are willing to overlook, or even cause, terrible suffering to preserve it. A time agency may be devoted to safeguarding an immoral civilization from attack, such as preventing their “Thousand Year Reich” from being undermined in the past. This is particularly true for civilizations that have altered their own timeline and want to prevent anyone else from doing the same. Even good time agencies must contend with the ugliness of human history and preserving it to maintain the future that eventually comes of it.\n\nOther natural enforcement agents may be more personal. This includes beings that directly intervene to stop time travelers, acting like “chronal anti-bodies” to attack infections in the timeline. There might be “time ghosts” or “chronal hunters” who appear whenever a time traveler enters a foreign time period, or only when a traveler intervenes to change things. They might be intelligent and capable of negotiating, or relentless, single-minded predators that exist to devour the cause of the change. While other chronal agents are vastly powerful cosmic beings,\n\nOf course, nothing says there’s only one form of temporal enforcement. One agency’s “protection” of a timeline can be another’s “interference” and multiple temporal agencies can engage in a chronal conflict over the control of history, each trying to influence events towards their own desired outcomes while undoing or preventing the work of their rivals. Heroes may encounter time travelers claiming to have history’s “best interests” at heart, only to discover the travelers’ notion of “proper” history differs quite a bit from the heroes’ own.\n\nTIME TRAVEL RULES OPTIONS The following rules options may be useful for those looking to model and include certain temporal phenomena in their Mutants & Masterminds games.\n\nTEMPORAL NAVIGATION Moving from one point to another in a timeline, much less to different timelines in the omniverse, may involve some incredibly complex, multidimensional math and navigational plotting. The GM may want to consider a\n\n12\n\nversion of the Check Required flaw for certain Movement (Time Travel) effects. Consider making the check DC 15 (or higher, if you want time travel to be a difficult and risky option) to make it sufficiently difficult, rather than basing it solely on the rank of the effect, since Time Travel to a specific point in time is only rank 1. This way, a character needs a +5 bonus in Expertise: Temporal Mechanics to take 10 on the check. Most vehicles with Time Travel also have an onboard computer capable of doing the necessary calculations, essentially having a +5 bonus and the\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nability to take 10, either normally or through Skill Mastery. In these cases, characters only need to make a temporal navigation check when there’s something wrong with the computer or damage throws the vehicle off course. Gamemasters can also require temporal navigation skill challenges, especially during dramatic situations, where characters need to come up with enough Degrees of Success on a series of Expertise: Temporal Mechanics checks before accumulating too many Degrees of Failure to make a successful temporal jump. The complications of time travel and temporal navigation should also affect attempts to access the Movement (Time Travel) power by way of the Inventor or Ritualist Advantages. With a single rank of Movement to reach a specific destination, inventing a time machine normally requires only a DC 12 Technology check and ten hours for design and construction. A magic time-jump ritual requires even less time. If you want time travel to be easily accessible in your campaign, these rules are fine, but if you want to maintain control over access to time travel, then either increase these skill DCs by +5 to +10 or simply disallow this use of their respective Advantages in your campaign.\n\nTEMPORAL DRIFT By default, a failed temporal navigation check simply means the traveler does not successfully make the time jump and remains where they started. Alternately, the GM may decide a failed check means the traveler “drifts” some distance in time off target. The GM can choose an amount of temporal drift or base it on the amount by which the check failed. For example, temporal drift could be a percentage of the intended time traveled equal to the amount the check failed squared: so just 1% off for a failure by 1, but 25% off for a failure by 5 and a substantial 225% for a failure\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nChapter 1: Into the Time Stream!\n\nby 15! For a short “hop” of only a week, that’s a drift of just over an hour and a half for failure by 1, nearly two days for failure by 5, and over two weeks off target for a failure by 15! Travel distances of years or centuries can result in considerably more drift. The arrival is either before (a 1–10 roll) or after (an 11–20 roll) the intended time.\n\nTEMPORAL MISHAPS A failed temporal navigation check or other phenomenon could result in a temporal mishap. This is a complication related to time travel introduced by the GM. You can use this in place of temporal drift, in which case the complication doesn’t come with a Hero Point award (the mishap is simply the result of a failed check) or it can be in addition to temporal drift or introduced as a regular plot complication, in which case you should award players a Hero Point for it. Some possible temporal mishaps include: • Accident: The mishap damages something—most likely the time vehicle if there is one—or causes some accident in a moment of the timeline the travelers must clean up to prevent drastic changes to history. • Disability: The mishap causes a temporary disability such as blindness or deafness or imposes some other temporary Condition. • Enemy: The mishap attracts the attention of temporal enforcers or chronozoids. • Identity: The mishap can involve paradoxes like bilocation or the traveler encountering parallel versions of themselves, amnesia, or the loss of personal history. • Power Loss: Exposure to chronal energy or minor changes to the timeline could interfere with travelers’ powers, devices, or technology. • Weakness: The mishap causes the travelers to suffer from an unusual weakness for a time.\n\n13\n\nMUTANTS & MASTERMINDS\n\nHERO POINTS AND RETCONS\n\nCAUSALITY CHANGES\n\nTemporal manipulations allow for an additional option when spending Hero Points: using the Edit Scene ability to “retcon” changes in history! So long as the player can come up with a time travel scenario that explains it, they can spend a Hero Point to edit the scene to make almost anything happen. For example, heroes might find themselves trapped and without their devices; a player suggests their hero will, at some point in the future, come back into the past and leave an extra set of equipment behind a false panel in that very room! The GM approves, the player spends the Hero Point, and voila! The heroes open the panel to find exactly the gear they need.\n\nChange to a timeline’s past can transform characters, from altering their personal histories to turning them into entirely alternate versions of themselves. This transformation is typically a Progressive Affliction 1, +1 for every successfully resisted check, resisted by Willpower. Characters suffer the Impaired and Disabled conditions initially, due to disorientation, then finally Transformed into the new version of themselves. The time increment is once per round for most characters, or once per hour for a creature that has traveled through time recently. The transformations inflicted by causality changes generally affect a character’s mind and personality, but may also result in things like scars or medical conditions, or the presence or absence of superpowers.\n\nIn addition to the normal limit imposed by the number of Hero Points they have to spend, the GM may wish to impose temporal consequences for using this option too frequently. Characters may start to develop time sickness (following) with the DC of the resistance check based on 20 + the number of Hero Points spent retconning that game session (or over a certain number that session).\n\nTEMPORAL TRANSFORMATIONS The effects of time travel, or interfering with history, can cause temporal transformations, weakening characters, erasing them from history altogether, or changing their bodies and minds in a variety of different ways. Such transformations are typically Progressive Afflictions, with a resistance check each day, although intense or immediate transformations could require a check every hour or even each round. See Chapter 3 for more on these and other temporal hazards.\n\nTIME SICKNESS Excess exposure to chronal energy—especially from too much time travel in a relatively brief period or unshielded exposure to the time-stream—can damage the body’s systems and leave a character ill. The Affliction is resisted by Fortitude with a DC of 10 + the intensity rank of the chronal energy. The degrees of effect are usually Impaired, Disabled, Paralyzed, and Dying. Ordinary medical treatment has little effect on time sickness: It can provide a bonus to the Fortitude check but cannot cure the condition. Time sickness can instead produce bizarre evolutionary changes, resulting in the Transformed result rather than Paralyzed.\n\nERASURES The most extreme of temporal transformation erases the victim from existence! This is usually resisted by Willpower. The degrees are Dazed, Stunned, Incapacitated, and Dying, except rather than dying they simply vanish altogether. Some instances of erasure have no effect on the victim other than stunning them for a round when the condition’s degree worsens, at least until they disappear entirely. An erasure can only be “cured” by undoing the circumstance that caused it, although some time-stabilizing technology can halt its progress temporarily.\n\nCHRONAL ENERGY HAZARD RANKS Time travelers may risk exposure to chronal energy from a variety of sources. Exposure to chronal energy generally results in time sickness but may instead result in damage or teleporting a character to a random place or time instead.

Some of it is still taking place. Mutants & Masterminds is, by and large, a lighthearted game about helping others. Understably, not everyone wants their game time to involve depictions of genocide, reminders of real-world oppression, or hearing old-timey slurs.\n\n14\n\nDon't assume history has been a straight line of progress, beginning with more racism, hatred, and degradation that is slowly removed until a perfect modern day exists. Many modern pop-culture depictions of history simply assume the past was worse than the present and lump in vile treatment for women and racial, sexual, and gender minorities as \"historical accuracy.\" Some of the ugliness of the present day—especially racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia—are either absent or radically different\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nChapter 1: Into the Time Stream!\n\nin other time periods. Racism as it exists now in the United States, for example, is largely an outgrowth of chattel slavery and the 19th-century eugenics movement—previously, slavery existed largely as a punishment for captives taken in war, debtors, and criminals rather than a sentence imposed on a race. Even during the horrors of American chattel slavery, free black people existed, traveled, owned property, held political office, and created art all across the world, including the Americas and Europe. How do you deal with the complex and sometimes ugly elements of history in a time travel story while keeping the campaign fun for everyone? There’s no one right answer when dealing with sensitive topics, only answers that are right for your group. If a player does express concern about a particular theme or historical element, then that element should be considered off-limits. Either exclude it from your adventure or change the adventure. Even if it means reworking or scrapping a time travel scenario, no storyline is worth making a player feel uncomfortable or unwelcome or forcing them to re-live a trauma at your game table. Similarly, everyone should respect any boundaries players express (and remember: you the Gamemaster are a player as well, and deserve to have your boundaries respected). Keep a mutually agreed-upon safety mechanism (see sidebar) in place and be patient handling any unexpected difficult situations that might arise during play. Consider the following options and talking with your group before bringing in any historical unpleasantness.\n\nDEFY Discuss your players’ limits and interests regarding their ideal time-travel scenarios, and you might find that some players like the idea of having the power to confront the ugly things they or people like them have dealt with. For them, the real fun might be visiting history’s greatest monsters and punching them in the jaw. You may need to explain how history is affected if a superhero, for example, kills Hitler, but letting a player do so—especially as the climax of a large adventure, can feel empowering. Transgender players, for example, might get some personal sense of control saving a library of early research from destruction by a fascist regime. This approach doesn’t work for all players, however, and plenty of people prefer to use the game table as a temporary break from the complex realities they live with, so vet plot elements like this with your players before going forward, or simply wait and see if they suggest them. Often, this approach works better with fictional analogues to real-world events.\n\nDISCUSS If there’s no avoiding the ugly parts of history, or if the players don’t feel right about downplaying them, make sure to discuss things clearly and openly at your game table. Talk about the bad stuff, and ask your players what they are comfortable and uncomfortable with including. Focus particularly on things you think will affect the characters, and ask the players about things that might par-\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nSAFETY MECHANISMS When engaging with difficult subject matter or situations, a roleplaying game group may want to have a safety mechanism at the table. A popular example is the X-Card by John Stavropoulos (detailed online at tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg), an index card with an “X” drawn on it is placed on the table. At any time, any player can touch or hold up the X-Card to edit out or skip over uncomfortable content, no questions asked, or to ask for a break in the game to deal with or discuss it. Similar safety mechanisms like a “time out” signal, a two-sided green/red card (green side up means “keep going,” red side up means “stop or skip over this”) or another way for players to indicate they are uncomfortable or have an issue, can help everyone feel safe and respected at the table. These mechanisms only work if they are absolutely honored, and everyone is allowed to use them without having to explain or justify themselves. Remember, Mutants & Masterminds is just a game, and that makes it far less important than everyone’s wellbeing and comfort.\n\nticularly affect them. As Gamemaster, encourage any of the players to get in touch with you privately to express any concerns they might have that they’d rather not share with the group, and always keep private concerns private.\n\nDOWNPLAY Comic books tend to romanticize history and historical figures and you can do the same in your game. Simply omit the unpleasant parts of the past you don't want to invest energy in—visit a wild west without focusing on the racism against Native Americans (and hispanics, and African Americans), or rock-and-roll in the 1950s without dwelling on oppressive gender roles and repression of queer Americans. Just make it clear that’s what you’re doing for the sake of everyone’s fun and comfort. You can simply ignore, or at least downplay, the ugly parts of history, so long as everyone is okay with it (and, even then, see Safety Mechanisms in the sidebar). You can also plan your adventures to deliberately avoid some of the worst elements of the past, setting adventures in places and times that weren’t as hostile. Including historical exceptions to the status quo, like black cowboy Bass Reeves or female pilot Amelia Earhart, further helps balance the depressing parts of history.\n\nUSE WITH CAUTION If all of the members of the game group (and that includes the GM) agree they are okay with tackling some of the ugliness of history as part of a time travel story, do so with caution, and be aware that the reality at the game table may prove more different than it did in theory. Use safety mechanisms to manage the experience at the table and allow players the opportunity to change their minds or opt out if a story element becomes uncomfortable. Engage with the material respectfully and do research to try to do it justice in the context of your game.\n\n15\n\nMUTANTS & MASTERMINDS\n\nChapter 2: Time Traveling Heroes\n\nH\n\neroes’ interactions with time travel tend to fall into two categories: occasional time travel and serial time travel, with different expectations and demands for each. Most of the material in this chapter is written for serial time travelers, who will get the most out of the character options presented. As always, the Gamemaster decides which options are available to characters in a series and whether they are available at character creation or only through experience and character improvement.\n\nOCCASIONAL TIME TRAVEL Occasional time travel is when heroes in a Mutants & Masterminds series experience a time travel story every once in a while, but otherwise protect their city/nation/planet in the modern day. The series focuses elsewhere—most likely on conventional superhero stories, but occasionally a story comes up where the heroes travel in time. For most superheroes and teams, if time travel exists in the setting, sooner or later, there will be a time travel story. Often, it involves accidental time travel, but it may be intentional, especially if the heroes have access to a method of time travel—or are given access by a non-player character (see Who Controls the Time Machine? in Chapter 3 for more on this). Even if the heroes have a time machine, their time travel adventures could be limited due to the requirements of time travel or simply their own caution about interfering too much with the timeline.\n\n16\n\nFor the most part, occasional time travel stories involve heroes who aren’t specifically designed for it, although an intentional time travel adventure may allow heroes to prepare for the trip, acquiring or building specialty equipment and other short-term preparations (see Time Travel Devices and Equipment later in this chapter). Otherwise, time travel is just one of the many adventure hooks and plot devices in the series, not all that different from the heroes traveling to distant places on Earth, to other planets in space, or to other dimensions.\n\nSERIAL TIME TRAVEL Serial time travel means the series focuses largely on traveling through time or to alternate timelines, and the heroes are expected to travel, visiting new time periods and timelines in most adventures. That means the characters should generally either be designed as time travelers, or at least have the opportunity to grow into a group of regular time travelers by spending earned power points. They may be chosen or recruited for their suitability as travelers, or simply adapt to their circumstances with experience. Of course, serial time travel does not necessarily mean voluntary or intentional time travel. Characters in a serial time travel game might be “unstuck in time” in some fashion, jumping from point to point along a timeline or\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nChapter 2: Time Traveling Heroes\n\neven across multiple timelines. Their destinations could be random or directed by some outside agency, such as a cosmic entity, mysterious device, or temporal enforcement organization. The characters might have a time machine, but face mechanical malfunctions or not know how to operate it properly, meaning their jumps largely involve mashing buttons and hoping for the best.\n\nTIME TRAVEL BASES AND SETTINGS A serial time travel series also has a different relationship with what can be considered the team’s “home base” and supporting cast of characters. Time travelers who jump from point to point, or even one timeline to another, aren’t likely to carry a lot of non-player characters with them. The only exceptions are if the characters have a time ship with a larger crew (see Time Travel Devices and Equipment later in this chapter) or if the GM makes use of the Familiar Faces trope from Chapter 1, with different versions of people important to the characters “just happening” to cross their paths in different eras. Serial time travelers might have a home base of some kind, such as a mobile time ship that serves as a kind of “home away from home.” They might also have a fixed installation in a particular era, or located out in the time-stream, that they return to periodically, particularly if it is the “launch point” for their method of time travel. Depending on the nature of the base, the heroes might have additional supporting cast. Even an isolated base could house fellow agents and support staff. If time travel is easy enough, some supporting cast characters might “pop” back and forth to visit the heroes.\n\nTIME TRAVEL COMPLICATIONS Time travelers who spend most of their existence wandering the omniverse may also have different kinds of complications compared to heroes who live in one set place and time. Unless the characters have an equally mobile supporting cast or a “friend in every era,” their Relationship complications will tend to focus around fellow time travelers or people back home who the character visits. Juggling the need to drop in at just the right time for a scheduled visit can be a complication, and a potential weakness if an enemy finds out where and when to expect the character to show up. As the Ugly History section in Chapter 1 details, there are plenty of complications characters may face in the past, provided the players are willing to deal with them in the context of the game. Consider carefully the inclusion of historic social Prejudice complications in your game and look over that section for things to take into account. While traditional social complications might not come into play in a time travsel game, characters must often deal with Identity complications, particularly cases of mistaken identity—and the other social complications that come with it. They may also be mistaken for specific historical figures, alternate versions of themselves, or their own ancestors. Most time travelers share a Secret complication (that they’re time travelers!) and Power Loss is a common element of time travel stories. Either the time travel process causes something to happen to the heroes’ powers, or something goes wrong with their mode of time travel, stranding them in an era and forcing them to jury-rig a solution in order to leave.\n\nSUGGESTED POWER LEVELS The power level of a Mutants & Masterminds time travel series can have a big effect on the overall tone of the series and the types of characters the players create. The following are some suggested power level ranges and the types of series they support.\n\nCHRONONAUTS\n\nPL 7–8\n\nLower-PL heroes can adventure through time as easily as godlike wizards and mega-geniuses, but often need outside support. A Chrononauts series tends to involve “time agent” level heroes. Characters often have few, if any, powers and those powers they do have tend to be highly focused or involve skill or talent descriptors (see Talent Powers in Power Profiles for examples) or special devices or equipment. Instead, chrononauts tend to have a lot of skills, Advantages, and gear to cover all the situations that might crop up during their missions. If they work for a temporal agency of some sort, the characters may be assembled specifically as a team, with diverse abilities to complement each other. Otherwise, their teamwork—like their time travel—is largely happenstance and whatever the heroes themselves manage to pull together.\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nChrononauts most often depend on an outside agency for their time travel capabilities. They could be accidental time travelers but are more likely operatives of an agency that gives them their assignments and sends them to the correct point(s) in the omniverse to carry them out. Characters may have some limited ability to time travel on their own, but the standard approach is one jump to their mission point and another jump back to home base, wherever (and whenever) that may be. Apart from visiting other points in time, the heroes’ assignments are much like regular action-adventure stories: overcoming challenges and foes using skill, teamwork, and daring. Chrononauts are sometimes opposed by a similar agency or organization with different designs upon the timeline (or even the whole omniverse), creating a “temporal war” between two or more factions fighting to change or preserve history—or both sides may be fighting to “preserve” the history that creates their own timeline. In more peaceful circumstances, chrononauts may also be explorers and scholars, documenting and answering numerous questions about history. They’re also the people charged with keeping those expert researchers safe from all the hazards\n\n17\n\nMUTANTS & MASTERMINDS they might encounter in the timeline, ensuring they get home safely, don’t muck up the timeline in the process, and inevitably fix everything when their charges do muck everything up.\n\nHISTORY’S FINEST A trope that shows up in a Chrononauts-level series is playing various famous figures from history. These characters are usually “borrowed” from a particular point in their lives with the intention of returning them, or recruited after a mysterious disappearance or death in their own lifetimes. They could also be recruited from parallel timelines so their presence or disappearance doesn’t affect the history that we know. The players could create a team made up of (for example) Queen Boudica of the\n\nCelts, Ptolemy, Amelia Earhart, Alexander the Great, and Mata Hari to protect the timeline from interference by outside forces. Such a series offers great opportunities for research into interesting historical figures and learning about them “first hand” by portraying them. In some settings, the History’s Finest concept might extend to “Fiction’s Finest,” with some or all of the characters being famous historical figures from fiction, such as d’Artagnan, the Scarlet Pimpernel, Jane Eyre, Doctor Frankenstein, and others. The usual assumption is that there are some timelines in the omniverse where these characters are real people. Whether the timelines are creations of the authors of those fictional works, or whether they inspired those authors in other timelines is usually left a mystery. Other campaigns may rely on fictional characters to protect the timeline, as their artificial histories can’t be affected by changes made to the past.\n\nOUTSIDE TIME\n\nPL 9–11\n\nAt these power levels, characters tend to be less agents and more “time traveling superheroes.” As the default power level for Mutants & Masterminds, it’s the most common for occasional or accidental time travelers, as well as heroes who are regular travelers through the omniverse. The Outside Time heroes tend to be as diverse as any group of superheroes, but make use of the guidelines given in the Character Options section of this chapter, particularly if they are serial time travelers deliberately assembled as a team. These heroes usually have their own shared means of time travel, whether it is a time ship that serves as both their transportation and headquarters, or team time suits or talismans the provide the Movement (Time Travel) effect. Often, the team has to time travel together, if only to avoid dealing with the potential headaches that occur when each individual character can time travel on their own. They may work for or answer to a higher authority— whether a time agency or a cosmic super-being—but often operate on their own. Sometimes there is a particular reason why the characters have become time travelers, such as being initially unimportant enough in their own time periods that they won’t be missed if taken out of time, never to return. It may be a predestination paradox (see Chapter 1) where all the heroes are “meant” to go missing because history records them all as such. An extreme example is a team made up of the sole survivors of lost or destroyed timelines, either looking to restore their homes or ensure that no other universe suffers their fate. The opposition in an Outside Time series tends to be made up of teams of supervillains similar in power level to the heroes, or singular master villains who are 2–4 power levels higher than the heroes. Usually, they are timemeddlers or otherwise tampering with history and forces they should not be, and the heroes need to stop them. The heroes may also encounter natural disasters that span entire timelines or parts of the omniverse, requiring them to shore up or protect key parts of a timeline to keep the whole of history intact.\n\n18\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nChapter 2: Time Traveling Heroes\n\nPARALLELS Characters in a Champions Outside Time level series are often familiar heroes, but not quite the ones you might expect, in that they are alternate or variant versions of known heroes recruited from other timelines. This essentially takes the notion of History’s Finest (previously) and applies it to known superheroes—or even supervillains, if the team recruits a heroic version of a known villain from another timeline. It’s essentially a player character version of the Familiar Faces trope from Chapter 1, and part of the reason why that trope comes into play, since the parallel must often deal with stepping into the lives of their own alternate selves in other timelines. A rarer version of the Parallels trope is for all the members of the team to be different versions of the same person across many timelines, some of them quite divergent. Similarly, the antagonists in a Champions Outside Time series might be parallel timeline versions of the player characters who have their own agenda, or work for the opposition.\n\nheroes” team, but on an omniversal scale. They may be drawn together and united by a higher power or outside force, but can just as easily be self-appointed guardians, either having discovered the greater omniverse, or having come together to deal with any threat(s) to it. They could be literally immortal, exist outside of time, or be part of a legacy of passing their membership and responsibilities on to successors, which can include recruiting new player characters into the team. The Guardians of Time may also be the creators or source for time travel in their timeline, and so wandering history to correct the abuses of their creation falls to them. The threats faced by Guardians of Time tend to be similarly grandiose. They may deal with foes bent on ruling (or destroying) the entirety of the omniverse, protect whole timelines from invasion, alteration, or erasure, and similarly find ways of containing “toxic” or otherwise dangerous timelines from invading or infecting the rest of the omniverse. If threats from “outside of time” exist, the Guardians of Time are the first (and possibly only) line of defense against them.\n\nGUARDIANS OF TIME PL 12–14\n\nCOSMIC FORCES\n\nAt the high end, heroes in a Guardians of Time level series tend to be cosmically powerful and capable, dealing with threats to entire timelines or the whole of the omniverse. This is the power level where heroes are most likely to have their own individual methods of travel through time and across dimensions and might have some kind of omniversal headquarters or organization. Gamemasters should be prepared for Guardians of Time to exercise their abilities to go anywhere (and anywhen) based around however time travel works in the setting (see Chapter 3).\n\nThere’s considerable overlap between a Guardians of Time level series and a Cosmic Avatar level series from the Cosmic Handbook. Gamemasters may find much of the material in that book useful for a time travel series at this high a power level. In particular, the material on options for cosmic-level characters and the various archetypes can serve as resources. The Cosmic Handbook guidelines for Power Level X plot devices are also valuable in detailing vastly powerful chronal avatars, embodiments of entire timelines and concepts, and preternatural threats from outside the space-time continuum. The power level 15 Time Master villain archetype from Cosmic Handbook is a suitable foe for a Guardians of Time team on the power level 12 end of this tier.\n\nA Guardians of Time-style series often features player characters who are among the greatest heroes from their respective timelines, much like a “world’s greatest\n\nCHARACTER OPTIONS Time travel series can involve all kinds of characters, from potentially any time, or even any possible reality. When creating Mutants & Masterminds heroes specifically for a time travel series, there are a number of things to consider, and this section takes a look at them.\n\nREQUIRED TRAITS Gamemasters should decide if any particular traits are required for all characters in a time travel series and make players aware of them before they start creating characters. Players may be required to purchase a “package” of traits for their characters, or the required traits could be bonuses given to all characters without any power point cost. Common required traits include things that allow characters to overcome certain challenges, such as the language barrier (see Languages under Advantages) or\n\nThe Time Traveler's Codex\n\nranks of Immunity to ignore things like the prevalence of diseases in history. They may also include certain applications of the Benefit Advantage or ranks of Equipment to cover the costs of group equipment or vehicles. In some games, all characters might be required to have their own means of time travel, meaning one or more ranks of Movement (Time Travel). In others campaigns, individual time travel effects might be prohibited. Likewise, some series may require all characters to have Chronal Advantages (see Advantages, following), particularly Chronal Bulwark and Chronal Memory.\n\nSKILLS Many skills rely on the context of a particular time period or culture, and Gamemasters can apply a circumstance penalty (–2 or –5) for situations where the character is\n\n19\n\nMUTANTS & MASTERMINDS\n\nTECH FAMILIARITY Attempting to use, sabotage, or repair unfamiliar technology increases the skill DC. These DC increases represent a lack of experience with the technology, and should reduce by one step for every major scene a character spends working on or learning about the related technology, until no DC increase applies. Using weapons from vastly different technological eras may similarly impose a penalty on a character’s attack check equal to the DC increase, so a character from the early 21st century using a recoilless laser rifle (familiar) might suffer a –2 penalty on attack checks, but attempting to wield a psionic assault orb from the 45th century (alien) would suffer a –10 penalty. These examples assume a traveler from the modern day. DC Increase Circumstance +2\n\nFamiliar (forge an iron knife, repair a 19th-century steam engine; pilot a starship derived from earlier jet designs)\n\n+5\n\nTangential (knap a flint knife, hack a 22nd-century computer, steer a Roman galley)\n\n+10\n\nAlien (interface with technology attuned to thought patterns, use a lost historical crafting technique)\n\n—\n\nImpossible (technology more than a millennium more advanced, without context or guidance)\n\nEven “impossible” Technology checks may be possible if a player is willing to spend a Hero Point to edit the scene or receive a sudden burst of insight.\n\nusing their skills outside of that context. It is difficult to use interaction skills, for example, if you’re only passingly familiar with the language or local culture, and more difficult to use skills like Technology if you’re dealing with tech generations or even centuries ahead of your experience. The more dramatic and four-color your series, the less you need to concern yourself with these penalties, and they should lessen as a character spends more time in their new era and becomes increasingly familiar with its technology and culture.\n\nEXISTING SKILLS The skills that cause the most confusion in other eras are Technology and Vehicles, which rely heavily on modern technology. Treatment may also change, as different centuries have seen different levels of technology, pharmacology, and sanitation. Not having modern, familiar equipment to use with your modern skills is covered by the penalties for using substandard tools—imposing a –2 penalty on the skill check—or lacking tools altogether, which increases the circumstance penalty to –5. Attempting to repair modern technology with earlier tools (or repair advanced technology using modern tools) likewise imposes penalties for inadequate or no tools. The Gamemaster may determine if certain tasks are impossible— such as attempting to repair a smartphone with only flint\n\n20\n\nknives and fire—but the Improvised Tools Advantage should allow a character to still attempt these impossible tasks with a steep circumstance penalty.\n\nEXPERTISE Expertise: History really comes into its own in a time travel series. So much so, in fact, that the GM might want to subdivide the skill into more specific specialties. Historical Expertise might cover a particular period of time, a particular geographic region or culture, or some combination of both, such as Renaissance Europe, Colonial America, or Feudal Japan, to name a few. Characters can make Expertise checks on questions outside of their specific area of knowledge with a circumstance penalty, so long as the question is at least somewhat related. Time travelers can have Expertise in future periods of a timeline as well, so long as they are knowable. Skills like Expertise: Current Events and Pop Culture generally describe the popular culture of a character’s home era by default, but players can specify a different era if they like. This represents a closer understanding of a short time period’s culture and recent events, allowing a character to more easily pass for a native of that era, while narrow Expertise: History checks cover the time and culture’s broader, “big picture” elements.\n\nINVESTIGATION Time travel stories often involve piecing together clues to figure out a villain’s plan to influence or change history or the nature of some historic event, so Investigation can be a useful skill for at least one character in the group to have. An Investigation check can help determine when in the past an event took place, helping time travelers detect when a change was made to the timeline. Gathering information in an unfamiliar culture imposes a –2 circumstance penalty, while inability to understand the locals generally makes gathering information impossible.\n\nPERSUASION The Persuasion skill generally requires a language in common, but humans are empathic creatures and body language is often enough for especially charismatic heroes to communicate in broad strokes. If visiting a location or era where a hero doesn't speak the local language, they can use Persuasion to communicate basic ideas— \"help me,\" \"hungry,\" \"gift,\" \"my name is...\"—with a DC 20 Persuasion check. Any attempts to actually influence others without a language in common (or powers that compensate) suffer a –5 circumstance penalty, and may be impossible. be impossible.
