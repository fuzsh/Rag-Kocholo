Excerpt: Riot grrrl was an underground feminist punk movement based in Washington, DC, Olympia, Washington, Portland, Oregon, and the greater Pacific Northwest which existed in the early to mid-1990s, and it is often associated with third-wave feminism (it is sometimes seen as its starting point). Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, racism, and female empowerment. Some bands associated with the movement are Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Excuse 17, Heavens to Betsy, Fifth Column, Calamity Jane, Huggy Bear, Adickdid, Emily's Sassy Lime, The Frumpies, The Butchies, Sleater-Kinney, Bangs and also queercore like Team Dresch. In addition to a music scene and genre, riot grrrl is also a subculture; zines, the DIY ethic, art, political action, and activism are part of the movement. Riot grrrls are known to hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music. During the late 1970s and early and mid 1980s there were a number of female punk and rock musicians that later influenced the riot grrrl ethos. These included The Raincoats, Poly Styrene, LiLiPUT, The Slits, The Runaways, Patti Smith, Chrissie Hynde, Exene Cervenka, Siouxsie Sioux, Lydia Lunch, Kim Gordon, Neo Boys, Chalk Circle, Frightwig, Joan Jett, Anti-Scrunti Faction, Scrawl and Fifth Column. The 1980s also featured a number of female folk-singers from New York whose lyrics were realistic and socio-political, but also personally intimate. During the mid 1980s in Vancouver the influential Mecca Normal fronted by poet Jean Smith formed, followed by Sugar Baby Doll in San Francisco whose members would all be in riot grrrl acts. In 1987, the magazine Sassy premiered and dealt with tough subjects that conventional magazines aimed at teenage girls did not. An article Women, sex and rock and roll published by 'Puncture' in 1989 became the first manifesto of the movement.
