The first “Gold Record” was Glenn Miller’s 1942 release of “Chattanooga Choo Choo”. Elvis would be recognized by RCA for his 1956 smash hit of “Don’t Be Cruel”.\n\nRecording Industry Association of America (RIAA)\n\nThings changed in 1958, when the RIAA began recognizing both 45 and LP sales basing the program on dollars in sales vs. units sold. This significantly changed the landscape for future comparison. And the RIAA did not take into account an global sales – only U.S.\n\nThen the “Platinum” award came into being in 1976, reserved for singles or LP’s achieving one million units in sales. And “Gold” was redefined as “500,000” units sold – abandoning dollar accumulation.\n\nPerry Como’s “Catch a Falling Star” was certified as the first RIAA recognized “Gold” 45 and this was closely followed by the long play sound track “Oklahoma” as the first so-recognized long-play (no wonder there are so many of those LP’s crowding the old vinyl record bins).\n\nIronically, some recordings from the pre-RIAA days, were later recognized with these RIAA awards – sometimes decades later.\n\nThe Joseph Murrells’ Guide – “Million Selling Records from the 1900’s to the 1980’s\n\nI recently was provided a copy of a book called “Million Selling Records from the 1900’s to the 1980’s – An Illustrated Directory”.\n\nThe Very First Million Seller – The Great Caruso\n\nWhat I like about this publication is that it examines tracks (and long plays) for total global sales as the basis for recognizing “Million Sellers”. So because of the global aspect the book, many recordings suddenly find themselves in the company of the biggies such as Presley, the Beatles, Bing Crosby and more. A great feature of this guide is the research for million sellers going all the way back to what is reported as being the first million seller, 1903’s “Vesti La Giubba (On With the Motley)” by the great Enrico Caruso from Naples, Italy. Caruso was RCA’s first superstar, accruing over 3.5 million dollars in recording royalities during his lifetime.\n\nRuss Conway & Emile Ford\n\nAs an example of formerly neglected tracks not being presented in “million seller” listings, here we have shining examples such as British star Russ Conway’s 1959 hit “Side Saddle” which sold over one million copies mostly in the U.K. It charted number 1 in the U.K. for three weeks and had a 30-week best seller run there. The single failed to chart altogether in the U.S.\n\nAnother Brit – Emile Ford – backed by The Checkmates – achieved million unit status with “Why Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me?” tracks which topped the U.K. charts for six weeks. Has anyone in the U.S. ever heard of this record? It did not make a single dent on the Hot 100.\n\nWho Let the Dogs Out?\n\nAnd that brings us to the 1955 monster track “Jingle Bells” by those oh-so-annoying “Singing Dogs”. The track was the brain child of Don Charles from Denmark who recorded five puppies to achieve the final product.\n\nThere are some strange notations on this release. Murrells reports that “Jingle Bells” on RCA Victor Extended Play 6344 sold 500,000 copies in the U.S. That is probably true – but “Jingle Bells” did not chart in the U.S. Billboard lists “Oh! Susanna” one of the other three tracks – as the charting tune – topping off at number 22 in December of 1955. Seems a little suspicious.\n\nIn the U.K. “Jingle Bells”. Murrell reports that the track sold 450,000 copies in a single week in the U.K.! Combined global sales was well over one million.\n\nThe dogs weren’t through in the U.S. and “Jingle Bells” was not a lost cause – It would enter the Holiday charts on Billboard in 1971, 1972, 1973, 1983 and finally (thank God) in 1984.\n\nTo rub salt in the wound – the “Singing Dogs” actually had publicized names and a bit of promotion: They were “Pussy”, “Pearl”, “Dolly”, “King”, and “Caesar”.\n\nThe Early “Rockers” – One Million Units or More\n\nWhat I have compiled here is a listing of the earliest recordings to achieve global million unit selling status purporting tracks leaning strongly toward rock ‘n’ roll. You will see that most of the earliest were actually rhythm and blues. Sort of a fun exercise.\n\nHere are the forerunners – presented when possible – on 78 rpm format.\n\nFats Domino\n\n1948 – “The Fat Man” – His first of many million sellers – and cited by some as the first rock ‘n’ roll recording!\n\n1952 – “Goin’ Home”\n\n1953 – “Goin’ to the River” – “You Said You Loved Me” – “Please Don’t Leave Me” -“I Lived My Life”\n\n1954 – “Love Me” – “Don’t Leave Me This Way”\n\n1955 – “Thinking of You” – “Ain’t That a Shame” -“All By Myself” – “I Can’t Go On” – “Poor Me”\n\nJohn Lee Hooker\n\n1948 – “I’m in the Mood” & “Boogie Chillun”\n\nRoy Brown\n\n1949 – “Hard Luck Blues”\n\nIvory Joe Hunter\n\n1949 – “I Almost Lost My Mind”\n\nJoe Turner\n\n1951 – “Chains of Love”\n\n1953 – “Honey Hush”\n\n1955 – “Flip, Flop and Fly”\n\nRuth Brown\n\n1952 – “Five, Ten, Fifteen Hours”\n\n1953 – “Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean” (with the Rhythm-Makers)\n\nLloyd Price\n\n1952 – “Ladwy, Miss Clawdy”\n\nFaye Adams\n\n1953 – “Shake a Hand”\n\nThe Drifters\n\n1953 – “Money, Honey” (with Clyde McPhatter on lead vocal)\n\nThe Orioles\n\n1953 – “Crying in the Chapel”\n\nHank Ballard & The Midnighters\n\n1954 – “Work With Me Annie”\n\nThe Four Tunes\n\n1954 – “I Understand Just How You Feel”\n\nBill Haley & The Comets\n\n1954 – “Shake, Rattle & Roll” – “Rock Around the Clock” (This recording is said to have sold over 100 millions copies)\n\nThe Penguins\n\n1954 – “Earth Angel”\n\nChuck Berry\n\n1955 – “Maybellene”\n\nB.B King\n\n1955 – “Every Day (I Have the Blues)”\n\nLittle Richard\n\n1955 – “Tutti Frutti”\n\nThe Platters\n\n1955 – “Only You (And You Alone)”\n\nThe Charms\n\n1955 – “Hearts of Stone”\n\nAll This and Rock and Roll?…..\n\nWhat I know about the Colorado Punk scene could fill a thimble and so for this Post I rely on Bob Rob Medina’s book “Denvoid and The Cowtown Punks – A Collection of Strories from the 80’s Denver Punk Scene”. Get his book for the background stories behind these bands. Quote marks denote punk names. Some of these may be considered “New Wave”, “Hardcore” or “Gothic” – who knows? – To learn everything about the Colorado Punk scene go get a copy of Bob Rob Medina’s “Denvoid and the Cowtown Punks” published in 2015.\n\nWhat is really a treat (for me) in “Denvoid” are the many references and interviews relating to Wax Trax Records which sort of served a “ground zero” for the Punk crowd in Denver. There is a great interview with store co-owner Duane and quotes from his partner Dave Stidman. The fellow-traveler with Wax Trax back in the early days of Denver Punk was the nearby Mercury Café owned by Marilyn Megenity. The “venue” became a base of operations for the Punk artists and their followers, and in co-op with Wax Trax promoted Punk happenings.\n\nThe Café migrated over the years from location-to-location (often not by choice) but thrives today in it’s “LoDo” location at 2199 California Street.\n\nPunk – Hard Core or…..\n\n“Punk” popped up in the U.S. in 1974 or so according to WikipediaNew Wave is defined as emerging in the mid 1970’s and running through the mid 1980’s. But of course it had a much earlier foundation via garage bands. But it is comfortable to say that the with the arrival of the Ramones out of Queens in New York that Punk had arrived. “Hardcore” or “Hardcore Punk” is also attributed to a form overlapping with both early “Punk” and “New Wave”. The difference – What does it really matter?\n\nNow to mix things up even more, “Gothic Rock” or “Goth Rock” is attributed as a “Post Punk” genre, but is also documented as emerging in the late 1970’s. To top it all off – “Industrial Rock” popped up in the mid 1980’s but is not to be confused with “Industrial Metal”. And what about “Heavy Metal” and it’s predecessor “Death Metal”?\n\nThat’s enough of that…. So forgive and forget if some of these groups precede, transcend or supersede “Punk”.\n\nDenvoid and the Cowtown Punks by “Rob Bob Medina”\n\nClick on the image below to visit the “Denvoid” web site

The focus of the project initially was primarily the U.S. record charts, as produced by Billboard. Whitburn’s project has expanded over the years to an almost unimaginable collection of charts guides, which numbers over 200 publications with about 50 of those being currently in print and offered in his current catalog.\n\nI have no idea where Whitburn could possibly find the time, even with a team of researchers, to put together this massive amount of information. It seems he is always on the prowl to dig deeper into the charting of American music.\n\nAnd to top those efforts off – Whitburn is a world-class collector of vinyl – The following is from his web site:\n\n“Whitburn is an avid collector of phonograph records, with one of the world’s largest collections in his underground vault. His collection includes a copy of nearly every 78-rpm record, 45-rpm single, LP, and compact disc to reach the Billboard charts.”\n\nI have watched a video documentary about the Whitburn project, taking the viewer inside his vaults. You have to see it to believe it.\n\nFollowing is a basic breakdown of the history of the American charts as presented by Joel Whitburn. The charts never seem to stand still, always evolving in an effort to keep up with the recording market place. It all started off so simply (sort of) with the tracking of sheet music sales, followed by vinyl juke box plays, then store sales and radio plays – but it did not stay simple for long:\n\nThe Billboard Pop Charts\n\nThe Singles\n\nA very early chart appearing in the January 34rd, 1942 edition of Billboard\n\nThese are among the Billboard Chart listings as of January 1st, 1944 – Notice that “The Harlem Hit Parade” is shown here – a predecessor to the “Race Records” tabulations.\n\nHere is the appearance of the “Honor Roll of Hits” (and other charts) as of June 12th, 1948 in Billboard:\n\nBillboard January 1st, 1955 (with some example music ads – Georgia Gibbs)\n\nBillboard July 16th, 1955 – “Coming Up Strong” Charts\n\nOctober of 1958 witnessed the arrival of the “Hot 100” charts\n\nHere is the “Hot 100” as it evolved in October of 1958\n\n.This May 1967 “Hot 100” chart reflects a long running classic style for Billboard\n\nLong Plays\n\nBillboard March 24th, 1956 “Best Selling Pop Albums”\n\nBillboard May 25th, 1959 “Top LP’s – Best Selling Monophonic LP’s” & “Best Selling Stereophonic LP’s”\n\nBillboard “Top LP’s” November 25th, 1967 – 200 Positions\n\n“The Billboard 200” 1992 Long Play Charts\n\nThe “Race” Billboard Charts\n\nSingles\n\n“Race” records was the jargon applied to 78 rpm records and first came into use in the 1920’s. Billboard started using the term in the 1940’s after featuring “The Harlem Hit Parade”. Reportedly, industry journalist Jerry Wexler, who became a force and producer for the Atlantic record family, changed the reference to “rhythm and blues” in about 1949 based on the sensitivity he was intercepting from the black populace. In 1969 a transition to “soul” was accomplished and in 1990 references to “hip hop” were in place.\n\n“Harlem Hit Parade” in Billboard, October 24th, 1942 along with featured artist ads in that edition. R&B performers seldom had advertising taken out in those early days. The “Benny Carter” ad was an exception at the time.\n\nIt was February of 1948 and Billboard was now using “Race” in their chart nomenclature. Two examples of issue ads here “Jonnie Johnston, Blue Barron as well as Abbott and Costello.\n\nIt is now June of 1949, with Billboard making a switch to “Rhythm ‘n’ Blues” (“Best-Selling” and “Most Played” charts illustrated). Dorothy Carless along with Homer & Jethro and June Carter ads presented.\n\nThe year is 1965 (January 1st, 1965) and Billboard is featuring a 40 position “Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles” chart. (Johnny Tillotson & Johnny Nash ads featured).\n\nBy July of 1973, Billboard was featuring a full-100 position “Hot Soul Singles” chart. (Smokey Robinson & Isaac Hayes ads featured)\n\nNow in June of 1982, Billboard is featuring the 100 position “Black Singles” chart (Ray Parker Jr., and Cheryl Lynn/Luther Vandross).\n\nAnd finally in April of 2005 we have the “R&B/Hip Hop” charts (Latin Rap and Toni Braxton featured in ads)\n\nLong Plays\n\nBillboard “Top Selling R&B LP’s” May, 13th, 1967\n\nThe Billboard “Folk” and “Country” Charts\n\nSingles\n\nThe earliest country tracks were referred to as “Folk Records” in this 1944 Billboard chart (Tommy Dorsey, Erskine Hawkins and Smiley Burnette trade ads illustrated)\n\nIn the 1956 Billboard had established “C&W” headings for the country charts (Gene Krupa and Billy Ward/Dominos trade ads appearing in this June 30th issue)\n\nIn this Billboard October 15th, 1966 charts we have 75 “Hot Country Singles” shown (Key Talent artists shown along with Merle Hagard and Kenny Vernon)\n\nAnd we have the 100 position “Hot Country Singles” in 1973 (Little David Wilkins and the group Climax illustrated in trade ads)\n\nLong Plays\n\nBillboard “Hot Country Albums” – May 16th, 1964\n\nSpecialty Billboard Charts\n\nBillboard 1976 – “Easy Listening Chart”\n\nBillboard Hot 100 Sales & Airplay – 1984 Charts\n\nBillboard Top 40 Radio Monitor & Top 40 Radio Recurrent Monitor 1991 Charts\n\nBillboard “Top Adult Alternative” with “New Age Albums” and “World Music Albums” Charts\n\nBillboard “Album Rock Tracks” and “Modern Rock Tracks” Charts 1993\n\nBillboard “Christian/Gospel” Charts\n\nBillboard “Dance” Charts\n\nBillboard “Digital Songs” Charts\n\nBillboard “Launch Pad Heatseekers” Charts\n\nBillboard Hits of the U.K. Charts\n\nBillboard “Hits of the World” Charts\n\nBillboard “Jazz/Classical/World” Charts\n\nBillboard “Latin” Charts\n\nBillboard “Pop/Adult/Rock” Charts\n\nBillboard “Social/Streaming” Charts\n\nBillboard started featuring holiday songs apart from the regular charts as illustrated on this December 21st, 1963 “Christmas Records” chart displaying singles and long plays\n\nLocal Recording Producer/Engineer Shares His Story\n\nIt was a treat to hear recently from local Colorado recording personality MC Malthus.\n\nCanary’s Nick Spicer\n\nMC has remained active in the recording community for many years, crossing paths and working with many diverse artists from the Colorado music scene. One of his close associates is a local musician, Nick Spicer:\n\nMalthus: “My friend Nick Spicer was in the Electric Canary (back in the 1960’s) as well as many other local bands.” Malthus related driving by the band’s home location in a house located in the community of Sheridan near Hampden and Federal. Nick Spicer joined the Electric Canary after serving in Viet Nam, upon his return in 1968. The band broke up in November of 1968.\n\n“Nick was also in a band called Copper Train. Copper Train was featured in ‘Tiger Beat Magazine’. That band was featured in the “Groovy Sounds from the Midwest” segment of the magazine. I helped him track down a copy of the magazine on EBay. If my memory serves, it was the June or July of 1969 issue of the magazine.”\n\nMC tells us that Spicer also backed radio personalities Hal and Charlie during their comedy act at various local clubs as well as backing them occasionally on their highly-rated radio show (KHOW).\n\nMalthus: “He (Spicer) was also in one of those faceless pickup touring bands that backed up famous people. He said he toured (backing) the Archies, the 1910 Fruit Gum Co., and several other one-hit wonders. Some local promoter managed these one-hit wonders and would use local bands to tour (with them) around the region. Sugar, Sugar!”\n\nMC relates that Spicer still currently performs around the Denver and Boulder area as well occasionally in Georgetown, concentrating on jazz and pop music, accompanied by a female vocalist and a sax player.\n\nPast Musician & Present Acquaintances\n\nMC knew members of 1960’s Denver band Hannigan’s Greenhouse, which included Allen Brown, Dave Brown and Rick Brown.\n\nMC was also a friend of Sugarloaf’s guitarist (also Beast) Bob Yeazel (now in the Colorado Music Hall of Fame). Another friend was a member of the national group, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Gary Duncan. Duncan was an original member of that California group, which formed in 1965. He was previously with a band called The Brogues. Over time, Duncan would put together reformations of the Quicksilver, working right into the 21st Century with the band.\n\nMalthus: “Quicksilver Messenger Service was a famous band out of San Fran. They recorded 8 or 10 albums for Capitol between 1968 and 1975. You may recall they had a fairly large hit with a song entitled “FRESH AIR.” If you aren’t familiar with it, you can hear most all of their music on YouTube. I am also friendly with Jorma Kaukonen and Paul Kantner of the Jefferson Airplane, David Frieberg of Quicksilver & Jefferson Starship, Barry “The Fish” Melton of Country Joe and the Fish, and Nick Gravenites of the Electric Flag. You might say I am a big fan of the Quicksilver family of musicians.”\n\nMC’s professional career has included involvement with Gregory Ego, Jeff Wirtzfeld, Clarinet Plunger, Reverand Lead Pipe and His Pipe-Welding Swingers, MC Malthus & Genre 136, Little Fyodor as well as working with Nick Spicer.\n\nMC Malthus’ Journey\n\nMalthus: “I was the lead guitar player in both Ski Vietnam and Lobotomy Council. Ski Vietnam was together about four months. We are notable because our bass player, Karl West, went on to perform in a local punk band called Dead Silence. They put out some records and toured the nation. I have attached the very first Ski Vietnam poster from 1985 (see below). Sadly, the bands listed did not play. The only other band that played that evening was “UTI.” The are mentioned in the DENVOID book. Lobotomy Council was around about four years, late 1985 through the late spring of 1989. When everyone graduated from college in Bould-aire, the band broke up. The Ski Vietnam stuff is mentioned around pgs. 120-122 in the DENVOID book.”\n\nNOTES: Interested in Nick Spicer’s Music? Visit Revernation and search for his “Old Guy Fables” CD. –\n\nRecords – Vinyl’s Long and Amazing Journey via the Record Store\n\nI just completed reading and being captivated by a great little eclectic book titled “Record Store Days – From Vinyl to Digital and Back Again”.\n\nThe focus of this Post, of course, is on some of the tantalizing and intriguing ditties present in this 240-page narrative pertaining the good old American record store.\n\nAmerica’s Oldest Record Store\n\nAccording to “Record Store Days”, the title of “oldest record store” in the United States goes to George’s Song Shop located in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, being opened back in 1932. The store, “…is stocked with about one million 45’s, 50,000 LP’s” and at least at one time, tons of CD’s.\n\nWallichs Music City\n\nCalamar/Gallo relate that Wallichs was a pioneer record store, along with The Commodore, Sam Goody’s and The Colony all located in New York City. Glenn Wallichs was the proprietor of several radio repair stores in California which he decided to sell in order to open his soon-to-become legendary record shop in Los Angeles in 1940.\n\nWallichs was easily the largest store on the West Coast and featured a promotional approach which would spread to other shops in short order, the “listening booth”. Clientele could take recordings into these booths prior to making a purchase. Of course, many clients would pass on making a purchase and thus Wallach’s became a pioneer as well offering these recordings for sale as “used records”.\n\nBig Labels Ignore Wallichs\n\nThe major labels at the time of the store’s founding, RCA, Columbia and Decca, would not direct-sell recordings to Wallichs which put him at a disadvantage. and so report Calamar and Gallo write “One of his (Wallichs) early customers was Johnny Mercer, the songwriter, who had branched into film production as well. They bonded after Mercer’s wife Ginger had surprised the songwriter by getting a radio installed in his car in 1935 when Wallichs was doing that type of work.\n\n“Wallichs, Mercer, and Paramount production chief Buddy DeSylva sat down and decided to create a record label. Mercer would put up most of the money and Wallichs would run the label. DeSylva would be its chairman. They considered the names Liberty and Victory – this was in 1942, with the U.S. at war – but both were dropped for being too similar to old company names. They went with Ginger’s suggestion: Capitol.”\n\nAnd so a very formidable record giant was born on the West Coast. The original operation for Capitol would be situated in the floor above the record store. The landmark ‘Capitol Tower’ would be constructed in 1956 adjacent to Wallichs.\n\nPaul Whiteman\n\nFor the initial Capitol release, Colorado’s Paul Whiteman was contracted and recorded Capitol release 101 – “I Found a New Baby” b/w “The General Jumped at Dawn” released in June of 1942.\n\nRecord Store Journeys\n\nCalamar and Gallo present us with an unmatched journey through the history of record collecting from the sheet music days after the turn of the 20th Century, to early radio, the ever-evolving music charts, and of course, vinyl.\n\nIn the beginning, record stores flourished, with more than 25,000 spread across the nation in the 1920’s. That number would diminish to less than 3,000 50 years later.\n\nAlong the way vinyl nearly succumbed to the CD format which was in large part promoted by both Sony and Pioneer who were developing players for the CD format. CDs came along and seemed to thrive but there were problems, one being unforeseen “The downside when CDs started was they wanted to load up 70 minutes of music. That’s not how people work. You create in small bursts,” observed a music industry spokesman in “Record Store Days”.\n\nThe CD was an evolution from the laser disc. It became a reality at the end of the 1970’s and by the end of the 1980’s had nearly displaced vinyl all-together, though not completely.\n\nThe book finally and joyously reports, that vinyl has returned! Anyone who is into recorded music knows this. Record shows are alive and well, and “Record Store Days” are enthusiastically embraced across the nation. Record Store Days are even supported by a national web site (click on the image here to visit the site).\n\nTreat yourself to a wonderful experience – and obtain “Record Store Days” – What a wonderful journey!"
