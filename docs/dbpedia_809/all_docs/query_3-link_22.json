        "text": "Amsterdam based zine by Edwin Feenstra (later Wicked Witch recs), André Wehl & Hanz/Hans Vermaas. My mate Dirk Ceustermans borrowed me his copy of #2. This one includes the bands ‘Strong Concentration Of Anger’, ‘Disgust’ & ‘Nog Watt’ and gig/zine/music-reviews. The first issue was free (10 pages) and had an interview with ‘Deadlock’, some reviews (gigs/music) and a cartoon by André. I believe there was also one with ‘Wretched’…\n\n‘Nog Watt’ (meaning “something else/more”) was a hardcore/punk band from Amsterdam (not to be confounded with ‘Van Alles & Nog Watt’, from Wormer). The people in the band were: Ingrid Dodeman (drums; ex ‘No Pigs’, later Konkurrent label & tours) – nowadays Ingrid Kerr (married to Andy of ‘No Means No’), Joanna Mak (vocals; later Sonic Rendezvous distribution), ‘Kers’ (guitar) & Marlies Ter Stege (bass). They released a 7″ EP entitled Fear and were featured on the Beware Of The Wolf In Sheep’s Clothing compilation-LP (both in 1985). The year after the (double LP) Emma compilation got out, which also contained a track by them.\n\n[Translation below]\n\nWHAT’S THE LINE-UP OF THE BAND?\n\nJoanna – vocals, Kers – guitar, Marlies – bass, Ingrid – drums.\n\nHOW LONG DOES THE BAND EXIST?\n\n1,5 years, but we started from scratch, so did nothing for a quite some time. Because of that and the holidays, we get to more than a year.\n\nYOU SOMETIMES GET LABELED AS FEMALE HARDCORE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?\n\nAaaaargh, sigh, we’re actually curious what that is. We’re more likely to be asked, and we really try our best to become boys, but it doesn’t work. People just don’t fall for it. We’ve only experienced it something like once or twice that a bill didn’t mention we were a female band or played girl-punk. We were even labeled “fast wave” once. Or if it isn’t mentioned on the poster, it’s printed in the magazine ‘a girl band that plays very fast music’ or something of that kind. Well, I would like to know what we actually are as a band. For example: we were billed with ‘Hiroshima Nooduitgang’ once. And then there was announced ‘Nog Watt’ – girl-punk – and ‘H.N.’. That’s so stupid and people often don’t understand it when you explain that we don’t like that all. It sounds obvious then. Perhaps it’s also because it’s strange that people see a girl on stage, because that hardly ever happens. But we don’t like it!!! It’s just stupid if people keep on going about female band, girl-punk; then it’s just made so special that people will find it special. And then you get those comments, for example, ‘it’s kind of well played for a female band’, as if that’s a different gradation for you to be judged. Like you’re not being taken seriously.\n\nDID YOU DELIBERATELY START OFF WITH FOUR GIRLS OR IS THAT A COINCIDENCE?\n\nJust pure coincidence. We started with 2 boys but that didn’t work out. But we just got off as 4 girlfriends; you usually start a band with friends.\n\nWHAT KIND OF MUSIC DO YOU PLAY?\n\nAll kinds of music; we don’t want to follow the fashion that prevails in that music-world at that moment. Even if it’s songs from 1900: if we like them we just do it. As long as it doesn’t sound too slow. You do get influenced but I think that happens unknowingly.\n\nHOW MANY SONGS DO YOU HAVE AND WHAT ARE THEY ABOUT?\n\nAbout 15, but we threw out almost everything from when we started. All our lyrics deal with something, so no fun lyrics. Political lyrics about what’s happening around us, Central-America, police; stereotypical but important indeed. It can’t be stated often enough. Also personal lyrics. We also have a song about that kind of people who talk shit so easily, like “Oh it’s so bad what happens in El Salvador.”, etc. But in their own environment, how they act and behave themselves: they turn out to be huge bastards. It’s very easy to say things but you also have to live by it.\n\nWE’VE LEARNED THAT YOU’RE PLANNING TO GO TO ITALY, IS THAT CORRECT AND ARE YOU GOING TO MORE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES?\n\nYes, I think ‘tour’ is a rotten word, it’s just a vacation and we’ll perform in Italy. We’ve received addresses from people and we’ll go there. They seem to be very nice people who are very active. The people from ‘Negazione’ arrange that for us and it’s very nice to see how it will be there anyway. And we’ll also play in Spain. It’s nice that it’s all so easy; every band can take the initiative to go abroad, if you have addresses and you write to bands there. If you also make a holiday out of it and take care that what you spend here, you also spend over there, and make sure that you don’t lose any money, it can only be fun.\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK OF AUDIENCES IN GENERAL?\n\nWell, that’s really very different. There are nice people and bastards among them. It’s different everywhere; in some places it was very pleasant and in other places very uncomfortable. But one thing struck me… We sometimes played at girl-parties, but only if boys were allowed in too… But then that’s organised by girls, and then you see boys act enthusiastically or at least shout booh or hurray, and the girls that are standing on the side go like “(giggle-giggle) Look at her with that guitar.”. You often have girls responding very strangely, what are they on about? Sometimes we get very nice reactions from girls but that is rare. But it’s different everywhere.\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE RECORDINGS ON THE COMPILATION-LP ‘BEWARE OF THE WOLF IN SHEEP’S CLOTHING’?\n\nBad. We’re not satisfied with it. But our songs on it are older ones. All instruments are distorted, it just doesn’t sound the way it should do. Not the way how we really sound like. If someone in the studio doesn’t know what kind of music we want to make or doesn’t like it, he always tries to clean it up. And he succeeded quite well.\n\nWILL YOU RELEASE MORE THINGS ON LP, TAPE OR SINGLE AFTER THE COMPILATION-LP?\n\nYes, probably a single with 6 or so tracks. We’ll try to put as many songs as possible on it but still taking care that the quality is still somwhat OK. We’re on the waiting-list but it will take a while.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THE FUTURE?\n\nPractice more, make better songs and renew, because if you play the same song 2.000 times it will also get boring.\n\nANYTHING ELSE TO SAY?\n\nGirls get of your bums, go do something. The only way to prove that you can do something is to actually do it. You don’t necessarily have to play in a band, you can do a zine for example, arrange concerts, do radio-shows; you can do so many things. And we wish boys would look at things in more normal way and judge you just like a band with boys.\n\n‘Nog Watt’ (Shaffy @ Amsterdam, 85-02-28) by Hans Vermaas"
