        "text": "Mike Peterson\n\nRichfield/Highland\n\nWith tender hearts we said goodbye to Michael Frank Peterson, our beloved husband, father and grandfather, in the early morning hours of October 31, 2016 in Highland, Utah. Over the past three years, Mike faced a glioblastoma brain tumor with faith and optimism. His attitude was inspiring. Never a complaint. Always positive. Always appreciative. And though he did everything possible to fight the cancer in a physical sense, he humbly acknowledged the blessing of an extended life because of the many prayers and combined faith on his behalf.\n\nMike was born May 27, 1959 in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Franklin and Marilyn Anderson Peterson. He was raised in Roosevelt, Utah, which lent itself to a childhood full of camping, hunting and motorcycle riding. In high school, Mike was a disciplined athlete, and he excelled in many sports.\n\nMike served in the Mexico Merida LDS Mission. The experiences of his mission honed his skills of leadership, hard work and especially service to others – an attribute that anyone who knows Mike has experienced. Even in his last days, barely able to speak above a whisper, Mike made it a point to thank each and every visitor for taking time to stop by, or for serving his family.\n\nMike married Sheri Bellon on November 25, 1981 in the Salt Lake Temple and attended Utah State where he earned his Master’s degree. Mike started as a lineman for a rural electric cooperative and ended his career still committed to the cooperative principles. As statewide manager for the Utah Rural Electric Association, Mike influenced thousands of individuals. He served on countless boards, organized and directed a youth leadership conference each summer, and took time to get to know so many people on a personal basis. Mike always went above and beyond in his professional work and made many dear friends during his 30 years of service.\n\nThere was nothing more important to Mike than his family. He gave everything he had to make them happy and provide them with opportunities to challenge themselves. His biscuits and gravy were legendary, and we have many memories of skiing the slopes at Snowbird and Alta together. He cherished his five granddaughters: Kate, Ruby, Reese, Molly and Greta. They will miss their \"Bumpa\" tremendously.\n\nOver the years, Mike served in many religious capacities within the LDS church, most visibly as bishop of the Richfield 3rd and Highland 10th Wards, and as a counselor in the Highland Utah West Stake. He served selflessly and humbly, and had an ability to buoy people up. His memory was keen and he had the talent to motivate and teach, usually without any notes. He would often urge us to \"try a little harder,\" \"look beyond yourself,\" and \"give to those who need your help.\"\n\nMike lived a Christ-centered life in every regard. His personal conviction, faith and knowledge of God’s plan have assured our family that we will all be reunited again.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife, Sheri; their children: Jennie (Chris), Jeff (Hailey), Ali and Andrew. He is also survived by his mother, Marilyn Peterson; brothers: Robert, Richard and Marc. Mike is preceded in death by his father, Franklin Peterson.\n\nFuneral services will be held Monday, November 7, 2016 at 11:00 a.m. in the Highland Utah LDS West Stake Center, 11605 North 6000 West, Highland, UT, where friends may call Sunday evening from 6:00 to 9:00 p.m., and Monday morning from 9:00 to 10:30 a.m.. Burial will be in the Highland Cemetery. Funeral Directors: Magleby Mortuary, Richfield, Salina and Manti.\n\nThe family extends heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Howard Coleman, Sean, Kylee and the staff at Huntsman Cancer Institute for their outstanding care and service.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family kindly requests contributions to LDS Charities."
