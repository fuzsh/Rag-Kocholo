        "text": "A Navy destroyer that is under construction will bear the name of native Topekan and military trailblazer Frank E. Petersen Jr., who died last year at age 83.\n\nSecretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced Nov. 9 that Arleigh Burke-class destroyer DDG 121 would be named in honor of Petersen, a three-star general who became the first black aviator, first black general and first black base commander in the Marine Corps.\n\n“The courage and perseverance of Lt. Gen. Petersen throughout his distinguished and groundbreaking career make him especially deserving of this honor,” Mabus said. “Those who serve aboard DDG 121 will, for decades, carry on the storied legacy of this Marine Corps hero.”\n\nConstruction of the USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. began April 27 at the Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss., the Navy reported on its website at http://cjon.co/2gi43pi.\n\nThe vessel is expected to enter the Navy fleet in 2020. The ship will be 509 feet long, have a beam length of 59 feet and be capable of operating at speeds of more than 30 knots.\n\nPetersen is thought to be the first Topeka native to become the namesake of a U.S. Navy ship.\n\nHe graduated in 1949 from Topeka High School, where Topeka Capital-Journal archives show his brother — Bill Petersen — was the first black player on the Trojan basketball squad.\n\nFrank Petersen’s father initially refused to sign papers to enable him to join the Navy, so he spent two semesters at Washburn University, he told The Capital-Journal.\n\nPetersen enlisted in the Navy in 1950. He left in 1952 to accept a commission as a second lieutenant and become the first black pilot in the Marine Corps.\n\nPetersen flew more than 350 combat missions and more than 4,000 military aircraft hours during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. He also became the first African-American in the Marines to command a fighter squadron, an air group and a major base.\n\nPetersen earned a master’s degree in 1973 from the National War College in Washington, D.C. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1979, major general in 1983 and lieutenant general in 1986. He retired in 1988 as the senior aviator on active duty in the U.S. military.\n\nAwards Petersen received for his service included the Purple Heart, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal and the Legion of Merit with Valor Device.\n\nPetersen told The Capital-Journal his Purple Heart resulted from a mission into North Vietnamese airspace, where a 37 mm cannon shell hit his plane and set its left engine on fire. As Petersen flew home, his other engine caught fire, the blaze burned through his plane’s hydraulic system, and he lost control.\n\nPetersen bailed out just past the South Vietnamese border, “five minutes on the good side, so to speak,” he told the newspaper.\n\nHe said he suffered a broken nose, a compression fracture of a lower vertebra and a hairline fracture of his left hip while ejecting from his plane — then flew about 240 more missions with those injuries while not learning how badly he had been hurt until he returned to the U.S. on leave.\n\nThe Topeka High School Historical Society inducted Frank Petersen into its Hall of Fame in 1986-87.\n\nPresident Barack Obama appointed him in 2010 to the Board of Visitors to the U.S. Naval Academy, which monitors morale, instruction and other matters.\n\nPetersen died last year at his home in Maryland.\n\nContact reporter Tim Hrenchir at (785) 295-1184 or @timhrenchir on Twitter."
