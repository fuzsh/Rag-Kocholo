        "text": "Here's what former students have to say...\n\n\"Not a day goes by when I am not thankful for the education I received at Frank H. Peterson. Because of the time I invested in high school learning Graphic Design, I was able to breeze through my college program and create a stand-out portfolio. I had an agency job shortly after graduation! Thankful for my mentors and instructors!\"\n\n~ Leah Crawford,\n\nCommunications Academy Graduate\n\n“I've been into cars my whole life and enrolled in the Automotive Academy at Peterson. Having a skilled trade taught to me as a high schooler helped put me in the spot I am today. I loved every minute of being in the shop, especially when we could bring our own vehicles in. I’m very thankful for the years I spent Peterson and the connections I made along the way.”\n\n~ Daniel Griffin\n\nAutomotive Academy Graduate"
