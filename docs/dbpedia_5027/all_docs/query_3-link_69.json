He worked his way thru college and law school at Fleming Foods in Topeka. Frank would get an interest in something and then pursue it until he knew all about it.\n\nIn 1966 rank entered the US Navy. After boot camp he was assigned to the Coral Sea CVA-43 (an aircraft carrier) which was stationed off the coast of Vietnam on Yankee Station. He advanced quickly in rank doing various tasks in X division and was a 2nd class petty officer on discharge in 1970. He received the following medals: National Defense Service medal, Vietnam Service medal (5 campaigns), and the Armed Forces Expeditionary medal (Korea). The Coral Sea was in the Sea of Japan when the Pueblo ship was seized. Prior to returning to the US in 1970 the Coral Sea made a good will visit to Australia. Frank was proud to serve in the Navy.\n\nFollowing Graduation from law school and passing the bar exam, Frank practiced law in Kansas in Leavenworth and then Sedan. He was the county attorney in Chatauqua County for 11 years. In 1991, he moved to Wichita and assumed duties as an assistant district attorney until retirement in 2008.\n\nFrank & Linda moved to Schowalter Villa in Hesston’s independent living in June 2008. They enjoyed traveling by car, motorcycles and with the travel trailer for 8 years until medical issues interfered. Interests included bluegrass festivals, roller coasters, reading and music. Frank was an avid reader and had a good memory of what he read and loved to share that knowledge. Sometimes passionately in “lawyer voice.”\n\nFrank is survived by his wife, Linda; sons, Frank White (Natasha) of McPherson KS, Sean White (Wenda) of Aiken SC, Rick Horton (Patti) of Bixby OK; 5 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren. Siblings, Rob White (Peggy) of Wolfe City TX, Cheryl Raborn of Junction City KS and 3 nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, grandparents, brother-in-law Pat Petitte and Glen Raborn and former wife, Donna. He will be missed beyond measure.\n\nA memorial service will be at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, November 6, 2021, at the First United Methodist Church in Valley Center, 560 N. Park Ave., Valley Center, Kansas.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made in Frank’s name to Good Samaritan at Schowalter Vila or the First United Methodist Church in Valley Center in care of Petersen Funeral Home."
