        "text": "Ship Name and Designation History\n\nThis section lists the names and designations that the ship had during its lifetime. The list is in chronological order.\n\nArleigh Burke (Flight IIA) Class Guided Missile Destroyer\n\nNaming Ceremony 30 March 2016 - Construction began 27 April 2016\n\nKeel Laid 21 February 2017 - Launched 13 July 2018\n\nChristened 6 October 2018 - Delivered to USN 30 November 2021\n\nUSS FRANK E.

There should be a separate set of pages for each incarnation of the ship (ie, for each entry in the \"Ship Name and Designation History\" section). Covers should be presented in chronological order (or as best as can be determined).\n\nSince a ship may have many covers, they may be split among many pages so it doesn't take forever for the pages to load. Each page link should be accompanied by a date range for covers on that page.\n\nUSS Frank E. Petersen Jr. Covers Page 1 (2017-2022)\n\nPostmarks\n\nThis section lists examples of the postmarks used by the ship. There should be a separate set of postmarks for each incarnation of the ship (ie, for each entry in the \"Ship Name and Designation History\" section). Within each set, the postmarks should be listed in order of their classification type. If more than one postmark has the same classification, then they should be further sorted by date of earliest known usage.\n\nA postmark should not be included unless accompanied by a close-up image and/or an image of a cover showing that postmark. Date ranges MUST be based ONLY ON COVERS IN THE MUSEUM and are expected to change as more covers are added.\n\n>>> If you have a better example for any of the postmarks, please feel free to replace the existing example.\n\nPostmark Type\n\n---\n\nKiller Bar Text\n\nPostmark\n\nDate Thumbnail Link To\n\nPostmark or\n\nCover Image Thumbnail Link\n\nTo\n\nCover Image\n\nUSPS Type 11\n\n\"Shipbuilding City Br.\"\n\nPascagoula MS\n\n2017-02-21\n\nN/A\n\nKeel Laying, cachet by Richard D.
