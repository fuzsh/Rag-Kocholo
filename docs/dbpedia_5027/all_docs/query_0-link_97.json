        "text": "The U.S. Navy has named its DDG 121 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer as USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. after the first African-American U.S. Marine Corps aviator and general officer.\n\nNavy Secretary Ray Mabus announced the name during a ceremony held at the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, the Defense Department said Wednesday.\n\nPetersen was assigned on 350 combat missions during the Korean and Vietnam wars and was the first African-American to have commanded a fighter squadron, an air group and a major base.\n\n“The courage and perseverance of Lt. Gen. Petersen throughout his distinguished and ground-breaking career make him especially deserving of this honor,” said Mabus.\n\nUSS Frank E. Petersen Jr.Â is currently underÂ constructionÂ at theÂ Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi and is scheduledÂ to enter service byÂ 2020.\n\nArleigh Burke-class destroyers are designed with offensive and defensive weapons systems such as the Flight IIA modification,Â AEGIS Baseline 9 Combat System and Integrated Air and Missile Defense platformÂ toÂ support a variety of operations and allow simultaneous air, surface and subsurface engagements."
