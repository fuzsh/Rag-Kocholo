        "text": "Good morning all!\n\nI’m brand new here and have been lurking for a while after coming across some of the great postings on flight jackets during my Googling.\n\nI’m based in the UK and I wanted to seek some advice on sourcing and attaching the right squadron patches/name tags for a project I have for my first G-1. I originally posted over on The Fedora Lounge\n\nAs I'm new, just a bit of background from me! Many years ago while at university I got my hands on my first leather flight jacket (I already owned a classic green B-15). It was an Avirex made Ed Overend Flying Tigers A-2 I bought pre-owned. I eventually gifted it to my brother as my desire was always for a G-1. I’m a lifelong armchair aviator and have always been more drawn to naval aviation, be it the US, Royal or any other Navy!\n\nSimilar to this great creation from another poster https://www.thefedoralounge.com/threads/g-1-patching-help.93981/ I wanted to finally get a reasonably priced G-1 and patch it in honour of a great aviator I admire, Lieutenant General Frank E. Petersen, USMC. If you haven’t heard of him please give his name a quick Google and check out his autobiography, “Into The Tigers Jaw” - he was the first African-American Marine Corps aviator and the first African-American Marine Corps General. I was hoping to patch it in relation to his time as CO of VMFA-314 (he was a Colonel at the time).\n\nSo, for my creation there's two questions:\n\n1. The Jacket\n\nI was originally after the G-1 55J14 that AVI LTHR produce but they seem to be very inactive over there and advice from some other posters over on TFL recommended checking out Five Star Leather. I'm sure there will be others here who've purchased from them so would love any input before I reach out to them with specifics. Also, I'm not after a distressed looking jacket, I'd like something new I can have to age with me and get it's own patina and nicks and scrapes!\n\n2. Patches/Name Tag\n\nI've seen lots of great leather squadron patches which I think are more of a recent trend (correct me if I'm wrong) but obviously creating an authentic style would require a classic embroidered patch. I came across popularpatch.com and flightjacket.com, both US based sites and immediately found the VMFA 314 patch for the right breast:\n\nAs well as the MCAS Miramar patch (where 314 are based) for one of the sleeves. This is obviously a more recent looking patch so for more authenticity of the 60's/70's era I may not go for this but would welcome the advice from veteran aviators or those more knowledgeable :\n\nFor the name tag it seems this would be closest to what would've been seen in the era (again please advise if you were there) with the Eagle, Globe & Anchor replaced with Naval Aviator insignia. Looking at the USMC regulations the rule is first initials only, whereas Navy allow for initials or first name:\n\nI've seen on Five Star's site they state that they can produce name tags as well but would look to advise them on producing the most accurate name tag for the error - which if they can't produce I'd source from flighjackets.com or another perhaps.\n\nAppreciate all input and have a great day!\n\n-Q\n\nHey Quari\n\nWelcome to the forum! That sounds like an interesting project you are putting together. I get the part about wanting to purchase a new jacket that you can wear and age yourself , but my initial thoughts on your tribute jacket are , You are putting together a pretty detailed representation of a specific jacket , worn by a specific person . So there’s elements of accuracy and details that have to be addressed. Why not go the extra mile and find an original G-1 in nice shape that gets you even closer to what General Peterson actually wore. The prices for original G-1s are fairly reasonable and an original wouldn’t be much more money that a repro. It would certainly add a lot in terms of accuracy and value to your project . Just my opinion . Good Luck with your efforts and please post some photos of the jacket once it’s completed .\n\nCheers\n\nThanks, I’ve kept an open mind on this so I will take a look at some originals; I’ve always wanted a G-1 first and foremost and then after reading about Gen Petersen I thought combining the two could be perfect.\n\nI was a bit hesitant about an original as I was concerned about the condition and also just wanting to make something my own; something didn’t feel right about owning one of these great pieces of aviation history that belonged to an aviator (I wonder why someone would even give it up!) but to be fair if I’m really creating a tribute why not go all the way! Perhaps the next one could be brand new and all mine!"
