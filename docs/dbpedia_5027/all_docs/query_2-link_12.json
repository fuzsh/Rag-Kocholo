Seeitalics.\n\nThe period and the comma always go within quotation marks. The dash, the semicolon, the question mark and the exclamation point go within the quotation marks when they apply to the quoted matter only. They go outside when they apply to the whole sentence.\n\nRace and Ethnicity\n\nAfrican American, black, white, Latino, Latina/o and Hispanic are acceptable designations, among many others. After carefully considering whether identification by a category such as race is helpful in context, respect an individual’s preferred term if a preference is expressed.

Do not include a hyphen in Asian American, Mexican American, etc.\n\nAfrican American studies\n\noral histories of Vietnamese Americans\n\nSee Hispanic-serving.\n\nRasmussen Hall Opened in 1976 as part of Old West complex and renovated in 2001.
