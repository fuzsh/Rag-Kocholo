        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nOctober 1, 2018\n\nChristening of USS Frank Emmanuel Petersen, Jr. (DDG 121)\n\nThe Descendants of the Korean War Foundation (DKWF) is proud to announce the christening of the USS Frank E. Petersen, Jr. (DDG 121) in honor of the late Frank E. Petersen, Jr., a Korean War veteran. The christening will be held October 6, 2018, in Pascagoula, Mississippi, at the Huntington Ingalls Industries Shipyard.\n\nFrank E. Petersen, Jr. (March 2, 1932 – August 25, 2015) was the first African American USMC; aviator, Brigadier General, Major General and Lieutenant General. Petersen retired from the Marine Corps in 1988 after 38 years of service. At the time of his retirement he was by date of aviator designation the senior ranking aviator in the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy with respective titles of ‘Silver Hawk’ and Gray Eagle. His date of designation as an aviator also precedes all other aviators in the U.S. Air Force and Army. The Frank E Petersen, Jr. (DDG 121) is configured as a Flight IIA destroyer, which enables power projection, forward presence, and escort operations at sea in support of Low Intensity Conflict/Coastal and Littoral Offshore Warfare as well as open ocean conflict.\n\n“The late General Petersen, Jr., was highly decorated for his bravery and leadership throughout his uniformed service. DDG121 will continue the lifelong mission of the General, to protect and safeguard this nation and the world. DKWF applauds the christening in honor of the General, a Korean War veteran. I look forward to joining the Petersen family, the Commandant for the U.S. Marine Corp and the U.S. Navy to witness and celebrate this historic day in Pascagoula, Mississippi,” said Justin Rhee, DKWF President.\n\nDKWF, a 501(c)3 non-profit and fully volunteer-run organization, is dedicated to recognizing, remembering and honoring the U.S. men and women who fought for freedom and democracy during the Korean War, often referred to as the Forgotten War. More information about DKWF projects can be obtained via our website, www.DescendantsOfKoreanWar.org.\n\nContact: Dr. Ruth Starr, VP for Communications 202-297-3011"
