        "text": "A case selected for argument usually involves interpretations of the U. S. Constitution or federal law. At least four Justices have selected the case as being of such importance that the Supreme Court must resolve the legal issues.\n\nAn attorney for each side of a case will have an opportunity to make a presentation to the Court and answer questions posed by the Justices. Prior to the argument, each side has submitted a legal brief—a written legal argument outlining each party’s points of law. The Justices have read these briefs prior to argument and are thoroughly familiar with the case, its facts, and the legal positions that each party is advocating.\n\nBeginning the first Monday in October, the Court generally hears two arguments a day, beginning at 10 a.m., with occasional afternoon sessions scheduled as necessary. Arguments are held on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays in two-week intervals through late April (with longer breaks during December and February). The argument calendars are posted on the Court’s Website under the \"Oral Arguments\" link. In the recesses between argument sessions, the Justices are busy writing opinions, deciding which cases to hear in the future, and reading the briefs for the next argument session. They grant review in approximately 80 of the more than 5,000-7,000 petitions filed with the Court each Term. No one knows exactly when a decision will be handed down by the Court in an argued case, nor is there a set time period in which the Justices must reach a decision. However, all cases argued during a Term of Court are decided before the summer recess begins, usually by the end of June.\n\nDuring an argument week, the Justices meet in a private conference, closed even to staff, to discuss the cases and to take a preliminary vote on each case. If the Chief Justice is in the majority on a case decision, he decides who will write the opinion. He may decide to write it himself or he may assign that duty to any other Justice in the majority. If the Chief Justice is in the minority, the Justice in the majority who has the most seniority assumes the assignment duty.\n\nParticipants in the Courtroom\n\nBar Member Seating\n\nAttorneys who are admitted as members of the Supreme Court Bar may be seated in the chairs just beyond the bronze railing. Any member of the Supreme Court Bar may attend any argument, space permitting. Before entering, they will be required to report to the Clerk’s assistant who is seated at the Visitor Desk in the Lower Great Hall on the ground floor. The Supreme Court Bar check-in process normally begins at 8:30 a.m., but line may form in advance in front of the Supreme Court Building. Only Bar members who actually intend to attend argument are allowed in line for the Bar section; \"line standers\" are not permitted. Bar members are required to show the assistant a photo identification card and each name is checked against the Bar membership roster. Inform the assistant if your name is different from the one used when you were admitted to the Bar. Bar members will be issued a pass and directed to proceed to the Courtroom on the first floor. Seating is on a first&dash; come, first&dash;seated basis. When the Bar section is filled, remaining Bar members will be seated in the Lawyers’ Lounge where arguments can be heard through a loudspeaker. Bar members are asked to wear professional business attire. Male attorneys shall wear a coat and a tie. Female attorneys shall wear comparable attire (suit, dress, or dress slacks with matching jacket). Hats and furs are not permitted. Topcoats, raincoats, jackets and umbrellas must be checked in the checkroom\n\nOthers\n\nCourtroom Seating"
