        "meta_description": "The Supreme Court of Florida is the highest court in the U.S. state of Florida. It consists of seven justices–one of whom serves as Chief Justice. Six members are chosen from six districts around the state to foster geographic diversity, and one is selected at large.  The website contains opinions, oral arguments, administrative orders, jury instructions, justices, court orders, online dockets, case information, court schedule, and procedures.",

        "text": "In the Supreme Court, use of the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal is mandatory for attorneys in good standing with The Florida Bar in compliance with Rule 2.525, Fla. R. Jud. Admin., and Administrative Order AOSC13-7.\n\nThe Court makes available many different forms of information about cases. The most common way to find information about a case is to review the case’s docket -- a list of briefs and other filings and rulings in that case.\n\nRequests to the Florida Supreme Court for official public records should be made in writing pursuant to Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 to publicinformation@flcourts.org. Rule 2.420 is the judicial counterpart to Florida's public records statutes, Chapter 119. Records in cases that have been finalized are transferred to the Florida State Archives or returned to the clerk of court in the county where the case originated, so requests for these files must be made to these entities."
