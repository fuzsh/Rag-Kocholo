        "text": "There are many people involved in the court system. Below is a list of some of the people you might meet if you are required to attend court:\n\nAccused\n\nThe person against whom a criminal case is brought. Sometimes referred to as the defendant.\n\nAssociate Judge (Supreme Court)\n\nThe person who generally carries out the judicial function of hearing and determining issues which arise before and after trial in civil cases. Associate Judges do not hear trials.\n\nBarrister\n\nA legal advocate who is briefed by a solicitor to present the defence or prosecution case in court.\n\nBench clerk (Magistrates', Coroners and Children's Court)\n\nSits near the magistrate or coroner, and announces the cases and calls people into court. The bench clerk will direct people where to stand, read the charges out in a criminal proceeding and administer the oath or affirmation to witnesses.\n\nDefence Solicitor or Duty Solicitor\n\nThe person who represents the accused in court. If the accused does not have a solicitor, they may be entitled to representation by a duty solicitor.\n\nInformant\n\nIn criminal cases, this is the police officer who charged the defendant. In coronial inquests, this is the police officer who investigated on behalf of the coroner. In some cases, the informant is a council officer or other government official.\n\nJudge\n\nThe person who hears cases and makes decisions in the County Court and Supreme Court. If a judge and a jury hear the case, the judge will be responsible for directing the jury about the law. If the accused is found guilty, the judge will impose the sentence.\n\nIn Victoria, the State Coroner is also a judge. When you speak to a judge, you should address them as 'Your Honour'.\n\nJudge's Associate (Supreme, County and Coroners Courts)\n\nPerforms various administrative and court duties to assist the judge.

They decide what happens to a case, whether a case will have to go to another court or be put off until another day, whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty, and any penalty that will be given to the defendant. Some coroners are also magistrates.\n\nWhen you speak to a magistrate or coroner, you should address them as 'Your Honour'.\n\nPlaintiff, complainant or applicant\n\nThe person who initiates the case in a non-criminal (civil) matter.\n\nProsecutor\n\nThe person who appears in court to present the case against the defendant in a criminal hearing.
