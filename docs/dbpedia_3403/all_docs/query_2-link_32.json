        "text": "Amateur Status\n\n(updated 3-12-14)\n\n3-12-14\n\nQ: I was reading the WIAA Bulletin and it said for open gyms that the coach can recreate w/ students. For baseball, does that mean a coach can throw bp as long he doesn't coach or advise or anything like that?\n\nA: Absolutely not. Baseball coaches may throw with players, but not catch the pitcher from a catcher's stance. Baseball coaches may hit in the batting cage, but may not pitch batting practice or drop balls into the pitching machine. Baseball coaches may field ground balls, but may not hit ground balls. If it looks like a baseball drill, the coach may not do it. Recreate is not doing drills. Recreate is playing. See the examples below from 3-15-10 and 10-27-07.\n\n4-24-10\n\nQ.: I have a question about accepting prize money from cycling races I compete in over the summer. I was wondering if it would be permissible that if I were to win any cash prize, that I could accept only the amount of entry for the race?\n\nA.: Our amateur status rules which the member schools have put into effect limit student-athletes from receiving benefits from athletic achievements in WIAA recognized sports. ROE Article IV provides is that (paraphrase): A student must be an amateur in ALL WIAA recognized sports in order to be eligible - in ANY WIAA sponsored sports. Thus, since the Association does not presently sponsor interscholastic cycling amateur status restrictions do not apply to your cycling achievements. Current WIAA recognized sports are: Baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, hockey, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, volleyball, and wrestling for boys, and basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, hockey, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, and volleyball for girls.\n\n3-15-10\n\nQ.: I am the association manager of our local bowling association, and I have a young gentleman that will be going out for the high school golf team and wants to bowl in a USBC sanctioned league. There will be prize money at the end of the bowling season which will be the second week of April. What is his eligibility or penalty if he participates up to the beginning of the season, or during the season? He is under 18 and his parents have signed a USBC waiver?\n\nA.: ROE Article IV provides is that (paraphrase): A student must be an amateur in ALL WIAA recognized sports in order to be eligible - in ANY WIAA sponsored sports. Thus, since the Association does not presently sponsor interscholastic bowling amateur status restrictions do not apply.\n\n2-5-10\n\nQ.: I represent a free publication in the Madison area. We would like to highlight two area high school athletes. There will obviously be no compensation, just an interview and photos. Do you foresee any problems or violations?\n\nA.: Articles published by news gathering publications have been acceptable by our member's rules. In addition, articles may celebrate a student-athlete and/or and their team/school accomplishments. Your concerns may revolve around amateur status. Athletes may not appear in ads promoting a publication, product, or service whether they receive compensation or not.\n\n1-15-10\n\nQ.: I own a local running store, and we are going to be doing a team building event for the store at a fun run on February 13, 2010. I have two students athletes that work for me, and I don't want it to affect their track eligibility. They both own jerseys with our store name on them already, so they will not be receiving any prizes or benefit from running on the team. Please let me know if they can run on the store team for this event without making them ineligible for the 2010 track season.\n\nA.: The students may run since it will be during the off season for both cross country and track. They may compete on the team, but cannot receive any benefits other than a trophy, etc. They could wear the t-shirts, but you would want to refrain from using any photos with them in any advertising.\n\nQ.: Can a club volleyball organization, not associated with the school, give a scholarship to a 9th grade student to pay her fees for the club? The club wanted to ask to make sure that if they scholarship her fees, that she does not lose amateur status.\n\nA.: Yes. So long as any student who wants to have fees paid for the opportunity can also get reimbursed. Athletes may only have reimbursement for actual and necessary costs associated with transportation, food, lodging and entry fees paid in connection with playing a contest. This opportunity may not be a \"benefit\" based on performance, e.g., making the varsity. See III-F of the Rules At A Glance. Keep in mind that camps and clinics including training (or other fees not associated with competition) must be paid in full (100 percent) by the student and/or parents.\n\nQ.: My varsity girls basketball team has asked if it is legal for a private party to purchase pink shoes for them to wear in a game for cancer fundraiser. My response is that if the private party wants to purchase them for any girl in our school who would be interested in them it would be ok. Just for the varsity girls basketball team would not be allowed. Am I correct? Then they said what if the private party donated the money to the basketball booster club and the club purchased the shoes for the team? My response was that I would not allow it because I viewed it as a way of skirting the rule. Am I correct there as well?\n\nA.: You are correct. If the private group (the booster club is not considered school) wanted to purchase the shoes and gift them to the school, the school could issue them as part of the uniform. At the end of the season, the school could sell them to the players for a reasonable (not outrageous) price or the school should keep them.\n\nQ.: We are having a conference showcase on January 16. All conference girls teams will play that day. I was going to have a couple of players from the corresponding boys teams compete in a 3 pt. shooting contest at half-time with coupons given from a local sub shop. Is that ok?\n\nA.: As you have described the contest, this would not meet our membership rules. Our Rules of Eligibility (page 37 of the WIAA Handbook) state a student becomes ineligible in a sport for the remainder of the season for competing in nonschool game, meet, or contest in the same sport during the season of practice or competition established by the school (ROE, VI-1-A). In addition, our membership rules of amateur status state: Accepts, receives and/or directs to another, reimbursement or award in any form of (a) salary, (b) cash, (c) merchandise of any kind or amount or (d) share of game or season proceeds, for achievement in athletics (ROE, IV-1-B-1, page 35 of the WIAA Handbook). A student may receive an award which is symbolic (nonmerchandise) in nature such as badges, certificates, cups, trophies, medals, banners, ribbons, pictures, event t-shirts, event hats, game balls, unattached emblems, letters, season highlight DVD or video, or other items of no intrinsic/utilitarian value. A student may not receive such merchandise items as shirts, jackets, sweaters, sweatshirts, jerseys, warm-ups, equipment, balls, duffel bags, backpacks, watches, rings, billfolds, coupons, gift certificates, e.g., regardless of their value. (See Bylaws, Article XI – Awards) (ROE, IV-1-b, page 35 of the WIAA Handbook).\n\n12-18-09\n\nQ.: Question on awards for representatives for our school for Wendy's High School Heisman. The two representatives from each high school receive a patch, a certificate, and a $10 gift certificate to Wendy's. I believe every school that has students fill out the forms receives one boys winner and one girls winner. Can the students accept the $10 gift certificate to Wendy's? Article IV, Section 1, B. 1.b reads that a student cannot receive such merchandise items as coupons, gift certificates, e.g., regardless of their value. Just wondering if I am taking this too literally.\n\nA.: No. For a HS athlete who has remaining eligibility – accepting, receiving and/or directing to another – any sort of cash and/or merchandise award – will be career ending. A student could participate in the contest – but is not able to accept or direct to school or any other person or place, the various cash awards which are mentioned.\n\nQ.: Our FBLA (school group) is offering a 50/50 raffle which involves a basketball toss at halftime. My question is can a student athlete direct his/her parent to accept any awards on their behalf? My guess is no as this would essentially be the same as the student athlete accepting the cash award.\n\nA.: The answer to your question is that a student athlete may NOT direct to another, reimbursement or award in any form (a) salary, (b) cash, merchandise of any kind or amount or (d) share of game or season proceeds, for achievement in athletics. If the 50/50 raffle is a random draw, the student-athlete may accept the prize. Some additional detail for random draw based contests: 1) You are always most wise to take a \"wide berth\" around amateur status concerns. 2) With respect to the \"lucky ticket holder\" and random draws - the rules say an athlete may not receive benefit as a result of \"being an athlete.\" On their ability, potential or performance as an athlete. Thus, you must always see the person whose name is drawn is the person that \"performs\" the skill. 3) When there is a legitimate contest where a student athlete's name is drawn by \"luck of the draw/serendipity\"... they did not receive opportunity or benefit because they were a talented player...but rather just by luck of the draw...and if they make the field goal or half-court shot e.g., they may keep the prize.\n\nQ.: This year, our team wore a small helmet sticker on the back of our helmets honoring a classmate of our seniors who had passed away in elementary school. In honor of that, the mother of the former classmate we had honored approached me about the possibility of her purchasing from our school the jerseys of our seniors, who were the classmates of her late son. She wanted to give them (as a gift) their home game jerseys that they had worn this year. I was wondering if this was acceptable. Would she have to wait and give it to them after they graduated from high school? She would like to give them to them for Christmas. I didn't want to do anything to hurt their eligibility.\n\nA.: Our membership rules pertaining to amateur status allow students to purchase uniforms from schools according to the procedures in place by the administration and board of education. If your school has a practice of allowing anyone and everyone the opportunity to purchase used uniforms, then the situation as you describe it may be done. If your school does not have a practice in place of allowing anyone and everyone the opportunity to purchase used uniforms, I suggest that you go to your administration and board of education to establish such a program in order to satisfy the amateur status rule.\n\nQ.: I looked under the \"awards\" information in the Handbook and it says that an athlete cannot receive clothing/goods for achievement. As far as a team goes, however, can a sport teams' fund-raised money be used to supplement all players purchase of something like polo shirts or warm-ups?\n\nA.: Reimbursement may only be for transportation, lodging, and food for competition from an outside group or school. A t-shirt is allowed, but polo shirts or warm ups are not.\n\nQ.: The owner of a pizza parlor has shown interested in making a donation to the program in return for advertising in the form of a half-court shot contest. For each home game, we would randomly select one fan in attendance and give them a chance at the \"X half court super shot\" (or something similar). Anyone who makes the shot wins a gift certificate to the restaurant, with the certificate being provided by the pizza parlor. If they have a banner, I would offer to place that in the gym, and a few announcements would be made during the game to plug the contest and the pizza parlor. Before I return the call and start talking about anything substantial like donation size, I want to make sure I have the green light here. Are there defined rules about how these donations/ads are handled? Can I be directly involved as a coach or is this something parents/boosters usually handle?\n\nA.: As described – this is OK provided everyone has the opportunity through random draw. For fundraisers and/or promotions associated with schools and school programs - if it is going to involve/include student athletes in scenarios where cash/merchandise can be won for performance of sport and/or skill of sport performance - the opportunity to do so must be associated with random draw/serendipitous opportunity. If everyone who buys a ticket gets the opportunity: 1) it must be open to any and all interested students and not redirected to athletes. 2) change the prizes to those items which a student can receive without amateur status peril (Bylaws Art. XI, Rules of Eligibility Art. IV). When looking at random draws: Be sure your number is broad and not skewed ('by just the JV players sitting in the bleacher's when lucky ticket's drawn'...e.g.); Have a good pool; be sure the person whose name is drawn – must be the person who shoots – or draw another name; do not allow for passing opportunity to another! (Opportunity is then no longer, random.) This may only be done during regular season games and not WIAA tournament games.\n\nQ.: Is it a violation for a booster club to pay for a Tri-State All-Star game fee (out-of-season) for a senior athlete?\n\nA.: No. So long as any student who wants to have fees paid for the opportunity can also get reimbursed. This opportunity may not be a \"benefit\" based on performance, e.g. making the varsity. See III-F of the Rules At A Glance. A student may be reimbursed actual and necessary costs associated with competing. This may include transportation, food, lodging, and entry fees.\n\nQ.: I have a niece that races go-carts in the summer and receives trophies, ribbons, etc. She also receives a payout at the end of the season. She is a freshman this year, and I am wondering if this will affect her amateur status. Will she be able to participate in school athletics?\n\nA.: What ROE Article IV provides is that (paraphrase): A student must be an amateur in ALL WIAA recognized sports in order to be eligible - in ANY WIAA sponsored sports. Thus – since the Association does not presently sponsor interscholastic go-carting, amateur status restrictions do not apply. Same as we do not sponsor lumberjack events, bass fishing, snowmobiling, motocross, BMX or rodeo, e.g., there are a number of school aged student athletes who do well in these non-WIAA recognized sporting events and suffer no peril when playing any WIAA offered interscholastic opportunity. Important: On the other hand however - even though student plays school football, basketball and baseball – and then while golfing with dad or buddy in summer event hits closest to the pin and wins a sleeve of balls, or sandwich at the club house, or a new driver, e.g., BIG PROBLEM/Amateur status violation! Even though the student does not take part in school golf program our members rule requires amateur adherence in ALL WIAA sports in order to be eligible in ANY WIAA sports.\n\nQ.: I am the site director for a hockey training facility. We are looking to sponsor a player of the week for one of the Web sites that covers hockey and already awards a player of the week. I was hoping that you could verify that this is not a violation of any rules and we will not get any players into trouble by sponsoring the player of the week. I was also wondering if it would be legal for us to give a free team or individual training session to each player that is honored with the player of the week award?\n\nA.: Sponsors can be used for a player of the week if done properly. We would be happy to review your plan to ensure no violations to amateur status for the athletes. As for an award or benefit, athletes may not receive discounts for merchandise or services unless offered to ALL students. Please refer to our rules on our Web site.\n\n10-23-09 Q.: Is there a way that a club can legally provide financial assistance to a family of an athlete who can not afford the full club program?\n\nA.: If a club wishes to reimburse, they may do so provided: ANY student who wants to have fees paid for the opportunity can also get reimbursed. This opportunity may not be a \"benefit\" based on performance,e.g. making the varsity. Athletes may be reimbursed actual and necessary costs associated with competition. So the answer to your question is yes - so long as the same opportunity to have club fees paid are available to any/all kids interested in playing club (an athlete may not receive benefit that is not available to all students). III-F and III-C of the Rules At A Glance relate to your question.\n\nQ.: I am the boys basketball coach at a member school. We are playing in a holiday tournament over Christmas break this year and are thinking about staying overnight in a hotel. I was wondering if it would be legal for our booster club to help pay some of the cost of the hotels or if the school would have to pick up the entire bill. I just want to make sure that we handle this correctly so we're not violating any rules.\n\nA.: This can get done – in either of a couple ways. Both \"work\" within our member's rules. Since our Bylaws and Amateur status rules provide that \"costs associated with competition\" can be reimbursed, the boosters could either pay the hotel bill directly or they could \"gift the school\" the necessary amount and the school could cut the check. There might even be some tax exempt benefit to the second way. But either way will work within the rules.\n\n9-18-09 Q.: Our volleyball team would like to go see another team play as a team. Can our coach pay for them to get into the game? Can they use money they raised though fundraisers? Or do they each have to pay their own way into the game?\n\nA.: As a form of entertainment, this is acceptable. It is viewed as \"group entertainment\" and permitted by the Bylaws and Rules of Eligibility. In addition, the payment can be from any source provided it is offered to everyone.\n\nQ.: Wanted to clear with you any potential conflict we could avoid with Web site video we are planning to shoot in September for our clinic. We are doing a 60 second video, and some 30 second clips of our clinic to describe who we are and what we do. We will be getting consents of any minors (see attached form) and they will not receive any type of financial reimbursement or remuneration. In addition, they will not have on any team logo gear. Is there anything else they or we should or would need to be cautious of as the last thing we would ever want to do is risk or even question ANY eligibility?\n\nA.: Thanks for checking in advance. III C of the Rules At A Glance addresses our member's amateur status rule. Being paid is only a portion of the member's provision. It also talks about \"being identified as an athlete\". There are three ways most common in considering a student having been identified – by text or spoken word, by apparel and by props. Apparel does not necessarily need to be just the school's uniform to convey the student is an athlete. Best advice, best practice is to use young adults – recent graduates – who have no high school eligibility remaining. A second (slightly less good recommendation) is to use younger/pre-high school students who may not yet be subject to WIAA membership provisions. Another best practice recommendation is to simply use actors – students who are not athletes at all – then you have far greater liberties. When I say it's best practice, it's because of our many experiences where one promotion stimulates another in a neighboring business and that business owner does not take the precautions you have contemplated, does not contact us as you have – and does harm to another member's students. Since we try to help all of our members we must maintain that awareness of the connection of all that goes on. If you would like us to preview your idea before you launch it we will be happy to do so. Otherwise, it is not possible for us to interpret compliance on something of this nature, sight/unseen.\n\nQ.: Can a business put a high school team logo(s) in their ads in support of their local team(s)?\n\nA.: With permission of the school due to licensing issues, you may do so. When athletes are involved, the rules are more strict.\n\n8-21-09 Q.: We own a hockey pro shop and would like to give a 10 percent discount to all high school hockey players in the area. Example: Player comes in to purchase a piece of equipment and they say they are on the ABC team, and we make sure they are on the roster that we received from their coach and then we give them the 10 percent. Is this okay to do?\n\nA.: Our membership rules require the athletes who participate in WIAA athletics be amateur athletes. In the situation which you stated, would be a violation of our rules. An athlete may not receive \"compensation or benefit, directly or indirectly, for the use of name, picture, and/or personal appearance, as an athlete. This includes but is not limited to: receiving free and/or reduced rates on equipment, aparel, camps/clinics/instruction and competitive opportunities that are not identical for all other participants.\" On another note, if the discount is offered to all students without the athlete performance, you could do this promotion.\n\nQ.: I have a couple returning starters who will be seniors that would like their jersey from last year to take senior pictures that are scheduled before the start of try-outs. Is this legal per WIAA?\n\nA.: As long as your school allows uniforms to be issued in the summertime and your athletes comply with the amateur status rules, this would not be a problem. There are times when photographers may wish to display pictures of students in athletic wear in their studio, etc. The students should not receive any cash or merchandise in the form of discounts in the cost of the picture, waiver of sitting fees, free wallet-size photos, and similar inducements if identified as an athlete or selected because of being an athlete. The athlete may not provide an endorsement in any promotional event for the photographer.\n\nQ.: Below you will find the text of an offer extended to our school that would use some of our athletes in a commercial. Would this be a problem regarding amateur status? \"I am part owner of a few food companies, one of which is called Al's Pizza. It is a newer product on the frozen pizza market. We are putting together a T.V. media campaign through three television stations. I would like the opportunity to talk with you about the chance of using some of your players in the commercial. In turn, I would donate some food for fund raising for the walking the path drive. We have the thought of running a football theme commercial as well as having weekly drawings for pep rallies at local high schools. If you could let me know if this is of interest to you I would like to sit down and work out the details and schedule for taping.\"\n\nA.: This is absolutely a problem. A violation of the amateur status would be career ending. You may wish to review the Rules at a Glance and the Amateur Status article from the Senior High Handbook.\n\n7-10-09\n\nQ.: Our radio stations are planning to create an Athlete of the Week award presented to a senior student beginning this fall and we would like to partner with a business in presenting a scholarship to an Athlete of the Year selected from all the weekly winners at the end of the school year. Is there any problem with this proposal?\n\nA.: Our member's amateur status provisions are outline in Art. III-C of the Rules At A Glance. To begin, WIAA rules do not prevent a student from receiving a college scholarship. We recommend the funds be paid directly to the student's school at the start of their second semester of college; but what you decide to do for a senior who has graduated - is really up to you. One of the most common perils we encounter in some promotions is the student \"appearing\" to be endorsing a business, service, product or plan. This often happens unintentionally. We think it's a good idea to have the school's AD preview and approve of any promotional materials that might include the student and/or announcement of the student's selection.If we receive copies of the piece, we are also glad to work with businesses to try to help avoid any negatives from arising from what you are intending to be a good thing.\n\n5-26-09\n\nQ.: Our local recreation department is starting a men's softball league this summer and the director contacted me with a question. He was wondering if high school athletes are allowed to participate? There will be a cash payout to the winning team, but nothing to individuals.\n\nA.: Student athletes could enter the league and play. They may not, however, accept, receive or direct to another cash or merchandise awards. There are a number of HS athletes who enter pro-am events – with potentials for hundreds of thousands of dollars in prizes, but they make it clear they are playing for fun/the experience...and will not accept, receive or direct to another – money for playing or winning.\n\n4-10-09\n\nQ.: I read Article IV Amateur Status, Section 1B, 1) b. My question is this: I have some track t-shirts that I received at no cost. I thought of giving them away to track athletes, one at a time per week. (i.e., an athlete who never misses practice, or an athlete who demonstrates a wonderful attitude during practice). My AD suggested that I better check to see if this is OK.\n\nA.: No Problem. Both in the Bylaws, Art. XI (p. 29) and in the Rules of Eligibility – as you have identified; our members have determined a T-shirt to be an acceptable award for athletes to receive.\n\n3-27-09\n\nQ.: Where do students stand regarding the Wendy's Heisman award (recognizing athletic, academic and citizenship) and \"amateur status?\" Judging according to the Wendy's Web site is: Students are judged based on their academic achievements, community service involvement, and athletic accomplishments. Up until last year, schools identified a male and female nominee, much like we do with the WIAA scholar athlete. Last year, Wendy's changed the nomination process to allow any student to \"nominate themselves\" online. Wendy's then selects one male/one female to continue on to the state and then national levels…at least this is how I understand it. The male/female selected is sent a $10 gift card. I'm going to go with \"not acceptable\" as this is in effect a cash award to be used at Wendy's with at least 1/3 of the criteria based on athletic achievement.\n\nA.: Amateur status is addressed in both Rules at a Glance and AEIB. For a HS athlete who has remaining eligibility – accepting, receiving and/or directing to another – any sort of cash and/or merchandise award – will be career ending. A student could participate in the contest – but is not able to accept or direct to school or any other person or place, the various cash awards which are mentioned.\n\nQ.: Our physicians of the Bone & Joint Clinic provide volunteer sideline coverage for various sports in the area. Is it acceptable for us to take photos of physicians rendering care to student athletes and then displaying such photos in our clinic office as artwork? I understand we would need to get a photo consent from the minor athlete's parent, but I need to ensure we would not violate WIAA regulations.\n\nA.: What you are proposing could hold the potential for a student to lose their high school eligibility for the balance of their school career. WIAA amateur status rules are described in III-C of the Rules At A Glance. There is one strategy by which you could accomplish this promotion yet not adversely affect the students you photographed – if you developed a \"calendar file\" of photos and always used this spring's graduates in next year's promotions. When a student has completed their HS eligibility, there is no WIAA recourse. Though there is no peril for graduated athletes, I will caution you that there is still potential peril for our members - if/when other businesses copy your idea - but fail to check in advance and don't recognize you are only using graduate students - and they use underclassmen.\n\nQ.: I am the head boy's soccer coach at a member high school. I have some 8th graders coming up next year who are Hmong and are said to be good players. I don't know yet if they play in Hmong leagues, but my concern is if they plan on playing in any Hmong soccer tournaments, which as far as I can tell, all offer cash prizes to the winners. It is my impression that under Article IV-1-B, there is no way they can participate in such a tournament without permanently forfeiting their amateur status. Is there any circumstance where they could?\n\nA.: Yes. The biggest challenge is to reach out and educate the students and the ELDERS! The amateur status rule does not prevent a student from competing in events where cash/merchandise prizes might be offered - after all, many summer softball, golf and other events have cash/merchandise prizes. The rule simply provides that a WIAA student athlete may not \"accept, receive or direct to another any cash or merchandise award.\" So the key is to educate the appropriate individuals so that the students and event hosts understand - how it is the kids can play - as well as what must be done and under what conditions in order to protect their eligibility. They must understand that if they accept/receive - even indirectly - or direct to another (cash or merchandise) and then play the season for you and it is discovered later, all the games they played in would be as an ineligible player and those contests would be forfeited. In addition to the amateur status, be sure to talk with your students about the nonschool competition rules.\n\n2-13-09\n\nQ.: As part of a promotional brochure we have put together for a local business, we have included a picture of one of our employees playing \"soft toss.\" He is a high school athlete. He was not paid any money for the use of the picture. Have we violated any WIAA rules?\n\nA.: Sight unseen difficult to say with certainty - but potentially, yes. See III-C of the Rules At A Glance. If student is an undergraduate and has hopes of playing any more WIAA sports during this school year - Do not use this photo until you have brought it past the school's AD. An athlete can be identified as an athlete – by text, by apparel, by props. An amateur status violation is career ending for a high school student. If you're looking for a marketing plan, keep a calendar file of photos and always use this spring's graduates/seniors, in next year's promotions. Lastly, you should always consult with the local athletic director on matters that could affect school sport eligibility.\n\nQ.: Our basketball club is interested in sponsoring an all-star game for players in our conference. The game would only involve seniors that have finished playing their high school basketball career. The club asked me to check into a few things for them so I am forwarding this info on to you. If they want to play the game sometime after the State Tournament, is there a deadline as to when they can play the game during the school year? I believe seniors are OK to play even if they are spring sport athletes, correct? They also gave me a copy of a \"Q and A\" from sometime past concerning all-star games. The Q and A references Art. IV, a question concerning this article is the following: Can a high school coach only coach a team if none of the players on either team are out for a spring sport?\n\nA.: Yes. This is very clear from the Bylaws Art. IV which stems from our members fundamental opposition to all-star events; which they had viewed as exploitive of students. There is not a deadline for seniors to participate in the game as you have proposed.\n\n12-12-08\n\nQ.: I've got a couple questions that are somewhat similar. 1) A local committee coordinates our city field. They've requested pictures of our team playing there so that they can put them on their field website. Is this OK? My impression so far is that they want to have a photo section that shows various pictures of the many teams that use the field. Not sure if they are selling advertising on this site to outside businesses. Would that be a factor in determining acceptability? 2) We're doing a fundraiser where our team sells cards full of coupons to local businesses. Is it OK to put pictures of our athletes on such a card?\n\nA.: 1) Can't say with any certainty. What's on the site, how the photos are used is essential to know and see before being able to say. Selling advertising is only one of the concerns in this type of idea. If they wish to do a mock up/prototype, we will be glad to proof. 2) ABSOLUTELY not. Team logo and/or schedule would not be a problem.\n\nQ.: Can a booster club at a school help pay a fee that an athlete has to pay to be on a club volleyball team?\n\nA.: Athletes may be reimbursed actual and necessary costs associated with competition. So the answer to your question is yes - so long as the same opportunity to have club fees paid are available to any/all kids interested in playing club (an athlete may not receive benefit that is not available to all students). III-F and III-C of the Rules At A Glance relate to your question.\n\nQ.: You mentioned something about a sport team losing eligibility over an endorsement for a pizza parlor at the AD meeting, could I get some more information in terms of what happened that caused them to lose their eligibility.\n\nA.: To begin, a player of the week, team of the week, e.g., do not need to be troublesome. The recognition may be afforded without peril. But school administration and coaches must have oversight. The sponsoring business should have some moral/ethical perspectives as well. In the case I referred to at WADA, an area TV station and an area pizza vendor - under the guise of selecting a \"team of the week\" picked several area HS's over the course of the fall season and when the team was notified they were team of the week and would receive a pizza dinner for the team (which can be allowed – Bylaws Art. XI, Sect 2A). The pizza arrived but so did a video camera which was given to the students. The students were asked to shoot several minutes of video which was then placed on the internet. The videos we reviewed were ripe with product placement and with what could only be seen as product promotion/endorsement and NOT seen as the businesses purely/simply endorsing, promoting the students. What appeared on the internet was seen only as an advertisement for the pizza co. and an exploitation of kids. With some education of students, oversight by coaches and AD's and the business promotions staff a lot of distress and a year of probation could have been avoided.\n\nQ.: A local restaurant has offered to feed our football team free of charge this Wednesday. I looked at the Handbook to make sure this was not an amateur status violation and was not sure after reading it over a few times. Could you please clarify? We have some kids that are involved in wrestling and basketball. The last thing I want to do is jeopardize those seasons.\n\nA.: So long as it's voluntary, not attached to some other \"promotion\" and is available to any on the team interested in attending - you can allow this. See Sr. High Handbook, Art. XI, Sect, 2A (p. 29).\n\nQ.: I have an athlete that will be participating at the AAU national CC race in Virginia and the USATF national CC race in Alabama. Her mother would like to solicit sponsors to help defray the costs of these trips. Does that endanger the runner, a junior, of her amateur status?\n\nA.: On something like this I recommend caution. A student can be reimbursed actual and necessary costs associated with competition. That might be achieved without peril through solicitation. Be certain then that the eligibility is not compromised by the student turning around and promoting/endorsing the sponsors and contributors. Of course, the school may also have policy and/or opinion on whether you wish to permit private student solicitation of area business. See Rules At A Glance: Art. III-F and III-C.\n\nQ.: We have a group that would like to run some halftime contests where gift certificates could be awarded. Are there any restrictions outlined by the WIAA? Does the WIAA have any statements regarding advertising at games?\n\nA.: Halftime contests is a broad description. They can take on many forms. Some may be specific skill of sport performance, others like an egg or water balloon toss - having nothing to do with skill of sport performance. Depending on how a student is provided access to the opportunity - whether by random draw, or by simply purchase a ticket and everyone gets a chance to play, as well as what a student will be doing in the contest will determine what a student athlete might be allowed to receive for winning. Of course for adults and non- students, WIAA rules and amateur status provisions have no bearing. In addition, what you choose to do during your own school's regular season will otherwise be largely up to you. WIAA tournament procedures identify that gimmicks and fundraisers are not allowed as part of WIAA tournament events. Here is some discussion about random draw based contests for some additional detail. 1. You are always most wise to take a \"wide berth\" around amateur status concerns. 2. With respect to the \"lucky ticket holder\" and random draws - the rules say an athlete may not receive benefit as a result of \"being an athlete\"... on their ability, potential or performance as an athlete. Thus, you must always see the person whose name is drawn is the person that \"performs\" the skill. 3. Then there is a legitimate contest where a student athlete's name is drawn by \"luck of the draw/serendipity\"... they did not receive opportunity or benefit because they were a talented player...but rather just buy luck of the draw...and if they make the field goal or half court shot e.g., they may keep the prize.\n\nQ.: I have a question regarding the distribution of t-shirts and sweatshirts at a basketball league in which non-basketball players play in the winter. The league consists of teams from three communities. None of these players play basketball at the high school, but most participate in other WIAA sponsored sports. They simply join this winter league and play at church gyms within the communities. Is it acceptable for the winning team and second place team in the tournament at the end of the season to receive a sweatshirt (first place) and a t-shirt (second place)? I have read the \"Amateur Status\" requirements and stipulations, but am still uncertain.\n\nA.: T-shirts have been identified by the members as acceptable for a student to receive. Sweatshirts have not been approved. See Bylaws, Art. XI, Sect. 1A and Sect. 3 for specific text and references. (HB p. 29) Also: What ROE Article IV provides is that (paraphrase): A student must be an amateur in ALL WIAA recognized sports in order to be eligible - in ANY WIAA sponsored sports. Thus, since the Association does not presently sponsor interscholastic bowling amateur status restrictions do not apply. Same as we do not sponsor lumberjack events, bass fishing, snowmobiling, motocross, BMX or rodeo, e.g., - there are a number of school-aged student athletes who do right well for themselves in these non-WIAA recognized sporting events and suffer no peril when playing any WIAA offered interscholastic opportunity. Important: On the other hand, however, even though student plays school football, basketball and baseball – golfing with dad or buddy in summer event – hits closest to the pin and wins a sleeve of balls, or sandwich at the club house, or a new drive, e.g. – BIG PROBLEM/Amateur status violation! Because even though the student does not take part in school golf program our members rule requires amateur adherence in ALL WIAA sports in order to be eligible in ANY WIAA sports.\n\n10-24-08\n\nQ.: We will be hosting a varsity volleyball tournament and may need to use JV players as line judges. My question is, is it allowable to pay them as we would an adult line judge?\n\nA.: Yes. A student may be employed and you may compensate them. The only potential for assertion of inappropriateness comes when student is picked because they are the 'best' jv player(s). Opportunity for the job should be available to any interested, and selected based on knowledge and ability to perform the work, not based on athletic abilities.\n\n9-19-08\n\nQ.: We have a girl who is an incoming freshmen that participated in the Hershey track meet this summer and qualified for their national meet. She attended the meet, but her trip was paid for by Hershey. Is this a violation of amateur status?\n\nA.: No, not a violation – provided the student did not accept or receive any other unacceptable awards. ROE, Art. IV (Amateur Status) provides in section B-1a. \" Actual and necessary reimbursement for transportation, food and lodging paid in connection with playing a contest shall not be regarded as a violation.\"\n\nQ.: As students begin registering for school and sports, three questions have come up that we would like some feed back on. We have a couple students who are not able to afford our sports fees ($60 per sport). They do meet the criteria for free and reduced lunches. The questions are: 1) Can the sport booster club cover their fees for them or would this take away their amateur status? 2) Can the school waive the fees for those that qualify for free and reduced lunches without the athlete losing eligibility? 3) If students do not meet the qualifications for free and reduced programs, can their fees be waived or paid by a booster club?\n\nA.: 1) Yes, so long as the same opportunity is provided to all students who qualify and are interested in participating. We view this as costs associated with competition. The boosters should gift the school the necessary dollars that would meet this need. 2) Yes, same caveat as #1. Some schools have this policy. 3) Would advise extreme caution in that direction and discourage consideration unless all students are to have fees waived.\n\nQ.: I work for a television station that covers the Duluth/Superior area. We do an athlete of the week segment on Sundays, and my news director wants to change the format of that segment to include giving the student a plaque/trophy. Will this affect that student's amateur status? There will be no other prizes/incentives, just a plaque recognizing that student athlete as the Fox 21 Northern Star.\n\nA.: Our members identify a trophy and/or a plaque to be an acceptable award which a Wisconsin HS student athlete may receive. Please See III-C of the Rules At A Glance.\n\n8-15-08\n\nQ.: A local business wants to donate the t-shirts I intended to purchase for the 15-year old summer baseball coach winning the Teen League State Tournament. Is there a violation there? The t-shirts would not mention the name of the business. Also, can a parent buy those same players a key chain celebrating their win of the same tournament?\n\nA.: A t-shirt is an acceptable/allowable award. At present, a key chain is not. See III-C of the Rules At A Glance.\n\nQ.: My daughter is going to be a senior this fall and she and two other HS girls have been asked to play on a co-ed slow pitch softball team that is going to be in a tournament in two weeks. They are the only players on the team that are still in high school. I have been told that they may play on this team as long as they DO NOT accept any prize money that may be given out at the end of the tournament even if the other members of the team accept the money. Is this correct?\n\nA.: Essentially, yes. That's correct information. See III-C of the Rules At A Glance. A student may not accept, receive or direct to another - cash or merchandise award. Would recommend you also discuss this with your school's AD.\n\nQ.: I am from a large city, and I am a senior in high school. I was emancipated from my parents and now I live on my own. However, life in the city is hard, and I decided that I am going to move to a small-town school. Before I actually do this, I just wanted to know if I would be able to play basketball in the new school if I make the team?\n\nA.: Answer to your question is \"no.\" The rules our members have put in place provide that whether an adult or not, a student is eligible in the district where his or her parents reside, full-time in their primary residence.\n\n7-18-08\n\nQ.: We have a question regarding a job that my son was offered. He was given a position through the Park and Rec Dept. that involves giving 4-6 year-olds tennis lessons as part of a park program. He plays on a varsity high school tennis team in the spring. Is there any conflict?\n\nA.: No Problem. Students can be employed in this manner – by rec depts. YMCA, country clubs, aquatic centers, etc. They just can not be self-employed in giving sport skills instruction.\n\nQ.: Our football team would like to take a picture during the first week of practice in the fall and make a poster of the picture. I know there is not a problem with this, but can they put advertisements on the posters to help pay for the cost of the posters? If they were to make a profit from the sale of posters, would this be a violation of the WIAA policies?\n\nA.: It's a little difficult to say with certainty on this one – sight unseen. Fundamentally when you look at a poster – what's it conveying? So long as it's crystal clear that the local businesses are supporting team, school program – it's generally not been seen as a problem. If/when the poster imagery is less distinct – and seems to leave the suggestion the athletes are endorsing product or business – that is a problem. Speaking generally, it has not been seen as a problem when the local businesses who support the team and the poster are identified – with thanks and gratitude from the QB Club, and those businesses typically are identified by name or logo on the bottom/around the margins of the poster. If, however, the promotion and endorsements were seen as to be gratuitous, the line of business \"endorsing/promoting\" the school the team the kids was no longer clear and it appeared as much that the athletes were endorsing the product, the business or service that is a problem. If the posters are sold and proceeds placed in a booster or school account as a fund raising initiative – that has not presented amateur status concerns for the athletes. We have a few examples of posters on file that created problems for the athletes appearing in them. If you wish us to preview your poster in advance of it going to print – will do so gladly – if provided enough time.\n\nQ.: One of our baseball parents called me today with a question regarding them being contacted by a sports management firm. The letter to them indicated that their son may be considered for the baseball draft next week. Is it OK for them to contact this firm to get more information?\n\nA.: There is absolutely no problem with a student and his parents speaking to a sports agent or firm - or a lawyer of their own choosing. Certainly, advise the student to not sign any contract with an agent or professional sport team until they're done with school sports.\n\nQ.: If a high school player plays baseball for an amateur baseball team in the summer, and the team he plays for receives prize money for playing in a tournament, does this take away the player's amateur status? He is the only player of high school age and does not directly receive the money.\n\nA.: See III-C of the Rules At A Glance. Playing a game / event where cash or merchandise prizes were offered - in/of itself would not make a student ineligible. There are a number of HS student golfers, e.g., who play in pro-am events where significant prize money is offered. The student can compete - but just for competition's sake. The student and parents might wish to take some added measures to educate and create awareness that the student is an amateur and may not accept, receive or direct to another, cash or merchandise awards.\n\n5-1-08\n\nQ.: I'm on the organizing committee for a 5K/10K run in early August (Aug. 9 this year). In the past, we've given ribbons and trophies to the top finishers - this year we're considering gift certificates to athletic/running specialty stores in the area. If a high school athlete were given such an award, would that jeopardize their WIAA eligibility?\n\nA.: Answer to your question is \"yes\" - for a student athlete to receive cash or merchandise awards for achievement, performance and/or potential as an athlete would by rule, be a career ending violation. (Obviously, since your event is held Aug. 9 and cross country season does not begin until the 18th, students who will be joining their school's team could otherwise take part in your event without peril.)\n\nQ.: Is there any issue with one of our high school junior ball players getting paid to work a basketball camp that we host for kids in grade school and middle school?\n\nA.: 1) Students can be employed – just not self-employed in the area of private sport skill instruction. 2) About the only peril (amateur status related) would be if the one ball player was given preferential treatment/access to the opportunity; one not available to other interested students to be aware of and to apply to. 3) Remember; schools are only able to sponsor camps/clinics in the summer.\n\nQ.: Couple of questions for you: 1) We are hosting a cross country meet next fall and would like to open it up for a middle school race prior to the JV and varsity races. Is there anything that would prohibit us from doing that considering that we are only a 9-12 private school? 2) Is there a form that needs to be completed for participation in a 4-team basketball tournament held in Winona, MN for our participation? I was unable to locate one on the website. If not, what is the process?\n\nA.: I am not able to see any obvious peril if your school provided a non-varsity and/or middle school race opportunity to those schools whose varsity teams will be taking part in your invite. With respect to interstate competition; there is no form. Forward the following to the event sponsor/host and get rsvp back to me (these are the fundamental elements governing interstate competition as outlined on p. 27 Sr. High Handbook, Bylaw Art. II, Sect. 5G). Will simplify and summarize: Does this event require NFHS sanctions? If so, has the event received sanctioning? Are participating schools 9-12 high schools? (no post secondary/prep academies). Are all schools members of their state association? (In this case, with only four schools involved, disregard the first two points – the event would NOT require sanctioning.) Also, include the dates the event will be held.\n\nQ.: If a softball team plays out-of-state (non-bordering state) and plays two games in two days is this in violation of 6f of the softball spring season regulations? Would we consider this an event rather than two competitions?\n\nA.: No, this would not violate season regulations if it was your school's only out-of-state event. Played on consecutive days of the same/single trip, we would consider this all part of the 'one event' – much like playing several contests over 'spring break.'\n\n4-11-08\n\nQ.: I am getting the odd request for donations for raffles, silent auctions, etc., for signed stuff from the players, such as a signed t-shirt from the state champions. Is this a violation? I would like clarification.\n\nA.: Kids signing a t-shirt. signing a stick etc., if YOU (the SCHOOL) wishes to make such available - that is your prerogative. We do not presume such to be an endorsement or promotion in/of itself. It's names on a t-shirt. Watch out for requests to have team and/or athletes make personal appearances at such fund raising events/promotions - regardless the cause.\n\nQ.: There are parents of middle/elementary students in our community that would like to pay a varsity basketball player to provide one-on-one instruction on a weekly basis this summer....any violation here?\n\nA.: Yes. Violates amateur status provisions. Career ending. See Sr. High Handbook, p. 34, Rules of Eligibility, Art. IV, Section B. To paraphrase; a student can be employed - but not self-employed in sport skills instruction.\n\n3-28-08\n\nQ.: We have two junior high volleyball coaching positions in the district. The only interest is from a junior volleyball player and a graduating senior player. Is there a high school eligibility problem for the junior if she is paid the coaching amount of $350. Or for the graduating senior if she is paid as well?\n\nA.: A student can be employed. Provided these job opportunities were posted/made known and available to all interested students - if the two students you've identified rose to the surface through what may be described as a normal search process and you offered them the job - we are not able to see any obvious peril for the students being employed by your district in this manner.\n\n2-8-08\n\nQ.: Can a student-athlete receive cash for participation in a bowling tournament? I have read through the amateur status section and am still unclear as it says they may not accept any cash or merchandise for achievement in athletics.\n\nA.: In a word, \"yes\". What ROE Article IV provides is that (paraphrase): A student must be in amateur in ALL WIAA recognized sports in order to be eligible - in ANY WIAA sponsored sports. Thus – since the Association does not presently sponsor interscholastic bowling amateur status restrictions do not apply. Same as we do not sponsor lumberjack events, bass fishing, snowmobiling, motocross, bmx or rodeo, e.g., there are a number of school aged student athletes who do well in these non-WIAA recognized sporting events and suffer no peril when playing any WIAA offered interscholastic opportunity. Important: On the other hand however - Even though student plays school football, basketball and baseball – and then while golfing with dad or buddy in summer event hits closest to the pin and wins a sleeve of balls, or sandwich at the club house, or a new driver, e.g., BIG PROBLEM / Amateur status violation! Even though the student does not take part in school golf program our members rule requires amateur adherence in ALL WIAA sports in order to be eligible in ANY WIAA sports.\n\n1-18-08\n\nQ.: Our marketing department has just released some new commercials for our health care facility. They have a picture of a football player with a WIAA high school jersey with a number in the commercial. This individual is actually a university student (non-athlete, non-paid actor). Are we violating any WIAA rules using the WIAA HS jersey in the commercial?\n\nA.: Answer is no. Whether paid or unpaid - A college student has no high school eligibility. He is not a full-time student at a member school and subsequently, is not subject to WIAA rules of eligibility. You were wise to use an actor – we are happy for that – but I am confused and question only the timing of seeking clarification as evidently the commercials have already been aired?\n\nQ.: A parent attended our WIAA eligibility presentation a few weeks back. His son is interested in participating in video game tournaments. Tournaments are large and small, individual and team with varying cash and material prizes. I am not sure this is considered a sport or even falls under WIAA rules. He has the potential to be sponsored by various companies as he progresses. He is working on local and national sponsorship right now. Or is it like modeling or working a job. Are there restrictions on his competition? What prizes can he accept and maintain his WIAA eligibility?\n\nA.: To paraphrase; WIAA amateur status text provides that 'A student must be an amateur in all WIAA sanctioned athletics in order to be eligible in any WIAA sanctioned interscholastic athletic competition.' Since we do not create and/or sponsor tournament opportunity, create season regulation and etc., for video gaming, our amateur status provision does not apply – even to NBA JAM or Madden football. This same interpretation is provided and applicable when asked about bowling, motocross, BMX, snowmobile racing, lumberjack olympics, rodeo and bass pro, etc. The amateur status rule would be enforced in an event such as an iron man triathlon! We do sponsor swim and running competition.\n\nQ.: I have a young lady from our school who qualified as a Wendy' s Heisman Candidate from our school. She did not receive state level recognition. Wendy's sent her a $10 gift card for being the recognized school candidate. Can she accept the $10 gift card?\n\nA.: No. Must be returned – if student is intending to participate in interscholastic athletics now or in the future. If not returned, student will be ineligible for the remainder of her HS career. Advise student to bring to you – you return, along with note and request response from Wendy's confirming they've received returned prize.\n\n12-21-07\n\nQ.: Is it acceptable for several students to accept monetary support from local businesses to pay some of or all of the costs associated with a club sport (club soccer) during the off-season? Or does this threaten their amateur status? Apparently, three or four students want to play in a club soccer league in Milwaukee (I am assuming during the winter) which costs $900. They are wondering if local businesses or individuals can assist in paying some of or all of this fee. Does this threaten their amateur status?\n\nA.: Simple answer is no, not automatically a violation. This has unsavory potentials; e.g., when your kid gets money, because he's 'pretty good,' but when my kid asks is denied...arguably in that scenario this becomes amateur status rooted – benefit/perk, based on your success/celebrity as athlete. Do you really wish to promote local business being hit yet again for personal interests of this kind? Help get kids a job. But the essence remains, 'no, not a violation out of hand.'\n\nQ.: On page 34 of the Senior High Handbook (Article IV, Section I of the rules of eligibility it lists those items that are permitted and those which are prohibited. One of the items that is prohibited is \"balls\". Then it refers to Bylaws Article XI-Awards. On page 29, (Article XI-awards, section 1A of the Bylaws) it lists \"game balls\" as a permitted award. So that I can clarify this to my committee members, is there a distinction between \"balls\" and \"game balls\" or is this a typo?\n\nA.: A 'game ball' is typically 'awarded' post game for 'special' performance/achievement/extra-special contributions. Made to team for \"tonight's victory,\" sometimes signed by all team mates and coaches. Most typically ends up on a shelf or case, POWERFUL when presented by team/coaches. Game balls awarded in this manner, are seen the same as trophy only more special. But nonetheless - a 'symbolic' award when given in this manner. Obviously, there are times when my skill and/or celebrity as an athlete could see me presented with a ball or balls as product and/or perk and/or benefit, e.g., \"since winning regional golf/tennis last spring, now every time I go to the club I get a free bucket or bin of balls.\" This would be a big problem. Hitting closest to the pin or longest drive, I won a summer long supply of golf balls. Again, nothing symbolic in this. It's product/merchandise based, won for performance/achievement as an athlete. For making the winning basket, the local dealer gave me a brand new basketball of my own, just to shoot around with.\n\nQ.: Someone wants to buy basketball shoes for our three boys teams. Is this legal? Red flags just went up when they told me.\n\nA.: Shoes – just given to athletes - would be an amateur status violation. If the benefactor wished to 'gift' the school district and in turn you wished to issue shoes to your teams, you could do that. They then become school property issued just like shoulder pads and should be collected and reissued or collected and discarded following the season in accordance with school board policy. Also see Art. IV, Rules of Eligibility p. 34, Section 1B-1c. I would also recommend there be administrative discussion on the topic from a gender equity perspective – is there anyone who will provide the same for the girls?\n\n12-06-07\n\nQ.: My 10th grade advisor is running a John Madden Play Station football tournament. Can he give cash away to athletes as a prize?\n\nA.: Technically and so long as the event is open/available to any/every student, 'sure' – a video game is not performance/achievement in athletics. We would not regard it as a \"best practice\" by any stretch, however.\n\n10-27-07\n\nQ.: I have a question concerning shoe discounts for students and teams. Am I correct to assume that the following is allowable and not an amateur status violation: A vendor wishes to provide a team discount to players if so many pairs of shoes are purchased by a team. In this case the school buys the shoes, pays the vendor and collects the money from the players that make the team. Otherwise any discount from the vendor would have to be available to any student in the school population.\n\nA.: I do not like this model – I prefer the model where every kid who goes out - gets the discount just for going out. Or better yet, every kid and teacher in school can show up in the cafeteria Thurs. from 4-6 ... and will get XX percent school/student discount. In years past, schools used to provide basketball shoes to teams. Just like providing shoulder pads/helmets. As I understand the question – this is not that model. You/the school is not purchasing to own - and then issue the shoes and collect at end of season. You will re-sell at a reduced price – a price not available to any/every interested student – just to those who make the team. From that perspective then at least – the discount in the model IS performance based...a benefit afforded only for those making the team. Would not advise could not support.\n\nQ.: We would like to recognize students that participate in three sports by giving them a t-shirt. The only requirement would be that they were out for three sports the previous year. Is this legal?\n\nA.: Yes - no problem. HB p. 29 - Bylaws Art. XI-1A.\n\n9-21-07\n\nQ.: Can students who receive free or reduced lunch have participation fees waived without risking eligibility?\n\nA.: Yes – Amateur status provisions allow students to be \"reimbursed\" for costs directly associated with competition. When a school 100 percent and uniformly waives fees for students on free/reduced – and with no bearing on grade or team level..or not based on athletic ability/potential/performance, we consider it from the perspective that they are costs associated with the school's competition season.\n\nQ.: We had a senior high school girl get a hole in one at our Booster Hockey Golf Outing. Can she accept the prize, a two-year lease of a car, or would that impact her high school eligibility this year?\n\nA.: Answer's \"no.\" Student may not accept, receive or direct to another....a cash or merchandise award ... Would end her high school career. See Rules At A Glance 2C.\n\nQ.: I am a member of the largest running organization in Wisconsin with about 1500 members. We have an interest in starting a program to help disadvantaged high school athletes who are involved in cross-country or track and are in need of shoes/equipment. My initial thought is to run the program through the high school coaches and the local shoe/sport equipment stores; perhaps giving the coaches forms that they could fill out and give to the athletes to use at local stores to purchase the needed equipment. Our organization already has a working relationship with many of the shoe stores in southeastern Wisconsin so I don't believe it would take much convincing to get their participation. The stores could collect the forms and \"cash\" them in through our organization. Am certainly open to other suggestions but I believe the heart of this program would need to be the coaches themselves because they would need to identify those in need and provide them with the necessary forms.\n\nA.: There may be a way to achieve your interests and ends without peril to a student athlete. It is not the course you've initially identified. But an alternate path might deliver the results you hope to achieve, nonetheless. WIAA Amateur status provisions prohibit a student from accepting/receiving cash and/or merchandise. Simple plan you might consider, is to contact member school ADMINISTRATION. Have them identify those students who receive free/reduced lunch and if you wish to GIFT THE SCHOOL with cash or coupon – for them to use/administer in providing for there students as they then determine, your desired result might be achieved without peril to student, member school, school coach and with no unintended backlash toward your organization's intended generosity. Always remember – these are the school's programs, not any one coaches.\n\n8-20-07\n\nQ.: I received an email from a minor league baseball club. They are hosting a \"Hometown Champions\" night and are wondering if our athletes would participate. Athletes would be encouraged to wear their uniforms and school apparel to the game that night and would be announced on the field during pregame over the PA system. All individuals affiliated with our championship winning teams would receive a discounted two for one ticket deal. It appears to me that this would violate WIAA rules of eligibility, since the athletes would be receiving a discount based upon athletic achievement. [Article IV - Amateur Status - sections 1, 3, & 4] Is this interpretation correct?\n\nA.: It is the two for one promotion that prompts me to say 'NO can do\" on this one as it is presently outlined. If the club wished to provide complimentary admission to your team/coaches and the school wished to say yes to that, it would be OK. As per Bylaws (p. 29) Art. XI, Section 2B: When a team is honored/recognized and/or go to an event of this kind, as a group, it is viewed as \"group entertainment' and permitted by the Bylaws and Rules of Eligibility. When the business uses the students with two for one promotions to try to get business in the door, students are not able to take part in that.\n\nQ.: Our local hospital/athletic trainer wants to give each athlete their own water bottle. If I understand the rules correctly, they cannot, unless, they offer one to EVERY student in school. Correct? Can the hospital donate the bottles to the school, and then the school distributes as they deem appropriate (give to athletes only)? Can the hospital donate the bottles to the booster club, who then donates to athletes?\n\nA.: Best direction is for hospital to 'gift the school'- then you can provide to teams as you determine need by 'team/program'. Or - 'every student who goes out for a sport' should receive a water bottle. Is also acceptable - thereby it IS a benefit available to any/every student - so long as the student goes out for a sport.\n\nQ.: Can we have player awards that are sponsored? For instance can we have a \"Culvers Player of the Week?\" The student would only receive recognition on our site and possibly a certificate of recognition. No gift or anything like that.\n\nA.: Player of the game, the week, ... team of the week sorts of recognition has 'always' been allowed. As you describe - there would be no peril for student. Students can receive certificates of achievement/of recognition (never cash or merchandise, or coupons for such). So long as when we look and see the business, product, service is 100 percent 'endorsing' student, team, school...seldom is there a problem.\n\n7-13-07\n\nQ.: I am an athletic trainer – at my facility we have a training program and would like to roll the program out at a reduced price to employees and their immediate family members. There is some hesitation that if a WIAA athlete enrolls at the reduced price, that athlete may violate WIAA rules. We are offering the program to all employees, so all students would be eligible for the same discount, whether an athlete or not. If I could get something in writing either supporting or denying this proposal, it would greatly help.\n\nA.: An 'employee/family discount' would not ordinarily be viewed as an amateur status violation – should one of the children in an employee's family also be a HS student athlete. At least not if is as straight forward as described; i.e., available to every employee and all of the children/spouses etc. The 'benefit' of the discount was not/did not come as a result of the student 'being an athlete' or due to performance or potential as an athlete...but rather, simply because \"mom or dad works there.\"\n\nQ.: I have a potential donor that is interested in setting up a need based scholarship for students returning to our private high school, but they would like to base one of the criteria for awarding the scholarship on athletic participation during the previous year. My concern is that while we may be able to award a scholarship to a student coming into our school based on music or art or science interest, if we start to allow scholarships to be awarded based on interest in athletics, will that fall under the recruitment ruling?\n\nA.: Your assessment and concerns are right on the mark. Financial aid that has anything to do with athletic interests, potential, ability or performance - would render the student ineligible for their entire HS career and place your school in a status of severe non-compliance. You may identify a wide range of requirements/qualifications to consider - but none of the criteria may relate to WIAA interscholastic athletics. BE EXTREMELY VIGILANT OF THIS. We have had experience in this area where zealous booster members have caused great distress for members on occasion.\n\n5-4-07\n\nQ.: I would like to approach a local photographer to ask them to donate a complimentary photo for each of our honored student-athletes. Would we run into a problem giving each recipient a 5x7 photo? Right now those are priced at $10. Can you approve this, or would it violate the amateur standing rule and the rule regarding gifts?\n\nA.: In concert with and as part of the recognition/event, we would ordinarily consider a photo to be in the vein of a plaque/certificate - symbolic in nature and acceptable. Bylaws, Article XI and ROE, Article IV.\n\nAcademics & Attendance\n\nQ: We have a player that did not dress because of grades last nighty in our 1st tournament game. Does he remain ineligible for the remainder of the WIAA BB tournament. At mid term our code states they become eligible as soon as they correct the grade. At the end of the quarter or semester we follow the 1 week or 15 day scenario. Can't find this in the book and want to make sure we follow procedure - I believe they are ineligible for the remainder of the tournament. Please confirm.\n\nA: There are three types of rules: NFHS & Season Regulations, Academic, and Code of Conduct. 1) If an athlete is ineligible for behavior (p. 39, Article VII, Section 3), the athlete is out of the entire tournament (p. 39, VII-3-D). 2) If an athlete is ineligible because of an ejection, it is the result of an NFHS rule and Season Regulation and he/she may return to the tournament once the ejection penalty is served. 3) If an athlete is academically ineligible and your code of conduct allows return, the athlete may return on the 16th scheduled school day if two or more F's (p. 36, V-2-A-1) or when your code of conduct allows if less than two F's.\n\nKeep in mind that athletes who are ineligible during the WIAA tournament (for any reason) may not appear in uniform, participate in warm-ups, and may not participate in the awards ceremony at the WIAA tournament (p. 39, VII-3-E). In this question and situation, the athlete may return when they become academically eligible. Always apply your code as written.\n\nQ: Just a quick question on 15 day ineligibility. I am sure I am right on this one, but I know the parent is going to be asking questions and I want to be prepared. A wrestler's 15 day ineligibility ends today because it is the 15th day. He is not eligible for regionals tomorrow because it is not a scheduled school day correct? His eligibility would resume on Monday.\n\nA: You are correct. He becomes eligible on the 16th scheduled school day: Monday.\n\nQ.: Our district recently passed a policy that students be required to maintain a 2.0 grade point average in order to be involved in extracurricular activities (sports, etc.). The question that has been brought up is, what happens to the special ed students who try as they might, can't make this new GPA requirement. Is there anything that can be written in the IEP to allow them to participate in these activities and \"outrank\" the school policy? Some have said that if it's written in the IEP than it should be followed. But, this really doesn't relate to FAPE does it? I don't know if others have experience with this and if there has been any court cases that have set a precedence for something like this.\n\nA.: I completely agree with the basic premise I read in your comments... regarding FAPE vs IEP and sports participation. \"Requiring\" sports participation in an IEP is not appropriate any more then it would be expected for the IEP to also prescribe what position a student ought to play or how much playing time the student should receive! Your district may want to address the 2.0 gpa requirement in light of students identified as having special needs and/or students who may not meet specific definitions to be afforded an IEP, but still have some diminished capacity or extraordinary need. It may be done either, individually, based on identified and specific needs (in the IEP). It may be done as broad policy. Either way, it ought to be \"spelled out\" (keep in mind that if you put a different standard then 2.0 in the IEP, the student must still meet that standard, and meeting an alternative GPA standard or requirement is far different then putting sport participation as a requirement in the IEP). In my former role as an AD, we developed an academic standard which had both, a no-F policy and a GPA requirement. We developed a relief mechanism/policy/plan in anticipation of the possibility that a student might not be able to meet the GPA requirement. In effect, the simplest/most effective means we came up with was a teacher \"sign-off\" sheet. We would NOT set aside the \"no F\" component. We would not accept failure for a student. But if each/every teacher \"signed off\" that the student was current and doing everything reasonably possible to succeed in the class, I could waive the gpa requirement. As I recall, our expectations for waiving the gpa, included: 100% class attendance; 100% up to date on assignments; participates in positive manner in class; seeks out the teacher for extra help outside the class. We designed the model for weekly or bi-weekly feedback from teachers. The student was responsible to initiate all contacts between teachers, AD and coaches. We designed it to promote teacher/student interface...and student accountability/ownership.\n\nQ.: We have one varsity soccer team, a red JV soccer team and a white JV soccer team, and a red freshman team and a white freshman team. I understand that academic ineligibility stemming from a fourth quarter failing grade shall result in the lesser of 21 calendar days beginning with the date of earliest competition (September 14) or one third of the maximum games allowed in a sport. Is one third of the games allowed based solely on the varsity season schedule, or each schedule for each level? As an example, one third of the JV season is a different \"date\" for eligibility than one third of a varsity season. In turn, one third of the season in the JV red schedule is different than one third for the white schedule. Is it possible to have, five different dates of eligibility based on what one-third of a season is? Or is the one-third of the season based on the varsity schedule and, therefore, soccer has one \"date\" for eligibility. Understood is the lesser of 21 days or one-third.\n\nA.: The 21 calendar days would be the same \"count\" for all, i.e. the earliest allowed date for competing would be no earlier then what the scheduled varsity is, since the days are counted from the earliest date that practice can begin. In so far as JV and varsity, the max number of games that can be scheduled is the same for all sports, (e.g. varsity 24 games for soccer/24 for JV) thus one third the max allowed would be identical for varsity and for JV. You are correct to adjust figure for frosh. The max they are allowed is 16. Thus one third is 5.3, rounded up to six games. Whether you've filled the frosh or varsity/JV schedule ornot, the suspension is based on max allowed.\n\nQ.: We have a student who competed in wrestling during grades 9-11. The family moved to Florida, while the wrestler moved to live and work with grandparents in Puerto Rico for one year. The wrestler did not receive any education for the year. The wrestler returned to our school, established residency with parents, and plans to complete his senior year. Is the wrestler eligible to compete as a \"fifth year senior\" having only completed six semesters of education? The wrestler will turn 18 during the upcoming school year.\n\nA.: No. Not without a consecutive semester waiver. A student has the potential for up to eight consecutive semesters of eligibility beginning with grade nine. His consecutive semester \"clock\" or count begins when he began 9th grade. That he or the family chose to take a year off does not stop that count.\n\nQ.: Referring to page 35, Section 2 - Academic Eligibility, part A in the WIAA 2004-2005 Handbook, \"A student must meet.... In the most recent grade-reporting period.\" Our school is in a four period block schedule. Grades go on transcripts at the end of each nine week term. But every three weeks we make available \"progress reports.\" In the past, these reports did not give out specific grades, but rather statements of progress like, \"acceptable, currently failing,\" etc. Now we have a new computer network grading program that does not allow these phrases to be used. For progress reports, we will have to give out actual letter grades now. Our code of conduct refers to grades at the end of each nine week term - the progress reports had no impact on eligibility. May we continue to consider the most recent grade reporting period to be the ones that occur at every nine weeks?\n\nA.: Absolutely. Your dilemma is not unique. For added awareness and clarification, you might find a way to document that: \"Even though we are providing a letter grade at this time in this progress report, it's important to note that the final quarter grade could change and may rise or fall depending on work submitted between the time of this report and the end of the nine week grading term. NOTE: Academic eligibility for all extra curricular activities shall be based on the actual nine week grade which is the grade that will appear on the student's permanent record of this term. (This is just an idea.) Bottom line, the \"progress report\" is not the \"final\" grade...for the grading term, only an indication/a snap shot of where the student is at present and does not need to be used for determining eligibility in this application.\n\nQ.: In the Handbook under Rules of Eligibility - Article V, section 2A 7 a.(page 36), it states minimum of 21 days beginning with the date of earliest allowed competition in sport. Does competition mean when practice starts, or when games start. I used the start of the season, and was questioned on it. We have the same wording in our code as the WIAA for fall sports.\n\nA.: Earliest date of competition is the date of first game. Not the date practice may begin. See Handbook pgs. 9-10; the earliest date of each \"first game\" for each sport is identified. That \"earliest date you may \"compete\"/play a game, is \"ONE\" - the first day of your 21 calendar day count. There is also a matrix for fall sport eligibility on the web and on p. 5 of the June Bulletin. Penalties for use of ineligible players is outline on p. 31 of the Handbook.\n\nQ.: I would like your input on the following situation. A student this summer transferred from our school to School X and wants to play football. In looking at his academic record for last semester, he received two failing grades from us. However, the student took two sessions of science in summer school at X High School and received a passing grade for both classes. The student failed both physical science and world cultures at our school. In looking at the bylaws it states a student may become eligible through summer school provided the courses made up are equivalent. The School X coach is asking me to determine whether or not the student would be eligible. How does one determine if the classes are equivalent in this case? My feeling is that the student would be eligible at X. Is this correct? (Please note I am not sure how the science classes compare).\n\nA.: You are correct. The use of \"equivalent\" in this text speaks to the number of F/Classes made up; i.e., if the student failed two classes and you were a \"WIAA minimum code requirement school\" (not morethen one failing grade), the student would have to make up one class to restore eligibility. If he failed three classes he'd need to make up at least two, etc. (That's the \"equivalent\" number of F's that made him not eligible.) If you were a \"No F\" policy, then the equivalent is two classes made up...or the exact same number as he may have failed. Under no circumstance could a student erase multiple failures with less then the same number of classes completed in summer. Also, it has not been interpreted to mean that if the student failed geometry, they must re-take geometry in the summer (or even another math class for that matter). We are addressing number of failures and classes...not course content.\n\nQ.: We have several students that have not done well in regular education classes that will be in an on-site GED program during the 2004-2005 school year. In your opinion, are these students eligible to compete in extra-curricular activities?\n\nA.: Provided these students are enrolled as full-time students, same as every other student, make the necessary grades (not more then one F, etc.), are within the eight consecutive semester allowance and age rule and follow your participation code, there is little reason to deny them the opportunity to participate. You can find the added definition for full-time student on p. 34 of the new handbook.\n\nQ.: I have a question regarding academic eligibility of a transfer student. The student transferring to our school passed all of his classes for the second semester, but had failing grades for two of the classes in the fourth quarter. Which grades take precedence for academic eligibility, the second semester grades or the fourth quarter grades?\n\nA.: The WIAA does not determine whether a school must count the quarter or semester grade. That's the school's \"call\". Our only stipulation is that whatever you use to determine academic eligibility it is the \"standard\" and is used all of the time and by all sport participants. (Not using the quarter grades for \"this student or team\" and the semester grade for the other student or team.) If there is a trend, it might be to look at the quarter grades for sport eligibility. If eligibility is a \"privilege\" then some feel that maintaining that privilege is an earn as you go proposition, and that the quarter grade is the most accurate reflection of what the \"student's doing now\" in order to preserve the privilege of access to sport competition. In this situation the discussion revolves around whether to use semester grades or quarter grades, when a student is transferring, the \"receiving school's\" academic policy is applied regarding semester or quarter grade usage. But always apply the sending code for the determination of ineligibility. If the sending school is one failing grade and one quarter of ineligibility while your code is two failing grades and 15 scheduled school days of ineligibility, use the sending school's one failing grade and one quarter of ineligibility. In cases where there is a code of conduct issue lingering, the sending school's code applies. That's the code the student knew and \"signed on to.\"\n\nQ.: Last year, we had foreign exchange students who were sophomores. They were members of a program and WIAA eligible. This year as juniors they returned and were not part of a program and, therefore, not WIAA eligible. If they return next year as seniors would they be eligible to participate? I am reading the rule stating that after one year of ineligibility students become eligible if attendance is continuous.\n\nA.: You are correct. Handbook, p. 33/Section 5 A-1.\n\nCamps & Clinics\n\n3-6-12\n\nQ: What is the rule on a club paying for part of a high school student's summer wrestling camp.\n\nA: Athletes must pay 100% of training costs. See the Rules at a Glance.\n\nF. EXPENSES – TRAINING AND COMPETING\n\n1. The WIAA recognizes a distinction between training and competing. Students must pay their own expenses, including transportation, to any nonschool (out-of-season) camps, clinics, or specialized training. Schools may pay expenses and provide transportation to similar in-season activities in that sport and during unrestricted contact days in the summer.\n\n2. A student may be reimbursed actual and necessary costs associated with competing. This may include transportation, food, lodging and entry fees.\n\n3. A school may not become involved financially, through transportation or any other way in a student's nonschool participation outside the sport season and the five Board of Control approved unrestricted contact days in the summer. (BL – Art. II, RE – Art. IV and Art. VI) Note: Funds kept in school activity accounts are considered school funds.\n\nThe only time camps may be paid for athletes is during the five unrestricted contact days and it must be available to any and all interested students.\n\n1-17-12\n\nQ: If our school coaches host a youth (8th grade and younger) baseball clinic/camp in the winter or spring at school, can high school players serve as unpaid assistants?\n\nA: Coaches may not coach their athletes outside of the season. If your coaches work a non-school camp during the school year, their athletes could not work the same camp. Note, schools may not conduct camps during the school year out of season. See the following on the Rules at a Glance:\n\nC. CLINICS AND SCHOOL FACILITIES\n\nSchools may not be involved in conducting clinics outside the season, with the following exceptions. So long as participation is voluntary and available to all interested students:\n\n1. There shall be no restrictions upon schools, school teams and school coaches (grades 9-12) relative to assembling in the summertime, for up to 5 days, which do not need to be consecutive. Unrestricted contact days must conclude no later than July 31.\n\n2. A school may conduct a clinic for students in grades 8 and below, where high school varsity and junior varsity coaches may use some or all of their high school athletes as clinicians. This may be done for a maximum of six days during the summer (when school is not in session) and must conclude no later than July 31. Clinics not utilizing athletes as clinicians may be conducted throughout the summer up to the start of school.\n\n3. School facilities may be used for nonschool programs, according to board of education policy, which can result in clinics being conducted, outside the season, by nonschool groups. The nonschool group must request the facilities from the board of education or governing board, through normal procedures and are encouraged to provide their own insurance protection. (BL – Art. II and RE – Art. VI, Sect. 2)\n\n4-24-10\n\nQ.: I am aware that students from another district cannot participate in our open gyms during the summer, but what about camps. Can a girl from the neighboring district participate in a volleyball camp sponsored by our coach and intended for our district girls? Can our coach restrict it to only our girls, or can she promote it with other schools if she wants? How would any of these scenarios affect the contact days allowed for our coach?\n\nA.: Here are some summer camp thoughts. The camp must be open to any and all interested boys and/or girls. It must be voluntary and not mandatory. Camps may not be used for official and/or unofficial \"try- outs\" for the upcoming season. Coaching restrictions apply. Camps during the five unrestricted days may take place after the last day of school and before July 31. Schools may provide transportation, instruction, etc. Outside of the five unrestricted days, coaches may not coach athletes they will coach the next season. Schools may not conduct camps during the school year. Students/families must pay 100 percent of the costs. If a reduced price is offered it must be provided to all participants. The only way for booster club funds to be used is to gift them to the school and the school to use booster gifts during the five unrestricted days. High school students may work a lower level camp as a clinician, but the camps may not be longer than six days and must be completed before July 31. A student can be \"employed\" and be paid for work- ing a camp as a clinician/coach. But, a student may not be \"self-employed\" in marketing their sport skill/expertise. Students may assemble in any manner during the summer without school and/or coach\n\ninvolvement (Captain's practices). However, Captains' practices are not allowed during the school year.\n\nQ.: I am wondering if a booster club can cover the cost of a hotel room when players go to a team camp in the summer time? I am thinking of having my team attend a team camp in Green Bay, and while I know I cannot pay for their entry fee to the team camp, I am wondering if I can pay for the lodging at a hotel.\n\nA.: In order to provide an accurate answer, I would need to know if the camp is part of your five unrestricted contact days or is not a part of the five unrestricted contact days. If camp were to be part of/counted within, your unrestricted contact days – then booster's could gift the school. Then that and other school funds could be used to provide camp opportunity for - ALL - interested students. Must be part of unrestricted days otherwise, camps/clinics are 100 percent responsibility of student and family. If the camp were not part of your unrestricted contact days, the answer would be \"No.\" See III-F of Rules At A Glance. Students must pay their own expenses, including transportation to any non-school (out-of-season) camps. Logistics could be accommodated by having students cover their own cost for the bus transportation. If they wished to ride bus. All interested students could travel by bus if they desired, but would need to cover their own bus ticket costs to camp in this scenario. For camps and clinics, student/parents must pay 100 percent of the costs.\n\nQ.: I am writing as the president on behalf of our wrestling club which is not associated with our school. We are a non-profit association organized to promote the sport of wrestling for ages pre-K - high school. Are we able to reimburse the athlete for their expenses to attend a summer camp held off-site from school? Actually to be held at another school district... I've read under summer reminders at the Web site... \"students must pay their own way to any camp, clinic, or specialized training.\" but then it goes on to say that \"nonschool groups can pay expenses related to actual competition, such as entry fees into summer leagues, etc.\" Can you please clarify for me so that we don't have any violations? Also, what if the club is hosting a fundraiser event such as a car wash or brat fry - are the athletes able to split those profits and pay for their camp fees with that money?\n\nA.: Our member schools have allowed reimbursement for some costs associated with competition and not camps or clinics. Competition would include meets or tournaments. Training would include practice, camps, or clinics. EXPENSES – TRAINING AND COMPETING – 1) The WIAA recognizes a distinction between training and competing. Students must pay their own expenses, including transportation, to any nonschool (out-of-season) camps, clinics, or specialized training. Schools may pay expenses and provide transportation to similar in-season activities in that sport and during unrestricted contact days in the sum- mer. 2) A student may be reimbursed actual and necessary costs associated with competing. This may include transportation, food, lodging and entry fees. 3) A school may not become involved financially, through transportation or any other way in a student's nonschool participation outside the sport season and the four or five Board of Control approved unrestricted contact days in the summer. (BL – Art. II, RE – Art. IV and Art. VI) Note: Funds kept in school activity accounts are considered school funds. The WIAA members have stated in the Rules of Eligibility (page 38) Article VI, Section 2, #5, that any fees for entrance to the clinic must be paid for by the students or parents in order to not affect the amateur status of any participants. Students/families must pay 100 percent of costs associated with camps or clinics. This includes receiving free and/or reduced rates on equipment, apparel, camps/clinics/instruction and com- petitive opportunities that are not identical for all other participants.\n\n12-18-09\n\nQ.: I read over the Handbook, the eligibility section, and could not find specific language for paying for entry fees to camps over the summer. We have a few parents that would like to do a fundraiser to raise some money to offset the cost of the camp. There are nine girls that are looking to go to a camp this summer and it is quite\n\nexpensive. A few of the parents thought that if they were to do a fundraiser, they could help offset the cost for some of the families. Would this be a violation of amateur status?\n\nA.: During the summer, if the fund-raised money is kept in a nonschool account and the fundraisers wished to cover the costs for all students interested in summer league play, they could cover costs associated with competition. However, when it comes to camps, clinics, special training and/or instruction – student and parents must cover 100 percent of associated costs. If it is during your unrestricted five days, then the money could be gifted to the school and used during that time.\n\n5-8-09\n\nQ.: Can our booster club give a student-athlete money to go to a summer camp (such as a scholarship)? Also, we do a fundraiser every year, can I use some of that money so a kid could go to a camp?\n\nA.: Simple answer is no. See III- F of attached. If camp were to be part of/counted within, your unrestricted contact days – then booster's could gift the school. Then that and other school funds could be used to provide camp opportunity for - ALL - interested students. Must be part of unrestricted days otherwise, camps/clinics are 100 per cent responsibility of student and family.\n\n3-27-09\n\nQ.: Can the girl's soccer coach pay for a team camp with the girl's activity account. Similarly, if my softball coach wants to send her team to a clinic is this something she can pay for out of her activities account? The girls fundraise through working concession stands and I just wanted to double check to make sure that this is an appropriate way to pay for this team clinic.\n\nA.: To begin, ALWAYS remember, once money is placed in a school account – it is – school money; regardless how it got there or who put it in. Then, so long as the camp/clinic was a part of the five unrestricted summer contact days, then – yes. School monies can be used. If not a part of the unrestricted days, then – no; kids would need to pay their own way. Lastly, opportunity to have camp paid for must be available to any/all interested girls. It may not be a \"performance based\" benefit/opportunity and it must be a voluntary thing on the part of the girls.\n\n9-19-08\n\nQ.: Can hockey players be used to help coach a youth camp by demonstrating drills to the kids and working with lower level kids on skill development. This camp would be held before the start of the high school season and would be for players in elementary and middle school.\n\nA.: The simple answer is yes. There are a number of caveats. Schools may not sponsor camps or clinics except in the summer. Students could be present and – volunteer - to assist parents – so long as school coaches were not present. School coaches could assist parents – but not when their HS team players are present.\n\n5-1-08\n\nQ.: My volleyball coach would like to set up a camp for high school students during the week of August 4-8. She knows she can not coach in the camp and another person would be in charge of the camp. Is there any restrictions with this request?\n\nA.: The end result of this can be achieved within Association rules, fairly easily. There are caveats. Keep in mind that the time period your coach has identified as a desirable period for a camp is both outside the actual school season and outside the unrestricted contact dates. So then, coach needs to find a camp/clinic during those desired dates owned and sponsored by a non-school provider (see Bylaws Art. II, Sect. 2,\n\np. 26). Bylaws do identify that school facilities can be used by non-school groups in accordance with school district policies (Art. II, Sect. 4). Additionally, the Rules of Eligibility (Art. VI, Sect. 2C-1, p. 38) provides that: \" An acceptable non-school program is one which is not limited to students based on school and/or team status.\" This means that the non-school sponsored camp may not simply be/become \"the school's team practicing/competing outside the season\" (Bylaws, Art. II and ROE Art. VI, Sect. 2A) - or your school's team will be vulnerable. Some of the previous response can also be found at least partially addressed in the Rules At A Glance, Art. II, C and A, especially. Lastly, topics such as hold-harmless agreements, liability insurance/protection held by the non-school provider, acknowledgement of IRS tax requirements and the like will need to be considered. Final word of \"best practice\" advice – be certain the camp is not in anyway able to be described as a \"mandatory\" thing, and/or the official or unofficial 'try- out' opportunity for the upcoming school season.\n\n3-28-08\n\nQ.: Is there a WIAA policy or rule that would impact a high school student attending a camp/clinic during the academic year and prior to their participation in a particular sport that academic year? For example, our women's hockey coach is considering running a fall camp in September/October for high school students prior to the start of the high school girls' practice. Will high school girls be in any kind of violation if they choose to attend such a camp?\n\nA.: The simple answer is 'No.' If a student covered their own expenses and individually sought out a hockey camp or school – there would be no WIAA eligibility peril. There were two significant caveats contained in my response: First, students must cover their own expenses to camps and clinics at this time of year..and second, a 'team camp' format could pose peril for our member school – due to \"the school's team assembling out side of the season.\" The member's rules allow kids to assemble in the summertime without school and/or coach involvement (e.g, captains practices). II-A and III-F & G might also be helpful.\n\nQ.: I am a varsity girl's basketball coach and I was just"
