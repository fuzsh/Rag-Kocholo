        "text": "Two phrases exemplify the culture of Whitfield County government. The first is the Boy Scout motto, \"Be Prepared\". The second - \"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.\" Monday was the first day our our new partnership with the Whitfield County Schools to have culinary arts students prepare lunch for jury panels. The idea is to show our appreciation to jurors for their public service and enable them to stay in the Courthouse for more efficient operations. Being prepared, we asked developmentally disabled students enrolled at our Career Academy to make 150 lunches for prospective jurors. The lemons came into play as criminal cases settled making jury trials unnecessary. Not wanting food to go to waste, we made lemonade by inviting County employees to partake of nutritious lunches painstakingly prepared by our outstanding students. Now some would say what happened today was a waste of tax dollars but we strongly disagree. Anyone familiar with the criminal justice system will tell you the cost of these lunches pale in comparison to the expense of trying cases to a jury. When these cases settled, County taxpayers avoided the expense of paying lawyers, law enforcement, judges, jurors, and support staff necessitated by a jury trial. Additionally, a guilty plea eliminates almost all appellate issues sparing taxpayers the expense of appellate litigation. Most of all, we were able to thank our students who worked hard on this project and show our appreciation for hard working, dedicated County employees. #county #counties #localgovernment #whitfieldcounty #whitfieldcountycares #publicschools #proactiveapproach #justicesystem #jurytrials #employeeappreciation\n\nCity faces wave of short-term let appeals as it seems set to ignore olive branch: New restrictions have seen a dramatic reduction in self-catering ‚Äúsecondary lets‚Äù with just 700 stand-alone properties now very likely to be licensed to operate in the city. With another 1,100 still pursuing permission, operators had proposed a ‚Äúpoint in time‚Äù fast-track system to approve many of these and avert a wave of appeals and the risk of further legal challenges. But on Wednesday the council‚Äôs planning committee will be asked to approve an updated policy which will allow the local authority to continue its hard line approach, which would almost certainly herald another year of uncertainty, delay and potentially costly legal challenges. The council has already spent ¬£400,000 defending policies which have been deemed to be ‚Äúunlawful‚Äù in two separate Judicial Reviews. The Suggestion: In a letter to the councillors, which has not been included in the papers issued in advance, the operators say: ‚ÄúGoing forward, any new operator will require a full planning application under the Planning Control Area. We believe that there is a workable, legally robust solution to safeguard City of Edinburgh Council‚Äôs clear intention to robustly regulate STLs, whilst protecting the small number of professional operators that the city relies on to provide short-term accommodation‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúTo mitigate against further legal challenges, and to reduce the resource required to consider every existing property on a case-by-case basis, we set out the following recommendation to amend the planning policy to reflect that for properties operating pre-designation date of a PCA (5 September 2022): ‚Äòas a matter of policy, any property in existing use that is not subject to complaint or enforcement is not considered to be a material change of use and therefore does not require planning permission and a certificate of lawful use can be granted.‚Äô ‚ÄúThis would offer a balanced, reasonable, proportionate and lawful solution to the current challenge and provide reassurance to legitimate businesses that find themselves in an impossible situation currently. We see this as an opportunity to draw a line in the sand and move forward with STL legislation, which can still be viewed as a success for all parties involved, whilst evidencing some much-needed reflection and pragmatism on achievements the Council has already made regulating the sector.‚Äù https://lnkd.in/e2iX8Nkc #STL #Scotland #Edinburgh Fiona Campbell Anna Scott Myah Thomas (Cert DDM) Ralph Averbuch Anna Calder Urquhart Morris Louise Dickins Clare Winskill Jane Slaughter Carl Thomson Simon Ovenden David Smythe David Weston Marc Crothall MBE The Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA) Edinburgh Tourism Action Group (ETAG) The City of Edinburgh Council Cammy Day\n\nJoin us tomorrow, May 14, 10-11am for, \" PA Civil Rights in Public Accommodations,\" presented by PHRC Director of Education and Outreach Desiree Chang.

We‚Äôll cover: üîµProtections that are provided through Commonwealth law as well as those under Federal law. üîµ A brief overview of limitations of First Amendment rights when considering civil rights protections in public spaces. üîµDifferences in PHRC purview from that of criminal actionable items and a few scenarios of when both may be applicable. Bring your questions, as there will be time for discussion at the end of the training. Register today! https://lnkd.in/e9RWjnRN\n\nI help voluntary bar associations with strategic planning. I tell them to choose three goals, develop a plan to achieve those goals, create a list of tasks to accomplish the plan, assign those tasks to specific individuals and meet regularly to hold one another accountable about those tasks. This is literally all I do as a facilitator for strategic planning. It's quite simple. And what is the most common goal? In fact, what is the one goal every bar association chooses? Increasing membership. And what is the response I always provide? Give more away for free as value adds to being members. The process is simple and the solutions are simple. It's the work - doing the tasks - where bar associations falter and that's where you need accountability."
