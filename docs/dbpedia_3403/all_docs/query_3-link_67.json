        "text": "BATAVIA, Ohio (WXIX) - A Clermont County court employee who insisted to investigators last year that she was not having a sexual affair with one of the judges is now officially fired, county records show.\n\nAllison Kersker, 26, was put on paid administrative leave on June 21, the same day Clermont County Municipal Court Judge Jesse Kramig resigned, county records show.\n\nKramig was accused last year of having an inappropriate sexual relationship with Kersker, one of the court’s administrative assistants.\n\nBoth denied it, county records show, and the investigation was closed with no charges being filed.\n\nHowever, on the afternoon of June 20, allegations arose on social media that Kramig and Kersker were together in a local park during the work day.\n\nThe other two municipal court judges, Anita Bechmann and Jason Nagel, asked Kramig to step down the following day, according to a June 21 news release from the court.\n\n“Mistakes I have made in my personal life have become public,” Kramig, 43, wrote in his resignation letter to the Clermont County Republican Party.\n\n“I am truly sorry for the impact my mistakes have had on my family. I also realize that remaining on the bench could negatively impact its image. As such, I have decided to resign and move forward.\n\nNow, Kersker must go as well, according to a June 26 letter to her from Bechmann, the presiding municipal court judge.\n\nShe was fired last week but then given the option to sign a separation agreement instead.\n\nThe judge did not receive a response from Kersker by the deadline Wednesday so the separation agreement option was removed and her termination stands, effective June 26, according to records released to FOX19 NOW early Wednesday evening.\n\n“Your response to the events of the past year has demonstrated dishonesty and a disregard for the professionalism of this Court. That conduct has led to the disruption of Court operations and our inability to further trust you as a Court employee,” Judge Bechmann wrote in a June 26 letter to Kersker.\n\n“Accordingly, your employment is terminated effective June 26, 2024. However, the Court is offering you the opportunity to enter into the closed Separation Agreement, which provides you with the opportunity to resign effective July 1, 2024. You have requested time (7 days) to review the Agreement. If you choose not to sign the Agreement within the time you requested, the termination will stand and you will receive only pay-out accrued vacation leave in accordance with the Court’s policy. Please review the attached Agreement and let us know how you would like to proceed.”\n\nThe agreement would have required Kersker to waive “all claims and causes of action, known or unknown that she had, has, or may have against “any and all individuals and entities (individually, collectively, and in their individual and official capacities), from the beginning of time to the moment of the execution of this agreement, arising out of or related to her employment with the court, the termination of that employment, and the negotiation, resolution, and release of any dispute she had relating to her employment,” according to a copy of it.\n\nThe separation contract also called for her to not sue or seek relief in state or federal court or try to be rehired.\n\nKramig was appointed to the bench in 2016 and just began serving a newly elected term in January.\n\nHis lawyer, Scott Croswell, said last month the judge’s decision to resign “was a personal choice. His resignation speaks for itself.”\n\nAsked whether a complaint was filed about Kramig with the Ohio Board of Professional Conduct, Croswell responded: “There will be no action by the Ohio Judicial Disciplinary Board.”\n\nHe declined all further comment.\n\nKramig and Kersker did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.\n\nThe case last year was referred to the Warren County Sheriff’s Office, where investigators closed it citing “lack of evidence that any criminal act was committed,” according to the offense report.\n\nThe report says:\n\nThe municipal court administrator told the Clermont County sheriff’s office during an interview before the case was referred to Warren County that Kramig questioned her when she returned from her interview and then told her “I f------ my life up.”\n\nThe court administrator said Kramig disclosed during a private meeting she had with Kramig and another judge that he and Kersker had “an inappropriate, non-physical relationship.” Kramig declined to be interviewed by detectives last year.\n\nKersker said during her interview with investigators “that it was more of an emotional affair, that they care for each other but nothing physical ever happened. She admitted to having frequent phone conversations with Judge Kramig but said it was a consensual relationship and nothing ever happened at the courthouse,” according to the incident report.\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?
