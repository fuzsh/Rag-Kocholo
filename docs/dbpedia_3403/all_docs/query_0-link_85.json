        "text": "The Keynote Address\n\nDeputy Consul General\n\nBy Ashley Prime,\n\nI am a Londoner. I say that in the same way as JFK said Ich Bin Ein Berliner (of course not a donut/danish) for although I was not born in the centre of London, in fact I was born some 25 kms south of the city, I have lived most of my life in the city. And I identify myself with the city, as do many who have lived in London. And that is the point. No matter what our background, our nationality, our position, our job or our status, London brings us together and we are therefore by definition all Londoners. The city makes no judgment. We are part of the city and we all make London what it is. That’s what we call London Pride.\n\nBut what is London? We all know that it is the capital of the UK. What it means to us as individuals is as myriad as the number of people who live, work with or come into contact with what, for me is simply called home.\n\nThe first question I would ask about London is why does it exist? And, why is it where it is? For most of the world, London is simply some 35 kms west of Heathrow or north of Gatwick. That is often our first entrée into the capital. London exists for two reasons. Firstly the river, and secondly the Romans. Before the Romans arrived some 2000 years ago, there was little evidence of anything apart from a few small settlements dotted along the Thames valley. The river in AD47 when Emperor Claudius invaded was broader than it is today, shallower and easier to cross at low tide. For of course then there were no bridges to afford easy access for the Romans to chase the Iceni tribes north, led by one of the Iceni’s most famous warriors, Boadicea. I say ‘north’ for in reality Boadicea came into contact with the Romans somewhere around where Kings Cross station now stands. Possibly and folklore states that she is indeed buried underneath platform 9 or 10. That’s what you call a season ticket! It’s also where you get the train to Edinburgh, or Hogwarts for Harry Potter fans.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the Romans, the area was lightly rolling open countryside traversed by streams such as the Walbrook, the Fleet, the Effra and the Lea. Londinium was established at the point where the Thames was narrow enough to build a bridge, but deep enough to handle sea going marine vessels. Remains of a massive Roman base for a bridge were found in 1981, close to the modern London Bridge. But before the Romans were able to construct a bridge they of course needed to cross the river. The first point up stream on the Thames that the Romans could ford the river at low tide is approximately, give or take a few meters, where London Bridge now stands today. And for Freeman of the city, we have to thank the Romans, at least for location, for London Bridge today, where we are of course allowed to herd sheep. I look forward to trying that when I am next in London. The Sheep won’t be the only ones bleating. I’m not sure whether we are allowed other quadrupeds but perhaps the Master can inform me later which animals can be herded across London Bridge by Freemen of the City. I would like to try Moose or Raccoons or any other Canadian four legged mammals. I don’t propose to herd Grizzlies.\n\nIf the Romans were to arrive today, because the river Thames has changed its course, the first point upstream that they would now be able to ford the river to chase a present day Boadicea is some 25 kms upstream from London Bridge around Richmond or Teddington. Teddington derives it’s name from Tide end town denoting how far the Thames is tidal.\n\nBut there is one thing crucial about the Romans which affected the way London was to develop and the way we see London today. The Romans were a military invasion power, no doubt, but I would argue more importantly, they were traders. The Roman empire could only survive because of trade. The Romans brought with them commerce. And by that I mean that they brought Frank, Gaulish, Roman and other traders as well as Roman legions. This helped, at least for the first 4 centuries anyhow, Londinium’s position as a trading centre for Britannia and the rest of the Roman empire. Roman conquest was as much defined by economic integration of London and Britain with the rest of the Roman empire as with military conquest. Our first foray into the EU, as it were.\n\nBut London is like no other European capital, indeed no other city in the world. London became London for very different reasons to other European cities. It was never a Royal city, never a Paris nor Rome. I would say that London is neither as beautiful as Paris nor Rome. Certainly not as symmetrical. But it is to me, because it is an organic, not a planned town, and its variety is a lot more interesting. We had an opportunity in the 17th century to turn London into a Paris following the 1666 Great fire. Sir Christopher Wren designed plans to build piazzas, boulevards and vistas to match Paris or Rome. But because the City was still medieval in form with literally thousands of small property holders, it was never easy to sweep aside their rights and build the dream London that never was. London never had a Napoleon, or Louis 14th who were able to build, to shape the city to suit them. Dick Whittington was never quite in that category. London has often been wary of the monarchy. Although the Royal Family still live in London, the monarchy has not always had such a welcome as today. Shamed and dishonoured, Richard the 2nd signed his abdication in the Tower of London and Charles the 1st was of course executed in Whitehall. The last time a monarch ever lost his head over London.\n\nLondon is, and always has been a city of money, trade, empire and merchants. Business is the blood that runs through the veins and arteries of London. And throughout most of its history, it has had the critical mass and wealth to attract and create art, music and literature, not only from within Britain but from across the world.\n\nThe full kaleidoscope of London throughout its history has made rich pickings for those who have written about it, and often shaped it. The obvious and famous writers are many. Shakespeare made London, and its infamous “stews”, his stage; and his theatre – the famous “wooden O” of the Globe on the South Bank – became the world. But the pageant continued: Milton, Chaucer, Pepys, Dickens, Sheridan, Johnson, Orwell, Woolf and Wilde. Pepys and Johnson defined their age, defined London. But other writers from across the world like Mark Twain, Henry James, Karl Marx and Silvia Plath have lived in the city, called it their home, which shaped their writing and certainly in Marx’s case shaped the world. He was living in Clerkenwell in London when writing Das Kapital. But the direct effect Marx’s had on economic thinking in the UK and specifically London has thankfully in the main been bypassed.\n\nSamuel Johnson is for me the one who, as a father of the English language, at least as the first lexicographer, is one of London’s greatest sons. And there are many. Like many writers and thinkers of his time, he wasn’t born in the city, but that didn’t matter. He still defined himself as a Londoner and wrote about 18th century London with wit that few others have matched. Although there had been many ‘dictionaries’ written before Johnson’s, we still consider his to be the first. The ‘first’ which stood the test of time. And I would argue that the success of London, the global influence of the city of London created what is one of the greatest journeys in history. The voyage of the English language. At the beginning of the 17th century only some four million people spoke English. Today some 1.8 billion speak it as a first or second language.\n\nLondon is a collection of random villages that have grown up into one mass of a city. Although Spitalfields, which is next Whitechapel, which neighbours the City, which borders Westminster which is next to Pimlico, they share little in common except their proximity. But the most important part, the beating heart of the city is the City. That one square mile that is one of the smallest yet most influential places in the world. It was and remains simply the place where the world comes for work.\n\nLondon’s raison d’être is as a merchant’s city, which attracted and created some of the best literature, art and creativity. Without that wealth creation, little or nothing follows. No museums, no music, no art, no literature. But most importantly, in London’s case no defining global influence. It is not an overestimation to say that London shaped the world in which we live.\n\nThe poet John Bancks in his 18th century poem ‘A Description of London’ still brings the essence of London to life in a way, which for me is as true today as it was then.\n\nHouses, churches mixed together,\n\nStreets unpleasant in all weather,\n\nPrisons, palaces contiguous,\n\nGates, a bridge, the Thames irriguous.\n\nGaudy things enough to tempt ye,\n\nShowy outsides, insides empty,\n\nBubbles, trades, mechanical arts,\n\nCoaches, wheelbarrows and London carts.\n\nLawyers, poets, priests, physicians,\n\nNoble, simple, all conditions,\n\nWomen black, red fair and grey,\n\nPrudes and such as never pray,\n\nHandsome, ugly, noisy still,\n\nSome that will not, some that will.\n\nMany a beau without a shilling,\n\nMany a widow, not unwilling,\n\nMany a bargain, if you strike it,\n\nThis is London! How d’ye like it!\n\nAs I mentioned, London was, is and will always be less of a Royal city and much, much more of a city of trade, commerce and wealth. London remains today the No.1 European city for business and was voted the top city for the 20th year running in 2009, ranking first for easy access to markets, qualified staff, external and internal transport links, telecommunications, and languages spoken. There are over 300. So if we think of Toronto as multi lingual and multi cultural, London gives Toronto a good run for it’s money. London remains the Springboard to Europe: London is the gateway to the European Union’s 27 member states, the biggest single market in the world, with a population of nearly half a billion. It’s geographic location enables it to overlap with normal office opening hours for other countries across the world that account for 99% of world GDP. Notwithstanding Icelandic volcanoes- we gave them cash, they gave us ash; shows what a small, determined island can do - London boasts excellent transport links: there are direct flights to 530 destinations worldwide from London’s five international airports and high-speed rail services to Paris and Brussels. London boasts one of the world’s largest overground/underground rail networks and is the hub for the UK’s domestic transport networks. London is home to Europe’s largest regional workforce — more than 9.8 million, with one in three holding a university degree. Quite simply the world lives in London. You name the nationality, they live there. And that for me is the key to London’s previous and current success. It’s not only a world city, it’s the world’s city. London remains Europe’s leading financial centre: every leading financial institution on the planet is represented in London including all the major Canadian Banks. It remains a magnet for foreign investment: a quarter of London businesses are foreign-owned — with over 20,000 overseas-owned companies London. London remains the wealthiest area in Europe. It’s GDP is bigger than Holland and Belgium combined. Around 28 of the world’s billionaires have chosen to live in London— more than in any other city in Europe. Sadly I am not one of them nor do I know any of them. They may however have heard of me. London is a microcosm of the planet. As Wordsworth said: Earth hath not anything to show more fair.\n\nSo when we think of London, we should, in my view remind ourselves what it is, where it has come from and why it exists. And ultimately, if not perhaps crudely, it is money. Money is central to London’s existence. If you exclude the dark ages from the time the Roman’s left in the mid 4th century until the mid 8th century London has been a city of wealth and everything that wealth brings. It is that freedom to do business within the rule of law that has made London what it is. The British Empire and the Industrial Revolution both had their very financial existence centered around the City of London.\n\nAnd although we have recently had tough times, as I said, don’t underestimate it. London never went away. But I will leave you tonight with one final thought. ‘When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life, for there is in London all that life can afford’. True when it was written in 1777. True in 2010.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe Curriers Company – The first 500 years\n\nThe earliest surviving record of currying in England is in the City of London Coroner’s Roll for 9 February 1276. This covers an inquest into the death of a Currier’s wife living off Newgate Street. She apparently died as a result of a broken leg after falling down drunk in the street!\n\nHowever, the book “The Curriers’ Company – A Modern History”, by Donald Adamson , lists 1272 as the date when the Mistery of Curriers obtained separate working regulations, thus becoming an exclusive trade association. It seems likely, however, that such working regulations were not the first in Europe nor in London, but followed the experiences of other artisans’ organizations in France, Italy, Spain and in other London trades.\n\nThe earliest rules of the trade in London were recorded circa 1300. These laid down the maximum prices a Currier could charge a skinner for the dressing of skins. Four ‘searchers’ were empowered to enforce these rules, one of whom was a Currier. Any Currier charging too much would have a fine imposed. As an example, the Currier could not take more than 5s6d for dressing the skins of a thousand roskyn (fur of the squirrel in summer).\n\nHowever, even with Ordinances in place, the leather artisans continually challenged the boundaries for their respective trades. Even the definitions of the various artisans became confused. For a century these trade boundary rules and ordinances were continually challenged and, as with many other inter-trade disputes of those times, street fights and rioting were regular occurrences between apprentices.\n\nBy the 14th century, Curriers were men of importance in towns and cities in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Until 1367, London Curriers had no sanctioned trade guild. In that year, however, the Curriers constituted themselves into a guild and religious fraternity in the “conventual church of the Carmelites” (White Friars) in Fleet Street.\n\nEnglish and especially London’s Curriers’ prosperity was due in part to the royal supply contracts for leather for soldiers engaged in wars with France and Scotland. Leather was used to link plates of armour, as well as for many items of soldier’s clothing and for tack for the horses used to move heavy war supplies.\n\nIn 1415 The Mistery of Curriers received grant of its First Ordinances by the act of Common Council of the City. These were further strengthened in 1488 by another act of Common Council. The penalties for disobeying these ordinances were huge. For instance, leather discovered improperly ‘tanned, sealed and curried’ could result in the Currier facing five days in jail and a 20-shilling fine - 10 for the King and 10 to the wronged party. If a Currier should carry out the tanning of a skin, he faced a fine of 6 shillings and 8 pence for each skin so treated. Today, 6s8d would be about £300.\n\nBy 1483, the wealth of the Curriers’ guild had grown substantially and their first hall had been acquired in the parish of St. Mary Axe by the Pappey, now London Wall in Aldgate.\n\nDuring the period of the House of Tudor (1485-1603) the struggles between the leather artisans were intense and acts restricting and permitting the activities of workers in the leather trades were clearly a continuing battleground. The Curriers buying from tanners and selling to a whole variety of trades effectively made them the leather wholesalers, and they used this position to increase their profitability substantially. This resulted in many protests, with the result that the Mayor and Council acted through legislation to prevent Curriers from also acting as wholesalers. The effect of this was to squeeze smaller and poor workmen out of business as they could not afford to buy larger quantities of leather that the other purveyors of leather required. Again more protests, and the rights of Curriers to act as wholesalers were restored\n\nIn 1559, Parliament passed an Act affecting the leather industry, designed to improve standards and stop some improper practices. Curriers were forbidden the use of ‘stale uryne or any other deceipfull or subtill mixture’ to cure hides. No leather was to be stripped too thinly or sold with a blemish. Fines and forfeits were entered on the statute books.\n\nThe Curriers had to wait until 1583 before they were granted arms3, which, not surprisingly, featured the curry knife as the centrepiece.\n\nThe Guild continued to grow in strength and authority. In 1503, they obtained the rights of search and seizure; 1516 saw the rights of the Guild extended by Act of Parliament; Royal licence was granted by Henry VIII in 1517; Extension beyond the city was first licensed to the Guild in 1567; around 1580 the Guild was first recognized as a livery company. This all led to the granting of the first Charter of Incorporation4 in 1605. This lays down rules and regulations for Curriers belonging to the Livery Company, including such statutes as a ‘fine of 4 pence a day with meat and drink from the Master, if a Journeyman be unemployed through the Master’s default’ and a fine of 6 pence from the journeyman if he should absent himself from work.\n\nThe Company published bye-laws on 4 June 1605. These imposed fines for poor workmanship, and standardised regulations for premises where currying may be carried out. They should be ‘fitting and convenient for the use of the said art.’ Work on leather had to cease at noon on Saturday and the afternoon had to be employed in cleaning houses, sharpening tools and ‘grayning and shaving of boote legges against the next working day’.\n\nOn the overthrow of the Monarchy in 1649 the Royal charters were of little value throughout the Commonwealth period, except that the Court of Common Council supported the rules and regulations that the charters implied. With the restoration of Charles II in 1660, the Curriers' original Charter was reinstated.\n\nAs with so many of the Livery Companies, the Great Fire in 1666 wreaked havoc within the core of the City. In the process, it destroyed the Curriers' Hall and most of its treasures and archives. As far as treasures are concerned, silver that was not lost was sold to help pay for the reconstruction of the Hall. It took 4 years for the Curriers to move into their new Hall (their third). The impact of the fire was huge. Curriers who lost homes and places of work had to move out of the core of the City while reconstruction took place, and many set up their businesses in their new locations, never to return.\n\nJames II recalled the James I Charters of all the Livery Companies in 1686, issuing new charters in 1687 which included powers that were distasteful to the Companies. The powers were granted for “the Profitt, Comoditie and Reliefe of the good and honest, and for ye Terror and Correiction of the evill, naughty and dishonest”. The interpretation of these categories left the Freemen with much concern, as did the requirement to be in “Communion with the Church of England”. Moreover, the appointment of officers and Clerk were subject to the approval of the King and they could be removed at the King’s pleasure. With the accession of William and Mary, the James II Charters were revoked and the earlier charters reinstated.\n\nThe Last 300 Years\n\nAfter years of wealth and prosperity, the Company experienced money woes at the end of the 17th century, due to the dispersal of Curriers to the evolving suburbs of the City. The hall was let out to others for religious purposes, and the level of activity declined substantially. Later, the Company leased the hall for 7 years to the Pattenmakers.\n\nFinancial woes and problems of control over apprentices and journeymen continued. It became difficult to find members willing to serve on the Court. Even the imposition of substantial fines - £25 (about £2500 today) for the Renter and Upper Warden - was only just sufficient to prevent the problem continuing.\n\nIt was clear that the power of the craft guild was under increasing pressure with the emergence of the Trades Unions and the aggressive business practices of the growing number of capitalists benefiting from the industrial revolution and the industrialization of the leather making processes.\n\nWithin the leather trade in London, the Curriers and the other Leather Livery Companies fought to maintain their control and, as they paid their journeymen well, they were well supported by their employees. However, the other leather trades continued either to curry themselves or buy from cheaper curriers in the rest of the country and overseas. While fighting to maintain their position in the City, the Cordwainers started a prosecution of Curriers for cutting their leather into smaller pieces and wholesaling them to the smaller end-product makers. This dispute ended in the successful quest for an act of Parliament that permitted London curriers to cut leather for sale. However, at the cost of almost £2000, the company became heavily indebted and it was years before those debts could be paid off. In doing so, the Court allowed admission of members who were not involved in the currying trade (although they were not allowed to engage apprentices).\n\nEdward Mayer asserts in the original history of the Curriers that the loss of power and fortunes of the company was actually due not to the Trades Unions, nor the capitalists, but to the problem of attracting enough journeymen and the huge growth in the demand for leather which outstripped the production capacities of the members. With a lack of will to change their processes, other producers gained substantial advantage by changing their production methods, thus generating lower pricing and greater profitability.\n\nThe trade steadily declined in the early part of the 19th century. At the start of the century, the financial woes of the Curriers continued. For instance, they declined to participate in the funeral cortege of Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson because of lack of funds. This was compounded with the repeal of the Great Statute of Leather (1606) in 1808 and the consequent loss of power over the artisans and journeymen of the trade. In addition, the various properties that had been donated under the wills of several wealthy Curriers had become dilapidated, but the Company obtained sufficient funds from the Leather Companies' enforcement of the Flaying Acts (1801&1808) to be able to rebuild some of its properties.\n\nWith the repeal of the Flaying Acts (1824) the future of the Company was again thrown into question. Having little control over currying and no income from the quality control of leather, the Company was essentially left with its social and charitable functions only. In 1834, the Court of Common Council of the City officially recognized the loss of most of the Companies' function of industrial control and reduced the fee for admission to the freedom from £25 to £5.\n\nIt was very fortunate that Samuel Jackson, a master currier, bequeathed £800 to the Company in 1825, the interest from which was to be used for charitable disbursement, thus reaffirming the Company’s role in providing charity.\n\nThe wealth of the Company continued to be a concern as funds remained tight and money management depended on the aspirations of the officers and assistants. Possibly the only true example of consistent financial management was in the charities provided by William Dawes and Samuel Jackson. However, with the regular leasing of the Hall, which guaranteed a consistent income, and with other ground rents from properties in Curriers’ Hall Court and elsewhere, the fourth Hall was built in 1820, the fifth5 in 1874 and the sixth in 1876.\n\nThe 20th century started with continuing fluctuating financial uncertainty even though some large legacies were provided by former Masters and Liverymen. After the First World War, the resources of the Company were at a very low ebb, and, in 1920, the Court resolved to accept an offer of £30,000 by Imperial Continental Gas Association for the freehold of the Hall. It was sold in 1921, when the Company moved in with the Cordwainers, using their hall for livery dinners and with the use of ancillary rooms in Cannon Street as their offices. These arrangements placed the Curriers on a much sounder footing and the Court set about expanding the Livery, which had dwindled to less than 40.\n\nThe membership of the Company also changed dramatically. Many of the members were in the legal profession, and with more than 30 members in legal practice, no less than 10 were judges. Both the Court and the Dinners started to look like clubs for lawyers. There were very few practising curriers in the Company at this time.\n\nThe blitz and other air attacks during the Second World War destroyed much of the Company’s properties in Curriers’ Hall Court and also destroyed the Cordwainers’ Hall. Fortunately, most of the Company’s silver and other treasures were saved. Compensation for these losses was received and the Company put in place an investment portfolio which was originally intended as a holding pattern until ground rentable properties could be purchased. After the loss of the Cordwainers’ Hall, the Company contracted with the Tallow Chandlers for office space and meetings.\n\nIssues of ownership of or partnership in ownership of a Hall have arisen numerous times, but, without the core resources to make such an investment, no such initiative has taken root. A major partnership was proposed in 1956 between the Coopers, Cordwainers, Curriers and Painter-Stainers but this was never carried though. This followed approaches from the Company of Secretaries in 1942, 1945 and 1948 and preceded approaches by the Company of Fan Makers in 1983.\n\nIn the absence of any linkage or trade activity, the Company's activities and purpose, like those of many Livery Companies, became social and charitable. Without the wealth and legacies of many of the other Companies, the charitable activities were limited and so the membership was essentially determined by the benefits of the social activities. The success of social activities depended extensively on the enthusiasm and creativity of the Court Executive and its Assistants. In 1965, the lack of people eligible, through service as executive officers, to serve as Assistants caused the Court to seek Assistants directly from its core of Liverymen. This new route to the Court brought in some enthusiastic new Assistants who were influential in rejuvenating the Company.\n\nThe 1970’s again raised the question of the future direction of the Company. Go for an expanded high profile membership of eminent men as a form of exclusive London club or remain family-line oriented and a smaller, less wealthy organization. The latter was chosen.\n\nThe sale of some of the remaining properties at Helmet Court (from the Dawes legacy), due to road-widening, produced funds in 1969 that were sufficient to pay for the building of a paediatric wing at the Brook General Hospital as a family care centre and also to purchase and upgrade a house in Lymington for up to seven lonely people. This was named Dawes House after the original donor. The Brook Hospital wing was opened in 1972 and Dawes House in 1973.\n\nThe Company Today\n\nThe Company’s Livery is now around 100 and includes a wide range of professional men and women involved in academia, accountancy, brokerage, finance, industry and law. Notably there are two practising curriers of leather. In addition to supporting the work of the City of London, its Mayoralty and its corporate governance, the Company provides support to leathercraft in its widest sense, and conducts an annual program of educational and charitable financing. It operates two charities.\n\nThe Company also maintains close links with 3 Military units: 101 (City of London) Engineer Regiment, 7 Squadron RAF and the Joint Special Forces Aviation Wing.\n\nThe Company has arrangements with the Worshipful Company of Tallow Chandlers and hold Court Meetings and various other functions at the Tallow Chandlers’ Hall. Other events are held at the Apothecaries’ Hall, the Cutlers’ Hall, and the Saddlers’ Hall."
