Accompanied by the Lord Lieutenant of Greater London, Sir David Brewer, Field Marshal Sir John Chapple presented each of the Worshipful Companies with a numbered copy of ‘Stepping Forward’\n\nThis publication compiled by the Reserve Forces’ and Cadets’ Association for Greater London documents the record of the Volunteer Military Reservists and supporting Auxiliaries from London from 1908 to 2014. It is a comprehensive and detailed reference guide to the lineages of, and linkages to, London’s Reserve Force units.\n\nThe brainchild of Field Marshal Sir John Chapple, it was first published in 2008 as a guide to Titles and Battle Honours of the Territorial Army in Greater London since 1908. This new edition includes details of Reserve unit links with the London Boroughs and Livery Companies, historical listings of Reserve Forces Centres and the locations of memorials to the fallen. The book has been published in a format that is hoped will encourage attention from both old and young, keen to find out more about the volunteer military heritage within Greater London. It has also been published as a website (http://www.steppingforwardlondon.org/) which will provide a lasting legacy and a living update available to all.\n\nPlumbing for St Magnus – Help!!\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 10th December 2014\n\nAnyone who has spent a penny in the toilet al St Magns knows that it is a less than pleasant experience There is only one toilet for use by the congregation and by other groups who use the church. This can sometimes include three classes of small school children on a field trip to Pudding Lane! It needs a total refurbishment, which will cost in the region of £2500.\n\nConsidering that the Worshipful Company of Plumbers has a historic link with the church, with the Master’s approval, Liveryman Philip Warner, the Cardinal Rector of St Magnus, is turning to the livery for help in this matter, and asking everyone to ‘spend a penny’, or indeed, rather more.\n\nAt the Carol Service there was no collection plate but a basket at he back took just under £500 and a further £100 has been donated through the Office. Your contribution will be gratefully received and if you have your cheque book handy, please make one out to ‘St Magnus PCC’.\n\nPost it to The Church Warden St Magnus Vestry House, Lower Thames Street, London EC3R 6DN or send it via our Clerk. Either way, if you pay tax in this country, please ensure you attach a signed note that includes your name and address stating ‘ I am a UK taxpayer intending tax to be reclaimed on the enclosed donation made under the Gift Aid Scheme’.\n\nA joyful start to the Christmas Season\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 10th December 2014\n\nThe Clerk reads a lesson.\n\nThe church of St Magnus the Martyr rang out with the joyful singing of Cristmas Carols at the annual Company Carol Service. Six readings from the bible took us through the Christmas story and the choir introduced us to “Gaudete Christus Est Natus” a special 14th Century carol to celebrate our 650th anniversary. Do join us next year.\n\nPast Masters’ Ladies’ Luncheon 11th November 2014\n\nPublished on Tuesday, 9th December 2014\n\nOn 11th November 2014, sixteen Past Master’s ladies of the Plumbers’ Company gathered at The Coopers’ Hall in Devonshire Square for the fourteenth annual Past Master’s Ladies Luncheon. They were warmly welcomed at the door by their Hostess Mrs Diana Paterson-Fox, and Past Master Antony was waiting downstairs with a much welcome glass of champagne. Following a happy time of fellowship and chat, the Clerk of the Coopers’ Company, Lt Col Adrian Carroll, gave a very interesting introduction and history of the Company in the wonderful ambience of the Museum.\n\nThere followed a delicious lunch served in the magnificent Dining Room, with the table grandly decorated with some of the Company Silver. Following lunch and a lot more chat, a toast was proposed to ourselves and to the founder of this wonderful occasion, Past Master John Rae.\n\nPast Master John Rae introduced the idea of a Past Master’s Ladies Lunch. The first lunch was organised by Past Master Charles Smith on 21st November 2001 and was hosted by immediate Past Master’s lady Mrs Judy Moir. The luncheons are now usually held on the same day as Ladle Dinner and hosted by the Past Master’s Lady of 2 years before.\n\nInvesting in Water and Sanitation:\n\nPublished on Friday, 5th December 2014\n\nUN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water 2014\n\n2.5 billion people lack access to improved sanitation1\n\n1 billion people practice open defecation, nine out of ten in rural areas\n\n748 million people lack access to improved drinking-water\n\n1.8 billion people use a source of drinking-water that is faecally contaminated1\n\nHUNDREDS of millions of people have no access to soap and water to wash their hands, preventing a basic act that would empower them to block the spread of disease.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCity View – What is going on in the City?\n\nPublished on Thursday, 4th December 2014\n\nRead the latest edition of City View the magazine of the City of London Corporation by clicking here.\n\nDownloadable documents\n\nDownload City View\n\nA Behind the Scenes Tour of Tower Bridge.\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 3rd December 2014\n\nVisit to Tower Bridge –Thursday 26th February 2015 ****FULLY BOOKED WAITING LIST ONLY*****We are arranging a further tour and first priority will be given to those on the waiting list******\n\nThis exclusive tour takes you to areas unseen by Exhibition ticket holders.

This has now evolved into the Community Plumbing Challenge with the proponents seeing it as an excellent opportunity to have plumbing actively involved in improving access to water and sanitation in those places of need, particularly India and Africa. This initiative will support the efforts of both the World Health Organisation and the United Nations in improving access to these essential human needs improving the health and wellbeing of millions of people around the globe.\n\nClick here to read more\n\nThe Challenge will demonstrate those plumbing skills and techniques required to implement water harvesting/catchment and effective sanitation systems using localy available materials, to ensure cost effective solutions. It will also encourage local communities and individuals in villages to learn the basic plumbing skills required to meet their own water and sanitation needs into the future.\n\nThis idea reinforces the international relevance of the WPC and it’s essential relationship with WHO and WSF, etc., while demonstrating locally what we can achieve by working together. Similarly, the regional meetings of the WPC are bridging gaps between the member organisations and providing the WPC with a presence where we live. Past Master Geoff Marsh writes “I happened to be reading the autobiography of Michael Buerk, the BBC Reporter who shook the complacency of mankind in 1984. He suddenly appeared on television, standing in the morning mist at Koren, in Ethiopia surrounded by dying people in what was a massive unreported famine. What happened next is never to be forgotten. Relief poured in from all corners of the world as people felt ashamed that this catastrophy could happen unnoticed on a planet with advanced methods of communication. Famine, of course involves lack of drinking water and effective sanitation, so let this be a lesson to us if we ever doubt the importance of our World Plumbing Council. In many respects we have only just started to realise the scale of what we have to do to unlock our potential. That is why the Community Plumbing Challenge can be another step forward in this shared responsibility.”\n\nPlumbers help combat Legionnaires Disease\n\nPublished on Sunday, 23rd November 2014\n\nThe attached report (click here) of an outbreak of Legionnaires Disease in an old persons home in Spain illustrates the important role of plumbers in combating this disease.\n\nLEGIONELLOSIS – SPAIN (GALICIA) RETIREMENT HOMES\n\nThe Galician Health Service (SERGAS, its initials in Spanish) confirmed that 2 additional positive cases of legionnaires disease have been detected in the As Gandaras nursing home for the elderly . Consequently, there are now 8 affected persons in this facility\n\nAccording to the SERGAS report, these 2 most recently affected persons have already been admitted in the HULA (initials for the Lucus Augusti University Hospital in Spanish), and are receiving therapy there, as has been the case for the other 5 elderly patients from the same nursing home. They are said to be “doing well”. On the other hand, with respect to the positive cases confirmed in the San Salvador nursing home in Guntin Municipality, where a 2nd Legionella outbreak was detected in Lugo Province — SERGAS confirmed that there are 3 patients still hospitalized in HULA, and all of them are also “doing well”.\n\nWith respect to the As Gandaras nursing home, a spokesman from the Working and Welfare Council confirmed that a “totally independent” circuit “for supplying warm water to this geriatric facility” has been implemented today, for each individual floor in the aforementioned facility. The spokesman also pointed out that a “totally independent” pipe system has been implemented, in order to supply water for the 2 bathrooms used by healthcare workers in the nursing home, and they are located in the ground floor, one in the ladies’ dressing room, and the other in the male dressing room.\n\nThe Territorial Authority for Galicia Council in Lugo reported that the implementation of these pipe systems for warm water in As Gandaras nursing home required that provisional “water distribution pipes” had to be placed “outside” the 8-story building. The system will be operating until the end of November, when a test will be carried out in order to determine if there are still pathogenic bacteria present in the warm water pipe\n\nLiveryman elected President of IHEEM\n\nPublished on Thursday, 20th November 2014Eur Ing Chris Northey BEng (Hons), CEng, IntPE, MCGI, MCIBSE, FSoPHE, FCIPHE, FIDHEE, MIET, MIHEEM and Liveryman of The Worshipful Company of Plumbers became President of IHEEM in October 2014.

A great evening of Company fellowship. The Past Masters were represented with their ladles and Nick received his ladle from the most junior Liveryman Francis McCullagh. The toast to thank Nick for all he did for the Company in his year in office was proposed by Past Master Rodney Cartwright. Over £1,500 was raised in support of CRASH a practical charity addressing the issues of homelessness by harnessing the skills, products and goodwill of the construction and property industry.\n\nOn Armistice Day, Tuesday, 11th November, 107 Liverymen gathered at Saddlers’ Hall for an evening of fellowship and to recognise the contribution of Immediate Past Master Nick Gale.\n\nOn their way into the Reception, Liverymen were encouraged to peruse and to purchase from the comprehensive display of Company regalia. This “showpiece” was competently manned by our newest Steward, Danny Flowers, who utilised all of his sales skills and powers of persuasion to sell approaching £2,000 of regalia, with even more items on back order.\n\nSeparately, a sample of the proposed “livery” planter was on view and during the evening, there were indicative orders for 37 of planters, in lead, to be produced at Singleton – if you missed out, please contact The Clerk.\n\nA hearty meal of soup, fillet steak and fruit pie was followed by the traditional “Sung Grace” and the “Ceremony of the Loving Cup”.\n\nThe traditional toasts were followed by the serving of coffee, during which, The Renter Warden made his way around the assembled company with the Poor Box, in which he managed to “extract” the magnificent sum of over £1,500 in support of CRASH, a practical charity addressing the issues of homelessness by harnessing the skills, products and goodwill of the construction and property industry\n\nThe collection was followed by the Re-presentation of the Past Masters’ Ladles by the Chairman, Senior Steward David Attwood, to 13 Past Masters, in reverse order of seniority.\n\nPast Master Rodney Cartwright gave a humorous résumé of his year and toast to The Immediate Past Master, Nick Gale, who was then presented with his ladle by the newest Liveryman, Frank McCullagh. In response, the IPM thanked individuals together with the Livery as a whole for the wonderful year which both he and his family had been fortunate to experience.\n\nNo report would be complete without thanking The Clerk, Paul; The Clerks’ Assistant, Sharon; Debbie in Accounts and of course, Peter Thompson, our Beadle – all of whom contributed to the success of the evening.\n\nThe proceedings closed with The Chairman, David Attwood, handing over the mantle of Senior Steward to Steward Ken Newnham and announcing that the Stirrup Cup would be in an adjacent room, to which all were invited to partake.\n\nSteward Ian Smith\n\nThe Clerk of the Chamberlain’s Court receives a Plumber’s Ladle\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 12th November 2014\n\nThe Master presented Murray Craig, Clerk of the Chamberlain’s Court with miniature Plumbers’ Company silver ladle as a mark our 650th Anniversary. This miniature ladle will be on display for all prospective Liverymen to see.\n\nA Sparkling Event\n\nPublished on Sunday, 9th November 2014\n\nThe first social occasion of the Livery Year was a colourful trip up the Thames to witness the fireworks at Battersea Park\n\nIn contrast to our summer cruise, the weather was both dull and very wet. Some guests had arrived Thamesside early to get a good viewing spot for The Lord Mayor’s Firework Display which was set off from a barge moored between Waterloo and Blackfriars Bridges. By 18.15 hr, the assembled party of Plumbers and their guests boarded the “Cockney Sparrow” at Westminster Pier in preparation for their river cruise which was to end with a prime viewing position, mid-river, opposite the Battersea Park Gardens.\n\nThe cruise commenced by going downstream for a short while before the buffet meal of beefburgers, sausages and accompaniments were served. Returning upstream we finally dropped anchor in readiness for the firework display centred in Battersea Park.\n\nDespite the intermittent inclement spells of weather, the hardy Plumbers and their guests braved the elements on the upper deck of the vessel to watch the firework display which illuminated the surrounding sky. However, towards the end of the display, the fine drizzle combined with the smoke of the fireworks produced a low haze over the park area and, sadly, reduced the visibility of the finale.\n\nOn the return trip, guests were treated to traditional “apple pie and custard” and tea / coffee, arriving back at Westminster Pier at about 21.15 hr.\n\nIn summary, a pleasant evening was had by all, despite the weather – in true Plumbers’ tradition.\n\nSteward Ian Smith\n\nA bit of recent Company History\n\nPublished on Thursday, 6th November 2014\n\nYou can find copies of the Company Newsletter from April 2005 to October 2013, copies of the eBulletins 2007 – 2011 and the Digital Newsletters by clicking here\n\nGuide Dogs for the Visually Impaired\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 5th November 2014\n\nA message from Livceyman Ken Whitcombe\n\nPlease circulate the Members of our wonderful Livery for their support by voting for the West Telford VIP Group (Visually Impaired People) for their support, in helping us to obtain funds from Lloyds Bank Community Fund. In the voting that there was only 0.4% difference between our Group & the Shropshire Rural Support Group who came in 3rd, this has meant a difference of winning £2,000 to only getting £1,000 , that small percentage margin makes a world of difference to us. Last year we spent just over £1,000 more than we generated in income, this Grant has helped our meagre reserves immensely & given a good start to 2015. To run our Group as a Self Help Support Group for the Newly Registered folk with Serious Sight Loss, we need to generate around £2,500 per year. Thank you again from all of the Members of our VIP Group to the Members of the Worshipful Company of Plumbers in assisting us with their Valuable Votes helping us to win this level of Grant.\n\nFrom the Web Master\n\nIf you know of anyone else who can help please contact the Clerk or Ken direct – his details are in the members section.\n\nCarol Service\n\nPublished on Tuesday, 28th October 2014\n\nChristmas is coming.

Click on header for details.\n\nThe museum had been closed for more than a year but the resulting completed works were worth waiting for. The Imperial War Museum was opened in 1920 by King George V, its first home being in the Crystal Palace, to commemorate the sacrifices made by millions in the First World War. The main objective our trip being our guided tour of the new gallery one hundred years after the beginning of the First World War. Our party was split into two groups and the museum had allocated two guides, Alex and Will for our 11.00am visit to the First World War Galleries. Our first group were given a short explanation of the field gun in the main hall, which had been manned by three holders of the VC , and was salvaged after a battle. The second group followed after a ten minute break, both guides proving equally erudite. The lead group were then taken for a superb tour of the First World War gallery, which lasted for a little more than one and a half hours, the second group following behind. We were to discover the story of the First World War through many exhibits from those who had fought in the war and those who had remained behind. Why the war had started and why it had lasted for four horrific years and the impact it had left on the soldiers and their families back home. Amongst the thousands of exhibits were many letters from the front line soldiers describing the horrors of what they were experiencing. The recreated trench with a Sopwith Camel plane overhead and a Mark V tank straddling the trench was a fitting exhibit to conclude our tour. Both groups thanked their guides for the excellent, manner in which the tour had been conducted. The group then met for lunch at The Three Stags Public House, where the proprietor Richard Jones had allocated a section for our use. The Lunch and several glasses of wine proved a fitting end to a most enjoyable day.\n\nSenior Steward David Attwood\n\nSt Michaels Day Service in Our Church\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 15th October 2014\n\nThe Master was accompanied by the Mistress and a number of Liverymen for a Solemn High Mass in our Company Church.

Stresses on these systems caused by rapid urbanization, population growth and aging infrastructure further exacerbates the problems. This reference tool has been developed to help water suppliers and regulators who are familiar with the Water Safety Plan approach, enhance their risk assessment and management and investment planning for their water distribution systems.\n\nGet the WHO Reference Tool by clicking here.\n\nThe New River Walk: Neither New nor a River!\n\nPublished on Friday, 12th September 2014\n\nThe Walkers\n\nMetropolitan Water Board panelled Board Room\n\nA most intimate group, including the Master, was led by enthusiastic local guides Darian Mitchell and Peter Darrah on one of the most intriguing, enjoyable and relaxing walks one could ever wish for in the later summer sunshine. We followed the London end of Sir Hugh Myddelton’s (1560-1631) fantastic ambitious engineering scheme to bring fresh water from Hertfordshire to the City of London citizens via an artificial canal, from the 19th century Stoke Newington reservoirs to the termination site of the New River Head ponds near Sadler’s Wells, in Rosebury Avenue, a walk of some five miles.\n\nClick here for full report.\n\nEdmund Colthurst had the initial idea and obtained a Charter from James I in 1604, but work faltered and Myddleton, ever the entrepreneur, stepped in and raised “adventurer” shares. With opposition from landowners and other technical terrain difficulties Myddleton, a Goldsmith and jeweller to the King, encouraged James I to fund part of the project in return for a “moiety” or half share of the profits. The King also squashed any opposition from landowners. In the year of our Charter, 1611, work once more resumed and this early water engineering feat was completed in 1613, with the sluice being opened and the New River Head conduit basin some 200 feet in diameter being filled with fresh water in the presence of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London. Over 600 men were employed in its construction at a cost of £18,525. The 10ft wide New River followed the 100ft contour with a drop of only 18ft over 40 miles. In a straight line the distance from the Chadwell Springs and the River Lea at Hertford is only 20 miles. Gravity took the fresh water over wooden aqueducts lined with lead. With the earth banks shuttered in wood it became known as the “boarded river” by locals. Water issued from the round pond, just north of Clerkenwell, at the New River Head to the City via elm pipes to those citizens who could afford it. As London’s population grew so too did the demand for water. Later 19th century developments took place with the Stoke Newington reservoirs being built and steam pumping stations being constructed along the route to assist flow, the most famous being the “Castle”. It was here that the New River was cut off and sections were covered over and other parts made redundant. In 1993 the great Stoke Newington reservoirs were drained and planning permission for housing given for the site. Locals objected and the filter beds were re-charged with water and they now form a water sports facility. The New River still provides some of London’s water. For us it was the discovery of the tranquil lost world of the New River Walk which winds its way through north London following the old course through Clissold Park and Islington to Sadler’s Wells. This final section is now partly obsolete, with vestiges appearing and disappearing, but our guides knew exactly where to take us. Their knowledge of local history and that of the fine 18th century houses, developed by the New River Company and the Lloyd-Baker estates, with their colourful owners provided further captivating interest. We even had the privilege of Darian allowing us to visit her delightful historic house. Our final triumph was a special visit was to the fine 17th century panelled board court room of the old Water House, known as the Oak Room, which was reconstructed in the 1920s Metropolitan Water Board head offices, since developed into private flats. The construction of these offices destroyed the old 17th and 18th century buildings set around the great pond, although part of the pond’s construction may still be located, so too one of the conduits.\n\nWe had a delightful lunch at the Kings Cross above Harry Potter’s 9 3/4 platform, thanks to Senior Stewart David Attwood’s arrangements, where we chatted and reflected on the morning’s walk. It was, without doubt, a superlative outing and one which will certainly be repeated.\n\nDr Peter T J Rumley\n\nHistory Group Secretary\n\nCourt Assistant.\n\nHelp a fellow Liveryman – LAST CHANCE ACT NOW\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 10th September 2014\n\nLiveryman Ken Whitcombe, whom many of you will know is blind.

The aim of the Group is Self Help, with our Members Helping each other, both the Carer, talking to Carer, understanding the problems living with a Newly Registered Blind Person, often that is a Partner though Sons & Daughters are the Carer, with the Blind helping the Blind finding solutions to common problems, 3 of our blind Members live alone, they particularly enjoy our Meetings. We go on Days out to various places of interest, taking our Volunteer Sighted Guides to help us along the way.\n\nAs you can imagine to run this Group is not Cheap, last year we needed to raise just short of £2,000, for Room Hire, Coaches, etc. In addition to our Monthly VIP Meeting, often with Speakers on various subjects, we also arrange a regular Walk in Telford Town Park, with Sighted Guides, a Talking Book Group that meets on a Monthly basis, along with the informal Coffee Group that meets Monthly too, each week we try & make something happen. What is particularly satisfying for Paula & I is the fact our Members are taking responsibility for assisting us running the Groups, organising Trips, The Talking Book Group & some of the fund raising, all giving our Members a pride in the Group.\n\nSo what is the Big Ask ? Lloyds Bank has chosen our West Telford VIP Group for a Grant, Lloyds Bank split the Country into 360 Areas, in each Area there 4 Local Charities, our Group is one of the four chosen for Shropshire.

Yep, 74 miles around the island in 2 days (actually plus a bit where the costal path signage was lacking and our instincts let us down). Very exhilarating and the most fabulous collection of blisters between us! Support over these two days was supplied by Past Master Hamilton wielding water and energy bars.We started at 4.10am on Saturday morning the 9th of August from West Cowes link ferry and walked 47 miles from there to Ventnor , staggering in at 8.45pm that evening, and on Sunday 10th, back on the trail Ventnor to East Cowes link ferry, a further 27 miles, despite being caught up in the awful weather from the tail end of hurricane Bertha, the walk was completed around the Isle of Wight at 8.00pm, a little slower but ………….. and then, rather like a Phoenix arising out of the ashes, there was the Clerk’s Assistant, Sharon, standing on the finishing line waving a bottle of bubbly – blisters, what blisters!!\n\nTo those of you who have already sponsored the walk around the costal path of the Isle of Wight, on behalf of the Plumbing Museum and Court Barn at Singleton, thank you so very much, and for those of you that might have missed our publicity and would like to sponsor the successful completion of the event a form explaining our appeal with details of how to sponsor is attached – please forgive the hard sell but it is such a good cause and the unique experience of the museum is only made available by the commitment of those who give their time and skills so freely.\n\nThe exhibits, tools and equipment at the Court Barn at Singleton are rather like us, the older we get various bits need maintaining or replacing – the funds raised by this walk will go towards achieving this with particular reference to the furnace and Health and Safety regulations.\n\nPlease, if you have not already donated to this historic and educational side of the plumbing craft may we urge you to consider completing the attached sponsorship form, no matter how great or small every £1 is gratefully received and put to a very good cause within the Court Barn.\n\nFondest wishes to you all from an elated and exhausted\n\nWendy Hamilton and Joe Sibthorpe\n\nDownloadable documents\n\nSponsorship\n\nA Grandstand View\n\nPublished on Thursday, 7th August 2014\n\nTickets are now available for a Grandstand seat at the Lord Mayor’s Show on 8th November 2015.

After a cup of coffee and bacon roll to fortify everyone, we all set off in pairs in great golfing weather – no wind, warm and not too sunny. The Club laid on a very welcome drinks station half way round the first 9 holes and the Master joined us on the course in his chauffeur driven buggy to watch us coming in – thank you to John Demont, our Chairman and the driver, who had a shoulder injury and couldn’t play.\n\nClick on header for more details\n\nNew Zealand laid on a wonderful buffet lunch for us and the Master then presented the prizes: The Livery Champion for 2014 was new Court Assistant Graham Setterfield and runner up was Liveryman Stephen Kay; the overall prize for the best round on the day went to one of our guests, John Sweeney and another of our guests, Nick Jury, was second; the prize for the longest drive went to Michael Munro, the son our golf society secretary and the nearest the pin prize went to another one of our guests, Tony Peters.\n\nUnfortunately, our Society Captain, Liveryman Richard Wigg, couldn’t be with us on what would have been his last outing as Captain and our thanks to him for his support. Past Master Chris Sneath has kindly agreed to take over as Captain and we welcome him and look forward to him driving us forward (and chipping and putting!) Those who still felt up to it and hadn’t eaten too much then went out for a further 9 or 18 holes! Well done to Don Munro for organising such a successful day and to New Zealand for hosting us so warmly. Our next event is the Painter-Stainers’ Inter-Livery Competition at Wildernesse Golf Club, near Sevenoaks in Kent. If you would like to join the Plumbers’ Golf Society, its only £10 a year and we really do have a lot of fun. Contact Don Munro, his details are in the membership section of the website, if you are interested.\n\nFor those of you who came on the Master’s Mid-week break to the Ribble Valley and saw Arthur Conan Doyle’s name as a pupil at Stonyhurst College, he was also a member at New Zealand Golf Club in later life – and his name is still on his locker – now of course crossed through as he no longer plays!\n\nReflections from a first time participant.\n\nAlthough a liveryman for 17 years and a golfer slightly longer, the two interests had not come together until recent weeks when I made contact with Don Munro, who is the golf event organiser. So my visit to The New Zealand Golf Club for the Summer Meeting on 1st August 2014 was my first experience of the Plumbers and Golf combined and my first visit to this venue. The course is well known and is rated among the top 50 in England. It is all old-fashioned charm, each hole separated from its neighbour by tall trees and woodland. Each fairway protected by dense heather. Designed to blend into the Surrey heathland and woodland, the course is not long, but straight hitting is essential. The greens are superb, fast and true without manufactured breaks, but subtle and designed to trick the unwary – and needless to say the bunkers are where they need to be!\n\nOn the day there were 24 players, of these 12 were liverymen and the remainder guests, not forgetting the Clerk. The competition took place in the morning in pairs, which meant that lunch was sensibly early and for those who wished there was time in the afternoon for more golf. Lunch was very traditional, old fashioned golf club style and excellent. Conversation with old and new acquaintances from the Livery and among guests was relaxed and easy. The Master watched some golf in the company of the golf chairman, John Demont, and was suitably both impressed and unimpressed with what he saw, as always with golf societies a wide variety in skill was present. The Master presented the prizes after lunch to those who were fortunate enough to be on form on the day. It was a very enjoyable day, good company on course and at lunch, a superb golf course, good food and very well organised.\n\nSame time, same place next year?\n\nGraham Setterfield\n\nFive New Liverymen\n\nPublished on Thursday, 31st July 2014\n\nJames Quiggin, Malvern Tipping, Barbara Abraham, The Master, Trevor Wilson, Kingsley Poulton\n\nAt the meeting of the Court on 29th July, James Quiggin, a Building Services Engineer, proposed by UW SL Hodkinson and seconded by PM DJ Hamilton, Malvern Tipping, a Chartered Surveyor proposed by PM CG Sneath and seconded by IPM CJ Yuill, Barbara Abraham, a Tax Adviser proposed by Snr Asst EFM Stary and seconded by PM JAN Lockyer, Trevor Wilson, a Retired Policeman, proposed by Past Std RJ Harvey and seconded by Snr Std D Attwood and Kingsley Poulton, a Property & Technology Consultant, proposed by Asst PD Flatt and seconded by PM MS Samuel were clothed in the Livery.\n\nTwo New Court Assistants\n\nPublished on Thursday, 31st July 2014\n\nNick Jones and Graham Setterfield\n\nThe Court welcomed Nick Jones and Graham Setterfield as new Assistants at their last meeting.

We traveled to the course in some trepidation because at 8 am there was indeed a torrential storm which had been rolling around the London area for some time. However, when the golf started at 11 am we had sunshine ,as you can see from the attached photos (courtesy of John Carnaby). The good weather lasted throughout the golf and the conditions were ideal. The Plumber’s team of Past Master Chris Sneath, Stephen Kay, Anthony Lowe and Don Munro performed well and were only a few points behind the winning teams. Everyone enjoyed a pleasant day on an excellent golf course.\n\nAfter a 3 course dinner an auction was held with some very interesting lots. For instance there was the opportunity to bid for Dinner, Bed and Breakfast for 4 people with the Lord Mayor in the Mansion House. Following that there was an entertainer, Nicholas Einhorn, a magician who astounded us with his incredible trick. All in all, a memorable day – enjoyable companionship, successful fundraising and dry golf. I believe that this is the first time a golf event has been held on behalf of a Lord Mayor!\n\nDon Munro\n\nThe Lord Mayor visits the Plumbers’ Museum at Singleton – History & Craftsmanship in action.\n\nPublished on Sunday, 27th July 2014\n\nThe Lord Mayor\n\nThe Planter with the Lord Mayor, the Master and the Craft Team\n\nLunch in The Gridshell\n\nThe Lord Mayor, Alderman Fiona Woolf, Court Assistant of the Plumbers Company accompanied by consort and husband Nicholas, were welcomed by the Master at the Weald and Downland Museum in Singleton. The highlight of the trip round the various buildings showing crafts of yesteryear was to be found in the Court Barn – the Plumbers’ Workshop. Decorative lead work was produced under The Lord Mayor’s watchful eye. She then visited exhibitions of other Livery Companies and saw active examples of their crafts.\n\nNearly 120 Liverymen with families and friends sat down for a very enjoyable lunch in the magnificent Gridshell Building. Food consumed, the Master Plumber welcomed The Lord Mayor, her consort, Fellow Masters from the Builders Merchants, Constructors, Fuellers, Glaziers, Lightmongers, Masons and Tylers & Bricklayers, Liverymen and all their families and guests. He then made a number of presentations to The Lord Mayor culminating in a magnificent example of decorative lead work: a lead planter commemorating her year as Lord Mayor and decorated with her coat of arms and that of both the City and the Plumbers’ Company. A limited edition of smaller lead planters will be fashioned at Singleton and sold with the profit going to the Plumbers’ charities.\n\nAll in all a great family day out demonstrating not only the craft of plumbing but also that of other Livery Companies and all with our special guest, The Lord Mayor of the City of London.\n\nFor more pictures click here.

Water stress and environmental regulations in the UK are driving UK water companies to consider reuse as a strategic supply option and so require evidence on the array of risks and opportunities this brings.\n\nThis study examines evidence from over 200 relevant case studies of both successful and abandoned treated effluent reuse projects. Real (and perceived) risks associated with different reuse scenarios are identified considering their applicability in the UK. Risk to human health is a primary concern, closely followed by the risks to the environment from changes in water flow and composition.\n\nThis report sets out existing frameworks for managing and mitigating risk, governance issues, and the factors that influence the energy and carbon demands of reuse systems as well as the cost implications.\n\nA bit of culture and supporting the Red Cross\n\nPublished on Monday, 21st July 2014\n\nThroughout 2014 the British Red Cross International Fundraising Committee will be holding ‘ART for LIFE’.

This year was no exception as 66 Liverymen and wives thoroughly enjoyed a few days of Lancastrian hospitality organised by Gales Incorporated – that is the Master and his family. Click on the heading for al writeup and look at a few pictures by clicking here.\n\nIt was raining in Preston as a number of Liverymen and their wives stepped on to the railway platform – some from the 1st Class carriage the others at the back of the train. Then the sun came out as we were met by the Mistress Plumber and were taken to our hotel – either the Northcote or the Inn at Whitewell. Time to drink a cup of tea or a pint of beer and to meet those who had travelled by car. Into “smart casual” and those from the Inn were coached to the Northcote. Champagne on the terrace, lots of chat and then into dinner prepared by Head Chef Lisa Allen , a winner of the BBC 2 Great British Menu show. Twice Baked Shorocks Lancashire Cheese Soufflé followed by Real Lancashire Hotpot. The wines were good as well.\n\nNext morning bright and early we were taken to Stonyhurst College where the young Gales have and are being educated. The oldest Jesuit College in the English speaking world it has a magnificent collection of treasures with books going back to 1400 – not quite as old as the Plumbers’ Company but almost. We were shown round by the Archivist David Knight who took us through the school life of perhaps the most well known old boy – Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This was complimented by the Curator Jan Graffius, who had prepared a display of some of the College treasures. It was truly like a history of England.\n\nThen to Browsholme Hall, home of the Parker family since 1507. Following a lunch we toured the house and played croquet on the lawn. Tuition was provided free of charge by the young male Gales. Some Plumbers quickly learnt how to knock an opponents ball away from the hoops so that they could then knock their ball through the hoop. Not cheating but was it really fair play? The answer depends on whose side you were on!\n\nBack to our place of rest for a short break then into black tie or posh frock for the Gala Dinner in the Great Hall of Stonyhurst College. The pre-dinner reception was particularly enjoyable for the Clerk’s wife, Sue; it was her birthday and she received a surprise bouquet of flowers and a hearty rendition of “Happy Birthday”. What a great dinner it was with fantastic entertainment from soprano Jennie Marsden BMus (Hons) Royal College of Music. The dinner progressed smoothly with some special guests of the Master including his sister and her husband. On one table sat a very attractive blonde lady who really enchanted her neighbouring liverymen. Then attention was called and a black tie dressed Italian waiter announced that a diamante studded hand bag had been found in the gentlemen’s toilet. Shortly afterwards he followed this up by stating that the owner had been found and that he (that is the owner) was very happy. The laughter had hardly subsided before this waiter burst forthwith an operatic aria. This was followed by a French waiter stating that the Italians did not know how to sing and promptly launched into a French operatic aria. Pandemonium reigned followed by peace as the two “waiters” decided that they needed some help. They enticed the blonde guest, seemingly highly embarrassed, to the front whereon she displayed her magnificent vocal range with her operatic performance. The trio of “unexpected guests” then entertained us in brilliant fashion. What an evening, topped by the auction of a gourmet meal and bed & breakfast at the Northcote. It was won by Brian Wadsworth who bid £1,000 which will be donated to our main charity.\n\nAn even earlier start on the Friday, going first to Dunsop Bridge, which has been calculated as the exact geographical centre of Great Britain. Duly impressed , it was off to Queen Street Textile Museum in Burnley. The Mill represents the last commercial steam powered textile weaving mill in the world. We had a conducted tour round the mill and saw working looms. Memories of Blaster Bates came back as we saw the working steam engine, a well oiled piece of machinery that has been working for a century.\n\nLunch back at the Inn at Whitewell, the fish pie was highly recommended then, for those fit enough or not catching a train south, the Hobbits short walk along part of the Tolkein Trail led by Wendy Hamilton.

Click here or on more news below.\n\nOne of the ancient Livery Companies of the City of London, in its early years the Plumbers’ Company was responsible for setting and maintaining the standard for all plumbing apprentice training within London and it also ran the voluntary National Register of Plumbers. Today that falls within the remit of the Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering (CIPHE), with whom we have close links, but the company through its Charitable and Educational Trust still plays an active role in education, training and other charitable causes.\n\nPAUL NASH, clerk to the PLUMBERS’ COMPANY, says: If you travel into London by train (for work or pleasure) through Cannon Street Railway Station you will see a large green man (boy actually) standing on the concourse opposite platform 4 and the ticket office. The Plumbers’ Apprentice Statue was unveiled by HRH the Duke of Gloucester in 2011 to mark the 400th anniversary of the Royal Charter of the Plumbers’ Company and to recognise the company’s support for the training of apprentices.\n\nIn case you are wondering why Cannon Street Station was chosen as the location, it also marks the former site of the company’s hall, which was demolished in 1863 to make way for the station!\n\nOne of the ancient Livery Companies of the City of London, in its early years the Plumbers’ Company was responsible for setting and maintaining the standard for all plumbing apprentice training within London and it also ran the voluntary National Register of Plumbers. Today that falls within the remit of the Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering (CIPHE), with whom we have close links, but the company through its Charitable and Educational Trust still plays an active role in education, training and other charitable causes.\n\nWe run a bursary scheme to help support young plumbing apprentices if they need financial help to complete their training up to S/NVQ Level 3. Supported by the individual’s training college and employer, the decision on whether or not to give a bursary is made jointly with CIPHE and we have been hugely grateful to City and Guilds which have also provided matched funding for recent awards. The panel that makes the decision is drawn from qualified members of the profession within the company and we ask for feedback to see how the young trainee is progressing.\n\nOne of the challenges we face is publicising our bursary scheme. We have had very few applications recently and work is in hand to spread the word. Sadly higher level vocational training today in the plumbing sector is not as readily available as it used to be and we applaud and support recent initiatives to reinvigorate training in this area. Many colleges and organisations now only provide training to NVQ Level 2.\n\nThe Charitable and Educational Trust is supported by our Technical and Education Committee, which also helps with a number of awards we give to recognise those who have excelled in their training. Its members are drawn from those who have a wealth of experience in the trade and profession. Again we work closely with the college or training organisation and often the decision on who receives an award is given over to them entirely. We draw on their experience and expertise.\n\nOne award, “The Wilkinson Shield”, is a joint annual award to the best student and college in the North East Region of England. They are selected by the Newcastle and County Durham branch of the CIPHE and the competition is fierce – it is probably unique in that both the trainer and trainee at the institution must excel to win. Named after one of our Past Masters who inaugurated it, it celebrated its Centenary Award last year. In this region a strong tradition of vocational training continues.\n\nPAUL NASH of the PLUMBERS’ COMPANY continues: Whilst we recognise the importance of supporting training in the modern plumbing profession which we represent, you can see from our history that it is also an ancient craft – and lead working on which much of it was based is one of the traditional crafts we support.\n\nAn offshoot of the company is the Plumbers’ Workshop Charitable Trust, located at the Weald and Downland Museum at Singleton, West Sussex. Here you can see demonstrations of, and learn about, ancient lead working skills – skills we cannot afford to lose, as they are still needed today and in the future to repair and maintain our fine heritage of ancient buildings, palaces, churches and cathedrals across the country.\n\nThe Plumbers’ Company and its charity also support a wide variety of other causes, including city farms in London, musical education and awareness through the St Paul’s Cathedral School Choir, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the Apollo Music Project at Columbia Primary School in Tower Hamlets, and rehabilitation and training for ex-offenders through the Old Bailey.\n\nWe are also proud of our association with the Armed Forces, to whom we provide an annual award to the best plumbing and hydraulic students in each of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force. We also support the Richmond Sea Cadet unit with the training it gives to young people, who repay us by kindly providing a Guard of Honour for our formal banquet in the Mansion House each year.\n\nBlack tie, Posh Dress, Great Company – The Autumn Festival\n\nPublished on Saturday, 28th June 2014\n\nThe Master and Mrs Debbie Gale are delighted to invite you, your partner and any other guests you would like to bring to join them for the Autumn Festival Dinner to be held this year in Skinners’Hall. The Skinners’ Company is one of “The Great 12” Livery Companies of the City of London with a history going back 700 years.

Click on header for fuller details.\n\nOn Thursday 26th June, twenty members and friends gathered in the courtyard of Allington Castle for tea & biscuits prior to our tour.\n\nWe were welcomed by the estates manager Jonathan Davies and members of his staff for what proved to be a very special day.\n\nAs many of those in attendance had travelled a significant distance, Jonathan felt it appropriate that refreshments should be served before the tour began.\n\nMaster Nick Gale and Mrs Debbie Gale, along with a number of past masters, wives, liveryman and friends, set off at 11:45am accompanied by head gardener Adrian, whose brief was to show as much of the forty six acres of gardens and grounds as possible before our lunch.\n\nAdrian prove to be an extremely accomplished guide, as he directed our attention to the most significant aspects of the gardens along with a number of the external features of the castle walls.\n\nWe were to return for our lunch at 1.15pm, which was served in the Great Hall. Our chef Paul, who is also the castle electrician and had reached the last sixteen in TV’s Masterchef, had prepared a superb lunch; we were waited on by Jonathan, his wife Trudy and the trainee gardener Sam.\n\nAfter lunch our party assembled in the main courtyard, where Jonathan began our tour of the castle, directing our attention to the priest hole located in the entrance and to the numerous pieces of antique furniture, which had been purchased by agreement with auction houses around the UK .\n\nJonathan advised us that Sir Robert had entered into the agreement to purchase furniture that had been sold by previous owners.\n\nSir Robert, who chaired a number or steering committees, regularly used Penchester Hall to hold the meetings.\n\nDuring the next hour and half we were privileged to view the more prominent castle rooms, a number of which remained in use, these included the library, children’s bedroom and sitting room, many of which had open fireplaces.\n\nThe guest room, had been recently, used by a several of Sir Roberts guests, including the Japanese Ambassador and his wife and Professors from Kansas University.\n\nWe were then taken to the tower where two bedrooms were located, one of which is said to be haunted.\n\nJonathan told us that the castle was used during a recent article in Tattler, which featured Kiren Knightly, photographed in various rooms.\n\nOur tour ended in the Great Hall, where The Master thanked Jonathan and his staff for a most enjoyable day and to pass on our thanks to Sir Robert and Lady Margaret Worcester for affording The Worshipful Company of Plumbers the hospitality of their home.\n\nSenior Steward David Attwood\n\nLiveryman installed as the next CIPHE President\n\nPublished on Sunday, 22nd June 2014\n\nKevin McCallister, President\n\nTerry Stephenson, Vice President\n\nOn Saturday 21st June a Liveryman of the Plumbers’ Company, Kevin McCallister was installed as the President of the CIPHE for the ensuing year. We offer him many congratulations. Kevin follows Dr Steve Ingle as the holder of this prestigious post. Terry Stephenson was elected as Vice president.\n\nKevin McCallister has been a member of the Institute for nearly 46 years. He served as a member of the Wolverhampton Branch Committee from 1970 to 2008. Currently, Kevin represents the Institute on the Construction Industry Diversity Panel and supports the ‘Get Girls Plumbing’ campaign.\n\nIn his address, Kevin said his theme for the year was Progression. He said he’d had a very interesting and varied career and hopes that he can use his expertise to help others.\n\n“I want to share my experience with our membership wherever I can. Many of our members are creating their own career paths; whether it is setting up their own businesses, looking to expand their business, moving off the tools into management or are in management and looking to move to the next level. I will do all I can to help them.”\n\nThe Master at Large\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 18th June 2014\n\nThe Master at Blist Hill\n\nAt the Palace. Did the Master put the plants in the Planter?\n\nStudying our Craft\n\nThe Master recently visited the Plumbers Workshop based at the Blist Hill Victorian Village at Ironbridge in Shropshire. Many of the Livery crafts are represented here as part of the Ironbridge World Heritage Site. Thousands of people visit the Ironbridge site each year including many schoolchildren, where they can learn about the origins of today’s modern craft’s. The Workshop is run by the CIPHE and, together with the Worshipful Company of Plumbers Museum at Singleton in Sussex, represents a valuable record of our craft’s heritage. In the picture with the Master is Hugh Brown, who at 82 fondly remembers working with the tools displayed in the workshop. Hugh is one of a small team who volunteer to manage the facility.

The two planters were made by Liveryman Terry Fillary MBE, and are positioned in the Rose Garden at Buckingham Palace; where they are looking good for the next 50 years! The Queen was also presented with a large lead planter at Sandringham in 2013 to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee, a party from the Plumbers Company led by the Master were personally thanked by the Queen in the Sitting Room.’\n\nPowerful Women\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 18th June 2014Enjoy a wonderful evening in the Old Library and the Great Hall of the historic Guildhall for a celebration on Powerful Women in Opera portrayed in some of the most wonderfully tuneful arias, choruses and orchestral interludes ever written by Verdi, Bizet, Berlioz, Bellini, Saint Saens and Ciliea. The Chelsea Opera Group, under the baton of Gianluca Marcanó, will be joined by two spectacular singers, Nelly Miricioiu (soprano) and Nino Surguladze (mezzo soprano), both of whom have sung with the Royal Opera and the Metropolitan Opera. The opera scenes will be narrated by the well-known actress Hannah Gordon. The performance will be a powerful operatic feast sandwiched between delicious bowls of food and lubricating wines that will transform a stellar evening into something quite out of the ordinary. Afterwards you can linger over wine and cheese – a perfect end to a busy week!"
