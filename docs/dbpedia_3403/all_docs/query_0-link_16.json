        "text": "It's 600 A.D. in Britain and the Saxons of Essex found a new territory called Middlesex. By this time, you have the South Saxons (Sussex), East Saxons (Essex), Middle Saxons (Middlesex), and the West Saxons (Wessex). For us in New Jersey, you'll recognize familiar names. Except for one. Why is there no Wessex County in New Jersey? When NJ was in its English-ruled infancy it was split in two, East and West Jersey. In the 1600's East Jersey formed the Counties of Bergen, Essex, Middlesex, and Monmouth. West Jersey formed Salem and Burlington. As New Jersey unified and developed new Counties, Sussex County was founded in 1753. And for anyone looking at a map, here is my glaring problem with that. Sussex being the northern-most County in the State, its name, to put it politely, is stupid considering its namesake. So stupid in fact that with it being WEST of Essex and Middlesex, naming it Wessex County is just so obvious. Also there was never a \"Norsex\" (Northern Saxon) kingdom in England, so again Wessex County make sense. Since then, Counties have been partitioned and new were Counties founded, but none were to be named Wessex. Perhaps one day we'll see it become a 22nd County in New Jersey. Oddly enough, a fictional Wessex County, New Jersey does exist and in all places it's the Friday the 13th series. Anyway, this is my short rant on why Sussex should be renamed Wessex County, and New Jersey can form a new 22nd County in South Jersey called Sussex. #NJHistory #Wessex #22ndCounty\n\nOn Tuesday (31st October) West Lindsey District Council will be in the High Court alongside Braintree District Council. They will be challenging the government's use of emergency legislation allowing the Home Office to impose asylum seeker accommodation centres in local areas bypassing normal planning and consultation procedures. In this video Cllr Sally Grindrod-Smith explains the situation and their experiences of the Home Office taking charge at RAF Scampton. We've heard similar problems from Wethersfield (Braintree) and have been experiencing them here with respect to Northeye (Bexhill, no decision yet). Common problems are a lack of information, no consultation, changes in plans and fundamentally...local people don't want these large camps in small communities. It is VERY CLEAR that the Home Office are not able to work with local communities. This legislation needs to end. The government and the Home Office need to sort out arrivals and processing...rather than introduce a third problem (large scale accommodation centres). We wish Braintree and West Lindsey all the best. Please show your support...or you could be next! https://lnkd.in/eTenk9fS\n\nIt is not often that General Counsel actually spend time listening to another General Counsel talk through their career in intimate detail. The learnings were profound - we heard so many pearls of wisdom through the power of Andrew Garard's career story including: • how to truly partner with law firms, building lasting relationships where both parties benefit; • how to practically incentivise in-house lawyers throughout their careers, actively ensuring that they leave the fold (which they inevitably will do) with a much better CV and skill set than when they arrived; • how to engage with CEOs and the C-Suite as an impactful General Counsel, working with integrity and purpose, with the requisite levers and then how to walk away when you realise the role isn't going to allow you to do this; • how to mobilise your network at both a granular and strategic level, which will set you up for a long lasting career; • how to listen to develop consistent and values driven competencies when hiring for your team; • how to seek to help, and not just to please; • how to look after your existing team as you leave and how not to burn bridges. The list goes on. If I had my way, Winmark would host a follow on session for the lucky attendees, and others who want to attend, so that we can deep dive more into the stories and the detail of how Andrew has navigated through his career. The only challenge I can imagine will be getting into Andrew's diary....... tbc! #leadership #generalcounsel #careerstories\n\nChallenging the Carceral State and Building Trust with Dr. Marya Wright In this clip, Dr. Marya Wright and Christian Ace Stettler discuss the flaws of the carceral state and explore ways to build trust and rapport with clients in a system designed to work against them. Marya emphasizes the need for systemic change and the importance of being honest and empathetic with clients. \"It's important to engage the person first, build some rapport, and get some background information to see how that shows up and shapes the discussion.\" - Marya Wright Marya also shares her approach to working within a flawed system: \"The system that I work for is set up to work against people like you. It's set up to work against a single Black father. And I'm here to just let you know that I know that and I want to make sure that you know that I know that.\" About Marya Wright Marya Wright, MSW DSW, is a distinguished social worker, consultant, educator, international trainer, and facilitator with expertise in organizational leadership, child welfare services, and curriculum development.

When it comes to advocacy on behalf of city managers and other public sector executives, the AAME will utilize earned media strategies to advocate on behalf of its members, like James Freed We will ensure that narratives reflecting the manager's perspective are communicated to the public and local elected officials. And believe me, the ICMA - International City/County Management Association hasn't cornered the market when it comes to earned media and public information campaigns. There has been much talk lately about how some prospective members of the AAME are concerned about some form of retaliation coming from the ICMA if they join the organization. I believe these fears are overblown. Such tactics would be incredibly damaging to the organization, if attempted, because the AAME would deploy a multi-faceted campaign in response. Here is a quote by AAME founder Joseph Turner from this article (https://lnkd.in/dxsmAM79) about Antil: Turner, a former city administrator and president of the newly formed American Association of Municipal Executives, of which Freed is now a member, said that it’s “hypocritical for Antil and the ICMA to hold themselves out to the world as the arbiters of what is ethical conduct for city managers when they will not even comply with court orders.” “If Antil is willing to defy a judge and obstruct the justice system, how can she be trusted to do the right thing at City Hall,” Turner said. ----- The deadline to sign up and become a founding member of the AAME has been extended to July 25th. This is truly your \"last call.\""
