        "text": "You may claim service as a full-time certified teacher in a position which requires a teaching certificate as a condition of employment; or a professional educator. Alaska BIA service may count toward vesting and retirement eligibility. The cost is based on your entry in the Alaska TRS after the service was performed. If your entry was before July 1, 1970, you will be charged 5% of base salary for each year of Alaska BIA. If your entry was after June 30, 1970, you will be charged 7% of base salary for each year of Alaska BIA and if your entry was after June 30, 1990, the charge is 8.65% of base salary.\n\nIf you receive a federal benefit based on Alaska BIA, the Alaska TRS will offset their benefits by the amount you receive in federal benefits for that service.\n\nMembers who were first hired before July 1, 1982, and have made the additional 1% contribution for one year, may provide survivor's benefits to their spouses and eligible dependent children upon their death. There are two aspects to the benefit. The first is provided if there are dependent children. The monthly benefit is equal to:\n\n35% of base salary at the time of death paid to the surviving spouse\n\n10% for each dependent child, up to a maximum of 4 children\n\n10% for each court-appointed guardian.\n\nWhen there is no longer any dependent children, the surviving spouse will receive a benefit based on 50% of the retirement benefit the member was receiving at the time of death, or 50% of the benefit the member had accrued at the time of death.\n\nYour contribution account balance and any information related to your account is available to you upon proper identification.\n\nYou can also access your account balance by visiting the myRnB website.\n\nAdministrative regulations do not allow us to release information regarding personal or financial data to anyone other than the member without the member's prior written authorization unless the inquiring party has a subpoena or a court order to secure the information. We are allowed to release the information to the member's employer, former employer, or other authorized state agency.\n\nA member's spouse or legal counsel is NOT entitled to the member's information without a properly executed release.\n\nFirst, the Division of Retirement and Benefits and the State of Alaska do not provide tax advice. Each member's tax situation is unique and you must consider the effect on your individual taxes. You should consult with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a consultant as you deem necessary.\n\nContributions placed in the TRS before January 1, 1991, are \"post-tax\" contributions. The contributions have already been taxed and you should owe no further tax on them. The interest earnings from these periods are still subject to income taxes. Both interest and contributions taken as a lump sum refund are subject to a penalty for early withdrawal.\n\nContributions and interest placed in the TRS on or after January 1, 1991, are \"pre-tax\" contributions. These contributions have not been taxed previously. Therefore, both the contributions and interest earned on these amounts are subject to income tax.\n\nIn January following the year in which a refund is made, members will receive a 1099R informational return which indicates the amount of the taxable and nontaxable portions.\n\nFor the \"pretax\" contributions, if you choose to have the refund sent directly to you at your address or to your regular account at a banking institution, the IRS requires that we withhold 20% of the taxable portion of your refund, even if you later choose to do a \"rollover\" within the 60 day rollover period. You may also be subject to an additional early withdrawal penalty if you receive the refund before age 59Â½.\n\nYou can avoid the withholding tax on the portion of your refund that you have us \"Direct Transfer\" to another qualified plan that accepts your transfer, such as an IRA. Only the taxable portion of your refund can be transferred. If your refund includes money that has already been taxed, we will refund that portion directly to you without withholding any taxes on it.\n\nGenerally, except for a few exceptions, employee contributions and other amounts held in the system are exempt from levy to enforce the collection of a debt, and are not subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, without first being received by the person entitled to the amount under the terms of the system.\n\nThe exceptions primarily include unpaid state, local, or federal taxes, a Child Support Enforcement Order for unpaid child support, and up to one month's unpaid earnings of an individual employed by a member. In addition, a member's right to receive benefits may be assigned by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as a result of a divorce or dissolution.\n\nYes! If we are forced to honor a valid attachment, a member becomes a former member and loses any rights he or she may have had as a member. Even if the attachment is for a portion of your account balance, we would be forced to refund the balance to you, since there can be no partial refunds from the system. In this instance, an involuntary refund, plus any accumulated accrued interest, may be repaid to the system to reinstate your service without becoming reemployed in a system covered position. However, if the original attachment is still in effect, any repayments will be forwarded to the appropriate agency to satisfy any amount still due.\n\nAfter receiving verification that your indebtedness has been established, you may make payments on your indebtedness directly to the Division of Retirement and Benefits either in full or with periodic payments over time.\n\nIf you intend a payment to pay off your indebtedness balance, you should contact us for the balance. You may also establish a monthly payroll deduction through your employer. We can estimate when your indebtedness would be paid in full based on the amount of deduction you set up. If you have not received verification that your indebtedness has been established, contact us. Interest on your indebtedness will continue to accrue until your indebtedness is paid in full.\n\nYes, if you qualify. To qualify for disability, you must have been in a TRS position for 5 years, for which no indebtedness is owing, and be unable to perform the usual duties of your job, or the duties of another job that an employer makes available for which you are qualified by training or education. While disabled, you will receive monthly benefits equal to 50% of your annual base salary immediately before becoming disabled (divided by 12 months). You will receive an additional 10% for each of your dependent children, if any, up to a maximum of four children.\n\nYes. Because the contributions and earning you have accumulated during your marriage are considered to be one-half the property of your spouse, the plan cannot pay you the funds until the status of your spouse's entitlement is clear. You are required to submit a court-certified copy of the divorce decree or dissolution to the plan for review. If you have been released through the divorce or dissolution, a review of the property settlement will indicate the status of your ex-spouse's share of your account.\n\nIf your ex-spouse has retained ownership of his or her share after the divorce or dissolution, the plan requires a domestic relations order (DRO) issued by the court be filed prior to any payments being made from your account. Plan staff will review the DRO to determine if it meets the requirements set out by the statutes governing the plan. If it does, it will then be qualified and the plan will implement the order.\n\nIf your account exceeds $5,000, the plan must make the payment to an adult member of the minor's family who is a court-appointed guardian, a person having custody and care of the minor or a financial institution with a federally insured savings account in the sole name of the minor. A conservatorship must be established for the minor before payments can be made.\n\nIf your account is less than $5,000, the plan may make payments without a conservatorship to the court-appointed guardian or person having custody and care of the minor or a financial institution with a federally insured savings account in the sole name of the minor.\n\nBeneficiaries are only eligible to receive the balance of your retirement account, including gains and losses, less expenses.\n\nA surviving spouse is eligible to receive a monthly survivor benefit of 40% of your monthly gross compensation at the time of your death or 50% of your monthly gross compensation if you are a peace officer/firefighter member until the time you would have reached eligibility for normal retirement.\n\nYour employer will also continue to make monthly contributions based on your salary at the time of your death to a survivor account established for your surviving spouse in the occupational death fund. At normal retirement, your survivor may withdraw the balance of this account, including gains and losses, less expenses. This fund is invested by the plan fund managers while the survivor benefit is being paid.\n\nWhile your surviving spouse is receiving monthly survivor benefits, he or she may not withdraw your DCR retirement account balance. However, your surviving spouse will be able to direct the investment of the account among the ten available options.\n\nIf you do not wish to take a distribution from your Defined Contribution retirement account, you do not have to until the IRS Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) begins. You must take your first RMD for the year in which you turn age 72. However, the first payment can be delayed until April 1 of the year after you reach the age of 72. For all subsequent years, including the year in which you were paid the first RMD by April 1, you must take the RMD by December 31 of the year.\n\nIf you are still employed in PERS/TRS DCR beyond age 72, your RMD requirements will begin after you terminate PERS/TRS employment.)\n\nIf an account owner fails to withdraw the RMD, fails to withdraw the full amount of the RMD, or fails to withdraw the RMD by the applicable deadline, the amount not withdrawn is taxed at 50%.\n\nYes. Because the contributions and earning you have accumulated during your marriage are considered to be one-half the property of your spouse, the plan cannot pay you the funds until the status of your spouse's entitlement is clear. You are required to submit a court-certified copy of the divorce decree or dissolution to the plan for review. If you have been released through the divorce or dissolution, a review of the property settlement will indicate the status of your ex-spouse's share of your account.\n\nIf your ex-spouse has retained ownership of his or her share after the divorce or dissolution, the plan requires a domestic relations order (DRO) issued by the court be filed prior to any payments being made from your account. Plan staff will review the DRO to determine if it meets the requirements set out by the statutes governing the plan. If it does, it will then be qualified and the plan will implement the order.\n\nYes.

You are required to submit a court-certified copy of the divorce decree or dissolution to the plan for review.

Plan staff will review the DRO to determine if it meets the requirements set out by the statutes governing the plan. If it does, it will then be qualified and the plan will implement the order.\n\nYou are first eligible to receive payment of your account 60 days after you have been terminated from employment. If you are re-hired before the 60-day period has passed, the withdrawal request will be canceled and a new 60-day period will begin at the next termination. However, if you terminate, and select an annuity payment, the annuity payment you are receiving will not be affected by subsequent re-employment. Partial lump sum withdrawals will cease upon re-employment. Actual payment mailing occurs after you have been terminated 60 days and the Plan administrator approves your distribution. The only exception to payment eligibility earlier than 60 days after termination is for a qualified hardship. There are very strict criteria that must be met for a hardship distribution.\n\nThe Deferred Compensation Plan allows you to voluntarily set aside a portion of your income either before it is taxed or after it has been taxed. The amount set aside, plus any change in value (interest, gains and losses), is payable to you or your beneficiary at a future date. Upon becoming eligible to participate in the Plan, you may elect to defer your income on a pre-tax or post-tax basis. By doing so, you agree to reduce your salary by an agreed-upon amount. This amount may not exceed certain requirements (outlined below).\n\nYou can access your account after you have terminated employment or there is an unforeseeable emergency (as defined by the Alaska Deferred Compensation Plan). When you qualify for a distribution, your account value may be applied to the distribution option(s) you choose. These options include:\n\nDo nothing and defer payment until you have obtained the age of Required Minimum Distribution\n\nLump-sum payment (full or partial)\n\nFive-, 10- and 15-year period certain annuity\n\nSingle life annuity\n\nSingle life annuity with 10- or 15-year period certain\n\n50% or 100% joint/survivor annuity\n\nPeriodic payment\n\nDirect rollover to an eligible retirement plan as set forth in the Alaska Deferred Compensation Plan.\n\nYou may begin receiving funds immediately or defer receipt until to any date up to April 1 of the year after attaining age 70Â½. You will be allowed to take partial distributions, and there is no limit on the number of payments that can be taken; however, if you do not receive payment of your entire account, you must maintain a minimum $1,000 account balance.\n\nThe Division of Retirement and Benefits will provide information and group seminars on leaving state employment in November. Generally speaking, employees that wish to convert leave to deferred compensation have adequate opportunity to do that in November so long as their last day of service is in December. The Governor is sworn into office at 12 noon on December 3.\n\nIf, however, you believe you will terminate state service in December, you should consider converting personal leave in November. Leave cash in requests for the month of November must be submitted to the Division by November 30.\n\nThe catch-up provision is available to employees who are within three years of their normal retirement eligibility. Special catch-up allows you to make up for contributions you could have made during previous years of state employment but didnât.\n\nThe special catch-up limit is double the regular contribution limit. For 2019, this could be up to $38,000.\n\nYou may contribute under the special catch-up provision for a maximum of three consecutive years. Once you elect to enroll in the special catch-up provision, if you do not utilize it for all three consecutive years, you cannot make up the amounts not utilized at a later time or with another employer.\n\nThe Roth 457 option for governmental deferred compensation plans was authorized by Congress effective January 1, 2011. A Roth 457 is not a Roth IRA. Neither is a Roth 457 a separate plan; it is simply a way for employees to control the taxation of their deferred wages when they are disbursed in the future. This option allows employees to elect after tax salary deferrals into a Roth option. Roth elective deferrals are accounted for separately from the pre-tax contributions made to the plan. Distributions from the Roth 457 are tax free if the contributions have been in the Roth elective deferral account for at least 5 years and the participant is at least 59 Â½.\n\nThe AlaskaCare plans limit payment of covered services to the recognized charge. The recognized charge is the maximum amount the AlaskaCare plans will pay for a covered service. Aetna and Moda/Delta Dental, and their respective network providers (sometimes referred to as participating providers), agree to a set of discounted negotiated rates for services provided. The recognized charge for network providers is the negotiated rate. For an explanation of how the recognized charge is calculated for out-of-network providers, please see the recognized charge questions under the Network and Dental sections.\n\nAn out-of-network provider has the right to bill you for the difference between the recognized charge and the actual charge. This is often referred to as balance billing. Network providers have agreed to accept, as payment in full, the negotiated charge. Therefore, you are not subject to balance billing when you use a network provider.\n\nIf your provider is not a network provider, you may ask for an estimate of charges, the codes that will be used use for billing, and the provider's zip code. When you receive this information, contact the Aetna Concierge at (855) 784-8646 or Moda/Delta Dental at (855) 718-1768. A member of the Aetna Concierge or Moda Customer Service team can review the estimated charges and will advise you if the charges fall within the recognized charge for your area. If the estimated charges exceed the recognized charge, you may request that your provider accept that amount and not balance bill you, or you may request payment arrangements with their office.\n\nIf your current provider is not listed as a network provider, you can ask your provider to contact Aetna at (800) 720-4009 or Moda at (855) 718-1768 for a participation application. Members are also encouraged to nominate their out-of-network providers to join the network. Contact the Aetna Concierge or Moda Customer Service to find out how.\n\nIn some cases, unfortunately, there will not be a network provider for the service you need in your area. The Division, Aetna and Moda/Delta Dental are working diligently to improve network access, but please understand that we cannot force providers into the network.\n\nCoordination of Benefits (COB) is a method of ensuring that people covered by more than one medical plan will receive the benefits they are entitled to but not more than 100% of their covered expenses. The AlaskaCare health plans coordinate benefits with other group health care plans to which you or your covered dependents belong. Coordination of benefits can be very confusing, even for people who work at a physician's office.\n\nWith COB, if you are covered by more than one health care plan, the plans work together to provide benefits. One plan is considered \"primary\" and pays your covered expenses first. The other plan is \"secondary\" and pays any remaining covered expenses up to 100%. In some cases, there may be a third or fourth plan, as well.\n\nIt is important to remember that not all expenses are covered expenses.\n\nIf you are diabetic or pregnant in your third trimester, the Oral Health, Total Health program offers more ways to care for your teeth and mouth.\n\nDiabetes increases the risk of cavities, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth loss, dry mouth and infection. If you have been diagnosed with this disease you are eligible for four prophylactic (preventive) cleanings or periodontal maintenance visits per year through our Oral Health, Total Health program. Protect your teeth and gums by enrolling today.\n\nPregnant women who have periodontal (gum) disease are more likely to have a premature and underweight baby. Bacteria can enter the bloodstream through the mouth, and the bodyâs response to the infection can trigger early labor. If you are expecting, you can enroll in the Oral Health, Total Health program to help prevent gum disease. If youâve already had two cleanings for the year, youâll be eligible for another cleaning or checkup during your third trimester.This added preventive (prophylactic) visit is covered regardless of normal plan frequency limits.\n\nFor details on the Oral Health, Total Health program, refer to AlaskaCare Employee Health Plan booklet or call Delta Dental Member Services at (855) 718-1768.\n\nOptum Rx will process claims according to the AlaskaCare plan document. Compounds will continue to be covered under the Defined Benefit Retiree Health plan.\n\nCoverage of compounds differs for the active employee and defined contribution retiree health plans. The AlaskaCare Employee Health Plan and AlaskaCare DCR Benefit Plan only cover compound drugs if:\n\nthe product contains at least one prescription ingredient;\n\nthe active ingredient(s) is approved by the FDA for medicinal use in the United States;\n\nthe product is not a copy of a commercially available FDA approved drug; and\n\nthe safety and effectiveness for the intended use is supported by FDA approval, or adequate medical and scientific evidence in the medical literature.\n\nOptum Rx maintains a National Compound Credentialing Program (NCCP) to ensure the best compounded medication quality and effectiveness for the patients who need personalized medications. You must fill your compounded medication prescription at a pharmacy which has been credentialed with the Optum Rx National Compound Credentialing Program (NCCP).\n\nUsing an NCCP pharmacy ensures that you will not be charged up front for your prescription (and required to submit your own claim for reimbursement), you will not be charged for molding or other non-covered charges, and you will not be charged for shipping if the pharmacy mails your compounded medication to you. You can find a list of NCCP-credentialed pharmacies here. You can also call Optum Rx at (855) 409-6999 (TTY 711) to get help locating NCCP-credentialed pharmacies.\n\nParticipants in the Consumer Choice plan will receive a HRA contribution from the state in the amount of $750.00 annually for a single employee, or $1,500.00 for a family. As long as you are enrolled in the Consumer Choice plan with the state, any unused HRA funds can rollover from year to year, for a maximum of up two years (prior benefit year and the current benefit year). Once you are no longer enrolled in the Consumer Choice plan any remaining balance in your HRA will be forfeited.\n\nFor eligible employees enrolled in the consumer choice plan, the third-party administrator will automatically apply your available HRA balance towards your annual deductible for covered medical expenses. For more information, refer to the active employee plan booklet, section 7.2 .\n\nOptum Rx will process claims according to the AlaskaCare plan document. Compounds will continue to be covered under the Defined Benefit Retiree Health plan.\n\nCoverage of compounds differs for the active employee and defined contribution retiree health plans. The AlaskaCare Employee Health Plan and AlaskaCare DCR Benefit Plan only cover compound drugs if:\n\nthe product contains at least one prescription ingredient;\n\nthe active ingredient(s) is approved by the FDA for medicinal use in the United States;\n\nthe product is not a copy of a commercially available FDA approved drug; and\n\nthe safety and effectiveness for the intended use is supported by FDA approval, or adequate medical and scientific evidence in the medical literature.\n\nOptum Rx maintains a National Compound Credentialing Program (NCCP) to ensure the best compounded medication quality and effectiveness for the patients who need personalized medications. You must fill your compounded medication prescription at a pharmacy which has been credentialed with the Optum Rx National Compound Credentialing Program (NCCP).\n\nUsing an NCCP pharmacy ensures that you will not be charged up front for your prescription (and required to submit your own claim for reimbursement), you will not be charged for molding or other non-covered charges, and you will not be charged for shipping if the pharmacy mails your compounded medication to you. You can find a list of NCCP-credentialed pharmacies here. You can also call Optum Rx at (855) 409-6999 (TTY 711) to get help locating NCCP-credentialed pharmacies.\n\nOptum Rx coordinates all the layers of coverage for you and your dependents behind the scenes, so in many cases you and your dependents can use each otherâs cards at the pharmacy. However, a non-EGWP dependent should not use the card that has a MedicareRx logo in the lower right corner. This card would only work if the pharmacist uses the correct person code (to identify them as a dependent rather than the policy holder). To avoid any confusion at the pharmacy, we recommend you and your dependents only use a card that has your name on it.\n\nCoverage for hearing aids is available under the audio benefit under the medical plan. Audio services pay a maximum benefit of $3,000 in a rolling 36-month period. A hearing aid (monaural or binaural) is a covered service if prescribed as a result of an otological (ear) or audiological (hearing) examination. This includes ear mold(s), hearing aid instrument, initial batteries, cords, and other necessary supplementary equipment as well as warranty, and follow-up consultation within 30 days following delivery of the hearing aid.\n\nIf you elect the optional vision coverage, you or your family member (including your parents or grandparents) can save 30% to 60% on the price of hearing aids through VSPâs partnership with TruHearing. For more information, call TruHearing at (866) 929-5091 Monday â Friday, 8 a.m. - 8 p.m. Alaska time. For TTY, dial 711.\n\nThe AlaskaCare Employee Health Plan is offering a new lower-premium medical plan option this year with a higher deductible than medical plans traditionally offered by AlaskaCare. The new Consumer Choice plan is a consumer driven health plan with an employer sponsored Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA).\n\nThere are several things you can do to ensure you get the most value from your plan.\n\nUsing \"network\" providers can provide substantial benefits to members through the elimination of what's known as \"balance billing.\" It can also generate substantial savings to members through negotiated provider discounts. To find out whether your doctor is a member of the Aetna network, call Aetna's Health Concierge at (855) 784-8646 or visit the Find a Doctor page .\n\nGet recommended preventive checkups, screenings, vaccines, prenatal care, and contraceptives. You wonât have to pay out-of-pocket for these preventive visits, when provided in network, and getting regular exams and screenings will help you live healthier. For a list of covered preventative services visit the Preventative Care Coverage Information Flyer and the Womenâs Preventive Care Coverage Information Flyer .\n\nUse generic drugs when available. Generic drugs offer you a safe and effective alternative to brand name drugs - but at a lesser cost. Choosing a lower tiered drug when it is appropriate can provide access to the necessary medications to stay healthy, at a cost that is more affordable.\n\nThe employee contributions and any net market gains or losses of the PERS or TRS DCR account balance will be transferred to pay the cost of conversion. If any PERS or TRS DCR employee balance remains after the outstanding conversion indebtedness balance(s) are paid, the remaining balance will be refunded to the member by Empower Retirement.\n\nEmployer match contributions and any attributable gains and losses are not eligible to be utilized by the member to pay the cost of conversion. Employer contributions made on the memberâs behalf will be transferred to the defined benefit plan to fund the lifetime future benefit that the member will receive from the fund as well as the system paid medical benefits that the member may be eligible for in retirement.\n\nThis means, if, as a result of service credit claimed (reinstatement indebtedness or conversion cost not paid in full in this case) for which there is an indebtedness existing at retirement, the benefit is actuarially reduced by a factor spreading the remaining indebtedness balance out over the anticipated lifetime of the benefit. If applying an actuarial reduction reduces your benefit below what it would have been had the claimed service and associated indebtedness not existed, then the claimed service and indebtedness will be removed from your final retirement benefit calculation. Service associated with a Reinstatement indebtedness (REI) or Conversion indebtedness that has an outstanding balance will not count towards vesting or service eligibility (i.e. 20 or 30 years)."
