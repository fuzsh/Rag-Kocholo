        "text": "Court staff\n\nJudge\n\nThe judge ensures your application progresses and helps the parties to reach an agreement by themselves. If this isn’t possible, they’ll decide the outcome of Family Court cases. Inside the courtroom, they will usually sit at the front bench and wear black robes.

One of their main jobs is to help manage your case at court. This includes processing applications and making sure the judge has everything they need for the hearing, like special court reports or affidavits. They’ll sit next to the judge in the courtroom and are often on their computers updating the court record as the case progresses.\n\nKaiārahi\n\nKaiārahi (Family Court Navigators) help by providing information, guidance, and support. The Kaiārahi are a free service, but they don’t give legal advice.\n\nKaiārahi can help you with advice before you come to the Family Court.

For example, they will:\n\nappoint the Lawyer for Child\n\nappoint Lawyer for Subject Person\n\nappoint a Lawyer to Assist the Court\n\narrange a professional Supervised Contact provider\n\nget reports from psychologists or social workers\n\narrange a communication assistant\n\nmake referrals to non-violence programmes.\n\nSome services don’t have to be ordered by a judicial officer. For example, you can ask to attend a safety programme for adults and children.\n\nFamily Court Coordinators can help you with:\n\nquestions about the Family Court and making an application\n\nquestions you may have about a service you have been ordered to attend\n\nany concerns or complaints you may have about a Family Court appointed provider.\n\nSafety programmes for adults and children\n\nTo contact a Family Court Coordinator, freephone the Ministry of Justice 0800 268 787.\n\nCourt Security\n\nCourt security are usually the first people you will see when you arrive at the court. They wear black and white uniforms and are there to keep everyone safe.\n\nIf you need security support or feel unsafe while at the court, let court staff know as soon as possible.\n\nLawyers\n\nLawyer\n\nA lawyer is someone who can help you with your case. The other parties in your case may also have a lawyer. A lawyer can:\n\ngive you legal advice\n\nhelp you fill in forms for the court\n\nrepresent you at a case conference or hearing\n\nLawyer for Subject Person\n\nA subject person is someone who’s no longer able to manage their property and welfare decisions for themselves because they have lost mental capacity. If a person doesn’t have an Enduring Power of Attorney, an application needs to be made to the Family Court under the Protection of Personal Property and Rights Act 1988. A registrar or judge must appoint a Lawyer for Subject Person, unless that person already has a lawyer.\n\nA Lawyer for Subject Person’s role is to represent the subject person and make sure the court has all the relevant information to make the best decision possible for the person. The lawyer will usually meet with the person and contact whānau or other people involved in that person’s care. The lawyer will file a report with the court.\n\nLawyer for Child\n\nA Lawyer for Child represents your child. The judge will decide if a Lawyer for Child is needed. Because children don’t usually go into Family Court, the Lawyer for Child will make sure your child’s best interests are considered by the judge. They’ll listen to your child’s views, if they have any, and tell the judge what they believe will be best for your child given your situation.\n\nThey often meet with your child before the court hearing. They’ll usually file a report saying what your child’s views are and any other relevant information. The Lawyer for Child can’t give you any legal advice. They’re involved in the case to act for the child in a way they consider promotes your child’s welfare and best interests and to make sure any views your child has are communicated to the court. A Lawyer for Child will also help parties to reach an agreement themselves where possible.\n\nLawyer to Assist the Court\n\nA judge may decide to appoint a Lawyer to Assist the Court. This could be because someone is struggling with the court process, or there are complex legal issues that need explaining to everyone involved in the case.\n\nFor example, a Lawyer to Assist might be appointed to:\n\nhelp someone that is unrepresented understand a complex report - such as a psychologist report\n\nexplain information to the court that requires the knowledge and skills of a lawyer\n\ncarry out the role of asking the applicant the respondent’s questions in a family violence hearing if the respondent is unrepresented – this is to protect the applicant.\n\nYou may have to pay back some of the cost of a Lawyer for Child or a Lawyer to Assist the Court. This is called a Cost Contribution Order.\n\nCost contribution orders\n\nSupport in the courtroom\n\nSupport Person\n\nIf the judge gives you permission, you can bring a support person into the court room with you. However, your support person must leave the court room if, at any time, the judge asks them to.\n\nA support person is there to provide you with emotional support. They can’t participate in the proceedings or sit next to you. They’ll have to sit at the back of the courtroom. You can ask the judge if the support person can sit next to you (instead of at the back of the court room).\n\nIf you’d like to bring a support person into the courtroom, talk to your lawyer or court staff.\n\nLay Assistant (McKenzie Friend)\n\nA lay assistant can support you in court by helping you take notes. Sometimes this role is called a McKenzie Friend. They usually don’t talk to anyone other than you. A lay assistant isn’t usually a qualified lawyer. For example, you might ask a friend who knows a lot about the Family Court because they have been to court.\n\nApply for a lay assistant\n\nCommunication assistance\n\nCommunication assistants can help people who have:\n\ntrouble reading\n\ntrouble understanding words\n\nan intellectual or learning disability\n\nautism\n\nany other neurodiversity.\n\nAnyone involved in your case can ask for a communication assistant. Often a judge or lawyer will request one. You should let the court know as soon as possible if you have difficulty communicating and ask for a communication assistant.\n\nInterpreters\n\nFamily Court hearings are in English. If English is not your first language, you can ask the court for an interpreter. Interpreters listen to what people are saying in English and translate it into a language that you can understand. They will also translate what you say into English, so the other people in the courtroom can understand what you want.\n\nInterpreters and communication assistance\n\nLitigation guardian\n\nA litigation guardian is a trusted person appointed to represent someone else in a Family Court case when that person lacks the capacity to represent themselves. For example, the person has an intellectual disability, or they are under 18 years old. A judge can decide to appoint someone as a litigation guardian at any time during a Family Court case."
