        "text": "Rank: Advanced Member\n\nJoined: 7/8/2010\n\nPosts: 30,108\n\nNeurons: 125,600\n\nTradesmen are people who are people who make things and provide services, but not the professions.\n\nSo, builders, smiths, tailors, tanners, food sellers etc.\n\nThere are guilds, which are like professional bodies for that trade, and corporations. You can become a freemen of a corporation - it is a senior position and comes with rights and duties.\n\nEg Freemen of trade companies in Durham\n\nQuote:\n\nOur Story\n\nThe Freemen of Durham today has eight trade guilds or companies. There were sixteen but eight have ceased to survive. The remaining guilds are the Barbers, Butchers, Cordwainers, Curriers, Drapers, Joiners, Masons and Plumbers. The oldest recorded, now defunct, was the Weavers Guild whose records go back to 1450 but it is believed that some guilds could have been a hundred years older.\n\nThe Guilds had significant power as they controlled much of the commercial and economic life in the city. They were responsible for the training of apprentices and monitoring the standards of workmanship.\n\nThe Freemen of Durham City have always been closely linked with the freemen of the city's guilds or trade companies. Freemen of the guilds have always been freemen of Durham City, and indeed it is usually essential for a man (and now woman) to be admitted as a freeman of a guild before the freedom of the city can be conferred on him, although honorary freemen of the city have been created from time to time without going through this process; the latter do not enjoy the same privileges as ordinary freemen.\n\nThe charters which gave the guilds their authority were overseen by various Bishops of Durham who could impose fines if they failed to fulfil their duties according to rules and regulations. Over the years liberal legislation has weakened the political and trading privileges of the guilds but they are still active in the welfare of the city.\n\nThe Guild members at that time were also responsible for electing the city’s mayor. (First mayor of the city was elected in 1602). Their influence was enhanced further when Durham had its first MP elected by the Freemen in 1672.\n\nQualification for admission as a freeman of a trade company is generally achieved either by \"patrimony\" or by \"servitude\", i.e. by being the son, as a rule the eldest son, of a freeman, or by serving an apprenticeship, usually of seven years, to a freeman working at the trade of his guild. Occasionally companies have also admitted \"gentlemen freemen\", whose influence might be helpful to the guild.\n\nA by-law of 1728 attempted to curb the fraudulent creation of freemen by stipulating that applications for admission to the freedom or \"freelage\" of the trade companies and the city could only be accepted if \"called\" and approved at three different \"guilds\". These were quarterly assemblies of the mayor and aldermen of the city of Durham and borough of Framwellgate together with the wardens and stewards of the city guilds. The system of admission through \"guilds\" still prevails.\n\nToday, the freemen retain privileges which include the right of Herbage on an area of Durham called the Sands, the right to hold meetings in the Guildhall and the right to have a stall in the market free of charge.\n\n2012 has seen the introduction of Women Freemen and subsequently membership has risen to a new high.\n\nthe City of London (different from the general city of London) is a Corporation. It owns land forming Epping Forest and a bit of land under what is now Heathrow Airport. Freemen of that Corporation have certain rights, such as the right to drive geese over London Bridge.\n\nQuote:\n\nThe Freedom of the City of London was, in the earliest times, an essential requirement for all who wished to carry on business and prosper in trade with in the Square Mile. As a result, the privileges attaching to the Freedom were eagerly sought, while the duties and obligations of freemen were faithfully observed.\n\nThe close connection between freemen and London's government can be traced back to the Saxon folkmoot and to the 'Great Concourse' of the early Norman kings. As London grew, its population, trade and craft industries expanded to such an extent that it became impossible for all freemen to be directly involved in determining the evolving structure of local government. As a result, the relationship between freemen and the government of London changed to representation through the Masters and Wardens of the Guilds and Livery companies.\n\nThe Freedom of the City has never been the prerogative of men alone. Ancient reports from Livery companies bear reference to 'Sisters', a fact which indicates that men and women were equally eligible for membership.\n\nIt remains necessary to this day for all liverymen to be freemen of the City, and it is the liverymen who elect the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs of the Corporation of London. Although it is no longer necessary to be a freeman to work in the City, the proud history of the City of London is such that large numbers of men and women have rightly regarded it a privilege to be admitted to the Freedom of the City.\n\nFreedom of the City of London is only granted by the City of London, which also holds an extensive archive and library of historical records.\n\nFor further information on applying for the Freedom of the City: email dave.hollander@cityoflondon.gov.uk or call the Chamberlain’s Court on 020 7332 3055\n\nWhen you have been admitted as a Freeman of the City of London you may apply for membership of the Guild of Freemen. If you have not yet attended your admission ceremony you can still apply to join the Guild but your membership can only be considered by the Court when your admission has been confirmed by the Chamberlain's Court.\n\nIf you are not yet a Freeman of the City of London and would like to join the Guild please email the Clerk\n\nQuote:\n\nThe City of London Corporation\n\nBased in Guildhall, the City Corporation looks after and promotes the City of London. It is headed by the Lord Mayor with the Court of Common Council being its main decision-making body. We are a uniquely diverse organisation, with a role that goes beyond that of an ordinary local authority. We have our own government (the oldest in the country with origins pre-dating Parliament), our own Lord Mayor and independent police force.\n\nThese are quotes about the current situation but include historical points. I couldn't find good succinct historical websites on a quick search, but I am sure they exist.\n\nThere were trade guilds or companies for all the trades, and merchant guilds or companies. A union, basically.\n\nEg one example I know of because a school near where I lived was the Skinners' School. Skinning was a trade, separate from furriers, and from other trades such as tanners, dyers, leather makers, saddlers, cobblers, etc.\n\nQuote:\n\nThe Skinners' Company is one of the Great Twelve livery companies.\n\nWe are incorporated by a Royal Charter of 1327 and run eight schools, almshouses and charities. We have a long tradition of charitable giving and encourage all members to contribute to the Company in any way they can.\n\nThe Company has about 1,400 members - apprentices, the Freedom, the Livery and the Court. Our mission is to foster education and training, house the elderly, assist people in need and to support charitable causes, and to those ends support the fellowship of the Company.\n\nGoldsmiths College, University of London is a college founded by the Worshipful Complany of Goldsmiths. They would be artisans, not tradesmen.\n\nNow these are more open philanthropic organisations but in those times entry would be through the well-defined apprenticeship to master goldsmith career path.\n\nQuote:\n\nOur members are the lifeblood of the Company, made up of approximately 1,400 Freemen and 360 Liverymen and Associates.\n\nMembership\n\nOur Membership\n\nMore than half the membership of the Company comprises people engaged in the trade, which includes silversmiths and jewellers as well as those in allied areas such as design, retail and auction. The remainder of the membership incorporates a broad range of backgrounds and experience, with industry, commerce, education and the arts well represented.\n\nThe Company’s affairs are regulated by the Court of Assistants (our Board), whose members chair a variety of Committees consisting of liverymen and freemen. A permanent staff headed by the Clerk (CEO) runs the Company on a day-to-day basis for the Court.\n\nAs with most other Livery Companies, the membership is made up of Freemen, Liverymen, and Assistants.\n\nFreemen\n\nFreemen, of whom there are over 1,400 in total, enter the Company by one of three routes:\n\nBy Service – on completion of an indentured apprenticeship to a master who is a freeman. The apprentice will have had to bring his or her 'masterpiece' to the Hall for inspection by the Wardens.\n\nBy Patrimony – for any person born after the date of a parent's freedom, having attained the age of 25 and been elected by a Selection Committee.\n\nBy Redemption – by application and on paying an entrance fee, having been elected by a Selection Committee.\n\nRank: Advanced Member\n\nJoined: 9/19/2018\n\nPosts: 1,000\n\nNeurons: 16,305\n\nthar yazdı:\n\nTradesmen are people who are people who make things and provide services, but not the professions.\n\nSo, builders, smiths, tailors, tanners, food sellers etc.\n\nThere are guilds, which are like professional bodies for that trade, and corporations.
