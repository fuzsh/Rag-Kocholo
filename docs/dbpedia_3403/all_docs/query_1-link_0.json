        "text": "A court of assistants is a council of members belonging to a professional, trade, craft or livery companies.\n\nThe term originated among the London livery companies, as 'certain senior members who manage the affairs of the City of London Companies',[1] but may also be used by other trade associations. A court of assistants usually comprises the governing body of such organisations, and may include the officials, as in the case of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers founded in 1631: \"The governing body of the Company is the Court of Assistants, comprising the Master, three Wardens and not less than ten Assistants.\"[2]\n\nAnother example is the Honourable Artillery Company, which has an annual General Court open to all members: it meets in March to elect 20 Assistants. The company is governed in its civil and financial affairs by the Court of Assistants, which was first established in 1633.[3]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
