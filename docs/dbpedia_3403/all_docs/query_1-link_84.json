The Board shall adopt a policy regarding applicants requiring non-standard testing accommodations pursuant to section 12.05 of this Rule. An applicant requesting non-standard testing accommodations shall complete and submit the documents prescribed by the Board by the application deadline set forth in section 3.03 of this Rule, except when the disability first occurs after the filing deadline. Because the forms and procedures are detailed, requiring the applicant to attach statements from law school officials and treating professionals, any applicant requesting non-standard testing conditions is encouraged to request, complete, and submit the application for admission by examination and the necessary request for non-standard testing and related forms to the Board as early as possible to permit an evaluation of the request. To the extent practicable, any accommodations requested shall be consistent with the security and integrity of the examination. The Board may transmit the application for non-standard testing or refer the applicant to an appropriate professional selected by the Board for assessment and recommendations regarding the accommodation to grant. By submitting a request for non-standard testing, the applicant agrees to the release of the application to an appropriate professional and agrees to appear for assessment, if requested to do so by the Board.\n\nARTICLE IV. THE EXAMINATION\n\nSec. 4.01.

The Structure of the Examination.\n\nThe Board shall test applicants by administering the UBE prepared by the National Conference of Bar Examiners which consists of six Multistate Essay Examination questions, two Multistate Performance Test questions, and the 200 multiple choice question Multistate Bar Examination. The Board may contract with the National Conference of Bar Examiners or others to provide test materials.\n\nSec. 4.03. The Dates and Places of Giving the Examination.\n\nThe examination shall be given in February and July of each year at any one or more of the following places: Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga and Knoxville, provided an examination is held at least once a year in each of the three grand divisions. The Court, in its discretion, may substitute another location in the same grand division for a city named in the preceding sentence.\n\nSec. 4.04. Reserved.\n\nSec. 4.05. Re-examination.\n\nAn applicant who is unsuccessful on the examination may apply for re-examination by completing the application process under section 3.01 and paying the required fee. After the deadline for completion of the application process, the Board, in its discretion, will determine whether an applicant who has failed the bar examination will be permitted to take another examination.\n\nSec. 4.06. Effect of Taking Examination on Eligibility for Admission.\n\nThe fact that an applicant is allowed to take the examination shall not preclude further inquiries, investigation or proceedings with respect to the other criteria for admission under this Rule.\n\nSec. 4.07. Grading the Examination and Score Expiration.\n\n(a) The Board shall continue to maintain procedures which assure that the identity of each applicant in the grading process is not known to any person having responsibility for grading or determining whether the applicant passes or fails until the grades of all applicants have been finally determined.\n\n(b) The minimum bar examination score required for a successful examination will be adopted as a statement of policy and approved by the Supreme Court pursuant to section 12.05 of this Rule.\n\n(c) Bar examination scores earned in Tennessee, whether by means of the former Tennessee bar examination or the UBE, are valid to determine eligibility for licensing for three years after the date grades are released. The scores expire after three years. A UBE score transferred to Tennessee is valid for three years from the date grades were released in Tennessee for the exam administration for which the score was earned unless the UBE score can be used for admission under section 3.05(b). A UBE score that was earned five or more years from the date grades were released in Tennessee for the exam administration for which the score was earned is not valid for admission to Tennessee.\n\n(d) In order for an applicant by examination or transferred UBE score to be determined eligible for licensing pursuant to section 9.01, a score equal to or greater than that required by Tennessee on the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (\"MPRE\") must be achieved no more than two years before earning a qualifying UBE score that is being used for admission in Tennessee under sections 3.01 or 3.05 of this Rule; provided, however, that an applicant who:\n\n(1) is licensed by examination in another state in the United States, the District of Columbia or a U.S. Territory;\n\n(2) provides certification that the license is active and in good standing; and\n\n(3) achieved a score equal to or greater than the score required by Tennessee on the MPRE two or more years before successful completion of the Tennessee bar examination\n\nmay provide proof of the earlier score to satisfy the MPRE requirement. It is the responsibility of the applicant to cause MPRE score reports to be furnished to the Board. The minimum MPRE score will be adopted as a statement of policy and approved by the Supreme Court pursuant to section 12.05 of this Rule.\n\n4.08 Voluntary Withdrawal from the Examination\n\n(a) An applicant may withdraw from the examination at any time prior to the start of the examination by providing written notice of withdrawal from the examination to the Board.\n\n(b)Once the examination begins, an applicant may withdraw from the examination by written notice to the Board or by failing to appear at any session of the examination.\n\n(c) An applicant who fails to appear for a session of the examination will be withdrawn from the exam and not be permitted to appear for any subsequent session of the examination.\n\n(d) No one may withdraw from the examination after completing all sections of theexamination.\n\n(e) Refund of fees is permitted only to the extent provided in section 11.03 of this Rule.\n\nARTICLE V.

Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 5.5(b)(1).\n\n(b) Diploma Privilege. An applicant who was admitted and licensed to practice in another state pursuant to a “diploma privilege,” which exempts an applicant from taking a bar examination, and who has not been admitted by examination or transferred UBE score in any other state in the United States, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. Territory in which the applicant is in good standing, may seek a waiver of subsection (a)(2) by filing a petition with the Board as provided in section 13.02, setting forth the reasons why the applicant should be admitted to practice law in Tennessee. The petition shall include information upon which the Board can assess the applicant's reputation, character, knowledge, skills and abilities.

For the purpose of this section and section 10.03 herein, Experiential Learning Program means an academic program administered by a law school through which a law student may enroll for academic credit in a law clinic or field placement course.\n\n(1) A law clinic offered through an Experiential Learning Program provides substantial lawyering experience that involves advising or representing one or more actual clients or serving as a third-party neutral, and includes the following:\n\n(A) direct supervision of the student’s performance by a law school faculty member;\n\n(B) opportunities for performance, feedback from a faculty member, and self-evaluation; and\n\n(C) a classroom instructional component, regularly scheduled tutorials, or other means of ongoing, contemporaneous, faculty-guided reflection.\n\n(2) A field placement course offered through an Experiential Learning Program provides substantial lawyering experience that is reasonably similar to the experience of a lawyer advising or representing a client or engaging in other lawyering tasks in a setting outside a law clinic under the supervision of a licensed attorney or an individual otherwise qualified to supervise, and includes the following:\n\n(A) direct supervision of the student’s performance by a faculty member or field placement site supervisor;\n\n(B) opportunities for performance, feedback from either a faculty member or a field placement site supervisor, and self-evaluation;\n\n(C) a written understanding among the student, faculty member, and a person in authority at the field placement that describes both the substantial lawyering experience and opportunities for performance, feedback and self-evaluation; and the respective roles of faculty and any field placement site supervisor in supervising the student and in assuring the educational quality of the experience for the student, including a clearly articulated method of evaluating the student’s academic performance;\n\n(D) a method for selecting, training, evaluating and communicating with field placement site supervisors, including regular contact between the faculty and field placement site supervisors through in-person visits or other methods of communication that will assure the quality of the student educational experience;\n\n(E) a classroom instructional component, regularly scheduled tutorials, or other means of ongoing, contemporaneous, faculty-guided reflection;\n\n(F) evaluation of each student’s educational achievement by a faculty member; and\n\n(G) sufficient control of the student experience to ensure that the requirements set forth in section 10.02(a)(2)(A)-(F) are met.\n\n(b) Approval of Experiential Learning Programs. The Board shall review a law school’s Experiential Learning Program as the basis for a recommendation to the Supreme Court. Approval of the Experiential Learning Program is a prerequisite for the approval of law students who are practicing under section 10.03 in an experiential earning setting. The criteria that serve as a basis for approval shall be:\n\n(1) that the law school is approved under section 17.01 of this Rule;\n\n(2) that if the law school has an in-house legal clinic which directly represents clients, that the program has either an attorney licensed to practice and in good standing in Tennessee or an attorney approved for limited practice as provided in paragraph (d), below, who directs the clinic and who is employed by or associated with the law school; and\n\n(3) that the law school’s Experiential Learning Program is otherwise operated in a manner consistent with the requirements of this Rule.\n\n(c) The Supreme Court must approve a law school’s Experiential Learning Program, based on a recommendation from the Board, before any law student may practice under section 10.03 in an experiential learning setting. Certification of an Experiential Learning Program may be withdrawn by the Supreme Court upon recommendation of the Board if the program ceases to meet the foregoing criteria.\n\n(d) Attorneys in Experiential Learning Law School Programs. An attorney who is employed by or associated with an ABA-accredited or Tennessee-Approved Law School as faculty for the Experiential Learning Program may be admitted to practice on a limited basis before the courts of this State on behalf of the Experiential Learning Program. The attorney must establish to the satisfaction of the Board that the attorney:\n\n(1) is a member of a court of last resort of another state, a U.S. Territory or the District of Columbia;\n\n(2) submits a certificate from the court of last resort referenced in (d)(1) certifying that the attorney is a member in good standing at the bar of that court;\n\n(3) has not been denied admission to practice in any jurisdiction, including Tennessee;\n\n(4) submits a statement signed by the dean of the law school where the attorney is employed or associated in a verifying employment; and\n\n(5) has paid all required fees.\n\n(e) The Supreme Court, upon the recommendation of the Board that the attorney satisfies all the requirements of paragraph (d), shall enter an order authorizing the attorney to practice in connection with an approved Experiential Learning Program. Upon the entry of the Court’s order, the Board shall provide the attorney with a certificate of admission.\n\n(f) Admission to practice under this section shall cease upon the first of the following to occur:\n\n(1) after two years from the date of admission under this section, except in the discretion of the Supreme Court in special situations for good cause shown, provided that attorneys who wish to continue to practice in this State must seek admission under sections 3.01 (by examination), 3.05 (by transferred UBE score) or 5.01 (without examination) of this Rule so that they are eligible for licensing before the expiration of the two-year period. Time in practice pursuant to this section will count as “active practice of law” for purposes of admission pursuant to section 3.05(b) or 5.01; or\n\n(2) cessation of the attorney’s employment by or association with the law school, notice of which will be provided to the Board by the law school dean within ten days of the attorney’s cessation of employment or association with the law school.\n\n(g) Attorneys admitted to practice under this section are subject to the Rules of Professional Conduct and may be disciplined as provided for in Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 9.\n\nSec. 10.03. Law Student Practice.\n\n(a) Purpose.

Conditional Admission.\n\n(a) Definition. An applicant whose previous conduct or behavior would or might result in a denial of admission may be admitted to the practice of law on a conditional basis (\"Conditional Admission\") in accordance with this Rule. The Board shall recommend relevant conditions in a confidential order (the \"Conditional Admission Order\") relative to the conduct or the cause of such conduct with which the applicant must comply during the period of conditional admission. The Board may order Conditional Admission to permit an applicant to practice law while the applicant's continued participation in an ongoing course of treatment, remediation, or other monitoring for previous misconduct or evidence of unfitness is monitored to protect the public.\n\n(b) Requirements for Issuance of Conditional Admission Order.\n\n(1) The Board may issue a Show Cause Order pursuant to section 13.01 in order to establish whether Conditional Admission is appropriate for an applicant who has engaged in conduct or otherwise demonstrated to the Board that the applicant may not presently meet the applicable Character and Fitness Standard under section 6.01.\n\n(2) The Board may consent to entry of an Agreed Conditional Admission Order for an applicant based on the applicant's record and the recommendation of qualified professionals, when appropriate, and the determination that the applicant currently satisfies all requirements for admission and the applicable Character and Fitness Standard under section 6.01 while engaged in a sustained and effective course of treatment, remediation, or monitoring. The Agreed Conditional Admission Order shall include the terms and conditions with which the applicant must comply and must be signed by the applicant and the Executive Director on behalf of the Board.\n\n3) A Show Cause Order issued under paragraph (c)(1) may be resolved without hearing under paragraph (c)(2), above, upon the filing of a response that demonstrates the applicant satifies the applicable character and fitness standard and meets the requirements of a sustained and effective course of treatment, remediation or monitoring.\n\n(c) Conditions. The Board in its discretion may condition an applicant’s admission by requiring compliance with conditions that are designed to detect behavior that could render the applicant unfit to practice law and to protect the clients and the public, The conditions shall be tailored to detect and deter conduct, conditions or behavior which could render an applicant unfit to practice law or pose a risk to clients or the public and to encourage continued abstinence, treatment, remediation, counseling, or other support. The conditions should be established on the basis of clinical or other appropriate evaluations, take into consideration the recommendations of qualified professionals, when appropriate, and protect the privacy interests of the conditionally admitted lawyer to professional treatment records to the extent possible. The terms shall be set forth in a (“Conditional Admission Order”). The Conditional Admission Order shall be made a part of the conditionally admitted lawyer’s application file and shall remain confidential, except as provided in this and any other applicable rules. Upon entry of the Conditional Admission Order and completion of all eligibility requirements, the Board shall issue the Temporary Certificate of Eligibility for Admission pursuant to section 9.01 of this Rule. The Board shall have no further authority once a conditionally admitted lawyer is admitted to practice law in Tennessee.\n\n(d) Notification to the Board of Professional Responsibility. Immediately upon issuance of a Conditional Admission Order, the Board shall transmit a copy of the order to the Board of Professional Responsibility. If the Board of Professional Responsibility or any other jurisdiction’s disciplinary authority receives a complaint alleging unprofessional conduct by the conditionally admitted lawyer, or if the Monitoring Authority designated pursuant to paragraph (f) notifies the Board of Professional Responsibility of substantial noncompliance with the Conditional Admission Order, the Board of Professional Responsibility shall request a copy of relevant portions of the lawyer’s bar application file, and the Board shall promptly provide the requested materials to the Board of Professional Responsibility.\n\n(e) Length of Conditional Admission. The conditional admission period shall be set in the Conditional Admission Order, but shall not exceed sixty months, unless notification of substantial noncompliance with the Conditional Admission Order has been received by the Board of Professional Responsibility or a complaint of unprofessional conduct has been made against the conditionally admitted lawyer with the Board of Professional Responsibility or any other lawyer disciplinary authority.\n\n(f) Compliance with Conditional Admission Order. During the conditional admission period, the Monitoring Authority shall be the Tennessee Lawyer Assistance Program, unless a different monitoring authority, such as a practice monitor, is assigned in the Conditional Admission Order, with the consent of the Board of Professional Responsibility. The Monitoring Authority shall take such action as is necessary to monitor compliance with the terms of the Conditional Admission Order, including, but not limited to, requiring that the conditionally admitted lawyer submit written verification of compliance with the conditions, appear before the Monitoring Authority, and provide information requested by the Monitoring Authority.\n\n(g) Costs of Conditional Admission. The applicant shall be responsible for any direct costs of investigation, testing and monitoring. Other costs shall be borne in accord with this Rule or any other applicable Tennessee Supreme Court Rule.\n\n(h) Failure to Fulfill the Terms of Conditional Admission. Failure of a conditionally admitted lawyer to fulfill the terms of a Conditional Admission Order may result in a modification of the Conditional Admission Order which may include extension of the period of conditional admission, suspension or revocation of the Conditional Admission Order, or such other action as may be appropriate under Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 9, including temporary suspension pursuant to Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 9, § 12.3. The Monitoring Authority shall promptly notify the Board of Professional Responsibility whenever it determines that the conditionally admitted lawyer is in substantial noncompliance with the terms of the Conditional Admission Order. Notification of such noncompliance by the Monitoring Authority shall automatically extend the conditional admission until disposition of the matter by the Board of Professional Responsibility and any resulting appeals.\n\n(i) Violation of Conditional Admission Order. The Board of Professional Responsibility shall initiate proceedings to determine whether the conditional admission should be revoked, extended or modified by filing a petition to review conditional admission. Consideration and disposition of any such petition shall follow the procedure for formal proceedings as set forth in Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 9; however, the only issue to be determined is whether the conditional admission should be revoked, extended or modified. Any decision to extend or modify the Conditional Admission Order must be made in consultation with the Monitoring Authority. If the conditionally admitted attorney was temporarily suspended due to substantial noncompliance with a monitoring agreement, any disposition of the petition to review conditional admission may include dissolution of the temporary suspension.\n\n(j) Expiration of Conditional Admission Order. Unless the Conditional Admission Order is revoked or extended as provided herein, upon completion of the period of conditional admission, the conditions imposed by the Conditional Admission Order shall expire. The Monitoring Authority shall notify the Board of Professional Responsibility of such expiration.\n\n(k) Confidentiality. Except as otherwise provided herein, and unless the Supreme Court orders otherwise, the fact that an individual is conditionally admitted and the terms of the Conditional Admission Order shall be confidential provided that the applicant shall disclose the entry of any Conditional Admission Order to the admissions authority in any jurisdiction where the applicant applies for admission to practice law. In addition to ensuring that the relevant records of the Board, the Board of Professional Responsibility and the Tennessee Lawyer Assistance Program are confidential, the Board shall use reasonable efforts to structure the terms and conditions of the conditional admission so that the conditional admission does not pose a significant risk to confidentiality. These provisions for confidentiality shall not prohibit or restrict the ability of the applicant to disclose to third parties that the applicant has been conditionally admitted under this Rule, nor prohibit requiring third-party verification of compliance with the terms of the Conditional Admission Order by admission authorities in jurisdictions to which the conditionally admitted lawyer may subsequently apply.\n\n(l) Education. The Board shall make information about its conditional admission process publicly available and shall reasonably cooperate with the Tennessee Lawyer Assistance Program in its efforts to educate law students, law school administrators and applicants for bar admission regarding the nature and extent of chemical abuse, dependency, and mental health concerns that affect law students and lawyers.\n\n(m) Disciplinary Complaints. The provisions of this section shall not affect the authority of the Board of Professional Responsibility, pursuant to Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 9, to investigate a complaint filed against a conditionally admitted lawyer by a person or entity other than the Monitoring Authority, to recommend a disposition of such complaint or to initiate a formal disciplinary proceeding as to such complaint, pursuant to Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 9, § 15.\n\nExplanatory Comments\n\n1) Some examples of when Conditional Admission may be used to show that applicant satisfies the Character and Fitness Standard under "
