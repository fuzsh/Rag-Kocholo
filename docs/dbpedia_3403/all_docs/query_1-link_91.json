        "text": "Why is jury duty important?\n\nThe United States Constitution and the Alabama State Constitution guarantees all people the right to trial by an impartial jury. Justice ultimately depends in large measure on the jurors who serve in our courts.\n\nWhat is my duty as a juror?\n\nAs a juror, you must be fair and impartial. Your actions and decisions must be free of any bias or prejudice. You must apply the law given by the judge to the facts given during the trial to make a decision in a case.\n\nHow was I selected for jury duty?\n\nYou were selected at random from lists of voter registrations of Montgomery County.\n\nWho is eligible for jury duty?\n\nJurors must:\n\nBe a citizen of the United States.\n\nBe over 19 years of age.\n\nBe a 12-month resident of the county.\n\nBe able to communicate in the English language.\n\nYou cannot serve on a jury if you have been convicted of a felony and your civil rights have not been restored.\n\nIf you are in doubt about your eligibility for jury service, you may contact the Jury Coordinator by mail or telephone:\n\nMail: Court Administrator\n\nMontgomery County Courthouse\n\nPO Box 1667\n\nMontgomery, AL 35104-1667\n\nPhone: (334) 832-2531 or (334) 832-2564\n\nHow long does jury duty last?\n\nService as a juror depends upon many factors, one of which is the type and complexity of the case. Rarely does service exceed five work days.\n\nWho can be excused from jury service?\n\nVery few people are excused from jury duty. Jurors will be excused only upon a demonstration of undue hardship or extreme inconvenience or for other reasons provided by law.\n\nCan jury duty be rescheduled?\n\nYes. If you have not been previously rescheduled your turn of service can be deferred to a more convenient time. Contact the Court Administrator's office by telephone or email. Have several alternate dates selected when you make your request. You can also submit your requests in writing to:\n\nMail: Court Administrator\n\nMontgomery County Courthouse\n\nPO Box 1667\n\nMontgomery, AL 36102-1667\n\nWhat type of cases are heard by jurors?\n\nJurors may be selected for criminal cases ranging from traffic offenses to murder as well as civil cases.\n\nAre jurors paid for jury service?\n\nJurors are paid $10 each day they report for service in addition to round-trip mileage ($.05 for each mile traveled) from their residence to the courthouse.\n\nMust my employer pay me while I am on jury duty?\n\nIf you are a regular full-time employee, your employer is required to pay you while you are on jury duty. Employers are prohibited by law from firing an employee and revoking acquired leave time for serving as a juror.\n\nVoir Dire\n\nAfter you have reported for jury duty, you will be selected for a jury panel along with other jurors. The jury panel is sent to the courtroom in which the case will be heard. A jury of 12 people will be selected in the courtroom. The judge in the courtroom will explain the case and introduce the lawyers and other participants. As part of jury selection, the judge and the lawyers will then question the jury panel members to determine if anyone has knowledge of the case, a personal interest in it, or feelings that might make it hard to be impartial. This process is called \"voir dire\", a phrase meaning \"to speak the truth\".\n\nQuestions asked during voir dire may seem personal but should be answered completely and honestly. The questions are not intended to embarrass anyone but are used to make sure that members of the jury do not have opinions or past experiences which might prevent reaching an impartial decision.\n\nChallenges\n\nDuring voir dire the lawyers may ask the judge to excuse a juror from sitting on the case. This is called \"challenging a juror\". There are two types of challenges: a challenge for cause and a peremptory challenge.\n\nA challenge for cause means the lawyer has a specific reason for thinking that a juror would not be able to be impartial. For example, the case may involve driving under the influence of alcohol. If a juror had been in an accident with a drunk driver and was still upset about it, the defense attorney could ask that the juror be excused for that reason. There is no limit to the number of jurors who may be excused for challenge for cause.\n\nPeremptory challenges do not require the lawyers to state any reason for excusing a juror.\n\nPeremptory challenges are intended to allow lawyers, both prosecution and defense, to do their best to assure that the trial is fair.\n\nAfter the jury is selected, the trial will generally follow this order of events:\n\nOpening Statements: The lawyers for each side may explain the case, the evidence they will present, and the issues for the jury to decide.\n\nPresentation of Evidence: The evidence consists of the testimony of witnesses and the exhibits allowed by the judge. Exhibits admitted into evidence will be available to the jury for examination during deliberations. The jury will be asked to make decisions regarding disputed facts; therefore, jurors attention at all times is critically important.\n\nJuror note-taking or the use of any notes will be determined by the judge. However, if allowed, juror may not use his/her own notes to sway other jurors. Notes are for personal use only.\n\nRulings by the Judge: The judge may be asked to decide questions of law during the trial. Occasionally, the judge may ask jurors to leave the courtroom while the lawyers make their legal arguments. The jurors should understand that such interruptions are needed to make sure that their verdict is based upon proper evidence, as determined by the judge under the Rules of Evidence. Jurors may give the evidence whatever weight they consider appropriate.\n\nClosing Arguments: After instructions, the lawyers have the opportunity to summarize the evidence in their closing arguments.\n\nInstructions to the Jury: At the close of all the evidence, the judge will read the instructions to the the jury, explaining the law and other considerations in the case.\n\nDeliberation: After closing arguments, the jury is isolated to decide the verdict in the case."
