They formed the base of the American Federa­tion of Labor.\n\nCRIMINAL SYNDICALISM: Syndicalism comes from the French word for union \"syndicat.\" Syndicalists believe unions should run the economy. The term is associated with the Industrial Workers of the World. Half the states just after World War I passed criminal syndicalist laws. In California a person could be convicted for having once belonged to the IWW. In New Mexico, an employer could be prosecuted for hiring an \"an­archist.\"\n\nDAYWORK: The worker is paid a fixed amount for the day rather than being paid a salary or being paid for the individual piece produced.\n\nDISCRIMINATION: Unequal treatment of workers because of race, sex, religion, nationality, or union membership.\n\nDUAL‑UNIONISM: The AFL expelled most CIO unions in 1937 for dual unionism because industrial unions were encroaching on the jurisdiction of craft unions within factories.\n\nEMPLOYMENT ACT: Passed in 1946 by a Congress which intended to establish machinery to maintain full employment.

In the 1970s it is corning to mean worker participation in management decision­making.\n\nINDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION: The great advances in technology beginning in the late eighteenth century turned America from a handicraft economy into one of technological mass produc­tion.\n\nINDUSTRIAL UNION: A union which includes all the workers in an industry regardless of their craft. Industrial unions formed the base of the CIO.\n\nINJUNCTION: A court order which prohibits a party from taking a particular course of action, such as picketing in the case of a union on strike.\n\nINTERNATIONAL UNION: A union with members in both the United States and Canada.\n\nJOURNEYMAN: A worker who has completed his apprenticeship in a trade or craft and is therefore considered a qualified skilled worker.\n\nJURISDICTIONAL DISPUTES: Arguments among unions over which union represents workers at a job site.\n\nLANDRUM‑GRIFFIN ACT: The Labor‑Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The law contains regulations for union election procedures and supervision of their financial affairs by the U. S. Department of Labor.\n\nLITTLE STEEL FORMULA: The World War II War Labor Board introduced the \"Little Steel formula\"' which tied the cost of living to wage increases \"as a stabilization factor.\"\n\nLOCKOUT: When an employer closes down the factory in order to coerce workers into meeting his demands or modifying their demands.\n\nLOWELL SYSTEM: The system associated with Lowell, Massa­chusetts, whereby workers, mainly young women, lived in boarding houses owned and run by the company.\n\nMAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSMP: A provision in the union con­tract which says that a worker who voluntarily joins the union must remain a member for the duration of the agreement.\n\nMASSACRE: Union descriptions of tragic events in labor history.

There was the Hilo, Hawaii, Massa­cre of 1938 where nearly fifty unionists were shot or bayonetted by police while sitting on a government pier protesting the unloading of a struck ship. Also, the Ludlow Massacre of 1914 which included the killing of eleven children and two women by the state militia.\n\nMAY DAY: In 1889 the International Socialist Congress meeting in Paris fixed May 1 as the day to publicize the eight‑hour day because America's AFL was going to hold an eight‑hour‑day demonstration on May 1, 1890. Since that time May Day has become a major celebration in communist countries. President Eisenhower in 1955 proclaimed May 1 as \"Loyalty Day.\"\n\nMECHANICS INSTITUTES: A workers' education movement for self‑improvement in the1830s and '40s.\n\nMEDIATION: Attempts by an impartial third party to get labor and management to find agreement during a dispute.\n\nMERIT SYSTEM: The major grievance of public employees was the indignity and insecurity fostered by the political patronage system which ruled government employment. They wanted a system where they would be hired and promoted on their merit. The merit system was introduced by passage of the Civil Service Act of 1883.\n\nMINIMUM WAGE: The lowest rate of pay an employer is allowed to pay under the law or a union contract.\n\nMODIFIED UNION SHOP: A provision in the union contract requiring all new employees to join the union and requiring all workers already in the union to remain as union members.\n\nMOHAWK VALLEY FORMULA: Developed by James Rand, presi­dent of Remington Rand, in 1936 to break strikes. The formula included discrediting union leaders by calling them \"agitators,\" threatening to move the plant, raising the banner of \"law and order\" to mobilize the community against the union, and actively engaging police in strike‑breaking activity, then orga­nizing a back‑to‑work movement of pro‑company employees. While the National Association of Manufacturers enthusi­astically published the plan, the National Labor Relations Board called it a battle plan for industrial war.\n\nMOLLY MAGUIRES: A group of Irish miners who in the 1860s and '70s vandalized the mines and terrorized the bosses. Ten were hanged as the leaders of the conspiracy after Pinkerton agent, James McParland, exposed them in 1877.\n\nMOONLIGHTING: Working more than one job.\n\nNATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT OF 1935: Also known as the \"Wagner Act\" after the law's chief sponsor, Senator Robert Wagner of New York. It represented a fundamental turnaround in government's attitudes toward labor relations. The law created a National Labor Relations Board to carry out its goals of guaranteeing the right of workers to form unions of their own choosing and to bargain collectively with employers.\n\nONE BIG UNION: The slogan of the IWW which stressed the inclusion of everyone, regardless of trade, into an all ­encompassing union. This was also the rationale for the general strike where workers in all types of employment would strike at the same time.\n\nOPEN SHOP: A business that employs workers without regard to union membership. In the 1920s the \"open shop\" employed an ill‑disguised attempt to get ride of bona fide unions. States with \"Right to Work\" laws have decreed the open shop.\n\nPACE‑SETTER: A method of speeding up work. The pace‑setter is a person who sets the work pace, usually at an ever higher rate, by leading the work gang and necessitating its catching up with him.\n\nPALMER RAIDS: In 1919‑20, U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer conducted raids on the headquarters of alleged radicals. Unionists, liberals, radicals, and aliens were indiscriminately arrested and around four thousand were tried for their dissent from the status quo with little regard for their civil rights.\n\nPATERNALISM: The company considered itself the father of its employees and as such had the responsibility of regulating their lives through company houses, stores, hospitals, theaters, sports programs, churches, publications, and codes of be­havior on and off the job. Paternalism was also prevalent in public employment. Teachers in 1915 were not permitted to marry, keep company with men, travel beyond the city limits, smoke, dress in bright colors, or wear skirts shorter than two inches above the ankles.\n\nPERB: The abbreviation of state public employment relations boards.\n\nPERQUISITES: In addition to payment of wages, the company provided employees with room, board, and medical care.\n\nPICKETING: The stationing of persons outside a place of em­ployment to publically protest the employer and to discourage entry of nonstriking workers or customers.

Some believe the expres­sion \"Fink,\" a pejorative term for a worker not loyal to the union, originated by combining a common expletive with the word \"Pinkerton.\"\n\nPOLITICAL ACTION: Unions engaged in political action at least as far back as the 1820s, when they demanded universal free public education and abolition of imprisonment for debt as their major social reform issues. Today, AFL‑CIO and inde­pendent unions expend a substantial amount of money and effort in the promotion of their political causes. Their rationale is that what is gained at the bargaining table can be taken away from unions through legislation. AFL‑CIO's formal political organization which functions at the national, state, community and local union level is the Committee on Political Education (COPE).\n\nPREVAILING WAGE: In 1861, Congress passed a prevailing wage rate law which said in part: \"That the hours of labor and the rates of wages of the employees in the navy yards shall con­form as nearly as possible with those of private establishments in the immediate vicinity of the respective yards.\"\n\nPRODUCTIVITY: The measure of efficiency in production. The comparison of resources used in creating goods and services. If the same resources that were used in the past produce more goods and services, productivity has increased.\n\nPROHIBITED PRACTICES: Generally used in public employment to describe unfair labor practices on the part of employer and employee organizations.\n\nREADING FORMULA: The procedure with which union recog­nition was achieved in factories during the 1930s. Rather than being compelled to strike for union recognition, the new Wag­ner Act provided a method of union representation elections which were conducted by the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nREAL WAGES: Wages expressed in terms of what today's dollar will buy. A common method of determining buying power is through the Consumer Price Index.\n\nREDEMPTIONER: A white emigrant from Europe who paid for his or her voyage to the New World by serving as a servant for a specific period of time. Also known as a freewiller.\n\nRIGHT TO WORK LAWS: The term used by opponents of unions to institute open‑shop laws in the state. The expression has nothing to do with guaranteeing anyone the right to a job.\n\nSABOTAGE: From the French word \"sabot\" or wooden shoe which workers threw into the machines to keep them from working. Workers have been perpetually fearful that new machines would take their jobs away from them and sabotage was one of their early answers to the Industrial Revolution. It was also a part of strike violence where strikers incapacitated machines or buildings in order to shut down production.\n\nSCAB: A worker who refuses to join the union or who works while others are striking. Also known as a \"strikebreaker.\"\n\nSECONDARY BOYCOTT: An effort to disrupt the business of an employer through boycott techniques, even though his own workers are not directly involved in the labor dispute.\n\nSENIORITY: A worker's length of service with an employer. In union contracts, seniority often determines layoffs from work and recalls back to work.\n\nSEPARATION PAY: Payment to a worker who is permanently laid off his job through no fault of his own.\n\nSERVICE FEE: Money, usually the equivalent of union dues, which members of an agency shop bargaining unit pay the union for negotiating and administering the collective bargain­ing agreement.\n\nSHOP UNION: Established by the Knights of Labor in the 1880s. Shop unions in the factory carried out the rule enforcements of the local assemblies.\n\nSIT‑DOWN STRIKE: In June, 1934, Rex Murray, president of the General Tire local in Akron, Ohio, discussed a pending strike with fellow unionists. If they hit the bricks, the police would beat them up. But if they sat down inside the plant and hugged the machines, the police wouldn't use violence. They might hurt the machines! So began the era of the sit­down strikes effectively used by unions like the Rubber Workers and Auto Workers to build the CIO. The sit‑down period lasted only through 1937, but it provided labor history with one of its most colorful chapters.\n\nSLOWDOWN: A form of protest where workers deliberately lessen the amount of work for a particular purpose.\n\nSOCIAL UNIONISM: Unions which look beyond immediate objec­tives to try to reform social conditions and which also consider unionism as a means of appealing to needs of members which are not strictly economic. In addition to fighting for economic gains, social unions have education, health, welfare, artistic, recreation, and citizenship programs to attempt to satisfy needs of members' whole personalities. Labor, social unionists believe, has an obligation to better the general society.\n\nSPEED UP: A word used by workers to describe employer attempts to increase their output without increasing their wages.\n\nSTATE SOVEREIGNTY: The idea that the state is king and public employees had no right to make demands on it. In 1949 a New York court said: \"To tolerate or recognize any com­bination of civil service employees of the government as a labor organization or union is not only incompatible with the spirit of democracy but inconsistent with every principle upon which our government is founded.\"\n\nSTOOLPIGEON: A person hired by an employer to infiltrate the union and report on its activities.\n\nSTRETCHOUT: A workload increase that does not grant a com­mensurate pay increase.\n\nSTRIKE: A temporary work stoppage by workers to support their demands on an employer. Also called a \"turn out\" early in the nineteenth century.\n\nSUBCONTRACTING: The practice of employers getting work done by an outside contractor and not by workers in the bargaining unit. Also called \"contracting out.\"\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS: A provision in the union contract which provides laid‑off workers with benefits in addition to unemployment compensation.\n\nSYMPATHY STRIKE: A strike by persons not directly involved in a labor dispute in order to show solidarity with the original strikers and increase pressure on the employer.\n\nTAFT‑HARTLEY: In 1947, Congress passed the Taft‑Hartley Act which outlawed the closed shop, jurisdictional strikes, and secondary boycotts. It set up machinery for decertifying unions and allowed the states to pass more stringent legisla­tion against unions such as right‑to‑work laws. Employers and unions were forbidden to contribute funds out of their treasuries to candidates for federal office, supervision was denied union protection, and the unions seeking the services of the National Labor Relations Board had to file their constitutions, by‑laws, and financial statements with the U.S. Department of Labor. Their officers also had to sign a non‑communist affidavit.\n\nTAYLORISM: Associated with the principles of \"scientific management\" advocated by Frederick W. Taylor at the begin­ning of the twentieth century. Tayor proposed time and motion studies of jobs to enable managers to set standards for more efficient production. Unions argued that Taylorism was the old speed up in modern dress.\n\nTENANT FARMER: When southern plantations were broken up after the Civil War, blacks and poor whites were controlled by landowners through sharecropping. The tenant farmer paid roughly a third of his crop to the landlord, a third for provisions, tools, and other necessities, and. he kept whatever was left. Unsuccessful efforts were made in the 1930s to orga­nize tenant farmers by the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. More sustained attempts at farm worker organization are being made today.\n\nUNDERGROUND RAILROAD: A system of clandestine routes to­ward Canada whereby abolitionists helped fugitive slaves escape to freedom.\n\nUNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES: Defined by the National Labor Relations Act and by the Taft‑Hartley Act as practices of discrimination, coercion, and intimidation prohibited to labor and management. Management cannot form company unions or use coercive tactics to discourage union organization. Unions cannot force workers to join organizations not of their own choosing.\n\nUNION LABEL: A stamp or a tag on products to show that the work was done by union labor.\n\nUNION SECURITY: A clause in the contract providing for the union shop, maintenance of membership or the agency shop.\n\nUNION SHOP: A shop where every member; of the bargaining unit must become a member of the union after a specified amount of time.\n\nWALKING DELEGATE: A unionist who policed jobs to see that workers were getting fair treatment.\n\nWHITE‑COLLAR WORKERS: Workers who have office jobs rather than factory, farm, or construction work.\n\nWOBBLIES: A nickname for members of the Industrial Workers of the World. The origin of the word is unknown.\n\nWORKIES: A nickname for members of the workingmen's associ­ations in the 1820s and '30s.\n\nYELLOW‑DOG CONTRACT: A contract a worker was compelled to sign stating that he or she would not join a union. The practice was outlawed in 1932 by the passage of the Norris ­LaCuardia Act."
