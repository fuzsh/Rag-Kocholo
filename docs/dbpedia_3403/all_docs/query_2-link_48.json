UC and UAW have collective bargaining agreements that each have no-strike clauses. UAW-represented UC employees began striking on May 20 at UC Santa Cruz and the strike has expanded to six of the 10 systemwide campuses.\n\n“We are extremely grateful for a pause in this strike so our students can complete their academic studies. The strike would have caused irreversible setbacks to students’ academic achievements and may have stalled critical research projects in the final quarter,” said Melissa Matella, associate vice president for Systemwide Labor Relations.\n\n“From the beginning, we have stated this strike was illegal and a violation of our contracts’ mutually agreed upon no-strike clauses,” Matella added. “We respect the advocacy and progressive action towards issues that matter to our community and our community’s right to engage in lawful free speech activities — activities that continue to occur across the system. However, UAW’s strike is unrelated to employment terms, violates the parties’ agreements, and runs contrary to established labor principles.”\n\nWhile this is an important victory critical to support student success, the University will continue to pursue its legal claims in state court and PERB to protect labor peace across the system.\n\nMedia Contact: media@ucop.edu\n\nUC Sues UAW Over Breach of Contract\n\nIn order to ensure that it can meet its commitments to its students, patients and campus community, the University of California filed a lawsuit today against UAW, the labor union striking across UC campuses in violation of their contract. The suit asks the state to issue a temporary restraining order to UAW to immediately end a strike on UC campuses.\n\n“The blatant breach of the parties’ no-strike clauses by UAW will continue to cause irreversible harm to the University as it will disrupt the education of thousands of students in the form of canceled classes and delayed grades,” said Melissa Matella, associate vice president for Systemwide Labor Relations. “The breach of contract also endangers life-saving research in hundreds of laboratories across the University and will also cause the University substantial monetary damages.”\n\nThe filing notes that UAW bargaining unit members have refused to teach classes, lead discussion sections, conduct research, or otherwise perform their job duties on the striking campuses. It also describes the wide-ranging impacts on the UC system:\n\nIndividuals carrying UAW picket signs have also blocked egress and ingress to various University buildings and access points, including hospitals and childcare centers.\n\nFor example, individuals carrying UAW picket signs have blocked key access points at UC Santa Cruz, causing extreme disruption to its operations.\n\nIndividuals carrying UAW picket signs have stormed and barricaded themselves into buildings at UCLA.\n\nAlso, at UCLA, individuals carrying UAW picket signs have blocked streets, parking lots, and loading docks, preventing access by the community.\n\nUC has stated that the strike is about political and social issues, not terms of employment and issues related to labor.\n\nThe filing states that “UAW members individually advocating for the vote understood that the strike was to support UAW’s political and social position. One noted the international focus of the strike and made clear that the vote was about divestment and Palestine. Another pushed their department to vote for the strike stating, “[T]he top demand that matters here is disinvestment. This is about Palestine first and our ability to work comfortably at UC second.” UAW has stated that it will expand its strike systemwide by the finals period, which is early to mid-June for most of the University’s campuses.\n\n“Without immediate injunctive relief, the University will suffer irreparable harm to its operations, as well as the educational experience and academic progress of its students,” the filing notes.\n\nMedia Contact: media@ucop.edu\n\nPERB Refuses to Take Immediate Action to Stop Unlawful Strike – Complaint against UAW is Still Pending\n\nThe state Public Employment Relations Board refused to take action today to end the UAW strike across UC campuses immediately.\n\n“We are disappointed that the state agency dedicated to the oversight of public employment could not take decisive and immediate action to end this unlawful strike – a decision that harms UC’s students who are nearing the end of their academic year,” said Melissa Matella, Associate Vice President for Systemwide Labor Relations. While PERB has not agreed to act immediately through an injunction, it has issued a complaint against UAW about its strike.\n\nUC will file a breach of contract action against UAW in state court as a next step.\n\n“Now that UC has exhausted the PERB process for injunctive relief, UC will move to state court and is hopeful for quick and decisive action so that our students can end their quarter with their focus on academics,” Matella said.\n\nConcurrently with state action, PERB is still charged with reviewing Unfair Labor Practices (ULPs). PERB has issued a complaint against UAW based on UC’s ULP. On Friday, UC responded to the UAW’s ULP. PERB is still reviewing and has not issued a complaint against the University.\n\nMedia Contact: media@ucop.edu\n\nUC Files Amended Request for Injunctive Relief; Cites New Evidence of Irreparable Harm\n\nThe University of California (UC) filed an amended request for injunctive relief today, asking the state Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) to ask a court to end the UAW strike across UC campuses immediately.\n\nThe submission follows PERB’s allowance for UC to present further evidence regarding the adverse effects of the UAW strike. UC highlights recent evidence detailing how the ongoing strike has resulted in significant disruptions on campus, posing harm to students, faculty, and staff.\n\n“Since the Union announced its unlawful strike vote, its members have forcibly occupied an academic building at UCLA and damaged it with graffiti, invaded classrooms where faculty and students were trying to learn, blocked roadways, and have refused to teach, conduct seminars, administer exams, among other duties that students rely on to complete their course work,” the new filing states.\n\nThe filing also notes that UAW members, or at least individuals operating under apparent authorization from UAW — have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activities under the guise of a strike. For example, individuals claiming to represent UAW hit a police officer over the head with a UAW sign, occupied an important academic building at UCLA, attempted to barricade its entrances, and left graffiti inside the building when they were finally dispersed. A few days later, individuals carrying UAW picket signs at UCLA unlawfully blocked roadways, forcing drivers to weave through people to escape the blockage. The same conduct has occurred at UC Santa Cruz, with UAW picketers and protesters blocking both entrances to UC Santa Cruz’s campus.\n\n“The impact of this unlawful behavior on our students is substantial,” said Melissa Matella, Associate Vice President for Systemwide Labor Relations. “Allowing the strike to continue deprives students of access to crucial instructors as they prepare for finals and work to complete final projects. This instructional time can never be made up, nor can the impact of lost projects and exams.”\n\nMedia Contact: media@ucop.edu\n\nUC Response to UAW’s Strike Expansion\n\nThe University remains disappointed that the UAW is engaging in an illegal strike in violation of our contract’s mutually agreed no-strike clauses to advance issues that have no bearing on employment at UC. We are working with campus administrators to minimize disruption as much as possible, but it is inevitable and unfortunate, especially amidst an already stressful quarter and educational experience for students. In response to the University’s request for injunctive relief, we hope that PERB issues a ruling to stop these unlawful strikes so that students, faculty, and staff across the University system can focus on critical end-of-the-academic-year teaching, grading, and ongoing time-sensitive research.\n\nPERB issues complaint against UAW\n\nThe state Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) has issued a complaint against UAW today for its unlawful strike activity.\n\nThe issuance of the complaint means that PERB investigated the charge and found enough evidence to suggest that a violation may have occurred, and further examination is warranted. PERB also ordered UC and UAW to mediation in an effort to resolve the University’s Unfair Labor Practice, which will be held later today.\n\nFiling ULPs is a customary practice when attempting to resolve labor disputes. Once filed, a PERB agent will investigate the charge to determine if a “prima facie” case exists, meaning there’s enough evidence to suggest a violation may have occurred. If a prima facie case is found, a formal complaint is issued, as was the case with yesterday’s complaint against UAW.\n\n“The University is pleased by this expedited action from PERB,” said Missy Matella, Associate Vice President for Systemwide Labor Relations. “We have maintained from the beginning that UAW’s actions violate our mutually agreed contracts. We are eager to see a quick and just resolution to this matter so that our students, faculty and staff can end this academic quarter without further disrupting their education and progress towards degree completion.”\n\nPERB noted that UAW and UC have no-strike clauses in their contracts, which state: “During the term of this agreement or any written extension thereof, the University agrees that there shall be no lockouts by the University. The UAW, on behalf of its officers, agents, and members agrees that there shall be no strikes, including sympathy strikes, stoppages or interruptions of work, or other concerted activities which interfere directly or indirectly with University operations during the life of this agreement or any written extension thereof. The UAW, on behalf of its officers, agents, and members, agrees that it shall not in any way authorize, assist, encourage, participate in, sanction, ratify, condone, or lend support to any activities in violation of this article.”\n\nPERB’s complaint states that UAW “failed to provide adequate advance notice of its work stoppage, and failed and refused to meet and confer in good faith in violation of Government Code section 3571.1(c).”\n\nUC filed a request for injunctive relief with its unfair labor practice charge after UAW voted to strike to protest the Palestine-Israel conflict. UC sought immediate action before PERB reaches a final decision on the University’s ULP. Because injunctive relief is issued before PERB’s process is complete, it is an extremely high standard that requires a showing of irreparable harm. PERB declined to seek an injunction at this time but left UC’s request open if it learns of evidence or facts to support relief in the future.\n\nAfter mediation, the case will be heard before an administrative law judge (ALJ), where both sides present evidence and arguments.\n\nMedia Contact: media@ucop.edu\n\nUC files unfair labor practice charge against UAW for illegal strike\n\nThe University of California filed an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) with the state Public Employment Relations Board today, asking the state to order UAW 4811 and its bargaining unit members to cease and desist strike activity.\n\nUAW authorized a potential strike on Wednesday and has stated action is imminent and would be designed to “maximize chaos and confusion” across the UC system. On May 17, UAW announced it asked its members at UC Santa Cruz to strike on Monday, May 20. UC’s filing asks PERB to issue a cease and desist to UAW from engaging in any current strike activities and refrain from future strikes violating the no-strike provision in its collective bargaining agreements.\n\n“Given UAW’s publicly stated position and the subsequent potential impacts on our students and campuses, we are forced to take decisive action to ensure we can continue to fulfill our fundamental missions of teaching, research and public service,” said Melissa Matella, Associate Vice President for Systemwide Labor Relations.\n\nEach of UAW’s four systemwide bargaining units with UC state: The UAW, on behalf of its officers, agents and members, agrees that there shall be no strikes, including sympathy strikes, stoppages or interruptions of work, or other concerted activities which interfere directly or indirectly with University operations during the life of this agreement or any written extension thereof. The UAW, on behalf of its officers, agents, and members, agrees that it shall not in any way authorize, assist, encourage, participate in, sanction, ratify, condone, or lend support to any activities in violation of this article.\n\n“We respect and value a productive working relationship with our labor unions,” Matella added. “We collaborate regularly to reach mutually beneficial agreements around employment terms. We have and continue to hope that UAW will honor the terms of our contracts.”\n\nMedia Contact: media@ucop.edu\n\nUC Statement on UAW Vote to Conduct Unlawful Strike\n\n“This strike is illegal,” said Melissa Matella, Associate Vice President of Systemwide Labor Relations. “UAW’s decision to strike over nonlabor issues violates the no-strike clause of their contracts with UC and sets a dangerous and far-reaching precedent that social, political and cultural issues – no matter how valid – that are not labor-related can support a labor strike.”\n\nUAW and UC have mutually agreed upon contracts in place which state: The UAW, on behalf of its officers, agents and members, agrees that there shall be no strikes, including sympathy strikes, stoppages or interruptions of work, or other concerted activities which interfere directly or indirectly with University operations during the life of this agreement or any written extension thereof. The UAW, on behalf of its officers, agents, and members, agrees that it shall not in any way authorize, assist, encourage, participate in, sanction, ratify, condone, or lend support to any activities in violation of this article.\n\nUAW 4811 has stated that they believe their members’ freedom of speech and expression was violated after demonstrations at UCLA and UC San Diego. To be clear, the University supports free speech and lawful protests. Across the UC system, campuses have allowed—and continue to allow—lawful protests surrounding the conflict in the Middle East. But when protests violate University policy or threaten the safety and security of others, the University has taken lawful action to end impermissible and unlawful behavior.\n\nMore importantly, campus administrators who met with protestors understood they were meeting with students to discuss peaceful resolutions to student concerns. The University had no indication that the protests were connected to any labor dispute or the terms of employment for students, some of whom are also UAW members in their capacity as University employees. The list of demands from student protestors, and even from UAW 4811, are political demands that are outside the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nMay 14\n\nFor 150 years, the University of California has stood as a catalyst for collective action in service to social good. We have a proud history of respecting advocacy movements by our students, faculty, and staff and believe that the right to peaceful protest is a cornerstone of democracy.\n\nAdditionally, we deeply value the contributions of our union-represented employees to our mission. We have worked closely with them to negotiate fair contracts that include increased compensation, more robust benefits, and, for UAW-represented members, free and discounted tuition to receive a world-class degree.\n\nUC believes that a strike sets a dangerous precedent that would introduce non-labor issues into labor agreements. If a strike is allowed for political and social disputes, the associated work stoppages would significantly impact UC’s ability to deliver on its promises to its students, community, and the State of California. To be clear, the UC understands and embraces its role as a forum for free speech, lawful protests, and public debate. However, given that role, these non-work-related disputes cannot prevent it from fulfilling its academic mission. Further, this precedent would apply far beyond the University, impacting public employers across the state and their ability to deliver core services.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the profoundly troubling issues about the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and understand their impact on our students and employees, the University maintains that these issues fall outside the scope of negotiation for employment and the implementation of existing labor contracts.\n\nThe University’s focus remains on providing each student with the education they have paid for and discussing appropriate workplace concerns with all union-represented employees that honor their commitment to our students and provide competitive compensation and safe, equitable working conditions for everyone.\n\nMay 6\n\nThe University is concerned that a potential strike by UAW-represented academic employees could create significant disruptions at a time when stability and support are crucial for our community. A strike during this already vulnerable time will maximize disruption, interfere with end-of-year activities and create more uncertainty for our students and communities.\n\nThere is no basis under the contract or the law for UAW to strike. UC and UAW have a mutually agreed upon contract that states: The UAW, on behalf of its officers, agents, and members agrees that there shall be no strikes, including sympathy strikes, stoppages, interruptions of work, or other concerted activities which interfere directly or indirectly with University operations.\n\nMay 2\n\nToday we are deeply saddened by the violence and harm to our UC communities over the last several days. Our hearts go out to all of those individuals impacted as we work towards healing our communities.\n\nViolence does not have a place at our campuses – public institutions designed to further civil discourse and learning in an effort to better our society and lift up our collective communities.\n\nWith these critical goals in mind, the University of California is deeply alarmed, concerned and disappointed that our UAW-represented academic employees would choose this moment of crisis to take a vote to engage in an unlawful work stoppage. UC values these employees and asks them to join it in supporting our communities at this time.\n\nTo be clear, UC has closed contracts with the UAW that prevent its members from engaging in work stoppages and create a duty for the union to prevent its members from doing the same. There is no basis under the contract or the law for UAW to engage in a work stoppage. Further, given the vulnerable status of our communities at this moment, a strike vote by UAW is essentially a vote to take advantage of and exploit this complex and impactful situation.\n\nArchived UAW news\n\nStatus of Negotiations (Updated: December 23, 2022)\n\nWhat UC is offering each bargaining unit (Updated: December 16, 2022)\n\nHow compensation for UC academic employees compares nationally\n\nFrequently asked questions about key issues\n\nUC’s responses to priority union issues\n\nUC committed to collaboration and compromise\n\nUC‘s position on and preparations for the UAW strike\n\nBackground"
