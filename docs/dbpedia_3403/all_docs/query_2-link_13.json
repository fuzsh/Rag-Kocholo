Change in domicile requires physical presence of individual in new domicile coupled with present intent to permanently reside in new domicile. In establishing domicile, intent is based on actual state of facts and not what one declares them to be. Pattan v. Fields, 669 So.2d 1233 (La. App. 1 Cir., 1995); writ denied 661 So.2d 1341, 1342.\n\nAn 11-year-old was of suitable age and discretion to accept service on behalf of his stepfather concerning notice of default judgment where deputy asked questions designed to ascertain if child was of suitable age and understanding before making service.

Service on incarcerated person\n\nService is made on a person who is incarcerated in a jail or detention facility through personal service on the warden or his designee for that shift.

Proof of service shall be made by filing in the record the affidavit of the person serving the citation and pleadings on the person who is incarcerated.\n\nArt. 1236. Service on clerical employees of physicians\n\nService on any physician, when not a party to an action, may be made at his or her office through personal service on any clerical employee of such physician.\n\nArt. 1237. Service on individual in multiple capacities\n\nIn cases wherein an individual is named in pleadings in more than one capacity, personal service on that individual is sufficient to constitute service of process on that individual in all capacities, including but not limited to as an individual, tutor, or a representative of a legal or quasi legal entity, when it is clear from the pleadings or service instructions the capacities in which the individual is being served.\n\nChapter 3. Service on Legal and Quasi Legal Entities\n\nArt. 1261. Domestic or foreign corporation\n\nService of citation or other process on a domestic or foreign corporation is made by personal service on any one of its agents for service of process.\n\nIf the corporation has failed to designate an agent for service of process, if there is no registered agent by reason of death, resignation, or removal, or if the person attempting to make service certifies that he is unable, after due diligence, to serve the designated agent, service of the citation or other process may be made by any of the following methods:\n\nBy personal service on any employee of suitable age and discretion at any place where the business of the corporation is regularly conducted.\n\nBy service of process under the provisions of R.S. 13:3204, if the corporation is subject to the provisions of R.S. 13:3201.\n\nService of citation or other process on a bank is made pursuant to R.S. 6:285©. Case Note: Service upon Louisiana corporation by leaving copy of petition with wife of corporation’s registered agent at agent’s residence was insufficient, and proceedings which resulted in default judgment against corporation were null. Service Electric of Louisiana, Inc. v. Clifton Briley Inc., 479 So.2d 691 (App. 3 Cir., 1985).\n\nArt. 1262. Same; secretary of state\n\nIf the officer making service certifies that he is unable, after diligent effort, to have service made as provided in Article 1261, then the service may be made personally on the secretary of state, or on a person in his office designated to receive service of process on corporations. The secretary of state shall forward this citation to the corporation at its last known address.\n\nArt. 1263. Partnership\n\nService of citation or other process on a partnership is made by personal service on a partner. When the officer certifies that he is unable, after diligent effort, to make service in this manner, he may make personal service on any employee of suitable age and discretion at any place where the business of the partnership is regularly conducted.\n\nArt. 1264. Unincorporated association\n\nService on an unincorporated association is made by personal service on the agent appointed, if any, or in his absence, upon a managing official, at any place where the business of the association is regularly conducted.

He shall sign and return the copy promptly after the service to the clerk of court who issued it. The return, when received by the clerk, shall form part of the record, and shall be considered prima facie correct. The court, at any time and upon such terms as are just, may allow any process or proof of service thereof to be amended, unless it clearly appears that material prejudice would result to the substantial rights of the party against whom the process issued.\n\nArt. 1293. Service by private person\n\nA. When the sheriff has not made service within ten days after receipt of the process or when a return has been made certifying that the sheriff has been unable to make service, whichever is earlier, on motion of a party the court shall appoint a person over the age of majority, not a party and residing within the state whom the court deems qualified to perform the duties required, to make service of process in the same manner as is required of sheriffs. Service of process made in this manner shall be proved like any other fact in the case. Any person who is a Louisiana licensed private investigator shall be presumed qualified to perform the duties required to make service.\n\nB. In serving notice of a summary proceeding as provided by Article 2592 or a subpoena which is related to the proceeding, on motion of a party the court shall have the discretion to appoint any person over the age of majority, not a party and residing within the state, to make service of process, notices, and subpoenas in the same manner as is required of sheriffs, without first requiring the sheriff to attempt service. The party making such a motion shall include the reasons, verified by affidavit, necessary to forego service by the sheriff, which shall include but not be limited to the urgent emergency nature of the hearing, knowledge of the present whereabouts of the person to be served, as well as any other good cause shown.\n\nC. In addition to those natural persons who the court may appoint to make service of process pursuant to Paragraph A or B of this Article, the court may also appoint a juridical person which may then select an employee or agent of that juridical person to make service of process, provided the employee or agent perfecting service of process is a natural person who qualifies as an agent for service of process pursuant to Paragraph A or B of this Article.\n\nArt. 1355. Service of subpoena\n\nA subpoena shall be served and a return thereon made in the same manner and with the same effect as a service of and return on a citation.

Service of process\n\nA certified copy of the citation and of the petition in a suit under R.S. 13;3201 shall be sent by counsel for the plaintiff to the defendant by registered or certified mail or by actually delivered to the defendant by an individual designated by the court in which the suit is filed, or by one authorized by the law of the place where the service is made to serve the process of any of its courts of general, limited, or small claims jurisdiction.\n\nIf service of process cannot be made on the nonresident by registered or certified mail or by actual delivery, the court shall order that service of process be made by an attorney at law appointed to represent the defendant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure At. 5091.\n\nService of process so made has the same legal force and validity as personal service on the defendant in this state.\n\n13:3471. Supplementary rules of service of process\n\nThe following rules supplement those governing the service of citation and other legal process in a civil action or proceeding contained in the Code of Civil Procedure:\n\nIf the foreign corporation or the foreign limited liability company is not one required by law to appoint an agent for the service of process, but has engaged in a business activity in this state, service of process in an action or proceeding on a cause of action resulting from such business activity in this state, or for any taxes due or other obligations arising therefrom, may be made on any employee or agent of the corporation or limited liability company of suitable age and discretion found in the state.\n\nIf such employees or agents are no longer in the state, or cannot be found after diligent effort, the officer charged with the duty of making the service shall make his return to the court, stating the efforts made by him to secure service and the reason why he was unable to do so. Thereupon the court shall order that service shall be made on the secretary of state, or on some other individual in his office whom the secretary of state may designate to receive service of process.\n\nThe secretary of state shall ascertain the domiciliary post office address of the corporation, or limited liability company and shall send the original papers served to the corporation or limited liability company by registered mail, with return receipt requested. The secretary of state shall retain in his office true copies of these papers, on which he shall note the date, the manner and other particulars of the service, and of the disposition made of the original papers.\n\nIn an action or proceeding brought in a parish other than that of the domicile of a defendant, citation and all other legal process may be served on this defendant in the parish where the action or proceeding was brought, if the defendant can be served therein. Otherwise, the process may be sent by the clerk of the court from which it issued to any parish where the defendant may be found, and service may be made by the sheriff or a constable of the latter parish.\n\nWhen an action or proceeding is brought in the parish of the domicile of a defendant, and the latter is absent therefrom, service may be made on him in any parish of the state where he may be found.\n\nAn acceptance of service shall be dated, and if no date is shown thereon, the acceptance takes effect from the date of its filing in court. No acceptance of service shall affect the delays allowed by law or by the local rules of court.\n\nThe return of the serving officer on any citation or other legal process is conclusive, unless directly attacked. Such an attack may be made by rule in the action or proceeding, if made prior to judgment. If made after judgment, the return may be attacked only in a direct action to annul the judgment, which may be brought in the original action or proceeding. If the defendant was actually served, the court may correct an error in the return by an amendment thereof, on a rule brought against and tried contradictorily with the defendant who was served, or any other party who may be affected by the amendment.\n\nService of process on an inmate of a public institution may be made by the sheriff or any constable of the parish where the institution is situated.\n\nService of process by a sheriff or constable shall be returned into the court which issued the process as soon as possible after the service is made. In addition thereto, the serving officer shall keep a complete record thereof in a book specially provided for that purpose. If the original return is lost or destroyed, the entries in this book shall be received and recognized in lieu thereof, subject to the provisions of R.S. 13:3471(5).\n\nSubsequent to service of the original petition in any civil action or proceeding, service of pleadings, documents, or notices that may be served by mail or delivery on an attorney of record may also be made by delivering a copy to the attorney by means of a telephonic facsimile communication device, if the attorney maintains such device at his office and the device is operating at the time service is made. When service is made as provided herein, the party or attorney making the service shall file in the record a certificate showing service was made by telephonic facsimile communication device.\n\n13:3472. Service on foreign corporation through secretary of state\n\nIn any case where service on a foreign corporation may be made through the secretary of state, under any law heretofore or hereafter enacted, such service may be made in person on the secretary of state anywhere in the state. Should the secretary of state be absent from his office, service may be made on the assistant secretary of state, or on some other individual in the office of the secretary of state designated by the latter to receive service of process in his absence, and such service has the same effect as if made upon the secretary of state personally.\n\n13:3474 Operation of motor vehicle by non-resident as appointment of secretary of state as agent for service of process\n\nThe acceptance by non-residents of the rights and privileges conferred by existing laws to operate motor vehicles on the public highways of the state of Louisiana, or the operation by a non-resident or his authorized agent, employee or person for whom he is legally responsible of a motor vehicle within the state of Louisiana, shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by such non-resident of the secretary of state of Louisiana or his successor in office, to be his true and lawful attorney for service of process, as well as the attorney for service of process of the public liability and property damage insurer of the vehicle, if such insurer be a non-resident not authorized to do business in the state, upon whom or such insurer, may be served all lawful process in any action or proceeding against the non-resident, or such insurer, growing out of any accident or collision in which the non-resident may be involved while operating a motor vehicle in this state, or while same is operated by his authorized agent or employee. In the event of the death of such non-resident before service of process upon him, any action or proceeding growing out of such accident or collision may be instituted against the executors or administrators of such deceased non-resident, if there be such, and if not, then against his heirs or legatees, and service may be made upon them as provided in R.S. 13:3475. Process against the defendant or defendants, the non-resident, his executors or administrators, if there be such, and if not, then against his heirs or legatees, or the liability insurer of such vehicle, as the case may be, shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served upon such defendant personally.\n\n13:3475. Service on secretary of state; sending or delivering notice and copies; filing receipt or affidavit; continuances\n\nThe service of the process authorized by R.S. 13:3474 shall be made by serving a copy of the petition and citation on the secretary of state, or his successor in office, and such service shall be sufficient service upon said defendant, the nonresident, the executors or administrators of the deceased non-resident, if there be such, and if not, then against his heirs or legatees, or the nonresident liability insurer of the vehicle, as the case may be; provided that notice of such service, together with a copy of the petition and citation, is forthwith sent by the plaintiff by registered mail or certified mail with receipt requested, or is actually delivered to the defendant and the defendant’s return receipt, in case notice is sent by registered or certified mail, or affidavit of the party delivering the petition and citation in case notice is made by actual delivery, is filed in the proceedings before judgment can be entered against the defendant. The court in which the action is pending may order such continuances as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to defend the action.\n\nFor purposes of this Section, the return receipt indicating that the registered or certified mail was actually delivered, refused, or unclaimed, is satisfactory proof of service of process if mailed to the defendant’s address as indicated on the defendant’s safety responsibility personal accident report, SR10, or if such report was not timely filed with the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, if mailed to the defendant’s address as indicated on the accident report filed with the department by the law enforcement officer who responded to the accident.\n\n13:3476. Service by constable or court-appointed officer when service cannot be made by the sheriff; sheriff an interested party\n\nWhenever the sheriff of any parish shall be interested in any suit or other legal process, or when there shall be no sheriff in office in any parish, or the sheriff shall be disqualified by law, from interest or otherwise, from serving any legal process, it shall be served by any regular constable of the parish, or by any officer appointed by the court. Such constable or officer shall have in the suit all powers, receive all the emoluments, and be liable to all the responsibilities of the sheriff.\n\n13:3477. Inability or refusal of constable or deputy constable to act; employment of sheriff or deputy; appointment of special deputy constable\n\nIn case of the inability or refusal to act on the part of the constable or a duly appointed deputy constable because of relationship, sickness or from other causes in civil suits, and in case of the execution of conservatory writs in civil suits, the justices of the peace may employ either the sheriff or his deputy or appoint a special deputy constable to execute all orders, citations, summons, seizures and writs.\n\n13:3478. Constable or deputy constable to act when not disqualified or unwilling or unable to act\n\nWhen there is a constable or duly appointed deputy constable not disqualified to act because of relationship, or unable to act on account of sickness or other cause, and who is willing to act, and who is personally present when conservatory writs are sued out, then and in these cases, the justice of the peace for whose ward said constable shall have been elected or appointed and qualified, shall employ said constable or his duly appointed deputy constable to the exclusion of the sheriff or his deputy, or a special deputy constable, to execute all orders, citations, summons, seizures and writs in civil cases, and in such cases services made by other than said constable or his duly appointed deputy constable shall be void and of no effect.\n\n13:3479. Operation of watercraft by non-resident as appointment of secretary of state as agent for service of process\n\nThe operation, navigation or maintenance by a non-resident or non-residents of a boat, ship, barge of other watercraft in the state, either in person or through others, and the acceptance thereby by such non-resident or non-residents of the protection of the laws of the state for such watercraft, or the operation, navigation or maintenance by a non-resident or non-residents of a boat, ship, barge or other watercraft in the state, either in person or through others, other than under the laws of the state, shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by each such non-resident of the Secretary of State, or his successor in office or some other person in his office during his absence he may designate, to be the true and lawful attorney of each such non-resident for service of process, upon whom may be served all lawful process in any suit, action or proceeding against such non-resident or non-residents growing out of any accident or collision in which such non-resident or non-residents may be involved while, either in person or through others, operating, navigating or maintaining a boat, ship, barge or other watercraft in the state; and such acceptance or such operating, navigating or maintaining in the state of such water craft shall be a signification of each such non-resident’s agreement that any such process against him which is so served shall be of the same legal force and effect as if served on him personally.\n\n13:3480. Service of citation on secretary of state; sending or delivering notice and copies; filing receipt or affidavit; continuances\n\nService of citation in any case provided in R.S. 13:3479 shall be made by serving a copy of the petition and citation on the secretary of state, or his successor in office, and such service shall be sufficient service upon any such non-resident; provided that notice of such service, together with a copy of the petition and citation are forthwith sent by registered mail by the plaintiff to the defendant, or actually delivered to the defendant, and the defendant’s return receipt, in case notice is sent by registered mail, or affidavit of the party delivering the petition and citation in case notice is made by actual delivery, is filed in the proceedings before judgment can be rendered against any such non-resident. The court in which the action is pending may order such continuances as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to defend the action.\n\n13:3481. Service of any other process on secretary of state\n\nService of any process other than citation in any case provided by R.S. 13:3479 shall be made by serving a copy thereof on the secretary of state, and such service shall be sufficient service upon any such non-resident.\n\n13:3482. Not to affect other methods of process against non-residents R.S. 13:3479 through 13:3481\n\nNothing in R.S. 13:3479 through 13:3481 shall be construed as affecting other methods of process against non-residents as now provided by existing laws.\n\n13:3483. Service in suits arising from sale or manufacture of sugar cane or syrup\n\nIn all cases provided in R.S. 13:3232 where suit is brought in the parish in which the domicile of defendant is not situated, service of petition, citation and other process shall be made by delivering the same to the agent, overseer or manager of the factory of defendant.\n\n13:3484.

If service is made as authorized in this section, the serving deputy, constable, or marshal shall make the return showing the manner in which service was made, and mail it to the sheriff for filing in the issuing court. When a party has requested service, as authorized in this section, whether the sheriff complies with the request or not, the only mileage for which the sheriff may charge is for the actual distance from the home or office, whichever is lesser, of the deputy, constable, or marshal to the place where service is to be made, and return. The sheriff may also charge the actual cost of mailing the process and return, if service is made as authorized in this section.\n\nThe sheriff is not responsible for the performance or nonperformance of duties in making the service and return thereon by the constable or marshal to whom the process is mailed for service.\n\n13:3485. Appointment of agent for service of process by nonresident individual or partnership no defense to nonresident attachment unless notice filed with secretary of state\n\nThe appointment of an agent for the service of process by a nonresident individual or partnership is no defense to an attachment of property on the grounds of the non residence of the defendant unless a written notice of such appointment, setting forth the name and address of the agent, has been filed with the secretary of state. The secretary of state shall keep available for public inspection a record of all such appointments, and the dates thereof.\n\nYou should contact a Louisiana Process Server if you have specific questions about Process Serving in Louisiana."
