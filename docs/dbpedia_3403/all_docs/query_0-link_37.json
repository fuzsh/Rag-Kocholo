The aim is to create a modestly priced, relaxed and informal social event which enhances the Livery’s reputation for outstanding fellowship. It is open to all Liverymen, their partners, friends and business associates and provides an admirable occasion for new comers to find out more about the Livery.\n\nOn November 11 the Master accompanied by his wife Debbie welcomed 18 Liverymen and their guests to sparkling wine reception in the Court Room at Ironmongers’ followed by a delicious three course lunch with plentiful wine and coffee.

In later Centuries this was no longer the case as lead pipes supplied water into and around buildings. Lead has made way to copper and thermoplastics. The work of a plumber now covers many fields with sub specialties. The CIPHE has recently adopted a 21st Century definition of a plumber. Click on the header above for details.\n\nDefinition of Plumbing 2013\n\nThe CIPHE Board of Trustees has adopted the definition below and willbe reviewing it at intervals.\n\n• The competent design, specification, installation and maintenance of all distribution and retrieval pipework systems for the transportation of fluids, both liquid and gaseous for domestic, non-domestic industrial and medical facilities.\n\n• The provision of relevant advice, selection and installation of all methods of energy generation and conservation.\n\n• Ensuring that all terminal fittings, sanitary appliances, controls and equipment allow safe and efficient operation of systems whilst protecting the environment and all individuals.\n\n• The protection and preservation of buildings and structures against damage, due to ingress of rainwater by the application of suitable weathering materials.\n\nLiveryman awarded Honorary Fellowship of SoPHE\n\nPublished on Saturday, 16th November 2013\n\nPresident Chris Northey presents Prof Cartwright with the Honorary Fellowship\n\nThe Society of Public Health Engineers has awarded an Honorary Fellowship to Past Master Professor Rodney Cartwright in recognition of his work to improve standards of the public health infrastructure in many parts of the world.

This bi-ennial event is the largest single fundraising event for the Red Cross in the Square Mile and plays a vital role in raising urgently needed funds for the British Red Cross. In 2011, the Market raised a net amount of £911,38S and Alderman John Garbutt & Solangela Tangarife, co-Chairmen of this year’s event, very much hope to match this figure.\n\nA great opportunity to support the Red Cross along with many Liverymen in the historic Guildhall.\n\nThe Lord Mayor’s Show\n\nPublished on Sunday, 10th November 2013\n\nThe Lord Mayor\n\nOur Bus\n\nSupporting Apprentices\n\nSome of the Girls\n\nIt was wet\n\nVery WET\n\nThe Upper Warden (Our Boss for the day) & His Lady\n\nA wet but great Lord Mayor’s Show.

Apart from a short declaration of office by the in-coming Lord Mayor not a word is spoken. The lights are lowered for an atmospheric occasion. It is one on which the new Lord Mayor is sworn in and the retiring Lord Mayor passes on his symbols of office to the new Lord Mayor.\n\nThe principal items passed include the sword, sceptre, seal and inventory of the Corporations possessions (for which the new Lord Mayor takes responsibility) It is a ceremony full of dignity and ritual with much bowing, or ‘reverences’ as they are called, as the symbols of Mayoralty pass from the old Lord Mayor to the new one.\n\nPlumbing Craft at Singleton\n\nPublished on Monday, 4th November 2013\n\nRead about the Plumber’s Display on page 7 of the Weald & Downland Open Air Museum Autumn News.

John Bell Wilkinson recognised the importance of the proper training of apprentices in plumbing and in 1913 presented the JB Wilkinson Apprentice Merit Shield Award. The shield is presented annually to one of the northern colleges who train plumbers – Carlisle College, Gateshead College, Hartlepool College, Newcastle College, Northumberland College and Kendal College. The student from one of the colleges who has obtained the highest mark in the national plumbing examinations is also recognised.\n\nQualified members of the Newcastle and District Branch of the CIPHE judge the winner of this prestigious award and to this day the presentation. Is attended by the Master of the Worshipful Company of Plumbers and the President of the CIPHE.\n\nOn this the centenary of the award, a special presentation dinner was held at The Royal Station Hotel in Newcastle. Organised by the Newcastle and District Branch of the CIPHE, those attending included representatives of all the participating colleges, the President and Chief Executive of the CIPHE, the Master, Wardens, six Past Masters and the Clerk of the WCP and many local plumbers.\n\nThe Shield was presented by Mr Charles Yuill, the Master to a tutor from the New College Durham and to the winning student Craig Milburn. Dr Steven Ingles, President of the CIPHE made presentations to the top students from the other colleges.\n\nA thoroughly enjoyable and memorable evening. We congratulate the organisers but above all the college tutors and the apprentices. We look forward to the next 100 years.\n\nThe Shepherd Master\n\nPublished on Monday, 14th October 2013\n\nThe Master Plumber and his Lady took part in a Charity Sheep Drive on Sunday 29th September, organised by the Worshipful Company of Woolmen. Along with thirty six other Liveries, funds were raised by Masters exercising their ancient right to drive the sheep across the bridge. As you can see the Master Plumber developed his own technique for ensuring compliance from the sheep – this in turn drew some quizzical looks, mainly from the sheep!\n\nThere are many theories and legends about this ancient right, perhaps the most likely was the way the original Guilds controlled standards of work and the suitability of tradesmen to be apprenticed to their Master. If a tradesman did not come up to the required standard, the Guild in question could destroy all their tools as well as their work: and we all know that sending someone to Coventry was to send them out of the City to the nearest place where their bad name would not follow them – 100 miles away in Coventry. So it is most likely that the Freemen in medieval times had the right to carry their proven tools into the City across London Bridge. The tools of the Woolmen were their sheep, and as one of the oldest Livery Companies in the City of London it is easy to see how tools and sheep became synonymous as they drove their sheep to market in the City.\n\nLooking for a WaterSafe Plumber?\n\nPublished on Monday, 14th October 2013\n\nClick here.\n\nDownloadable documents\n\nFind a Plumber\n\nThe Autumn City Briefing\n\nPublished on Thursday, 10th October 2013\n\nClick here to see the contents.\n\nDownloadable documents\n\nCity Briefing\n\nLadle Dinner\n\nPublished on Monday, 7th October 2013\n\nThe Senior Steward and Stewards invite you to join them in entertaining the Master and Wardens and in honouring the Immediate Past Master, Charles Yuill, at the 2013 Ladle Dinner on Wednesday 27th November 2013.

Click on header for details.\n\nOn Sunday, 6th October, 2013, The Master together with twenty other Liverymen, their partners and guests visited The Bluebell Railway located close to Sheffield Park in East Sussex.\n\nThe Bluebell Railway runs for 11 miles between Sheffield Park and on to the newly extended line to East Grinstead.\n\nMost participants arrived at the Sheffield Park station in good time to partake in a “full English breakfast”, prior to boarding the train! On this occasion, we were fortunate to be pulled by a steam locomotive 9F (92212), built in 1959 and originating from Western Region. We were reliably informed by the train aficionados in the party (namely The Master and Henry Clarke) that the locomotive was designed by “Riddles”, was a “2.10.0” with a “Bristol Area Shed Code 82F”!! We had reserved seats which were situated in the “Third Class” coach, which nevertheless proved more than adequate for our trip.\n\nThe eleven mile journey took approximately 45 minutes each way, passing through wooded countryside, which unfortunately was not displaying the beautiful “Autumn Colours”, which might be expected at this time of year, through a lack of night frosts. Brief stops were made at the intermediate stations of Horsted Keynes and Kingscote to pick up more passengers. The trip included passing through the UK’s longest railway tunnel in the ownership of any preserved railway.\n\nThe interregnum between the two journeys provided an excellent opportunity for the passengers to disembark, observe the locomotive turning round using the “run around loop” at East Grinstead and to take lots of memorable photographs.\n\nOn returning to Sheffield Park, many enjoyed a well-earned carvery, before visiting the “loco” sheds and railway museum, both of which were on site.\n\nThe Bluebell Railway recently won The Queen’s Award for Volunteers, the first preserved railway to do so.\n\nFor those with energy to spare, a visit to the nearby Sheffield Park Gardens beckoned.\n\nIn summary, an excellent day out was had by all, made all the more memorable by the enthusiasm of all of the railway volunteers, and the beautiful weather.\n\nSteward Ian Smith\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Plumbers Welcomes WaterSafe\n\nPublished on Friday, 4th October 2013\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Plumbers is pleased to announce its support of newly-launched WaterSafe, the UK’s first ever industry-wide plumbing assurance scheme designed to heighten standards within the UK’s plumbing sector.\n\nAbout WaterSafe\n\nLaunched on 8th October 2013, WaterSafe is a brand new national plumbing assurance scheme with the aim of providing recognition for competent plumbers and assurance to customers seeking water supply plumbing work.\n\nWaterSafe is supported by all UK water suppliers and owned by the seven existing Approved Contractors’ Schemes operating in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland including:\n\nThe Water Industry Approved Plumbers’ Scheme (WIAPS); Association of Plumbing and Heating Contractors (APHC); Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering (CIPHE); Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employers’ Federation (SNIPEF)\n\nAnglian Water’s A Plus scheme; Severn Trent Water’s WaterMark scheme; Thames Water’s TAPS scheme\n\nWaterSafe is the first plumbing body of its kind, with a new dedicated online search facility and assurance scheme designed to provide recognition for competent plumbers.

WaterSafe brings together all of the approved contractors’ schemes in the UK operated by water companies and trade associations. It allows users to find an approved plumbing business wherever they are and rest assured that these recognised plumbers are fully qualified to carry out the work in their home.\n\nThe official launch was marked today with a prestigious event at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster, where key stakeholders from the water and plumbing industry got together to take part in a series of presentations on the WaterSafe scheme. This included speeches from Andy Foster, operations and policy director at The Trading Standards Institute, Lvy Kevin Wellman, CEO of CIPHE and Lvy Colin Stainer, a practising plumber.\n\nChris Sneath, Chairman of WaterSafe and a Past Master of the Plumbers Company said “The Industry has been striving for such a scheme for over a hundred years and we welcome its arrival at long last.”\n\n“By simplifying the process of choosing a plumber, WaterSafe effectively brings together all UK water company and trade association approved contractors’ schemes, including our WaterMark scheme, under one umbrella organisation so that customers can be assured of having a competent and qualified plumber every time. As well as promoting good plumbing practice and compliance with the Water Fittings Regulations, the scheme will help to drive out rogue plumbers and give approved plumbing businesses the recognition they deserve.”\n\nThe WaterSafe scheme brings together the seven existing Approved Contractors’ Schemes operating in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is supported by all of the water companies and key plumbing bodies in the UK.\n\nSt Michael’s Day Service with sound\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 2nd October 2013\n\nThe Master and members of the Livery attended the annual St Michael’s Day service at our church – St Magnus the Martyr.

Read about the visit by clicking the header above.\n\nOn 9th September 2013 the Master Charles Yuill and a group of liverymen visited Spencer House, St James’s. Built 1756-1766 as an aristocratic town house for John, the first Earl Spencer and his wife, Margaret, an ancestor of Diana, Princess of Wales, it is the only eighteenth century private palace to survive intact. Their marriage was very happy, and is celebrated throughout the house. Earl Spencer and his wife the Countess were prominent figures in London society and entertained lavishly. The Earl had been on the Grand Tour and was very influenced by the Classical revival.\n\nJohn Spencer originally employed the Palladian architect John Vardy, a student of William Kent. Vardy was responsible for the external elevations and the design of the ground floor including some of the furniture.\n\nJames Stuart superseded Vardy as architect in 1758. Newly returned from Greece, he was responsible for the accurate Greek detail to the interior decoration, an early example of neo-classical architecture on the upper floors.\n\nWhen Earl Spencer died in 1783, the architect Henry Holland was appointed to remodel the house. He added the Greek Ionic columns in the Dining Room encased in Siena Scagliola, a substance that imitates marble and other hard stones.\n\nThe Victorian Spencers, had different taste but lived in the house until 1895 when the house was let to a series of tenants.\n\nDuring the Blitz of World War II the house was stripped of its few remaining treasures, specially made furniture and fireplaces were taken to Althorp, their country estate.\n\nThe present lease is for 125 years from 1985 to Lord Jacob Rothschild who has enthusiastically restored the house to its former glory, with the cooperation of the Spencer family, money no object it is a benchmark restoration. Using paints by Farrow and Ball, the colours are faithful to the eighteenth century originals. The paintings and furniture are a mixture of copies and originals.\n\nThere are eight state rooms, which can be hired for events, our tour began in the Ante room where the Earl would have done business. Most notable is the apsidal alcove inspired by the Temple of Venus in Rome and the Classical paintings.\n\nThe Library with Regency French doors overlooking the private garden and Green Park.\n\nThe Dining room has a ceiling based on the Inigo Jones ceiling in Banqueting House, columns covered in Scagiola with ionic capitals, original side tables at either end and paintings by Benjamin West which were lent by the Queen.\n\nThe Palm Room, where the men retired after dinner, has carved and gilded palm trees with a frieze of Griffins and candelabra. Griffins are particularly apt as the heraldic supporter of the Spencer arms.\n\nThe Music Room which now has the Olympic Torch on the table as the house was used by the Olympic Committee during the Olympics.\n\nLady Spencer’s Room, a private drawing room where Lady Spencer received her guests has a classical ceiling and frieze.\n\nThe Great Room, intended for receptions and balls has a picture gallery and is the most imposing of all the State rooms.\n\nThe Painted Room, a celebration of the Triumph of Love, in particular Lord and Lady Spencer’s happy marriage.\n\nOur tour over the Master thanked our guide and we made our way through the rain to our lunch at The Holiday Inn, Mayfair.\n\nReport by Steward Daphne Barber\n\nThe Plumbers’ Table at Ironmongers’ Hall\n\nPublished on Sunday, 29th September 2013\n\nMonday 11th November\n\nIt’s\n\n– What you have all been waiting for!\n\n– After two amazingly successful “Plumbers ’Table” lunches at Ironmongers’ Hall we are organising a third!\n\n– Open to all Liverymen, their business and private guests, wives and partners!\n\n– Amazing value; last year’s prices have been held for us!\n\n– Unnecessary to book weeks in advance!\n\nWhat is on offer\n\n– A sparkling wine reception; – A 3 course lunch with choices; – Half a bottle of wine or juices; – Coffee\n\nClick here for further details.\n\nThe Plumbers’ say thank you\n\nPublished on Thursday, 26th September 2013\n\nThe Master, Wardens and their Ladies\n\nThe Master and Principal Guests\n\nThe Plumbers’ Autumn Festival is the occasion when we formally recognise the huge contribution made by the Ladies, husbands, consorts and friends to the smooth running of the Company.

After pre dinner drinks taken in the stunning Reception Room the Beadle invited us to move into the sumptuous Livery Hall for dinner.\n\nAfter the Master, Wardens and principal guests processed into the Hall, the Clerk said grace which was followed by a warm welcome from the Master. The first of two delightful musical interludes followed the first course, performed by students from the Guild Hall School of Music and Drama. The performers included the Plumbers’ sponsored student Chloe Treharne a mezzosoprano.\n\nIt was soon time for the Renter Warden Stephen Hodkinson to welcome and then propose a toast to the Ladies and the guests.

Other Livery Companies taking part included the Loriners,the Fire Fighters and the World Traders. The good weather this summer has been very kind to us and this was no exception. We played on a beautiful course in excellent condition on a pleasant warm day. What could be better?\n\nThe golf was followed by a superb lunch and the day finished in time for us to drive home before the rush hour. David Hannam was in good form and won third prize with a score of 36 points. We are invited to take part again next year and the Painter-Stainers anticipate that other Livery Companies will swell the numbers. Hopefully more of our members will appreciate how enjoyable this event is. We have now completed our programme for 2013. It has been an excellent summer with opportunities to play on a variety of courses.\n\nNext year it is hoped that we can repeat this but we can improve on it if we have a larger number of participants. Come on, golfers, join the Golf Society and enjoy the company of your fellow liverymen on the golfcourse. There are a selection of events from May to September to choose from. West Essex , Walton Heath, Verulam, Sunningdale Ladies, New Zealand and Wildernesse.\n\nContact Don Munro , the Secretary, for more details.\n\nThe World’s Most Exclusive Whisky Auction\n\nPublished on Monday, 9th September 2013\n\nThe 17th of October will see many of the World’s foremost Scotch Whisky collectors, as well as senior industry figures, attend the Worshipful Company of Distillers’ auction at Apothecaries’ Hall.

Click on the header to see a report of this fascinating trip.\n\nOur guide David explained that Claude Graham White bought the rural site in 1910. The site was handed over to the government during the first world war. The aerodrome was used for flying up till 1960. The Museum itself was opened in 1972, by then the suburbs of North London had crept up and some fifteen acres of land was sold off. David worked with the developers to dismantle and re-erect the Green Hanger housing the WWI aircraft and Graham White’s Grade II listed Watch Office under the supervision of English Heritage. Original Materials were used where possible. It was here that we paused for a photograph with the Master sitting at Graham White’s desk.\n\nThe Museum has a close relationship with the RAF and every fortnight recruits come for a lecture on History and Heritage.\n\nThe Green Hanger houses the early aeroplanes, Louis Bleriot’s 1911 yellow racing aeroplane, to the Sopwith Camel, which was lubricated with castor oil, hence Castrol, Albatross, Avro and Vickers Vimy of Alcock and Brown.\n\nSir Henry Royce an engineer who copied the Mercedes overhead cam shaft for his engines, which were named after birds of prey.\n\nWe moved on past the Sunderland flying boat and on to the Milestones of flight where a Typhoon F35, a Fokker D VII, a Mosquito, Harrier jump jet, a balloon basket and others some are suspended from the ceiling. There is a time line of flight with the exact distance of Orville and Wright’s flight 10.35, 17th December 1903 from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.\n\nNext was Bomber Hall, and tributes to Henry Allingham who died aged 113 in 2009 who was an RAF veteran of both world wars, Roy Chadwick aeroplane designer and bomber command whose memorial is in Green Park and who flew the Halifax, Liberator and Lancaster bombers.\n\nFrom there the Norman Foster ‘Nissan Hut’ Battle of Britain hall where we admired the construction of the Spitfire next to it was a shiny red helicopter of the Queen’s flight.\n\nTour over lunch was served at the Refuel Restaurant.\n\nArmed Forces Awards of Excellence\n\nPublished on Tuesday, 6th August 2013\n\nLCpl David Bolton, The Master, SAC(T) Tim Benson\n\nAt the July Court the Company Armed Services Awards were presented to LCpl David Bolton, who attained the highest marks in the Army Plumbers Training Course, and SAC(T) Tim Benson, who attained the highest marks in the RAF Hydraulics Phase of the Airframe Training Course.

The charity helps people use technology in the fight against poverty. It works in partnership with communities to develop practical answers to their problems, based on local knowledge and skills and putting peoples’ needs first. For example a family in Kenya has been given solar powered water pumps to grow their own vegetables. They now sell them at the local market instead of buying them.

The reason was they were attending the AGM of the Sheriffs’ and Recorder’s Fund. The Fund is dedicated to helping as many people as possible with small, practical, focused grants. Grants are made with regard only to the needs of the individuals and their dependants, irrespective of age, gender, race or offence.\n\nThis worthy cause is well supported by the Livery but there are many ex-offenders who would be able to make a new start in life if more support was forthcoming.

We started with champagne at St Pancras station at 7.30 in the morning of Friday before boarding a Eurostar train for Lille.\n\nTransferring to a coach (with a bit of a walk!) we journeyed to Ypres for lunch and a visit to the museum. Then on to our hotel in Bruges. With barely a pause we boarded our next transport – horse drawn carriage for a trip round the city finishing at a restaurant for a very convivial dinner.\n\nSaturday morning commenced with a boat trip then a visit to the Bruges historical museum. No trip to Bruges would be complete without a visit to a chocolate factory so this was undertaken before we split for lunch.\n\nThe evening saw a procession of Plumbers in evening attire moving from the hotel to the Provinciaal Hof in the city square. Here we were welcomed by Mrs Mieke Hoste, the Alderman for Tourism, in the Raadzaal (council chamber). This was followed by a drinks reception before dinner in the historic Balkonzaal (Balcony Room) overlooking the square.\n\nSunday saw us back in Ypres for a battlefield tour with many sombre stories of bravery and the futility of war. Then back to Lille and the Eurostar to London.\n\nA weekend of fun and fellowship. If you have not been on a Master’s weekend do not miss next year.\n\nFor more photos click here.\n\nA Report from the School of Engineering at More House School, Farnham\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 3rd July 2013\n\nThis important development which is being supported by a grant from the Worshipful Company of Plumbers Charity. The School is private but funded by the local authority. All students and there are 400, are of average ability, and diagnosed with specific learning difficulties, language and social communication problems. Because of this, each pupil receives their own specific course work and tuition tailored to their individual needs. The school is only one of two in the country that has achieved “Outstanding Grade” for OFTEC. Quite something considering the learning difficulties.\n\nHowever, because of the importance of this project and the relevance of the Plumbing courses that they will undertake, I hope that through the circulation of the report we could find means to assist them further.\n\nWe can either do this through further funding or to ask for additional materials listed on Page 2 which they can keep in stock for later courses and their ‘Junior Plumbing Club”. For instance they need two radiators. Should not be too difficult for us to find?!\n\nIf you have any ideas and/or suggestions, then do please let Past Master Chris Sneath or the Clerk know.\n\nTo obtain report click here.\n\nDownloadable documents\n\nGrant Report\n\nPublic Health: Working together to improve outcomes\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 3rd July 2013\n\nYou are invited to attend this event on 2nd October 2013, The Barbican, London.\n\nSubjects to be discussed on the day include:\n\nImproving Public Health Outcomes: Developing integrated and locally tailored solutions\n\nTackling health Inequalities – What progress since the Marmot Review?\n\nMeeting complex needs, tackling local problems\n\nLocal action: Tackling obesity and related conditions\n\nAlcohol-related harm\n\nClick here for details.\n\nLivery Committee briefing\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 26th June 2013\n\nA note for all Liverymen.

Ltd. – a much respected Wine Merchant in the city.\n\nWe sat assembled and armed with spittoons and crackers at the ready and sampled around nine wines red and white and of varying prices. Each glass was expertly introduced by Christopher who informed on its region, producer and provenance in a highly engaging and entertaining manner. Whilst enjoying a light supper after the event, during which there was a chance to place orders, we all felt that we had learned a little more – and had been privileged to have fully sampled some beautiful wines.

The Order is a major international charity, which was granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria in 1888. It runs an ophthalmic hospital in Jerusalem and, through St John Ambulance, provides first aid training and uniformed volunteers for public events. However, the Order also traces its origins back 900 years to the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem.\n\nFounded in the eleventh century to care for poor and sick pilgrims to the Holy Land, the Knights Hospitallers were formally recognized by the Pope in 1113. When the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land fell in 1291, the Knights settled first in Cyprus, then on the island of Rhodes (1310–1523) and later in Malta (1530–1798), over which they were sovereign. The Order was financed by estates across Europe. In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte occupied Malta for its strategic value during his Egyptian campaign and the Knights were forced to leave Malta, finally settling in Rome, which is now the headquarters of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.\n\nAn attempt in the 1830s to revive an English Priory of the Sovereign Military Order was unsuccessful as its members are exclusively Roman Catholic. Accordingly a separate Order of St John came into existence, which quickly gained recognition from the British Royal Family. For its headquarters the Most Venerable Order acquired and restored St John’s Gate (see picture), built in 1504 by Prior Thomas Docwra as the south entrance to the inner precinct of the Priory that ran the Order’s English estates. The Priory was dissolved at the time of the Reformation, but the Tudor gatehouse and the twelfth-century crypt of the Priory Church still remain. St John’s Gate has recently been redeveloped at a cost of £3.6 million with new museum galleries and visitor facilities. Ably guided by Norman Gooding, an officer of the Order, members of the Company received a fascinating tour of the buildings and learned a great deal about the history and work of the Order of St John. The sun, remarkably, shone and we finished an enjoyable excursion with lunch at The Crown Tavern on Clerkenwell Green.\n\nSteward Michael Cooper\n\nWaterSafe – Hot off the Press\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 19th June 2013\n\nRead the latest news on WaterSafe.

He was first elected (as a Liberal Democrat) in 1999.\n\nIn his speech of acceptance at today’s annual meeting of the council at County Hall, Northallerton, Councillor Bateman looked forward to a busy year in the lead up to the Tour de France next July, and said he would be promoting the event throughout his term of office “to ensure we get the maximum economic advantages, both during the event but also in the longer term with the worldwide coverage it will receive.”\n\nHe said he would make the development of business across North Yorkshire a priority, and that he is looking forward to visiting schools – particularly sixth forms – “to talk to them about what we do as a county council, and the need for them to become involved.”\n\nCouncillor Bateman acknowledged that local government faces difficult times, but said despite the economic austerity of the past four years the council had managed to freeze council tax while at the same time maintaining services and achieving savings.\n\nCouncillor Bateman, who is 69, began his career in local government as a member of Cardiff City Council. He moved from Wales to North Yorkshire in 1978 when the company for which he worked appointed him Sales and Marketing Director of Yorkshire Heating Ltd, later to become Plumb Center.\n\nHe has been the chief executive of a number of companies, is a Freeman of the City of London, and in 1989 was appointed an MBE for services to industry. He is married to Linda, and has two sons – Liam, a chartered accountant, and Nicholas, a company director. He lives at Melmerby, near Ripon.\n\nGolf – Prince Arthur Cup\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 22nd May 2013\n\nAs a new member of the Worshipful Company of Plumbers Golf Society, I was privileged to have as my first event the Prince Arthur Cup held at the magnificent Walton Heath Golf Club in Surrey on May 16th. The Plumbers submitted a team of four: Our Captain Don Munro, Tony Walters, Anthony Lowe and me Richard Harvey.\n\nWe were all a little apprehensive of the weather as the days leading up to the event were positively awful,but the sun shone on the righteous and we got some too. The first 18 holes were followed by a very substantial lunch,and then 18 more and despite a minor wardrobe failure in my team I am pleased to report that the Plumbers came a very respectable mid table. The wonderful day concluded with a cream tea (to die for) and prize giving and although we did not trouble the latter,we all thoroughly\n\nappreciated the former. Well done the Coachmakers for organising all 212 Liverymen of all abilities on such a prestigious event. I can’t wait for my next appearance.\n\nRichard Harvey, Senior Steward\n\nRogue Trainers in Plumbing\n\nPublished on Tuesday, 21st May 2013\n\nWhat are other Plumbers opinions of these “Become a Plumber in x amount of weeks and earn £50k a year” courses!\n\nI for one, with the help of others would like to discredit them. My opinions are based on 3 main factors. 1 I have never earned £50k a year first off and certainly not even close when I first qualified. I find this inaccurate and gives people the wrong reasons to get into our industry. We need more Plumbers yes but we need people who are qualified correctly and wanting to provide a professional service not just chasing the money, our profession suffers a terrible depiction in the media and this type of person entering it doesn’t help others who are trying to promote a professional trade. 2&3 My next points are really linked. I served a a traditional apprenticeship in the UK over 3 years and gained my NVQ’s Level 2 & 3, It has been 15 years trading now and I still don’t know all I need to and have to get advise from some of my more experienced peers, of which I am grateful. My 3rd point is linked here, my Dad is a Plumber of nearly 50 years time served City and Guilds, a fountain of knowledge and experience, but he has not sat his ACS for his Gas for over 12 years, here is my point, we have been working with one of these so called Plumbers who has attended one of this 10 week courses and managed somehow to get themselves on the Gas Safe register! This guy know nothing he has followed this route and now he is somehow more qualified than my father with all his experience, how can this be possible? Now my father is packing up not enough work about with more and more of these Plumbers on the scene, they’ve got the sign written van and wear the snickers trousers, you know the sort. What I am interested in is others opinions and experiences of this new breed of Plumber and whether others would have any ideas of how to discredit? I feel very strongly about this from personal experience, let me know. Thanks.\n\nClick on header above to see the CIPHE response endorsed by the Worshipful Company of Plumbers\n\nResponse from Liveryman Kevin Wellman, CEO of CIPHE\n\nThe CIPHE is vehemently opposed to ‘Rogue Trainers’ and in January this year issued a press release to that effect. Last year we established an Education & Training Group which is promoting best practice through bona fide colleges and training centres. Although the minimum industry standard in England and Wales is Level 2 NVQ I believe this should be Level 3 as it is in Scotland (SVQ 3).\n\nConsidering the technolgical advances within our industry in recent years it is even more important to ensure professional installers are competent and that appropriate training, education and CPD is available to them. Belonging to a industry body such as the CIPHE provides professional recognition and technical support for qualifid and competent installers.\n\nThe CIPHE has co-operated with investigations into rogue trainers but often very little can be done as some of the companies concerned enter into liquidation and shortly after commence trading under a different name. If anyone has evidence or experience of rogue trainers please do let me know.\n\nWith regards to the Severn Trent scheme, along with other similar Approved Contractor Person schemes it will soon come under the auspices of WaterSafe. The two trade associations: APHC and SNIPEF are founder members of WaterSafe as is the CIPHE – the professional body for the plumbing and heating industry.\n\nCIPHE members have been advised of the new WaterSafe scheme through the p&he journal and the trade associations have promoted it to their member firms in recent weeks.\n\nFinally, if you want to your voice to be heard or wish to influence future industry policy please let the CIPHE know, perhaps by direct involvement with one of our working groups. If you are competent, qualified and experienced you might even be eligible for membership.\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Plumbers strongly endorses this response.\n\nFor more informative discussion including contributions from Past Master Chris Sneath click here\n\nEvents and News\n\nPublished on Tuesday, 21st May 2013\n\nVisit to RAF Museum Hendon: 23rd July\n\nOpened in 1972 by Her Majesty The Queen and situated on the historic site of Hendon’s London Aerodrome in Colindale, the Museum is London’s only attraction to house over 100 aircraft from around the world including some very early aircraft designs through to the latest modern day jets and military aircraft.\n\nDetails and booking form.

Admission free. HQS Wellinton, then HMS Wellington played an active part in the Battle of the Atlantic. For further details click here.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, HMS Wellington was recalled to Britain from service patrolling in the Pacific region, the task for which she had been built in 1934. For most of the war, the ship carried out convoy escort duties across the North Atlantic and off the coast of West Africa. She was based first in Devonport, then in Liverpool and finally in Londonderry.\n\nDuring her war service, Wellington steamed more than 240,000 miles and provided escort either alone or in part to 103 convoys. She rescued more than 450 merchant navy crew who had survived the sinking of their ships and also shared in the destruction of one German U-Boat.\n\nTo augment the Battle of the Atlantic exhibition, there are a number of evening events planned for the remainder of this year. Venue: On board HQS Wellington\n\nDetails are yet to be advised, but dates for your diary are as follows:\n\n6.15 for 7.00pm\n\nMay 28 Film – Atlantic Convoys (6.30pm start)\n\nJun 17 Film – The Cruel Sea (6.30pm start)\n\nJul 15 North Atlantic Air Cover Captain Rod Brown & Commander Sue Eagles\n\nAug 12 The Two Cunard Queens in the Battle of the Atlantic\n\nSep 09 BP Tankers – Service and Sacrifice Ian Stockbridge\n\nSep 23 Vice Admiral Sir Peter Gretton, Escort Group Commander\n\nOct 21 Merchant Ships in Conflict Gp Captain Ted Scaplehorn\n\nNov 11 Arctic Convoys – Attempting the Impossible Captain Richard Woodman\n\nDec 9 The Battle of the Atlantic from the U-boats’ perspective Rear Admiral John Lang\n\nThe Livery Yacht Race\n\nPublished on Sunday, 19th May 2013\n\n(BackRow) Dennis Southern, Mike Swallow, Peter Smith, Martin Gratte, Mike Samuel (Captain), Joe Sibthorpe, David Hamilton, Chris Sneath, (FrontRow) Paul Nash (The Clerk), Ian Puddick, Andy Hunter, Steve Hodkinson\n\nThe Crew\n\nThe Plumbers’ have won the Lord Mayor’s Cup and the Champions Cup in the City Livery Yacht Club Regatta.\n\nClick on heading.\n\nCity Livery Yacht Club Cowes Regatta\n\n18th May 2013\n\nThe Plumbers’ won the Lord Mayor’s Cup and the Champion Cup in the City Livery Yacht Club Cowes Regatta on Saturday 18th May 2013.\n\nA highly successful annual regatta took place again at Cowes on 18th May 2013 with 18 boats taking part.\n\nThe Plumber’s boat was kindly provided by Gratte Bros and was a Beneteau First 40 and with plenty of room for our full crew of 13 able-bodied men including the assistance of our helmsman Andy Hunter, a Painter Stainer!\n\nThe lack of wind meant that the race was delayed and shortened but we did get underway by about 12:30 and we headed east with the tide. All boats except one were over the line cleanly and the weather meant the first half became very technical with all the fleet trying different ways to catch what little wind there was and to use the tide to the best advantage.\n\nSeveral boats arrived at the first mark together, we took an inside line and positioned ourselves well for a close haul to Quinnell against the tide. The wind was highly variable with our boat speed below 1 knot at times. Some boats went further north to catch more wind but we held our course doing short tacks to catch the best wind. All crew had to move gently across the boat – the skipper said we had to be ‘cat like’ and the crew on the fore deck simply rolled across on a tack! Some took the opportunity for a lie down!\n\nThis tactic really paid off and as we went south of Bramble Bank the wind slowly filled from the west and we were well in the lead and able to take an early advantage. Soon our boat speed was up and as we approached Quinnell we were over 6 knots in 12 knots of wind – really moving!\n\nWe rounded the mark and eased the main slightly to head to Bainbridge International still with a good boat speed across the strong Solent tide. Once around the mark we headed for home with the tide and the wind helping us. We crossed the finish line well ahead of the rest of the fleet.\n\nWe still had no idea whether we had won the race – we had to wait for the evening when all the handicap calculations had been completed. In the end we had won by only 2 minutes (corrected for handicap) and the first four boats we all within a few minutes of each other!\n\nThe Plumbers were very well represented with thirty people attending the weekend. The Royal Corinthian Yacht Club looked after us really well with a splendid buffet on the Friday night when the various crews could weigh each other up! The presentation dinner following the race was held in the excellent surroundings of The Royal Yacht Squadron overlooking the Solent.\n\nEveryone really enjoyed the weekend with some of those not sailing doing a strenuous walk from Ryde, others taking to the spectator boat or simply shopping along the High Street in Cowes!\n\nOf course winning the Lord Mayor’s Cup and the Champion Cup made the weekend even better!\n\nStephen Hodkinson\n\nRenter Warden\n\nSong in the City\n\nPublished on Saturday, 18th May 2013\n\nLunchtime and Evening Concerts at The Hall, St Botolph without Bishopsgate.

It looks as though the “Plumbers’ table has become an established part of the Plumbers’ social calendar. Plans are afoot to hold the next one on Monday 11 November. Do come along with friends and business colleagues and help to make it another great success.\n\nLast year our Master Charles Yuill wanted to create a social event which was relaxed and informal. It should reflect the theme for his year of inclusiveness and be open to all Liverymen, their partners, friends, business associates and newcomers interested in finding out more about the Livery. Most important of all it had to be modestly priced. And so the “Plumbers’ Table” at Ironmongers’ was born.\n\nThe first “Plumbers’ Table” was held last November. It was a great success. So much so it was decided to repeat it on 13 May. The Master and his Lady welcomed 20 Liverymen and their guests at a sparkling wine reception followed by an excellent 3 course lunch with plentiful wine and coffee.\n\nIt looks as though the “Plumbers’ table has become an established part of the Plumbers’ social calendar.

The Recital is named after the street in which the GHSMD is located and is awarded every year to a particularly talented singer to enable them to take up their place at the School or continue their postgraduate studies on the Opera Course. The current holder of the award is soprano Lucy Hall, who is supported by the Plumbers.\n\nOur evening commenced with an excellent light supper. We were joined by Barry Ife, the School’s Principal who gave us a particularly interesting overview of the history of the School, its aims and ambitions and links with the City of London. He explained that the GHSMD was the only School in the country to combine music and drama, so it was appropriate that his talk should be followed by a backstage tour of the School’s costume department and theatre workshop. It was amazing what could be achieved in cramped condition and why a move to new premises later in the year will be so welcome!\n\nIt was then on to the main event of the evening; the Silk Street Recital. Lucy Hall was accompanied by next year’s winner of the Silk Street Award mezzo soprano Elizabeth Desbruslais and Rodrigo de Vera on the piano. The programme consisted of 11 duets or solos ranging from Handel’s “Detorrente” from Dixit Dominus to the “Flower Duet” from Lakme and lasted an hour. It was obvious why all 3 performers were prize winners – their performances were stunning!\n\nA drinks reception followed the Recital when we had the opportunity to talk to Lucy, Elizabeth and Rodrigo. It was fascinating to learn about their aims and ambitions but all too soon our wonderful evening came to an end. But on leaving the School we could all reflect on how privileged we were to be able to attend the recital, how heartening is was to see such talented young people achieve high standards and to know that the Livery had been able to help Lucy in her studies.\n\nKeep an eye out for all 3 students. They are the stars of the future and will all go far.\n\nThe Plumbers take a leading role in the Wet 10\n\nPublished on Saturday, 20th April 2013\n\nThe Wet 10, an informal group of City of London Livery Companies which represent both users and suppliers of water, has a new Chairman – Chris Sneath, Past master of the Worshipful Company of Plumbers and Chairman of the Water Safe Board.
