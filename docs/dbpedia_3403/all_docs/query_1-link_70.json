        "text": "The Structure of the Court\n\nThe Composition of the Court\n\nAccording to Article 135 of the Constitution, the Court is composed of fifteen judges. The system of nominations is a delicate balance designed to harmonize various needs: to assure that the judges are as impartial and independent as possible; to guarantee the necessary level of technical legal expertise; to bring a range of different knowledge, experiences, and cultures to the Court, as well as political sensibilities that are not too far removed from those represented in the political institutions of Italy.\n\nThe judges are selected from a restricted category of legal practitioners with a high level of training and experience. These are judges or retired judges from the highest levels of the judiciary (supreme magistrature) – that is, the Supreme Court (Corte di cassazione), the Council of State (Consiglio di Stato), and the Court of Auditors (Corte dei conti) – law professors, and lawyers with at least twenty years’ experience in legal practice. There is no maximum or minimum age limit, but given the requirement of belonging to the senior magistracy, having a high-level academic qualification or long professional experience, judges tend to be appointed to the Court in their fifties, sixties and seventies.\n\nEach judge is appointed for a nine-year term of office (with no age limit) with a mandate that cannot be renewed or extended; at the expiry of the term of office, a judge retires or returns to his former profession. The term of office is longer than that for any other elective mandate provided in the Constitution. This helps guarantee the independence of the constitutional judges, particularly from the political bodies that name a portion of the Court. If a judge leaves office prior to the end of his mandate, due to death, resignation or removal, his substitute is named for nine years by the same body that originally appointed him. As terms have ended early over the years, the fifteen seats on the Court nowadays generally come up for appointment at different times, with the result that the composition of the Court changes gradually. In this way, the Court’s jurisprudence may change over time, but always subject to fundamental underlying continuities.\n\nOne of the fundamental characteristics of the Constitutional Court is that it is a collegial organ whose decisions are taken collectively, not by a single judge or a few judges.\n\nThe Courtyard of Honour of the Palazzo della Consulta as seen in a print by Bernardo Sansone Grilli\n\nWho Selects the Judges?\n\nIn apportioning the power to nominate the members of the Court, the Constitution strikes a delicate and complex balance among the various needs mentioned above. Five judges – a third of the Court – are elected by members drawn from the three superior tribunals (three by the Supreme Court, one by the Council of State, one by the Court of Auditors), by absolute majority vote of the electoral body; if no such majority is obtained, the judges are chosen through a run-off election between those candidates receiving the greatest number of vote. Another five judges are elected by both Houses of Parliament sitting in joint session, by two-thirds majority vote in the first three ballots, and three-fifths in all subsequent ballots. The last five are chosen by the President of the Republic.\n\nThe judges selected by the magistracy bring their own particular legal skills and experiences, and are in no way connected with the choices of political bodies.\n\nThe judges nominated by Parliament (chosen for the most part from academia and the legal profession, but sometimes from among active judges) are more likely to reflect the experiences and political sensibilities found in the representative assemblies and, often, have been Members of the Senate or the Chamber of Deputies. However, the high number of votes required to elect them means that it is not simply up to the parliamentary majority to choose them; normally agreements must be reached among the different political forces in Parliament. While it is true that particular judges appointed by Parliament are indeed chosen by the majority or the opposition, they must then be accepted by both to reach the requisite number of votes. Reaching such a consensus frequently takes a great deal of time and a series of ballots. For this reason when new judges need to be appointed to the Court by Parliament the elections are often delayed, and the Court continues to function with reduced ranks, that is, with fewer than fifteen judges, but never with less than eleven. The judges nominated by Parliament are not representative of, or directed by, the political forces that put forward their nomination, but are, like all the other members of the Court, independent of the political parties and of the Parliament that elected them.\n\nThe five judges appointed by the Head of State are normally chosen to achieve some degree of balance with respect to the choices made by the Parliament, so that the Constitutional Court mirrors the political, legal and cultural pluralism of the country as closely as possible.\n\nThe variety of legal environments from which the judges are drawn and the range of political forces that nominate them encourage the presence of different experiences and specializations (such as criminal, civil, or administrative law), and different backgrounds and attitudes. What counts most of all, however, is that the judges are all equal within the Court, and each makes his own individual contribution to its work.\n\nThere are no groups or “parties” in the Court: each judge puts his own experience and ideas to the service of the Court, regardless of his prior position or the source of his appointment.\n\nIndeed, the limited number of judges, the collegial method used and the exclusive nature of the commitment to the work of the Court (during the term of office judges cannot carry out any other professional activity, and much less political activity), the length of the mandate and the longstanding habit of working together mean that the dynamics of the Court are closely bound up with the personalities of its members. At the same time, since the decisions of the Court are always collectively made, they must always be considered the fruit of a collaborative process that integrates the individual contributions of all the judges.\n\nThe honorary stairway viewed from the courtyard of the Consulta in a print by Bernardo Sansone Grilli\n\nThe Rights, Obligations and Prerogatives of Constitutional Judges\n\nIn order to ensure the judges’ independence (as well as the appearance of their independence), and their dissociation from the interests involved in Court proceedings, members of the Constitutional Court enjoy special prerogatives during their term of office, but are at the same time subject to special obligations.\n\nConstitutional judges cannot be called on to respond officially for the opinions expressed or votes cast in the exercise of their duties, and cannot be subjected to criminal proceedings or deprived of their freedom without the prior authorization of the Court. The Court supplies the judges with all the support necessary to carry out their work. Finally, the judges enjoy a salary which is stipulated by law to be commensurate with that of the President of the Supreme Court, the highest-level career magistrate.\n\nOn the other hand, a constitutional judge may not engage in any other professional activity. This means that those who were magistrates or university professors (if not already retired) must interrupt their career for the duration of their mandate (they are considered “fuori ruolo”), and only return to their former position after leaving office. Those who were active lawyers cannot practise during their term, or remain members of the bar. All forms of paid activity, with the exception of receiving copyright royalties, are prohibited. Constitutional judges are not only debarred from belonging to political parties, but they may not take part in any political activity.\n\nFor the same reason, and as a matter of long-established practice, members of the Constitutional Court refrain from publicly expressing opinions, unless in an academic context, or from giving public interviews on political issues or on questions pending before the Court.\n\nIThe need for the constitutional judges to keep the Court’s inner workings confidential does not release the institution from the duty to make the meaning and scope of its activities known to the general public. As for all decisions taken by judicial bodies, those of the Constitutional Court too are subject to the obligation to provide a reasoning, so that it will always be possible to know and consider the reasons underlying them. However, to ensure that the inevitably highly technical nature of the Court’s work does not prevent a non-legal audience from gaining adequate understanding of its decisions, for some time now, the Court has produced “press releases” on its most important decisions, which it circulates on social and traditional media.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to longstanding tradition, the President of the Constitutional Court meets members of the press every year to present what could be called an “institutional stocktaking” of the Court’s activities. During a special hearing, the President expounds the contents of the most important decisions of the year in question, illustrating emerging trends in case law and answering questions by journalists.\n\nEspecially in recent years, particular attention has been paid to the Court’s use of new technologies, with the restructuring of its website and the use of social media.\n\nThanks to the Court’s opening to civil society, especially with the “Viaggio in Italia” (“Voyage through Italy”) initiative, there are many more opportunities for the Court’s President and judges to publicly express their views, as well as to explain and clarify the meaning of the Court’s most important decisions, all the while observing the duty to refrain from putting their personal opinions before the choices made by the Court.\n\nAt the end of his mandate a judge ceases all his functions within the Court and cannot be re-elected. A retiring judge is conferred the title of “judge emeritus,” and is entitled to a pension (or to the consolidation of the services rendered as judge with that of the profession in which s/he returns) and to end-of-service compensation.\n\nThe Presidency of the Constitutional Court\n\nThe Court elects its President from among its members for a three-year renewable term of office (until 1967, the term was of four years and was also renewable). However, since no judge can remain a member of the Court after the expiry of his nine-year mandate, it is often the case that the President – who is normally chosen from amongst the most senior colleagues in terms of his tenure on the Court – ends his term of office as judge, and hence as President, before three years have passed. This accounts for the relatively short length of the terms of many Presidents of the Court, so that during the Court’s sixty years of existence there have been forty Presidents.\n\nThe President is elected by the judges in a secret ballot, by absolute majority (that is, eight votes in the case of a full Court), and if necessary, a run-off election between the two judges with the most votes after the second ballot. To prevent the outcome of the vote of each individual judge from being known outside the Court, the ballot papers cast in the election are immediately destroyed following the vote. However, recently, the practice of publishing a press release, reporting the name of the President thus elected and the number of votes cast in his or her favour, has been adopted.\n\nThe autonomy enjoyed by the Court in the choice of its President reinforces its collegiality. The President has precisely the same authority as the other judges in the decisional process, except that his vote breaks any tie when the judges are evenly divided. He is primus inter pares, whose powers basically consist of assigning the role of case rapporteur among the various judges, drawing up the Court calendar of cases to be heard at each sitting, and convening and directing the work of the Court. He also officially represents the Constitutional Court (enjoying the fifth highest- ranking State office after the President of the Republic, the Presidents of the Houses of Parliament and the President of the Council of Ministers), and supervises its administrative activity (which is managed on a day-to- day basis by a Secretary General).\n\nOne or two Vice-Presidents, appointed by the President of the Court, stand in for the President in the event of his absence for any reason. The President’s Office (Ufficio di Presidenza) has authority to regulate various organizational and administrative tasks, and committees of judges are set up to deal with specific administrative functions (such as the preparation of regulations, and management of the research service, the library, and personnel).\n\nThe Administrative Organization of the Court"
