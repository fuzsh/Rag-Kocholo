The General Division of the Clermont County Common Pleas Court has original jurisdiction to hear all adult felony criminal cases and all civil cases regardless of the dollar amount in controversy. The Court also has the authority to issue injunctions and certain legal writs. The Court has appellate jurisdiction over the decisions of some state and local administrative agencies, boards, and commissions. In addition, the Court presides over the Clermont County Grand Jury, which has the power to hand down indictments in criminal cases. The Court is responsible for the operation of the Probation Department, which supervises those criminal defendants placed on community control as part of their sentence."
