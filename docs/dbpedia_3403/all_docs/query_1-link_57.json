        "text": "Courtrooms are formal settings for resolving legal matters. If you have not attended a court hearing before it may be a bit intimidating. Here we provide some information to help you understand how to behave in court, what to expect in the courtroom and who might be in the courtroom.\n\nIf you have never been in a Court before, it can be difficult to know how you are expected to behave. To help you with this, here are a few DOs and DON'Ts to consider for your hearing.\n\nDo\n\nDon't\n\nDress appropriately for a formal environment Raise your voice in the courtroom Stand when the judge is entering and leaving the courtroom Use a mobile device Address the judge as 'judge' Eat food in the courtroom Stand when speaking to the court Take photos or videos during your hearing Turn your mobile phone off or put it on silent Interrupt others Take notes if necessary Chew gum\n\nThere is no expectation on you to know all of the courtroom formalities. Direction will also be provided during the case. For example, the judge or clerk will tell you where to sit when you enter the courtroom.\n\nIf you need a break you can ask the judge. Usually a judge will give instructions on when you can speak. For example if someone is interrupting, it would be normal for the judge to tell them that they will get a chance to speak after.\n\nFamily Law cases are heard in private ('in camera') to protect the privacy of the family. Only those involved in the case and such other people as the judge allows will be in the courtroom. Sometimes the judge may allow people to attend to report on a case. They may be solicitors, barristers, approved researchers or members of the press. The publication of reports of family law cases is allowed in certain circumstances once no names, addresses, or any other details which might identify the parties are used.\n\nThe legal language used in a courtroom can be difficult to understand. We have a glossary of terms that may help.\n\nIf you are representing yourself, you will be required to speak to the judge and answer questions yourself.\n\nAt the end of the case, the Judge will make their decision in the form of an \"order\" or a \"judgment\". When your hearing is finished, the judge or registrar will tell you when you can leave the courtroom..\n\nAfter the hearing, a written copy of the decision will be sent out to you in the post within 7 days of the hearing. If you are not happy with the decision, you may be able to appeal to a higher court. There are time limits for appeals so you may wish to get legal advice or speak to a Court Service staff member about this.\n\nPlease Note: Family law proceedings can be sensitive and emotional days. Please make any member of staff aware if you need alternative arrangements. Particularly for leaving the courtroom or if you need any support after the hearing."
