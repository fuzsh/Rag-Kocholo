The Court of Assistants is the Guild’s principal governing body; led by the Master and supported by the Upper, Middle, and Renter Wardens, Officers, and Court Assistants, it acts as the Guild’s executive committee and sets out the agenda of the Guild.

The day-to-day management of the Guild is delegated to the Clerk, who in larger Livery Companies holds the role of Chief Executive. The Court meets regularly throughout the year to undertake its duties in relation to the governing of the Guild and the administration of its social and charitable activities.
