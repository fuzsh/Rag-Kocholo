        "text": "Hi, I have the same issue. Have some talk with support (Garmin - Chris) and he confirmed - bug known and they are working on the solution.\n\nGot general reply “most of bugs repaired in next software update”.\n\nHope in next quartal upgrade will be solved\n\nHaving the same problem. On reddit someone said that navigating with touch to select your destination seemed to be part of the issue. Using the buttons (pan/zoom) instead to select where you want to route to is a work around. Hopefully this will be fixed in the update.\n\nwww.reddit.com/.../\n\nI noticed this 'there and back' bug again yesterday when I selected a point on the map during a 'run' activity and used 'go' to navigate to the point. That was using software version 14.something\n\nToday I applied the software update to go to Version 15.68 and then when I tried later today to use the 'go to coordinates on the map' the 'there and back' problem wasn't there anymore.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if it is consistent. I could have sworn that the first time I tried after the update that the problem was there but ever since it seems not to have been. Maybe fixed?"
