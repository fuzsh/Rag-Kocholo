        "text": "Staying connected to the American people is incredibly important to President Obama. That’s why he tries to get out of Washington as much as he can and it’s why he reads ten letters from Americans across the country every day. And it’s why we’re kicking off a new program today called Advise the Advisor.\n\nThink of it as your direct line to senior staff at the White House.\n\nHere’s how it works: one of the President’s closest advisors will post a short video to let you know more about what’s going on here at the White House and ask for your advice, opinions and feedback on important issues. We’ll go through as much of your feedback as possible and post a summary of what you’ve told us later in the week.\n\nThis week, David Plouffe, Senior Advisor to the President, is kicking off the series, focusing on President Obama’s vision for winning the future by out-innovating, out-educating, and out-building rest of the world, by reforming our government to make it smarter, more effective and better prepared for the 21st century, and by taking responsibility for our debts and deficits."
