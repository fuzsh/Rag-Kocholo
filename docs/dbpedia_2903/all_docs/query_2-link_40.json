        "text": "Solution: meeting room and desk booking software connected to access control\n\nAs a result of the tendering process, Direct Line Group appointed Matrix Booking alongside a cloud-based access control partner during this process. Steve Thorburn commented: “All providers we spoke to said that we can scan a QR code to check you into a desk, start a meeting, or confirm attendance via an app, and use lights on desks to show that they are in use. We found this to be a behaviourally driven approach, with no consequences for users who do not follow these steps. For example, what if the QR code did not work? What if I don’t book in? These approaches were also heavily reliant on employees’ behaviours or using their own devices or company devices to ‘check in.’ This started a discussion about linking our new desk booking system with our access control system by developing an API, and only providing access if you have a resource booked.”\n\nThis was a new initiative for both organisations. Such a move would ensure that only those who have made a booking will be able to gain access to the building. The system will also automatically check employees in, removing the need for a separate check in process whilst also meeting a basic security principle of access based on need. This initiative was brought to life by Matrix, who took the lead on developing the API and linking it to the access control system and DLGs core systems. Following successful testing, this integration was released in December 2022.\n\nSteve continued: “We met Matrix Booking at the IWFM Awards in 2019 and invited them to take part in the tendering process alongside six other suppliers. We have now been working with Matrix Booking since September 2021, and I must say that Paul Scott (CTO, Matrix Booking) and the team have been great working with us on the integration and testing, ready for us to go live with the access control system integration. This integration is unique, and I am not aware of anything on the market that currently has this capability and functionality. We chose Matrix Booking over its competitors for several factors. Whilst the cost was very competitive and demonstrated real value for money, the teams at Matrix Booking also made us feel secure in the knowledge that they will give us focus and excellent customer service. Their commitment to system development has been outstanding.”\n\nOutcome: real-time occupancy data to understand patterns and ways of working a desk booking system fit for purpose\n\nAs a result of this integration, Direct Line Group anticipates being able to better support their employees within the workspaces by using the Matrix Booking data to understand what and how resources are being used as well as the general pattern of activity within the portfolio of offices. Over time, Direct Line Group will use and report on the data to show how many bookings are being made and how many of these bookings are being fulfilled.\n\nUser experience is very important to Direct Line Group. Steve explained: “My advice to anyone looking to undertake a similar project is to be clear on your operational requirements, but do not let them become a restriction. You may have a view on how you want to achieve something, but there may be a better way, and let the experts in the field lead these discussions. Start by creating user stories for each user type and map their needs to ensure the product meets both your departments’ and the building users’ needs. Understanding the subtle differences in web and app functionality is also key, ensuring that the system is readily available to all.”"
