        "text": "Are you an existing customer?\n\nIf you requested online access to your documents when you bought your policy with us, just click below to view them.\n\nSign in to see your documents\n\nIf you have not requested online access to your documents, and need copies of the policy booklet or policy documents that are relevant to you, please call us on 0345 246 8372 .\n\nThe greater the risk of loss and damage to your home and belongings, the higher your insurance quote is likely to be.\n\nYour premium is based on several factors relating to you, your home and the value of your items.\n\nWhere you live\n\nIt could be that you live in a city with a higher crime rate, a woodland area affected by tree roots or a rural location exposed to severe weather conditions.\n\nSize of your house\n\nIf you live in a large house, the cost to have it rebuilt is likely to increase the buildings element of your quote.\n\nHow close you are to water\n\nDue to a higher risk of flooding, homes near rivers or coastlines are generally more expensive to insure.\n\nAge and property structure\n\nThe age of your property and materials used to build your house can have a huge impact on your quote. For example, wooded structures are particularly vulnerable to fire, termites and rot.\n\nYour lifestyle\n\nFactors like your age, whether you’re married with children, or if you’re away from home for long periods of time can all have an impact on your quote.\n\nMaterials on your roof\n\nCommon tile and slate roofs are easier to insure than those that are flat (vulnerable to burglars and weather damage).\n\nValue of your contents\n\nThe more expensive your items are, the more it will cost you to get them insured.\n\nPrevious claims\n\nEven if you’ve moved into a new house, your claims history is still taken into consideration. And not telling us could invalidate your policy.\n\nThere are many reasons why the cost of your home insurance premium may have changed on renewal, with some having a bigger impact than others.\n\nIf you choose to automatically renew, you can cancel at any time. You'll still get a renewal invite before the policy end date, but cover will stop if other arrangements aren't made. If you do choose the convenience of automatic renewal, your price will still be the same as one given to a new customer.\n\nYour premium is based on several factors relating to you, your home and the value of your items.\n\nPrevious claims\n\nYour claims history is taken into consideration when pricing your policy. If you’ve made a claim in the previous year this could result in an increased premium.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation increases the price of goods and services, impacting Direct Line’s claims and general expenses. Policy premiums will reflect such changes.\n\nCrime rate\n\nA spate of crimes resulting in more home insurance claims could see premiums increase to reflect the new risk level of your home’s location.\n\nSevere weather\n\nPeriods of extreme weather, such as prolonged cold or rain, can result in an increase in customer claims. This can lead insurers to review the likely cost of future claims.\n\nChanges to IPT\n\nYou don’t pay VAT on insurance, instead you’ll be charged Insurance Premium Tax (IPT). This is included in your premium, so any changes to the rate will affect what you pay.\n\nThere are some situations where you won’t be able to get an online quote because we need a few more details. If that happens, just give us a call on 0345 246 3564 .\n\nYou may need to ring us if:\n\nYour home is a listed building\n\nYou’ve more than five bathrooms or six bedrooms\n\nYou want to insure standard items over £100,000\n\nYou want to insure individual valuable items over £2,000 with Home Insurance or £4,000 with Home Insurance Plus\n\nYou’ve previously made a claim for over £5,000\n\nIf you choose to renew automatically, your renewal won't be any higher than if you choose to renew manually.\n\nIf you don't select automatic renewal, you'll still get a renewal invite before your policy end date. However, cover will stop on the policy end date if you haven't contacted us to renew it.\n\nIf you do choose the convenience of automatic renewal, then you will not need to contact us next year to renew your policy.\n\nYes, if you take out our Personal Possessions cover. This is available as an optional extra under the Direct Line Home Insurance policy and covers your personal belongings (including up to £500 for Money) against theft, loss or accidental damage anywhere in the British Isles and for up to 60 days abroad each year. Any individual items worth more than £2,000 must be specified on the Direct Line Home Insurance policy.\n\nPersonal Possessions cover is included as standard under the Direct Line Home Insurance Plus policy (when you select contents cover) and covers your personal belongings (including up to £1,000 for Money) against theft, loss or accidental damage anywhere in the world. Any individual items worth more than £4,000 must be specified on the policy.\n\nWe will provide cover for your contents whilst in storage, but only when using a professional storage facility, for up to 72hrs. Your contents would also be covered against accidental loss or damage whilst you are in the process of moving.\n\nYou need to let us know the value of individual items of jewellery, fine art, watches, antiques and sporting guns in excess of £2,000 with Home Insurance or £4,000 with Home Insurance Plus. These items will then be specified (listed) on your policy.\n\nIf you are changing address, please call us on 0345 246 3564 to discuss. If you're selling your home the buildings section of our policy automatically covers the buyer up to the date that the sale completes however if you require cover for a new property which you are in the process of buying or a property which you have already moved into then you will need to speak to our customer services team to discuss this on 0345 246 3564 .\n\nDirect Line Home Insurance will pay up to £5,000 for Trace and Access cover. This includes removing and replacing any part of the building in order to find the source of water escaping from tanks, pipes, appliances or fixed heating systems that are causing damage to the building.\n\nCover increases to £10,000 for Home Insurance Plus, and to £15,000 for Select Premier customers.\n\nWhat's not covered is repairing or replacing the tanks, pipes or heating systems themselves.\n\nYes. Direct Line Buildings Insurance customers get up to £25,000 for comparable accommodation including kennel fees for pets, and lost rent. This applies if all or part of your home is not fit to be lived in when a valid claim has been made, or your home is occupied by squatters.\n\nHome Insurance Plus Buildings customers receive up to £50,000 in alternative accommodation cover, while Select Premier cover is unlimited for up to three years.\n\nDirect Line Contents Insurance will pay up to £15,000 for the cost of alternative accommodation, kennel fees and the storage of your contents. Cover increases to £30,000 for Home Insurance Plus Contents customers.\n\nFrom January 2022, all insurers must make sure existing customers are offered the same price at renewal as they would get when buying a new policy. In the insurance industry, this rule change is known as Pricing Practices Regulation, or PPR.\n\nDo you live somewhere that's prone to flooding? It's time to get informed about the risks and how you can prepare. Our guide will help you be ready, react and recover should a flood hit your area - including how to limit the damage it causes to your home.\n\nBlocked or damaged drains can cause a lot of issues for your home - but you're only responsible for your own drains, not those outside property boundaries. To save yourself money, find out who's responsible for repairing them and how you can report a blocked drain."
