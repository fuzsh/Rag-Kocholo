Our site is for anyone who’s interested in platting those old land patents, grants, and deeds, and placing them on a modern map.\n\nYou say you don’t know anything about deeds or surveying? Our Reference Section can tell you all you ever wanted to know (and then some!) about Deeds, Grants, Patents, and Claims– how metes and bounds surveys work, the public domain land grant system, legal terms, and much more.\n\nFind out who’s researching land records where."
