        "text": "PRIVACY POLICY\n\nYour privacy is important to Yamaha Guitar Group, Inc. and its family of brands, which includes Yamaha, Line 6, Ampeg, Cordoba, Guild, HumiCase, and DeArmond (âYGGâ). We developed this Privacy Policy so you know how we collect, use, share, and store your personal information.\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all YGG-branded, owned, and operated websites, applications (âappsâ) and products on which this Privacy Policy is shown. If a YGG website, app, or product links to a different privacy policy, then that privacy policy will apply to your use of that site, app, or product.\n\nWays YGG Collects and Uses Personal Information\n\n\"Personal Information\" is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or household. When we combine other information (i.e., information that does not, on its own, identify an individual or household) with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information.\n\nWhen you create a YGG account\n\nWhen you create an account on a YGG website or mobile app, we ask you to provide Personal Information, including your name and email address. You will use your email address or username and your password to login to your account. Your YGG account will be password protected. We use your name to help verify your account when you contact customer support.\n\nWhen you log in to your YGG account with social media credentials\n\nYou may have the option to log in to your YGG account using your social media login credentials (e.g., your Facebook login credentials). If you choose to do this, when you log in to your YGG account using social media login credentials for the first time, you will be asked whether you agree that the social media provider may provide certain information to YGG, such as your name, email address, profile photo, posts, comments and other information associated with your social media account.\n\nAll this information is made available to YGG by the social media provider due to the way the social sign-on configuration works, but of this information, YGG only retains and uses your email address. YGG uses the email address provided by the social media provider to associate it with your YGG account so that you can use your email address to log in to your YGG account in the future if you no longer wish to login using your social media login credentials.\n\nIf you do not want your information to be shared with YGG by the social media provider, then you can simply login to the account(s) you maintain on any YGG-owned website using the relevant account login credentials without using your social media login credentials.\n\nWhen you buy products on a YGG website\n\nIf you purchase a product on a YGG site, then YGG will collect Personal Information from you, such as your name, mailing address and telephone number, so that we can process your order and fulfill your purchase. We do not view or store your payment card information. A third party processes customer payment card information when YGG customers use a payment card to make a purchase on a YGG site.\n\nWhen you update a YGG affiliated product\n\nIf you perform a software update, including but not limited to a firmware update, to a YGG affiliated product, then YGG will collect Personal Information from you, such as your IP address and unique product ID so that we can ensure proper functionality of the product and that the product is operating safely.\n\nWhen you communicate with YGG\n\nWhen you interact with our customer support representatives via email, website chat, telephone, text, or in person, we may collect Personal Information, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address and contact preferences; and information about the YGG products you own, such as their serial numbers and date of purchase.Â We may collect the text of your communications, such as your questions, comments, or compliments about our products or services.Â We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing product or app performance related issues, and capture information relating to the support or service issue. We use this information to provide you with customer and product support. We may access your YGG account in order to assist us in providing you the necessary assistance. To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record, monitor, and/or review conversations with customer support representatives, and analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys.Â We may use your comments or compliments, without identifying you by your full name, as testimonials in our advertising or marketing.\n\nWe may use Personal Information to communicate with you, including communicating with you about your account or transactions with us, giving you important information about your products or apps, sending you notice about material changes to this Privacy Policy, and, consistent with applicable laws and the choices available to you as described below under Your Choices regarding Marketing Correspondence, sending you offers and promotions for our products and apps.\n\nWhen you are connected to YGG services\n\nWhen you are connected to our services via custom applications (apps), we collect information such as your IP address and unique device ID. We associate your unique device ID with information that you may have used to register for certain services or purchase products. Server logs that are maintained by us or by our third-party service providers contain information about the services that you have used, and your device-specific information. We use your IP address or unique device ID address to track device-event information such as crashes, system activity and hardware settings, and also to control access to certain services or applications.\n\nOther Uses of Personal Information by YGG\n\nYGG may use Personal Information for internal statistical, marketing or operational purposes, including generating sales reports and measuring and understanding demographic, user interest, purchasing and other trends among our customers.\n\nEntities with which YGG may share personal information\n\nWith social network providers\n\nFrom time to time, we may provide email addresses of selected YGG customers who have opted in to receiving marketing correspondence about YGG products and apps to social network providers, so they can help us display advertisements on the social network pages of other users who share common qualities (e.g., demographics and interests) with the selected YGG customers.\n\nIf you sign up to be notified by email when a YGG product or app will be available for purchase, in addition to using your email address to notify you when that product or app becomes available for purchase, we may also provide your email address to social network providers, so they can help us to display advertisements about that product or app on your social network pages.\n\nWith service providers\n\nWe use third party service providers to help us to administer certain activities on our behalf, such as fulfilling purchases and shipping products, processing credit card payments, sending emails, providing advertisements, analyzing usage of our websites and apps, tracking effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, and allowing users to connect to their social network. We may share Personal Information about you with such third party service providers to the extent necessary for the sole purpose of enabling them to perform services on our behalf.\n\nAd event logs\n\nIf you choose to use YGG apps that contain advertisements, we may collect information such as which advertisements were viewed, how often they were clicked and how often certain actions such as saving a coupon or calling or routing to a location corresponding to an advertisement were performed so that the advertising providers can provide you with content and advertising that might be of interest to you.\n\nOther disclosures\n\nWe may disclose Personal Information about you to others if we have your consent to do so in such form of consent as may be required under applicable law.\n\nSubject to applicable laws in your jurisdiction, we may also disclose Personal Information about you to others as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law or regulation, including laws or regulations outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to lawful requests from public authorities and law enforcement officials (including officials outside your country of residence) for purposes such as satisfying national security or law enforcement requirements; (d) to assist or support theft investigations involving YGG products or property, (e) to enforce any of our terms and conditions or policies; (f) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates and subsidiaries; (g) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of YGG, its affiliates and subsidiaries, you or others; or (h) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.\n\nWe may also transfer Personal Information to an affiliate, a subsidiary or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of YGG's business, assets or stock, including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding.\n\nIn addition, we may transfer Personal Information across borders, outside of your country or jurisdiction around the world. In such cases, we will ensure that the country provides adequate protections or that the recipients are subject to appropriate safeguards including EU approved standard contract clauses.\n\nYGG will contractually require all third parties with whom it shares personal information to safeguard such information consistent with the terms of this Policy.\n\nWays you may share personal information or consent to YGG sharing your personal information:\n\nMessage boards, forums\n\nSome YGG websites and apps have message boards, forums, chat functionality, blogs, and similar features through which you can post information, messages and materials. Please note that any information you disclose through such services or otherwise on our sites may become public information and may be available to visitors to the sites and to the general public. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose Personal Information, or any other information, on our websites or apps.\n\nPromotions\n\nIf you enter a sweepstakes, contest or similar promotion, we may use the information you provide to administer those promotions. To the extent that the terms and conditions of any such promotion regarding the treatment of Personal Information about you conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms and conditions of the promotion will control.\n\nCookies and similar technology\n\nTo help analyze how you and other visitors navigate YGG websites and compile aggregate statistics about site usage and response rates, we, with assistance from third-party analytics service providers, collect certain information when you visit our site. Â We use Google Analytics to collect and process data in the manner described in the Google site titled \"HOW GOOGLE USES DATA WHEN YOU USE OUR PARTNERSâ SITES OR APPS.\" A LINK TO THIS SITE IS: www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ The information we collect includes IP address, identifiers for mobile devices (e.g., Android Advertising Identifier or Advertising Identifier for iOS, or similar identifiers), geographic location of the device, browser type, browser language, date and time of your request, time(s) of your visit(s), demographics, page views and page elements (e.g., links) that you click. We may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFâs or other similar tools on our site or in our email messages to assist us in collecting and analyzing such information. We use this information to provide better, more relevant content on our site, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements, to identify and fix problems, and to improve your overall experience on our site. The information collected through these means may be disclosed to these analytics providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of our website, app, or product and report usage information back to us. To learn more about how to opt out of Google Analytics services, please visit this link: Google Analytics: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout\n\nIf you do not want information collected using these technologies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline many of these technologies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting them. In addition, if you reside in a jurisdiction that requires us to obtain your consent to use cookies on our sites then you will have an opportunity to manage your cookie preferences on the sites, except that certain cookies are required to enable core site functionality and you cannot choose to disable those cookies.\n\nLinks, third party apps, and third partiesâ privacy practices\n\nOur websites, apps and products may contain links to other sites that are not operated by YGG, and our websites or your product may contain apps that you can download from third parties. These linked sites and apps are not under our control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any linked sites and apps. If you use any third-party sites or apps, any Personal Information collected by the third partyâs site or app will be controlled by the privacy policy of that third party. We recommend that you carefully review the privacy policy of any third parties to which you provide Personal Information.\n\nSecurity\n\nYGG takes reasonable security measures to help protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access and unauthorized disclosure or alteration of the Personal Information under its control.\n\nPolicy with respect to children\n\nOur websites and apps are not directed to individuals under the age of 13, and we request that individuals under 13 not provide Personal Information to YGG through any YGG website or through our apps. If we learn that we have collected the Personal Information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.\n\nRetention of personal information\n\nWe will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which your Personal Information has been collected as outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required by law.\n\nÂ\n\nData Subject Rights for EU Residents\n\nEU residents have certain rights regarding their Personal Information under the GDPR.

For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We may decline to process requests that jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or would cause us to take any action that is not permissible under applicable laws.

You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.\n\nYou may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.

If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
