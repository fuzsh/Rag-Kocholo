        "text": "CBRE Group, Inc. has announced the acquisition of Direct Line Global, a California-based data center infrastructure provider, from Guardian Capital, a private equity firm. Direct Line Global will operate as part of CBRE’s Data Centers Solutions business within the Global Workplace Solutions business segment.\n\nFounded in 1997, Direct Line Global provides design, installation, maintenance and management solutions for data center owners and operators, primarily in the U.S.\n\n“This acquisition fits squarely with our strategy of enhancing our capabilities in asset classes that benefit from secular tailwinds – in this case, the increasing digitization of the global economy,” said Vikram Kohli (CEO, CBRE).\n\nDirect Line Global provides technical services, such as server support infrastructure, while CBRE currently focuses on facilities management services. Combining the two gives CBRE the ability to deliver integrated data center solutions that no other service provider can match.\n\nBill Nelligan (CEO, Direct Line Global) said, “Our business has strong momentum, driven by the economy’s voracious appetite for data and artificial intelligence’s explosive growth. We are particularly energized about the opportunities that CBRE’s preeminent global platform will afford us for overseas growth.”"
