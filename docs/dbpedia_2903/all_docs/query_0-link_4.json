It provides insights on their demographics, lifestyle, opinions, and marketing touchpoints. Additionally, the report allows the reader to benchmark Direct Line customers in the United Kingdom (''brand users'') against UK car insurance holders in general (''category users''), and the overall UK consumer, labelled as ''all respondents'' in the charts. The report is updated quarterly and is based on data from the Statista Consumer Insights Global survey, an international survey that covers more than 15,000 brands across 56 countries."
