        "text": "Update the settings on a direct extension as needed.\n\nImportant: We're in the process of migrating all accounts to the new GoTo Admin. Choose your current admin experience for the applicable steps on this topic. Choose your current admin experience for the applicable steps on this topic.\n\nGoTo Admin\n\nIf you're an admin who signs in at https://admin.goto.com, these steps are for you.\n\nChange direct extension settings\n\nBefore you begin: You must be assigned an Admin or Super admin role to perform this task.\n\nSign in to GoTo Admin.\n\nSelect from the left navigation menu.\n\nFrom Direct extensions, select the direct extension that needs changes made.\n\nTip: Select to export all the extensions into a single file list.\n\nFrom the Overview tab, change the following:\n\nDetails: Select Edit to make changes to the name or extension number.\n\nNote: Some extension numbers are reserved. To learn which extension numbers are reserved for other functions, refer to Which extensions are reserved?\n\nAssigned to: View which users and devices have this direct extension assigned to them. To learn how to assign users to an extension, refer to How do I assign a user to a direct extension?\n\nAssociated resources: Locate this direct extension in the admin portal. Navigate to that resource directly to make changes.\n\nFrom the Settings tab, change the following:\n\nGeneral: Choose the general settings such as extension number, name, shared line, omit from directories, language, region, and inbound and outbound call options.\n\nNote: If you are looking to add or change the caller ID for the phone number and not just this direct extension, refer to How do change my caller ID?\n\nRecording: Choose call recording preferences if recording is enabled on your system.\n\nVoicemail: Choose the voicemail password and other settings such as message retrieval, greeting, voicemail email notifications to one or more email addresses, and transcription preferences.\n\nNote: Language is NOT automatically detected when language transcription is enabled. Voicemail transcriptions are currently available in English and Spanish only. Transcription will be shown in the language set for the line or if the set language is unsupported, the transcription will be attempted in English. Users also have the option to set up voicemail transcription for their own line.\n\nVirtual Fax: Choose if this extension should receive virtual faxes to an email or use a fax adapter.\n\nFrom the Find me/follow me tab, you can view and/or change the settings for ring patterns, call screening options, and what you want to happen if the user does not answer the call.\n\nResults:\n\nTip: While on any tab in a direct extension profile, you can use the breadcrumb on the top-left to go back to the main list or use the arrows to navigate each extension's detail page.\n\nPBX Administration (classic)\n\nIf you're an admin who signs in at https://my.jive.com/pbx, these steps are for you.\n\nLine settings\n\nBelow is a list of all the line settings and their descriptions.\n\nGeneral\n\nExtension Setting Description Extension Number A unique three to six-digit number that makes the line dialable. Name The name used to identify the line in the admin portal. This does not change the caller ID and can be overridden by the button label. Shared Line — Optional Shares a single line with up to eight phones allowing users to mutually manage and monitor incoming calls and calls placed on hold. A shared line is a 2-way line, and not intended to act as a conference line.\n\nNote: Supported on Cisco MPP, Polycom, and Yealink only.\n\nNote: Not all phones support this feature.\n\nOmit from Directory — Optional Removes the line from all internal directories. Omit from Auto Attendant Extension Dialing — Optional Removes the line from auto attendant extension dialing. Language Defines the language for system IVR messages (e.g., voicemail menu prompts) and voicemail transcription. Region Matches the ringback to the region and allows a line to call a local number without having to dial the country code.\n\nInbound Call Options Setting Description Intercom Auto Pickup — Optional Enables the line to receive intercom calls from other lines on the system. Hold Music Controls which playlist callers hear while on hold. Ringback Controls whether callers hear ringing or hold music while waiting for the line to be answered.\n\nOutbound Call Options Setting Description Local Area Code Allows a line to call a local number without having to dial the area code. External Caller ID Controls which caller ID information is used when making outbound calls from this line.\n\nDial Plan\n\nIncoming calls to the line are routed through the dial plan (Find Me/Follow Me) when the line is directly dialed, a call is transferred to the line, or the line is used in a Line & Voicemail node. However, these settings are overridden on a per-call basis when your line is used in a Simple Dial node or another line’s ring step.\n\nDial Plan Setting Description Ring Step Defines which extension(s) and number(s) to ring when someone calls the line. You can set up the line to ring more than one phone simultaneously by adding multiple numbers to a ring step or in sequence by creating multiple ring steps.\n\nNote: If you have Block Caller ID enabled on the phone number routed to the line, the External Caller ID will continue to be blocked as the call is routed to other ring step destinations.\n\nConfirm Pickup — Optional Gives the option to dial 1 to accept an incoming call or 2 to send it to the next step in the dial plan.\n\nTip: Confirm pickup is helpful when a ring step includes an external number as it can interrupt your dial plan. For example, when a cell phone is turned off, calls go straight to the cell phone's voicemail box. Without confirm pickup, the voicemail would answer the call and prematurely end the ring step. Enabling confirm pickup allows the call to re-route back to the next ring step.\n\nPass Through Caller ID — Optional Controls which caller ID is displayed for ring steps that include external numbers.\n\nWhen enabled, the caller ID of the original caller is displayed.\n\nWhen disabled, the line's External Caller ID is displayed.\n\nRing Time Defines the number of seconds the call rings before going to the next ring step. This is overridden by any Simple Dial nodes that reference the line in a dial plan. If no answer, send to Defines what happens if the call is never answered.\n\nVoicemail: Sends the caller to the line's voicemail.\n\nInternal: Sends the caller to a specified internal extension.\n\nExternal: Sends the caller to a specified external number.\n\nTransferer: If the call was transferred to the line, returns the call to the party that initiated the transfer. If the call was not transferred to the line, it hangs up on the caller.\n\nHang up: Hangs up on the caller.\n\nUnspecified: Follows the No answer, send to ring step.\n\nIf call fails, send to Defines what happens if the call fails, like in the case of an internet or power outage.\n\nUnspecified: Follows the No answer, send to ring step.\n\nInternal: Sends the caller to a specified internal extension.\n\nNote: To avoid routing calls to another device that is also affected by the same outage, we recommend using failover to an internal extension only if you have multiple locations on the same system (e.g., an office in Chicago and Dallas).\n\nExternal Number: Sends the caller to a specified external number.\n\nVoicemail\n\nGeneral Options Setting Description Time Zone Sets the time zone for the line. Message Review — Optional Gives callers the option to press # to listen to their message and optionally re-record it.\n\nNote: There is no prompt for callers to press # after recording their voicemail.

To deliver notifications to a group, use an email alias (e.g., sales@guthrie.com) or create an auto-forward rule in your email client.\n\nTip: Use a specially formatted email address provided by your cell phone carrier to send notifications via text message (SMS). Check with your carrier for more details.\n\nPrivacy Options Description Permanently deletes all voicemails for the line.\n\nMessage Retrieval Options Setting Description Say Message Timestamp — Optional Say Caller ID — Optional System says the caller’s phone number before playing the message. Say Message Duration — Optional System says the duration of the message if it is longer than the specified threshold.\n\nOutgoing Message Options Voicemail Greeting Description Busy Message — Optional Alternate greeting for use in a dial plan only. Unavailable Message — Optional Default and most common greeting used for a voicemail box. Temporary Message — Optional When recorded, this message overrides any other voicemail greetings. To remove a temporary message, it must be deleted. Supported file types for upload:\n\n.wav\n\n.ulaw\n\n.g722\n\n.mp3\n\nNote: Uploaded files should not exceed 150 MB.\n\nAlternate Mailbox Options Setting Description Enable Alternate Mailbox — Optional Uses a shared mailbox for all voicemail messages and disables the line’s dedicated mailbox.\n\nVoicemail Access\n\nNote: These settings are different if the system permissions are set to use ACLs for voicemail (very uncommon).\n\nVoicemail Box Access Setting Description Allow Voicemail Access Without a Password — Optional Allows users to access this line’s voicemail box without a password.\n\nTip: Select Change Password to reset a user's voicemail password.\n\nRecording\n\nBefore you can enable call recording, your remote storage must be setup.\n\nCall Recording Setting Description Record Incoming Calls — Optional Enables recording of all incoming calls to this line.

To receive faxes, you must route a phone number to the line. Not available in Brazil and Mexico.\n\nNote: You can only send faxes to a single email address. If you need to deliver your faxes to a group, use an email alias (e.g., sales@guthrie.com) or create an auto-forward rule in your email client.\n\nUsing an Analog Telephone Adapter Setting Description Store faxes to increase transmission success rate — Optional Increases the delivery success rates of faxes you send and receive using a physical fax machine with an ATA. This feature temporarily stores faxes in transit, allowing our platform to handle reattempts and act on any errors.\n\nUsage\n\nDescription Lists all devices and call flows using the line.\n\nSet up a user's dial plan on a line\n\nSet up a unique dial plan (Find Me/Follow Me) to route calls however you want.\n\nBefore you begin:\n\nYou must be assigned an Admin or Super admin role to perform this task.\n\nIf you do not have admin permissions, you can set up your personal dial plan from the app for your line.\n\nIncoming calls are routed through the Find Me/Follow settings when the line is directly dialed, a call is transferred to the line, or the line is used in a Line & Voicemail node.
