This is a waste of my time and yours.\n\nDate of experience : August 11, 2024\n\nReply from Direct Line\n\nHi John. Thanks for the review. It's never our intention to provide you with a price you're not happy with, and our prices are sent at renewal correctly based on the many rating factors we consider. As a loyal customer, we're always happy to review the quote if we aren't as competitive this time around, as we wouldn't like to see you go.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback around this process, as we're always looking for ways to improve. Rach\n\nGreat advisors\n\nDirect Line advisors were consistently helpful and caring throughout my claims process following a brwak in and burglary at home. I got upset during the initial call but the advisor was so kind and it was a relief to know that someone was going to take over and deal with the broken patio\n\ndoors. The third party contractors dealt with the things that were damaged (floor and door) to a high standard.\n\nEvery time I was unclear what to do during the claim, someone was on hand to advise.\n\nThe claim form was online which was difficult to start with as I'd have found it easier to be able to see the whole form before I started so I knew what needed to go where. It was actually fine though.\n\nI would recommend Direct Line.\n\nDate of experience : April 30, 2024\n\nReply from Direct Line\n\nHi Gary. We're sorry to hear we've disappointed you with the price this year, as it's never our intention to leave you feeling this way. We're still more than happy to take a look at the premiums for you, just send us a message using the link below. Rach\n\nm.me/directlineuk\n\nBe warned!\n\nTook out pet insurance with Directline, last year. Before taking out the insurance our dog had been diagnosed with fatty lumps and a skin tag, both benign. No need for removal according to the vet - fine, happy with that. In June, the dog was having problems with his gait, caused by the lump and the skin tag was now looking \"ugly\". Both were removed due to their changing condition. Because the lump and skin tag were reported in my dog's records pre insurance (and whilst they were not a problem) Directline did not pay for their removal.\n\nIn a nutshell, if your dog has benign lumps or skin tags, you need to consider having them unnecessarily removed if insured by Directline! Even though it's putting your pet through any unnecessary suffering that an operation may cause!\n\nDate of experience : July 19, 2024\n\nWorth asking for reduction in renewal quotes\n\nHaving been a customer for several years the renewal quote for this year’s annual policy had increased by 50%. I contacted Direct Line having received lower quotes via a comparison website. They were suddenly ‘able’ to reduce my premium by £90 so my question is, why wasn’t that reduced price quoted in the first instance.\n\nDate of experience : August 09, 2024\n\nReply from Direct Line\n\nHi J. We're glad to hear we were able to offer you a better price, as we wouldn't like to see you go after many years on board with us. The prices we send at renewal are correct and based on many different rating factors however, we're always happy to check if there's any movement in your quote should you find it's not as competitive this time around.\n\nThanks for your feedback, as we're always looking for ways to improve. Rach\n\nWith insurance being so expensive at…\n\nWith insurance being so expensive at least these guys just do what needs to be done. I am not happy with how expensive my policy has become seems I have never ever claimed and have no points on my licence.\n\nDate of experience : August 05, 2024\n\nReply from Direct Line\n\nHi James. Thanks for the review. We appreciate your feedback, as we're always looking for ways to improve. Our prices are reviewed yearly to reflect changes in claims costs and current market conditions, but it's never our intention to send you a price you're not happy with. We're always happy to check your renewal price, so please don't hesitate to get in touch. Nathan\n\nReply from Direct Line\n\nHi Keith. We appreciate your feedback and are pleased to hear that you've found our subsidence claim process to be efficient. I understand that price increases can be frustrating, and we strive to provide competitive rates while maintaining a high level of service. Thank you for the review. Nathan\n\nCheck your car renewal quote!!!\n\nBoth my wife and I were insured with Direct Line until renewal time for both cars this year. There have been no claims, no change in circumstances, less mileage covered than insured for but still the premium has gone up by a disproportionate amount.\n\nUpon contacting Direct Line I was given a script about industry costs, economic climate etc. Which I can understand and appreciate but not at a 50% uplift. Having used a comparison website I was able to beat last years quote from Direct Line and increase my level of cover for both vehicles.\n\nShop around and make sure you aren't auto-renewing.\n\nDate of experience : August 09, 2024\n\nReply from Direct Line\n\nHi there. We're sorry to hear you and your wife have left us this time around, and we appreciate your feedback around our pricing. It's never our intention to provide you with a quote you're not happy with. There are many factors we consider when quoting a policy such as current market conditions, worldwide events and claims costs.\n\nOur prices are reviewed yearly, so please keep us in mind for the future as it'd be great to see you back on board. Rach\n\nBy doing it all myself\n\nBy doing it all myself , I saved about £600 from the quote which was sent to me. A big difference. Just shows by using the website I was able to save, with practically what I require to be in the road.\n\nDate of experience : August 08, 2024\n\n5 Star service with professionals\n\nHad the pleasure to deal with Walden in the claims team. His professional manor and keeping me informed was the best service I have received by far. Really appreciate the fast response and keeping me in the loop. Thank you again for understanding the stress claim process can take and taking the stress away knowing I was in good hands. 5 star service by far.\n\nDate of experience : August 02, 2024\n\nReply from Direct Line\n\nWe are so glad to hear that you had a positive experience with our claims team. We strive to provide excellent customer service and are delighted that you found Walden's professionalism and communication to be helpful. We appreciate your kind words and will share your feedback with the team.\n\nExcellent service\n\nExcellent service. I contacted Direct Line on behalf of my dad, who due to illness couldn't do so himself . When I had a home emergency, every Direct Line employee I spoke with was very knowledgeable, sympathetic, and managed my expectations the entire time, giving me a lot of peace of mind. I also have my own house insured via Direct Line, and given my recent experience, I am certain that I am working with an excellent team.\n\nDate of experience : May 13, 2024\n\nReply from Direct Line\n\nWe're so glad to hear about your positive experience with our team. It's wonderful to know that we were able to provide the support and guidance you needed during a difficult time. We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback.\n\nReply from Direct Line\n\nThank you for your kind words about our staff and the quality of our insurance. We appreciate your feedback about the premium increase. We understand that rising costs can be a concern, and we are committed to providing our customers with the best possible value. Thank you for the positive review. Nathan"
