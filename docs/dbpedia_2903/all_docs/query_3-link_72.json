        "text": "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is managed by the FEMA and is delivered to the public by a network of more than 50 insurance companies and the NFIP Direct.\n\nFloods can happen anywhere — just one inch of floodwater can cause up to $25,000 in damage. Most homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage. Flood insurance is a separate policy that can cover buildings, the contents in a building, or both, so it is important to protect your most important financial assets — your home, your business, your possessions.\n\nThe NFIP provides flood insurance to property owners, renters and businesses, and having this coverage helps them recover faster when floodwaters recede. The NFIP works with communities required to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations that help mitigate flooding effects.\n\nFlood insurance is available to anyone living in one of the almost 23,000 participating NFIP communities. Homes and businesses in high-risk flood areas with mortgages from government-backed lenders are required to have flood insurance.\n\nBecome a Customer\n\nHow to Purchase Flood Insurance\n\nTo purchase flood insurance, call your insurance company or insurance agent, the same person who sells your home or auto insurance. If you need help finding a provider go to FloodSmart.gov/flood-insurance-provider or call the NFIP at 877-336-2627.\n\nPlan ahead as there is typically a 30-day waiting period for an NFIP policy to go into effect, unless the coverage is mandated it is purchased as required by a federally backed lender or is related to a community flood map change.\n\nFloodSmart.gov\n\nBecome a Seller and Servicer\n\nWork With the NFIP\n\nFEMA administers the NFIP and it is a partnership between the federal government, the property and casualty insurance industry, states, local officials, lending institution, and property owners.\n\nEach year, more than 50 private insurance companies participate in the Write-Your-Own (WYO) program selling and servicing NFIP policies through their insurance agents.\n\nFEMA retains responsibility for underwriting flood insurance coverage sold under that program and by the NFIP Direct. There are more than five million policyholders nationwide and the NFIP is the nation’s largest single-line insurance program providing nearly $1.3 trillion in coverage against flood.\n\nNFIP Direct\n\nFlood Insurance Resources\n\nNFIP offers a wide range of publications, videos, graphics and online tools that help policyholders, agents and other servicers navigate the flood insurance process before, during and after disaster.\n\nDigital resources can be downloaded, and certain print publications can be ordered for free using the Publications Order Form.\n\nFind an Insurance Form\n\nInsurance Outreach Publications\n\nFlood Insurance Fact Sheets\n\nStarting Your Recovery After a Flood\n\nWind Damage vs Water Damage: What You Need To Know When Filing A Claim\n\nWhat Does Flood Insurance Cover In A Basement?\n\nWork with the NFIP\n\nWe provide reports on the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP) financials and offer guidance on conducting daily operations for existing and new NFIP sellers and servicers. Find information on the Write-Your-Own program, reinsurance, NFIP’s pricing approach, plus the Flood Insurance Manual and other tools.\n\nView All Programs and Tools"
