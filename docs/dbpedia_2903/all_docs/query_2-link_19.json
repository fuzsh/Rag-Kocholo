        "text": "Direct Line Group (DLG) has achieved a significant milestone in its tech transformation journey having launched its new technology platform for Direct Line, Churchill and Privilege motor customers. The platform is one element of the Group’s strategy of building an insurance company for the future, driven by data and technology, which is fully digitally enabled and can operate in an agile and low-cost way.\n\nThe new platform offers customers across each of its well-known brands hassle-free transactions, the opportunity to self-serve and the ability to engage with support teams in a web chat or on the phone.\n\nWorking together with Capgemini – DLG’s System Integrator partner – the new , cloud-based platform is designed to provide the flexibility to support multiple channels spanning Price Comparison Websites, Digital, and Direct channels and to integrate the capabilities of leading business systems including Guidewire, Mulesoft, Salesforce, Amazon Web Service (AWS) and Willis Towers Watson’s Radar Live to create a unique ecosystem to deliver future business initiatives.\n\nSteve Maddock, Chief Operating Officer said, “I’m delighted that our new platform is in the advanced stages of deployment and we are already seeing the benefits it brings to both our customers and the business. The last twelve months has been challenging and we are exceptionally proud that we’ve forged ahead with our tech transformation, despite the sudden move to home working. The new platform will enable us to offer our customers a full rounded digital experience from quote through to claims. The continued roll out across all brands will power the Group to drive benefits and growth out of the investments we have already made and become the tech and data driven insurance company of the future. I’m really proud of the team that made this business transformation happen.”\n\n“Undertaking a large-scale core transformation requires vision, skill and tenacity to create a modern insurance company of the future,” said Shane Cassidy, Head of Insurance for Capgemini’s Financial Services. “This success was made possible through DLG’s determination to be customer-focused to address the unique customer requirements for each of its brands.
