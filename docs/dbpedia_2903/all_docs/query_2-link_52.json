        "text": "Following a series of mergers, Direct Line Group (DLG) was left with multiple HR systems across the group. Employee data was hard to access and often inaccurate. In 2012, DLG separated from Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), ending a relationship that lasted more than 20 years.\n\nDLG, which needed to decouple its operations from Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), could now overhaul its legacy HR systems and standardise HR operations – kickstarting the search for a robust solution with advanced capabilities.\n\nWhy Workday.\n\nDLG was immediately attracted by Workday’s ease of use and reporting features. It was essential for DLG to deliver error-free HR data because inaccurate HR reports would have put a planned initial public offering (IPO) at risk.\n\nEmpowerment and control were another two key reasons for choosing Workday, because it would help managers make better decisions. What’s more, it would provide HR with greater insight into the daily operations of the organisation’s 11,000-strong workforce to improve processes.\n\nTransparency improves employee experience.\n\nDLG has greater visibility on spending and can interrogate expenses that previously were stored on spreadsheets. As a result, it can identify possible efficiencies and reduce expenses. And the auditing functionality in Workday means DLG can recognise double entries more easily and eliminate costly errors.\n\nPurchasing cards have moved to Workday Expenses, giving DLG even more expense auditability and control. “We understand where the money is flowing through the business. It gives us an opportunity to find ways to save and drive further efficiencies”, says Sarah Clarke, Head of HR Information Systems.\n\nMore effective recruiting practices.\n\nDLG has streamlined hiring processes using data stored in Workday Recruiting. It has data to hand on candidate sources, time-to-recruit, roles filled and recruiter workloads.\n\nSarah says, “The efficiencies we’ve made in the recruiting process are considerable. Workday Recruiting has played a key role in some of the new innovative initiatives we’ve launched in the recruiting process such as virtual-reality office tours and video interviewing. We now have an opportunity to engage with candidates earlier and provide a smoother journey from candidate to pre-hire to employee. This improves how candidates view our brand.”\n\nHelping retain the best talent.\n\nDLG’s people strategy is about hiring the right talent for the right role, while simplifying processes to raise employee satisfaction. Jason says, “If we can make life easier for our people, they have more time and motivation to serve our customers.” DLG can identify great people managers by joining up job performance, employee satisfaction and staff turnover data from Workday. Great managers then become examples for others to help ensure happy and successful employees.\n\nDLG has employed a Data Insights Consultant to analyse data from Workday. It has also launched graduate and apprentice programmes supported by the Workday solution. Sarah says, “HR is now better aligned with our people strategy. Our expertise is enabling DLG to focus on hiring and retaining the best talent.”"
