        "text": "London's train system is unmatched, with the Tube taking you from Epping to West Ruislip, National Rail transporting you from Kings Cross to Inverness, and Eurostar whisking you off as far as Marseille.\n\nHowever, these all seem small compared to the ultimate direct train route - Barking to Yiwu, in Zhejiang Province, East China.\n\nThe seemingly ordinary East London Tube station is also a freight train hub that runs from the capital all the way to Yiwu - a staggering 7,500-mile journey, reports My London.\n\nAlthough it's goods rather than commuters being transported, it certainly puts into perspective any complaints about long train journeys.\n\nIf you did the route nonstop it would take you 18 days.\n\nBarking station has been undergoing significant renovations for a few years now. Ben Martin, director of assets and property at train operator c2c, said last year: \"As the gateway to the area, we know the current station has been pretty poor.\n\n\"Now, we have the funding and we've been working with the community to bring it into the 21st century. We've tried to restore and maintain the heritage as much as possible.\""
