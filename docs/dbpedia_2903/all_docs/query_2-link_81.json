We champion diverse voices, build workplaces that work for people, and invest in the things that matter – so you can feel comfortable enough to bring your whole self to work. Our senior leadership and our employee networks are available to help you thrive, and flexible working and inclusion training make working at DLG better for everyone.\n\nDirect Line Group is where you can be yourself.\n\nThat’s one of our values – because we recognise that strength comes from difference. We want the real you, with all your diverse perspectives, ideas, and opinions, to help us create an inclusive environment where everyone’s welcome. Attracting and retaining talented, authentic, and collaborative people is what powers our business forward.\n\nWe’re proud to have placed at number 17 on The Inclusive Top 50 UK Employers List for 2023-24 – an independent ranking produced by Inclusive Companies to recognise organisations that lead the way on inclusion.\n\nWe’ve also been recognised as a Top 75 employer in the Social Mobility Index for 2023. This signifies the great progress we’ve made in advancing social mobility and addressing inequity – within Direct Line Group as well as in wider society.\n\nWe’re building an inclusive place to work\n\nDiversity and inclusion are in everything we do, from our processes and practices, through to our culture and behaviours.\n\nOur policies and guidance cover flexible working, workplace adjustments, anti-bullying and harassment, flexible working, menopause, pregnancy loss and transitioning gender, among other aspects. And at the root – inclusion training helps build a deeper understanding of what it means to be inclusive, and it gives everyone in our workplace the skills to support it.\n\nWe ask what makes you, you\n\nTo help us understand what barriers may exist, we monitor data on sex, gender identity, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability, neurodivergence, mental health, health conditions, caring responsibilities, and socio-economic factors in our workplace.\n\nOur workplace serves to reflect society, and we’re proud that 56% of our ExCo are women and 22% are from an ethnic minority background. But we’re not stopping there – we ask for our colleagues’ feedback three times a year via our DiaLoGue survey. It’s how we know that in 2023, 86% of our people said Direct Line Group is a highly inclusive place to work and 90% of people would recommend their people manager to others."
