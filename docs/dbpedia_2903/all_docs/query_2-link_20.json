        "text": "Direct Line Group has made the decision to shut down Caha , its car ownership app.\n\nIn a note on its website, it explained that it recently made the decision to put the brakes on the Caha! app and focus the team’s attention on a new exciting opportunity “coming soon.”\n\nAs of June 23, 2024, the Caha! app will no longer be available to use. “This wasn’t an easy decision to make and we’re sorry to those that rely on Caha! for their day-to-day car management. Our vision of simplifying car ownership remains, and the learnings from this app will live on in other exciting apps.”\n\nThe app was introduced in Sep 2023 to bring together different aspects of car ownership such as fuel prices, reminders, parking finder, EV charging, car valuation and more.\n\nThe venture was led by Phoebe Chibuzo Hugh, the founder of insurance startup Brolly, which was acquired by Direct Line in 2020 and is also now defunct.\n\nThe news comes after two rejected attempts by Ageas to acquire Direct Line.\n\nIn the background, Caha operated in the same space as Caura, another car ownership app. Recently, Caura moved its insurance service to Moneysupermarket but has also seen its employee count drop by 8% in the past 6 months, according to LinkedIn."
