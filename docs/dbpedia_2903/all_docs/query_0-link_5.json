Differenced versions of the arms are used by members of the British royal family. The monarch's official flag, the Royal Standard, is the coat of arms in flag form.\n\nThere are two versions of the coat of arms. One is used in Scotland, and includes elements derived from the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Scotland, and the other is used elsewhere and includes elements derived from the coat of arms of the Kingdom of England. The shields of both versions of the arms quarter the arms of the kingdoms of England and Scotland, which united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and the Kingdom of Ireland, which united with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom in 1801. The Irish quarter was unaltered following the division of Ireland into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State in 1922.\n\nThe present arms do not include a representation of the United Kingdom's fourth constituent country, Wales, as it was incorporated into the Kingdom of England in the 16th century.[3] Wales is instead represented heraldically by two royal badges, which use the Welsh dragon and the coat of arms of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth respectively.\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nOutside Scotland\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the centre of the arms is a quartered shield, depicting the three passant guardant lions of England in the first and fourth quarters, the rampant lion and double tressure flory-counterflory of Scotland in the second quarter, and a harp for Ireland in the third quarter.[4][1] Surrounding the shield is the Order of the Garter, the United Kingdom's most senior order of knighthood.[1] The supporters are a crowned English lion on the dexter (heraldic right), and a chained Scottish unicorn on the sinister (heraldic left).[5] Above the shield is a gold helmet, which has mantling of gold and ermine attached to it. On top of this is the crest, a crown with a crowned lion standing on it. Below the shield is a grassy mound, a type of compartment, on which are thistles, Tudor roses and shamrocks, representing Scotland, England and Ireland respectively.[1] In front of this is the motto Dieu et mon droit, a French phrase meaning 'God and my right'.[1]\n\nDuring the reign of Elizabeth II the crowns depicted in this version of the Royal Arms were close representations of St Edward's Crown. Following Charles III's decision to use the Tudor Crown in his royal cypher, the College of Arms envisaged that the crown on the Royal Arms will also change.[6] This would be similar to the design used from the beginning of Edward VII's reign in 1901 to the end of George VI's reign in 1952.[citation needed] However, as of April 2024 the St Edward's Crown version remains in use.[7][8]\n\nIn Scotland\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Royal Arms in Scotland use the same basic elements, but with distinctive Scottish symbolism. In the shield the Scottish arms occupy the first and fourth quarters and the English arms the second, giving the former precedence.[1] The shield is surrounded by the Order of the Thistle. The crest is a crowned red lion holding a sword and sceptre (representing the Honours of Scotland), facing forward sitting on a crown. Above it is the Scots motto 'In defens', a contraction of the phrase 'In my defens God me defend'. The supporters are a crowned and chained Scottish unicorn on the dexter, and a crowned English lion on the sinister. Between each supporter and the shield is a lance displaying the flag of their respective kingdom. The grassy mound beneath the shield contains only thistles; on it is a second motto, that of the Order of the Thistle: Nemo me impune lacessit (no one will attack me with impunity).[1] The crowns in the Scottish version of the arms are conventionally stylised to resemble the Crown of Scotland.\n\nBlazon\n\n[edit]\n\nChanges to the blazon of the Royal Arms are in the Royal prerogative, presumed to be under ministerial advice.[9]\n\nThis table breaks down the blazons to enable comparison of the differences between the general arms and the arms used in Scotland.\n\nEverywhere except Scotland Scotland Quarters I & IV Gules three lions passant gardant in pale Or armed and langued Azure (for England) Or a lion rampant Gules armed and langued Azure within a double tressure flory-counter-flory of the second (for Scotland) Quarter II Or a lion rampant Gules armed and langued Azure within a double tressure flory-counter-flory of the second (for Scotland) Gules three lions passant gardant in pale Or armed and langued Azure (for England) Quarter III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland) Surrounded by The Garter circlet The collar of the Order of the Thistle Crest Upon the Royal helm the imperial crown proper, thereon a lion statant gardant Or imperially crowned proper Upon the Royal helm the crown of Scotland proper, thereon a lion sejant affronté Gules armed and langued Azure, imperially crowned proper holding in his dexter paw a sword and in his sinister a sceptre, both proper Supporters Dexter a lion rampant gardant Or imperially crowned proper, sinister a unicorn Argent, armed, crined and unguled Or, gorged with a coronet Or composed of crosses patée and fleurs de lis a chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or Dexter a unicorn Argent imperially crowned proper, armed, crined and unguled Or, gorged with a coronet Or composed of crosses patée and fleurs de lis a chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or holding the standard of Saint Andrew, sinister a lion rampant gardant Or imperially crowned proper holding the standard of Saint George Motto Dieu et mon droit (French) In defens (Scots) Order Motto Garter: Honi soit qui mal y pense (Anglo-Norman) Thistle: Nemo me impune lacessit (Latin) Plants on the compartment Roses, thistles and shamrocks (on the same stem) Thistles only\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nArms of England, Scotland and Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nThe present royal arms originated in the separate arms of the Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland. Wales had been incorporated into the Kingdom of England in the 16th century.[a] The English arms were also quartered with those of France from 1340 (except 1360–69) representing the English claim to the French throne.[11] In 1603, James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones, and to symbolise this union of the crowns, the arms of England (including France) and Ireland were quartered with those of Scotland.[11] A separate version was retained for use in Scotland in which the English and Scottish quarters were reversed.\n\nDuring the Commonwealth and The Protectorate in the mid-seventeenth century, the arms were significantly changed as the monarchy had been abolished. The Irish harp continued to be used, but England was represented by St George's Cross and Scotland by St Andrew's Cross.[4] These were impaled in various ways, and from 1655 to 1659, also included the arms of the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell, on an inescutcheon.[4] The motto was also changed to the Latin \"pax quaeritur bello\" (English: peace is sought by war).[4] The former royal arms were restored upon the restoration of Charles II in 1660.\n\nIn 1689, Mary II and William III became co-monarchs and impaled their arms. Both used the Royal Arms, with William also bearing an inescutcheon of Nassau, the royal house to which he belonged.[11] On Mary's death in 1694, William ruled alone and used his arms only.[11] Anne inherited the throne upon the death of William III, and the royal arms returned to the 1603 version. She was the last monarch of the independent kingdoms of England and Scotland and the first monarch of Great Britain.\n\nArms of Great Britain\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Acts of Union 1707 united the two kingdoms of England and Scotland into one Kingdom of Great Britain. The arms of the new kingdom impaled England and Scotland in the first and fourth quarters, representing their union, with France in the second and Ireland in the third.[11] In 1714, the Elector of Hanover, George I, became king, and the arms of Hanover were placed in the fourth quarter.[11]\n\nArms of the United Kingdom\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1801, Great Britain and Ireland were united to form the United Kingdom, and the monarch's claim to the French throne was dropped.[11] The French quarter was removed from the Royal Arms, and the remaining quarters were rearranged so that (outside Scotland) England occupied the first and fourth, Scotland the second, Ireland the third, and Hanover an inescutcheon topped by an electoral bonnet.[11] Within Scotland the Scottish and English quarters were reversed. In 1816, the electorate of Hanover became a kingdom, and the bonnet was replaced with a crown in the Royal Arms.[11]\n\nIn 1837, Victoria became queen of the United Kingdom but not Hanover, as the latter followed Salic law which barred women from the succession.[11] The Hanoverian inescutcheon was therefore removed, and the Royal Arms reached the form they have retained to the present. The only changes since have been cosmetic, such as altering the depiction of the Irish harp so that it no longer includes a bare-breasted woman.\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nRoyal coats of arms of the United Kingdom Arms Dates Details 1801–1816 The Acts of Union 1800 united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. At the same time, George III abandoned his claim to the French throne and the fleur-de-lis was removed. For the Electorate of Hanover, there is an inescutcheon surmounted by the electoral bonnet.[4] 1816–1837 The electoral bonnet on the inescutcheon was replaced by a crown in 1816, as Hanover had been declared a kingdom two years prior.[4] 1837–present\n\nThe accession of Queen Victoria ended the personal union between the United Kingdom and Hanover, as Salic law prevented a woman from ascending the Hanoverian throne, and the inescutcheon of the arms of Hanover was removed.[4] The new arms were announced in The London Gazette on 26 July 1837[12] and first used in The Gazette on 8 August 1837.[13][14] This was the final change to the blazon of the Royal Arms and all later adaptions were purely stylistic.\n\nOn his succession in 1901, Edward VII had considered adding the Arms of Saxony as an inescutcheon as he had done when Prince of Wales, and also a representation for Wales, but he was dissuaded by officials.[15] There were also unsuccessful calls for some representation of the wider British Empire.[16][17] The Irish harp remained despite the Partition of Ireland in 1921.\n\nChanging styles\n\n[edit]\n\nThe blazon of the Royal Arms has been changed only three times since the creation of the United Kingdom: in 1801, 1816 and 1837. But how these blazons are depicted have been subject to artistic interpretation and the preferences of the monarch under the royal prerogative.[b][9]\n\nHeraldic crowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Tudor Crown and St Edward's Crown\n\nThe blazons of the Royal Arms do not specify any particular heraldic crown to be depicted in the achievement, using only the term 'imperial crown proper' to indicate a crown with arches and in its natural colours.[c] The first reference to 'the imperial crown' of England was during the reign of Henry VIII in the Ecclesiastical Appeals Act 1532 which declared that 'this realm of England is an empire...governed by one Supreme Head and King having the dignity and royal estate of the imperial Crown of the same'.[19][d] His successor, Edward VI, would be crowned with an actual imperial crown in 1547.[21] Although Fox-Davies states that the St Edward's Crown is supposed to be heraldically represented over the Royal Arms or other insignia because \"it is the 'official' crown of England\", various other crowns have been depicted, including the Imperial State Crown and the Tudor Crown.[18] The Scottish versions of the arms have been more consistent in using the Crown of Scotland.[e]\n\nThe heraldic crown in England was based on St Edward's Crown from the reign of Charles II until Victoria. Early depictions of the Royal Arms during her reign featured the Imperial State Crown which was created for Victoria's coronation in 1838 and was similar to the St Edward's Crown but with a flatter top.[23] However, depictions varied depending on the artist.[18]\n\nIn 1876, Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India, and in 1880, the heraldic crown was altered to give it a more imperial form by making the arches semi-circular.[24] However, Victoria had favoured a Tudor style crown since at least the 1860s.[25][26][f]\n\nAfter the accession of Edward VII, the War Office raised the issue of a standardised design of the crown for use by the British Army, there being in use several crowns of different patterns.[15] In 1901, the king decided on a single Tudor Crown design based on the crown of Henry VII, as \"chosen and always used by Queen Victoria personally\".[18][15]\n\nGeorge VI had ceased to use the style 'Emperor of India' in 1948 following India's independence in 1947,[30] and on the accession of Elizabeth II in 1952, she opted to change from the Tudor Crown back to the St Edward's Crown design.[31] Charles III adopted the Tudor Crown on his accession in 2022, similar to that last used under George VI but with a plain circlet and with larger jewels, cross and ermine. In addition to being larger, the jewels are also of different shapes to the 1901 pattern: the central sapphire and the outer rubies are of a rhombus shape rather than oblong.[6][32] The Scottish variant of the arms was unaltered.\n\nHeraldic harps\n\n[edit]\n\nThere have also been changes to the depiction of the Irish harp, with the frame variously depicted as a winged woman or as a Gaelic harp, with the latter being more typical in the twentieth century, particularly since Elizabeth II.[33]\n\nUsage\n\n[edit]\n\nRestrictions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Royal Arms are the arms of dominion of the British monarch.[34][1] They differ from ordinary armorial bearings in that they are not hereditary,[11] and the right to bear them is annexed to the reigning sovereign, and therefore his government, as a royal prerogative.[9][35] Members of the royal family may be granted differenced arms, but they cannot use arms identical to those of the monarch.[34]\n\nCrown copyright applies in perpetuity to depictions of the Royal Arms and any of its constituent parts under the royal prerogative, and The National Archives restricts rights to reproduce them.[36][37] Although Crown Copyright usually expires 50 years after publication, Section 171(b) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 made an exception for 'any right or privilege of the Crown' not written in an act of parliament, thus preserving the rights of the Crown under the unwritten royal prerogative.[38]\n\nIn addition, use of the Royal Arms and devices for commercial purposes is specifically restricted in the UK (and in countries which are party to the Paris Convention) under sections 4 and 99 of the Trade Marks Act 1994, and its use is governed by the Lord Chamberlain's Office.[39][40][41]\n\nThe Royal Arms may be displayed by holders of a Royal Warrant but may not be used as a trade mark and should only be displayed for the duration of the grant of a Royal Warrant. It is an offence under Section 12 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 to give a false indication that any goods or services are supplied to the monarch or any member of the royal family.[42][41]\n\nUK usage\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe UK Government generally uses a simplified form of the arms which omits the helm and mantling and reduces the crest to the crown alone, and with no compartment.[2] Use of the Royal Arms by government departments and agencies is governed by the Cabinet Office.[2]\n\nThe Royal Arms feature on all Acts of Parliament, in the logos of government departments, on the cover of all UK passports and passports issued in other British territories and dependencies, as an inescutcheon on the diplomatic flags of British Ambassadors, and on The London Gazette. It is also used in The British Overseas Territories, namely on all acts of the Anguilla House of Assembly and by the administrations of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, the Pitcairn Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The Scotland Office and the Advocate General for Scotland use the Scottish version of the arms, again without the helm or crest.\n\nThe simplified Scottish Royal Arms were used as the day-to-day logo of the Scottish Executive until September 2007, when the body was rebranded as the Scottish Government and began using a logo incorporating the flag of Scotland.[43] The Scottish Government continues to use the arms on some official documents, including Acts of the Scottish Parliament.\n\nJudicial\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Royal Arms appear in courtrooms in England and Wales, typically behind the judge's bench, and symbolise that justice comes from the monarch.[44] One exception is the magistrates' court in the City of London,[44] where both the Royal Arms and arms of the City appear behind the bench. Courtrooms in Scotland, in the same way, usually display the Scottish version of the Royal Arms.[45] The Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 prohibited the display of the Royal Arms in courtrooms or on court building exteriors in Northern Ireland, with some exceptions.[g][46]\n\nHowever, the arms are not displayed in the Middlesex Guildhall, which houses the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, as the remit of the former includes the four nations of the entire UK, and the latter is the final court of appeal for three independent republics and for the independent sultanate of Brunei Darussalam, not recognizing the judicial authority of the British monarch as their head of state, as well as for the various British territories and sovereign bases, the Crown dependencies, and other independent Commonwealth realms where the king is the head of state but separated from the judicial authority.[47]\n\nRoyal Standard\n\n[edit]\n\nA banner of the Royal Arms, known as the Royal Standard, is flown from buildings in which the monarch is resident or present. The Palace of Westminster, for example, usually flies the Union Flag, but flies the Royal Standard when the monarch is present for the State Opening of Parliament. When the monarch is not in residence at a palace in Scotland the Royal Banner of Scotland is flown; palaces in the rest of the UK fly the Union Flag.\n\nHeraldry\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Royal Arms feature on the tabard worn by officers of arms of the College of Arms and Court of the Lord Lyon.[48] These garments are worn at several traditional ceremonies, such as the annual procession and service of the Order of the Garter at Windsor Castle, the State Opening of Parliament, the coronation, and state funerals.[48]\n\nCoinage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Royal Arms regularly feature on British coinage, and are used as a logo by the Royal Mint. In 2008 a new series of designs for all seven coins of £1 and below was unveiled by the Royal Mint, every one of which is drawn from the Royal Arms. The full Royal Arms appear on the one pound coin, and sections appear on each of the other six, which combine to form a complete depiction.[49]\n\nArmed Forces\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Royal Arms with the crest but without the helm is used as the rank insignia for Class 1 Warrant Officers in His Majesty's Armed Forces.\n\nEcclesiastical\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is customary (but not mandatory) for churches of the Church of England and Church of Scotland to display the Royal Arms as the established church of England and the national church of Scotland respectively.[50][51] If a church building of either denomination does not currently display the Royal Arms, permission from the Crown must be given before one can be used.[52]\n\nCorporate\n\n[edit]\n\nUse of the Royal Arms and devices for commercial purposes is specifically restricted in the UK (and in countries which are party to the Paris Convention) under sections 4 and 99 of the Trade Marks Act 1994, and its use is governed by the Lord Chamberlain's Office.[39][40][41]\n\nThe Royal Arms may be displayed by select businesses which supply the royal household with goods or services and have been granted a Royal Warrant. But the arms may not be used as a trade mark and should only be displayed for the duration of the grant of a Royal Warrant. It is an offence under Section 12 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 to give a false indication that any goods or services are supplied to the monarch or any member of the royal family.[42][41]\n\nThe Royal Arms are incorporated into Imperial College London's coat of arms, which developed from institutions founded and patronised by Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince Consort.[53]\n\nThe UK newspaper The Times uses the Hanoverian Royal Arms as a logo, with The Sunday Times using the current version.\n\nCommonwealth usage\n\n[edit]\n\nCanada\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral provincial and territorial courts in Canada make use the Royal Arms:\n\nThe Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and Provincial Court of British Columbia[54][55][56]\n\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario and some older courts in Ontario.[57]\n\nThe Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador[58] and Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador[59]\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Yukon Territory[60] and the Court of Appeal of Yukon[61]\n\nThe Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island and the Court of Appeal of Prince Edward Island[62]\n\nThe Coat of arms of Canada is also closely modelled on the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom.\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Australia, the Royal Arms are used as a logo by the Parliament of Victoria and the Western Australian Legislative Council.[63][64] It is also used by several state and federal courts, including:\n\nThe seal of the Supreme Court of South Australia[65]\n\nThe Supreme Court of Victoria[66]\n\nThe Supreme Court of Tasmania[67]\n\nThe High Court of Australia, depicted alongside the Commonwealth Coat of Arms at the building's entrance[68]\n\nCourt rooms in New South Wales where the Royal Arms may not be removed for practical or heritage reasons[69]\n\nThe current Royal Arms are also used by Australian newspaper The Age.[70]\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nThe New Zealand Gazette displayed the Royal Arms until 1946.[71] The newspaper The Press used the Royal Arms as its masthead until 2023.[72]\n\nIrish Free State\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorically, when the Irish Free State established its own diplomatic seals in the 1930s, the Royal Arms were depicted on the throne behind George V in a unique form by having the Irish harp in two quarters and the English arms in one.[73][74]\n\nRoyal family\n\n[edit]\n\nMembers of the British royal family are granted their own personal arms. In the past, the monarch's younger sons used various differences; and married daughters of the monarch impaled the plain Royal Arms with their husbands' arms. But for many centuries now, all members of the royal family have had differenced versions of the Royal Arms settled on them by royal warrant.[75] Only children and grandchildren in the male line of the monarch are entitled to arms in this fashion: the arms of children of the monarch are differenced with a three-point label; while grandchildren of the monarch are differenced with a five-point label. An exception is made for the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, who also bears a three-point label. The labels are always white (argent) and each prince or princess has individual marks to form his or her particular difference, except the Prince of Wales, who uses a plain white three-pointed label.[75] Since 1911, the arms of the Prince of Wales also displays an inescutcheon of the ancient arms of the Principality of Wales.[75]\n\nQueens consort and the wives of sons of the monarch also have their own personal coat of arms. Typically this will be the arms of their husband impaled with their own personal arms or those of their father, if armigerous. However, the consorts of a queen regnant are not entitled to use the Royal Arms. Thus Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was granted his own personal arms. A notable exception to this rule was Prince Albert, who used the Royal Arms (differenced by a special label) quartered with his own Saxon royal arms.[75]\n\nCurrently the following members of the royal family have their own arms based on the Royal Arms:\n\nChildren and grandchildren of the monarch in the male line Armorial achievement Shield Bearer Difference(s) William, Prince of Wales, outside Scotland The coat of arms of Edward VIII and Charles III as Prince of Wales was the arms of the United Kingdom with a white label of three points and an inescutcheon bearing the arms of Wales. Prince William, Duke of Rothesay, in Scotland Used in Scotland, the arms of the Duke of Rothesay are those of Clan Stewart of Appin adapted, namely the quartered arms of the Prince and Great Steward of Scotland and Lord of the Isles (secondary titles of the Duke) with an inescutcheon as Scottish heir apparent (the Royal Arms of Scotland with a blue three-point label). Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex Three-point label with three red escallops in each point, alluding to the patrilineal arms of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The label changed from five to three points, with each point bearing an escallop, upon his father's accession to the throne in 2022, as previously stated by the College of Arms.[76][77][78] Anne, Princess Royal Three-point label, the points bearing a red cross, a red heart and a red cross.[4] Scottish version of the Princess Royal's arms with a three-point label, the points bearing a red cross, a red heart and a red cross.[4] Prince Andrew, Duke of York Three-point label, the centre point bearing a blue anchor.[4] Princess Beatrice, Mrs Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi Five-point label with three bees in alternate points, alluding to the patrilineal arms of her mother, Sarah, Duchess of York. Princess Eugenie, Mrs Jack Brooksbank Five-point label with three thistles in alternate points, alluding to the patrilineal arms of her mother, Sarah, Duchess of York. Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh Three-point label, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose. Scottish version of the Duke of Edinburgh's arms with a three-point label, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester Five-point label, the first, third and fifth points bearing a red cross, the second and fourth points bearing a red lion. Prince Edward, Duke of Kent Five-point label, the first, third and fifth points bearing a blue anchor, the second and fourth points bearing a red cross.[4] Princess Alexandra, The Hon. Lady Ogilvy Five-point label, the first and fifth points bearing a red heart, the second and fourth points bearing a blue anchor, and the third bearing a red cross.[4] Prince Michael of Kent Five-point label, the first, third and fifth points bearing a red cross, the second and fourth points bearing a blue anchor.[4] Consorts Queen Camilla The arms of the King impaled with those of Camilla's father, Major Bruce Shand, crowned with the royal crown.[80] Scottish version of the Queen's coat of arms with the royal crown. Catherine, Princess of Wales The arms of the Prince of Wales impaled with those of Catherine's father, Michael Middleton.[81] Meghan, Duchess of Sussex The arms of the Duke of Sussex impaled with those of her own design, crowned with the coronet of a child of the sovereign.[82] Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh The arms of the Duke of Edinburgh impaled with those granted in 1999 to Sophie's father, Christopher Rhys-Jones, with remainder to his elder brother Theo. The new grant was based on an unregistered 200-year-old design. The lion alludes to one of the Duchess's ancestors, the Welsh knight Elystan Glodrydd, prince of Ferrig.[83] Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester The arms of the Duke of Gloucester with an escutcheon of pretence granted to her by Royal Warrant on 18 July 1973. Katharine, Duchess of Kent The arms of the Duke of Kent impaled with those of the Duchess's father, Sir William Worsley, 4th Baronet. Princess Michael of Kent The arms of Prince Michael of Kent impaled with those of Marie Christine's father, Baron Günther Hubertus von Reibnitz.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nHeraldry portal\n\nUnited Kingdom portal\n\nArmorial of the United Kingdom\n\nCoat of arms of Canada – Canada's arms are closely modelled on the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom\n\nCoat of arms of Ireland – Ireland uses the medieval arms of Ireland that are incorporated into the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom\n\nArmorial of the House of Plantagenet\n\nList of British monarchs\n\nList of English monarchs\n\nList of Scottish monarchs\n\nCadency labels of the British royal family\n\nRoyal Cypher#Commonwealth realms\n\nRoyal badges of England\n\nRoyal Badge of Wales\n\nRoyal Standard of the United Kingdom\n\nFlag of the United Kingdom\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
