        "text": "Direct Line insurance group wants to cut 2,000 UK jobs as it seeks to extend its cost-cutting plan.\n\nThe latest threat to the 14,400-strong workforce comes after the company shed 1,200 jobs in 2012. Employees in support roles – HR, finance, communications – based at the head office in Bromley will bear the brunt of the cuts.\n\nThe group, which owns the Churchill and Green Flag brands, has announced it wants to double its cost-savings programme, up from a £100m target unveiled last year. Direct Line has intensified its crackdown on costs since its flotation on the stock market in October, after a de-merger from the Royal Bank of Scotland.\n\nRBS was forced to sell Direct Line by the European commission after its £45bn taxpayer rescue in 2008.\n\nDirect Line said talks with staff were under way, but Unite accused the company of excluding unions from the negotiations. No union has official recognition at Direct Line, but Unite has several hundred members among the workforce.\n\n\"The fact that Unite, the union with the largest number of finance sector workers in the country, has been refused recognition makes it easier for Direct Line to announce these savage cuts out of the blue,\" said Dominic Hook, Unite's national officer for finance. \"Unite will continue to strongly oppose anti-union bias where it exists in the finance sector and will give all the support we can to our members at Direct Line on an individual basis.\"\n\nThe cull at Direct Line follows revelations that the 'big four' banks – Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and HSBC – will have cut 189,000 jobs between the start of the financial crisis in 2008 and the end of this year.\n\nPaul Geddes, chief executive of Direct Line Group, said: \"It's clear that we need to become more efficient to deliver the good service and value our customers expect. We have not made these proposed changes lightly and understand the impact they will have on our people.\""
