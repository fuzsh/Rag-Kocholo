        "text": "By TRICARE Communications\n\nDo you live overseas and need health care? You might be able to get telemedicine care from home.\n\n“Different countries have different laws about telemedicine,” said Michael Griffin, a program analyst with the TRICARE Overseas Program Office at the Defense Health Agency. “This means that if you get telemedicine care in an overseas location, TRICARE will only cover this care if it meets certain requirements.”\n\nBefore you get telemedicine outside the United States, know what TRICARE covers and doesn’t cover.\n\nTelemedicine coverage and costs\n\nTRICARE covers secure video or audio-only telemedicine care overseas when:\n\nThe care is a TRICARE-covered benefit and is appropriate for telemedicine.\n\nThe country where you get care allows telemedicine.\n\nThe provider is TRICARE-authorized and located in the same country where you get care.\n\nThe provider follows all local health care and telemedicine rules.\n\nNote: Providers located in the U.S. aren’t eligible to provide telemedicine care overseas. This includes providers from Doctor On Demand, Telemynd, and SimpliFed.\n\nIf the care meets these rules, TRICARE Overseas will pay your claim. They’ll deny your claim if you get telemedicine care from a U.S.-based provider while overseas.\n\nRemember, telemedicine costs the same as in-person care. You may need a referral or pre-authorization for your telemedicine visit. Call International SOS, the TRICARE Overseas contractor, if you aren’t sure.\n\nDid you pay up front for telemedicine? You can file claims online with the TRICARE Overseas Secure Claims Portal. If you file by mail, fill out and sign the claim form (DD Form 2642). Remember to include all required information.\n\nHow to find a telemedicine provider overseas\n\nTo find a TRICARE-authorized provider who offers telemedicine:\n\nGo to the TRICARE Overseas Network Provider Search Tool.\n\nChoose your region, country, and TRICARE location. Then click “Search.”\n\nExpand the “Specialty” filter and check “Telemedicine.” You might need to click “View More” to see this option.\n\nPick a provider from the list.\n\nIf you can’t find a telemedicine provider with this tool, International SOS can help you.\n\nTelemental health\n\nTRICARE covers some telemental health services, as noted in the TRICARE Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services Fact Sheet. This care may need pre-authorization. Are you an active duty service member? You must have a referral and pre-authorization from your primary care manager for any mental health care outside a military hospital or clinic.\n\nWant to make a telemedicine appointment? Visit TRICARE Telemedicine to learn more. If you have questions about your care options, contact International SOS.\n\nWould you like the latest TRICARE news sent to you by email?
