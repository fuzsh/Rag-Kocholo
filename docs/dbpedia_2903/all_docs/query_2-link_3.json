        "text": "Direct Line started with a single product - car insurance. And just one way for customers to buy - over the phone.\n\nSince its launch in 1985, Direct Line's aim has always been to put the customer first. This began with cutting out the middleman, the forms and the jargon - all revolutionary changes in insurance at the time.\n\nIt started selling car insurance from a single call centre in Croydon, with just 63 employees and one product. Speed, simplicity and a practical approach lead to 80,000 policies sold in its first year."
