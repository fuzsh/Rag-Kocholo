It contains the following notable settings:\n\nThe configuration settings you will need to provide depends on which channel you wish to enable your client to integrate with:\n\nTo enable the client for Direct Line, you will need to specify values for DirectLineSecret.\n\nTo enable the client for Direct Line Speech, you will need to specify values for SpeechServiceRegionIdentifier and SpeechServiceSubscriptionKey.\n\nConfigure for Direct Line\n\nTo enable your Virtual Assistant to communicate over Direct Line, open your Web App Bot resource in Azure Portal, and select the Channels tab.\n\nNext, click the Configure Direct Line channel button. You will then be presented with the Direct Line channel configuration view.\n\nFrom here, you may either add a new site configuration, or repurpose the default site configuration. Here, we have repurposed the default site configuration and renamed it to ‘Direct Line Web Client’.\n\nOnce you have chosen your desired site configuration, click the Show button next to one of the text boxes underneath the Secret keys section, and copy the displayed value.\n\nFinally, return to your appsettings.json file in your Direct Line Web Client code, and paste the value into the DirectLineSecret setting.\n\nEnable Direct Line Enhanced Authentication\n\nBy default, when a user is prompted to sign in using an OAuth prompt over a Direct Line channel, the user must send a six-digit code back to the Virtual Assistant afterwards to complete the process.\n\nTo provide a more secure and seamless experience, you can optionally enable Enhanced Authentication for your Direct Line channel. This will enable automatically completing the sign-in process without needing to enter a separate code. You can learn more about Direct Line Enhanced Authentication here.\n\nTo enable Enhanced Authentication in your client, go to the Direct Line channel configuration for your Web App Bot resource in Azure Portal.\n\nFrom here, underneath the Enhanced authentication options section, click the Enabled toggle to turn it on.\n\nOnce you have done this, you will need to register one or more trusted origins:\n\nIf you are running on your local environment, simply put in ‘http://localhost/’. Note that the URI scheme must be HTTP.\n\nTo add a deployed Virtual Assistant, simply type in the base URI of your Virtual Assistant’s messaging endpoint, as located in your Web App Bot resource’s Settings tab, e.g. “https://myvirtualassistant.azurewebsites.net/”.\n\nFinally, return to your appsettings.json file in your Direct Line Web Client code, and change the value of the EnableDirectLineEnhancedAuthentication setting to ‘true’.\n\nConfigure for Direct Line Speech\n\nBy extending your Virtual Assistant to Direct Link Speech, it is very simple to enable voice control for your Virtual Assistant using the Direct Line Web Client.\n\nIn order to enable voice control, first follow the instructions above to enable Direct Line Speech. Once you have done this, you will need to update your appsettings.json as follows:\n\nSpeachServiceRegionIdentifier must be set to a corresponding identifier based on the Azure Region that your Speech Cognitive Service is deployed to, as described here.\n\nSpeechServiceSubscriptionKey must be set to one of the Speech Cognitive Service resource keys, which can be found on the Keys and Endpoint tab for the resource in Azure Portal, as shown below:\n\nRunning Your Client\n\nOnce you have successfully configured your Virtual Assistant and made the necessary updates to the Direct Line Web Client’s appsettings.json, you are ready to run the client! Just simply build the DirectLine.Web project, set it to the startup project, and run. A new browser will automatically open with your configured client running.\n\nDirect Line Mode\n\nTo chat with your bot, simply type into the text box and hit enter or click the send button.\n\nDirect Line Speech Mode\n\nTo chat with your bot, either:"
