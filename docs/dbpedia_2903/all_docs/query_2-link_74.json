        "text": "Direct Line Group needed to quickly shift from an office-based organisation to the vast majority of its employees working from home. It chose Total for its ability to respond rapidly, its flexibility and its competitive pricing. Total provides a complete service encompassing procurement, configuration, deployment and support of IT to DLG’s home workers, and has delivered more than 100,000 items.\n\nAt the outset of the global pandemic, we made the decision to rapidly move our workforce home. We needed to stand-up a new supply chain and fulfilment capability to support this urgent need, working with a partner that could rapidly deliver this need and support our dynamic and evolving requirements.\n\nTotal, was chosen due to their proven capability, agility, and flexibility with commercially structuring this arrangement in a fair and competitive manner. Within 72 hours of signing our initial agreement, and beyond our expectations, the supply chain and fulfilment centre had been stood up and the first batch of equipment was being shipped out to our key and vulnerable colleagues – providing them with the equipment required to continue to support our customers during a very trying time."
