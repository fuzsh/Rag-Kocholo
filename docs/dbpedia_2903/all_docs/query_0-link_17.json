Tech giants such as Sky are beginning to see the potential as the adoption of smart home devices rises. Insurance companies have the opportunity to capitalize on the growing potential of this group regardless of whether they choose to live in rental housing or eventually become homeowners.\n\nUK Household Insurance Market Segmentation by Gross Claims Types\n\nIncreases in weather and subsidence-related claims drove up the overall cost and number of claims incurred in 2022.\n\nThe key gross claims type in the UK household insurance market includes escape of water, weather, fire, business interruption, theft, accidental damage, subsidence, and other domestic claims. Escape of water incurred the highest claims in 2022. There was a decline in the value of household insurance claims in the second quarter of 2022. This was due to a drop in weather-related claims mostly owing to the second quarter’s lack of major storms and a much-below-average monthly rainfall, which minimized potential damage.\n\nMeanwhile, there was a rise in theft claims during the holiday season as well as throughout the year. As a result of the cost-of-living crisis, fraudulent theft claims increased, especially those involving jewelry and electrical goods, and many of them went undetected. This might be one of the reasons for the growth of the number of theft claims in the UK household insurance market.\n\nUK Household Insurance Market Analysis by Gross Claim Types, 2022 (%)\n\nBuy the Full Report for More Claim Type Insights into the UK Household Insurance Market\n\nDownload A Free Report Sample\n\nUK Household Insurance Market - Competitive Landscape\n\nAviva led the household insurance industry in 2022, followed by RSA and Direct Line.\n\nSome of the leading household insurers in the UK household insurance market are:\n\nAviva\n\nRSA\n\nDirect Line\n\nChubb\n\nAllianz\n\nAviva has made major inroads in the High Net Worth (HNW) market and has extended its home and travel insurance arrangement with TSB Bank for a further five years till 2028, strengthening its position within the market.\n\nUK Household Insurance Market Analysis by Household Insurers, 2022 (%)\n\nBuy the Full Report to Know More about the Insurers in the UK Household Insurance Market\n\nDownload A Free Report Sample\n\nUK Household Insurance Market – Latest Developments\n\nIn the UK, Amazon has launched the Amazon Insurance Store to give customers a new method of buying home insurance.
