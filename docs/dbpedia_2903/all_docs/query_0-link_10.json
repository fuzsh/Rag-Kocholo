There are three key cover levels of landlord insurance - Buildings, Contents and Leaseholders Fixtures & Fittings. Buildings Insurance provides cover for damage to, or loss of, the property's structure. Contents covers damage to, or loss of, landlord's possessions left within the property, like furniture. Leaseholders Fixtures & Fittings cover covers the fixed fittings within a property, like Bathroom suites or kitchen units, where cover is excluded under the main buildings insurance policy which has been arranged such as a for a block of flats. You can combine your insurance covers like Buildings and Contents if you need to cover both the property structure and possessions in the property.\n\nFor more information please click here."
