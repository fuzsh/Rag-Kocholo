        "text": "There are a few things you’ll need to get a car insurance quote, including:\n\nYour car details Your car's registration number (or its make, model and year), as well as its value, purchase date and annual mileage.\n\nPersonal details Your address, driving license info, previous claims and other named drivers on your policy.\n\nPolicy start date An inaccurate or change in start date may affect your premium.\n\nYour No Claim Discount Details of any claim-free driving could reduce your premium. We may require proof.\n\nThe price of your Direct Line car insurance quote depends on how likely you are to make a claim and how expensive that claim could be. It's based on several different factors, including:\n\nDriver age and experience On average, experienced drivers are less likely to have an accident than newer drivers. However, the risk of being involved in an accident tends to increase after the age of 70.\n\nYour job What you do for work can impact the time you travel, and the amount of driving you do.\n\nWhere you live Some areas are riskier than others, and accidents are more likely if you live in an area with relatively high traffic levels.\n\nRegulatory changes These are changes the Government makes, such as larger payouts or removing legal costs for specific claims.\n\nCrime rate A spate of crimes resulting in more car insurance claims could result in higher premiums to reflect the risk level of your car’s location.\n\nTraffic levels The level of traffic on UK roads will change over time, influenced by things like the cost of petrol. When overall levels of traffic change, the number of claims can change too.\n\nType of vehicle you drive Your car's value, engine size and desirability could increase the risk of it being stolen or the cost of it being repaired.\n\nHow far you drive The more miles you drive, it's more likely you'll be involved in an accident.\n\nPrevious claims or convictions You must tell us about these events, or it could invalidate your policy if you need to make a future claim.\n\nIndustry trends This could include higher prices for parts and labour, patterns in car theft and the types of claims being made.\n\nDriving other cars is a standard inclusion under our private car policies and allows the policy holder to drive cars that are not owned by them or hired to them, providing they have permission of the vehicle owner to use the vehicle. However, there are restrictions to this benefit such as age (must be over 25 at policy inception / renewal date) and occupation.\n\nTo find out if you have Driving Other Cars cover, check your certificate of insurance.\n\nThe cover provides protection against legal liability for death or bodily injury to a third party and damage to third party property. The cover is limited to third party only and should be viewed as emergency cover."
