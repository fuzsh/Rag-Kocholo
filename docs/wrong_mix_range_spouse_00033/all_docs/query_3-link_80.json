        "text": "The following paragraphs concern the study of personality, as induced by the positions of the planets and rising sign. Some character traits mentioned may seem completely contradictory and incompatible. This is because the rough-hewn personality is a rarity. Usually, individuals are made up of a subtle orchestration of many different tones or aspects. However, serious introspection or detailed analysis should make it possible to distinguish opposing or diverging images comprising overall character, and perhaps find the best and most harmonious way to integrate them.\n\nHeath lived in the here-and-now, immediately obeying his impulses. He was guided by a fire burning within him. He rarely heed warnings of reflection and reason; instead, he listened to his instincts, as if his unconscious were perpetually emerging. This was the source of his spontaneity and passion. Because he was continually being born, he championed all phenomena symbolic of birth: breaking ground, beginning, clearing. He had little interest pursuing new ideas he brought into being, because his inner flame was always urging him to move on quickly to the next innovation. He was not a good manager. He was straightforward. When Heath committed himself, he did so with mind, body, and soul. Restraint and moderation were concepts which were totally foreign to him, because he lived by the fullness of his instinct, the force of his desire.\n\nDue to Heath's energetic temperament, his determination immediately invented action for fulfilling his desires. His attitude engendered certain risks. Sometimes his impetuousness, or lack of maturity or patience, or appetite for experience led him into a blind alley. But risk was part of his life. Since his fervor was immune to calculation, second thoughts, and cunning, he had no fear. He was the type of hero whose courageous deeds were difficult to distinguish from bravado or sheer foolhardiness. His top priority was to take action, immediately, like a first responder. This level of action response was mostly due to his Aries Sun being conjunct his Aries Ascendant. Delay was torture to him. He was in a hurry to live, to take his urges and impulses to their ultimate conclusion, even though his lack of forethought may actually make his goal take longer to accomplish. Heath rarely evaluated obstacles objectively: instead, he dashed into the fray, like the Australian hero Ned Kelly, bristling with determination, oblivious to the size or scope of the difficulties. But he had a true heroâ€™s courage and vitality. He was undaunted by challenges and real danger, to the surprise of outside observers.\n\nLike everyone, Heath sometimes experienced failure. But he rarely despaired or became overly discouraged by it; it never overcame him. He didn't see it as a tragedy; in fact, he mustered even more strength and power for the next attack, since he was convinced of success. He sometimes had problems finishing things he started. Once the initial urge and enthusiasm was dulled, he lost some of his drive and found himself faced with a sluggish, material reality which did not always inspire him. It was important for him to tackle short-term tasks only. Of course, his fans will recognize all of the above qualities as being the stuff of which great leaders are made. Sharing his enthusiasm and drive, and delegating the follow-up tasks to more patient assistants, he could accomplish amazing things. Stirred by all stimuli of the outside world, this man was indifferent to nothing.\n\nAs a result, Heath's emotionalism sometimes troubled or destabilized him. Moreover, he was eternally impassioned. And since passion is by definition uncontrolled, once it is kindled it is either consumed or consuming. He needed to be aware of his penchant for excess. As we all now know, he was subject to negative passions, such as his drug use. He could be irritable and heedless to everything except his impulses, which were not always reasonable. He needed to channel his energy in positive directions at all times. His vigor was only an outer armor. Although he seemed to embody strength itself, being athletic, full of self-assurance and courage, he had that vulnerable underbelly: his inner self.\n\nAs a result of that vulnerability, the quality of Heath's emotional relationships had an important impact on his overall well-being. He did well to get a good education in the things that interested him, such as acting, photography, video, music, dance and art. It counteracted his native tendency to oversimplify. In life, people and things are more complex than imagined, and his intellectual efforts helped him understand that.\n\nHeath tended to place his emotions in the forefront. He was sensitive and sometimes vulnerable to influences from the outer world. This was due to his \"psychic\" abilities from all the Water signs in his birth chart.\n\nAt the time of his birth, the Sun and Ascendant were following a path through the sign of Aries, a Fire sign. This configuration gave a certain cohesion to his personality. A summary of the various descriptive terms mentioned earlier sketch out a quick portrait of his personality. The following summary words capture the essence of Heath's character:\n\nIndividualism\n\nVitality\n\nPassion\n\nPugnacity\n\nImpatience\n\nImpetuosity\n\nEnterprise\n\nInnovation\n\nHis temperament was competitive by nature and governed by a need to express his energies, both physically and mentally. Generally, his ardent impulsiveness and contagious enthusiasm were apt to command attention and strong enough to shatter resistance.\n\nHeath's open mind, capable of insights on multiple levels, empowered him to invent and lead, to inspire and command. Most at home in the realm of idealism, his innocence in the realm of material exploitation made him something of a daredevil. His massive and resolute will was whole, optimistic, and constructive; it enabled him to improvise, to face risk boldly and confidently, and to create.\n\nHeath's sensitivity was lively and spontaneous, generous and noble. His kind-heartedness and Promethean spirit predisposed him to spectacular deeds...to righteousness, rebellion against dogma, and outrage at any source of unfairness or weakness. He was just like a knight in shining armour, as in \"A Knight's Tale\". He was fully himself when he was embarking on an adventure in life.\n\nBorn 3 and a half to 7 days after the rising of the New Moon, he was a \"Crescent Moon\" lunar type. This \"soli-lunar\" configuration indicated Heath may have needed to make an effort to free himself from the past. Something related to his childhood, parents, or ancestors holding him back, or impairing his effectiveness and could be overcome. What was it? This Webmaster surmises it could be the industrial past of his family in Australia, I am merely speculating; but that is what Heath broke away from with his family.\n\nDue to Heath's past, he refused tried-and-true models, always fighting to justify his innovative viewpoints, and tending to break away from tradition...here we see his refusal to take the \"Spiderman\" role he was offered, preferring more innovative, independent filmmakers. He \"supposedly\" was hardly ever aware that he was making career and lifestyle choices...but this Webmaster thinks Heath WAS aware... based on an urge to modify his relationship to society, and the rigid standards and models from the past.\n\nWarm and affable, he was animated by honesty and generosity. Due to the solar dominance of his birth chart, his father influenced him strongly and imprinted Heath with the positive values which became the core of his being. However, his perception and comprehension of the world were filtered through an innate ability for artistic discrimination, a sense of aesthetics. For him, \"beauty\" was \"truth\" and not vice-versa. Style, harmony and skills involved with putting things on display, such as artistic representation, light, and transparency, are concepts which came naturally to Heath, and he made use of them in his life. Hence, especially his photography.\n\nThe following psychological study is an analysis which does not take into consideration factors such as social background or education. Nevertheless, it describes the basic structure and dynamic of the psyche as the result of an interplay of astrological influences without confining to certain categories or labelling. Certain contradictions may appear,but they are an integral part of the paradoxes and ambivalence of human nature. It is impossible to predict which tendency will win out. That depends on decisions made.\n\nConsciousness and The Ideal of Self:\n\nHeath was a meticulous and dogged worker, shown by Saturn in Virgo in the 6th house, gifted for tasks which required great precision and discipline. He struggled with pessimism about his own self-worth and tried to compensate for this feeling by constantly keeping busy and devoting himself almost entirely to those close to him. This feeling of inadequacy likely comes from Mars, Venus, & Mercury, especially Mercury...a mental, intellectual planet...in the sign of Pisces in the 12th house, a house that does not deal with concrete things, but with the subconscious, and that is always where the bogeyman lives in all of us in 1 form or other.\n\nAccording to his chart, Heath had a paternal complex and some trouble finding his identity. His father was absent physically during his childhood at times because of the divorce, which deprived him of the patterns or models which are usually helpful in structuring a personality. Because he might have lacked a particular sense of security which could be provided by a paternal presence, as well as the examples of behavior to follow in confronting the difficulties inherent in every life, he was forced to protect himself against negative influences and find his own system to grow and feel secure.\n\nAlthough this psychological system was quite useful to Heath as a child, it settled in to such a degree that it interfered with his evolution. Psychological defense mechanisms and crutches which were once useful encumbered his mind or inhibited his development. As a result, in certain situations, it was difficult for him to assert himself, and he tended to remain an awkward or passive observer. This side of him showed in his interviews. Because his authoritarian urges were mainly directed at himself rather than others, he sometimes felt guilty about his behavior. He judged himself severely, and sometimes punished himself by setting difficult tasks for himself. Gradually he built up a strong inner discipline towards his career.\n\nHeath's personality and behavior were liable to be disrupted by a contradiction between the masculine and feminine archetypes ruling his psyche. Because his sensitivity was in conflict with his determination, his attitude and performance could be moody, fluctuating, and uncertain. He often had the feeling he had to make superhuman efforts to succeed in fulfilling his ambitions. His unconscious, sensitive side often disapproved of his conscious endeavors and worked to defeat them, causing crucial omissions, mistakes, and gaps which sometimes sabotaged his plans. In Heath's relationships, the images he would build up and project on the other were contradictory. So any bond, even if pleasant and positive, grated on his nerves. He found it somehow dissatisfying and irritating at the same time...hence, the long list of girlfriends and lovers. This inner conflict in him was likely due to his Sun sign Aries square his Moon sign Cancer.\n\nHeath had a profound and fertile inner life and a prolific imagination due to all the Water Sign/emotional/introverted influences in his chart, but his energy resources were not always sufficient to follow through on and accomplish his dreams. He tended to live in osmosis with his environment; effort and action took a heavy toll on him (this was the Pisces effect from his chart). Usually, Heath understood phenomena and events intuitively, without effort; so he was not in the habit of disciplining or shaping his thought processes. Like his thoughts, his personality was rather amorphous and disorganized. Because of this lack of structure, he could have trouble asserting his individuality and making a personal contribution to society through his career, but as we saw, he overcame his hesitation to become a great actor, making major contributions to the film industry and to society in general.\n\nHeath had an inalienable awareness of the void and the vanity of existence. He was sometimes disoriented and deconstructed by an unknowable, unconscious force and tended to ignore or disparage the superficial pleasures and pains of daily life, preferring to dive into the depths of human experience as deeply as his intellectual, emotional, and spiritual capacities permit. Grappling with his \"fundamental nature,\" with the deepest and most primitive part of himself, he was sometimes aghast at the discovery of the sheer power of his instincts and felt an imperious need to cope with them. This special consciousness he was endowed with is beyond the bounds of conventional schools of human understanding and thought and may have been a source of identity problems for Heath at the outset. It was not easy for Heath to recognize himself in any social or narcissistic models, or identify with any existing roles or attitudes, so he found himself forced to assert and expressed his identity in a way which struck his contemporaries as strangely intense if not eccentric. Hence, his unique style of method acting.\n\nAdaptation and Sensitivity:\n\nMild and sensitive, Heath was deeply human. He was sociable and sincerely devoted to others. His mother had a strong influence on his psyche, and his childhood was an important time in his life. He identified with vivid childhood memories; they were the basis for his reveries, for his extreme sensitivity, and for habits which he was slow to break. Heath thrived in the shelter of a family setting, soothed by the presence of a spouse and children. He was fond of security and routine; being somewhat impressionable and anxious, he could have trouble adjusting to situations which were unfamiliar.\n\nHeath had a sensitive and affectionate nature. He sought tenderness and gentleness more than passion. His relationships with others were smooth and pleasant, and he had a natural sense of tact and social grace.\n\nOut of either shyness or caution, Heath hid and protected his sensitivity behind a fairly cool, aloof exterior. He was fairly conservative, respectful of tradition and convention, and followed rules. Since he needed stability to alleviate his feelings of frustration and sometimes emotional dependency, he had great faith in contracts which seal relationships. And yet, he never married in life. This astrologer/WebMaster believes Heath never found anyone he really wanted to marry or he would have done it, without hesitation. His ties to his past were fairly strong. They were a source of reassurance and safety, because his parents gave a lot to him.\n\nLove and Sensuality:\n\nHeath's sensitivity may sometimes have overwhelmed his partner(s), and his compassion for her was profound. He readily sacrificed his own interests for others, also gave help and assistance to them. A romantic and an idealist, he sometimes lacked discernment in his choice of partners. He was confused, evasive and had trouble expressing his feelings clearly. Nevertheless, he was capable of devoting himself entirely to the person he loved. He also had a tendency to daydream and become lost in himself. Again, I see his Pisces planets influencing his behaviour.\n\nHeath's birth chart indicates an emotional function expressed in a direct and fairly impulsive way. He enjoyed reaching out to other people and making discoveries. An eternal teenager with his gaze riveted on the future, he was imbued with an eminently subjective and personal idealism.\n\nAccordingly, it appears Heath was torn between two different sides of his nature. His desire to impress conflicts with his attachment to the nest; his social ambitions contradicting his need for security; and his natural self-focus, hard to reconcile with his altruism. Heath, if he had lived, was likely to marry a prominent person...one he could be proud of. His own social position may have disappointed him, but the family might have had would have given satisfactions he missed in his childhood family.\n\nHeath's love life was full of ambivalence. Although he was sentimental, he was likely to be fickle sometimes. Despite his deep sensual urges, he could be extremely idealistic and spiritual. The result was relative instability and confusion. Heath might suddenly allow himself to be enchanted by a dream person when he was trying to control his sex drive to attain true spiritual fulfillment. Conversely, Heath might have committed to an exceptional marriage based on mutual devotion and great high-mindedness.\n\nHeath was hypersensitive and tended to re-live anxieties, apprehensions, and romantic absolutes of his first love relationships, which occurred around ages of 13-14 years or 20-21 years. He was exquisitely sensitive, but mostly barricaded behind a layer of aloofness. He would not settle for anything less than eternal commitment, total harmony, and absolute loyalty. He was sometimes presumed to be cold, even by those close to him. Her usually hid his emotional reactions or not allow them to reach his consciousness, to protect his sensitivity, which he saw as his weak point. Heath was fairly vulnerable, even in the intimacy of a stable and established relationship. Usually, he would disguise his strong feelings as possessiveness or even jealousy. Heath could feel unworthy of the love which was lavished on him. This psychological prohibition which ruled over all of his desires and emotional effects was loosened with the passage of time. Also, his fear of approaching his partner diminished. So the latter part of his romantic life would be more rewarding.\n\nMental and Intellect:\n\nHeath had a rather irrational mind and voracious intellect, which was subject to his prolific imagination. Although he had flashes of intuition which were correct, his thought processes were sometimes messy and confused. His mind, oriented in many directions at the same time, was ruled by emotions and feelings. In tune with psychic and paranormal phenomena, his thinking required structure to rise from a blurry, uncertain, undifferentiated mass to that of a really significant vision with a grip on reality.\n\nHeath expressed his thoughts and ideas carefully, with relative lack of spontaneity. He was rather introverted and looked inside himself for solutions to problems he encountered in life. Because he tended to mistrust customary thought patterns, his opinion was usually highly personal.\n\nHeath's intellectual faculties and wit sometimes slowed down because they turned inward. Since he tended to be oriented to himself, he rarely communicated with others just for the pleasure of doing so. He sometimes felt misunderstood. Moreover, it seems difficult for him to express the complexity of his inner perceptions to anyone.\n\nHeath had a lively and agile spirit. He was curious and open-minded, approaching various life experiences without either dogmatism or prejudice. As a result of his liveliness, he tended to have an opinion on every subject, but he did not always have patience or perspective to examine subjects to gain in-depth knowledge of them.\n\nHeath enjoyed manipulating word expressions, concepts and amusing himself with witty remarks, satire, and controversy. Heath learnt to control his flow of words and elaborate his thoughts, so he became a talented communicator in the form of his \"quotes\". This was likely due to Gemini in his 3rd house, the sign of the Communicator.\n\nHeath was often hasty to construct arguments which would back up his ideas, so he was sometimes misunderstood. He was often blind to rashness of his judgments and was convinced they were well-founded and objective, which sometimes irritated people around him. If he disciplined his mind somewhat more, Heath would have had more opportunities to apply his communications skills to his career. This impatience stems from the Aries Sun and ASC (Ascendant) in his chart.\n\nHeath had an insatiable appetite for knowledge and exceptional ability to learn. Without trying too hard, he could accumulate encyclopedic knowledge. His intellectual curiosity was sometimes a drawback. He sometimes had trouble limiting to a single subject, without being distracted by a multitude of others.\n\nIf Heath had chosen so, he could have succeeded in any of the following fields: teaching, historical scholarship, advertising, writing (journalistic or literary), travel...communication in any form. This would be due to his encyclopedic mind & Gemini, sign of communication, being on his 3rd house cusp, native house of communication as well.\n\nHeath had a definite taste for expression and communication. He couldn't survive without giving voice to his thoughts and speaking to other people. He delighted in his power to persuade, captivate, and sway an audience with his words. Hence, part of the reason acting provided an outlet for his personality.\n\nAttracted to anything new and original, Heath immediately grasped the utility and value of the latest technology or philosophy, no matter how complex it was, and could explain it to the uninitiated and popularize it. Being fairly high strung, he had trouble concentrating on a subject very long, unless it was a source of intellectual fascination or discovery. He had to make an effort to overcome this.\n\nHis open-mindedness offered Heath creativity, a valuable commodity in his acting and other pursuits such as photography. His personal development involved intellectual activity and progress, such as progressing into directing (via music videos), developing \"vrooming\" as an art form for video.\n\nHeath had a great deal of intuition but had problems organizing his thought processes and making intellectual commitments. Concepts of boundary and structure were inimical to Heath's mind, which was open and all-encompassing, premonitory, and web-like. His thoughts could be verbally indeterminate, vague, or ill defined. He tended to understand/sense things globally, without noticing the parts. Heath couldn't see the trees for the forest.\n\nIn daily life, though Heath was very perceptive, he could display absent-mindedness from fear of annoying people with his shrewdness or self-assertiveness. Heath's imagination sometimes escaped logic, cringed from confrontation with reality. His unwillingness to face reality caused relationship and/or career challenges.\n\nThe Sun is the first dominant in Heath's astral chart. In the following paragraph, we shall indicate the significance of this fact:\n\nAs the heart of the Solar System and the gravitational center of the travels of the Earth and the other planets, the Sun is the primordial light, the source of all warmth and life. From the dawn of humanity, it has been worshipped. It has symbolized the absolute power kings and despots yearn for and emulate. The Sun King, the nucleus of society, embodied a principle of cohesion and harmony.\n\nVarious subordinates (aka planets) revolved around it. In terms of psychological symbolism, the Sun corresponds to the center of an individual, the factor that rules one's psyche. Its luminous aspects are usually associated with knowledge and consciousness. As a creator of life, it is related to the image of the Mother and the influence of Motherhood on an individual's consciousness and ideals. As a result, the Sun's position in a birth chart always indicates the way in which an individual will relate to his/her goals and ideals, what his/her ambitions and aspirations might involve.\n\nA person whose chart is strongly \"solar\" usually identifies very positively with Motherhood. Heath's personality was friendly, energetic, and creative, with high ideals and a firm determination to accomplish them. He took his own superiority and authority over others for granted, and he had a natural ability to command the attention and admiration of an audience. He was a born leader who enjoyed being in the limelight and behaved somewhat theatrically or with dramatic exaggeration (y'all think?)\n\nHeath had definite artistic leanings. The sense of his ideals was evident to him and led him to be somewhat self-focused.\n\nPluto is the second dominant in Heath's astral chart. In the following paragraph, we shall indicate the significance of this fact:\n\nPluto is the planet of transformation. It rules the sign of Scorpio, the sign of death, redemption, and divine mysteries. Pluto's energy is mysterious. Its discovery in 1932 associates it symbolically with the creation of the nuclear bomb and the development of psychoanalysis. In ancient mythology, Pluto was considered to be associated with all the aspects of the Underworld - Hades, the Greek name for Pluto, was the god of Hell.\n\nToday, the Underworld is synonymous with the Mafia (AKA \"Cosa Nostra\", \"The Outfit\", \"The Mob\"), and the two share many characteristics. Pluto occupies an important place in the horoscopes of great mystics (Helen Blavatsky) and spiritual beings, as well as certain dictators and tyrants, among them the most ruthless and greedy for power.\n\nIn psychological terms, Pluto corresponds to the transmutation of instinctive energies into energies which are accessible consciously by the individual's ego. This transmutation, which is never completely controllable, induces a power complex.\n\nOn the social level, it might be symbolized by the nuclear disaster, the failure of Western Man to master the energy of the atom...a power complex gone awry. On the individual level, Pluto is expressed either in a \"power complex,\" in which instinctive energy is completely transmuted into a personal resource, or as a \"failure complex,\" in which certain inhibitions prevent the instinctive energy from being transmuted.\n\nPluto was in Libra at Heath's birth, in his 7th house, ruler of partnerships, including marriage, justice, law, courts, legal matters, balance in life, artistic matters. This mutes down the \"evil\" characteristics of Pluto quite a bit. The Libra influence gives balance & a sense of fairness to his Pluto power urges...Heath would think of other people, his partners, in a venture, before he grabbed power or did something \"politically incorrect\". But Heath was always very keen to form partnerships at all levels in his life...from business to romantic. And yes, these ventures would often involve legalities such as contracts, incorporations, business managers, and finally, legalities involving his will and legacy to his family.\n\nMars is the third dominant in Heath's astral chart. In the following paragraph, we shall indicate the significance of this fact:\n\nIn Greek mythology, Mars or Aries was the God of War. Traditional astrology associates him with the element Fire, the color Red, and the taste of Bitterness. Although it also symbolizes the elder brother in the cosmic family, it is more likely to be associated with declared enemies or adversaries. Martian morphology is typically virile, angular, and athletic and corresponds to aggressive, domineering, masculine behavior. Likewise, Mars is usually associated with rage, its resultant brutality, and male destructiveness and domination.\n\nPsychologically, Mars figures in any situation of conflict, opposition, and confrontation. Martian symbolism intervenes to separate, oppose, and decide...corresponds to duels, war, and any situation in real life involving an obstacle. Individuals who are greatly influenced by Mars are typically direct and straightforward...either unabashedly extroverted or furiously introverted. They are extremely active and extremely emotive. Their purpose in life seems to be inextricably mingled with a combat against an unacceptable situation, a challenge which they either issue or are forced to accept. It is the sign of a soldier or warrior.\n\nHow does this apply to Heath, who was soft-spoken, with his \"gentle way\", his kindness, caring, and compassion for others? He applied his \"warrior\" side of himself to breaking into acting, this WebMaster/Astrologer feels when she looks at his life. He took off for Sydney, AU with a friend at 17 YOA to seriously give acting a try. His father Kim stated: \"Heath knew what he wanted, and he went after it.\" That is the Mars acting in his personality...being used in a constructive manner in society, rather than destructively or as a professional soldier. His athletic ability was also a function of Mars in his chart.\n\nThe Twelfth House is an area of the sky which is especially important in Heath's theme, because it contains several planets: Venus, Mercury and Mars, ruling his rising sign. In the following paragraph, we explain general meanings of this fact.\n\nAccording to tradition, this area of the astrological chart relates to hardship, disease, hospitals, and all areas associated with weakness and weariness. More specifically, this last area of the sky map is associated with the last sign of the Zodiac, Pisces, or the Fishes. It symbolizes the epilogue of Heath's various experiences. This is where failures he had as he went through his evolution (Karma) accumulated; in certain cases, they had an impact on his health or well-being.\n\nThis house was thus associated with Heath's need to confront his past, own errors he made, and accepting his flaws. If he hoped to improve his performance, he needed to confront, understand and analyze his past. Before starting anew, it was important to settle unfinished business. The only situation this WebMaster can think of where Heath really needed to settle his past was with Michelle Williams, which he was unwilling to do, thereby seriously affecting his health, just like the 12th House promised. And we all know the outcome of that.\n\nHeath was the type of soul who wondered about the personal and spiritual value of his acts and thoughts. He was haunted by memories of his failures. He needed to have the courage to confront his mistakes and learn lessons from them.\n\nSource: www.Astrology.com and commentary from WebMaster, who studied Astrology for many years."
