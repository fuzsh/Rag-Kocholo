I e* -\n\nnot, because my mi.ther wishes her weklth\n\nis the fitmily, coldly lay plan« to win the\n\nl«T«of this young creature- It has ever been\n\nmy pride and pleasure to meet her wishes\n\nfat all things; but this I cannot do, even\n\nthough I am 'ber only son, and she a wi-\n\ndow.' Am I not in the right, Clara?\"\n\n\"ily noble brother is erer in the right,\n\nand yet I fear. Panl. that you will lore\n\nis spite of yourself.\"\n\n\"Why, Clara, rile is younger than you\n\nare, and how suoutd I feel to see another\n\naet in this way to my pet sister?\" And,\n\npressing his lips upon the pure brow of h's\n\nyoung sister, Paul Vane stepped from the\n\nwindow out upon the colonade.\n\nHope Lincoln and Clara Vane had been\n\nroom-mates and inseparable friends at the\n\n■ameplearant school where their mothers\n\nhad been before them. They had left\n\nschool at the same time, Clara to return to\n\nher heme on the banks of the Rappahan-\n\nnock, Hope to enter upon the gayeties of a\n\nfew York life. Mrs. Lincoln had been\n\ndea-l three year-, and Hope entered upon\n\nlife that saddest of all things—a mother-\n\nloagiri. Her father, a stern, cold m*n,\n\nhad died a year before the opening uf this\n\ntale. Hope, beautiful and wealthy, bad\n\nmany homes offered fyr her acceptance,\n\nbat for the present declined making any\n\nchoice of a permanent home, spending ber\n\ntime among her mother's many friends, for\n\nrelatives she bad not in the wide world.—\n\nThough flattered and carespe*', she was not\n\nkappy; the loviog heart of the orphan girl\n\npined for sympathy and a congenial home,\n\nand when a letter came from Cfara Vane,\n\nbeggtng her, in her mother's name, to\n\nmake their beautiful home her own, she\n\nleft the gay city without a single regret.\n\nClara had been in a flutter of happiness\n\nfor a week, exer since Hope's letter of ac-\n\nceptance came', and now that the day of\n\nher arrival had come she busied herself in\n\nloving cares for her comfort. The choicest\n\nflowers were gathered and arranged in the\n\ncheerful room which w:>s to he their mu-\n\ntual sleeping apartments. Slit- looped the\n\nlace curtain* with flowers; and, in her\n\nsweet, happy fancy, wove a beautiful\n\nwreath of t agrant roses, and garlanded\n\ni be dressing glass so soon to mirror Hope's\n\nloved face. Even yet she was not quite\n\ncontent, but must needs place some white\n\nviolets and bright red roses upon thcsnowy\n\nlace-fringed pillows where in fancy she al\n\nrtftdj beheld the bright head reclining.—\n\nAh, the \\' fo of our gladsome girlhood's\n\nJCM, how fftociful and full of poetry it is !\n\nIt may be not so lasting or so strong as t-ne\n\nlore of later yearn, bin O how beautiful,\n\nand how full of hope !\n\nMrs. Vane was a cold-hearted, scheming\n\nwomau, and had already singled out Hope\n\nLincoln, the heiress of many thousand**,\n\nfor her son's wife With foolish eagerness,\n\nshe revealed her plans to her children.\n\nPanl Vane had looked forward with plea\n\nrare to the*coming of sweet, childlike\n\nHope Lincoln; but now bis noble soul re-\n\nvolted at the mercenary plans of his mother\n\nHe bad not seen Hope for two years, when,\n\nat the age of -sweet sixteen,\" she bad\n\npassed a vncatioir with his sister, where\n\nshe sported a glad, free thing within his\n\nhomo: eves then the fresh, innocent heart\n\nand artless manner of Hope bad troubled\n\nthe calm current of his thoughts, and\n\nthrough the two years of separation her\n\nmemory bad lingered pleasantly about his\n\nheart. But bis mother had destroyed all;\n\nnow be would be kin>i and polite, y*t dis-\n\ntant, to the lady who, he suddeuly faucied,\n\nmight have grown prnud and haughty after\n\nthe manner of most heiresses; and yet,\n\nlittle, artless Hope, she could scarcely have\n\nchanged ia the two short years. It was\n\nwhile with his sister in the drawing-room\n\nthat the sound of carriage wheels attract-\n\ned them to the window just in time to see\n\nHope alight.\n\nIt ia evening. In I he handsome parlors\n\nof Mrs. Vane siL that stately lady, ber\n\n•laughter, and Hope Lincoln. Surely this\n\nbright, childlike maiden cannot be the\n\n\"haughly heiress\" Paul Vane is schooling\n\nliiui-elf to treat politely! She reclines on\n\na low seat at Clara's feel, and ber bright\n\nbead, regardless of ilie dignified lady, who\n\nwas never known to permit such a thing,\n\nis laid upon her friend's knee. Curls of a\n\nrich golden biowu float over the glistening\n\nshoulders, and catch a new beauty from\n\nthe dress of blue satin which harmonizes\n\nso beautifully vrith thepure while complex-\n\nion. Ia the purple violet eyes there ling-\n\ners a dreamy light—she ia thinking now f\n\n\"brother\" whom Clara had been talking\n\nabout, that coble, brave brother wlio«,\n\nname was ever upon ber tip?. Hope sat\n\nsilent and still; the erimscm of the closing\n\nday lit up the young head with glory as she\n\nsat listening to the praises of Paul Vane.\n\nWell might Clara be proud of such\n\nbrother; his was a soul noble and lofty. —\n\nBeing eight yeArs the senior of Clara, he\n\nhad ever been a watchful friend and gentle\n\ncounsellor of the pet sister he had well-\n\nnigh worshiped. He was a close student,\n\nand a poet at heart. Some fancied him\n\nstern; though a shadow of sternness might\n\nlinger around the rich Hps when in repose,\n\nwhen he Smiled a rare sweetness radiated\n\nhis whole face. His dark and rather\n\nmournful-looking eyes were full of tender-\n\nness when mingling with those he loved,\n\nyet those same eyes could flash fire at a fit-\n\nting moment. Altogether, the character\n\nand appearance of Philip Vane arc hard to\n\ndescribe. I only knew, with others, that\n\nupon bis superb brow thought sat en-\n\nthroned—that brow whereon was written\n\nthe reconl of stirring and wayward intel\n\nlect. I used to think it would be a lifetime\n\nhappiness to be loved by such a man as\n\nPaul Vane. Excuse the slight digression,\n\nreader: indeed I could not help it.\n\nThe deep shadows of night were trailing\n\nover the lawn, almost hidinghis advancing\n\nfigure from I'lara's loving eyes, who, grown\n\nanxions at his long delay, had been watch-\n\ning from the window. The gas was lighted\n\n•r>- he presented himself before his mother\n\nand their guest. A cloud lowered upon the\n\nbrow of Sirs. Vane.\n\n••My son. you have tarried long to-\n\nnight.\"\n\n•■Yes, dear mother; but I am here at last,\n\nready to crave your pardon. Am I forgiv-\n\nen, mother?\"\n\nv The mother looked up with a smile to the\n\nbright, handsome f ce bent over her, for in\n\nher heart she worshiped her only son.\n\n\"Yes. Panl, if jou are more prompt in\n\nobeying my wishes next time, you are for-\n\ngiven now.\"\n\nPanl, thu delinquent, raised the still fair\n\nhano r verently to his lips, and pa«sed on\n\nt\" welcome Hupe Lincoln to Mossdale.\n\n-Hope, this is brother Paul,\" i-aid Clara.\n\n\"Ah. Paul, I am so happy >o be once\n\nfore with Clara, and so glad to see you.\n\nill you not be my brother, too?\" And the\n\nsweet lips were held up for a kiss.\n\nThe stately Paul was nonplused. In\n\ntruth, she was not .changed. Was this the\n\neod of hia resilvps to be distant? But be\n\nhad been more than mortal had he not\n\npressed with his own the dewy lips help up\n\nbefore him.\n\nThus passed the first evening. Paul\n\n•ought his pillow, and a close observer\n\ncould see sorrow in his deep eyes—sorrow\n\n> he had so soon forgoiten his'fixed re-\n\n- But he would commence anew to-\n\nrow; he would not have it said that his\n\n• invited the heiress to Mossdale that\n\nher sea might win her broad lands for his\n\n°wn—at least it should not be said with\n\ntruth. But some ir risible hand h*d surely\n\nlaid a spell on his pillow, for, despite rea-\n\nson, dreams wonld come of a beautiful girl\n\nin a blue satin dress, with luxuriant brown\n\ncurls, and a pair of ripe, tempting lips up-\n\nlifted to hi* own. What business had they\n\nthere at such a time?\n\nThus passed many weeks, Hope winding\n\nherself more cloeq)y round the heart of Paul\n\n?D® T*fk tnl he was wretched if he\n\nmissed for an hear the bright form which\n\nwas fast becoming the star of his idolatry.\n\nTel he strove to hide his feelings. \"Oh,\n\nif she were only poor,\" he would exclaim,\n\n\"how gladly would I gather her to my heart\n\nand cherish her as a woman never yet was\n\ncherished. Vat, after every such spell of\n\nmating, his manner would be fitful, at\n\ntimes almost cold; but the very artlessness\n\nsad childlike innocence of Hope made such\n\neoldaes, almost impossible. She knew so\n\nlittle of the world, aad had such a loving,\n\ntrustful natare that she witched him out of\n\nb'8 \"sdnewi, as she termed it, in spite of\n\nhimself. Oaceshe sought Clara, and, with\n\neyes filled with tears, told her that her\n\nmother was angry with her for something;\n\nhejtreated her so eoldly, and would not read\n\n\"each with her as he had promised. Cla-\n\nra soothed her with the words, \"You must\n\nnot &ncy brother cold, darling; his nature\n\nt® peculiar, aad when he is in a deep study,\n\nor woCTied about outdoor aSairs, he is ever\n\n*°' - - not knowing her brother's\n\nsecret feelings, really believed her own\n\nwords. So Hope was comforted; the smiles\n\nonce more brightened ber face, pjaying at\n\nhide and seek with the tiny dimples clus-\n\ntered about her wee mouth, each one of\n\nwhteh was a wealth of beauty in itself—\n\nAh, Pf l panoply yourself round\n\nabout with pride, and absent yourself from\n\nthe charmed presence, yet you oanaot free\n\nyourself long from the restless liulo friry\n\nwho, all unconscious of her feelings, is f ,t\n\nleaning to love. Hope took a book, and\n\nwas son lost far its pages, for, thoiuh\n\nchildish in hp- manner, she had an intense\n\nappreciation of the beautiAtl, aad a thirst\n\nfor knowledge. A superior mind could\n\nlead her to any height he willed; could\n\nform her mind after the fashion of his own.\n\nPaul Vane, though not yet nine and\n\ntwenty, was a elose reader of character.—\n\nNow a new fear presented itself; though\n\nnot a vain man, he yet read tbe heart of\n\nHope, and understood her feelings better\n\nthan rhe did herself—knew that in her\n\nyoung heart—all nnrevealed to herself—\n\nwas a dawning love for him. And know-\n\ning this, he yet most turn away from this\n\nheaven of bliss; and coldly chill the young\n\nlove that needed but love in retnrn to bring\n\nto fruition. 'Twas a weary battle, and had\n\nto be fought again and again. But the mys-\n\ntic hour was dawning which was to awaken\n\nHope's soul to the knowledge that she loved\n\nPaul Vane.\n\nClara Vane was betrothed to a young\n\nclergyman residing in a neighboring city.\n\nIt was whilst he was on a visit to\n\nMossdale that Hope first learned the se-\n\ncret of her own-soul, awoke to the knowl-\n\neege that the \" thousand harp-strings of\n\nher soul\" conld vibrate but to one name.\n\nAfter the knowledge came upon her, she\n\ntroubled brother, as she was wont to call\n\nhim, no more. As woman ever does who\n\nloves unsought, she would shun him, flying\n\nif she heard his footsteps It happened in\n\nthis wise: One evening Mrs. Vane had been\n\nremonstrating with her son regarding his\n\ntreatment of Hope; an intimate friend had\n\nbantered him as to when he and the heiress\n\nwould be made one; the two chafed him\n\nsadly; the consequence was that when he\n\nnext saw Hope, he endeavored to treat her\n\nmore coldlv than usual.\n\nHe was sitting in his study, buried in\n\nbitter thoughts; he had almost made up his\n\nmind to travel for a year, in order to weak-\n\nen, if he could not break, the tie that bound\n\nhim to Hope; he must not stay to bring\n\nsorrow to her young heart. 'Twas a lovely\n\nnight; the air seemed filled with music; the\n\nair was heavy with the fragrance of flowers,\n\nbut they gave no pleasure to the sorrowing\n\nman; the musical plash of the fountain be-\n\nneath his window fell unheeded upon his\n\near; the water and trees, and the birds of\n\nthe night were together singing a rounde-\n\nlay; the moon, calm and gentle as she ever\n\nis, looked down pityingly upon a noble\n\nheart, whose spirit conflict had been fought\n\nbeneath her rays. It was over, and Paul\n\nVane came out as pure gold from the bap-\n\ntism of sorrow that had bathed his brow\n\nwith a clammy sweat. As he gazed upon\n\nthe starry night, and watched the clouds\n\nscudding like a ship over the blue waters,\n\nfrom hi3 tried heart arose a prayer that the\n\nFather would bless and keep from sorrow\n\nhis loved one, his first and only love Ere\n\nthe prayer had died upon his lips, the door\n\nopened, and Hope stood before him. The\n\nstudv was at all times open to Clara and\n\nHope; therefore Hope felt no hesitation in\n\nentering.\n\n\"Clara has gone to walk with Mr Erls\n\nwood, and I am lonely, and have come to\n\nbeg you to read to me. Why, my brother,\n\nyou have no light to night. It may be the\n\nlady moon gives you light to read.\" And\n\ngoing to the window, she looked into his\n\nface. The deep sadness imprinted there\n\nappalled her. \"Paul, what grieves you?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Hope; nothing.\"\n\nThe sad tones brought tears to her eyes,\n\nand sitting down upon the low seat ar. his\n\nside, she wept.\n\n\"What is it, Hope? Who is grieving\n\nnow?\"\n\n•'Ah, my brother, you are changed to-\n\nwards me; you do not talk to me, or read to\n\nme, and you never sing with me now, and\n\nClara, too, forgets me for whole days.\"—\n\nAnd the bowed head was laid upon bis\n\nknee, and Hope sobbed like a grieved\n\nchild!\n\nPaul's face grew pale and bis lips quiv\n\nered: he uttered no words, but he bent his\n\nbright, handsome head reverently over her\n\ntill his own hair almost touched the golaen\n\nbrown curls belonged to press passionately\n\nto his lips. \"I am not changed, little sis-\n\nter, but I am ill and suffering to-night,\n\nand Hope, I am going away next week, to\n\nhe absent a year. Leave me now, darling,\n\nI will tell you all to-morrow.\" And, pass-\n\ning bis arm around her, he lifted her up,\n\nand, pressing a kiss upon her white, pol-\n\nished brow, said \"Good night.\"\n\nHope sought her own room, and flung\n\nlnrself upon her knees, striving with the\n\nagony surging through her heart, for in\n\nthis hour came upon her the knowledge\n\nthat she loved Paul Vane with a deep and\n\nidolatrous love. Now he wits going away,\n\nand the earth would be 'Inrkened for ever-\n\nmore. Thus blindly do we go on making\n\nourselves idol?, and God pity theheart that\n\nwakes to the swt knowledge too lair, or\n\nwhen Ibe bitier thought will come that the\n\nheart's deep W*e has been lavished un-\n\nsought*\n\nNext day, Hope was pale and quiet; she\n\nkept closely within her own chamber, ner\n\ner once seeking Paul's society. In this\n\nway passed raaay days. Paul missed the\n\nsweet lortn flitting hither and thiiher, and\n\nat last bislonelinaes became insupportable.\n\n\"I will go mad,\" he moaned; \"I must have\n\nsympathy and advice I will seek Clara\n\nand tell ber all.\" He did so, and came\n\naway comforted. Clara, with her calm\n\ngood sense, told him that he sinned against\n\nhis own nature and against Hope in thus\n\nwarring with bis feelings. \"Had be a right\n\nto wreck his own happiness, and blight her\n\nsweet life ?\" she asked. \"What if Hope\n\nwas an heiress, should two hearts be stran-\n\nded npon a rock with shore in sight? It\n\nwas wrong, decidly wrong.\" So reasoned\n\ntbe wise Uttle philosopher, Clara.\n\nMeantime, poor Hope, the*lone)y orphan\n\nwept with grief and shame, wept with fear\n\nlest the secret of her love should have been\n\ndiscovered. She drew from under her pil-\n\nlow her mother's Bible, and 7*ad till her\n\nheatt was calmed. Sadly she thought of\n\nthe loved dead sleeping under the acacia\n\ntrees far away.\n\nPaul was absent all next day on business\n\nfor his mother. When he returned, Hope\n\nwas nowhere to be found; she had wand-\n\nered down to a secluded part of the lawn\n\nto weep alone. Blame her not, ye who\n\nhave rareots and friends; she was an or-\n\nphan, and now ber futnre looked so hope-\n\nless ; Clara wonld soon leave them to glad-\n\nden the home of her husband. Paul was\n\ngoing away ; and she would be left alooc\n\nwiih the cold and chilling Mrs. Vnpe.—\n\nWhat wonder, then, that the orphan wecp>?\n\nr ihat, in her childlike faith, she kneels\n\nbeneath the stars anil prays ? The holy\n\nmoonlight kissed lovingly the bowed bead,\n\nlighting it as with glory. 'Twas thus Paul\n\nVane found her, ami listened unseen to\n\nbe.- prayer for strength. A proud yet sweet\n\nsmile radiated bis face, and. stepping soft-\n\nly to her side, be raised her from tbe damp\n\nground. His words were brief: \"Hope,\n\ndarling, I love you, have loved you from\n\nthe first hour you came to dwell in my\n\nmother's house. Can you love me? Will\n\nyou be my wife ?\"\n\nAnd H'>pe—she was happy, 0 so happy!\n\nshe would be lonely never more on earth.\n\nAnd. 0 joy! Paul did not know that she\n\nbad loved him long ago. Had he noi ask-\n\ned her \"if she Could love him ?\" What a\n\nchange have these few word* brought\n\nabout! A little while ago, tbe wind sweep-\n\ning among tbe trees sounded like ibe sob-\n\nbing of a broken heart; a little while ago,\n\nthe dark lashes swept the pale cheek heav-\n\nily, as though fettered by tea™; now, tbe\n\neyes flashed back happiness and joy; the\n\nbeautiful head sank low, lower still, till it\n\nrested npon his heart, and Paul whispered:\n\n'Mine for evermore!\"\n\nUnder tbe golden glimmer of the selling\n\nsun stands sweet Hope Lincoln; she is\n\nwailing for ber lover, who has ridden over\n\nto the village. \"Ah, be is coming now: I\n\nsee him through the trees. Dear Paul! I\n\nshall await him here. 1 fancy he will join\n\ncaged now; but ah, how content in its\n\nglad captivity ! The earth seemed bright-\n\nening around her, the flowers that yester-\n\nday looked pale and sad whispered to-night\n\na new and loving language ere they folded\n\ntheir fraerance close within th> ir hearts,\n\nand said, \"Good-night.\" Ah, \"ihert* is\n\nnothing on earth half so sweet xs love's\n\nyoung dream !\n\nVALUABLE GIFTS\n\nWITH BOOKS\n\nGEORGE G.
