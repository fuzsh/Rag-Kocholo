        "text": "Now available as a print!\n\nHey, it's another infographic. Here's everything you've ever wanted to know about the Doctor, but were afraid to ask.\n\nOnce I'd finished drawing cartoon renditions of all eleven Doctors, I was trying to think of something else I could do with them. Suddenly the idea of an infographic sprung to mind. Armed with my moderate knowledge of Who-lore and trivia, I started typing up relevant factoids and arranging the Doctors on the page. Obviously you'll have to view the original size to read most of it.\n\nI think this is the first time in my life I've ever drawn the TARDIS. It was surprisingly hard! It seems like it would be simple; after all it's just a blue box with some windows, but it was actually quite complicated, what with all of those little details and recessed panels and whatnot (and yes, it's been pointed out that I have the wrong number of window panes. I've fixed that on the revised version).\n\nThere's another Doctor Who infographic over here.\n\nThis piece took quite a while to finish. I worked on it a little at a time over several days. There was a lot of moving around of elements and much text editing to get everything to fit in an efficient manner. Hopefully there aren't too many glaring errors in the information.\n\nI've had the grid system drilled into my head since design school, and normally I'm a devoted disciple of it. This time I said nuts to grids and just sort of let the design happen organically. I kind of liked it. I may start ditching the grid more often.\n\nLaid out entirely in InDesign. All the Doctors were drawn in InDesign as well.\n\nUPDATE: My little infographic just passed 150,000 views!!! Thank Kew, Internet!!!\n\nUPDATE: Be sure and check out the REVISED AND UPDATED VERSION. All the mistakes that appear here have been corrected.\n\nThere's another infographic featuring the Doctor's enemies here.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nNow available as a print!\n\nMy previous Doctor Who infographic seemed to be a hit with folks on the interweb, so I thought I'd do another one, this time featuring classic enemies and monsters from the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nWhen I first started drawing vector illustrations of the Doctors I established a specific cartoony style for them and utilized it here as well. The formula is basically a giant nose, big elongated head, a tiny body about half the height of the noggin, then very long skinny legs. This style lends itself well to human and most humanoid characters, but for robots and other monsters, not so much.\n\nThe Dalek was particularly troublesome. How do you apply that \"head-body-legs\" formula to something that has none of those? If I didn't make it cartoony enough then it would look like a normal drawing of a Dalek; but if I distorted it too far then it would look like I don't know how to draw (I've noticed that people who attempt cute versions of Star Wars characters have the same problem when they try to draw R2-D2). I went through many versions of the Dalek before I found the right proportions. I made its head as big as possible, then enlarged the eye stalk to comical proportions and then shrunk the middle \"body\" portion (containing the plunger and gun). I originally elongated the \"skirt\" or leg portion, but that didn't look right, so I compressed it, and finally came up with a version I could live with.\n\nThe Yeti was the last monster I drew, and it absolutely kicked my ass; more so than even the Dalek. The Yeti on the show had a ridiculous pear shaped body that didn't lend itself well to my cartoony style. I had a lot of trouble with its head. I scoured the internet and reference books for photos of it, but couldn't find any with a good view of its face. After much searching I came to the conclusion that the reason I couldn't find a good photo of its face is because it didn't have one! There's just an area of black fur where its features ought to be (Note: I am aware that there was a second version of the Yeti with a more defined mouth and glowing eyes, but few people-- including myself-- have seen that version. I wanted to go with the more iconic and recognizable faceless version). I added a pair of eyes anyway because it just looked wrong without them. Artistic license and all that.\n\nI drew at least six versions of the Yeti, spending hours on each one before deleting them in frustration. Naturally the one that looked best is the last one I did, that I literally spent all of ten minutes drawing. Isn't that always the way? I'm still not 100% satisfied with the way it turned out. I'm blaming the source material.\n\nI thought the Robot K-1 would be tough, but it turned out to be one of the easier ones. I think the easiest and quickest to draw of them all was probably the Sea Devil. There've been many versions of the Cybermen since they first appeared, so I drew the version I like best.\n\nThe actual layout evolved over time, ending up looking quite different from the initial version as I rearranged the characters to best fit the space. The text went through a lot of changes as well. There's always way more info than space, so you have to decide how best to describe a character in as few words as possible.\n\nSpecial thanks to my pal across the pond, Ian Ledger, for providing reference photos and text corrections.\n\nDrawn and laid out entirely in InDesign.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nA few years ago I made a Doctor Who Team-Up Infographic. It was OK, but it didn't come out the way it looked in my head and I never really liked the design.\n\nSo I finally took the time to redesign it, and add the additional team-up episode that aired in 2013 (timely I know, but hey, I'm busy).\n\nObviously you'll have to view \"Original Size\" to read the text.\n\nEvery now and then the Doctor faces a situation that even he can't tackle alone. That's when he uses his TARDIS to go back in time and recruit his past selves for help. Think of it as your 30 year old self using a time machine to get your 20 year old self to help you move your couch.\n\nSo far most of my infographics have been 12\" x 18.\" I knew I'd never fit all this info into that size, so I decided not to worry about it, and just let the material dictate the height.\n\nFor non-fans of the show, those circular symbols in the background are Gallifreyan words.\n\nThere was a lot of moving around of elements and rewriting of text to get everything just right. I'm a lot happier with this version.\n\nAs fun as these team-up episodes are, historically there's always been some sort of problem with each one, making them less than perfect. For example, in The Three Doctors, actor William Hartnell (who played the First Doctor) was in poor health and was only able to interact with the other Doctors via a view screen, so it was really just two Doctors running around. Pity.\n\nThen in The Five Doctors, Hartnell had sadly passed away and was replaced by actor Richard Hurndall. He did a good job, but naturally it just wasn't the same. Tom Baker, who played the Fourth Doctor, declined to participate, and appears for only a few seconds through the magic of stock footage. Baker has recently said he regrets his decision.\n\nIn The Two Doctors, actor Patrick Troughton had aged visibly since his tenure on the series, and his hair had gone almost completely gray. This was distracting to say the least, since he was supposed to be the same age as the last time we saw him. This would have been such an easy fix— all they had to do was dye his hair black. Does hair dye not exist in England?\n\nThe Day Of The Doctor is marred by problems as well— namely the absence of the Ninth Doctor. In the episode, The Moment brings the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors back in time to show the War Doctor the massive guilt he'll experience if he destroys Gallifrey.\n\nBut Ten and Eleven don't seem all that guilt-ridden or damaged, seeing as how they spend a good amount of screen time joking around with one another. The Ninth Doctor was the one closest to the tragedy and the one who always had an air of sadness and tragedy about him. He'd have been a great example for The Moment to have used. So why wasn't he in the episode?\n\nUnfortunately actor Christopher Eccleston, who played the Ninth Doctor, has some sort of beef with the BBC and refuses to reprise the role. That's his business of course, but you'd think he could have set aside his differences for the sake of the fans. Story-wise it makes no sense for him to not be in the episode, and hurts it overall.\n\nI knew that show runner Stephen Moffat's plots were overly convoluted and needlessly complicated, but nowhere was that more evident than when I started writing up the synopsis for The Day Of The Doctor. I was able to distill the other episodes down to a few short paragraphs. It took many times that to try and explain Day, even after leaving out a ton of stuff.\n\nI kept whittling away at it and slashing elements until I got it down to a manageable size. You may notice that the Zygon subplot, that takes up a good amount of the run time, is barely mentioned in my synopsis. That's because I realized it's completely superfluous. It has absolutely nothing to do with the overall War Doctor plot line and could be edited out of the show completely without harming the episode one bit. Such are Stephen Moffat's scripts.\n\nHopefully there won't be any more team-ups for a while, so I won't have to update it again.\n\nThere have been several other team-ups in the various Doctor Who audio books, novels and comics, but I'm just listing the more well known televised ones.\n\nDrawn and designed all in InDesign.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nPart of my 100 Frankensteins Project! I'm up to number 10!\n\nHere are the files for my papercraft Frankenstein. You can see the finished product here.\n\nI didn't really have much of a plan when I started making this. I drew the front view of the Frankenstein monster in InDesign, then deconstructed him and added the sides and back pieces. I got kind of carried away on the size. I didn't realize how big he was until I started building him. He's almost 11\" tall! He looked a lot smaller on the monitor. I couldn't fit everything onto one sheet of paper, so I had to spread the parts out over two.\n\nI printed him out and built him to see if there were any problems with my layout. I was sure I'd need to make some tweaks. I was shocked when everything fit together fine on the first try!\n\nFeel free to download, print and build your own. You'll have to click \"View all sizes,\" and then click \"Original size\" in order to print him out at actual size. I was afraid it might be confusing to upload two separate files, so I put them both into one big image. Once you download them, you'll have to figure out how to print each half to a separate 8.5\" x 11\" sheet of paper. Warning: This file is a whopper!\n\nI recommend printing him on card stock if you have any. Use an X-Acto knife to cut out the pieces. Scissors are too bulky. It's your choice as to whether to use glue or tape to put him together. Ideally glue would look better, but I built mine with invisible tape and it looked just fine. I tried to put the seams or joins in the back as much as possible so that they wouldn't show from the front.\n\nI was afraid he wouldn't stand up by himself since he's so top heavy and has such skinny legs, but he stands up just fine.\n\nYou can see the first papercraft monster I did here.\n\nDesigned, drawn and laid out entirely in InDesign.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nI'm a big fan of Doctor Who, so I thought I'd start a series of vector drawings of all the various Doctors.\n\nTom Baker played the Fourth Doctor from 1974 to 1981, the longest tenure of any actor so far. With his bulging eyes, manic grin, curly mop of hair and trademark endless scarf, he's the Doctor best known to most Americans. Probably due to all those PBS fund-raiser marathons.\n\nTom Baker was the first Doctor I ever saw and he was my favorite until David Tennant (Doctor #10) came along. Sorry Tom!\n\nThe Fourth Doctor tended to avoid violence by distracting foes with his odd and eccentric behavior. He could be befuddled, aloof and somber all at once.\n\nHe also had many interesting companions, including fan favorite Sarah Jane Smith (who actually debuted in a Third Doctor episode), Leela (a futuristic alien cave woman), K-9 (his trusty robotic dog), and Romana, a fellow Time Lord (Time Lady?) from the Doctor's planet of Gallifrey. There were actually two different Romanas, as she regenerated into a new form after her first season!\n\nAccording to legend, the Fourth Doctor's ridiculously long scarf came about by accident. The BBC sent a box full of various yarns to a local seamstress to knit into a scarf. She supposedly got carried away and used ALL the yarn, resulting in a sixteen foot long scarf. The studio was about to cut it in half, but Baker reportedly saw it and liked it, and the rest is history.\n\nLike Jon Pertwee's Third Doctor, the Fourth Doctor didn't limit himself to just one outfit. He had at least four different costumes during his time on the series. I drew him in the one I like best.\n\nNear the end of Baker's run, the creators began incorporating question marks into the Doctor's attire (on his shirt collar), something I always found cringe-worthy. Doctor Who is the name of the show, not the character's name. He's always been known simply as \"The Doctor.\" Wearing a question mark as a nod to the show's title always seemed a little too cutesy to me, and every time I saw it it would yank me right out of the story.\n\nThe question mark tradition continued all the way to the Seventh Doctor (who carried an umbrella with a question mark-shaped handle). Fortunately the creators of the revived series have seen the light, and Doctors Eight through Eleven have thankfully been question mark free.\n\nDoctor #4 is a vector drawing, drawn all in InDesign. Toward the end I was cursing that frakin' scarf and all its stripes. I did my best to make the stripes screen accurate, but I had to fudge a little to get them all to fit. That's a bag of the Doctor's trademark \"jelly babies\" that he's holding.\n\nPlease forgive the ugly watermark on the illustration. I swore I would never add one to my art, because I know that 99.99% of my readers would never even think of stealing it. But earlier this year I had a run-in with an art thief who was not only stealing my work, but selling it as her own! Hence the watermarks. This is why we can't have nice things.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nLook, up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman! And he's wearing proper proper red trunks like he's supposed to!\n\nThis illustration had a long and tortuous journey from my mind to the screen. I first sketched it out about four or five years ago, then stuck it in a folder and promptly forgot about it. With this year being the 75th Anniversary of Superman and the new movie coming out, I remembered it and decided to finally finish it.\n\nOriginally it was going to be a drawing of a generic superhero. He was wearing a red suit with a yellow cape and trunks. I hated that color combo though and went through dozens of others without success. Finally I decided I was working so hard to not make him look like Superman that it would be far easier to just give in and go for it. So now he's Superman.\n\nI tried to draw and paint more loosely here than usual and let the brush strokes show. For some reason that's a big struggle for me-- I like everything to be tight and precise. I still don't think it's loose enough. I need to keep at it.\n\nLastly I meant for it to appear as if the viewer is on the ground looking up as Superman flies overhead. Hopefully it reads that way and doesn't look like a side view.\n\nI tried some different lighting effects in this illustration as I wanted it to look as if he was being lit from behind. I especially wanted to make it look like the sun was filtering through his red cape. I had no idea how to go about that though, so I did something rare for me-- I took some reference photos. I actually went outside on a sunny day and shot some photos of a Superman action figure to see how his cape looked in the sun.\n\nIt came out OK, but it's still not perfect. I can live with it for now though.\n\nSuperman was drawn in Photoshop on the graphic tablet.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nI'm a big fan of Doctor Who, and a while back I started a series of vector drawings of all the various Doctors. Here's my version of the War Doctor, from the 50th Anniversary Special The Day Of The Doctor.\n\nThe War Doctor (played by John Hurt) is a previously unknown and unmentioned incarnation of the Doctor. He fought in the Last Great Time War, a conflict between his own people the Time Lords and the evil Daleks.\n\nAs the Time War dragged on, it threatened to destroy the entire universe. The War Doctor realized that the only way to end the War once and for all was by using a super weapon called The Moment. Unfortunately this would result in the utter annihilation of both sides. In essence the only way to save the universe was by destroying his own people.\n\nUltimately the War Doctor used The Moment and ended the War. Wracked with guilt, he was now the last of his people. This caused him to bury this particular incarnation of himself deep within his psyche, never to be spoken of again.\n\nI know, I know, there's more to this convoluted story (a lot more), but that'll do for now.\n\nI have to admit I wasn't crazy about the whole \"Hidden Doctor That's Never Been Spoken Of\" thing. It just seemed like a cheat to me, shoehorning him into the show's past history like that. I'm slowing warming to the idea though.\n\nLet's just hope this is the first and only hidden Doctor and we don't get dozens more crawling out of the woodwork.\n\nIt would have been nice if all three of the modern Doctors (the Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh) could have teamed up for the 50th Anniversary Special, but unfortunately it wasn't to be. Christopher Eccleston, the Ninth Doctor, refused to appear.\n\nHe's got his own reasons of course (citing irreconcilable differences with the BBC management), but it would have been nice if he'd been able to set them aside for the fans. Ah well.\n\nI'm convinced that the War Doctor was created to take the place of the Ninth Doctor. I wish they'd have used Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor instead. Even though he only appeared once (in the Fox TV movie), the Eighth Doctor is a fan favorite and McGann still looks young enough to pull off the part. So why didn't they just use him in the 50th Anniversary Special instead of coming up with a new character? You'll have to ask the BBC about that one.\n\nThey did bring back McGann as the Eighth Doctor in a special mini-episode called The Night Of The Doctor that aired before the Special. So he was available, and they were cool with using him in some capacity. So again, why create a brand new character? I don't get it.\n\nAs for the drawing, the War Doctor has quite a complicated outfit that I simplified quite a bit. My first instinct of course is to reproduce every tiny detail and texture, so I had to keep reigning myself in and leave things out.\n\nHe also needed to match the earlier Doctor drawings I did several years ago, back when I wasn't as experienced in working with vector. I like to think I've improved since then.\n\nI'm not a great caricaturist, and sometimes I have trouble capturing a likeness. I think this one came out pretty well though, if I do say so myself. I'm betting it's because of John Hurt's craggy, hangdog features. Generally speaking, older, wrinkled faces are easier to draw than young, smooth ones.\n\nThe War Doctor has a new sonic screwdriver (so the BBC can sell more toys), which he's holding here. I'm happy with the way it came out.\n\nThe War Doctor is a vector illustration, drawn all in InDesign. Yep, InDesign.\n\nPlease forgive the ugly watermark on the illustration. I swore I would never add one to my art, because I know that 99.99% of my readers would never even think of stealing it. But earlier this year I had a run-in with an art thief who was not only stealing my work, but selling it as her own! Hence the watermarks. This is why we can't have nice things.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nHere's my recreation of the Mr. Spock model kit box art. Yeah, this is the third Spock drawing in a row. I guess I'm in Spock mode due to Leonard Nimoy's death earlier this year.\n\nThe Spock model kit was originally released internationally by Aurora in 1972, and was sold in the U.S. by AMT in 1973. It's been rereleased many, many times over the years. I remember buying all the other Star Trek kits as a kid— the Enterprise, the Shuttlecraft, the Klingon Battle Cruiser, and the Romulan Bird Of Prey— but for some reason I never got the Spock kit. I guess I was more interested in the ships than the characters.\n\nEven though I didn't own the kit, I was always fascinated by the box art, so I thought I'd try to recreate it here.\n\nAs for the illustration, it took forever! Way longer than I expected. I was trying to be more painterly than I usually am, to match the style of the box art. I bet I spent a lot longer on it that the artist who originally painted it— they probably had to knock it out in a day or two!\n\nThe background in particular was problematic and took a long time to draw, as you might expect. It's pretty complicated, and every time I thought I was done I'd spot something I forgot to add. I finally had to push myself away from the computer and say \"no more,\" or I'd still be picking away at it come Xmas.\n\nThis illustration was drawn in Photoshop of course, on a ton of layers— 54 of them to be exact. That's a lot, but still not a personal record.\n\nYou may notice that Spock's not holding the usual phaser and communicator that we all know and love here. That's because I drew them as they are on the box. I agonized over that for a while. Should I draw him holding the actual props from the show, or the inaccurate versions that are seen on the box? In the end I decided that since I was trying to recreate the box art, I might as well stick with what's on it.\n\nI had to do some jostling and repositioning of the various elements to get it to all fit together, since my cartoony Spock and three headed snake have very different proportions than the originals.\n\nI always wondered about Spock so aggressively shooting the snake in this artwork. In the TV series he was always the voice of logic and reason; a man of science who was fascinated by alien life. Here he's shootin' first and not even bothering with the questions later. Maybe he just doesn't like snakes.\n\nHere's an image of the original box art for comparison.\n\nYou can also see a step-by-step look at the illustration here.\n\nDrawn in Photoshop with the graphic tablet.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nI'm a big fan of Doctor Who, so I thought I'd start a series of vector drawings of all the various Doctors.\n\nJon Pertwee played the Doctor from 1970 to 1974. His episodes were the first to be broadcast in color. The Master, the Doctor's evil Time Lord nemesis, made his first appearance in a Pertwee episode.\n\nThe previous Doctors always wore pretty much the same thing, but the Third Doctor was quite a clothes horse. He favored tuxedos, opera capes, frilly shirts and velvet blazers (in some pretty eye-searing 1970s colors). I drew him in the outfit I like best.\n\nPertwee's Doctor was a bit more active than the previous two. He wasn't afraid to defend himself or even attack a foe, and was schooled in the art of Venusian Aikido.\n\nThe Third Doctor relied more on gadgets than the others. He drove a Whomobile (sort of a hovercraft that looked like a flying car, which incidentally was never actually called the Whomobile on air) for a time, and later a vintage roadster he nicknamed \"Bessie.\"\n\nThe Third Doctor was put on trial by his fellow Time Lords and exiled to Earth for a season or two. This helped the ever-frugal BBC save money by not having to build a new alien planet set each week.\n\nHe's also known for the catchphrase, \"Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow,\" but what's odd is that it wasn't uttered nearly as much as people think. According to some sources, he only said it on air twice! I'm not sure how that line became so identified with him.\n\nThe Third Doctor was also the first to team up with his previous incarnations, something the show's done several times over the years. When faced with a threat he couldn't handle alone, the Third Doctor used the Tardis to go back in time and pick up his previous two incarnations to help him out. A cool idea, and a fun way to see the previous Doctors in action again.\n\nDoctor #3 is a vector drawing, drawn all in InDesign. I'm having a lot of fun working in this simpler vector style.\n\nPlease forgive the ugly watermark on the illustration. I swore I would never add one to my art, because I know that 99.99% of my readers would never even think of stealing it. But earlier this year I had a run-in with an art thief who was not only stealing my work, but selling it as her own! Hence the watermarks. This is why we can't have nice things.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nI'm a big fan of Doctor Who, so I thought I'd start a series of vector drawings of the eleven (!) different Doctors (so far).\n\nDavid Tennant played the Tenth Doctor from 2005 to 2010. He starred in three seasons and eight specials, including three Christmas episodes. The Christmas specials are some of my favorite Who episodes ever, and are more like movies than TV shows-- they could have been shown theatrically, in my opinion.\n\nTennant was my absolute favorite Doctor, hands down, beating out even Tom Baker (sorry, Tom). Tennant reportedly decided he wanted to become an actor while watching Doctor Who as a child. In fact, while attending Paisley Grammar School he wrote an essay on how his greatest desire was to some day play the Doctor on TV!\n\nTennant's Doctor was sort of a cool yet geeky college professor. He could be funny, sentimental and terrifying all in the same episode. It was a sad day when he announced he was leaving the series; I was honestly depressed about it for a week. That's the nature of Doctor Who though. If you don't like change, then this isn't the show for you. Fortunately Matt Smith, the Eleventh Doctor, has done an incredible job and won me over after just one episode.\n\nUnlike previous incarnations of the Doctor who had platonic relationships with his companions, #10 was most definitely in love with Rose Tyler and never quite got over her after she left the series.\n\nMany of the Doctor's former friends and companions returned during #10's era, including Sarah Jane Smith, and the robotic dog K-9. He even had a run-in with the Fifth Doctor in the special Time Crash mini-episode.\n\nSpeaking of the Fifth Doctor (played by Peter Davison), Tennant is dating actress Georgia Moffett, Davison's daughter. Moffett also starred in the episode The Doctor's Daughter as, what else, the cloned daughter of the Tenth Doctor! Confused yet?\n\nMany of his old foes returned to plague him as well, including Davros, creator of the Dalek race, and his eternal nemesis (and fellow Time Lord) the Master. The Sontarans also returned to battle the Tenth Doctor.\n\nThe Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver continued to gain new abilities and functions in just about every episode. The versatility of the Sonic has become something of a running joke in the series.\n\nDoctor #10 had two main outfits, a blue pin-striped suit and a brown pin-striped one. His main trademark were his Chuck Taylor tennis shoes (or \"trainers,\" as they're known to the Brits). He almost always wore a brown top coat as well. On a couple of occasions he traded in his pin-striped suit for a black tuxedo. He would also occasionally wear glasses.\n\nThe Tenth Doctor continued the new series' tradition of utilizing the city of Cardiff, Wales, as a sort of home base. Many episodes of the new series have taken place in or around there. Coincidentally, the series is filmed at one of the BBC's studios in Cardiff. Imagine that!\n\nDoctor #10 is a vector drawing, drawn all in InDesign.\n\nPlease forgive the ugly watermark on the illustration. I swore I would never add one to my art, because I know that 99.99% of my readers would never even think of stealing it.

The new series has been going strong now for five seasons and is a huge hit in England, consistently receiving high ratings and generating tons of merchandise.\n\nThe SyFy Channel aired the first four seasons here in the States, but opted not to carry it after that. I guess they needed the precious air time for wrestling and shows about men pretending to see ghosts.\n\nThe new series finally has a budget that allows them to depict decent looking aliens and other planets. Don’t get me wrong, the old series had its charm, what with its cardboard sets and paper mache monsters, but it’s nice to see the show get the budget it deserves.\n\nWhen the BBC first announced the show was coming back, fans wondered if the Doctor would be the same one from the old series, or if the show would be getting a reboot. After all, it would be tough to attract a new audience to a show with a 40+ year history, what with all that continuity and baggage.\n\nIn the end the producers decided not to go the reboot route, and #9 is the same Doctor we’ve known and loved for years.\n\nThe way they brought the series back was nothing short of genius, in my opinion. Since we last saw the Doctor in the TV movie in 1996, his home planet of Gallifrey has been destroyed under mysterious circumstances (which have since been partially explained) and the Doctor is now the Last Of The Time Lords, wandering time and space alone.\n\nThis very cleverly leveled the playing field for everyone. Fans who knew the continuity inside and out were as much in the dark about the Doctor's situation as new viewers. It was the perfect way to start the show up again.\n\nUnlike the old series, which would stretch out a story over 4 or 6 half hour episodes, the new series features one story per hour long episode (with the occasional two parter).\n\nI really liked Eccleston’s performance as the Doctor. He was moody, melancholy and guilt ridden (no doubt due to losing his home planet) and was obviously in need of someone like his new companion Rose Tyler to give his life meaning again. Too bad he only stuck around for one season (or “series” to the Brits).\n\nThis Doctor wasn't afraid to use force, often utilizing weapons of the era in which he found himself.\n\nUnlike any previous incarnations, Doctor #9 spoke with a distinct Northern English accent. Rose Tyler asked the Doctor, \"If you're an alien, why do you sound like you're from the North?\" He replied, \"Lots of planets have a North.\"\n\nThe Ninth Doctor’s costume was the simplest and most modern to date. In the past the various Doctors have all worn out-of-time faux Victorian era clothing; waistcoats, opera capes and scarves. This Doctor wore a plain t-shirt, pants and a leather jacket. For the first time he was actually wearing clothing that more or less fit the times. His costume remained unchanged during his series, with the exception of an occasional change of t-shirt color. Best of all, there were no question marks to be seen on his clothing (something that bothered me greatly about past Doctors)!\n\nMuch like the Eighth Doctor, the Ninth Doctor's TARDIS interior was a large steampunk kind of cavern, much more impressive than the original series' dinky interior. The Doctor mentioned more than once that the TARDIS was not just a machine but alive, which was backed up by the incessant breathing sound in the background of the control room.\n\nThe Doctor's sonic screwdriver finally made its triumphant return in the new series, something we hadn't seen much since the Fifth Doctor's era.\n\nThe sonic screwdriver was originally just that-- a high tech tool that supposedly used sound to loosen screws and open locked doors. As time went on, the Doctor began relying more and more on it until the producers of the original series thought it was being used as a crutch, so they began to downplay it sometime during Doctor #5's era.\n\nThe sonic returned with a vengeance in the Ninth Doctor's adventures. It's now more versatile than ever, seemingly gaining new abilities every episode. No longer does it merely open locks, now it can be used to gain access to computers, reprogram cell phones so they can call into the past, even remotely control the TARDIS. At times it seems more like magic than technology.\n\nThe Ninth Doctor was the first to use \"psychic paper,\" a substance that would display whatever a subject thought he should see on it. If a guard would ask him for his pass, he'd show him the blank sheet of psychic paper, and the guard would see the appropriate credentials displayed on it, and allow the Doctor to pass. That would come in handy here in the real world.\n\nMany important characters debuted in the Ninth Doctor's series, including his new companion Rose Tyler, her ex-boyfriend Mickey Smith, and former Time Agent and now immortal Captain Jack Harkness (who would go on to star in the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood).\n\nSeveral old foes returned to plague the Ninth Doctor, including the Autons (which were animated store mannequins) and his most famous nemesis, the Daleks.\n\nThe Ninth Doctor began the new series' tradition of utilizing the city of Cardiff, Wales, as a sort of home base. Many episodes of the new series have taken place in or around there. Coincidentally, the series is filmed at one of the BBC's studios in Cardiff. Imagine that!\n\nDoctor #9 is a vector drawing, drawn all in InDesign. This was probably one of the easiest likenesses I've done so far. I sketched him from memory, and then when I looked up reference photos, I decided trying to match the reality would just muddy things up. The Ninth Doctor usually looked pretty mopey, but I opted for one of his rare smiles here instead.\n\nIt was tough trying to color his outfit. How do you color a jacket and pants that are both black without it looking like a solid blob? So I ended up having to cheat a bit and add some grays. Don't judge me! ;^)\n\nPlease forgive the ugly watermark on the illustration. I swore I would never add one to my art, because I know that 99.99% of my readers would never even think of stealing it. But earlier this year I had a run-in with an art thief who was not only stealing my work, but selling it as her own! Hence the watermarks. This is why we can't have nice things.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nI'm a big fan of Doctor Who, so I thought I'd start a series of vector drawings of all the various Doctors.\n\nMatt Smith began portraying the Doctor in 2010, and at age 27 is the youngest actor to ever play the role.\n\nMy, oh my, the Doctor seems to be getting younger with every regeneration, doesn't he? The First Doctor looked like an old man, and each successive incarnation has appeared younger than the next (more or less). I'm assuming this is because the Doctor is a physically demanding role, what with all that running up and down corridors, and it might be a strain on an older actor (as turned out to be the case with the First Doctor).\n\nWhen David Tennant, the Tenth Doctor, first announced he was leaving the show, I was honestly depressed for at least a week. Doctor Who is one of the very few shows I still watch on TV, and Tennant was hands down my all time favorite Doctor. I couldn't imagine how anyone could possibly replace him, and his announcement caused me to lose my enthusiasm for the show.\n\nBut if you don't like change, then Doctor Who is not the show for you. Every few years it reinvents itself and changes pretty much everything, including the Doctor himself. I can't think of any other TV show that's had eleven different actors play the title role.\n\nI needn't have worried though. By the end of Matt Smith's first episode I'd totally accepted him as the Doctor and barely missed Tennant at all.\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor wears a tweed jacket, bowtie and suspenders, and rolled up trousers and boots, appearing somewhat like a hipster college professor. According to an interview with Matt Smith, the original costume concept was a pirate-like monstrosity, similar to something Captain Jack Sparrow would wear in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Yikes.\n\nSo far Doctor #11 seems a bit more of a comedian than past incarnations, and hasn't plunged into the melancholy funks so often indulged in by the Ninth and Tenth Doctors. I hope that's a trend that lasts.\n\nThe Doctor also gained a new companion in Amy Pond. Amy's a fun new companion, and I hope she sticks around for a few more seasons. The Doctor first meets her moments after his regeneration, when Amy is a young girl. He jumps back into his TARDIS for a quick errand, and when he returns, he finds that while only a few minutes have passed for him, years have passed for Amy, who's now an adult.\n\nAmy's fiance, Rory Williams, accompanies her and the Doctor on a couple of adventures and eventually becomes a full-fledged companion. Poor Rory really got put through the ringer in his first season. He's killed by a Silurian warrior and wiped out of existence, he's reborn as an Auton (a robotic lifeform), he accidentally kills Amy and then spends a thousand years guarding her body until she heals inside the Pandorica. Eventually Rory's restored to normal when the Doctor sacrifices himself to reset the timeline, and Amy and Rory are married at last.\n\nI do like that the Doctor and Rory appear to have become pals. Past incarnations of the Doctor have been dismissive or downright hostile to the male friends of his female companions (Mickey Smith, for example), so it's nice to see his \"bromance\" with Rory.\n\nRiver Song also makes a return appearance to complicate the Doctor's life. She's sort of a futuristic cat burglar from the Doctor's future. She even throws out a few hints that they were once a couple, something that hasn't yet happened from the Doctor's point of view. River's true nature and agenda remain a mystery. Alex Kingston plays River, and adds a bit of sultriness to the show.\n\nNot only did the Doctor regenerate at the beginning of the season, but so did the TARDIS, inside and out. It changes its outside appearance slightly, and radically reconfigures its control room. Once it's done, the Eleventh Doctor stands before it and says, \"What have you got for me this time?\" This confirms the notion that the TARDIS is alive and not just a machine and has a measure of sentience, something fans have suspected for years. It also explains why the Doctor seems to always show up at crucial moments in various planet's histories.\n\nIn the old series, the Doctor was rarely able to control where the TARDIS was going, traveling randomly through time and space. In the new series, however, the Doctor seemed to have nearly complete control. The Eleventh Doctor's TARDIS-flying skills seems to be slipping a bit, as several times in the series he takes trips that seem like minutes to him, but years to the people he left behind.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Eleventh Doctor is fond of bowties, telling anyone within earshot that, \"Bowties are cool.\" He also briefly wears large red fez, declaring, \"I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool.\" Unfortunately the fez doesn't survive long, as Amy and River savagely destroy it.\n\nIn addition to a new Doctor, new companions and new TARDIS, there were more changes this season: the Doctor got a newly redesigned sonic screwdriver, there were new Dalek designs and even a new opening theme song (well, same song, different arrangement).\n\nI really liked the TARDIS interior during the Ninth and Tenth Doctors' tenure. It was a large, dome-like alien-Victorian looking cavern. I can't say I'm a fan of this new interior though. It's a neon and sheet metal monstrosity that seems to be a random collection of shapes and angles. No matter how long I stare at photos of the new interior, my eyes just can't make any sense out of it. Maybe it'll grow on me in time.\n\nI also wasn't a fan of the new Dalek design either at first. Then I bought some of the action figures and once I had a chance to hold them and look at the design from all angles, I've come to accept them.\n\nDoctor #11 is a vector drawing, drawn all in InDesign. You can see a special bonus drawing of the Eleventh Doctor over at my blog.\n\nPlease forgive the ugly watermark on the illustration. I swore I would never add one to my art, because I know that 99.99% of my readers would never even think of stealing it. But earlier this year I had a run-in with an art thief who was not only stealing my work, but selling it as her own! Hence the watermarks. This is why we can't have nice things.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nDon't let their doughy, middle-aged appearance fool you. The LAST thing you want is a squadron of Flarparian Shock Troopers overrunning your planet.\n\nI wonder if anyone's ever written a story like that? A story about a race of brutal, bloodthirsty soldiers, but they look as unintimidating as possible to everyone else in the galaxy, and thus are never taken seriously. That'd make an interesting story, right? Wait, that's really similar to the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi.. Never mind. Forget I brought it up.\n\nI'm sort of breaking my personal rule about futuristic dates here. I believe that you should always have your futuristic sci-fi stories take place well after the present audience will be dead. That way you won't look stupid (to anyone currently living) when your predictions don't come to pass.\n\nFor example, in the Star Trek episode Space Seed we learn that the genetic superman Khan was overthrown, placed aboard a sleeper ship and exiled from Earth in the year 1996. I'm sure that when the episode was made in 1966, the writer thought the 90s seemed impossibly far away, but even as a kid watching the show I knew that nothing like that was ever going to happen by then.\n\nSame goes for Space:1999. It was set on a moonbase full of advanced technology that we still don't have. What was the point of setting the series so close to the present? Would it have killed them to have called it Space: 2199?\n\nAs always, this drawing took a lot longer than I expected. Part of that was due to my schedule, of course. The aliens were drawn and colored pretty quickly, but I spent a lot of time futzing around with the background, trying to make it detailed without being too complex and distracting.\n\nDrawn in Photoshop on the graphic tablet.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nHere's what all my recent Cyberman posts were leading up to: a poster depicting every version (so far) of Doctor Who's Cybermen.\n\nObviously you'll have to zoom in to read the text.\n\nI drew my first Cyberman back when I did my Doctor Who Enemies Infographic (which was the version from The Invasion). A bit later I drew the Earthshock version. That's when I decided to go ahead and draw every variation of Cyberman there's been so far.\n\nI didn't know it at the time but after I started researching them I found out there were a whopping EIGHTEEN different versions of Cybermen! If I'd known that before I started I would have probably said forget it!\n\nI'm reasonably confident that I drew every major Cyberman variation that has appeared on the show; hopefully I didn't miss any. If I did, I don't know that I'll go back and correct it. I've spent the past two or three weeks squinting at reference photos trying to figure out if a white line was a piece of tubing or a fold in a silver jumpsuit. I'm a little Cybermanned out.\n\nActually drawing this wasn't as bad as it probably looks. Because it's a vector drawing, I could easily reuse parts and pieces. I'd draw a right arm, then clone and flop it for a left arm. Same with the legs and the \"handlebars\" on their heads. And drawing Cyberleaders was pretty easy-- just draw a regular Cyberman, clone him, color his handlebars black, and there you go! Instant Cyberleader.\n\nAt first I was trying to make this a standard poster size, like 12\" x 18\" or 24\" x 36\", but try as I might I just couldn't squeeze everyone into those sizes (without shrinking them into oblivion). I finally said \"who cares\" and just let the art dictate the size. If I ever decide to have it printed I'll figure something out then.\n\nBy the way, if you're scratching your head trying to figure out what's different about the last two Cybermen in the bottom row, it's the chest plate. The first three Cybermen in the bottom row all have a stylized letter \"C\" on their chests (which stands for Cybus Industries, not Cybermen). They come from a parallel Earth in another dimension. The last two Cybermen don't have the \"C\" because they originated from our own dimension.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing how I draw these vector characters, I posted a How To Draw A Cybermen In 42 Easy Steps feature over on my blog.\n\nThis is a vector drawing, done all in InDesign.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nHey, it's another Doctor Who infographic!\n\nThis time instead of showcasing the various Doctors or his enemies I decided to focus on one particular episode: Pyramids of Mars. I'll probably do more episode specific infographics as time permits. There've been over 200 stories so far (consisting of more than 770 episodes), so that ought to keep me busy for a while.\n\nObviously you'll have to click \"View All Sizes: Original\" to read the text. Hopefully everyone will figure out how to read it; start at the upper left and follow the arrows.\n\nPyramids of Mars is one of my all-time favorites. It was the third episode of the 13th season, and Tom Baker's second year of playing the Doctor. It's got everything a classic episode needs: a historical setting, a gothic mansion, an evil enemy and of course, monsters.\n\nThe Mummy designs are certainly... unusual, what with their dome-like heads and protruding chest plates. The special effects still hold up reasonably well, especially for a nearly 40 year old show. Some of them are still quite effective, particularly the smoking footsteps of Sutekh's agent, and Professor Scarman's shotgun wound healing.\n\nTom Baker is absolutely firing on all cylinders here. This is also where we get his famous \"I'm a Time Lord. I walk in eternity\" speech. Elisabeth Sladen was never more radiant as Sarah Jane Smith than here. Sarah Jane was saddled with some truly regrettable outfits in the 1970s, but thankfully here she's wearing a flattering and subdued period costume. And who knew Sarah Jane could handle a rifle so skillfully!\n\nBernard Archard is wonderfully creepy as the reanimated Professor Scarman. Michael Sheard is suitably befuddled as Laurence Scarman. George Lucas must have been a fan of Sheard, as he also played Admiral Ozzel in The Empire Strikes Back, as well as the U-Boat Captain in Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Hitler in Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade. Oddly enough Sheard has played Hitler in three other films! Quite a departure from the meek and bewildered Laurence Scarman.\n\nSadly there just wasn't room to include all the characters. I had to leave out Dr. Warlock, Collins the Butler and Ernie Clements, the poacher. They really didn't figure prominently in the plot anyway. I desperately wanted to include Sutekh's \"jackal headed\" appearance but couldn't find a way to do so. I tried to include all the major details and plot points, but some items had to go by the wayside for space purposes. Think of this as the Cliff Notes version of Pyramids of Mars.\n\nThe exterior shots of the Scarman mansion were filmed at a home owned by none other than Mick Jagger. For the scenes at the end where the mansion is on fire, they filmed a large cardboard cutout of the building behind a wall of flames.\n\nPyramids of Mars is a pretty violent episode; every single character (save the Doctor and Sarah Jane, of course) dies by the end! It features the world's first (and probably only) \"Death by Mummy Chest\" scene as Ernie Clements is killed by two Robot Mummies who crush his windpipe between their sharp, protruding chest pieces.\n\nEven classic episodes have a few hiccups though, and this one is no exception. Sutekh the Destroyer is so dangerous that the Osirans seal him inside a pyramid on Earth and hide the key under the mat on Mars. But Professor Scarman opens Sutekh's tomb in about five seconds with little more than a small crowbar. Seems like there should have been some tighter security. Inside the tomb, Sutekh has what appears to be a wide screen high def TV, with which he can observe anything and anyone in the galaxy. He uses it to monitor his possessed slaves and Robotic Mummies, directing their actions to facilitate his escape. Why would his jailers provide him with such a device? And Namin supposedly takes over the Scarman mansion and fills it with sarcophagi full of Robotic Mummies. Where in the hell did he get those? Mummies R Us?\n\nAs for the actual drawing and design of the infographic, I changed the layout and rearranged boxes several times until I was satisfied with it. There's no science or formula to this; I just arrange things until I think it looks right. As for the characters, drawing monsters and helmeted beings is always pretty easy because they don't have features–so Sutekh and the Mummies were no problem. I'd drawn the Fourth Doctor before, but I altered his expression here and changed his outfit to the one he wore in the episode. Marcus Scarman proved harder to draw than I thought he would be, probably because he looked slightly different in every reference photo I found. Laurence Scarman and Namin took a little while to get right, but weren't too difficult.\n\nThe hardest one of them all to draw was Sarah Jane. I realized this was the first time I'd attempted to draw a female in my cartoony \"Doctor Who Style.\" Obviously I couldn't draw her with a giant nose and long skinny head like all the male characters or she'd have looked ridiculous. I had to pull back the cartooniness quite a bit for her. She proved remarkably difficult to capture. I went through many, many version of Sarah Jane before I got a decent likeness. I'm still not 100% satisfied with her, but she'll have to do.\n\nVery special thanks to my pal across the pond, Ian Ledger, who helped out with editing, text correction and support. Thanks to him I now know what a \"ginger moggie\" is.\n\nDrawn and laid out entirely in InDesign.\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nI'm a big fan of Doctor Who, so I thought I'd start a series of vector drawings of all the various Doctors.\n\nWilliam Hartnell played the Doctor from 1963 to 1966. I've seen short clips of him, but I have to admit I've never seen an entire episode of his. Hartnell gave us the first ever Dalek episode, and introduced the Cybermen as well.\n\nBack when Doctor Who first premiered in 1963, no one at the BBC could have possibly predicted that home video would some day become a reality, or that anyone would ever want to watch the episodes fifty years later. The BBC would record one of Hartnell's episodes on videotape, broadcast it, then record the next week's show over it! Many of Hartnell's three season's worth of shows are lost forever in the mists of time. It makes me ill just thinking about it! Meanwhile, every episode of Two And A Half Men and The Bachelor will exist well after we're all dead and buried. There's no justice in this universe.\n\nDoctor #1 is a vector drawing, drawn all in InDesign. I'm having a lot of fun working in this simpler vector style. It's interesting seeing how much I can simplify a character and still have them be recognizable.\n\nPlease forgive the ugly watermark on the illustration. I swore I would never add one to my art, because I know that 99.99% of my readers would never even think of stealing it. But earlier this year I had a run-in with an art thief who was not only stealing my work, but selling it as her own! Hence the watermarks. This is why we can't have nice things.\n\nOne weird thing I've noticed: when I do a bitmap drawing, I use the graphic tablet. I wouldn't be caught dead without it. But when I do a vector drawing, I use the mouse. Strange. Further proof that there's more than one person living in my head.\n\nStay tuned for Doctors #2 through #11!\n\nWant to see more? Check out my new blog! All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nI'm a big fan of Doctor Who, so I thought I'd start a series of vector drawings of all the various Doctors.\n\nLast month the BBC finally released a photo of the brand new Twelfth Doctor in his official costume, so I thought I'd get a head start and draw him.\n\nSeeing as the show won't be back until Fall 2014, we don't yet know much about this particular incarnation of the Doctor. So far all we know is that he's got new kidneys, he doesn't like their color and he doesn't know how to fly the TARDIS.\n\nI'm also not sure if he'll keep the Eleventh Doctor's extendable sonic screwdriver or opt for a new model. If he does get a new one (and I wouldn't be surprised if he did, since it would give the toy companies another geegaw to sell), I'll come back and add it.\n\nI'm curious to see how the fans will react to actor Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor. Both David Tennant and Matt Smith, Doctors Ten and Eleven respectively, were very young and were considered \"dreamy\" and \"sexy\" by many female fans who oohed and aahed over them.\n\nCapaldi is currently 55 years old. That's the same age that William Hartnell was when he played the First Doctor way back in 1963! Will the fans of the \"dreamy\" Doctors swoon over one who's old enough to be their father? Time will tell, I suppose.\n\nDoctor #12 looked very stern in every reference photo I found of him. Hopefully he won't be so serious all the time, and will have a lighter side to him.\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor is a vector drawing, done all in InDesign. It's been a while since I drew one of these Doctor illustrations in vector and I kind of forgot how I did it. I had to go back and study the previous drawings to see how they looked and match their style.\n\nBy the way, what sadistic bastard decided there should be an \"F\" in \"twelfth?\" I spell it wrong every time!\n\nPlease forgive the ugly watermark on the illustration. I swore I would never add one to my art, because I know that 99.99% of my readers would never even think of stealing it.

All the cool kids are doing it!\n\nI'm also on Twitter for some reason.\n\nIt's the liquid metal T-1000 from Terminator 2: Judgement Day.\n\nT2 (as the in crowd calls it) is one of my all time favorite movies. It's one of the few sequels that's better than the original, and was on the cutting edge of special effects as one of the first films to feature a completely CGI realistic human character.\n\nI was amazed with the T-1000 and it's morphing abilities-- particularly the scene in which it's thrown against a wall and reverses itself without moving so it's instantly facing the opposite direction. Awesome!\n\nRobert Patrick did an excellent job portraying a cold, calculating futuristic killing machine. He moved with a cat-like agility as he relentlessly pursued his prey.\n\nRather than cast another hulking brute like Schwarzenegger as a Terminator, the producers chose Patrick specifically because of his slim physique. They wanted the audience to assume that Patrick was an associate of Kyle Reese who came back in time to save the Conner family. The collective mind of the audience would have then been blown when it realized Patrick was actually the bad guy and Arnold as the T-800 was the good guy this time around. Too bad the trailers telegraphed this big reveal months in advance. Why do they always do that?\n\nOne thing I never quite understood about the movie-- how was the T-1000 able to come back in time? For that matter, how was either Terminator able to do so? In the first film it's established that Skynet's time machine only works on organic matter. A person can go back in time, but they can't bring any futuristic weapons or technology with them.\n\nThe original T-800 Terminator was a robotic endoskeleton covered with living, human skin. I guess we're to believe that was enough to fool the time machine into transporting it into the past. But the T-1000 is made of liquid metal. How the heck was it able to come back? Whoops! Maybe it was stuffed inside a dead human that was transported and it crawled out while we weren't looking.\n\nOnce I started drawing the T-1000 I realized his uniform was much more complicated than expected. I've seen the film countless times and never noticed all the minute details, like the little black pen sticking out of an opening above his pocket.\n\nHere's a good trivia question you can use to impress your friends: What's the name on the T-1000's name tag? Answer: Austin. The T-1000 can mimic anything that it touches, and seconds after it appeared in 1991, it stabbed a nosy cop whose name was apparently Austin.\n\nThe T-1000 is a vector drawing, done in InDesign.\n\nCheck out the blog post to see an alternate version of the T-1000.\n\nWant to see more?
