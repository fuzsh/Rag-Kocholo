        "text": "Heath Ledger’s parents feel nothing but love and pride when thinking of Michelle Williams and her new husband.\n\nNow 10 years after the Australian actor died of an accidental overdose, Michelle has tied the knot, and is even looking forward to introucing her new man to her late ex’s family!\n\n“We’re going to see Matilda in New York next week. So we’ll be there a few days and see how she’s grown,” Heath’s father, Kim Ledger told Us Weekly at the Heath Ledger Scholarship event this Thursday.\n\nReferring to the actor and Michelle’s now 12-year-old daughter, Matilda Ledger, Kim added: “She seems to have grown pretty tall.”\n\nHe and wife Sally Ledger admitted that apart from seeing Matilda, catching up with Michelle, 38, was “really good,” and they were glad to see her settled down with husband Phil Elverum.\n\n“We get to meet him as well,” Sally said, not wanting to give too many details about the actress’ relationship. “Michelle’s very low-key. We’re all pretty low-key.”\n\nHusband Kim agreed. “She’s very private and I don’t really like to make too many comments about her,” he said. “But we are very happy for her.”\n\nRadarOnline.com readers know Michelle Williams often posts touching messages about late love Heath Ledger, and regularly tells her daughter stories of their love story and wonderful life before his sudden death.\n\nThis July, however, after years of grieving the loss of her longtime love, she said “I do” to her new man, in a very private ceremony."
