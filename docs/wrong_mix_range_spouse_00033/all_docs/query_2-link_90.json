        "text": "2019\n\nBy Frédéric Côté-Boudreau\n\nPersons with cognitive disabilities and nonhuman animals are denied the right to make personal choices because it is claimed that they are not autonomous, for autonomy requires the capacity to revise one’s preferences and to have second-order desires. In this thesis, I argue first that this account of autonomy (that I call ‘rational autonomy’) does not provide a satisfying foundation to the right to make personal choices and to the interest in liberty, even for the paradigmatic cases of humans deemed rational agents; second, I propose and develop a new conception, named ‘inclusive autonomy’, that is intended to do justice to rational agents, persons with cognitive abilities, and nonhuman animals. This enquiry involves multiple steps. First, I criticize the way rational autonomy intends to support a right to make personal choices, by arguing it is empirically inaccurate, that it could be perfectionist or elitist if it is deemed as a requirement rather than a value to promote, and that it generally fails to explain why choices that have not been rationally revised cannot be protected by the right in question. Second, I argue that persons with cognitive disabilities and nonhuman animals also possess an interest in liberty, and especially an objective interest in non-domination, and for the same reasons as rational agents. Third, after assessing a few notable alternatives to rational autonomy, I identify four desiderata for a satisfying conception: the balance between the right to take risks and paternalism, the antidomination requirement, the anti-ableist requirement, and the social support requirement. Inclusive autonomy, defined as the ability to form subjectively defined goods, is equipped to address these desiderata if it is further supplied by an account of preference formation and a theory of paternalism. For these reasons, I explain how the structuring of opportunities and the interest in non-domination can help individuals to develop authentic preferences, even when they are unable to revise their desires; and I discuss three provisos—the competence threshold, the social support principle, and the limited intervention requirement—that impose conditions for paternalistic interventions while enabling agents to enjoy autonomy to the greatest extent possible....Read more\n\nRelated Papers\n\nThe Review of Politics, 1993\n\nDownload\n\nIn this article, I argue that autonomy has to be conceived substantively in order to serve as the qualifying condition for receiving the full set of individual liberal rights. I show that the common distinction between content-neutral and substantive accounts of autonomy is riddled with confusion and ambiguities, and provide a clear alternative taxonomy. At least insofar as we are concerned with liberal settings, the real question is whether or not the value(s) and norm(s) implied by an account of autonomy are acceptable to reasonable people, not whether these accounts are content-neutral, procedural or input-focused. Finally, I demonstrate how substantive constraints are compatible with, or even implied in, the notion of autonomy at play in (Rawls's) political liberalism. Overall, I present a normative reconstruction, clarification, and internal critique of liberalism, drawing on case law and statutes from England and Wales.\n\nDownload\n\nDelaware Journal of Public Health\n\nDownload\n\nThe Theory and Practice of Autonomy\n\nDownload\n\nAmerican Journal of Bioethics, 2016\n\nDownload\n\nRiccardo Dottori (ed.), Autonomy of Reason? Proceedings of the V Meeting Italian-American Philosophy, Lit Verlag, Wien, 2009\n\nAccording to John McDowell, to be autonomous implies to be responsive to reasons, to inhabit the logical space of reasons. To challenge that thesis, one could argue that: 1) any attempt to mark the boundary of the “space of reasons” fails, due to the admission of something that is beyond the received view of Reason; 2) plain fitness, at a naturalistic level, is a good reason to act; 3) in some respect, autonomy depends on the difference between the abilities of cognitive systems and the features of their environment. It is questionable whether a similar “autonomy” could be traced in a pure logical space; presumably, we must dwell in a ruder space, where physical, biological and psychological properties perform specific tasks.\n\nDownload\n\nAxel Honneth: Critical Essays (ed. Danielle Petherbridge, Leiden: Brill), 2011\n\nIn this old paper (written in 2005 as a graduate student), I try to systematically explore what kind of social recognition and relationships are necessary for exercising autonomy, understood as reasons-responsive self-governance. Drawing on Axel Honneth's work, I then sketch what a Hegelian liberalism might look like.\n\nDownload"
