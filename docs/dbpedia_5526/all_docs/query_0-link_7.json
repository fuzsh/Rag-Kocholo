        "text": "The University of Michigan Secular Student Alliance is proud to host secular and LGBT activist Nate Phelps, who will be speaking in Ann Arbor this upcoming October 10th, at Rackham Auditorium.\n\nNate is the son of Pastor Fred Phelps, founder of the Westboro Baptist Church. Since the age of 18, Nate has been the estranged son of this infamous family, and left the church for good in 1980, as well as religion in general in a process that evolved over several years and culminated with the September 11th attacks. Nate has since become a passionate LGBT advocate and secular activist, and is working on a biographical account of his life within and without his home church.\n\nThis event will be free, and open to the general public. Doors open at 6:30pm on the event date, and the event is scheduled to start at 7:00pm (NO 'Michigan Time'). Feel free to attend, and come listen to the story of someone whose history with the WBC cannot be more personal.\n\nThe Michigan SSA would like to give thanks to our co-sponsoring and co-planning organizations, in particular the Michigan Chapter of the Center for Inquiry. This event is happening and is free to the public with their generous assistance."
