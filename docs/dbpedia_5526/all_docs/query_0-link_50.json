        "text": "Jim Turner\n\n// vocals/guitar\n\nJim Turner, from Arlington, Texas, began learning music on the piano at 7 years of age. After migrating to the guitar, he became a fan and student of country music. Listening to Bill Mack, the \"Midnight Cowboy” on WBAP 820 out of Fort Worth, he quickly fell in love with the music of Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard and Bob Wills among others. He began playing professionally in 1978. In 1979, he had the fortunate opportunity of having Al Strickland of the the Texas Playboys join him for a set. This only intensified the urge to play Western Swing music. In the 1980’s he performed with and managed the band Southbound. Playing in the dance halls of central Texas, he mixed the sounds of dancehall shuffle and Western Swing, always catering to the wants and wishes of the dancers.\n\nDuring the mid 1990’s, he began studying contest-style fiddling and developed an appreciation and understanding of what separated the good fiddlers from the great ones. It was also during this time that he picked up pointers from some of the great backup rhythm guitarists at the contests. It quickly became apparent that the chord and rhythm patterns of these guitar players were very similar to the styles used by swing and jazz players. Only a fine line separated Western Swing from its musical cousins.\n\nAfter starting up the Uptown Drifters in 2012, he began mixing genres of swing and extending invitations to many of the great jazz and swing musicians of North Texas. While trying to promote and preserve Western Swing and Americana music, he also wanted to provide a platform for talented musicians to showcase their improvisational skills.\n\nHailey Darwin\n\n// fiddle/vocals\n\n​\n\nHailey Sandoz is a Texas-bred musician, following a less-trodden path among millennials. Her style is rooted in western swing, jazz, bluegrass, and Celtic. This remarkable young artist captures the attention of audiences young and old through her dynamic performance and representation of Western Swing, “the official music of Texas.” Hailey is known for her exceptional fiddling, jazzy vocals, and creative arranging skills. While Western swing is her most fun wheelhouse, Hailey is at home playing Celtic, Country, and anything in between. For the past thirteen years, Hailey has traveled all across the world performing at festivals and concert halls in the United States and abroad, including the Equiblues Festival in France. At age 18, Hailey was hired full-time with Grammy-Award Winner, Bobby Flores and the Yellow Rose Band. Since then, Hailey has appeared with Bobby Flores on two seasons of the RFDTV series, TruCountry. Hailey is a 4-time recipient of the International Western Music Association Instrumentalist of the Year (2023, 2021, 2019, & 2017). She has also been awarded the 2019 Cowtown Society of Western Music Rising Star of the Year, 2016 Academy of Western Artist Young Artist of the Year, 2015 International Western Music Association Crescendo Rising Star, as well as winning several fiddle competitions. In addition to these accolades, Hailey has had the privilege of performing with several legendary artists such as Leon Rausch and Tommy Allsup, and has opened for Michael Martin Murphy, Billy Dean, Crystal Gale and The Oak Ridge Boys.\n\nSteve Curry\n\n// guitar/vocals\n\nSteve Curry has toured and recorded with many diverse bands and artists such as Texas Gypsies, The Vinyl Stripes, The Jacksons, Boney James, Rapper D.O.C, 50’s icon Fabian and has played guitar for many Texas artists and bands. He lived in Los Angeles in the 90’s writing and performing music for many artists and song writers and touring some. He has won awards and was selected to the National Endowment for the Arts American Masterpieces touring program, the Touring Artist Program of the Texas Commission on the Arts, and the Mid-America Arts Alliance touring roster. He has toured all over the USA, Japan, and even Dubai! Steve also has worked as a producer and engineer in his studio and other local DFW area studios. He has worked on over 50 CD releases from artist’s like the late Muddy Waters to many regional rock, country and jazz bands. He also has composed music and has played guitar for television and film for Disney, Bravo, Cartoon Network, Fox TV, and on commercials for Mercedes, Ford, EA and more. Steve is endorsed by Gretsch Guitars and Category 5 amps.\n\nNathan Phelps\n\n// bass/piano\n\nNathan Phelps is a multi-instrumentalist, and composer from Denton, Texas. Being primarily self-taught throughout his early years, he went on to earn the degree of a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Jazz Bass Performance from the California Institute of the Arts where he studied with the legendary jazz bassist Charlie Haden. Since graduating, he has since moved back to Texas where he performs on both Double Bass and Piano with a wide range artists of diverse genres. Although he is primarily active as a freelance jazz bassist playing locally in the North Texas area, past tours includes a national tour as a bassist with rock-a-billy singer-songwriter Wayne the Train Hancock, and an international tour on keyboards and synthesizers with famed symphonic pop band The Polyphonic Spree."
