        "text": "On Sunday, the Westboro Baptist Church — which is almost universally reviled for picketing the funerals of U.S. soldiers and celebrities — confirmed that founder and longtime pastor Fred Phelps Sr. has some \"health problems\" and is in a care facility. Late Saturday, estranged son Nathan Phelps said on Facebook that his father is \"on the edge of death at Midland Hospice house in Topeka, Kansas.\"\n\nNathan Phelps also informed the world outside of the insular church that his father \"was ex-communicated from the 'church' back in August of 2013,\" adding in an email to The Topeka Capital-Journal that after his father was voted out of Westboro Baptist and moved from his residence above the church, he stopped eating and drinking. A second estranged son, Mark Phelps, confirmed the news from brother Nathan."
