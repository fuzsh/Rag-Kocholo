        "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO – Michael Phelps told American youngsters Caeleb Dressel and Ryan Held to “let the tears out” after they broke down with emotion following the United States’ dramatic victory in the men's 4x100-meter freestyle relay on Sunday night.\n\nHeld, 21, and Dressel, 19, joined Olympic legend Phelps and anchor Nathan Adrian to beat out France and Australia, and wept with joy both on the medal podium and afterwards.\n\n“Michael just said to let it out, let it go, to take my time to enjoy the moment,” Dressel said. “I tried to tell myself I wasn’t going to cry. I was too tired to cry. But as soon as I heard that national anthem play the tears rolled down my face. I just couldn’t hold back.”\n\nHeld, who swam the third leg and followed on from the lead built up by Phelps, was the first to cry, seeing the tears roll even before he reached the podium for the medal ceremony.\n\nIt wasn’t even the first show of emotion he’d had that day, breaking down with happiness and excitement after being named to the final squad in place of Anthony Ervin.\n\n“Coach (Bob) Bowman told me I was in and … before long I was on the phone with my mom, bawling,” Held said. “This is my first international team and to win a gold medal, it just comes out.”\n\nEven Phelps looked misty eyed as the national anthem played, though he insisted it was his younger teammates who had set him off.\n\n“I told them beforehand it is OK to sing, and it is OK to cry,” Phelps said. “It is good to see the emotion out of those guys, and it shows they really do care. They were so amped. As one of the old guys it is pretty cool to see."
