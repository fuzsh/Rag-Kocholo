        "text": "Ancestors Descendants\n\nProfile last modified 26 Apr 2020 | Created 18 Jun 2018\n\nThis page has been accessed 163 times.\n\nBiography\n\nNathaniel was born on 22 Oct 1711 (some genealogy books say 1714) to John Phelps and Elizabeth Putnam.[1]\n\nNathaniel Phelps and Bethiah (Bethyah) __ (maiden name may be Sawyer, but it's still being determined) were married in around 1741... note that they had children in 1740s/50s). She cannot be the Bethiah Upton because she married in 1761 to a Nathan Phelps).\n\nMr. Nathaniel settled in Reading, Middlesex Co., Massachusetts. He was a soldier of French and Indian Wars of 1759 and 1760. He died in 1761.[2]\n\nHe and his wife Bethiah had six children, all born in Reading, Middlesex Co., Massachusetts:[3]\n\nSusanna PHELPS 1743–bef 1666\n\nBethyah Bethiah PHELPS 1744–bef. 1766\n\nNathaniel PHELPS 1746–1836\n\nDorcas PHELPS 1749–1797\n\nLydia PHELPS 1751–\n\nSamuel PHELPS 1754–died young - no record found\n\nWhen Nathaniel died in 1761, his wife, the widow, Bethiah was the administratrix. The inventory of his estate amounted to £215 pounds, 6s, and 8d (215 pounds, 6 sterling, 8 pence). [4]\n\nNathaniel's and Bethiah's children were raised by two guardians. Archelaus McIntrye was appointed the guardian of the older three children Susannah, Bethiah, and Nathaniel on 11 Jul 1763. William Savage was appointed the guardian of Lydia and Dorcas, under 14 years, on 7 Jan 1763. Nathaniel was the only son of Nathaniel and Bethiah Phelps who survived to adulthood.[5]\n\n[Probate records dated 1761-63 are found on Ancestry. Need to see if they are available on FamilySearch, I'll try to find it when I am able.]\n\nIn September 1766, it is stated that Nathaniel Phelps was the only son of the deceased and that he (the son) had sisters Dorcas and Lydia living, sister Bethiah, deceased, and two minor sisters, Susannah deceased, and Lydia, as before mentioned.[6]\n\nSources\n\n↑ http://ma-vitalrecords.org/MA/Essex/Salem/Images/SalemV2_B162.shtml\n\n↑ https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ9S87ZA4kkC&dq=Nathaniel+Phelps+Jr+and+Dorcas+Hart.&q=Phelps%2C+Nathaniel+Mar+10+1746#v=onepage&q=Phelps%2C%20Nathaniel%20%2B%20Bethiah&f=false\n\n↑ https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ9S87ZA4kkC&dq=Nathaniel+Phelps+Jr+and+Dorcas+Hart.&q=Phelps%2C+Nathaniel+Mar+10+1746#v=onepage&q=Phelps%2C%20Nathaniel%20%2B%20Bethiah&f=false\n\n↑ https://archive.org/stream/phelpsfamilyofam002phel#page/1592/mode/2up/search/bethiah\n\n↑ https://archive.org/stream/phelpsfamilyofam002phel#page/1592/mode/2up/search/bethiah\n\n↑ https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ9S87ZA4kkC&dq=Nathaniel+Phelps+Jr+and+Dorcas+Hart.&q=Phelps%2C+Nathaniel+Mar+10+1746#v=onepage&q=Phelps%2C%20Nathaniel%20%2B%20Bethiah&f=false\n\nSee also:\n\nMassachusetts Vital Records, Birth, Salem for Nathaniel Phelps http://ma-vitalrecords.org/MA/Essex/Salem/Images/SalemV2_B162.shtml\n\nVital Records of Reading, Massachusetts, to the Year 1850.
