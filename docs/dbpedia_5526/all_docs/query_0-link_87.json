        "text": "The son of Fred Phelps, the founder of the Westboro Baptist Church, has said that his father is about to die.\n\nNathan Phelps, who has been estranged from his father, who runs the ‘God Hates Fags’ campaign for thirty years says that he has learnt that his father is at deaths door.\n\nNathan Phelps said: “I’ve learned that my father, Fred Phelps Sr, pastor of the ‘God Hates Fags’ Westboro Baptist Church, was ex-communicated from the ‘church’ back in August of 2013. He is now on the edge of death at Midland Hospice house in Topeka, Kansas.\n\n“I’m not sure how I feel about this. Terribly ironic that his devotion to his god ends this way. Destroyed by the monster he made.\n\n“I feel sad for all the hurt he’s caused so many. I feel sad for those who will lose the grandfather and father they loved. And I’m bitterly angry that my family is blocking the family members who left from seeing him, and saying their goodbyes.”\n\nNathan, the sixth of Fred Phelps 13 children ran away from home aged 18 and now promotes LGBT rights in Canada.\n\nThe anti-gay church claims that everything bad that happens to Americans from the death of soldiers, mass murder through to natural disasters are a punishment of God for the existence of gay people in the United States."
