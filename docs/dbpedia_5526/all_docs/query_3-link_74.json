        "text": "By Mike Griffith\n\nMichael Phelps said the tears were hidden behind his goggles Saturday night.\n\nHis unparalleled swimming talent, however, had been made crystal clear throughout the week for those who crammed into the 17,500-seat London Olympic Aquatic Centre.\n\nPhelps' closing act, the butterfly leg of the 400-meter medley relay, had just the right touch of drama for Team USA's retiring 27-year-old hero.\n\nJapan led the race by 0.21 seconds when Phelps dived in for what he has repeatedly said will be the final competitive swim of his life.\n\nThe crowd roared its approval as Phelps reeled in Japan's Takeshi Matsuda. By the time Phelps touched out, the Americans were back in front by a quarter of a second.\n\nFreestyle specialist Nathan Adrian nailed down the final leg as the Americans won the gold going away in 3 minutes, 29.35 seconds. Japan earned silver in 3:31.26 and Australia bronze in 3:31.58.\n\nThe dominant finish was appropriate; the Americans enjoyed arguably their best Olympic meet in modern history, winning 16 gold medals out of the 32 events. They finished with 18 medals total with Chian, a distant second, with eight medals.\n\nPhelps helped account for four of those golds. His Olympic record of gold medals stands at 18, while his mark for most overall medals is at 22 â€” his two silver and two bronze added into the mix.\n\nSwimming's governing organization, FINA, made a special trophy presentation at the conclusion of Saturday night's event, allowing for Phelps to make a curtain call.\n\nPhelps waved to the crowd as a banner was extended before him: \"Phelphs Phans Phorever.\" Cheers of \"Mi-chael, Mi-chael\" echoed through the arena.\n\nMoments later, Phelps explained that it's time for him to walk away from the sport because there is nothing else left for him to accomplish.\n\n\"I've been able to do everything I've wanted,'' said Phelps, who set a record at the 2008 Beijing Games by winning eight gold medals. \"I did it. Though all the ups and downs of my career, I've been able to do things no one else has done.\"\n\nThe women's 400 medley relay team left the arena being able to say the same thing.\n\nSparked by 17-year-old Missy Franklin, the Americans led throughout the event, finishing in a world-record 3:25.05 and yet another gold medal.\n\nRebecca Soni swam the breaststroke, Dana Vollmer the butterfly, and Allison Schmitt finished up with the freestyle as the Americans finished nearly two seconds ahead of the Australians (3:52.05).\n\n\"That was the perfect way to end the meet,\" said Franklin, who hauled in four gold medals and a bronze in London, also making history as the first woman to swim seven events in one Olympics.\n\nThe evening had opened with Ranomi Kromowidjojo of the Netherlands swimming an Olympic-record time of 24.05 seconds to win the women's 50 freestyle. Jessica Hardy was the top American finisher, seventh at 24.62.\n\nChina's Sun Yang then smashed the world record in the men's 1,500 meters, 14:31.02.\n\nThe rest of the night belonged to the USA's medley relay teams and, ultimately, Phelps.\n\nAustralia's James \"The Missile\" Magnussen, one of the most promising (and outspoken) swimmers in the world, sensed the moment.\n\n\"Phelps has been such a giant of the sport and the Olympics as a whole, I feel pretty privileged to have been in his last race,\" Magnussen said. \"There's definitely room for another big name in the sport now. In men's swimming in particular, it's wide open.\"\n\nWhile Phelps insists he's done, there remained some skepticism in the swimming community.\n\nWhat could not be debated, however, was the role Phelps played in the evolution of his sport.\n\n\"Michael is the greatest athlete in the history of any sport,\" said Frank Busch, USA's national swim team director. \"He put the sport on the world map and changed everything.\"\n\nMike Griffith is part of the Scripps team covering the Olympics.
