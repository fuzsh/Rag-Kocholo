        "text": "This is such a refreshing approach to examining elite endurance performance through testing in the field. Bak Klaris et al put 12 elite cyclists through a 6 hour simulated road race. Then then measured different power outputs, fat oxidation and lactate during and after the simulation. Some very interesting observations regarding durability with potential implications for training and racing... Here's me and the last author, Professor Lars Nybo, discussing their results. https://lnkd.in/dKrXvhAF\n\nThe arms are the engine in freestyle. However, there’s a lot of confusion as to what’s actually happening and what swimmers need to do to swim fast. Check the video to learn more about how to use the arms to create propulsion in freestyle, as well as what it LOOKS like. When you know understand what’s happening and can see it happening, you can start to help swimmers learn to create speed by changing it. https://lnkd.in/efVghNXd\n\nA few weeks ago Olympian Kara Goucher and I hosted a panel with other Olympic Trials runners all about the ups and downs of a running life, filled with actionable advice for every runner. The link below is the full video of the panel, and I'm proud we captured this because it's definitely one of the best conversations I've had the privilege of being a part of! In this discussion we cover: -why choose running? -combining big goals with a love of the process -dealing with “failure” and setbacks -why run marathons? -defining a great race -mental strategies for self-doubt and fear For The Long Run Sara Vaughn Briana Boehmer Noah Droddy\n\nSwimming is as much about the mind as it is the body TLDR: I want to introduce you to the idea of managing your Awareness and Attention. Awareness is about what you're noticing in the moment, while Attention is what you choose to prioritize. Often we let our Attention be grabbed by things such as screens which limit our Awareness. Expanding your Awareness can give you a chance to step out of your 'busy head', take a breath and see everything around you. This can help in changing habits or limiting beliefs even in swimming. My unconventional Alexander Technique training helped me develop the skill of managing my Attention while maintaining an expanded Awareness which I include in my Intuitive Swimming method. Conscious Control and Inhibition are core principles of Alexander Technique that allow us to change the way we approach swimming struggles from ‘fixing’ to ‘understanding’. #expandingawareness #alexandertechnique Going beyond swimming with Intuitive Swimming aka Intuitive Learning\n\nNew video out on my Youtuber Channel. In this video, I talk about the phase of my gym training that builds that crucial platform of strength so that I can start to lift heavier later on.
