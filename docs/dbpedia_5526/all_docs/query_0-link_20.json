        "text": "It was five minutes to midnight as Nate Phelps quietly picked his way through the three interconnected rooms where his siblings slept. At the end of the corridor there was the dining room. To the right, a closed door to the church which adjoined the house. There was no sound from the top of the staircase that led to his father’s room. Nate stood there in the darkness, staring at the old red clock in front of him and watched as the minute hand approached 12 and the moment he would turn 18.\n\nHe ran as fast as he could, back through the three rooms and out of the door into the night. Nate had no idea who had heard him or who, if anyone, was coming after him. He jumped into his waiting car, an old banger he’d bought for $300 from the high school security guard the previous week, and prayed as the engine spluttered to life. Then he disappeared, away from the church, from his father’s abuse and from the only life he’d ever known.\n\nPhelps is the sixth of 13 children of Fred Phelps, the notorious pastor of Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas. Westboro first came to international attention after its members (consisting largely of members of Phelps’s extended family) picketed the funeral of Matthew Shepard, the student who was murdered in 1998 because he was gay.\n\nAt Shepard’s funeral, Phelps and his followers held signs that read: “God Hates Fags” and “No Tears for Queers”. By 2005, the church was picketing funerals of fallen soldiers too. During one, Phelps told the Associated Press: “Our attitude toward what’s happening with the war is the Lord is punishing this evil nation for abandoning all moral imperatives that are worth a dime.”\n\nEssentially, Phelps and his followers see all tragedies involving loss of life – war, natural disasters, mass shootings – as God’s judgment on a world that “enables” homosexuality. Using this bizarre logic, they have protested at Lady Gaga concerts, schools, the Oscars, and the funerals of Navy SEALS, miners, hurricane victims and Elizabeth Taylor – “fag enablers” one and all, they claim. The church has only about 40 members, yet Westboro is world famous. Several US states are introducing laws aimed at banning their protests; even the KKK has denounced them.\n\nIn the UK, the church was featured in a 2007 BBC documentary presented by Louis Theroux, called The Most Hated Family in America. Afterwards Fred’s daughter Shirley had just one fault to pick with the film: she wished it had been called “The Most Hated Family in the World”.\n\nAfter Nate left his family in the dead of night, he moved to California and later to Canada. As his family’s notoriety grew, he began telling his story and became a vocal campaigner against religious extremism and child abuse. He also became his father’s biggest bête noire.\n\nI meet Nate at his hotel a few hours before he is due to speak at the Lawrence Technical University in Detroit, Michigan, and we head for breakfast. He is an unlikely looking ex-member of one of the most notorious fundamentalist Christian churches in the world: a large, friendly man with a grey goatee and small hoop earring in his left ear, he looks relaxed as he recounts his horrifying story of mental and physical abuse.\n\nNate left Westboro in 1976 and says he has carried the emotional scars ever since. Even though a psychologist once told him he should leave the past behind and move on, he feels that part of his healing comes from speaking out against his father’s firebrand Christianity and hate speech.\n\nWhen he was young, Nate, now 53, recalls his mother keeping him and his elder brother Mark away from their father as much as possible. It wasn’t until the boys were a little older that he says they too became victims of his violent behaviour.\n\n“He had this old barber’s strap and used it so much that the last six inches were frayed, kind of like a cat-o-nine-tails, and he’d hit you with it and it’d wrap around your hips and rip the skin,” Nate says. “By the time I turned eight I remember he had started using a mattock handle instead. Similar to a pickaxe handle, it was about 4ft long and bigger than a baseball bat.” Nate says his father would fly into rages and beat him and his siblings mercilessly: “Then he’d set the mattock down and hit them with his fist.” Nate recalls one particular occasion when he was bent over a church pew backwards and felt like his back was breaking. When he tried to escape, Fred split his head open.\n\nIt’s an incident Mark Phelps, who left two years before Nate, recalls with clarity. “Fred’s always denied it, but there is no question,” Mark told me later in a telephone call. “He took great delight punishing Nate and Kathy, our sister. They got 80 per cent of the beatings, but Nate got more than anybody.”\n\nFred Phelps was born in Mississippi in 1929. By all accounts his childhood was tragic: his father worked on the railroads during the Great Depression and his mother died of cancer when he was five, leaving his aunt to raise him. Despite this, Nate says he and his siblings were told that their father was a star pupil, a Golden Gloves boxer and an Eagle Scout, the highest rank attainable, albeit one some people remembered as having an “antagonistic bent”. Fred met Margie Simms, Nate’s mother, in 1952 while they were both attending the Arizona Bible Institute. Twelve years later he graduated with a law degree from a university in Kansas and fought various civil rights suits in the Sixties. According to local reports, he gained a reputation as a sharp, competent attorney “whose eloquent and fiery orations mesmerised juries”. Two decades later, he received awards from the Greater Kansas City Chapter of Blacks in Government and a local branch of the human rights group the NAACP.\n\nBut Nate Phelps says the perception in some circles that his father was once this champion of civil rights, railing against discrimination, is laughable. “We would all call black people ‘DNs’ at home. It stood for Dumb N------ and was our private language,” he says. “We thought it was clever to call them that in front of them. He was deeply prejudiced, and he believed the Bible said they were cursed.”\n\nNate says Fred Phelps saw an opportunity with the passing of the Civil Rights Act to cash in. “There was a lot of money, and a lot of opportunity,” he says. “And suddenly my father was the man to go to.” At the same time, Nate says, he and his siblings were being fed a distorted version of the Bible. “We were told we were the only people left on Earth; the only ones who were going to be saved.” Nate says his father became an itinerant preacher, attempting to save Mormons in Utah and Native Americans in the south west, and believing that he was never going to die.\n\nI ask Nate whether it was a surprise to him when his father led his church in picketing the funerals of soldiers or started publicly holding homophobic signs up to draw attention to themselves. Had he seen anything during his childhood that hinted at the things to come?\n\nFred always had a tendency towards hyperbole and outlandish rhetoric, Nate says. He’s always spoken out against homosexuality. In fact, growing up, Nate was told there was a special place in hell reserved for gay people, that it was a sin from which they couldn’t recover. “That said, I saw no hint that it would turn into some sort of campaign.” He says he has no doubt that members of his dad’s church sit around and come up with these odious sound bites that are provocative and outrageous because it works. It gets people’s attention. “What’s remarkable,” says Nate, “is that they can maintain it with such longevity and not let the hatred eat away at their soul.”\n\nAfter he left, Nate heard his father was furious that he’d gone; since he thought the old man detested him, this confused him. He saw a psychologist to try to rid him of the religious indoctrination he’d undergone, and ended up in a psychiatric hospital for two weeks where he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. In 1986, he married his girlfriend Tammi; after the couple had children, they attended a mainstream church in California — “to feel part of a community”.\n\nIn 1995, his second child, Tyler, then aged seven, asked him about hell, and how long people stayed there. “Forever, I told him, and he burst into tears. He was terrified.” Nate never took his children to church again, and eventually renounced Christianity altogether. He’s now divorced, single and living in Calgary, Canada, where he’s writing a book about growing up with Fred.\n\nThe first time Nate spoke in public at an atheist convention in Atlanta he got three standing ovations. He was sharing a platform that day with Richard Dawkins, and at the end of his talk, when it came to questions from the audience, Dawkins was the first to ask one. “He wanted to know why my old man wasn’t in jail,” Nate says. “From his perspective, what I’d been through was unacceptable. As bright as he [Dawkins] is, I don’t think he understood the power of religion here in America; that the law turns a blind eye to a lot of this really insane stuff.\n\n“At first I wondered who the hell was going to want to hear my story,” says Nate. “Then I started getting emails and phone calls from people who had grown up in fundamentalist toxic religious environments.”\n\nToday Westboro Baptist Church, which refused to respond to questions for this article, has a dwindling membership; Nate’s niece Libby Phelps Alvarez left the church in February, closely followed by her sisters Megan and Grace. Fred Phelps turned 83 in November. What does Nate think will happen to the church when his father dies? “I used to say after my old man died that the church would die,” he says. “Then I started to hear my sister Shirley and she sounds a lot like him. And now Tim, my youngest brother, looks and sounds a lot like my old man.”\n\nDoes Nate still harbour any affection at all for his father or the family he left behind? “That’s a tough one,” he says. “It’s hard to have any affection for a guy who screams at you with all that vitriol and hatred. I still have a deep animosity toward my father and I don’t know if it ever will – or should – go away.”\n\nIn the mid-Nineties, when Westboro’s campaign of hate was still in its infancy, Nate was driving home late one night, flicking through the radio stations, when he heard the voice of his father. It was a talk radio programme he listened to regularly. “I assumed it was a pre-recorded session,” Nate says, “so when I got home I called the station to talk to the hosts. But it wasn’t pre-recorded. It was live. The host said, ‘You’re Fred Phelps’s son, you wanna ask him a question?’ The presenter then turned to Fred Phelps and asked him, ‘Do you have a son, Nate?’ ‘Well, I used to,’ he replied.\n\n“At that point I was still clinging to the religious arguments, so I asked him about passages in the Bible that I thought contradicted his behaviour,” Nate says. “How he justified his behaviour based on a particular verse.” But Nate got the wrong verse number, and his father picked him up on it. “I’d never interrupted him before and I told him to answer the question,” Nate says. “He just blew up. You didn’t talk that way to him. He started screaming. And that was it: the only time I’ve talked to my old man since I left.”"
