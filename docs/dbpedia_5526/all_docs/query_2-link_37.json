        "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. – NC State swim and dive will be well represented at the upcoming U.S. Olympic Trials. A total of 44 Wolfpack participants across incoming freshmen, current swimmers, alums, and Wolfpack Elite swimming for a chance to represent the United States in Paris during the summer Olympics.\n\nThe Olympic trials are set for June 15-23 from Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nThirty student-athletes from the 2023-24 season will make the trip, led by three-time national champion and five-time ACC champion Katharine Berkoff in the 100 backstroke.\n\nBayleigh Cranford will head to Knoxville, Tenn., for the U.S. Olympic diving trials. Cranford is coming off a season in which she represented the United States at the World Championships and placed fourth in the synchronized dive. Only a freshman, Cranford also won an ACC championship in the platform this past season.\n\nAll six American record holders in the 200-freestyle relay and 200-medley relay, including Aiden Hayes, Noah Henderson, Sam Hoover, Luke Miller, Quintin McCarty, and Drew Salls, will be in Indianapolis.\n\nAlumni Ryan Held and Justin Ress will also be competing. Held will be looking to make his second Olympic games after winning gold in the 4x100 m freestyle relay with Caeleb Dressel, Michael Phelps, and Nathan Adrian in 2016. Ress, a native of Cary, North Carolina, will be looking to make his first Olympics after just missing qualification in 2020.\n\nOutside the United States, the Wolfpack has seen two commits and one alumnus qualify for the Olympics. Bartosz Piszczorowicz will represent Poland in the mixed 400 medley relay. Piszczorowicz swam for the Wolfpack from 2021-23 and was a three-time ACC Champion and an All-American in the 800 and 400 freestyle relay.\n\nBetti Fabian and David Betleham, committed to the Wolfpack, will represent Hungary at the 10k open water event in Paris.\n\nComplete List of Wolfpack Participants and Events Below:\n\nKatharine Berkoff\n\n50 Free\n\n100 Free\n\n100 Back\n\nAbby Arens\n\n100 Fly\n\n100 Breast\n\n200 Breast\n\n50 Free\n\nMeghan Donald\n\n100 Back\n\nEmma Hastings\n\n400 Free\n\n800 Free\n\n1500 Free\n\nKatherine Helms\n\n200 IM\n\nKennedy Noble\n\n100 Back\n\n200 Back\n\n200 IM\n\nCaroline Sheble\n\n200 Fly\n\nBrooke Travis\n\n1500 Free\n\nChase Travis\n\n400 Free\n\n800 Free\n\n1500 Free\n\nRhyan White\n\n100 Back\n\n200 Back\n\nArsenio Bustos\n\n100 Free\n\n100 Back\n\n100 Fly\n\n200 IM\n\nStephen Conrad\n\n100 Back\n\nRoss Dant\n\n400 Free\n\n800 Free\n\nDaniel Diehl\n\n100 Free\n\n200 Free\n\n100 Back\n\n200 Back\n\n100 Fly\n\n200 IM\n\nJT Ewing\n\n100 Back\n\n200 Back\n\nJerry Fox\n\n50 Free\n\n100 Free\n\nAiden Hayes\n\n100 Back\n\n100 Fly\n\n200 Fly\n\nNoah Henderson\n\n50 Free\n\n100 Free\n\n100 Fly\n\nSam Hoover\n\n50 Free\n\n100 Free\n\nOwen Lloyd\n\n800 Free\n\n1500 Free\n\n400 IM\n\nQuintin McCarty\n\n50 Free\n\n100 Free\n\nLuke Miller\n\n100 Free\n\n100 Fly\n\nChase Mueller\n\n200 Free\n\n400 Free\n\nLance Norris\n\n400 Free\n\n800 Free\n\n1500 Free\n\nJames Plage\n\n400 Free\n\n800 Free\n\nKyle Ponsler\n\n200 Back\n\n200 IM\n\n400 IM\n\nDrew Salls\n\n50 Free\n\nHunter Tapp\n\n100 Free\n\n100 Back\n\n200 Back\n\nHudson Williams\n\n100 Free\n\n100 Back\n\nWells Walker\n\n50 Free\n\nINCOMING FRESHMEN\n\nLeah Shackley\n\nLily Christianson\n\nErika Pelaez\n\nKaii Winkler\n\nHudson Schuricht\n\nHudson DeGroote\n\nMatt Marsteiner\n\nCharlie Bufton\n\nALUMNI\n\nRyan Held\n\n50 Free\n\n100 Free\n\n200 Free\n\n100 Fly\n\nJustin Ress\n\n50 Free\n\n100 Free\n\n100 Back"
