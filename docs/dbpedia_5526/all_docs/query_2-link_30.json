        "text": "ELI PHELPS. This section attracted at an early day a superior class of settlers, and their descendants are now among the leading citizens of Hartford county, the enterprising and progressive spirit of their pioneer ancestry being combined in them with the culture and refinement of more modern times. From the first settlement in Windsor town the Phelps family has held a prominent place in its history, its members in every generation showing unwavering loyalty to the American ideal, and during the Revolutionary war no less than twenty of the name enlisted from that locality. Eli Phelps, for many years a prosperous agriculturist of Windsor, was of the fifth generation in direct descent from Samuel Phelps, son of William, the head of the family in this country. Samuel Phelps was born in England, and received a large grant of land in Windsor from the Crown. Much of this tract is still in the possession of his descendants, and a portion of it is now occupied by our subject as a homestead. This worthy pioneer married Sarah Griswold, daughter of Edward Griswold, and had a son, William.\n\n(II) William Phelps, son of Samuel, was born in 1669, married Hannah Hayden in 1693, and died Nov. 21, 1711. He had a son (III) William, born March 13, 1698.\n\n(IV) Eli Phelps, son of William (III), was born Aug. 16, 1746, and made his home on a farm near Poquonock, being one of the most highly respected residents of that locality in his time. He married (first) Ruth Case, who died leaving no children. His second wife Mariam (Case) Adams, was the widow of Joseph Adams, by whom she had three children: Luke, Rosannah and Richard. By her union with Eli Phelps she had six children: Ruth, who married (first) Fredus Case, and (sec-ond) Rev. Phelps Ellsworth; Eli, our subject; Mary (Mrs. Jonathan Colton); Mariam, wife of Elihu Holcomb; Mindwell, who married Manly Snow; and Miss Sarah, who resides in Poquonock.\n\n(V) Hon. Eli Phelps was born at Poquonock, Sept, 1, 1807, and had only such educational advantages as the local schools of that day provided. He was but a young man when his father died, and as the only son the care of the estate fell to him before he had a chance to acquire business experience, yet he managed affairs with conspicuous ability and \"became one of the most successful farmers of the town, obtaining good results under all circumstances. For some years after his marriage he resided at his father's old home, later locating at the farm now occupied by our subject. While he left a handsome estate to his children, he was never grasping or unduly economical, and many worthy enterprises were helped forward by his liberality. He was a man of fine physique, six feet tall, weighing 200 pounds, and his mental ability was above the average, his reading and observation enabling him to gain a wide range of practical knowl-edge. He took an active interest in religious work, serving as treasurer of the Ecclesiastical Society of his town for a long time, and politically he was prominent as a member of the local Democratic organization. At various times he held offices in his town, and for several years he was a member of the General Assembly. He died Sept. 1, 1879, and his remains now rest in the cemetery at Poquonock.\n\nOn May 27, 1846, Mr. Phelps married Miss Abigail Humphrey, who was born March 7, 1820, at Norfolk, Conn., daughter of James and Roxalana (North) Humphrey. Her family has been well known in America from an early period, and an extensive genealogical record has been compiled and published. She is still living at the homestead, in excellent health, for one of her age, and surrounded by a large circle of friends whom her intelligence and high character have won her. William is the eldest of a family of five children; James and Emily died in infancy; Miss Maria resides at the old homestead, and is highly esteemed in the best social circles, being an active member of the society of the Daughters of the American Revolution; and Charlotte A. is the wife of David E. Marshall, of Windsor town.\n\n(VI) WILLIAM PHELPS was born Nov. 23, 1847, and was reared at the homestead, his education being obtained in the schools of District No. 8, of Windsor town, at the academy in Windsor village, and the Connecticut Literary Institute, at Suffield. He has always resided on the old home farm, which he manages in a thoroughly scientific manner. While he is an excellent business man he is of a very quiet disposition, deliberate speech and lack of ostentation being among his marked characteristics. His integrity is never questioned, while he has a high reputation for intellectual ability, being extremely fond of reading. In early life he was a Democrat, but of late years he has been an earnest advocate of the principles of the Prohibition party. Mr. Phelps married Miss Mariette Dickinson, of Haddam, Conn., who was a daughter of Nathan and Jemimah (Brainard) Dickinson. She died June 23, 1899.\n\nCommemorative\n\nBiographical Record\n\nof\n\nHartford County,\n\nConnecticut\n\nIllustrated\n\nChicago\n\nJ. H. Beers & Co.\n\n1901\n\npgs 756-757"
