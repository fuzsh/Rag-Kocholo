        "text": "PARIS – Two-time Olympian and Vanderbilt cross country and track and field alumna Lily Williams and Team USA took home a gold medal in the women’s track cycling team pursuit final at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nWilliams and her teammates, Chloe Dygert, Kristen Faulkner and Jennifer Valente bested New Zealand in the final, clocking 4:04.306. The squad finished second behind New Zealand Tuesday and went on to beat Great Britain in Wednesday’s first round to qualify for the gold medal round.\n\nThis is Williams’ second Olympic medal; she and the United States brought home bronze from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Vandy’s first female Olympian, she is now just the second Commodore to win Olympic gold. Jeff Turner (men’s basketball) was the first in 1984.\n\nFans can follow Vanderbilt cross country and track & field at @VandyXCTrack."
