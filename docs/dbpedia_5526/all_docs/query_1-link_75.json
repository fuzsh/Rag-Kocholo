        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Nathan Adrian felt a little strange walking around the pool during the U.S. National Championships.\n\nMichael Phelps wasn't there last week. Port Orange's Ryan Lochte was missing, too. And for the first time in almost two decades, when the American long-course world championship team was announced, neither of its biggest stars appeared.\n\n\"It's weird, really weird,\" Adrian said. \"I'd been focused on swimming for so long, and then it was about swimming fast and then it was like you're a veteran and then you look at it now and it's like you're one of the leaders of the team. It feels like it was only a few years ago I was nipping on the heels of Jason Lezak.\"\n\nActually, it was eight years ago that Adrian captured his first national title.\n\nBut things change, and the search for new American leadership is starting all over again.\n\nFrom Mark Spitz and John Naber in the 1970s to Matt Biondi and Rowdy Gaines in the 1980s, this changing of the guard has become relatively routine and virtually seamless. This time, it will be a more dramatic transition.\n\nPhelps qualified for his first Olympics as a gangly teenager in 2000. From the point on, he, Lochte or both have represented the U.S. at every Olympics or long-course world championship through the Rio Games last summer. Adrian was right there with them, at all those international meets since 2009.\n\nSo with Phelps retired and Lochte suspended, Adrian is in line to become the next face of the U.S. men's team.\n\n\"He was a leader in Rio and I think he'll be the leader till he's done,\" 20-year-old Townley Haas said.\n\nIt won't be easy, but nobody is more qualified right now than the 28-year-old Washington native.\n\nHe owns five Olympic gold medals, has a smile that shines as brightly as any of them and a charisma that has made him one of the most popular swimmers. He apprenticed under Phelps and Lochte and, yes, even Lezak. A year ago, he was one of three captains on the men's Olympic team.\n\nToday, he's the only one heading to Budapest, Hungary.\n\nThe truth is, Adrian can't do it alone.\n\n\"Those two are very big personalities,\" said U.S. men's coach David Durden, who also coaches college powerhouse California. \"You're not going to fill that void of Michael Phelps, for sure. We're trying to get him back in the water for 2020. But we don't need someone to be a Michael Phelps. We need them to be themselves and that's something we'll work on. We'll miss Ryan, as well, because he's that versatile guy who keeps it really light. We'll miss that personality and want it back in 2018.\""
