        "text": "After the American men’s 4×100-meter relay team won gold, Michael Phelps reached down to help anchorman Nathan Adrian out of the pool.\n\nWhile he did it, millions of Americans watching at home saw several purple dots on his back and shoulder.\n\nSome kind of new tattoo? Did he take a nap on a bed of tennis balls?\n\nNo, the circles are the result of cupping, a traditional Chinese therapy technique that athletes use to help their muscles recover and perform at their best. It involves a therapist heating small glass cups, then placing them on the skin and pulling them from the body to loosen and relax the muscles.\n\nMichael Phelps has been using it regularly for a while.\n\nCupping therapy dates back centuries and has enjoyed a bit of a renaissance over the past decade after athletes like Phelps and NFL star DeMarcus Ware and actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston started touting its benefits.\n\nResearchers have traced cupping’s origins back to China and Greece somewhere around 1500 B.C.\n\nTeam USA gymnast Alex Naddour was among other Olympians who have been seen with the purple marks in Rio. And it’s not just for star athletes. Health spas often offer the service for a few hundred dollars and the cups can be purchased online for as little as $15 and applied at home.\n\n“I’ve done it before meets at pretty much every meet I go to,” Michael said.\n\nThe treatment involves applying glass or plastic cups to the area of discomfort and either applying heat or suction to create a vacuum. The suction pulls the skin away from the muscle and draws oxygenated blood to the area. The suction also is what causes the bruising, like a giant hickey without the fun that comes with it.\n\nSteve Hamilton, a massage therapist for the Denver Broncos, has used the technique for years in working with players. He said the biggest benefits include increased circulation, decreased muscle tension, decreased inflammation, increased range of motion and improved blood flow.\n\n“Its effectiveness is because it’s all part of the body’s natural healing process,” Hamilton said. “But cupping helps the body recover faster by keeping the process moving forward. It’s awesome because it’s all natural,” he said, “it helps enhance the body’s natural neurological and circulatory function, thus allowing the body to be pushed and perform at a higher competitive level.”\n\nPhelps even included the process, which can be painful, in a commercial he did for Under Armour on the rigorous training he puts his body through to get ready to compete. When he is competing in an event where victory is measured in fractions of a second, any little edge could make the difference.\n\nLike many forms of manual therapy, the effectiveness of cupping has been hard to prove from clinical evidence. Though a research in 2015 showed cupping therapy may be beneficial for pain-related conditions, such as acne or facial paralysis. However, a firm scientific conclusion could not be drawn due to the insufficient number of included reviews and low quality of the original studies."
