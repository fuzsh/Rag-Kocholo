        "text": "Fred Phelps rose to fame as the founder and leader of the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas. Born in 1929, Phelps is a controversial figure due to his extremist views and homophobic activism. He attracted public attention by organizing protests and provocative actions, including at funerals of American soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, claiming that their deaths were divine punishment for tolerance of homosexuality in the United States .\n\nHis radical methods, which include placards with hateful content and offensive slogans, have led to a number of lawsuits and provoked strong reactions from the government and society. Although his fame was primarily built on controversy and public outrage, Fred Phelps was also denounced as an extreme example of religious fanaticism and intolerance.\n\nFred Phelps was an American Baptist minister best known as the founder of the Westboro Baptist Church, a radical extremist sect. Born in 1929, Phelps spent most of his life promoting homophobic and misogynistic ideology, making his group a bastion of hatred and discrimination. Phelps and his supporters were best known for their offensive and hateful protests, where they held up signs with offensive content at funerals of soldiers, public figures, and events such as concerts or political demonstrations. Their main goal was to condemn homosexuality, which they considered an unforgivable sin.\n\nThese behaviors earned Fred Phelps and his church a notorious and infamous reputation throughout the United States. Although his actions sparked widespread outrage, Phelps and his church invoked free speech to justify their despicable behavior and continue to perpetuate their message of hatred and discrimination. Fred Phelps died in 2014, but his legacy of hatred remains ingrained in history and serves as a constant reminder of the need to combat intolerance and promote compassion and respect for all.\n\nGenealogical research concerning the public figure Fred Phelps\n\nFred Phelps was a famous American pastor and activist, known for his involvement in the founding of the Westboro Baptist Church and for his controversial ideas. Born November 13, 1929, in Meridian, Mississippi, he was the son of John Samuel Phelps and Catherine Johnston. Fred Phelps’ ancestors were largely European migrants, coming primarily from Scotland and England. His maternal great-grandfather, Richard Lewis Johnston, was from Wales. Fred Phelps had six siblings, Mary, John, Ancil, Martha, Margie and Mark. He married Margie Simms on May 25, 1952, with whom he had 13 children: Fred Jr., Mark, Barbara, Shirley, Timothy, Jonathan, Benjamin, Rebekah, James, Nathan, Elizabeth, Rachel and Josiah. Among them, several followed in their father’s footsteps and played an active role in the Westboro church. The genealogy of Fred Phelps is therefore marked by his European heritage and the transmission of his ideas through his descendants."
