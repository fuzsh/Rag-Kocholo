        "text": "As June turns to July, two veteran NASA test pilots are enjoying a slightly longer stay at the International Space Station. This delay in returning to earth will allow engineers to fix problems on their Boeing Starliner capsule, problems that arose on their June 5 trip to the orbiting laboratory. Delayed or not, what is the experience of life like 250 miles above terra firma? Such was the focus of the \"Live From Space: NASA Astronauts & Your Work in Orbit\" panel at SXSW 2024. In addition to three speakers on-stage in Austin, this session featured a live remote Q&A from NASA astronauts Jeanette Epps and Loral O'Hara. Watch the video of this session via the SXSW YouTube page: https://lnkd.in/gd-9R_3p What excites you most about the various projects in which NASA is currently involved? SpaceX or Blue Origin or someone else -- which of the private space companies has the best vision for the future? How does the addition of new international players change the space game? Speaking proposals about space exploration are a great fit for the SXSW PanelPicker (often these fit into the \"2050\" track). Please get your interstellar idea for March March 2025 into this interface before the process closes at the end of the day on Sunday, July 21. panelpicker.sxsw.com/about #sxsw, #sxsw2024, #sxsw2025, #space, #spaceexploration, NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration, #creativity, #innovation, #future, Leah Cheshier, Johnson Space Center, Jeanette Epps, PhD, Kristin Fabre, #NASA, #speaking, #publicspeaking, #speakingopportunities, #PanelPicker, #BoeingStarliner\n\n\"It has been a year since NASA's Orion #spacecraft reentered the atmosphere after completing a 1.4 million-mile journey around the #moon. To celebrate the completion of this historic mission, NASA has released a new reentry video showing exactly what the spacecraft saw on its way back down to #Earth's surface. NASA shared the #video on Twitter and included a link to the full Orion reentry video for anyone who wants to see it in its entirety. The Orion spacecraft was a massive part of the #Artemis I mission, and the entirety of its purpose was to see just how well the spacecraft would handle travel through space. With Artemis I proving so successful, #NASA is already looking forward to Artemis II, which will see #astronauts aboard the spacecraft as it travels to the moon and back. They won't actually set down on our planet's satellite, but it will help prove that Orion is worthy of carrying the next set down to the Moon's surface with Artemis III. Remembering these past missions is important because it helps us understand the lengths that astronomers and engineers have gone to to make these kinds of missions possible. The full-length video of #Orion's reentry into Earth's atmosphere is 25 minutes long, and it showcases the spacecraft slowly falling towards the Earth's surface before it hits the atmosphere once again. Once it hits the atmosphere, hot flames can be seen behind it, created by the friction of the spacecraft falling through our planet's protective shell. It's an intriguing view that shows just how powerful the force of reentry can be, and you can even hear the sounds of the spacecraft as it completes its reentry. You can even see pieces of the ablative heat shield that was fixed to the outside of the vehicle breaking off due to the extreme heat and friction caused by the reentry.\" NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration video: https://lnkd.in/eUKunqs4\n\nThis is the Earth from the Nasa Artemis spacecraft, it's a barely visible pale blue dot. We're all here rotating around a star at 67,100 mph (107,807 km/h) in a neighborhood of 8 planets in a galaxy with 100 billion or more stars. Think about that a single species on a single planet in the vast expanse of space all alone. That one planet is the only one we have and it's dying in the midst of an ongoing ecological catastrophe one that we are solely responsible for. This is the sixth mass extinction event the Earth has experienced one called the \"Anthropocene extinction\" event. Whole major ecosystems and regions of the world will be rendered uninhabitable. When will we wake up and realize we must rise together united as a species and save the planet for future generations? https://lnkd.in/eyfNAiV7"
