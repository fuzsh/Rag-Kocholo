        "text": "Craftsbury is excited to have 16 college athletes participating in this summer’s GRP Under-23 (U23) sculling program.\n\nThis was a hard year for these and all college athletes who had their spring seasons canceled due to COVID-19. Some of our U23s already have had their 2020 fall seasons changed or canceled. Sadly, others have been notified that their programs have been cut by their universities. We feel deeply for them, and we hope this summer at Craftsbury will be a bright spot in an otherwise difficult year. We are really excited to have these 16 bubbly go-getters join the GRP this summer!\n\nThey are coached by the talented duo of Nicole Ritchie and Steve Whelpley.\n\nNathan Phelps of Ridgefield, Connecticut, is a rising junior at Princeton University. This is his second summer as part of the GRP U23 team. Last summer, Nate was in the men's quad that represented the United States at the U23 World Championships in Sarasota, FL. This summer, he was chosen for the Men's U23 Sweep Selection Camp.\n\nU23 Coach Nicole Ritchie. Nicole isn’t new to Craftsbury. She has coached at Craftsbury summer camps in the past, but this is the first time she is with us for the whole summer, coaching the GRP.\n\nNicole helped coach the senior GRP group this spring in Inverness, Florida, and we are really excited to have her back with the group.\n\nNicole is a Putney, Vermont, native and a highly decorated rower. In 2015, she won silver medals in both the Women’s double and Women’s quad events at the Pan American Games. She finished second in the Women’s double at the 2016 U.S. Olympic Trials.\n\nNicole graduated from Bates College in 2009, with a degree in environmental chemistry. While at Bates, she helped deliver two NCAA DIII National Championships and one second- place finish. A three-time first-team All American, Nicole was captain of the women's rowing team-and was captain of the nordic ski team, too.\n\nAfter graduating from Bates, she rowed for seven years in Philadelphia, PA, for Vesper Boat Club. During her years as an elite rower, she also coached in the Philadelphia area. In 2016, after retiring from elite rowing, Nicole joined Temple University as a graduate assistant coach. While coaching the women's rowing team, she completed her master’s degree.\n\nWe are happy to have Nicole here with us this summer!"
