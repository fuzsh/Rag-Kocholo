        "text": "Mississippi-born Rev. Fred Phelps, who founded the Westboro Baptist Church, died in hospice care today at age 84.\n\nThe Westboro Baptist Church, in Topeka, Kansas, is known for protesting military funerals while holding signs with negative sentiments, such as \"God Hates You\" and \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers.\" His teachings blame homosexuality for tragedy in the world, saying God is punishing mankind for its sin.\n\nThe website of the church, godhatesfags.com, states that the church’s mission is to showing Americans their transgression and abominations.\n\nHe recently has been in hospice care at a Shawnee County, KS, facility.\n\nWestboro released a statement on Twitter Thursday telling the world that, essentially, Phelps’ work will go on.\n\n“So – the death of Fred Phelps’ body, a man who preached a plain faithful doctrine to an ever darkening world, is nothing but a vain, empty, hypocritical hope for you,” the statement reads. “It’s like every journalist in the world simultaneously set aside what little journalistic integrity they have, so that they could wait breathlessly for a rumor to publish: in-fighting, succession plans, and power struggles, oh my! How shameful! You’re like a bunch of little girls on the playground waiting for some gossip!”\n\nThe church has said they’re not likely to hold a funeral for their former leader. A church member, Margie Phelps, Tweeted earlier this year that the church does not hold memorials.\n\n“We don't worship the dead in this church, so there'd be no public memorial or funeral to picket if any member died,” she wrote.\n\nNathan Phelps, who has been estranged from his father for 37 years, told the Topeka Capital-Journal that Fred Phelps’ death could pose a philosophical crisis to the church, because they \"think that death is a judgment from God.\"\n\n\"So far, that illusion has held because none of them has passed,\" Nathan Phelps said.\n\nThe family has, however, asked that people respect Fred Phelps passing, and when asked about whether he thought people would picket his father’s funeral, Nate Phelps said, “I wish they wouldn’t.”\n\nThe same group of Satanists who held an erotic ceremony to turn Fred Phelps’ mother gay after her death also promised earlier this week to do the same for Fred Phelps when he passes.\n\nIn July, members of the New York-based Satanic Temple, an organization with a goal of supporting “freedom and the pursuit of happiness for all people,” took a stance against the Westboro Baptist Church by making its own visit to Meridian to perform a “Pink Mass” ceremony at the Meridian grave of Phelps’ mother, Catherine Johnston, to turn her “gay forever.”\n\nLucien Greaves, spokesperson for the Satanic Temple, told reporters that at the time of the Pink Mass on Phelps mother’s grave, he promised the Westboro congregation that he would soon preside over Phelps’ own Pink Mass.\n\n“The pomp and circumstance of this Pink Mass will surely far, far exceed that of the original event in Meridian, Mississippi,” he said.\n\nNate Phelps said in a Facebook post earlier this week that his father was excommunicated from the church in August.\n\nOn the FAQ page, the question “Has Fred Phelps been ‘excluded’ from membership at Westboro Baptist Church?” is answered simply: “Membership issues are private.”\n\nThe Huffington Post reported that Nate Phelps said that Fred Phelps was ejected following an argument between a board of male elders and spokeswoman Shirley Phelps-Roper. Fred Phelps reportedly called for \"kinder treatment of fellow church members.”\n\nAllegedly that got him ex-communicated from the church he built.\n\nNate Phelps has expressed mixed emotions about his father’s condition.\n\n“I’m not sure how I feel about this. Terribly ironic that his devotion to his god ends this way. Destroyed by the monster he made,” he posted on Facebook.\n\n“I feel sad for all the hurt he’s caused so many. I feel sad for those who will lose the grandfather and father they loved.”\n\nThe Equality House, which sits directly across the street from the Westboro Baptist Church, posted a message of peace on their Facebook page Thursday, saying they were sad to hear of Phelps’ passing, and that they had sent condolences to the family.\n\n“The philosophy of the Equality House has always been to overwhelm hate with unconditional love. A loss of a human life is never a reason to celebrate, even if you have a stark disagreement,” the post said. “Fred was a father, grandfather, and great grandfather that was loved deeply by his family. Let us remember that we are all in this world together and vengeance is never justice.”\n\nSome reports say more than 20 of Phelps’ family members have left the church. Some of them, including Nate Phelps, have gone on to become activists for the gay community.\n\nFred Phelps was born in Meridian in 1929, and founded the Westboro Baptist Church in 1955. His church’s actions led to at least two federal and several state laws restricting protests during military funerals.\n\nThen-President George W. Bush signed the Respect for America’s Fallen Heroes Act into law in 2006. In 2007, then-Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius signed a bill establishing a 150-foot no-picketing buffer around funerals.\n\nSince then, eight other states have enacted similar laws and 10 more are considering it.\n\nIn 2012, President Barack Obama signed a law that requires a 300-foot and two-hour buffer zone for military funerals.\n\nIn recent years, Westboro has visited Mississippi for the funeral of fallen Marine Jason Rogers, as well as to picket the movie “The Blind Side.”\n\nIn a release about the film protest, Westboro members stated all Ole Miss football players will go to hell. The Ole Miss protest came the day after a church members protested at Graceland, Elvis Presley’s former mansion in Memphis.\n\nBefore founding the Westboro Church, Phelps was a disbarred lawyer who founded the Phelps Chartered law firm. He married Margie M. Phelps in May 1952. He leaves 13 children and 54 grandchildren."
