        "text": "‘Men Between Worlds’: End of Unprecedented Era of Nathan Adrian, Anthony Ervin, Ryan Lochte, Matt Grevers, Cullen Jones and Michael Phelps\n\nIt appears to be the end of an era in men’s swimming in the United States.\n\nIt was known as the “Phelps Era” for so long, but the era was so much more — it was a Golden Era in men’s swimming.\n\nAt the recent United States Olympic Trials, we bid farewell — at least on the main stage — to Ryan Lochte, Matt Grevers and Anthony Ervin.\n\nMeanwhile, Nathan Adrian finished third in the 50 free to just miss a spot in Tokyo — and could still hold onto that mainstage speed a bit longer.\n\nBut it was definitely the end of an era in Omaha for this group.\n\n“We are the oldest of the fastest and the fastest of the oldest. We are men between worlds,” Ervin said.\n\nThey were the last of the group that transformed swimming, a group that included Michael Phelps and Cullen Jones, who each left the big stage after 2016. The group made its entrance to the world stage in 2000 and has become a staple for longevity, with each of the six swimming well into their 30s and five of them swimming on the big stage after becoming fathers.\n\nThat is completely unprecedented in swimming.\n\n“I think we are just showing the younger generation that you can do whatever you want for as long as you want. There are certain things that you’ve got to sacrifice and do outside of the pool and inside the pool that are different than when you were 20 years old, but you can go as long as you want,” Lochte said.\n\nPhelps obviously brought a lot of recognition to the era, winning a record eight gold medals at the Beijing Olympics, and totaling a stunning 28 career Olympic medals — including a record 23 gold — spanning five Olympics.\n\nIt is easy to overlook the greatness of the others in the group, which totaled 33 Olympic medals — including 20 gold not including Phelps. With Phelps, they won 61 Olympic medals, 43 of them gold.\n\nLochte is in the top three all time. He still holds the world record in the 200 IM and was a four-time Olympian, winning 12 Olympic medals, including six golds.\n\nNathan Adrian was a three-time Olympian, earning eight Olympic medals, including five gold, anchoring multiple U.S. relays to gold and winning the 100 free in London.\n\nMatt Grevers was a two-time Olympian, narrowly missing a third. He won five medals, including four gold and had a revered leadership role on the team.\n\nAnthony Ervin was a three-time Olympian, including a stunning span from 2000 to 2012 before making the team again in 2016. He won four medals, including three gold, winning the 50 freestyle twice.\n\n“Nathan was my teammate for years. Iron sharpens iron and we tested all the time. He is a champion. You see that in his conduct,” Ervin said. “Ryan and I had a great conversation the other day sharing our (memories) and plans and it had a lot of laughs and contemplation. What he has planning for the future is a beautiful thing. Cullen, it has been a real pleasure to work with him on Team Black.”\n\nCullen Jones, who is transforming inclusion within the sport, won four Olympic medals including two gold on relays and the silver medal in the 50 freestyle. He was the first African-American to hold a world record and, along with Ervin, is leading the charge for change in the sport.\n\nThey also brought stunning relay success to the U.S. with all six swimming multiple relays at the Olympics with at least one other member of the group, if not more.\n\nPlus they gave swimming fans — even the casual, only Olympic-time fans — consistent faces of dominance on the world’s stage and built an unparalleled camaraderie with this era.\n\n“One thing about swimming that I love, you are a family. Because we are all close together. (Grevers, Adrian), Anthony Ervin, Michael Phelps, Cullen Jones, they’re my brothers. We keep in contact all the time, and like I said, we are a family. Being in that generation with them, in that era, means everything. You are never going to forget that. You will take that to your grave.”\n\nSwimming fans won’t forget this era, either.\n\nIt was the era that produced the best swimmer in history, the best group in history and a band of brothers that transformed swimming into more than just an Olympic sport.\n\nAnd while they were doing that, they were inspiring a new generation of swimmers to keep the legacy going.\n\n“If I am being honest I am not ready for a team without Nathan and those big guys,” Caeleb Dressel said. “I was really rooting for Nathan. Their impact is huge. They left behind some really big shoes to fill. I am not ready for it but I am going to have to be. What they left behind is huge — monumental.”\n\nAnd that says it all about this group. They care more about how they pass the torch than what they accomplish. That example will ensure swimming is in good hands for years to come.\n\nAs Lochte put it: “That means more than any gold medal.”"
