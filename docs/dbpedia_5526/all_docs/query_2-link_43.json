Although questions and doubts may be raised about his significance in American history, Nathan will always represent the values exemplified by the words patriotism, loyalty, and self-sacrifice. And these values were not only his, but his family’s, his neighbors’, and his fellow colonists’.\n\nNathan’s nephew David Hale Jr., cofounder of what is today’s Wall Street Journal, once wrote: There is nothing romantic about the life of Nathan Hale. . . . He was a simple-hearted, well-educated, intelligent country youth, always doing what he thought right; and that in those days was nothing singular.\n\nNathan was considered a hero by many of his fellow patriots and by many authors who wrote about him for history books and novels. In the early twentieth century, George Dudley Seymour was so moved by Nathan’s heroism, he had statues made of him, convinced the post office to issue a stamp in his honor, and restored Nathan’s family homestead, which is now a museum. By the 1960s, Nathan’s significance and authenticity as a hero had been thrown into doubt. He was no longer included in some histories, and the bestselling Don’t Know Much About History (1990) states that Hale’s last words are most likely an invention that has become part of the Revolution mythology.\n\nThough his mission failed, Nathan Hale’s significance never hinged on whether he was an effective spy. As President Dwight Eisenhower explained at the time of the bicentennial of Hale’s birth, here was a supreme example of the willingness of an individual to risk death and sacrifice himself for the common good. With this sacrifice, Nathan Hale became a hero and, as such, represented the colony of Connecticut’s significant contribution to the war for independence; he was willing to sacrifice himself for the beliefs that not only he held dear, but that his family, friends, neighbors, and fellow colonists cherished. For this he is a hero and represents others who fought for their beliefs and sacrificed in their own ways for America’s independence.\n\nFor this reason, Nathan Hale’s story should continue to be told.\n\n—BEVERLY LUCAS, CURATOR\n\nConnecticut Landmarks\n\nHale Homestead Museum\n\nNow, as for me, behold me in your hand!\n\nDo to me according to that which is good—yea, according to that which is right—in your eyes!\n\nOnly ye surely know that, if ye are about to put me to death, then ye are surely putting innocent blood upon yourselves. . . .\n\n—JEREMIAH 26: 14–15\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nTHUNDER OF HEAVEN\n\nFROM THE WESTERN FRONT of the green facing Yale College’s Connecticut Hall, a three-story, redbrick building, one could look to the east and manage a squinted glimpse of Long Island Sound and, just over the horizon, the magnificent Atlantic Ocean. Settled in 1638 as Red Mount, New Haven was a thriving colony, steeped in maritime aesthetics and deepseated Christian values, established by its founders on the principles of community, education, economics, and, of course, religion. It was here, in the thick of the city near Chapel Street, that two teenage classmates left the Yale campus on a summer day in 1772 en route to New Haven harbor. ¹\n\nTo passersby, the students blended into the milieu of the city as if they had lived in New Haven all their lives. But neither scholar had grown up in town. One of the boys, Nathan Hale, the son of an affluent deacon and farmer, lived sixty miles north in the hills of Connecticut. Having spent the past three years studying at Yale, Nathan held an idealistic view of the city; its tradition of political discourse and fidelity to Christianity fell right into what he—indeed, nearly all colonists—had been raised to believe: that in God all things were possible.²\n\nStill, beyond a visit to the house of the school’s resident physcian, Dr. Eneas Munson, the local tavern, or a shopkeeper nearby, Nathan rarely ventured beyond the surrounding neighborhood, keeping the majority of his socializing confined to campus.³\n\nNathan and his classmate Isaac Gridley were headed to New Haven harbor, a bustling seaport, situated along the jagged coastline between Stamford and Saybrook. There, merchants sold colonial goods—mainly sugar, pewter, nails, timber, fishing gear, compasses, sextants—and coopers and shiphands loitered about the docks in search of work, while businessmen kept tabs on their coastal offices and warehouses. The first Puritans to settle in New Haven 150 years earlier felt there was great value in such a sprawling seaside community and hoped to monopolize what they viewed as a prominent commercial port on the East Coast. The problem became, however, that New York was but a half day’s sail south, Boston a day’s sail north. Both were larger cities, with much more to offer seafaring merchants and importers. Yet even though their immediate plan for financial success failed, the harbor prospered and sustained a growing economy over the years, providing a viable tract of land and a tenable backdrop for the neatly painted frame houses of many of the town’s influencial families dotted about the ribboned countryside overlooking the harbor.⁴\n\nIt had turned cloudy by the time seventeen-year-old Nathan and his fifteen-year-old classmate reached the shoreline. Undeterred by the gray skies above, they pushed a sloop out into the water and, with their backs to the wind, jumped aboard for what they assumed was going to be an afternoon of leisurely sailing.⁵\n\nBut soon after their voyage began, the weather turned volatile and violent. Waves crashed up over the bow of the small sloop as Gridley, certainly worried they wouldn’t make it back to shore without being swallowed up by the choppy waters, looked to Nathan for guidance and comfort.\n\nWith the confidence he had acquired while becoming one of Yale’s top thirteen scholars, Nathan said, I will never be drowned.⁶\n\nTo Gridley, Nathan appeared too sure of himself, as if he knew—and firmly believed—that dying in the midst of a storm at sea was not in God’s plan for him. Nathan’s words did little to suppress Gridley’s trepidation; it thundered and lightning cracked in flashing bolts around them.\n\nManeuvering the vessel back to shore, Nathan explained why he was so certain they would make it in safely. He pointed to a blemish on his neck, beckoning Gridley to have a closer look.\n\nA childhood friend of Nathan’s, Asher Wright, who would become his close ally and camp attendant during the Revolutionary War, later described Nathan’s pockmark as a large hair mole on his neck. A mole on one’s neck was a sign of bad luck. If one had a hair growing from that mole, it further indicated that death by hanging was in your future.⁷ Reflecting back on his life with Nathan, Wright added, In his boyhood, his playmates sometimes twitted him about [the mole], telling him he would be hanged.⁸\n\nApparently, Nathan Hale believed it to some extent—because as he and Gridley, surely drenched from the heavy rains, pulled the boat ashore, Nathan spoke of it again. He pointed to the slightly elevated mole on his neck and again said he knew he wasn’t going to drown. Gridley wanted to know how his friend could be so certain.\n\nI am to be hung, Nathan lamented.⁹\n\nChapter 1\n\nTHE RIGHTEOUS AND PATRIOTIC MAN\n\nTHE FIERY COLORS OF leaves burst around New England during the fall of 1769. Fifteen-year-old Enoch and fourteen-year-old Nathan straddled their horses and began what was a sixty-mile journey to New Haven. They had been lectured by their father, Richard Hale, regarding the vices of living in a city far from his supervision. Richard probably told the boys to mind their studies and seek guidance in the word of God while away from home. For Nathan and Enoch, it was the first time they had left home alone, beyond a brief visit to their uncle Strong’s in Salmon Brook, or a trip into Hartford, Norwich, or Windham for supplies with their father.\n\nRichard Hale had little to worry about. He had raised well-behaved, mindful, disciplined children. Richard had lofty religious morals and expected no less from members of his family. He could trust that when confronted with the pressures of college life, Nathan and Enoch would make the right choices. The Hale children were said to have been brought up under the fear of God, drilled by their father on the particulars of right and wrong. In colonial Connecticut, church and state were not separate. Attending church was not a right—but a requirement of the law. Richard understood that God was the source of all life. Without putting the Lord’s word first, nothing else was possible; and whatever happened in life, he told the children many times, was God’s plan. Never question His Divine Word.\n\nRichard had instilled these ideals in his children at every opportunity. During the Sabbath, for example, the Hales would not have had a fire burning in keeping with Richard’s rule of respecting the sacred day (in winter months, a fire would be banked, the massive granite cooking stone kept warm, but cooking was not allowed on Sundays). As a child, Nathan liked to play the board game morris, which is similar to checkers, with his brothers, but Richard, thinking the diversion might lead to evil, disallowed it. Once, while reading, Richard fell asleep with a candle burning in his hand. Nathan and his siblings, who had waited for their father to doze off, huddled like campers and played the game in the candlelight around the chair.¹\n\nBoth Enoch and Nathan were prepared for Yale by Dr. Joseph Huntington, who held classes at his home, two miles from the Hale family farm. Huntington was not only a friend and neighbor of Richard Hale’s, but a well-respected minister and renowned scholar in the small community of Coventry. The two boys were fortunate in their preceptor, Hale family expert George Dudley Seymour said of Huntington, urbanity in an ‘Age of Homespun,’ a classic scholar.²\n\nNathan became an exceptional student and enjoyed being tutored. His manners were honed by Huntington, who taught Nathan how to truly study the Gospels and also encouraged him to read biographies of Cyrus the Great and Philip of Macedon. Only thirty-three years of age when he tutored Nathan, Huntington, a man of solid learning and exemplary piety, wrote historian Robert Waln Jr., had received a liberal education from a line of distinguished relatives and siblings. His brother Samuel would sign the Declaration of Independence in the coming years and serve in the Continental Congress. Licensed as a reverend on June 20, 1763, Huntington took over the Congregational Church near downtown Coventry a short while later.³\n\n[Reverend Huntington] found his parish, Franklin Bowditch Dexter wrote in 1896, on his settlement, in a somewhat disorganized state; and was able to unite the people to an unexpected degree, though the entire period of his ministry was one of spiritual declension.⁴\n\nWhen Huntington’s first wife died at twenty-nine after just a brief illness, he married into the Hale family, taking the hand of Elizabeth, a relative of Richard’s from Glastonbury. As far as Richard Hale could discern, he could not have found a better scholar to educate his children and prepare them for college. People were attached to Huntington, and Nathan and Enoch, studying with him day in and day out, cared deeply for the man and carried on in his image.⁵\n\nThe Yale College Nathan and Enoch came upon after their forty-eight-hour ride was a stunning sight for two kids accustomed to the confines of a farming village such as Coventry. The boys’ conception of a large body of water, for instance, had, until then, been Lake Wangumbaug, a 373-acre basin—known as the Great Pond—north of the Hale farm near the center of town. In contrast, the Yale campus was a short walk from the Atlantic Ocean, where the New Haven common housed two Congregational churches alongside one Episcopal, which surely set the tone for Yale’s Christian curriculum.\n\nRichard had secured bonds for each of his sons to cover the college’s quarterly bills. Tuition was twelve shillings per year for each boy, an amount Richard couldn’t come up with immediately in cash, but could certainly afford, based on the earnings of his farm. Enoch and Nathan already had a broad knowledge of Cicero, Virgil, and other classical writers, as well as a complete understanding of the New Testament in Greek. Among the tutors Nathan and Enoch could look forward to studying under were John Trumbull, the painter and son of future Connecticut governor Jonathan Trumbull Sr.; John Davenport, whose father was one of the founders of New Haven; Timothy Dwight, who would become Yale’s president; and Dr. Nathan Strong, a Hale relative from their mother’s side.⁶\n\nYale was a fairly modernized school, structured after—albeit in competition with—Harvard. There was room to board sixty students, most of whom had enrolled to study theology, inside thirty-two bedchambers. Connecticut Hall, where Nathan and Enoch would spend the better part of the next four years, was a three-floored building on top of a large, spacious cellar. Several of the floors inside the structure were devoted almost exclusively to dormitory space, with sixty-two rooms designated for study.⁷\n\nAfter finding a stable master near campus to put up their horses for the night and return them to Coventry the following day, Nathan and Enoch settled into their rooms inside Connecticut Hall.\n\nAny notion the boys might have had of an easier life at Yale was soon removed. Much to their dismay, the prayer bell rang at 4:30 A.M. the first morning (during winter months, students were afforded an extra hour’s sleep). The bell’s tolling before sunrise reminded students that, before anything else, scholars were expected to greet the day by dropping to their knees and connecting with God. After a brief time of private prayer, it was off to the chapel next door for daily service. Then they marched in rows into the courtyard and down to the College Commons for breakfast. Many students routinely complained the food there was overpriced and bland.⁸\n\nA day’s studies consisted of courses in Greek, Latin, and, occasionally, Hebrew. Some attention was given to logic and rhetoric, Charles Swain Hall wrote in his biography of Benjamin Tallmadge, one of Nathan and Enoch’s close friends and classmates, but many of the subjects were oriented to provide a preliminary training for the ministry.\n\nThat goal inspired Enoch to endure the often strict guidelines of the school’s religious policies and class structure. Nathan, however, was thinking of tutoring as a profession, but had left the door open to anything—that is, except the ministry. In a world of males bred to be involved in church leadership, his turning his back on religion as a vocation gave him a reputation, whether he wanted it or not. Yale College was organized under a rigid rule of discipline, Henry Sheldon wrote in his study of colonial student life and customs, particularly the relation between professor and student, [which] likewise made for some strong form of association. . . . Like its English prototype, the colonial college was pervaded with a strong ecclesiastical flavour.\n\nOn Mondays, students were expected to summarize sermons from Sunday. Tutors and Yale’s president, Naphtali Daggett, dressed in customary gownlike black robes and powder-white wigs. The wigs were not at all that shocking to Nathan or Enoch. Back home, Richard would don his familiar gray hairpiece on special occasions.⁹\n\nFor the next four years, aside from a few brief visits back home to Coventry, Yale would be Nathan’s home. Unbeknownst to him, he would never return to Coventry to live again, but would leave Yale a distinguished scholar. Before then, temptations of mischief during his formative years of college life would ultimately get the best of him.\n\nTwo years after settling in Coventry in 1744, twenty-nine-year-old Richard Hale married seventeen-year-old Elizabeth Strong. If Richard had wanted to marry into a respected, wealthy, and established family, the Strongs were certainly one of the more affluent. Elizabeth’s father, Captain Joseph Strong, had been a justice of the peace, leading townsman and treasurer, and represented Coventry in Connecticut’s General Assembly for sixty-five sessions. He displayed a lively outlook even at an advanced age, chairing town meetings well into his nineties.¹⁰\n\nRichard’s great-grandfather, Robert, had set sail with family members from Kent, England, to America during the early 1600s, shortly after the Mayflower landed. Robert Hale settled in Charlestown, Massachusetts. Both he and his wife, née Joanna Cutler, were among the original members of the First Church of Boston. Robert held many jobs throughout his life, which his descendants, as they began to journey into Connecticut and northern New England, carried on through generations: blacksmith, deacon, carpenter, and surveyor of the many new plantations being bought up throughout the Northeast.¹¹\n\nThe earliest Hale most often highlighted by his contemporaries in literature, although often misrepresented, was Richard’s grandfather, who established his family in Beverly, Massachusetts. The Reverend John Hale, at fifty-four, served as a chaplain, despite the protests of his congregation, during an ill-fated New England expedition into Canada in 1690, during which time he was captured in a roundup of suspected rabble-rousers one day and thrown in prison. Released two years later, John returned to Salem, Massachusetts, to find the town embroiled in a witchhunt. John was in attendance for many of the trials, participated in the religious exercises, and sanctioned—at least during the early days—many of the executions. At first, John believed he was doing the work of God and his community. But as the trials continued, it seemed some women in town were pulling people they didn’t favor out of their homes and accusing them of witchcraft. The Reverend John’s sentiment changed for good when his wife, Sarah Noyes, was herself dragged in and charged as a witch. The accusations in town were unrelenting, and although her case never came to trial, Sarah’s reputation took an enormous blow.\n\nBefore his death on May 15, 1700, the Harvard-educated reverend wrote a book about his Salem witch-trial experiences, A Modest Inquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft, published a year after his death. In it, he noted, The object sought unto is the devil, or another God . . . some of the Heathen did not [s]eek to the devil, as a devil, that is, as a malicious, wicked, and unclean spirit; but as to their God whom they thought ought to be worshipped by them. Reading John’s various papers on the Salem witch trials, one gets a sense that he was speaking from a rather progressive standpoint for the time. He believed the possessed victim was influenced by the devil, not that the witch had impregnated these specters in the victim by casting spells.\n\nThe subject of Sarah’s part in witchcraft was a terrifying but fascinating topic in Deacon [Richard] Hale’s own household, Hale family expert George Dudley Seymour wrote in his 1933 history of Nathan Hale and Major John Palsgrave Wyllys. In Seymour’s opinion, Nathan and his siblings thought it something of a distinction to have had a great-grandmother accused of being a witch. Today’s historians, with a clearer understanding of the Hale household, would disagree with Seymour, however. I don’t think the Hale family would have wanted it discussed, Linda Pagliuco later noted. \"They were very religious—and many of those who believed in witches were religious. I think they would not have wanted to discuss Sarah outside of the family, and doubt that they even knew the facts [of her case] as they are known today.\"¹²\n\nNathan’s eldest sister was Elizabeth Rose Taylor. Her second husband, John, had studied to become a minister, but was never able to find a parish that would accept him. Thus, John opened a tavern in downtown Coventry. Elizabeth ended up spending a majority of her time at the tavern and may have worked as a barmaid. Richard Hale is said to have hated it, Pagliuco added. \"Thus, if Richard was that bothered by his daughter working in a tavern, they probably weren’t going to brag about having a great-grandmother . . . accused of being a witch.\"¹³\n\nA branch of the Hale family tree was closely connected to the founding of Yale. Sarah Noyes’s brother, the Reverend James Noyes, was one of Yale’s original trustees, along with his brother Moses, both Harvard men who were influential in the founding of Yale College.¹⁴\n\nNathan’s mother, Elizabeth, was a fifth-generation Strong, born in Coventry in 1727. Many viewed Elizabeth as a woman of high moral worth, with strong Puritan faith and devoted to the religious culture of her children. She was by all accounts beautiful and had an uncommon strength of character. For Nathan and the other Hale boys to head off to Yale would be no surprise to Elizabeth, who had been born into a family with over a dozen Yale graduates. When Nathan grew up in Coventry, there would have been no shortage of Strongs around to instill in the boy the Christian moral values expected of him as he grew into manhood. The Reverend Nathan Strong, Elizabeth’s second cousin, presided over the meetinghouse in Coventry for five decades as first minister. From his early sermons, a respect for the colonies and the Puritan way of life emerges. Nathan Strong, a man of solid judgment and acute penetration of mind, was widely viewed as an innovator within the growing structure of local churches joining together pre-Revolution. He often quiet[ed] disturbances in sister churches before they became public nuisances. As a child, Nathan listened as the minister espoused the cause of his country, in the War of the Revolution. Even before war broke out, the reverend spoke harshly of the king’s mandates, not to mention the attempts to put a stranglehold on colonial businesses with taxes. He let his congregation know God’s will included standing up and speaking openly about what they believed.¹⁵\n\nThe Strongs and Hales were joined in marriage at the turn of the eighteenth century. The Strong family name carried authority throughout New England. Like the Hales, their ancestors had landed on colonial soil after sailing from Kent, England, and were among the first Puritans to incorporate outer Boston. Soon after crossing the Atlantic in 1630 aboard the Mary-John, John Strong settled south of Boston and helped found the town of Dorchester. From there, the family spread throughout Connecticut and Massachusetts. In 1659, John helped to establish Northampton, a neighboring town in the mountains of western Massachusetts that Enoch would one day call home. Elizabeth’s brother Elnathan Strong settled in Coventry some years later, while Joseph established his family northwest in Salmon Brook.¹⁶\n\nAs soon as they were married, Richard and Elizabeth Hale got busy right away building what would be a sizable home on an initial 240 acres of fertile land in South Coventry, a few miles from where Elizabeth had been born. Within a few years, Elizabeth gave birth to the first of what would be a total of nine sons and three daughters. A son, Jonathon, and one of the daughters, Susannah, died at birth, leaving her with only two daughters to help with the cooking, cleaning, and tailoring.¹⁷\n\nA large section of the Hale farm was devoted to harvesting feed corn and grain for Richard’s cattle business. He also set aside plenty of acreage for flax, used for making cloth. During the French and Indian War, colonial New England lived under a law that mandated farmers to reserve a certain amount of acreage for the production of flax in order to help outfit the army. For the Hales, however, it was also essential to the family. Though each of the boys owned three outfits (at best), because they spent sunup to sundown playing in and working the fields, they went through clothes quickly. Hemp was another important commodity. As far back as the mid-1600s, early colonial governments legislated colonies to grow as much hemp and flax as they could, putting servants and children to work spinning yarn in their idle hours, historian Margaret Ellen Newell wrote, and offering bounties for finished linen and cloth. Later, when the Revolution drew closer, England made it clear that it did not want colonists to make their own cloth; Americans were supposed to buy English products. The Hales supported any colonial effort to break from England and did their part by harvesting extra crops of flax to sustain the colonial army’s needs.¹⁸\n\nThe sixth child in the Hale family, Nathan was born on June 6, 1755, while Richard was out working with his men. While they tilled the fields, the anxiety over his baby got the best of Richard as he periodically dropped his tools and snapped orders. Throughout the morning he had been taking frequent trips back to the house as Nathan’s mother, Elizabeth, lay on her back struggling through the birth. But when it at last happened, Richard was said to be bending over a furrow. A woman servant helping Elizabeth inside the house suddenly ran . . . from the kitchen down the long slope in the back of the house and reported to Richard. With the news, he addressed his men, The Lord be praised for the mother and the child. Let him be a worthy servant, before cutting them loose for the day to do as you will with your time. As Richard and the servant rushed back to the house, the servant asked him if he was going to name the child a junior. He shall be called after that righteous and patriotic man, my kinsman Nathan, and I shall be well pleased if he have as high a sense of duty, answered Nathan’s proud father.¹⁹\n\nNathan was feeble in body at the beginning of his life, Benson Lossing wrote. Despite being born underweight and, in subsequent days, given very little promise of surviving the period, he surprised everyone and grew into a brawny, muscular child. During that critical second year, Lossing noted, Elizabeth’s fifth son rebounded into a robust child, physically and mentally.²⁰\n\nTwo months before Nathan turned twelve, the first of many tragedies struck the Hale household. The Hale’s twelfth child, Susannah, was born in February 1767, but died a few weeks later. Then, on April 27, 1767, Nathan’s mother, Elizabeth, lost her life due to the complications from giving birth to Susannah. Although the family revered the Bible as the voice of God and perhaps viewed Elizabeth’s and Susannah’s deaths as part of the Lord’s plan, Nathan was overwhelmed by both losses, his mother’s probably more so than that of a sister he had never really known. He and Elizabeth had been close. She had sat and told Nathan many stories about Yale, from her many family members that attended the school. Because Nathan had struggled with life early on, he and Elizabeth had, by merely spending so much time together, bonded. But now she was gone. And just like that, Nathan and his siblings were motherless.²¹\n\nAt the time of Elizabeth’s death, Richard Hale had eight small children to raise (two were grown) and a farm to manage. Nathan’s slightly older sister, Elizabeth, picked up several of her mother’s duties and helped where she could, but Richard needed a woman to run the household. He couldn’t do it alone. It was customary in colonial New England to mourn the loss of a spouse for two months, then quickly find another, more out of necessity than love. But Richard had cherished Elizabeth’s company deeply, and their relationship was unlike most Puritan marriages; it would take him several years to recover.\n\nAbigail Adams (not to be confused with President John Adams’s wife of the same name) had grown up in Canterbury, a twenty-mile trip east of Coventry. After meeting through mutual acquaintances, within a few months of courtship Abigail and Richard Hale married a week after Nathan’s fourteenth birthday on June 13, 1769, about eight weeks before Enoch and Nathan left for Yale. Abigail was the widow of Captain Samuel Adams, with whom she’d had two daughters. Daughter Sarah moved into the Hale house with Abigail; while Alice, who had gone to live with her uncle in Canterbury, visited when she could. With hazel eyes and jet-black hair, Alice was a beautiful, diminutive girl, who would become known in her elder years as one of the brightest ornaments of [her] society. She and Nathan became close almost immediately as she began to visit. As friends, they adored each other’s company.\n\nContemporary historians and writers, and even Abigail’s family, have indicated that Nathan and Alice corresponded regularly while he was away at school, building on a friendship (and many suspected romance)"
