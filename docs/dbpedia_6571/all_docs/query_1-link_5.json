Desperate for a fresh start after a tough two years in Chicago, the Solomon family retreats to a desolate sunflower farm in North Dakota. But the calm of farm life is shattered when 16-year-old Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben begin to see nightmarish apparitions throughout their new home - visions that nobody else can see. As the visions grow darker, they become fear-inspiring experiences and Jess' parents (Dylan McDermott and Penelope Ann Miller) start to question their daughter's sanity. Now, Jess must find a way to save her family and win.",

        "text": "Thai twin-brother directors Oxide and Danny Pang did primo horror work on 2002's Hong Kong cornea-transplant flick The Eye, but on their first American film their atmospheric efforts are usurped by a brain-dead script that seems written by a 12-year-old.\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nThere are flashes of good imagery in The Messengers, but [they] work better in the trailer, unencumbered by the dreary plot.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nPatchwork filmmaking designed by a corporate mentality devoted only to the defense of the lowest common denominator. The viewer is assumed to be stupid and easily duped.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nThe only message worth relaying about The Messengers is: Avoid.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nA film so filled with clich√©s of the genre and plot points so dumb that even a novice would end up laughing.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nThe problem with The Messengers is that it simply doesn't offer up much of anything new.\n\nJune 21, 2017"
