        "text": "This article is about the original television division of Columbia Pictures. For the current film studio owned by Sony, see Screen Gems.\n\nBackground\n\nScreen Gems, previously the cartoon division of Columbia Pictures, was revived as a television subsidiary in 1948. It was formed when Columbia acquired Pioneer Telefilms, a television commercial company founded in 1947 by Ralph M. Cohn, the son of Columbia Pictures co-founder, Jack Cohn, and the nephew of longtime Columbia Pictures president and co-founder, Harry Cohn. Pioneer Telefilms was renamed to Screen Gems after the acquisition. It was responsible for television production, TV movies, syndicating the Columbia Pictures movie library, and starting in 1958, The Three Stooges shorts starting with the Curly series.\n\nScreen Gems became a fully-fledged studio in 1951 by moving into Telefilm syndication and later into television production in 1952. On July 1, 1956, Columbia studio veteran Irving Briskin formed Briskin Productions to oversee all of Screen Gems' productions. On December 10, 1956, Screen Gems acquired television syndication company Hygo Television Films (a.k.a. \"Serials Inc.\") as well as its affiliated company, United Television Films, Inc. On August 2, 1957, Screen Gems agreed to syndicate the Universal Horror Package from Universal-International for 10 years under the names Shock and Son of Shock. From 1957-1966, Screen Gems held a 20% stake in Hanna-Barbera and acted as their distributor; Screen Gems (and later, Columbia Pictures itself) also owned the distribution rights to The Flintstones alongside many other Hanna-Barbera shows until the 1980s.\n\nIn January 1961, Columbia Pictures Corporation and Screen Gems, Inc. were split into separate companies, when the former studio sold 11% of the latter's stock to the public. On December 23, 1968, Screen Gems merged with its parent Columbia Pictures Corporation and the whole organization was reincorporated as \"Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.\". On May 6, 1974, Screen Gems was reincorporated as \"Columbia Pictures Television\" (now Sony Pictures Television).\n\n1st Logo (October 2, 1952-April 4, 1956)\n\nVisuals: On a light grey background, there is a TV tube-like shape outlined in dark grey and filled in black. There are about eight abstract stars shining inside around the phrase \"A SCREEN GEMS INC. Presentation\" or \"A SCREEN GEMS INC. Production\".\n\nVariants:\n\nThere is one version where the stars shining are more animated and differently shaped, with no glow inside them.\n\nFrom late 1954 to early 1956, the word \"Film\" is added inside the tube.\n\nTechnique: Traditional animation.\n\nAudio: The end title theme of any show.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt originally appeared on The Ford Television Theatre, Captain Midnight, Father Knows Best, The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin, among other shows.\n\nCurrently seen on the complete first & second season of Father Knows Best on DVD.\n\n2nd Logo (August 27, 1955-June 24, 1960)\n\nVisuals: Like the 1942 version of the 1936-1976 Columbia Pictures logo, there is a lady (Columbia, a representation of the USA) holding a light torch on top a pedestal with a backdrop of clouds over her. The Torch Lady's head and upper body is between the words \"SCREEN GEMS\" with the letter \"A\" in a script font above it and \"FILM PRESENTATION\" or \"FILM PRODUCTION\" below it. The byline \"TELEVISION SUBSIDIARY COLUMBIA PICTURES CORPORATION\" appears below that.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere is a special variant for the 10th Anniversary of Screen Gems. The logo is the same, except for the text \"10TH ANNIVERSARY FILM PROGRAM\" (or \"FILM PRESENTATION\") seen below in place of the standard text.\n\nA colorized version of the logo was spotted. It is known to be seen on the Shirley Temple's Storybook episode \"Mother Goose\".\n\nA French version exists, consisting of \"UNE PRESENTATION\" in place of \"A\", \"INC.\" added underneath the \"S\" in \"GEMS\", and \"TELEVISION SUBSIDIARY\" being replaced by \"SERVICE DE TELEVISION DE\".\n\nTechnique: Traditional cel animation, with the Torch Lady, backdrop and text being a matte painting.\n\nAudio:\n\nA majestic horn fanfare at the begin/end of some syndicated programs, or the opening theme of the movie or short. There exists two known versions of this fanfare.\n\nUsually, as a closing logo, you will hear the ending theme for whatever show or movie played over it, sometimes with Hal Gibney announcing: \"This has been a Screen Gems Film Production, from the Hollywood studios of Columbia Pictures\".\n\nAudio Variant: When the movie 20 Million Miles to Earth premiered on television, Screen Gems plastered the Columbia Pictures logo, keeping the fanfare intact.\n\nAvailability:\n\nCurrently seen on seasons 2-4 DVD releases of Father Knows Best, two episodes of Ranch Party on the Internet Archive, and a few season 1 and most season 2 episodes of Dennis the Menace on Hulu, replacing the next logo on season 2 episodes.\n\nDespite the logo blending in with the show itself, Columbia TriStar has deleted the logo on several occasions.\n\nThis logo also isn't seen on Antenna TV's reruns of Father Knows Best or Dennis the Menace as it has been deleted and replaced by the Colex Enterprises and/or the Sony Pictures Television logos.\n\nIt was also used on the original late '50s/early '60s 16mm prints of all 190 Stooges shorts that remained in circulation on TV stations until the late 1980s, including 200 non-Stooge Columbia two-reelers released to TV in 1959, many of which can be obtained by private collectors online, although the logo may vary in quality on most shorts.\n\nIt can also be found on a few Stooges shorts released on VHS by RCA/Columbia, including \"A Bird in the Head\" (closing variant only), \"Three Smart Saps\", and \"I'm a Monkey's Uncle\", which were last seen on TBS in the early 1990s.\n\nIt can also be found on a newly transferred 16mm print of \"Disorder in the Court\" on a Stooges DVD by TGG Direct, as this was a public domain short for many years with many VHS/DVD prints blacking out the opening logo due to copyright issues.\n\nIt was also seen on The Huckleberry Hound Show, the only Hanna-Barbera production to follow Columbia's standard ending protocols.\n\nThis logo can also be seen on the season 1 half-hour episodes of Naked City.\n\nIt also makes an appearance at the close of the Naked City season 2 episode \"The Day it Rained Mink\" (which, as of this posting, can be seen on RetroTV, Tubi, and Filmrise).\n\nThe fourth SG logo was already in use by that time.\n\nThis logo can also be seen at the beginning of Amazon Prime Video's printing of Night of Terror (1933).\n\n3rd Logo (September 3, 1960-July 7, 1963)\n\nVisuals: Same as the 1955 logo, excluding the clouds and the additional captions. Only the name \"SCREEN GEMS\" remains, and the words are smaller and somewhat stretched out, and are shown on each side of the Torch Lady's lower body and legs.\n\nVariants:\n\nA rare color variant of this logo was seen on Hazel.\n\nSometimes, the logo is shown in open-matte.\n\nAn opening version featured the \"COLUMBIA\" lettering from the film logo superimposed over a studio, with a camera crane moving (similar to the 1960 NBC \"Cameraman\" logo); this then fades to the Screen Gems logo.\n\nTechnique: Traditional cel animation, with the Torch Lady, backdrop and text being a matte painting.\n\nAudio: Either silence or the end title theme from any show playing over this with Hal Gibney announcing:\n\n\"This has been a Screen Gems Film Presentation (from Columbia Pictures), Herbert B. Leonard, Executive Producer\".\n\n\"This has been a Screen Gems Film Presentation (from Columbia Pictures), produced by Herbert B. Leonard.\"\n\n\"This has been a Screen Gems Production.\"\n\n\"This has been a Screen Gems Film (Production/Presentation).\"\n\n\"This has been a Screen Gems Film (Production/Presentation), from the Hollywood studios of Columbia Pictures.\"\n\nThe opening variants would have a fanfare with Gibney intoning, \"From Columbia Pictures, A Screen Gems Production.\"\n\nAvailability:\n\nLast seen on reruns of shows such as Hazel, Dennis the Menace, The Naked City, and Route 66.\n\nAs of this posting, the latter two shows are being aired on Retro TV's weekday afternoon schedule.\n\nThis has been edited over with or followed by either the 1995 Columbia TriStar Television Distribution logo or the 2002 Sony Pictures Television logo on some shows recently.\n\nCurrently seen on The Naked City, The Donna Reed Show, some seasons 2-4 episodes of Dennis the Menace on Hulu, and some episodes of Route 66 on Retro TV and Me-TV.\n\nThe final season of The Huckleberry Hound Show may have also used this logo.\n\n4th Logo (September 15, 1963-June 25, 1965)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, eleven animated lines \"drop down\" at the right of the screen to ascending jazz notes as a swarm of circles scatter near the middle of the left side leaving behind the words \"SCREEN GEMS\" in the Benguiat Frisky font (these circles were what one rec.arts.animation post described as the \"spotlights\". The \"stars\" may come from the fact that the circles sparkle like stars). As this happens, the lines shrink somewhat and spread out, filling the right half and shaking slightly back and forth.\n\nVariant: When filmed and broadcast in color, the sticks and the dots are in various colors, and \"SCREEN GEMS\" is gold.\n\nTechnique: Traditional animation.\n\nAudio: An eight-note jazzy trumpet fanfare that ascends as the sticks drop in, and ends with a five-note stinger when the logo finishes. A male announcer states that the production is \"A Screen Gems production\" (for shows produced in-house) or \"A Screen Gems presentation\" (for co-productions with other companies or shows merely distributed by Screen Gems) near the end.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOne version of the logo does not use an announcer spiel. This was often used on international prints of Screen Gems shows.\n\nThe final season of Route 66 has \"A Screen Gems Presentation; Herbert B. Leonard, Executive Producer\". The latter part of the spiel was taken from the previous logo's vocal track.\n\nSome prints have a higher-pitched version of the music.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt does appear in color without the signature music on the 1999 Columbia Pictures documentary The Lady with the Torch.\n\nHowever, due to replacement with various newer logos, both Sony Pictures Television-related and syndication, this is hard to find on television.\n\nThe color logo with no announcer was spotted on syndication prints of The Peter Potamus Show.\n\nMany Hanna-Barbera shows, such as Jonny Quest, had the presentation variant appear at the end of the program.\n\nFilm prints of original broadcast versions also keep this logo intact.\n\nIt can also be seen on S3 and S4 of Hazel on DVD.\n\nThis logo also appears at the end of recent prints such as Me-TV airings of the final season of Route 66 (followed by the 1993 Columbia Pictures Television logo on most episodes) and also appeared on their prints of The Donna Reed Show, followed by the 2002 Sony Pictures Television logo.\n\nThe B&W \"Presentation\" variant can also be seen in the documentary series Decision: The Conflicts of Harry S. Truman episode \"Dialogue with the Future, Part I\", currently on C-SPAN's YouTube channel.\n\n5th Logo (September 13, 1965-August 29, 1974)\n\nVisuals: On a yellow background, two red parallelograms (or lines) come from the top and bottom of the screen, and the upper one is at a distance while the lower is closer. They fly towards each other, and the higher moves forward while the lower backs away. As they do so, they grow in length and wrap around a space where a red dot appears, forming a stylized \"S\". Under that, the text \"SCREEN GEMS\" zooms in.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe \"S\" logo was designed and animated by Chermayeff & Geismar Associates of New York (now Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv), a firm also responsible for the six-feathered NBC Peacock, the 1984 PBS logo, the Viacom \"Wigga Wigga\" logo, and the Chase Manhattan Bank logo, among other designs.\n\nIn the 2019 Quentin Tarantino film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, the jingle can (partially) be heard on a television on the Mansion Compound.[1] The logo's music is credited in the end credits of the movie.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere's an in-credit logo that's shown on the short-lived series Adventures of the Seaspray with the text \"in association with\" and \"Screen Gems\" in the same font as the credits.\n\nAnother in-credit version was shown on The Pierre Berton Show with the text \"SCREEN GEMS Canada Production\" in the same font as the credits.\n\nStarting in late 1972, the byline \"A DIVISION OF COLUMBIA PICTURES INDUSTRIES, INC.\" zooms up with \"SCREEN GEMS\" on most programs.\n\nA black and white variant exists on shows in said colors.\n\nOn some prints of The Partridge Family, the \"S\" is black, attributed by some to film deterioration.\n\nSeveral shows in 1970 don't have the name in bold.\n\nThere is also a still variant of this logo with the phrase \"DISTRIBUTED BY\" in small print above \"SCREEN GEMS\".\n\nAnother still variant with and without Columbia bylines respectively was seen on some shows like the first season of Police Story and Ghost Story (also known as Circle of Fear).\n\nAnother variant has the byline appearing after the company logo/text animation stop. This variant was seen on early episodes of the miniseries QB VII.\n\nThere is a variant where (possibly due to film deterioration), the screen is white and the \"S\" is bright. Seen on the pilot episode of Love on a Rooftop.\n\nAnother variant is similar to the one above, but even brighter, making the \"S\" invisible and the words \"SCREEN GEMS\" barely visible. Seen on the Love on a Rooftop episode \"The Six Dollar Surprise\".\n\nAnother variant like the ones above, contains the byline, has the \"S\" partly invisible and the name and byline barely visible to see. This was spotted in a B&W print of The Paul Lynde Show episode \"Togetherness\".\n\nOn a late 1980s print of an episode of Occasional Wife, the animation and music of the logo were slightly faster than usual, probably due to time compression.\n\nA still version with a sky blue background was seen on Episode 5 of The Girl with Something Extra.\n\nAnother still version with a pink background was seen on the pilot of the same show.\n\nOn the Get TV airing of the TV special The Temptations Show, the logo skips in the middle of its animation, speeding up the logo and music in the process.\n\nOn some current prints of shows, the logo is cropped to 16:9 (mostly the bylineless versions), sometimes remastered in HD or not.\n\nA filmed version exists, known to been found on 16mm prints of Brian's Song.\n\nTechnique: Camera-controlled cel animation.\n\nAudio:\n\nComposed by Van Alexander and arranged by Eric Siday, the entire score was performed on a Moog modular synthesizer (Siday was one of the first musicians to have one). It consists of 6 French horn-like notes, followed by two synth-brass quadruplets, with the last note held out.\n\nIn 1970, the Siday theme was shortened so only three notes came before the tones. This shortened variant was sped-up and was used for the first Columbia Pictures Television logo.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nThere is a silent version on the 1971 television movie Brian's Song.\n\nThe still version seen on Police Story had the end theme playing over the logo.\n\nThe 1966 series Hawk (with Burt Reynolds), some later prints of The Peter Potamus Show, the 1966 edition of NFL Game of the Week, and the first episode of Days of Our Lives, carried an alternate recording of the Eric Siday music, which had sharper, more \"shrill\" tones, almost sounding like a loud saxophone; the black \"S\" variant also used this.\n\nOn some first season episodes of I Dream of Jeannie (seen in syndication in the '70s and early '80s), as well as the half hour packaging of Batfink, an alternate trumpet fanfare in G major played over the logo (said to be composed by Winston Sharples, but this is unconfirmed).\n\nCurrent prints of I Dream of Jeannie used the extended 2002 Sony Pictures Television theme instead.\n\nIn other cases, it used the closing theme of the show or TV movie.\n\nSome prints have the music higher pitched.\n\nWhen ABC reran Bewitched on their daytime schedule in 1968, this logo had the 1963 \"Dancing Sticks\" music attached to it on at least two episodes, probably due to a plastering error.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThis logo has been restored on reruns of Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie, and The Partridge Family on Antenna TV and FETV.\n\nThe DVD versions have not retained the logo; except for one B&W episode (episode #22) of I Dream of Jeannie, the logos were removed on disc, but the short version complete with jingle has been restored starting with the seventh season DVD releases of Bewitched, as well as the fourth season DVD release of The Partridge Family.\n\nThe VHS release The Partridge Family: C'mon Get Happy! also preserves this logo, followed by the 1993 CPT logo.\n\nThe only other DVD releases with this logo are the 1971 TV movie Brian's Song and the 1974 miniseries QB VII, with the theme music over it, plus the Columbia byline.\n\nThis logo can also be seen after every episode on the DVD release of Bridget Loves Bernie.\n\nThis logo can also be found on every episode on the 2014 Mill Creek Entertainment DVD release of Gidget.\n\nThe still variant with the Columbia byline can also be found on most episodes of the first season of Police Story on DVD, released by Shout! Factory.\n\nIt was also shown in an edited form on Fox Family reruns of The Partridge Family and in a sped-up form without music on Hallmark Channel reruns of Bewitched.\n\nA good few episodes of Bewitched when aired on the UK satellite channel Living have this logo, often followed by the 2003 Sony Pictures Television International logo.\n\nHowever, Crackle prints of Hawk has this plastered with the 2002 Sony Pictures Television logo.\n\nThe \"Hawk S\" can be seen at the Paley Center, and the 1966 edition of NFL Game of the Week, which can be found on YouTube.\n\nThis was also seen on an episode of The Monkees on IFC, which was followed by the 1995 CTTD and 2014 Sony/SPT logos.\n\nIts first appearance was on the third and final season of The Farmer's Daughter, on ABC, and the fifth and final season of Hazel, on CBS.\n\nAirings of Seasons 5 and 6 of The Flintstones used the 1965 variant well into the '80s; however, it started getting plastered by the '90s. The 1970 variant appeared on original broadcasts of The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show, but again, newer Hanna-Barbera logos have since plastered it.\n\nThe Winston Sharples version may have appeared on The Jetsons or very early episodes of Space Ghost and Dino Boy pre-Taft purchase, as B&W footage of animation used in both shows follows the logo in the most well-known upload. This could've been a technical error, however.\n\nThe 1970 variant can also be found on old prints of Yogi's Ark Lark, as Boomerang's SVOD service plasters it with the bylineless version of the 1968 Hanna-Barbera Cartoons \"Zooming HB\" logo.\n\nLegacy:\n\nThis logo has gained a relatively large cult following (even transcending the logo enthusiast community), due to its notoriety for scaring some viewers (particularly children), earning its unofficial nickname, the \"S from Hell\". This is mostly due to the animation and Siday's early Moog stinger, which has been described as \"creepy\"[2] and \"horrifying\"[1]. Commonly referred to alongside other \"scary\" logos, such as the Viacom \"V of Doom\", VID's \"Mask of Guo Xiang\", Klasky Csupo's \"Splaat\", Paramount Television's \"Closet Killer\", and THX's \"Deep Note\". Its notoriety was even enough to spawn a short mockumentary in 2010 called The S from Hell (directed by Rodney Ascher, who later directed the 2012 documentary Room 237), as well as for the logo to make a brief appearance in a particularly tense scene in Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, as mentioned in Trivia.\n\nDespite its notoriety, a large swath of viewers love the logo, with some calling it \"charming and innovative\"[3].\n\nCopyright stamps\n\nHere is some information about the copyright stamps on the Screen Gems Television shows and TV movies:\n\nOctober 2, 1952-1969: Copyright © (year) Screen Gems, Inc.
