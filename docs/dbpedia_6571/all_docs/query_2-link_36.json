        "text": "The Messengers is a 2007 American supernatural horror film directed by the Pang Brothers which was released on February 2, 2007 by Columbia Pictures and Screen Gems.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe film follows the Solomon family who move from Chicago to a small town in North Dakota where they start a sunflower farm; however, their children, Jess and Ben begin noticing omnious events caused by a supernatural source.\n\nCast[]\n\nKristen Stewart as Jess Solomon\n\nDylan McDermott as Roy Solomon\n\nPenelope Ann Miller as Denise Solomon\n\nEvan and Theodore Turner as Ben Solomon\n\nJohn Corbett as John Burwell\\John Rollins\n\nProduction[]\n\n\"The Messengers\" first started off as an original script called \"The Scarecrow\" by Todd Farmer and was originally written as a psychological thriller as opposed to a more supernatural horror film.\n\nThe script was sold to Revolution Studios where director Patrick Lussier signed on to the film and put a supernatural flair into the story. Revolution Studios later sold the script to Ghost House Pictures who took it and hired Mark Wheaton to re-write the script.\n\nImpressed with his work on the film, \"High Tension\", producer Sam Raimi offered the film to Alexandre Aja, who passed on the film to direct \"The Hills Have Eyes.\"\n\nPrincipal photography for \"The Messengers\" took place on June 27, 2005 in Saskatechwan, Canada (in Regina and Indian Head).\n\nScout Taylor-Compton auditioned for the role of Jess, but it was ultimately given to Kristen Stewart.\n\nBox Office[]\n\n\"The Messengers\" grossed $14,713,321 during its opening weekend. Overall, it grossed $55,060,312 on an estimated budget of $16,000,000.\n\nCritical Reception[]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Messengers\" has an approval rating of 12% based on 84 reviews and an average rating of 3.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"The Messengers is an atmospheric but derivative rip-off of countless other horror movies.\"\n\nOn Metacritic, the film has a score of 34 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it an average grade of \"Câ€“\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nMaitland McDonagh from TV Guide Magazine called it both \"formulaic and derivative.\"\n\nThe New York Times wrote: \"Like too many horror pictures, The Messengers becomes more boringly prosaic as it goes along, and there's an 11th-hour plot twist so dumb and poorly articulated that it destroys the movie.\"\n\nRonnie Scheib of Variety said: \"Though the Pangs prove culturally adaptive on a visual level, they seem completely clueless as to the tonal modalities of Mark Wheaton's admittedly undercooked, all-American script.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Times said the film is \"at once ruthlessly efficient and shamelessly distended\" while the New York Post called it \"nicely photographed but slow-moving, dull and utterly predictable.\"\n\nJames Berardinelli of ReelViews wrote: \"It's a little sad that The Messengers is ultimately a good candidate for burial in a toxic waste dump because there are some good elements contained herein.\""
