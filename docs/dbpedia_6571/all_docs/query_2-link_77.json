        "text": "TeenHollywood: These kids get in trouble when their dad isn't home. What's the most trouble you've gotten into at home when your parents weren't there? Kristen: We were alone when my brother broke his arm on me. We were running to go get the phone and I wanted to pick it up and he wanted to pick it up and he got it first and I tried to get it from him and he hit me with the phone and, in hitting me, he broke his arm. Then, my parents came home and we had to spend the rest of the night in the emergency room which didn't make them too happy.\n\nDo your little bros constantly want into your room, interrupt your private phone calls and tell you the house has been launched into outer space? Uh..yes on everything but the last one you say? In the space adventure Zathura, 15-year-old actress Kristen Stewart has to deal with a galaxy full of trouble when her two little brothers play a forbidden magical game.\n\nPretty Kristen first caught our attention as Jodie Foster's daughter in the thriller Panic Room and you might have seen her touching performance in the really relevant TV movie \"Speak\" in which the teen played a young victim of date rape. Wanting to chill a bit and lighten up, Kristen was happy to accept the role of a big sister since, in real life, she's the little sister in her family getting bossed around by older brothers.\n\nKristen explained that dealing with lots of on set monsters, a bit of effects and harness work in which she got to \"fly\" and having to have a weird full cast made of her whole body was unique for the young actress. Kristen came to our interview with her older brother who sat quietly in the corner, letting his little sis shine as she told us about making Zathura and her upcoming projects. Picture a normal teen on a casual day in gray sweat tank, jacket and jeans.\n\nTeenHollywood: So is there a perfect cast model of Kristen Stewart somewhere in existence?\n\nKristen: Standing at the studio probably next to The Terminator or something, yeah.\n\nTeenHollywood: What was it like to have that made?\n\nKristen: It's surreal. It's an experience that no human being has ever really done unless they have a twin; standing next to themselves. It also doesn't really help that she's frozen and her lips are blue and her hair is all frosted. I did have to stand pretty still when they were molding the cast.\n\nTeenHollywood: She's not ready for a glamour shot.\n\nKristen: No. Definitely not.\n\nTeenHollywood: What was the process like doing that cast?\n\nKristen: It was pretty arduous. It was a three step process. The first was a digital scan of my body that they entered into a computer then I actually got to go in Stan Winston's studio and they molded, individually, each part of my body. They did my legs, my torso, each one of my arms, my head. The head was a bit of a worry. I'm pretty claustrophobic and it gets really heavy and the plaster is warm so you can't even feel the air go into your nose because it's warm. I mean you're breathing but it's kind of scary. The last step in the process was painting her. I went in and stood next to my mannequin basically and they painted every nuance of my face. Every freckle on my arm is on that body. There's no difference. They're artists. They're re-creators of life.\n\nTeenHollywood: What was it like being the only girl with all the guys in the movie?\n\nKristen: I'm pretty used to that. I grew up with boys. That's my brother right there [indicates sitting in the corner]. I'm the only girl in my family besides my mom.\n\nTeenHollywood: When did you make Zathura in relationship to \"Speak\"?\n\nKristen: It was far, far after \"Speak\". I was thirteen when I did \"Speak\" and I was turning fifteen when I did this.\n\nTeenHollywood: What was the transition like from the intensity of \"Speak\" to something like this?\n\nKristen: They are just completely different movies. A lot of people ask 'what kind of movies do you want to do? What types of roles do you want to do?' I really don't want to get pigeonholed in any type of role. It's nice to do different things and play different characters. If you're just the same person all the time you're not an actor, you're just kind of a personality and that's not what I'm after.\n\nTeenHollywood: Were there any sci-fi movies that you liked when you were a little kid?\n\nKristen: I liked E.T. and I liked Spaceballs [laughs]. That's a funny one.\n\nTeenHollywood: Are you into name brand designer clothes at all?\n\nKristen: Uh, Levis [laughs]. No, I'm not, not really.\n\nTeenHollywood: Did you hang out with the two younger boys in the movie to bond with them?\n\nKristen: Yeah. I came on probably a week before we started shooting and we had rehearsal time on set with Jon and the whole cast. We went to the pier one night and tried to get comfortable with one another. It was pretty easy because they are very normal kids. They come from very well-rounded families and they're just a pretty typical 12-year-old and 8-year-old, kind of easy to get along with.\n\nTeenHollywood: Had you worked with young kids before?\n\nKristen: I've played the older sister a lot but I've always had infants. I've always worked with babies so I've never had to interact with them. I'm the baby in the family. I've never even babysat. So I have absolutely no contact with kids that are younger than me. But, it didn't pose any problem at all. They're very normal. They're really funny and a lot of fun. They know what their job is and they are very professional and they always get it done but they also know that this should be a fun thing to do and to utilize that. The famous rumor is 'don't work with kids or animals'. So, I know there's a pretense of maybe some hissy fits going on on set or some difficult actors but no. There was no problem.\n\nTeenHollywood: How much fun was it being the big sister in the film when you are the baby sister in real life?\n\nKristen: Actually, I really sympathized with them because I was tortured when I was little. I would sit in my brother's doorway because I really wanted to hang out with him really bad but I wasn't allowed in his room. So slamming the door in Jonah's little face is kind of hard to do [Jonah Bobo plays her youngest bro in the film]. But, the dismissive attitude toward your little brothers and sisters was easy to draw from because I'm a little sister.\n\nTeenHollywood: Was there a lot of green screen shooting or was more stuff live on the set?\n\nKristen: Some [green screen] but not as much as you'd think. A lot of it was practical. Most everything that was happening in the house was really happening. When we harpooned walls and ripped them out, we were really doing it. When there was a fire on set, there was really fire. We had three house sets. One of them was on a gimbal, one of them shook and one of them was static. The only green screen I was ever involved with was for getting sucked out into the black hole. I got to wear a harness and fly up to the rafters of the sound stage and that was about it. It was awesome.\n\nTeenHollywood: Some of this movie might scare little kids. Do you think that's healthy? Should kids be a little bit scared sometimes?\n\nKristen: Well, I think in any good adventure, there has to be a sense of peril or why do you care about the kids running around? You're not worried for them. Yeah, I think it's healthy. I don't think children should be sheltered from the world that they live in. First of all, they're Zorgons. They are big lizard men. They aren't running after us to kill us or anything.\n\nTeenHollywood: Was there actually a big robot on set?\n\nKristen: Yeah. That's the cool thing. We never had to run away from the imaginary robot. We never had to run away from a guy in a green suit. When the robot ran through the door and knocked off the sides and made the circular doors, he really did that. I think we had three. Stan Winston created pretty much all of the characters that weren't actual actors and the cool thing is they really did become characters in the movie. It wasn't just computer-generated. It wasn't like just watching a video game. They were real characters.\n\nTeenHollywood: Those suits for the Zorgons were pretty good then.\n\nKristen: Yeah. It's pretty cool. They actually made little mechanical muscles underneath the rubber of their skin. You could really see the expressions on their faces. It looks CGI but it's completely real. There was a guy. It was a suit that he wore and the lizard head came out of his torso like this [demonstrates] and he popped off the top.\n\nTeenHollywood: These kids get in trouble when their dad isn't home. What's the most trouble you've gotten into at home when your parents weren't there?\n\nKristen: We were alone when my brother broke his arm on me. We were running to go get the phone and I wanted to pick it up and he wanted to pick it up and he got it first and I tried to get it from him and he hit me with the phone and, in hitting me, he broke his arm. Then, my parents came home and we had to spend the rest of the night in the emergency room which didn't make them too happy.\n\nTeenHollywood: What kind of music do you like listening to?\n\nKristen: I was raised on classic rock. My parents are kind of old rocker/hippy kind of people. I like Led Zeppelin and I love The Beatles. I like The Cars, I like The Band and The Doors. I like some music now but not most. I'm not too into labels. That's gotten really popular lately and it's pretentious and I'm not into it but I like Interpol and stuff like that.\n\nTeenHollywood: Would you like to go out into space?\n\nKristen: Yeah. I guess. It would depend on why I was going. I like to travel and, in essence, it is the ultimate trip I guess. I like the no gravity idea. I'd like to float around.\n\nTeenHollywood: There is so much down time on a movie set, how do you pass it?\n\nKristen: Most of the time, if there's any down time, I'm in school. It's hard to keep up in that sense.\n\nTeenHollywood: Do you envision taking time out for college in a few years?\n\nKristen: Definitely. I'm in a kind of college prep program right now and I'm definitely not going to lose sight of my education just because I want to be an actor.\n\nTeenHollywood: Do you miss having a traditional high school life?\n\nKristen: No, actually I don't. I went to school up until like the seventh grade and I know a lot of people who have graduated from high school and everyone gets a major dose of perspective on who their real friends are and what their real values are and what is important to them and that kind of happened for me just a little bit earlier. I don't really mind that. I still have my really close friends. I still have my family. I'm really family-oriented so no, I don't have a problem with it at all.\n\nTeenHollywood: Is there anyone's career you would like to use as a blueprint for your own?\n\nKristen: Not just because I worked with her but Jodie Foster is obviously, a role model. She's not just an actress, she's not one-dimensional. She has more than one creative outlet. She's a writer, producer, a director. She has a pretty level head on her shoulders and I like the idea that she can keep her personal life private and separate from what she does. I admire most of her values. She's pretty cool.\n\nTeenHollywood: Is it harder to act now that you are a teen than when you were a kid?\n\nKristen: Yeah. I remember when I was little, I didn't have any inhibitions. I wasn't embarrassed about doing anything. When you get older, I don't know what it is, it's not that you get more insecure, you're just maybe more self-aware. It's just kind of something that happens. You try to do the best you can and that's pretty much all you can do.\n\nTeenHollywood: Your director on Zathura, Jon Favreau is also an actor. Does that make working with him easier?\n\nKristen: I'm sure it did help him. It helped me a lot. It was my first comedy so I had a lot of anticipation and apprehension as to how I was going to react to situations that are over the top and hokey and hysterical. I was shy a lot of times. I was kind of embarrassed to explore the scenes and be free with them and he helped me, a lot of times, kind of push past my inhibitions because he was very, very in tuned to how his actors were feeling and that's not really common with most directors. Usually, they expect you to do your job and there you go. But he was very sensitive. He's a caring guy.\n\nTeenHollywood: Was working with Dax Shephard crazy? [Dax plays the adult astronaut in the movie]. He's a pretty funny guy.\n\nKristen: Oh, he was a very, very serious person all of the time.. no. Dax is a goofball. He had the boys roarin'. It was pretty cool, because it was my first comedy. Comedy is kind of a serious business you know. It's all about timing and the boys and Dax really lightened the tone on set and made me feel like, 'yeah, it's not that big of a deal. Just go with it. Have fun with it and it'll show up on screen if you are having fun'. He definitely helped me out with that.\n\nTeenHollywood: Did the guys play any pranks on you?\n\nKristen: They never did it to me but they definitely did it to everyone else. They would mess with the crew. They had ongoing jokes that, because I wasn't there every day, I didn't really get and little songs that they sang. It was a lot of fun.\n\nTeenHollywood: Let's talk new projects. What do you do in The Messengers?\n\nKristen: I'm catatonically terrified in The Messengers most of the time, a lot of screaming, actually. It's about a family who is kind of in a rough time in their lives. They are financially, not very stable and there's some animosity between the daughter, myself, and the parents for a few pretty good reasons. So they move out to a farm to escape the hectic city life and see if they can get on their feet again and they enter a pretty spooky house and the only person who really sees any of these things going on or is threatened by them in any way, is my character and, because of some previous history, no one believes anything that she says.\n\nTeenHollywood: It sucks when they don't believe you.\n\nKristen: Yeah. It's also a pretty claustrophobic movie even though it's set out in the middle of nowhere. There's a pretty strong sense of isolation but, when there is nowhere to run, you start to feel very closed in. She's alone all the time; a pretty vulnerable character, but towards the end she basically has to suck it up and figure out why this is happening and get to the bottom of it.\n\nTeenHollywood: What is your other new project?\n\nKristen: In the Land of Women I just finished it up in Canada with Jonathan Kasdan directing. It's his first feature, Lawrence Kasdan's son. It's a Meg Ryan and Adam Brody movie and it's kind of a drama/comedy about a guy who moves away from a hectic life and into a small town to take care of his grandma and he meets these four women and it's basically about his relationship with them and just dealing with these psychotic, crazy women and the conversations that they have and the revelations that they come to about their lives and how they change as characters throughout the course of the movie. It's a movie about people talking to people. It's good. I'm pretty excited to see it.\n\nTeenHollywood: Are you one of the crazy women?\n\nKristen: Yeah. I play Meg Ryan's daughter. We're not necessarily all crazy. I'm the daughter with the typical problems with her mother and the typical problems high school and growing up and insecurities. Through talking to this guy, she kind of realizes a lot about herself, what type of direction she'd like her life to go in.\n\nTeenHollywood: Could you relate to any of those issues?\n\nKristen: I can relate to them because I have a lot of friends who are going through them right now but, personally, not at all.\n\nTeenHollywood: Where were you in Canada for In the Land of Women?\n\nKristen: We were in Victoria. We were on Vancouver island. It's beautiful. It's a very quaint little town and I hadn't been to many of those so it was a good experience. We were right on the water so it was beautiful. We got to watch the ships come in. We did The Messengers up in Saskatchewan. It's my first horror movie and actually, the Pang Brothers' first American release. We were in Regina.\n\nTeenHollywood: Pretty flat there.\n\nKristen: Flat, yes. You can see your dog run away for miles.\n\nSource\n\nTeenHollywood: Have you ever had any real life paranormal experiences that you were able to pull from to get more into your character for this film? Kristen: Not at first, no. But, ever since I've been a kid, I've been absolutely, totally scared of ghosts. Like whenever I would run around my house terrified when I was five years old, it was always because of ghosts. But I never saw anything like that. But it's kind of interesting, when I was on the film about half way through, I had a really trippy experience in my hotel room which was an old hotel. I questioned the whole time I was doing the movie 'do people really scream when they get scared?' And one night, it was insane, I opened my eyes and this image of this woman just filled my entire view. It was like I let out the most gut wrenching scream. I mean people called the hotel room to see if I was okay.\n\nKristen Stewart Gets the \"Message\"\n\n16-year-old actress Kristen Stewart first impressed us as a young diabetic girl trapped in her own home with \"mom\" Jodie Foster in 2002's The Panic Room. In 2003, the teen was victimized in a spooky old mansion in Cold Creek Manor. In Catch That Kid, Kristen turned bank robber to help her ailing dad. She was a traumatized high school Freshman in 2004's Speak and the frozen big sister to two precocious younger bros in the outer space romp Zathura.\n\nThis week, you can catch Kristen in The Messengers in which a family farm turns into a trap full of spooky kids and a suddenly evil dad. We chatted with Kristen about her role, her own frightfest experiences while filming, her writing, her college plans, upcoming films and being a 16-year-old actress.\n\nTeenHollywood: What made you want to become an actress? You've been acting since you were 9 or 10.\n\nKristen: I was about 9 or actually I was 8 when I first started auditioning. I auditioned for about a year before I got anything.\n\nTeenHollywood: Was it your idea to do it?\n\nKristen: Yeah. I mean I definitely agreed to it. I don't even really remember. We got a call from an agent that was in the audience at my school for my Christmas performance and my parents were both in the business so they were like, 'We don't want to be stage moms.' My dad was a stage manager and he's like, 'Oh my God. I don't want my kid...' but I just remember thinking 'Actually that might be really cool. I might want to go on a few auditions. I might work.' It took a really long time until I was totally over it and my mom said, 'Well, this is the last one. You don't have to go to anymore.' And that was the first movie I got.\n\nTeenHollywood: This movie has brother Asian directors. Was that a reason to sign on?\n\nKristen: I was really eager to work with them, Danny and Oxide Pang. I loved their movie, The Eye. It's just heaven. It's eerie and just totally wigged me out and I wanted to work with them.\n\nTeenHollywood: So, you are a fan of horror films. Do you enjoy working in the horror genre?\n\nKristen: I love horror movies. My all time favorite movie, and I've been asked this a thousand times recently, is definitely The Shining. Excellent film.\n\nTeenHollywood: What scares you in horror movies and what scares you about this movie?\n\nKristen: I like when all of a sudden you're watching a movie and it slows down and you're like, 'oh my god, something's definitely going to happen' and you know it, but even when it does, it still scares you just as much. I like all types of horror movies. I definitely don't exclude slasher movies. I love them also. There's something nice and deliberate about this movie. The Pang brothers really take their time. There's something about the pacing that's just really unnerving to me, that's kind of weird.\n\nTeenHollywood: Have you ever had any real life paranormal experiences that you were able to pull from to get more into your character for this film?\n\nKristen: Not at first, no. But, ever since I've been a kid, I've been absolutely, totally scared of ghosts. Like whenever I would run around my house terrified when I was five years old, it was always because of ghosts. But I never saw anything like that. But it's kind of interesting, when I was on the film about half way through, I had a really trippy experience in my hotel room which was an old hotel. I questioned the whole time I was doing the movie 'do people really scream when they get scared?' And one night, it was insane, I opened my eyes and this image of this woman just filled my entire view. It was like I let out the most gut wrenching scream. I mean people called the hotel room to see if I was okay.\n\nTeenHollywood: Do you think part of that was your imagination from being in the spooky film?\n\nKristen: That was what I was thinking. I was on the set the next day and I was telling everyone, 'now I completely understand.' I wouldn't talk to anyone about it before. I said 'I totally get how you guys could think that I was just getting really into the movie and that this could be a reflection of what's going on in my work and [projected] onto my real life but it's not.' Objectively, it was not. I mean it's hard to explain. It was just there. It's not like I've ever had visions before. I don't see things that aren't there.\n\nTeenHollywood: How do you think teenagers will relate to your character Jess's experience and her relationship with her parents in The Messengers?\n\nKristen: I think so many girls are still living with their parents and are fighting for a little bit of independence which most people are. I mean like you're 14 and you're like 'Come on! Leave me alone a little bit.' I think a lot of people have a lot of animosity in their families and you really do treat the ones that you love the worst. I think what's great about this movie is that they all come to realize that the people that they really, truly need are each other, that it's their family. You have to learn to accept it. You do treat the people that you love the worst. I don't know. I think a lot of people go through that.\n\nTeenHollywood: Do you think the weird setting helps to bring the family together?\n\nKristen: Actually, at first, it's the worst thing for them because they want nothing more than to get away from each other. It totally works against my character because there's nowhere for her to run and especially when nobody believes her, you know, that all these things are happening and she has nowhere to go. No, I think it actually works very much against them at first.\n\nTeenHollywood: How did you enjoy working in Canada?\n\nKristen: Canada has become like my second home. I'm there constantly. I love it there. The one thing is I'm very thin blooded and it gets a little chilly up there -- not my favorite thing. I've worked in L.A. once or twice. It would be nice to work here more but if we're going to go anywhere, I'd really [like Canada]. It's a pleasant place to be. I have a lot of friends there now.\n\nTeenHollywood: You seem to choose roles where teens get empowered. Is that a conscious choice?\n\nKristen: I'm just drawn to stories that I can personally connect with. I never planned it. I'm not saying anything like, 'Young girls, stand up and yell!' It's not that I consciously sought after these roles but I'm naturally drawn to them though so I get it is sort of a [choice].\n\nTeenHollywood: A lot of your films are very intense and dramatic. Is there a screwball comedy anywhere in your future?\n\nKristen: I would be so down for that. I'd love that. The closest I ever came to anything funny at all was Zathura and I had a great time on that but I was sort of a straight man. I never really got to play comedy because even though that movie is sort of a comedy, I was always really scared in it or over the top. It was really fun working with John Favreau. It was awesome, but it didn't really feel like a comedy. I would love to do one.\n\nTeenHollywood: What was the most difficult scene for you to do in The Messengers film, either acting-wise or physically?\n\nKristen: It was really one of the most emotionally and physically strenuous movies I've ever been on and I wasn't expecting that at all. I thought it was going to be sort of a break like, you know, sort of a one-dimensional horror movie. But it turned out to really not be like that for me.\n\nTeenHollywood: What did you like about the script or your character?\n\nKristen: I thought it was really cool that it was set where it was and just the isolation of the whole movie. She's really a desperate character and it's nice because she really triumphs. It's nice when you can see a young, teenage girl actually get up and kick butt and empower herself.\n\nTeenHollywood: What was the atmosphere like on this set? Was it light hearted or was it scary to actually do it? I've heard horror movies can be really a hoot on set even if it's a scary film.\n\nKristen: A lot of the film I shot by myself unfortunately. I got to work with John Corbett and Penelope Ann Miller, there's a cellar scene and the whole cast was in it so we all got to be together. But a lot of the movie I'm by myself. But I never got scared on set. I loved the directors. They're great guys. Both of them are really sweet. The whole crew was awesome. It was sort of a really typical movie on location experience. Everyone had a good time.\n\nTeenHollywood: Were a lot of the effects just make-up or digital and what's it like to work with things that might not be there on set?\n\nKristen: One thing that was really awesome was that a lot of the things were practical and I didn't have to make believe. Most of what I'm responding to was really there for me, even the ghosts. We had someone standing there. Even though it didn't look like it looks in the movie, I didn't have to turn around and scream at nothing. I sort of liked doing that. At first you feel totally absurd and ridiculous but you get into it and you start to feel less stupid.\n\nTeenHollywood: Do you have goals that you want to accomplish in the next couple years in terms of film projects you'd like to be involved with? Are you taking time out for college?\n\nKristen: Absolutely. I love what I do but it's definitely not all that I want to do. I want to go to school. I'm about to be 17 so I have only a little bit more time before I'm off.\n\nTeenHollywood: Is that tough thinking about that?\n\nKristen: Yes, a little bit. But not really though because I have a lot of freedom. The school that I'm involved in is an independent studies correspondence thing. You can move as far or as slow as you like. I want to be a writer. I want to major in English and just go to school for a while. I've lived in L.A. my whole life. I want to go to Sydney University in Australia. My mom's from there. And maybe get a transfer back to the East Coast, live there for awhile. But that's definitely the next couple years of my life.\n\nTeenHollywood: What kind of writing do you want to do?\n\nKristen: My family has always been involved in films so I really feel like making movies. I want to make movies. I'm not as much of a storyteller as I am just a lover of words, putting them together, so I think I'd rather write short stories and maybe, who knows, I would love to write a novel.\n\nTeenHollywood: What are the best and worst things about being a 16-year-old celebrity?\n\nKristen: I'm not really a [celebrity]. I just work. My life has really not changed a whole lot. I just sort of go away every couple months for a month or two and then I come back. I have brothers and I have best friends. I don't know. Ask a celebrity. I mean people don't recognize me on the streets ever. It hasn't changed.\n\nTeenHollywood: Besides writing, what kinds of things do you do in your off time if you have any?\n\nKristen: I do have a lot of off time. A lot of people are like, 'Ah, you must be so busy. What do you get to do in your rare minutes of alone time?' I have so much time off. I'm such a home body. I'm pretty boring. I read a lot. I watch a lot of movies. I hang out with my brother.\n\nTeenHollywood: Do you ever want to get behind the camera? Do you ever want to direct or take your own product under your wing like that?\n\nKristen: When I was little, I would have been, 'Absolutely. For sure. I'm going to direct a movie by the time I'm 16.' And I obviously did not. I changed a little bit. It's so much work and it's so much more than just standing on set and making a movie. I don't know if I would want to do any of that. I'm way more into just the creative... I would write movies. I think that's it. Ask me like in a few more years and it may be a completely different answer.\n\nTeenHollywood: What kind of music are you into now?\n\nKristen: I'm into a lot of different kinds of music. It's funny. Recently I love forties Big Bands like swing music and I started taking swing lessons and I go to Arthur Murray dance studio and learning how to swing which is awesome. I love music. That's why I'm doing it. But I don't know, I listen to a lot of different music. But my favorite band? It's really hard to say.\n\nTeenHollywood: What director would you love to work with?\n\nKristen: Well, Jody [Foster] directs films. I would die to be in a movie directed by her. I'm trying to think. There's so many. I'm actually really excited. I just found out I'm going to do a movie but I'm probably in the movie for about 7 minutes. I'm going to play Robert DeNiro's daughter in the Art Linson movie that he wrote based on a book that he did called \"What Just Happened\". I can't wait.\n\nTeenHollywood: How about actors? Any you would die to work with?\n\nKristen: There are a few young actors - one of them I actually got to work with. I worked with Emile Hirsch on a movie called Into The Wild which was really a great experience. I think Evan Rachel Wood is phenomenal. She blows me away. There are so many others. I love Natalie Portman.\n\nTeenHollywood: As far as upcoming projects for you, who do you play in In the Land of Women?\n\nKristen: I play a girl who I can absolutely relate to in every way. Her story is really a triumphant coming of age. Something crazy happens to you when you're 13. All of a sudden you have these really bad, weird, foreign insecurities and you're like, 'Where did this come from? Why do I feel this way?' You just go a little crazy. I think you're really your true self when you're a little kid and then you kind of get that back in different stages and I've just gone through that. I turned 16 and I was like 'Wow! I feel so good. Why have I been feeling so stupid and insecure?' I think everyone goes through that to a certain extent and in her case, that's what the story is about. It's really just a triumphant little coming out.\n\nTeenHollywood: What is The Cake Eaters about?\n\nKristen: The Cake Eaters is a movie that I did with Mary Stuart Masterson. She made her directorial debut with that movie. It's great. It's about two families that are sort of intertwined very unknowingly and I play a character who has a disease called Friedreich's Ataxia which is a total deterioration of your muscle control so it's a very debilitating disease. She's just about to be in a wheel chair and she's just fighting for that last bit of independence from her mother and she wants to do one thing on her own before she dies and so she picks a guy. It's a really nice, optimistic, triumphant story for her. I love it. Mary Stuart really did a phenomenal job. I love her. She's amazing.\n\nSource"
