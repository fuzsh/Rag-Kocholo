        "text": "This film is based on the belief that children can see thing adults cannot, for example, spirits or ghosts, monsters under the bed and general paranormal phenomena. Children in horror films can be really creepy when used correctly and the child in question here, Ben played by twins Evan and Theodore Turner is a great example of this. Only he can see the messengers but due to being involved in a drink driving accident, in which his sister Jess (Stewart) was driving, Ben has stopped talking and cannot communicate what he is seeing to his family.\n\nJess is a moody teen who has been dragged away from her life in the city to live in an old farmhouse in the country with her family, they hope this will have a positive influence on her behaviour. Her dad (McDermott) is farming sunflowers which lends itself well to the use of hordes of scary crows who try to steal his crop and launch a Hitchcock style attack on him.\n\nJess can not see the ‘messengers’ but she feels that there is something odd going on in the house, she voices her concerns to her parents but due to her past they don’t believe her and think it is just a ploy to get them to move back to the city. So she does some digging of her own, discovering that the family that lived there before had mysteriously up and left 6 years ago. Did they leave or are they still there? The house has a typically creepy basement where some of the action takes place but the whole house is used to good effect in the ‘haunting’ scenes – being old and creeky and in the middle of nowhere helps a lot.\n\nTagline: ‘There is evidence to suggest that children are highly susceptible to paranormal phenomena. They see what adults cannot. They believe what adults deny. And they are trying to warn us.’"
