        "text": "This summer marks 20th anniversary of Rhode Island International Film Festival, while outdoor movies return to Providence, Newport, Narragansett and Westerly.\n\nR.I. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL\n\nThis summer marks the 20th anniversary of the Flickers' Rhode Island International Film Festival, Aug. 9-14. Held at locations throughout the state (in Providence, Bristol, Newport, Jamestown, East Greenwich, Narragansett, Woonsocket, Westerly and more) the RIIFF is one of just a handful of festivals that can qualify films for both the Academy Awards (Oscars) and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).\n\nPrior to the festival itself, there are preliminary events planned.\n\nJune 10-11: It's the \"Secret Cinema: Flickers' Providence LGBTQ Film Festival Preview,\" a celebration of short films with LGBTQ themes, plus a sneak peek at a major new film. It's at the AS220 Black Box Theatre on Empire Street in Providence at 7:30 p.m.\n\nJuly 11-15: There's the Flickers' Kidseye Summer Filmmaking Camp, a five-day camp for aspiring filmmakers ages 8-17. Participants will shoot several short films, and learn about acting, directing, screenwriting, camera work, makeup, costumes, special effects and more. It's at the University of Rhode Island Kingston Campus; cost is $395 for the week.\n\nThe festival itself begins on Aug. 9 with the opening-night celebration at the Providence Performing Arts Center, with a selection of short films and a gala party.\n\nIn addition to presenting lots and lots of films, the RIIFF has a number of special events scheduled.\n\nAug. 10: A walking tour that showcases both the city's history and its potential for movie locations. There will also be workshops on Aug. 10 about maximizing your movie budget in Rhode Island, with special guest Tom DeNucci, of Woodhaven Productions, and for actors, with Prof. Jonathan Pope Evans of Chapman University in California.\n\nAug. 10-14: Two \"festivals within the festival,\" the KidsEye Youth Filmmaker Festival and the Providence LGBTQ Film Festival.\n\nAug. 11: A daylong film forum at the Providence Biltmore that brings together filmmakers and leaders from the educational, political, media and marketing worlds.\n\nAug. 12: Would-be screenwriters might want to check out \"2016 ScriptBiz\" at the Rhode Island Foundation, 1 Union St., a workshop that covers not only writing your masterpiece, but how to market and promote it.\n\nAug. 13: The young filmmakers who attended the KidsEye Camp at URI will premiere their work at 10 a.m. at the Metcalf Auditorium in the RISD Museum. There are also symposiums later in the day, one on the impact of digital technology on storytelling; the other an exploration of gay archetypes in film.\n\nThat same day, the festival closes with a big block(s) party in downtown Providence at the Dark Lady, the Dean Hotel and Local 121. Action will probably slide right into Aug. 14.\n\nFor information on the Rhode Island International Film Festival, call (401) 861-4445 or go online to rifilmfest.org.\n\nDOWNTOWN PROVIDENCE\n\n\"Movies on the Block,\" presented by Downcity and Cornish Associates, will be shown every Thursday evening beginning at sundown, weather permitting, at Grant's Block, 260 Westminster St., in downtown Providence.
