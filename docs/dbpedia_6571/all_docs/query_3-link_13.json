I don’t know, but here are my picks.\n\nTHUNDERBEAN THURSDAY posted by Steve Stanchfield\n\nHistorical Moments In the Depression – Told by Cartoons\n\nI’ve love to hear about some of your favorite cartoons concerning events during the depression.\n\nBAXTER'S BREAKDOWNS posted by Devon Baxter\n\nFarewell to Phil Davis: A Scrapbook from the Artists at Charles Mintz\n\nWhen Art Davis’ brother, Phil, left the Charles Mintz studio, his fellow artists gave him a scrapbook filled with caricatures and gag drawings. Check out this treasure trove!\n\nTHUNDERBEAN THURSDAY posted by Steve Stanchfield\n\nIn your opinion, what is the worst golden age cartoon? Mine is “Dumb Like a Fox” (1941)\n\nHonestly, this film is awful.\n\nTHUNDERBEAN THURSDAY posted by Steve Stanchfield\n\nHey! Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays All – with a Small Holiday Cartoon Program!\n\nSince its Christmas time.. let’s watch some Christmas cartoons!\n\nTHUNDERBEAN THURSDAY posted by Steve Stanchfield\n\nPeople Watching 16mm Cartoon Prints on YouTube\n\nI’m amazed at how many people are posting 16mm cartoons they’re shooting off a screen, or using professional scanners. Here’s a sample of what I mean.\n\nTHUNDERBEAN THURSDAY posted by Steve Stanchfield\n\nColumbia’s “The Untrained Seal” (1936)\n\nI think they must have loved animating fish at Screen Gems, since they may be the most fun part of this particular cartoon.\n\nTHUNDERBEAN THURSDAY posted by Steve Stanchfield\n\nA Light At The End of the Many Blu-ray Tunnels\n\nA Boy and His Dog is one of my all time favorites of the Color Rhapsodies series. It’s both beautiful and incredibly cheesy at times, with a cringeworthy little boy\n\nTHUNDERBEAN THURSDAY posted by\n\nDon’t let the bed bugs bite! “The Flop House” (1932)\n\n“Scrappy, the cute little early thirties cartoon character, runs his own sleazy flop house”. Whenever I see this cartoon, I think of that description."
