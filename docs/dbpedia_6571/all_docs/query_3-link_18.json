        "text": "We can hardly wait to tell you about the new Film Club season. We’ll be hosting already popular—plus new—events, giving more parishioners the opportunity to enjoy Film Club’s screenings with meaning. Besides our Thursday night in-person and Zoom events (with a new theme! Screen Gems—great movies you might have missed) and our Oscar festivities, we’ll be hosting two Sunday night films and an all-day Film Club retreat. Here’s a look at our planned events and our donation strategy for the coming season.\n\nIMPORTANT REMINDERS\n\nSeptember 5 is an in-person event. Look for promotional materials in the weeks ahead and pre-register to attend. When you pre-register, your donation is less than at-the-door, and it really helps us plan food and beverages.\n\nZoom events. Remember to get your personalized link to attend this season’s Zoom events. Sign-up for Zoom access begins before our first Zoom event in November.\n\nMay 16, 2024 — What a season it was…and what a finale. Some 80 people joined Film Club on our last journey of the 2023-2024 season as we traveled to Nepal and Egypt with Indiana Jones as he sought to save the Ark of the Covenant from a team of determined Nazis. Following the screening, prizes were awarded for best costumes (people came dressed for adventure!), best photos (from the fab photo booth) and to the winners of four Indiana Jones-themed games that were open prior to the screening.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark is Indiana Jones’ first of five films. It is as fresh, exciting and funny as it was in 1981. At its core, the story is about good confronting evil. Indy may not be a typical superhero but, when faced with some serious evildoers, he takes on risks, won’t quit, somehow survives and triumphs in the end.\n\nThe Film Club Team is looking forward to next season and will announce the thematic direction at summer’s end. We can tell you that we will be hosting in-person film screenings, Zoom discussions, an Oscar Night and a pre-Oscar coffee and donut event. Two of the screenings will be “Sunday Night Shorts” following the 5:30 Mass. There will also be something new: a retreat built around a film, an exciting addition to the Film Club’s lineup of “screenings with meaning.”\n\nApril 11, 2024 — Our final Zoom of this season’s Journey Series featured a lively discussion of The Miracle Club, starring Dame Maggie Smith, Kathy Bates and Laura Linney. Not only did we discuss the film but also the forms in which “miracles” can appear in our lives. Several guests commented on how they’d prayed for something as a younger person only to have it occur later in life—but it did! The movie reminded us that miracles can take many forms in our lives—and are not necessarily something that stories will be written about. They can be events or accomplishments that bring welcome consequences. The movie also reminded us that being too judgmental and holding grudges can have unfortunate consequences. It’s hard to make up for lost time.\n\nMarch 7, 2024 — Our annual Oscar Night drew two audiences! One in the Grand Pavilion and the other on Zoom. Guests were able to see trailers of the 10 films nominated by the Academy for Best Picture as well as participate in discussions about each film. The highlight of the evening was casting a ballot for Film Club’s Best Picture both in the room and online. The results were calculated and the clear winner was Oppenheimer. Film Club has perfectly predicted Oscar’s winner for a number of years — we’d have to wait a few days to see if our lucky streak would continue. This season, Film Club also hosted a Coffee, Donuts and Oscar event after the Sunday morning Masses on March 3. Parishioners were asked to vote for their favorite film — and several hundred did. The winner was also Oppenheimer, although most of the children attending the 9:30 Mass came out in force to vote for Barbie.\n\nFebruary 8, 2024 — What a great way to kick off Film Club Zooms for the new year. We discussed the Oscar winning film, Rain Man, starring Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. The duo’s journey was one of discovery for Cruise’s character whose greed and self-absorption were eventually overtaken by an awareness of family and love and concern for the brother he didn’t remember. It was a groundbreaking film in that Hoffman’s character was on the autistic spectrum and helped put a face on a condition that was not widely known at the time. The discussion was lively and meaningful and being able to reacquaint ourselves with this 1988 film was a blessing for many of us.\n\nDecember 14, 2023 — There was a whole lot of laughter going on in the Grand Pavilion when over 50 people joined us to watch Steve Martin and John Candy on their arduous holiday journey in Planes, Trains and Automobiles. The audience found the film as touching and life affirming as it was humorous. Watching the two perfectly cast leads — opposites to say the least — gradually reach a level of respect, compassion and commonality offered a rewarding and heartwarming kick-off for the holiday season.\n\nNovember 9, 2023 — We zoomed to the wilds of New Zealand to join a cranky, antisocial uncle and a “bad egg” kid as they evaded pesky child services authorities. The duo headed away from civilization that took them — and us — on a journey of discovery. The film was the charming, Hunt for the Wilder People that proved to have been an unknown gem to most of the attendees. There was lots to talk about in the film — most of it centered on the humanity and hilarity that were seamlessly combined to tell this winning story.\n\nOctober 30, 2023 — We hosted something new! A Sunday Night Short Film Special attended by 65 guests! We screened Native Ball, a Family Theater short documentary, to be released in November on PBS. Fr. David Guffey, CSC, who is executive producer of the film, offered comments about the film and answered questions. A reception followed and everybody seemed to want to hang around to talk about this remarkable Native American woman’s journey. The film gave us all a lot to think and chat about — and the wine and cheese and, of course, Halloween candy made it even harder to leave.\n\nOctober 12, 2023 — Our journey series headed to the segregated South in the 1960s as we tagged along on a concert tour with an accomplished black musician and his driver/bodyguard. The event, held on Zoom, discussed Green Book, an Oscar and Golden Globe “best picture,” inspired by a true-life story. Guests gave the film a thumb’s up for both superb acting as well as its serving as a reminder of the senseless prejudice faced by so many. The event was cosponsored by JustFaith.\n\nSeptember 14, 2023 — An in-person event, featuring Lion, kicked off our “journey series.” The film took us from India to Australia and back to India as a “lost” boy, now a man, sought to find his roots. There was standing room only as we enjoyed not only this moving real-life story but a lively discussion afterward. Our 70+ guests started the evening enjoying a special dessert on the patio.\n\nA new direction for a new season…plus annual survey results\n\nIt’s interesting how ideas evolve. A few months ago, many of you completed our Film Club survey. We appreciate the good report card you gave us for the 2022-2023 season and are grateful for your suggestions.\n\nOne of the survey questions was about the type(s) of films you preferred. We received votes for a wide array of film genres, meaning we had to figure some way to respond to your diverse preferences. Enter the evolution of an idea—that eventually became our theme for the 2023-2024 Film Club season. Here’s how our theme took shape.\n\nAt the same time as our survey, the results of a national survey of American’s summer travel plans were published. The takeaway: Travel is booming, even exceeding pre-pandemic levels. A remarkable 85% of Americans are taking to the road literally and figuratively—59 million will be exploring international byways this summer, while 100 million will be taking a trip of at least 250 miles or more in the U.S. People are opening their lives to new possibilities and experiences, and perhaps ticking off places on their bucket lists.\n\nThis American wanderlust started us thinking about the long-popular film genre that follows people on impactful life journeys. This coming season, in both our Zoom and in-person events, we’ll be exploring films of this genre. One of the things we love about “journey films” is that they are always blended with another genre (remember the list of Film Club survey favorites), such as a rom-com, intrigue, musical, etc.\n\nYou’ll soon be hearing about our first event on Sept. 14 in the Grand Pavilion and how to sign up for it as well as our Zoom season that begins on Oct. 12. We are continuing to schedule our regular events on Thursday evenings, since that is the day when Fr. David is most available to us. We will also keep the current start time since people who work cannot make it earlier than 7 pm.\n\nHere are some other Film Club survey results that may interest you:\n\nOver 80% of participants said Film Club was “great”.\n\nRespondents seemed to like both Zoom and in-person events, with only 10% preferring in-person over Zoom.\n\nRespondents felt that lower attendance at in-person events had to do with people not wanting to go to campus on a workday, LA traffic, and lingering concerns about group indoor activities.\n\nSome 92% get Film Club information from promotional emails.\n\nSome 96% were OK with the level of donations for the Zoom season and individual in-person events.\n\nOscar night and Moonstruck were the most popular in-person events and The King’s Speech was the favorite Zoom biopic.\n\n75% of participants would go off campus for an event.\n\n76% enjoy panelists and special guests at our events.\n\nThat’s it for now. Thank you for being a Film Club supporter. We look forward to sharing some wonderful film journeys with you this season in person and on Zoom.\n\nFilm Club Fans: We need your support!\n\nFilm Club is committed to bringing “screenings with meanings” to the greater St. Monica community. Thank you for being a vibrant part of our ministry —and attending our Zoom and in-person events.\n\nThere is another way to show your support: donate today!\n\nThere are two ways to donate:\n\n1.)

We ask that you make the check out to “St. Monica Catholic Community” and note in the memo line “Film Club.”"
