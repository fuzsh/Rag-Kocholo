That task puts Vera on a collision course with nurse Rose Arvale who, after a seemingly random act of violence left her in a coma for seven years, suddenly begins to stir. As Joshua, Jr. prophesied, the wheels of Revelation have begun to turn, and these five newly christened Angels of the Apocalypse may be the only hope for preventing the impending Rapture, or causing it.\n\nThe series stars Shantel VanSanten (Gang Related, One Tree Hill), Jon Fletcher (City of Dreams), Sofia Black-D'Elia (Betrayal, Gossip Girl), JD Pardo (Revolution), Joel Courtney (Super 8), Anna Diop (Everybody Hates Chris), Craig Frank (Mixology) and Diogo Morgado (Son of God, Sol de Inverno).\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nMain article: Episode Guide\n\n\"Awakening\" (pilot)\n\n\"Strange Magic\"\n\n\"Path to Paradise\"\n\n\"Drums of War\"\n\n\"Eye in the Sky\"\n\n\"Metamorphosis\"\n\n\"Deus Ex Machina\"\n\n\"A House Divided\"\n\n\"Death Becomes Her\"\n\n\"Why We Fight\"\n\n\"Harvest\"\n\n\"Spark of Hope\"\n\n\"Houston, We Have a Problem\" (finale)\n\nCast & Characters[]\n\nMain Characters[]\n\nShantel VanSanten as Vera Buckley (13/13)\n\nDiogo Morgado as \"The Man\" (13/13)\n\nJD Pardo as Raul Garcia (13/13)\n\nJoel Courtney as Peter Moore (13/13)\n\nJon Fletcher as Joshua Silburn, Jr. (13/13)\n\nSofia Black-D'Elia as Erin Calder (13/13)\n\nAnna Diop as Rose Arvale (11/13)\n\nCraig Frank as Alan Harris (9/13)\n\nRecurring/Minor Characters[]\n\nMadison Dellamea as Amy Calder (11 episodes)\n\nBrittany O'Grady as Nadia Garcia (10 episodes)\n\nJessika Van as Koa Lin (9 episodes)\n\nGlory Curda as the young Koa Lin (1 episode)\n\nKaty Rowe as Charlotte Silburn (3 episodes)\n\nSam Littlefield as Leland Schiller (9 episodes)\n\nRobb Moon as the (8 episodes)\n\nRiley Smith as Mark Plowman (7 episodes)\n\nJennifer Griffin as Eliza Shepard (7 episodes)\n\nVictor Slezak as Joshua Silburn, Snr.
