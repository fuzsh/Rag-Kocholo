While exploring the countryside in the Qu'Appelle Valley my friend Doug and I spied this awesome old farmhouse across the valley and decided we had to visit it, which involved hiking a couple of kms off the road.  When we got there, my friend exclaimed that someone had done some work to the interior.  On closer inspection, we discovered that it was not an old house but an abandoned movie set. It had been built for the horror film \"The Messengers\".  It was amazingly well done.\n\tQu'Appelle Valley, Saskatchewan",
