        "text": "Origin\n\nThe Flintstones was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, an animation studio founded by Academy Award-winning producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The studio was known for its use of limited animation, a cost-cutting process that required fewer animation cels to portray motion.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nSaturday Morning Cartoons and More\n\nJohn H. Mitchell, an executive with Screen Gems, which distributed cartoons produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, is credited with suggesting the development of a prime-time animated series. Family-based sitcoms dominated television at the time, so several comedic scenarios were proposed and rejected, including setting the series in ancient Rome. Other ideas included featuring characters such as pilgrims or hillbillies.\n\nStoryboard illustrator Dan Gordon suggested a series set in prehistoric times and quickly doodled two characters in animal skins and a bird playing a record with its beak. The opportunities for humor were clearly evident in the prehistoric setting, and the series was approved. Gordon’s sketches were given to character designer Ed Benedict, who fine-tuned them into the “modern Stone Age family” that would have a tremendous pop-culture influence in the years to come. During its development The Flintstones was titled “The Flagstones,” but the name was changed to The Flintstones at the last minute to avoid confusion with Hi and Lois Flagston, who appeared in the popular Hi and Lois newspaper comic strip created by Mort Walker and Dik Browne.\n\nMeet the Flintstones\n\nThe Flintstones is set in the town of Bedrock and features bombastic patriarch Fred Flintstone (voiced by Alan Reed); his wife, Wilma (Jean Vander Pyl); and their neighbors and best friends, Barney (Mel Blanc) and Betty Rubble (initially voiced by Bea Benaderet and later by Gerry Johnson). The relationships and behavior of the show’s four main characters would prove to be much reminiscent of that of the principals in the classic TV sitcom The Honeymooners (1955–56) starring Jackie Gleason, Audrey Meadows, Art Carney, and Joyce Randolph. Fred works as a dino-crane operator in a quarry and, along with Barney, is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes lodge. A running gag throughout the series is Fred’s efforts to get rich quick, which usually backfire.\n\nThe prospect of creating Stone Age versions of familiar modern infrastructure, modes of transportation, methods of communication, tools, appliances, and products gave the show’s writers a lot to work with. Homes in Bedrock are made of stone slabs, the cars have stone rollers instead of wheels but are propelled by the driver’s feet, and various prehistoric animals are used for everything from garbage disposals to shower nozzles. Character names also reflect the setting, such as Fred’s employer, Mr. Slate, and Fred’s lodge brother Joe Rockhead. Although aimed primarily at children, The Flintstones strongly appealed to adults. This was evidenced by animated commercials for sponsors Winston cigarettes and Busch beer featuring Fred and Barney.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Actress-singer Ann-Margret became Ann-Margrock, who babysat the Flintstones’ infant daughter, Pebbles, while helping Fred and Barney rehearse their musical act, and actor Tony Curtis became Stony Curtis, who arrives in Bedrock to film a motion picture. Other real-life personalities who voiced themselves included composer Hoagy Carmichael, actor-singer James Darren, and Jimmy O’Neill, host of the pop music-–oriented TV variety show Shindig! (1964–66). Actors Elizabeth Montgomery and Dick York voiced the characters they played on Bewitched (1964–72). Popular personalities and characters of the era also portrayed in the show included fictional trial lawyer and detective Perry Mason (Bedrockized as Perry Masonry), TV variety show host Ed Sullivan (Ed Sullystone), Beatles manager Brian Epstein (Eppy Brianstone), and the Cartrocks, a parodized version of the Cartwrights, the family at the center of the hit television western Bonanza (1959–73).\n\nSeveral special events kept The Flintstones interesting over its six-year run, including the birth of Pebbles Flintstone (Jean Vander Pyl) in season three, an event that became the show’s most-watched episode. Shortly after the birth of Pebbles, the Rubbles adopted a baby boy named Bamm-Bamm (Don Messick), who had super strength. The Great Gazoo (Harvey Korman) joined the show in season six. A diminutive alien from the planet Zetox, Gazoo has been banished to Earth for creating a bomb that could destroy the universe and forced to redeem himself by helping Fred and Barney, with comedic results."
