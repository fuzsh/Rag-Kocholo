        "text": "The trailers for “The Messengers” don’t do it justice —\n\nthere’s a lot more potential in this movie than appears in the\n\nGrudge – and The Omen -like snippets shown as teasers. The idea isn’t bad. It’s in living up\n\nto this potential that the film slips from an enjoyable, somewhat\n\ninnocuous PG-13 fright fest (on par with Signs and The Twilight Zone )\n\nto a dead-end dragger with way too much buildup for the minimal reveal.\n\nAt the center of the story is Jess Solomon (Kristen\n\nStewart), who moves with her mother, father and little\n\nbrother from Chicago to the farmlands of North Dakota. As the parents\n\n(played by Dylan McDermott and Penelope Ann Miller) continually hint,\n\nJess has some growing up to do — after being teased for what seems\n\nlike decades, audiences finally learn that 6 months prior, Jess was tipsy when got into an accident with her brother in the\n\ncar, which lead not only to obvious strife in the family but also to\n\nthe family’s savings being spent on medical bills for the toddler. His only remaining effect from the injuries is a reluctance to speak. How Original. That fact alone should tell you all you need to know about the big\n\nfinale.\n\nThe family is moving to make a fresh start, and what better\n\nplace than a rickety abandoned structure that despite being\n\nsurrounded by sunny fields remains perpetually in shadow.\n\nAs the father, McDermott seems content to act as if the\n\nrole of dad could be accomplished by simply directing the phrases\n\n“We’ve got to make this work,” “That’s what I’m talking\n\nabout,” and “I love you sport,” to his wife, guy friend, and\n\ndaughter, respectively. He is determined to deny all the signs of a\n\nfamily about to enter a horror movie, in favor of proving that he can\n\ndo it — he can run the farm, he can hold the family together, he can\n\nbe completely oblivious to every bad omen possible cliche.\n\nBy the time all the family secrets are revealed,\n\nhowever, hints about the family’s past — Jess’s “mistake”\n\nespecially — have been hinted at so much that the satisfaction of\n\nfinally being told is outweighed by both resentment for\n\nhaving been teased and (in “mistake’s” case) distaste at the\n\nseriousness of the offense. This pattern of excessively long, drawn\n\nout teases followed by anticlimactic unveilings and ultimate\n\ndisappointment is not, to put it diplomatically, limited to this one\n\ninstance.\n\nAs Jess begins to experience haunting that only she and\n\nher little brother perceive, the film shows glimpses of\n\npromise. The intensity of the suspense and creepy images and the intensified trust issues between Jess and her parents lies a glimmer of a better film. The\n\nshock at realizing that walls torn apart, lamps broken and windows\n\nshattered reassemble miraculously before the mother and father return\n\nhome is thrilling in a surreal, psychological way, bringing not only\n\nghosts and ghouls to the table but dream-like mind games as well.\n\nGiven this and a few moments of strategic misdirection, and it’s\n\nrefreshing to see a horror film that tries to get its shocks from plot twists rather\n\nthan gore. But ultimately, these messengers show up empty-handed.\n\nParents should know that characters refer to driving\n\nunder the influence, and the opening scenes depict a mother and\n\ndaughter being beaten by an invisible force while a young son looks\n\non in terror. There are moments of suspense and some\n\nfrightening and disturbing images of ghosts. Most of the film’s\n\nviolence stems from the spirit world, but there are several instances\n\nof living characters directing violence at one another. Keeping the\n\nfilm well under the R-rating radar, however, the language is tame and\n\nsexual content limited to a bad pun on the Kama Sutra.\n\nFamilies who see this film should talk about the\n\nimportance of trust between parents and children. Jess tells a peer\n\nthat when her parents asked her to pick up her brother and drive him\n\nhome, she was afraid to tell them she had been drinking with friends\n\n(and thus made the incredible mistake of going to pick up her brother\n\nwhile still under the influence). Why does staying silent about\n\nhaving been drinking betray her parents’ trust? Could Jess have\n\ntrusted her parents to respect her honesty if she told them the truth\n\nabout not being able to drive, even if it meant facing their\n\ndisappointment in her decision to drink?"
