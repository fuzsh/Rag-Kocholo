        "text": "“The Grudge” (2020) serves as a sequel or a continuation of the curse that was spawned in the original. This story begins with a woman working in the initial home where The Grudge was born. Appearing frightened, worried and anxious to go home after encountering strange happenings in the cursed home. We then see her arrive back in the States seemingly happy. We are then introduced to newly widowed woman Detective Muldoon (Andrea Riseborough) and her son still dealing with the death of her husband. They recently moved to a new town. Muldoon and her new partner Detective Goodman (Demián Bichir) begin their first case together which is actually linked to a puzzling case in Goodman’s past. That’s the set up for a decent attempt to revamp the franchise.\n\nThe acting is slightly above average with veteran actors including Demián Bichir, John Cho, Lin Shaye, and William Sadler putting forth note worthy efforts that make the film feel authentic. In my opinion, Detective Muldoon’s character drags the film down. She has no real character foundation, so the events that occur around her seem orchestrated. She is more of a place marker then an actual participant in the storyline. The plot plays out as a spider web, different ends tied together, and it may work for viewing audiences that pay close attention. The cinematography is well done, nothing feels cheap or overly CGI.\n\nThere is some objectionable content. There is a handful of foul language—completely unnecessary. Drinking and smoking are used as a coping mechanism throughout by the principle characters. There are scary and gory images and dark themes dealing with spirits and curses.\n\nAs for a biblical message, there is a surprise. It has a strong pro-life message, but this is slightly undercut by an assisted suicide subplot point. The film has an unbiblical theme about a house that can keep dead people’s spirits alive on Earth. This theme in common with a many horror films. One detective has numerous Roman Catholic idols all over his car. We as Christians don’t rely on idols for protection. We also know that “And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment” (Hebrews 9:27).\n\nThis film is not the worst installment or sequel in the horror genre, but it’s not a standout either. However, there are some very dark images and themes that may warrant a skip.\n\nViolence: Very Heavy\n\nDrugs/Alcohol: Heavy drinking and smoking\n\nOccult: Unbiblical ghost and haunted house theme\n\nProfane language: Heavy— • “Oh J*sus Chr*st” • “G*d” (4) • H*ll\n\nVulgar/Crude language: Heavy— • f-words (4 or more) • s-words (9 or more) • “I'm gonna murder you with deliciousness” • “Broads”\n\nNudity: Mild— • Man showers (bare torso shown) • Shirtless man\n\nSex: Mild— • Brief heterosexual kiss\n\nLearn about DISCERNMENT—wisdom in making personal entertainment decisions\n\nEvery time you buy a movie ticket or buy or rent a video you are in effect casting a vote telling Hollywood, “I’ll pay for that. That’s what I want.” Read our article"
