        "text": "Compiled by Brent Pennel, Pauline Testerman, and Amy L. Williams (2003); Pauline Testerman (2007, 2009).\n\nThe Screen Gems Collection consists of outtakes created during the production of the film series, Decision: The Conflicts of Harry S. Truman. Included is material created by both Talent Associates, Ltd. and Screen Gems, Inc. Material ranges from informal interviews with Truman, members of his family, and associates, to more formal, scripted readings by Truman. There are a few instances of historical footage from unknown sources that was gathered for use in the production. The subject matter includes Truman's personal life as well as his decisions as president. Sound recordings comprise about 90% of the collection. Formats include 35mm and 16mm black and white film, reel-to-reel tape, and 35mm and 16mm soundtracks."
