Complement your Clear Base Plate Pack with our Clear Starter Pack and Pastel Mega Pack to take your CONNETIX creations to the next level.\n\nAbout Our Products:\n\nAll tiles are made using non-toxic ABS plastic that is BPA and Phthalate free, sealed and riveted for extra safety.\n\nOur unique beveled design allows CONNETIX to be strong while offering beautiful clear refractions.\n\nCONNETIX are compatible with other leading brands.\n\nRecommended Age: 3+ (contains magnets and small parts)."
