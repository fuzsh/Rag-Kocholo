To accomplish this purpose, we applied a dendroecological approach using ring-width chronologies comprising the last 112 years and annual time series of carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) for the last 90 years, and we characterized climate-growth and climate- Δ13Crelationships. The relationships between climate factors and either radial growth (tree-ring width indices, TRWi) or carbon isotope discrimination were evaluated by bootstrap correlations. Inter-series comparisons showed a good agreement among trees growing at each site and, thus, strong common signals in both tree-ring proxies, suggesting that they hold relevant environmental information. The results revealed negative correlations between TRWi and temperatures in autumn of the previous year, spring and summer. Conversely, a rainy October of the preceding year and a rainy late winter-spring showed a strong positive correlation with tree growth. Thus, we can confirm that low precipitation and high temperatures were limiting factors for most growing season. SPEI drought index depicted similar relationships with TRWi as rainfall, indicating that SPEI variability is dominated by precipitation. Interestingly, Δ13C was mainly influenced by the increasing temperature trend over the study period at the site and inter- site levels for almost all months of the year, and especially in summer, as shown by significant negative correlations between both factors. This is interpreted as an effect of temperature increasing drought stress through increased evapotranspiration, which means an increase of water-use efficiency over time. After detrending of Δ13C chronologies (i.e. elimination of the low-frequency temperature trend), precipitation and SPEI appeared to also influence the isotope carbon discrimination records, as inferred by positive correlations with October of the previous year and spring rainfall. The results of both proxies demonstrate that the main common signal recorded in tree rings is drought, but Δ13Cvalues were extremely sensitive to temperature, which translated into important increases in water-use efficiency. As expected, P.halepensis growth and carbon isotope discrimination were strongly dependent on water availability in Djelfa, but the important decrease in Δ13C values over time suggests a forced physiological response of the trees that may indicate limited responsiveness to future global warming. 8 Key words: Dendroecology, tree-ring width, carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C), Pinus halepensis. 1. Introduction 1.1. Climate change and Mediterranean areas Current and predicted patterns of global climate change are an important concern in many socio- economic activities, such as agriculture, forestry, food and energy security, etc., and also a major threat for biodiversity and ecosystem function. The effects of climate change have become particularly evident over the last 30 years in natural environments and are affecting all life forms: from the individual, population, species, community and ecosystem to the eco-regional level (Lepetz et al., 2009). Climate change is especially rapid and extreme in the Mediterranean basin (Thuiller et al., 2005; Giorgi and Lionell., 2008; Lindner et al., 2010). This is especially problematic because of its importance as biodiversity hot-spot and its geo-strategic position in the world. Climate models project an elevation of air temperatures and a decrease in annual mean precipitation over the Mediterranean Basin for the twenty-first century, and therefore a decrease in water availability due to increased evapotranspiration (Parry et al., 2007). Results of some projections indicate that temperatures over the region could rise by about 3.5°C between now and the latter half of the 21st century in response to a doubling of carbon dioxide (or its equivalent) (Wigley, 1992). In addition to a precipitation decrease, annual rainfall patterns have also changed or are expected to change, including episodes rain intensity (De Luis et al., 2001). Altogether, this scenario may have a strong effect on forest growth, because trees are adapted to thrive in a given climate and water regime. But climate change is also decreasing the availability of water resources in the Mediterranean region, leading to plant water stress, as it is projected in figure 1. The North African countries, with semiarid and arid desert climates, are especially vulnerable to climate change. Model projections available for the region indicate a clear increase in temperature over the next 20 years that is expected to continue throughout the 21st century, probably at a rate higher than the estimated global average (Agoumi, 2003). A new reconstruction of the past climate of the Maghreb has inferred that 20th century was the driest in North Africa since the severe droughts occurring in the 13th and 16th centuries (Touchan et al., 9 2010). The projections also point to a decrease of 4% to 27% in annual rainfall (PNUE, 2008). Therefore, water deficit, which represents a major risk for the region, will be worsened by an increase in evaporation rates. Indeed, water scarcity will be one of the most critical problems to be faced by North African countries in the future. For instance, it is predicted that Morocco and Algeria’s water resources will decline by 10-15% in 2020, Tunisia’s water resources will drop by 28% in 2030, and most Egyptian people (75%) will have less than adequate fresh water by the same year (Paeth et al, 2009).
