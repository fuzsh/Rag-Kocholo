        "text": "Drought has become a recurrent phenomenon in Algeria in the last few decades. Significant drought conditions were observed during the late 1980s and late 1990s. The agricultural sector and water resources have been under severe constraints from the recurrent droughts. In this study, spatial and temporal dimensions of meteorological droughts in the Wadi Mina basin (4900 km2) were investigated to assess vulnerability. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) method and GIS were used to detail temporal and geographical variations in drought based on monthly records for the period 1970–2010 at 16 rainfall stations located in the Wadi Mina basin. Trends in annual SPI for stations in the basin were analyzed using the Mann–Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator. Results showed that the SPI was able to detect historical droughts in 1982/83, 1983/84, 1989/90, 1992/93, 1993/94, 1996/97, 1998/99, 1999/00, 2004/05 and 2006/07. Wet years were observed in 1971/72, 1972/73, 1995/96, 2008/09 and ...\n\nDue to the lack of studies on drought in the Lower Sebou basin (LSB), the complexity of drought event and the difference in climate conditions. The identification of the most appropriate drought indices (DIs) to assess drought conditions has become a priority. Therefore, assessing the performance of different drought indices was considered in order to identify the universal drought indices that are well adapted to the LSB. Based on data availability, five DIs were used: Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI) and Streamflow Drought Index (SDI). The DIs were calculated on an annual scale using monthly time series of precipitation, temperature and river flow from 1984-2016. Thornthwaite&#39;s method was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration (PET). Pearson&#39;s correlation (r) were analyzed. Furthermore, five decision crit...\n\nDrought is one of the important phenomena resulting from variability and climate change. It has negative effects on all economic, agricultural and social sectors. The objective of this study is to rapidly detect climate dryness situations on an annual scale at the Mellah catchment (Northeast Algeria) for periods ranging from 31 years through the calculation of: the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the standardized Streamflow index (SSFI), the standardized temperature index (STI). Calculations made it possible to locate periods of drought more precisely by their intensity, duration and frequency, and detect years of breaks using the tests of Pettitt, rang, Lee and Heghinian, Hubert and Buishand. The use of the statistical tests for the rainfall series analyzed show all breaks, the majority of which are in 1996/1997 and 2001/2002. For the temperatures the breaks are situated in 1980/1981.\n\nAlgeria is amongst the African countries most affected by climate change impacts especially by drought which caused considerable economic losses in the past decades. In this paper, drought monitoring for the period between 1970 and 2011 was conducted in the Seybouse watershed by analysing annual rainfall data in terms of variability and trends along with the calculation of the standardized precipitation index (SPI). The results indicated important inter-annual rainfall fluctuation and a significant increasing trend. The estimated drought indices indicated that the Seybouse watershed experienced in the past a long dry period with a moderate severity followed by a long wet period at the majority of the study area. Moreover, the interpolation of the standardized precipitation indices (SPI) on the entire Seybouse basin in GIS allowed visualizing and evaluating the spatial-temporal evolution of drought in the region which should help the decision-makers in the management of water resourc...\n\nOne of the adverse impacts of climate change is drought, and the complex nature of droughts makes them one of the most important climate hazards. Drought indices are generally used as a tool for monitoring changes in meteorological, hydrological, agricultural and economic conditions. In this study, we focused on meteorological drought events in the High Ziz river Basin, central High Atlas, Morocco. The application of drought index analysis is useful for drought assessment and to consider methods of adaptation and mitigation to deal with climate change. In order to analyze drought in the study area, we used two different approaches for addressing the change in climate and particularly in precipitation, i) to assess the climate variability and change over the year, and ii) to assess the change within the year timescale (monthly, seasonally and annually) from 1971 to 2017. In first approach, precipitation data were used in a long time scale e.g. annual and more than one-year period. Fo...\n\nOur research consists on the one hand to study the evolution of the rainfall data and the annual and monthly temperatures observed in the Algiers region and on the other hand to analyze the sequences of the climatic drought in using statistical methods such as drought indices. The statistical study of rainfall series in the Algiers region reveals a large variation of the wet and the dry years in space and time. The series of measurements of 1967-2015 are repeated in years of drought (moderate or high). Indeed, the last three decades (1980, 1990 and 2000) are particularly concerned by this situation of annual rainfall deficit.\n\nDrought events were assessed using remote sensing index MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) over the steppe regions of Algeria between 2000 and 2012. In this study, the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI) were determined from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) was based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets. The TCI (Temperature Condition Index) was derived from land surface temperature (LST) datasets. The VCI and TCI were then combined to calculate the Vegetation Health Index (VHI). Also, the one-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) data from rainfall stations in the study area was calculated. The results show that years of normal condition (least drought) were year 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2012. However, all indices recorded a drought with different classes for 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005,...\n\nDrought is one of the most serious problems for human societies and ecosystems, caused by climate variability. This phenomenon is of great importance in the world, especially in North Africa Countries like Algeria. In this study, rainfall of 16 stations in the Wadi Mina Basin (4900 km²), in the Northwest of Algeria were statistically analysed over a 40 years period (1970/71- 2009/10). The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) application showed that the first principal component (PC1) explains more than 66 % of the variance. Rainfall data showed two different periods: a wet period from (1970 to 1980 and from 2008 to 2009) and a dry period from 1980 to 2007. The basic characteristics of drought; duration, intensity and frequency were studied. Several recommendations are proposed for a good water management to alleviate the impact of these climatic changes. Strategic measures will be taken, such as, sensitizing the population for water economy, generalization of localised irrigations sys..."
