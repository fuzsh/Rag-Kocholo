Educa33e\n\nThis is a very very good idea. Also, captions like {{English}} foo or {{Deutsch}} foo should be converted to {{xx|Foo}}. pfctdayelise (说什么?)\n\nSo is [[1]] right? Maelgwn\n\nWhile looking at uncategorized pages I have stumbled across broken <gallery> </gallery> tags; where the gallery is started with <gallery> but an editor forgets the close the gallery (or makes a mistaking doing so). Example 1, example 2. Could a bot find broken gallery tags and make a list so people can fix them? I guess you could use a database dump. Cheers, --Commander Keane\n\nThis should be possible with a simple regex which matches when both #\\<gallery\\># and #%\\<\\\\gallery\\># are true. Lcarsdata\n\nCan a bot please remove the text between |Meta= and [[Image: in images using {{St-fl/ownpic}}? Example Thanks, --Stefan ■\n\nHi folks, since I'm on an awfull slow connection that doesn't allow me to upload pictures I'd like to upload them via php script from my webspace. Does anyone have code or snippets that could help me doing this? I'm capable of writing php but I don't want to reinvent the wheen in case anyone did that before. Thanks in advance, --Flominator\n\nSome LOC images have hires tiff versions associated. Some bot should convert them to jpg and upload them. -- Bryan (talk to me)\n\nThere are probably nearly a million, if not more images on flickr which aren't properly categorized or listed on a page. Could we get a bot to go through all the images (I realize this would be time consuming if not to be too much of a server hog), and to tag any images which aren't in a category. Specifically, the bot would have to ignore categories that are only a subset of Category:Copyright statuses, Category:Image sources, Category:Commons, and perhaps Category:Media types. A really good bot could plop a message on the userpage of uploaders who frequently have had problems not marking images. Patstuart\n\nuntil someone fulfils your request, try Category:Media needing categories --Flominator\n\nCould someone please change the description of all GNOME Desktop icons from\n\n{{Free screenshot|template=GPL}}\n\nto more precisely\n\n{{GNOME-icon-theme}}\n\n--Matt\n\nActually, I just noticed this request but I had the same idea a couple days ago and already did it. :) - Rocket000\n\nLooking for bot-master, who can write the bot, which can autoretag the most of respective images by suitable license using this and that pages.\n\nExample: [2]\n\nOr, if this quest is enough complex and needs more time than 7 days 6 days (time is ticking) - just take away {{No license}} from respective pages temporarily. Alex Spade\n\nWork 1\n\nIt is needed that VI.com tag will be returned on images from which it was accidentally removed by BierBot[3] before close of del.req Commons:Deletion requests/Template:Vector-Images.com (2nd request)‎ .\n\nThe list of images for bot-work can be found here.\n\nThis work is not simle back of template. The replacement {{PD- --> {{Vector-Images.com|PD- and removing of words \"This File is from [http://www.Vector-Images.com Vector-Images.com] and is PD because of the license below/above\" must be made.\n\nExample is here.\n\nIt is needed that the next replacement for images from Category:VI.com images (tag isn't updated) will be made.\n\nIf image have got {{PD- template - unite it with VI.com-template.\n\nExample is here.\n\nAlex Spade\n\nP.S. Wait for Category:Vector-Images.com images purge as a result of job queue for recat of images with Template:Vector-Images.com. Alex Spade\n\nReasonably sure I can do 1 easily. I'd have to think a bit harder about #2. I'll let you know. – Mike.lifeguard | @en.wb\n\nOK, #1 is done. I had trouble building a good regex for #2, so you'll have to get someone else to look at it. – Mike.lifeguard | @en.wb\n\nWorking... 哦，是吗？(О кириллицей) 21:12, 23 March 2008 (GMT)\n\nThe current replacement is broken. I've seen a lot of cases with {{Vector-Images.com|PD-self}} which is never the correct license. If it's Vector-images.com image then by default it's not PD-self. If it's a derivative of a Vector-images.com image where the own edits are under PD-self then the restricting license is still that of Vector-images.com. Also the current replacement seems to add an extra {{Vector-Images.com}} tag to the page instead of replacing the old one. /Lokal_Profil\n\nThe placements of the templates are odd at some places, which is the reason why a proper regex couldn't be written. Furthermore, lots of these images only have {{Vector-Images.com}} without a separate licence template. 哦，是吗？(О кириллицей) 22:46, 23 March 2008 (GMT)\n\nWork 2\n\nOk. Let's try another way. I made new list (User:Alex Spade/4Bot) using \"Category (recursive)\" on Category:Coats of arms of Russia (without \"proposal\") and comparison of it and Category:VI.com images (tag isn't updated). The bot must replaced:\n\n{{Vector-Images.com}} --> {{Vector-Images.com|PD-RU-exempt}}\n\nAlex Spade\n\nList looks good. it's probably easier to do it like this, i.e. a nation by nation bot list. That way there can later be a list for, say, Estonian CoA's as {{Vector-Images.com|PD-EE-exempt}} and for, say, Swedish CoA's as {{Vector-Images.com|Copyvio}}. /Lokal_Profil\n\nI will have done this work myself using my own bot User:SpadeBot. Alex Spade\n\nWhen images are moved to commons via CommonsHelper, they sometimes get {{PD-user}} which adds it to Category:Unknown (since there's no user specified). But the user is known. It's whoever the first uploader was at the other wiki (unless they specified a different user, in which case the user would be specified here). Is it possible to get some bot to go through pages which transclude {{PD-user}} and are in Category:Unknown - No timestamp given and change {tlx|PD-user}} → {{PD-user|earliest uploader}}? The form of these pages is highly standardized since they all use wikitext outputted from CommonsHelper. – Mike.lifeguard | @en.wb\n\nCan one bot operator start the move of these Category:French (I added ogg files in this category) into this category please Category:French Language ? Thank you, ----Erkan Yilmaz (discussion, wiki blog)\n\nDone, by Erkan-Bot, ----Erkan Yilmaz (discussion, wiki blog)\n\nThere are several hundreds of pages in Category:Municipalities of Brazil that are also in subcategories of Category:Municipalities of Brazil by state, which is itself a subcategory of Category:Municipalities of Brazil. So, there is a redundant generic category that should be removed. I started doing this but they are way too many - hence the request for a bot help. Thanks, Patrícia msg\n\nMy bot is working on it. Multichill\n\nThank you! Patrícia msg\n\nDone Couple of leftovers you should check manually. Maybe an idea to put the subcats of Category:Municipalities of Brazil by state directly in Category:Municipalities of Brazil and delete Category:Municipalities of Brazil by state? Multichill\n\nThank you again. That's probably not a bad idea, I'll talk to some pt users to have further opinions. I'll check the leftovers :). Patrícia msg\n\nFor give me if this has already been proposed, but, how about a robot which puts in the back links from commons to Wikipedia based upon the {{Commonscat}} templates. If this is to dangerous how about one which finds a link from commons to a Wikipedia, then checks that Wikipedia page for other language versions, visits them to add commons links and then add the back link from commons to all the relevant Wikipedia languages. I've done this by hand on a few pages but it's a real chore. Railwayfan2005\n\nYou may wish to try Commons:Bots/Requests. Cheers! --Bossi (talk • gallery • contrib)\n\nAs suggested I've copied this over from Commons:Village pump Railwayfan2005\n\nI'm working on this. Did a test a couple of weeks ago, but i have to tweak it. Multichill\n\nOnly just noticed this, but I have proposal open here on en.wikipedia that looks related to this. TarHippo (talk)\n\nOk, let's first figure out what the bot should do.\n\nThe bot only runs in the category namespace (for now)\n\nFor each language there should be a link to a category or an article\n\nWe prefer categories, but when no category link is present, dont delete the article link\n\nWhat to do when multiple wikipedia categories point to the same commons category?\n\nThe bot could work like this:\n\nTake the interwiki's from the wikipedia category\n\nTake the interwiki's from the commons category\n\nCopy interwiki's from wikipedia category into \"new links\"\n\nFor interwiki in interwiki's from commons category:\n\nIf language is already present in new links, skip it\n\nIf the language isnt already present in new links, add the link to new links\n\nThis wont take care of point 4, but we can look into that later. Any thoughts? Multichill (talk)\n\nI prefer to link the category here to the articles there. Perhaps it is specific to the kind of category that I have been working in, but linking from category to category doesn't make as much sense. To me, this is an image location and like a library that way with images instead of books. To see a set of similar images, like of a place or of a species of bug or flower and use the interwiki link to quickly get to the documentation about them is so convenient and wonderful -- it is the stuff about the pictures, not choices (which I might not be informed enough to make well) of stuff about the pictures. -- carol (talk)\n\nSorry for the late reply to this. I definitely agree with Multichill's strategy, and starting with categories seems a good idea, just because it is less complicated. In time I think adding commons to Wikipedia articles would be good, and of course there is the question of galleries here to factor in.\n\nUsing interwikis is certainly good because it means that a human somewhere has made the link between commons and a Wikipedia, and the interwiki bots tend to be reliable.\n\nAs far the problematic point 4 goes, my first thought was trying to favor categories with more interwiki links, or something similar, but it makes keeping track of everything far more complicated. I was wondering if we could use something similar to CheckUsage to find the categories of articles in which images in a commons category appear, but that may cause too much server load. TarHippo (talk)\n\nOften, I am finding galleries which are unmaintained or just pasted image names between gallery tags to which the category is far more informative. On the occasion that the gallery is superior to the category (and there are examples of this) the commons gallery is pointed to. Okay, just to be clear, that is how I work with this information on articles at the encyclopedia wikis.\n\nHere, at the image repository, when working within a category, be it sorting images that are in them or looking for an image to use for one of the encyclopedia articles, a link to the article is the most helpful -- in fact, I cannot (yet) imagine a task yet where a link to the category at the encyclopedias would be desireable. And, as I stated a few days ago, this might be something that is symptomatic to the subjects I have been working in the most (plants and rockets...). -- carol (talk)\n\nI think I agree with you, especially as regards abandoned galleries, and links to articles are definitely the most desirable, ultimately. I think it's going to technically more challenging to get the linking right to articles, though not impossible by any means. TarHippo (talk)\n\nHi,\n\nI would like to ask a bot to move content from one category to another:\n\nContent from Category:Canadian ice hockey players to Category:Ice hockey players from Canada\n\nContent from Category:Czech ice hockey players to Category:Ice hockey players from the Czech Republic\n\nContent from Category:Slovak ice hockey players to Category:Ice hockey players from Slovakia\n\nThanks a lot, --Xgeorg\n\nDone. Multichill\n\nThanks a lot, should I ask to delete the old categories soon? --Xgeorg\n\nRedirects dont hurt. Multichill\n\nI need a bot to stop a bot and undo what the bot did. -- carol (tomes)\n\nThank you. Twice or three times even. If it can undo the removal from category without removing the adding to gallery, then I am certainly glad that there is a bot from nl on the job! -- carol (tomes)\n\nI just reverted the edits in which the categories were removed. Multichill\n\nThank you -- carol (tomes)\n\nAnyone? Rocket000 (talk)\n\nI'm happy to take on board some of the big ones tomorrow if you like (not much time tonight). giggy (:O)\n\nI was hoping someone could write a bot to go through all of them and automatically recategorize by pulling the target from the {{category redirect}} (but I don't know how to do this). I did few runs per category too but we really need a bot to continuously go though all of them. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nP.S. I can make that category sort by how many files are in each with the ones with the most at the top. Would that be useful? Rocket000 (talk)\n\nIt wouldnt be so hard to write a bot to automagicly do this. Lets see.\n\nFor category in Category:Non-empty category redirects\n\nGet redirect target (and do some checking)\n\nFor each page (image, category, gallery)\n\nReplace old cat with new cat\n\nLike this? Multichill (talk)\n\nYep, that should work - I'm an AWB user so can't do it, but someone with more skill surely could. giggy (:O)\n\nOk, this is pretty straightforward to implement in pywikipedia. I'll write it and commit it to pywikipedia so that other people can run it too. Multichill (talk)\n\nBot is up and running. Multichill (talk)\n\nDone. It's empty now. Multichill (talk)\n\nAwesome! Thank you! Is it in the pywikipedia nightly? Rocket000 (talk)\n\nThis may be a problem if a few risks are not mitigated. I once wrote a specification for this bot (Commons:CategoryRedirectBot). User:Filnik is supposed to have written a(n almost) complete implementation. I think it would be a good idea to not have this bot run unattended until all edits are caused by actions of trusted users. Cheers! Siebrand\n\nThe source is now available. You only have to add a trusted user system. This can probably be copied from somewhere else (Beta's imagecopy tool? Erwin's category move?). Multichill (talk)\n\nCategory:Nature in Montenegro is the first time I have seen a category named like this. Usually the Nature categories are named \"Nature of\".\n\nThis request is to move the contents of Category:Nature in Montenegro to Category:Nature of Montenegro. -- carol (talk)\n\nThere is a Category:Nature in Serbia also whose contents could be moved to Category:Nature of Serbia which also exists. -- carol (talk)\n\nI am not certain of the reason for the redirection that was put to this -- I thought when I went from Category:Viola (plant) to the category for viola that I would see a stringed instrument. Instead I see that delightful little {{Seecat}} whose usefulness is being undone by abuse.\n\nIt is not even replaced with a disambiguation or anything. Can this be replaced? And here is another problem. People who apply {{Seecat}} also feel fine and allowed to remove {{Delete}} templates, so I don't even know if I could ask for this the right way without initiating an edit war. I highly doubt that this one was asked for the right way.... -- carol (talk)\n\nIt breaks Template:Violaceae species and the soon to be made Template:Violaceae for what appears to be no reason. -- carol (talk)\n\nI recently uploaded those photographs User:Esby/gallery#Adolfo Farsari (1841 - 1898) Album\n\nNow I made an error in the birth date of the original photograph. I corrected a few photograph description,\n\nI'd be happy if someone with a bot can do the rest of the correction. By replacing \"(Original work: Adolfo Farsari 1881 - 1898)\" with \"(Original work: Adolfo Farsari 1841 - 1898)\".\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEsby (talk)\n\nDone. Multichill (talk)\n\nThanks.Esby (talk)\n\nWould a bot be able to go through the list of fully protected pages and add {{Permprot}} to the talk pages in cases where the protection is indef. Example edit. Thanks. —Giggy\n\nMany of our templates are indefinitely protected now... everything over 1000+ links. We just deprecated {{Protected template}} since not being protected is now the exception. It's like the MediaWiki namespace; users will come to expect most templates to be fully protected indefinitely. Check out Special:MostLinkedTemplates, nearly 500 template talk pages would need this. Is there some recent issue about users not knowing about {{Editprotected}} or how to find COM:AN or how to ask some admin? Rocket000 (talk)\n\nNo recent issues that I'm aware; I think it should be standard practice because not everyone is a Commons regular (and editprotected isn't used everywhere, despite being popular). —Giggy\n\nOk, they are helpful sometimes. Maybe we should only tag the popular ones and ones with translations possible or ones with active talk pages. Many simply don't need it like {{!}} or {{Edit}}... no chance of those ever changing, but then again you always have those who think 100 interwiki links to exactly the same thing is helpful. Some have /doc pages, though, so that helps. I think I'll take on this task. Give me a day or so. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nWe've recently come to the realization that there are many files on Commons that are obvious Copyvio's. One that state they are copyright in the Metadata. Generally from places like Getty images. We really should have a bot that looks around once in a while and checks these out - then nom's for deletion - or something. --ShakataGaNai ^_^\n\nA search doesnt seem to return much or are you talking about exif data? That's a hard one i guess. Multichill (talk)\n\nSee this as an example. --Kanonkas(talk)\n\nI'm trying to reduce the amount of files in Category:Houses in Florida. Would it be possible to have all the images in that category whose name begins Image:DeFuniak Springs Hist Dist moved to Category:Houses in Walton County, Florida? If more info is needed, or haven't explained clearly, please do contact me. Thanks! :) --Ebyabe (talk)\n\nDone, Multichill (talk)\n\nI uploaded some time ago pictures of various comic author taken at the Comic Festival of Sollies.\n\nI did an error in naming pictures of an author, Luc Lefèbvre also known as 'Ptiluc'. http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&ns0=1&ns6=1&ns9=1&ns12=1&ns14=1&redirs=1&search=ptitluc&limit=100&offset=0\n\nThere is an extra 't' in each photograph name that should be here. The photograph sets starts at 00 and finishes at 52, I decided to not upload some photographs of the sets, when the main subject of the photograph was too fidel to the original drawing which is property of his author (Ptiluc here).\n\nWhat should be done here?\n\nHave a bot tags for renaming the photographs of this serie? (I assume an admin would still have to accept the renaming request, which would be painful still?)\n\nUpload again the entire sets and requests deletion of the wrongly named serie?\n\nDo something else?\n\nEsby (talk)\n\nHello,\n\nDue to a bug with Markus' CommonsHelper tool, files uploaded with CommonsHelper have a probel with their accentuated letters. This a problem for imports from the French wikipedia (amongst others) as we use many accents. So could a bot please go through all images in Category:Files moved from fr.wikipedia to Commons requiring review and make the following replacements, please :\n\n\"Ã©\" -> \"é\"\n\n\"Ã®\" or \"Ãª\" -> \"ê\"\n\n\"Ã§\" -> \"ç\"\n\n\"Ã \" -> \"à\" (yes, there is as spare space)\n\n\"Å\" -> \"œ\"\n\n\"Ã¨\" -> \"è\"\n\n\"Â°\" -> \"°\" (we use it for centuries)\n\n\"Ã´\" -> \"ô\"\n\nReplacements can be done everywhere (plain text, links, categories...). The \"bad\" letter sequence is always unused in French so the bot can run automatically I guess. This doesn't cover all mistakes but it will already help a lot !\n\nThank you, le Korrigan →bla\n\n(note that I have asked Magnus for help about this, without any reply so far :-( )\n\nSupport --Foroa (talk)\n\nMagnus doesnt seem very responsive lately. I wonder if my bot is affected too, do you have an image at fr wikipedia which i can move to Commons to test it? Do you have some example images for me to test with here? Multichill (talk)\n\nSure. You can upload images from fr:user:ByB (personal pictures only, good license) for instance. If you need I can provide a list of other images you can upload. To test here, many images in Category:Files moved from fr.wikipedia to Commons requiring review have this issue, but we can quote Image:-20 ans par cantons-1999-Limousin.jpg or Image:FR-55-Chauvency-le-Ch teau.jpg. You can also search one of the mistakes above like \"Ã©\"... le Korrigan →bla\n\nSo, anybody who would like to take this simple task of replacing the accents ? le Korrigan →bla\n\nDone — Mike.lifeguard | @en.wb\n\nThanks a lot !! le Korrigan →bla\n\nPlease change this text in Communuty portal(every language). #vandalism-commons channel is now unused, but #cvn-commons is now avaliable.

Thanks! Evrik (talk)\n\nProbably easiest to ask an interwiki bot operator directly. — Mike.lifeguard | @en.wb\n\nI'm not sure interwiki bot will run properly in commons.--Kwj2772 (d)\n\nHello,\n\nA french contributor requested a bot changed the licence of his picture. The request is w:fr:Wikipédia:Bot/Requêtes#Commons_:_changement_de_licence\n\nchange {{PD-self}} to {{GFDL}}\n\nmaybe change |Permission=Public Domain to |Permission=GFDL\n\nfor all picture in Category:Photos by KoS\n\nThis diff is the proof that the request really comes from KoS\n\nCan a bot manage it and tell us on french wikipedia when it will be done?\n\nRegards\n\n--Hercule (talk)\n\nHello. Copyright holder already published under public domain. It is NOT revokable. Author already gave up his copyright. So it's simply, Not done.--Kwj2772 (d)\n\nThanks for this response --Hercule (talk)\n\nActually, according to french law, I think he has the right to retract his works (and possibly licence them again under GFDL or not distribute them again.)\n\nHe is asking us to change from PD to GFDL which stays a free licence.\n\nFrom commons point of view, those licences are still fine, we have nothing to lose, those licences might be better than PD ones, (which can lead to reuses in non free work).\n\nMaybe we could possibly try to ask him if he'd agree to licence his images under CC-BY and GFDL ( dual licence) to avoid licence issues.\n\nEsby (talk)\n\nAuthor has given up his copyright. So he abandoned all rights including a right to change these license.--Kwj2772 (d)\n\nI think that French citizen can *not* use the licence PD. Cdlt, VIGNERON * discut.\n\nYes, we can use it, but the second line of {{PD-self}} applies (\"In case this is not legally possible: I grant anyone the right to use this work for any purpose, without any conditions, unless such conditions are required by law.\"). le Korrigan →bla\n\nStill he is allowed to retract his work. It's a moral right, defined by the \"Code de la Propriété Intellectuelle', known as 'Droit de retrait' See fr:Droit_d'auteur#Droit_moral. Moral rights cannot be denied , removed or transferred (while they can be inherited at the death of the author).\n\nThe part that PD licence being is irevocable is right (althought only partially, since the 'droit de retrait' can still be applied, legally speaking), but the PD licence is not between Commons and the Author, but between the author and the end user. If an end user was granted PD, he has the right to use PD, if another one is granted another licence, then he must use this given licence. Here he is just asking the right to change his work to a free licence, which stays under the Commons scope, it's not like if he was asking to remove completely his files from Commons. It's not because we can be arrogant and pesty towards users that do mistakes and understand the nature of the licences they use later that we have to apply it to the strict letter. Flickr allows an user to change the licence of his medias, Commons is supposed to be a free repositary, if an author wants to change a licence under the allowed common scope, then he should be allowed to do so. We don't need to give Commons a poor reputation that would stop users from joining us. Esby (talk)\n\nPuisqu'on est entre francophones, parlons français :-). Une fois qu'on a mis un fichier sous une licence, on ne peut pas le mettre sous une licence plus restrictive, d'où le refus d'accéder à cette demande (plus exactement, on peut mettre une licence plus restrictive, mais si une personne a utilisé l'image auparavant en la redistribuant et en disant qu'elle est dans le domaine public, il serait dans son droit, et toute personne qui réutiliserait l'image à son tour...). Une double licence est possible, mais on ne peut pas enlever la licence d'origine dans ce cas. N'oublie pas que les photos de cette personne sont soumises à la loi française (puisqu'il est Français et résident en France, si j'ai bien compris) et à la loi américaine car les serveurs y sont. le Korrigan →bla\n\nSauf que le droit français dans ce cas la me semble primer sur le droit américain, donc droit de retrait applicable. Il y me semble qu'il y a déjà eut des précédents d'utilisateurs français pour faire valoir ce droit. Ensuite, il faudrait savoir ce qu'est une licence plus restrictive, ici on peut arguer que la GFDL est plus restrictive, mais il s'agit d'un usage de Commons, et non d'une obligation légale. Techniquement parlant, il pourrait très bien arguer d'un droit de retrait de la licence PD-self, qui n'est pas la cessation dans le domaine publique, et qui est donc révocable par lui même en donnant le droit d'utilisation d'une licence GFDL aux utilisateurs de la précédente licence PD-self en compensation comme le prévoit la Loi. Maintenant si il s'agit de changer les policies de Commons, il faudra alors songer à le faire sérieusement, car on risque de devoir le faire quant au changement possible de licences GFDL, GFDL 1.2 et GFDL 1.3. A partir du moment ou la nouvelle licence reste libre, cela devrait être autorisé. Esby (talk)\n\nJe ré-explique. Voici ce qui est en train de se passer :\n\nKoS place une photo ici en domaine public. N'importe qui peut la réutiliser, sans restrictions.\n\nUne personne réutilise la photo, puis une autre, etc., sans citer l'auteur, c'est légal.\n\nKoS change la licence en GFDL. A présent chaque personne qui réutilise la photo devra 1) citer l'auteur et 2) resitribuer l'image sous licence GFDL.\n\nOn s'aperçoit à un moment que cette photo a été utilisée par quelqu'un sans citer l'auteur ni garder la même licence. Qui a raison, qui a tort ? On peut toujours dire que l'image a commencé à être utilisée avant le changement de licence.\n\nDans le droit américain, et dans le droit français aussi (mais oui !), il ne fait aucun doute que toute plainte vis-à-vis du non-respect de la licence d'origine sera vite déboutée. D'autre part, il n'y aucune raison que le droit français prime sur l'américain (ou, à nouveau, ça dépendrait du lieu d'utilisation donc de republication de l'image). Je crois qu'un avis plus expert serait intéressant (sur Legifer sur WP:fr ?), et aussi (et surtout) expliquer tout ça à KoS. le Korrigan →bla\n\n\"On s'aperçoit à un moment que cette photo a été utilisée par quelqu'un sans citer l'auteur ni garder la même licence. Qui a raison, qui a tort ? On peut toujours dire que l'image a commencé à être utilisée avant le changement de licence.\"\n\nCe n'est pas le problème de Commons mais de KoS. Je subodore deux possibilités, soit qu'il veuille être cité en temps qu'auteur, soit qu'il veuille limiter l'exploitation commerciale. (Due à la contrainte de distribuer un exemplaire physique de la licence.) Dans le premier cas, il dispose toujours de son droit de paternité (irrévocable) et peut donc le faire appliquer. Dans le second cas, étant donné qu'il y a droit de retrait et application d'une nouvelle licence, il faudra se conformer à la nouvelle licence. En aucun cas ça ne concerne Commons. En attendant je ne pense pas que cette page soit le lieu approprié pour discuter de ce problème. Je vois que la solution de facilité, consistant à dire 'non pas possible' et 'à mordre' l'auteur est toujours la solution adoptée pour résoudre les problèmes, l'issue c'est qu'à long terme, cela nous pénalisera. FlickR propose de changer une licence d'image, est ce que cela leur pose de problème particulier? Non. C'est un problème entre l'auteur et l'utilisateur final, pas entre l'auteur et l'entité hébergeant une image.\n\nSi on doit continuer à discuter de ça, autant le faire sur le Bistrot de Commons. Esby (talk)\n\nEsby (talk)\n\nSi, justement, sur Flickr ça pose problème, et c'est un excellent exemple : si un utilisateur de Flickr met une image sous licence CC-BY-SA, que nous la réutilisons ici, puis qu'il la met en \"Tous droits réservés\" (ce que Flickr autorise), sur Commons nous gardons la première licence puisqu'elle est irrévocable. Eh oui ! Et oui, ça concerne Commons, puisque c'est ici qu'est affichée la licence et donc les conditions d'utilisation, c'est nous> qui disons à l'utilisateur final quelles sont les conditions qu'a voulu imposer l'auteur. C'est aussi à nous de respecter la loi. Quant à limiter l'utilisation commerciale puisque les images de Commons sont faites pour être réutilisées, même commercialement. Si KoS ne veut pas de réutilisation commerciale, il ne doit pas mettre ses images sur Commons. Mon but n'est pas de \"mordre l'utilisateur\" (et j'essaie de rester poli et d'expliquer correctement), mais il ne s'agit pas non plus de ne pas respecter la loi. Je mets un petit mot sur le bistro de Commons, histoire d'amener des gens plus éclairés que moi sur ce sujet :-) le Korrigan →bla\n\nFor now, Deny the request, discussing this is not the place of the bot request. Esby (talk)\n\nHi,\n\nWould it possible that a bot adds the template {{Departments of France|prefix=:Category:Monuments historiques in|suffix=}} in every subcategory page of Category:Monument Historique ? I began doing the work by hand but it would be better done by a bot.\n\nThx, Pymouss Tchatcher -\n\nDone Should be ok now? --Eusebius (talk)\n\nIt looks like a lot of images in Category:Lion dance are also placed in Category:Animal costumes. I've just put Category:Lion dance itself in Category:Animal costumes, so we don't need to have it on each individual photo. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nIt should be done now.

What's the name of the book you scanned it from? And \"HDR Photographs by Esby (talk)\" should only be in the source.--Diaa abdelmoneim (talk)\n\nThere is no name to the book. Maybe at this period the author had given a name to the albums he commercialized but I ain't sure of that. The category just allow to identify the pictures from the same source (in other word, the current album I photographied), that's all, I am assuming there were other books created in the same way, but with different content, I don't have them anyway. Check the first page Image:Japon-1886-00.jpg, if you see a name, tell me it :D.

Esby (talk)\n\nDone All images were moved to Category:Adolfo Farsari album 01 with the appropriate descriptions and permissions. Specific categories need to be assigned.--Diaa abdelmoneim (talk)\n\nHi, i ask you to run a bot on substing the user notifications\n\nTemplate:Image permission,\n\nTemplate:Image source and\n\nTemplate:Idw.\n\nThe notifications are included on user talks per Quick delete gadget. The template Idw was fixed some weeks ago, the substing will now cause a correct heading on user talkpages. Most inclusions came from the use of the Quick delete gadget, the quick delete gadget was changed to subst: by User:Lupo after the fix of Idw. Template:Image source (for \"no source\" and \"no license\" notification) and Template:Image permission (for \"no permission\" notification) are corrected now, i asked Lupo to change this in the gadget. The substing should be done twice: Now and again in 2 months. Thanks for your answers and questions. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nMay I ask you : why subst these templates ? It was my understanding that, with the recent \"autotranslate\" in templates, it was better not to subst so that users can read a message in their own language. If you subst, you lose all benefits of the autotranslation, which is sooooo useful for user messages ! le Korrigan →bla\n\n+1 --Foroa (talk)\n\nThe actual situation was that we have the following line on usertalks:\n\n{{image source|File:xyz.jpg}}~~~~\n\nThe substitution will put a headline on usertalks so that we have a correct, editable section. Usertalks are structured again and less confusing. The new situation will be:\n\n== {{Autotranslate|1=File:xyz.jpg|base=Image source/heading}} == {{Autotranslate|1=File:xyz.jpg|base=Image source}}~~~~\n\nThe direct inclusion of Template:Autotranslate does no harm, the autotranslation works correctly. Also the headline is autotranslated and it is possible to change new headline inclusions at some point in future without destroying the old inclusions to ==[[:File:xyz.jpg]]== if anybody don't like a template in the headline. You can review this usertalk where I used subst: on the templates. Please do not complain about the ugly layout of the templates, the red frame is to prevent old (subst:) inclusions without headlines to become totally cluttered.

I use pywikipedia and AWB. --Diaa abdelmoneim (talk)\n\nI think I replaced all of them. They can be found at Category:PD New York World-Telegram & Sun.--Diaa abdelmoneim (talk)\n\nThank you so much! - BanyanTree\n\ni uploaded c. 3,000 pictures by James Lindsey; these all have the same Source link. later i realized it was actually pretty easy to find the precise page link for each picture, and i added them to this list (format is <picture name> <source link>). i think it's rather trivial to add those links, but don't have a bot. there is also an old batch of again c. 3,000 pictures in the same category, but these are not as trivial, as the filenames on commons are different than the one's on Lindsey's page, and the format is not 100% homogeneous. cheers! --Sarefo (talk)\n\na minor thing: when removing geo-coords, a single space was left out in all pictures of the category (also the old ones), after \"Ardennes\" (eg. here). maybe these can be removed in the same run. Also, James Lindsey requested to add a line that he be informed if there's any change in taxon identification; this was removed from the Description, but should be re-added somewhere. --Sarefo (talk)\n\nCould someone add dates to the images found in Category:Pictures by James Lindsey using the Exif data? Each image says \"see EXIF data below\" this should be replaced with the actual date. I'd like to learn how to do that. I know a little python, and use pywikipedia and awb.--Diaa abdelmoneim (talk)\n\nI'll take care of it (using pywikipedia through API). Also, as far as I remember I still have valid open bot license. :) --OsamaK\n\nDone.--OsamaK\n\nPurpose: Improve and stimulate addition of authorship/sources.\n\nBot function : Add {{Information}} automatically to to images that don't already have it. This could be done by running it against every image in Commons. (Commons helper transfer should have this information already)\n\nSfan00 IMG (talk)\n\nAll new uploads get {{Information}} unless a user chooses to do it otherwise. I think this is a bit too much. Multichill (talk)\n\nI would like to ask to recategorise these User:Juan de Vojníkov/gallery#Sun Jul 19 12:44:29 CEST 2009 and these Category:Kostel svatého Petra a Pavla (Karlovy Vary) to the this category Category:Church of Saint Peter and Paul (Karlovy Vary). Is it possible?--Juan de Vojníkov (talk)\n\nFor the second part you can just use {{Move}} and wait a couple of days. Multichill (talk)\n\nI recently discovered the useful template {{Langlist}}. Since many /lang pages (including those created by myself) still contain the old format, I just wanted to ask if it's possible to convert this with a bot? --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nBe careful :) --Martin H. (talk)\n\nHmm, I'm not sure about this. As someone that routinely adds language links to /lang pages, I have no issue doing it manually (and if others do, they can leave me a message when it needs to be done and I'll happily take care of it). It really doesn't take that much effort. The whole reason why we do it the way we do is to avoid unnecessary template calls. Otherwise, why stop there? Let's just use {{Lang links}} everywhere (which takes no maintenance). The reason for not being lazy here is the pages load faster and servers get a break. Rocket000 (talk)\n\n{{Lang links}} contains a lot of heavy parser functions (#ifexist) and will probably make some pages go over the parser limit. I usually use {{subst:Lang links subst}} and also have a bot for adding this template. Multichill (talk)\n\nI know, the point I was making was that we do it manually for technical reasons. {{Langlist}} doesn't use expensive functions (well, 1), but it's not that lightweight either (more bytes to download in any case). {{Lang links}} provides a function not possible with the other methods: auto-updating (new translations instantly appear, no /lang page to edit, no editprotected requests, no lost translations, etc.). The other methods are simply shortcuts to what can be done manually. If there was some outstanding benefit I would gladly support it. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nhello,\n\nIn the Ethnic groups in the United States category, we can find Irish-Americans and Irish Americans, Italian-Americans and Italian Americans, Norwegian-Americans and Norwegian Americans, Scottish Americans and Scottish diaspora (?)... and some categories with tiret and others without tiret. That would be a good thing to homogenize all this. Thank you. Okki (talk)\n\nDone I gave the task to SieBot.[7] He had some issues, but it's ok now. I only did the hyphen/non-hyphen and singular/plural ones. Anything thing else that needs to be done can be add to User talk:CommonsDelinker/commands. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nThank you very much. Okki (talk)\n\nHey, I was just wondering if someone of you might be able to categorize a few templates. As you can see in Special:UncategorizedTemplates several Potd templates aren't yet categorized. BotMultichill once made a run on them, but didn't seem to get any of those. I'd appreciate if someone is insert {{Potd filename}} or {{Potd description}} in them. Thank you. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nI probably got all of them at some point in time, but new templates were created. I'll publish to code of the bot to run if I can find it, so someone else can help out too. Multichill (talk)\n\nI accidentally uploaded 287 files in [[Category:Sulaymaniyah Province]] with the wrong license template. Can someone run a bot to change it all from: {{PD}} to {{PD-self}}. Thank you. ~ Zirguezi\n\nDone, applied many file page fixes including addition of date, Licensing and Summary section, empty permission parameter and add the author instead of own work.--Diaa abdelmoneim (talk)\n\nThere are a large number of images that currently do not have the {{Personality rights}} tag, but which, by policy, should (... identifiable image of a currently living person). Adding the tag requires some judgment, but it would be a great project for some experienced bot operator to try to put together something that could either do it, or develop a list for further review and refine heuristics for doing it... any takers? 68.188.146.168\n\nWell probably anything that is under the Category:Living people...? --Admrboltz (talk)\n\nI don't think so. For example, not all images of a building designed by a living architect (or the contents of a museum designed by a living architect, or all images in a park designed by a living architect) would have personality rights, but they'd probably fall somewhere under the category for that person. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nPlease change all instances of {{ThisDateInRecentYears}} to {{ThisMonthInRecentYears}}. Thank you. Evrik (talk)\n\nDone--Diaa abdelmoneim (talk)\n\nCould a bot be of some help in creating a category corresponding to Rote Flora, and removing the then-redundant supercategories from the images? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nDone manually.--Diaa abdelmoneim (talk)\n\nDoesn't appear to be done at all. Most of the images on the page Rote Flora aren't in Category:Rote Flora. Or are you saying I should follow through & move them myself (which I'm perfectly willing to do if this is not an appropriate bot task). - Jmabel ! talk\n\nThe images of the building are in Category:Rote Flora and of the Demonstration are in the subcategory thereof in Category:Hamburg, Rote-Flora-Demonstration, 9. Mai 2007. Did I miss anything?--Diaa abdelmoneim (talk)\n\nCould a bot add {{Personality rights}} to all images in Category:Chumleigh or Category:Chumleighland? A few may have it, but most don't. Thanks. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nDone--Diaa abdelmoneim (talk)\n\nCould a bot please move everything in Category:Demolished or former hotels of Seattle except what is under Category:Demolished hotels of Seattle into Category:Former hotels in Seattle instead? Thanks. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nDone There are now two distinct categories Category:Demolished hotels of Seattle and Category:Former hotels in Seattle. I think Category:Demolished or former hotels of Seattle should be deleted...--Diaa abdelmoneim (talk)\n\nWould it be possible for a bot to generate a list in my userspace of images in Category:Photos by Chris McKenna and Category:Diagrams by Chris McKenna that do not use the {{Information}} template. Thanks, Thryduulf (talk)\n\nRunning this ( http://toolserver.org/~magnus/catscan_rewrite.php?language=commons&project=wikimedia&depth=5&categories=Photos+by+Chris+McKenna%0D%0ADiagrams+by+Chris+McKenna&comb[union]=1&ns[6]=1&templates_no=information&ext_image_data=1&doit=1 ) should do the trick (you have to copy paste). If this does not work for you feel free to ask again. Maybe a bot could assist you in adding {{Information}} on your images. --MGA73 (talk)\n\nThank you, that query seems to have worked. I'll have a look through them and see if adding any of the {{Information}} templates can be automated. Thryduulf (talk)\n\nCould a bot add \"Category:2007 Scottish election\" to the 22 files presently in \"Category:Election posters in United Kingdom\" ? Thanks. --Estillbham (talk)\n\nI have taken care of this. --Estillbham (talk)\n\nOk, this is going to be a long one I think. There are probably hundreds - thousands of images that are either direct copies or derivative works of maps from the Perry-Castañeda Library, which has a source template {{PCL}}. What I would like is either:\n\na list of all files that have the string \"utexas.edu/maps/*\", and not the {{PCL}} template in them to be listed somewhere so I can do this manually (not a very appealing thought, but I could do it.\n\nor after the list was complied, if the bot could automatically add the {{PCL}} template, filled in properly.\n\nThanks --Admrboltz (talk)\n\nI just did a search [8]. In the top it says \"Results 1 - 50 of 1,413 for \"utexas.edu/maps/\"\" but it only shows less than 100. Sure this request is what you wanted? --MGA73 (talk)\n\nHello, can a bot move the template {{Published}} from the file talk pages to the file description page. It's just useless to keep them on the talk pages, because then the category isn't a gallery and the template isn't shown on other wikis. While it's useful to add them on the talk page over at en.wikipedia, the Commons file description page isn't about the subject of the image, but about the image. Also, other assessment templates like {{Assessments}}, {{Quality image}} or {{Valued image}} are also on the file description page. I would be happy if a bot could assist with this job. Thank you. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nYou might want to bring this up on VP first. Not sure if it's really a good idea to fill file description pages with such things. -- User:Docu at\n\nMore than 200 files in Category:Media needing categories as of 12 October 2009 have a filename beginning \"File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary\". Could a bot strip out the {{Uncategorized|year=2009|month=October|day=12}} and insert [[Category:Images from Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]? Estillbham (talk)\n\nMost images should have at least one additional category. What do you think if I would just add Category:Images from Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary? -- User:Docu at\n\nThe images are already in Category:PD Brockhaus&Efron. Adding them to Category:Images from Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary wouldn't improve this much. I'd rather leave them in uncategorized for now. From there, e.g. File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary b32 840-0.jpg could go into Category:Spiders etc. -- User:Docu at\n\nMy username has been changed. My request is to replace my fomer username (Té y kriptonita) for my new name (Tyk) in the author field of every file I have uploaded. This reason is to protect my privacy and keep my anonimity. Thank you --Tyk (talk)\n\nThere are 57 subcats in Category:Churches in Cornwall, and 53 of them are \"Churches in {PLACENAME}.\" Could a bot please move the categories and files under/within the 53 categories to Category:Anglican churches in Cornwall, and then delete the 53 then-empty categories? Thanks. Estillbham (talk)\n\nI have decided that I can work with these categories, so I am withdrawing this request. Estillbham (talk)\n\nThere are eight files named File:Brisland church st probus and st hyacinth 001.jpg 001 through 008. The \"probus\" should be \"protus\". It is correct in the description and the category (I moved them all). Could someone with adminstrator powers make the change? Estillbham (talk)\n\nIf you add {{Rename}} to each, eventually they will be moved. -- User:Docu at\n\nI'd say \"maybe\" rather than eventually personally. Noodle snacks (talk)\n\nThe filename starts with B so it's likely that it eventually happens. If it started with Z, probably never ;) -- User:Docu at\n\nThanks for the advice. I will do that as soon as possible. Estillbham (talk)\n\nPlease make the following replacements of images occurrences in all WPs. Reason: the maps to be replaced show wrong or outdated wilayas (provinces) boundaries, the new ones have been checked with maps of an Algerian's official site.

Multichill (talk)\n\nI know the new filenames aren't the best, at least the numbers are ok as they are the official ones, but I didn't wanted to upload a third serial for these “simple” locator maps, so I just updated the existing ones. I don't know if the boundaries displayed by the PNGs version maps were once correct: some of them come from the old VMap-0 data, other are different and I don't know if changes have been made between 1983 when there were only 31 provinces and now.\n\nIf you think it's better to modify the names of the updated maps, I would propose a scheme like “Algeria_xx_wilaya_locator_map.svg”, \"xx\" being the number of the wilaya. All occurrences of the former names should then be replaced in the projects. Sting (talk)\n\nIt looks like you replaced a series of maps in the svg files, e.g. File:DZ-13.svg. One shouldn't overwrite existing images with newer boundary details. To avoid problems in the future, I suggest you include a date or a year when the boundaries are considered correct, e.g. \"2009\". -- User:Docu at\n\nHumm... So, what do we do? Undo all my uploads which updated the maps and I make brand new uploads under a different and descriptive name of the up-to-date maps ? Sting (talk)\n\nI would generally suggest to do that, but here I'm not quite sure about the quality of the previous maps. If it's being done, at least, it wont be too complicated to replace one svg with another svg. -- User:Docu at\n\nOK, so standby with this request for now, the time for me to upload the new maps under a correct name. Sting (talk)\n\nOk, I uploaded my maps, reverted what I've done with the \"DZ-xx.svg\" serial and updated the list above which is now ready for the bot. So there are now the occurrences of two serials of maps to replace by the new of the \"Algeria_xx_Wilaya_locator_map-2009.svg\" type. Thanks. Sting (talk)\n\nThe svg/svg replacement can be requested at User talk:CommonsDelinker/commands. Maybe Multichill can help you with the png/svg ones. -- User:Docu at\n\nIs it possible to move from the Category:Maps of South Tyrol ONLY the yellow maps (files \"Cartina Comune BZ ...\") in the new Category:Maps of municipalities of the province of Bolzano? Thank you very much!\n\nNota bene: there is no problem for the province name. The yellow maps are the same like the brown maps that you find in the Category:Maps of municipalities of the province of South Tyrol which are the municipalities in their german names; the yellow maps are the same municipalities but in theyr italian names. Province of South Tyrol = Province of Bolzano. So it's good for the german names \"Province of South Tyrol\"; for the italian names \"Province of Bolzano\". --DenghiùComm (talk)\n\nI am afraid that bots are color blind.

(My question on german wiki) --Atamari (talk)\n\nIt could be done based on [9] (it can output a tsv list of the approx. 10'000 uploads). It would miss a few uploads where others have edited your images and you would have to remove the category from any images where you revert or edited others images. Besides, one would have to decide if images such as File:Wooden_Squirrel_Statue.jpg should be included. -- User:Docu at\n\nIn later times I want to specify whether their own photos, or just uploaded photos from other sources (example). In this procedure, I want to improve step by step descriptions and categories. --Atamari (talk)\n\nIf you will remove if from any files that you didn't upload, I can add it for you.\n\nSample: File:Perito Moreno Glacier Patagonia Argentina Luca Galuzzi 2005.JPG appears in mine (at ~daniel/WikiSense/Gallery.php) as I reverted someone else, but it wouldn't need the category.

We did that at nlwp and dawp, haven't tested it on enwp yet, but should work. Just a bit tired of the overly bureaucratic bot approval procedures over there. Multichill (talk)\n\nI haven't reviewed the code in detail, but which categories other than the ones with an identical title would it find? -- User:Docu at\n\nCommons categories linked from other language categories. Multichill (talk)\n\nFor most languages this is crucial, but for English is this needed or even a risk to avoid? -- User:Docu at\n\nIt's also needed at enwp because the naming convention is different than Commons. Multichill (talk)\n\nIt might find a few additional ones and can validate additions. Still, I don't think running it through en:Special:Allpages is possible. One would have to make a list first and then use this to run commonscat.py with \"-file:list.txt\". -- User:Docu at\n\nPlease replace category for Category:Alcazaba, Málaga as in the en.wiki article. As it is now is not entirely correct. Thank you --tyk (talk)\n\nPlease use {{Move}} like everybody else. Multichill (talk)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: -- User:Docu at\n\nI would like to empty the category Pustni običaji which is too unspecific for its content and has a generic slovenian name. Please recategorize all content (just over 100 images) into Category:Borovo gostüvanje. Some of the images are already in the proper cat. as well, in this case just remove Category:Pustni običaji. I would also like Category:Prekmurje removed from the images in the category Pustni običaji, because it's redundant. Thanks, — Yerpo Eh?\n\nAs none of the categories has interwiki links to en.wp, would write a short category descriptions in English at Category:Borovo gostüvanje and Category:Pustni običaji. Something like \"xxx (literally 'xxx') is a carinval custom in Slovenia celebrated around yyy\" would do. Then, I will see what I can do.\n\nBTW to move all images of a category, you could also ask at User talk:CommonsDelinker/commands. -- User:Docu at\n\nI will provide intro for Category:Borovo gostüvanje. CommonsDelinker doesn't seem appropriate for this case, because the target directory already exists and I think most of the files are already there. I wrote the request before realizing that it's mostly the matter of removing redundant categorization. — Yerpo Eh?\n\nLooks clear now. It's being done. Please double check that all entries in Category:Borovo gostüvanje are really about that specific custom.\n\nBTW at least the first part probably would have worked with SieBot as well. -- User:Docu at\n\nThank you for the quick response. — Yerpo Eh?\n\nAnother thing, could you please remove Category:Prekmurje listing from the files that are now in Category:Borovo gostüvanje as I also asked? It is redundant, because Category:Borovo gostüvanje is itself in Category:Prekmurje. Thanks again. — Yerpo Eh?\n\nNevermind, I was looking at a whole different problem, I'll have to fix it by hand. — Yerpo Eh?\n\nI think I did that, but there might be more images in the category now. [13] doesn't show any. -- User:Docu at\n\nYou did, I'm sorry. I was referring to images of the event that weren't in either Category:Borovo gostüvanje or Category:Pustni običaji, just in Category:Prekmurje. This has to be done manually, of course. — Yerpo Eh?\n\nYou might want to try cat-a-lot for this. It's listed at Commons:Categories#Tools. -- User:Docu at\n\nI prefer HotCat, I have problems using Cat-a-lot (losing session data when opening a lot of images). — Yerpo Eh?\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: User:Docu at\n\nPlease, loop over all images in User:Justass/livepict.com and replace {{Cc-by-sa-3.0}} license tag with {{LivePict}}.

One example is File:Delta II 7925 10C fairling is ready for installation oround THEMIS.jpg, there are many many others. Would it be possible for a bot to find and correct these errors?

For a first step, ~ 100 categories are to create. A second step may be changing ~ 200 categories. This is a boring job which can be done manually, but much better (and errorfree) automatically.

More precisely, I have been uploading some 300 audio files such as File:De-beliefern.ogg. They have been uploaded with commonist, into Category:German pronunciation. However I have been told that they should be sorted in the category like [[:Category:German pronunciation|beliefern]] etc. There is a project on German Wiktionary aiming to provide spoken examples to each article there, so having a bot for this (simple?) task would be a stepstone into accomplishing this project. Many thanks!! Jakob.scholbach (talk)\n\nAlso, of course, it would probably a good idea to clean up other pronunciation categories in this way. Jakob.scholbach (talk)\n\nDone by user. --Schlurcher (talk)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Schlurcher (talk)\n\n(User talk:Shortfatlad#Edit summaries and Taken with... categories)\n\nWould it be possible for a bot to go through my contributions (diffs) and re-add categories - the issue is I removed some \"Taken with camera name\" categories because I thought they were uneccessary. ie any categories in Category:Photographs by camera (alternatively key regex words are \"Canon\" \"Lumix\" \"Panasonic\" \"Konica\" \"Sony\" \"Minolta\")\n\nIf the bot could find the diffs, and produce a list I can do the rest. There should be only about 10 but I have ~1000 diffs to search.\n\n(At the same time can I request a bot that crawls the site and adds \"take with...\" categories using camera meta data)Shortfatlad (talk)\n\nI'd like to second the idea of a bot adding these categories from metadata. 12:00, 16 December 2009 (UTC)\n\nI need about 200 files to be moved, all in a similar manner. The files are currently named File:Ontario X.svg, and I need them renamed to File:Ontario X jct.svg, where X is any number between 1 and 499 (Most are from 2-169, with about 15 in the 400s). The reason for the moving is that the current files are graphics of highway signs that have fallen out of use. The new ones should be under those names because the file name is used on many many many articles, while the old ones should be still kept, as they still provide a basis for commentary on the old signs. - Floydian (talk)\n\nI assume the files you refer to are the ones in Category:Road_signs_in_Ontario. There doesn't seem to be any problem with the current files except that they seem to be superseded in one way or the other.\n\nThe objective you are trying to achieve doesn't seem to be covered by Commons:File renaming.\n\nCommons attempts to provide stable links to files and users shouldn't find another file than the one they had linked. Users of Commons aren't limited to English language Wikipedia.\n\nYou'd need to define a naming convention for the new files that is different from the old one. You could then do a work request at en:Wikipedia:Bot_requests to replace the files in Wikipedia articles. -- User:Docu at\n\nNo, because anywhere that the current images are used should show the new image instead, as the old one isn't correct. These images are only used on the English Wikipedia, with very very little exceptions (and again, where they are used, the newer image should be used instead). The ONLY reason there is any need to keep the old ones is simply for historic purposes, and even then only one is honestly needed. If a bot can't simplify the process, I will do it the long way. - Floydian (talk)\n\nCommons:File renaming applies to the \"long way\" just as it applies to bot moves. What is the problem with the current images? The images hosted at Commons can be used outside Wikimedia and shouldn't change. -- User:Docu at\n\nNo, it applies to moving files, which I clearly cannot do, since it is \"only available to administrators\". I should always think twice before asking for help on wiki, because 9 time out of 10 you get a beaurocrat that is more interested in putting a stupid fuss up about red tape, instead of someone interested in doing something. I need to perform a task, with a useful function. I don't care if it's not covered under the narrow requirements of commons:File renaming which is written for a massively broad scope.\n\nRegardless, I'm about to upload 340 odd pictures, so I hope you are very committed to bending a rule so that it applies to something that it does not mention. Good day. - Floydian (talk)\n\nThe suggested alternate solution leads to the same result. If you can't explain why you insistent on overwriting the other images, it's better to leave them as is. -- User:Docu at\n\nBecause the templates which ARE used by several different wikiprojects and wikipedias make reference to these images currently, which are incorrect. Other than these templates, which display them incorrectly, the images aren't used anywhere. Under this context, I'd have simply overwritten all of them with the new images I have made. However, since these images could potentially be used by people (after all, they aren't just for wikimedia), I'm keeping \"archival\" copies under a different name. As it stands, all places that use the images should instead use the corrected image, as the images were uploaded by someone who isn't informed on the subject (An editor of roads in the United States). Uploading the correct images under a new name only causes more inconvenience, whereas uploading over these images would result in changing several dozen templates (most of which I cannot as they are displayed on thousands of articles, and thus locked). - Floydian (talk)\n\nWouldn't the easier thing have been to update the templates to change which file name they called? Also, are you sure that the previous version is no longer in use? I think we found examples of where they are still in use yet. Imzadi1979 (talk)\n\nI doubt it, there are so many templates and subtemplates to go through. Whats so difficult about this method, besides that someone gets the actual sign instead of the junction sign. Yes, they exist on gantries, but as far as I've seen around the Toronto area, they have been replacing the junction ones with the reassurance markers, even at junctions. Freeway gantries are a different story, as they are only a white shape with a number. - Floydian (talk)\n\nWhat about a bot that archives talk page section tagged as done/resolved? On de-WP, there is SpBot doing this job. The sections are tagged by {{Erledigt|~~~~}}. The delay between the addition of the tag and the archiving can be chosen. It would be an option to MiszaBot that archived sections after a certain time, whether resolved (e.g. for a long time already) or not (at all). --Leyo\n\nGood plan. We would have certain states:\n\nNew requests, could be set to timeout after a really long time\n\nActive requests, people are working on it, probably should be left alone\n\nFinished requests, archived after a while\n\nDenied requests, archived after a while\n\nOr something in that direction ;-) Multichill (talk)\n\nYes, something like this.\n\nAddition: What I meant is that every user can tag a section as resolved. If any user disagrees, he/she can simply remove the template again. It could look e.g. like this\n\nThis section can be archived. --Dummy user 13:45, 9. Aug 2024 (CET)\n\nor this\n\nThis user thinks that the section can be archived. If you disagree feel free to remove the template. --Dummy user 13:45, 9. Aug 2024 (CET)\n\nHow it could look like can also be seen on the sister page: tagging as resolved, archiving (after delay set to x days in this case). --Leyo\n\nI like the idea, however, it's probably useful to use already existing templates like {{Resolved}} instead of creating yet more templates. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nIt just has to contain a user signature for the bot to know when the delay is over. --Leyo\n\nThere is a monobook script, that is used frequently on de.wikipedia for tagging a section just by one click. You could add it to MediaWiki:Monobook.js and activate it for all \"autoconfirmed\" users. But unfortantly it depends on Benutzer:PDD/helperFunctions.js and was tested with Firefox so far.\n\nOne of the next steps should be to find a proper translation for:\n\nde.WP commons (proposal Euku) commons (proposal Leyo) de:Template:Erledigt Template:Resolved Template:Section resolved de:Template:Autoarchiv-Erledigt Template:??

IMHO it is not working exactly the same way. --Leyo\n\nYes (e.g. at Commons:Undeletion requests/Archive/2010-01 - it took me time to find it). In any case, I think it would be a good thing to have that for other pages too. -- User:Docu at\n\nComment: I believe this should be implemented as soon as posible. Just today MiszaBot removed a section which wasn't yet finished. Being a specific amount of time old doesn't necessarily mean that a section is no longer needed. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nMaybe you could tell why the section is still needed - maybe the bot will let it stay then ;-) --MGA73 (talk)\n\nlol - At some point, I think stale requests should be archived, obviously, one could debate how long it should take. All are still available in the archives (for review and development of mediawiki extensions ;)\n\nBesides that, I think keeping some of the resolved ones, can help people formulate new ones. Obviously, it would be nice to set different delays for each type. -- User:Docu at\n\nThe templates have not been created yet, but you can see here [14], [15] (edit summary bug is already fixed), that it already works. Now I'm waiting for a bot flag. Can someone import the templates from de.WP please? --Euku:⇄\n\nLooks good IMHO.\n\nI imported Template:Section resolved and its documentation page and began to adapt it for Commons. --Leyo\n\nI added {{Autoarchive resolved section|archive=Commons:Bots/Work requests/Archive 3|age=2}} to this page, but the template does not exist. --Euku:⇄\n\nIt's a slow page. Besides, I think even resolved sections could stay for 2 weeks. -- User:Docu at\n\nFeel free to change it. --Leyo\n\nWill do, once testing is over. -- User:Docu at\n\nThe bot seems to work properly. The templates, especially Template:Section resolved could now be localized (other languages). Where is the best place to ask users to do so? --Leyo\n\nThe (random) username in the edit summaries should still be removed. You could try Commons talk:Template_i18n. -- User:Docu at\n\nIn Category:Festival BD Sollies Ville 2008: there are the following actions to be done:\n\nRemove the possible template {{Supported by Wikimedia France}}.\n\nRemove the Category:Supported by Wikimedia France if it is present.\n\nAdd {{Supported by Wikimedia France|catname =Festival de Sollies Ville - 2008 - Wikimedia France}} at the end of each article.\n\nEsby (talk)\n\nBad plan. Don't mix source (Wikimedia France) with topic (Festival BD Sollies Ville 2008) categories. Multichill (talk)\n\nThe idea is to sort up Category:Supported_by_Wikimedia_France. There are images associated with events in which the french chapter participated via its members (it's usually the photograph cover of these events.).Even if the categorization is not done by a template in some case, there is still the need to sort them out. So the categoy intersections are meant to exist. Sometimes there are categories created for the events, but they can be fed by users not related with the chapter, so distinct category are to be created. The chapter categories are all meant to be hidden: So tools will less likely break here. Anyway, what are the available alternatives here to do the job? Esby (talk)\n\nWhat's wrong with just adding categories normally? Or are you suggesting a bot can sort them? Your first request would have them them all placed in the same category anyway. The request isn't clear. (I don't really get the purpose of the template either. What does \"support\" mean? Why don't they support all of files? Why do we care?) Oh, it means sponsored, ok. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nInitially Category:Supported by Wikimedia France was created to:\n\nhave an idea of the 'total' numbers of files the french chapter got involved in helping to create, either by obtaining accredidation for a concert or an event, either by having a member to just cover the event. In this goal, the category was added by the template that was added to each file concerned...\n\nThis was also used to present the files concerned, the problem is this category is now filled with 4959 files, so it's not useful to browse them while they can be fully unrelated between them.\n\nSo the idea is to split the files between some category rattached to the mother category. Of course, this can be done by tagging all the files, but there is the template already present, so adding a parameter to it will do its job. Those category are meant to be hidden, so they won't break any tools more that the existing mother category.\n\nThe basic idea is that those categories could be presented when trying to obtain accreditation for an avent...\n\nEsby (talk)\n\nBut adding a parameter to a template (that's already there) instead of a category is usually more work. You don't have tools like HotCat or Cat-a-lot to help you. How would it be better with a parameter? Anyway, let's say there is a parameter, how would a bot help by adding the same thing to every one? They'll all end up in the same category, right? Rocket000 (talk)\n\nThere are two differents cases:\n\nCleaning of the actual mother category: This involves bots parsing a given event category: Here it's Category:Festival BD Sollies Ville 2008 but it could be Category:ENVT thesis digitized by Wikimedia France Category:Brest 2008 Category:Eurockéennes 2007, it should be performed how I explained. The template should be removed, the category (Supported by Wikimedia France) removed if present, and the template added again with the proper parameter. You'll notice that the parameter will be a concatenation of the event category and Wikimedia France.\n\nAdding new medias: when the uploader uploads its file, he just specify the name of the event + Wikimedia france as a parameter and he don't have to perform any wikimedia france categorization. if he forgot to add the template or the parameter, this can be handled via a bot or manually, depending the number of images. This can also be handled via event templates if they exist, so no bot is involved.\n\nEsby (talk)\n\nHi, I'm planning on removing the topic category Category:Hubble images from {{PD-Hubble}}, but before doing so, I'd like to have a bot adding the category on image pages tagged with {{PD-Hubble}} which do not yet contain Category:Hubble images explicitly. Is someone willing to do this? Thanks in advance. –Tryphon☂\n\nI'm on it! Should be done by tomorrow. − Inductiveload (talk)\n\nThanks! I've seen edits on several images already, just let me know when it's all done (it probably already is, but I can't be sure) and I'll proceed to remove the category from the template. –Tryphon☂\n\nIt should be done now. Inductiveload (talk)\n\nGreat, thanks. –Tryphon☂\n\nHi, can someone please add the transition to SVG template to any images which don't have it, or the vector version available template, for all PNG files in Category:Crystal_icons (and subcategories)? Bitplane (talk)\n\nDo you think that's necessary? The template's kinda useless now since it's so overused. It used to be for requesting SVGs to be made, now it's basically a standard feature on all non-photographic, non-animated raster images. It's not like the people who vectorize things don't already know it. Given the purpose and function of icons, the vector format provides relatively little benefit anyway. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nYou may think that the svg category is nothing more than an unreasonably large backlog of things to do, but there are scripts which prioritize the work based on the number of links to the media. It's important that the images are correctly tagged so they are not missed. Adding them may also draw hungry SVG tracers into the task of recreating these icons as vectors, which will be good for everyone in the long run. It's tempting to think that SVG doesn't currently offer much advantage over bitmap formats, but that's wrong. They are their source; they can be edited by anyone and therefore encourage collaboration and derived works. Also, a few years down the line when all browsers support SVG and computer monitors have again doubled in resolution, almost all non-photo bitmaps will be worthless in comparison. Bitplane (talk)\n\nDo you think that adding this will change anything to the waiting list of 20 to 30000 images ? Do you think that icons will get priority ? --Foroa (talk)\n\nNo, they'll be counted by bots then prioritized by usage. Bitplane (talk)\n\nDon't talk to me about the benefits of SVG. I love the format more than most people, but we're talking about priorities here. Icons are nice, but how much do they really enhance projects like Wikipedia. Prettify maintenance templates? I think educational diagrams, flags, COAs, etc. are a little more important. You made a good point about it being a tracking category though. I didn't know scripts used it. I assume they must scan recursively so adding a category itself should work. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nThe more icons that get done, the sooner we can push for the client-side SVG user preference! I've also started an SVG version of the \"vector\" skin as a scalable alternative to the new look. As soon as Firefox fix their img tag SVG problems, we'll be actually able to use scroll-zoom without any ugly scaling artefacts. I suppose it all depends on Microsoft's announcements for IE9, but I'm still hopeful. The bots don't currently do subcategories, though it would be nice if that was possible instead. Bitplane (talk)\n\nThey don't do subcategories? But the template categorizes into various subcategories already.\n\nBTW, you may be interested to know, right now I'm working on preparing the newest version (2.29) of the gnome-icon-theme SVGs (the same theme the vector skin uses) to be uploaded here. The gnome artists really do treat it like source code, so the files you get from svn aren't ready for use (e.g. they contain multiple \"resolution\" versions, grids, inkscape preferences, etc.). All we have here is the incomplete 2.20. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nCould a bot run and replace the templates {{Potd2}} and {{Motd2}} with {{Potd}} and {{Motd}}. Just note that the parameters \"language\" and \"fallback language\" need to be changed to \"lang\" and \"fallback lang\". They're mostly used on main pages, but simply redundant to the usual templates, which look much better and are always up to date. Thanks, --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nI'm doing this manually with AWB. My bot account doesn't have admin rights which is necessary here and, being main pages, it's good to check each edit.. I already ran into a couple problems with {{Motd2}} calling templates that didn't exist (like {{Motd2/name/no}}; I guess there's no ifexist check/fallback if you set the lang param.) Rocket000 (talk)\n\n{{Potd2}} conversion is done (the template is no longer used, marked as deprecated, and can be deleted). There's some problems with {{Motd2}}. Many non-existent templates are called when lang is set (most languages don't have the necessary translations). The alternative is to remove the lang param. completely so it defaults to English but I hate the idea of mixed-language main pages. Rocket000 (talk)\n\nThank you. for the conversion of {{Potd2}}. There have been some translatios used in {{Motd2}} (at {{MotdHelp (langcode)}}, {{MotdHelp-url (langcode)}} & {{MotdTitle (langcode)}}), which I moved to the new template, but it's still far from everything though. --The Evil IP address (talk)\n\nI added some ifexists to hide the red linked templates so we don't need to wait for translations. The missing text (title and help link) isn't all that necessary so it looks fine without them (better than injecting some English text into a main page that supposed to be a different language). I replaced the uses so it can be deleted too.
