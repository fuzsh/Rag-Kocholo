        "text": "Medicinal plants represent an important class of traditional medicines. This research was conducted to assess the levels of selected heavy metals in some medicinal plants from Obuasi, a mining area in Ghana. Twenty different medicinal crops were sampled for this study. The levels of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) after wet digestion. The concentrations (mg/kg) of As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Mn, Ni, and Pb were 1.092 − 0.206, 1.341 − 0.253, 6.603 − 2.005, 0.045 − 0.001, 282.798 − 20.583, 4.967 − 1.676, and 26.410 − 0.629, respectively. Some concentrations of Cr, Cd, As, Mn, and Pb analyzed in all 20 medicinal plant samples exceeded WHO permissible limits for medicinal food while concentrations of Ni, As, and Hg for all the samples were below the WHO permissible limit. The estimated dietary intake (EDI) was compared to the tolerable daily intake recommended by WHO/FAO. Results obtained from hazard indices such as the hazard quotient and carcinogenic risk show that the medicinal plants are not likely to cause cancer if they are consumed over a prolonged period of time.\n\nThe chamomile plant, Matricaria chamomilla L., is a well-known medicinal plant species that is widely utilized in folk and traditional medicine to provide sedative as well as spasmolytic effects. In the present study and for the first time in Algeria, we examined in particular the content of essential and toxic elements in the Algerian plant M. chamomilla L., by using two analytical techniques Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrom-etry (ICP-OES). The findings from the two analytical techniques showed that there were twenty-one elements, comprising macro and microelements, including Ba, Br, Th, U, and Zn. The accuracy of these methods was verified and confirmed by analyzing three certified reference materials. This study demonstrated the abundance of mineral elements in M. chamomilla L. Additionally, the concentration of the toxic elements determined were within the Food and Agriculture Organization's tolerance limits (FAO).\n\nLaurus nobilis belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its evergreen nature. It is well known because of its traditional use in cooking and folk medicine. Many studies have been performed regarding its chemical composition and the pharmacological potential it exhibits. It has been reported to have antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, biocidal, antidiabetic, antiulcerogenic, neuroprotective, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anticholinergic properties, making this plant of great clinical importance. The main chemical compounds that show bioactive properties in L. nobilis are terpenoids, phenolics, and fatty acids. The purpose of this review is to describe the main use of L. nobilis, notably of the leaves and fruits, and to relate their metabolite content with their pharmacological and toxicological properties.\n\nDue to their robust antioxidant capabilities, potential health benefits, wide variety of biological activities, and strong antioxidant qualities, phenolic compounds are substances that have drawn considerable attention in recent years. The main goal of the review is to draw attention to saharian Algerian medicinal plants and the determination of their bioactivity (antioxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory importance), and to present their chemical composition as well as in vivo and in vitro studies, clinical studies, and other studies confirming their real impact on human health. Research results have revealed a rich variety of medicinal plants used to treat various disease states in this region. Based on in vivo and in vitro studies, biological activity, and clinical studies, a list of 34 species of desert plants, belonging to 20 botanical families, useful both in preventive actions and in the treatment of neoplastic diseases has been established, and polyphenolic compounds have been identified as key to the health potential of endemic diseases and desert plants. It has been shown that people who follow a diet rich in polyphenols are less prone to the risk of many cancers and chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. In view of the increasing antioxidant potential of these plant species, as well as the increasing trade in herbal products from the Sahara region, phytosanitary and pharmaceutical regulations must change in this respect and should be in line with Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and the sustainable use and development of plant products must be addressed at the same time.\n\nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the concentrations of some essential and toxic elements (including Ca, K, Mg, Na, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, Co, Mo, Pb, Ni, Cr, and Cd) in Ziziphora clinopodioides Lam. (endemic Iranian herb) from 14 different regions by ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry) method followed by multivariate statistical analyses. The analytical performances were assessed as the limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, and accuracy. Multivariate analysis (CA, PCA and HCA) showed the elemental distribution in the roots were higher than the shoots and significant element was Ca between regions. Three principal components (PCs) explained 77.94% of the total variance. They were as follows: PC1 with Cu, Zn, K, Cr, Ni, and Mn; PC2 with Na, Ca, Pb, and Fe; and PC3 with Mg. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated four groups of Z. clinopodioides samples from the 14 regions based on their trace and toxic element levels. These chemometric approaches with multivariate analysis enable researchers to understand and quantify the relationship between the variables in a data set, and the analysis considers more than one factor. The concentrations of Cu, Na, Mn, Zn, and Pb in most Z. clinopodioides samples were below the WHO (world health organization) limit for herbal medicines (10, 51,340, 200, 50, and 10 µg g⁻¹ respectively), while Fe and Ca levels were higher than allowed (15 and 614 µg g⁻¹ respectively). However, the WHO limit for Mg, K, Co, and Mo in medicinal plants has not yet been determined. The results of this study confirmed that different parts of Z. clinopodioides can be used as an important source for human nutrition due to its essential mineral elements. Graphical abstract\n\nWe propose that several different reactor irradiation times followed by assaying of activity for differential counting periods may be employed for quality control (QC) of neutron activation analysis (NAA) data of biological samples. It is also recommended that three to four reference materials (RMs) of similar matrix but from different agencies such as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA, Vienna), Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology (INCT, Poland), and National Institute of Environmental Studies (NIES, Japan) including a synthetic multielemental primary standard should always be analyzed simultaneously along with the samples. Finally, the mean ± σ values so obtained may be considered as more reliable after statistical analysis. Our analytical data for Na and K in three RMs (SRM 1572, CRM H-9, and Bowen's Kale) using different irradiation periods of 15 m, 2 h, 6 h, and 1 day were comparable with the certified values within error range of + 0.2 to − 2.7%. We report our data for 20 elements in two candidate RMs corn flour (INCT-CF-3) and soya bean flour (INCT-SBF-4) from the INCT, Poland, where Z-score values for most elements are in reasonable range of certified values.\n\nLobularia libyca (L. libyca) is a traditional plant that is popular for its richness in phenolic compounds and flavonoids. The aim of this study was to comprehensively investigate the phyto-chemical profile by liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS), the mineral contents and the biological properties of L. libyca methanol extract. L. libyca contains significant amounts of phenolic compounds and flavonoids. Thirteen compounds classified as flavonoids were identified. L. libyca is rich in nutrients such as Na, Fe and Ca. Moreover, the methanol extract of L. libyca showed significant antioxidant activity without cytotoxic activity on HCT116 cells (human colon cancer cell line) and HepG2 cells (human hepatoma), showing an inhibition zone of 13 mm in diameter. In silico studies showed that decanoic acid ethyl ester exhibited the best fit in β-lactamase and DNA gyrase active sites; meanwhile, oleic acid showed the best fit in reductase binding sites. Thus, it can be concluded that L. libyca can serve as a beneficial nutraceutical agent, owing to its significant antioxidant and antibacterial potential and due to its richness in iron, calcium and potassium, which are essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n\nThis study hypothesized that seasons and geography may affect the elemental composition of Fagonia indica. The plant was sampled along with rhizospheric soil, from six hilly geographical sites of Sindh, during March (Spring) and July (Summer) and analyzed through ICP-OES. Among 20 elements detected, the elemental concentration of rhizospheric soil was significantly affected by geography rather than seasons. The rhizospheric soil elements, Fe, Mg, Hg, K, Mn, Na, Zn, Al, were hyper-concentrated, B, Ba, Cr, Cu, Pb, Sr were moderately concentrated, and As, Cd, Ni, Rb, Ti, V were concentrated in trace levels. Contrarily, elements in Fagonia indica biomass were significantly affected by both seasons and geography. K, Na, Fe, Hg, Al, Mn, Sr, Cr, Ti, V were hyperaccumulated during summer, while Mg, Zn, As, Ba, Cd, and Cu accumulated higher during spring. PCA reveals that elements with high variances were homogenously distributed to all sites except Rohri during spring, while during summer most elements were accumulated at Johi, Dadu, Jamshoro, and Karachi. In conclusion, the plant accumulates high concentration of heavy metals during summer and higher concentration of essential nutrients during spring; therefore, its collection for oral use can be recommended during spring.\n\nSpices in general owned a very important reputation in the herbal plantae Kingdom; they have been used for food flavoring, preservation, aroma, and coloring for more than 2000 years. Moreover, spices are classified as all natural, and for this reason, they attracted a large scale of consumers worldwide; however, since most of spices are consumed in their natural form (without grounded them), it is necessary to monitor their consumed quantities. Hence, the aim of this work was to quantify major and trace elements contained in some Algerian kitchen frequently used spices (Piper nigrum L., Nigella sativa L., and Pimpinella anisum L.). Spice materials were washed well then pass through an instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). Results revealed the existence of twenty-six elements among them: K, Ca, Fe, and Na which showed significant concentrations, consecutively, while Ce, Eu, Lu, Sm, and Tb were presented at low concentrations. Furthermore, these spices consumption assessment results were found to be well below the tolerance limits compared with the recommended values (RDA) suggested by the FAO association."
