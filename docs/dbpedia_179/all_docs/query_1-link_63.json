The trip provided the opportunity to establish relationships and nurture existing ones with our key stakeholders in the region. Through the trip, we have learned that: 1) In China consumers are fast adopters of avocado and it is in use in mainstream cuisine, particularly fresh salads and healthy smoothies, 2) importers are installing avocado ripening facilities to meet growing consumer demand for ripe and ready, and 3) importers are very eager to access Aussie avos due to our annual supply capabilities and our close proximity to their market. ü•ëü•ëü•ë Avocados Australia Limited China Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Association (CIQA) Department of the Premier and Cabinet (Queensland) #DepartmentofAgriculturalIndustryDevelopmentandFisheries Trade and Investment Queensland Australian Trade and Investment Commission (Austrade) Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry #AustralianChamberofCommerceChina Queensland Fruit & Vegetable Growers Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development Hort Innovation"
