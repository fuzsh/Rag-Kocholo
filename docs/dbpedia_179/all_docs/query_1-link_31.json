        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nStaphylococci species are usually considered part of the normal microbiota of humans and animals but they can also act as opportunistic pathogens involved in food-borne diseases and other clinical manifestations. Based on their ability to coagulate rabbit plasma, species of this genus are divided into 2 subgroups: coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). Animal-derived foods, such as dairy products, are often found to harbor CPS, mainly Staphylococcus aureus (\n\nMama et al., 2019b\n\nMama O.M.\n\nGomez-Sanz E.\n\nRuiz-Ripa L.\n\nGomez P.\n\nTorres C.\n\nDiversity of staphylococcal species in food producing animals in Spain, with detection of PVL-positive MRSA ST8 (USA300).\n\n;\n\nTitouche et al., 2019\n\nTitouche Y.\n\nHakem A.\n\nHouali K.\n\nMeheut T.\n\nVingadassalon N.\n\nRuiz-Ripa L.\n\nSalmi D.\n\nChergui A.\n\nChenouf N.\n\nHennekinne J.A.\n\nTorres C.\n\nAuvray F.\n\nEmergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST8 in raw milk and traditional dairy products in the Tizi Ouzou area of Algeria.\n\n). The presence of Staph. aureus in milk and milk products is a public health concern, because this pathogen can produce several virulence factors that play an important role in cellular invasion, bacterial growth, and reduction of immune system cells (\n\nJarraud et al., 2002\n\nJarraud S.\n\nMougel C.\n\nThioulouse J.\n\nLina G.\n\nMeugnier H.\n\nForey F.\n\nNesme X.\n\nEtienne J.\n\nVandenesch F.\n\nRelationships between Staphylococcus aureus genetic background, virulence factors, agr groups (alleles), and human disease.\n\n;\n\nLozano et al., 2011\n\nLozano C.\n\nGomez-Sanz E.\n\nBenito D.\n\nAspiroz C.\n\nZarazaga M.\n\nTorres C.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus nasal carriage, virulence traits, antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and genetic lineages in healthy humans in Spain, with detection of CC398 and CC97 strains.\n\n). These virulence factors are represented by cell surface components and exoproteins such as enterotoxins, exfoliatins, toxic shock syndrome toxin (encoded by the tst gene), and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL, encoded by the lukF/lukS-PV genes) (\n\nHolmes et al., 2005\n\nHolmes A.\n\nGanner M.\n\nMcGuane S.\n\nPitt T.L.\n\nCookson B.D.\n\nKearns A.M.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus isolates carrying Panton-Valentine leucocidin genes in England and Wales: frequency, characterization, and association with clinical disease.\n\n). Panton-Valentine leukocidin is a pore-forming toxin that destroys polymorphonuclear cells. It is composed of 2 separate protein units, LukS-PV and LukF-PV, which behave synergistically to produce the toxic effect (\n\nShrestha, 2013\n\nShrestha B.\n\nReview on Panton Valentine leukocidin toxin carriage among Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n). It is also associated with necrotizing pneumonia (\n\nHaider and Wright, 2013\n\nHaider S.\n\nWright D.\n\nPanton-Valentine leukocidin Staphylococcus causing fatal necrotising pneumonia in a young boy.\n\n). In addition, Staph. aureus can cause food poisoning due to consumption of food containing one or more preformed enterotoxins. Six staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEA, SEB, SEP, SEC, SED, and SEE) are known to be prevalent (\n\nArgudín et al., 2010\n\nArgudín M.A.\n\nMendoza M.C.\n\nRodicio M.R.\n\nFood poisoning and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins.\n\n;\n\nTitouche et al., 2020\n\nTitouche Y.\n\nHouali K.\n\nRuiz-Ripa L.\n\nVingadassalon N.\n\nNia Y.\n\nFatihi A.\n\nCauquil A.\n\nBouchez P.\n\nBouhier L.\n\nTorres C.\n\nHennekinne J.A.\n\nEnterotoxin genes and antimicrobial resistance in Staphylococcus aureus isolated from food products in Algeria.\n\n). Staphylococcal enterotoxins are heat stable and resistant to inactivation by gastrointestinal proteases (\n\nBalaban and Rasooly, 2000\n\nBalaban N.\n\nRasooly A.\n\nStaphylococcal enterotoxins.\n\n).\n\nThe CNS species have long been reported as contaminants. However, the role of this group of bacteria has been revised and they are currently recognized as important causative agents of bacteremia in animals and nosocomial catheter-related bloodstream infections in humans (\n\nSchulin and Voss, 2001\n\nSchulin T.\n\nVoss A.\n\nCoagulase-negative staphylococci as a cause of infections related to intravascular prosthetic devices: Limitations of present therapy.\n\n;\n\nPiessens et al., 2011\n\nPiessens V.\n\nVan Coillie E.\n\nVerbist B.\n\nSupre K.\n\nBraem G.\n\nVan Nuffel A.\n\nDe Vuyst L.\n\nHeyndrickx M.\n\nDe Vliegher S.\n\nDistribution of coagulase-negative staphylococcus species from milk and environment of dairy cows differs between herds.\n\n). In dairy cows, they constitute the most prevalent pathogens causing subclinical mastitis, a disease affecting milk production (\n\nPiessens et al., 2011\n\nPiessens V.\n\nVan Coillie E.\n\nVerbist B.\n\nSupre K.\n\nBraem G.\n\nVan Nuffel A.\n\nDe Vuyst L.\n\nHeyndrickx M.\n\nDe Vliegher S.\n\nDistribution of coagulase-negative staphylococcus species from milk and environment of dairy cows differs between herds.\n\n). Nonetheless, the risk associated with staphylococci is not limited to their pathogenic properties; it includes their capacity to acquire mobile genetic elements encoding antimicrobial resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer (\n\nGómez et al., 2017\n\nGómez P.\n\nCasado C.\n\nSaenz Y.\n\nRuiz-Ripa L.\n\nEstepa V.\n\nZarazaga M.\n\nTorres C.\n\nDiversity of species and antimicrobial resistance determinants of staphylococci in superficial waters in Spain.\n\n). It has been suggested that CNS isolated from cattle tend to be more resistant to antimicrobial agents than Staph. aureus, and they often develop multidrug resistance (\n\nKlibi et al., 2018a\n\nKlibi A.\n\nJouini A.\n\nGomez P.\n\nSlimene K.\n\nCeballos S.\n\nTorres C.\n\nMaaroufi A.\n\nMolecular characterization and clonal diversity of methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolates of milk of cows with clinical mastitis in Tunisia.\n\n). Methicillin resistance, which was initially described in Staph. aureus (MRSA) and later in CNS (MR-CNS), has become an emerging concern in both veterinary and human medicine and in clinical and nonclinical settings. It is conferred primarily by expression of the mecA gene, located within the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec;\n\nMartínez-Meléndez et al., 2015\n\nMartínez-Meléndez A.\n\nMorfín-Otero R.\n\nVillarreal-Treviño L.\n\nGonzález-González G.\n\nLlaca-Díaz J.\n\nRodríguez-Noriega E.\n\nCamacho-Ortíz A.\n\nGarza-González E.\n\nStaphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) in coagulase negative staphylococci.\n\n). Methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus are defined as Staph. aureus carrying the mecA gene (or unusually mecB or mecC) or phenotypically showing resistance to oxacillin or cefoxitin. However, oxacillin-susceptible mecA-positive Staph. aureus, also known as cefoxitin-susceptible MRSA (CS-MRSA), have been increasingly reported not only among clinical isolates but also in animals and food of animal origin (\n\nAndrade-Figueiredo and Leal-Balbino, 2016\n\nAndrade-Figueiredo M.\n\nLeal-Balbino T.C.\n\nClonal diversity and epidemiological characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus: high prevalence of oxacillin-susceptible mecA-positive Staphylococcus aureus (OS-MRSA) associated with clinical isolates in Brazil.\n\n).\n\nIn Algeria, 3.5 billion liters of raw milk are produced per year. However, only 18% of this milk is integrated in the industry sector; the rest is sold traditionally to consumers in stores with poor hygienic conditions, either directly (unpasteurized milk) or transformed (skim milk, traditional cheeses, and other products), according to traditional, manual processes (\n\nChenouf et al., 2016\n\nChenouf N.S.\n\nYabrir B.\n\nHakem A.\n\nMessai C.R.\n\nTobbiche F.\n\nTitouche Y.\n\nChenouf A.\n\nZitouni A.\n\nThe bacteriological quality of unpasteurized milk and traditional dairy products sold via informal circuit in Djelfa City (Algeria).\n\n;\n\nONIL, 2019\n\nONIL\n\nStatistics of the National Interprofessional Milk Office. Office National Interprofessionnel du Lait et des Produits Laitiers (ONIL), Algeria.\n\n). These products are highly appreciated by both rural and urban populations, despite the risk of carrying food-borne pathogens (\n\nChenouf et al., 2016\n\nChenouf N.S.\n\nYabrir B.\n\nHakem A.\n\nMessai C.R.\n\nTobbiche F.\n\nTitouche Y.\n\nChenouf A.\n\nZitouni A.\n\nThe bacteriological quality of unpasteurized milk and traditional dairy products sold via informal circuit in Djelfa City (Algeria).\n\n). In this context, few reports have dealt with the genetic characterization of Staph. aureus isolates in Algerian raw milk (\n\nChaalal et al., 2018\n\nChaalal W.\n\nChaalal N.\n\nBourafa N.\n\nKihal M.\n\nDiene S.M.\n\nRolain J.M.\n\nCharacterization of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from food products in Western Algeria.\n\n;\n\nMatallah et al., 2019\n\nMatallah A.M.\n\nBouayad L.\n\nBoudjellaba S.\n\nMebkhout F.\n\nHamdi T.M.\n\nRamdani-Bouguessa N.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus isolated from selected dairies of Algeria: Prevalence and susceptibility to antibiotics.\n\n;\n\nTitouche et al., 2019\n\nTitouche Y.\n\nHakem A.\n\nHouali K.\n\nMeheut T.\n\nVingadassalon N.\n\nRuiz-Ripa L.\n\nSalmi D.\n\nChergui A.\n\nChenouf N.\n\nHennekinne J.A.\n\nTorres C.\n\nAuvray F.\n\nEmergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST8 in raw milk and traditional dairy products in the Tizi Ouzou area of Algeria.\n\n), with no attention given to CNS strains. Accordingly, the present study was designed to estimate the prevalence and the diversity of staphylococci species (CPS and CNS) recovered from unpasteurized milk sold in retail stores of Djelfa city, Algeria, and to investigate their antibiotic resistance mechanisms and virulence traits.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn Algerian society, the consumption of unpasteurized milk and its derivatives constitutes an ancient habit associated with livestock farming. These traditions may constitute a potential health hazard. Generally, the prevalence of Staph. aureus strains from animal-derived food is well documented in Algeria; however, there is a lack of data on CNS. Overall, more than half of milk samples were contaminated by staphylococcal species, with a relatively high incidence of CNS compared with Staph. aureus (42.7% and 12.2% in analyzed samples, respectively), with Staph. sciuri being the most frequently isolated species. It is important to note that only one colony was selected per sample because morphologically only one type of colony was found in each mannitol salt agar plate inoculated; however, the possibility of missing cases of mixed contamination cannot be excluded. Moreover, both the presence of Staph. aureus and the diversity of CNS (and their antimicrobial resistance profiles) might have been underrepresented with the methods used here. Similar observations were reported in Belgium and Austria, where 90 and 94% of bulk milk samples, respectively, contained CNS (\n\nKümmel et al., 2016\n\nKümmel J.\n\nStessl B.\n\nGonano M.\n\nWalcher G.\n\nBereuter O.\n\nFricker M.\n\nGrunert T.\n\nWagner M.\n\nEhling-Schulz M.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus entrance into the dairy chain: Tracking S. aureus from dairy cow to cheese.\n\n;\n\nDe Visscher et al., 2017\n\nDe Visscher A.\n\nPiepers S.\n\nHaesebrouck F.\n\nSupre K.\n\nDe Vliegher S.\n\nCoagulase-negative Staphylococcus species in bulk milk: Prevalence, distribution, and associated subgroup- and species-specific risk factors.\n\n). Carriage rates of Staph. aureus isolates in Algerian raw milk ranged from 19.9 to 34.8% (\n\nChaalal et al., 2018\n\nChaalal W.\n\nChaalal N.\n\nBourafa N.\n\nKihal M.\n\nDiene S.M.\n\nRolain J.M.\n\nCharacterization of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from food products in Western Algeria.\n\n;\n\nMatallah et al., 2019\n\nMatallah A.M.\n\nBouayad L.\n\nBoudjellaba S.\n\nMebkhout F.\n\nHamdi T.M.\n\nRamdani-Bouguessa N.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus isolated from selected dairies of Algeria: Prevalence and susceptibility to antibiotics.\n\n;\n\nTitouche et al., 2019\n\nTitouche Y.\n\nHakem A.\n\nHouali K.\n\nMeheut T.\n\nVingadassalon N.\n\nRuiz-Ripa L.\n\nSalmi D.\n\nChergui A.\n\nChenouf N.\n\nHennekinne J.A.\n\nTorres C.\n\nAuvray F.\n\nEmergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST8 in raw milk and traditional dairy products in the Tizi Ouzou area of Algeria.\n\n), whereas much higher frequencies of 49.4 and 50% were reported in neighboring North African countries (\n\nBendahou et al., 2009\n\nBendahou A.\n\nAbid M.\n\nBouteldoun N.\n\nCatelejine D.\n\nLebbadi M.\n\nEnterotoxigenic coagulase positive Staphylococcus in milk and milk products, lben and jben, in northern Morocco.\n\n;\n\nBen Said et al., 2016\n\nBen Said M.\n\nAbbassi M.S.\n\nBianchini V.\n\nSghaier S.\n\nCremonesi P.\n\nRomano A.\n\nGualdi V.\n\nHassen A.\n\nLuini M.V.\n\nGenetic characterization and antimicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bovine milk in Tunisia.\n\n).\n\nContamination of raw milk with staphylococcal species may have numerous origins, but is mostly related to poor hygiene practices, from upstream (management of the herd) to downstream (storage of the final product), through milking, handling, and transportation processes (\n\nChenouf et al., 2016\n\nChenouf N.S.\n\nYabrir B.\n\nHakem A.\n\nMessai C.R.\n\nTobbiche F.\n\nTitouche Y.\n\nChenouf A.\n\nZitouni A.\n\nThe bacteriological quality of unpasteurized milk and traditional dairy products sold via informal circuit in Djelfa City (Algeria).\n\n). Nasal carriage by cows and nasal or hand carriage by farm workers are also important sources of Staph. aureus and CNS (\n\nAkkou et al., 2018\n\nAkkou M.\n\nBouchiat C.\n\nAntri K.\n\nBes M.\n\nTristan A.\n\nDauwalder O.\n\nMartins-Simoes P.\n\nRasigade J.P.\n\nEtienne J.\n\nVandenesch F.\n\nRamdani-Bouguessa N.\n\nLaurent F.\n\nNew host shift from human to cows within Staphylococcus aureus involved in bovine mastitis and nasal carriage of animal's caretakers.\n\n;\n\nRoberts et al., 2018\n\nRoberts M.C.\n\nGarland-Lewis G.\n\nTrufan S.\n\nMeschke S.J.\n\nFowler H.\n\nShean R.C.\n\nGreninger A.L.\n\nRabinowitz P.M.\n\nDistribution of Staphylococcus species in dairy cows, workers and shared farm environments.\n\n). Moreover, the presence of staphylococci species in milk can originate from the udder itself, in the case of intramammary infection, or from the teat canal and udder skin of healthy cows. Emergence of CNS as a major cause of mastitis in dairy cows has been reported not only in Algeria (\n\nSaidi et al., 2019\n\nSaidi R.\n\nMimoune N.\n\nBaazizi R.\n\nBenaissa M.H.\n\nKhelef D.\n\nKaidi R.\n\nAntibiotic susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from bovine mastitis in Algeria.\n\n;\n\nZaatout et al., 2019\n\nZaatout N.\n\nAyachi A.\n\nKecha M.\n\nKadlec K.\n\nIdentification of staphylococci causing mastitis in dairy cattle from Algeria and characterization of Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n), but also in other countries (\n\nKlibi et al., 2018b\n\nKlibi A.\n\nMaaroufi A.\n\nTorres C.\n\nJouini A.\n\nDetection and characterization of methicillin-resistant and susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci in milk from cows with clinical mastitis in Tunisia.\n\n).\n\nGenetic diversity was observed among the Staph. aureus isolates. Most of our Staph. aureus isolates belonged to spa type t267, which was previously reported in Algeria in raw milk from healthy cows (\n\nTitouche et al., 2019\n\nTitouche Y.\n\nHakem A.\n\nHouali K.\n\nMeheut T.\n\nVingadassalon N.\n\nRuiz-Ripa L.\n\nSalmi D.\n\nChergui A.\n\nChenouf N.\n\nHennekinne J.A.\n\nTorres C.\n\nAuvray F.\n\nEmergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST8 in raw milk and traditional dairy products in the Tizi Ouzou area of Algeria.\n\n), milk from cows with mastitis (\n\nZaatout et al., 2019\n\nZaatout N.\n\nAyachi A.\n\nKecha M.\n\nKadlec K.\n\nIdentification of staphylococci causing mastitis in dairy cattle from Algeria and characterization of Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n), and in nasal swabs of farmers (\n\nAkkou et al., 2018\n\nAkkou M.\n\nBouchiat C.\n\nAntri K.\n\nBes M.\n\nTristan A.\n\nDauwalder O.\n\nMartins-Simoes P.\n\nRasigade J.P.\n\nEtienne J.\n\nVandenesch F.\n\nRamdani-Bouguessa N.\n\nLaurent F.\n\nNew host shift from human to cows within Staphylococcus aureus involved in bovine mastitis and nasal carriage of animal's caretakers.\n\n). Our findings suggest that this spa type might be circulating within Algerian dairy environments. Similarly, t267 was predominant in Staph. aureus from cattle herds in Tunisia (\n\nKlibi et al., 2018a\n\nKlibi A.\n\nJouini A.\n\nGomez P.\n\nSlimene K.\n\nCeballos S.\n\nTorres C.\n\nMaaroufi A.\n\nMolecular characterization and clonal diversity of methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolates of milk of cows with clinical mastitis in Tunisia.\n\n). In our study, all CC479 isolates were concomitant with spa type t267. In previous surveys, CC479 was considered a ruminant-associated clone, mainly found in severe bovine mastitis cases (\n\nBoss et al., 2016\n\nBoss R.\n\nCosandey A.\n\nLuini M.\n\nArtursson K.\n\nBardiau M.\n\nBreitenwieser F.\n\nHehenberger E.\n\nLam T.\n\nMansfeld M.\n\nMichel A.\n\nMosslacher G.\n\nNaskova J.\n\nNelson S.\n\nPodpecan O.\n\nRaemy A.\n\nRyan E.\n\nSalat O.\n\nZangerl P.\n\nSteiner A.\n\nGraber H.U.\n\nBovine Staphylococcus aureus: Subtyping, evolution, and zoonotic transfer.\n\n;\n\nHoekstra et al., 2019\n\nHoekstra J.\n\nRutten V.P.M.G.\n\nLam T.J.G.M.\n\nVan Kessel K.P.M.\n\nSpaninks M.P.\n\nStegeman J.A.\n\nBenedictus L.\n\nKoop G.\n\nActivation of a bovine mammary epithelial cell line by ruminant-associated Staphylococcus aureus is lineage dependent.\n\n). Furthermore, one Staph. aureus isolate was t359/CC97; this lineage has been detected in dairy cattle from South Africa (\n\nSchmidt et al., 2017\n\nSchmidt T.\n\nKock M.M.\n\nEhlers M.M.\n\nMolecular characterization of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bovine mastitis and close human contacts in South African dairy herds: Genetic diversity and inter-species host transmission.\n\n), Italy (\n\nFeltrin et al., 2015\n\nFeltrin F.\n\nAlba P.\n\nKraushaar B.\n\nIanzano A.\n\nArgudin M.A.\n\nDi Matteo P.\n\nPorrero M.C.\n\nAarestrup F.M.\n\nButaye P.\n\nFranco A.\n\nBattisti A.\n\nA livestock-associated, multidrug-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clonal complex 97 lineage spreading in dairy cattle and pigs in Italy.\n\n), and China (\n\nZhang et al., 2018\n\nZhang L.\n\nGao J.\n\nBarkema H.W.\n\nAli T.\n\nLiu G.\n\nDeng Y.\n\nNaushad S.\n\nKastelic J.P.\n\nHan B.\n\nVirulence gene profiles: Alpha-hemolysin and clonal diversity in Staphylococcus aureus isolates from bovine clinical mastitis in China.\n\n). It has also been reported as an uncommon cause of infections in small ruminants, pigs, and humans (\n\nSpoor et al., 2013\n\nSpoor L.E.\n\nMcAdam P.R.\n\nWeinert L.A.\n\nRambaut A.\n\nHasman H.\n\nAarestrup F.M.\n\nKearns A.M.\n\nLarsen A.R.\n\nSkov R.L.\n\nFitzgerald J.R.\n\nLivestock origin for a human pandemic clone of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n).\n\nA study conducted on 220 Staph. aureus isolates of the CC97 clone collected from different sources (bovine, human, porcine, and caprine origins) in 18 countries indicated that emergent clones of human epidemic community-associated MRSA resulted from livestock-to-human host jumps, as is the case for bovine Staph. aureus CC97 (\n\nSpoor et al., 2013\n\nSpoor L.E.\n\nMcAdam P.R.\n\nWeinert L.A.\n\nRambaut A.\n\nHasman H.\n\nAarestrup F.M.\n\nKearns A.M.\n\nLarsen A.R.\n\nSkov R.L.\n\nFitzgerald J.R.\n\nLivestock origin for a human pandemic clone of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n). These results suggest the importance of dairy cattle as a source of zoonotic bacterial pathogens, with eventual spread within human populations. Three other lineages were also detected in the current findings: CC45, CC15, and ST80. They are most often found to be associated with human MRSA isolates and have been reported from patients with atopic dermatitis in Canada (\n\nYeung et al., 2011\n\nYeung M.\n\nBalma-Mena A.\n\nShear N.\n\nSimor A.\n\nPope E.\n\nWalsh S.\n\nMcGavin M.J.\n\nIdentification of major clonal complexes and toxin producing strains among Staphylococcus aureus associated with atopic dermatitis.\n\n), and with endovascular infections in Spain (\n\nPérez-Montarelo et al., 2017\n\nPérez-Montarelo D.\n\nViedma E.\n\nMurcia M.\n\nMunoz-Gallego I.\n\nLarrosa N.\n\nBranas P.\n\nFernandez-Hidalgo N.\n\nGavalda J.\n\nAlmirante B.\n\nChaves F.\n\nPathogenic characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus endovascular infection isolates from different clonal complexes.\n\n).\n\nRecently, the emergence of MRSA-CC15 in Kuwait hospitals has been reported (\n\nUdo et al., 2020\n\nUdo E.E.\n\nBoswihi S.S.\n\nMathew B.\n\nNoronha B.\n\nVerghese T.\n\nAl-Jemaz A.\n\nAl Saqer F.\n\nEmergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus belonging to clonal complex 15 (CC15-MRSA) in Kuwait hospitals.\n\n). The European pandemic clone ST80 has already been detected among MRSA in Algerian hospitals, and was responsible for more than one-third of community and nosocomial infections in Algiers in the 2000s decade (35.7 and 35.8%, respectively;\n\nRamdani-Bouguessa et al., 2006\n\nRamdani-Bouguessa N.\n\nBes M.\n\nMeugnier H.\n\nForey F.\n\nReverdy M.E.\n\nLina G.\n\nVandenesch F.\n\nTazir M.\n\nEtienne J.\n\nDetection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to multiple antibiotics and carrying the Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes in an Algiers hospital.\n\n;\n\nAntri et al., 2011\n\nAntri K.\n\nRouzic N.\n\nDauwalder O.\n\nBoubekri I.\n\nBes M.\n\nLina G.\n\nVandenesch F.\n\nTazir M.\n\nRamdani-Bouguessa N.\n\nEtienne J.\n\nHigh prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clone ST80-IV in hospital and community settings in Algiers.\n\n;\n\nAlioua et al., 2014\n\nAlioua M.A.\n\nLabid A.\n\nAmoura K.\n\nBertine M.\n\nGacemi-Kirane D.\n\nDekhil M.\n\nEmergence of the European ST80 clone of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as a cause of healthcare-associated infections in Eastern Algeria.\n\n). The first detection of the community-associated MRSA CC80 clone in Europe goes back to 1997 in Denmark, as mentioned by\n\nStegger et al., 2014\n\nStegger M.\n\nWirth T.\n\nAndersen P.S.\n\nSkov R.L.\n\nDe Grassi A.\n\nSimões P.M.\n\nTristan A.\n\nPetersen A.\n\nAziz M.\n\nKiil K.\n\nCirković I.\n\nUdo E.E.\n\ndel Campo R.\n\nVuopio-Varkila J.\n\nAhmad N.\n\nTokajian S.\n\nPeters G.\n\nSchaumburg F.\n\nOlsson-Liljequist B.\n\nGivskov M.\n\nDriebe E.E.\n\nVigh H.E.\n\nShittu A.\n\nRamdani-Bougessa N.\n\nRasigade J.-P.\n\nPrice L.B.\n\nVandenesch F.\n\nLarsen A.R.\n\nLaurent F.\n\nOrigin and evolution of european methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus..\n\n, who believed that this lineage evolved from a methicillin-susceptible Staph. aureus ancestor that might have originated from sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIn the present work, only the ST80 isolate harbored the scn gene, as well as the lukF/lukS-PV genes, which is considered a frequent virulence factor in this lineage. Interestingly, the presence of scn in this isolate suggests its potential human origin. In Algeria, few studies have described detection of PVL-containing Staph. aureus isolates in the cattle environment associated with mastitis cases or in food samples (\n\nBenhamed and Kihal, 2013\n\nBenhamed N.\n\nKihal M.\n\nPhenotypic and genotypic characterization of Staphylococcus aureus agents of dairy cows' mastitis in Algeria.\n\n;\n\nChaalal et al., 2018\n\nChaalal W.\n\nChaalal N.\n\nBourafa N.\n\nKihal M.\n\nDiene S.M.\n\nRolain J.M.\n\nCharacterization of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from food products in Western Algeria.\n\n).\n\nThe present study demonstrated the absence of the eta, etb, tst, sea, seb, and sep genes among the Staph. aureus isolates. In fact, toxic shock syndrome and exfoliative toxins are more frequently detected among clinical isolates. In the case of food samples, staphylococcal enterotoxins are especially relevant because of their potential implication in food poisoning. In this sense, staphylococcal enterotoxins were frequently detected in raw milk collected in Northern Algeria (\n\nTitouche et al., 2019\n\nTitouche Y.\n\nHakem A.\n\nHouali K.\n\nMeheut T.\n\nVingadassalon N.\n\nRuiz-Ripa L.\n\nSalmi D.\n\nChergui A.\n\nChenouf N.\n\nHennekinne J.A.\n\nTorres C.\n\nAuvray F.\n\nEmergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST8 in raw milk and traditional dairy products in the Tizi Ouzou area of Algeria.\n\n).\n\nThe clonal lineage CC398 was not detected among our Staph. aureus isolates. This result could be explained by the fact that this lineage is mainly isolated from pigs (\n\nLozano et al., 2009\n\nLozano C.\n\nLopez M.\n\nGomez-Sanz E.\n\nRuiz-Larrea F.\n\nTorres C.\n\nZarazaga M.\n\nDetection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ST398 in food samples of animal origin in Spain.\n\n).\n\nA multidrug-resistant phenotype was detected in 9 of 45 staphylococci (20%), and a variety of resistance genes were also detected. These results indicate a serious public health issue, considering that these microorganisms may be transferred to humans via milk consumption, as well as the danger of therapeutic failures. In agreement with several previous reports (\n\nMatallah et al., 2019\n\nMatallah A.M.\n\nBouayad L.\n\nBoudjellaba S.\n\nMebkhout F.\n\nHamdi T.M.\n\nRamdani-Bouguessa N.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus isolated from selected dairies of Algeria: Prevalence and susceptibility to antibiotics.\n\n;\n\nTitouche et al., 2019\n\nTitouche Y.\n\nHakem A.\n\nHouali K.\n\nMeheut T.\n\nVingadassalon N.\n\nRuiz-Ripa L.\n\nSalmi D.\n\nChergui A.\n\nChenouf N.\n\nHennekinne J.A.\n\nTorres C.\n\nAuvray F.\n\nEmergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST8 in raw milk and traditional dairy products in the Tizi Ouzou area of Algeria.\n\n), the highest level of resistance was noted toward penicillin, tetracycline, and erythromycin, with blaZ, tetK, and ermB being the most common corresponding genotypes, respectively. The β-lactam class is known to be extensively used in Algerian dairy cattle against staphylococcal mastitis, which remains the major reason for use of antibiotics in bovines (\n\nSaidi et al., 2019\n\nSaidi R.\n\nMimoune N.\n\nBaazizi R.\n\nBenaissa M.H.\n\nKhelef D.\n\nKaidi R.\n\nAntibiotic susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from bovine mastitis in Algeria.\n\n). Tetracycline has a bacteriostatic effect and is commonly used and recommended in cattle for the treatment of septicemia, respiratory, digestive, genitourinary, and interdigital infections (\n\nBarour et al., 2019\n\nBarour D.\n\nBerghiche A.\n\nBoulebda N.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli isolates from cattle in Eastern Algeria.\n\n). Likewise, erythromycin, being the second macrolide intended for use in animals, has long been prescribed for acute mastitis caused by gram-positive bacteria in lactating dairy cows because of its good distribution in the mammary gland (\n\nBajwa et al., 2007\n\nBajwa N.S.\n\nBansal B.K.\n\nSrivastava A.K.\n\nRanjan R.\n\nPharmacokinetic profile of erythromycin after intramammary administration in lactating dairy cows with specific mastitis.\n\n). The long-term use of these antibiotics, considering that they belong to older drug families prescribed in bovines, either for therapeutic or prophylactic reasons, can largely explain the high resistance rates because of selection pressure. From the animal and public health perspectives, Staph. aureus and CNS are of major concern, especially where animal-derived foods and humans intersect, mainly through the food chain. These results provide insight into antibio-resistance in Algerian cattle farms that may be contributing to therapeutic failures in cattle farming, the emergence of resistance by gene transfer between species, and the presence of antibiotic residues in milk. This study highlights the need to reduce and optimize the use of antibiotics in livestock animals.\n\nThe screening for methicillin resistance, performed via cefoxitin disk diffusion test, revealed 3 MR-CNS, all of which carried mecA. These results highlight the role that CNS may play as a potential donor of mecA gene to other staphylococcal species, mainly those with greater pathogenic properties, such as Staph. aureus. Currently, MR-CNS are receiving significant attention in human and animal health and have been described in cattle, animal handlers, and their environment (\n\nVenugopal et al., 2019\n\nVenugopal N.\n\nMitra S.\n\nTewari R.\n\nGanaie F.\n\nShome R.\n\nRahman H.\n\nShome B.R.\n\nMolecular detection and typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from cattle, animal handlers, and their environment from Karnataka, Southern Province of India.\n\n), in companion animals and their owners (\n\nGómez-Sanz et al., 2019\n\nGómez-Sanz E.\n\nCeballos S.\n\nRuiz-Ripa L.\n\nZarazaga M.\n\nTorres C.\n\nClonally diverse methicillin and multidrug resistant coagulase negative staphylococci are ubiquitous and pose transfer ability between pets and their owners.\n\n), and also in clinical isolates from hospitals (\n\nKitti et al., 2018\n\nKitti T.\n\nSeng R.\n\nSaiprom N.\n\nThummeepak R.\n\nChantratita N.\n\nBoonlao C.\n\nSitthisak S.\n\nMolecular characteristics of methicillin-resistant staphylococci clinical isolates from a tertiary hospital in Northern Thailand.\n\n). In Algeria, data on MR-CNS are lacking. Therefore, complementary studies with larger sample sizes (from cattle and cattle workers) are required to better investigate the dissemination and epidemiology of MR-CNS in cattle sector.\n\nPhenotypically, no methicillin resistance was detected among our Staph. aureus isolates by antibiogram. However, the t044/ST80 isolate was found to carry the mecA gene (CS-MRSA). Detection of mecA is not performed routinely in Algerian microbiology laboratories; therefore, misclassification may occur. Detection of emerging MRSA variants, such as CS-MRSA, is increasingly described. This discrepancy between phenotype and genotype could be explained by an eventual default in mecA expression. Methicillin-susceptible mecA-containing Staph. aureus isolates were also reported in university and general hospitals in Brazil (\n\nAndrade-Figueiredo and Leal-Balbino, 2016\n\nAndrade-Figueiredo M.\n\nLeal-Balbino T.C.\n\nClonal diversity and epidemiological characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus: high prevalence of oxacillin-susceptible mecA-positive Staphylococcus aureus (OS-MRSA) associated with clinical isolates in Brazil.\n\n) and Japan (\n\nHososaka et al., 2007\n\nHososaka Y.\n\nHanaki H.\n\nEndo H.\n\nSuzuki Y.\n\nNakae T.\n\nNagasawa Z.\n\nOtsuka Y.\n\nSunakawa K.\n\nCharacterization of oxacillin-susceptible mecA-positive Staphylococcus aureus: A new type of MRSA.\n\n), and in processed food from Europe (\n\nQuijada et al., 2019\n\nQuijada N.M.\n\nHernandez M.\n\nOniciuc E.A.\n\nEiros J.M.\n\nFernandez-Natal I.\n\nWagner M.\n\nRodriguez-Lazaro D.\n\nOxacillin-susceptible mecA-positive Staphylococcus aureus associated with processed food in Europe.\n\n). To the best of our knowledge, the current paper is the first report of CS-MRSA in Algeria. Further in-depth characterization of the CS-MRSA isolate detected in this study is warranted, to characterize its methicillin resistance expression. The significance of this study lies in its extensive character, describing the prevalence and genetic characterization of both CPS and CNS from raw milk sold in Djelfa city. This study could also be regarded as a food safety survey given that its findings are intended to be communicated and applied across the Algerian dairy chain."
