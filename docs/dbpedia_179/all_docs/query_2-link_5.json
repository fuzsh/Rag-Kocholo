        "text": "Green walls and green dams are increasingly being considered as part of many nation-al and international desertification initiatives. This paper studies the spatiotemporal evolution of the green dam in the Moudjbara region (Djelfa Province, Algeria) from 1972 to 2019 by using Landsat imagery, Land Change Modeler and Open Land package. The future evolution of pine plantations for the year 2029 was also forecasted, based on an anthropogenic scenario (i.e., an-thropogenic pressure is the main driver of the green dam destruction). Our findings revealed that the green dam project was successful for a few years, but after that, pine plantations deteri-orated significantly due to forest harvesting, livestock overgrazing, and the proliferation of the pine caterpillar processionary, which destroyed most of the reforestation. Land Change Modeler predicted a huge degradation of pine plantations for the year 2029, and if the deforestation con-tinues at the same rate, the green dam will disappear in the Moudjbara region during the next few decades. Aware of this threat, the Algerian authorities are now planning to reforest more than 1.2 million ha under the latest rural renewal policy by introducing new principles related to sustainable development, fighting desertification, and climate change adaptation\n\nMoudjbara area considered a gateway to Algeria's Great Sahara, was the first perimeter to be afforested with Aleppo pine in 1972 as part of a green dam initiative to combat desertification and preserve soil from wind erosion. This study examines the evolution of the species Pinus Halepensis Mill commonly known as the Aleppo pine in the Moudjbara plantations by comparing it to that of the natural forest of the Djellal Mountains in the Chergui region. Several field surveys were conducted, and four sites were selected in the natural forest and four sites in the Moudjbara afforestation. In each site, we performed 50 dendrometric measurements with 200 tree stakes. The selection is based on information on regeneration and plant quality. Stations are classified into four categories namely station of good regeneration, station slightly well regenerated, station moderately regenerated, and station of weak regeneration, which allow us to have primary reference data and to make a reliable assessment of the behavior of Aleppo pine in the Green Dam. The attribute ranking obtained from the ANOVA approximation provides us with crucial information of comparison between the natural forest and the reforestation zone. The results obtained can be used to adjust the planting density, rigorously choose the species, and adapt the soil preparation and planting techniques.\n\nMoudjbara area considered a gateway to Algeria's Great Sahara, was the first perimeter to be afforested with Aleppo pine in 1972 as part of a green dam initiative to combat desertification and preserve soil from wind erosion.

In this context, holistic studies are more useful than localized ones in addressing this issue. In this study, we used the desertification sensitivity index (DSI) to pinpoint regions of Algeria that are at risk of desertification and to examine significant shifts in the sensitivity of land to desertification between 2000 and 2020, as well as the primary drivers of these shifts. Unlike the standard Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use (MEDALUS) approach, which uses equal weighting of parameters and quality indicators to construct the environmental sensitivity areas, the DSI applies statistically generated weights. Our results showed that approximately 106,000 km 2 of the non-desert area was extremely susceptible to desertification in 2000, 83,200 km 2 in 2010, and 98,200 km 2 in 2020, with critical zones mainly located in the High Plains (steppe rangelands). Our analysis revealed that climate and vegetation quality indicators were the main drivers of the DSI, which showed a nonlinear trend during the study period. The analysis of changes in land sensitivity to desertification revealed that most of the changes were negative and occurred in the High Plains, as well as certain areas of the Tell Atlas Mountain ranges and the littoral fringe. However, some positive changes occurred due to the establishment of new forest plantations and croplands. The results provide a comprehensive overview of the risk of desertification in Algeria and its main drivers and can serve as a scientific basis for the development and implementation of necessary measures to interrupt and combat this destructive environmental phenomenon."
