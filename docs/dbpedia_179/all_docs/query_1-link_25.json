        "text": "Introduction\n\nCystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic zoonosis caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus, a cestode that represents a public health priority due to its worldwide distribution and its impact on human and animal health (Craig et al., 2017). CE is now included in the list of the 20 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) for which control measures are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2011; Casulli et al., 2023). The life cycle of the parasite involves a variety of wild and domestic ungulates as intermediate hosts as well as canids as definitive hosts. In pastoral farming of the Mediterranean areas the disease is still highly prevalent in animals and humans, and primarily affects sheep and dogs (Deplazes et al., 2017; Cringoli et al., 2021). Among European countries, Greece reported an overall prevalence of E. granulosus infections in sheep up to 30.4–53.8% (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2008; Chaligiannis et al., 2015) and 50.4% in shepherd dogs (Sotiraki et al., 2003), whereas central-southern and insular regions of Italy reported high values of prevalence up to 75.0% in sheep and 6.0% in dogs (Deplazes et al., 2017; Bosco et al., 2021; Cringoli et al., 2021). The prevalence of CE in Algeria reaches values of 78.0% in sheep (Hamrat et al., 2011; Ouchene et al., 2014) and 42.0% in dogs (Bentounsi et al., 2009), while in Tunisia values of about 40.0% (Lahmar et al., 2013) and 21.0% (Lahmar et al., 2001) are reported in sheep and in dogs, respectively. Control programmes against E. granulosus are considered long-term public health measures that require an integrated approach, including various actions for animals and humans in terms of surveillance, prevention, treatment and education (Craig et al., 2017; Cringoli et al., 2021). In this framework, new innovative actions to control CE in the Mediterranean areas have been implemented with the aim of increasing surveillance and control strategies against E. granulosus in definitive and intermediate hosts (Cringoli et al., 2021; Rinaldi et al., 2022). However, despite the implementation of such control initiatives, CE still remains a problem in the Mediterranean areas due to its high infection rate.\n\nIn this context, the targeted de-worming of dogs with praziquantel (PZQ), i.e. the anthelmintic which has been proven to be effective against mature and immature adult stages of E. granulosus (Lightowlers et al., 2021), is the mainstay of almost all successful control efforts against CE (Craig et al., 2017). Indeed, dogs play a crucial role in the transmission of CE as they can roam freely in grazing areas and prey on livestock, also acting as carriers of others zoonotic diseases (Cringoli et al., 2007; Mestel, 2017; Wang et al., 2022). These aspects are further exacerbated in the case of not-owned dogs, which are estimated to constitute around 75% of the global dog population (Hughes and MacDonald, 2013) and are considered important reservoirs of E. granulosus as well as other zoonotic parasites (Otero-Abad and Torgerson, 2013; Deplazes et al., 2017; Otranto et al., 2017). Therefore, the potential role of not-owned dogs in contaminating the environment by shedding worms or eggs is a critical issue in the control of CE and other zoonoses (FAO, 2014). Also, the lack of preventive strategies against not-owned dogs, due to their unrestricted freedom of movements, could contribute to a significant increase in the incidence of CE in endemic areas (Deplazes et al., 2011; Esch and Petersen, 2013; Baneth et al., 2016).\n\nThe control of E. granulosus infection will necessarily include both owned and not-owned dogs (Kachani and Heath, 2014), so an effective control strategy based on the anthelmintic treatment of not-owned dogs is required to be implemented. An attempt might be to reduce the prevalence of E. granulosus by regularly baiting with PZQ, which appears to be the most effective tool for limiting the transmission of CE in dog populations (Lightowlers et al., 2021). A similar strategy has been adopted against E. multilocularis in fox populations (Eckert and Deplazes, 2004), as PZQ-laced baits released into the environment that are attractive to the target animal species have already been successfully used in several parts of the world in anthelmintic campaigns targeting foxes against E. multilocularis (reviewed in Umhang et al., 2019), as well as in canids to control E. granulosus (Yu et al., 2017). However, to date, the use of baits containing PZQ has never been considered as a new control action against CE in Mediterranean countries.\n\nThe effectiveness of these strategies requires baits that are attractive and accepted by the target population. To this end, 3 different types of PZQ-laced baits were tested in this study. Different characteristics, such as integrity over time, attractiveness and palatability to the dogs, as well as mechanical resistance at different heights when dropped by a drone were evaluated in order to establish which was most suitable for deworming not-owned dogs, with the aim of implementing CE control programmes in the Mediterranean area. Finally, the acceptability and uptake of the baits by the target animals, i.e. not-owned dogs, was evaluated under field conditions in southern Italy by means of camera traps.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis paper reports the results of a study aimed at assessing the best bait for deworming not-owned dogs to be included in effective control programmes in order to reduce the transmission of CE in endemic areas. Currently, prevention and control strategies for CE are based on an integrated approach, whose main actions can be listed as follows: regulation of slaughter activity and disposal of offal; prevention of dogs accessing offal; de-worming of shepherd/owned dogs (most frequently with PZQ); highly effective vaccination (with vaccine EG95) to prevent ovine CE; and public health education (Craig et al., 2017; Larrieu et al., 2017; Cringoli et al., 2021).\n\nTo date, only 3 control programmes implemented in countries and/or on islands (Iceland, New Zealand, Tasmanis, Kalkland Islands and Cyprus) have achieved eradication within 10–12 years, through specific policies focused on the control of CE in the dog definitive hosts (Craig et al., 2007). In other countries, despite the attempted control initiatives, CE remains a problem with a high infection rate, especially in the Mediterranean areas (Deplazes et al., 2017; Bosco et al., 2021; Cringoli et al., 2021). Most control programmes are based on the integration of different tasks as control strategies, including the anthelmintic treatment of shepherd dogs present on each farm (Craig et al., 2017). Deworming activities are usually performed with owned dogs tied to a chain or, by means of a purpose-built cage, known as ‘EchinoCage’, which made it possible to treat and analyse almost all the dogs present on the sheep farms (Cringoli et al., 2021), whereas the treatment of not-owned dogs has often been neglected.\n\nNot-owned dogs are seen as a major contributor to the spread and persistence of CE in many countries, because they roam freely in grazing areas and prey on livestock offal, disseminating Echinococcus eggs into the environment. To date, no data are available concerning the environmental contamination with Echinococcus eggs in dogs (Deplazes et al., 2011). Hegglin and Deplazes (2013) estimated, instead, that, with respect to definitive host species, the contribution to environmental contamination with Echinococcus multilocularis eggs was of 400 to 6,600 eggs /m2, presenting a significant infection risk for humans and animals. Because of the importance of not-owned dogs in CE transmission, along with the extreme difficulties in treating them with anthelmintics (Kachani and Heath, 2014), new tools are needed to ensure that control programmes are implemented effectively.\n\nIn light of this background, the distribution of anthelmintic PZQ baits against wild and not-owned definitive hosts could be a good approach, leading to a significant reduction in CE prevalence. Baiting campaigns for alveolar echinococcosis control and oral rabies vaccination (ORV) (Comte et al., 2013; Umhang et al., 2019) have proven to be highly effective over the years, suggesting that the control of CE by treating not-owned dogs in extra-urban endemic areas is also feasible. The usefulness of PZQ-laced baits in the control of CE for the treatment of stray dogs has already been proven by Yu et al. (2017), but the use of baits containing PZQ has never been considered in Mediterranean countries as a new control action against CE. For this reason, there are several aspects to be considered in CE control when the use of medicated baits is included.\n\nFirst, an important premise for a successful baiting campaign is the availability of a bait that is well accepted (highly palatable) by the target species under field conditions (Gibson et al., 2019). It is known that palatability is affected by several factors, such as physical aspect, taste and dosage form (Adenot and Abdelhakim, 2022). These factors are highly influenced by environmental exposure; in particular, rainfall, soil moisture, and temperature could play an important role in the longevity of baits (Allsop et al., 2017). Musto et al. (2022) have shown a high rate of degradation of the baits (loss of their characteristic scent and shape) used in central Italy for ORV campaigns in wild canids, which occurred after approximately 1 week due to weather conditions. These findings are in line with our study, where only the double PZQ-laced baits showed a better preservation up to 10 days under different climatic conditions, compared to the other 2 types of baits, which were found to be already broken or degenerated by the fifth day. This is most likely due to the presence of a double layer that avoids, for example, water penetration and thus increases the longevity of the bait. Indeed, the bait matrix (especially the ‘skin’ of the bait) greatly affects its integrity (Allsop et al., 2017).\n\nSecond, once the integrity of the bait was evaluated, their attractiveness and palatability over time were also assessed by preference testing (Thombre, 2004; Adenot and Abdelhakim, 2022) in order to find the best type of baits for the delivery on the field. Assessing the palatability of any proposed formulation on the target population prior to a baiting programme is an important step in predicting the effectiveness of that formulation for a particular population (Kappes et al., 2022). Although the baits tested in our study are all commercial products with a well-known high palatability, not all 3 baits showed the same attractiveness. The Milbemax® Chewable tablets proved to be the least attractive in contrast to Petry et al. (2014), in which the dogs accepted the tablets well if taken directly from their owner's hand. In this study, it was observed that Milbemax® Chewable tablets were not chosen voluntarily by dogs if distributed in a green space compared to other options (single and double PZQ-laced baits). This study found also that dogs' age, sex and breed had no significant impact on bait acceptance, as previously shown in other studies (Bender et al., 2017; Bonwitt et al., 2020).\n\nThird, the last parameter tested was the mechanical resistance of the baits released from different altitudes. No damage was observed in all the double PZQ baits, distributed onto different surfaces and on different types of ground after drone release, up to heights of 25 m. A similar study was carried out during ORV campaigns, when the vaccine was distributed by helicopter onto solid ground at different altitudes and speeds, as reviewed by Mahl et al. (2014). The final aim of evaluating the integrity after release from different heights is to assess the feasibility of using drones for bait distribution, which might be useful in case of inaccessible areas (Yu et al., 2017). The custom drone used in this study was developed ad hoc for the delivery of medicated baits, aiming to improve deworming activities in the study area (Caputo et al., 2022) with advantages in terms of time, cost and manpower.\n\nSince it is extremely difficult to recreate field conditions, the baits that had produced the best results during the preliminary trial (i.e. double PZQ-laced baits) were distributed manually in a grazing area, and their acceptance by not-owned dogs was investigated. Bait acceptance trials are an essential part of examining the feasibility of baiting campaigns (Estrada et al., 2001), and the best baiting strategy is characterized by high bait acceptance from target species and low bait acceptance from non-target species (Guthery et al., 1984). In this study, to investigate bait acceptance from target and non-target species camera traps were placed in strategic points and the acquired images were analysed. The evaluation of bait uptake using camera traps is a non-invasive control method that yields detailed data on bait competition between different species under different conditions (Hegglin et al., 2004). The camera traps photographed mostly not-owned dogs, and baits disappeared quickly from the baiting sites. The main competitors, i.e. non-target species, were wild boars and foxes, as also reported by Musto et al. (2022) in central Italy. However, it is important to point out that PZQ represents no risk for extra-urban wildlife, and the inadvertent treatment of non-target species presents minimal risk (Hegglin et al., 2004). The results obtained on the field underline that, despite high densities of wild animals, baits were mostly consumed by not-owned dogs, confirming the high attractiveness of double PZQ-laced baits for the target population. Furthermore, the continued removal of baits by not-owned dogs suggests that an anthelmintic baiting programme may be a viable tool for the management of E. granulosus among free-ranging dog populations in endemic rural areas. However, it is necessary to consider that to optimize the distribution of baits as well as the bait density, it should be taken in consideration the presence of target and non-target population in each area and adapt it accordingly, in order to significantly reduce the prevalence. In conclusion, while baiting for deworming not-owned dogs has been successfully tested in southern Italy, future perspectives will aim to validate it also in other countries of the Mediterranean area, in order to include these strategies in effective control programmes and reduce the transmission of CE in endemic areas."
