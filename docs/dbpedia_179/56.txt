Does the map work on iPhones and iPads?

Yes! It does.

Does the map require jQuery or other dependencies?

No. The map does not use any jQuery and it won't interfere with jQuery or other common libraries you may be using on your page.

What browsers are supported?

Chrome, Firefox, Safari 3.2+, iOS Safari 3.2+, Opera, Opera Mobile, Internet Explorer 7+, Android Browser 3+, Android Chrome and more.

Is it possible to split states?

Yes, although this requires a little bit of work. We can do this for you for $15 per state. Or, if you are technically inclined, follow these instructions.

Do you have any examples?

Sure! We haven't created any examples specific to Algeria. But you can see what's possible by checking out these US Examples or World Examples. These maps are built on the same framework (and therefore have the same functionality) as this Algeria map.

There is a mistake in this map, can you fix it?

Yes. Since Algeria isn't one of more popular maps, it was generated by a script and it's possible that a mistake crept in. If so, please contact us so that we can fix it.
