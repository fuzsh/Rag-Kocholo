        "text": "Some time ago, I was chatting with a friend of mine about BeForU as he is familiar with the group. To get straight to the point, we have different tastes in music (not saying he didn’t like BeForU at all, he only likes certain members). And it made me start thinking of what I gravitate to in terms of Japanese music.\n\nMy friend’s position on vocal types is basically extremely cutesy voices don’t go well with him. Instead, he tends to like singers who 1) can stay on pitch (he claims that artists like Hitomi Yaida and Ayumi Hamasaki can’t stay on pitch well) and 2) he likes artists that have relatively deep voices (such as Yoma Komatsu from BeForU‘s original line up and Miwa Yoshida from Dreams Come True). I’ll get to the reason for why I said “relatively” in a moment.\n\nNow just to state it, I AGREE with him to a certain extent. This is because, from my experience with finding new music, cutesy is more marketable in Japan. And “cute” isn’t always what I’m looking for. Now, when I say cute, to me it means being higher up in their range. Also, the way I see it, it’s when the singer sounds younger than they’re supposed to be. Listen to Riyu Kosaka’s “3D♥HEART” for example (it’s one of the few songs by her that I dislike so much).\n\nI’m not going to say that I am an expert as I am not bombarded by a large variety of groups or soloists everyday (as a foreigner, I tend to lurk around youtube to find new artists to listen to). But in my experience, cute is just something you have to sift through to get what you actually like (in my friend’s case, something a little more deep[vocally]).\n\n(I managed to find an english sub of Yousei Teikoku‘s “Wahrheit” for you all).\n\nEven here, in a group with an edgy sound, Yui’s (the singer’s) voice can tend to be “cute” or “very sweet”. To me, I find it to be incredibly interesting to have such a voice with “gothic” style music –they themselves are advertised as gothic with album titles such as “GOTHIC LOLITA PROPERGANDA” (2007) and “Gothic Loilta Doctrine” (2009). It adds to the challenge of conveying an emotion (which is clarified by the general sound of the music. In Yousei Tekoku’s case, the emotions are dark and heavy).\n\nNow, back to the whole “cute” thing. I really do get where my friend is coming from. There is only so much bubbly, pink, upbeat-ness I can take before I want to claw my ears off. That being said, when it comes to artist who have cute voices (such as Riyu Kosaka from BeForU), the accompaniment that goes along with their singing can be a saving grace. For example, with “Wahrheit”, the overall aggressive sound of the track makes up for Yui’s somewhat “cute” voice.\n\nWhen I want my fix for deeper voices, I tend to turn to Mari Mizuno from Paris Match (a jazz group) or Mika Nakashima (contemporary music, somewhat experimental at times) and also, Misia (primarily R&B, and she has an expansive vocal range from very deep to very high). They don’t have the kind of bubblegum pop of sweet voices as some other singers in Japan, but their voices are great. For example, check out Paris Match’s “Summer Breeze”, Mika Nakashima’s “Over Load” and Misia’s “Wasurenai Hibi”.\n\nI do realize that the vast majority of artists/lead singers of groups I tend to listen to are female. What can I say, I like the sound of women’s voices. Don’t ask me why this is the case. Because I have no idea to be completely honest.\n\nThe purpose of this whole rant isn’t necessarily to completely trash some of the cuter voices in Japan. I actually don’t mind them too much. Looking at my music collection, I have more than my fair share of voices I consider “cute”. I’ll spare you details so this entry can be relatively short. And with that said, I think I’ll end my rant here.\n\nI had originally created a video review for this album, but it got removed from youtube. It was removed so fast, I was more than surprised–I was highly annoyed. It had only been up for a few days. Alas, the video review is off the web, but it won’t stop me from writing a review!\n\nAnwyway, This review is going to be for NANA starring MIKA NAKASHIMA’s first and last album “THE END”. I’ll try not to be too wordy.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, Mika Nakashima played Nana Osaki in the live action movie adaptions of Ai Yazawa’s manga series “NANA”. This album—the first and last by NANA starring MIKA NAKASHIMA—is the compilation of songs used in the movies as well as new songs.\n\nThe album was released on December 13th, 2006 onSony Music Associated Records.\n\nOff the bat, I would like to say that Mika Nakashima’s vocals are solid on this album. Warm and somewhat soulful, her voice fits very nicely in this album. Another thing, the prominent genre in this album is rock, rock and more rock. There is no touching ballad and the closest thing to it in my opinion is Isolation. This may be a turn off for some people, because Nakashima is known for other genres (somewhat experimental at times, R&B, some blues, and so on).\n\nAnyway, let’s start\n\n1) Hitoiro [ PV (Promotional Video)]\n\nThe track starts off right away. In terms of composition, the vocal melody is very nice and catchy, and is very smooth from the verses, pre-choruses and choruses. Arrangement-wise, this is the most interestingly arranged song on the entire album. The use of a woodwind instrument at the end of the chorus is a nice touch. Usually, you wouldn’t find such an instrument in a rock track. This track also involves a strings section and bells. Also not as common in rock tracks, it provides a very professionally done feel. (Compared to the fact that Nana was unsigned in the first movie, this type of professional feel wouldn’t happen if the group was unsigned).\n\n2) EYES FOR THE MOON\n\nThis track also starts right away. The vocal styling is similar to Hitoiro’s in range which is most likely why it is the track right after (as to not create a jarring effect). It doesn’t require much transition between the two tracks. The melody is less catchy but the arrangement makes up for that in my opinion. It still sounds peppy and is completely a rock setting with the drums more pronounced.\n\n3) GLAMOROUS SKY [Here’s a live version, slightly shortened. And here’s a nice acoustic version of the song.]\n\nThe first single for the album/NANA movie, it has a very mainstream sound compared to Eyes for the Moon. It also starts right away.The melody is very catchy (in particular the chorus, which is of course common to pop tracks). “Ano niji wo~” (I love the way she sings that phrase).\n\n4) BLOWING OUT\n\nWOAH. We’re still going strong with the peppy arrangements. This song is half in English and compared to other Japanese singers, her English diction is AMAZING. Unfortunately, the arrangement takes over at times, covering up the lyrics at some point. Though one may argue that her accent (being Japanese) may be another reason why the words aren’t as clear. But I’ve enjoyed worst pronunciations so I’m not going to go on about Nakashima’s English. Like I wrote earlier, the song is still peppy yet one of most energetic arrangements of the whole album. This is the first original song for the album.\n\n5) MY MEDICINE [ There’s a PV (Promotional Video) to it, but I cannot find the video right now. Anywhoo, here’s the track with a picture.]\n\nThis song happens to have one of the longer introductions to it. This song is entirely in English, and again, Nakashima’s diction is very clear. It’s not as peppy as the first four songs, but I think we needed a break from that anyway. There’s a harder electric guitar sound to it, the drums in your face. Talking about drums, one may get tired of the use of the cymbal in the chorus, but thankfully they aren’t too loud (unless you’re listening for the drums). Oh and “I got hooked on your love nicotine” has the strongest vocals in the album. And it is beautiful.\n\n6)NEGLEST MIND\n\nDon’t ask me what a Neglest mind is. I checked the dictionary and it isn’t a word. Oh well I’ve learned how to deal with that. Anyway, this is another original song for the album. The vocals are slightly hard to hear as the arrangement is a bit loud, which can be off-putting to some. The cymbals come back in this track and is slightly annoying (during 1:48 – 2:00 specifically, though the cymbals occur on and off throughout the track). Otherwise, the melody isn’t the catchiest of melodies though if you listen to the song enough, you will get something stuck in your head.\n\n7) REAL WORLD\n\nAnother original song. Again, the vocals can be hard to hear. This is especially true because I suspect they used a slight vocal effect in this track, as Nakashima’s voice seems distant at some points. The band arrangement, however, is very clear. This melody also comes out as not very catchy, but again, something of it will get stuck in your head.\n\n8) ISOLATION\n\nWhile it wasn’t used in the movies, this was originally from the “GLAMOROUS SKY” single (mini-album thing). Personally, its one of my favorite tracks on the album. From the title alone, the feeling of being stuck somewhere is clearly represented by the repetitive two notes in the verse in the bass (or is that electric guitar? Honestly, I still get the two confused). Anyway, the vocals are truly strong for the most part. At the end, there is a hint of hesitation, which I feel gives the song a bit of personality (and the reason why I love it so much).\n\n9) BLOOD\n\nThis was used as the background music for KATE (a Japanese brand of makeup) commercial. Honestly, this is one of the songs that I have to be in the mood to listen to. The verses aren’t very catchy melody wise, but the bass is what makes the verses memorable for me. Once you get to the chorus with its clear English and when the instruments kind of take a step back, that’s where the melody shines. This isn’t saying that the melody is catchy because there are songs on this album with catchier melodies. But the lyrics are what make it the most memorable. This doesn’t happen with me often, as most of the time I can’t understand whats being said (unless I find a translation) but as the lyrics are in English… I do take notice. But anyway, this is one of the most least memorable songs to me.\n\n10) hitoiro <ALTArnative>\n\nOne question: Why? Hitoiro was already a wonderful song. It had one of the most unique sounds to it due to that woodwind. Though I do realize that maybe hitoiro was re-arranged for that reason. It fit into the album, but wasn’t as rock-y as the rest of the tracks on the album. But I digress. I’m not sure if Nakashima re-sung the song for the re-arrangement, but it doesn’t seem like it. It just has a heavier sound to it. Now, in all honesty, they could have left one of the versions as the single and had more people buy the single for the single exclusive song, but alas they did not do it in this way. That’s just my two cents.\n\n11) MY WAY\n\nFirst off, this is a cover of a cover of a cover in a way. Sid Vicious (whose version Nakashima is covering) changed some of the lyrics of “My Way” popularized by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra popularized the song which was originally a song in French with similar lyrics (this is only because Frank Sinatra is known for songs he didn’t debut . That out of the way, this sounds live, but may not necessarily have been recorded live in one take –ah the magic of studio work. I claim this because there is a bleep out of the word “cat” in “I killed a cat” (no not the F-word. “cat”). Anyway, it doesn’t seem too ad-libbed as some live songs are. The rough sound of Nakashima’s vocals adds some personality to the entire song and I feel it is a good fit as to Nana Osaki’s Character (even though this wasn’t used in the movie).\n\nNow for the pros and cons of the album\n\nPros:\n\n-Strong voice\n\n-Comfortable range for the voice\n\n-Rock = cool\n\nCons:\n\n-Only one genre (rock)\n\n-Similar instrumentation (two guitars, bass, drums) in all tracks\n\n-Similar vocal sound\n\nSCORE:\n\nVocals: 5/5\n\nComposition: 4/5\n\nArrangement: 4/5\n\nConstruction: 5/5\n\nTotal: 18/20 (Pretty great!)\n\nOverall:\n\nThe album was straight to the point. As if they want you to get to the substance of the songs ASAP, there were very few introductions (like 8 bar phrases with just music, no vocals). I personally love that. They didn’t include any interludes as well, which is great for me. I’m not a huge fan of interludes anyway (unless it acts as a bridge to connect two completely contrasting songs or unless its that good).\n\nAnyway, that’s it for this review!\n\nSome links:\n\nKumo no Ito (unofficial fansite of Mika Nakashima)\n\n“THE END” Lyric translations by Megchan."
