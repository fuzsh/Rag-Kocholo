        "text": "We know Texas & Arizona have hosted Super Bowls before but usually it's at the BIG football stadiums. You don't see college stadiums host Super Bowls but they have a few times. While most of these occasions happened in California (the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum & the Rose Bowl), there WERE 2 other times where a college stadium in Texas & Arizona have each hosted a Super Bowl.\n\nHouston, Texas was the home of Super Bowl VIII\n\nRice Stadium, located at Houston's Rice University, so far has hosted only one Super Bowl: 1974's Super Bowl VIII. 71,882 fans watched the Minnesota Vikings take on the Miami Dolphins, but in the end the Dolphins would win their 2nd (back-to-back) Super Bowl by beating the Vikings, 24-7. This would also be the first time a Texas musical artist would perform during the Halftime show (but it wouldn't be the last).\n\nDon't forget Super Bowl XXX in Tempe, Arizona\n\nThe home of the ASU Sun Devils, Mountain America Stadium (formerly called the Sun Devil Stadium), hosted Super Bowl XXX in 1996. The Pittsburgh Steelers took on the Dallas Cowboys, but it would be the Cowboys who would win their 5th Super Bowl, 27-17. At the moment, it's the last time a college stadium has hosted a Super Bowl game.\n\nIt's unlikely that we'll see another college stadium host a Super Bowl, but if they ever want to host in El Paso, that's fine with us! After all we do host the Sun Bowl game every year, AND we have one of the biggest stadiums in Texas. Just a thought..."
