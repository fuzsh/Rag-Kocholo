        "text": "Track Listing\n\nBack To You\n\nSleepless\n\nBack To You (English Version)\n\n1. Back To You\n\nWhen I heard this sort of sub-unit was made with Kun and Xiaojun, I kind of immediately knew they were going to be given ballads as the both of them are known for their vocals heavily and ballads seem to be their greatest strength. That said, SM ballads are really hard to get my head around with (with the exception of “From Home”). What I will say though is that the strings sound pretty here and both guys sound amazing as usual, but it’s the kind of sappy love song that I’m just not here for. Love the louder parts, a lot more vocal flair and power behind it, still I suppose it’s passable, ballad lovers might love it though.\n\n2. Sleepless\n\nI guess this would be considered a B-side (Korean singles are a little differently handled than the Japanese releases). I wasn’t expecting ANOTHER ballad to fill this release out and I’m kind of bummed because I would’ve dug hearing the two given something upbeat. This sounds more simplistic than “Back To You” though with most of the song under just piano before the bridge where strings finally show up. This is pretty too and also not my cup of tea but it’s here I suppose.\n\n3. Back To You (English Version)\n\nRounding out the release is an English version of the main track and I’m so surprised at how well both Kun and Xiaojun sing in English, it’s very easy to follow and there isn’t really any hiccups to be found and I can appreciate the song a little better, knowing more of its lyrical content. Still kind of a song not for me, but I do appreciate this more.\n\nAs WayV’s first “sub-unit”, I feel like this release is going to be forgotten shortly after this review primarily due to me not being someone terribly into ballads and these are rather cookie-cutter ballads we have here as per usual with SM. Kun and Xiaojun sound amazing, but that’s not even much of a surprise since they already show it off in WayV and NCT U. Random release and just ballad central, oh well…"
