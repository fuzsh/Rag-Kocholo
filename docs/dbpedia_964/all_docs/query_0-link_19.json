        "text": "Posted on Tuesday, April 23, 2024\n\nGlitter & Doom\n\nWe had such a wonderful time working with director Tom Gustafson and screenwriter Cory Krueckeberg in 2008 — when we released the soundtrack to their hit indie film musical Were the World Mine — that we were delighted when they invited us to collaborate with them on their newest project. Glitter & Doom is an amazing film. It’s joyous and inventive and moving, but for us, its accomplishments go way beyond what you see on the screen. By reintroducing the songs of Indigo Girls Amy Ray and Emily Saliers to a new audience and reimagining them with a more contemporary sound, it reminds us how and why great music endures. By placing Amy and Emily’s songs within a context of a film musical, and telling the story through their lyrics, it makes you see their work in ways you hadn’t before. And by forging a queer love story on the screen at a time when LGBTQ rights are in danger of being restricted and revoked, it makes a powerful and positive statement that never turns polemic. These are bold and brilliant achievements — and all of them lie quietly beneath the surface of this incredibly exuberant and upbeat film. It’s the sort of film that works on so many levels, it practically cries out for a soundtrack. We couldn’t be more thrilled to be a part of it. The soundtrack — 18 tracks, including one that Amy and Emily wrote and performed especially for the film, “What We Wanna Be” — is available at iTunes and on all streaming sites, and CDs can be ordered from Amazon. In addition, a limited number of CDs hand-signed by Indigo Girls Amy Ray and Emily Saliers are available. Reserve yours now.\n\nPosted on Monday, July 24, 2023\n\nA Collective Cy\n\nWe had such a wonderful time working with Jeff Harnar on his Sondheim opus I Know Things Now that we proposed another collaboration. Jeff suggested we take a look at a Cy Coleman celebration he had premiered in New York City back in 2006; he always dreamed of preserving it on disc. The show itself was marvelous, but, of course, it needed to be adapted for recording, and when we spoke with Jeff and his music director, Alex Rybeck, we were delighted to discover that we were all on the same page. We knew what needed to be trimmed and what needed to be added (we were thrilled when sisters Liz and Ann Hampton Callaway signed on for two duets) – and we all agreed that it needed to be fully scored for orchestra. The result is a bravura tribute to a composer equally at home in the worlds of pop and Broadway, in performances soaked in Harnar and Rybeck’s jazz-tinged theatricality. We are so proud to unveil this ideal pairing of artist and repertoire; the album drops on September 8, but it’s already available for preorder at Amazon — plus you can read more, see a track listing and listen to soundclips here.\n\nPosted on Friday, April 21, 2023\n\nMatthew Scott's The Jesus Year: A Letter From My Dad\n\nThe period of crisis and rebirth that can arrive at age 33 is often called the Jesus Year. For Matthew Scott‘s father, it manifested in a sinking feeling that he might not live to see his four young sons grow up. So he began writing them a letter — life lessons ranging from sex to communication to spirituality — that was found after his death, when Scott was only 13. For Scott, the letter became a cherished guide to growing up while he navigated intimate relationships, his professional career, his challenges with anxiety, and the early years of fatherhood to two sons of his own. In December 2021, Scott — who had by then taken Broadway by storm in a string of hits that included Sondheim on Sondheim, Jersey Boys and An American in Paris — wove his father‘s letter, anecdotes from his own life and a collection of classic pop and Broadway songs (from Paul McCartney and Billy Joel to William Finn and Stephen Sondheim) into a moving and rousing one-man show.\n\nPhilip and I first worked with Matt on the original Broadway cast recording of Sondheim on Sondheim. We were so enamored of his talent that we asked him to do several other studio-based recordings with us, including our Jerome Kern album The Land Where the Good Songs Go and our Noel and Cole. Back in 2019, Matt and I talked about working on his debut album; when I saw him perform The Jesus Year two years later, I told him this needed to be that album. As I always say, you only get one chance to make a first album — you only get one chance to make a “first impression“ — and the show is so moving, and his voice so stunning on this material, it quite takes your breath away. We’ve added instruments for the recording, but kept the intimacy and the sense of Matt sharing his story with the audience, in this case the listener; our goal was to create something just as affecting as the live show, but more richly textured. This is the kind of show that not merely draws crowds but makes them cry: exactly the kind of emotional journey Philip and I are most attracted to.\n\n— Tommy Krasker, October 2022\n\nPosted on Friday, October 21, 2022\n\nDecember Songs for Voice and Orchestra\n\nHaving known Maury Yeston since 1977, and having worked with him on several productions, I’ve often had the good fortune of hearing his theatrical scores as they were being written. He called me on the phone and played me songs from Grand Hotel as he was writing them in Boston. I was there as his Phantom took shape. And I remember so clearly when he sent me his December Songsin 1991, well before it had received its first performance. I was instantly taken with its story of a woman coming to terms with a failed relationship and gaining the strength and wisdom to move on. I myself was going through a bad break-up at the time — the kind that often precedes one finding one’s true love — and I said to Maury when I had finished listening, “You just saved me thousands of dollars in psychotherapy.“\n\nI was smitten with the work, and was thrilled to see this song cycle designed for voice and piano not only embraced by critics and audiences, but performed throughout the world. But from knowing Maury, I knew that his great dream was to see it enlarged to symphonic proportions. Maury and I started to toss around that idea a few years ago, and brainstorm artists who could both soar above a 37-piece orchestra yet retain all of the subtleties and nuances of the piece. Someone who could triumphantly make it their own. When we thought of Vicki Clark, we knew we had the answer. There are few artists who so devote themselves to a work, who pour every ounce of talent and emotion they have into a piece — and watching her tackle the song cycle over a four month rehearsal period and then commit to it so forcefully in the studio was one of the most thrilling experiences of my life.\n\nAs Vicki herself noted, following the recording dates,“As I studied and worked, the songs began to take on a momentum of their own, guiding and teaching me about my own life— moments I had overlooked or forgotten, powerful or painful or triumphant turning points that I had brushed aside or pushed down, and it seemed that my whole life came rushing back to me like leaves falling all around me on a blustery day. For me December Songs is about grace, acceptance and ultimately forgiveness, as a woman in the winter of her journey puts the pieces of her life back together again and finds joy and relief once more in this moment. There is no question that recording this album was one of the greatest gifts of my professional life.” Philip and I are so proud to unveil December Songs for Voice and Orchestra.\n\n— Tommy Krasker, April 2023\n\nPosted on Thursday, April 21, 2022\n\nI Know Things Now\n\nAs we noted earlier this year, we were honored to be Steve Sondheim’s label of choice from 2004 to 2013, turning out a dozen cast albums during that time, plus two editions of Sondheim Sings. Eventually, we stopped doing his cast albums only because we’d be repeating ourselves: we already had a Sunday in the Park; we already had a Follies and a Company. Were there any new Sondheim roads we hadn’t already taken? Sondheim-related projects came our way, but we turned them down; we knew that whatever followed the expansive catalog we’d been permitted to preserve on disc had to be special.\n\nI Know Things Now is special. Jeff Harnar stepped back and looking at the entirety of the Sondheim catalog, chose more than 25 songs, and reimagined them as a cohesive narrative — as he put it, his life in Sondheim’s words: ultimately reinventing these songs for the LGBTQ community. And in collaboration with famed pianist Jon Weber, he recast them in a jazz idiom: a radical reinvention of Sondheim’s harmonies that Sondheim himself not only endorsed but encouraged. The result was an acclaimed stage show, and now we’ve been allowed to adapt and enlarge it for disc, adding a 20-piece orchestra that sweetens the sound and shakes the rafters. Jeff put his faith in the master’s directive: “Anything you do, let it come from you. Then it will be new.” Steve was so pleased with the results; we think you will be too. The album drops on June 17, but it’s already available for preorder at Amazon — plus you can read more, see a track listing and listen to soundclips here.\n\nPosted on Friday, January 28, 2022\n\nMatteo\n\nWhen Matteo Ferrari came to us with a request to take on the US and Canadian distribution of his debut album, Maramao – and sent along a set of MP3s – we were instantly intrigued by what we heard. His warm, smooth voice was ready-made for the mic – but it was also clear that he was bringing his formidable acting skills to bear on every syllable he sang. We were enchanted when we first gave a listen, even though neither of us speaks a word of Italian. I suspect we would’ve happily released the album based on Matteo’s talents alone, but once we learned more about the impulse of the album, we knew it was for us.\n\nMaramao is a collection of canzonette, songs composed between 1915 and 1945, during a particularly dark and challenging time in Italy’s history. They were designed to cheer people up, to bring them a sense of optimism in the face of oppression, and to that end, they borrowed heavily from the sounds of jazz that America was popularizing at the time.\n\nWhen we first began PS Classics, one of our colleagues coined the tagline “celebrating the heritage of American popular song” as a way of defining our brand and goals. And the truth of it is, of course, that the heritage of America popular song extends far beyond our own borders. American popular song – and the sense of optimism infused within it – became a global phenomenon, and ultimately altered the course of world music. In terms of our label’s output, Maramao is perhaps a companion piece to Jessica Molaskey’s debut album, Pentimento, which showed how popular song sought to elevate spirits during the Depression. It fits firmly, too, within our personal aesthetic. We’ve always admired artists most who make a singular statement with their albums: who intuitively interpret the music in a way that only they could. It’s how Maureen McGovern, Cheyenne Jackson and Liz & Ann Hampton Callaway can all take a look back at the sounds of the ’60s – in A Long and Winding Road, Renaissance and Boom!, respectively – and emerge with such vibrantly different discs. The albums aren’t just about the songs, but how the artist perceives the songs. And Maramao is a beautiful example of that. When we first listened to the album, the song selection, arrangements and performances seemed like an outgrowth of Matteo’s tastes, temperament and passions. We felt we were truly getting to know him, even though he was some 6000 miles away. We’re delighted to pass along that introduction to you here.\n\n– Tommy Krasker & Philip Chaffin\n\nPosted on Saturday, November 27, 2021\n\nStephen Sondheim (1930-2021)\n\nBetween 2000 and 2013, I had the honor of producing 14 cast albums for Steve. After every album was put to bed, he’d phone me to thank me. I was humbled to be working with a legend — one I had revered since I was a teenager — and here he was thanking me. I was awed by Steve’s genius, but it was his kindness that overwhelmed me.\n\nSince news came yesterday of his passing, many folks have asked for my favorite Sondheim memory. Nothing grandiose comes to mind; instead, it’s — as the man himself wrote — the little things. Hundreds of them. It’s how, every time he gave me notes on an album, he would finish with, “And that concludes my entire performance — in French,” channeling Zan Charisse in Gypsy. It’s the time Philip and I were vacationing in the Adirondacks, and when we came back, Steve had left a message on our answering machine telling me how thrilled he was with the Sweeney Todd album — two minutes of praise, after which I said to Philip, “We must never tape over this.” It’s how, when I was having a bad health spell in 2012 and was bedridden for several months, he sent me lists of old movies I should watch, and after I watched each one, we would compare notes. (I remember one of his all-time favorites was The Hard Way with Ida Lupino, and after I saw it, I understood why.) It’s how he arrived at the sessions for Follies, sat down, and the first words out of his mouth were, “Is Czerny here?” (He loved playing with our miniature schnauzer during the breaks. And if Jeff was there, they would both take delight in playing with him.)\n\nSince yesterday, folks have been recounting Sondheim lyrics galore. Often the expected ones, but no less resonant for being so expected: e.g., “Sometimes people leave you halfway through the wood.” I’m too numb right now to think of a proper lyric to honor his passing. The oddest one keeps coming to mind – but if I had to say something back to Steve right now in his own language, it would merely be, “You’re lovely. Absolutely lovely. Who’d believe the loveliness of you?“ No one that brilliant had to be that kind, and generous, and thoughtful, and compassionate. Steve was.\n\nRIP, old friend\n\n— Tommy Krasker\n\nPosted on Wednesday, December 23, 2020\n\nRebecca Luker (1961-2020)\n\nWe don’t have the proper words to express our sorrow over the passing of our dear friend Rebecca Luker.

In 2003, just three years after we started this label, she came to us with a new solo album that she wanted us to have, and from that point on, she entrusted us with all her recordings. And we were forever asking her to star on various studio albums and songbooks that we were releasing, because there was no one we enjoyed working with more. It wasn’t just the voice, which of course was unmatched: it was her passion and dedication and fierce intelligence.

The two had worked for years perfecting a show that celebrated women in all of our messy wonderfulness, as they put it, and the resulting evening was powerful and passionate and deeply moving  everything we most gravitate and respond to here at PS Classics. And we must admit, too, that there are few artists we enjoy working with as much in the studio as Rebecca and Sally. Every experience with them has been a joy, and the last time we had both of them in the studio, for our cast recording of Sweet Little Devil, it was one of the highlights of our 20 years running this label. Their amazing music director Joe Thalken graciously agreed to expand the ensemble from 4 to 10 for the album, and did so with grace and brilliance, and were so delighted to be unveiling the results for you. All the Girls will be available at digital and streaming sites on Christmas Day, with a hard-goods release to follow. In the meantime you can read more, see the track listing and hear soundclips here. Posted on Friday, October 16, 2020\n\na new Rebecca Luker track\n\nWhen we recorded Rebecca Lukers Jerome Kern album in 2013, we added one song not in her stage show: a duet with Matt Scott to The Enchanted Train, a Kern and P.G. Wodehouse song that Tommy had always loved. Becca and Matt were magical, but as we mixed down the album, we realize that the rest of it was so personal and introspective that this joyous song just didnt fit. It got left on the cutting room floor. But this past summer we all found ourselves thinking about it. Tommy realized it needed more of a chart than just the piano and bass that had accompanied the original album, and music director Joe Thalken graciously orchestrated it for eight players, who recorded it in their private studios. Our genius engineer Bart mixed it all down, and were so thrilled to unveil the results for you here: Rebecca Luker and Matthew Scott dueting to Jerome Kern and P.G. Wodehouses The Enchanted Train. As the song title implies, its three-and-a-half minutes of pure enchantment. This track is now available where you purchase and stream music.\n\nPosted on Thursday, October 8, 2020\n\nMaury Sings Yeston\n\nOur friend Maury Yeston turns 75 on October 23. We’ve had the great pleasure, since 2003, of recording numerous Yeston cast albums, songbooks, and classical discs. (PS Classics cofounder Tommy Krasker has actually been working on and off with Maury for over 40 years, including a stint as vocal director on the original Broadway production of Nine.) We wanted to do something special to celebrate Maury’s milestone, and Tommy, who has been among the first to hear all of Maury’s glorious songs as he’s composed them, suggested a two-disc set of Maury’s demos, of him performing his own material, spanning some 40 years. Maury’s demos aren’t like those of most composers: he typically recorded them in a studio, and often layered multiple voices, to showcase his rich harmonies and contrapuntal writing. And as anyone who knows Maury will attest to, his enthusiasm as he demonstrates his own material is boundless. He is a born performer. Maury Sings Yeston will be available for downloading and streaming on Maury’s 75th birthday, October 23, with a hard-good release to follow seven weeks later. Join us for the celebration!\n\nPosted on Monday, December 23, 2019\n\nSay Yeston\n\nPS Classics co-founder Tommy Krasker first met composer-lyricist Maury Yeston when Tommy was a college student and Maury was the head of the music department. Upon Tommy’s graduation, Maury gave him his first professional job in New York City, when he hired him as rehearsal pianist on the original workshop (and ensuing Broadway production) of Nine.\n\nIn the decades that followed, Tommy would badger Maury: “There really should be a songbook album of your work, and a great Maury Yeston revue.” When we founded PS Classics in 2000, the songbook album was one of our first priorities; the resulting Maury Yeston Songbook remains one of our proudest achievements. But it took another dozen years before a Yeston revue emerged. Last month, The York Theatre premiered ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE THEATE: The Musical World of Maury Yeston, the first New York revue of Maury’s material.\n\nThe York production features five fabulous singers, to piano accompaniment; we wanted to up the orchestral forces, so we engaged three-time Tony Award-winner Doug Besterman to score the work specifically for the cast album — and today we are in the studio with cast and musicians recording the new Maury Yeston revue. It features several of Yeston’s best-known songs, surrounded by a host of little-known gems, most of them receiving their first recording here.\n\nWe’re looking to a street date of April 3, and just as soon as we have soundclips and preorder links ready, we’ll be providing them.\n\nPosted on Wednesday, November 21, 2018\n\nWill They Like Him? Yes.\n\nWe've rarely had a solo album garner as much instant reaction as label co-founder Philip Chaffin's Will He Like Me?, which dropped a week ago Friday. We're sure a lot of that is due to the very impulse of the album – reimagining the Great American Songbook for the post-marriage-equality era, using 17 classic songs to tell a gay man's love story – but from mainstream publications to theatre-centric sites, from LGBTQ online mags to personal blogs, folks have been hailing the concept and praising the execution. And since it's an album that we poured our hearts into – not to mention our first new release in two years – that's been enormously gratifying.\n\nThe New York Times featured the album in its 2018 Holiday Gift Guide (the first solo album on our label to make the Gift Guide), raving, \"From 'When I Marry Mr. Snow' to 'I Got Lost in His Arms,' Chaffin tells a familiar story that has never sounded so new.\" At Talkin' Broadway, Rob Lester wrote an expansive piece, noting, \"Chaffin's versatility is shown to good advantage, with faces of love that let him show the rush of romance, a little sass with a wink, and mood from delight and devastation. While the LGBT perspective is prominent, it's the dynamic and vibrant singing, thoughtful interpretations, and consistently winning instrumental settings that make the whole package so very rewarding and engaging.\"\n\nAt Gay Boy Bible, Rev Nathan hailed, \"Unabashed, confident and relatable, Chaffin chooses songs that bring to mind an honest picture of gay men in love. The giddy first feelings; the minor (or maybe major!) irritations that getting to know someone bring out; the hard-won steadfast love that grows from fully sharing a life together; and finally the inevitable high price anyone pays for having a genuine and mortal love. Chaffin's vocals are golden.\" And at Another Damn Blog, Jamie Bowden-Smith predicted the album would bring \"delight to a gay male audience who, just once, would like a gay romantic song that wasn't all heartbreak and despair. My husband, who long ago gave up seeking anything useful from mainstream artists that would speak to him personally, was enraptured by this album. It worked for him. He was delighted by it. And not just for 'gay rights' reasons – he specifically noted that Philip was one of the best singers he'd heard in years and that the album would've worked for him even if the roles were reversed and it was Philip singing about a woman.\"\n\nBut perhaps nothing pleased and touched us more than an email we received from a gay couple, Chuck and Bob, who'll be celebrating their 56th year together in December. They wrote that they've \"been waiting a very long time for a CD like Will He Like Me? to arrive. In a complicated (or maybe simple) way, it's our story too.\" It's all of ours – gay and straight. That's the beauty of the Great American Songbook, of course: that the emotions and situations described are universal. We're so proud to be reinventing the songs and stories of a previous era for the lovers of a new one.\n\nPosted on Thursday, October 18, 2018\n\nSomething for the Boys\n\nBecause Tommy got his start in the record business producing studio cast albums of old Gershwin shows, one of our goals -- when we started PS Classics -- was to record vintage musicals that predated the advent of the OCR. Since 2013, we've been working on our most ambitious restoration and studio cast recording yet, but it had to take a back seat to Tommy's health issues for a while. But now we're ready to kick it into high gear once again, and announce our new 2018 Studio Cast Recording of Cole Porter's 1943 smash Something for the Boys. It's one of the most forgotten Porter shows -- it premiered during the famed musicians' union strike of the early '40s, and none of its songs had the chance to become hits. But it's heavenly: Porter's love letter to the big-band era that had taken the country by storm. It swings like no other Porter score, and our time in the studio, recording these original charts with 26 musicians and a cast of Broadway pros, has been marvelous fun. Coming December 7, but you can read more and preorder here. Soundclips will be up in about a week, and we think they'll blow you away.\n\nPosted on Thursday, October 18, 2018\n\nSomething for the Boys\n\nBecause Tommy got his start in the record business producing studio cast albums of old Gershwin shows, one of our goals -- when we started PS Classics -- was to record vintage musicals that predated the advent of the OCR.

So when she came to us this past summer with an album she had just recorded -- a celebration of the great French singer Édith Piaf: a perfect pairing of singer and subject matter -- we jumped at the chance to help her bring it to completion and release it. Christine has been reinterpreting and embodying Piaf for some time, most notably in a one-woman show she's performed in venues from London to San Francisco. Now, she's taken that show, Piaf: No Regrets, into a London studio with a 32-piece orchestra, and the results are stunning. Singing a wide range of signature tunes in both French and English, Christine explores the singer's life and art in a way it has not been heard before. Piaf voiced a truth-telling in song that electrified first a nation, then the world. In Piaf: No Regrets, Christine Andreas uses her own extraordinary voice to celebrate Piaf's joys, pains and one-of-a-kind artistry.

(a love story)\n\nWe mentioned in a note this summer that we'd gotten back to thinking about new projects, after taking time off to deal with Tommy's health issues. Actually, we'd gotten a bit further than that. We've been working on Philip's next solo album since 2013, and this past summer, we went into Power Station and recorded it, with some of our favorite musicians. It's easily one of the most personal works we've ever released – in some ways, it's the culmination of everything we've tried to do with PS Classics. It's a song-cycle that uses 100 years of American popular song to reinvent the Great American Songbook for LGBTQ audiences. It's a gay man's love story, told through 17 classic songs, and it encompasses 35 years of his life, from first date to final goodbye. We imagine the album will have particular appeal to the LGBTQ community, but we hope its themes -- love and loss, hope and heartbreak -- will resonate with everyone. After all, that's the glory of the Great American Songbook: that the emotions expressed are universal.\n\nThe album goes on sale November 9, and you can read more and preorder here. (It's currently available for preorder at Amazon; it should up for preorder at iTunes within two weeks.) We hope you'll give it a try, and when you do receive your copy, that you'll listen straight through, as it's designed to be enjoyed as much like a cast recording as a solo disc. We're extraordinarily proud of this album; we're delighted to be back up and running, and we look forward to unveiling more projects in the weeks ahead.\n\nPosted on Tuesday, May 22, 2018\n\nrest cures, religion and pills\n\nIt's been over a year since Philip posted here about my health issues, and the label taking a hiatus while we attempted to get them under control. Since that post went up, I've been flooded with kind notes of encouragement and concern, and although I haven't had the strength to respond to each and every one, please know how much I've appreciated them. Many folks who wrote admitted they didn't know much about autoimmune illness, and I thought it wouldn't be bad to say a few words here. Typically, of course, your immune system protects you from disease and infection. But if you have an autoimmune illness -- and there are more than 50 million people in the U.S. alone who do -- your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. In my case, it attacks my muscles and joints, and produces widespread pain. There's no \"cure,\" but it is possible to slow the decline, and that's what the last 18 months have been about.\n\nBack in 2013, my doctor told me I needed to slow down. He cautioned me to avoid stress, and although producing cast album dates -- getting a whole show in the can in one day, and doing it efficiently, and doing it well -- is the most stressful job I've ever had, I didn't listen. I loved making albums too much. And I was getting away with it until the spring of 2015, when a half-dozen projects coincided: recordings I cared so passionately about, I wasn't going to turn them down. But they did me in, and I was in bed for months after. Finally, in the fall of 2016, Philip and I had to accept that changes were overdue. We moved home and office to south Florida, where the temps are kinder and the climate less stressful. And we decided to take time off to focus on my health. All in all, the move has been enormously helpful.\n\nAs a result, and to our delight, we've started to consider new projects. We're proceeding slowly, to ensure that I don't fall back into old, bad habits -- and although we're not yet ready to announce anything, I just wanted to pen this update, to assure folks that PS Classics is still very much active and around -- and that I am, too. We look forward to unveiling some new offerings that we hope will stack up with the best of our catalog. Till then, we thank you for your continued support, and as for me, I'm so grateful for the kindness and encouragement I've received. It's meant the world to me.\n\n- Tommy Krasker, May 2018\n\nPosted on Saturday, January 28, 2017\n\nmy husband spins fantasies\n\nIn November 2000, we started PS Classics. Tommy had been working as a freelance record producer (for Audra McDonald and Dawn Upshaw, among others) since 1989. I'd been working as a professional actor since 1988. We met in 1993, and it was love at first sight. In the late '90s, we thought it would be fun to finally work together, and collaborated on my first solo disc; when the resulting album, Where Do I Go From You?, was completed, we decided to release it ourselves, and created the label \"PS Classics\" in order to peddle it to retailers. We had no plans to take the label any further. But artists who knew us, and knew our work, brought us albums -- and ideas for albums -- and dreams of albums -- and now, it's seventeen years, nine Grammy nominations, and nearly a hundred discs later. It's been an amazing journey.\n\nAs many know, Tommy's been dealing with illness since 2006: an auto-immune disease in the same family as Lupus. It's been an extraordinary challenge for him; since then, he's had to do many recording dates while in awful pain, propped up by medication and will-power. Ironically, because he was forced to dig deeper to power through, because he never knew which project might be his last, he produced what I think are some of his most heartfelt and personal albums, including Follies, Death Takes a Holiday, Yank! and Fun Home. Tommy's kept working since 2006, because nothing has been more restorative than getting to collaborate with these amazing artists, on such glorious material -- but now we need to take some time to focus on his health. PS Classics isn't going anywhere, but for a time, we won't be releasing anything new; we'll simply continue highlighting -- and celebrating -- the many wonderful artists who've come our way, and the phenomenal CDs it's been our honor to release. We have a few upcoming albums planned, but for right now, they're taking a back seat to getting Tommy back on his feet. We thank you, our generous and loyal customers, for joining us on this incredible ride. Without you, without your support, we never would have dared dream so high, or ultimately, accomplish so much. We're so grateful to you all; we shall miss the emails and tweets and posts, but we look forward to seeing you back here when the time is right.\n\n- Philip Chaffin, January 2017\n\nPosted on Tuesday, May 10, 2016\n\nbig apple\n\nCity Center Encores! has just announced that The Golden Apple will highlight their 2017 season. We'd like to think that our two-disc recording (featuring nearly 90 minutes of previously unrecorded music) had something to do with it - as it's been so rapturously received. Opera News called it one of the year's top-10 discs, while NPR hailed as \"game-changing.\" Playbill proclaimed, \"How often are we treated to a cast recording that is layered with such complexity and fullness of sound from the orchestra while a legion of voices come together to create sparkling and heavenly harmonies? A breathtaking bijou among the most celebrated gems of cast recordings.\" The Stamford Times tagged it as \"a must for anyone who cares about the musical theatre,\" while across the country, the critic for The Bay Area Reporter, admitting it was \"a recording I've been waiting for all my life,\" cheered, \"We can now hear it in its full, adventurous, and rather fantastic form.\" And Fanfare Magazine raved: \"It sports some of the best engineering I've heard from an opera - and wonder of wonders, it was recorded live. The greatest American opera ever written. Well done!\" Order your copy today...\n\nPosted on Thursday, April 28, 2016\n\nrelative pitch\n\nWe last worked with composer-lyricist Neil Bartram and bookwriter Brian Hill on The Story of My Life, which was a joy to preserve on disc. Last spring, we saw their latest musical, THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY, at Goodspeed, where it played to packed houses and standing ovations, and we knew instantly that we wanted to record it. As with Story of My Life, we respond not just favorably, but viscerally, to Neil and Brian's work, and Neil's songs in Theory -- although they're inspired and performed by young adults -- speak to us every bit as much as the songs from Story. And what's more, they sound just like Neil; his musical voice comes through so clearly, the mark of any great songwriter. We're proud to be part of the Relativity family, and with Music Theatre International now licensing the show, we predict it'll have a long and happy life.

His album is quite the find, too.\" You can read the full review here and order your copy here.\n\nPosted on Tuesday, March 8, 2015\n\nrenaissance man\n\nWe last worked with the amazing Cheyenne Jackson on Finian's Rainbow, and had spoken about collaborating again, but nothing came of it -- until last fall. Cheyenne had been touring with his one-man show, Songs of the Mad Men Era, with pops orchestras across the country; the music had become part of his blood, and he very much wanted the evening preserved on disc -- and thought of us. We heard the material, and jumped at the chance. It's spectacular. It harkens back to a dual high point in music history: the end of Hollywood's Golden Age, only sexier, and the start of the great era of Las Vegas entertainment, only classier. It's a remarkable synthesis, on which Cheyenne sings up a storm. We'll be in the studio this week with a full orchestra, under the baton of our pal Kevin Stites, recording Cheyenne's new solo disc, newly christened RENAISSANCE. Street date is June 3rd; preorder now!\n\nPosted on Monday, December 7, 2015\n\ngrateful\n\nThank you all who've congratulated us on our Grammy nomination for FUN HOME in the category of Best Musical Theater Album. The Grammy nominations are always so wildly unpredictable, and we had no idea which -- if any -- of our 2015 releases might receive a nod. FUN HOME was among our most rewarding albums ever, so it's extremely gratifying that the Recording Academy chose to recognize it. Congratulations, too, to our nominated colleagues at other labels: Rob Fisher and Scott Lehrer at Masterworks Broadway, for An American in Paris; Alex Lacamoire, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Bill Sherman, Ahmir Thompson and Tarik Trotter at Atlantic, for Hamilton; David Caddick, David Lai and Ted Sperling, at Universal Music Classics, for The King & I; and Kurt Deutsch, Karey Kirkpatrick, Wayne Kirkpatrick, Lawrence Manchester, Kevin McCollum and Phil Reno at Ghostlight for Something Rotten! We're honored to be in such good company.\n\nPosted on Monday, November 30, 2015\n\nnew york, new york\n\nOur ON THE TOWN cast recording was featured in The New York Times' Holiday Gift Guide. \"For Bernstein-lovers, here is an essentially complete On the Town, with all the songs, dance sequences and orchestral underwriting included. Bernstein wove whiffs of bitonality and hints of Copland into this ambitious score, along with those wonderful songs,\" raved Anthony Tommasini. \"For this essential cast recording, the conductor James Moore draws stylish playing from an excellent orchestra.\"\n\nPosted on Monday, October 19, 2015\n\ntime and music\n\nThis past summer, we saw the Encores! Off-Center production of William Finn and James Lapine's A NEW BRAIN, starring Broadway, film and television star Jonathan Groff, along with Christian Borle, Ana Gasteyer and Aaron Lazar – all of them magnificent. New York magazine called the production a \"miracle\" and \"revelatory,\" noting that Finn and Lapine's rewrites, as performed by this cast, at this particular time in history, made the show seem somehow more moving and invigorating than ever before – and we agreed. Jonathan Groff's lead performance was a one-of-a-kind mating of actor and role; as the New York Daily News raved, \"Playing a composer determined to make his mark, the star leaves yet another one.\" It demanded to be seen – and if not seen, then heard. Today and tomorrow, we are recording the 95-minute, through-composed show in its entirety for the first time, and packaging it in a deluxe two-disc set. Pre-order your copy today...\n\nPosted on Thursday, October 15, 2015\n\nGolden reviews\n\nThe internet and newsstands have been flooded with reviews for our deluxe two-disc cast recording of THE GOLDEN APPLE, which NPR hailed as \"game-changing.\" Playbill proclaimed, \"It bursts with energy like it never did before. How often are we treated to a cast recording that is layered with such complexity and fullness of sound from the orchestra while a legion of voices come together to create sparkling and heavenly harmonies? A breathtaking bijou among the most celebrated gems of cast recordings.\" The Stamford Times tagged it as \"a must for anyone who cares about the musical theatre,\" while across the country, the critic for The Bay Area Reporter, admitting it was \"a recording I've been waiting for all my life,\" cheered, \"We can now hear it in its full, adventurous, and rather fantastic form.\" CastAlbums.org raved, \"The album has the vibrancy of a live performance with studio-quality sound. The score offers delights for all kinds of show music fans. Most of us never expected to hear a full recording of this score with a cast and orchestra of this size and quality, and to have it delivered with such finesse is nothing short of a miracle\" -- and Fanfare Magazine concurred: \"It sports some of the best engineering I've heard from an opera - and wonder of wonders, it was recorded live. The greatest American opera ever written. Well done!\" Order your copy today...\n\nPosted on Tuesday, April 14, 2015\n\nAlison\n\nWe were in the studio this past Friday with the cast of FUN HOME: updating and expanding our original recording -- not just with new material that Jeanine Tesori and Lisa Kron wrote for the Broadway production, but also with musical passages we didn't record last time around that, in hindsight, we very much wanted on the album. It also gave us the opportunity to work with the wonderful Emily Skeggs, who assumed the role of Medium Alison off-Broadway and is taking it uptown. FUN HOME, newly packaged, will be in stores May 19, and shipping from our website two weeks prior. For those wondering, as customers did with Grey Gardens, if it's worth buying the second album if you already own the first: well, we can report that over half the tracks will be new. For us, it wasn't just about \"let's add the new material\" -- it was about doing justice to this exhilarating and moving production. Pre-order now!\n\nPosted on Wednesday, March 25, 2015\n\nLily\n\nWe had a marvelous time in the studio on Monday with the cast and orchestra of ON THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. Later this week, we'll be adding a TWENTIETH CENTURY page to our site, complete with cover art, product description and a very expansive track listing, but in the meantime, you can click here to pre-order. We'll begin shipping on May 5, two weeks ahead of street date.\n\nPosted on Friday, March 13, 2015\n\nTony\n\nSometimes we meet a performer and realize instantly that we share a common outlook and work ethic. We worked with Tony Yazbeck for the first time on ON THE TOWN and felt very much in sync, so we were delighted when Tony reached out to us recently about joining him on another project. Tony is performing his one-man show, THE FLOOR ABOVE ME, this month at 54 Below. Later this spring, we'll be going into a New York studio and adapting the show for disc: preserving its core — in which Tony fuses song, dance and personal anecdotes into a moving autobiographical narrative — while augmenting the songlist and instrumental colors a bit, and allowing for the kind of sound that only a studio album can provide. We're delighted to be working with Tony again so soon, and doubly pleased to be working on an album that's so exciting and so novel. You can read more and pre-order here.\n\nPosted on Wednesday, March 4, 2015\n\nNicholas\n\nPeople often write us asking if we accept submissions, and even when we tell them to go ahead and send us a bio, or a link, or a disc, we caution them that our recording schedule is solidified months in advance, that we're usually drowning in paperwork, and that it might be a while before we can get back to them. But actor-singer Nicholas Rodriguez wrote us last August, introduced himself, and sent a few links of him singing -- and we knew then and there that we wanted to be involved in his first solo disc. He has one of those voices that the microphone loves, the ability to interpret a lyric with ease, and a comfort embracing a broad range of musical styles -- just what we look for when welcoming new artists. We're in the studio the next two days recording Nicholas's debut solo album. You can read more and pre-order here.\n\nPosted on Friday, February 20, 2015\n\nHelen\n\nBack in 1994, Tommy made the rounds of all the labels in town, trying to get them to undertake a studio cast recording of Jerome Moross and John Latouche's 1954 classic THE GOLDEN APPLE. No one bit. If you don't know GOLDEN APPLE, you sure as heck should, because it's glorious: the first off-Broadway musical to receive the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Musical. Sadly, this 135-minute through-sung musical, which transplants parts of the Iliad and the Odyssey to turn-of-the-century Washington State, was preserved only in a 48-minute original cast LP, and that's all most folks have ever heard. But this past fall, Lyric Stage of Irving, TX, mounted a fully-staged production, with a cast of 43 and an orchestra of 38. Moross's daughter, Susanna Tarjan, alerted us that the production was magnificent, and when we heard just how magnificent it was, we committed to a recording. We recorded the last four performances, and this spring, we'll unveil the first full-length recording of THE GOLDEN APPLE, one of the masterpieces of the American musical theatre. Pre-order our double-disc set now!\n\nPosted on Monday, February 16, 2015\n\nIvy\n\nSoundclips are now up for our upcoming two-disc New Broadway Cast Recording of ON THE TOWN. We'll be shipping product on or before March 3 (just as soon as we get our hands on it, we promise), so if you haven't done so yet, pre-order now! Digital sales (iTunes, etc.) will also begin March 3, with hard-good retailers to follow two weeks later.\n\nPosted on Monday, February 2, 2015\n\nMisia\n\nVernon Duke has long been one of Tommy's favorite theatre composers. In the late '90s, while freelancing for Nonesuch Records, he proposed and ultimately produced an album of soprano Dawn Upshaw singing Duke; over a decade later, he restored and recorded one of our most acclaimed studio cast albums, Duke's forgotten 1946 musical SWEET BYE AND BYE. So it was with particular delight last fall that he received an invitation from Duke's widow, Kay Duke Ingalls, to produce a studio cast recording of a new musical featuring over two dozen previously-unheard Duke melodies. With book and lyrics by journalist and author Barry Singer, to melodies unearthed and arranged by Duke scholar Scott Dunn, this new musical, MISIA, celebrates the life of the legendary muse and patroness of fin de siecle Paris, whose coterie included Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, Proust, Chanel and Diaghilev. We've assembled one of the most stunning casts ever to grace one of our studio cast recordings, headed by Marin Mazzie in the title role, and we'll be recording MISIA, to all-new orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick, next month. We're awfully proud to usher in 2015 with one of the most fascinating and exciting projects we've ever taken on; pre-order now!\n\nPosted on Tuesday, January 30, 2015\n\n2014 round up\n\nFor the first time since we started PS Classics, one of our CDs was spotlighted in The New York Times' Holiday Gift Guide. \"Standing tall among the standout performances on Broadway last season was Sutton Foster's stirring turn as the title character in the revival of the Jeanine Tesori and Brian Crawley musical, VIOLET,\" raved Charles Isherwood. \"Ms. Foster's performance, and the superb gospel-and-country-inflected score, have been preserved on a lush two-disc set, allowing the full scope of the musical to be preserved for the first time.\"\n\nWe released four cast albums last year, and Playbill.com singled out all of them at year's end. Steven Suskin chose FUN HOME, Violet and YANK! for his Holiday Gift Guide, while a separate list of Playbill's Best Cast Albums of 2014 honored Fun Home, LADY DAY AT EMERSON'S BAR & GRILL and Violet. Over at Talkin' Broadway, Rob Lester named Fun Home and Yank! among the year's top albums, hailing Fun Home as \"brave and powerful, heartbreaking and occasionally hilarious\" and labeling Yank! \"a winning musical of the first rank.\"\n\nWe're very proud of the albums we released in 2014 and are looking forward to announcing several exciting new releases in the weeks ahead -- starting with MISIA!\n\nPosted on Tuesday, July, 15 2014\n\ndeep song\n\n\"It would have been enough,\" wrote New York Magazine in the first review of our Original Broadway Cast Recording of LADY DAY AT EMERSON'S BAR & GRILL, \"to record for history Audra McDonald’s profane, repellent, hilarious, heartbreaking (and Tony-winning) inhabitation of Billie Holiday. But this 85-minute, two-disc live rendition of the event -- from preshow cocktail music to closing ovations -- in many ways improves on the stage experience, as everything extraneous to the central performance melts into audience hum. In a great season for cast recordings, this is surely the greatest\". Entertainment Weekly echoed, \"It’s the performance everyone’s been talking about: six-time Tony winner Audra McDonald's latest star turn, playing troubled blues singer Billie Holiday in the final months of her life. It’s a fully transportative experience for the audience, whose reactions help create the illusion carried by McDonald’s performance. To reflect that experience, LADY DAY was recorded live during performances of the show in late May. The two-disc set offers an immersive translation of the show, a feat not reflected in several of this season’s recent cast albums.\" LADY DAY hits stores today; don't miss it!\n\nPosted on Thursday, May 29, 2014\n\nLady Day\n\nIf you haven't yet seen Audra McDonald's mesmerizing, Tony-nominated performance as Billie Holiday in the Broadway production of LADY DAY AT EMERSON'S BAR & GRILL, then you've missed out on what New York Magazine called \"one of the greatest performances I ever hope to see\" and what the Huffington Post hailed as \"stunning and heartbreaking... the performance of her career.\" In case you won't be able to get into NYC before the show concludes its limited run, or in case you've already enjoyed \"the best 90 minutes you'll ever witness\" (NY1) and want to experience it all again, we'll be at Circle in the Square this week, recording the full show live. The street date for our Original Broadway Cast Recording of LADY DAY AT EMERSON'S BAR & GRILL is July 15, but as always, folks who order directly from us will receive their discs first. Not to be missed!\n\nPosted on Tuesday, May 6, 2014\n\nWon't they be surprised?\n\nWe committed to recording VIOLET a week before the show even started previews -- that's how bowled over we were by the final runthrough -- and happily, weeks later, once the show opened, it turned out the critics and awards committees shared our enthusiasm. VIOLET was an absolute pleasure to record -- the cast was in great voice and full of high spirits -- and we finished post-production ahead of schedule. Our two-disc Original Broadway Cast Recording of VIOLET hits stores on June 3 (it's hard to move up a retail release date, even when you find yourself ahead of schedule), but it will be available at iTunes, along with a full digital booklet, on May 20. Also, as a nice surprise to our web customers, we're beginning to ship today from our website, a full four weeks ahead of street date. Some of our customers have been ordering direct from us since our very first release; we're always happy when we can ship out our web orders nice and early. And while you're waiting for your order to arrive, we've posted no less than ten soundclips. Enjoy!\n\nPosted on Monday, March 10, 2014\n\ncome to the Fun Home ... instore\n\nOur Original Cast Recording of FUN HOME soared to #2 on the Billboard Top Cast Album chart in its first week of release, by far our best first week ever for an off-Broadway show. This coming Thursday, March 13th, at 6 PM, authors Jeanine Tesori and Lisa Kron will be joined by the entire original cast -- Griffin Birney, Michael Cerveris, Roberta Colindrez, Noah Hinsdale, Judy Kuhn, Sydney Lucas, Beth Malone, Joel Perez and Alexandra Socha -- at a CD performance and signing at the Barnes & Noble at 86th & Lexington. As noted, the full cast will be performing as well as signing. FUN HOME was a joyous experience for all involved (and at Playbill last week, Steven Suskin called it the best musical on the New York stage of 2013  far outclassing the competition  and is thus far the best musical of the 2013-14 season. The cast recording presents Fun Home in all its brilliance -- treat yourself to the CD, now.); join us as we celebrate its release this Thursday.\n\nPosted on Friday, March 28, 2014\n\nbus stop\n\nWe saw the final run-through of VIOLET at Roundabout Theatre Company's rehearsal space last Wednesday: no set, no costumes, no orchestra -- just cast and script and score, and it was glorious. We remembered loving the show when it first played off-Broadway, but we couldn't imagine -- as we sat there, deeply moved, last Wednesday -- that it would ever see a finer cast than the one assembled here, headed by Sutton Foster, Colin Donnell, Alex Gemignani and Josh Henry. A lot of Jeanine Tesori and Brian Crawley's score was cut from the original recording, and they've written quite a bit of new material to boot, so there were lots of musical surprises as well, and we came away with the resolution to preserve VIOLET in its full glory. We'll be going into the studio a week from Monday to record a two-disc set. Street date is June 3, but as always, we'll be shipping two weeks ahead of street date to those who pre-order here!\n\nPosted on Friday, February 7, 2014\n\nthe next few weeks...\n\nOur new cast recordings of FUN HOME and YANK! hit stores on February 25 (we had to bump them back a week, as the winter weather wreaked havoc with our printers schedule), but well start shipping orders from our website this Tuesday, the 11th. In the meantime, over the next few days, well be adding sound clips for both albums, so folks can sample and, should they desire, purchase. Were enormously excited about both releases and how true they are to our mission of great theater music, brilliantly performed and beautifully sung.\n\nPosted on Tuesday, January 28, 2014\n\nthe last few weeks...\n\nTwo of our esteemed colleagues in the press  Steven Suskin at Playbill.com and Rob Lester at Talkin Broadway  weighed in recently with their best of lists, and three of our 2013 releases were singled out by both: Rebecca Lukers I GOT LOVE (Songs of Jerome Kern), our two-disc cast recording of PASSION, and Philip Chaffins SOMETHIN REAL SPECIAL (The Songs of Dorothy Fields).\n\nWith regard to the latter album, just as it felt wonderful having customers and critics rediscover Kern at the start of 2013, its been just as gratifying seeing them rediscover Fields through the holiday season. The Toronto Star raved, Heres a blue-chip collection Philip Chaffin has one of those warm, sophisticated voices that call to mind the finer products of Kentuckys distilleries. Match him up with the dry, witty, bitters-flavored lyrics of the masterful Dorothy Fields, shake with a 23-piece orchestra and youve got a cocktail to cherish. Both the Huffington Post and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called the album long overdue and agreed that Philip was, in the words of the latter publication, the singer for the job. And Show Business tagged the album a bullseye Chaffins gorgeous, soaring baritone will make you hear these old songs in a fresh and thrilling new way.\n\nPosted on Friday, November 22, 2013\n\nwelcome to our house on Maple Avenue\n\nWe saw FUN HOME at The Public Theater on the afternoon of November 3rd; afterwards, we ran into composer Jeanine Tesori in the lobby and said something gushy and pushy like \"We want to record this.\" It's exactly the kind of beautifully scored, compellingly written, openly emotional piece to which we most respond, and although it's our first time working with Jeanine, we've worked many times with four of its stars -- Michael Cerveris, Judy Kuhn, Beth Malone and Alexandra Socha -- and look forward to doing so again, in the recording studio next Monday. If you haven't yet seen FUN HOME, which The New York Times hailed as \"a beautiful heartbreaker of a musical,\" you can read more and pre-order here.\n\nPosted on Friday, November 22, 2013\n\n\"the Chaffin charm\"\n\nPS Classics co-founder Philip Chaffin's Dorothy Fields tribute, SOMETHIN' REAL SPECIAL, streeted just ten days ago, but it's already received a slew of great reviews. At Talkin' Broadway, Rob Lester cheered, \"SOMETHIN' REAL SPECIAL radiates. Nothing can turn off the Chaffin charm. It's intrinsic and entrenched. And hooray for that. Chaffin, with unspoiled zeal and a feel for a romantic lyric, comes across as a true believer in true love.\" Former Playbill.com editor Ken Jones, in an expansive piece at his website, found Philip \"rich, warm and varied,\" singling out “I’ll Buy You a Star,” “You’re a Lovable Lunatic,” \"Sweet Charity” and \"the compelling melding of Harold Arlen’s 'Let Me Look at You' and Kern’s 'The Way You Look Tonight.'” (At USA Today, Elysa Gardner singled out the latter track as one of her picks of the week.) And current Playbill.com reviewer Steven Suskin hailed the album as \"an all-around delight. Dorothy Fields is a perfect match for Chaffin; his strong-but-flavorful voice does full justice to the music while serving up the songs with the twinkle-in-the-eye that Dorothy must have had when she sat writing them.\"\n\nPosted on Tuesday, November 19, 2013\n\nMy Soldier\n\nWe begin recording the off-Broadway cast album of the Zellnik brothers' YANK! this coming Thursday, but yesterday we were in the rehearsal room getting our first taste of the brand-new Jonathan Tunick charts, and as you can imagine, they are exquisite. We are so excited to (finally!) record this wonderful, funny and moving show on disc; if you don't know YANK!, or haven't yet placed your pre-order, you can do so here.\n\nPosted on Friday, September 20, 2013\n\nfour quick items\n\n1. We've begun accepting preorders for our original cast recording of Scott Frankel and Michael Korie's FAR FROM HEAVEN. 2. We've begun accepting preorders for Philip Chaffin's latest solo disc, SOMETHIN' REAL SPECIAL (The Songs of Dorothy Fields). 3. We've posted an interview that producer Tommy Krasker did for The Sondheim Review, about the making of the PASSION CD. 4. We now have a limited number of autographed PASSION CD's for sale.\n\nPosted on Friday, September 13, 2013\n\nDorothy Fields Forever\n\nFrom Tommy Krasker: \"We've spoken for many years about Philip doing a solo album devoted to the work of one songwriter, but it took us almost a decade to find the right fit. At one point, we thought Kern, then we thought Mercer -- that actually ended up becoming his Southern album -- but then we both thought of Dorothy Fields, and it seemed both unexpected and very, very appealing. We poured through several hundred songs, and little by little, whittled them down to sixteen, a combination of standards and some lesser-known -- and in a few cases, previously unrecorded -- gems. Some of our favorite orchestrators -- including Jonathan Tunick, Doug Besterman, Jason Carr and John Baxindine -- came on board to join us, as did conductor James Moore, with whom we so enjoyed working on Follies. We started recording last April and finish tracking today: the album is entitled Philip Chaffin: SOMETHIN' REAL SPECIAL (The Songs of Dorothy Fields), from an unpublished song by Fields and Harold Arlen, and we look forward to sharing it with you in early November. You can read more, see a track listing, and pre-order here.\"\n\nPosted on Friday, September 13, 2013\n\nHelp wanted\n\nRobert Edridge-Waks, who’s been our Editorial Coordinator these past four years, is leaving to devote more time to his writing career. So, help wanted: someone who writes well; who knows the difference between \"their\" and \"there\" and \"they’re\"; who knows why you capitalize \"is\" in a song title but not \"in.\" Someone with a keen editorial eye, an agreeable disposition, a passion for fact-checking, and an understanding that God is in the details. You’ll be working on a project-by-project basis: attending sessions, writing product descriptions and press releases, and prepping and supervising all our CD booklets. If you are interested and qualified, please send an email, with an attached bio, to info@psclassics.com. Note: this is a part-time position, financial details to be discussed.\n\nPosted on Friday, July 26, 2013\n\na couple of regular guys\n\nWe saw David and Joe Zellnik's YANK! at the York Theatre back in 2010, during its critically acclaimed, twice-extended, sold-out run. It was a gay love story set during World War II, and it was remarkable and moving: the kind of show audiences returned to multiple times. Following the off-Broadway run, the Zellniks continued to refine the work, and when we met with them this past spring, Yank! was an even better show, with three terrific new songs. We committed to recording it, but warned that -- with monies already set aside for Passion and Tom Sawyer -- we could only fund half of the production costs. The Zellniks have started a Kickstarter campaign to raise the remaining monies. Yank! is a wonderful work, and an important work, and we hope you'll help us preserve it on disc. Click here to contribute, and you might just be able to take home Yank! for Christmas.\n\nPosted on Wednesday, July 24, 2013\n\nwhen I think of Tom...\n\nSometime in the early '80s, after he'd successfully launched his first Broadway musical Nine, Maury Yeston became fascinated with creating a quintessentially American ballet score, and seized upon The Adventures of Tom Sawyer as his inspiration. The creation of the score came swiftly, but it wasn't until providence introduced him to the remarkable choreographer William Whitener, decades later, that he finally pursued a production. TOM SAWYER: A BALLET IN THREE ACTS was premiered by the Kansas City Ballet in the fall of 2011, to huge critical and popular acclaim, and this past spring, the score was preserved in a two-disc set by the seventy-piece San Francisco Ballet Orchestra. It's a must-own not only for those who love Yeston, but for those who love great American music; soundclips will be up next week, but in the meantime, you can read more and pre-order here.\n\nPosted on Friday, March 1, 2013\n\na date with Judy\n\nWe've been hoping to work with the wonderful Judy Kuhn since we started PS Classics, but the right opportunity never came along. Last year, she came to us after some hugely successful dates at Feinsteins, to see if we wanted to help her preserve the evening on disc. We wanted to  but all our monies at that point were tied up with Follies and Porgy. So Judy, God bless her, started a Kickstarter campaign, and her fans, God bless them, really came through. And by the time Judy had almost reached her goal and was ready to go into the studio, we were able to jump back on board and help her bring the album to fruition. Were thrilled to be releasing Judys latest solo album, ALL THIS HAPPINESS, on June 4th; you can read more and pre-order here.\n\nPosted on Friday, February 22, 2013\n\n...but she's only a dream\n\nWe recently posted a new About Us column, hinting at some upcoming projects. The first of these, which were thrilled to announce, is LAURA OSNES SINGS MAURY YESTON. Laura performed her evening of Yeston at 54 Below in November; we were overwhelmed, as was Maury, and once she opens in Rodgers and Hammersteins Cinderella, well be taking her and her band into the studio to preserve the evening on disc. (Maury has even reached into his trunk this past month to allow her to premiere a few Yeston gems that werent in the concert; it is, after all, the first solo disc of Yeston songs, done with Maurys cooperation, input and blessing.) You can read more and preorder here.\n\nPosted on Monday, February 4, 2013\n\na rave for Rebecca\n\nYesterday at Playbill.com, Steven Suskin weighed in on Rebecca Lukers I GOT LOVE (Songs of Jerome Kern), and it was the kind of rave that only comes  as the opening track puts it  once in a blue moon. He called it one of those CDs you can listen to over and over again the perfect combination of composer and singer. Youll want to listen to it repeatedly, immediately. And although Steven rightly focused most of his attention on the extraordinary Ms. Luker, we were enormously pleased about this quick shout-out: Let us also note that while this collection was assembled for a nightclub act, it sounds so much better because PS Classics took it into the studio. When we first heard Rebeccas show, and sat down with her to discuss a possible recording, we all agreed that the best way to preserve this particular show would be in the studio, with the repertoire and arrangements properly enhanced, and the material and performances allowed all the shadings and nuances they deserved. Steven concluded, Maybe if we buy lots of copies of I GOT LOVE, Rebecca and her pals at PS Classics will take a second foray into the still treasure-laden Kern songbook. Even if youre not a customer who typically buys our solo discs, we hope youll check this one out: we feel that Rebeccas performances -- like the Kern songbook they celebrate  are a treasure.\n\nPosted on Friday, February 1, 2013\n\nNoël and Cole\n\nOur new recording of NOEL AND COLE, which starts shipping February 12, features Philip Chaffin, Matthew Scott and Elizabeth Stanley taking on Porter, while Sara Jean Ford, Euan Morton and Barbara Walsh make the case for Coward. Track by track, arranger David Loud and orchestrator Jason Carr eschew the standard arrangements youve heard a zillion times, and go for something far more creative and distinctive. And as interpreted by this wonderful cast, its like hearing two dozen great songs again for the first time. Were very proud of NOEL AND COLE, so were doing something a little novel for its release  were offering variant front and back covers, so customers ordering from our website can choose Cole on the front and Noel on the back, or Noel on the front and Cole on the back. You can hear soundclips, check out the covers, and pre-order here. In addition to the U.S. and Canada, we're now accepting orders from Europe, Australia and Japan, and hope to add more regions in the coming months.\n\nPosted on Monday, November 26, 2012\n\nholiday sale and other news\n\nA quick note to let folks know that our holiday sale has officially begun. This year, all CDs (except the current year's crop) are marked down, most to $14.95. And we've begun shipping our two new releases: Anthony Rapp's WITHOUT YOU and the Jerome Kern revue THE LAND WHERE THE GOOD SONGS GO. Between now and the end of the holiday season, 25% of all sales will be donated to the Red Cross, to assist victims of Hurricane Sandy.\n\nPosted on Tuesday, November 6, 2012\n\nSandy\n\nHurricane Sandy ravaged our area last week. Our hearts go out to all those who suffered unimaginable damage, and have been facing the challenge of recovering and rebuilding without heat, power or resources. A number of the artists with whom we've been working have been dealing with Sandy's aftermath, and as a result, we're pushing back our two November releases, the Jerome Kern revue THE LAND WHERE THE GOOD SONGS GO and Anthony Rapp's one-man show WITHOUT YOU, by two weeks. Shipping will begin here at PS Classics on November 26th, the same day we begin our annual holiday sale. In the meantime, track listings and soundclips are up for both albums. 25% of our profits from these albums (as well as all discs sold during our holiday sale) will be donated to the Red Cross, to assist -- in our own small way -- the victims of Hurricane Sandy.\n\nPosted on Monday, November 5, 2012\n\nmake it another old fashioned\n\nLast summer, as we were preparing to record David Loud's Jerome Kern revue, David mentioned another evening he was working on: one that showcased and paired, in unexpected ways, the songs of Noël Coward and Cole Porter. The show existed only on paper, but we approached some of the performers with whom we've most enjoyed working -- Sara Jean Ford, Elizabeth Stanley, Barbara Walsh, Euan Morton and Matthew Scott -- and suggested David complete his work with them in mind. NOËL AND COLE starts recording this month, and we're aiming for a January 29th release. As with Rebecca Luker's upcoming disc, we're not yet taking preorders (CCNow, the company that's handled our credit card transactions the last 12 years, is closing its doors, so we're having to make new arrangements), but we'll be alerting folks on our e-blast list just as soon as preorders begin.\n\nPosted on Thursday, October 18, 2012\n\nstay old fashioned with me\n\nRebecca Luker performed an evening of Jerome Kern at 54 Below in July, and as with MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG earlier this year, we heard it and went, \"This has to be recorded.\" Talk about a singer and a songwriter who are perfectly matched; hearing Rebecca's voice soar on standards like \"The Song Is You,\" \"The Folks Who Live on the Hill\" and \"Why Was I Born?\" -- not to mention the lesser-known \"Not You,\" \"Saturday Night\" and \"I Got Love\" -- was simply thrilling. We're recording it on November 7th and 8th, and aiming for a January 29th release; you can read more here. We should be starting preorders in the next three weeks; we'll be alerting folks on our e-blast list at that time. If you're not on our e-blast list, you can join it here.\n\nPosted on Friday, September 21, 2012\n\nno insults and all morals\n\nIn 2004, music director David Loud took over 30 Jerome Kern songs and arranged them, exquisitely, into a theatrical evening that charted the course of three couples: how they meet, fall in love, and face life's challenges. It was originally produced in D.C., then arrived in New York City at Merkin Concert Hall in November 2010, where we heard it and were entranced. It starred some of our favorite performers -- all of them PS Classics \"alumni\" -- and we've been trying since then to fund a recording. This summer, the final monies came in, and we'll be recording a two-disc set next week. You can read more, check out the songlist, and pre-order here!\n\nPosted on Monday, September 17, 2012\n\nno day but today\n\nWe're in the studio today, in London, recording Anthony Rapp's moving and memorable one-man show WITHOUT YOU, direct from its sold-out engagement at the Menier Chocolate Factory. In a five-star review, the London Times called it transfixing in its truthfulness, an honest portrait of grief and growing up, while Time Out London said Rapp offered \"as moving and muscular performances of musical theatre as youll see on any stage this year. You can read more and preorder here.\n\nPosted on Friday, September 14, 2012\n\nNew/Old Christine\n\nNone of us here can remember why we didn't release THE CARLYLE SET, Christine Andreas's follow-up to our own HERE'S TO THE LADIES, but we keep thinking she must have been under contract to another label at the time. But that glorious album, first released in 2003, is now without a home, so we've snagged it and are proud to be re-releasing it. If you didn't grab it then, check it out now, hear a few soundclips, and make a purchase. We've marked it down to a special $14.95 pre-order price, and for the time being, we've marked down HERE'S TO THE LADIES as well.\n\nPosted on Monday, July 23, 2012\n\nI'm younger than that now\n\nLast week, USA Today named our 2012 Encores! cast recording of MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG as \"pick of the week,\" and we were furthered delighted to learn that, in its first week of release, it hit #1 on the Billboard Top Cast Album chart. MERRILY seems to have struck a nerve with both critics and customers, and we couldn't be more thrilled. Steven Suskin at Playbill.com raved, While the original Broadway cast album sounds great, this new recording sounds better. The whole thing practically leaps off the disc. Rob Lester at Talkin Broadway proclaimed it rich and radiant and rewarding, renewing one's love affair with the show and praised its magnificent sound and production, while TheaterManias Andy Propst declared, It's tough not to fall in love with this superlatively produced disc from the moment that one hears Tunick's revised overture. Midwest Records Chris Spector called it another sure-fire winner for the musical theater fan from PS Classics, and Joe Stead at Style Chicago noted that \"while I will continue to cherish the other cast albums, including the 1981 Broadway original, this one is revolutionary in many ways,\" as no other recording of the show will give you the full scope or better appreciation of this masterpiece than PS Classics latest labor of love assuredly does.\n\nPosted on Monday, July 9, 2012\n\niTunes upDate\n\nWe received a few emails from FOLLIES customers, disappointed that the digital booklet didn't include the lyrics. We take those comments seriously, so we're pleased to say that the iTunes digital booklet for MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG will include the full lyrics.\n\nPosted on Tuesday, June 26, 2012\n\nthe movers and the shapers\n\nOur new two-disc cast recording of the Encores! production of MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG starts shipping from our website today. The cast and creators had such a wonderful time making the album (we think that comes through on the CD itself) that theyll be reuniting once more, at a CD signing on Tuesday, July 10th at 4 PM at the Barnes & Noble at 150 E. 86th St in Manhattan. Composer-lyricist Stephen Sondheim and orchestrator Jonathan Tunick will be joined by stars Celia Keenan-Bolger, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Adam Grupper, Elizabeth Stanley and Betsy Wolfe. (Colin Donnell, alas, will be out of town.) Hope to see you there!\n\nPosted on Wednesday, June 13, 2012\n\nleave it to Jayne\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art recently asked if they could include \"Broadway Baby\" on a compilation CD they were doing, of songs from musicals set in New York City. We of course said yes, but we also felt the track might be more appropriate on a compilation disc as a Hattie solo, without Solange and the Whitmans mysteriously returning at the end. So the wonderful Jayne Houdyshell went back into the studio last month and recorded a new ending, and as a gift to our customers, we thought we'd make the solo track available here. You can download it on the FOLLIES page, just beneath the full track listing.\n\nPosted on Thursday, June 7, 2012\n\nboth the Gishes think it's delicious\n\nWe were afraid our vintage restoration of Gershwin and DeSylva's SWEET LITTLE DEVIL, sandwiched between two double-disc sets (PORGY AND BESS and our upcoming MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG), might slip through the cracks, but happily, in the two weeks since release, it's received a flood of positive notices, probably the best we've had for any vintage album since KITTY'S KISSES. Andy Propst at Theatermania called it \"a stunning studio recording, a buoyant joy,\" while Rob Lester at Talkin' Broadway hailed it as \"a bright, bouncy, sprightly, spiffy, springy delight.\" At Style Chicago, Joe Stead found it \"as close to heaven as the recorded musical theatre canon will allow,\" Midwest Record's Chris Spector proclaimed it \"a lost Broadway classic...a tasty addition to any Broadway collection,\" while Joseph Lang, at Jersey Jazz, described it as \"a bagatelle that will delight those who enjoy taking trips back to simpler days.\" Since 2009, we've been trying to do more of these studio cast albums of vintage shows, but as we've noted, we can only afford to do them if they sell. So if you haven't yet picked up SWEET LITTLE DEVIL, feel free to peruse the soundclips, and if you like what you hear, pick up a copy! You wouldn't believe the vintage restoration we're hoping to do next...\n\nPosted on Tuesday, June 5, 2012\n\nlisten to that\n\nSoundclips are now up for our new cast recording of Sondheim and Furth's MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG. Following the recording dates in early April, Celia Keenan-Bolger tweeted to her fellow cast members, Remember when we had one of the best theatrical experiences ever and then it got recorded? We think that enthusiasm -- shared by the cast, orchestra and all those in the recording studio those two days-- comes across on this album: affection not only for the experience, but for the piece itself, revised so brilliantly over the years by Sondheim and Furth and now fully orchestrated (from scratch) by Jonathan Tunick. Also up on the MERRILY page: an excerpt from a note by Mr. Tunick (from the CD booklet), in which he discusses his decision to reorchestrate the entire score, rather than just scoring the new numbers. MERRILY hits stores on July 10th, but order here, and we'll begin shipping on or before June 26th.\n\nPosted on Monday, April 22, 2012\n\nwhere did you go, George?\n\nTrack listings and soundclips are now up for both PORGY AND BESS and SWEET LITTLE DEVIL. The two CDs offer a wonderful opportunity to hear \"early\" Gershwin (from 1924, just before he achieved acclaim and celebrity for Rhapsody in Blue) and then hear where he went in just eleven short years -- and the soundclips give a nice little taste of that. (PORGY has 32 tracks, so make sure you scroll all the way down to hear all the clips.) Both CDs are on schedule for a May 8th web-release, two weeks prior to street date.\n\nPosted on Sunday, March 25, 2012\n\nsee the pretty countryside\n\nStephen Sondheim and George Furth spent nearly twenty years perfecting MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG: not so much a rewrite as a transformation. Last year, original orchestrator Jonathan Tunick scored the new songs, and then went ahead and rescored the entire work, giving it a consistency and clarity he felt it deserved. Encores! performed it in February, and we were blown away. Talk about something that needed to be preserved on disc -- so we'll be doing just that on April 9 and 10, in a two-disc set. Preorder now!\n\nPosted on Saturday, March 24, 2012\n\nhello, George\n\nWe're recording the New Broadway Cast Recording of PORGY AND BESS this coming Monday and Tuesday. As long as we're recording George Gershwin's final Broadway score, it seemed sort of fitting that we restore and record one of his earliest scores as well: in fact, his earliest surviving score. SWEET LITTLE DEVIL dates from 1924, George wrote it with his then-regular lyricist Buddy DeSylva, and it's a delight. We have the original orchestrations from the post-Broadway tour (by Robert Russell Bennett), and we're recording it with a cast headed by Bethe Austin, Danny Burstein, Philip Chaffin, Sara Jean Ford, Jason Graae, Rebecca Luker and Sally Wilfert. Sam Davis is conducting, and David Loud did the vocal arrangements. Preorder now!\n\nPosted on Saturday, February 25, 2012\n\nI understan' now, I got Porgy\n\nAs we reported yesterday, we'll be recording the New Broadway Cast Recording of The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess on March 26th and 27th. Street date is May 22nd, but we'll begin shipping here at PS Classics on May 8th, two weeks ahead of street date, and we're offering the two-disc set at a special reduced price. Pre-order now!\n\nOur e-commerce site, CCNow, was glitching yesterday, and we were delayed setting up pre-orders. Everything's working properly again now, so we're feeling relieved, and festive, so to that end: a free Porgy disc to the first person to identify the source of the song lyric quoted in the title above. Write us at info@psclassics.com.\n\nPosted on Friday, December 9, 2011\n\nHi\n\n(from The Good Wife, original air date 02.10.2010) OK, we keep swearing this will be our last column for 2011, but we keep having these little updates. Our New Broadway Cast Recording of FOLLIES enjoyed the best first-week sales of any Sondheim cast album since the Original Broadway Cast Recording of Passion back in 1994. We just wanted to thank all our loyal and passionate customers for embracing it the way they have. FOLLIES pretty much doubled our initial sales projections, and its strength surprised our retailers as well: some have already run low on product. So as we're busy filling reorders, some key retailers may be shy on product for about a week around Christmas. Rest assured, if product does go out of stock, it'll be back in stock soon; and in the meantime, we'll always have a stash here at PS Classics should customers prefer to order directly from us. Thanks to all for your continued patronage, and we'll see you back here in 2012.\n\nPosted on Tuesday, November 29, 2011\n\nBlood on the Tracks\n\n(from Medium, original air date 12.03.2010) We're aware that there's a glitch with the iTunes download of FOLLIES: we gather Disc One Track 9 is giving you Disc Two Track 9 instead. We delivered the tracks correctly (our esteemed Editorial Coordinator Robert Edridge-Waks sweated blood checking and double-checking), so somewhere en route to iTunes, something went awry. iTunes is working to address the problem, and our understanding is that as soon as it's fixed, customers who purchased the full album at iTunes will be able to go back and get the missing track (\"Rain on the Roof\") for free. We will keep you posted, we promise!\n\nPosted on Friday, November 25, 2011\n\nOne to Go\n\n(from CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, original air date 01.15.2009) This is probably our final column for 2011; we're taking a much-needed vacation starting December 10th. So a couple of quick announcements.\n\nWe posted a new About Us column. We're currently running our annual holiday sale, with 95% of our catalog marked down to $14.95. And although FOLLIES isn't marked down to $14.95, we are leaving it at the special $14.95 price for the time being.\n\nSpeaking of FOLLIES, we started shipping our new two-disc set a week ago Tuesday, and customers have been showering us with emails, some calling it \"the definitive FOLLIES album,\" \"the first recording to capture all of the magic that is FOLLIES,\" \"the recording we have been waiting for for 40 years,\" \"a FOLLIES worthy of the score and play,\" \"incredible,\" \"pure brilliance,\" and \"a dream come true.\" If you haven't yet ordered, grab it while it's on sale, and feel free to pick up some additional CD's for just $14.95. Like last year, half the profits from our sale will be donated to The Trevor Project, the leading national organization focused on crisis and suicide prevention efforts among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth.\n\nPosted on Monday, November 14, 2011\n\nYou're Welcome\n\nCongratulations to Jason Adams of Pensacola, FL, the winner of our \"identify some of Tommy's favorite TV episodes\" contest, which (happily) got way more entries than we anticipated. A lot of readers got two or three right, but Jason came through with a staggering five out of six (that would be \"The Gift,\" Buffy the Vampire Slayer, original air date 05.22.2001; \"Two Weddings,\" Cold Case, 02.28.2010; \"To Whom It May Concern,\" Gilmore Girls, 01.30.2007; ; \"The Girl Who Waited,\" Doctor Who, 09.10.2011; and \"A Pretty Good Day,\" Judging Amy, 11.19.2002), missing only \"Celebration\" (Knots Landing, 02.10.1983). On its way to Jason: a complimentary FOLLIES disc. By the end of the day tomorrow, FOLLIES will also be on its way to all those who pre-ordered here. You're Welcome (another of Tommy's favorite episodes; from Angel, original air date 02.04.2004-- but sorry, we're done with contests for the year).\n\nPosted on Tuesday, November 8, 2011\n\nThe Gift\n\nWe don't begin shipping FOLLIES until a week from today, but the number of pre-orders has already exceeded that of any album in our catalog. We're gratified that fans are as excited about the album as we are -- but we also recognize that times are tight, so we wanted to offer one more opportunity for someone to get a free FOLLIES disc before we start shipping in seven days. Here goes. The titles of the latest six notes on this page -- including this one -- are titles of six of Tommy's favorite TV episodes. Write us at info@psclassics.com, identify the shows and the original air dates (e.g., \"The Gift,\" Joan of Arcadia, original air date: 5/14/04 -- which, by the way, is not a correct answer), and the first person to get all six right -- or whoever comes the closest to identifying all six -- wins a free FOLLIES set. Couple hints: they're all one-hour shows, and the earliest dates back to 1983.\n\nPosted on Wednesday, November 2, 2011\n\nTo Whom It May Concern\n\nA note from Tommy Krasker: Thanks to the nearly one hundred people who made submissions in our recent \"guess-the-FOLLIES-track-listing\" contest, and congratulations to the winner, Bradley Calise of Wentzville, MO. Final track listing now posted on the FOLLIES page. (The track list alone, of course, doesn't tell you all you might want to know; for example, the track called \"You came; you're really here...\" runs a full three minutes and fifty-four seconds -- you'll have to purchase the CD to find out everything that's on it!) Also posted, eight sound clips, one with a particularly fun surprise: a lyric Steve Sondheim re-wrote the day of the recording, between the second and third takes of that particular song. (\"I finally figured out the right word after forty years,\" he was heard to comment.) In addition, a brief note from me, direct from the CD booklet, about this new recording edition. My goal was to truly capture the FOLLIES experience on disc, and I hope the resulting New Broadway Cast Recording does justice not only to FOLLIES the score but to FOLLIES that \"brilliant show, extraordinarily intelligent, wonderfully entertaining [with] both a stunning direct appeal and rare complexity of feeling and structure,\" as Jack Kroll described it in 1971. As a reminder, we start shipping from PS Classics on November 15th, two weeks ahead of street date. Order now!\n\nPosted on Wednesday, October 26, 2011\n\nTwo Weddings\n\nLast year, we invited customers to guess the track listing for LA CAGE AUX FOLLES; we thought we'd do the same this year with FOLLIES. We've promised an \"expansive\" recording, and indeed, all the songs are there, plus dance music, some dialogue lead-ins, some scenes, some speeches -- you may think you've heard FOLLIES on disc, but trust us: not like this. We're still determining exactly where we'll be putting the ID's, but it looks like it will be a 33- or 34-track set. A free FOLLIES CD to the person who comes closest to guessing the correct track listing; write us at info@psclassics.com, and put FOLLIES TRACK LISTING in the subject line. A couple of hints. The Montage (i.e., \"Rain on the Roof\" et al) is currently ID'ed as three separate tracks, and there are no \"bonus tracks\" or \"cut songs.\" And needless to say, for dialogue tracks, you don't need to guess the right track \"name\" -- just let us know what scene you think we're including (e.g., Track 23: the scene with Ben and Phyllis before \"Could I Leave You?\"). We'll be unveiling the final track listing, with soundclips, a week from today!\n\nPosted on Tuesday, September 13, 2011\n\nThe Girl Who Waited\n\nMaury Yeston's DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY concerns a young woman named Grazia Lamberti, who's been waiting all her life for that one true love to appear; she finds him in the guise of Prince Nikolai Sirki, and the resulting love story is set to some of the most gorgeous and haunting songs written for the musical theatre in the last decade or two. You can listen to soundclips now by clicking here. And then, for heaven's sake, if you haven't pre-ordered the CD yet, what are you waiting for? It's a new score by Maury Yeston; it doesn't get better than that! We'll begin shipping September 27th.\n\nPosted on Monday, September 12, 2011\n\nCelebration\n\nAn intern who worked for us in 2003 wrote recently, amused by two of our recent releases, both live albums, as he recalled our once saying that we don't like live albums. We're pretty sure that's not what we said; we probably noted instead we only consider releasing live albums a) if they're really, really, really well-recorded, and b) if there's a reason to do them live: if there's something about the evening -- the story-telling, the response, the rapport between singer and audience, the intimacy (or conversely, the high spirits), the fluidity -- that would be difficult to duplicate in a studio setting. Such was the case with Kate Baldwin's SHE LOVES HIM (Live at Feinstein's) which benefitted from being preserved live, and happily has received lavish praise from critics and customers.\n\nOf SHE LOVES HIM, Kate Baldwin's salute to Sheldon Harnick (on which the master lyricist joins her for several tracks), Next Magazine called it \"superb,\" Theatermania praised its \"beauty and aplomb,\" while Edge Magazine went into song-by-song detail: \"She stuns with 'Will He Like Me,' 'Youre Going Far,' and 'I Couldnt Be With Anyone but You,' all ballads that sweep you off your feet with her honeyed tones, buttery belt, and appealing sincerity. Her blending of 'Sabbath Prayer' with 'Far From the Home I Love' is breathless enough, but finishing it off with the exultant 'Matchmaker' whips the drama into a frenzy that will sweep you right up with it.\" And Steven Suskin at Playbill.com noted, \"Baldwin is the soprano who warmed Broadway's cold heart when she played Sharon, the lass from Glocca Morra, in the 2009 revival of Finian's Rainbow. She was just as grandish at Feinstein's; imagine what Baldwin can do with 'Will He Like Me?' or 'When Did I Fall in Love?' and you'll get a good idea of how the evening went. You needn't imagine it; PS Classics has brought the act to CD.\" Kate and Sheldon will be celebrating the CD release with a performance and signing at the Barnes & Noble at 150 E. 86th St. in Manhattan this Thursday, September 15th, at 5 PM.\n\nPosted on Thursday, September 1, 2011\n\nA Pretty Good Day\n\nWith all the destruction Irene brought to our region last weekend, and all the ongoing clean-up, it seems almost inappropriate or somehow callous to note the nice things that happened while -- well, while we were waiting for the lights to come back on. NPR ran a story on SWEET BYE AND BYE a week ago (which you can access here) and we learned on Tuesday that, as a result, sales tripled from the previous week, meaning a lot of new folks took the opportunity to sample this forgotten show, which is a very good thing. And the same day, we learned that three of our albums were among the 10 Best-Selling Cast Albums at amazon.com: A MINISTER'S WIFE at #5, FOLLIES at #6, and DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY at #8. We promised this year to really limit our albums to projects we cared deeply about: to do them for us, and hope our customer base followed. We're enormously grateful to see folks responding. Continued thanks to all our customers for their kind and loyal support.\n\nPosted on Monday, August 22, 2011\n\none more souvenir of bliss\n\nThe \"bliss\" in question is James Goldman & Stephen Sondheim's FOLLIES, one of the truly legendary works of the American musical theatre. The \"souvenir\" in question is our two-disc New Broadway Cast Recording of the Kennedy Center production, directed by Eric Schaeffer with choreography by Warren Carlyle and music direction by James Moore, currently in previews at Broadways Marquis Theatre. With a 28piece orchestra, FOLLIES features a cast of 41 and stars Bernadette Peters, Jan Maxwell, Danny Burstein, Ron Raines and Elaine Paige. We'll be recording October 3rd and 4th, unveiling the album in stores on November 29th, but shipping from our website two weeks prior to that. And from now till street date, you can purchase the double-disc here for just $14.95, a savings of more than 35% off list price. Pre-order now!\n\nPosted on Friday, August 12, 2011\n\ntime for a holiday\n\nNo, no, we're not going on holiday -- we usually wait till winter to do that. The title refers to the fact that last Monday, we had the honor and the fun (and trust us, recording dates aren't typically fun, but this one was) of recording two-time Tony Award-winner Maury Yeston's newest musical, DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY, which The New York Times hailed as one lush, soaring number after another ... a gorgeously sung, melody-rich score. And indeed it is, as one might expect from Mr. Yeston, one memorable tune after another -- and spectacularly performed by a cast headed by Kevin Earley, Jill Paice, Michael Siberry, Rebecca Luker, Simon Jones and Matt Cavenaugh. Street date is October 11th, but we'll start shipping on September 27th.\n\nPosted on Monday, July 11, 2011\n\ncandor\n\nLast week's passing of former First Lady Betty Ford (no, not pictured left -- don't be rude) reminded us of the virtues of candor; she was a great lady who was never afraid to speak her mind. Over the past few months, we've been touting SWEET BYE AND BYE as \"perhaps the greatest lost score in the musical theatre canon,\" and we've received some ribbing for that. It's not the kind of statement you're supposed to make, at least in print. Nonetheless, we think it's true, and although it's a bold assertion, it's our opinion, and we're sticking to it.\n\nWhat we can state as fact, however, is that we've never done a recording where, prior to street date, we've received so many complimentary notes. Several of the actors involved with SWEET BYE AND BYE wrote us shortly after receiving their advance copies to tell us how much they loved the album; musicians, too. Folks in the business, and customers who preordered at our website. And given that the album doesn't even street till tomorrow, we can't think of another occasion when we've already gotten so many reviews this early on; we're thrilled that interest seems high.\n\nAt Style Chicago, Joe Stead found it \"an absolutely delicious and memorable score ... sublimely melodic and frequently hilarious, as good as musical comedy preservation and resuscitation gets. \" Edge Magazine's J. Peter Bergman found it a worthy reminder of \"how good Vernon Duke was at writing songs for Broadway. Its 26 tracks are filled with hauntingly lovely tunes\" -- and although Bergman doubted our assertion that it was perhaps the great lost score, he admitted it was \"wonderful to have years of wondering brought to a stereophonic conclusion.\" Chris Spector at Midwest Records, on the other hand, did agree with our estimation of the score, hailing that it \"takes you back to the time [when] writers really had something to say. This was a flop? Unthinkable. Follow the adventures of Solomon Bundy through time and enjoy a treat thats not a forbidden fruit but one that was out of reach for far too long. Top shelf all the way.\"\n\nPosted on Friday, June 10, 2011\n\nin affairs of the heart, how Kate was great\n\nWe've already announced our upcoming recording of Kate Baldwin's SHE LOVES HIM, in which Kate -- following her triumphant debut album LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS -- takes on the work of another songwriter she ardently adores: here, the wonderful Sheldon Harnick, who joins her for a half-dozen numbers. But now we have a special offer to share with customers: an invitation not only to purchase the CD, but to come see Kate and Sheldon perform at Feinstein's at the Regency in a special show on July 14th, and to stay after for a VIP champagne toast and meet-and-greet. You can check out the offer in detail here.\n\nPosted on Wednesday, June 8, 2011\n\nan orgy of Georgie Shaw\n\nA quick note to announce that we'll be recording the original off-Broadway cast album of Lincoln Center Theater's production of A MINISTER'S WIFE, by Joshua Schmidt (which whom we had the privilege of collaborating on ADDING MACHINE: THE MUSICAL), Jan Levy Tranen and Austin Pendleton. We'll be taking the cast, as directed by Michael Halberstam, into the studio at the end of the month, and we're aiming for a late August release. You can read more here and preorder here.\n\nPosted on Sunday, May 8, 2011\n\nfamily\n\nLast Tuesday, on a particularly awful business day (the kind of day when the bad news just keeps on comin'), Tommy was heard to exclaim, \"I hate the world, Tillie,\" a quote (or slight misquote, as it turns out) from Paul Zindel's Pulitzer Prize-winning play The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds. A few days later, we were saddened to learn that the actress who had first uttered that phrase, the amazing Sada Thompson, had passed away at age 83. We lost a lot of great people in the arts last week, but for those kinds of subjective reasons that sometime defy explanation, Ms. Thompson's passing proved particularly upsetting. We never saw her performance in Marigolds, or her Tony Award-winning quadruple turn in Twigs (of which Walter Kerr wrote that she \"does not simply give a stunning performance -- she gives four of them\"), and her only long-running television role, her Emmy-winning portrayal of matriarch Kate Lawrence in ABC's Family, was so softened and muted after the first full season that it ultimately gave her little opportunity to shine. But if you want to see an inkling of the force that was Sada Thompson, check out this clip from the pilot of Family, as mesmerizing now as it was in 1976, then check out this equally affecting one from later in the same episode.\n\nPosted on Friday, April 29, 2011\n\nDid you think you'd get a prince?\n\nOn this particular day when William and Kate have exchanged vows, perhaps it's fitting that we announce a pairing of our own: not of British royalty, but of Broadway royalty. Kate Baldwin will unveil her second solo disc on PS Classics this summer with the release of SHE LOVES HIM: Kate Baldwin Sings Sheldon Harnick, which we recorded live at Feinsteins in March. The album is dedicated to the songs of Sheldon Harnick and includes not only favorites from his biggest hits -- Fiddler on the Roof, She Loves Me and Fiorello! -- but rarely-heard songs from his early Off-Broadway career, film scores and unproduced musicals. Harnick even joins Baldwin on several selections, making it very much a \"royal pairing.\" (Harnick, of course, has been a member of the Broadway elite for decades now; Kate is not only a 2010 Tony Award-nominee for her starring role in Finians Rainbow, but it is perhaps worth noting that her character's lineage in that particular show is of such quality stock that, in the words of Yip Harburg and Fred Saidy, \"her whole family tree for gener"
