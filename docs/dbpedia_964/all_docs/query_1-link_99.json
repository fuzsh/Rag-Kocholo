        "text": "Credit: Hreinn Gudlaugsson\n\nSnarky Puppy has announced the postponement of four formerly impending tour dates due to the exponential loss felt in the wake of band member Shaun Martin’s passing. The Grammy-award-winning musician, keyboardist, and producer died on Saturday, August 3, following extensive medical supervision stemming from an April 2023 stroke. Martin was 45.\n\nSnarky Puppy addressed the loss on social media, writing on Monday, August 4, “Yesterday, we lost a music legend and, more importantly, a beautiful, luminous human being. Shaun Martin touched so many people during his life and through the beautiful immortality of music, will continue to do so. There’s so much that can be said but words can’t do justice. Rest in peace.”\n\nMartin was born in Dallas on August 23, 1978. By age 4, his mother had enrolled him in piano lessons, where he was exposed to classical and jazz styles. Through his church congregation, Martin developed an admiration for gospel sounds, a theme which lent itself later in his lifetime as music director for genre standout Kirk Franklin, the former Minister of Music at Dallas’ Friendship-West Baptist Church–a role in which he took home four Grammy.\n\nFrom his formative years as a Franklin producer, he was awarded the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Gospel Album (Hero), the 2009 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Gospel Album (The Fight of My Life), the 2012 Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album (Hello Fear) and the 2019 Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album (Long, Live, Love) which was only the start of his professional accolades.\n\nMartin joined Michael League’s Snarky Puppy and furthered his decorated status with the 2016, 2021, and 2023 Grammy Awards for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album (Culcha Vulcha, Live at the Royal Albert Hall and Empire_Central, respectfully). Beyond time in the studio, Martin was a staple of the Dallas live music scene before continued success as a contributing and solo artist.\n\nAs fall out from Martin’s passing, Snarky Puppy has pushed their slate of upcoming concerts, including August 8 at Lincoln Hill Farms in Canandaigua, N.Y., Boston’s August 9 stand at Suffolk Downs, and subsequent festival appearances at Hot August Music Festival and Richmond Jazz & Music Festival.
