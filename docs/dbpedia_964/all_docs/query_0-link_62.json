        "text": "Shishido Kavka recently transferred to Avex. She’s set to release her new digital single, “Don’t be love“, on April 29. The song features Saito Kazuyoshi. That song is a taste of what is to come on her recently announced mini album. On June 17, Kavka will release “K5.” This mini album will have 5 songs, each with a different artist. One of the other songs on “K5” is called “Trans fatty acid” and it features KenKen.\n\n“K5” will be released in 2 editions. The CD only edition will have a bonus track, while the CD+DVD edition will have 2 music videos, including the one for “Don’t be love.”\n\nCheck out the covers for “K5” after the jump!\n\nWe’re back with this week’s edition of Oricon Flashback. This is where we look back on what topped Oricon this week 5, 10, 15, and 20 years ago. Think of it as a way to reminisce and learn about the past of Japanese music.\n\nThe trailer for Kimura Takuya’s HERO movie has been released. The movie will open on July 18 and will be directed again by Matsuyuki Suzuki. The movie includes Kitagawa Keiko, the new heroine in the second season of HERO and Koichi Sato, in a role that will be in confilct with Kuryu Kohei. Returning to the cast is Takako Matsu, the primary heroine in the first season.\n\nIn the new movie, Public Prosecutor Kuryuu Kohei (Kimura Takuya) investigates an incident involving an embassy of a certain country, which holds the key for resolve. However, the right to criminal investigation involving an embassy or a diplomat is challenged with the “the barrier of the extraterritorial rights.”\n\nHERO became a hit in 2001, recording an average audience rating 34.3%. This was followed by an SP in 2006 and a movie in 2007. The second season aired July 2014, 13 years after the first season and recorded an average audience rating 21.3%.\n\nAKB48 held a premiere showcase event at a movie theater for the music video of their 40th single “Bokutachi wa Tatakawanai” to be released on May 20. The video is directed by Otomo Keishi, the director for the “Rurouni Kenshin” live action movies. For the filming, the director has re-gathered over 100 staff from the “Ruoruni Kenshin” production team. Shimazaki Haruka, who served as center for the song was thrilled to watched the MV and has teared up.\n\nFor the 40th single and 10th anniversary of the group in December, a big budget comparable to a movie was prepared for the 12 minute long music video. It starts with the members walking the runway in glittering fashion but the attraction is the fierce action scenes. To prepare for the filming, the members received intensive action training.\n\nPreviously, summer singles such as “Ponytail to Shushu” and “Everyday, Katyusha” is represented by the blue sea, white sandy beaches, and dance swimsuit. Director Otomo wanted to show something different this time such as their seriousness. Swimsuits are not just their charm.\n\nCheck out the short version of “Bokutachi wa Tatakawanai” PV below.\n\nContinuing from the first installment of the ratings report, check out the week’s latest numbers below.\n\nAs usually happens for the 2nd episode ratings, most of the numbers went down, as TV specials also aired on competing timeslots. Wild Heroes made its premiere while Tenno no Ryoriban will be airing its first episode this Sunday.\n\nThe prelude to the Golden Week was a very huge movie weekend with 4 new movies making big movie openers. Dragon Ball Z: Fukkatsu no F had the biggest opening in Japan so far for 2015, making Japan the only territory in the world where Furious 7 did not debut at number one. The new movies occupied the top 4 of the box office and earned a combined 2.7 billion yen during the weekend.\n\nCheck out the latest box office ranking below.\n\nWe have some sad news to report now. The second son of actors Odagiri Joe and Kashii Yuu recently passed away. He died of strangulated ileus on April 20 at 6:23 AM. He was 1 year and 9 days old. Strangulated ileus is a condition that involves the failure of the gastrointestinal tract to function properly. He was diagnosed with the condition on April 14 and immediately admitted to hospital so that surgery could be performed. He continued to be treated post-surgery, but his condition suddenly worsened. He did not make it unfortunately.\n\nOdagiri Joe and Kashii Yuu married on February 16, 2008. This day is also both of their birthdays; they’re exactly 11 years apart. Their first son was born in February 2011. Their second son was born in April 2014.\n\nWe here at Arama Japan wish them the best at this sad time."
