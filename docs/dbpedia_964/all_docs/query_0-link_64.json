        "text": "Thalía - desAMORfosis\n\nALBUM [20/52] - May 14th\n\n★★★\n\n​\n\nThalia has always been something I have been a casual fan for. This album didn't change that perspective though it does excellently what it should do. Brighten these summer days with amazing rays of sunshine in bop form. Starting track Mojito does exactly that and set this tone well. Eres Mio was released as a single a day ago to coincide of become a summer smash and it have every shot to do so at Sprocky FM. It is rather short (clocking in at exactly 2 minutes - which is not even the shortest song here), but I guess that helps the track in becoming tired of it. The honour of shortest track (1:56) goes to Cancelado and yes it should have been longer. In this reggeaton-heavy album Bolsito Caro might be the most PJ-friendly as the synths make it very poppy (prove me wrong @londonrain as I sometimes flop with these opinions ddd). But also the duet Sofia Reyes and Farina Tick Tock has a high bop factor. In the end this is an album you put on on hot day and before you know it the album is finished. You did not skip one track and you have been dancing along slightly throughout the whole thing, but nothing really got you up your feet. You easily forget the album was even released (so close to Eurovision doesn't help either), but when you remember it exists you play it and it is a fun experience.\n\nSprocky's recommendations:\n\nMojito\n\nEres Mio\n\nTick Tock\n\nOlivia Rodrigo - SOUR\n\nALBUM [21/52] - May 21st\n\n★★★★☆​\n\nShe basically did that. She is easy to root for and since Driver's Licence (I did not follow her on Disney) I was easily hooked. She instantly showcased a competent level of songwriting with vocal dedication that sounds mature. I still have so many moments the middle-8 from her debut single comes into my head and I feel a strong desire to sing along despite in being public. Her strong writing skills are strengthened by Deja Vu with especially the lines of Uptown Girl. There is so much emotion in those sections that are weirdly easy to connect with. For me that track is the standout and the centerpiece for this debut album. This is a breakout star and opening track Brutal is clearly frontrunning that message. Suddenly it's the early 2000's all over again (and I already was on a high from that because of @slaybellz rate concerning that brilliant moment in pop). We knew she could go there with the worldwide smash and third single Good 4 U and damn I did not know I was so thirsty for this genre until she brought this song. And suddenly I have withdrawal issues and need more fixes from other artists as well. This album isn't perfect in the way the latest work from Jazmine Sullivan, London Grammar and Aly & AJ were so I can't award 5 stars, but DAMN she came very close.\n\nSprocky's recommendations:\n\nDeja Vu\n\nDriver's Licence\n\nBrutal\n\nTexas - Hi\n\nALBUM [22/52] - May 28th\n\n★★★​\n\nIn case you did not know I am a massive stan from this band. And though they are not exactly artistically peaking the last decade I still get excited when they release something. With their lead-single Hi featuring Wu-Tang Clan they exactly did what they should do. Get me rallied up for the album. This lead single is among the strongest they released in 10 years and also quintessential Texas. I definitely did not need a solo version cause the rap gives it the edge it needs. Second single Mr Haze is a great followup showing they still got it, but I grew tired by the time album was released. Just Want To Be Liked is from the album track an instant favourite and channels Sharleen's Melody heavily. I especially love the horn section that gives it a mariachhi feel. Transported to Cancun in an all-inclusive by a single song. The power of music. Speaking of which: Unbelievable is a classic Texas-tearjerker that would have fit easily on Careful What You Wish For or Red Book as well, both amazing albums. Than the album gets into a bit of blend mediocreness, with especially Moonstar being a low. Duet with Clare Grogan Look What You've Done is excluded from this narrative as in it's Bleachers-realness this is refreshing in their discography and very on trend. Also a great track in the second part of the album is Falling. It sits right at home at Mothers Heaven with it's gothrock-feel. For a 10th album they have done superb job at throwbacking earlier work (rather directly with Hi) and the current trends in music without feeling forced.\n\nSprocky's recommendations:\n\nHi\n\nJust Want To Be Liked\n\nLook What You've Done\n\nLiz Phair - Soberish\n\nALBUM [23/52] - June 4th\n\n★​\n\nI got acquainted with Liz Phair after a recommendation for my own poprock rate and I liked what I heard. She got on my to watch list and when I noticed she released an album (in over 10 years also (!)) I knew I had to check it out. I heard none of the songs preceding this album and I can't say they are the standouts (there over 5 and probably spread out over a year due to Covid). Her sound is mellow and very much in trend with my listening profile in the late 00's. So some sort of throwback, but not entirely sweeping with my least fave being Hey Lou. However the following track In There is an easy standout. Perfect for your late evening playlist. That also applies to Sheridan Road which I view as the album highlight. I am always here for songs celebrating your hometown and this also ties in with geographical elements lyrics. I simply have to stan hard. Soul Sucker has a fantastic vibe to it with a superb middle-8 and outro. Another case of a mellow track done very well. A bit triphoppy in places. Too bad these last three mentioned tracks are the only ones I actively enjoy and probably will return to compared to the album.\n\nSprocky's recommendations:\n\nIn There\n\nSheridan Road\n\nSoul Sucker\n\nMarina - Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land\n\nALBUM [24/52] - June 11th\n\n★★★★​\n\nThis is such an unexpected triumph. I wasn't fallen out of love with her after Love + Fear like most forum members did, but I hardly would call it a great album. This however in it's more concise packaging manages to almost become all killer no filler. Opening track and giving the album it's title Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land is classic Marina that sounds updated and fresh for 2021. She really found her origins again and the reason I fell in love with her. I am also surprised to see Man's World has already racked up over 100 plays (which often means top 5 on lock for a yearchart). Hearing it now it feels like I am swept for the first time again and showcasing some serious longevity. I also loved Purge The Poison on release and especially the version with Pussy Riot, which sadly didn't get tacked on the official album. Pussy Riot seem to be a weird fit for Marina (especially with Love + Fear in the back of your mind before this release), but hearing that remix it really shows it is a match made in heaven. Venus Fly Trap is the only single that hasn't swept me and is alongside I Love You But I Love Me More the reason I can't 10 this album. They seem to highlight the worst from Electra Heart for me. Closing track Goodbye is in it's Froot realness a perfect closure for an era full of nostalgia.\n\nSprocky's recommendations:\n\nAncient Dreams in a Modern Land\n\nMan's World\n\nGoodbye\n\nAngélique Kidjo - Mother Nature\n\nALBUM [25/52] - June 18th\n\n★★★★​\n\nThe queen of Afrobeat has returned once again with original music in English, French and local African languages. Benin born Angèlique Kidjo is celebrating the strength and wealth of the continent on this album and nothing showcases this more than Africa (One of a Kind) where she duets with veteran Salif Këita from Mali and upcoming Afrobeat sensation Mr.Eazi from Nigeria - who released the great and previously reviewed EP Something Else. Three generations cme together on this track that seem to bind everything together. That also is visable due to the amount of features and another great one is Alexandra Govere on Meant For Me. A track about loving the inner of someone, but without becoming sappy. Her French duet Mycelium is also a great standout. Matthieu Chedid is a great vocal fit for her. The absolute emotion they manage to convey in such a short time is astounding. On the few solo tracks, like title track Mother Nature (that got a feature with Sting for the single release nñn), but moreso the closing track Flying High she showcases she can excel on her own. In fact that latter might be my all around favourite track. A perfect combination of Afrobeat and western pop music making it very easy on the ears. Overall no track is really bad or something I would skip and this is perfect for that late summer evening.\n\nSprocky's recommendations:\n\nAfrica (One of a Kind)\n\nMycelium\n\nFlying High\n\nLady Gaga - Born This Way TENTH ANNIVERSARY\n\nALBUM [26/52] - June 25th\n\n★★​\n\nObviously I will be commenting only on the new tracks like I did with Future Nostalgia - Moonlight Editions and Taylor's version of Fearless. Comparing it to those two it probably is the one I am the least impressed with. Yet it also had the most potential perhaps. The standout from the 6 tracks that got revamped is Big Freedia's take on Judas. It is such an interesting take on it. That same can be said about the Highwomen revamping Highway Unicorn (Road To Love) yet I will echo pretty much everyone's thought about You & I being right there. Ben Platt also is for me the weakest among the bunch, so that definitely feels like potential wasted as to me You & I is top 10 Gaga - even after all these years. Not a great rendition either is the rendition from Years and Years doing The Edge of Glory which took out Clarence Clemuns' iconic saxophone that basically is the foundation of the entire track. Such an odd choice to replay it with rather cheap and dated synths. Speaking of cheap and dated synths... what was up with Kylie doing Marry The Night with that production that seems to be lacking. Sadly Kylegend's vocals couldn't save it. Though with a lack of originality for Orville Peck he does manage to elevate Gaga's own country version in his take on Born This Way and makes her version rather useless. An easy standout from this mixed bag.\n\nSprocky's recommendations:\n\nJudas (by Big Freedia)\n\nHighway Unicorn (Road To Love) (by The Highwomen)\n\nBorn This Way (by Orville Peck)\n\nWe're continuing to update!!\n\nMay (pt 2)\n\nBuild a Problem\n\ndodie\n\nFavourite Tracks: Hate Myself, Rainbow, Four Tequilas Down, When, Before the Line, Bored Like Me\n\nThe section in the middle that is joined together by one long string section is absolutely stunning. I just wish she would actually sing like she used to. I did really enjoy this though.\n\na touch of the beat gets you up on your feet gets you out and then into the sun\n\nAly & AJ\n\nFavourite Tracks: Pretty Places, Slow Dancing, Symptom of Your Touch, Lucky to Get Him, Stomach\n\nGod, this is beautiful. It's so nice to have another album from them. I feel so happy whenever I listen to this. It's just gorgeous from start to finish. As they deserve.\n\nJune\n\nTrying (Season Two Soundtrack)\n\nMaisie Peters\n\nFavourite Tracks: Funeral, Helicopter, I Want You to Change, The Party, Glowing Review, Lunar Years\n\nI can't believe we're kinda getting two albums from her this year. Her power. There are a couple of songs here that didn't click but overall, what a lovely project. Maisie really knows how to draw you in with her lyrics, melodies and unique vocals. I'm obsessed.\n\nDear OHMYGIRL\n\nOh My Girl\n\nFavourite Tracks: Dun Dun Dance, Dear You, My Doll\n\nFrom feeling lukewarm on Dun Dun Dance to it becoming one of my favourite songs of the year. Character development. The bsides on this are also fantastic in almost a haunting way. Love that for them.\n\nif i could make it go quiet\n\ngirl in red\n\nFavourite Tracks: Seratonin, Did You Come?, hornylovesickness, Rue, .\n\nYes, I too am gay.\n\nBlood Bunny\n\nchloe moriondo\n\nFavourite Tracks: Rlly Don't Care, I Eat Boys, Bodybag, Strawberry Blonde\n\nYes, I too am gay (pt 2). Thanks to @Music Is Death for the recommendation. I really did enjoy this.\n\nSummer Queen\n\nBrave Girls\n\nFavourite Tracks: Chi Mat Ba Ram, Pool Party\n\nThis was cute. Mostly I'm just really happy for them.\n\nTaste of Love\n\nTWICE\n\nFavourite Tracks: First Time, Scandal, Conversation. Baby Blue Love\n\nAlcohol Free is....okay, but this is actually a really strong mini album. First Time is the one for me.\n\nBDZ\n\nTWICE\n\nFavourite Tracks: One More Time, Say it Again, Be as One\n\nUhh, eh. This is (unfairly) what I associate with TWICE's Japanese output. I just don't really vibe.\n\n&TWICE\n\nTWICE\n\nFavourite Tracks: Fake & True, Stronger, Breakthrough, Changing!, Happy Happy\n\nOn the other hand, this is a winner. I will add this to my heavy rotation and am majorly regrettting not getting to it sooner. I'm sorry my girls!!!\n\nUntil next time xoxo\n\nJune really put me ahead of my goals, so I love that for me.\n\nJanuary Listens (2021 Release) 15/200\n\n1.

TWICE - &TWICE (2019)\n\nWhen I was going through my chart lists for this month, I noticed that I had listened to quite a number of albums, and I usually send @Slice of Life a couple of sentences, so I decided to expand on that a bit and post in here, rather than listening and immediately forgetting.\n\nI also had nothing else to do this week. This is more of a test of my writing rather than musical scouting and analysis, so that's what I'll focus on, and attempt two albums a week till the end of the year.\n\nRight, enough of that (it's mostly for my own records). Let's have some words and musics.\n\nTitle - Artist (Year)\n\nดีอะ - BNK48 (2021)\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe tenth single album from the Bangkok franchise of the AKB Empire.\n\nThree songs on here including BNK's first original song, rather than an AKB Cover.\n\nWhat's it like?\n\nAn AKB single, only they haven't relied on the work experience kid for the production.\n\nIt's still annoyingly catchy, repetitive j-pop style music. I've not been listening to the music of Thailand for long enough to be able to articulate exactly what the Thai production team have done differently, apart from not adding the tinniness.\n\nWhat's good?\n\nThe title track. ดีอะ, or \"D-ah\" in a close approximation of the transliteration to latin. As I said earlier, it's like an AKB single, but produced...properly? If you're familiar with the Japanese wings of AKB, you'll know what I mean.\n\nTrack three, Only Today (Band Version), sounds like something off the soundtrack for an american teen film / tv series from the early 2000s, which I did not expect.\n\nWhat's less good?\n\nTrack two, ชอบเธอนะ / 好きだ好きだ好きだ / Sukida Sukida Sukida. A cover of a B-Side to AKB's Sustainable from 2019. It's just been translated, sounds like a token effort and retains all the characteristics of the original. Nothing really unique for the thai release\n\nAlbum structure. There's two versions, and they only differ on the version of Only Today included. Band version or acapella version. But hey, that's the business strategy which has sold about 900 bajillion AKB records, so what do I know?\n\nTitle - Artist (Year)\n\nFrimärken - Petra Marklund (2021)\n\nWhat is it?\n\nPetra's first album since she became a mother in 2016.\n\nTen tracks, in Swedish, including 6 previously released as singles.\n\nNew songs are 'Frimärket', 'År det så här det känns att dö' (which should have a question mark there, but it's not on the official title), 'Se mig i ögonen' and 'Farmors händer'.\n\nWhat's it like?\n\nDiverse. You contrast the emotional piano ballad, 'Frimärket' with the driving synth of 'Se mig i ögonen', the soaring vocals of 'Panna mot panna' and the distorted instrumental of 'Pengar'.\n\nIf you're here looking for 200 km/h bops however, you'll be disappointed. This is a Petra Marklund album, not a September album.\n\nWhat's good?\n\nPanna mot panna is my takeaway from this one, as the vocals hit all the right highs and the instrumental and vocal actually work together, which Ive seen too many songs turn away from recently.\n\nDjur is a nice song if you can find the translated lyrics.\n\nThe composition of 'Är det...' is really pleasing too.\n\nWhat's less good?\n\nValue for money. Only four new tracks sounds stingy, but it doesn't seem to be getting a physical release, so nothing really to worry about.\n\nI personally am not much of a fan of the slower ballads, 'Frimärket' and 'Farmors händer', as they just don't have much drama. No, not every ballad can be \"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\", but they could at least try to sound more like 'Du äger...'\n\nTitle - Artist (Year)\n\nSince the World is About to End - Cotoba (2021)\n\nWhat is it?\n\nthe third EP / Mini album from a four piece Korean rock band formed in 2019. Melon describes them as 'Rock/metal, indie music', but I definitely would not use the word 'metal'.\n\nFive songs on here. One is CD only so you'll need to look for it on YouTube. Well, I say songs. 'Goodnight Lilith' has one word, repeated.\n\nWhat's it like?\n\nBBC Radio Six type 'Real music' that would be a support act at a concert in a nightclub basement.\n\nIt's inoffensive, but I don't get the 'end of the world' theme that's claimed in the description.\n\nWhat's good?\n\nGenerally the composition is quite nice.\n\nWhat's less good?\n\nThe mixing. Several parts could benefit from a longer time perfecting the levels.\n\n'Things we looking for' is not only a bad translation (well done spotify), it also drags on a bit.\n\nTitle - Artist (Year)\n\nBaby Flower - Cooing (2021)\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe first mini album / EP from this Korean soloist who débuted late last year with a single album\n\nWhat's it like?\n\nIt's at the crossover point between k-pop and k-indie. She has performed on music shows, so I'll categorise her as K-Pop.\n\nIf you listen to it, indie will definitely be the word in your head.\n\nThere's a nice mix of different sounds and styles.\n\nWhat's good?\n\nProduction.\n\nVocals. Well, I think so, but I'm not the best judge.\n\nWhat's less good?\n\nComposition is a bit basic and some songs rely on the vocals too much. See the second half of 'WoW!!!'\n\nTitle - Artist (Year)\n\nNight, Night, Night. - Josee Hash (2021)\n\nWhat is it?\n\nDébut album from this Korean Rock group, formed in 2019.\n\nSix songs here, all of which are new.\n\nWhat's it like?\n\nA softer rock than one might expect. Especially Sink Into You, which is basically a lullaby.\n\nQuite varied. If you'd like to take a breath from bops 'n' bangers, this may suit you quite well.\n\nWhat's good?\n\nOrion is nicely atmospheric.\n\nI found 5/6 songs pretty enjoyable, although none are essential.\n\nWhat's less good?\n\nProduction on Tequila. There's enough distortion in the vocals that it sounds like they're being played backwards. They might very well be, but I still don't like it.\n\nVocal style. Not sure exactly how to describe the lead singer's tone. It's sort of ethereal but with a harsh edge. It's not Billy Eyelash levels of annoying, but it won't be to everyone's tastes.\n\nTitle - Artist (Year)\n\nExposed - Wiktoria (2021)\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe first album from the multiple Melodifestivalen contestant.\n\nTen tracks here, four of which are new. Two songs are recorded as live.\n\nWhat's it like?\n\nI've never been particularly enamoured with Wiktoria.\n\nI'm still not.\n\nWhat's good?\n\nME (not related to the song by Taylor Swift and somebody else) is a fun song.\n\nShe can belt out pretty well, which works for some of the ballads.\n\nWhat's less good?\n\nShe doesn't have the range. Her management team is yet to fully realise this.\n\nA number of songs sound too similar for my taste.\n\n\"When it's Good It's Amazing\" is 3:04 long. It would have been none the worse if it was 0:45.\n\nWe're back again. I can't be bothered seperating this into months because I can't remember.\n\n[&]\n\nLOONA\n\nFavourite Tracks: PTT (Paint the Town), WOW, Be Honest, Dance On My Own, A Different Night, UR\n\nI don't care that I listed all the songs, I adore all of them. This is such a solid mini album, which I always expected from them. I cried when I heard Haseul sing again!\n\nCOLOR*IZ\n\nIZ*ONE\n\nFavourite Tracks: Colors, O My!, La Vie En Rose, Memory\n\nThe start of my IZ*ONE discography journey. I fell in love with their bsides immediately and have had them on constant rotation. A shame I started stanning after they disbanded I guess.\n\nHEART*IZ\n\nIZ*ONE\n\nFavourite Tracks: Hey Bae I Like It, Highlight, Really Like You, Airplane, I Wanna Be a Cat\n\nThis is probably my favourite mini album of theirs. It's bubbly, sugary and everything that I love. I can't not smile whenever these songs come on. Hey Bae I Like It is apparently one of my most streamed songs lately according to last.fm.\n\nOneiric Diary\n\nIZ*ONE\n\nFavourite Tracks: Pretty, Merry Go Round\n\nWhile it seems like I like this mini less because I put less songs in my favourites, these two songs are some of my absolutely top picks from these girls so...\n\nOne-reeler / Act IV\n\nIZ*ONE\n\nFavourite Tracks: Panorama, Sequence\n\nI need to give this a few more listens. All I know is that Panorama is the superior IZ*ONE title track in my book.\n\ntimeabout;\n\nYUKIKA\n\nFavourite Tracks: Insomnia, Love Month, Secret, PUNG!\n\nI might even like this more than Soul Lady. Everything about the melodies, vocals and vibes in general make me feel so bright and happy.\n\nI Know I'm Funny Haha\n\nFaye Webster\n\nFavourite Tracks: I Know I'm Funny Haha\n\nIt didn't fully click with me but I have returned to a few of the songs occassionally. I enjoyed the vibes and her voice is definitely pretty.\n\nFlowers for Vases / Descansos\n\nHayley Williams\n\nFavourite Tracks: TBD.\n\num, I listened to this on a day where a really traumatic event happened so I literally don't remember it at all. Hopefully I can come back to it soon.\n\nTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOON\n\nGWSN\n\nFavourite Tracks: I Can't Breathe, Like It Hot, e i e i o\n\nI made a list of Kpop albums I've missed this year so I'm trying to catch up with them and this one was fantastic. e i e i o especially. I have it on repeat.\n\nPerfect World\n\nTWICE\n\nFavourite Tracks: Good at Love, Four Leaf Clover, PIECE OF LOVE\n\nIt was decent. I didn't love it but I didn't not enjoy it. I'm honestly not a fan of most of the singles but some of the bsides were fun.\n\nWe are\n\nWeeekly\n\nFavourite Tracks: Tag Me (@Me), Hello, Reality\n\nToday I randomly decided to dig into Weeekly's discography before their next comeback. They really released a stellar mini album from the get go, didn't they? I love that the concept is just fun and bright. Reality was a surprise standout.\n\nWe can\n\nWeeekly\n\nFavourite Tracks: Unnie, Top Secret, Weeekly\n\nI was never that interested in the title track but the bsides really shone here. Another top tier mini from them.\n\nYeah, I've mostly just been listening to kpop. If anyone has any recommendations, I'm open to them!! Kpop or otherwise."
