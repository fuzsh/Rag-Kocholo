What they have released so far is really catchy good pop music.\n\nReminicent of SweetS in sound, this is a typical happy upbeat song that's become a favorite on my playlist since hearing it. Not to be overlooked!</small>\n\n</p>\n\nMISIA\n\n『 Holy Hold Me 』 ~ SNATCH\n\nAlbum - SINGER FOR SINGER Style - Mid-tempo, Festive\n\nLanguage - Japanese\n\nRelease - 2004.12.11\n\nQuality - 192Kbps\n\nRating - ★★★★★\n\nOfficial Website\n\n♪ Profile//\n\nMISIA first debuted in 1998 with the album 'Mother Father Brother Sister', her second album released in January 2000 'LOVE IS THE MESSAGE' sold a record 220,000 copies! MISIA has released six albums to date as well as a handful of remixed and special edition cuts.\n\nShe gradually gained recognition because of her deep and strong vocals, and has risen to become one of Asia's biggest stars. Little is known about MISIA's real character. The name MISIA comes from a combination of her real name, Misaki, and the word 'Asia'. The young artist varies in style from pop, urban and even samples at rock. She is most noticed for her ballads, particularly the song 'Everything' from her 2001 album, Marvelous.\n\n♪ Notes//\n\nMISIA's new seasonally spirited single! To me this is a lot better than some of the other singles taken from the new album.\n\nMISIA seems to be taking her style in a new direction with a mix of genres for SINGER FOR SINGER.\n\nOnce again her great vocals make this song stand out on its own.\n\n</p>\n\n浜崎あゆみ [Hamasaki Ayumi]\n\n『 About You 』 ~ SNATCH\n\nAlbum - MY STORY Style - Pop, Rock\n\nLanguage - Japanese\n\nRelease - 2004.12.15\n\nQuality - 128Kbps\n\nRating - ★★★★☆\n\nOfficial Website\n\n♪ Profile//\n\nHamasaki Ayumi began modeling at a young age age before dropping out of school early to spend her days shopping and nights clubbing. It was while out at a kareoke one fateful night that Ayumi was introduced to record company AVEX producer Matsuura Masato whom, upon spotting the young woman's potential, offered her vocal training classes. Allowing Ayumi the freedom to write her own songs, she was able to express her feelings in a way she had never known before.\n\nHer first two singles tanked, the second two barely reached the top ten, but then 'Love~Destiny~' went straight in at number 1 on the Oricon in April 1999. From then on, it was up, for one of todays biggest and most influencial J-pop idols. Ayumi was the first artist to have four singles simultaneously in the top ten and in 2002 she was named as Japan's highest earning entertainer. Ayumi has won a handful of awards, including MTV Asia Best Artist for 2002.\n\n♪ Notes//\n\nOne of the leaked tracks from Ayu's latest album, MY STORY, and a rumoured single release. I managed to get hold of three of Ayu's new songs, and chose this as what I felt was the best.\n\nReally Ayumi sounding rock pop that demonstrates the reason for her unshattered success. Nice.\n\nSe7en\n\n『 Crazy 』 ~ SNATCH\n\nAlbum - n/a (special digital single) Style - R&B, hip-hop\n\nLanguage - Korean\n\nRelease - 2004.12.01\n\nQuality - High\n\nRating - ★★★★★\n\nOfficial Website\n\n♪ Profile//\n\nSe7en made his debut at the CF of jeans with Jang Dong Gun and Lee Dong Wook March 2003 and later became a solo artist with the release of the album 'Just Listen' with a brand new hip hop style. Record bosses confidently compared him to the likes of Justin Timberlake in vocal terms as well as style. The overall image shot Se7en to success, and he is now one of Korea's most promising young singers at the age of nineteen.\n\nHis recent single 열정 (Passion) was voted single of the year by Korean youths.\n\n♪ Notes//\n\nSe7en's latest single is a digital single. Basically that means you have to buy it online and it cannot be purchased on disc.\n\nThe single was released for download on December 1st and in the first few hours had raked up a whopping 200,000 downloads. That number is still growing.\n\nIts really worth it too! Se7en doesn't disappoint his fans with this hip hop number.\n\n</p>\n\nCHEMISTRY\n\n『 白の吐息 [Shiro no Toiki] 』 ~ SNATCH\n\nAlbum - Hot Chemistry Style - Ballad\n\nLanguage - Japanese\n\nRelease - 2004.12.01\n\nQuality - 192Kbps\n\nRating - ★★★☆☆\n\nOfficial Website\n\n♪ Profile//\n\nCHEMISTRY is an R&B duet consisting of the two members Kaname Kawabata and Yoshikuni Dochin.\n\nProving to be a formidable force in the music industry, both CHEMISTRY's second single and third single \"Point of No Return\" and \"You Go Your Way\" hit the Oricon charts at no. 1 and \"You Go Your Way\" was used as a TV commercial of a Japanese beverage.\n\nThis was just the beginning for one of Japan's most succesful R&B groups.\n\n♪ Notes//\n\nAnother group who've gone all mellow for the holiday season.\n\nIt seems like a ballad that's a little too slow until it gets to the chorus which is really pretty. The composition of the song is really pretty too.\n\nAn overall nice song never the less.\n\n</p>\n\nMINMI\n\n『 Are yu ready? 』 ~ SNATCH\n\nSingle - Are yu ready? Style - R&B\n\nLanguage - Japanese\n\nRelease - 2004.12.08\n\nQuality - 320Kbps\n\nRating - ★★★★☆\n\nOfficial Website\n\n♪ Profile//\n\nMINMI broke into the Japanese urban music scene in August 2002 with the maxi single,'The Perfect Vision'.\n\nMINMI impressed critics with her abilities to write and compose and produce her own work, intergrating sounds from Jamaica with American and Japanese vibes.\n\nBoth her albums 'Miracle' (2003) and 'Imagine' (2004) have proven to be hits.\n\nMINMI conducted her first tour in September 2004.\n\n♪ Notes//\n\nMINMI has incorperated Latin strings into her latest release to create a hypnotic dance vibe. I didn't really like it much at first but it's really grown on me after several plays.\n\n</p>\n\nw-inds.\n\n『 夢の場所へ [Yume no Basho e] 』 ~ SNATCH\n\nSingle - 夢の場所へ Style - Pop\n\nLanguage - Japanese\n\nRelease - 2005.01.01\n\nQuality - 128Kbps\n\nRating - ★★★★★\n\nOfficial Website\n\n♪ Profile//\n\nw-inds. are Ryohei, Keita and Ryuichi, all whom have come from a long way to achieve their success today, it was Keita's [lead vocalist of w-inds.] childhood dream and ambition to become a successful singer and in 1999 at the very young age of 14 he entered 'ASAYAN' idol audition, with his harmonious vocals exceeding to 5 octaves he managed to succeed.

The reason for this early exposure is that w-inds. 14th single is the theme song for the 83rd All Japan High School Soccer Tournament.\n\nA really great song!! =D\n\n</p>\n\nEvery Little Thing\n\n『 恋文 [Koibumi] 』 ~ SNATCH\n\nSingle - 恋文 / good night Style - Pop, Rock\n\nLanguage - Japanese\n\nRelease - 2004.12.15\n\nQuality - 320Kbps\n\nRating - ★★★★☆\n\nOfficial Website\n\n♪ Profile//\n\nThe name Every Little Thing was thought up by Igarashi Mitsuru, keyboardist and founder of the group. The concept of the name is \"Every little thing we have to do the best\".\n\nIgarashi Mitsuru founded E.L.T by teaming up with Kaori Mochida (vocals) and Chiro Ito (guitar) in 1996 to produce their single \"Fell My Heart\". In early 1997, their first album was released which sold a record of over 2 million throughout Japan.\n\ntheir second album created another new record of selling over 3 million copies in Japan. Almost all of ELT singles are up in the Top 10 Oricon chart.\n\n♪ Notes//\n\nE.L.T have gone mellow for their Christmas release. I must say I quite like this song. They are not one of my personal favorite groups but this is rather pretty.\n\n</p>\n\nSM Town\n\n『 창밖을 봐요 Waiting For White Christmas 』 ~ SNATCH\n\nAlbum - WINTER VACATION IN SMTOWN.COM Style - Pop, Festive\n\nLanguage - Korean\n\nRelease - 2000.12.15\n\nQuality - 112Kbps\n\nRating - ★★★★★\n\nOfficial Website\n\n♪ Profile//\n\nSpawning many of the biggest names in Korean pop such as BoA, DBSK, FlytotheSky, S.E.S, ShinHwa and many more, mega successful record company SM Town is a not a force to be reckoned with within Korea's music industry.\n\n♪ Notes//\n\nI don't like SM Town (for personal reasons XD) but they do make some really good music.\n\nThis is pretty old now but I thought it was nice and seasonal! =)\n\nThe track features specifically H.O.T, ShinHwa, FlytotheSky, S.E.S and BoA.\n\nA really happy upbeat Christmas song to get you into the December mood.\n\n</p>\n\n長瀬実夕 [Nagase Miyu]\n\n『 snowy love 』 ~ SNATCH\n\nSingle - snowy love Style - Pop, R&B\n\nLanguage - Japanese\n\nRelease - 2004.12.15\n\nQuality - 128Kbps\n\nRating - ★★★★☆\n\nOfficial Website\n\n♪ Profile//\n\nMiyu, vocalist and guitarist of girl pop rock band ZONE.\n\nThe talented 16 year old has finally released her solo debut single in the genre that she had always been just as fond of, R&B.\n\nWith a brand new image for the new style of her music MIYU releases 'Just 4 your Luv' on December 1st, the single did reasonably well on the charts debuting at number 12 on ORICON.\n\n♪ Notes//\n\nFor those who enjoyed Miyu's first single from the previous update, here's her next single ahead of schedule.=D\n\nThe second installment from the ZONE member proves to be as upeat as the first, with a cool and catchy hook and chorus."
