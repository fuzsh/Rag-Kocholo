        "text": "Jacoby Jones, a former Texans wide receiver and third-round draft pick from Lane College who emerged as a record-setting Super Bowl standout as a kickoff returner for the Baltimore Ravens, died of natural causes, according to a report from the New Orleans Parish Coroner’s office.\n\nIn an email to KPRC 2 from the coroner’s office, the official autopsy reledied from hypertensive cardiovascular disease:\n\nCAUSE(S) OF DEATH: Hypertensive Cardiovascular Disease\n\nMANNER OF DEATH: Natural\n\nJones died in his sleep at 40 years old on July 14, three days after his birthday, at his home in New Orleans.\n\nHe is survived by his mother, Emily, and his son, Jacoby Jr.\n\nWhen Jones died suddenly, his passing triggered deep emotions across the NFL as he was remembered fondly.\n\nOne of his friends and former teammates shared his fond remembrances of Jones and condolences to his mother and son.\n\n“Just extending my sincere condolences to the Jones family,” Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said at the start of training camp. “Jacoby was a teammate of mine here for five years. When you talk about a guy who was fun spirited, loving, caring, great teammate, the dance machine, he was a fun guy to be around.\n\n“He lit up any room that he walked into just with his great spirit. He’ll be truly missed. I was very saddened to hear the news of him passing. Just truly feel sorry for the family and for all of his teammates, all the lives that he has touched. Jacoby, I remember he always did a great job of working in camps and working with kids. He always did an excellent job of doing that. He’ll be missed.”\n\nRyans’ last memory in-person with Jones was when he was honored before the Texans’ playoff loss to the Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium in January.\n\n“He was honored as a Ravens legend, so that was a proud moment for me to see him there honored, another organization, and to see him doing that with his son,” Ryans said. “It was a very special moment. My prayers are with him and praying for God’s strength and comfort for the family.”\n\nSEE ALSO: Former Texans, Ravens wide receiver, Super Bowl standout Jacoby Jones dies\n\n“I loved Jacoby Jones, we all did,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said in a statement. “His spirit enthusiasm and love for people were powerful. He was a light. He was the cherished son of his loving mom, Ms. Emily. They were so close. He was a man of faith.\n\n“My favorite Jacoby personal moment was every time I saw his smiling face full of joy. Rest in peace, Jacoby, in the arms of Jesus.”\n\n“He was the best, he loved everyone,” Sam Gordon, owner of the Beaumont Renegades, told KPRC 2 in a telephone interview. “I think one of the most important things is he was a man of God. He was proud of how much he loved and feared his God. What was most important to him after football was helping the next person in line. He was the most humble and kind person to anybody who gave him the time and needed the time from him.”\n\nJones was known for his speed and playmaking skills as a player, and for his friendly personality off the field. He was living in Missouri City.\n\n“Jacoby was one of the most fun-loving teammates and people I’ve ever been around,” former Texans teammate J.J. Watt wrote on social media. “Always dancing and laughing, with a permanent smile on his face. Gone far, far too soon. R.I.P Jacoby Jones.”\n\nA New Orleans native, Jones helped the Ravens win Super Bowl XLVII at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in 2013 and was named first-team All-Pro that season. He returned a kickoff 108 yards for a touchdown against the San Francisco 49ers for the longest play in Super Bowl history. He also became the first player to catch a touchdown and score on a return in the same Super Bowl.\n\n“My brother, you will truly be missed,” Ravens Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Lewis wrote on social media. “They can’t take the memories and the hard work you put in on and off the football field. You always gave back and always a pillar in the community, a Raven for life. Love ya JJ.”\n\nJones finished his career with 203 receptions for 2,733 yards and 14 touchdowns with 7,628 return yards and nine scores on special teams.\n\nJones played for the Texans from 2007 to 2011 and joined the Ravens as a free agent after being released by the Texans in 2012, playing in Baltimore for three seasons. He later played for the Chargers and Pittsburgh Steelers before retiring from the game on Sept. 29, 2017, signing a one-day contract with the Ravens to retire as a member of the AFC North franchise.\n\nJones was hired this year by the Beaumont Renegades, an indoor football team, as their head coach and offensive coordinator.\n\n“Jacoby was a special football player,” the Renegades said in a statement. “He loved every minute of every game, and he knew that every day was a blessing. But what can be said about Jacoby the football player only scratches the surface of who he was as a man. When you needed someone, he was there. When you called, he answered. When you texted, he responded. It didn’t matter if you were a family member, a close friend, a former coach or teammate, a player he coached.\n\n“What Jacoby loved doing the most was giving back and helping the next generation of kids achieve their dreams and reach their fullest potential. He left no one behind and gave time to every young kid and player that asked for it. Our heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies go out to his family as they work through this sudden and tragic loss.”\n\nJones began coaching in 2018 as the wide receivers coach at his alma mater, Lane College. He coached receivers at Calvert Hall High School in Baltimore and tight ends at Morgan State before being hired in 2022 as the receivers coach at Alabama State.\n\nJones once competed on the Dancing with the Stars television program, partnering with Karina Smirnoff and reaching the finals before finishing in third place.\n\nJones was named to the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Hall of Fame this year and is also in Lane College’s Hall of Fame and his high school Hall of Fame at Marion Abramson in New Orleans.\n\n“My favorite football play was when Jacoby was talking to his mom in the end zone, just before a late-game kickoff return against the Vikings in a snowstorm shootout,” Harbaugh said. “Jacoby then raced to catch the ball and run it back for a touchdown.”"
