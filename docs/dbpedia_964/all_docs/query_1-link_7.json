        "text": "The 4th of July is here, and it's officially time to celebrate the United States of America becoming its own nation. On this summer holiday, we often bust out our best grilling recipes, stock our coolers with cold drinks, and spend the day enjoying family-friendly 4th of July activities that celebrate freedom (and fireworks!). Of course, no gathering is complete without the perfect playlist, which is why we’ve curated this collection of fantastic 4th of July songs. After all the 4th of July is America's birthday, and no one wants a lackluster birthday playlist!\n\nFrom iconic numbers such as “The Star Spangled Banner” to newer bangers like “Party in the U.S.A.,” our 4th of July playlist truly runs the gamut. Whether you’re looking for happy country songs, gritty rock ‘n’ roll, or timeless masterpieces, we’ve rounded up the best of the best and even sourced the most memorable renditions of patriotic songs that have been redone throughout history (Hello, Whitney Houston and Celine Dion!) so that you can belt it out with the best of ‘em.\n\nNow that these top-notch 4th of July songs are ready and waiting to be added to your playlist, you can move on to more time-consuming components of your Independence Day celebration, such as selecting your 4th of July desserts or deciding which BBQ side dishes to serve alongside those hamburgers and hotdogs.\n\nNeed More Independence Day Inspiration?
