They include the song “Leaving Side of Love” (which Tori describes as a love letter to her fans), “Penny on a Rail” (featuring a stunning cajón solo and showing off the band at it’s most playful), and “Tall Towers,” which has become Tori’s most-streamed song on a global scale ever since it was included in the official soundtrack of the hit Netflix series, Sky Rojo. Also included in the collection is the band’s new single, “Adam,” which they debuted live on national Spanish television the day before the concert.\n\nSpeaking of new releases, the album (and book!) Undivided Intention by Richard White will finally be released on July 11th. Tori was proud to have been a part of the project as artistic director and co-producer of this unconventional blues record. In the words of music historian Ramon del Solo upon hearing the album: “Today is your lucky day. You have in your hands a collection of songs that you will listen to many times.”\n\nAnd, big news! Hot on the heels of Tori’s extremely successful Italian tour, Glass Mountain Records is happy to announce its official collaboration with Italian agency Vrec Booking. Thanks to Bruno Giraldo, everyone at the Vrec offices, and all the Italian press who helped to make the tour a success. Look for more Italy concert dates this fall, as well as shows in Zaragoza, Santa Coloma, and more TBA.\n\nItaly Tour, Barcelona in the Round X (Blues Edition), School of Rock, More Shows (14 May 2024)\n\nEver since Tori got back onstage, she hasn’t stopped!\n\nAfter the Roots Music Revival show, she and the band played their first festival since Tori first got sick all those months back, the 100% Girl Power fest at La CIBA in Santa Coloma de Gramenet with Nat Simons, Miss Raissa, and a bunch of other fabulous female-fronted acts; the next day, she and Sergi Estella were both guest artists at the Big Black Rhino band’s album release concert in the Black Music Festival in Salt (Girona). Both fests were sold out. The rest of March and April were filled with concerts and interviews (our favorite was for the Design Meets Life podcast hosted by TV personality Kelli Ellis and radio presenter Lucas Abram), and June promises to be a whirlwind month as well.\n\nItalian fan famiglia! 🇮🇹🎸 Tori will play a string of solo dates in the north of Italy starting the first week of June. After that, she flies back home to host the 10th edition of her Barcelona in the Round concert series at the beautiful El Siglo theater at Mercantic in Sant Cugat. This is a special all-blues edition, featuring Nigerian singer-songwriter Attih Soul and fast-picking’ Argentinian bluesman Chino Swingslide. Other upcoming shows include the Bocamoll concert series, Jamboree Jazz Club, Estiu Tiana Jazz, “Friday Blues” at the MEAM museum, tthe Festa Major de Vilamajor, the Festas de Gràcia, and others. All summer tour dates are here, with more to be announced.\n\nAnd of course, the summer wouldn’t be complete without Tori participating in the annual ongoing education program Santako School of Rock, organized in collaboration with the Universitat de Barcelona. She’ll present a talk on the history of Black America and country music. Other participants include music journalists Jordi Bianciotto, Nando Cruz, Luis Hidalgo, Joan S. Luna, Toni Castarnado, Albert Crespo, musicians Igor Paskual and Karin Asensio, DJ Maria Torras, professor Rafaeel Llorach, and other professionals from the industry. Registration is open now.\n\nLove from the Press — Thank You (6 April 2024)\n\nIf it weren’t for the press, the promo and the production crew, the show could NOT go on. We wanted to give a special shout-out to all the press folks who have helped to spread the word about the Roots Music Revival concert and about Tori’s return to the stage. Thanks for all the support, we couldn’t have done it without you.\n\nAnd of course, a huge thank-you to all our friends, family, fans, Philissa Williams of Thembe Fashions, stylist Natalia García Martín, Pepe Bautista, and everyone else who generally make our music lives possible. Special thanks to Alicia Música and Aupamusic Produccions.\n\nSpeaking of press, tune in to Sants 3 Ràdio tonight at 9pm CET for the second part of a two-part interview with Tori on the program “El Somiatruites.\"\n\nRoots Music Revival: Tori is Back (24 March 2024)\n\nTori is finally back onstage! Her voice continues to recover, but thanks to the assistance of doctors and vocal therapists over the past several months, she’s finally mostly back to where she was before her vocal injury last summer.\n\nAlthough she tested the waters with a few acoustic concerts in January and February, her official return to the stage was the Roots Music Revival concert with the band on March 8th at Luz de Gas, which featured a long list of invited guest artists. The repertoire drew from tunes from Tori’s first four albums from her Nashville and Chicago days, and reflected a return to her musical beginnings. It was a concert extravaganza and a “revival” to be sure — in the sense that the style of music was pure Americana, but was also a personal revival as Tori remembered and paid tribute to the music and musicians who first inspired her.\n\nIn honor of International Women’s Day (which always falls on March 8th), all the invited guests were female voices. They each performed an original song of their own, paying homage to their own musical roots, and also sang a duet with Tori. Each of these duets was a tribute to a notable woman in music, including Dolly Parton, Tina Turner, Lesley Gore, Sinead O’Connor, and more. The concert raised money for a non-profit organization that helps single mothers and survivors of domestic violence, the Anna Bella Foundation.\n\nThe house was packed, it was an intense and incredibly emotional night for everyone involved — thank you to everyone who came out to the show, and to all the artists and other professionals who made the concert possible.\n\nSince then, Tori (solo and with the band) have performed at the Santa Coloma Blues Festival, the Santa Perpetua de Modoga city-wide festival, the Festival 100% Girl Power, and Tori was a guest artist at BigBlack Rhino’s album release concert in the Black Music Festival in Salt (Girona).\n\nStay tuned for more news and concert dates!\n\nInterviews About the Roots Music Revival Concert — Tune in! (11 February 2024)\n\nFeliz domingo! Here are a few of the television and radio interviews Tori and the band have got coming up in the next two weeks, with many more TBA. Most of them are regional (Catalunya), and the interview archives will also be posted online. On March 6th, they’ll be performing live on “Culturas 2,” national Spanish TV.\n\n✨02/13: Canal 4 TV “Barcelonautes” (11h)\n\n✨02/15: Canal 4 TV “Barcelonautes” (11h, replay)\n\n✨02/16: Canal 4 TV “Barcelonautes” (11h, replay)\n\n✨02/17: Canal 4 TV “Barcelonautes” (11h, replay)\n\n✨ 02/19-02/22 TBA: RTVE Ràdio4 “Metròpoli” (21h)\n\n🎸 02/20: Live on Streamyard with BCN Metropolitan Magazine (18h)\n\n✨ 02/20: Ràdio Desvern “Just Blues” (21h)\n\n🎸 02/24: RCE Ràdio “The Club with Lucas” (11:55h)\n\n✨ 02/25: Canal 4 TV “Barcelonautes” (11h, replay)\n\n✨ 02/27: Ràdio Santa Perpètua “Chill Out” (13:30h)\n\n✨ 02/28: Ràdio Cabrera de Mar “Krakatanga” (21:15h)\n\n✨ 02/29: 25TV ”Toni Rovira y Tú” (20h)\n\n✨ 06/03: RTVE2 “Culturas 2” (12h)\n\n✨= in Spanish\n\n🎸= in English\n\nThanks to all the local, regional, and national press who continue to support independent music, and spread the word about Tori’s March 8th concert at Luz de Gas. Tons of magazines, blogs, newspapers and other publications have also been adding their voices to the chorus since she first announced the event, and it means the world to us. A special shout-out to Mondo Sonoro, Ruta 66, TimeOut, Orpheo, Dirty Rock, La Ganzua, Rock FM, Musikalia, Las Furias Magazine, IndyRock, Rock and Roll Army Magazine, Barnafotopress, Histéricas Grabaciones, Insonoro, Cancion a Quemarropa, Exile SH Magazine, Nebraska Music, J-Musind, No Tedetengas, and others for the articles and interviews.\n\nTori back onstage with her band after all these months, collaborating with and promoting other artists, raising money for a great cause — all these things are good for the soul. See you at the show! ❤️\n\nTori Sparks Band: Roots Music Revival with Special Guests (5 January 2024)\n\nJust when you think you know what to expect from the American artist based in Barcelona, she does something completely different. On March 8th, the musical ensemble known for its mix of flamenco fusion offers something different to her fans: Tori returns to her roots. She and her band will perform tunes from her Nashville and Chicago days, as well as some new songs, in a “revival” of her blues, rock, country and Americana roots music like you've never heard it before.\n\nThis concert is doubly meaningful to Tori, as it will be her first concert with the band since last summer, when the singer suffered a serious injury to her vocal cords which was aggravated by a bad case of COVID that she caught while in recovery. She suffered a series of major health problems, and lost her voice completely.\n\nNow, after six months full of doctors, therapists, hospitals, treatments and medications, she triumphantly returns to the stage with this tribute to her musical roots, and also to the city that has welcomed and supported her since her arrival from Nashville, with just two suitcases and a guitar.\n\nAs if all this this weren't enough to make the night a must-see, in honor of International Women's Day (which falls on March 8th) Tori will invite several of her favorite Barcelona-based female artists to join her on stage to show off their own musical roots, in an homage to working women in the world of music, and around the world in general. Guest artists include Afropop powerhouse Marga Mbande, talented country and southern rock singer Jodie Cash, soul diva Nuri Thunder, vocal trio The Sparkles, and more to be announced.\n\nIt’s in this spirit of collaboration that Tori decided that the concert will have a charitable component: a percentage of the profits from tickets sold will go to a non-profit organization, the Ana Bella Foundation. This international network offers support, employment and educational opportunities to single mothers and survivors of gender violence.\n\nThe concert will take place at Luz de Gas and will begin at 9:00pm. Doors open at 8:30pm. VIP and General Admission Tickets are on sale now through Entradium.\n\nAnd in the weeks leading up to the big event, Tori will also play acoustic concerts in the XI Festival de Blues in Santa Coloma de Gramanet, Studio 23 in Tarragona, La Fiesta Mayor de Santa Perpètua de Mogoda, and El Celler in Arenys de Mar.\n\nFirst Shows Back and Winter Plans (3 November 2023)\n\nTori is finally back onstage, with her first concerts and interviews in months! Her voice continues to recover, but thanks to the assistance of various doctors and vocal therapists, it’s is strong enough to get back to work.\n\nDon’t miss her first acoustic show at her favorite Barcelona listening room, El Café Rock and Roll, on November 4th, and the 9th edition of Barcelona in the Round at the El Siglo theater in Sant Cugat on December 3rd. This edition will feature two of the biggest voices in all of Spain: Latin Grammy nominee Carlos Mendoza, and European Blues Challenge winner Jonathan Herrero. And of course, Tori will once again be a part of the Elvis & Friends Benefit Concert at Luz de Gas on January 20th, which last year raised over 6000 euros for a good cause.\n\nShe’s also going to be on the radio several times in November and December, talking about everything from her recent health journey to her plans for a new album with the band in 2024. Details on the upcoming concerts and interviews are here.\n\nA Thousand Thank-Yous and… Cancelled Concerts (31 August 2023)\n\nHello music family! The rest of the summer concerts were spectacular. A big shout-out to the local press, photographers, promoters, technicians, crew, and of course musicians and music fans who made these shows nights to remember.\n\nHowever, these will be Tori’s last shows for a little while. She has had to postpone all concerts through the end of October to give her vocal chords time to recover from an injury that she’s been dealing with since mid-summer. Don’t worry: just like professional athletes sometimes need a few weeks off to let an ankle or a knee heal, singers occasionally have to deal with the same kind of thing. It’s not fun, but it’s part of the job. Tori explains in more detail in this video (in English and Spanish).\n\nThanks for all the support, and see you in the fall!\n\nSummer means ongoing education: If you’re local to Barcelona and are interested in learning more about the current state of the live music scene, the laws that affect it, and possible solutions to current issues, you won’t want to miss the roundtable discussion featuring Tori Sparks, journalist Toni Castarnado, and others on June 13th at Calàbria 66. And on July 14th, Tori will present a brief history of the evolution of American music in a half-concert, half-talk at Can Sisteré in Santa Coloma as a part of the 2023 edition of the Santako School of Rock. The line-up this year features journalists Jordi Bianciotto, Jero Rodríguez, and Albert Crespo, musicians Igor Paskual and The New Raemon, among others.\n\nLife is literary these days! Tori is featured in the new book by Carlos Romagosa, Siete Desconciertos en Londres, (released Sant Jordi’s Day 2023), and was a feartured speaker in the presentation of the new book by journalist Nando Cruz, Macrofestivales: El Agujero Negro de la Música.\n\nAnd in between concerts, talks, and rehearsals, Tori is also in the studio, working on the production of the upcoming album Undivided Intention by New Orleans-born, Tarragona-based blues singer, Richard White. Release date TBA.\n\nEl Mar Electric (Sold Out!), Opening for Eels, La Llorona: El Documental (19 April 2023)\n\nThis Saturday, April 22nd, is the final presentation ofEl Mar Electric at the beautiful theater in Centre Cìvic Sant Pere — the show is sold out, as have been the other four shows in the BDC P23 spring concert cycle. Thanks to everyone who made these concerts so truly special. Other upcoming dates this spring include: Razzmatazz, opening for Eels on April 27th (also sold out), a concert in the Casino de Andorra on May 13th, and more.\n\nAnd one of Tori’s frequent musical collaborators, Joan Hernandez “Pichi,” and his band, Warmup, have just released their first album (self-titled). Tori lent a hand with the revision and translation of the lyrics in English, and is happy to see the album finally released. Congratulations, chicos!\n\nSpring is the season for interviews: Tori was featured in the podcast by Carlos Mol of Orpheo about the Sandman graphic novels by Neil Gaiman, recently converted into a hit Netflix series. Orpheo also did an in-depth interview feature for their program “On the Record,” delving into the El Mar Electric project, and more from the last decade of Tori’s career.\n\nAnd coming soon: La Llorona: El Documental. Right before the pandemic, director Marcel Llorens asked Tori to be a part of a documentary he was making about the song “La Llorona.” In fact, she was his first interview for the film, which ties past to present; historical movements to social upheavals plaguing Mexico today; and of course, it shows how music is inextricably entwined in every part of life in a way that is both personal and universal. All of this is contained within the iconic song that has moved so many over the centuries: “La Llorona.”\n\nLlorens and his team are continuing to build this impressive project brick by brick, frame by frame, and are finally close to announcing a release date. Stay tuned — and in the meantime, check out the trailer.\n\nInternational Women's Day, Live Debates, BCN ITR 8, Germany (27 February 2023)\n\nThanks to Sentir El Blues, Guía de Zaragoza, Aragón Musical and other regional press for all the love and support for the concerts these past weeks! Since Tori has gotten back on her feet, every concert without exception has been sold out. March 17th and April 22nd are the last two concerts in the BDC P23 concert cycle presenting El Mar Electric. The first three filled up quickly, so make sure to reserve your spot soon!\n\nWomen in Music: On March 10th, join Tori Sparks and Afro-soul diva Marga Mbande for a special split bill at Barcelona’s iconic listening room, El Café Rock and Roll.

Nashville-style BCN ITR 8 will take place at the beautiful Teatro El Siglo de Mercantic in Sant Cugat on April 16th. The show will feature Tori Sparks, Enric EZ and Santos Puertas. More info and all Spring concert dates are here.\n\nAs if all that weren’t enough good news — there’s more! Our Germany familia won’t have to “wait no more” — Tori will be back with the whole band this June. Wir sind glücklich. Details to come.\n\nThis was Tori’s first live performance since her surgery, but as it’s not in her nature to sit still for long, there are more coming up this Spring — just don’t be surprised if you see her onstage with a cane! The show must go on! All upcoming concert dates are here, including the concerts in Zaragoza, Arenys de Mar, Santa Coloma, Ulldecona, and beyond — and the series of five concerts where Tori and the band will present El Mar Electric as a part of the BDC P23 spring concert cycle. The first El Mar Electric presentation is February 17th.\n\nAlso coming soon: tons of radio interviews, including Radio Just Desvern, Radio Llavaneres, Radio3Sants, and more, where Tori will talk about the El Mar Electric project and how it feels to finally be back on the road after 2 months in recovery mode.\n\nSpeaking of interviews, the new podcast “La Colleccionista” by ScannerFM in collaboration with CaixaForum+ is a series of long-format interviews with artists, journalists, producers and more, examining the impact of ten of the most iconic albums in rock music history. Tori is in great company with Jordi Turtós, Coco Crespo, Isabel Díaz, Alicia Rodríguez, Joan S. Luna, David Puente, DJ Amable, Eneida Fever, César Lores, and Carlos Medina, as she discusses Radiohead’s iconic album, OK Computer. The podcast series premieres on February 16th.\n\nTickets are on sale now for the Elvis & Friends Benefit Concert at Luz de Gas on January 21st. Tori participates in this non-profit event every January: it’s not only a tribute to the King organized by the ETB and Club Elvis Spain; all the proceeds always go to a good cause. This year, they’re raising money for Setca. The collaborations that happen at this show are the kind that you’ll never see again, as the event brings together over 20 guest artists from different styles and generations. Make sure to get your tickets in advance, as the concert usually sells out.\n\nSpeaking of collaborations and guest appearances, Tori was recently onstage with the rock ’n’ rumba band Alma de Boquerón for the official release of their album, which she helped to produce. Check out a video of their performance, here.\n\nAnd finally, THANK YOU all for continuing to follow Tori Sparks’ and Glass Mountain Records’ musical adventures, year after year. Without our musical collaborators, our crew, our distributors, photographers, videographers, our sound(wo)men, lightning techs, designers, promoters, fans, friends, and music family, none of what we do would be possible.

The seventh edition of the Barcelona in the Round concerts will take place just a few days after the Germany trip ends. The Nashville-style show will take place at the gorgeous El Siglo Theater in Mercantic in Sant Cugat, and will feature Spanish country-rock singer-songwriter Joel Reyes and Uraguayan bluesman Martín Burguez.\n\nSpeaking of concerts, in case you missed some of Tori and the band’s big summer festivals and other gigs, you can check out photos from Sintonizza, Poble Espanyol, and others on her social media.

Along with the release, they present their new live show: ⚡️EL MAR ELECTRIC⚡️.

(14 May 2021)\n\nIn celebration of Tori’s 10th anniversary in Barcelona, she will release a limited-edition vinyl of the album El Mar on Record Store Day 2021. The new single ”The Man Who Sold the World” is included as a bonus digital download, and is just one of the many surprises included in this special version of Tori’s first BCN-era album.\n\nThe album El Mar was a result of a long journey, and not just a physical one. The road from Nashville to Barcelona was marked by a thousand hurdles, a million adventures, at least one or two sea monsters, hundreds of surprises, several dozen tours and countless priceless learning experiences thanks to the amazing people Tori has met along the way.\n\nComing July 17th, 2021. Live presentation at Revolver Records in Barcelona at 5pm CET. Reserve your copy at your favorite independent record store. What is Record Store Day and why is it important? Find out here.\n\nSky Rojo Official Soundtrack + Concert News (26 March 2021)\n\nThe year has started off with a bang! Listen for Tori’s song “Tall Towers” on the official soundtrack of Season 1 of the Netflix series Sky Rojo, the latest project from the creators of Money Heist. The controversial series has held steady at #1 in Spain and in the Top 10 in numerous countries around the world since its release on March 19th.\n\nAnd, concerts! While the Talarn Music Experience and other concerts continue to be pushed back or cancelled, Tori has found a way to offer a few solo concerts with limited seating since the start of the year, including the recent BCNegra Festival 2021. Now, on April 18th, she plays her first live concert with the band since they performed in the Voll-Damm International Jazz Festival last November. Tickets for the concert at La Nau Bostik are on sale now.\n\n2020 Recap + Thank You (31 December 2020)\n\n2020 has been wonderful and terrible. On one hand, we’ve lost people we care about. Many are sick or out of work, or both. Our frontline workers are exhausted. Musicians all over the world suddenly found themselves in quarantine back in March, instead of on the road where they belong — and we’re all missing the days when going to a concert, giving someone a hug, or walking down the street without a mask on was considered a part of normal life. No one knows what the future holds.\n\nBut in spite of it all, good things have happened this year as well. When we asked for your support of the local music community with the compilation album Love in a Time of Quarantine, you gave it. When we asked you to buy virtual tickets for the band’s online streaming concerts or behind-the-scenes music video launch event for“The Man Who Sold the World,” you bought them. You tuned into Tori’s Balcony Concerts week after week in quarantine, writing to say hello from all over the world. You sent us photos wearing your Glass Mountain Records masks while social distancing. You kept in touch. You kept going. You Zoomed with work colleagues and Skyped with friends and family. You found things to laugh about. You didn’t give up. You supported the artists and musicians you love, and you supported each other. You gave us hope.\n\nThis year Tori and her small but mighty team has stayed busy, in spite of 99% of all concerts in promoting her album Wait No More vanishing into thin air. Her collaborations with Metropolitan magazine and ScannerFM radio have supported the local arts scene, and her work with the Musician’s Union has helped in the fight to protect artists’ basic rights in this time of crisis and instability. She helped pioneer the streaming concert movement back in the spring, and she used her interviews by press all over the globe to speak out against injustice.\n\nTori’s voice has been heard in ads for Marcilla Café, Festina Watches featuring actor Gerard Butler, the English-language kids’ television program Kids&Us. Now, she’s gearing up to present her fifth Barcelona In The Round Concert on January 17th, and is in the process of trying to reschedule as many concerts as possible for the coming year. And tune in tomorrow at 11am to Radio Kanal Barcelona, where Tori will be the guest co-host of the annual end-of-the-year program on The Club with Lucas.\n\n2020 has been unprecedented, but it has also shown us who we are. We are fighters. We are rock and rollers. We are not alone, and together we will get through this. We wish you and yours the very best for 2021, and thank you again for everything this past crazy year.\n\nBCN Jazz Festival, US Election Night Performance + Metropolitan Culture Corner (2 November 2020)\n\nAnnouncing Tori’s latest collaboration with Metropolitan magazine: a monthly interview series called the Metropolitan Culture Corner in which Tori has one-on-one conversations with figures from the local, national, and international arts and culture scenes. Check out her introduction video, explaining how and why she came up with the idea for the series, as well as the first several installments featuring actor Lukas Peroš from the Netflix series Money Heist, award-winning author Carlos Zanon, musical icon Dani Nel.lo, and more. Stay tuned for a new MCC interview on the first Monday of every month!\n\nAnd tune in this week for two online concerts: This Tuesday, November 3rd, Tori will perform an acoustic set from her home during the Democrats Abroad Election Night event (1am CET). This coming Sunday, November 8th (11am CET), don’t miss the live broadcast of Tori and the band’s Barcelona International Jazz Festival performance. Though the venue on Sunday will unfortunately be closed to the public due to coronavirus prevention restrictions, the entire show will be streamed from the Palau Robert in real time. Click here to watch.\n\nMusic Video for “The Man Who Sold the World” Released Today (6 October 2020)\n\nTori, known for always seeking own artistic path, has released a new music video for her single recorded in quarantine: a highly personal version of David Bowie's “The Man Who Sold the World.” The video was premiered today in a special first look by rock magazine Mondo Sonoro.\n\nThe video, directed by Sparks herself, is unlike any video she's made for her previous seven albums: it’s a mini-movie constructed like a Russian doll, with worlds within worlds, screens within screens, and a semi-apocalyptic ending that will stick with you. The project mixes video with illustration and animation, thanks to talented visual artist Oscar Perales of OYEME! Studio.\n\nIt plays with the concept of duality, with the feeling of being fractured that is all too prevalent these days. With everything that is going on in the world, it feels like we’re living in an Orwellian universe — 1984 in 2020. The video is a social commentary: on our slavery to technology; on the paranoia generated by our constant need to be plugged in and turned on; on the cage we unwittingly construct around ourselves when we buy into a twisted system.\n\nUsing a song from the year 1970 as a vehicle to comment on modern society, Sparks has purposely utilized images of technology from that same era to illustrate the simultaneous timelessness and timeliness of these ideas.\n\nPart of the reason for launching a complex and ambitious project during a momento of global crisis was to underline the importance of creativity and of community in these difficult times. Tori wanted to involve and promote the people she works with, at a time when many professionals in the world of culture — and in the city in general — are struggling to keep afloat.\n\nFor that reason, she chose to record the video in an iconic Barcelona setting — The Cotton House Hotel in the neighborhood of Eixample — and counted on the creative contribution of many of the incredible professionals with whom she has collaborated in recent years, such as fashion designer Philissa Williams of Thembe Fashions, who created the dress that \"grows\" to have a 10-meter train. OYEME! Studio is the same production company that shot the video of Tori Sparks and her band for the bonus track \"Wade in the Water” from her album La Huerta in 2017. The sound was mixed by Andrés Giraldo from Panaba Studio, who worked with Tori on her live album, Wait No More.\n\nThe song itself was recorded in the middle of quarantine, and the musicians — Javi García, Ramon Vagué, Francisco Guisado \"El Rubio\" and Ignasi Cama — were filmed by Tori with her mobile phone in their own homes when the city was still in Phase 1 of the lockdown.\n\nIn keeping with the idea that all the components of the video needed to be tied into the local community, the “making-of” online event for the music video that Sparks presented on October 4th was a vehicle to raise money for the Banc dels Aliments de Barcelona, ​​contributing towards the local food bank’s fight against hunger exacerbated by the COVID crisis.\n\nVindicating creativity in a time of crisis, using technology to comment on the danger of technology itself, struggling to bring something different to the world of music — this is a timely and visually stunning project that sharply reflects the moment that we are living in.\n\nSee the making of the music video “The Man Who Sold the World” here.\n\nThe Man Who Sold the World: New Single + Music Video (1 September 2020)\n\nComing the first week of October! The new music video for Tori Sparks’s single “The Man Who Sold the World.” This video is special for so many reasons: not only because the song was recorded by Tori and the band while in quarantine, but also because all the people involved in the project are local artists and businesses. We are grateful for the collaboration of illustration, design and production company OYEME!, the historic Cotton House Hotel, local designer Thembe Fashions, recording studio Panaba, and everyone else who has contributed to the project.\n\nAnd on October 4th — the Sunday before the official exclusive screening on the rock magazine MondoSonoro’s website — Tori will offer a sneak-peek first look at the making of the music video with an online Q&A session via Facebook and Instagram, plus an acoustic set streamed live online. During the live session she will be accepting donations — proceeds from the video release will go to benefit the local food bank to help with COVID-19 relief. Click here for more details.\n\nHaven’t heard the new single yet? Listen to and download “The Man Who Sold the World” here.\n\nComing August 7th: A Quarantine Recording (21 July 2020)\n\nDue to the global pandemic, the entire country of Spain was put under mandatory quarantine for over three months. 99% of Tori’s 2020 tour dates in support of her 7th album Wait No More were cancelled, including concerts in Spain, Germany, Morocco, and the United States. In spite of or maybe because of this bad news, Tori and the band decided to make productive use of their time stuck at home.\n\nThey recorded their own particular cover of one of their favorite songs, which they’d first been invited to play at a benefit concert in memory of one of their all-time favorite artists: David Bowie. Ever since, the band has received countless emails and messages asking if and when they would ever release their rock-and-flamenco version of “The Man Who Sold the World.”\n\nTori Sparks’ “The Man Who Sold the World” was recorded in quarantine at five separate apartments scattered throughout the city of Barcelona, each musician rigging up a temporary home studio the best that he or she could in the midst of families and careers thrown into a tailspin due to the shutdown. Tori recorded the vocal track at 2 o’clock in the morning in slippers and pajamas, much to the amusement of her neighbors.\n\n“The world needs music more than ever these days, ” Tori says. “The lyrics also feel particularly appropriate at this moment in time. ‘Who knows, not me. I never lost control. You’re face to face with the man who sold the world.’That could come straight from the mouth of any one of several world leaders right now — the American and Spanish Presidents in particular — who seem to be much more concerned about retaining political control than about lives of their citizens.”\n\nComing August 7th.\n\nNew Tori Masks and Merch + Live Concerts (20 June 2020)\n\nThank you to everyone around the world who tuned into the live streaming concerts in trio and with the full band — even in these troubled times, the show must go on! If you missed the shows, you can check out videos of the full concerts on Tori’s YouTube channel, and Tori’s thank-you videos on Facebook.\n\nEven though the upcoming tours have been cancelled, a few live and online summer shows are bravely popping up to take their place. Tune in online to the streaming benefit concert for animal rescue nonprofit Veu Animal on July 5th featuring various artists, and don’t miss Tori’s in-the-flesh concerts at the Festival Sonna in Huesca and the Jazz Estiu Tiana Festival on August 8th. (Yes, on the same day. Murphy’s Law also applies to rock and roll.) The concert in Zaragoza on July 24th has been rescheduled for October 16th. Advance tickets will be on sale HERE as of September 1st.\n\nAnd! The new Tori Sparks merch is here — including masks!

On Saturday, May 30th Tori will present a very special online concert in trio, accompanied by El Rubio on guitar and Javi García on cajón. More information is here.\n\nThe collection of songs runs the gamut of musical styles, from rock to soul to ska to jazz to blues to pop to rumba. Some songs are world premieres, new singles, or an alternate version of a tune you already know. Others are selections \"from the archives,\" and we guarantee that you will love them all.\n\nSpeaking of the show going on, this week will be Tori’s ninth and final #BalconyConcert for her neighborhood of Horta.\n\nNow that the local quarantine restrictions are slowly being scaled back, Tori will present a great big double-header show: A live set for her neighbors at 8pm CET, up on the ladder on her balcony just like in weeks past. (We’ll see if the police stop by again, like last time!) After that, she will play one hour of music exclusively for her online fans starting at 9pm CET. Both sets will be streamed live on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThank you to Nando Cruz and El Periódico for the full-page article on the Balcony Concerts and their impact on the community. If you’ve missed the shows, you can see a few of the songs from each week posted online here.\n\nIn response to the quarantine and its impact on the musicians in her community, Tori Sparks and Glass Mountain Records are spearheading a compilation album Amor en los Tiempos de Cuarentena (“Love in a Time of Quarantine”). Featuring songs by various artists of different musical styles, each one affected by the cancellations of concerts due to the global coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOur aim is to generate awareness of the urgent situation in which many artists find themselves since the spread of the coronavirus – and to offer you a way to help some of them, via the crowdfunding campaign that she will launch this coming week. Click here to learn more about the project. The show must go on — and with your help, it will!\n\n#BalconyConcerts: Every Saturday since the quarantine began, Tori has offered a free concert from her balcony to do what she can to uplift her neighborhood in these difficult times. She will continue to play each weekend until the quarantine ends, at 8pm immediately following the applause for the city’s health workers. If you don’t live in Horta, don’t worry, The shows will also be broadcast live onInstagram and Facebook. (A short clip from this week’s concert is also on YouTube.) Reports on her “balcony concerts” have shown up in the press in the United States, Spain, Catalunya, even as far away as Thailand. Thanks to everyone who has tuned in, near or far — stay safe and take care.\n\nInternational Radio, Documentaries, Concerts, Producing, More (29 January 2020)\n\nIt’s official: Tori Sparks does not know how to sit still.\n\nSince the start of 2020, she has been interviewed by journalist Marcel Llorens for his upcoming documentary on the song “La Llorona,” filmed in both in Spain and in Mexico; has has been interviewed by multiple radio programs in Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, and Perú; was a guest artist at the sold-out Sigmund Wilder concert at Luz de Gas in Barcelona; helped raise money for ISGlobal Barcelona Institute For Global Health at the annual Elvis Tribute and Benefit Concert organized by ETB and Club Elvis Spain; hosted the sold-out Barcelona In the Round IV concert (bringing Nashville to Barcelona); her live album Wait No More was named one of the Top 10 Albums of the Year by No Solo Cine.\n\nThis week Tori is also lending a hand on the production side of things in the studio on rumba band Alma de Boquerón’s soon-to-be-released fifth album (May 2020).
