        "text": "Misia stated in an interview with EMTG Music that the theme for the album was \"modern soul\".[4] She wanted to take a departure from the ballad-heavy sound of Just Ballade to concentrate on creating an R&B record.[4] Misia cites soul records from past decades as her inspiration, describing a desire to incorporate soulful melodies with a contemporary digital sound to create a fusion.[4]\n\nSoul Quest is Misia's first studio album in over a year and a half. It was released in two distinct formats, one standard edition and a limited two-disc edition featuring a 77-minute non-stop DJ mix of various fan favorite songs, produced by Muro. The album was supported by The Tour of Misia Japan Soul Quest, which started prior to the album's release in February 2011 and was extended through February 2012.[5]"
