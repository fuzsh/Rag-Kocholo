        "text": "Take me back to July 4, 2007\n\nLet's take a stroll down memory lane.\n\nIt is Wednesday, July 4, 2007. Anyone born today will have the star sign Cancer. It is \"Hump Day\", so many are beginning to think about the weekend ahead.\n\nAmerica is celebrating the 4th of July, which means that fireworks are being set off and families are holding barbeques together. The summer of 2007 is in full swing. The weather is warm, and the evenings are brighter than usual. Most schools and colleges are now finished until August or September. The song \"Umbrella\" by Rihanna is at the top of the music charts in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nGeorge W. Bush Jnr. is the President of the United States, and the movie Ratatouille is at the top of the box office. Gordon Brown is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Practically every teenager and adult has a MySpace or Bebo account.\n\nA rock music genre called \"Emo\" is extremely popular at the moment. The genre, which stands for \"emotional hardcore\", has created a subculture of \"Emos\" who dye their hair black and wear thick-framed glasses. Meanwhile, in technology news, more and more people are beginning to use the Internet on their phones. This transition towards mobile Internet has been aided by the recent roll-out of faster 3G networks and the introduction of larger touchscreen phones. It's 2007, so the music charts are being dominated by the likes of Beyonc√©, Rihanna, Jay-Z, Sean Kingston, Soulja Boy and Nelly Furtado.\n\nThe meltdown in the subprime mortgage market is continuing to worry experts. Investment bank Bear Stearns has had to bail out two of its hedge funds. If you were to travel back to this day, notable figures such as Eddie Jamaal Griffin, Luciano Pavarotti, Colin McRae, and Sean Taylor would all still be alive. On TV, people are watching popular shows such as \"The Royle Family\", \"Scrubs\", \"Psych\", and \"Eureka\".\n\nMeanwhile, gamers are playing titles such as \"Dead Rising\", \"Resistance: Fall of Man\", \"Wii Sports\", and \"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\". Kids and teenagers are watching TV shows such as \"Dora the Explorer\", \"Postcards from Buster\", \"Go, Diego, Go!\", and \"Wonder Pets!\". Popular toys at the moment include Doctor Dreadful Freaky Food Lab, Magic Glow Doodle Bear, Amazing Amanda (doll), and Pixel Chix."
