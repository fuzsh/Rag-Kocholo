        "text": "I’ve always been interested in the exposure effect, a psychological term that posits how our tastes and preferences are guided by mere exposure. In the beginning of the summer, I tested this effect by subjecting myself to a weekly sit-in listen to the Oricon’s Top Twenty Singles in their entirety, regardless of how many times a single stayed on the charts and how many times I was subjected to the same damn Sakurakou Keionbu songs (“Cagayake! GIRLS” was actually OK). I was diligent for about two months before being plagued by sheer boredom and lack of interest. While I discovered one or two artists that I furthered some research into, the majority of the charts were deeply invested in formula: the acoustic strumming of some up-and-comers, mushy pop by the resident big names, a few enka tunes, and the sugary sweet big band of idols and anime opening themes. Apparently, ’twas not the season for parallel interest in consumers’ buying habits. In addition, my experiment lagged any significant results: I rated songs on a scale from 1 to 5 and without looking at the previous ratings, continually rated them each week. Aside from a few songs that vacillated between two numbers or that I enjoyed a lot, most ratings were consistently in the 2.5 range. Songs: you cannot repeat-listen yourself into loving them. You can however, repeat-listen yourself into dislike or becoming indifferent.\n\nAlbums by the Rolling Stones are similar. I feel like if I were going to rate them, I would give them 5 out of 10 across the board. They have a few great songs, a lot of good songs, and a whole lot of over played songs; I like them, I just don’t love them. I’m a huge fan of classic rock so the sheer sound and arrangement of the music appeals to me, but I can’t find myself getting excited over any of it. I’d like to think each and every album has a time and a place in my life somewhere and this just may not be the time for the Rolling Stones, even with a slew of remasters to their name. After all, if the Beatles were going to remaster their entire back catalogue the Rolling Stones would have to get in on it, too, and earlier, releasing most of their albums throughout the summer while the Beatles waited to dump their entire discography in September. The difference is that everybody hyped the Beatles remasters for months, while nobody really cared about the Rolling Stones. Why? Because the Rolling Stones never went away.\n\nLike the sudden death of any superstar in their prime, the Beatles dissolved while talent was still on high, leaving a legacy of worship and nostalgia behind. Think of all those awesome Beatles albums we would have had if they had never broken up! The Beatles cashed in during infallibility, leaving poor records and backlash a mere glimmer of mystery. That’s not to say they don’t deserve the fame and recognition: they’re the freaking Beatles. But unlike most bands, almost every single one of their albums carry the distinction of greatness and we’ll almost never hear a critic proclaim the superiority of their early, middle, or late periods aside from personal preference: across the board, they pretty much always get 10 out of 10. But for the Rolling Stones, the 60s was just the beginning. The first eleven albums are an oral record of their introduction to the world of fame and a sentimental footnote to their work in the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, the 00s… These rock n’ roll relics just don’t expire. They were plagued by tabloid scandal, attacks of unoriginality, and accused of falling lifeless. Paul McCartney may have died in 1966 but apparently the Stones died in 1980 when they released Emotional Rescue – says Ariel Swartley: “the Stones have actually died and this word-per feet, classic-sounding, spiritless record is a message from the grave.” AllMusic was a touch kinder, skewing the playground rock versus disco spat by calling the dance-inspired tracks “sexy disco-rock” (sexy in front of anything makes it OK, try it: sexy terrorists! sexy homophobia!), although this particular album is entirely omitted from their Classic Rock Required Listening Guide.\n\nEven so, all of their albums are worth a listen, if only to acquaint yourself with albums you would be ridiculed for never hearing. The 13 remasters of their most recent work is a good a time as any (Exile will arrive later in the year, just in time for shopping season!), though you’ll probably recognize a lot of the songs in the same way everybody knows that “Harden My Heart” song but nobody knows the band that wrote it. If you listen to it long enough you’ll probably get it. You’ll probably even like it: the Rolling Stones had perfected their formula early enough to warrant ample imitation on most of these discs, and with enough exposure you might even learn to love it. Maybe.\n\n“Hollywood is a place where they’ll pay you a thousand dollars for a kiss and fifty cents for your soul.”\n\nWhile the rest of the world was watching Kanye West make an ass out of himself last night, I was busy catching up on some albums and watching the Old Hollywood promotional blitz for Lee Jung Hyun’s comeback mini-album Avaholic. I listened to the album back in May when it was released and was sincerely disappointed. A long time fan of Lee’s eccentric techno, I’ve come to love the beautiful mess of her shrill voice and high-pitched attempts at rap. I loved the tribal influence on I Love Natural and the traditional Spanish instrumentation on Passion. But for all its purported hip-hop influence, Fantastic Girl had all the toughness of a mewling kitten and the street sense of a Hall & Oates single. After three years, my expectations were pretty high and the failure to deliver on even five full-length tracks was a rude wake-up call; Lee Jung Hyun: No longer awesome.\n\nBut when I stumbled upon a couple of performance videos for “Vogue Girl” (or “Vogue It Girl” as the television shows call them), I was forced to reassess my initial response. OK, so Avaholic, as a whole, is still sub-par pop, but “Vogue Girl” is extremely fun and fits right into the mold of current electro-inspired Korean hip-pop. It’s got a great beat and sassy attitude and if the satire is intentional, it’s kind of genius.\n\nSome of the performances have Lee spoofing Classic Hollywood cinema, namely as Audrey Hepburn (Roman Holiday, Breakfast at Tiffany’s) and Marilyn Monroe (The Seven Year Itch, although the opening clip they used was from Some Like it Hot – a totally different, declining-health Monroe). But even after watching something like ten of these performances, the song began to seem a bit hokey and even the Hollywood schtick seemed slightly bizarre. Lee Jung Hyun is a beautiful Asian woman, so why the exultation of a platinum blonde stereotype? My hope is that the whole concept pokes fun at these pedestaled institutions of fashion and beauty, although the lyrics of the song are so vague it’s hard to debate. But let’s give her the benefit of the doubt and operate under those terms, that she’s not just having fun playing dress up but that she really does have something to say. Take for example the lines “Making, making / an image that I don’t even know” and the playful, mocking call of “Baby, don’t you wanna wanna be a di li di di di, it girl?” as if she’s some sort of sleazy publicist. But she’s not; she’s dressed as the product of misogynistic Hollywood studios, going through the motions of the winks and the ultra-feminine poses, while playing the preening starlet who’s aware of and very satisfied with the use she can get out of her sexuality; in promotional photo shoots, it goes further back historically as she dons the heavily tiered powdered wigs of a Marie Antoinette inspired get-up. The implications are brilliant in a way I’ve seen rarely expressed by a pop star, particularly an Asian one who has more to lose with the world’s obsession with Western women’s beauty standards.\n\nBut though those are the central concerns, it’s more than that: using Classic Hollywood figures attacks one of the biggest industries to fuel the obsession with a woman’s appearance. And while many might just see Marilyn Monroe as the classic embodiment of femme fatal or condemn her role as a willing play-thing of big-wigs and casting directors, there’s really something very vulnerable and sad about her entire existence that demands a sympathetic eye-opener to the strings that manipulated her every move, abandoned her during her weakest moment, and allowed her life to end so tragically and alone.\n\nBut if Lee is attempting to make a big statement, she’s not very good at following up on it: the rest of her performances of “Vogue Girl” drop the Hollywood act and feature her seemingly just as flawless and airbrushed as her fickle public demands and generally embodying whatever stereotype I thought she was making fun of up until that point. Perhaps it’s wishful thinking to ruminate on the possible satire in the those few moments of promotional brilliance, or maybe it’s just another culture she’s almost fetishizing in the likes of her past fascinations with Native American and Spanish cultures, but I’d like to think it’s one more positive, albeit brief, message that managed to slip through the cracks.\n\nBLACK DIAMOND PV ░ [ View ]\n\nThere are fewer things as both wonderful and tragic as a mediocre artist rocketed into outstanding after a collaboration with one of Japan’s most successful veterans of pop. “BLACK DIAMOND,” a collaboration between DOUBLE, the Japanese “Queen of R&B” and Namie Amuro, the Japanese “Queen of Hip-Pop” is essentially a song that doesn’t even come alive until the chorus charges in and the number is accompanied by a fancy setting, both glamorous and impossible, fashionistas draped in couture and of course, a snappy little dance number to promote THE BEST COLLABORATIONS, a collection of DOUBLE’s most successful duets with the likes of Lupe Fiasco, AI and of course, ZEEBRA, the jack of all Japanese collabs.\n\nBeside the questionable dynamic of incestuous collaborations between artists, what strikes me as most interesting is the recent influx of collabs to begin with and the level in which artists seem to grasp at them when in dire need of resuscitation. It’s nothing new, certainly, but with longtime artists like Madonna and Timbaland, Anna Tsuchiya and AI, and Ami Suzuki and Yasutaka Nakata, even artists who have built their entire careers on being one woman-shows are bringing in artists from different genre pools in a hope to reach a wider, and sometimes newer, audience. What we end up with is the “4 Minutes” effect, where an artist becomes the guest to his or her own party, another “featuring” in everything but print.\n\nDOUBLE, too, is veritably superfluous on her own track to the point where, assuming no prior knowledge, the music video is less equal parts anything than a promotional spot for Amuro’s newest single. Not to discredit DOUBLE’s enthusiastic thrusting where Amuro nonchalantly phones in dance moves, but providing breathy sounds and echoes is hardly headlining business. The song rests on the smooth harmonics of the chorus, a brilliant move where each solo give and take seems more a competitive sing-off than a healthy vocal blend (and it’s never a dance-off, not when the two can’t even find it within themselves to sync). Espousing the merits of the thrashing synths and bubbling bass is moot when both are now synonymous with both artists anyway: it’s all there and it’s all timed to make sure the song is more everything than whatever its counterpart plans to be on May 28 when it comes out (I’m guessing MISIA).\n\nBut if collabs are only meant to provide an extra boost for 4 minutes, where does that leave fans of the song and not the singer? Is it fair to take the Suzuki route and push your luck a second time, hoping a Part II will keep interest piqued? At which point does it stop being interest in the artist and start being interest in the collaborator…and should it even matter?\n\nSome faithful readers might have noticed that I completely bypassed doing a review of Ayumi Hamasaki’s latest single glitter which was released back in July (but I did mention it!). This is because despite the fact that Hamasaki is still one of the few artists I genuinely anticipate new releases from on a consistent basis, glitter was almost epic in its mediocrity. Despite its huge promotion and accompanying mini movies filmed in Hong Kong and starring famous actor Shawn Yue, “glitter” bordered on the very thin line known as dull and the accompanying track “fated” almost teetered straight into insipid.\n\nHowever, now that Hamasaki’s schedule seems to be a bit clearer (first Asia Tour is over, relationship with boyfriend of several years kaput), she finally has time to focus on the musical aspect of her career, more specifically, the singles which she once released on a practically bi-seasonal basis. Although talkin’ 2 myself (which features a c/w track entitled “delicious”) isn’t set to be released until September 19, the title track has already been leaked in low quality. And without sounding too much like an overzealous fan-girl, I will attempt to coherently illustrate the sheer awesomeness of this song.\n\n“talkin’ 2 myself” is a return to the rock roots that Hamasaki planted beginning with third album Duty and continued to flourish with in I am… and even RAINBOW. Unfortunately, the poppier songs had begun to take over once again, leaving original tracks laced with one or two “is this LOVE?”’s among the more synth-like tracks (with a trail of somewhat lackluster albums in its wake). However, I guarantee this song will take you back to “evolution” and “UNITE!” era Hamasaki in a heartbeat (it helps that Hshe has, for some reason, cut and styled her hair to the exact same haircut she sported back in ‘01 during the DOME TOUR and the beginning of her outrageous fame). Yes, the guitars are a bit generic (umm, Dir en grey’s “DRAIN AWAY” anyone?) but the song has so many waves, it’s hard not to dismiss the generic and embrace the unique play between the electric synth quality of the track and the organic orchestral tones.\n\nOn a final note, the lyrics bear suspicious resemblance to Hamasaki’s earlier work as well: nothing says “evolution” like “We must go on making our own decisions” and the self-flagellation of “If you should have the feeling of being unfulfilled / That’s something you brought upon yourself.” Good to see you again Ayu, we missed you.\n\nAyumi Hamasaki / talkin’ 2 myself / September 19, 2007\n\nOne of the worst side-effects to writing music criticisms is the lack of total abandonment I allow myself when listening to a record (is Ayumi Hamasaki’s LOVEppears really the greatest pop album of all time? No, but in 1999 I thought it was). There’s something to be said of the fact that before I started this website, or the ones like it before, I was, and still am, first and foremost, a fan of music, rather than that jerk who pretends she knows what she’s talking about when she writes things like ‘Achtung Baby-era U2′ or, ‘sounds like Joy Division’s “Love Will Tear Us Apart” without the catchy chorus and deadpan vocals.’ I used to judge albums rather simply: did I like it right away? how many listens did it take before I liked it? how does it make me feel? is the lead singer hot? Of course, in serious criticism, nobody cares about any of those things (I’m kidding about that last one, by the way), especially not how the writer didn’t enjoy the music so much but gave the record an eight out of ten because he drove his wife and newborn baby home from the hospital listening to it. And furthermore, in the age of computer downloading, when your next album is already in the queue, there is no longer any need to make yourself like an album simply because you spent hard-earned lawn-mowing money on it and won’t be able to purchase anything new in another five weeks.\n\nI’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy the perks of the Internet, but I do miss those days of finding an album and though disliking it upon first listen, having the time and patience to get to know its quirks and appreciate them gradually. Unless it really sucked right away, then I just pissed and moaned for days about wasting money on it. I mean yeah, it would be great if I loved every single piece of music I ever heard and could wax poetical on the carefully constructed single “Easy Breezy” by Japanese pop star Hikaru Utada (maybe, ‘when Utada croons “You’re easy breezy / and I’m Japanesey” the goose bumps did rise and the soul of Edgar Allen Poe, whom she addresses later in the album, seemed to rise in spirit as she seemingly dictates the words of her muse’), but I can’t love everything.\n\nEnter the perks of writing musical criticisms: the ability to look beyond the total abandonment of sense and direction, to see where the music truly lies in relation to its peers, its own discography, and ok yeah, the personal agenda of its listener. Music is basically a solo activity, no doubt about it. And without kids staying home on Saturday nights, popping in CDs (edit later: hooking iPod up to the speakers), and setting it on full volume, where would the great fans of music be? I guess in the clubs dancing away their blues or attempting to catch the eye of a cute girl, or in the car driving home after a long day of work with a preferred station playing, or maybe even in an elevator waiting for the doors to pop open. It doesn’t matter; alone or in large groups of people; nobody is hearing a song in the exact same way as the person next to them. I call this simple physics; two existing forms of matter can never exist in the same place at the same time without disastrous consequences.\n\nSo that was going to be the introduction to my long, pointless Top 100 Albums list where I would I bitch and moan about artists who haven’t released any solid records since MY STORY, but it seems (reluctantly, but willingly), a fitting introduction to the June 26th announcement of Depeche Mode vocalist Dave Gahan’s second solo album, Hourglass. The official stats: will be released October 22, this year. The worries: none, DM will be working on their next album in the Spring of 2008. But seriously: I’m excited.\n\nDepeche Mode is one of those bands that I still manage to listen to with total abandonment; ok, maybe in the grand scheme of things they’re not all that great, though my mind refuses to acknowledge this completely and instead, pegs them as forerunners to the young’uns of today who can only dream of Gore’s ability to pen the ultimate in singles and albums on a steady basis. But I love them, and in an almost freaky fifteen-year-old teeny-bopper way, worship the ground they mix their music on. But Dave Gahan’s solo work is another story: total abandonment? Hardly. It’s with a more critical ear that I listened to his debut solo project Paper Monsters, a still heavily DM-like album, but with lots less synth and more post-heroin confessions (it would almost be totally un-DM like if it didn’t make you depressed, but alas…). Sure, I liked the album, and yes, I’m definitely anticipating the upcoming album, but will I listen to it with the same sense of awe I get of loving the album before I even hear it like I already do their next DM collaboration? Eh. However, if they’re anything like his three recent contributions to DM’s “Playing the Angel” (for the record – “Suffer Well,” “I Want it All,” and “Nothing’s Impossible”), it has potential to cut the Hell out of Paper Monsters. The bad news? Book-by-its-cover judgment with song titles like “Down,” “Tomorrow,” and “Miracles.” Booo-ring (sorry, I’m just keepin’ it real here).\n\nReaders might have noticed my recent infatuation with Australia’s electronic-synth-pop trio Cut Copy as of late. Though the release of their latest EP, Bright Like Neon Love was released in 2004, they still managed to win my vote for best album of 2006. After all, when I think of that year, I inevitably think of “That Was Just a Dream” and “Zap Zap” (and being stood up by a guy who used the word “uber” without irony; I cried about that for like, a second). However, because the release was back in 2004, Cut Copy hadn’t been touring, nor releasing too much new material. Sure, they remixed plenty of tracks in the meantime, including a spectacular rendition of Van She’s already insanely dance rockish tune “Kelly,” but what about new music?\n\nFortunately, as early as the Spring of 2007, Cut Copy posted a new song on their MySpace entitled “Hearts on Fire,” and like their electronic inspirations, it is la merde (that’s French for ‘the shit’, by the way, ’cause dropping hoity-toity French words is how I roll…that and using words like hoity-toity. Sans irony). Sure, the song follows the same formula as previous hits; lots of one liners repeating nonstop, a heavy bass line, and a New Order reminiscent guitar melody that brings the song to a close, but this detracts little from the impact and overall transcendent quality inherent in its simplicity. Yes, I just said transcendent about a little ditty with the same title as the Rocky IV closing theme (insert a really bad joke about how this song packs a mean punch). However, this is just a preview to the new album Cut Copy will be releasing in March, and if it’s anything like this song, I can guarantee it’ll kick your ass, roll you in carpet, and set you on fire. No official title or track listing has been posted yet, but you can always check out the blog for further updates, tour information, and the chance to purchase extremely overpriced T-shirts that does not even have the band’s name on it (seriously, who is doing the PR on that thing?).\n\nAfter a string of lackluster releases in the Spring and an absence of releases from some of my favorite artists, the summer is finally lookin’ up thanks to Japan‘s pop princesses (and yes, I am leaving out Koda Kumi and Ai Otsuka on purpose)…\n\nIt’s extremely uncommon for Ayumi Hamasaki to go on unofficial “hiatus,” and by that I mean, of course, release anything more than three or four months apart. For the past eight years of her career, Hamasaki has exclusively released tracks within months of each other, either through the medium of singles, remix albums, compilations, or albums. However, following the release of February’s A BEST 2, Hamasaki has ceased to release any new material, instead, spending her time touring outside of Japan in Asia for the first time. As her rigorous concert schedule has taken up most of her time this Spring, fans back home were left pining for new material. Fortunately, it has recently been announced that Hamasaki will release her obligatory summer single on July 18. Although the tracklist is still unconfirmed, it will contain at least two new songs, “glitter” and “fated,” both used in conjuncture with advertising conglomerates (a commercial tie-in for “glitter,” while “fated” will be used in the trailers and as the theme of upcoming movie Ghost Story – I don’t know much about the movie, but you can always check out the official site).\n\nAlready fans are speculating about the mood of the songs, as Hamasaki is known for her upbeat and almost nauseatingly summery releases, complete with promotional videos shot teeming with beach scenes and panoramic views of oceans. However, judging by the preview of “fated,” fans should rest assured about at least one half of the single, a slower number outside of “july 1st” or “BLUE BIRD” sentiment.\n\n♫ Kiss & Cry\n\nHikaru Utada is also slated to officially release a new single in July, however, the single was already up for grabs at Japan’s iTunes on May 31 and has subsequently made its rounds on the Internet. This song is notable for having an opening big-band orchestra feel with heavy drum beats…and most surprisingly, segueways into the melody of “Hotel Lobby,” a song already featured on Utada’s 2004 American crossover album EXODUS.\n\nAs per her last few lyrics, the song deals with themes like love that are universal despite a person’s background (“Delinquents, model students, teachers / are all the same when they fall in love“) and also, in vain of “Keep Tryin’,” comments, tongue-in-cheek, on the present face of society (“Dad’s layoff, brother’s internet, mom’s on a diet, diet, diet“). The official single will also contain a second song that fans will have to wait to hear.\n\n♫ Hide & Seek\n\nAnd finally, in order to finish our big J-pop princess releases, I can’t fail to mention Namie Amuro’s new album, PLAY, set to be released at the end of June. Amuro’s last album, Queen of Hip-Pop made a big splash as the follow up to 2003’s STYLE, and contributed to the changing style of Amuro’s music which now centers around, what else? American-style hip hop, complete with imitations of Lil’ John’s “YEAH!” Since the album, Amuro has released a string of successful singles like “White Light,” “CAN’T SLEEP, CAN’T EAT, I’M SICK,” and most recently “FUNKY TOWN,” all which are confirmed to be present on the album alongside several new tracks. One new song, “Hide & Seek,” has already been released for radio-play and promotion. The song is another hip hop melody with plenty of synth streaks to round out the less than organic sound best played with high bass. Upbeat and with liberal use of Engrish, the song is bound to please fans of Queen of Hip-Pop."
