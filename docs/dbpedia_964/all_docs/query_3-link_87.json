        "text": "Composition\n\nThe A-side, \"Any Love,\" was written by Misia, while the composition and production were handled by Sinkiroh. The song was inspired by Misia's visit to the Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya.[5] Coming from Ascension, which dealt with the broad themes of life and its origins, Misia wanted to write about something more familiar and close to home, namely love or everyday life.[5] After writing lyrics that seemed too perfect and lacking a sense of reality, Misia felt at a loss and decided to take a trip to Africa, a place she had long wanted to visit.[5] The culture and people left a deep impression on Misia which led her to rewrite \"Any Love.\"[5]\n\nIn an interview with music site Vibe, she commented, \"(the song) was done before I left for Africa, but when I came back I realized there was more that I wanted to say, so I rewrote the lyrics and recorded it over again. In today's society, it's hard to discern between \"reality\" and \"truth\" and I wanted this song to reflect what I think makes them different.\"[7]\n\nWhen asked about the importance of the line \"Honki de aishiteku\" (æ¬æ°ã§æãã¦ã, \"I'll love you for real\"), which is repeated throughout the choruses, Misia elaborated:\n\nWhen I came back to Tokyo, I was taken aback by the contrast between the world I had been living in and the world I had just visited. I didn't know what was real anymore. But as I got back to my friends and family and music, I realized that love is what makes it all real. It's what's needed to distinguish \"reality\" from \"truth.\" The message of the song is that when facing love, you have to take it seriously.[7]\n\nThe B-side, \"Soba ni Ite...,\" was also written by Misia and composed and produced by Sinkiroh. When asked about the song's message, Misia explained:\n\n(\"Soba ni Ite...\") speaks of a message I've wanted to express for a few years now. I think it's great that, with the Internet, cell phones, and e-mail, there are now a variety of ways for us to communicate with each other, but they've somewhat become substitutes for direct interactions. The reason people feel the need to be close to each other is because, as humans, we connect with more than just our eyes or our ears, but with our entire body. We can never be entirely sastified without meeting face-to-face.[7]"
