        "text": "01. TAKE BACK\n\nReleased: December 06, 2000\n\nCharts: #59 / 22,000 copies sold\n\nc/w: Your Song\n\nAlbum: affection\n\nThe thing with Koda Kumi is that she debuted with one of her strongest songs. TAKE BACK is a stellar pop tune with some lighter R&B elements. It’s a bit of an eerie tune due to its synths and while it doesn’t quite explode with power as some of her other earlier songs do, there is a nice relaxed nature that ties in nicely with the cooler arrangement. I actually love the melody, but what really takes the song to the next level is the gorgeous synth line that slithers along throughout the instrumental portions. I wasn’t terribly impressed by this song at first, but dang is not a great song. It’s unfortunate that the B-side (Your Song) isn’t as strong. It continues the relaxed vibe, but focuses more on the R&B elements. I like the verses, but the chorus melody is a bit messy. It has a nice arrangement though. A decent filler, but nothing that I would return to often.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\n02. Trust Your Love\n\nReleased: May 3, 2001\n\nCharts: #18 / 42,000 copies sold\n\nc/w: STILL IN LOVE\n\nAlbum:affection\n\nTrust Your Love was Kumi’s best selling single for much of her early career. It continues the cooler dance-pop/R&B vibe that she opened with “TAKE BACK”. Unfortunately, I don’t find it as strong. The chorus is pretty catchy, but it sort of loses the cooler vibes in the chorus with its harsher delivery. The verses do a great job of bringing this energy though, especially when tied in with the light synths. It’s a funky song and a decent follow-up, just doesn’t quite have the same everlasting charm. The B-side (STILL IN LOVE) is pretty funky. The beat is wicked and I love the return of the eerie synths. I’m actually surprised I never gave this song much a chance before because I can say I enjoy it more than the A-side. It would have been a stellar follow-up to “TAKE BACK”.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\n03. COLOR OF SOUL\n\nReleased: October 3, 2001\n\nCharts: #29 / 12,000 copies sold\n\nc/w: It’s too late\n\nAlbum: affection\n\nIt’s nice that COLOR OF SOUL comes tumbling in with its pop/disco fusion. The song pretty much continues the sexy, but cool vibe of the last two singles and it works with Kumi’s raspier vocals. What sets it apart is that it is definitely the most upbeat track from her at this point. It has a funkiness to the arrangement that gives it a bit of a fun aspect. I do wish the chorus was a little better though. Kumi’s voice is a bit too harsh at times on some of the notes. I always feel excited at first when I hear Kumi doing something R&B and the B-side (It’s too late) is a pretty solid R&B ballad. The only issue with it is that Kumi is trying to yell out the notes, which doesn’t work with the more sensual and calmer vibe of the arrangement.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\n04. So Into You\n\nReleased: March 13, 2002\n\nCharts: #50 / 5,000 copies sold\n\nc/w: n/a\n\nAlbum: affection\n\nThe final single from her debut album, So Into You is a nice continuation of her early work. This time, we get back to something with a gorgeous synth line. I feel like this tune is most similar to her debut track, which is a nice throwback. The chorus is also a bit more on the sexier side of things, although it still retains that smooth R&B coolness. While Kumi’s voice is a bit harsh again, it isn’t as overbearing as in the material from the last single.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\n05. love across the ocean\n\nReleased: July 24, 2002\n\nCharts: #19 / 22,000 copies sold\n\nc/w: the meaning of peace\n\nAlbum: grow into one\n\nI adore love across the ocean. Despite being for a new album, it pretty much continues her first four singles’ sounds. It takes a more aggressive take on things for the chorus and there is a bit of a pop/rock attitude in the arrangement. I love the punch of the melody and it works really well with the guitar heavy backdrop. However, like many of her earlier tunes, the synth line is what really takes me into the song and this one has a great one. The B-side is a self-cover of the meaning of peace, which was released as a special single between Kumi and BoA. The original is a nice tune, but it is a bit too slow. This version gives a great disco flair to it and I love the updated funk.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n06. m·a·z·e\n\nReleased: December 11, 2002\n\nCharts: #25 / 12,000 copies sold\n\nc/w: one\n\nAlbum: grow into one\n\nSurprisingly, I can say that I’ve grown to adore m·a·z·e even more than “love across the ocean”. Here, we get that cool synthed dance/pop sound, but with something a bit darker. The verses are pretty nice and I love how sensual Kumi’s voice sounds here. The chorus goes a bit harder but it doesn’t lose that cooler edge to it. There are times where Kumi has to strain for the notes, but it doesn’t overpower the funky arrangement. The B-side (one) goes for something a bit heavier on the R&B side of things. It’s a nice change up and reminds me of R&B from the late 90’s. It has a bit more punch in its delivery. It’s solid B-side material.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\n07. real Emotion / 1000 no Kotoba (1000の言葉)\n\nReleased: March 5, 2003\n\nCharts: #3 / 281,000 copies sold\n\nc/w: n/a\n\nAlbum: grow into one\n\nThis is the single that launched Kumi’s career and was used as the themes to Final Fantasy X-2. real Emotion has some similar elements that were found in her earlier material, like the cooler pop/dance influences in the arrangement, however we get some stronger disco vibes in the form of synths and the cool beat. I don’t listen to this song that often, but whenever I do return to it, I can find its charms once again. The chorus is catchy and the simple “What can I do for you?” hook is is just infectious. The only thing that can outdo it for me is the second A-side. 1000 no Kotoba is Kumi’s first ballad A-side and it one of her best songs. It has a slower vibe to it and can start off rather slow and dull, but there is a sincerity in Kumi’s vocal delivery that really keeps it interesting. The life of the song is in the chorus though. The energy picks up and we get a stronger orchestral arrangement that really soars that emotional melody. Stunning tune.\n\nRating: 9/10 (real Emotion), 10/10 (1000 no Kotoba)\n\n08. COME WITH ME\n\nReleased: August 27, 2003\n\nCharts: #14 / 41,000 copies sold\n\nc/w: n/a\n\nAlbum: feel my mind\n\nAs a follow-up to her biggest hit at the time and a successful second album, Kumi released the disco flavoured COME WITH ME. I’m always on the fence with this one. I love the arrangement and I’ve always been into songs that have stronger disco and funk influences to them. The chorus is pretty fun and quite bright, but it just doesn’t stand out as much to me, especially when compared to the smoother verses. It also doesn’t help she screeches hitting the “Come With Me” line. It’s a cute tune though.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\n09. Gentle Words\n\nReleased: December 10, 2003\n\nCharts: #15 / 27,000 copies sold\n\nc/w: Without Your Love / Saigo no Ame (最後の雨)\n\nAlbum: feel my mind\n\nWhatever happened with the last single was made up for with Gentle Words. We get a slower R&B tune and it’s absolutely stunning. This is one of my favourite songs from Kumi. It has a relaxed vibe to it, but still has the hooks to make it memorable. The music is also really beautiful and has a lightness to it that really lends itself well to the calming melody. Kumi doesn’t try very hard here and her raspy voice really stands out as well. Th first B-side (Without Your Love) is a funky R&B/pop tune and I love the subtle disco influences in the arrangement. The beat is really fun, although I’m not a big fan of the chorus. Weird outside sounds come in and sort of interrupt the energy there. The second B-side (Saigo no Ame) is actually a cover of a Nakanishi Yasushi song. It has a slower R&B vibe to it, although it doesn’t quite have the calmness of the A-side. It’s not a bad song, but I much prefer the original with its more classic pop/rock delivery.\n\nRating: 10/10"
