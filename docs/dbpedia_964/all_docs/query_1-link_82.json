        "text": "Daniel Radcliffe is in Merrily We Roll Along on Broadway.\n\nDaniel Jacob Radcliffe was born on July 23, 1989 in Hammersmith, London, and is, of course, best known for starring as the title character in all eight movies of the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nAt age 10, he made his acting debut in the BBC's TV adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield, playing a young David in the two-part special which aired in 1999. His feature film debut came just two years later in 2001, after being cast as Mark in The Tailor of Panama.\n\nNext, Radcliffe auditioned for the title role in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 2000. The film's director, Chris Columbus, had been impressed with his performance in David Copperfield, and after eight months and several rounds of auditions, he was finally cast to play Harry. The first film in the franchise was released by Warner Bros. in 2001, making Radcliffe into a global star overnight. Over the next 10 years, a further seven movies were released: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban​ (2004), Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix​ (2007), Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009), Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010), and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011).\n\nDuring his Harry Potter years, he also appeared as himself (opposite Ricky Gervais) on the TV series Extras in 2006, as Maps in the film December Boys, and as John Kipling in the TV movie My Boy Jack, both released in 2007. His most notable post-Potter screen credits include The Woman in Black (2012), Kill Your Darlings and Horns (2013), Victor Frankenstein (2015), and Swiss Army Man, Now You See Me 2, and Imperium (2016).\n\nRadcliffe has also established himself as a gifted stage actor on both sides of the Atlantic. He made his West End debut in 2002 as a celebrity guest in the London production of The Play What I Wrote, directed by Kenneth Branagh. His first full-time theatre role was Alan Strang in the spring 2007 West End revival of Equus, which transferred to New York in the fall of 2008, marking his Broadway debut and earning Radcliffe his first Drama Desk Award nomination. In spring 2011, he would make his Broadway musical debut, taking on the role of J. Pierrepont Finch in a revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying from February 2011 to January 2012. His performance earned him a second Drama Desk Award nomination, as well as a Grammy Award nomination in the category of \"Best Musical Theater Album\".\n\nHe returned to the London stage in 2013, playing Billy in a revival of Martin McDonagh's The Cripple of Inishmaan, which transferred to Broadway in the spring of 2014 and resulted in a third Drama Desk Award nomination. In the summer of 2016, he made his Off-Broadway debut as The Writer in The Public Theater's production of Privacy and then returned to the London stage as Rosencrantz in the Old Vic's spring 2017 revival of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead."
