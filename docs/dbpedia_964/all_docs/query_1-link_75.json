        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. – New Mexico distance runner Habtom Samuel has been named the ninth recipient of the Mountain West’s Hal Rothman Sportsmanship Award and first in a decade, the conference announced Tuesday afternoon.\n\nEstablished in 2005-06 and renamed in honor of the late UNLV faculty athletics representative Hal Rothman in 2007, the Mountain West Hal Rothman Sportsmanship Award is presented to a student-athlete in a MW-sponsored sport who has distinguished him or herself through sportsmanship and ethical behavior. The student-athlete also must demonstrate good citizenship outside of the sports-competition setting and be in good academic standing.\n\nSamuel, a freshman from Keren, Eritrea, had a dominant first season for the Lobos, punctuated by a national title in the 10,000-meter run at the 2024 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. That accounted for just one of his five All-America honors in his first year in Albuquerque, as he was the runner-up at the 2023 NCAA Cross Country Championships before finishing fourth in the 5,000-meter run and seventh in the 3,000-meter run at the 2024 NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships. After his title run at the outdoor championships, he would add a sixth-place finish in the 5,000m race.\n\nHe swept the Conference’s postseason awards as the MW Men’s Athlete of the Year for the cross country, indoor and outdoor seasons. He also earned Indoor Performer of the Meet honors at MW Indoor Championships and remains undefeated in MW Championship races.\n\nIn addition to his impressive athletic showing, Samuel demonstrated outstanding character and sportsmanship in his first collegiate season. After he finishes a race, Samuel always finds his competitors and gives them a hug and encouragement. At a home meet this season, in an event with only two people in it, he finished his race, then ran back 200 meters to cheer on his competitor to help him finish.\n\nPerhaps his most noteworthy feat of sportsmanship came at the NCAA West Region Preliminary. Leading the pack early in the 5,000m race, Samuel saw that teammate Vincent Chirchir had fallen off the pace. The rookie stepped aside and dropped 10 places to run with and encourage his fellow Lobo before returning to the front of the pack and winning the race, punching his ticket to the NCAA outdoor championships in the event two days after winning the 10,000m regional title and ensuring he would race for the national title in that event, as well."
