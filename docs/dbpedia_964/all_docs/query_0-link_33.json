Almost Seventeen eventually sold over 400,000 copies and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. Crystal Kay, formerly signed to Epic Records, a sub-label of Sony Music Japan for 12 years, suddenly transferred to Delicious Deli Records, a sub-label of Universal Music Japan in 2011.\n\nAs of April 2021, she has released thirteen albums. Her seventh studio album, All Yours (2007) became Crystal Kay's only number-one release in her career when it debuted on top of the Oricon chart in June 2007. Crystal Kay has sold over two million records in Japan as of 2009. Throughout her career, Crystal Kay has collaborated with M-Flo and BoA, Chemistry as well as other well-known recording artists.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nCrystal Kay was born and raised in Yokohama in Kanagawa Prefecture to a Korean-Japanese mother and an African-American father. Her father was a bassist from New Jersey and a sailor in the United States Navy stationed in Yokosuka, Japan.

As a child, Crystal Kay met artists such as Diana Ross and Bobby Brown through her parents taking her to shows.\n\nCrystal Kay attended Kinnick High School at the Yokosuka military base, and Sophia University. She briefly studied the Korean language in Seoul, learning how to read and write hangul, but does not speak Korean fluently and considers herself to be Japanese. Crystal Kay is fluent in English and Japanese, the latter influencing and making a regular appearance in her songs. She has also studied French. Crystal Kay has cited Janet Jackson, Aaliyah and Michael Jackson as her biggest influences. In Japan she cites the acts of producer Tetsuya Komuro as her J-pop influences, particularly Speed and Namie Amuro.\n\nRecording career\n\n1999–2001: Debut and subsequent image change\n\nCrystal Kay began singing for TV commercials as child from the age of 4.

The single debuted at number 12 and charted for seven weeks, selling 19,615 copies. Crystal Kay's twenty-first single, \"Konna ni Chikaku de...\", was released on February 28, 2007.

The single debuted at number 14 on the Oricon chart and charted for eight weeks, selling 15,158 copies to date. \"Konna ni Chikaku de...\" was performed live for the special Nodame Orchestra concert at the Tokyo International Forum on the single's release date.

She also played the voice of \"Nurse Joy's Chansey\" in the film. The film's producers had apparently been considering the singer since 2001, when she sang \"Lost Child\" with Shinichi Osawa and Hiroshi Fujiwara for the soundtrack of the film Satorare. As expected a single was released. However, it was not the recently announced Pokémon theme song, but a different single entitled \"Namida no Saki ni\". \"Namida no Saki ni\" was released on June 11, 2008. It was Crystal Kay's first single in over a year, since the release of the single \"Anata no Soba de\" on May 16, 2007. \"Namida no Saki\" was used as the CM song for Tully's Coffee commercials throughout June 2008.

The single's b-side, \"Deaeta Kiseki\", was released digitally in December 2008 and was also used as the CM song for Tully's Coffee that month. \"After Love (First Boyfriend)\" / \"Girlfriend\" was Crystal Kay's second double A-side single, and her first since \"Kirakuni\" / \"Together\" in 2006.

Crystal Kay was advised not to go on with the tour in order to rest and recover from her illness. Her record label offered refunds through the tour's website. Crystal Kay later performed at the August 2011 MTV Zushi Fes music festival.\n\nOn April 29, 2011, Crystal Kay held a Q&A on her blog and answered her fans' questions, with one question regarding a possible Korean debut. Considering her mother is of Korean ancestry, she has stated: \"I can speak just a teeny bit of Korean (lol). My reading and writing are perfect, but learning vocabulary is sooo hard! It's no good that I don't do listening or speaking. I'll think about a Korean debut! I'd like to be able to sing in Korean.\"\n\nOn October 5, 2011, Universal Music Group subsidiary label Delicious Deli Records posted an announcement that after twelve years Crystal Kay had left Sony Music Japan and signed to them.\n\nIn 2012, Crystal Kay recorded a cover of \"Eyes on Me\" for the \"FINAL FANTASY Orchestra Album\", becoming the latest in a series of notable artists to cover the song, including Angela Aki, MayBee and Kanon.\n\nIn 2013, the singer participated in DANCE EARTH PARTY's debut single \"Inochi no Rhythm\", part of DANCE EARTH's project DANCE EARTH ~Seimei no Kodo~.

In November of the same year, the singer announced that she moved her management to LDH.\n\nIn January 2015, the singer returned to Japan after a final acoustic concert in New York. Looking back at the time she lived in the United States, she described the experience as a turning point in her life: \"It was the first time I lived alone in New York and the first time I lived abroad. I went there because I wanted to try my hand at music, and although it didn't lead to my debut in the end, I think I learned a lot there and was able to plant some seeds. Anyway, it was a journey to face myself and become stronger. Going to New York was the first time I was able to face my identity crisis, which I had been dealing with since I was a child. I think it was a good thing that I was able to think, 'I should have more confidence in my identity'. The other thing is that people in their late twenties have unique problems. Especially for women, it's the age when they have to worry about work, marriage, and childbirth.\" In terms of music, she succeeded in refining her skills despite not being able to make her international debut: \"My goal was to get a record deal there, but I thought it would be better to actually live there, join the local community, and get to know the producers, so I decided to take the plunge. But it was difficult because I didn't have any connections. I went into the studio every day and wrote over 60 songs, but I was an unknown singer over there. For two years, I went back and forth to Japan, meeting with producers, doing sessions, voice training, dancing, and so on.\" Besides working on her musical career, she also went to acting classes and took an \"overcoming anthropophobia course\" in New York.\n\nOn June 3, she released her first single under LDH's management and 30th single overall, \"Kimi ga Ita Kara\", being also her first single after three years since the release of \"Forever\".\n\nOn September 16, she released her 31st single \"REVOLUTION\", with its title track featuring Amuro Namie.\n\nOn December 16, Crystal Kay released her 11th studio album Shine.\n\nFrom February 12 to March 23, 2016, she held her 9th live tour Crystal Kay LIVE TOUR 2016 \"Shine\".\n\nOn March 23, Crystal Kay released her 32nd single \"Sakura\".\n\nOn September 14, she released her 33rd single \"Lovin' You\".\n\nOn February 13, 25 and March 13, 2017, she held her first Billboard Live concerts in Tokyo and Osaka.\n\nOn June 13, 2018, she released her 12th studio album For You.In 2019, she starred as \"Leading Player\" in the Japanese version of the Broadway musical Pippin, for which she was awarded by the 27th Yomiyuri Theater Awards as best actress.\n\nIn spring 2020, played the role of \"Motormouth Maybelle\" in the Japanese version of the musical Hairspray. On March 17, Kay released her first cover album in fall 2020. \"March 9\", a beloved graduation song in Japan, was pre-released on March 18 as the first track of the album. On April 24, the musical Hairspray was cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\n\nIn the same year, she launched the mental health support project \"All FOUR ONE PROJECT\" together with musicians whom she is close with in order to provide a place where people who are having difficulty living with the COVID-19 pandemic can talk about it in peace. ..... I thought that there are a lot of people who have something on their mind but can't talk about it with anyone. This is because in Japan, mental health care itself is considered taboo, or rather, it is still a bit closed off. I think the mentality of the Japanese people is to work hard until the very last minute, thinking that they shouldn't bother anyone.\", \"I thought it would be nice if there was a place where people who are having a hard time living in the present moment, people who are interested in mental health but don't know how to learn about it, and people who don't know much about mental health itself could participate in a safe environment.\"\n\nOn April 21, 2021, she released her first cover album I SING, which celebrates the 20th anniversary since her debut. Previously, three songs of the album, \"Sangatsu Kokonoka\", \"Utautai no Ballad\" and \"I LOVE...\", had been released as digital singles over the course of 2020. In the same month as the release of the cover album, she was appointed as the brand ambassador to celebrate the 75th anniversary of JBL.\n\nLater that year, she participated in the first season of The Masked Singer Japan under the stage name \"Miss Television\" and finished the show as the runner-up.\n\nOn November 5, she released her 12th digital single \"Hitori ja nai Kara\", which was used as the theme song for the movie DANCING MARY.\n\nOn November 18, she released her 5th English digital single \"Say My Name\" in collaboration with the producer TETSU.\n\nOn March 29, 2022, Crystal Kay performed the national anthem and halftime show for the NBA match \"Washington Wizards vs Chicago Bulls\" together with the professional dance team RIZE Dancers at Capital One Arena, the home of the Washington Wizards, for an event called \"JAPAN NIGHT\".

She debuted in 1999 when R&B began to take off in Japan thanks to local acts MISIA, Double and Hikaru Utada. Her success paved the way for the mainstream success of many mixed-race artists in the mid-2000s (decade) such as Thelma Aoyama and African-American/Japanese enka singer Jero.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2009, Crystal Kay said, \"There is still some racial thing going on, [but] people are getting used to it. You can see a lot more mixed people on TV, and even (among) models in magazines.\" At a summer festival that year, the half-Japanese half-Papua New Guinean singer Emi Maria left Crystal Kay a demo and a note saying, \"You're my idol, I'm sad I couldn't meet you in person.\" Nevertheless, Crystal Kay has said, \"I consider myself a Japanese artist because I was born and raised here, but nationality-wise I look, and am, foreign.\"\n\nIn her life, Crystal Kay had been struggling with her identity and didn't want to stand out: \"I was born and raised in Japan, but I don't have any Japanese blood in my veins (my father is American and my mother is Korean), so I had always had a complex.\", \"There was only one senior I knew who was Korean and Black [...]. They (the others) were all Black and Japanese, or white and Japanese, or half-Japanese. [...] I thought of myself as a minority among the majority.\" However, living in New York between 2013 and 2015 helped her accept her multi-ethnical identity: \"I had this complex that made me shrink back. But when I talked about it in New York, people would say, 'What are you talking about? You're carrying three cultures on your shoulders, and you're building a good career in Japan, isn't that great? You should be more proud of yourself.' I thought, 'That's right'.\" As for her future, she dreams of becoming a \"bridge between countries\": \"It could be through music, a musical, or a movie. I'm also very interested in acting, so I want to be a bridge through entertainment in any genre.\"\n\nCrystal Kay holds American citizenship.\n\nDiscography\n\nMain article: Crystal Kay discography\n\nC.L.L Crystal Lover Light (2000)\n\n637: Always and Forever (2001)\n\nAlmost Seventeen (2002)\n\n4 Real (2003)\n\nCrystal Style (2005)\n\nCall Me Miss...
