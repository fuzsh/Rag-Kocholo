        "text": "Misia was born on July 7, 1978, and grew up on the island of Tsushima in Nagasaki Prefecture, but moved to Fukuoka at the age of 14 to pursue a music career. The Fukuoka music scene is usually associated with rock acts such as Sheena and the Rokkets, Number Girl and Shiina Ringo, but it was gospel and R&B music that influenced her. She started voice training at the age of 15. During high school, she began training with some African-American vocal coaches in gospel and R&B such as Frank Toddy Winfrey, who was her vocal coach from 1994 to 1997.\n\nShe first appeared in 1998 after being spotted at an BMG Japan audition in '97. After that, she gave herself the name \"MISIA\", a combination of \"Misaki\" and \"Asia.\" (or \"Messiah\" and/or \"Asia\"). One of her claims to fame is the ability to cover 5 octaves when singing, something she puts to good use in her songs. To date she has released 12 albums, and though her popularity isn't as huge as some other artists in the same genre, she commands a decent following. While it's common to find MISIA described as an R&B artist, her music has a more soulful, even bluesy, quality to it, something her voice complements well.\n\nShe is one of the few artists in Japan to have never performed on any TV music shows and fewer to be as popular despite this. Her live performances are acclaimed by many. She became the first female solo act that toured the five major domes of Japan in 2004.\n\nIt was announced on May 1, 2007 that MISIA would be leaving avex trax to go back to her former record label, BMG Japan. The first original release on BMG Japan since 2002 was released on July 4, 2007. It was a love song composed by Satoshi Shimano, who also produced her debut hit.\n\nOn September 29, 2007 MISIA held her first overseas concert in Taiwan.\n\nHer next single, Royal Chocolate Flush, was released in December 2007, and the first album since returning to BMG, EIGHTH WORLD, was released in January of 2008."
