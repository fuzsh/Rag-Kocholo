On December 1, MISIA will release her new album, “HELLO LOVE.” This album comes almost exactly three years after her last one, “Life is going on and on.”

“HELLO LOVE” will come in a 2CD limited edition and a CD only regular edition. The second CD that comes with the limited edition will contain remixes.

One of the new songs on MISIA’s upcoming album is “Higher Love”, a collaboration with Fujii Kaze. He composed the song, and participated in its recording, where he was in charge of the organ, piano, and chorus. This is the first time that Kaze has provided music for another artist. “Higher Love” was arranged by trumpeter Kuroda Taku, and features the Harlem Gospel Choir on the chorus.

The collaboration between MISIA and Kaze came about after he attended her 2019 concert in New York. MISIA couldn’t wait to work with him. When thinking of his collaboration with MISIA, “gospel” was the keyword that came to Kaze’s mind.

“Higher Love” was released digitally today. Check out the music video for it below!
