Birth of MISIA☆

MISIA’s parents are both doctors. Her father loved jazz, and her mother loved Western music.

MISIA grew up in Tsushima, Nagasaki, and began to learn piano at the age of 4 under the influence of her elder brother and her elder sister. She is the youngest of 3 children.

She joined the local chorus at the age of 9, and she discovered her 5 octave singing voice while at her older sister’s private music lessons.

From then on she dreamed of becoming a singer and later won a contest in Fukuoka. During junior high and high school she sang and played the trumpet in the brass band club in Fukuoka.

While going to the high school, she also began to go to a music academy and met two African-American vocal trainers there.She began training with them in gospel and R&B.

In May 1997, MISIA finally passed a audition to find a soulful female R&B singer. Misia sang “Goodbye Darlin'” by Dreams Come True and was chosen from about 3,000 candidates.

She decided to pursue a music career instead of school education and took a leave of absence from university. She was conscious of the image of an R&B singer and styled her hair in dreadlocks. She used the stage name “MISIA” at the beginning her music career.

(Her name MISIA is a combination of “Misaki” and “Asia”

Japanese Lesson with song “Aitakute Ima”

Please learn Japanese language…

(just a little bit…)

(^ ^)

“Aitakute Ima” (I want to meet now) is the 23rd single by MISIA and was used as theme song for TV drama series JIN -仁- which was aired in 2009 (2 seasons 11 episodes each).

JIN -仁- is one of the most popular Japanese TV dramas in recent years and won many major awards.

The story is about a brain surgeon who was thrown back in time to 1862 (about 150 years ago), and finding out what the true meaning of being a doctor is.

Although not helpful for the Japanese study (old style language is spoken), the program can be helpful to learn about Japanese history, culture and behavior of the people (^ ^)
