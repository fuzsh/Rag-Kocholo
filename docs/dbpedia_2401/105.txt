The Music Department at Yarra Hills Secondary College offers our students a busy yet exciting performance and events program throughout the year. The ensemble based program offers Instrumental Music lessons in two ways:

Instrumental lessons – given by College Music Staff where students pay an annual levy.

Instruments taught in this category: Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Saxophone, Trumpet, Trombone, French Horn, Euphonium, Tuba, Drum Kit/Percussion

Students who have instrumental music lessons are required to take part in one of the College Concert Bands.

Private instrumental lessons – where lessons are paid for each term by the student/parent/guardian.

Instruments taught in this category: Singing, Piano, Guitar and Bass Guitar

Students learning to play a Musical Instrument are required to be play in one of the College Concert Bands: Junior Band for Year 7 musicians, Intermediate Band and/or the Senior Concert Band. Performances throughout each year include College assemblies, Open Evenings, Awards Nights, local community festivals and school fetes, as well as Primary School concerts and our own College Concert.

There are various other music related activities also on offer for our young musicians, including Music Camps and tours, plus fundraising activities such as the 30 hour Music Marathon.
