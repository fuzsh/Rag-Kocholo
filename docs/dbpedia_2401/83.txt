We, the students at Ringwood Secondary College, acknowledge the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation as the traditional custodians of the land we are meeting on today.

We appreciate the waterways, mountains, skies, plants and animals from this land and thank our ancestors for their ceremonies of story-telling, music, dance and celebration.

We pay our respects to elders past, present and emerging and promise to learn to live in a community that is part of the oldest living culture on Earth and move forwards together to a place of equity, justice and partnership.

We recognise that First Nations sovereignty was never ceded. This was and always will be Aboriginal Land.
