        "text": "No Tricks, Just Treats: Our Fang-tastic Halloween Newsletter!\n\nThis week saw a lot of excitement around the celebrations of Halloween and the Day of the Dead. But amongst the buzz of the week, one might have found themself pondering the history and traditions behind these holidays.\n\nHalloween, as we now know it today, originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts because it was believed that from the 31st of Oct to the 2nd Nov a veil between the natural and supernatural worlds dropped, allowing the spirits of the dead and denizens of the otherworld access to both worlds. There was also a day on November the 1st called All Saints Day to honor all saints of the Celtic religion. The evening before was known as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, wearing costumes, watching spooky movies, and eating sweet treats. This is the day we have all come to love and enjoy but it's important to remember its origins and why we celebrate it.\n\nLikewise, The Day of the Dead (el Día de los Muertos), is a Mexican holiday that many people love and cherish. Where families welcome back the souls of their deceased relatives for a brief reunion that includes food, drink, and celebration. This festival dates back over 3,000 years to pre-Columbia Mesoamerica, where the Aztecs and other Nahua people saw death as part of life and something worth celebrating. It is said that on these days the gates of heaven are opened at midnight on October 31 and the spirits of children can rejoin their families for 24 hours before having to return.\n\nSo what did TC do to celebrate these fun-filled historic events?\n\nOn the 31st of October, people dressed up in costumes to show their love for the Halloween holiday and get interested and involved with the school community! \"It does good for the students to see the staff joining in, see them as more than just their subject teacher. We had zombies, clowns, ghosts, vampires, the undead, Eric Cartman (Southpark), pixies, cats, musicians, and much more.\" Said Duncan in an interview.\n\nA Halloween party was held in S-Wing where lollies were given out and individual, as well as group photos, were taken. \" I dressed up as a zombie nurse,\" Duncan explained. The TC Halloween activities forms part of the community activities students are encouraged to take part in throughout the year. Duncan highlights \"We celebrate dress-up days to have fun and help students feel like they are part of a supportive and interested Community.\" The photos have been put up in B-Wing to check out. TC has still got the Art, Dodgeball, Gaming, and Badminton Community Competitions coming up this term to get involved with!\n\nStay Spooky 🦇\n\nBy Ruby Egan-Douglas\n\nTC Journalist\n\nLast Weeks Announcements\n\n2024 School Captain Process - An Update\n\nNo Classes Running on Monday 6th November\n\n2024 Timetable Update\n\nStaff Recruitment for 2024\n\nCurrent Events in the Middle East\n\n2024 School Captain Process - An Update\n\nThe 2024 School Captain process is well underway!

Please keep an eye out for this if you know of someone who would be a perfect fit to work @ TC as either a teacher or a member of educational support staff. More information, including the specifics of the roles will be released next week.\n\nCurrent Events in the Middle East\n\nThe Department of Education have asked all schools to release a statement on their behalf. This can be found below. We will continue to support all of our students as we continue to support each other as an inclusive school, in line with our safe schools statement, in that we celebrate diversity and inclusion in all forms, be that religion, race, culture, ability, sexuality and gender.\n\nDear parents and carers,\n\nThe ongoing conflict in the Middle East continues to cause distress for staff, students, families and carers, especially those who have family and friends in the region.\n\nOur school is a rich and diverse community and acknowledging that it is vital that our students, staff and families all feel safe and included in everything we do.\n\nI want to assure you that the department is monitoring the situation from a school security perspective.\n\nWhile we want to maintain an open and welcoming environment, we are also being vigilant in terms of safety, ensuring all our procedures, like visitors signing in and out, are being followed.\n\nIf your child is impacted and/or distressed by the current conflict, you may find some aspects of this resource helpful:\n\nHelping my children after trauma: A guide for parents.\n\nSupport is also available through external services including:\n\nheadspace: 1800 650 890\n\nKids Helpline: 1800 551 800\n\nLifeline: 13 11 14\n\nBeyond Blue: 1300 224 636.\n\nPlease feel free to get in contact the school if you would like to discuss this further.\n\nPrevious Weeks Announcements\n\nCongratulations to the graduating class of 2023\n\nChanges to the local bus networks starting on 15 October!\n\nTC Community Market\n\nVictorian Education Excellence Awards - TC Shortlisted!\n\nSave the dates\n\nEnd of Year Arrangements - An Overview\n\nTC and CareNet\n\nTC is working with CareNet to give back to our community by providing food for the vulnerable members of Manningham.\n\n“80 thousand homeless people [in Australia] are on the waiting list to find permanent housing for them and their families,” says Ryley Norris, “Food is obviously a thing that they need, and access to housing and food for these people is almost non-existent…In a position of privilege, it is our duty and responsibility to ensure that every member of society has equal access to housing, food, water, [and] sanitation, that each and every one of us get, and don’t even realise how fortunate we are in having it.”\n\nDuring the month of October, we’re doing a food drive where you can donate non-perishable foods to the community by dropping them in the boxes in S Wing. This includes things like canned food, long-life milk, cereal, and more.\n\nOur very own students may benefit from this partnership too. You could benefit from it. If TC’s relationship with CareNet reaches another level through this Food Drive, Ryley is hoping to “have a collaborative relationship with them whereby we can have students go and pick up food, [and] bring it back to school, so we can make meals as a big student educational program, and then drive around to the food pantries and to Kellie at CareNet, so that she can give this food to the vulnerable members of our community.” This program would be called “Driving with Purpose” because students will be able to gain skills in driving and bring their driving hours up, all while “develop[ing] the skills of cooking in an altruistic endeavour.”\n\nKellie Wishart from CareNet said, \"we are so grateful for our partnership with the Templestowe College community. TC have assisted CareNet with composting throughout the year, and the food drive that is happening right now is of great assistance to us. Currently CareNet is experiencing a rapid increase in families seeking food relief and are expecting a record number to visit us over term 4 and the Christmas period. Community support like this is vital for us being able to meet the need this year. Thank you, Templestowe College.\"\n\nCareNet focuses on Community Food Relief, which is increasing food accessibility for all, and Food Rescue, which is stopping food from going to landfill and instead using it to feed people. According to Ryley, “every year in Australia, there is 7 million tonnes of food waste, 5 million of which is redeemable…70% of that comes from household waste.” And there’s things you can do about this.\n\n“We, the consumer, have the power,” says Ryley. Farmers often throw out a lot of their produce because they know consumers won’t buy blemished food, but by choosing blemished food, such as Coles’ I’mPerfect fruits and vegetables, you can make the difference and prevent that food waste. “On the inside, it’s still going to taste the same, it’s still going to have the same nutritional profile; it’s going to benefit us.”\n\nAnother way you can prevent food waste is to plan out meals with your household members and take stock of what you already have so you don’t over-purchase, and buy all your meals just a week in advance. Remember to research how to properly store your food so your fresh foods don’t go off before you can use them. You can also freeze your leftovers if you don’t think you’ll be able to eat them before their expiry (generally three days). According to the Mayo Clinic Health System, there are many ways you can reuse scraps instead of throwing them out, e.g. “vegetable scraps and peels can be made into soup stock. Apples or blueberries that are soft work perfectly cooked in oatmeal. You can even use stale bread to make croutons or an egg strata. Slightly wilted vegetables are great for soups or stir-fries.”\n\nBut what’s the problem with food waste? Aside from wasting food that could be used to feed our vulnerable community members, not composting food scraps is also “one of the leading contributors to climate change.” Food waste produces methane when left in landfill or when tossed to the ground, and methane is “30x more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.” By composting correctly with a proper compost bin, you’re helping to promote vital plant growth and fight climate change. If you don’t have a compost bin at home, “there are generally bins in our local shires now that will take those compostable food scraps, and then they’ll make it into a commercial composting resource whereby farmers can use that resource. If you don’t have that, there are community gardens right by you, and if you don’t have that, bring it to school. We have so many compost bins at school that…will be beneficial matter to replenish our soils, to feed our planet, and to heal our planet.”\n\nRemember to give back to your community this term.\n\nBy Rory Opie\n\nTC Journalist\n\nDepartment of Education Visibility Project\n\nLast week our TC Journalist’s had the opportunity to shadow Principal Peter Ellis while a film crew from the department of education’s leadership academy were visiting to interview and film him. They were able to interview the interviewees of the project, watch the production process and be involved in filming. Read on to find out more.\n\nPre Interview\n\nOn Thursday, 12 October, a small team arrived at TC to film, and interview Peter Ellis and capture the leadership that the TC community demonstrates. Before the filming started, we had the privilege of interviewing Melanie Edgar and Simone Eirth from the Victorian Academy of Teaching and Leadership, and we asked them what they were hoping to capture in their short film of TC.\n\nOut of twelve schools to interview, TC was the first. Melanie and Simone said that they wanted to capture the 'exceptional leadership', that Peter Ellis and TC display.\n\nWe also asked them what the aim of the filming was, and they replied, 'We want to tell the story of Victoria's highest-quality educators,' They explained that they hoped to use the completed product to 'inform' and 'connect' parents with the understanding of who's in charge of developing the students as they 'progress through their education years'.\n\nOverall, it was a pleasure to speak with such dedicated and passionate educational leaders and I can't wait to see the release of the final product!\n\nBy Mietta Palmer\n\nPeter’s Interview\n\nFor the visibility project, Peter took the Academy down to the brand-new library to film the A-Roll. This project is a video series profiling a range of leaders in education, including principals, assistant principals and middle leaders which aims to raise the standing of the education profession with the public and to improve the general public’s perception of the high quality of Victoria’s educators as well as, raise awareness of the Victorian Academy of Teaching and Leadership.\n\nWhile the crew set up all the lighting and sound, Melanie prepped Peter for the questions and once the crew was all set up, the interview began. Melanie began to ask Peter questions about public education and what sets TC apart. In response to \"What excites you most about your role as a leader in education?\", Peter replied that \"we're pushing on the boundaries of what education looks like.\" Our global recognition for progressive education is exciting and \"making a difference\".\n\nPeter also mentioned the unique relationship fostered between students and staff here at TC. \"We're focusing on students and we see is our students. They're learning more. They're getting excited about learning,\" he exclaimed. \"They're leaving the school with smiles on their faces and so happy with what they achieved that we see the excitement building in our staff.\"\n\nFor those who may not know, the opportunity to become a TC Journalist came in 2021 when I applied for the Facebook Admin job through the Student Employability Skills Program. Though I did not get that position, a new one fell onto my lap as Sophie Ellis asked me if I would be interested in a brand new job, writing for the school publication. Thus, a journalist was born!\n\nFor my first story, I was assigned to a piece about Connect TV. While the show now seems like a staple of TC's culture, in 2021 it was a new feature of Connect. I could not have been more terrified, but something pushed me to take a chance, even though I had never written anything besides English essays. While I look back on the article and slightly cringe, speaking with someone like Ryan Griffith was the best way to kick-start my journey as a journalist. With every passing article, I fell more in love with writing and the passionate humans I was lucky enough to work with.\n\nIt turned out to be the best adventure I have ever taken. And ever since then, writing stories that the TC community could rely on, became a part of who I was, during times of both good and bad. Almost every venture I would later take - Taylor Swift Fan Club, Consultancy, College Council and of course, College Captain would not have been possible without TC News.\n\nFor three years, writing a weekly story was my routine. Every Friday submitting it was no small feat. The late nights, the interviews, the countless messages daily, and the stress of continuous weekly deadlines while keeping up with the demands of my schoolwork.\n\nBut the satisfaction overtook much of the stress. I am so tremendously proud of all we’ve achieved, and the stories we’ve delivered. The connections and engagement we’ve acquired from the community and beyond, truly mean the world.\n\nIt’s impossible to sum up three years in one article. I am so grateful for the many opportunities I've had. Following Peter Ellis around the school for a day has to be one of the highlights, as well as the Student Showcase, the Hedwig the Chicken story featuring leaders at Templestowe Heights Primary and the many drama and dance performances. But the student success stories I focused on last term, is a project that I have great pride in! Coming up with puns each week began to consume me. Sharing the stories of the extraordinary students at TC, made me grow as a writer and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.\n\nTo Sophie, I am so grateful to have had the chance to learn and flourish with your guidance. Without your enthusiasm, unfailing support and endless stream of pitches for the next story, these stories and well, I, would have been lost. Thank you, Sophie, for taking a chance on me three years ago and giving me the space to use my voice in a meaningful, impactful way. I am beyond proud of the work we have done together.\n\nThank you to the people of TC – both staff and students – for sharing your talents, time and curiosity with me. Writing about your performances, and interviewing you about your student businesses, clubs, markets, achievements and so much more has been a gift. It truly takes a village to write stories and we've accomplished great things.\n\nTo my friends and family, thank you for letting me pester you for feedback on my articles!\n\nAnd to the reader, when I first began writing, I truly had no clue that people would be reading TC News. But having people come and tell me they enjoyed my stories has meant the world to me. I appreciate you taking the time out of your crowded schedules to engage with the stories.\n\nIn this period of transition over the next term, students Mietta Palmer, Ruby Eagan-Douglas and Rory Opie will continue to share stories each week, with the guidance of Sophie. Next week will be my final article and while I am teary-eyed writing this now, I am confident that I am leaving TC News in the most capable of hands, and I cannot wait to scour over the weekly publication and watch the growth that continues to happen.\n\nIn the meantime, you haven’t seen the last of me – I plan on undertaking a Bachelor of Professional Communications/Digital Communications at RMIT next year (If I get in), to hopefully end up somewhere in the Public Relations world and continue to pursue as many different opportunities as I can!\n\nNext Week @ TC truly holds all of the best memories from my high school experience.\n\nThank you all for your many years of encouragement and support.\n\nIt’s a bittersweet goodbye and the hardest I have yet to make.\n\nAs always,\n\nBy Bonnie-Mai Smith\n\nTC Journalist\n\nTerm 4 - Help Out, Give Back, CIL on Track\n\nClean up, catch a busking act, and give back – it’s Community Integrated Learning time!\n\nWelcome back to Term 4! This term's Community Integrated Learning (CIL) theme is set to be bigger and better than ever, running across the whole term, 'Give Back' brings fantastic activities that you will love, plus some killer community projects.\n\n“The focus of this theme is to encourage students to contribute to both the school community and the broader community through active citizenship and involvement in projects that improve the lives of members of our community,\" says Director of Community Integrated Learning, Ryan Griffith. \"Students have the opportunity to sign up for one-off events, as well as participating in events during Connect, and during their classes.\"\n\nFor the month of October, TC will be running a food donation drive for local charity Carenet. This organisation works against food insecurity by providing meals and supplies to people in need. We will be collecting donations of non-perishable foods for the whole month in the front of S Wing where there are boxes for each TC Colour Community.\n\n\"Carenet's values of respect, dignity, generosity, and collaboration resonate with TC's values of empowerment and active citizenship,\" Ryan Griffith exclaimed. \"We encourage TC students and families to get on board and donate what they can.\"\n\nThe Fare Share Kitchen is one of the must-do opportunities this term. Students will work in a commercial-style kitchen, taking action and preparing over 2,000 meals in a commercial-style kitchen. The meals will then be delivered to a range of people from all over the community. There are only 16 places per community, so jump on board and sign up now!\n\nA staple of CIL are the subject-based activities which will be running this term too, in week five and six, the Sports-Skill class are going to 'give back' to Templestowe Heights and make a difference in the lives of younger students by teaching them different sport skills. The student's exceptional knowledge will help the primary school students learn the fundamentals of various sports. The excursion not only benefits the younger students who are learning new sports and having fun, but it also helps the TC students develop leadership and communication skills. They have the opportunity to be role models and make a positive impact on their community. This initiative is a great way for students to get involved in the community and give back while doing something they love. It's a win-win situation for everyone involved, and it's a great way to promote sports and physical activity among young people!\n\nIn addition, our TC Musos will be busking to raise money for local charities and Animals students volunteering at Halls Gap Zoo, plus more. Speak with your teachers about what your class is doing in Term 4 to give back!\n\nStudents are giving back to the elderly as well. Ryan is working with the VM students, in collaboration with Swinburne University, the Manningham Council, and the Chinese Senior Citizens Club of Manningham, to go out every Tuesday to the library and get to know our local senior citizens. Their first session was on Tuesday, and Ryan thought it was \"really lovely.\" The senior citizens didn't know much English, so students and the seniors were using Google Translate to tell each other stories, which, according to Ryan, was \"really gorgeous.\" Together through digital storytelling, the partnership will end with a \"mini film festival\" of digital stories told by our VM students and senior citizens. That's certainly something to look forward to!\n\nA new CIL theme means a new Connect focus! As you may already know, \"the sessions are about each group creating their own identity forging their own relationship with their mentor and creating rituals and routines that suit the group,\" Ryan explained.\n\nIn line with 'Give Back', twice throughout the term, each community will take turns to step out as the \"Ruffey Lake Clean Up Crew\" and help tidy up our local park. These clean-up campaigns will aim to raise awareness about the scale of the litter problem and get our community thinking about simple, yet effective ways of how we can give back. Other Connect groups are hosting morning teas where everyone brings some food to share, but in addition, will bring an extra something to donate to Care Net.\n\nSome sessions during the Wednesday and Friday sessions will include a focus on anti-racism. With the rise of disinformation, and misinformation that can spread negative stereotypes about various people and their race, the Connect team want to be on the \"front foot\" and encourage our community to \"step up and be an upstander... when we see something that we don't like the feeling of or the sound of\".\n\nTowards the end of the year, groups will focus on planning a celebration to commemorate a wonderful year!\n\nMake sure to check out the attached calendar to see when things are happening. The calendar will evolve as the term unfolds so be sure to follow Compass posts and Community pages.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Be a part of something bigger than yourself.
