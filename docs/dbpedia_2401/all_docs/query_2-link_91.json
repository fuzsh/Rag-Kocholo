        "text": "Thousands of years ago, the Wurundjeri people – my people, my father’s people – lived here on these lands long before buildings were here.\n\nThey danced, they sang in a beautiful performance like in the Spectacular – and our dance was called Coroboree. Time and time again they echoed those words because of their language they were able to keep singing. As time’s gone by, I too have had the privilege of being able to speak my language, the Woiwurrung.\n\nI’d like to pay my respects to all ancestors, elders and communities across this great nation and neighbouring islands. To each and every one of you – from all your very many cultures – can I acknowledge you, your family and your community. I’d also like to say to you that we the Wurundjeri Woiwurrung are called the Manna Gum people. Not only is this Manna Gum important to keep our koalas alive, we must all remember that it’s also about the gift of the land that we give to you. I would ask you to take a leaf.\n\nWe share this together. Coming together is such a wonderful thing for all people of many cultures. It also means accepting this gift that you are welcome to everything, from the tops of these beautiful trees to the roots of the earth. You’ve now joined with my ancestors to nurture this land so that you today, and the many children that follow, will have as good a life, or even better in a stronger environment. Our language is the Woiwurrung Wominjeka Wurundjeri Balik Yemen Kundi Bek.\n\nThank you so much to everyone involved in State Schools Spectacular. You all have had such a great time pulling this show together again. My heart is with you. You are most welcome to the traditional lands of the Wurundjeri Woiwurrung people.\n\nAunty Joy Wandin Murphy AO\n\nNeill Gladwin, Creative Director\n\nAward winning performer and director (Green Room Award and International Perrier Awards), Neill’s career encompasses:\n\nOlympic and Paralympic Games ceremonies\n\ncomedy\n\nphysical theatre\n\nopera\n\nShakespeare\n\nfilms and television.\n\nFormerly half of internationally renowned comedy duo Los Trios Ringbarkus, Neill has directed productions for many of Australia’s major subsidised theatre companies, independent theatres and commercial presenters, as well as produced and executive produced for film and television.

Visiting countries and cities, we see them eventually return home to the open arms of their loved ones.\n\nLeaving home to explore the world is an integral part of growing. The exploration that starts on a neighbourhood level, for some, culminates in a world wide level.\n\nOur world, so magnificent, so fragile requires care. This year’s theme and musical items, once again generated by the cast, provides a generational perspective on the care of the planet and the kind of world these young people wish to live in.\n\nWe hope you have as much fun watching it as we had in making it.\n\nHappy travels!\n\nCreative Team\n\nSimon K Patterson, Creative Producer\n\nThis year is Simon’s 15th Spectacular and it continues to be one of his favourite annual events to work on.
