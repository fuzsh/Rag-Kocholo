        "text": "henry m rowan college of engineering\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Biomedical Engineering Major Ariana Torres\n\nToday we feature incoming freshman Ariana Torres, a first generation college student and Biomedical Engineering major from Vineland, NJ (Cumberland County) who plans to commute to campus.\n\nWhat are a few things you are looking forward to next year at Rowan? Something I look forward to doing at Rowan is joining plenty of clubs and really being involved in school activities.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major? I chose biomedical engineering to be my major because I took a campus tour of the engineering department when I was in eighth grade. Once the Admissions Ambassadors showed us the biomedical engineering aspects, I fell in love with the program and knew that’s what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\nWhy did you choose a university that is close to home? I chose a university that was close to home because I didn’t want to move too far away from home but I wanted some kind of commute to make me more independent.\n\nWhat is one activity, club, sport or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan? I hope that I can continue to play softball at Rowan. I also hope to join some more clubs and activities.\n\nWhy Rowan? I chose Rowan because from the first time I toured, I knew that it was going to be my home for the next four years after high school. The school was perfect in my eyes and I never had a doubt about choosing Rowan.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nOrganized by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, freshman communication studies and public relations double major\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Student Athlete Shane Vostenak\n\nToday we feature Shane Vostenak, an incoming freshman from Delran, NJ (Burlington County) who will live on campus and major in mechanical engineering.\n\nWhat are a few things you’re looking forward to next year at Rowan?\n\nNext year I’m looking forward to meeting my new teammates on the cross country and track team and getting to know all my professors and classmates. I’m really excited to be on my own and have a sense of self-sufficiency. I think it will be a challenge but one that really brings excitement. I’m also looking forward to learning new and interesting things about my major and about how the world around me functions.\n\nWhy did you choose your major?\n\nI chose mechanical engineering because I have always been the kid that wanted to tinker and find out how and why things worked in a mechanical/physical sense. I would always take apart random things in my house to see what made them tick. Most times I couldn’t get them to go back together the right way but it was the interest that made me choose this major.\n\nWhy did you choose a university close to home?\n\nThe fact that Rowan is close to my house is comforting but it was too major of a factor for me. I plan on staying on campus most of the time and really enjoying the new freedom and trying to really soak up the college experience. However it’s nice to know that if need be I could be home in less than an hour.\n\nWhat is one activity, club, sport or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan?\n\nAs I said above I will be running for Rowan’s cross country and track team and I’m really hopeful to grow a lot as a person and as a runner in my four years. Another club however I might like to join is an investment club if one is available. At my high school we didn’t have one of these but in the past year I have become more and more interested in the stock market and how money circulates the country and the world.\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nRowan for me was the right school because of its value. I see it as the right bang for my buck sort of. It’s is one of the top engineering schools that I know of and it is half the price of most other colleges I looked at. I also fell in the love with the new updates that the school has made to the engineering building and all the advancements that have been made to increase the technology and modernity of the supplies.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Mullica Hill’s Grace Harris\n\nToday we feature incoming freshman Grace Harris, an electrical and computer engineering major from Mullica Hill, New Jersey (Gloucester County) who will commute to campus.\n\nWhat are a few things you’re looking forward to at Rowan next year?\n\nI’m looking forward to making friends and making all the memories that come with being a college student! I’m also excited to work with faculty who are respected leaders in their fields, and network with other people my age who share the same interests and passions.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?\n\nThere are so many different reasons I could give! However, my primary motivation for choosing my major is because electrical and computer engineers have left their mark all over modern society with innovations that have transformed our world, from computers to cell phones to electric power and everything in between. Engineers will undoubtedly continue to leave their fingerprints all over technology and play a vital role in shaping the future. Being able to take part in this digital renaissance is an exciting prospect for me, and I can’t imagine anything else I’d rather be working towards, at least in my academic major and career.\n\nWhy did you choose a university close to home?\n\nThe convenience of remaining close to family and friends I have in the area, while at the same time immersing myself in the college experience, appealed to me very much!\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nThere are several reasons I chose Rowan. Rowan was more affordable than the vast majority of other college options I’d considered before, and it didn’t hurt that I lived close enough to Rowan to easily commute. However, the major deciding factor for me was the quality of the Electrical and Computer Engineering program, which is ranked #15 in the nation in the US News Best Colleges report. The prospect of attending a nationally recognized engineering program that is affordable and close to home was an opportunity I simply couldn’t pass up!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nPandemic Profs\n\nPandemic Profs: New Routines and Calming Views\n\nWelcome to our series to give you a glimpse into Rowan University, our campus culture, and the lives of our students, while we’re practicing social distancing to protect society from the spread of COVID-19. Today’s story is from Lauren Repmann, a sophomore relocated to her house in Middlesex County, NJ, for the rest of the semester.\n\nHello! My name is Lauren, and I am a sophomore biomedical engineering student at Rowan.\n\nSince coming home, I’ve spent lots of time with my 2-year-old cat, Buddy. He is very cute, but quite the handful.\n\nFor the past week, I’ve been eating chopped salads for lunch. While I eat, Buddy sits next to me and begs for little pieces of chicken and cheese. He even puts his nose right up to my bowl!\n\nWhen I am not at Rowan, I live in Laurence Harbor, a little New Jersey shore town directly across from New York City.\n\nI enjoy waking up early in the mornings to take walks on the boardwalk and watch the sun rise. I use these morning walks as opportunities to improve my photography skills!\n\nI’ve been taking pictures of the Laurence Harbor waterfront since I was about 10 years old, and each morning I get to add new pictures to my collection. These pictures make up the slide show home screen on my laptop. When I’m away at Rowan, I look back at these pictures for a little taste of home.\n\nIn addition to photography, I also enjoy playing piano! Now that I have more time on my hands, I plan to learn many new songs. I learned to play two songs over spring break, Dancing in the Moonlight and Bless the Broken Road.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory and photos by:\n\nLauren Repmann, biomedical engineering sophomore\n\nHow Construction Management Major Jeremiah Cason Earned a Degree From Across the Country\n\nName: Jeremiah Ryan Cason\n\nClass of: 2019\n\nDegree: B.A. in Construction Management\n\nHometown and county: I live in Beaumont, CA with my wife and 3 kids.\n\nFirst-generation college student? Yes, I am the first student in my family to earn a bachelor’s degree.\n\nWhat inspired you to choose Construction Management?\n\nHonestly, it was the need to provide for my family that caused me to enter the field. Money as a union tradesman was good, and I knew I was good at building things and putting things together with my hands. It felt natural and I have excelled at the field of construction. I now work for the 4th largest general construction management firm in the U.S. I love seeing the final result of a project and knowing I was a part of the greater picture. I feel like a conductor of a concert hall music symphony, and I love knowing I made this group of people come together to make a beautiful sounds (or building).\n\nWhat would you share with a future student interested in Construction Management?\n\nThis program is a great way to get your feet and mind into this line of work. The teachers are great, and they have amazing experience in the line of work that they can offer great advice and even suggestions on paths toward future employment. However, don’t go into construction management unless you understand it is challenging, stressful, and you work a lot of hours. There are a lot of times where you are going to struggle to and even fail, but that is how you learn and become better and grow.\n\nDid you ever have a moment of uncertainty within your major? How did you get through the challenge?\n\nI never had any uncertainty, I was and am fully invested in this line of work. I have poured myself into this career. I did not go to college like most at a young age, I went back to school in my 30s to finish my degree after I had already started my path in construction. I knew I wanted to advance and I knew I was going to need a degree to do it, so I had to go back to school.\n\nDid you feel supported throughout your college career by the Rowan community?\n\nI took a study abroad class and got to meet some Rowan students face-to-face for the first time. I live in Beaumont, CA and I never got to meet anyone or even any teachers at Rowan until this study abroad class. Not only did the students and teachers from the study abroad class embrace me and help me, they have all been there for me after the class and given me help and advice after in other classes as well. If fact, Dr. Hague from the WWII Study abroad class and I have stayed in touch since my graduation and we still text back and forth. My fellow students (Dan Cirino) even came to graduation and gave me a personal tour of the campus during my trip out to Rowan [for] graduation.\n\nHow does your field impact the world? What impact would you like to have on the world in your field?\n\nI think my line of work (and what I do) is the cornerstone of building America’s infrastructure. I am proud of what I do, and I look forward to being a part of my line of work in the years to come because I think methods for construction are going to get very high tech and demanding for new, “greener,” methods to improve building life cycles and reducing waste in the industry.\n\nWhat is your biggest career accomplishment so far?\n\nAside from providing for my family (because that was my whole motivation and drive when I started my line of work), I think it was, and is, earning my degree. I think that it’s going to open doors to finally get to the next step and place in my career. Not only that, but I also felt so blessed and proud that my family (especially my children) got to see me earn my degree. My kids now know that you can never be too old to go back to school and better yourself and your chances at advancing your career.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nAlyssa Bauer, senior public relations major\n\nPhotos courtesy of Jeremiah Cason\n\nAlumni Success: Chemical Engineering Major Brad Johnson\n\nBrad Johnson is a Chemical Engineering alumnus from the Class of 2016, from Langhorne, PA (Bucks County). Brad was part of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society, University Orchestra, String Ensemble and Republican Club. He is currently a Ph.D. candidate for the Department of Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nWhat inspired you to choose Chemical Engineering?\n\n“In high school I was interested in chemistry and, in particular, physics. I was drawn to engineering in general because of its hands-on nature and emphasis on applying scientific principles to improve the world.”\n\nWhat would you share with a future student interested in Chemical Engineering?\n\n“Chemical engineering unit operations and processes are pretty cool. There are so many inventive ways to transport, transform, separate and combine different materials.”\n\nHow does your field impact the world? What impact would you like to have on the world in your field?\n\n“Chemical engineers have a hand in developing and producing almost anything you can imagine: energy, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food and advanced materials to name a few. We excel at process modeling, utilizing math, chemistry and physics to create products in a safe and economical fashion.\n\n“My sub-field is process systems engineering. We develop and apply rigorous mathematical optimization and modeling methods to improve the design, operation and control of chemical engineering processes.”\n\nCan you share a current research project you’re working on?\n\n“I’m currently developing computationally efficient dynamic models for powder flow in pharmaceutical drug product continuous manufacturing. For example, one model leverages our knowledge of powder properties to predict how fast a powder can be fed through different screw feeders and under different process conditions. Predictive models can speed up a new drug’s time to market by reducing the need for experimental data to begin process development.”\n\nWhat is your biggest academic/career accomplishment so far?\n\n“Successfully proposing my thesis, ‘Theory and Application in Best Subset Selection and Constrained Regression,’ last September.”\n\nTell us about your transition into graduate school and how you pushed through any challenges.\n\n“The biggest difference between undergraduate coursework and graduate research is the switch from solving curated, self-contained problems with well-tested methods to having to pose your own problems and solutions with no guarantee they will work. This difference, in part, made it challenging to transition my strong undergraduate work ethic into my graduate work. To combat this, I’ve scheduled a period of time each day to focus on meeting small research goals. This helps me keep momentum even when unexpected challenges arise.”\n\nDo you have any plans after graduation?\n\n“I don’t have firm plans for after graduation. In the future, I hope to continue developing technical software and algorithms. I’d also like to help teach the next generation of engineers.”\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nAlyssa Bauer, senior public relations major\n\nAlumni Success: Staff Engineer for Hershey Company’s Reese Plant Christopher Dromgoole\n\nChristopher Dromgoole, a chemical engineering alumnus, graduated with his B.S. in 2000 and M.S. in 2003. He is from Gloucester Township, NJ (Camden County). During his time at Rowan, he was an Undergraduate Lab Assistant and Graduate Assistant. He is a Staff Engineer at The Hershey Company’s Reese Plant.\n\nWhat would you share with a future student interested in Chemical Engineering?\n\n“There are many career opportunities and pathways to choose from for those with a Chemical Engineering degree such as: food and beverage, pharmaceutical, energy, medical, legal and sales. Don’t just focus on the word ‘chemical’!”\n\nDid you ever have a moment of uncertainty within your major? How did you get through the challenge?\n\n“Sure, Chemical Engineering was difficult and required a lot of hard work, which made me question whether I really wanted to be an engineer. The key for me to overcome this challenge was to maintain focus and persevere through the rough times knowing that graduation was right on the horizon.”\n\nDid you feel supported throughout your college career by the Rowan community? If so, explain.\n\n“Yes, I most definitely felt supported by the Rowan community, especially my professors and classmates. I was part of the first graduating engineering class, so at that time, the program was small and each semester only had one section per course due to the minimal amount of faculty. This forced our class to be together for every required course, and we became like a second family. If anyone had trouble understanding classwork, homework or projects, there was always someone willing to sit down and explain things differently in hopes of making you understand.”\n\nTell us about your transition into the work field and how you pushed through any challenges.\n\n“I had a relatively smooth transition into the work field having been well prepared by learning how to work in teams during my various Rowan Engineering Clinic projects. As an engineer, one of the most important skills that you will need to learn is how to effectively troubleshoot an issue or a problem. This skill will greatly improve over time as you become immersed within your field of concentration or industry, but as a new engineer, you can’t be afraid or too proud to ask others for help or advice…”\n\nWhat is your biggest career accomplishment so far?\n\n“My biggest career accomplishment so far was the commercialization of the Hershey’s Air Delight Bars and Kisses. I worked together with the marketing and product development teams to create and scale up the production of aerated milk chocolate products in multiple plants that were located within different countries.”\n\nHow did you begin working for Hershey?\n\n“I believe that working on one of my Senior Engineering Clinic projects, which was the reassembly of a donated, Specialty Chemical Pilot Plant, helped me to stand out from other Chemical Engineering candidates that applied for the entry level position of Associate Process Design Engineer. The clinic project had required me to learn how to read Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Process & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), which was needed for the role at Hershey.”\n\nCan you explain your duties for the External Advisory Board?\n\n“I help to advise the Rowan University Chemical Engineering department on ways that they could improve their curriculum based on the skills that are needed and preferred for the Food & Beverage Industry.”\n\nLike what you see, come visit us!\n\nVISIT CAMPUS\n\nStory by:\n\nAlyssa Bauer, senior public relations major\n\nPhotos courtesy of Christopher Dromgoole.\n\nPandemic Profs: Geocaching\n\nWelcome to our series to give you a glimpse into Rowan University, our campus culture, and the lives of our students, while we’re practicing social distancing to protect society from the spread of COVID-19. Today’s story is from Eddie O’Melia, a sophomore relocated to his house in Warren County, NJ, for the rest of the semester. Eddie is a mechanical engineering major.\n\nHello Profs! Normally during the school week, I would be either be working on a project in the engineering lab or hanging out with my fraternity brothers. However, since we are all being restricted to certain quarantine measures I have decided to go geocaching with my family.\n\nMe and my little brother Greg decided to go to one of the local parks in Warren County and geocache. Geocaching is where someone hides a box full of different treasures along a path and when/if you find it you log when you did and can take one of the treasures inside, replacing it with your own. Going out in nature is a great way to prevent the spread of the virus and has endless possibilities. It gets you out of your house while not putting yourself or anyone else at risk. It was also a great way to spend time with my family while I am home.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nRecovering Philanthropy at Rowan University\n\nMeet Samantha Bollendorf, sophomore biomedical engineering major from Sewell, NJ (Gloucester County.) She shares her passion for volunteering with the Food Recovery Network and encourages students to deepen their volunteer experiences on-campus.\n\n“What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?” – George Eliot\n\nThere are few feelings, as a college student and human being, that rival the sensation of giving back to a cause, any cause, that matters to you. Giving all that we can do individually to better the lives of those that we empathize with is just about as rewarding as it gets, and it’s safe to say that we all wish we could participate in philanthropic efforts a little more than we already do.\n\nIt’s easy to be philanthropic when you’re a well-established gajillionaire, but as an undergraduate 20-something scraping together loose change to do your laundry and buy discount cereal from Aldi, donating to your favorite non-profits is an act easier said than done. Money is tight, and some days, starting a personal GoFundMe to keep your Spotify subscription afloat doesn’t seem all too crazy. All of this begs the question: “How can I give back on-campus in a way that works for me?”\n\nAs a student who actively volunteers and is constantly searching for ways to be more immersed on campus, I can assure you that Rowan offers a plethora of opportunities for students to give back. The breadth of volunteer efforts on campus reach a scope far beyond the bounds of our school — philanthropic efforts tend to reach the Glassboro community, as well as greater national causes.\n\nThat being said, it can be difficult to weed through the zillions of opportunities provided by our university to find the activities that really resonate with us as individuals. After a full year (and one semester) here at Rowan, I’ve found my own personal unsung hero of philanthropy in the form of Rowan’s Food Recovery Network.\n\nRowan’s Food Recovery Network is a small, student-led organization on campus that works on a weekly basis to source unused, otherwise wasted food from Rowan University’s dining halls. Students and faculty transport recovered food to local shelters in the Glassboro community. Food Recovery Network redirects food waste to a worthy cause, and gives students a chance to positively impact their surrounding community in a way that’s meaningful, and of course, doable.\n\nBeing a part of something like Food Recovery Network at Rowan, a university that encourages sustainability and practicing sustainable habits, is extremely rewarding. Being able to give back to those that have lent a hand in building beautiful Glassboro — the town that us Profs get to call home — is an opportunity I’m beyond grateful to have.\n\nThe best part? I don’t have to dip into my Spotify subscription fund to give back — all that I need to donate is my time, energy and my drive, shared by everyone at Food Recovery, to make the lives of those around us just a little less difficult. That’s the case with most volunteer efforts at Rowan University — so enhance your college experience, and lend a hand!\n\nLike what you see, learn more about our healthy campus initiatives!\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nSamantha Bollendorf, sophomore biomedical engineering major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nAlyssa Bauer, senior public relations major\n\nEngineering\n\nFaculty PROFile: Experiential Engineering Education Department’s Dr. Kaitlin Mallouk\n\nMeet Dr. Kaitlin Mallouk, Assistant Professor within the Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering.\n\nWhat is your area of expertise? Currently, my main area of expertise is engineering education pedagogy – basically, what are the best ways of teaching engineering students. I am also working on developing expertise in faculty development and leadership practices and diversity, equity, and inclusion in engineering education. These new areas have synergies with each other and with my existing expertise, so I’m very excited to learn more.\n\nShare an “aha!” moment that you’ve had within your discipline that made you feel passionate about your field. A few years ago, I championed the inclusion of weekly reflections in our first-semester first-year engineering clinic course that all engineering students take. As I began reading my students’ first reflections, I was struck by how many of them so clearly needed an outlet beyond what we typically provide in engineering (i.e., problem sets and lab reports). Their reflections were personal and honest and gave me a window into their lives that I don’t normally get. It reminded me that our students are whole people, and I had newfound motivation to provide them the best classroom experience I could.\n\nDescribe for us an experience you’ve had with a student that made you feel excited about educating the next generation in your field. I developed a project for our first-year engineering clinic class during which students learn about Net Zero Energy buildings and sustainability – we talk about solar power, heat transfer, and low energy appliances in the context of the engineering basics students are learning (like engineering economics). I think the project is super interesting and relevant, but I was so gratified when a student emailed me after the semester was over to let me know that his internship was going to require him to analyze solar panels and energy reduction measures and that he felt totally confident going into the internship having worked on the Net Zero project in my class! Our current students are the people who will be solving the most challenging engineering problems our society has ever faced and I’m proud that I can contribute to their development as engineers and people.\n\nWhat is one thing you wish people knew about your academic discipline or your research focus? Just because a particular way of teaching/learning things worked for you doesn’t mean it works for everyone (or even the majority of people). Our education system has been designed to select for particular strengths, which means we’re missing out on a huge amount of talent that doesn’t happen to thrive in our current system.\n\nWhat is a current project you and your students are working on? I have several students working on analyzing the reflections our first-year students are writing in their engineering clinic course. We are taking a few different approaches to this work—one is to try to understand how students think about the entrepreneurial mindset (curiosity, connections, creating value) and another is investigating how students conceptualize themselves as learners based on their responses to the prompt “Tell me about yourself as a learner”. We have found some interesting results—the publications are forthcoming!\n\nLike what you see, come visit us!\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory and photography by:\n\nAlyssa Bauer, senior public relations major\n\nWhere is He Now? Computer and Electrical Engineering Grad Becomes COO\n\nMeet Kenneth Whelan, a 2002- and third-class graduate from the Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering. Kenneth is the chief operating officer (COO) of Engineered Security Systems, one of the top 100 security integrators in the country. Today, he will share with us his journey, from picking Rowan University to becoming COO.\n\nWhat inspired you to go into engineering?\n\nMy cousin, who is also my godmother, graduated from NJIT (New Jersey Institute of Technology) in engineering when I was 8 years old. I thought it was really cool to know what an engineer actually does. As I got older, I got into computers, so I kind of put them together and got into electrical and computer engineering.\n\nHow did you know Rowan University was for you?\n\nWhen I was looking at colleges, I really thought I was going to go to NJIT like my godmother. I went to two NJIT open houses and two open houses for Rowan. NJIT was a nice sunny day, nice weather, and it still didn’t feel like home. When I went down to Rowan, it was cold, windy and rainy, and yet it still felt like home. I went with Rowan because even on a day like that, it seemed like a nice place to be.\n\nHow did Rowan University impact your life?\n\nI was very shy and not outgoing. Between the classes and student community, I really got out of my shell. Every class in the engineering department had a presentation we had to do and work in groups. It really taught me to work with other people and be able to stand up and present what I’ve done and really advocate for myself. I was also active in the electrical engineering society.\n\nI learned to round myself, and it really helped me out in my career. I went from just being an engineer when I first got out to now being COO for a nationwide security company. I really attribute everything Rowan taught me to get here.\n\nCan you tell us more about Engineered Security Systems and your role in the company?\n\nIt’s a family-run company, and it was founded in 1971. I’m the first person to be leading it who is not part of the family. We do electronic security like access control, fire alarm systems, burglar alarm systems for businesses, colleges and hospitals. We do very high-end systems that are customized for each client.\n\nIn the morning I first come in and talk with the engineering department, I ask what they’re working on and what products are coming down the pike. As the day goes on, I spend time with the operations department. Same thing, I ask what they’re working on, what service call popped up. And I also check in with our sensor monitoring center to see how everything is going and how our clients are doing. As the afternoon goes along, I have meetings and conference calls with our clients and vendors. And I kind of spend my time rotating around all functions of the business.\n\nAny advice for students interested or who are currently pursuing a degree in engineering?\n\nTry to get involved in as much as you can. Don’t try to do just one type of project with engineering projects. Get involved in student organizations on campus and definitely get out of your comfort zone. Join something you don’t think you’ll enjoy — whether it is a fraternity, sorority or some other activity group — just to broaden your horizons and meet people who are not in your major.\n\nLike what you see, come visit us!\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nIridian Gonzalez, senior journalism major\n\nPhoto courtesy of:\n\nKenneth Whelan\n\n#PROFspective: International Engineering Student Thai Nghiem\n\nName: Thai Nghiem\n\nMajor: Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nMinor: Computer Science\n\nYear: Senior\n\nAre you a first-generation college student?

I worked in the library as a Technology Desk Specialist for a year.\n\nShare an “aha!” moment you’ve had within your major that made you feel passionate about your intended field. I was always good at math and physics in high school, and since Rowan offered an outstanding engineering program, I did not hesitate to choose engineering as my major.\n\nDescribe an on-campus experience (academic or non-academic) in which you felt that your future goals are supported. I found the Career Fair on-campus very helpful, as I landed many interviews and two internships. The two engineering internships were with Ellenby Technologies and American Water. Both of them offered me competitive pay and treated me as a regular employee; they trusted and assigned me with great responsibilities. I had a great time interning with them and gained a great deal of practical knowledge and industrial experience. I would recommend everybody of all majors attend the Rowan Career Fair.\n\nCould you share a moment you’ve experienced in which you have felt that Rowan is a welcoming environment for you? My freshman year (2015), Rowan Cru held a Halloween party at the International House, where I used to live. As an international student, I did not have a lot of friends back then, especially those who are American. The event was a great deal to me, as I got to meet and talk to new people who were very friendly and helpful. Since it’s hard for an international student to get a car and a driving licence, many of them offered me rides to ShopRite whenever I needed. Furthermore, they invited me to be a part of their club — Rowan Cru, where I continued to make new wonderful relationships and great memories.\n\nWhy did you choose Rowan? Actually, Rowan found and chose me. I uploaded my resume on a merit-aid website, and Rowan officials contacted me. Due to the generous international scholarship, I was able to attend Henry Rowan College of Engineering.\n\nOn your busiest day, what academic, non-academic and social responsibilities are you juggling? On my busiest day, I am juggling between exams, my part-time job at the library, and leading a Bible study session at Rowan Cru. There are tough times, but those are what make us a better person. My friends in Cru, as well as my classmates, help each other through stressful times. I really appreciate these people and always enjoy spending time with them.\n\nLike what you see, come visit us!\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nThai Nghiem, senior electrical and computer engineering major\n\nPhotography by:\n\nNicole Cier, senior writing arts major\n\nFuture Chemical Engineer Shares Her Research Experience with ExxonMobil\n\n“In high school, I was extremely interested in chemistry and pharmaceuticals. I thought about first going to pharmacy school, but I was more interested in how drugs were actually made rather than the dispensing of drugs to patients,” shares Casey Wagner, senior Chemical Engineering major from Sicklerville, NJ (Camden County).\n\nFour years later, she’s conducting research for ExxonMobil.\n\nWhile working as a research assistant at Rowan over the summer, Casey bumped into her past professor, Dr. C. Stewart Slater. He encouraged her to join his fall clinic team to help ExxonMobil with a project involving the flushing operations of its lubrication plant. Casey explains, “It seemed like an awesome opportunity as a student who wants to go into industry.”\n\nShe continues, “The project is still in the beginning stages of development. So far our team is researching how we can relate other industries to the oil industry. Being able to visit the lubrication plant in Paulsboro, NJ and see how the operations are completed was an awesome experience. Being able to contact engineers and operators who are working at this plant to ask them questions and learn from their experiences has been a great experience for my future.\n\n“Overall, I’ve been very happy with the professional experience I’m gaining from being a part of this project. I’m extremely happy with the way the communication is between the students and ExxonMobil workers. I feel like we are slowly narrowing our focus as a unit and getting closer to finding plausible options for the plant.\n\n“I have gained some very valuable research experience from being a part of this project. Obviously, as engineers, we have to create unique ideas for our own experiments all the time. Reading about previously done work in contrasting industries and finding correlations between those different industries within the oil industry is very important for this project. This procedure is important no matter where I work in the future.\n\n“Also, working with different groups of people whether it be within the same company or at a different company has given me valuable professional experience. Learning different terms and expressions used by other engineers and chemists has been helpful.”\n\nCasey feels Rowan best prepared her for this opportunity through the engineering clinics.

Their mission is to network with as many people as they can to persuade and educate them in the hope to get votes for Bernie Sanders.\n\nRyan and Ian first met at a Bernie Sanders networking program, which helped students start groups and organizations in their colleges and provided the support and tools to help students understand canvassing. Through this meeting, Rowan for Bernie was created.\n\nThey were able to support a decent following on-campus with around 20 dedicated members going to club meetings as of now, and they look to further expand the organization.\n\nRyan explains his passion for his position: “Bernie Sanders has inspired me to really get involved with the political process, and I feel like he is our one chance to get somebody into the White House that has been this consistent for his entire political career…”\n\nRyan further adds, “…he has motivated me, and I feel like I have to fight as hard as I can to get this man elected.”\n\nIan also shares why he wanted to get involved: “I wasn’t really super political, [but] I always was somewhat into politics all throughout my high school years.”\n\nIan also explains his viewpoint: “I just really believe that it’s our responsibility as citizens to participate in the democratic process and make sure that people are taken care of. Bernie has been consistent over the decades, whether it comes to talking about healthcare he’s been pushing for Medicare for all these years. He was on the right side of civil rights, which is something we can not say for other candidates. He has been pushing for $15 an hour wage, that’s something he has been pushing for years … He is not only pushing for these things in Congress but he is actually doing them right now.”\n\nOne of their upcoming goals is to become a chartered organization at Rowan. As of now they have a petition with 200 signatures and are looking to propose their organization to the Student Government Association for further advancements.\n\nWith all the time put into the organization, they truly share a passion and work hard toward creating a bigger following and sharing some amazing experiences in the field. Ryan adds: “I’ve just really enjoyed canvassing and talking to new people, we openly will discuss ideas to people from very different political backgrounds … just really enjoyed sharing my views and backing them up with facts as opposed to just how I feel about things.” Ian further adds his most favorite experiences so far, “Just hearing people’s personal stories is just really moving and it really inspires me to keep pushing and try and make things better for everyone.”\n\nFor now, they look to further expand their club and to help people understand the importance to participate in the election and to have fun doing it!\n\nLike what you see, come visit us!\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory and photography by:\n\nAdam Goskowsky, junior advertising major\n\nA Leader in Rowan’s First-Year Connection: Volunteerism Program\n\nMeet Amanda Yannarella, a sophomore majoring in Biomedical Engineering from Burlington Township, NJ (Burlington County). This summer, Amanda became a student leader for this year’s Rowan’s First-Year Connection: Volunteerism Program. Today she will share with us her experience in the program and what she’s learned from being a student leader.\n\nWhy did you decide to join Rowan’s First-Year Connection program?\n\n“Last year as a freshman, I wanted to get acclimated to campus and wanted to start of my year well by volunteering. I volunteered a lot in high school, too. I was in Key Club, so I did a lot of volunteering then and I wanted to continue here. I was a leader this year because I loved it so much my freshman year. I wanted to do it again and have a positive impact on the incoming first-year students, because that was really important to me.”\n\nWhat kind of activities did you do?\n\n“We went to the Food Bank of South Jersey and we helped sort all the donations they had into proteins, soups and grains. Two people went into the bakery to bake muffins, so that was really cool. We also helped with the Saint Bernard’s [disaster relief] Project, which is similar to Habitat for Humanity, in which I am also involved in. We went to someone’s house that was damaged by Hurricane Sandy and we helped fix up their house. We did flooring, drywall, spackling and hurricane clips, which is supposed to help the roof stay on with strong winds.\n\n“Then we helped with the Little Owls Preschool at Rowan. We were cleaning their classrooms to prepare for the school year. It took us about two hours, which would have taken all the Little Owl teachers all day. Then we did SAIL Bowling Night; they do activities for adults on the autism spectrum. We had a great time bowling with them and making conversations — just hanging out and having fun, but it was important because I feel like we were making everyone’s day better. I’m not good at bowling, but still had a good time.”\n\nWhat was your favorite activity?\n\n“The Saint Bernard’s Project was my favorite because you learn skills that I feel you can transfer to your own house. Now I know how to put in hardwood flooring, and that’s pretty cool.”\n\nWhat knowledge or skills have you developed through this program?\n\n“When we went to the food bank [someone] told us the amount of food we sorted, which was a lot, was between 2,000 to 5,000 pounds. The guy was like, ‘Congratulations guys, you really helped us out, but there are still families going to bed hungry tonight. And even though we worked so hard there is still a lot of work to be done.’ Then you’re like, ‘Wait what? I just did this whole work and you’re telling me that there’s more?’ It’s kind of eye opening. That is why I like doing stuff like that because you get impacted and it’s good to get reminded with that kind of stuff. And as a leader I learned leadership skills, like learning to communicate. I use to hate talking. I was so quiet when I was younger, but this actually helped me get more comfortable talking to bigger groups of people.”\n\nWhat did being a leader for Rowan’s First-Year Connection program mean to you?\n\n“I liked being able to have an impact on incoming students and setting them off into a positive way. We were focusing on the volunteering stuff all week and the importance of that, but we were also getting them ready for campus. And it just meant a lot to get that kind of leadership experience under my belt.”\n\nLike what you see, come visit us!\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nIridian Gonzalez, senior journalism major\n\nFirst Year Voices: Joining Her Cousins at Rowan\n\nAfter hearing good things about Rowan’s engineering program and with two cousins already here, Rowan was a natural choice for incoming freshman Krishna Barot.\n\nMeeting people and forming the beginnings of lifelong friendships has been the highlight of Krishna’s summer at Rowan University.

Today he shares his experience in the Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering and how far his time at Rowan has taken him.\n\n“Rowan taught me how to talk to people, be social and gave me the ability to get the job I want.”\n\nAfter struggling to choose a college, Peter decided to attend Rowan University for its smaller class sizes and more intimate learning experience. Before going away to college, he wasn’t fully set on a career path. The one thing he knew for sure is that he loved to “break things down and figure out how they worked.”\n\nEventually, he decided to pursue Electrical and Computer Engineering. Peter noted that he is forever grateful for the College of Engineering, especially Professor John Schmalzel. He recalls spending time in Professor Schmalzel’s office, where they talked about everything under the sun.\n\nAfter leaving Rowan, Peter began his career with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), where he worked as an electrical/computer/mechanical engineer. His job was to travel around the country to collect pavement data for the National Airport Pavement Testing Facility. After two years of working as a contractor, he was promoted to a computer engineer position. Now within the test and evaluation branch, he became the first member of the storyboarding team, where his job is to “communicate the complexities of the National Airspace System (NAS).”\n\n“I work directly with the engineers, programmers and human factors experts to tell the story of the NAS. I love the fact that I am on the front lines communicating these elaborate programs to people all over the country,” he said.\n\nAlong with being a successful engineer upon graduating, Peter is also a businessman and entrepreneur. A year after graduation, he purchased his first rental property in Glassboro. He has since bought two other properties and provides affordable housing to a number of current Rowan students.\n\nPeter also started a YouTube Channel, The Sundae Drive, where he and a fellow Rowan alumnus perform DIY car maintenance tips. This channel currently has more than 5,000 subscribers. On top of all of this, he launched a supplement company, PWR Supplements, with another Rowan alumnus.\n\nLike what you see, come visit us!\n\nVISIT CAMPUS\n\nStory by:\n\nChad Wittmann, senior journalism major\n\nPhotos courtesy of:\n\nPeter D’Amico\n\nFuture First Year\n\nFirst Year Voices: Civil & Environmental Engineering Major Christian Smith\n\n“I’m looking forward to meeting new people, seeing the experiences that college will take me and finding a path that will lead to my future.” — Christian Smith, a Civil & Environmental Engineering major from Lawrenceville, NJ (Mercer County)\n\nLike what you see?

Rowan Chemical Engineering Alumnus Theodore Cohen\n\nToday we feature chemical engineering alumnus Theodore Maxwell Cohen, originally from Cherry Hill, NJ (Camden County). Now residing in Gladwyne, PA, he works as a project engineer on the design of pharmaceutical facilities at Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS). Cohen shares with us how Rowan University helped him figure out what he was truly passionate about.\n\nBefore getting his bachelor’s in 2009 and his master’s in 2016 from Rowan, Cohen had to choose what university he wanted to attend.\n\n“I applied to nine schools and got into all nine of them. I eliminated five of them that were pretty far away. Both of my sisters had gone to college far away, and I saw that it wasn’t all that fun. I filtered it down to Rowan, Rutgers and Udel (University of Delaware),” said Cohen.\n\nAfter eliminating Rutgers from his list due to the immense campus Rutgers has, it was down to the University of Delaware and Rowan. Cohen visited the University of Delaware and asked, “How are you going to help me succeed?” Cohen said the University of Delaware responded, “We take about 100 chemical engineering majors (ChE’s) every year. We graduate 50 of them as chemical engineers, and the rest we find something for them to do.” He thought, “Huh, those aren’t terribly great odds.”\n\nCohen then visited Rowan and met with Dr. C. Stewart Slater, professor and founding chair of the chemical engineering department. He asked the same question, and Dr. Slater said: “Well, we take about 30 ChE’s and we graduate around 23 of them as chemical engineers. But if you are willing to work hard, we will help you be successful.”\n\n“At the end of the day, that and my scholarship is why I chose Rowan,” said Cohen.\n\nThe program has since doubled both its enrollment and full-time faculty, yet still maintains a small faculty-to-student ratio.\n\nDuring his time at Rowan, Cohen mentioned that he met some incredible faculty mentors, who really made a positive influence on him.\n\n“I had a couple of great mentors that impacted my life. One of them was Chuck Clerecuzio. He was an adjunct professor who taught a senior level course in biopharmaceutical facility design,” said Cohen. “It was the course that I took that made me realize what I wanted to do in my life. Chuck was my mentor for many years. Unfortunately, Chuck passed away recently.”\n\nAnother great mentor who helped Cohen was Dr. Brian Lefebvre. Dr. Lefebvre was a chemical engineering professor at Rowan University from 2004-2008. While completing research for Dr. Lefebvre, Cohen was able to get a paper published as the primary author.\n\n“His specialty was bio process, which is what I really loved. I did three and a half years’ worth of lab work and research for him learning the basics of upstream and downstream bioprocessing. He helped me get a paper published while I was an undergraduate on anion-exchange chromatography,” said Cohen. “We became friends while I was a student, and continued that friendship with him long after I graduated. Brian helped me get my first job out of school at DuPont working on a similar project to his.”\n\nCohen is currently working at IPS as a project engineer for the design of pharmaceutical facilities. His role is to ensure that the design of the facility is cohesive and meets all of the numerous requirements from both the client perspective as well as regulatory.\n\nHis advice for Rowan students is: “Work hard. Try to learn as much as you can. Don’t be so wrapped up in your grades, they’re important but not that important. Learn the information and try to figure out what you love because you will spend the next 40 years working. Do something you enjoy.”\n\nCohen is thankful for figuring out what he loves. “Brian and Chuck helped me figure out what I was passionate about,” said Cohen.\n\nLike what you see, come visit us!\n\nVISIT CAMPUS\n\nStory and photography by:\n\nIridian Gonzalez, senior journalism major\n\nWhere is He Now? A First-Generation PCI Alumnus\n\nMeet Pre-College Institute (PCI) alumnus Ishraqul Wara, a first-generation student and 2018 graduate from the Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering. Wara lives in Clementon, NJ (Camden County) and works as a manufacturing engineer for Omega Engineering. Ishraqul will share with us how PCI helped shape his Rowan experience and where he is today.\n\nWhat inspired you to choose your major? “My grandfather inspired me to be an engineer, so I got it started. [But] my first year here, I was not an engineering major. I got introduced to the engineering [program] and I became friends with many from the department. I started going into the rotation and I just applied. They accepted me, and that was the transition from PCI to an engineering major.”\n\nHow did the PCI program help you prepare for Rowan? “Many ways, I don’t think I can count all the things I learned from PCI and all the things it did for me — especially all the relationships it helped me build. It definitely helped me in my studies. [There are] so many ways they supported me throughout my four years here.”\n\nWhat was it like being a first-generation student in PCI? “I think half of us in PCI were first-generation students. So, I didn’t feel alone because we were on the same page. We understood the situation we were in. It was a mixture [in our] group, and that is why PCI is so great, it builds relationships and gives support out for people who need it.”\n\nWhat are you doing currently? “I’m working at Omega Engineering as a manufacturing engineer.”\n\nWhat advice would you give to our future freshmen? “Make connections.”\n\nLike what you see, come visit us!\n\nVISIT CAMPUS\n\nStory by:\n\nIridian Gonzalez, senior journalism major\n\nFirst Year Voices: Twins Dillon and Chase Weigand\n\nWatch out, world!

Rowan College of Engineering and Assistant Director of Faculty Programs Rowan Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (RCIE).\n\nWhat is your area of expertise?\n\nMy research areas focus on game-based learning and engineering entrepreneurship. With both of these research areas, my focus is on how to improve the classroom experience so that engineering students can leave my classes well-rounded and ready to tackle the variety of challenges that are integral to the engineering field. More specifically, my work within engineering entrepreneurship focuses on the development of an entrepreneurial mindset. This doesn’t necessarily mean that students will start their own businesses, but that they will develop an innate curiosity about the world around them, be able to connect ideas and concepts from different classes, and, together, create products and/or services that will provide great value to the community around them.\n\nShare an “a ha!” moment that you’ve had within your discipline that made you feel passionate about your field.\n\nOne of my greatest “a ha!” moments was when I could see differences in my students a few years after they had been exposed to the game-based learning techniques that I apply in my classes for developing an entrepreneurial mindset. I knew deep down that these methods of teaching would make a difference in the students and help them develop into individuals who would be prepared to take on the challenges of today’s world. However, when a student came back to me a few years after I taught them to share that they used one of the games they played in class as an example in a job interview, it really brought home that the use of these techniques is leaving a memorable impression on my students. This experience reinforced to me how leveraging teaching methods that actively engage our students and challenge them to work outside their comfort zone can really help in their overall professional development and lead to lasting memories they can draw upon.\n\nDescribe for us an experience you’ve had with a student that made you feel excited about educating the next generation in your field.\n\nI have had several great experiences with students in my time at Rowan. With regards to Engineering Entrepreneurship, I believe one of my most memorable experiences is engaging with students as both a teacher and advisor. I have one student that I had the fortunate opportunity to teach and then advise as they are moving through the Engineering Entrepreneurship program. This student brings such a passion to everything that they do and is eager and open to learning whatever is necessary to be successful. The student often challenges the status quo and looks for opportunities to improve their and other students’ experiences on campus, thus applying an entrepreneurial mindset in and out of the classroom.\n\nEngineering Entrepreneurship focuses on providing students with a technical foundation within engineering while providing students with the necessary business skills to become innovators within existing organizations or start their own businesses. I think that we too often overlook how essential business skills are to the engineering profession; this degree brings to the forefront that blending these skillsets can lead to new possible career directions that our engineering students may not have considered.\n\nWhat is one thing you wish people knew about your academic discipline or your research focus?\n\nI really wish that individuals would realize that Engineering Entrepreneurship is not exclusively for individuals that would like to start a business. Although this is one potential career pathway, most of the program is really focused around providing students with the technical and business skills necessary to take on critical and essential roles in the engineering industry. The jobs our students will excel at include business developers and technical sales positions, and other positions that interface directly with customers. The skillsets taught within this program focus on the cultivation of an entrepreneurial mindset which means students can recognize opportunities, are comfortable with ambiguity, can persist through failure, and can manage risk. These are skill sets that are so important to today’s society when the economy is constantly changing and individuals are having to pivot their careers.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing about being on campus on a typical Tuesday?\n\nMy favorite thing about Tuesdays is my chance to interact with junior and senior engineering students through our junior and senior engineering clinic program. As part of this program, students are grouped into teams that are assigned to work on different faculty projects. I always enjoy having discussions with my student teams and seeing how their curiosity has led them to new areas of investigation. Several of these projects are grant funded, which means the students are working towards publications that allow them to showcase their work to regional and national audiences. The amount of growth I observe in the students over the course of a semester is incredible and although not explicit, I believe that many of these students develop aspects of an entrepreneurial mindset as they start to recognize opportunities for further development, persist through failure, and deal with the ambiguity associated with research.\n\nLike what you see?

Gatha will share her #PROFspective with us on what it’s like to be an international Rowan University student and how she’s getting the most out of her college experience as a Rowan Prof.\n\nHow is Rowan welcoming to you? During the Flying First Symposium by Rowan’s Flying First Task Force for first generation college students, I was invited to speak on the panel to share my journey. To see the first generation alums and get their support made me feel welcomed and a sense of belonging.\n\nCould you tell us a little bit about being a first generation college student? My family is back home in a small village in Nepal and were supportive to let me come here for my studies. Being first-gen is a point of pride in itself, but is also a big struggle. As a first-gen student, I am able to accomplish the dreams of my parents and inspire my community. I affirm for the young ones that they can live their dreams and achieve immense opportunities.\n\nTell us a little bit about the sacrifice that you and your family has made in order to make college a reality for you. My family and community have made a big emotional sacrifice to let me come to this foreign land and study while my other friends got married without finishing their education. While my family could have kept me home to assist them with their agriculture, they decided to let me fly away and be independent, which means a lot to me. I have left behind my friends and family who are very close to my heart, my traditions and festivities behind and work days and nights to make college a reality.\n\nHow do you feel your family will feel when they watch you walk across that graduation stage? I can imagine the tears of joy in the eyes of both my parents and brother when I finish my degree and graduate. They have dedicated their love and sacrificed so much to make it happen. My parents’ goal in life will be fulfilled when they see my accomplishments. My graduation ceremony will mean a lot.\n\nWhat organization is most meaningful to you on campus? I work as a Resident Assistant (RA) for the Residential Learning and University Housing which means a lot to me. As a team, we strive to build communities within Rowan’s campus to provide the best possible residential life experience to Rowan students so they can find a home away from home here. The residents I lead are a part of an engineering learning community in Holly Pointe Commons.\n\nTell us about your transition into college and how you pushed through any challenges. Leaving everyone I knew and my home country behind when coming to Rowan has been a challenging journey. I have faced numerous obstacles along the way including financial difficulty, as I don’t get any financial aid for being an international student and it is hard to find scholarships I am eligible to apply for. I still have this problem, but I work hard, work on-campus and apply to every scholarship I can.\n\nLike what you see?

If so, where/what do you do? I work as a tutor in the Rowan University Writing Center (in Campbell Library)\n\nWhat wakes you up in the morning? The thrill of getting to do and/or learn something new. Also, I love to have my morning coffee while reading!\n\nWhat is one thing you wish people knew about your academic discipline or research focus? I find that being a girl in engineering, especially one of the five or six in the MechE undergraduate program, is more advantageous than most realize. Additionally, although mechanical engineering tends to be associated with cars/engines/etc., the possibilities of post-undergraduate work are endless. You’re in no way tied down to any one field of work.\n\nWhat is one thing this field has allowed you to do, that you either dreamed of doing or thought you’d never get to do? Through its interdisciplinary program, mechanical engineering sparked my interest in biomedical engineering. Although I once said I would never take another biology class again, I am now set to be a PhD Biomedical Engineering student come Fall 2019.\n\nCould you share a moment you’ve experienced in which you have felt that Rowan is a welcoming environment for you? The Rowan Writing Center has provided me with a sense of belonging ever since I began working there. The staff took me in immediately as family and I always feel a sense of peace while in the space.\n\nWhy Rowan? I have made some incredible student-professor relationships here which have shaped my future by unlocking my potential. Professors Dr. Staehle, and Dr. Merrill and Writing Center Director Celeste DelRusso have exposed me to new areas of research through the engineering clinic curriculum, summer programs, and professional development conferences.
