        "text": "Curriculum\n\nTeaching & Learning\n\nAt Bayswater North PS we implement the Victorian Curriculum, and in 2025 will be shifting to the updated Vic Curric 2.0.\n\nOur School uses the ‘Gradual Release of Responsibility’ instruction framework to plan and implement lessons in all subject and curriculum areas.\n\nThe gradual release of responsibility instructional framework involves teachers gradually taking less responsibility for learning and students gradually assuming increased responsibility. It is through this process that students become competent and independent learners. This is often referred to as the ‘I do – We do – You do’ model. (Vic Department of Education 2022). It helps children become capable thinkers and learners, and is an effective approach for improving student outcomes.\n\nIt is important to note that gradual release of responsibility is not linear. Teachers move between modelling, guided and independent practice throughout lessons. Teachers make decisions based on student understanding and readiness. Students may move ‘forwards’ and ‘backwards’ in this process. (NSW Department of Education 2024).\n\nLiteracy\n\nAt Bayswater North, English is recognised as being an integral part of daily life. We aim to instil a love of reading and writing in our students, and to link these experiences to real life through our integrated studies program.\n\nIn all classes at BNPS, Students are exposed to a variety of texts during literacy sessions which develop children’s literacy skills such as comprehension, reading strategies and reading fluency. In addition, library sessions and ‘take home’ reading materials support the development of these skills as well as fostering confidence and enjoyment of reading.\n\nIn the early years of primary school there is a more concentrated focus on developing phonics skills in all students to build their ability to decode text. As their skills progress, the focus shifts more to building an in-depth understanding of the ideas, themes and concepts presented in their reading.\n\nAll students from Years 1-6 regularly use the Wordshark program to support their knowledge and use of phonics for reading and spelling. For further information regarding the Wordshark Online program, please visit their website:\n\nNumeracy\n\nAt Bayswater North Primary our mathematics curriculum follows the Victorian Curriculum.\n\nOur school aims to ensure that students:\n\nare confident, creative users and communicators of mathematics, able to investigate, represent and interpret situations in their personal and work lives and as active citizens\n\ndevelop an increasingly sophisticated understanding of mathematical concepts and fluency with processes, and are able to pose and solve problems and reason in Number and Algebra, Measurement and Geometry, and Statistics and Probability\n\nrecognise connections between the areas of mathematics and other disciplines and appreciate mathematics as an accessible and enjoyable discipline to study.\n\nThe Victorian Curriculum Mathematics Learning Area in primary schools incorporates the following:\n\nNumber and Algebra: counting, number patterns, place value, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, money, mental strategies, calculations\n\nMeasurement and Geometry: money, length, mass, time, temperature, area, volume, capacity, angles, shape, location\n\nStatistics and probability collecting, reading and interpreting data and graphs and deciding on the chances of events occurring.\n\nAt Bayswater North Primary all grade levels have a minimum of five one hour sessions per week allocated to mathematics. Typically, mathematical sessions begin with a whole class focus. The children may then be part of small group teacher directed activities, independent activities or rotational activities. Groups are structured according to the teaching focus of the session and the children’s individual learning needs.\n\nChildren are encouraged to verbalise their thinking. Sharing their learning and strategies during and at the end of a session is an excellent way for children to learn from each other and clarify their understandings.\n\nChildren work at a level that enables them to build on prior knowledge, challenge their thinking and make new connections. At all levels children are presented ‘real life’ mathematical problems enabling them to apply their mathematical skills and develop their problem solving strategies.\n\nMathletics\n\nThe children at Bayswater North have been given a userid and password enabling them to use the ‘Mathletics’ Program. This program can be accessed by the children both at school and home. Children are able to practise, refine and challenge their mathematical skills and understandings at levels appropriate to their capabilities.\n\nFor further information use the link below\n\nhttp://victoriancurriculum.vcaa.vic.edu.au/mathematics/introduction/rationale-and-aims\n\nIndonesian\n\nSelamat Datang!\n\nAt Bayswater North Primary School, Bahasa Indonesia is taught weekly to the whole school, with preps to Grade 2 students having 40 minute sessions and Grade 3 to Grade 6 students having 60 minute sessions.\n\nOur Indonesian program focuses on developing language skills and building cultural awareness. Students are encouraged to be curious and have fun while they learn, to build their confidence and encourage engagement.\n\nStudents learn in a wide variety of ways including singing, role-plays, art, dance, writing, reading, watching video clips and online learning. Language learning covers topics such as Greetings, Colours, Numbers, Pets, Family, School, the Body, Clothes and Shopping. By learning Indonesian, students learn about, and value, different ways of life, traditions, geography, arts, flora and fauna. Students also learn more about themselves.\n\nIndonesian is offered by a number of nearby secondary schools and we have close ties with the Indonesian Department at Heathmont College. Every year, Grade 5 students participate with 4 other primary schools and attend Asian Day at Heathmont College. We work together to manage transitions for our Year 6 students continuing Indonesian.\n\nApart from being lots of fun, learning another language has many benefits!\n\nFor example:\n\nLearning a language is great training for your brain\n\nLanguage skills can open new doors for travel, work and understanding.\n\nYou can build connections with people from other countries\n\nLanguage learning supports literacy\n\nYou can learn more about your own language and culture\n\nThere are also plenty of good reasons to study Indonesian:\n\nBeing ‘Indonesia-savvy’ can open doors to a wide range of employment opportunities\n\nIndonesian is very accessible – it uses the same alphabet as English and there are no tones\n\nIndonesian is a form of Malay so you can communicate with around 250 million people in Indonesia plus people in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei.\n\nIf students have access to the internet at home, they might like to explore or revise their vocabulary at the Indonesian section of Languages Online at:\n\nhttps://www.education.vic.gov.au/languagesonline/indonesian/indonesian.htm\n\nTerima kasih (Thank- you),\n\n(Bu) Mary-Ellen Dowling\n\nScience\n\nScience is a key area of study at Bayswater North Primary School. In the Science Curriculum Children, based upon the Victorian Curriculum there are 3 strands that are covered:\n\nScience Understanding\n\nBiological sciences.\n\nIn this area students learn that living things are interdependent and interact with each other and their environment; and the form and features of living things are related to the functions that their body systems perform.\n\nChemical sciences\n\nStudents classify substances based on their properties, such as solids, liquids and gases, or their composition, such as elements, compounds and mixtures.\n\nEarth and space sciences\n\nStudents understand that the Earth is part of a solar system that is part of a larger universe; They explore how changes on Earth, such as day and night and the seasons relate to Earth’s rotation and its orbit around the sun. They explore the ways in which humans use resources from the Earth and appreciate the influence of human activity on the surface of the Earth and the atmosphere.\n\nPhysical sciences\n\nStudents study the forces that affect the behaviour of objects; and that energy can be transferred and transformed from one form to another.\n\nScience as a human endeavour\n\nThe nature and development of science\n\nUse and influence of Science\n\nScience Inquiry and Skills\n\nScience inquiry involves identifying and posing questions; planning, conducting and reflecting on investigations; processing, analysing and interpreting evidence; and communicating findings\n\nTo support our science program our school’s resources include:\n\nOur own Frog Bog, designed as a breeding site so students can investigate living things, including animals, plants, and micro-organisms, and their interdependence and interactions within ecosystems.\n\nHome Grown garden where children learn they life cycle of plants how vegetable are grown and the seasons they follow .The products from our gardens are used by the children to promote healthy eating habits\n\nA worm farm as part of our recycling program\n\nComposting program to provide fertilizer for our garden beds.\n\nA Water Wise program to promote care of our waterways\n\nA wide range of science equipment including microscopes, digiscopes, electronic and solar equipment, magnets, force and motion models, scales, thermometers, weather instruments, mirrors, light equipment, solar models and ponding equipment.\n\nVisual Arts\n\nStudents at Bayswater North Primary participate in weekly Art sessions in our spacious and light filled Art Room, with Grade Three to Six students having one hour sessions and Grades Prep to Two participating in forty-five minute sessions. Students are always encouraged to use their imagination and explore various materials while enjoying the opportunity to improve their skills and techniques by participating in hands on activities that cover all areas of the Visual Art curriculum. Such areas include drawing, painting, printing, collage, modelling, construction, and textile art. Students will have the opportunity to study different artists and their works, and analyse and compare different art pieces and styles as well as make observations and reflections about their world and the world around them. They are encouraged to share their ideas and learn from each other, extend their Arty ideas, persist with their Art work and take risks to turn mistakes into a creative moment.\n\nThemes for Visual Art are often related to other areas of the curriculum such as Integrated topics that are being explored and covered in the classroom like ‘Sustainability’, and also might relate to important events that are happening throughout the calendar year such as Multicultural days or events and the school production. Throughout such themes, there will be a focus on learning about the different Art/Design Elements and Principles including colour, line, value, pattern, texture, form, shape, size, harmony, contrast and symmetry to name a few.\n\nEach term a small group of students from various levels have the opportunity to participate as Art monitors or become members of our Art club if they wish. Sessions are run during lunch time, once a week and are often related to topics or themes covered in our Art lessons and allow students to further develop their skills and understanding in Art. All efforts are valued and Art work is displayed around the school. Every second year the school has an Art exhibition where every child has at least two pieces on display for parents and relatives to enjoy of an evening.\n\nHealth & PE\n\nBayswater North has a comprehensive Physical Education program that aims to develop the students’ skills, fitness and knowledge. Areas covered throughout the year include athletics, cross country, basketball, fundamental motor skills, ball handling, major and minor games, swimming and water safety, fitness, interschool sports and bike education. All students receive one hour PE session per week and students in grade 3 & 4 and 5 & 6 have an extra hour of sport. Lessons are predominantly game sense based and have an emphasis upon teaching the correct technique, rules and developing knowledge, teamwork and leadership progressively from Prep through to Grade Six.\n\nAthletics\n\nThe athletics program for Grade 3, 4, 5 and 6 students culminates in the Ringwood District Athletics Carnival. The students have the opportunity to try out for a number of different events including triple jump, long jump, high jump, shot put, discus, hurdles and sprints during class time. A squad of students is selected for each track and field event from these trials. Training is also conducted during lunch times to compliment the work done in class. After the district carnival, students are given the opportunity to go on to Division, Regional and State level.\n\nPrep to grade 2 students participate in modified athletic activities which focus on running technique and gross motor movements.\n\nFundamental Motor Skills\n\nThere are 11 Fundamental Motor Skills – catch, kick, run, vertical jump, overhand throw, bouncing, leap, dodge, punt kick, forehand strike and two hand strike. Fundamental Motor Skills (F.M.S) form the basis for the development of higher level sport specific skills- eg overarm throw -tennis serve or volleyball spike, baseball or cricket. Research has shown that it can take between 240 to 600 minutes of instruction to teach children to correctly perform a FMS.\n\nResearch has shown that students who do not develop the ability to perform FMS proficiently at a Primary level are less able or less willing to persist with the difficult task of learning more complex motor skills and will avoid activities which expose them to “public failure” Ultimately this can lead to students rejecting participation in sport and physical activity in secondary years and beyond. There is an emphasis upon the development of fitness and fundamental motor skills at Bayswater North, especially in the junior school, where students complete various units of work designed to specifically increase certain FMS.\n\nMajor Games\n\nStudents at Bayswater North Primary School have the opportunity to compete in a number of Major Game units during their class time throughout the year. Some of the more popular games that students have the opportunity to play are Indoor Soccer, Indoor Hockey, European Handball, Basketball and Bat Tennis.\n\nThese units are often taught using a format known as SEPEP, which stands for Sport Education in Physical Education Program. This format places the responsibility on learning and organisation on the students. Through teacher facilitation, students are taught how to organise, manage, referee and score their own sporting tournament, conducted in a round robin format.\n\nWe place a strong emphasis on leadership at Bayswater North and this is just one of the ways that the PE program helps to foster a culture of leadership at our school.\n\nInterschool Sport\n\nStudents in grade 5 and 6 at Bayswater North have the special privilege of participating in the Summer and Winter Interschool Sports. The interschool sports format operates whereby we play a different school from our district each week, with some sports being played at home (at our grounds) and some played away (at the opposing school’s grounds).\n\nSummer sports are played every Friday morning in term 1 with cricket, tee ball, basketball, bat tennis, rounders, volleystars and a specialist karate program being offered.\n\nWinter sports take place every Friday afternoon of term 2 with football, netball, softball, hockey, volleyball, soccer and bat tennis being offered.\n\nDivision, Regional and State finals are then played during terms 3 and 4.\n\nCross-Country\n\nCross country takes place in term 2 at Bayswater North and is integrated with a ‘Fun and Fitness’ unit that students complete during their PE lessons during this time. The culmination of this unit is the Ringwood District Cross Country day held at Domeney Reserve.\n\nTo prepare for this day and to compliment the work done in class there is also the Bayswater North Running Club, which meets every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\nOn top of this, we also have our Bayswater North Fun Run which helps to raise money for the school and also lets the kids display their fantastic running skills.\n\nSwimming and Water Safety\n\nAt Bayswater North we believe that all student s have the right not only to learn to swim but also to feel safe and confident around the water. It is for this reason that we offer an extensive 1 week swimming program for all of our students.\n\nOur junior program runs in term 4 at the Vicki Field Swim School and our senior program runs at the start of term 1 at the Kilsyth Aquatic Centre.\n\nOur senior students also have the opportunity to try out for the Bayswater North Swimming Team.\n\nThis team competes annually at the Ringwood District Swimming Carnival held at Tintern GG in term 1 each year.\n\nBasketball\n\nThere is a strong Basketball culture at Bayswater North Primary which has been further enhanced by our recently opened full size hall and basketball arena. We have had many of our teams reach state level competition in recent years and are very proud of our students’ achievements.\n\nTerm 3 is our main focus on Basketball with an extensive unit being held in PE classes.\n\nFor our juniors we have Knox Raiders clinics provided for all students in grade prep-2 while for our senior students in grades 3-6, we have the annual Hooptime Tournaments. These tournaments and clinics are again all complimented with lunch time trainings and round robin tournaments.\n\nMusic & Performing Arts\n\nThe Music & Performing Arts program provides an engaging, creative and encouraging environment for all students to learn, perform and love the Performing Arts. There is a strong focus on singing, with each lesson beginning with a variety of songs, using Sol Fa to learn and develop pitch recognition and Orff and Kodai pedagogy to learn music theory.\n\nTheir musical journey begins early with weekly music lessons in Prep and Year 2, where they discover the fundamentals of music in melody and rhythm through singing, movement and percussion playing. Dance and Drama are also included during lessons, allowing students to share and explore creative ideas.\n\nIn Grade 3 & 4, students continue to consolidate their notes and rhythmic understanding, and are introduced to basic chord structures and progressions through learning and performing on the Ukulele.\n\nStudents in Grade 5 & 6, continue to develop their musicianship skills by developing their note and rhythmic reading, composing short melodies on a variety of instruments, exploring voice and movement through role play, story-telling, and learning about meaning and interpretation, forms and elements including voice, movement, situation, time and place, and improvisation.\n\nBiennial Whole School Musical\n\nEvery second year every student have the amazing opportunity to participate in the Whole School Musical Production. Students in Grades 5 & 6 get to audition for lead roles, and each class prepares items to present. Our school Gym is turned into a theatre like atmosphere, with professional lights and audio systems being set up to create a magical night of entertainment from our students and staff.\n\nKids On Parade Concert\n\nAlternating with our Whole School Musical Production, students in Prep – Grade 2 present our ‘Kids on Parade’ Concert. Each class prepares a few items to present to the school community in an afternoon of high quality entertainment that also highlights individual students who take part in instrumental lessons.\n\nGrades 3 and 4 Music Festival\n\nStudents in Grade 3/4 also present their talents in the Grade 3/4 Music Festival working together in their music lessons to present a whole class performance using xylophones, percussion instruments, Ukuleles and Dance.\n\nGrade 5 and 6 Shindig\n\nIn Grade 5 and 6, students prepare a variety of acts to present for their Grade 5/6 Shindig Concert. From musical items, band pieces, drama sketches and improvisation, the Grade 5/6 students explore a variety of ways to express creative ideas by composing music, writing scripts and choreographing dance routines.\n\nJunior & Senior Choirs\n\nHere at Bayswater North PS, we have 2 choirs – The Junior Choir, for students in Grades 1 & 2 and the Senior Choir for students in Grades 3 – 6. Each choir rehearse weekly learning a variety of repertoire, and singing techniques that prepare them for the various opportunities to perform at school and also for the community. The Senior Choir have previously performed for local nursing homes, hospitals, Box Hill OXFAM Music Concert, Bunnings Family Day etc.\n\nBand Program\n\nThe band program involves weekly rehearsals, learning about ensemble playing, intonation, listening and working as a team. The band is made up from students who learn a musical instrument either privately or as part of the Brass and Woodwind program. The students learn a variety of styles of and repertoire, and work and encourage each other as they develop their musicianship and ensemble playing skills.\n\nAmazing Baysy Performing Corner\n\nOur ‘Amazing Baysy Performing Corner’ also provides regular opportunity for students to perform. Led by our students, in front of their peers during recess and lunchtimes, students are given the opportunity to showcase their various talents including singing, dancing, instrumental performance or even a flashmob.\n\nFriends of Music\n\nFriends of Music nights encourage the wider school community to come along for an evening of entertainment presented by our students, parents and staff. This is held annually towards the end of the year, and is one of the many highlights for our instrumental students.\n\nICT\n\nLearning in this domain enables students to focus on the task to be accomplished rather than on the technology they are using to do the work. Through the selection and application of appropriate equipment, techniques and procedures, they process data and information skilfully to create information products in forms that are meaningful for themselves and their audience. These products effectively demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the concepts, issues, relationships and processes that are the subject of the task.\n\nStudents are provided with tools and strategies to monitor learning patterns and problem solving strategies. This provides a sound foundation for transforming personal learning. They gain an understanding of Internet protocols and strategies for exchanging information, which enables them to share and challenge their own and other people’s ideas and solutions with a global audience.\n\nAt BNPS we utilize Digital Technologies to support the curriculum. Our computer facilities are constantly being upgraded and are maintained and supported by two part time computer technicians. We have a computer lab containing 30 computers, class sets of notebook computers for year 3 to 6 and class sets of IPads for Foundation to grade 2 students. Every classroom also has access to Interactive whiteboards and data projectors.\n\nAt Bayswater North Primary we focus on\n\nkeyboarding skills\n\nfile management\n\nInternet use\n\nusing Microsoft Office applications (Word, Publisher, PowerPoint, Excel)\n\nusing Multimedia programs to support Early Years Literacy and Numeracy Learning Centres\n\nTypical computer tasks involve the use of digital photos to enhance a report about a recent school excursion or event, designing posters or brochures about a campsite or country being studied, and using the internet to research information for a project.\n\nStudents at all levels are encouraged to improve their keyboarding skills with the regular use of a Typing Tutor program. Whilst touch typing is not expected, students should be using two hands to type, and quickly locate the position of each key on the keyboard with more than one finger.\n\nExtra Curricular Activities & Excursions\n\nAt Bayswater North PS we offer a large range of extra curricular activities, incursions and excursions that are designed to complement the regular classroom or school program, and provide rich learning opportunities for students.\n\nActivities that complement the curriculum program each term are chosen to provide students with engaging and fun ways of adding to regular curriculum delivery.\n\nExtra curricular activities that fall outside the scope of the regular learning program that government schools provide may incur a cost, depending on the nature and type of the activity.\n\nSome examples of the types of activities that are currently offered include:\n\nExcursions to places/programs outside the school – for example Knox Community Gardens Visit, Scienceworks.\n\nIncursions – organisations that visit the school to provide additional experiences. Such as – Super Buddies, Indigenous Storytelling.\n\nGrade 3-6 Camps Program\n\nGrade 5 and 6 Inter-school sports program\n\nGrades 3-6 Athletics Carnival\n\nGrades 3-6 Swimming Carnival\n\nWhole school cross country\n\nChoir\n\nUkulele Group\n\nJunior and Senior Art Clubs\n\nLunch time games clubs – run in the library by our Chaplain (Alan Silverwood)\n\nInstrumental Music Lessons\n\nChess Club\n\nBuddies program (Prep/Grade 6 students)\n\nFriendship Ninjas program. Trained peer mediators from Grade 6 are visible in the grounds during recess and lunch times where they assist younger children with play.\n\nWhole School Colour Ru\n\nSpecial Day Celebrations, such as Harmony Day and Footy Colours Day.\n\nLibrary\n\nBayswater North has a large, well-resourced library encompassing a picture book corner, non-fiction section, fiction area as well as a teacher reference section and resource room.\n\nTeachers in Foundation Year through to Grade 6 are responsible for their own library sessions. All students visit the library for one 50 minute session a week, during which they are given time to borrow books as well as learning relevant library and referencing skills."
