        "text": "With nearly 70% of all U.S. students currently pursuing higher education, the desire to find a school that represents the best fit for each student has never been greater. And with their own unique personality, academic curriculums, social and extracurricular activities, and student experience, New Jersey’s dozens of public and private higher education institutions are outstanding contenders.\n\nFollowing, representatives of some of the Garden State’s most prominent colleges, universities and trade schools discuss the characteristics that make their institution a winning choice for today’s students and how they best prepare students for the future.\n\nMatthew Whelan, EdD, President, Caldwell University (Caldwell)\n\n“Caldwell is a great option for students because it has been named a ‘Best Value School for Regional Universities in the North’ by U.S. News & World Report and is close to home for many of them. With degrees ranging from the bachelors to the doctorate, we have one of the lowest tuition costs for private colleges in New Jersey, and 98% of our recent graduates are employed, enrolled in graduate school or have joined a service program. Caldwell’s education is designed to guide students to develop critical thinking skills and embrace diverse cultures and inspire them to contribute to a just society. We integrate our core values of respect, integrity, community and excellence into our curriculum and strive to ensure that they inform who we are and everything we do. Throughout the pandemic, we’ve seen the enormous value of our academic programs, as many of our graduates have been front-line responders and alumni of such Bachelor of Science programs of ours as nursing, health care administration and public health. Come see us and experience the Caldwell way.”\n\nKathryn A. Foster, President, The College of New Jersey (Ewing)\n\n“TCNJ delivers an exceptionally high-quality education in a welcoming and supportive environment — an experience that many New Jersey families seek from expensive, out-of-state colleges yet can find much closer to home and at a fraction of the price at TCNJ. We offer students a wide range of degree options, from professional fields such as business, nursing, education and engineering to the full menu of arts and sciences. TCNJ focuses on finishing in four years and has a proven track record of success in that regard, annually ranking among the top public institutions in the country for four-year graduation rates.”\n\nThomas M. Eastwick, President, Eastwick College (Hackensack and other locations)\n\n“At Eastwick College, our programs prepare students for practical, in-demand careers through specialized hands-on training that mirrors what they’ll face on the job. For example, students in our cardiovascular sonography program learn how to create internal images of the heart and vascular system in ultrasound scan lab classrooms using equipment similar to that used by many local hospitals and medical facilities. We also offer a number of accelerated programs, which allow students to start their careers in as little as six months. It’s clear that ‘essential’ jobs such as nurses, surgical assistants, plumber apprentices and IT technicians will play a major role in the job market moving forward and will remain in steady demand even during economic downturns because no matter what happens, we still need people to fix our plumbing if a pipe bursts or restore the network so that a Zoom meeting can start. Those are exactly the types of careers we prepare students for at Eastwick College.”\n\nLamont Repollet, EdD, President of Kean University (Union)\n\n“Nationally recognized for social mobility, Kean University helps students succeed no matter their ethnicity, race, sexual orientation or socioeconomic status.
