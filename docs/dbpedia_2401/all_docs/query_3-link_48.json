Call 570-941-4740 or email schemelforum@scranton.edu.\n\nThe University of Scranton’s Schemel Forum features a distinguished group of thinkers, authors and a Grammy award-winning musician for its fall semester World Affairs Luncheon Seminars.\n\nThe series will feature six seminars in total. All take place from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and will be held in Brennan Hall’s Rose Room on the University’s campus. In addition, a Zoom link will be provided for those who wish to attend remotely. The luncheon series is sponsored by Munley Law.\n\n“While we didn’t go into this fall’s luncheon series with a specific theme in mind, it’s easy to make connections among the topics, which should be of interest to Schemel Forum members and to people interested in joining a luncheon or the series for the first time,” said George J. Aulisio, Ph.D., dean of the Weinberg Memorial Library and director of the Schemel Forum.\n\nThe series opens Friday, Sept. 6, with “Living to Grow Up: How Childhood Death Became ‘Unnatural’,” presented by Perri Klass, M.D., professor of journalism and pediatrics at New York University, national medical director of Reach Out and Read, and author of “The Best Medicine.” Recipient of the Arnold P. Gold Foundation Humanism in Medicine Award, Dr. Klass will discuss the remarkable human victories over child and infant mortality.\n\nTrained as a pediatrician in Boston during the 1980s, “there was a guiding principle that it’s not acceptable for children to die,” said Dr. Klass. At the beginning of the 20th century, one in ten children died. Today, thanks to advances in science, medicine, public health and social welfare, that has changed.\n\n“To me, this seems like a huge change in the human condition,” said Dr. Klass. “It might be the best thing we ever did as a human species.”\n\nDr. Klass will talk about the ways that so many different fields of human endeavor had to work together to change the odds that children would survive. As a society, “we did this,” Dr. Klass said. “Looking at this through a historical lens, parents today can appreciate the incredibly good fortune of being able to keep our children safe.”\n\nNext, on Thursday, Sept. 26, Adam Benforado, J.D., professor of law at the Thomas R. Kline School of Law, Drexel University, New York Times best-selling author, and children’s rights activist, will present “What Do Children Deserve?”. In his acclaimed new book, “A Minor Revolution,” professor Benforado offers a sharp indictment of America’s failure to protect, invest in, and empower children. Through this talk, he will examine how this is not only a moral problem, but also an economic and social one: by neglecting kids today, we doom ourselves in the years ahead.\n\nThe fall luncheon series continues Tuesday, Oct. 8, with Jonathan Conyers, acclaimed author of the memoir “I Wasn’t Supposed to Be Here.” Founder of Conyers Media, host of The Professional Winner Podcast, and co-founder of the Brooklyn Debate League, Conyers will share “The Power of Storytelling.” Speaking from the personal experience of lifting himself out of life’s struggles, Conyers will share how the stories of each and every person matter.\n\nBorn to two parents addicted to crack cocaine, Conyers’ childhood was defined by both tragedy and triumph. “Now that I’m on the other side, I look back on what happened as an advantage,” Conyers said.\n\n“Writing has taught me so much about my life and journey,” Conyers said. “Things that happen to you don’t define you. You always have a chance to rewrite your story, and you can decide which chapter it will start with.”\n\nOn Friday, Oct. 18, Vince Giordano, Grammy-winner, multi-instrumentalist and band leader, will present “There’s a Future in the Past: Leading a Repertory Orchestra /Band in the 21st Century.” Giordano has brought 1920s and 30s jazz to life for nearly five decades. He and his band, Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks, have been featured in films including The Cotton Club, The Aviator, and Boardwalk Empire, and have performed at the Town Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Newport Jazz Festival and the 92nd St Y for the past five decades.\n\nVince Giordano and The Nighthawks will perform in a free and open-to-the-public concert on Friday, Oct. 18, at 7:30 p.m. in the Houlihan-McClean Center. For more details, visit www.scranton.edu/music.\n\n“Giordano’s luncheon presentation and concert give a new breadth and depth to the Schemel Forum programming and allow us to partner with the excellent programs hosted by Performance Music on campus,” said Dean Aulisio.\n\nOn Friday, Oct. 25, Olapeju Simoyan, M.D., professor of psychiatry, Drexel University College of Medicine, will present “Bridge Over Troubled Water: Harnessing the Power of Music, Art and the Humanities for Better Health.” The health care community has grown increasingly interested in the humanities and creative arts over the past decade. In this discussion, Dr. Simoyan will address numerous ways in which music, art and the humanities are used to bridge the gap between the science and art of health care.\n\nThe fall season will conclude Thursday, Nov. 21, with Josef Wegner, Ph.D., professor of Egyptian archaeology, chair of the Department of Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures, and curator of the Egyptian Section, Penn Museum, University of Pennsylvania.\n\nDr. Wegner will present “Ancient Egypt in Pennsylvania: Excavations, Collections, and New Discoveries.” In what Weinberg Library Dean Aulisio describes as “one of the most unique luncheon programs we have done with the Schemel Forum,” Dr. Wegner will look at recent discoveries in Egypt, as well as the history of Penn’s work and the new galleries which will showcase Ancient Egypt’s legacy in Pennsylvania.\n\nAdmission to the seminars is free for University of Scranton and Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine students, faculty, staff and Schemel Forum members. For non-members, the seminars are $30 in-person (buffet lunch included) and $15 for remote access.\n\nTo register for the seminars, call 570-941-4740 or email schemelforum@scranton.edu.

Traver ’24, Sweet Valley, received a Fulbright Open Study/Research Award to examine the effect of Rwanda’s election quota system for female candidates. Adrian Laudani ’18, Valley Stream, New York, received a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Award to further develop teaching and mentoring skills in Spain while helping students learning English.\n\nFulbright awards are based on academic achievement and demonstrated leadership abilities within a person’s field.\n\nWith these two additions, 131 University of Scranton students have been awarded Fulbrights since 1972.\n\n“The Scranton graduates awarded Fulbright Student Scholarships this year are outstanding ambassadors for the United States and for the University. They are strong, intelligent, passionate and compassionate women who have committed themselves to help serve others transition into new roles and a new life,” said Kara Kofira Bishop, University of Scranton Fulbright Program adviser and manager of study abroad and international fellowships.\n\nShelby Traver ’24\n\nDespite growing up in a post “women’s lib” world, Shelby Traver at times “felt judged” in the male-dominated pursuits of business major, karate student and school debate. “It never really bothered me,” she said, but “at certain times I would think ‘you would not be saying this to me if I were a man.”\n\nIn true Jesuit style, she has never assumed malice – “sometimes they just don’t understand it’s hurtful” – but she has been drawn into gender justice issues, initially by the protests against Iranian mandates for female clothing. An independent studies class on quotas further piqued her interest. “I think they are one of the most fascinating political instruments because they work so differently in so many different places.\n\n“I just kept coming across Rwanda as this country that is kind of a paragon for supporting women, at least in the political arena.”\n\nFollowing a stretch of internal struggles and genocide against the Tutsi in 1994, Rwanda worked to unify with a new constitution that requires at least 30 percent of both houses of parliament be women. But “that acted as a floor instead of a ceiling,” Traver said. The women who first got elected through the quota later got re-elected on their own success, opening up the quota seats for more women. Now the parliament is 61 percent female, the highest percentage for a parliament in the world.\n\nBy comparison, she notes, at the federal level the U.S. “gets 24% in a good year.”\n\nThe Fulbright award will allow her to spend nine months living in Huye, considered Rwanda’s academic capital, with visits to Kigali, the political capital.\n\nUniversity of Rwanda-Huye senior lecturer Ismael Buchanan, Ph.D., has offered to mentor Traver during her research, and to provide contacts for potential interviews. “I would love to interview people, especially in government and academics, who study these things.”\n\nThe native of Sweet Valley in Ross Township, Luzerne County, will also have the chance to take courses at the University of Rwanda, and to improve her French, one of the country’s four official languages. She’s hoping to pick up some Swahili as well. And with luck, she’ll get a little time to see the sights of a country famous for exotic vistas and animal preserves.\n\nThere’s one more thing. “A big part of being a Fulbright scholar is being a cultural ambassador for the U.S.. I’m not only going to do research but I’m going to talk about my own country,” she said. “It’s an amazing way to share between two cultures.”\n\nTraver has been overseas before, as part of a University of Scranton trip to the West Bank of Palestine for a class on Christianity in the Middle East with Michael Azar, Ph.D., associate professor of theology and religious studies. “That was a really transformative moment, seeing how important it is for people to be heard,” she said. Many there are “never really listened to.” She also lived in France for seven weeks studying international business.\n\nHaving three majors as an undergraduate – international business, political science and philosophy – as well as a minor in French, Traver admits “I didn’t sleep much for four years.” She was a member of the University’s Special Jesuit Liberal Arts Honors Program and was the recipient of the University’s full-tuition Presidential Scholarship. She was awarded a Slattery Humanities Center Student Fellowship and President’s Summer Research Fellowship. Amazingly, she still found time to mentor at-risk students; serve as vice-president of The University of Scranton College Democrats, as well as a student organizer for the Gender Justice Dialogue Series; and make the Pi Sigma Alpha political science honor society, Alpha Sigma Nu Jesuit Honor Society and Pi Gamma Mu social sciences honor society. Traver was also a member of Kania Women in Business, served as alumni chair for the Kania Student Advisory Board and was a student organizer for the Gender Justice University Dialogue\n\nA graduate of Lake-Lehman High School and a summa cum laude graduate of Scranton, Traver received the University’s Excellence in International Business Award at commencement.\n\nAfter nine months in Rwanda Traver plans to get her doctorate in women in politics, hoping to change those “hurtful comments.”\n\n“I hope I can help create a world where it doesn’t happen,” she said. “It’s a lofty dream, but I hope to take at least a little bit of a chisel to it.”\n\nAdrian Laudani ’18\n\nAdrian Laudani has always had an affinity for the issues immigrants face. She worked closely with international students as an undergraduate at The University of Scranton, and most recently has been aiding migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border for more than two years.\n\n.\n\nWhile attending The University of Scranton, she participated in Campus Ministry’s International Service Program to Guatemala, and spent a semester in Rome studying Italian and theology. Originally from Valley Stream in Long Island, New York, Laudani earned a Bachelors of Science in counseling and human services with a concentration in human development and a double minor in Italian and theology/religious studies. As a Resident Assistant, she won the ‘Program of the Year’ award for an initiative she started with the global exchange community.\n\nAfter graduating from Scranton in 2018, she served one year with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, where as a case manager, she resettled refugees in the greater Atlanta area. “I offered general transitional support and helped with adaptation, but not in the sense that families just arrived and now need to assimilate. It’s about meeting people’s needs where they are, recognizing that they’ve experienced a lot of trauma and are in a delicate situation, adults and children alike.”\n\nLaudani went on to earn a Masters of Arts in International Studies at the University of San Francisco, a sister Jesuit university, where she received the “Best Overall Thesis” award for her research on the quality of the refugee resettlement program in the United States. She also worked in Italy for Spring Hill College’s study abroad program, and ran immersion programs that took students to the Nogales, San Diego-Tijuana and Dominican Republic-Haiti borders. “These experiences have really allowed me to live out my Jesuit values of serving others. As I continue to be in these spaces, I find that my passion to work with immigrants, refugees and international students has grown even greater,” said Laudani.\n\nWorking at the U.S.-Mexico border led logically to her studying Spanish. She has spent time with children and families living in shelters on both sides of the border. Through her work, she wanted to “help families feel like the U.S. is going to become home, and not just a place they landed after having fled their homeland due to war, violence or things of that nature.”\n\nBeing a neighboring country to her parent’s first country of Italy, applying for a Fulbright Award to Spain was a natural lure. After learning about migrant pathways coming through southern Spain, she said “I wanted to dive deeper.” The Fulbright will allow Laudani to work part-time in a classroom at the University of Málaga as an English Teaching Assistant. She also plans to continue her work with refugees with the Jesuit Refugee Service in the nearby city of Seville.\n\nHer long list of accomplishments while at Scranton include membership in Alpha Mu Gamma, the foreign language honor society, Theta Alpha Kappa, the theology honor society, and Tau Upsilon Alpha, the human services honor society.\n\nWhile formal studies at The University of Scranton are several years behind her, Laudani continues to draw support from the connections made here. “I’ve definitely stayed in touch with some of my mentors,” she said, citing Barbara King, student life coordinator, who was in Campus Ministry during her undergraduate years. “I continue to feel close to Scranton”.\n\nOnce the nine months in Spain are done, Laudani plans to keep doing what she’s been doing, either in Europe or the United States. “I’m open to working with migrants journeying through the Mediterranean, or coming back to the U.S. to work at the intersection of higher education and immigration. I could see myself working at a university with international students or going back to the nonprofit world continuing direct service with refugees and migrants.”\n\nThe University of Scranton honored 56 members of its undergraduate class of 2024 for academic excellence, leadership and service at a Class Night Ceremony on campus May 17.\n\nStudents with the highest GPA in each of the University’s three undergraduate colleges were presented Frank J. O’Hara Awards for General Academic Excellence, a memorial to the late administrator who served the University for 53 years.\n\nClass of 2024 O’Hara Award recipients were: Tabitha R. Berger, Cresco, and Charles C. Sylvester, Newtown, for the College of Arts and Sciences; Sarah G. Boyle, Peckville, and Madalyne R. Buhler, Stony Point, New York, for the Kania School of Management; and Aidan R. Corrigan, Mansfield, Massachusetts, for the Leahy College of Health Sciences, (formerly named the Panuska College of Professional Studies).\n\n$content.getChild('content').textValue\n\nAlso recognized at the ceremony was the recipient of a prestigious student Fulbright Awards for the 2024/2025 academic year.
