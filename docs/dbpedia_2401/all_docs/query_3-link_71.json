        "text": "Year 7 is a transitioning year, guiding students in how to navigate the secondary school learning environment; grow their connections to school and develop their understanding of the attributes of an Aquinas College student.\n\nAt Year 7 students enjoy their first camp with their House cohort; a Year 7 specific swimming carnival; and participate in CONNECT Week which includes activities designed around the Year 7 core value of Belonging.\n\nThe Year 8 core value is all about Stewardship and helping the students to understand the wider world. Students enjoy in a 3 day camp at The Summit, Trafalgar East with their House group. The focus of the camp is on teamwork with a range of activities available from abseiling, obstacle courses and to a summit challenge.\n\nIn Year 8 students learn more about their house patron saint with each student participating in a Retreat focusing on social justice and the work of their Patron Saint.\n\nIn Term 2, students are involved in Global Green. This is an opportunity for students to work collaboratively on projects that focus on sustainability, world knowledge and creative thinking for a better world.\n\nThe core value represented at Year 9 is Perseverance. This is a time when classes are mixed across the year level for the first time, and students further develop their personalities and behaviours, and strengthen friendships.\n\nThe City Experience Learning Program is an opportunity for students to develop practical research skills, gain an understanding of the workings of the city and skills such as independence, teamwork and collaboration. While the School Experiential Block encourages students to work on leadership and understanding the implications of risk taking in a program that is the culmination of independent learning in Year 9. This also includes driving skills and the survivor camp for every student.\n\nEach Year 9 student spends a week working in Cafe N9ne at the College. The experience provides a range of specific literacy, numeracy and hospitality skills as well as soft skills such as collaboration and team work.\n\nAt Year 10, students move into the Senior Years. Pastoral care moves to a Mentor based system, with compulsory Mentor time on Monday and Thursday morning. This year also offers the opportunity for students to participate in Study and Cultural Tours, including experiences travelling to China, Borneo and France.\n\nIt is a time for students to start thinking about their study and career pathway with the help of our Careers Counsellor and Pathways Coordinator.\n\nStudents in Year 10 as also invited to participate in the long Aquinas tradition of the Year 10 Presentation Ball, which is an opportunity to get dressed up, and spend an evening with friends and family.\n\nYear 11 is an exciting year as students focus on their final years at secondary school. The core value of Compassion is reflected in the activities and excursions available to the year level.\n\nStudents have the opportunity to participate in the outback experience to Kakadu - travelling either north from Alice Springs, or south from Darwin. The Kakadu is an experience which brings the students together in their final years, and is often remembered fondly by past students. City Camp is an alternative to the Kakadu trip and gives the students an opportunity to challenge themselves, and build friendships against the backdrop of Melbourne City.\n\nThe Year 11 Formal is a celebration of the year past, and an acknowledgement of the final year of secondary school ahead.\n\nThis is a significant year in every students life as they think of their future beyond secondary school. At this point in the school journey many are focusing on tertiary studies and this year starts with a University taster giving students an opportunity to try out a day at University.\n\nYear 12 Retreat is a time for the cohort to come together one final time and reflect on their time together, their friendships, adventures, and the people they have become, and prepare for the exams ahead.\n\nGraduation Mass and Graduation Ceremony is a chance for the College to celebrate and wish the graduating students all the best for their future. The Valedictory Ball is an opportunity to recognise achievements and say farewell."
