        "text": "Lately, I‚Äôve been volunteering with local youth in both church as well as in martial arts. On my application for church they asked why I want to mentor youth. Here are 3 reasons why I‚Äôm doing this: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identity: these young men need to know who they are, and more importantly, WHOSE they are 2Ô∏è‚É£ Critical Thinking: to ask good questions and solve interesting problems 3Ô∏è‚É£ Community: being around people that are FOR them, that will lift them up and encourage them to be better humans #volunteering #mentorship #nextgenerationleaders\n\nVolunteers are a tremendous workforce üí™ and embodiment of selflessness. They bring leisure, culture, and sports to life, illuminating community organizations worldwide üåè. Do you know any volunteers who inspire you? Tag or mention them in the comments on this post. On this World Volunteer Day, the Vendere Group aims to highlight the names of those who play an essential role in our society, working for various causes, from the environment to education, health, and human rights. Did you know that the impact of associations is immense ? They often face major challenges in mobilizing resources üë≠ and raising awareness about their missions. That's why we want to emphasize the importance of supporting and getting involved with associations. #volunteersmakeadifference #volunteers #volunteers #volunteersday2023 #VolunteerSpotlight #association\n\nWith the pandemic and online schooling, it has become increasingly difficult to get high school students to volunteer. A recent conversation at an event brought up the question of whether this is an issue across the country. What can we do to encourage engagement from our youth? It's important to remember that volunteering not only helps the community but also provides valuable experience for students. Encouraging high schools to include volunteer work as part of their curriculum can make it easier for students to find opportunities and fulfill their requirements. Additionally, partnering with local organizations and promoting volunteer opportunities on social media can help spread awareness and encourage students to get involved. Let's work together to inspire the next generation to give back to their communities and make a positive impact. Have you had success with engaging high school students in volunteering?

We‚Äôve got helpful information on common tasks and issues involved in community development, like getting a group started, writing a constitution, holding an AGM, financial management and more. Check out the range of topics we have available on our website here: https://lnkd.in/dUQK6Rii What are some other topics you‚Äôd like us to cover in a how-to sheet? #howto #communitydevelopment #communitygroups #getinvolved #volunteering #GoodGovernance #supportingcommunities\n\nNormalizing mentorship and volunteering is essential to combat the hidden crisis of juvenile delinquency that is plaguing our communities and crippling future generations. Too often, the potential of our youth is overshadowed by the challenges they face, including lack of guidance, support, and positive role models. Mentorship provides young people with a trusted confidant who can offer advice, share life experiences, and help navigate the complexities of growing up. Similarly, volunteering creates opportunities for adults to invest time and resources into nurturing the next generation, fostering a sense of community and belonging. It‚Äôs time to get off the sidelines and add value to a young person‚Äôs life. Whether it‚Äôs through formal programs or informal connections, we all have the capacity to make a difference. By dedicating a few hours each month, we can inspire, guide, and support youth, helping them develop the skills and confidence needed to succeed. Let‚Äôs work together to ensure that every young person has the opportunity to thrive. Our future depends on it. #Mentorship #Volunteering #YouthDevelopment #CommunitySupport #JuvenileJustice\n\nAs we celebrate the incredible contributions of our volunteers this #VolunteersWeek, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge that, according to Sport England‚Äôs latest Active Lives Adult Survey (2022-23), there are 2.1 million (5.6%) fewer volunteers now than there were in 2016-17. This statistic is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in maintaining a robust and diverse volunteer workforce. Our #Born2Coach movement aims to reverse this decline. Because, for the nation to thrive, coaching must too. The survey also reveals that while volunteer levels continue to recover, they remain down for most Asian, Black and minority ethnic groups. This underlines the importance of UK Coaching‚Äôs efforts to ensure that volunteering opportunities are accessible and appealing to all sections of our community. Through our #Born2Coach campaign we are looking to recruit more people from more diverse backgrounds into coaching. Interestingly, more people are volunteering regularly now than three years ago. However, an underlying long-term downward trend continues. These findings underscore the urgency of our mission. We need to not only halt the decline but also build back stronger, ensuring that our volunteer workforce is diverse, resilient, and capable of meeting the challenges of the future.
