        "text": "The Performing Arts Center (PAC) is one of the most unique facilities at Aquinas College because of its collaboration with the community. The collaboration is between four entities: the Aquinas College Theatre Program, Circle Theatre, Catholic Central High School, and West Catholic High School.\n\nAQ College Theatre Tickets Circle Theatre Tickets Catholic Secondary Schools Tickets VIEW THE EVENTS CALENDAR\n\nThe PAC is home to 15-16 shows per year, not including other special events. The Aquinas Theatre Program puts on four to five mainstage productions, while the Community Circle Theatre contributes six shows and a concert series. Also, the high schools each put on two shows, and they work together to put on one combined show. With 418 seats, this location also holds concerts, featured speakers, and other special events year-round. The number of events means the venue is constantly in use.\n\nThis collaboration was established in 2002 and it continues to grow and serve the community, making the venue more than just an academic building, but a cultural symbol in Grand Rapids. It is nationally unique and sets Aquinas College apart from other colleges by taking community involvement to a new level. Through the partnership, students are introduced to the performing arts at the high school level, their skills and knowledge are refined through college-level theatre, and they are able to share their talents through a professional program--all at the Aquinas College Performing Arts Center.\n\nDirections\n\nPerforming Arts Center (from I-96):\n\nTake the CASCADE RD WEST exit- EXIT 40A.\n\nMerge onto CASCADE RD SE.\n\nTurn SLIGHT LEFT onto ROBINSON RD SE.\n\nA sign reading Performing Arts Center will be on the right\n\nP.A.C.
