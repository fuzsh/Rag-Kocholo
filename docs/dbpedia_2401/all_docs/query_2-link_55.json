        "text": "By: Sally Hopkins ‘26, student correspondent\n\nAbby Casal ‘25, Laura Echausse ‘25 and Sophia Pisarski ‘25 recently served as team leaders of SPARK, a weeklong program for at-risk youth ages 12-15. The collaborative effort of The University of Scranton and Scranton Preparatory School took place July 22 -26 at the University's Retreat Center at Chapman Lake.\n\nCasal, of Clarks Summit, an early childhood education major; Echausse, of Mineola, New York, an early childhood education major; and Pisarski, of Jessup, a business analytics major, review their week at Chapman Lake where they forged connections with other participants.\n\nWhat are the goals of the SPARK program?\n\nAbby Casal '25: \"SPARK was created as a collaborative program with The University of Scranton and Scranton Preparatory School. These students collaborate to lead groups of 12-15 year-old at-risk youth in the Scranton area. The goal of the SPARK program is to provide University students, Scranton prep students and kids at SPARK with the opportunity to connect with one another.\n\nIn the beginning of the week, we tell our University team that their main goal of the week should be to love the students and give them the best week possible.Throughout the week, students participate in a variety of activities related to self-expression, bullying, healthy lifestyles and healthy relationships. Additionally, on Wednesday, we go whitewater rafting, and throughout the week, we have other fun activities, such as free time for the kids to swim in Chapman Lake and a carnival on Friday.\"\n\nWho took part in the SPARK program?\n\nLaura Echausse, '25: \"\"The Spark program is a collaborative effort consisting of 38 participants: 12 Scranton Preparatory students (all rising seniors), 15 University team members, and the University’s Center for Service & Social Justice staff. A majority of the participants of SPARK come from the Nativity Miguel School of Scranton, specifically the 7th and 8th grade.\"\n\nDescribe a typical day at SPARK.\n\nSophia Pisarski, '25: \"A typical day at SPARK starts as the school bus arrives around 9 a.m. As the kids get off the bus they are greeted by our University and Scranton Prep students. After breakfast is served, the kids are led by their team's leaders through several activities and games, followed by lunch and free time. To end the day, we all sit down to have dinner. The day for our “SPARKlers” is wrapped up around 5:30 p.m. when they get on the bus again to head home.\"\n\nHow did you use the Retreat Center at Chapman Lake to conduct the program?\n\nAC: \"The Chapman Lake Retreat Center is the venue for the SPARK program, providing an ideal setting for the activities and interactions that take place. This retreat center offers students a safe and welcoming space away from school, allowing them to fully immerse themselves in the program. Throughout the week, students have numerous opportunities to swim in Chapman Lake, an activity they greatly enjoy.\"\n\nWhat is the community impact of running a program like SPARK?\n\nLE: \"The community impact of SPARK can be seen through both the kids who partake and The University of Scranton/Scranton Prep team members. Many kids leave SPARK saying it was the best week of their life, due to the outpouring of love and encouragement given to them at all times during the week. On Friday, they leave better able to identify their gifts, with a stronger sense of self love, and the tools needed to be resilient when facing life’s challenges.\n\nSPARK has the capability to give kids the confidence needed to make a positive change in their community. The environment created at SPARK between the kids, University team members and Scranton Prep students is like no other. Each day, every SPARK participant is welcomed, embraced and loved for who they are which is a beautiful thing to witness.\"\n\nWhat do you think the teenagers you worked with will get out of SPARK?\n\nSP: \"The teenagers we work with spend the week feeling an immense amount of love and support. Not only do they form lifelong friendships with classmates outside of the classroom, they also learn important life lessons that help them grow and thrive. This program sets them up to have a toolbox of valuable skills that allows them to survive and flourish in school and society. \"\n\nHow does it feel to participate?\n\nAC: \"Participating in SPARK is something that I have felt incredibly privileged to do. The experience is not just an opportunity to engage in a series of activities; it’s a chance to form meaningful connections and create lasting memories. Throughout the week at Chapman Lake, the kids and team become very close. From the moment we arrive at the retreat center, the bonds between University of Scranton students, Scranton Prep students, and kids begin to form. Shared experiences, such as overcoming challenges together during team-building activities or simply enjoying a meal together, contribute to the development of these strong relationships.\n\nLearning from the students and team while having fun together is an incredible aspect of the SPARK program. One of the most rewarding aspects of the program is witnessing the personal growth of the kids. Seeing them gain confidence, develop new friendships, and be able to have a fun week is truly inspiring. It’s a reminder of the positive impact that a supportive and nurturing environment can have on young individuals. The program’s emphasis on love, support and encouragement helps create an atmosphere where everyone feels valued and respected.\"\n\nHow does this connect to the University's Jesuit ideals of service and 'being men and women for others'?\n\nLE: \"A quote by St. Ignatius that is integral to the education one receives at The University at Scranton states, 'Go forth and set the world on fire.' SPARK encapsulates this quote in many ways, in the sense that each kid who attends is reminded of the light that exists within them, and given the tools that will allow them to set the world on fire.\n\nIn terms of the team members, the Jesuit term “magis” most certainly applies to their role. Magis is the idea of doing more for others and striving to give with no limits. During the week, the team goes above and beyond to give every kid the best week by giving them all the attention, love and support that they deserve. Myself, Abby, and Sophia were in awe of the team’s ability to continually give every ounce of themselves to the program\"\n\nIf someone was on the fence about getting involved with SPARK, what would you want to tell them?\n\nSP: \"To give it a chance. It is a program like no other and nothing is similar to the immense joy and fulfillment. Once the kids arrive Monday morning, taking the leap of faith and becoming a part of the program even with all the feelings of [being unsure] will be worth it. It is truly the best program.\"\n\nBy: Sally Hopkins ‘26, student correspondent\n\nJustin Matzner ‘25 interned with Island Dolphin Care in Key Largo, Florida, where he worked with clients in therapy classrooms and in the water with aquatic life. The non-for-profit organization provides animal-assisted therapy for people with special needs or challenges, and their families.\n\nMatzner, of Stony Brook, New York, is an occupational therapy major. He hopes to continue his education into 2026 to earn a master's degree. He explains how the Royal Experience Summer Internship Program supported his interest in dolphins and therapy that began at a young age.\n\nDescribe a typical day at work.\n\n“My typical day at work includes preparing the facility for clients' arrival. This involves hanging up life jackets, cleaning and organizing the therapy rooms, preparing activities for the therapy classroom and setting up cameras for photo sessions.\n\nWhen the clients arrive for the therapy programs, we start by giving them a tour of the facility. Inside, we show them interactive walls, fish tanks and facts about dolphins and marine science. Then, we take them outside to familiarize them with the grounds.\n\nThe first half of their session at Island Dolphin Care takes place in the therapy classroom. We work on individualized goals, focusing on improving fine motor skills, balance, communication, social skills and coping mechanisms for stress, anxiety, depression and mood regulation. Activities include painting, sensory activities, balance beams and board games.\n\nThe second half of their session is spent in the water. We start with the sensory touch tanks, where they can see starfish, hermit crabs, sea urchins, sea slugs and bamboo sharks. Then, they go through the sensory garden and make their way to the dock to swim with dolphins. Throughout the session, we take pictures for them to capture their experience.\"\n\nWhat are some skills you have learned?\n\n\"During my time here so far I've learned how to use different communication and social skills when working with non-verbal clients, such as hand signals or PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) cards. I've used different adaptive equipment during sessions and learned how to do transfers with different clients. I've also learned various approaches to activities involving coping mechanisms for stress, anxiety, depression and mood regulation. I've developed a lot of patience during sessions and gained experience working with animals that assist clients in therapy. Additionally, working with clients from diverse backgrounds has also increased my cultural sensitivity.\"\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about your job?\n\n\"What I enjoy most is seeing the positive impact this place has on children’s and veterans’ mental health. Dolphin-assisted therapy makes a significant difference to individuals, and it makes me happy to see clients improve during their five-day programs, both in their physical limitations and mental health conditions. I also enjoy being exposed to a unique type of therapy that is growing in the field of occupational therapy.\"\n\nWhat was your expectation going into the job? Does it match the reality?\n\n\"My expectations going into the job were that I would learn about working with different clients in the therapy room and managing the involvement of assisting animals. Not only did my expectations match the reality, but they were also exceeded. I gained extensive hands-on experience with a variety of clients, each with unique needs and challenges. I also developed skills in integrating animal-assisted therapy into our sessions, learning how to effectively utilize the therapeutic benefits of working with dolphins. Additionally, I acquired new techniques in communication, patience, and cultural sensitivity, all of which have enriched my professional growth beyond what I initially anticipated.\"\n\nHow do you feel that this job has prepared you for the real world?\n\n\"This job has equipped me for the real world by providing extensive hands-on experience with clients through various therapeutic activities. It has familiarized me with a range of conditions, treatment methods, and adaptive equipment used in therapy. Additionally, this internship introduced me to animal-assisted therapy, a growing practice in occupational therapy, which I am interested in pursuing further. Working with clients from diverse backgrounds and different countries has also enhanced my cultural sensitivity and understanding of various beliefs and customs. That is very important when developing therapy plans to ensure the client is comfortable. This experience has been invaluable in preparing me for my future career in occupational therapy.\"\n\nDid you have an interest in animal-assisted therapy before this?\n\n\"Growing up, I had numerous surgeries where I had to stay in family living facilities for months at a time. As a result, I developed a lot of anxiety, and therapy animals like dogs that visited the hospitals always calmed me down. I've always had a passion for animals, and when I learned that animal-assisted therapy is a growing field in occupational therapy, I knew it was an area I wanted to pursue.\n\nAs a child, I watched the movie 'Dolphin Tale' countless times and found the story fascinating. I even met Winter, the dolphin with a prosthetic tail from the movie. Once I started my OT journey at The University of Scranton, I discovered that past students did their fieldwork at Island Dolphin Care. I had no idea they offered a program with dolphin-assisted therapy, but I knew it was exactly what I wanted to do.\n\nMy hospital, the Paley Institute, is also located in Florida, and my goal after graduation is to work there and establish a partnership with places like Island Dolphin Care. I want to provide other children undergoing difficult surgeries with the opportunity to have unique therapeutic experiences, such as animal assisted therapy with dolphins.\"\n\nWhat was your experience like working with children, families and vetERANS with special needs?\n\n\"I have had great experiences working with clients with special needs. The families that come are strong, caring, kind, and grateful for this unique experience. It can be emotionally difficult for the clients at times, which is why patience is so important during sessions. Engagement techniques are crucial with younger clients, as they get easily distracted while working on goals. Flexibility is also key, since sessions are highly individualized, allowing for adaptations to activities as needed. Observing client behaviors during sessions helps monitor what works best for them.\n\nMy experience working with families made me realize how important family involvement is during therapy sessions. It creates comfort for the client, educates the family on therapy techniques, and highlights the role of dolphin-assisted therapy in the child’s development. Family support and communication are vital for encouraging loved ones, and they can provide valuable insights about the client that benefits the therapy. Family involvement also builds trust among the client, family and therapist.\n\nWorking with veterans, particularly those with PTSD (Post-traumatic stress disorder), has been very insightful. I've gained a lot of knowledge about their mental health conditions and the role that dolphin-assisted therapy can play in their treatment journey. PTSD symptoms can be challenging, including anxiety and emotional triggers. Building a safe and supportive environment is crucial for veterans to feel comfortable enough to open up and engage fully during sessions.\n\nAdapting therapeutic approaches to fit each veteran's individual needs has been so important. Some techniques aimed at promoting relaxation, such as mindfulness exercises or guided interactions with the dolphins, have shown promising results in helping veterans manage their symptoms. These approaches not only aim to reduce the intensity of PTSD symptoms but also work toward enhancing their overall well-being.\"\n\nWhat has this experience meant to you?\n\n\"Overall, this experience has been life changing. I find myself being more relaxed and confident in everything I have learned in the classroom at The University of Scranton. Now that I can apply those skills to such impactful therapies, I know there is so much I can assist and help these clients achieve. Thank you to all my instructors and mentors along the way who helped develop me into the OT I will become. I realized during this experience that all I learned is so important when put into practice and this is exactly what I want to be doing.\"\n\nEleven University of Scranton Students participated in a study abroad program in South Korea that provided an in-depth exploration of the criminal justice systems in both South Korea and the United States and allowed the students to compete with international teams in a cybercrime investigation challenge.\n\nThrough the course led by professors in the University’s Department of Criminal Justice, Cybersecurity and Sociology Michael Jenkins, Ph.D., and Sinchul Back, Ph.D., who previously served as a captain in the South Korean Marine Corps, the students visited several key institutions to gain a comprehensive understanding of South Korea’s criminal justice and national security systems.

The Committee on Women's Athletics then selects the winner from the nine finalists.\n\nThe 2024 NCAA Woman of the Year will be announced in January at the NCAA Convention.\n\nRedding is the second field hockey student-athlete in three years to be selected as Scranton's nominee following Allie Benadon in 2022.\n\nIn recent years, three of Scranton's nominees have gone on to be selected as the Landmark Conference nominee with Erica Licari (women's soccer, 2019), Becca Russo (women's lacrosse/soccer, 2020) and Teresa Hegarty (women's soccer, 2023).\n\n\"I am so thrilled that Katie has been chosen as The University of Scranton's NCAA Woman of the Year nominee. Katie truly exemplifies what it means to be a Division III student-athlete and a University of Scranton Royal. Whether she is on the field or in the classroom, Katie has been an inspiring leader who challenges herself to be the very best she can be,\" head coach Colleen Moyer said. \"She is an exceptional student, an All-American athlete and a two-year captain. Her impact on our team and The University of Scranton community has been extraordinary and it is an honor to be her coach.\"\n\nThe Havertown, Pa., native has put together a spectacular career for the Royals as she has earned NFHCA All-American honors in each of the last two seasons. Redding is the program's all-time leader in assists (24) and points (132) while ranking second in goals (54).\n\nRedding is also a three-time NFHCA All-Region and three-time All-Landmark Conference selection. She has been named as the conference's Offensive Player of the Year in both 2022 and 2023 along with being selected as Rookie of the Year in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, the two-time captain was named as an NFHCA Senior All-Star and holds the program's single-season assist record with 11 during the 2021 campaign.\n\nThe Royals have posted an impressive 45-11 record for a winning percentage of .804 over the last three years, which includes a 2021 Landmark Conference title and NCAA Sweet 16 appearance.\n\nIn the classroom, Redding earned her Bachelor's Degree in Occupational Therapy from Scranton with a 3.42 GPA and was a three-time Dean's List honoree. A Spanish minor, she was inducted into the Alpha Mu Gamma World Languages Honor Society this spring.\n\nRedding served as a volunteer for the Del Carmen Foundation and held a used equipment drive where all gear collected was donated to orphan children in Venezuela who dream of being athletes one day. She was also a Teaching Assistant in an Occupational Therapy course and has worked in The University's Sports Information office for each of the last two years.\n\nFurthermore, she served as a translator for the Leahy Physical Therapy Clinic, that is run by University of Scranton students to provide PT services for uninsured and/or underinsured residents of The University Area community.\n\nThe element of community service is incorporated into several Occupational Therapy courses with activities such as adapting toys for children with physical disabilities, visiting nursing homes and planting flowers with veterans.\n\nRead more.\n\nThe University of Scranton offers two student study abroad opportunities for residential and online students within the Master of Health Administration (MHA), and/or Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs. These study-abroad opportunities involve established partnerships with St. Elizabeth University in Slovakia, and the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. Both study-abroad opportunities focus on developing research topics and presenting them to other students, physicians, faculty, and other executives at each of these universities. A Global Health Specialization can also be added to either of these degrees. There are currently two 10-day study-abroad opportunities in both Eastern Europe and South America.\n\nPast study-abroad students have visited countries such as Brazil, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary and the Netherlands. This specialization aims to enhance healthcare leadership skills with a global perspective, preparing students to collaborate with relief organizations, government agencies, and leaders in various countries. Participants gain firsthand experience addressing challenges in international healthcare systems, develop intercultural communication skills, and engage in discussions on global health management, public health, and social justice. Each 10-day travel course contributes three credits to the curriculum.\n\nStudents who are interested in studying abroad can contact Dr. Dan West at daniel.west@scranton.edu, or Dr. Steven Szydlowski at steven.szydlowski@scranton.edu.\n\nSouth America Study Abroad\n\nStudents who embark on the South America study abroad trip will join the professors and other students for a 10-day trip to the country of Brazil. The group tours hospitals and other healthcare organizations in the cities of São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro to better understand the Brazilian healthcare system. Each study abroad trip is planned differently due to the schedules of the healthcare organizations. In São Paulo, the group may tour two to three major hospitals; Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, Hospital Sírio-Libanês, and the Institute of Cancer of São Paulo. The students will also experience the famous Paulista Avenue, which consists of several museums, themed restaurants, shopping malls, a park, and theaters.\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, students will visit the famous Santa Marta Favela, experiencing firsthand the challenges of a marginalized population community, and socioeconomic disparity. Additionally, a tour of PUC-RIO University will show how education is handled in Brazil. The students will also have the opportunity to visit many famous tourist locations throughout Rio de Janeiro, including Copacabana Beach, Ipanema Beach, Lapa Steps, Sugarloaf Mountain, and the famous Christ the Redeemer statue, which is considered one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. Resume-building opportunities will be available to present research where they will engage with other students, physicians, faculty, and other executives. The presentation topics can range from deforestation of the Amazon, comparing pay-per-performance with other countries, prenatal care access, and many other topics that are related to both healthcare and Brazil.\n\nEastern Europe Study Abroad\n\nStudents who embark on the Eastern Europe study abroad trip will join the professors and other students for a 10-day trip to the countries of Slovakia, Austria, Netherlands, Czech Republic, and Hungary. The group tours hospitals and other healthcare organizations within Slovakia to better understand the Slovak healthcare system. The group will also visit St. Elizabeth University located within Bratislava. Each study abroad trip is planned differently due to the schedules of the healthcare organizations.\n\nThe group will spend a tour day in Amsterdam, Prague, Budapest and Vienna. During this tour day, the students will visit popular tourist locations, and learn about each city's history. Students will walk and cruise down the famous Amsterdam canals, explore the Charles Bridge and Old Town Square in Prague, visit the Hofburg and the Historic Center of Vienna, tour the Bratislava Castle, and see other famous locations.\n\nResume-building opportunities will be available to present research where they will engage with other students, physicians, faculty, and other executives. The presentation topics can range from long-term care, adolescent obesity, artificial intelligence, and many other topics that are related to both healthcare.\n\nPerhaps proving the durable value of a University of Scranton education, two alumni who graduated six years apart were awarded Fulbright Student Scholarships, the prestigious international academic exchange opportunity provided competitively by the U.S. Government.\n\nFor the 2024-2025 academic year, Shelby A. Traver ’24, Sweet Valley, received a Fulbright Open Study/Research Award to examine the effect of Rwanda’s election quota system for female candidates. Adrian Laudani ’18, Valley Stream, New York, received a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Award to further develop teaching and mentoring skills in Spain while helping students learning English.\n\nFulbright awards are based on academic achievement and demonstrated leadership abilities within a person’s field.\n\nWith these two additions, 131 University of Scranton students have been awarded Fulbrights since 1972.\n\n“The Scranton graduates awarded Fulbright Student Scholarships this year are outstanding ambassadors for the United States and for the University. They are strong, intelligent, passionate and compassionate women who have committed themselves to help serve others transition into new roles and a new life,” said Kara Kofira Bishop, University of Scranton Fulbright Program adviser and manager of study abroad and international fellowships.\n\nShelby Traver ’24\n\nDespite growing up in a post “women’s lib” world, Shelby Traver at times “felt judged” in the male-dominated pursuits of business major, karate student and school debate. “It never really bothered me,” she said, but “at certain times I would think ‘you would not be saying this to me if I were a man.”\n\nIn true Jesuit style, she has never assumed malice – “sometimes they just don’t understand it’s hurtful” – but she has been drawn into gender justice issues, initially by the protests against Iranian mandates for female clothing. An independent studies class on quotas further piqued her interest. “I think they are one of the most fascinating political instruments because they work so differently in so many different places.\n\n“I just kept coming across Rwanda as this country that is kind of a paragon for supporting women, at least in the political arena.”\n\nFollowing a stretch of internal struggles and genocide against the Tutsi in 1994, Rwanda worked to unify with a new constitution that requires at least 30 percent of both houses of parliament be women. But “that acted as a floor instead of a ceiling,” Traver said. The women who first got elected through the quota later got re-elected on their own success, opening up the quota seats for more women. Now the parliament is 61 percent female, the highest percentage for a parliament in the world.\n\nBy comparison, she notes, at the federal level the U.S. “gets 24% in a good year.”\n\nThe Fulbright award will allow her to spend nine months living in Huye, considered Rwanda’s academic capital, with visits to Kigali, the political capital.\n\nUniversity of Rwanda-Huye senior lecturer Ismael Buchanan, Ph.D., has offered to mentor Traver during her research, and to provide contacts for potential interviews. “I would love to interview people, especially in government and academics, who study these things.”\n\nThe native of Sweet Valley in Ross Township, Luzerne County, will also have the chance to take courses at the University of Rwanda, and to improve her French, one of the country’s four official languages. She’s hoping to pick up some Swahili as well. And with luck, she’ll get a little time to see the sights of a country famous for exotic vistas and animal preserves.\n\nThere’s one more thing. “A big part of being a Fulbright scholar is being a cultural ambassador for the U.S.. I’m not only going to do research but I’m going to talk about my own country,” she said. “It’s an amazing way to share between two cultures.”\n\nTraver has been overseas before, as part of a University of Scranton trip to the West Bank of Palestine for a class on Christianity in the Middle East with Michael Azar, Ph.D., associate professor of theology and religious studies. “That was a really transformative moment, seeing how important it is for people to be heard,” she said. Many there are “never really listened to.” She also lived in France for seven weeks studying international business.\n\nHaving three majors as an undergraduate – international business, political science and philosophy – as well as a minor in French, Traver admits “I didn’t sleep much for four years.” She was a member of the University’s Special Jesuit Liberal Arts Honors Program and was the recipient of the University’s full-tuition Presidential Scholarship. She was awarded a Slattery Humanities Center Student Fellowship and President’s Summer Research Fellowship. Amazingly, she still found time to mentor at-risk students; serve as vice-president of The University of Scranton College Democrats, as well as a student organizer for the Gender Justice Dialogue Series; and make the Pi Sigma Alpha political science honor society, Alpha Sigma Nu Jesuit Honor Society and Pi Gamma Mu social sciences honor society. Traver was also a member of Kania Women in Business, served as alumni chair for the Kania Student Advisory Board and was a student organizer for the Gender Justice University Dialogue\n\nA graduate of Lake-Lehman High School and a summa cum laude graduate of Scranton, Traver received the University’s Excellence in International Business Award at commencement.\n\nAfter nine months in Rwanda Traver plans to get her doctorate in women in politics, hoping to change those “hurtful comments.”\n\n“I hope I can help create a world where it doesn’t happen,” she said. “It’s a lofty dream, but I hope to take at least a little bit of a chisel to it.”\n\nAdrian Laudani ’18\n\nAdrian Laudani has always had an affinity for the issues immigrants face. She worked closely with international students as an undergraduate at The University of Scranton, and most recently has been aiding migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border for more than two years.\n\n.\n\nWhile attending The University of Scranton, she participated in Campus Ministry’s International Service Program to Guatemala, and spent a semester in Rome studying Italian and theology. Originally from Valley Stream in Long Island, New York, Laudani earned a Bachelors of Science in counseling and human services with a concentration in human development and a double minor in Italian and theology/religious studies. As a Resident Assistant, she won the ‘Program of the Year’ award for an initiative she started with the global exchange community.\n\nAfter graduating from Scranton in 2018, she served one year with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, where as a case manager, she resettled refugees in the greater Atlanta area. “I offered general transitional support and helped with adaptation, but not in the sense that families just arrived and now need to assimilate. It’s about meeting people’s needs where they are, recognizing that they’ve experienced a lot of trauma and are in a delicate situation, adults and children alike.”\n\nLaudani went on to earn a Masters of Arts in International Studies at the University of San Francisco, a sister Jesuit university, where she received the “Best Overall Thesis” award for her research on the quality of the refugee resettlement program in the United States. She also worked in Italy for Spring Hill College’s study abroad program, and ran immersion programs that took students to the Nogales, San Diego-Tijuana and Dominican Republic-Haiti borders. “These experiences have really allowed me to live out my Jesuit values of serving others. As I continue to be in these spaces, I find that my passion to work with immigrants, refugees and international students has grown even greater,” said Laudani.\n\nWorking at the U.S.-Mexico border led logically to her studying Spanish. She has spent time with children and families living in shelters on both sides of the border. Through her work, she wanted to “help families feel like the U.S. is going to become home, and not just a place they landed after having fled their homeland due to war, violence or things of that nature.”\n\nBeing a neighboring country to her parent’s first country of Italy, applying for a Fulbright Award to Spain was a natural lure. After learning about migrant pathways coming through southern Spain, she said “I wanted to dive deeper.” The Fulbright will allow Laudani to work part-time in a classroom at the University of Málaga as an English Teaching Assistant. She also plans to continue her work with refugees with the Jesuit Refugee Service in the nearby city of Seville.\n\nHer long list of accomplishments while at Scranton include membership in Alpha Mu Gamma, the foreign language honor society, Theta Alpha Kappa, the theology honor society, and Tau Upsilon Alpha, the human services honor society.\n\nWhile formal studies at The University of Scranton are several years behind her, Laudani continues to draw support from the connections made here. “I’ve definitely stayed in touch with some of my mentors,” she said, citing Barbara King, student life coordinator, who was in Campus Ministry during her undergraduate years. “I continue to feel close to Scranton”.\n\nOnce the nine months in Spain are done, Laudani plans to keep doing what she’s been doing, either in Europe or the United States. “I’m open to working with migrants journeying through the Mediterranean, or coming back to the U.S. to work at the intersection of higher education and immigration. I could see myself working at a university with international students or going back to the nonprofit world continuing direct service with refugees and migrants.”\n\nBy: Ava Aversa ‘26, student correspondent\n\nAs a radio intern working with Seven Mountains Media in Stroudsburg, Sally Hopkins ‘26, gained experience working for different radio personalities that sparked career possibilities.\n\nHopkins, a rising junior, lives in East Stroudsburg. The advertising / public relations and journalism / electronic media double major discusses her on-the-job experience.\n\nDescribe a typical day at work.\n\n“At my internship, I shadow one to two members of the company for a span of two hours. Depending on the day and person I shadow, I can either be very hands-on or observe. The people I work with include promotions, traffic, program directors, sales and on-air staff. On Tuesdays, I attend both the sales and the promotion meetings. I spend a lot of my time having fun getting to know my coworkers, as well as singing along to the radio with them. I also have many atypical days where I help with events, including the Pride Festival, Stuff the Bus and various remotes. I always have a ton of fun shouting at strangers to take some free stickers!”\n\nWhat is the time frame for your internship?\n\n“My internship started in late May and ends in mid-August. I was also sponsored to attend the national Confer Radio Talent Institute in May. I will be working 180 hours total.”\n\nWhat are some skills you have learned?\n\n“Some skills I have learned are music directing, traffic directing, board operating, audio editing, promotion and communication skills, and on-air voice tracking.”\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about your job?\n\n“I love everything about my job, but if I had to pick my favorite part, it would be the atmosphere of the people who run it. The people at this station remind me so much of [NBC's] “The Office.” Each member is quirky, funny, and loveable. When it comes to my actual career, it can be hard to decide on taking an advertising, public relations, radio, or TV route, but I know that my personality aligns perfectly with the characters in the radio industry. This internship has shown me a place I can be myself every day.”\n\nWhat was your expectation going into the job? Does it match the reality?\n\n“Since the Promotions Director is my boss, I expected most of my internship to be sending out mail and attempting to gain listeners and sponsors. However, that is only a small part of what I do. I am very surprised and impressed at the quality of my internship, and how many different parts of operating a radio station I get to see.\"\n\nHow do you feel that this job has prepared you for the real world?\n\n\"This internship has provided me with a solid blueprint of where I hope to see myself post-graduation. No matter what part of the radio industry I land in, I know that I want to be a part of it to continue to express myself, enjoy going to work every day, and be where I am a valued member of the company. Every day, I hear the same commercial that Seven Mountains Media runs on its own stations, where owner Kristin Cantrell says, 'My father always told me that if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life. Well here at Seven Mountains Media, we love what we do.' I think that quote describes my opinion of the company perfectly.\"\n\nTwenty-Two members of The University of Scranton’s class of 2024 graduated from the University Honors Program, which is one of the Jesuit university’s programs of excellence.

The event took place on May 4 at Fitzpatrick Field, located on the University’s campus.\n\nA hands-on opportunity for students in the University's Kania School of Management, SoccerFest 2024 encompassed all aspects of the managing the event, from registration to marketing, to the organization of the play itself.\n\nDr. Cocieru described the second annual tournament for soccer players of middle and high school ages as a \"transformational experience.\"\n\n\"The Sports Event Management course creates an environment that is very similar to real organizations, and students learn from real experience. Student development transcends the content of the course because students' collaboration and decisions have a real-world, positive impact on the community,\" said Dr. Cocieru.\n\n\"For many of them, it is a transformational experience. I am very proud of them for how they developed and for what they achieved.\"\n\nThe students said the course required out-of-the-box thinking.\n\n\"I had a fantastic experience, different than any class I've ever taken. I like that in this class we had the opportunity to make something real happen,\" said Brendan Karolchyk, a senior with a major in marketing.\n\n\"I was able to treat this more like an internship than a traditional class. I felt I could get out of it what I put into it. I pushed myself to think outside the box, try new things, and do something that I'd never done before.\"\n\nStudents appreciated the ability to connect with the local community.\n\n\"My favorite part of the class was the event itself, because I was able to see a lot of the local high schools and U12 and U14 divisions play,\" Yasmin Ramirez, a senior with a major in management and minors in business analytics and operations management.\n\n\"Since I'm local, I was able to see some of my friends play and some of the people that I've coached before play. That was a lot of fun!\"\n\nThe event generated a profit of $754.17, which the class donated to the American Breast Cancer Foundation.\n\n\"I had the best experience with this course. I got to work with an amazing team. I can now say I have eight new friends,\" said Mary Kate McDade, a junior with a major in marketing and management and a minor in business leadership.\n\nParticipating students included Emily Bannon '25, Angelina Giannakopoulos' 24, Brendan Karolchyk '24, Bridget Lear '24, Mary Kate McDade '25, Ryan Nguyen '24, Yasmin Ramirez '24, Alyvia Schiavone '25, Nicole Smith '24, and Joseph Weinstein '24.\n\n\"I want to thank Dr. Mark Higgins, Dean of the Kania School of Management, Dr. Murli Rajan, Associate Dean, and Debbie Parry, Assistant Dean of Operations, for their unwavering support of this project, said Dr. Cocieru.\n\n\"Also, special thanks to Steve Kingman, Athletic Facilities Manager, and all the staff from University Advancement, Police, and Maintenance Departments for all their support of our students in this class. Also special thanks to all the volunteers at our event! SoccerFest would not have been possible without them!\"\n\nThe results and the teams can be viewed at https://soccerfest.org/schedule.\n\nThe University of Scranton honored 56 members of its undergraduate class of 2024 for academic excellence, leadership and service at a Class Night Ceremony on campus May 17.\n\nStudents with the highest GPA in each of the University’s three undergraduate colleges were presented Frank J.

Our new, budding college experience was overshadowed by serious health, economic, and social problems,” said Nelson. “We witnessed an incredible, yet slow, rekindling of the spirit in the community around us. Social interaction was difficult, yet here we are four long-yet-short years later surrounded by friends that will last a lifetime. … What we’ve encountered is a community of resilience despite change, and I think that community has a lot to do with who we’ve become.”\n\nRev.
