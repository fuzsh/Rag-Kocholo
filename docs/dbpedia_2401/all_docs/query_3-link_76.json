        "text": "HAPPY FATHERS DAY | Roberts Co is invested in improving our industry and making it a place for everyone to thrive. Our focus is on the holistic wellbeing of workers – in the workplace, at home and in their hearts. As part of this focus, Roberts Co implement various ‘Our People’ initiatives to provide the best framework for a holistic lifestyle. This includes paid parental leave up to 18 weeks for all primary carers, various forms of workplace flexibility and championing a 5-day work week across six projects to date. Research has shown that not only does this improve the mental wellbeing of all workers, but it also allows fathers and mothers to have more quality time with their children and their partners. Roberts Co believes it’s only fair and decent to give all parents the opportunity to watch their kids play sport, attend their activities and performances, and celebrate special occasions together as a family unit, every weekend. With Father’s Day this Sunday, our team would like to say thank you to all of the fathers and grandfathers across our industry and beyond. We wish you and your families all the best for a well-deserved, enjoyable weekend with your loved ones!

Last week, eight members of our MEL9 ARS Facility team, alongside two colleagues from our client LOGOS, spent the morning volunteering with the Merri Creek Management Committee. Together, the team laid weed matting and planted at Creekline Tussock Grassland - a once common, now endangered vegetation area located just down the road from our Craigieburn distribution centre site. One of the highlights of the day was hearing the distinctive call of the endangered Growling Grass Frog, one of the many species that call this area home. Thank you to Merri Creek Management Committee for facilitating the day and for our team for supporting such a positive initiative. #Community #Sustainability #BuildABetterWay\n\nDREAM TEAM | With over five years at Roberts Co, Project Manager William Service has been a cornerstone of our success. William kicked off his career in the industry in 2008 as an undergraduate on the Royal North Shore Hospital redevelopment, and quickly rose through the ranks.

Most recently at Roberts Co, William led the Macquarie Exchange (MQX4) project to completion, a 9-storey commercial building in Macquarie Park, hitting impressive sustainability targets including a 6 Star Green Star Design and As-built rating, 5.5 Star NABERS Energy rating, 4.5 Star NABERS Water rating, WELL Silver certification, WiredScore Platinum, and industry-leading Smart Building technologies.
