        "text": "We have welcomed many new students to the College as well as a number of new staff this year. Whilst many students have commenced their education with us in year 7, we also have students who have joined us in year 1, year 4 and year 9. Across our campuses, we now have 78 students enrolled at St Mary’s, all of whom we are looking forward to seeing grow and flourish over the year.\n\nOpening assembly\n\nAs is tradition, we started the year with a St Mary’s Opening Assembly where all students and staff came together to recoginse our award winners, acknowledge our student campus leaders and build their connection to other students who are also deaf or hard of hearing. Having this opportunity adds to each student’s sense of who they are. Recognising that hearing loss is just one part of their identity and viewing it as a difference or positive part of their personal, social and academic identity can help students feel more settled and connected in their school community. It was wonderful to see many of our parents join us on the day and have an opportunity to meet with other parents from across the school. We try to rotate the campus hosting the event each year to cater for all our families living across Melbourne. In 2024, we anticipate we will hold the assembly at our Tarenit campus within Thomas Carr College.\n\nSchool Improvement Plan\n\nEach year the College reviews its work towards improving outcomes for students and identifies key areas that will become the focus for the year. We have been delighted with the improvement our students have made in writing, with almost all students making more than one years’ growth over the past 12 months. Knowing that reading is always a challenge for students with a hearing loss, we want to ensure our students are not slipping behind and as such, have decided to make impactful reading instruction a focus for 2023. I look forward to sharing with you the positive impact this will make on our students’ reading skill over the year.\n\nTeacher PD day\n\nOn Monday 24th April, all St Mary’s teachers will come together at our Wantirna South campus to learn more about the science behind reading and how this can be applied to students who are deaf and hard of hearing. Many of our partner schools are having a student free / professional learning day on that day and so this will not impact most students. Our Wantirna South campus students will be well supported by our Learning Support Officers and the wonderful Holy Trinity teachers.\n\nReports & PAM\n\nOne of the advantages of having our own Parent Access Module is that now students and parents can see what they are learning and how they are going as they learn. We understand that it is a little inconvenient having 2 different logins, but know that it is a wonderful opportunity to get a complete picture of your child’s progress. I would encourage you to log on to St Mary’s College Parent Access Module (PAM) when you can. Please don’t hesitate to contact your child’s teacher or Head of Campus if you have any questions about assessment and reports.\n\nCampusSt Mary’s subject assessments, Personal Learning Plans (PLPs),\n\nMedical Information, commendations for PBL, contact informationPartner school subject assessments, attendance, PTIs.DandenongSt Mary’s Parent Access ModuleSt John’s SEQTARingwoodSt Mary’s Parent Access ModuleAquinas Parent Access Module (PAM)South MorangSt Mary’s Parent Access ModuleMarymede Parent Access Module (PAM)SunburySt Mary’s Parent Access ModuleSalesian College SchoolboxTarneitSt Mary’s Parent Access ModuleThomas Carr Parent Access Module (PAM)Wantirna SouthSt Mary’s Parent Access Module\n\nInclusive Education\n\nOn the 23rd March I was invited to speak as part of an expert panel on Inclusive Education at The Age Education Summit. Whilst there are a lot of interpretations around what inclusive education is, one thing that is generally agreed upon is the right of every child to learn alongside their same-aged peers in an environment that gives them the same access and opportunities as any other child. St Mary’s College was chosen to talk about the innovative way we have interpreted this idea which involves retaining all the benefit of having expert advice and teaching available every day to ensure learning is designed for students who are deaf or hard of hearing whilst providing all the benefits and opportunities of local mainstream schools. By bringing St Mary’s expert staff and students into each partner school, it allows our students and families to select an educational program that is designed specifically for them. The success of this model can be seen in the amazing results and post school destination of our 2022 school leavers, all of whom are now successfully pursuing their dream pathway to employment.\n\n75th Anniversary Celebrations\n\nThis year marks the 75th year of St Mary’s providing an education to deaf and hard of hearing children in Victoria. We have a number of past students and current staff working on events that will run across our campuses later in the year. I look forward to sharing more information about this exciting time over the coming months.\n\nSchool Advisory Council\n\nWe are delighted to welcome Dilani Rasanayagam as a parent representative to our School Advisory Council this year and would like to thank Cara Patterson for accepting the role of SAC chair. The work of the council is very important in ensuring parent voice and community perspective influence and support decisions made for the good of school where students’ wellbeing and outcomes are paramount. If you have an interest in joining our School Advisory Council, we would welcome your involvement. Please contact Lexie at our administration office on 9800 2733 or admin@smdeaf.vic.edu.au for more information.\n\nEnrolments\n\nEnrolments are currently open for:\n\nPrep 2024 (closing Wednesday 31 May 2023)\n\nYear 7 2025 (closing Friday 18 August 2023)\n\nA small number of places at other year levels for 2023 and 2024 at our Dandenong, Tarneit Wantirna South and South Morang campuses.\n\nPlease visit the College website or contact Lexie at our administration office on 9800 2733 or admin@smdeaf.vic.edu.au for more information.\n\nI hope you enjoy learning more of the fabulous events and learnings that have occurred across our college over term 1 ."
