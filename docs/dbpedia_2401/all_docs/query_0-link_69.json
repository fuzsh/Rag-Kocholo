        "text": "Many students worldwide engage in lessons on a music instrument; the most common format for this type of learning is the one-to-one or studio lesson where the master guides the apprentice. At the same time, the one-to-one or studio lesson is an isolated area of practice, given that it takes place behind closed doors. In addition, while the literature for classroom music teachers is substantial with regard to investigating how they describe their own previous teaching experiences or the general characteristics of effective teachers, in comparison there are few studies that explore what music instrument teachers believe are effective characteristics and attributes of their previous teachers and lessons. In order to address this problem, this exploratory article focuses on the reflections of current higher education performing arts teachers; specifically music instrument teachers and their experiences of teachers and lessons. Survey data were obtained from 171 practitioners from nine nations. The respondents were asked to reflect on their initial, pre-tertiary and tertiary lesson experiences and teachers, and to identify the most significant influences on their learning. The data reveal a number of findings, such as the dominance of the master-apprentice social and learning relationship, the characteristics and attributes of inspiring teachers and/or learning experiences, and the fact that some respondents do not have any positive reflections on some periods of their learning. The data also point towards the cyclical nature of music instrument learning and teaching, with masters guiding apprentices who then become the masters.\n\nThe teaching experience is a communication process that nurtures social intelligence, encourages self-knowledge and improves one’s learning abilities. Teachers experience this on a daily basis – but the same benefits of teaching can also be enjoyed by the students themselves. The object of my research paper is to observe how a child can learn by “Practicing the Role of the Teacher”, an approach to music that applies a different, enriching perspective that is free of conditioning factors normally associated with personal study. Such an experience enables the child to learn to value and share the teaching- learning process with others. This practical unit was carried out with piano students of the Conservatorio Profesional de Musica de Zaragoza (Spain) over the entire course of the 2016/17 academic year. The “teaching child” and the “learning child” are roles that can be adopted and interchanged under teacher supervision. Children participated in this activity on a periodical basis. T...\n\nPiano education is popular in today’s world, no matter it is in Hong Kong, China, Japan, the United States or the United Kingdom. Here in Hong Kong, it is a commonplace for many Hong Kong students to attend the music exam held by the Associated Board of Royal School each year to pursue their professional qualification. This phenomenon triggered my interest in conducting studies on piano education delivery and its development in different countries from the past to the modern time by reviewing different literatures, which are both credible and reliable and published by music or piano pedagogues, and are often cited in many music education studies. The content of my thesis not only covered the history of piano education from the eighteenth to the twentieth century, but also provided information on piano beginners, intermediate and higher education and its development in a logical order. Further, this thesis also introduced the interactions and relationship between teachers and students, and the suggested method books for beginners. Discussions related to the changes in the role in piano education from the eighteenth to twentieth century, the change in the approach and teaching materials used in piano education in the twenty-first century and the current situation of Hong Kong piano education were presented at the end of this thesis.\n\nThe present study investigates what makes and what does not make an ideal music teacher according to secondary school students’ views and perceptions. Is it a matter of personality characteristics, subject knowledge, and skills or a matter of pedagogy? Or is it a combination of the aforementioned? And more specifically, what are those qualities, personal characteristics, and competencies of the ideal music teacher through the eyes of students? 518 secondary school students participated in the study by completing an anonymous questionnaire. The findings reveal that the characteristics of the ideal music teacher deemed more important for secondary school students fall mainly in the category of personality and interpersonal characteristics, with pedagogical and subject knowledge and skills following, with much smaller percentages. The students’ voices call firstly for a polite, friendly, with sense of humor, kind teacher, patient, pleasant, fair, and creative. By building on the findin..."
