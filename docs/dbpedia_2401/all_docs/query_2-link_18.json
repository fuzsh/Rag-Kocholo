        "text": "Lead Educator: Shelby Ackerman, a lifelong resident of Ringwood, has dedicated her career to working with children. With a B.S. from Rutgers University in Community Nutrition and coursework in Early Childhood Education at Caldwell University, Shelby has a passion for helping to nourish the whole child.\n\nShelby began her career as an educator, working as a preschool teacher in town. From there, Shelby continued to forge her path in education and wellness. She became the lead nutritionist at Whole Foods Market where she held nutrition classes for children and adults. Before leaving the workforce to homeschool her three children, Shelby served as an ABA Therapist in a public school where she integrated into mainstream classes to differentiate instruction.\n\nShelby enjoys spending long days outside, exploring and learning side by side with her children about the world around them. Creating art from nature, listening to and making music, gardening, cooking, and experimenting with new ways to make meaning are just a few of the skills she brings with her to the Roots & Wings Academy classroom."
