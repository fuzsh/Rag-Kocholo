        "text": "Congratulations to everyone on reaching the end of a very successful year.\n\nThe newsletter that you are receiving is a showcase of the many opportunities available for students here @ TC. I believe reading through the newsletter demonstrates that there really is something for everyone here @ TC which allows all of our students to be able to base their education on their own strengths and passions. I hope that you enjoy reading through those areas of the newsletter that interest you, as well as seeing what else takes place.\n\nWith this being written at VCE results time, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all VCE Students, including our VCE VM students. Everyone did superbly and you should be very proud. As part of this we have many students challenging the status quo around what a successful school education looks like, with outcomes such as VCE, VM and non-ATAR pathways all being used to move onto further education or apprenticeships.\n\nWe do have a few staff leaving us this year. Whilst this number is lower than it has been in the past, I would like to thank all our staff for their work here @ TC. We wish all the best to Darren, Penny, Thomas, James, Mark, Meni and Jemma in their future endeavours.\n\nWe look forward with optimism towards 2024. We move into year 2 of our new school strategic plan titled “TC - The Next Level” which will see us continue to enact our new purpose of “to challenge the status quo, so that everyone is empowered to learn”. We will be starting the year with a focus on the Department of Education measures of stimulating learning, looking at what students see as an “inspirational teacher” and what makes the learning in class interesting to them with the view to increasing the positive levels that students report in these areas.\n\nWe will be slightly bigger in student numbers (but the size of this may not be noticeable when we have everyone back on site) as interest in TC and our progressive form of education continues to grow. We will have about 1275 students as part of our community and over 130 staff which will be exciting as each one of these members works together to support each other to learn and grow.\n\nI want to finish by wishing everyone a safe holiday. I look forward to welcoming everyone back in 2024. We truly have a great school with a great community, and I am looking forward to seeing how we continue to improve even further next year.\n\nPeter Ellis\n\nPrincipal\n\nFARM CAMP 2023\n\nFarm Camp was such a fun experience. We laughed over jokes, slipped in waterfalls, ate delicious food, petted adorable animals, watched Duncan get headbutted by a sheep, fed miniature goats, and watched the sunset go down on the top of Mount Pilot.\n\nAs we ventured to different farms, I learnt so much and had so many fun times. I learnt all about how bees pollinate flowers and work around their queen bee, how to cut lambs tails off before maggots eat them, how to set up a tent and sleep under the stars, and how grass and pressure relate.\n\nThe first farm we went to was a miniature highland cow and sheep farm. The lady there taught us how to hold a baby lamb, and all about how to breed different sheep together to create a new breeds. We fed miniature highland cows hay, pet-named them, and patted their coarse fur.\n\nAfter leaving that farm, on the way to the campsite, our trailer broke down and we were delayed by about two or three hours on the way to set up camp. Because of that, at ten o’clock at night, with headtorches strapped to our heads, we fumbled around in the dark and built our tents. At about 10:30pm we ate a barbecue dinner and then practically fell into bed with tiredness.\n\nThe next farm we went to the next day was a fantastic sheep farm. The guy there had a cute little dog named Milton who accompanied us on our tour around his paddocks. He sold his sheep to the meat industry, but you could tell that he loved his animals and cared heaps about them.\n\nThe next farm we went to was another sheep meat farm. However, this one had around 3000 sheep and their animals were cramped up in a small pen. We watched them getting weighed and saw how the process of moving them all worked. They also specialised in lupin grain and oats, and they had lots of machinery that they used to plant seeds and move their animals. They also had a cute dog who looked exactly like Milton, who was very cuddly and friendly.\n\nThe last farm we went to that day was an organic beef farm. The couple who ran the farm owned a few hundred cows and were also very interested in the plants that they grew and the plant agriculture. After that farm, we headed back to the camp site and had a Taco Tuesday themed dinner night. Some of us played cards and giggled uncontrollably, while others played murder in the dark and chatted.\n\nThe next day, our first farm visit was to Granden Park, a farm that had wide variety of animals including horses, ponies, goats, lambs and sheep, chickens, guinea fowl, lots and lots of dogs and guinea pigs that we didn’t quite have time to see. They had adult chihuahuas and lots of chihuahua puppies. They also had Maremma dogs and a border collie kelpie cross. We learned about goats and sheep while we were there, and we haltered a pony and had heaps of snuggly dog cuddles.\n\nAfter saying goodbye to the puppies and other animals, we headed to a hobby farm in the form of an air BNB that had miniature goats, sheep, and a pig, plus cows, chickens, and turkeys. There, we patted the miniature animals, and some of us helped put rings round lambs’ tails to prevent maggots from eating them. We also fed the cows bread from our own mouths and kissed their slimy noses when they came close.\n\nThe last farm on Wednesday was a demonstration of how stock dogs herd sheep. We met two gorgeous and friendly kelpies and then watched them herd the sheep – one was very experienced and the other took a little more coaxing and training.\n\nAfter that, we headed back to camp and got ready to walk up a mountain. Mt Pilot was a beautiful area to watch the stunning sunset go down. Rays of gold bathed our faces and the ground we sat on as we watched the sun dip behind another mountain. After all the light had disappeared, we headed back down the mountain and then back to the campsite. We set up a fire and stayed there for an hour, snacking on pretzels and chocolate biscuits. After that, we snuggled into bed wrapped in lots of layers of clothing because it was so freezing.\n\nThe next morning, we headed to bee school, where we learned about the different types of bees and completed different activities. Then we tasted about 20 different types of honey, scooping the rich sticky syrup into our mouths and enjoying ourselves. After that, we had free roam in the town of Beechworth for two and a half hours. We went into op-shops, walked along the street, gorged ourselves on lollies, and bought five-dollar ice-creams. We picked up great bargains like multiple pairs of shoes, a book series, a shirt that gave off an extreme farm girl vibe and a few other items. We met lots of new people on the streets and in shops and laughed and chatted. We also took endless pictures.\n\nThe last farm we went to was a poultry farm. The guy there let us hold day old chicks and we learnt all about the difference between hens and roosters. After our last farm on all of Farm Camp, we headed to a waterfall to splash in the shallow water. Many of us slipped and laughed hysterically, while others sat on rocks with their feet dipping into the water, pondering the great meaning of life.\n\nWet and exhausted, we headed back to the camp site for a final dinner and night together. We had dinner around the fire, and then toasted marshmallows and plopped them onto biscuits to make smores. After stuffing our bellies with sugar and marshmallow fluff, some of us dragged our sleeping bags out to sleep under the stars on the last night, as per animal camp tradition.\n\nThe next morning, we packed away our gear and tents and stuffed it into the trailer. Then we piled on the bus, thinking we were heading straight to TC with a brief lunch break in between. However, Duncan and Kate surprised us by pulling over across from the poultry farm we had been to last yesterday. They explained to us that they were starting a new tradition – each year they got the students to choose the most helpful and positive student on camp. The top three students got to go into the poultry farm, pick out a chicken each, and bring it back to TC to become part of the animal program. I was one of the lucky students who got chosen by my friends and peers. We chose our chickens, and hopped back on the bus, smiling uncontrollably.\n\nAt the end of Farm Camp, after a week of stepping on poop, laughing over the fire, patting animals, and having so much fun, I highly recommend the camp to anyone who loves animals. Even if you’re just interested in plants or agriculture there is so much that you can do and learn on this camp. You make so many new friends, become close with everyone on the camp, and, best of all, you get to pat animals!\n\nBy Lulu Fyffe Goodall\n\nHighlights/Interviews:\n\nHealesville Study Tour\n\nA group of students went on an excursion on November the 3rd. These students had volunteered to be a part of the team to help plan and create our mega aviary. We took the bus to Healesville Sanctuary.\n\nWe had 3 speakers Tameka, Fisk, and Bec who helped us think up solutions for the problems we had, this proved to be very helpful in deciding some of our decisions. Tameka, Fisk, and Bec showed us around their spaces. We explored various Aviary’s and enclosures in the zoo which helped us to design our mega aviary we are building.\n\nWe ended up going with a design of the path being on one side of the aviary, after they talked about the birds sometimes wanting space from people, and we need it wide enough so it’s wheelchair accessible. We did a lot of problem solving and thinking to decide how we would place everything.\n\nAfter exploring some of the zoo, we headed to the bird show “spirits of the sky”.\n\nWe had two different people running it and various types of birds and we got to watch their behaviours and tricks. It was all very informative interesting and went for about 45 minutes in total. We saw natural behaviours of a variety of native birds which included the Wedge-tailed Eagle, Black-breasted Buzzard, Barking Owl, magnificent parrots and much more.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by their beauty as they flew over our heads and to and from each keeper. We also learnt about their unique characteristics and behaviour of each bird. They told us that no two presentations would be the same, with keepers guided by what the birds choose to do at all times. They then explained how ethical this was that we don’t force any animals to do anything they don’t want to do unless it is a health or safety issue.\n\nThe students can’t wait for all of you to see the final product of the Mega Aviary!\n\nBy Charlotte G and Abbie A\n\nZOO Camp\n\nOliver:\n\nI really enjoyed seeing how a Zoo operates and the work the staff complete. I loved the hikes we went on everyday and the incredible views at the top. The encounter I got to have with the Meerkats was heaps of fun and a really cool experience. It was also nice to meet new people and make new friends, as well as establishing stronger friendships with people I already know. I also enjoyed sleeping under the stars at the sleep out on Thursday night. Zoo camp was overall really fun and I would definitely go again.\n\nSophia:\n\nI signed up for zoo camp after hearing lots of positive feedback about it from the people around me. I heard about feeding giraffes, holding meerkats and patting dingoes, which all seemed exaggerated to me. But when we got to the Zoo I realised there was no exaggeration in what people were saying at all. One of my favourite moments at the Zoo was working in the wombat enclosure, with Bean, the wombat, who was trying to climb into the wheelbarrows as we worked. I also was lucky enough to have a meerkat encounter which was an incredible experience. My favourite thing about the camp was the community of people around me. Sitting around the fire toasting marshmallows, playing forty-forty in the dark, cooking dinner together, going on hikes, etc. I met some amazing people and left the camp with memories I will never forget.\n\nAnnalise:\n\nWhen I sent my expression of interest for zoo camp I wasn’t expecting much. However, when I got there I was almost instantly proven wrong. I realised why people had recommended it so much, and why so many people repeated it again and again. One of the highlights of zoo camp was getting to do a meerkat encounter, which meant I got to feed and pat the meerkats which is one of many good memories I have from camp. I also loved going on the hikes, and getting to talk to new people I wouldn’t have talked to otherwise. Zoo camp will definitely be one of my highlights for all of high school.\n\nDear Blue Community Students and Families,\n\nWhat a great year 2023 has been! I would firstly like to say how much I have enjoyed being your Community Director this year. It has been so lovely getting to know you all individually and supporting your growth throughout the year. I am truly proud of each and every one of you and what you have achieved this year.\n\nWe have had some great successes coming together as a Community, winning the table tennis, drama and gaming competitions! It was so wonderful seeing so many of you participate and come along to support one another. Let’s keep this up in 2024 and add some more events to our trophy cabinet!\n\nI would like to thank our student community leaders, Tya Robinson, Millyca Robinson and Daniel Westein for being such positive role models and advocates for the Blue Community!\n\nI would also like to also give a big shout out to Kate Meehan, Stephanie Lewis, Jacinta Taing and Guy Dickson (maybe he is reading this) for all the support and work they have done this year in the Blue Community. You have been amazing to work with and it truly has been a team effort!\n\nFor 2024, Blue Community welcomes back Anthony Owen as Community Director and Steph Lewis as Community Leader. Kate and I are taking a step back from Community but you can always come find us for a chat and catch up .. and Cleo and Hudson are always up for some attention! 🙂\n\nI wish everyone a safe and happy break over the school holidays. Be sure to take some time to do things that bring you joy and be kind to one another. I look forward to seeing you all back and refreshed in 2024!\n\nMia Cooper-Browne\n\nBlue Community Director\n\nSponge throw showdown! TC’s 2023 Community market\n\nOn Friday the 10th of November, TC held a community twilight Market on the astroturf. It was such a fantastic event, filled with lots of activities, games, and live music! Some of the activities included face painting, a chocolate toss and basketball shootouts.\n\nOne of the best things about the school market was that it was not just limited to students -parents, teachers, and members of the wider community were also invited to attend and hold stalls. It was a lovely afternoon to connect with peers and to have some fun. It brought people together and provided a fun and engaging space for everyone to have a good time. It was also a great reminder of the importance of community and to celebrate one another.\n\nOne of the most exciting parts of the market was the sponge-throwing. Students had the opportunity to throw wet sponges (For free!) at their favourite (or not-so-favourite) teachers.\n\n'It was the best purely because it was such a hot day, and it was good to see everyone having fun!' Kate Dickenson says, and I agree. It was hilarious to watch everyone take their turn and see the teachers get drenched. Sometimes the teachers fought back, targeting individuals which made it even more interesting! It was a great way to cool down in the 30-degree heat.\n\nThe plant sale was one of the highlights for me. There were so many varieties to choose from, including native grasses, herbs, and succulents. In the Nursery, many things were on sale too, like clothes, bags and reusable beeswax wraps. TC Animals even had their 2024 calendars on sale! Shoe balm made by the TC Bee Club and made from TC's very own bee wax could be purchased there as well.\n\nAnother exciting event was the live music. TC's very own Bands such as the Hashbrowns (Listen to their new single 'That Lynwood Parade' now on Spotify) were playing outside the canteen. It was a great way to listen to some cool tunes and unwind in the hot spring heat.\n\nIn addition to the games and activities, there were also plenty of food stalls offering a wide range of tasty treats. La Louche Crepes had a stall where they were selling crepes of all sorts. There were savoury, sweet and a lot of other crepes on sale. The Boba tea was a hit, and so was the baked goods. There truly was something for everyone to enjoy!\n\nBut you may be wondering; What was the idea behind it?\n\nFor Kate Dickenson's Personal learning project this semester, she decided that she wanted to help organize a twilight market in which the community could gather and connect. 'I've run a few markets during school times before, but they've only been small.' She explains. 'So, I asked Meg if it was a possibility to run a bigger one after school and that was how it started! We also asked MAP if they wanted to help out and run some stalls.' This then led to advertising the market, and then when Friday rolled around, everyone pitched in to help get ready for the event.\n\n'And it wasn't about raising money,' Kate says, 'It was about bringing the TC community together, and celebrating the creativity of our school.'\n\nIt was heartwarming to see everyone come out and support each other, and I can't wait for the next one! The community market was a vibrant and lively event that brought everyone together and it truly was a great opportunity for local businesses and vendors to showcase their products. Thanks for reading!\n\nBy Mietta Palmer\n\nTC Journalist\n\nFareShare Community Kitchen\n\nLast week, groups of students from each community here at TC went out into the world to help those experiencing food insecurity.\n\nI went with the Gold Community group, and we all had a fun time. Oliver Conzato said “I enjoyed learning about how the kitchen operates including where they supply their produce from, the preparation for the recipes before cooking, and the packaging process.” FareShare is an organisation that uses volunteers to cook delicious, free meals for the community, all using donated ingredients, such as leftovers from Woolworths. We students got to help chop ingredients, sort the mouldy from the fresh, and pack hundreds of meals for people.\n\nMy group chopped 45kg of carrots, 20kg of broccoli, 15kg of sweet potatoes, pulled apart 40kg of mushrooms, and sorted 30kg of tomatoes to weed out the rotten ones. This led to us packing 264 Tandoori and rice meals for our community. No one could have done that on their own.\n\nAside from the joy of helping others, we also found it fun to socialise with the other volunteers, such as those who were retired and regularly volunteered. We learnt a lot, including those who most often need help from FareShare are university students, as those under 25 aren’t paid adult wages but still have the same living costs, which leaves little room for food expenses. There are so many people like that and in many other living conditions who can’t afford food, which is why it is so important to have volunteers making or donating food for the community.\n\nYou can donate to FareShare or sign up to volunteer through their website. I’m not yet old enough to volunteer outside of a school excursion, but I know that I’m definitely going to sign up right away when I turn 18. It may have been exhausting working for hours, but it sure does feel wonderful knowing how many people you and I can help.\n\nBy Rory Opie\n\nTC Journalist\n\nshark tank - pbl 🌊🦈\n\nThe FLE1's students were tasked with coming up with a solution for one of the United Nations' global sustainability goals in a pressurized environment. Teaching the student that with hard work, a good idea and dedication you can change the world. With $1,000 on the line, the students had to come up with a design brief while learning about the Global Goals for Sustainable Development and doing research associated with their chosen classroom goals. Meg one of the teachers who runs the personal-based learning says \" It was really hard choosing the finalists. Michelle Parker and I went through all the videos equally, we shortlisted them and then we shortlisted again and then we did a final shortlist\" The criteria they looked for were, creativity and depth of the idea as well as how unique the concept was and if it was already being executed. Once the finalists have been chosen they will have the opportunity to meet with the teacher to discuss and refine their ideas and work on how to pitch their ideas in a more professional manner. Before the final winner is chosen and given the $1,000 to create their product and potentially start a business.\n\nCassidy explained to me about why the theme Shark Tank was chosen \"I think that part of the reason Shark Tank was chosen is that it's a concept, familiar to students. Something where students can go 'Ah I have seen that show that's a really fun activity' so you get more student engagement, especially with the idea of there being a $1,000 grant at the end. I think that's a really cool opportunity that a lot of schools don't offer\"\n\nThe students that I interviewed showed a positive attitude towards the PBL task this semester. One of the finalists Max Hester said that he \"enjoyed working on a project with my friends and just getting a chance to do the finals\". Another contestant Zara Mulik explained that she thought the PBL project was \"beneficial on many levels as we worked within a group to learn about a topic we feel passionate about concerning the nature of the society and world we live in.\"\n\nSome of the ideas students came up with were \"Educating children about abortions, as well as designing a service that allowed women to receive affordable and accessible procedures\" said Zara. Another was ''Making ‘new’ clothes out of old, seemingly unwearable clothes'' Nicole Smit explained. One of the finalist groups did \"an app design called ‘Devil Watch’, it was made to help people keep an eye on Tasmanian devils in the wild (citizen science)\". This was Max's group. Enjoying learning new skills and gaining more knowledge about the world, was a common factor when asking about what students enjoyed about this task. \"Over the course of the shark tank project, I enjoyed collaborating with friends and sharing ideas. Teachers were helpful and helped us keep on track of our work\" said Zara.\n\nAt this point you may be wondering what PBL classes are and what they are for well, Meg told me TC had \"made it a priority to do project-based learning empowering students to learn really important skills that are practical in real life. Things like time management, collaborating with others, thinking about a solution to a problem in a creative manner\". Some schools do their own version of PBL, For a whole semester or one lesson a week for a semester or even a year however, TC has decided that they prefer to do the PBL lessons more intensively over a short period of time for example 2 weeks a semester to keep the momentum going and experience continuing because that way it don't impact other classes as regularly but still allowed you to remember what you have learned in class so that you can build on the new skill it in your next set of Personal-based learning classes.\n\nIt has been great to be a part of the Shark Tank PBL and we are looking forward to hearing the finalists pitches on Monday and finding out who wins the exciting $1000 prize to put towards their goal. Stay tuned to TC's social media for the results!\n\nBy Ruby Egan-Douglas\n\nTC Journalist\n\nTC Donations to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre\n\nDuring the last week of school we loaded up the mini bus with the donations you sent into the school during Refugee Week. They were gratefully received by the ASRC staff, who gave us an impromptu tour of the facility including legal and medical support, social workers, English lessons, social area, dining room and the supermarket where asylum seekers can 'shop' for free while maintaining a sense of dignity through being able to choose the things they like and need.\n\nA message from the ASRC:\n\nDear Templestowe College,\n\nThank you for the compassion and commitment you have shown by your donation of food and sanitary items from the Templestowe College community for our ASRC Foodbank.\n\nOur Foodbank operates as a free grocery store for people seeking asylum who live in our community. We support more than 1000 people with essential food, almost half of whom are children. Giving food is the most immediate and tangible way to support people seeking asylum. The majority of all groceries and material aid is donated by generous supporters just like you. We can’t operate our programs without your compassionate contribution.\n\nKind regards, everyone at the ASRC\n\nSuper Smash Brothers Competition\n\nWe had a Super Smash Brothers Competition on the Monday December 11. Will Drogemuller won the competition after a fierce fight with William Doheny, who lost gracefully. Congratulations Will! There were 16 sign ups and 14 students took part. Make sure you sign up for the 2024 tournament.\n\nCommunity Badminton\n\nTuesday the 14th of November marked the launch of Templestowe College’s first ever Community Badminton. The event spanned two lunchtimes and had competitors from all four Communities. The 14th started with the Round of 32, 16 and Quarterfinals, with all seeds and players playing to their absolute best. Top seeds like Max Kong, Tat Quen Tham and Peter Huang had unrivalled performances, brushing aside competitors from the Round of 32 and 16.\n\nThe 21st of November wrapped up the competition with the Semi and Grand Finals, with each match getting higher and higher with amazing shots and near-perfect gameplay. The Semifinals consisted of a colossal clash between titans; Max Kong versus wildcard entry and coach Thomas Kennedy for one half, and Tat Quen Tham versus Peter Huang for the second. Tham versus Huang started swimmingly for Tat, with Peter closing leads with beautiful shots. Despite confusion from the commentators (Nathan Chan, Jamie Sarisky, Chase Clissold and Joharo Harvey-Connellan) and a fair amount of humour, Tat closed the exceptionally played game 21-15.\n\nKong versus Kennedy saw the most exciting clash of the day so far, with Chase Clissold describing it as ‘intense’ and the players ‘both serious.’ Max had a blazing start to the match, with everything from mid-court exchanges and lobs high enough to reach the ceiling. Thomas would not give up so soon though, bringing stiff resistance from time to time. With enough pushing and constant persistence Max closed his Semifinal 21-18.\n\nTham versus Kong marked just another massive showdown between the two powerhouses. The final started with equal trade-offs between points, and the rallies did not disappoint. With both finalists bringing all their skill and experience, the score remained slightly in Max’s favour at the change of ends, at 11-8. The intensity of the game only heightened from there, with Max retaining his lead. Tat had a slight resurgence towards the end, saving three match points but eventually it was too much, with Max taking the game 21-16 and Templestowe College’s maiden 2023 Community Badminton.\n\nWhat a phenomenal year, and what a fab community the Green Community continues to be!! As we near the end of 2023, I want to thank each and every one of you for continuing to be the best versions of yourselves. You should all be so proud of the incredible work and the achievements you have all made.\n\nWhilst some of us maybe didn’t achieve all that we set out to do, I know that everyone really tried to be the best that they could be. It is a great time to reflect on the year that was and really think about what 2024 will look like for you as a student, friend, and family member. Set yourself some goals and continue to reach for the stars.\n\nI wanted to give a special shout out to Vicky Eborall and Leija Harman as the Green Community Leaders. Without them, the green community would not be as amazing as it is. I look forward to continuing to work alongside Vicky in 2024, and wish Leija all the best focusing on her work in the classroom space.\n\nVicky and I look forward to ensuring everyone feels united, connected and experiences a sense of belonging within the green community – working as one to make TC a better place.\n\nI hope everyone has a restful break, stay safe, do something that makes you smile and be kind. I look forward to seeing you all in 2024.\n\nStephanie Marcanio\n\nGreen Community Director\n\nESDP Basketball Update\n\nThe ESDP basketball program finished 2023 off with some significant results for the students involved in the program.\n\nFirstly, the finals of the School Sport Victoria Year 8 Division were held at the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre on October 20th, our girls team qualified for the event, and we are proud to report that they came away State Champions! This made two State Championships for our program with the Senior Boys also winning the State Championship in Term 3.\n\nWe also played several friendly games during the term with our Year 8 equivalent boys and girls visiting Donvale Christian College for a couple of games that saw us win both as well as taking steps towards establishing a good working relationship with the school. This will open up the opportunity for more games in 2024 against boys and girls of all age groups.\n\nOur junior and intermediate students also had the opportunity to compete in friendly tournaments hosted by Berwick Secondary College at the Knox Basketball Stadium. Several other schools with Basketball programs also competed in the days which were both fun and competitive.\n\nThe Australian Schools Championships were held on the Gold Coast from November 26th to December 1st and this year we took both our Senior Boys and Girls teams to compete in the Division 1 competition.\n\nI’m happy to report that both our teams did extremely well at this event, especially considering the teams included players from both our Junior and Intermediate age groups competing against older players. Our Girls team made the semifinals, losing to eventual champions Box Hill Secondary College. In the play off for the Bronze medal fatigue eventually got the better of the group and we went down to Henly High School from South Australia.\n\nThe Senior boys, however, came away National Champions! In a tough contest against Barker College from NSW the team fought back from 6 points down with 3 minutes to go to come away with the win.\n\nBoth our teams represented the values of Templestowe College and were rewarded for the hard work some of them have put in for six years in the basketball program – we were very proud of how they played and how they represented our school.\n\nSovereign Hill Excursion\n\nStudents studied history during the Gold Rush period and did research about the history behind different locations at Sovereign Hill. They also went on a tour to the underground mining shaft, observed the process of candy making and watched a play which reflected the controversy behind the Anti-Chinese League. This excursion was a great opportunity for students to gain authentic experience about an important period in the Australian history. Here are some student reflections:\n\nHasan:\n\nWe watched the fantastic show [in the theatre]. This is about what really happened to a Chinese man when a gold digger was exploited. After watching the show, we went to the museum. There are many works are made of golds\n\nSoon, our excursion will come to an end. I learned a lot in this historic town that makes me unforgettable. I love here very much.\n\nTo sum up this excursion, it not only allowed me to experience the lives of people a hundred years ago, but also learned a lot about Australian history and some engineering steps. The atmosphere here is friendly, the environment is beautiful, and the houses are arranged in a very orderly manner. Witness the life scenes from hundreds of years ago to the present. This is so wonderful\n\nArad:\n\nFrom the first moment we walked into Sovereign Hill, I loved the it, there were so many new things that I haven’t seen before. The people were so friendly and helpful, they had costumes that were interesting. I experienced lots of new things and I’m grateful for that. As I told you I had never seen a place like Sovereign Hill, so I was in shock when I saw the buildings and the mining places.\n\nJC:\n\nIt's just a wonderful experience where we can pan for gold ourselves and we were very lucky to find gold!\n\nAllen:\n\nLast Friday, language centre organised [for] us to travel to Sovereign Hill. We got there to learned some history about the Gold Rush. We got there by bus and when we got there it was about 10:00. First thing we went to a pit. It was dark and wet. It was exiting and interesting. Then we Experienced the gold rush. It was tired. It tells the story of a foreigner who refused to allow Chinese people to come to Sovereign Hill and was eventually arrested by the police. Then we had free time for 1 hour.\n\nI went to a coffee shop with some classmates. Then we saw the confectioner making the candy... Then we saw the alchemist to make the gold. It is very interesting. Then we went back at 15:30. I think it was very interesting to travel to Sovereign Hill. I learned something interesting I didn’t know before.\n\nQueen Victoria Market and the Myer Christmas Windows\n\nOn December 7th, the teachers took us to visit the center of Melbourne. At 9:30 we left our school. Frist, we came to Queen Victoria Market. There are many kinds of products there. We took a walk. We took a photo with the Christmas tree at the door. The Christmas tree was very big. After disbanding, I bought milk tea with my friends. We visited the Asian supermarket where I bought two packages of noodles. We also visited Queen Victoria Market and bought a kangaroo wallet. In the afternoon, we went to the Myer Christmas window with the teacher. There were many flags. In lunch time, we also went to Melbourne Central. I didn't eat food, because I was not hungry. My friend Lexy ate sushi. We also saw protesters on the road. At last, we went to Flinders Street Station. We took a group picture. At 14:15 we got on the bus back to school.\n\nBy Jolene Wu\n\nLast week, we went to the city with my classmate. The first stop, we went to the Queen Victoria market. There were so many interesting things there and there were lot of shiny stones there that I think are beautiful. The second stop we went to was the Melbourne Center. It's a luxury mall and one of my favourite shops is the sports shop. There were a lot of football booths. It made me so excited and happy and also we had lunch in there. I had a beef noodles. It was a Chinese food because I miss Chinese food so much. I feel like I almost forgot what Chinese food tasted like now. Then we went to the Myer Christmas window after that we saw a lot of kids with their families to visit the Christmas window. There were many cartoon dogs inside the windows and I think the dog's name is bluey. It was cute so that was why so many parents were willing to bring their kids here. Then we went to the Flinders Street station. I think this place is a very famous site. We took a lot of pictures there. At last, we got on the bus to go back to school. For this event, I felt very happy because this was my first come to go to city. I liked it.\n\nBy JC Mai\n\nMITTAGUNDI Experience\n\nIn term 4 this year all MAP students went on one of two Outdoor Education camps – Mittagundi or Wollangarra. I had the chance to spend a week at “Mitta” – one which I’ll remember for a long, long time!\n\nMittagundi was a fascinating time and experience, personally I wasn’t overly fond of the 7- or 8-hour drive (it’s located near Falls Creek on very windy roads!), but in the end, it was sincerely worth it. The staff were some of the nicest people I’ve ever met, and absolutely made the camp 100% better. We sat around fires and us young people ate and chewed on what felt like a 5-course meal. We had good friends, bad laughs and special memories I will cherish forever. I certainly got some good hours of slumber, even proving how good the staff took care of us, they made sure we had warmth and a lot of it. I got the best 4 nights of sleep somehow - even in a room with 14 smelly boys.\n\nThe activities that fulfilled my 5 days were spectacular and excellent for myself and friends and I’m sure everyone. We did gardening, cooking, fencing, wood collecting/creating coal and my personal favorite: wood splitting. Gardening was my third favorite, because I got to remove weeds, and plant beautiful veggies that looked stunning! I cannot express how cool it was. Cooking was also awesome because I got to make beautiful food for everyone to enjoy and besides the actual cooking just chatting with friends in the gorgeous kitchen was super fun, fencing was pretty fun because you got to help create easier areas to help Mittagundi with its animals and veggies and knowing that gave me the best fencing time ever. Then there was wood collecting, it was so amazing for so many reasons, using your muscles to move huge logs on the Trailor, riding in the VERY bumpy ride around the camp, spotting cool animals, and many more, it was in my opinion my 2nd favorite thing to do at Mittagundi. However, the coolest most fun job was definitely wood splitting! It started by playing “beehive” Jenga (the wood was stacked in piles called “beehives” to dry before being split) and moving that wood into a shed to dry further. But then you have to pull out the axes and swing away at the wood.\n\nTo wrap it up my highlight and best memory was when me and 5 other MAP young people try all our might to split and even a staff member. But I got the log to split and, oh boy did it feel good, and as I tried my best at splitting the wood, 2 Kookaburras laughed their little heads of at me failing to split the one “impossible log”.\n\nThat was my journey to Mittagundi, it was a time I certainly won’t forget and it was definitely my favorite MAP camp so far.\n\nBy Will Staggard-Gibson\n\nWhat an absolutely amazing year 2023 has been!! Once again, there is too much to capture in a short article like this. I could try and sum up all the successes and achievements that have occurred this year, but to find out what has really happened, keep scrolling the newsletter. What I can say for sure is that TC is a place and home for everyone. You may think you have some unique interests that nobody will be interested in, but I’m sure if you ask enough people, you will find YOUR people. Warhammer club, Bee club, History club…. the list goes on and on. If you don’t believe me, just ask all three members of the Taylor Swift club (just kidding…there are two members).\n\nTo our Entry and FLE students, as you progress into your next stage of learning, I would like for you to take the time to sit and reflect on the year. Think about your highlights, think about the low points and think about how you have grown. Think about what worked well for you and what you need to change to gain further success. Set some goals for yourself to become the best version of yourself.\n\nI would like to send a massive shoutout to our graduate students. Regardless of which pathway you have chosen to get there, the heights you will achieve as you continue down the road toward your destination is the exciting part. We wish you the best of luck and safe travels on your journey into your next phase of life and learning.\n\nAnother round of celebrations must go to our amazing student community leaders this year, William Genat, Sky Crawford and Tanya Fekonja. You have successfully led the community by driving student participation in whole school events, organising assemblies and lending a hand to run a range of different lunchtime community events. Stay posted in the new year for the 2024 student community leaders.\n\nTo the red community staff, I would like to thank you for continuing to inspire and support the students in our community. The activities and connection I see when walking through our connect spaces demonstrates your deep care and compassion for our young people.\n\nAs we switch gear to 2024, I would like to send a heartfelt thankyou to James Paraskeva and Fiona Wightman for all your support and efforts throughout this year as community leaders. Your tireless efforts to support our students, families and community are nothing short of incredible. Speaking of incredible, I would like to send a shoutout to Rebekah Burrell. Your continued efforts as the red community office assistant do not go unnoticed and we certainly couldn’t support the students the way we do without your help. In the Red CET team with me next year is Jessie Ravenscroft. I would like to pre-emptively thank you for all the efforts you are going to be putting in. I know the new entry students had a blast with you on orientation day and I look forward to working with you to continue to build our community.\n\nAs all good things, this year must end. Now is the time to wind down, relax and rebuild in preparation for another massive year in 2024. I wish you all a fantastic holiday and break when you get there.\n\nSteven Knight\n\nRed Community Director\n\nVISIONS - 2023 Art show\n\nNovember marked the grand opening of the Templestowe College annual Visions Art and Design Exhibition. This inspiring event showcased the exceptional work of students across various Electives, including Art, Visual Communication Design, Media, Photography, Design Technology, and Jewellery Making.\n\nThe exhibition not only celebrated the diverse talents of students at all levels but also served as a crucial platform for highlighting the impressive achievements of VCE students in Creative Practice, Visual Communication Design, Media, and Design Technology. The displayed talent was nothing short of amazing, leaving all in immensely proud of our incredible students.\n\nThis year's exhibition featured a rich variety of artistic methods, ranging from drawing, painting, printmaking, ceramics and 3D sculptures to cutting-edge digital techniques. Art Elective students incorporated recycled books into 3D sculptures demonstrated a notable emphasis on sustainability.\n\nThe opening event was a vibrant affair, with Finn De Blacquiere-Clarkson enchanting the audience on the piano, and Café Baking students tantalizing taste buds with a array of sweet treats. Permaculture students added a touch of natural beauty to the event with stunning floral arrangements.\n\nAwards were bestowed upon students from each level and subject, recognizing their dedication and exceptional work throughout the year.\n\nEx-student Miah Goia delivered the opening speech, inspiring students as she reflected how her time at TC has supported her to undertake a range of diverse and challenging experiences since graduating.\n\nA heartfelt thank you goes out to all the Visual Arts, Technologies, and Performing Arts staff and students whose dedication contributed to the resounding success of 2023 and made the Visions opening a truly fantastic celebration. Here's to the continued flourishing of creativity and talent at Templestowe College!\n\nDiorama Dreams: Exploring the Creative Canvas of our Community Art Competition!\n\nNestled within the walls of TC, a hidden world of creativity thrives, waiting to be unveiled. As you walk through the corridors, you'll find more than just classrooms and lockers: you'll encounter a living gallery of imagination and collaboration, and the Community Art Competition is only one example of that.\n\nOver the past five years, TC has celebrated students’ unique identities and interests through art in our Annual Community Art Competition!\n\nThe competition encouraged students to make a diorama representing their identity and who they are as individuals and to collaborate with their community. It was aimed to help bring students together with their connect class and to; “Express their unique personalities.’, Says Duncan.\n\nStudents were allowed to use any materials they wanted, including paint, clay, paper, and even natural items like leaves and flowers. Some students chose to focus on hobbies, like sport, and other chose to include their friends and family. The finished products are truly amazing! You can check them out in the Art Hub!\n\nUnfortunately, due to the many lockdowns and hardships of the pandemic, the Community art competition couldn’t run for a few years and TC began to lack a sense of community, but now it’s back and bigger than ever! TC aspires to make the future Community Art Competition full of fun activities and to become a part of Connect in the sense that people will be able to learn about art and how it brings people together. Although the competition isn’t as popular as it was a few years ago with up 70 participants. In a hope to receive more participants like we had in previous years, we strongly encourage you to get involved and make some art! Keep on expressing your interests, feelings, and culture through art and to keep inspiring your peers with your imaginative ideas.\n\nLike most Competitions, only one community can win the glittering golden trophy. Because the number of entries were fairly low this year, the successful community will be the one that had the most participation’. Duncan explains.\n\nSo keep an eye out on your team’s page to see if Green, Gold, Red or Blue has won!\n\nThe Competition was a wonderful experience for everyone involved. It encouraged students to think outside the box (literally), express themselves freely, and create something truly beautiful.\n\nKeep creating and stay inspired! Until next time!\n\nBy Mietta Palmer\n\nTC Journalist"
