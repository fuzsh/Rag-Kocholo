My thesis is that the expert evaluator—the ‘black belt’ in the field—is characterised by taking a broad view that sees patterns where others see points; by delving deep for root causes where others see surface explanations; and by emphasising worth and value. This paper is a thought piece and a reflection—its aim is to stimulate debate and discussion rather than to offer definitive conclusions. The intent of this paper is to explore what it is that makes a ‘black belt’ evaluator; that is, someone who is a recognised expert in the area with demonstrated mastery. The thesis of the paper is that expertise/mastery in evaluation involves more that just the superior acquisition of the same set of skills, attributes or competencies that define ‘an evaluator’; rather expertise/mastery involves an additional set of qualities. These additional qualities are taking the macro perspective and a focus on value for the client. The structure of this paper is as follows. After discussing why I think it matters to consider ‘black belt’ evaluators, and what ‘black belt’ means, I describe the work in Australia and New Zealand on evaluator competencies, Next, I consider from a theoretical perspective the nature of competence and expertise before considering how competence models fit within an expert–novice framework. I then draw on the literature on expert–novice differences to hypothesise areas in which expert and novice evaluators might differ.\n\nDrachewych, Oleksa. \"Broadening the Native Republic Thesis: De-siloing Comintern histories.\" Twentieth Century Communism 24, no. 24 (June 28, 2023): 110–31. http://dx.doi.org/10.3898/175864323837280526.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAfter the Sixth Comintern Congress in 1928, the Native Republic Thesis, or Black-Belt Thesis, became a noted platform for the Communist Parties of South Africa and the United States. The platform called for self-determination for Black Africans and Black Americans respectively. Historians have often reframed this platform as a call for selfdetermination on racial lines, and the thesis has become a prominent part of histories of these communist parties. Taking a comparative and transnational approach, this article argues that the Native Republic Thesis and its key tenets (including calls for a workers' and peasants' republic or for a nation within a nation) may have extended beyond the issue of racial selfdetermination. These tenets can be found, with some variation, in similar contemporaneous communist platforms in Latin America, Australia, Belgium and the Balkans. In the process of developing this argument, this article highlights the benefits of taking a fresh look at Comintern platforms from a transnational and comparative perspective; here this approach has suggested new questions about communist or Soviet perspectives on self-determination and nationhood, and about Comintern leadership.\n\nDelica, Kristian. \"Sociologisk refleksivitet og feltanalytisk anvendelse af etnografi – om Loïc Wacquants blik på urban marginalisering.\" Dansk Sociologi 22, no. 1 (March 29, 2011): 27–45. http://dx.doi.org/10.22439/dansoc.v22i1.3474.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nArtiklen fremstiller og diskuterer Loïc Wacquants tese om avanceret marginalisering som samlebetegnelse for og særtræk ved kontemporære vestlige storbyer. Den viser, hvordan Wacquant praktiserer Pierre Bourdieus sociologiske refleksivitet (den epistemiske refleksivitet) med udgangspunkt i historisk funderede studier af udviklingen af henholdsvis den amerikanske ghettos (the black belt) og de parisiske forstæder (the red belt). Der argumenteres for det første for, at Wacquants bidrag til bysociologien netop kan ses som en videreførelse af principperne i Bourdieus refleksive sociologi. For det andet argumenteres for, at Wacquant anvender en særlig bourdieuinspireret, feltanalytisk udgave af etnografi. Dette foreslås både som præcisering af den måde Wacquant arbejder med etnografiske metoder på i studier af avanceret marginalisering og som del af et bredere urbansociologisk forskningsprogram, der ligeledes skitseres. Denne distinkte udgave af etnografisk arbejde diskuteres op mod andre positioner i det etnografiske felt, hvorved Wacquants bidrag hertil skrives frem. ENGELSK ABSTRACT: Kristian Delica: Sociological Reflexivity and a Field Analytical Practice of Ethnography – Loïc Wacquant’s Perspective on Urban Marginality This article discusses Loïc Wacquant’s thesis of advanced marginality, and shows how it contains both a general description of contemporary Western cities and crucial characteristics of these. Wacquant deploys Pierre Bourdieu’s sociological reflexivity – the so called epistemic reflexivity – in studying how the American ghetto (the black belt) and the French banliues (the red belt) developed historically. The article argues that Wacquant’s contributions to urban sociology can be seen as a continuation of the principles of Bourdieu’s reflexive sociology, and suggests that Wacquant deploys a field analytical usage of ethnography. This is analyzed as both an elucidation of the way Wacquant is working with ethnographic methods in studies of advanced marginalization, and as part of a broader urban sociological research program. Wacquant’s distinctive version of ethnographic work is contextualized in a discussion of other positions in the ethnographic field.\n\nTomek, Beverly. \"The Communist International and the Dilemma of the American “Negro Problem”: Limitations of the Black Belt Self-Determination Thesis.\" WorkingUSA 15, no. 4 (December 2012): 549–76. http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wusa.12004.\n\nFull text\n\nArtwich, Anna. \"Różne marginesy.\" Przestrzenie Teorii, no. 39 (January 5, 2024): 287–97. http://dx.doi.org/10.14746/pt.2023.39.14.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe article contains a review of bell hooks’ Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center (1984; Wydawnictwo Krytyki Politycznej, Warszawa 2013, second edition 2022). The text by the American scholar presents groundbreaking theses for the development of the Black feminism movement – she was one of the first to draw attention to the need to take into account various social determinants of violence against women. At the same time, it emphasizes the exclusionary and marginalizing assumptions of second-wave feminism that dominated in the mid-twentieth century. In my review, I reflect on the importance of republishing a theoretical book that examines the systemic violence faced by Black women in a patriarchal and white society. For me, it is important to ask about the relevance of hooks’ reflections and the role they play in thinking about feminism in contemporary capitalist society. I also reflect on the applicability of hooks’ theory in Polish feminism context.\n\nTapsfield, Amy. \"Zagaku.\" Journal of Extreme Anthropology 6, no. 2 (October 31, 2022): E1—E33. http://dx.doi.org/10.5617/jea.9459.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe majority of this article consists of an unadulterated piece of auto-ethnographic writing depicting a key experience from my anthropological fieldwork. For my PhD research on Japanese policing, I spent two years living in Tokyo and training at the Yoshinkan Aikido Honbu Dojo together with groups of Japanese police officers. This particular dojo has a program called the Senshusei course where Tokyo police officers take part in a nine-month full-time training period that will bring them up to first class black belt instructor level. Alongside the aikido training, the senshusei have other duties such as being responsible for cleaning the entire building, maintaining a training diary, writing weekly essays, and helping at dojo functions. This course removes them from their policing duties for the duration of the training, yet they remain on salary. The Japanese police are encouraged to train in either aikido, judo, or kendo, as well as required firearm practice, as a part of their job. The senshusei course enrols a maximum of ten officers each year, and is just one of many training options available to them for their professional development. From interviews conducted I discovered that, despite being known amongst the Tokyo police for the intensity of the training, completion of senshusei does not necessarily bestow greater importance, respect, or professional status onto those who do it, and most of the officers I trained with signed up simply due to a personal interest in martial arts. A couple of the police told me that judo and kendo have a larger following, so there is apparently less competition if you choose aikido. After completing the course, they are expected to act as instructors to the other officers in their area units (though this is largely dependent on whether anyone is interested). Alongside this, there is a course that civilians can enrol in, of slightly longer duration (eleven months), that trains together with the police and shares all the same duties, usually containing mostly non-Japanese nationals and is therefore known as the International Senshusei or Kokusai Senshusei course. This course has been running since 1990 and was set up due to popular demand from non-Japanese aikido practitioners, many of whom had already been travelling to Japan in order to train for some years. This course is what I undertook and completed in 2017-18. This piece of writing is a first-hand description of one of the aspects of that training, called zagaku: meaning ‘seated learning,’ once a week all senshusei had to spend one full 90-minute training session in seiza, the traditional kneeling position. This practice was derived from the era when Shioda Gozo-sensei (the founder of Yoshinkan Aikido) was still alive and leading the dojo in the late 1990s; it was for all the senseis to attend and reflect on their progress and techniques. This session would usually last around 45mins, during which time everyone had to pay attention to the discussion despite the pain they were in, as Shioda-sensei could call on anyone to contribute at any time. This was a method of training the mind as well as the body, to be able to maintain concentration whilst in significant pain and stress, similar to the meditative practice of zazen performed by Buddhist monks. Ueda-sensei, who had attended these sessions when a young man and was head of the dojo whilst I was there, had been greatly influenced by this practice and decided to implement it for the senshusei course. This decision appeared to be something of a whim, as he had only begun using the practice three years earlier, despite having been in charge of the course for a lot longer (the next year, when a different sensei took over management of the police training, the practice of zagaku was dropped). This experience was incredibly painful and hated by both the police and the international senshusei, yet we all submitted ourselves to its torture at the same time every week. Describing this training to Japanese friends outside of the dojo, they would look at me with horrified disbelief just thinking about how painful it would be, and that was the point; the pain and discomfort were a crucial element of zagaku. Even the senseis felt it despite their decades of practice. This auto-ethnographic piece will form the opening chapter of my PhD thesis, from which starting point I will go on to examine the key themes of pain, discipline, consent, embodied experience, auto-ethnography, methods of learning, behaviours of respect, non-violence, power, and social responsibility within the context of Japan. However, I have made the decision to leave theory out of this article, as the main purpose is for the reader to be given an uninterrupted, embodied taste of the experience as it was lived. There are many academics from various disciplines writing about the theory of pain, but it remains an elusive experience that is rarely described for its own sake. The medical profession still struggles to create methods that patients can use to accurately communicate the intensity and form of their pain, as language is decidedly lacking for such things, so I wanted to use this longer piece as an attempt to communicate what usually remains incommunicable. The anthropology of martial arts is acquiring a strong collection of ethnographies, but descriptions of the embodied experiential elements of training are often cut short to prioritise theoretical analysis. It is an area where the ethnographer often uses their own body as a source of data; training, learning, and getting injured becoming a crucial part of the research methodology. Watching from the side-lines would not have allowed me any insight into the experience of zagaku; the fact that I did experience it, as a researcher, has enabled me to write about it. In order to avoid interrupting my auto-ethnographic description with sections of theory and citations, I have included a further reading list at the end of this piece; a list of books and articles that explore key themes from my research, that readers might find relevant.\n\nAlAli, Musaed, Yaser AlKulaib, Ahmad Bash, Hamed AlDhuaina, Ibraheem AlAskar, and Nabi AlDuwaila. \"DIVIDEND POLICY EFFECT ON SHARE PRICES: A COMPARISON STUDY BETWEEN ISLAMIC AND CONVENTIONAL BANKS IN KUWAIT.\" International Journal of Professional Business Review 9, no. 5 (May 15, 2024): e04608. http://dx.doi.org/10.26668/businessreview/2024.v9i5.4608.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAhmad, A., & Hassan, M.

What attracted him to Tiger Bay for his next project was a scandal that erupted on both sides of the Atlantic around Britain's growing population of what were referred to as brown babies. These children were the product of sexual encounters that sometimes took place between local white women and some of the 200,000 African American GIs who were at different points stationed across the United Kingdom during the later part of the Second World War. Using the extensive field notes Drake kept during his sojourn in Cardiff, this article reconstructs the nature and feel of a neighborhood where, by the 1940s, half of all residents were from ethnic minority backgrounds. Drake's work serves as a window onto the nature of racism and ideas about race in late-imperial Britain, alongside the parallel presence of metropolitan community life in Tiger Bay, one of Britain's oldest multicultural communities.\n\nRoss, Dyann. \"bell hooks’s Legacy and Social Work: A Distillation of Her Key Ideas about Love and Some Implications for Social Work Practice.\" British Journal of Social Work, July 7, 2022. http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bcac127.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAbstract bell hooks is regarded as one of the most influential cultural critics, writers and speakers of the last fifty years. She has published more than forty books which collectively articulate a feminist critique of white supremacy, capitalism and patriarchy. At the same time, she offers a loving, non-violent and just vision for attaining collective and personal well-being. Hooks makes feminist theory meaningful as a guide not only for Black American women but also for anyone seeking to resist inequality and discrimination due to race, class and gender. Her main thesis is that where there is love there can be no oppression. hooks’s contribution is traced through some of the key themes of her books which explicitly refer to love to develop a rich understanding of love and its transformative power. These contributions are then considered for the relevance they have for social work. Social workers can practice love by fostering their own and others’: self-love; willingness to learn; and cultural responsiveness. Two loving practices with other people are dadirri (deep listening) and narrative resistance. Love provides the power to do the justice and healing work.\n\nHaupt, Adam. \"Queering Hip-Hop, Queering the City: Dope Saint Jude’s Transformative Politics.\" M/C Journal 19, no. 4 (August 31, 2016). http://dx.doi.org/10.5204/mcj.1125.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis paper argues that artist Dope Saint Jude is transforming South African hip-hop by queering a genre that has predominantly been male and heteronormative. Specifically, I analyse the opening skit of her music video “Keep in Touch” in order to unpack the ways which she revives Gayle, a gay language that adopted double-coded forms of speech during the apartheid era—a context in which homosexuals were criminalised. The use of Gayle and spaces close to the city centre of Cape Town (such as Salt River and Woodstock) speaks to the city as it was before it was transformed by the decline of industries due to the country’s adoption of neoliberal economics and, more recently, by the gentrification of these spaces. Dope Saint Jude therefore reclaims these city spaces through her use of gay modes of speech that have a long history in Cape Town and by positioning her work as hip-hop, which has been popular in the city for well over two decades. Her inclusion of transgender MC and DJ Angel Ho pushes the boundaries of hegemonic and binary conceptions of gender identity even further. In essence, Dope Saint Jude is transforming local hip-hop in a context that is shaped significantly by US cultural imperialism. The artist is also transforming our perspective of spaces that have been altered by neoliberal economics.Setting the SceneDope Saint Jude (DSJ) is a queer MC from Elsies River, a working class township located on Cape Town's Cape Flats in South Africa. Elsies River was defined as a “coloured” neighbourhood under the apartheid state's Group Areas Act, which segregated South Africans racially. With the aid of the Population Registration Act, citizens were classified, not merely along the lines of white, Asian, or black—black subjects were also divided into further categories. The apartheid state also distinguished between black and “coloured” subjects. Michael MacDonald contends that segregation “ordained blacks to be inferior to whites; apartheid cast them to be indelibly different” (11). Apartheid declared “African claims in South Africa to be inferior to white claims” and effectively claimed that black subjects “belonged elsewhere, in societies of their own, because their race was different” (ibid). The term “coloured” defined people as “mixed race” to separate communities that might otherwise have identified as black in the broad and inclusive sense (Erasmus 16). Racial categorisation was used to create a racial hierarchy with white subjects at the top of that hierarchy and those classified as black receiving the least resources and benefits. This frustrated attempts to establish broad alliances of black struggles against apartheid. It is in this sense that race is socially and politically constructed and continues to have currency, despite the fact that biologically essentialist understandings of race have been discredited (Yudell 13–14). Thanks to apartheid town planning and resource allocation, many townships on the Cape Flats were poverty-stricken and plagued by gang violence (Salo 363). This continues to be the case because post-apartheid South Africa's embrace of neoliberal economics failed to address racialised class inequalities significantly (Haupt, Static 6–8). This is the '90s context in which socially conscious hip-hop crews, such as Prophets of da City or Black Noise, came together. They drew inspiration from Black Consciousness philosophy via their exposure to US hip-hop crews such as Public Enemy in order to challenge apartheid policies, including their racial interpellation as “coloured” as distinct from the more inclusive category, black (Haupt, “Black Thing” 178). Prophets of da City—whose co-founding member, Shaheen Ariefdien, also lived in Elsies River—was the first South African hip-hop outfit to record an album. Whilst much of their work was performed in English, they quickly transformed the genre by rapping in non-standard varieties of Afrikaans and by including MCs who rap in African languages (ibid). They therefore succeeded in addressing key issues related to race, language, and class disparities in relation to South Africa's transition to democracy (Haupt, “Black Thing”; Haupt, Stealing Empire). However, as is the case with mainstream US hip-hop, specifically gangsta rap (Clay 149), South African hip-hop has been largely dominated by heterosexual men. This includes the more commercial hip-hop scene, which is largely perceived to be located in Johannesburg, where male MCs like AKA and Cassper Nyovest became celebrities. However, certain female MCs have claimed the genre, notably EJ von Lyrik and Burni Aman who are formerly of Godessa, the first female hip-hop crew to record and perform locally and internationally (Haupt, Stealing Empire 166; Haupt, “Can a Woman in Hip-Hop”). DSJ therefore presents the exception to a largely heteronormative and male-dominated South African music industry and hip-hop scene as she transforms it with her queer politics. While queer hip-hop is not new in the US (Pabón and Smalls), this is new territory for South Africa. Writing about the US MC Jean Grae in the context of a “male-dominated music industry and genre,” Shanté Paradigm Smalls contends,Heteronormativity blocks the materiality of the experiences of Black people. Yet, many Black people strive for a heteronormative effect if not “reality”. In hip hop, there is a particular emphasis on maintaining the rigidity of categories, even if those categories fail [sic]. (87) DSJ challenges these rigid categories. Keep in TouchDSJ's most visible entry onto the media landscape to date has been her appearance in an H&M recycling campaign with British Sri Lankan artist MIA (H&M), some fashion shoots, her new EP—Reimagine (Dope Saint Jude)—and recent Finnish, US and French tours as well as her YouTube channel, which features her music videos. As the characters’ theatrical costumes suggest, “Keep in Touch” is possibly the most camp and playful music video she has produced. It commences somewhat comically with Dope Saint Jude walking down Salt River main road to a public telephone, where she and a young woman in pig tails exchange dirty looks. Salt River is located at the foot of Devil's Peak not far from Cape Town's CBD. Many factories were located there, but the area is also surrounded by low-income housing, which was designated a “coloured” area under apartheid. After apartheid, neighbourhoods such as Salt River, Woodstock, and the Bo-Kaap became increasingly gentrified and, instead of becoming more inclusive, many parts of Cape Town continued to be influenced by policies that enable racialised inequalities. Dope Saint Jude calls Angel Ho: DSJ: Awêh, Angie! Yoh, you must check this kak sturvy girl here by the pay phone. [Turns to the girl, who walks away as she bursts a chewing gum bubble.] Ja, you better keep in touch. Anyway, listen here, what are you wys?Angel Ho: Ah, just at the salon getting my hair did. What's good? DSJ: Wanna catch on kak today?Angel Ho: Yes, honey. But, first, let me Gayle you this. By the jol by the art gallery, this Wendy, nuh. This Wendy tapped me on the shoulder and wys me, “This is a place of decorum.”DSJ: What did she wys?Angel Ho: De-corum. She basically told me this is not your house. DSJ: I know you told that girl to keep in touch!Angel Ho: Yes, Mama! I'm Paula, I told that bitch, “Keep in touch!” [Points index finger in the air.](Saint Jude, Dope, “Keep in Touch”)Angel Ho's name is a play on the male name Angelo and refers to the trope of the ho (whore) in gangsta rap lyrics and in music videos that present objectified women as secondary to male, heterosexual narratives (Sharpley-Whiting 23; Collins 27). The queering of Angelo, along with Angel Ho’s non-binary styling in terms of hair, make-up, and attire, appropriates a heterosexist, sexualised stereotype of women in order to create room for a gender identity that operates beyond heteronormative male-female binaries. Angel Ho’s location in a hair salon also speaks to stereotypical associations of salons with women and gay subjects. In a discussion of gender stereotypes about hair salons, Kristen Barber argues that beauty work has traditionally been “associated with women and with gay men” and that “the body beautiful has been tightly linked to the concept of femininity” (455–56). During the telephonic exchange, Angel Ho and Dope Saint Jude code-switch between standard and non-standard varieties of English and Afrikaans, as the opening appellation, “Awêh,” suggests. In this context, the term is a friendly greeting, which intimates solidarity. “Sturvy” means pretentious, whilst “kak” means shit, but here it is used to qualify “sturvy” and means that the girl at the pay phone is very pretentious or “full of airs.” To be “wys” means to be wise, but it can also mean that you are showing someone something or educating them. The meanings of these terms shift, depending on the context. The language practices in this skit are in line with the work of earlier hip-hop crews, such as Prophets of da City and Brasse vannie Kaap, to validate black, multilingual forms of speech and expression that challenge the linguistic imperialism of standard English and Afrikaans in South Africa, which has eleven official languages (Haupt, “Black Thing”; Haupt, Stealing Empire; Williams). Henry Louis Gates’s research on African American speech varieties and literary practices emerging from the repressive context of slavery is essential to understanding hip-hop’s language politics. Hip-hop artists' multilingual wordplay creates parallel discursive universes that operate both on the syntagmatic axis of meaning-making and the paradigmatic axis (Gates 49; Haupt, “Stealing Empire” 76–77). Historically, these discursive universes were those of the slave masters and the slaves, respectively. While white hegemonic meanings are produced on the syntagmatic axis (which is ordered and linear), black modes of speech as seen in hip-hop word play operate on the paradigmatic axis, which is connotative and non-linear (ibid). Distinguishing between Signifyin(g) / Signification (upper case, meaning black expression) and signification (lower case, meaning white dominant expression), he argues that “the signifier ‘Signification’ has remained identical in spelling to its white counterpart to demonstrate [. . .] that a simultaneous, but negated, parallel discursive (ontological, political) universe exists within the larger white discursive universe” (Gates 49). The meanings of terms and expressions can change, depending on the context and manner in which they are used. It is therefore the shared experiences of speech communities (such as slavery or racist/sexist oppression) that determine the negotiated meanings of certain forms of expression. Gayle as a Parallel Discursive UniverseDSJ and Angel Ho's performance of Gayle takes these linguistic practices further. Viewers are offered points of entry into Gayle via the music video’s subtitles. We learn that Wendy is code for a white person and that to keep in touch means exactly the opposite. Saint Jude explains that Gayle is a very fun queer language that was used to kind of mask what people were saying [. . .] It hides meanings and it makes use of women's names [. . . .] But the thing about Gayle is it's constantly changing [. . .] So everywhere you go, you kind of have to pick it up according to the context that you're in. (Ovens, Saint Jude and Haupt)According to Kathryn Luyt, “Gayle originated as Moffietaal [gay language] in the coloured gay drag culture of the Western Cape as a form of slang amongst Afrikaans-speakers which over time, grew into a stylect used by gay English and Afrikaans-speakers across South Africa” (Luyt 8; Cage 4). Given that the apartheid state criminalised homosexuals, Gayle was coded to evade detection and to seek out other members of this speech community (Luyt 8). Luyt qualifies the term “language” by arguing, “The term ‘language’ here, is used not as a constructed language with its own grammar, syntax, morphology and phonology, but in the same way as linguists would discuss women’s language, as a way of speaking, a kind of sociolect” (Luyt 8; Cage 1). However, the double-coded nature of Gayle allows one to think of it as creating a parallel discursive universe as Gates describes it (49). Whereas African American and Cape Flats discursive practices function parallel to white, hegemonic discourses, gay modes of speech run parallel to heteronormative communication. Exclusion and MicroaggressionsThe skit brings both discursive practices into play by creating room for one to consider that DSJ queers a male-dominated genre that is shaped by US cultural imperialism (Haupt, Stealing Empire 166) as a way of speaking back to intersectional forms of marginalisation (Crenshaw 1244), which are created by “white supremacist capitalist patriarchy” (hooks 116). This is significant in South Africa where “curative rape” of lesbians and other forms of homophobic violence are prominent (cf. Gqola; Hames; Msibi). Angel Ho's anecdote conveys a sense of the extent to which black individuals are subject to scrutiny. Ho's interpretation of the claim that the gallery “is a place of decorum” is correct: it is not Ho's house. Black queer subjects are not meant to feel at home or feel a sense of ownership. This functions as a racial microaggression: “subtle insults (verbal, nonverbal, and/or visual) directed toward people of color, often automatically or unconsciously” (Solorzano, Ceja, and Yosso 60). This speaks to DSJ's use of Salt River, Woodstock, and Bo-Kaap for the music video, which features black queer bodies in performance—all of these spaces are being gentrified, effectively pushing working class people of colour out of the city (cf. Didier, Morange, and Peyroux; Lemanski). Gustav Visser explains that gentrification has come to mean a unit-by-unit acquisition of housing which replaces low-income residents with high-income residents, and which occurs independent of the structural condition, architecture, tenure or original cost level of the housing (although it is usually renovated for or by the new occupiers). (81–82) In South Africa this inequity plays out along racial lines because its neoliberal economic policies created a small black elite without improving the lives of the black working class. Instead, the “new African bourgeoisie, because it shares racial identities with the bulk of the poor and class interests with white economic elites, is in position to mediate the reinforcing cleavages between rich whites and poor blacks without having to make more radical changes” (MacDonald 158). In a news article about a working class Salt River family of colour’s battle against an eviction, Christine Hogg explains, “Gentrification often means the poor are displaced as the rich move in or buildings are upgraded by new businesses. In Woodstock and Salt River both are happening at a pace.” Angel Ho’s anecdote, as told from a Woodstock hair salon, conveys a sense of what Woodstock’s transformation from a coloured, working class Group Area to an upmarket, trendy, and arty space would mean for people of colour, including black, queer subjects. One could argue that this reading of the video is undermined by DSJ’s work with global brand H&M. Was she was snared by neoliberal economics? Perhaps, but one response is that the seeds of any subculture’s commercial co-option lie in the fact it speaks through commodities (for example clothing, make-up, CDs, vinyl, or iTunes / mp3 downloads (Hebdige 95; Haupt, Stealing Empire 144–45). Subcultures have a window period in which to challenge hegemonic ideologies before they are delegitimated or commercially co-opted. Hardt and Negri contend that the means that extend the reach of corporate globalisation could be used to challenge it from within it (44–46; Haupt, Stealing Empire 26). DSJ utilises her H&M work, social media, the hip-hop genre, and international networks to exploit that window period to help mainstream black queer identity politics.ConclusionDSJ speaks back to processes of exclusion from the city, which was transformed by apartheid and, more recently, gentrification, by claiming it as a creative and playful space for queer subjects of colour. She uses Gayle to lay claim to the city as it has a long history in Cape Town. In fact, she says that she is not reviving Gayle, but is simply “putting it on a bigger platform” (Ovens, Saint Jude, and Haupt). The use of subtitles in the video suggests that she wants to mainstream queer identity politics. Saint Jude also transforms hip-hop heteronormativity by queering the genre and by locating her work within the history of Cape hip-hop’s multilingual wordplay.

Grace, \"doing so is difficult: the romance of the Beat life threatens to subsume the project\" (812). Of course, the Beat life is romantic to the extent that it is romantically regaled. Continual romantic portrayals, such as that of Ginsberg in the recent movie Howl (2010), rekindle the Beat romance for new audiences with chicken-and-egg circularity. I explore this difficulty of reading Ginsberg that Grace and other critics identify by articulating it with respect to \"Kaddish\"—\"Ginsberg's most highly praised and his least typical poem\" (Perloff 213)—as a difficulty of interpreting Ginsberg suspiciously. Philosopher Paul Ricoeur's theories of interpretation—or \"hermeneutics\"—provide the theoretical foundation here. Ricoeur distinguishes between a romantic or \"restorative\" mode of interpretation, where meaning is reverently reconciled to a text assumed to be trustworthy, and a \"suspicious\" approach, where meaning is aggressively extrapolated from a text held as unreliable. In order to bring these theories to bear on \"Kaddish\" and its criticism, I draw on Rita Felski's pioneering work in relating Ricoeur's concept of \"suspicious reading\" to the field of literature. Is it possible to read \"Kaddish\" suspiciously? Or is there nothing left for suspicious readers to expose in texts such as \"Kaddish\" that are already self-exposing? In \"Kaddish,\" Ginsberg tells the story of his mother Naomi Ginsberg, a Russian Jewish immigrant, who died in a mental hospital in 1956. It is a lengthy prose poem and spans a remarkable 19 pages in Ginsberg's Collected Poems (1984). In the words of Maeera Y. Shreiber, \"Kaddish\" \"is a massive achievement, comprised of five numbered parts, and an interpellated 'Hymmnn' between parts two and three\" (84). I focus on the second narrative part, which forms the bulk of the poem, where the speaker—I shall refer to him henceforth as \"Allen\" in order to differentiate between Ginsberg's poetic self-representation and Ginsberg-the-author—recounts the nervous breakdowns and hospital movements of his mother, whom he calls by her first name, Naomi. I begin by illustrating the ways in which Allen focalises Naomi in the text, and suggest that his attempts to \"read\" her suspicious mind alternate between restorative and suspicious impulses. I then take up the issue of reading \"Kaddish\" suspiciously. Acknowledging Ricoeur's assertion that psychoanalysis is an unequivocal \"school of suspicion\" (32), I consider James Breslin's psychoanalytic criticism on \"Kaddish,\" in particular, his reading of what is easily the most contentious passage in the poem: the scene where Naomi solicits Allen for sex. I regard this passage as a microcosm of the issues that beset a suspicious reading of \"Kaddish\"—such as the problem posed by the self-exposing poem and poet—and I find that Breslin's response to it raises interesting questions on the politics of psychoanalysis and the nature of suspicious interpretation. Finally, I identify an unpublished thesis on Ginsberg's poetry by Sarah Macfarlane and classify her interpretation of \"Kaddish\" as unambiguously suspicious. My purpose is not to advance my own suspicious reading of \"Kaddish\" but to highlight the difficulties of reading \"Kaddish\" suspiciously. I argue that while it is difficult to read \"Kaddish\" suspiciously, to do so offers a fruitful counterbalance to the dominant restorative criticism on the poem. There are as yet unexplored hermeneutical territories in and around this poem, indeed in and around Ginsberg's work in general, which have radical implications for the future direction of Beat studies. Picking her tooth with her nail, lips formed an O, suspicion—thought's old worn vagina— (Ginsberg, \"Kaddish\" 218)Ginsberg constructs Naomi's suspicion in \"Kaddish\" via Allen's communication of her visions and descriptions of her behaviour. Allen relates, for example, that Naomi once suspected that Hitler was \"in her room\" and that \"she saw his mustache in the sink\" (\"Kaddish\" 220). Subsequently, Allen depicts Naomi \"listening to the radio for spies—or searching the windowsill,\" and, in an attempt to \"read\" her suspicious mind, suggests that she envisages \"an old man creep[ing] with his bag stuffing packages of garbage in his hanging black overcoat\" (\"Kaddish\" 220). Allen's gaze thus filters Naomi's; he watches her as she watches for spies, and he animates her visions. He recalls as a child \"watching over\" Naomi in order to anticipate her \"next move\" (\"Kaddish\" 212). On one fateful day, Naomi \"stared out the window on the Broadway Church corner\"; Allen interprets that she \"spied a mystical assassin from Newark\" (\"Kaddish\" 212). He likewise observes and interprets Naomi's body language and facial expressions. When she \"covered [her] nose with [a] motheaten fur collar\" and \"shuddered at [the] face\" of a bus driver, he deduces that, for Naomi, the collar must have been a \"gas mask against poison\" and the driver \"a member of the gang\" (\"Kaddish\" 212). On the one hand, Allen's impetus to recover \"the lost Naomi\" (\"Kaddish\" 216)—first lost to mental illness and then to death—may be likened to Ricoeur's concept of a restorative hermeneutic, \"which is driven by a sense of reverence and goes deeper into the text in search of revelation\" (Felski 216). As if Naomi's mind constitutes a text, Allen strives to reveal it in order to make it intelligible. What drives him is the cathartic impulse to revivify his mother's memory, to rebuild her story, and to exalt her as \"magnificent\" and \"mourned no more\" (\"Kaddish\" 212), so that he may mourn no more. Like a restorative reader \"driven by a sense of reverence\" (Felski 216), he lauds Naomi as the \"glorious muse that bore [him] from the womb [...] from whose pained head [he] first took Vision\" (\"Kaddish\" 223). Critics of \"Kaddish\" also observe the poem's restorative impulse. In \"Strange Prophecies Anew,\" Tony Trigilio reads the recovery of Naomi as \"the recovery of a female principle of divinity\" (773). Diverging from Ginsberg's earlier poem \"Howl\" (1956), which \"represses signs of women in order to forge male prophetic comradeship,\" \"Kaddish\" \"constructs maternity as a source of vision, an influence that precedes and sustains prophetic language. In 'Kaddish', Ginsberg attempts to recover the voice of his mother Naomi, which is muted in 'Howl'\" (776). Shreiber also acknowledges Ginsberg's redemption of \"the feminine, figured specifically as the lost mother,\" but for her it \"is central to both of the long poems that make his reputation,\" namely \"Kaddish\" and \"Howl\" (81). She cites Ginsberg's retrospective confession that \"Howl\" was actually about Naomi to argue that, \"it is in the course of writing 'Howl' that Ginsberg discovers his obligation to the elided (Jewish) mother—whose restoration is the central project of 'Kaddish'\" (81). On the other hand, Allen's compulsion to \"cut through\" to Naomi, to talk to her as he \"didn't when [she] had a mouth\" (\"Kaddish\" 211), suggests the brutality of a suspicious hermeneutic where meanings \"must be wrestled rather than gleaned from the page, derived not from what the text says, but in spite of what it says\" (Felski 223). When Naomi was alive and \"had a mouth,\" Allen aggressively \"pushed her against the door and shouted 'DON'T KICK ELANOR!'\" in spite of her message: \"Elanor is the worst spy! She's taking orders!\" (\"Kaddish\" 221). As a suspicious reader wrestles with a resistant text, Allen wrestles with Naomi, \"yelling at her\" in exasperation, and even \"banging against her head which saw Radios, Sticks, Hitlers—the whole gamut of Hallucinations—for real—her own universe\" (\"Kaddish\" 221).Allen may be also seen as approaching Naomi with a suspicious reader's \"adversarial sensibility to probe for concealed, repressed, or disavowed meanings\" (Felski 216). This is most visible in his facetiously professed \"good idea to try [to] know the Monster of the Beginning Womb\"—to penetrate Naomi's body in order to access her mind \"that way\" (\"Kaddish\" 219). Accordingly, in his psychoanalytic reading of \"Kaddish,\" James Breslin understands Allen's \"incestuous desires as expressing [his] wish to get inside his mother and see things as she does\" (424). Breslin's interpretation invokes the Freudian concept of \"epistemophilia,\" which Bran Nicol defines as the \"desire to know\" (48).Freud is one of \"three masters\" of suspicion according to Ricoeur (32). Freud, Nietzsche, and Marx \"present the most radically contrary stance to the phenomenology of the sacred and to any hermeneutics understood as the recollection of meaning\" (Ricoeur 35). They \"begin with suspicion concerning the illusions of consciousness, and then proceed to employ the stratagem of deciphering\" (Ricoeur 34). Freud deciphers the language of the conscious mind in order to access the \"unconscious\"—that \"part of the mind beyond consciousness which nevertheless has a strong influence upon our actions\" (Barry 96). Like their therapeutic counterparts, psychoanalytic critics distinguish \"between the conscious and the unconscious mind,\" associating a text's \"'overt' content with the former\" and \"'covert' content with the latter, privileging the latter as being what the work is 'really' about\" (Barry 105). In seeking to expose a text's unconscious, they subscribe to a hermeneutic of suspicion's \"conviction that appearances are deceptive, that texts do not gracefully relinquish their meanings\" (Felski 216). To force texts to relinquish their meanings suspicious readers bear \"distance rather than closeness; guardedness rather than openness; aggression rather than submission; superiority rather than reverence; attentiveness rather than distraction; exposure rather than tact\" (Felski 222).For the most part, these qualities fail to characterise Breslin's psychoanalytic criticism on \"Kaddish\" and \"Howl.\" Far from aggressive or superior, Breslin is a highly sympathetic reader of Ginsberg. \"Many readers,\" he complains, are \"still not sympathetic to the kind [sic] of form found in these poems\" (403). His words echo Trigilio's endorsement of Marjorie Perloff's opinion that critics are too often \"unwilling to engage the experimental scope of Ginsberg's poems\" (Trigilio 774). Sympathetic reading, however, clashes with suspicious reading, which \"involves a sense of vigilant preparedness for attack\" (Shand in Felski 220). Breslin is sympathetic not only to the experimental forms of \"Kaddish\" and \"Howl,\" but also to their attestation to \"deep, long-standing private conflicts in Ginsberg—conflicts that ultimately stem from his ambivalent attachment to his mother\" (403). In \"Kaddish,\" Allen's ambivalent feelings toward his mother are conspicuous in his revolted and revolting reaction to her exposed body, combined with his blasé deliberation on whether to respond to her apparent sexual provocation: One time I thought she was trying to make me come lay her—flirting to herself at sink—lay back on huge bed that filled most of the room, dress up round her hips, big slash of hair, scars of operations, pancreas, belly wounds, abortions, appendix, stitching of incisions pulling down in the fat like hideous thick zippers—ragged long lips between her legs—What, even, smell of asshole? I was cold—later revolted a little, not much—seemed perhaps a good idea to try—know the Monster of the Beginning Womb—Perhaps—that way. Would she care? She needs a lover. (\"Kaddish\" 219)In \"Confessing the Body,\" Elizabeth Gregory observes that \"Naomi's ordinary body becomes monstrous in this description—not only in its details but in the undiscriminating desire her son attributes to it ('Would she care?')\" (47). In exposing Naomi thus, Allen also exposes himself and his own indiscriminate sexual responsiveness. Such textual exposés pose challenges for those who would practice a hermeneutic of suspicion by \"reading texts against the grain to expose their repressed or hidden meanings\" (Felski 215). It appears that there is little that is hidden or repressed in \"Kaddish\" for a suspicious reader to expose. As Perloff notes, \"the Ginsberg of 'Kaddish' is writing somewhat against the grain\" (213). In writing against the grain, Ginsberg inhibits reading against the grain. A hermeneutic of suspicion holds \"that manifest content shrouds darker, more unpalatable truths\" (Felski 216). \"Kaddish,\" however, parades its unpalatable truths. Although Ginsberg as a Beat poet is not technically included among the group of poets known as the \"confessionals,\" \"Kaddish\" is typical of a \"confessional poem\" in that it \"dwells on experiences generally prohibited expression by social convention: mental illness, intra-familial conflicts and resentments, childhood traumas, sexual transgressions and intimate feelings about one's body\" (Gregory 34). There is a sense in which \"we do not need to be suspicious\" of such subversive texts because they are \"already doing the work of suspicion for us\" (Felski 217). It is also difficult to read \"Kaddish\" suspiciously because it presents itself as an autobiographical history of Ginsberg's relationship with his mother. \"Kaddish\" once again accords with Gregory's definition of \"confessional poetry\" as that which \"draws on the poet's autobiography and is usually set in the first person. It makes a claim to forego personae and to represent an account of the poet's own feelings and circumstances\" (34). These defining features of \"Kaddish\" make it not particularly conducive to a \"suspicious hermeneutic [that] often professes a lack of interest in the category of authorship as a means of explaining the ideological workings of texts\" (Felski 222). It requires considerable effort to distinguish Allen, speaker and character in \"Kaddish,\" from Ginsberg, celebrity Beat poet and author of \"Kaddish,\" and to suspend knowledge of Ginsberg's public-private life in order to pry ideologies from the text. This difficulty of resisting biographical interpretation of \"Kaddish\" translates to a difficulty of reading the poem suspiciously. In his psychoanalytic reading, Breslin's lack of suspicion for the poem's confession of autobiography dilutes his practice of an inherently suspicious mode of interpretation—that of psychoanalysis. His psychoanalysis of Ginsberg shows that he trusts \"Kaddish\" to confess its author's intimate feelings—\"'It's my fault,' he must have felt, 'if I had loved my mother more, this wouldn't have happened to her—and to me'\" (Breslin 422)—whereas a hermeneutic of suspicion \"adopts a distrustful attitude toward texts\" (Felski 216). That said, Breslin's differentiation between the conscious and unconscious, or surface and underlying levels of meaning in \"Kaddish\" is more clearly characteristic of a hermeneutic of suspicion's theory that texts withhold \"meanings or implications that are not intended and that remain inaccessible to their authors as well as to ordinary readers\" (Felski 216). Hence, Breslin speculates that, \"on an unconscious level the writing of the poem may have been an act of private communication between the poet\" and his mother (430). His response to the previously quoted passage of the poem suggests that while a cursory glance will restore its conscious meaning, a more attentive or suspicious gaze will uncover its unconscious: At first glance this passage seems a daring revelation of an incest wish and a shockingly realistic description of the mother's body. But what we really see here is how one post-Freudian writer, pretending to be open and at ease about incestuous desire, affects sophisticated awareness as a defense [sic] against intense longings and anxieties. The lines are charged with feelings that the poet, far from \"confessing out,\" appears eager to deny. (Breslin 422; my emphasis)Breslin's temporary suspicious gaze in an otherwise trusting and sympathetic reading accuses the poet of revealing incestuous desire paradoxically in order to conceal incestuous desire. It exposes the exposé as an ironic guise, an attempt at subterfuge that the poet fails to conceal from the suspicious reader, evoking a hermeneutic of suspicion's conviction that in spite of itself \"the text is not fully in control of its own discourse\" (Felski 223). Breslin's view of Ginsberg's denial through the veil of his confession illuminates two possible ways of sustaining a suspicious reading of \"Kaddish.\" One is to distrust its claim to confess Ginsberg, to recognise that \"confession's reality claim is an extremely artful manipulation of the materials of poetry, not a departure from them\" (Gregory 34). It is worth mentioning that in response to his interviewer's perception of the \"absolute honesty\" in his poem \"Ego Confession,\" Ginsberg commented: \"they're all poems, ultimately\" (Spontaneous 404–05). Another way is to resist the double seduction operative in the text: Naomi's attempted seduction of Allen, and, in narrating it, Allen's attempted seduction of the psychoanalytic critic.Sarah Macfarlane's effort to unmask the gender politics that psychoanalytic critics arguably protect characterises her \"socio-cultural analysis\" (5) of \"Kaddish\" as unmistakably suspicious. While psychoanalytic critics \"identify a 'psychic' context for the literary work, at the expense of social or historical context\" (Barry 105), Macfarlane in her thesis \"Masculinity and the Politics of Gender Construction in Allen Ginsberg\" locates Allen's \"perception of Naomi as the 'Monster of the Beginning Womb'\" in the social and historical context of the 1950s \"concept of the overbearing, dominating wife and mother who, although confined to the domestic space, looms large and threatening within that space\" (48). In so doing, she draws attention to the Cold War discourse of \"momism,\" which \"envisioned American society as a matriarchy in which dominant mothers disrupted the Oedipal structure of the middle-class nuclear family\" (Macfarlane 33). In other words, momism engaged Freudian explanations of male homosexuality as arising from a son's failure to resolve unconscious sexual desire for his mother, and blamed mothers for this failure and its socio-political ramifications, which, via the Cold War cultural association of homosexuality with communism, included \"the weakening of masculine resolve against Communism\" (Edelman 567). Since psychoanalysis effectively colludes with momism, psychoanalytic criticism on \"Kaddish\" is unable to expose its perpetuation in the poem. Macfarlane's suspicious reading of \"Kaddish\" as perpetuating momism radically departs from the dominant restorative criticism on the poem. Trigilio, for example, argues that \"Kaddish\" revises the Cold War \"discourse of containment—'momism'—in which the exposure of communists was equated to the exposure of homosexuals\" (781). \"Kaddish,\" he claims, (which exposes both Allen's homosexuality and Naomi's communism), \"does not portray internal collapse—as nationalist equations of homosexual and communist 'threats' would predict—but instead produces […] a 'Blessed' poet who 'builds Heaven in Darkness'\" (782). Nonetheless, this blessed poet wails, \"I am unmarried, I'm hymnless, I'm Heavenless\" (\"Kaddish\" 212), and confesses his homosexuality as an overwhelming burden: \"a mortal avalanche, whole mountains of homosexuality, Matterhorns of cock, Grand Canyons of asshole—weight on my melancholy head\"(\"Kaddish\" 214). In \"Confessing the Body,\" Gregory asks whether confessional poetry \"disclose[s] secrets in order to repent of them, thus reinforcing the initial negative judgement that kept them secret,\" or \"to decathect that judgement\" (35). While Allen's confession of homosexuality exudes exhilaration and depression, not guilt—Ginsberg critic Anne Hartman is surely right that \"in the context of [the 1950s] public rituals of confession and repentance engendered by McCarthyism, […] poetic confession would carry a very different set of implications for a gay poet\" (47)—it is pertinent to question his confession of Naomi. Does he expose Naomi in order to applaud or condemn her maternal transgressions? According to the logic of the Cold War \"urge to unveil, [which] produces greater containment\" (Trigilio 794), Allen's unveiling of Naomi veils his desire to contain her, unable as she is \"to be contained within the 1950's [sic] domestic ideal of womanhood\" (Macfarlane 44). \"Ginsberg has become such a public issue that it's difficult now to read him naturally; you ask yourself after every line, am I for him or against him. And by and large that's the criticism he has gotten—votes on a public issue. (I see this has been one of those reviews.)\" (Shapiro 90). Harvey Shapiro's review of Kaddish and Other Poems (1961) in which \"Kaddish\" first appeared illuminates the polarising effect of Ginsberg's celebrity on interpretations of his poetry. While sympathetic readings and romantic portrayals are themselves reactions to the \"hostility to Ginsberg\" that prevails (Perloff 223), often they do not sprout the intellectual vigour and fresh perspectives that a hermeneutic of suspicion has the capacity to sow. Yet it is difficult to read confessional texts such as \"Kaddish\" suspiciously; they appear to expose themselves without need of a suspicious reader. Readers of \"Kaddish\" such as Breslin are seduced into sympathetic biographical-psychoanalytical interpretations due to the poem's purported confession of Ginsberg's autobiography. As John Osborne argues, \"the canon of Beat literature has been falsely founded on biographical rather than literary criteria\" (4). The result is that \"we are for the immediate future obliged to adopt adversarial reading strategies if we are to avoid entrenching an already stale orthodoxy\" (Osborne 4). Macfarlane obliges in her thesis; she succeeds in reading \"Kaddish\" suspiciously by resisting its self-inscribed psychoanalysis to expose the gender politics of Allen's exposés. While Allen's confession of his homosexuality suggests that \"Kaddish\" subverts a heterosexist model of masculinity, a suspicious reading of his exposure of Naomi's maternal transgressions suggests that the poem contributes to momism and perpetuates a sexist model of femininity. Even so, a suspicious reading of a text such as \"Kaddish\" \"contains a tacit tribute to its object, an admission that it contains more than meets the eye\" (Felski 230). Ginsberg's own prophetic words bespeak as much:The worst I fear, considering the shallowness of opinion, is that some of the poetry and prose may be taken too familiarly, […] and be given the same shallow treatment, this time sympathetic, as, until recently, they were given shallow unsympathy. That would be the very we of fame. (Ginsberg, Deliberate 252)ReferencesBarry, Peter. Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory. 2nd ed. Manchester: Manchester UP, 2002.

IntroductionIf we follow the line of much literature surrounding airports and urban mobility, the emphasis often falls on the fact that these spaces are designed to handle the mega-scale and super-human pace of mass transit. Airports have rightly been associated with velocity, as zones of rapid movement managed by enormous processing systems that guide bodies and things in transit (Pascoe; Pearman; Koolhaas; Gordon; Fuller & Harley). Yet this emphasis tends to ignore the spectrum of tempos and flows that are at play in airport terminals — from stillness to the much exalted hyper-rapidity of mobilized publics in the go-go world of commercial aviation.In this photo essay I'd like to pull a different thread and ask whether it's possible to think of aeromobility in terms of “uneven, differential mobility” (Bissell 280). What would it mean to consider waiting and stillness as forms of bodily engagement operating over a number of different scales and temporalities of movement and anticipation, without privileging speed over stillness? Instead of thinking mobility and stillness as diametrically opposed, can we instead conceive of them as occupying a number of different spatio-temporal registers in a dynamic range of mobility? The following is a provisional \"visual ethnography\" constructed from photographs of air terminal light boxes I have taken over the last five years (in Amsterdam, London, Chicago, Frankfurt, and Miami). Arranged into a \"taxonomy of differentiality\", each of these images comes from a slightly different angle, mode or directionality. Each view of these still images displayed in billboard-scale light-emitting devices suggests that there are multiple dimensions of visuality and bodily experience at play in these image-objects. The airport is characterized by an abundance of what appears to be empty space. This may be due to the sheer scale of mass transport, but it also arises from a system of active and non-active zones located throughout contemporary terminals. This photo series emphasises the \"emptiness\" of these overlooked left-over spaces that result from demands of circulation and construction.1. We Move the WorldTo many travellers, airport gate lounges and their surrounding facilities are loaded with a variety of contradictory associations and affects. Their open warehouse banality and hard industrial sterility tune our bodies to the vast technical and commercial systems that are imbricated through almost every aspect of contemporary everyday life.Here at the departure gate the traveller's body comes to a moment's rest. They are granted a short respite from the anxious routines of check in, body scans, security, information processing, passport scanning, itineraries, boarding procedures and wayfaring the terminal. The landside processing system deposits them at this penultimate point before final propulsion into the invisible airways that pipe them into their destination. We hear the broadcasting of boarding times, check-in times, name's of people that break them away from stillness, forcing people to move, to re-arrange themselves, or to hurry up. Along the way the passenger encounters a variety of techno-spatial experiences that sit at odds with the overriding discourse of velocity, speed and efficiency that lie at the centre of our social understanding of air travel. The airline's phantasmagorical projections of itself as guarantor and enabler of mass mobilities coincides uncomfortably with the passenger's own wish-fulfilment of escape and freedom.In this we can agree with the designer Bruce Mau when he suggests that these projection systems, comprised of \"openings of every sort — in schedules, in urban space, on clothes, in events, on objects, in sightlines — are all inscribed with the logic of the market” (Mau 7). The advertising slogans and images everywhere communicate the dual concept that the aviation industry can deliver the world to us on time while simultaneously porting us to any part of the world still willing to accept Diners, VISA or American Express. At each point along the way these openings exhort us to stop, to wait in line, to sit still or to be patient. The weird geographies depicted by the light boxes appear like interpenetrating holes in space and time. These travel portals are strangely still, and only activated by the impending promise of movement.Be still and relax. Your destination is on its way. 2. Attentive AttentionAlongside the panoramic widescreen windows that frame the choreography of the tarmac and flight paths outside, appear luminous advertising light boxes. Snapped tightly to grid and locked into strategic sightlines and thoroughfares, these wall pieces are filled with a rotating menu of contemporary airport haiku and ersatz Swiss graphic design.Mechanically conditioned air pumped out of massive tubes creates the atmosphere for a very particular amalgam of daylight, tungsten, and fluorescent light waves. Low-oxygen-emitting indoor plants are no match for the diesel-powered plant rooms that maintain the constant flow of air to every nook and cranny of this massive processing machine. As Rem Koolhaas puts it, \"air conditioning has launched the endless building. If architecture separates buildings, air conditioning unites them\" (Koolhaas). In Koolhaas's lingo, these are complex \"junkspaces\" unifying, colliding and coalescing a number of different circulatory systems, temporalities and mobilities.Gillian Fuller reminds us there is a lot of stopping and going and stopping in the global circulatory system typified by air-terminal-space.From the packing of clothes in ﬁxed containers to strapping your belt – tight and low – stillness and all its requisite activities, technologies and behaviours are fundamental to the ‘ﬂow’ architectures that organize the motion of the globalizing multitudes of today (Fuller, \"Store\" 63). It is precisely this functional stillness organised around the protocols of store and forward that typifies digital systems, the packet switching of network cultures and the junkspace of airports alike.In these zones of transparency where everything is on view, the illuminated windows so proudly brought to us by J C Decaux flash forward to some idealized moment in the future. In this anticipatory moment, the passenger's every fantasy of in-flight service is attended to. The ultimate in attentiveness (think dimmed lights, soft pillows and comfy blankets), this still image is captured from an improbable future suspended behind the plywood and steel seating available in the moment —more reminiscent of park benches in public parks than the silver-service imagined for the discerning traveller.3. We Know ChicagoSelf-motion is itself a demonstration against the earth-binding weight of gravity. If we climb or fly, our defiance is greater (Appleyard 180).The commercial universe of phones, cameras, computer network software, financial instruments, and an array of fancy new gadgets floating in the middle of semi-forgotten transit spaces constitutes a singular interconnected commercial organism. The immense singularity of these claims to knowledge and power loom solemnly before us asserting their rights in the Esperanto of \"exclusive rollover minutes\", \"nationwide long distance\", \"no roaming charges\" and insider local knowledge. The connective tissue that joins one part of the terminal to a commercial centre in downtown Chicago is peeled away, revealing techno-veins and tendrils reaching to the sky. It's a graphic view that offers none of the spectacular openness and flights of fancy associated with the transit lounges located on the departure piers and satellites. Along these circulatory ribbons we experience the still photography and the designer's arrangement of type to attract the eye and lure the body. The blobby diagonals of the telco's logo blend seamlessly with the skyscraper's ribbons of steel, structural exoskeleton and wireless telecommunication cloud.In this plastinated anatomy, the various layers of commercially available techno-space stretch out before the traveller. Here we have no access to the two-way vistas made possible by the gigantic transparent tube structures of the contemporary air terminal. Waiting within the less travelled zones of the circulatory system we find ourselves suspended within the animating system itself. In these arteries and capillaries the flow is spread out and comes close to a halt in the figure of the graphic logo. We know Chicago is connected to us.In the digital logic of packet switching and network effects, there is no reason to privilege the go over the stop, the moving over the waiting. These light box portals do not mirror our bodies, almost at a complete standstill now. Instead they echo the commercial product world that they seek to transfuse us into. What emerges is a new kind of relational aesthetics that speaks to the complex corporeal, temporal, and architectural dimensions of stillness and movement in transit zones: like \"a game, whose forms, patterns and functions develop and evolve according to periods and social contexts” (Bourriaud 11). 4. Machine in the CaféIs there a possible line of investigation suggested by the fact that sound waves become visible on the fuselage of jet planes just before they break the sound barrier? Does this suggest that the various human senses are translatable one into the other at various intensities (McLuhan 180)?Here, the technological imaginary contrasts itself with the techno alfresco dining area enclosed safely behind plate glass. Inside the cafes and bars, the best businesses in the world roll out their biggest guns to demonstrate the power, speed and scale of their network coverage (Remmele). The glass windows and light boxes \"have the power to arrest a crowd around a commodity, corralling them in chic bars overlooking the runway as they wait for their call, but also guiding them where to go next\" (Fuller, \"Welcome\" 164). The big bulbous plane sits plump in its hangar — no sound barriers broken here. It reassures us that our vehicle is somewhere there in the network, resting at its STOP before its GO. Peeking through the glass wall and sharing a meal with us, this interpenetrative transparency simultaneously joins and separates two planar dimensions — machinic perfection on one hand, organic growth and death on the other (Rowe and Slutsky; Fuller, \"Welcome\").Bruce Mau is typical in suggesting that the commanding problem of the twentieth century was speed, represented by the infamous image of a US Navy Hornet fighter breaking the sound barrier in a puff of smoke and cloud. It has worked its way into every aspect of the design experience, manufacturing, computation and transport.But speed masks more than it reveals. The most pressing problem facing designers and citizens alike is growth — from the unsustainable logic of infinite growth in GDP to the relentless application of Moore's Law to the digital networks and devices that define contemporary society in the first world. The shift of emphasis from speed to growth as a time-based event with breaking points and moments of rupture has generated new possibilities. \"Growth is nonlinear and unpredictable ... Few of us are ready to admit that growth is constantly shadowed by its constitutive opposite, that is equal partners with death” (Mau 497).If speed in part represents a flight from death (Virilio), growth invokes its biological necessity. In his classic study of the persistence of the pastoral imagination in technological America, The Machine in the Garden, Leo Marx charted the urge to idealize rural environments at the advent of an urban industrialised America. The very idea of \"the flight from the city\" can be understood as a response to the onslaught of technological society and it's deathly shadow. Against the murderous capacity of technological society stood the pastoral ideal, \"incorporated in a powerful metaphor of contradiction — a way of ordering meaning and value that clarifies our situation today\" (Marx 4). 5. Windows at 35,000 FeetIf waiting and stillness are active forms of bodily engagement, we need to consider the different layers of motion and anticipation embedded in the apprehension of these luminous black-box windows. In The Virtual Window, Anne Friedberg notes that the Old Norse derivation of the word window “emphasizes the etymological root of the eye, open to the wind. The window aperture provides ventilation for the eye” (103).The virtual windows we are considering here evoke notions of view and shelter, open air and sealed protection, both separation from and connection to the outside. These windows to nowhere allow two distinct visual/spatial dimensions to interface, immediately making the visual field more complex and fragmented. Always simultaneously operating on at least two distinct fields, windows-within-windows provide a specialized mode of spatial and temporal navigation. As Gyorgy Kepes suggested in the 1940s, the transparency of windows \"implies more than an optical characteristic; it implies a broader spatial order. Transparency means a simultaneous perception of different spatial locations\" (Kepes 77).The first windows in the world were openings in walls, without glass and designed to allow air and light to fill the architectural structure. Shutters were fitted to control air flow, moderate light and to enclose the space completely. It was not until the emergence of glass technologies (especially in Holland, home of plate glass for the display of commercial products) that shielding and protection also allowed for unhindered views (by way of transparent glass). This gives rise to the thesis that windows are part of a longstanding architectural/technological system that moderates the dual functions of transparency and separation. With windows, multi-dimensional planes and temporalities can exist in the same time and space — hence a singular point of experience is layered with many other dimensions. Transparency and luminosity \"ceases to be that which is perfectly clear and becomes instead that which is clearly ambiguous\" (Rowe and Slutsky 45). The light box air-portals necessitate a constant fluctuation and remediation that is at once multi-planar, transparent and \"hard to read\". They are informatic.From holes in the wall to power lunch at 35,000 feet, windows shape the manner in which light, information, sights, smells, temperature and so on are modulated in society. \"By allowing the outside in and the inside out, [they] enable cosmos and construction to innocently, transparently, converge\" (Fuller, \"Welcome\" 163). Laptop, phone, PDA and light box point to the differential mobilities within a matrix that traverses multiple modes of transparency and separation, rest and flight, stillness and speed.6. Can You Feel It?Increasingly the whole world has come to smell alike: gasoline, detergents, plumbing, and junk foods coalesce into the catholic smog of our age (Illich 47).In these forlorn corners of mobile consumption, the dynamic of circulation simultaneously slows and opens out. The surfaces of inscription implore us to see them at precisely the moment we feel unseen, unguided and off-camera. Can you see it, can you feel it, can you imagine the unimaginable, all available to us on demand? Expectation and anticipation give us something to look forward to, but we're not sure we want what's on offer.Air travel radicalizes the separation of the air traveller from ground at one instance and from the atmosphere at another. Air, light, temperature and smell are all screened out or technologically created by the terminal plant and infrastructure. The closer the traveller moves towards stillness, the greater the engagement with senses that may have been ignored by the primacy of the visual in so much of this circulatory space. Smell, hunger, tiredness, cold and hardness cannot be screened out.In this sense, the airplanes we board are terminal extensions, flying air-conditioned towers or groundscrapers jet-propelled into highways of the air. Floating above the horizon, immersed in a set of logistically ordained trajectories and pressurized bubbles, we look out the window and don't see much at all. Whatever we do see, it's probably on the screen in front of us which disconnects us from one space-time-velocity at the same time that it plugs us into another set of relations. As Koolhaas says, junkspace is \"held together not by structure, but by skin, like a bubble\" (Koolhaas). In these distended bubbles, the traveler momentarily occupies an uncommon transit space where stillness is privileged and velocity is minimized. The traveler's body itself is \"engaged in and enacting a whole kaleidoscope of different everyday practices and forms\" during the course of this less-harried navigation (Bissell 282).7. Elevator MusicsThe imaginary wheel of the kaleidoscope spins to reveal a waiting body-double occupying the projected territory of what appears to be a fashionable Miami. She's just beyond our reach, but beside her lies a portal to another dimension of the terminal's vascular system.Elevators and the networks of shafts and vents that house them, are to our buildings like veins and arteries to the body — conduits that permeate and structure the spaces of our lives while still remaining separate from the fixity of the happenings around them (Garfinkel 175). The terminal space contains a number of apparent cul-de-sacs and escape routes. Though there's no background music piped in here, another soundtrack can be heard. The Muzak corporation may douse the interior of the elevator with its own proprietary aural cologne, but at this juncture the soundscape is more \"open\". This functional shifting of sound from figure to ground encourages peripheral hearing, providing \"an illusion of distended time\", sonically separated from the continuous hum of \"generators, ventilation systems and low-frequency electrical lighting\" (Lanza 43).There is another dimension to this acoustic realm: “The mobile ecouteur contracts the flows of information that are supposed to keep bodies usefully and efficiently moving around ... and that turn them into functions of information flows — the speedy courier, the networking executive on a mobile phone, the scanning eyes of the consumer” (Munster 18).An elevator is a grave says an old inspector's maxim, and according to others, a mechanism to cross from one world to another. Even the quintessential near death experience with its movement down a long illuminated tunnel, Garfinkel reminds us, “is not unlike the sensation of movement we experience, or imagine, in a long swift elevator ride” (Garfinkel 191).8. States of SuspensionThe suspended figure on the screen occupies an impossible pose in an impossible space: half falling, half resting, an anti-angel for today's weary air traveller. But it's the same impossible space revealed by the airport and bundled up in the experience of flight. After all, the dimension this figures exists in — witness the amount of activity in his suspension — is almost like a black hole with the surrounding universe collapsing into it. The figure is crammed into the light box uncomfortably like passengers in the plane, and yet occupies a position that does not exist in the Cartesian universe.We return to the glossy language of advertising, its promise of the external world of places and products delivered to us by the image and the network of travel. (Remmele) Here we can go beyond Virilio's vanishing point, that radical reversibility where inside and outside coincide. Since everybody has already reached their destination, for Virilio it has become completely pointless to leave: \"the inertia that undermines your corporeity also undermines the GLOBAL and the LOCAL; but also, just as much, the MOBILE and the IMMOBILE” (Virilio 123; emphasis in original).In this clinical corner of stainless steel, glass bricks and exit signs hangs an animated suspension that articulates the convergence of a multitude of differentials in one image. Fallen into the weirdest geometry in the world, it's as if the passenger exists in a non-place free of all traces. Flows and conglomerates follow one another, accumulating in the edges, awaiting their moment to be sent off on another trajectory, occupying so many spatio-temporal registers in a dynamic range of mobility.ReferencesAppleyard, Donald. \"Motion, Sequence and the City.\" The Nature and Art of Motion.

Introduction bell hooks equates African-American women with chocolates, which are picked out and selected for someone else’s pleasure. In her writing about white women who have historically dominated the feminist movement, hooks challenges the ways that people conceptualise the “self” and “other”. She uses a feminist lens to question widespread assumptions about the place of Black women in American society. hooks’s work has been applied to the Australian context by Bronwyn Fredericks, to explore the ways that Aboriginal women and men are perceived and “selected” by the broader Australian society. In this paper, we extend previous work about the metaphor of chocolate to discuss the themes underpinning an art exhibition—Hot Chocolate—which was curated by Troy-Anthony Baylis and Frances Wyld. Baylis and Wyld are Aboriginal Australians who are based in Adelaide and whose academic and creative work is centred within South Australia. The exhibition was launched on 14 November 2012 as part of Adelaide’s Visual Arts Program Feast Festival 2012 (CroftWarcon and Fredericks). It was curated in Adelaide’s SASA Gallery (which is associated with the School of Art, Architecture and Design at the University of South Australia). This paper focuses on the development of Hot Chocolate and the work produced by Aboriginal artists contained within it, and it includes a conversation about the work of Pamela CroftWarcon. Moreover, it discusses these works produced by the artists and links them back to the issues of identity and race, and how some Aboriginal people are selected like chocolates over and above others. In this, we are interested in exploring some of the issues around politics, desire, skin, and the fetishisation of race and bodies. The Metaphor of Chocolate This work will focus on how Aboriginal Australians are positioned as “chocolates” and how people of colour are viewed by the wider society, and about whether people have a pliable “soft centre” or a brittle “hard centre.” It uses hooks’s work as a point of reference to the power of the metaphor of chocolate in considering questions about who is “tasty.” In the Australian context, some Aboriginal people are deemed to be more “tasty” than others, in terms of what they say, write, and do (or what they avoid saying, writing, or doing). That is, they are seen as being sweeter chocolates and nicer chocolates than others. We understand that some people find it offensive to align bodies and races of people with chocolate. As Aboriginal women we do not support the use of the term ‘chocolate’ or use it when we are referring to other Aboriginal people. However, we both know of other Aboriginal people who use the metaphor of chocolate to talk about themselves, and it is a metaphor that other people of colour throughout the world similarly might use or find offensive. Historically, chocolate and skin colour have been linked, and some people now see these connections as something that reminds them of a colonial and imperial past (Gill). Some Aboriginal people are chosen ahead of others, perhaps because of their “complementary sweetness,” like an after-dinner mint that will do what the government and decision makers want them to do. They might be the ones who are offered key jobs and positions on government boards, decision-making committees, or advisory groups, or given priority of access to the media outlets (Fredericks). Through these people, the government can say, “Aboriginal people agree with us” or “this Aboriginal person agrees with us.” Aileen Moreton-Robinson is important to draw upon here in terms of her research focused on white possession (2005). Her work explains how, at times, non-Indigenous Anglo-Australians may act in their own interests to further invest in their white possession rather than exercise power and control to make changes. In these situations, they may select Aboriginal people who are more likely to agree with them, ether knowingly or in ignorance. This recycles the colonial power gained through colonisation and maintains the difference between those with privilege and those without. Moreover, Aboriginal people are further objectified and reproduced within this context. The flip side of this is that some Aboriginal people are deemed to be the “hard centres” (who are not pliable about certain issues), the “less tasty” chocolates (who do not quite take the path that others expect), or the “brittle” types that stick in your teeth and make you question whether you made the right choice (who perhaps challenge others and question the status quo). These Aboriginal people may not be offered the same access to power, despite their qualifications and experience, or the depth of their on-the-ground, community support. They may be seen as stirrers, radicals, or trouble makers. These perceptions are relevant to many current issues in Australia, including notions of Aboriginality. Of course, some people do not think about the chocolate they choose. They just take one from the box and see what comes out. Perhaps they get surprised, perhaps they are disappointed, and perhaps their perceptions about chocolates are reinforced by their choice. In 2011, Cadbury was forced to apologise to Naomi Campbell after the supermodel claimed that an advertisement was racist in comparing her to a chocolate bar (Sweney). Cadbury was established in 1824 by John Cadbury in Birmingham, England. It is now a large international corporation, which sells chocolate throughout the world. The advertisement for Cadbury’s Bliss range of Dairy Milk chocolate bars used the strapline, “Move over Naomi, there's a new diva in town” (Moss). Campbell (quoted in Moss) said she was “shocked” by the ad, which was intended as a tongue-in-cheek play on Campbell's reputation for diva-style tantrums and behaviour. “It's upsetting to be described as chocolate, not just for me but for all black women and black people,” she said. “I do not find any humour in this. It is insulting and hurtful” (quoted in Moss). This is in opposition to the Aboriginal artists in the exhibition who, although as individuals might find it insulting and hurtful, are using the chocolate reference to push the boundaries and challenge the audience’s perceptions. We agree that the metaphor of chocolate can take us to the edge of acceptable discussion. But we also believe that being at the edge of acceptability allows us to explore issues that are uncomfortable. We are interested in using the metaphor of chocolate to explore the ways that non-Indigenous people view Aboriginal Australians, and especially, discussions around the politics of identity, desire, skin, and the fetishisation of race and bodies. Developing the Exhibition The Hot Chocolate exhibition connected chocolate (the food) and Hot Chocolate (the band) with chocolate-coloured people. It was developed by Troy-Anthony Baylis and Frances Wyld, who invited nine artists to participate in the exhibition. The invited artists were: Troy-Anthony Baylis, Bianca Beetson, Pamela CroftWarcon, Cary Leibowitz, Yves Netzhamm"
