Prize Giving, which takes place in the first quarter, acknowledges academic performances by boys during the latter half of the preceding year; while Speech Day, now held annually in the Indoor Centre during the fourth quarter, acknowledges academic, cultural and sporting contributions by boys at Michaelhouse. PRIZE-GIVING Address by the Rector, Mr Greg Theron For the past four years, the Matric results at Michaelhouse leads to goal-setting and proper time use, which in turn leads to success outside of school. have been fantastic. Certainly, they make me very proud and I am sure you have been pleased as well. Indeed, according to Last yearâs results are also remarkable because we are not most measures of last yearâs results, we are the top IEB boysâ academically exclusive. We donât have an entrance test and school in South Africa â which is good because this fact take numbers one to 120 in that order to admit them. We like alone will start opening doors after school that were simply academic boys here, and many of you are. But there must be not available before. Remarkably, this comes from a holistic others as well, with other types of thinking and ways of doing school, which is something we take seriously. things. I think your difference is a great strength because you have to learn to work together to achieve your optimum, We expect you all to try to be excellent at something and which is as it is in the big world outside of the Balgowan good at many things â whether in sport, the outdoors, cultural valley. So despite your differences, you are expected to activities or leading life in Godâs service. But we also expect come here and work to your optimum, set goals, focus on this not to be at the expense of academics. Each one of you them, persevere to achieve them â while hopefully learning is expected to work to the limits of his ability so that you are resilience from knocks â and all in all, developing your proud of your work and achievements. talents and working together. This is a gift that we give you. Interestingly enough, we had a discussion as a staff last week Letâs return briefly to the results of the past four years. Were where we looked at the balance between sporting and cultural they unusual? A good rule I like to use in statistics is that demands and academic expectations. And, simply put, where trends are meaningful things to look for, and four years of you are involved in an extracurricular activity that means you good results make a trend.

Give sport and culture and service a full go, but use the time that remains after them judiciously. In short, suck the marrow from the bones of life at Michaelhouse, and leave here at the end of the year for your summer holidays knowing that you gave it your all. I have full faith that the good start to the year will continue. And it starts now. Have a break this half-term, but take the opportunity to go over difficult work, complete a project or check on your progress if needed. Use the time properly. And what of the rest of you in the B to E Blocks? If I look at last yearâs group, when they were juniors they were on almost exactly the same level of achievement as you are. You, too, are on course to achieve something special. This morning, we rightly celebrate those who have achieved Second Prefect Matt Kiln on Prize-Giving Day against their peers. But silently, we also celebrate every little triumph in every subject for every boy. The top academics The John W Hamilton internal scholarships are awarded to get public recognition, while those who have succeeded the boy in each Block who has the highest average and who privately only get to celebrate privately. No matter, as it does is not already a recipient of a scholarship. They come with a not stop you from patting yourself on the back and saying, monetary reward and are for one year only. They are awarded âWell done.â this morning to: D Block â Cyle Wilson Michaelhouse boys know how to, and like to work hard. C Block â Bailey Green Today we celebrate that. The list of significant men who have B Block â Toivo Khumalo passed through the hallowed portals of Screens is legend. A Block â Mkuzo Kuwani They learnt how to work here and give their all, and I know this will continue this year as it always has. The Sir Henry Strakosch scholarships are awarded to the top two boys in each Block and reflect the top marks in Maths To the award winners I say: Well done. You reap the rewards and Science. They are awarded to: of your efforts this morning and we look forward to more of D Block â Sebastian Langebrink and Cyle Wilson the same in times to come. You are greatly appreciated.

I would like to thank you all for coming, and furthermore, would like to extend a warm welcome to each and every one of you attending this Speech Day ceremony. Roughly five years ago, the Matric class of 2016 began the overwhelming journey through the gates of this magnificent fortress. With my being completely equipped with the adequate tools obligatory for combat, coupled with my slightly oversized armour for life, I reluctantly said goodbye to conventionality and hello to opportunity. My first few days at Michaelhouse, like anyone elseâs, Senior Prefect Mkuzo Kuwani were extremely nerve-racking. I was merely a clean-shaven, innocent young boy from Zambia seeking to explore the fundamentals of South African trigonometry. I wasnât informed of the extreme lifestyle change which I was set to experience upon enrolling here. I would like you all to envisage yourselves in a scenario. Letâs take a brief glimpse at Michaelhouse in the year You have been left by yourself at the bottom of a gully in the 2016. Believe me when I say that following last yearâs Berg, and are told that over the course of the next five years extraordinary Matriculating class was quite a frightening you will climb this gully until you reach the summit. There prospect. However, when thinking about the legacy we is no alternative route, and you are obligated to continue could possibly leave at this place, I quickly realised that climbing, as there is no going back. Along your journey you even though 2015 was a year bursting with numerous are likely to encounter small steps and massive ones; you achievements and distinguishable acts of brilliance, 2016 was may even encounter seemingly unsurpassable steps. With no going to be the year of challenge and necessary questioning. further information you are told simply to begin climbing. In order to avoid any sort of misunderstanding, I would like I would like to think that this is an accurate portrayal of the to clarify that I am not at all saying that this year was not quandary every student is positioned in when beginning a filled with outstanding achievements. The Michaelhouse boarding school career. What âtheyâ donât tell you prior to community is lucky enough to consist of many multifaceted, the commencement of this seemingly daunting task is that talented students.

Now, as current Matriculants marimba band along with very accomplished musicians, top- nearing the end of our journey, we tread triumphantly towards class academics as well as a pretty slick Rector. What I am the once unreachable final step. We are forced to reminisce saying, and I would like to reiterate the belief of last yearâs over the last five years and appreciate what has been a life- senior prefect, Ryan Anderson, is that the achievements changing experience for all of us. of the Michaelhouse boys are not the only constituents of quantifying the success of the School. An individual by the name of Art Williams once famously I believe that the success of 2016 can be found in something said: âIâm not telling you itâs going to be easy â Iâm telling more â something greater. The A Block of this year have you itâs going to be worth it.â been an inimitable presence, and sometimes a nuisance, to the management staff. The reasons for this lie fundamentally Some of you A Blockers might still be asking yourselves in the contradictory ideas of progression and constructive today: Has it been worthwhile? Have we, as senior boys in change. the School, used our position of authority to truly uphold the quintessential values of this School? We wanted to move Michaelhouse in a positive direction as a school. However, to some, this direction was east and 25\n\nP:28\n\nSpeech Day to others it was west. This conflict of ideas is not just a To the Rector, the management and numerous staff members Michaelhouse issue but can be seen on a national platform â specifically Mr McMichael, Mr Coxon, Mr Ncamane, Alan with the current socio-political unrest among our tertiary and Mr Jarvis â thank you for always sparing a moment students. to make sure I was coping, and for your valued guidance through the year. The various policy amendments and the implementation of somewhat âsofterâ hierarchical systems were met To the teachers: I am most grateful to you for your efforts with displeasure by the senior boys. This did not stop our in helping me lay the foundations for the rest of my life. mission as we unceasingly used our influence to fight for On behalf of the boys, I would like to thank you for not what we believe in: the Michaelhouse we believe in â the only being teachers inside the classroom but also being Michaelhouse that is based on traditions which the rest of approachable enough to ask for a helping hand in any the world may see as archaic, but which we see as being situation. fundamental to moulding boys into men. How is success found in this, you may ask. Well, the moral of this story is To my School Prefects: We have been through a lot this year, not that boys like to question authority, but rather, it is and I am thankful for having gone through these experiences indicative of the brotherly spirit and unity that exist among with such fine men. We have all been diligent in our roles and these young men. have supported each other in everything that we have done.

I cannot to progress further towards each new step, irrespective of even begin to think of the sacrifices that you make to afford judgement. Now I emphasise the term âtogetherâ because, me opportunities such as coming to Michaelhouse. I have as much as anyone would like to believe so, the success of grown to understand that everything you do is to provide the this School cannot possibly be attributed to an individualâs best for me, and I can only repay you by making the most of actions. There are many key figures who have helped make what you give me. Michaelhouse the magnificent School it currently is, and who have helped me become the person I am today. To my brothers in arms: My experience at Michaelhouse has been nothing short of unforgettable, and I am grateful to say that you are the brothers I never had. I also want to say thank you to a lot of your parents, who have often been my parents-in-acting, and especially Missy Hughes, who has always been willing to go that extra mile for me and take me in on my early returns to School; you truly are my mum away from home. To my Baines Boys: This year proved to be a difficult one for me because I had to move out of the âForeigner/Afrikaner Houseâ. I will forever cherish my memories with all of you. There is a comforting energy in Baines, and it is an energy I will never forget as it helped strengthen my roots in the School. In conclusion, I believe it is only appropriate for me to share my own perspective of Steve Jobsâ sentiments in saying: Hereâs to the Matriculating class of 2016. Hereâs to the crazy ones; the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers; the round pegs in the square holes; the ones who see things differently. We challenge the status quo. You can quote us, disagree with us, glorify or vilify us, but the only thing you cannot do is ignore us, because we set up the parameters for change in the hope that those to come will execute our beliefs. And while some may see us as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because at the end of the day, those of us who are crazy enough to believe we can actually change the world through questioning, are the ones who bring about change. Boys, thank you for this journey. 26\n\nP:29\n\nSpeech Day Address by the Guest of Honour, Dr Sizwe Mabizela Created for Greatness educational environment that your school governing board, your Rector, your academic and support staff, and your Programme director, chairman and other members grounds and hostel staff work hard to create at your school.

One does not have to look far to see growing and hope of a better world.

These include, among look far to see a failing public school system; one does not others, questions on sustainable development; food security; have to look far to see pervasive and debilitating poverty and sustainable energy; global warming and the attendant widening wealth disparity; one does not have to look far to challenges regarding the habitability of our universe; see individuals placed in positions of trust and responsibility shortage of fresh water resources; indifference to the plight who will do all in their power to undermine and discredit of the poor and the marginalised; extreme and unsustainable institutions that were created to strengthen, consolidate and wealth inequalities and unequal distribution of resources; defend our constitutional order.
