        "text": "1. INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 These Terms & Conditions apply to all our Stagecoach schools, Courses, Holiday Workshops/Camps, Workshops and any additional products and/or services offered by Stagecoach and/or its group of companies in the future for any Student (collectively \"Stagecoach Activities\")\n\n1.2 For participation of a Student in a Stagecoach Activity all Parents are required to consent to these Terms & Conditions by signature or by ticking the acceptance box for these Terms & Conditions when submitting an electronic application form online. We may update these Terms & Conditions from time to time.\n\n1.3 Any changes to these Terms & Conditions require the written consent or approval of Stagecoach.\n\n1.4 A \"Course\" refers to a course of classes offering tuition in dance, drama, and singing which will be delivered during the Term (including online activities). Course classes will take place once per week for a certain number of hours, as detailed at the time of booking.\n\n1.5 \"Holiday Workshop/Camp\" refers to Workshops (including online activities) run by some Stagecoach schools and Stagecoach Performing Arts during the breaks between Terms.\n\n1.6 \"Principal\" refers to the principal of a particular Stagecoach school.\n\n1.7 \"Term\" refers to one normal academic term of Stagecoach schools during which Courses are run.\n\n1.8 \"Term Dates\" refers to the dates for the relevant Term.\n\n1.9\n\n1.10\n\n\"Workshop\" refers to a one-off course (including online activities) offering tuition in dance, drama, singing and/or other performing arts related activities which will be delivered for a certain number of hours per day for a period of between one (1) and five (5) consecutive days and can run at any time throughout the year.\n\n“Online activity” refers to online streamed lessons and online Workshops utilising the Zoom platform, either delivered by a Stagecoach school or by Stagecoach Performing Arts. See section point 8.7.\n\n2. ENROLLING A NEW STUDENT IN A STAGECOACH ACTIVITY\n\n2.1 To apply for a place for a new Student on a Stagecoach Activity, the Parent must agree to these Terms & Conditions and submit an application form online or by post.\n\n2.2 Each Student's place is allocated on a 'first come, first served' basis. Applications must be accompanied by the appropriate payment/transfer, as set out for each Stagecoach Activity below (\"Deposit\").\n\nThe Deposit to accompany a new Student's application form for term enrolment: Early Stages £25 (as at 1 July 2020) Main & Further Stages £50 (as at 1 July 2020) For Holiday Workshops and Summer Camps, deposits may vary, please check with the Principal.\n\n2.3 If Stagecoach is unable to accept the Student due to capacity reasons, the Student may, at the Parent's discretion, be placed on a reserve list. Before a Student is placed on a reserve list, the Principal shall inform the Parent whether (i) the Deposit will be retained by Stagecoach whilst the Student is on the reserve list, or (ii) the Deposit will be refunded to the Parent and that the Parent may be required to repay the Deposit at a later date if a place is confirmed. If the Parent does not wish for the Student to be placed on a reserve list the Deposit shall be refunded. In any event Deposits shall always be refunded within fourteen (14) days of informing the Parent that the Deposit is refundable for capacity reasons.\n\n2.4 From the date the Deposit is paid, you have a fourteen (14) calendar day cancellation period (\"Cancellation Period\") to change your mind and cancel the Student's place on the Stagecoach Activity, subject to clauses 2.6 and 2.7 below.\n\n2.5 After the Cancellation Period expires, the Deposit is non-refundable and will be retained by Stagecoach.\n\n2.6 If the start date of a Stagecoach Activity falls within the Cancellation Period and the Stagecoach Activity has finished before the Parent notifies Stagecoach of their desire to cancel, then the Deposit is not cancellable or refundable.\n\n2.7 If the start date of the Stagecoach Activity falls within the Cancellation Period and some of the sessions of the Stagecoach Activity have been delivered before the Parent, within the Cancellation Period, notifies Stagecoach of their desire to cancel, then the Deposit may be partly refunded in proportion to the number of sessions delivered.\n\n2.8 Times, current Term Dates, fees and all relevant course details for booked Stagecoach Activities will be confirmed in the Acceptance Letter or \"Fee Note\" for each Stagecoach Activity, along with a receipt for payment of the Deposit.\n\n2.9 All such terms and conditions detailed in the Fee Note or the Acceptance shall be incorporated into the Agreement and shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Parent upon payment by, or on behalf of, the Parent. 2.10 Fees for Stagecoach Activities may vary between Stagecoach schools.\n\n3. BALANCE PAYMENTS\n\n3.1 For a Student enrolled on a Workshop, the full fees are paid as the Deposit in advance, as detailed in clause 2.2 above.\n\n3.2 For a Student enrolled on either a Course or Holiday Workshop/Camp, following payment of the Deposit to Stagecoach, Parents are required to make a subsequent payment of the outstanding balance due to Stagecoach (the \"Balance\").\n\n3.3 The Balance must be paid in full, subject to any alternative agreements made with the Principal, by the first day of the Term or Holiday Workshop/Camp, by one of the following methods where offered: 1. Bank transfer;\n\n2. Credit card (American Express is not accepted);\n\n3. Debit card;\n\n4. Cheque;\n\n5. Direct Debit;\n\n6. Cash;\n\n7. Childcare vouchers; or Child Tax Credits\n\n3.4 Transaction charges apply to cheques of £1 per cheque.\n\n4. COURSES\n\n4.1 A Stagecoach school may, at its discretion, offer the second child of the same family attending a Main Stage course at the same time, a sibling discount of up to fifty percent (50%) on Course fees. This discretionary sibling discount will only apply if Stagecoach is notified of the sibling relationship at the time the Deposit is paid. Only one discount may apply against the Course fee for an individual child at any one time.\n\n4.2 Once enrolled on a Course, Term Dates for the next Term will be made known to Parents in writing at the end of the current Term.\n\n4.3 If a Course session falls on a bank holiday then a replacement class will also be added onto the end of the current Term timetable or the subsequent Term.\n\n4.4 Unless Stagecoach is otherwise notified in writing by you before the sixth (6th) week of the Course, a Student is automatically re-enrolled onto the Course for the following Term.\n\n4.5 If you do not notify Stagecoach before the sixth (6th) week of the Course that you do not wish a Student to be re-enrolled onto the following Term of the Course, then you will remain liable for half of the full Term fees in respect of the next Term, regardless of attendance of the Student.\n\n4.6 Payment is due for the next Term of Course fees before the start date of the Term, subject to any alternative payment agreements you may have with the Principal.\n\n5. COURSE TRIAL PERIODS\n\n5.1 Where a new Student is attending a Course for the first time, subject to availability, Stagecoach allows a two (2) session trial period (\"Trial Period\") so that the Student may try the first two (2) sessions of the Course. The Trial Period only applies to Courses for new Students and the two (2) trial sessions must be taken consecutively within the first four (4) weeks of the start of the Term.\n\n5.2 You may cancel the Course within five (5) calendar days after the end of the Trial Period and if any additional fees were paid then Stagecoach will refund the Balance to you within fourteen (14) calendar days of your cancellation.\n\n5.3 Once you have notified Stagecoach that you wish to cancel, the Student may no longer attend the Course.\n\n5.4 If no cancellation is made in accordance with clause 5.2, the Agreement for the Course will continue for the duration of the Term and, unless written notice is provided to Stagecoach by the Parent before the end of the sixth (6th) week of the Term, the Agreement will automatically renew for the following Term's Course in accordance with clause 4.4. For the avoidance of doubt, if you do not choose to exercise your right to cancel in accordance with clause 5.2 and the Student later wishes to stop attending the Course during the Term, then Stagecoach is unable to refund the Balance for the Term and notice for cancellation will take effect from the start of the next Term.\n\n6. WORKSHOPS & HOLIDAY WORKSHOPS/CAMPS\n\n6.1 Parents should contact their local Stagecoach school to confirm if it is organising Workshops and/or Holiday Workshops/Camps.\n\n6.2 Dates and times of Workshops and Holiday Workshops/Camps are released in advance on your local Stagecoach website.\n\n6.3 For the avoidance of doubt, the Trial Period and sibling discounts detailed in sections 3 and 4 above do not apply to Workshops or Holiday Workshops/Camps.\n\n6.4 If you cancel a Student's place on a Holiday Workshop/Camp or Course outside of the Cancellation Period and within fourteen (14) calendar days of the commencement of the Holiday Workshop/Camp or Course, the Deposit will be retained by Stagecoach and you will be required to pay fifty percent (50%) of the balance of the fees for the Holiday Workshop/Camp or Course.\n\n6.5 If you cancel a Student's place on a Holiday Workshop/Camp or Course outside of the Cancellation Period and within seven (7) calendar days before the commencement of the Holiday Workshop/Camp or Course, the Deposit will be retained by Stagecoach and you will be required to pay the full balance of the fee. 6.6 Please note that clauses 6.4 and 6.5 above are subject to your statutory cancellation rights as set out in clause 2 of these Terms and Conditions.\n\n7. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\n7.1 The personal data (as it is defined in the Data Protection Act 2018) of a Student and/or Parent will be processed by Stagecoach, including any group companies and/or the Principal(s) of its franchised schools in accordance with its Privacy Policy, which can be found here Privacy Policy . A hard copy of the Privacy Policy can be requested from [email protected].\n\n7.2 Stagecoach owns all the rights, title and interest in and to its websites, including software, text and media and its trade marks, logos and brand elements. Nothing within these Terms & Conditions affects or licences the ownership of these rights. Any intellectual property created during any Course, Workshop or Holiday Workshop/Camp is owned by Stagecoach.\n\n8. HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\n8.1 Students participate at their own risk and are obliged to inform Stagecoach and its staff of any existing injuries or medical condition. All application forms must have any known medical conditions stated and any changes to such information must be notified to Stagecoach immediately in writing.\n\n8.2 If you are unsure whether a Student should participate in any activity please consult the Student's GP before enrolling the Student on a Stagecoach Activity.\n\n8.3 Any medication left on the school premises must be clearly labelled and the Student should, unless Stagecoach has agreed in writing otherwise, be able to administer it themselves.\n\n8.4 Students must wear suitable footwear and clothing at all times, including Stagecoach uniform for all Courses.\n\n8.5 If a Student is unwell or has an accident requiring emergency treatment, the Parent will be contacted via the emergency contact details provided below or on the enrolment form. This number must always be contactable whilst the Student is attending the Stagecoach Activity.\n\n8.6\n\n8.7\n\nParents are solely responsible for ensuring that the emergency contact details on Stagecoach's records are up to date.\n\nAll online activities are recorded and held for a period of four weeks for safeguarding and quality review purposes.\n\n9. PERSONAL PROPERTY\n\n9.1 Students are obliged to take care of their own belongings. Stagecoach can accept no liability for lost or damaged belongings.\n\n9.2 You acknowledge that the maximum aggregate liability of Stagecoach to a Student or Parent under these Terms & Conditions shall not exceed the Stagecoach Activity fee to which a claim relates.\n\n9.3 The liability of Stagecoach and that of its staff is restricted to class time only and then only to gross negligence.\n\n10. GENERAL\n\n10.1 Stagecoach may, at its own discretion, refuse a Student entry to a Stagecoach Activity or session of a Stagecoach Activity if it is felt that the Student's behaviour is unacceptable\n\n10.2 Stagecoach reserves the right to make changes to the timetable, the teaching staff, the advertised programme or the programme delivery mechanism (for clarity this may mean that we switch to online zoom classes) in the event of illness or other circumstances beyond our control.\n\n10.3 Where a session of a Stagecoach Activity has to be cancelled by Stagecoach, Principals will give as much notice as possible. In the event of a last minute session cancellation, you will be notified by email, text message, a call to your mobile phone or through a designated Stagecoach social media site. Parents must ensure that they provide their Principal with up-to-date contact details.\n\nIn the event of a Stagecoach Activity being cancelled, Stagecoach will provide substitute lessons where possible either at an alternative time, venue or online. If no alternative can be offered, Stagecoach will provide refunds for lessons that are unable to be fulfilled.\n\n10.4 It is occasionally necessary to change the time and/or venue of a Stagecoach Activity session. This will only be done if absolutely necessary and Stagecoach will do its best to keep class times, programme delivery mechanisms and/or locations as similar as possible but unfortunately this cannot always be guaranteed.\n\n10.5 In the event that a Student is unable to attend a Stagecoach Activity session, due to sickness, holiday or a decision by the Parent or Student not to attend, Stagecoach regrets that it is unable to refund any payment.\n\n10.6 All Students must be collected on time after a session. Stagecoach is unable to supervise Students after a session and consistent late collection will result in additional charges.\n\n10.8 These Terms & Conditions, together with any Fee Note or Acceptance Letter, constitute the entire agreement between the parties which supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between them, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter."
