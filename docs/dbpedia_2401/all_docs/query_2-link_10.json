        "text": "Changes to Upcoming Events\n\nThe last week of Term 2 hosts a number of special programs at each year level. With the exception of events requiring interstate travel which have had to be cancelled, we are cautiously optimistic that most of the other programs will be able to proceed either as planned or with only minor modifications. We can offer this special program week thanks to the generosity of our staff and I thank all who have committed to this week, especially given that we have experienced high levels of absenteeism due to sickness from COVID-19 and flu-like virus’ this term.\n\nSchool Advisory Council\n\nThe School Advisory Council met this week and continued to contribute to the Annual Action Plan. Of particular interest is an analysis about communication between the College and parents/guardians. It was agreed that we would seek feedback about what is proving effective in terms of communication via a brief survey. Please keep an eye out for the survey as this feedback will be crucial to our planning. We also received a progress report on the redevelopment plans for the disused tennis courts adjoining Great Ryrie St which sounds very exciting. The next gathering of the School Advisory Council is for our Seminar Evening in late July and we will be working with our architects on refining our Master Plan.\n\nCollege Musical - Back to the Theatre\n\nIt’s acknowledged that the Performing Arts, in particular, suffered during our COVID-19 lockdowns. So, with a great sense of anticipation, we look forward to our upcoming Aquinas Musical Revue which has been playfully titled: Back to the Theatre. Over two nights, 16th and 17th June, students will showcase their talents and perform pieces from some of our best known musicals. Tickets are available here: https://www.aquinas.vic.edu.au/events/back-to-the-theatre-musical-revue\n\nSchool Captains Meeting\n\nI had the pleasure this week to meet with our School Captains to hear about progress with their projects during Term 2. As always, it is inspiring to hear young leaders who are so passionate about their school and the wellbeing of their contemporaries. We discussed plans for Term 3 including the introduction of lunch activities for younger students to promote physical activity and teamwork.\n\nYear 7 Enrolment Reminder\n\nA reminder to our families that applications for enrolment in Year 7 for 2024 close on Friday August 19 and that we will not presume that you wish to enrol your Year 5 child just because you have an older child currently enrolled at the College. Please contact the College Registrar, Ms Madeleine Kalla on 9259 3008, should you have any questions.\n\nAdvance Notice\n\nTerm 3 commences for all students on Monday, July 11. Early editions of our calendar may have indicated that it was a student free day rather than a normal Day 6. Student Free Days in Term 3 are:\n\nMonday, August 8 (Staff Spirituality Day)\n\nThursday, August 25 (PT Interviews / Subject Expo)\n\nWednesday, September 7 (GAT).\n\nDarren Atkinson\n\nPrincipal\n\nIt has been a great semester!\n\nAs the first semester of the year concludes, it is timely to reflect on how well the College community has been able to make positive progress despite the challenges that COVID-19 and other illnesses have continued to confront us with. Despite the cold of winter arriving with such consistency over the last few weeks, learning has continued to be the key driver in our appreciation for schooling in its complete and extensive experience at Aquinas. Most of the students have shown resilience and have adapted to the return to school in ways that brings a strong sense of normality despite the imminent absences from school by many, who may have experienced illnesses, periods of isolation and/or other personal setbacks.\n\nThe learning programs applicable to each year level require key elements for success; particularly when focusing on the quality teaching that our staff are able to provide and the readiness and investment shown by each student aiming to achieve their best. Effective use of class time, organisation, use of our intranet and other resources, and the application of study skills are reliable elements, which are strongly complimented by a strong sense of the individual student as a learner, a commitment to making the most of the time while at school and the application of learning to real life situations. I hope that your child has been able to adapt all or some of these elements in their learning experiences during Semester One.\n\nIn addition to the learning experience within the confines of the College, throughout the semester, students have represented the College in EISM sport, they have attended camps, attended excursions and external experiences, performed in plays and have learnt practical skills through the Café N9ne and in Vocational Education and Training programs. Our VCAL students have engaged in work and study outside of the College, while continuing to learn at the school in their respective programs. For most students, their classes are lively and they appear to be making the most of what is on offer to them. This would not be possible if the school’s staff were not committed to offering holistic development based on an appreciation of learning. I hope that you will have the opportunity to thank your child’s teachers for the ways in which they care and teach, particularly as they have maintained high expectations, provided exceptional teaching and have provided support to the students across all areas.\n\nDespite the achievements, it is important to encourage students to continue to make progress if they are to fully achieve their best as Aquinas students. School attendance has been problematic for many due to health reasons and in support of the directions of the health officials, enhancing the safety of others by isolating or staying home while ill. I am thankful for this as it has allowed us to keep the school open. However, these disruptions could also hinder the progress of your child. If you require support to address this, please see your child’s respective Homeroom Teacher or Learning Mentor. It is important that you encourage them to speak with their teachers to ensure that they are meeting all the necessary requirements for different subject areas and that the necessary adjustments are made to assist the learning experience.\n\nA noticeable fact is the increase in the use of electronic devices by students in the yard. Our Responsible Use of Technology Policy, directs students to be responsible for the use of such devices for learning while at school. Unfortunately, some students have become overly reliant on the devices and this may impact on their socialisation with others. In recent weeks, a committee formed by teachers have looked at the contemporary practices regarding electronic devices by analysing research, identifying best practice in other schools and are exploring the number of different possibilities in assisting students to be responsible with the use of their devices. We will start the new term with some adjustments in the effort to address the issues that hinder the responsible use of technology for some students. Please remind your child that their personal devices such as phones and Bluetooth headphones or speakers are not allowed to be used at school, unless under the direction of a staff member for the purpose of learning. Please encourage your child to engage with their peers in conversation, to make use of the many activities available through sports or to access the ARC as a way to avoid boredom and a reliance on phones. I will be providing further guidance when decisions are made about agreed processes and expectations.\n\nSince Monday, May 16, there has been a whole school approach to improving the uniform standards of our students. Over time, uniform wear has been an area that collectively, our community has wanted improvement in, so this process is in response to this. It is important that you understand the process as a way to support your child.\n\nThere is a three strike process that focuses mainly on classroom uniform wear.\n\nEach teacher is responsible for checking uniform wear in their respective class with a reasonably straightforward process of marking this off on the roll.\n\nEach time a student infringes, there needs to be communication between the student and their teacher.\n\nThe first infringement will only lead to a discussion between the student and the teacher\n\nIf a student infringes a second time, the parents will be informed that the student has had a ‘second strike’ and warned that a 3rd strike will result in an after-school detention. This is on a Monday night (Middle School) and Tuesday night (Senior School).\n\nInfringements are collated by IT and sent to our reception staff at the respective reception office. Team Leaders get a report each day for monitoring.\n\nIf a student gets strikes in the same day for something they can’t change (ie wearing the wrong uniform) this will only count as 1 strike, however, if they have several infringements in a day for something they can change, each strike counts.\n\nThey don’t go back to zero after a detention. Each subsequent strike is a detention.\n\nPlease refer to the College Uniform and Student Appearance Policy for details on uniform wear.\n\nOn Thursday June 2, a group of Year 10, 11 and 12 students attended a workshop with Y2 Architects. Students had the opportunity to nominate themselves to attend the workshop and the experience was phenomenal. All of the students are interested in a career in building and construction, architecture or sports. Matt Dwyer, a partner of Y2 mentioned to me that the students were the best he has ever engaged with. He claimed that their interests, their articulation and rational thinking was beyond what he had anticipated. This is great feedback and a positive reminder that we are indeed lucky to have such wonderful students in this community. The students will continue to engage with the architects as further considerations are given to the redevelopment of the Tennis Courts. Further details will be shared with you in future editions of The Lighthouse.\n\nFinally, there has been a lot of planning and preparation for the incoming activities week in the last week of the semester. Key staff at each year level have planned activities and experiences for the students which will assist their holistic learning. Please ensure to discuss the experiences with your child and thank you for the ongoing support you provide for the College. It helps make the school a great learning setting committed to holistic education.\n\nNap Rodezno\n\nDeputy Principal\n\nThank you to the staff who have provided some reflections on their Professional Learning this month:\n\nAlison Prince, Sam Warren and Brendan West - English teachers\n\nAlison, Sam and Brendan attended Ticking Mind’s professional learning session on implementing the new VCE English Study Design. The session was highly valuable given the changes that will be in place for 2023’s Year 11 students. The current comparative elements have been replaced by a more open Crafting Texts unit allowing for a wider variety of writing skills to be honed than in previous years. Additionally, Unit 1s text response has been modified to a personal text response, allowing students to be more expressive of their own unique interpretations of texts. The session provided a wealth of new perspectives on teaching resources, skills and techniques that the English department is excited to implement from next year.\n\nSenior Physics - Quantum Theory\n\n\"Last week I took part in an online training session called \"Senior Physics: Quantum Theory Workshop''. The workshop was aimed at introducing teachers to new methods of delivering concepts using practical equipment. Quantum Theory is traditionally an area that does not have a lot of hands-on experiences for students, and as such content can seem difficult to visualise. The workshop introduced ways of measuring the wavelength of light in Young's famous (if you're a Physics teacher) double-slit experiment, and a new method for estimating Planck's constant using LED’s. The current Year 12 Physics students will be the first to try out these new approaches in Term 3.\"\n\nDavid Mullholland - Physics Teacher\n\nPAVCSS “Alternative to ATAR” Conference\n\n\"Parents and educators alike are all too aware that the final years of schooling are changing. With the age up to which a young person is in compulsory education and training now at 17, schools are needing to be creative about how they manage best fit programs for a diverse range of students. VCE both scored and unscored; VCAL currently undergoing a serious reimagining as one senior certificate: the VCE-Vocational Major; the new Victorian Pathways Certificate - all combined with a rapidly changing workplace let alone world can make for an uncertain and stressful time for our young people (and College timetablers!)\n\nAt Aquinas, we are taking positive steps to address these issues front on, and one of those recent initiatives was to host a wonderfully informative round table conference run by the Catholics Principals’ Association: PAVCSS. As a group we heard a series of inspiring and thought provoking presentations from leaders from other Catholic schools who have developed some viable and really creative programs.\n\nThe stated purpose of this day was to share ideas with colleagues and hear what others are considering, and if the buzz around the tables was any indication then it was a huge success. Listening to people from other schools was really informative and challenging at times however it was the ensuing conversation with my colleagues from here that was the most instructive.\"\n\nMeredith Greenwood - Student Programs Coordinator\n\n\"'Alternatives to ATAR' was an event coordinated by the Principals Association of Victorian Catholic Schools to bring together staff willing to share ideas about programs that address a growing need to provide meaningful options for senior students who do not want or need an Australian Tertiary Entrance Rank (ATAR). Examples were shared of a range of micro-credentialing options and post-secondary partnerships that were being trialled. There are some interesting approaches to this cohort who are not necessarily the same students suited to the current VCAL certificate and, given that VCAL is to be superseded by the VCE Vocational Major strand next year, it was also timely to hear how others are planning for this transition. Our special guest, Dr Kelly Jarvis from the VCAA, was able to give some insight into the progress being made in the development of resources and policies at the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority. Aquinas College was the host for this event and a number of our staff who work on senior student pathways were able to be present and share with their contemporaries from other Catholic schools. Those in attendance indicated that the event had been valuable and the topic was worthy of further consideration.\"\n\nDarren Atkinson, Principal and Rachel Crawley, Head Senior Years\n\nGina Goss\n\nAssistant Principal - Staff\n\nGo and Do Likewise\n\nLast Sunday we celebrated the end of the Easter season with Pentecost Sunday and this weekend we celebrate Trinity Sunday. Pentecost focuses on the birth of the church, where the Holy Spirit came down upon the apostles, giving them the gifts needed to face the world, spreading the good news. Trinity Sunday focuses on Trinitarian love, an unconditional love from one God and expressed through three natures. Prior to his death, Jesus instructed his disciples to go out and baptise in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Mt 28:19). From the very beginning of our Church, the message from Jesus has been simple, “Go and do Likewise” (Lk 10:37), go and baptise…\n\nEvangelism is a term that causes people to cringe. People are not comfortable talking about faith with others. Evangelisation is not about standing up, bible in hand and preaching scripture quotes, nor is the focus about encouraging people to convert. It is about sharing the Good News, some will recognise this and receive the News while others may not yet be ready to see; the key is the sharing. St Francis said, “Preach the gospel, use words if necessary”... so practice what you preach.\n\nAs a Catholic school, our foundations are based on sharing the Good News, we are all part of the evangelisation process. We may not always get it right, however through our actions, our striving to follow our mission’s core values, we are sharing the News with each other and with the broader community. Our Year 12 core value is Spirituality and their scripture text is “Go and do Likewise”. As these students complete their final year they will head out into our broader community to share the Good News. Most of the time it will not be in words but in their actions. If we look at so many of our alumni, quietly working to bring equity, justice and peace; who show compassion and perseverance, who fight to ensure our earth is protected and that all of creation can feel they belong - it is then we realise that the love of God is being shared with the world.\n\nTania Grace\n\nAssistant Principal - Mission\n\nSenior Years Report\n\nStudent attendance is an important indicator of student success. Attending school every day for the whole day enables students to participate fully in their learning and develop life and social skills. Positive engagement in school enhances student wellbeing and academic outcomes. In traditional school years, the goal for attendance is to remain above 90% and anything below 80% is of great concern. With multiple periods of isolation and quarantine these targets become more difficult to achieve within semester one.\n\nThe College understands that the current health circumstances are impacting attendance for both students and staff. Illness and injuries are acceptable reasons for being absent from school. Registering absences for COVID still requires an email notifying the deputyprincipal@aquinas.vic.edu.au. For all other absences due to illness or injury, if they extend beyond two days, then a medical certificate is required. Medical certificates can be handed directly to the relevant school office or emailed: absencesmid@aquinas.vic.edu.au or absencessen@aquinas.vic.edu.au.\n\nContinuity in learning and social connections is gained through regular and consistent school attendance. Explained absences such as the ones mentioned above are taken into account when reviewing student attendance. Students with unexplained absences will continue to be queried and students supported to address challenges which impact their ability to consistently and adequately attend school.\n\nIf you have concerns about your child’s current attendance, please do not hesitate to contact your child’s Mentor teacher or Level Leader to discuss reasons or to enable support resources to be provided as required.\n\nRachel Crawley\n\nHead Senior Years\n\nMiddle Years Report\n\nI always thought that Tyson Darmody (Year 9) learnt the hockey skills that gained him selection in the Victorian Under 15 State team in my four week hockey unit in Year 8 PE…but he assures me he has honed his craft for much longer. As promised, Tyson is another great example of a student who is truly living the core value, Perseverance. Here, Tyson talks about how how seeing improvements in his game helps enormously with his motivation and that a variety of setbacks and the pain of being hit by a hockey ball (they are really hard!) can’t override his desire to play the game he just loves.\n\nWhat are some things about hockey that you love?\n\nI love that hockey is a team sport. The fast pace of the game and the constant running as well as the stick skills you can learn. There is also a strategic side of the game that I find appealing.\n\nWhat are some of the main challenges that you have found?\n\nThere is a lots of running so it can be very tiring. The ball is hard so getting hit does hurt and I need to continually strive to improve my stick skills. I didn’t get the chance to play for Victoria at Under 13 level due to COVID so my family made a small training pitch for me in the backyard so I could keep working on my skills. I have had trouble with my knee due to Osgood Schlatters disease over the last couple of years and had to wear a brace to manage the pain. I’ve had to learn how to manage my knee issue and have worked with a personal trainer to strengthen it and understand it better\n\nWhat are some of your greatest memories?\n\nGoing to Newcastle with the Victorian Under 15 squad was the best experience I’ve had in hockey. Being with the team for a whole week and playing each day was something I will never forget. My first time playing in the State Championships is also a great memory as it was the first stage of me seeing the higher levels and made me want to go higher.\n\nDo you have any higher ambitions in hockey?\n\nMy main goal is to play Premier League hockey which is the highest level of senior hockey in Victoria. I want to play for Victoria again at Under 18 and Under 21 level and I would also love to play overseas .\n\nPhil Box\n\nHead Middle Years\n\nUnfortunately, the mental health of young people has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. As many families settle back into pre-COVID routines, there seems to be a pervasive sense of optimism about what lies ahead.\n\nYoung people are not immune to what is now being termed the “psychological pandemic”. Young people are at risk of not achieving the primary demands of developmental tasks such as procuring independence, identity formation, as well as obtaining and maintaining peer relationships. What young people need most in the current environment is support, understanding, empathy and encouragement from caring adults. They live up or down to the expectations we set for them.\n\nIf there is a silver lining to the adversity caused by the pandemic, then it is the building of resilience. Resilience is the capacity to face, overcome, be strengthened and transformed by adversity. Never before have parents needed the skills, the knowledge and the strategies to build resilience in their children as much as they do now. There are 7 integral and interrelated components that make up being resilient that can help young people thrive and develop healthy coping strategies. The 7 C’s are: Confidence, Competence, Connection, Character, Contribution, Coping and Control.\n\nStudents will need resilience and each of the 7 C’s as they embark on their final weeks of Term Two which may include exams and completion of final assessments followed by special programs at each Year level that take students out of their comfort zone and familiar routine and places students in different environments, mixing with different peers and staff members.\n\nFor students completing exams, setting a schedule is vitally important. Students need to schedule everything from sleeping and eating, to studying and exercising. It is one of the best ways to manage inevitable exam stress. Students need to look after themselves when they have big demands in their life. When it comes to productive study, sometimes less is often more. It is recommended that students hit the books in 50-minute stints, broken up by 10 to 15 minute breaks. This gives the brain, and body, a rest. Young people will often underestimate the amount of sleep they need. Getting enough sleep is key to memory and retention and therefore, successful study practices. Research shows that physical activity also has a very positive impact on mental wellbeing so students should factor exercise into their study schedule. Eating well is another crucial factor to maintaining concentration and staying focussed on the task ahead. So successful exam preparation and staying mentally and physically healthy during the final weeks of term is about more than just hitting the books. Students must also focus on their sleep, diet, physical activity and maintaining a balance. Caregivers play an integral role in assisting their children to manage all of these areas.\n\nWe wish students and caregivers well for these busy yet exciting weeks ahead.

The way I had to quickly adapt to a new lifestyle on the streets, coming from a home of wealth and comfort made me realise how not everyone has the same opportunities as myself and that, for some people, there is no way out of this lonely, miserable life.\n\nI found finding a place to stay very challenging, you feel like you can't ask for help because asking is utterly humiliating, you’re ignored and it is just so dehumanising.\n\nAs a person coming from a life of luxury, I have never needed to think about when I would get to eat next or where I could stay that night. I always had a bed and a family to go back to, I always had order and safety, and I took advantage of the privilege I had.\n\nThis experience has caused me to look at who I am and how I treat others, being thrown out on the streets so suddenly, you never realise what you had until it's gone. It’s heart breaking to think of how hard it was to go through this for 10 days, how distraught and helpless I felt. I have the utmost respect for those who have been through this for longer than I, for the people who don’t know if there will ever be an end. More has to be done for these people, they are genuinely good people in bad circumstances, they deserve more than to have their pleads and cries for help shrugged off, they are people just like you and me.\n\nNobody ever asks to go through this, nobody should ever feel so lost and hopeless, they are marginalised, without human connection, and they feel shoved off to the side and ignored. Even the smallest interaction or donation can help them feel seen and heard. I have learned to allow these people into my heart as everyone else should because they are human too. My respect for them and their strength has forever changed the way I treat others.\""
