Prize Giving, which takes place in the first quarter, acknowledges academic performances by boys during the latter half of the preceding year; while Speech Day, now held annually in the Indoor Centre during the fourth quarter, acknowledges academic, cultural and sporting contributions by boys at Michaelhouse. PRIZE-GIVING Address by the Rector, Mr Greg Theron For the past four years, the Matric results at Michaelhouse leads to goal-setting and proper time use, which in turn leads to success outside of school. have been fantastic. Certainly, they make me very proud and I am sure you have been pleased as well. Indeed, according to Last year’s results are also remarkable because we are not most measures of last year’s results, we are the top IEB boys’ academically exclusive. We don’t have an entrance test and school in South Africa – which is good because this fact take numbers one to 120 in that order to admit them. We like alone will start opening doors after school that were simply academic boys here, and many of you are. But there must be not available before. Remarkably, this comes from a holistic others as well, with other types of thinking and ways of doing school, which is something we take seriously. things.

This is a gift that we give you. Interestingly enough, we had a discussion as a staff last week Let’s return briefly to the results of the past four years.

Give sport and culture and service a full go, but use the time that remains after them judiciously. In short, suck the marrow from the bones of life at Michaelhouse, and leave here at the end of the year for your summer holidays knowing that you gave it your all. I have full faith that the good start to the year will continue. And it starts now. Have a break this half-term, but take the opportunity to go over difficult work, complete a project or check on your progress if needed. Use the time properly. And what of the rest of you in the B to E Blocks? If I look at last year’s group, when they were juniors they were on almost exactly the same level of achievement as you are. You, too, are on course to achieve something special. This morning, we rightly celebrate those who have achieved Second Prefect Matt Kiln on Prize-Giving Day against their peers. But silently, we also celebrate every little triumph in every subject for every boy. The top academics The John W Hamilton internal scholarships are awarded to get public recognition, while those who have succeeded the boy in each Block who has the highest average and who privately only get to celebrate privately.

The Sir Henry Strakosch scholarships are awarded to the top two boys in each Block and reflect the top marks in Maths To the award winners I say: Well done. You reap the rewards and Science. They are awarded to: of your efforts this morning and we look forward to more of D Block – Sebastian Langebrink and Cyle Wilson the same in times to come. You are greatly appreciated.

Together we are a collegiate assembly of diverse skills, representing the various stakeholders of Michaelhouse, notably parents and Old Boys. We say goodbye and thank you to Zola Songca, Peter Harris and Charles Nupen, who, after serving two terms of four years each on the board, will be retiring at the end of this year. Zola Songca, a medical doctor from Pietermaritzburg, has been the distinguished chair of the stakeholder engagement subcommittee. Peter Harris and Charles Nupen have been human rights lawyers from the time that they were apprenticed to the Legal Resources Centre in the bad old days.

I would like to thank you all for coming, and furthermore, would like to extend a warm welcome to each and every one of you attending this Speech Day ceremony. Roughly five years ago, the Matric class of 2016 began the overwhelming journey through the gates of this magnificent fortress. With my being completely equipped with the adequate tools obligatory for combat, coupled with my slightly oversized armour for life, I reluctantly said goodbye to conventionality and hello to opportunity. My first few days at Michaelhouse, like anyone else’s, Senior Prefect Mkuzo Kuwani were extremely nerve-racking. I was merely a clean-shaven, innocent young boy from Zambia seeking to explore the fundamentals of South African trigonometry. I wasn’t informed of the extreme lifestyle change which I was set to experience upon enrolling here. I would like you all to envisage yourselves in a scenario. Let’s take a brief glimpse at Michaelhouse in the year You have been left by yourself at the bottom of a gully in the 2016. Believe me when I say that following last year’s Berg, and are told that over the course of the next five years extraordinary Matriculating class was quite a frightening you will climb this gully until you reach the summit. There prospect. However, when thinking about the legacy we is no alternative route, and you are obligated to continue could possibly leave at this place, I quickly realised that climbing, as there is no going back. Along your journey you even though 2015 was a year bursting with numerous are likely to encounter small steps and massive ones; you achievements and distinguishable acts of brilliance, 2016 was may even encounter seemingly unsurpassable steps. With no going to be the year of challenge and necessary questioning. further information you are told simply to begin climbing. In order to avoid any sort of misunderstanding, I would like I would like to think that this is an accurate portrayal of the to clarify that I am not at all saying that this year was not quandary every student is positioned in when beginning a filled with outstanding achievements. The Michaelhouse boarding school career. What “they” don’t tell you prior to community is lucky enough to consist of many multifaceted, the commencement of this seemingly daunting task is that talented students. I am talking about all of you gentlemen. there will be additional individuals joining you at various Not every school in the country can claim a world-class stages of the journey, some for brief periods of time and some individual public speaker and debater, numerous provincial who will remain pivotal influences on you throughout the and even national sporting representatives, a highly regarded five years, and possibly beyond. Now, as current Matriculants marimba band along with very accomplished musicians, top- nearing the end of our journey, we tread triumphantly towards class academics as well as a pretty slick Rector. What I am the once unreachable final step. We are forced to reminisce saying, and I would like to reiterate the belief of last year’s over the last five years and appreciate what has been a life- senior prefect, Ryan Anderson, is that the achievements changing experience for all of us. of the Michaelhouse boys are not the only constituents of quantifying the success of the School. An individual by the name of Art Williams once famously I believe that the success of 2016 can be found in something said: “I’m not telling you it’s going to be easy – I’m telling more – something greater. The A Block of this year have you it’s going to be worth it.” been an inimitable presence, and sometimes a nuisance, to the management staff. The reasons for this lie fundamentally Some of you A Blockers might still be asking yourselves in the contradictory ideas of progression and constructive today: Has it been worthwhile? Have we, as senior boys in change. the School, used our position of authority to truly uphold the quintessential values of this School? We wanted to move Michaelhouse in a positive direction as a school. However, to some, this direction was east and 25 Speech Day to others it was west. This conflict of ideas is not just a To the Rector, the management and numerous staff members Michaelhouse issue but can be seen on a national platform – specifically Mr McMichael, Mr Coxon, Mr Ncamane, Alan with the current socio-political unrest among our tertiary and Mr Jarvis – thank you for always sparing a moment students. to make sure I was coping, and for your valued guidance through the year. The various policy amendments and the implementation of somewhat “softer” hierarchical systems were met To the teachers: I am most grateful to you for your efforts with displeasure by the senior boys. This did not stop our in helping me lay the foundations for the rest of my life. mission as we unceasingly used our influence to fight for On behalf of the boys, I would like to thank you for not what we believe in: the Michaelhouse we believe in – the only being teachers inside the classroom but also being Michaelhouse that is based on traditions which the rest of approachable enough to ask for a helping hand in any the world may see as archaic, but which we see as being situation. fundamental to moulding boys into men. How is success found in this, you may ask. Well, the moral of this story is To my School Prefects: We have been through a lot this year, not that boys like to question authority, but rather, it is and I am thankful for having gone through these experiences indicative of the brotherly spirit and unity that exist among with such fine men. We have all been diligent in our roles and these young men. have supported each other in everything that we have done. Through the triumphs and tragedies of 2016 the Boys of To my parents: You always tell me to count my blessings, Balgowan remained one School, clasped arm in arm, ready and today I am counting you as one of the blessings. I cannot to progress further towards each new step, irrespective of even begin to think of the sacrifices that you make to afford judgement. Now I emphasise the term “together” because, me opportunities such as coming to Michaelhouse. I have as much as anyone would like to believe so, the success of grown to understand that everything you do is to provide the this School cannot possibly be attributed to an individual’s best for me, and I can only repay you by making the most of actions. There are many key figures who have helped make what you give me. Michaelhouse the magnificent School it currently is, and who have helped me become the person I am today. To my brothers in arms: My experience at Michaelhouse has been nothing short of unforgettable, and I am grateful to say that you are the brothers I never had. I also want to say thank you to a lot of your parents, who have often been my parents-in-acting, and especially Missy Hughes, who has always been willing to go that extra mile for me and take me in on my early returns to School; you truly are my mum away from home. To my Baines Boys: This year proved to be a difficult one for me because I had to move out of the “Foreigner/Afrikaner House”. I will forever cherish my memories with all of you. There is a comforting energy in Baines, and it is an energy I will never forget as it helped strengthen my roots in the School. In conclusion, I believe it is only appropriate for me to share my own perspective of Steve Jobs’ sentiments in saying: Here’s to the Matriculating class of 2016. Here’s to the crazy ones; the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers; the round pegs in the square holes; the ones who see things differently. We challenge the status quo. You can quote us, disagree with us, glorify or vilify us, but the only thing you cannot do is ignore us, because we set up the parameters for change in the hope that those to come will execute our beliefs. And while some may see us as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because at the end of the day, those of us who are crazy enough to believe we can actually change the world through questioning, are the ones who bring about change. Boys, thank you for this journey. 26 Speech Day Address by the Guest of Honour, Dr Sizwe Mabizela Created for Greatness educational environment that your school governing board, your Rector, your academic and support staff, and your Programme director, chairman and other members grounds and hostel staff work hard to create at your school.

At various levels of our society, one does not have to look far to see leadership that is bereft of moral or ethical content; The fall of the Berlin Wall in the late 1980s, followed by the leadership whose relationship with the truth is very tenuous, demise of apartheid in our country in the early 1990s, gave at best. One does not have to look far to see growing and hope of a better world. Alas, the world we all share today is intolerable malfeasance in our society; one does not have to beset with unprecedented challenges. These include, among look far to see a failing public school system; one does not others, questions on sustainable development; food security; have to look far to see pervasive and debilitating poverty and sustainable energy; global warming and the attendant widening wealth disparity; one does not have to look far to challenges regarding the habitability of our universe; see individuals placed in positions of trust and responsibility shortage of fresh water resources; indifference to the plight who will do all in their power to undermine and discredit of the poor and the marginalised; extreme and unsustainable institutions that were created to strengthen, consolidate and wealth inequalities and unequal distribution of resources; defend our constitutional order.

The standards of the IEB are held in high regard by international and South African tertiary institutions. In their first two years at Michaelhouse, boys participate in a non-specialist academic programme where some of the subjects that are regarded as core disciplines are combined into broader learning areas. This exposure to broader areas of learning enables boys to make an informed decision about the subject package chosen for their matriculation course. A package of seven subjects is then selected for a three-year course, from C Block through to A Block (Grade 10 to Grade 12). A large number of subject package options offer the opportunity to gain a National Senior Certificate with university entrance dispensation. Our 680 ha classroom allows for a myriad of opportunities to develop academic discipline in an educational environment specifically geared towards the ways in which boys learn.

The Schlesinger Theatre Foyer Gallery held a number of exhibitions in 2016. The year began with an exhibition of Matric work, which was then replaced in the Pentecost Quarter by an exhibition of C Block portraits. The Michaelmas Quarter saw an exhibition being held for the prize winners of the annual Community Partnership Art Competition, as well as the second annual Michaelhouse- Treverton B and C Block exhibition. The gallery space was full to the brim with art of a very high quality, and many compliments were given on the growing standard of art at the School. The exhibition was opened by the head of the drama department at Treverton College, Clare Botha.

It is wonderful to see the Art School grow into a home away from home for many of the boys, with boys of all ages becoming a family. The school has been characterised by a buzz of activity both day and night, with music playing and creativity oozing. I am particularly happy with the growing number of boys taking Art and the fact that we are going to have to become even more creative in our handling of studio space now that we won’t be able to accommodate both the A and B Blocks comfortably in the upstairs studio in 2017 because of this sudden growth spurt.

It is where the passion, enthusiasm and creative energy of a group of boys, who consider the subject to be a labour of love, reside. It is a lively, bustling environment where new pieces are being lovingly created by the boys, and they are constantly in awe of the work they are able to produce. In 2015 our Dramatic Arts Matric boys excelled in the final IEB examinations, with nine A symbols out of a group of 16 boys. The driving force behind those results was the sheer passion they had for the subject. During the year, a workshop took place with physical theatre artists TQ and Mpilo from the Hexagon Theatre. Those boys who were keen on movement and physical expression enjoyed their time with these artists and learnt many skills. The workshop culminated in TQ and Mpilo performing their physical theatre production, The Termite, in the theatre. So, not only did the boys acquire new performance skills, they were also able to see the end-product of such skills. William le Cordeur, our theatre director and Dramatic Arts Bruere Venter and James Harrison teacher for the D and E Block classes, also conducted voice workshops with the boys. These sessions were aimed at best theatre productions they had ever seen. teaching each boy to hone his voice and use it effectively in the theatre, leaving him with a life skill as well as an essential It was encouraging to see many C and B Block boys audition skill for the stage. for Romeo and Juliet in the third quarter.
