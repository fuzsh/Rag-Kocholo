        "text": "Pastoral Update\n\nRebecca Anderson – Pastoral Lead\n\nAs pastoral lead, it’s always a privilege to meet and support our new Year 12 and welcome back the familiar faces in Year 13. We love our college community and want everyone to know they have a safe and nurturing place at S6C, where they can learn and grow and challenge themselves, as they build further on their existing skills and knowledge, and also build a community together.\n\nIn addition to our full day focus on mental health and wellbeing, Year 12 have been following the first section of our Life Skills Pathway, in tutor and assemblies: It’s All About You. They have had sessions on settling in, working out who we want to be, online safety, how to support our college LGBTQ+ community, careers, and Black History Month. Year 13 are working on the last section of the Life Skills Pathway, Be The Best Version Of Yourselves and have had loads of information and personal support in planning their next steps, whether that is uni, apprenticeships or employment, but they have also had a think about how to manage their online footprint, and how to study and revise.\n\nAs a college, we have celebrated National Mental Health Day, National Coming Out Day, and Black History Month and our Student Union has been asking students which awareness days, events and religious or cultural celebrations they would like us to mark during the year. We are always open to suggestions to add to our existing calendar. So much for us all to learn and so much to remember and celebrate! Our amazing Student Union are settling into their roles and will share student feedback with us on whatever is important to our young people at any given moment, so that we can develop this college together.\n\nPastoral support sits at the heart of S6C. Students can thrive academically and personally when they are supported in their physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. There is information on how to get help in college on our website but also on the back of every toilet door in college – students can look out for the Safe@S6C and Who Can Help Me posters, and can book a short meeting with Catherine Pennington, for mental health support, and with me for any other issue (or if mental health issues are complicated by other concerns). Tutors, teachers, study centre staff, our Reception team , and other support staff, are all able and willing to help and can pass on concerns as needed, whilst maintaining a respectful and sensitive approach to sharing information.\n\nThe college runs on mutual respect and we treat these amazing young people like young adults from the moment they walk through the door. We have had to encourage a few students to rise to this challenge but we know from past experience that they will all get there!\n\nOur aim is to make college inclusive for all and we have said to students that we always want to hear if our high standards for kindness, encouragement, and a zero tolerance approach to racism, bullying, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, or discrimination, are not being met. If we know, we have an opportunity to challenge and educate and support as needed. We are also very aware that everyone learns differently and we all have our strengths and areas for development, and some students have very specific needs. Students who would like some more help accessing their courses, the pastoral programme, clubs, and special events, can send me a Chat message and we will then chat in person, or arrange for them to talk to someone they know, to help them plan steps that will make them feel settled, even when out of their comfort zones.\n\nWe always welcome input from parents and carers, even as our young adults move towards independence. We are available for your young people, and our wider college community, so do not hesitate to get in touch.\n\nI’d like to remind students to keep themselves safe in person and online, and that external help is available for young adults up to the age of 25 from The Mix, and from The Samaritans 24/7 for all. Students or families with concerns about mental health can also ring the Single Point of Access number on this website, which also has a huge amount of support information for young people and their carers.\n\nPlease do ask your young people if you can take a look at the resources for Black History Month on Classroom. S6C celebrates Black / other cultural and ethnic background History in October and every day. Year 12 had an honest and encouraging talk from Nya, who was with us 5 years ago, on growing up in Salisbury coming from a mixed racial background. Asked to send her highlights to share with you, she said: “I don’t think Salisbury always lends itself very well to getting in touch with your background, however there are things you can do! I would encourage BAME students to read the works of authors such as Toni Morrison, Bell Hooks, or the works of any author from their background!”\n\n“In an attempt to become more connected to my ancestry, I tried to do things like cooking traditional dishes, listen to the stories of family members, and even did things like going to carnivals in London or Bristol. All these things can help contribute a feeling of community and maybe help you learn more about yourself in the process.”\n\nShe also encouraged all other students to join in with the celebration of black/other cultures and enjoy the music, writing, film, cultural and academic achievements, and to keep listening and learning.\n\nBlack History Is Now | Spotify\n\nBBC iplayer Black History Month\n\nGCSE resits\n\nA letter with all the information you need if you are taking GCSE resits has been sent to parents.

Both of these events served to remind us how important it is to value our staff and how rewarding working in education can be. If you are interested in working with us or you know someone who would like more information, we are hosting an MLP recruitment event here on Monday 16 October from 5.30pm. You’ll get a chance to chat to members of staff who will be able to tell you how great it is to work in the Magna Learning Partnership and you’ll learn of the myriad opportunities available.\n\nThis week everyone in the college took part in a huge variety of activities to observe World Mental Health Day. The Five Ways to Wellbeing were strands throughout the day with speed friending and making cards for the elderly just some of the ways to Connect and dog walking, MMA, sessions in the gym and a farm visit being ways to Be Active. Take Notice included mindful colouring, meditation, a photo competition and short films and Keep Learning contained an anxiety audit, journalling and yoga. The final strand of Give taught us how to help someone having a panic attack and how to be more supportive at home. I hope everyone enjoyed the day and took something away from their activities which they can use to support their own mental health in the future.\n\nAlso this week, we welcomed over 400 people to our open evening and the atmosphere was incredible! I am so proud of the college and I am delighted that so many people are interested in our courses and coming to study with us in 2024. Our next open evening is on Thursday 16 November and you can click here to reserve your free place.\n\nIn sport, we have once again triumphed in Rugby, winning the Burgate Sevens with the following impressive scores:\n\nS6C 14 – 7 Burgate\n\nS6C 17 – 7 Bishops\n\nS6C 35 – 0 Ringwood\n\nOur sport collaboration with WSE comprises Rugby, Football and Netball Academy teams and the enthusiasm, skill and teamwork our players have displayed has been wonderful to witness and I look forward to following their progress during their time at S6C.\n\nAnd very briefly, I’d like to mention that also this week students have attended a lecture on Journalism and Creative Media at Godolphin and have visited the library at Sarum College – another reason why I am so proud of S6C, providing such diverse opportunities for young people to grow and learn.\n\nGCSE Resits\n\nA letter with all the information you need if you are taking GCSE resits has been sent to parents.

Animation, Engineering and Spanish will join our existing suite of A levels, BTECs and CTECs to provide our students with even more choices and opportunities beyond S6C.\n\nTopics studied in A Level Animation will include stop motion, rotoscoping, 2D and 3D animation, video production and music video production. The course will develop student’s visual storytelling, character development and editing skills, they will discover important industry techniques and explore modern examples from leading production houses such as Aardman, Studio Ghibli and Pixar.\n\nIn A Level Spanish, students will learn about the culture, history and traditions of Hispanic countries and will develop their knowledge of the Spanish language to enable them to express themselves more accurately, fluently and with more complexity. Languages can be combined with almost any other subject at university and studying an A Level language can lead to a host of employment opportunities such as travel and tourism, translating and journalism.\n\nOur CTEC Extended Certificate in Engineering will look at mathematics and science for engineering, the principles of mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering and will allow students to choose from two optional units such as mechanical design and materials science. The course will allow students to study engineering at university or will encourage the development of design thinking skills that will widen employment opportunities after S6C.\n\nTo find out more, please join us at our Open Evening on Wednesday 11 October at 5.00pm and 6.00pm. To book your place please click here.\n\nIn Sport, the S6C Rugby Academy played their first competitive match and for a new team, the 31–5 win was a triumph! All players demonstrated a great attitude, put in an immense effort and displayed brilliant teamwork. We couldn’t be happier with how the team represented S6C, both during the match and afterwards for the RFC meal.\n\nThe S6C Football Academy had their first loss yesterday but we aren’t despondent because Ben Cooper, Bournemouth coach, was delighted with the quality of football being played. All of our S6C Sports Academies teams have demonstrated tremendous hard work, teamwork and generosity of spirit, all values which we strive to uphold in every aspect of life at S6C.\n\nNext week we have an NHS doctor coming in to deliver a session around careers in the NHS, including a practical skills element. The session is open to all students on all courses who are interested in any career in the NHS. Not a session to be missed!\n\nDates for your diary\n\nSunday 01 October\n\nApplications open for September 2024\n\nMonday 02 October\n\nYear 13 DC6 Assessment Week\n\nFriday 06 October\n\nStaff Training Day – college closed\n\nWednesday 04 October\n\nS6C Football Academy v.

Refreshments will be available.\n\nFriday 22 September 2023\n\nThe rain hasn’t dampened our spirits and this week our Environmental Studies students braved the elements in Studland and Wareham to look at sand dunes and the aquatic environment.\n\nOn Wednesday the S6C Football Academy team played an intense away game against Exeter City. After 45 minutes they were 3-0 down and looking at a heavy defeat but after a much needed team talk and adjustment in tactics the team fought back to a 3-3 draw. Unfortunately with four minutes left Exeter City grabbed a fourth goal to make it 4-3. After a monumental effort to get back into the game this would have been a huge disappointment for our team but with one minute left they mustered one last chance and they took it! 4-4 after being 3-0 down at half time, demonstrating fantastic team spirit and resilience.\n\nIn addition the S6C Rugby Academy team have been continuing their preparations for their forthcoming ‘grudge’ match against Bishops. It will be a huge test but having trained in what can only be described as torrential rain on Wednesday, the team have certainly done all that they can to be ready.\n\nDates For Your Diary\n\nSunday 24 September\n\nGeography Field Trip to Leeson House, Dorset\n\nWednesday 27 September\n\nS6C Football Academy Fixture v.
