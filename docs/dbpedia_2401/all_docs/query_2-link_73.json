        "text": "Program Note by the Directors\n\nJane Davidson\n\nThe Storm and The Old Maid and the Thief\n\nThe Storm was completed after speaking with residents of Creswick, Victoria, whose terrifying experience of storm and flooding in 2022 provoked this reflection on opera as a means of offering testimony to the experience of extreme weather events. The students worked as co-collaborators to generate the work. Creswick residents have been moved and invigorated by the project, and the student group will be performing The Storm again on 6 April 2024 at CresFest 2024.\n\nThe Old Maid and the Thief underscores Italian-American Gian Carlo Menotti’s position as a significant mid-twentieth century opera composer and librettist.\n\nOriginally created at the dawn of World War 2, this production transfers the story to 1960s, where conventions around authority, race, gender and social position were changing.\n\n—\n\nBeverly Blankenship\n\nThe Medium and A Hand of Bridge\n\nThe Medium and Hand of Bridge are two jewels in the canon of short opera.\n\nOur motto for rehearsals was THE SINGING BODY IN MOTION.\n\nThis meant accessing extreme emotions, allowing them to dictate difficult situations and resulting in tragic action for The Medium. A Hand of Bridge on the other hand was all about bottling up these extreme emotions, only allowing them life in the secret thoughts of the four people almost strangled by convention. Singing while moving is a technical challenge. Allowing difficult emotions and ridiculous feelings to the surface is emotionally challenging. It was a real pleasure watching this group of young singers facing these complex issues running with the wild side. The wild side – that is the essence of opera.\n\n—\n\nSpecial Acknowledgements\n\nVocal Area Staff\n\nDr Stephen Grant, Anna Connolly, Linda Barcan\n\nCover and extra technical work\n\nTeresa Ingrilli\n\nCostume and props support:\n\nGeorgia Johnson, Duraan Reid and cast\n\nAssistance with The Medium and A Hand of Bridge:\n\nJessica Gerger, Andrew Robb, and Frances Wood; and for The Old Maid and the Thief: Terance Glasson and Nicholas Beecher."
