        "text": "New Jersey’s colleges and universities offer many summer education programs to help both college and high students boost their college credits, explore new academic areas and get a jump start on their higher education.\n\n“We currently offer roughly 500 courses with a mix of online and on-campus programs that give students a lot of flexibility,” said Dave Naphy, associate director of admissions, Rowan University. “There are many benefits to summer courses. They are an opportunity to take a more challenging class that can be their sole focus. If a student is looking to graduate early, they can knock out an elective or other classes.”\n\nFinancial assistance may also be available for summer programs, Naphy added.\n\nAt Rowan, chemistry is one of the most popular summer offerings, enabling students to take this difficult course without juggling other classes. The university also offers a Pre-college Institute for certain students.\n\n“They learn the ropes of what it’s like to be a college student,’’ Naphy said. “They take two classes during those six weeks so when they enter Rowan in the fall they are already familiar with the campus and have met other students. It’s a program that really prepares them to be successful in college.’’\n\nVisit rowan.edu.\n\nAt Drew University, summer offerings also run the gamut.\n\n“We have a full summer schedule of courses for high school students to get a head start on college credits,” said Colby McCarthy, dean of enrollment management, Drew University. “Current students have the opportunity to pick up another class.”\n\nDrew’s study abroad program gives students a chance to spend three to four weeks in another country, experience another culture and take courses that can bolster their credit count. The coursework coordinates with a country’s culture, such as taking food and farming sustainability classes in Italy or learning about economics in London.\n\n“This is a unique short study abroad program, led by faculty members, and is good for students who may not be able to study abroad for a full semester,’’ McCarthy said. “It’s a great way to explore an academic area while being in another culture.’’\n\nVisit drew.edu.\n\nAt Seton Hall, courses are available to current students and those visiting from other colleges and universities. Popular courses include Digital Art and Design, Sports Management, Biology, Human Anatomy, Catholic Theology, History, Music and Civilizations.\n\n“Our summer academic sessions offer courses and programs for current undergraduate, graduate and high school students that can help them progress toward degree completion or simply enrich their knowledge in an area of interest,” said Mary Kate Naatus, assistant provost and dean of the Division of Continuing and Professional Education.\n\n“Students can select in person, hybrid or remote courses and can enjoy learning from faculty experts in many different fields,” she said. “Summer learning in condensed academic sessions can be especially rewarding and allow for even greater interactions in the classes.”\n\nSeton Hall also offers programs for high school students, including Giant Leap STEM in Weather and Climate Sustainability, Robotics and Electronics, Accounting 101 and Cybersecurity, among others.\n\nVisit shu.edu.\n\nAt Rider University, students are privy to an array of pre-college enrichment programs designed to empower high-schoolers with essential skills and tools necessary to pursue their passions, while immersing themselves in the college campus experience.\n\nParticipants engage in rigorous coursework and gain access to state-of-the-art equipment, facilities, on-campus housing and a range of engaging activities, providing them with a comprehensive exploration of college life at Rider.\n\nSome popular offerings include Game Design Academy, which immerses high school students in digital game development in a professional and creative environment. Through hands-on experience with industry-standard software, participants acquire fundamental skills in digital design and game logic programming. They also gain valuable insights into potential career paths within the field, exploring Rider’s B.A. program in Game and Interactive Media Design.\n\nRider’s Musical Theatre Institute (MTI) nurtures future stars of the performing arts industry through intensive group and private sessions in singing, acting and dancing. Led by esteemed faculty members with extensive experience in Broadway, national tours, television and film, students receive personalized instruction and mentorship.\n\nThe MTI faculty recognize that students have varying levels of natural ability and experience. They are committed to meeting each student “where they are” in their training and helping them cultivate and expand their current abilities.\n\nRider’s Solo Vocal Artist helps young classical singers develop their art alongside the distinguished voice faculty of Rider’s Westminster Choir College. The program provides personalized hands-on instruction for each student, including daily sessions in voice science, body awareness, opera and art song history.\n\nVisit rider.edu.\n\nCounty College of Morris offers a wide range of courses across all academic programs that appeal to current students, visiting students attending four-year institutions, high school students looking to earn college credits before they graduate or students looking for non-credit workforce development programs.\n\nMost academic programs at CCM offer virtual, on campus and hybrid course options. Many of the college’s popular summer courses include IT, health professions and the natural sciences, such as biology and chemistry.\n\nVisit ccm.edu.\n\nAt the New Jersey Institute of Technology, hundreds of courses in a wide range of disciplines are offered between May and August. The undergraduate and graduate-level courses cover everything from environmental engineering, accounting and architecture to emerging academic offerings like ethical hacking, forensic science and artificial intelligence.\n\n“There’s something for everyone,” NJIT Provost John Pelesko said. “Summer Session offers students the opportunity to take advantage of flexible course schedules and formats, including face-to-face, online and hybrid delivery models.”\n\nIn addition, NJIT offers summertime pre-college programs in mathematics, forensic science and engineering designed for high school students and some middle schoolers. These programs aim to spark interest in STEM at an early age, particularly among those from underserved communities in NJIT’s home of Newark. Ideally, they inspire participants to pursue college degrees and ultimately, stimulating and financially rewarding jobs in STEM.\n\nNJIT’s Hillier College of Architecture and Design has summer career exploration programs that enable high school students to work collaboratively in studios and create portfolios. Also, beyond traditional architecture and design, the instruction includes game design and animation.\n\nNJIT’s Martin Tuchman School of Management (MTSM), which recently introduced a concentration in sports data analytics, offers online business data analytics courses in the summer that focus on interpretation and insights, rather than number crunching.\n\n“These programs supply much-needed opportunities for students in the middle of their academic pursuit, adult learners upskilling into higher paying jobs and pre-college students looking for a jump start,” Pelesko said. “Indeed, learning is continuous and all are welcome here.”\n\nVisit njit.edu.\n\nSummer education programs are not just for high school and college students. Located in Sparkill, N.Y., St. Thomas Aquinas College offers STEM camps to students entering grades five through nine in areas like technology, arts and mathematics.\n\nMade possible by the generous support of Orange & Rockland Utilities and Community Offshore Wind, the program includes The Mathematics of Elections in which campers study different voting methods and explore basic game theory and the United State’s electoral system.\n\nAnother popular camp offering is Electronics: Circuits & Usage, which explores the fundamental principles of electricity, basic circuit design and how data science can be used to explore electrical usage.\n\nThe college’s Summer Literacy Program equips students in need of extra literacy support with the skills to be strategic readers and writers. Students work in small groups or individually with certified teachers completing their master’s degrees in literacy or special education and is supervised by the School of Education faculty."
