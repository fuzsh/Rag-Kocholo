        "text": "On Friday the 2nd of November, all students at Beechworth Primary School were lucky enough to have the opportunity to see the Ringwood Secondary College band perform in the Memorial Hall in Beechworth. With about 60 students touring, from Years 7 to Year 10, the band was very impressive, taking up both the stage and the space in front of it, where they demonstrated a range of instruments for the students from the known such as trumpets, drums, violins and clarinets, to some lesser known instruments like the tuba and the double bass (Oh, and parents, think very carefully if\n\nRead More\n\nOn Monday 1st October Miss Dunstan stood up in front of the school to talk about Walk to School. Miss Dunstan encouraged everyone to walk, ride or scoot to school. If you couldn’t walk to school Miss Dunstan encouraged them to walk to walk to the bus stop or even simple to just walk around the school during recess. In every classroom there is a piece of paper with everyone’s name in that class. Everyday each student had to tick off whether they walked, rode or scootered to school on that day, they had to do that every day of\n\nRead More\n\nThis Friday 26 October we participated in ‘A Day for Daniel’ activities across the school. Students dressed in RED for the day. A Day for Daniel is Australia’s largest child safety and education awareness day. Students in Foundation to Year 2 participated in a special TV lesson screened to schools across Australia and completed a ‘My Safety Network’ activity thinking about five people they who can help them out in situations when they feel unsafe. Students in other year levels engaged in a range of activities with resources developed by the Morcombe Foundation. The Day for Daniel work supports the\n\nRead More\n\nUsing Magiclay in the Artroom During Term Three we experimented with a product called ‘Magiclay’, a soft dough like product that dries to a light foam consistency.

The group started working in term three, preparing for their first Sausage Sizzle, which is taking place on Friday the 21st of September.

Not deterred by the damp weather, Dad’s came in there droves to indulge in freshly cooked egg & bacon rolls prepared by staff and the delicious coffees and hot chocolates on offer courtesy of Blynzz Coffee Roasters. Father’s & student’s had the opportunity to mark the occasion by grabbing a photo in the Father’s Day photo booth with a steady stream of selfies and smiles captured throughout the morning. This year, in addition to celebrating Father’s\n\nRead More\n\nDuring the last 6 weeks the boys from Grades three and four have been participating in the Rock and Water Program. Here the boys were taught about knowing when to adopt a Rock attitude which is to stand up and protect what you truly believe in and when to adopt a Water attitude, which is knowing what to let go of those things which aren’t worth fighting for and so avoiding any potential conflict. These concepts were taught through a series of games which required the boys to determine which attitude to use for each of the games. Sometimes Rock\n\nRead More\n\nThe first Friday back in Term 3, saw the senior students off to Wodonga to participate in the Winter Sports Carnival. This is an annual event which the students always look forward to. This year we entered teams in AFL, Netball, Hockey, Soccer and Tee-ball. The students and their teachers spent several hours practising the skills needed and learning the rules for their respective games. Having the carnival the first week back was a bit tricky but we managed to get everything organised and the students got a little bit of practise in before the Friday event. The weather was\n\nRead More\n\nWe recently got some new equipment to use in the Senior art classes. Some of the 5/6 students were lucky enough to experiment with the wood burning tools this week. They found that they aren’t as easy to use as you would think!! As we know practising and patience help us to improve our skills and mastering this technique will require a lot of both. We also revisited the basic skills of measuring, cutting and gluing last week to remind us that to learn new techniques we need to have a sound skill set to begin with.\n\nRead More\n\nA buzz of excitement filled the Foundation O’Brien and Foundation/One Weideman classrooms on Friday morning the 3rd August as our Foundation students got ready to celebrate their 100th day at school. In the week building up to this special day, we asked all the Foundation students to collect 100 small objects of their choice and to bring it to school ready for our special day. Everyone showed great creativity in their choice of objects and we saw everything from balloons to pasta.
