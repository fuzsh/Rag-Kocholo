        "text": "GARDNER — Hundreds of area students who participate in Mount Wachusett Community College’s college access programs were recently recognized during two recent year-end events. High school graduates who have participated in programs administered by the college’s Division of Access & Transition were recognized during an awards ceremony and brunch in May at the Courtyard Marriott in Fitchburg. Natascha Saunders, an inspirational career coach and CEO of The Youth Career Coach Inc., delivered the keynote address to approximately 300 students and family members at the event. The event celebrated the achievements of high school seniors from Fitchburg, Leominster, Gardner, Athol and Murdock high schools who are completing their participation with MWCC’s Educational Talent Search and Upward Bound Math Science TRIO programs and the Gateway to College program. Scholarships were presented to 14 students who will be pursuing degrees at MWCC or other private and public colleges and universities. Scholarship recipients were: Eddy Billiel, Athol High School; Wyljenny Vazquez Torres, Gardner High School; Stacie Bishop of Phillipston, Gateway to College; Lydia Yohannes, Leominster High School; Kayla Halfrey, Monty Tech; Nick Ringwood, Murdock Middle/High School; and Jeffrey Duenas, Sherey Hernandez, Stephen Ngah, Mollie Reynolds, Luis Cerrillos, Anthony Altieri and Chao Yang of Fitchburg High School. In addition, more than 150 area middle school students who participate in MWCC’s Educational Talent Search program took part in the annual Write On! competition this year. Students from Gardner Middle School, Murdock Middle/High School in Winchendon, Longsjo and Memorial middle schools in Fitchburg and Sky View and Samoset middle schools in Leominster submitted artwork, short stories and poetry in the competition. The event culminated with a half-day conference, writing and art workshops, luncheon and awards presentation at MWCC’s Gardner campus. Barnes & Noble gift certificates were awarded to competition winners, including $100 certificates to three grand prize winners and $25 certificates to first, second and third-prize winners in each category from each participating school. Each student also received a booklet containing this year’s competition entries. Area students receiving grand prize awards were: Rachel Dickens of Murdock Middle/High School in Winchendon in the poetry category; Kyrah Altman of Sky View Middle School in Leominster in the short story category; and Eric Paul of Gardner Middle School, in the art category. MWCC’s Division of Access & Transition administers a number of grant-funded programs that provide middle school, high school, and adult students with an array of academic, college, and career awareness services including MCAS remediation, academic and career counseling, tutorials, workshops, and activities."
