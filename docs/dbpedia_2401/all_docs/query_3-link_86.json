        "text": "I was on the bus from Montclair to New York City in late 2019, and I saw someone familiar board. Wow, it’s Priscilla Lopez, the multitalented Tony Award-winning actress. She’s a legend! She even has a caricature on the wall at Sardi’s Restaurant. I didn’t know she lived in Montclair. I first saw her on Broadway in 1974 in “Pippin” and many times since then. She still had the same lovely, alert face and expressive brown eyes. She was in the cast of “Grand Horizon” with Jane Alexander and James Cromwell, scheduled to open in January 2020 at the Hayes Theatre. I saw her a few more times in the afternoons when the play was in rehearsal and some evenings around 10 p.m. when the performance was done. Every time I saw Lopez on the bus, it summoned fond memories of seeing her onstage. As the pandemic took hold, the play closed, and the buses stopped running.\n\nThat bus is a lifeline for people in the entertainment industry who live in Montclair. You could come from a standing ovation, or an awards show dressed in your best, but there’s that frantic sprint to Port Authority so you don’t miss the last bus at 12:30 a.m.; otherwise, you wind up a winded pumpkin faced with a pricey Uber ride back home to Paradise. Why go through all that? Because once the bus gets off Route 3 and heads into Montclair, you breathe a sigh of relief ⁠— you’re almost home. Montclair’s hushed, tree-lined streets soothe you, and when you step off the bus, you inhale its fragrant air. The ride was worth it. You can have your cake and eat it, too, but you sometimes have to run for it. Just ask Lopez.\n\nBut let’s go back to the beginning. Lopez was born in the South Bronx in her grandfather’s house, the first of her close Puerto Rican family to be born stateside. Her mother had waited a little too long to get to the hospital, so when her grandfather went to get a taxi, her grandmother called out the window, “Forget about it, she’s here!”\n\nLopez knew she wanted to be a performer. Encouraged by her mother, she took every class she could. Not yet a teenager, she and her older brother were extras in the original film version of “West Side Story,” where she learned about Manhattan’s High School of Performing Arts, (of “Fame” fame) from the film’s dancers. She got into the drama program, though she wanted to be a dancer and took dance classes after school three days a week. At Performing Arts, she honed her natural talents, though she did have a memorably bumpy time in an acting class — but more about that later.\n\nWhen she was 16, she spent the summer performing at St. John Terrell’s Music Circus in Lambertville, at the time one of the most renowned summer theaters in the country. “It was a true tent, and we did eight shows a week,” she said. After graduation from the High School of Performing Arts when other students went off to colleges with theater programs, she thought, “Why go to Oshkosh? Broadway is a block away.” With her natural talent, drive and training, which included knowing how to audition (she started auditioning at age 13), she landed her first Broadway show, the legendary flop “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” with Mary Tyler Moore and Richard Chamberlain. Then came another flop, “Her First Roman,” about Caesar and Cleopatra.\n\nShe was the understudy for Donna McKechnie and replaced her in the original production of Stephen Sondheim’s “Company” in 1970, where she made an impression on Michael Bennett, who did its musical staging. It’s also where she met her husband, Vincent Fanuele, a musician and conductor.\n\nNext, she stepped into the original production of “Pippin,” which featured Ben Vereen and John Rubinstein in the title role. She played Pippin’s vampy, bumping and grinding young stepmother. Bob Fosse directed and choreographed the musical and was in the back of the theater when Priscilla auditioned. “Now that’s what I call a well-prepared audition,” he said. (In the 2014 revival of “Pippin,” she was reunited with John Rubinstein when he took over the role of Charlemagne and Priscilla took over the role of Pippin’s grandmother.)\n\nTwo years later after “Pippin,” Bennett invited her to participate in a series of tape-recorded, group therapy-style sessions in which chorus boys and girls, aka “gypsies,” told their stories and shared their dreams and frustrations. “A Chorus Line” emerged from these sessions in 1975, and Lopez created the character of Diana Morales, based on herself. She was hailed as an overnight success, “but the truth is that I’d already been working for 11 years.”\n\n“A Chorus Line” had a seismic effect on New York theater and its performers, who remain connected to this day. Lopez was nominated for a Tony Award, as was her co-star and dear friend, Kelly Bishop, who won that year. They are still BFFs. Bishop later played Jennifer Grey’s mother in “Dirty Dancing.”\n\nThat bumpy time in acting class wound up as the basis for her standout number, “Nothing,” in “A Chorus Line.” Asked to improv that she was “on a bobsled, and it’s snowing out and it’s cold,” she tried but she felt, well, nothing. “They don’t have bobsleds in San Juan.”\n\nHer other big number in “A Chorus Line” was that showstopping anthem of resilience (and a karaoke staple), “What I Did for Love.”\n\nThose two numbers stood out for me when I saw the show in 1975, as they did for John Leguizamo. (I was the publicist on his first hit show, “Mambo Mouth.”)\n\n“The first Broadway show I ever saw was ‘A Chorus Line,’ ” Leguizamo said. “There was this Latin person, Priscilla Lopez, and she rocked my world. I knew she was talking to me and only me. I knew that was a sign that I could make it.”\n\nWith that kind of success, many performers head to LA to capitalize on their notoriety and get film and television work. Some would never be heard from again. Just like after high school when she chose Broadway over Oshkosh, Priscilla waited until “A Chorus Line” went to LA, got the town’s attention and then started doing television. She played a liberal nun in a Norman Lear sitcom, “In the Beginning,” appeared in the hit TV drama “Family,” did more series work and stayed for three years.\n\nTommy Tune wanted her for the 1980 Broadway production of “A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine,” in which she played dual roles: a theater usher and Harpo Marx. They offered her the role of the ingenue, but she wanted to play Harpo and steeped herself in the Marx Brothers. She developed a face she called the “Gookie,” based on Harpo’s classic expression: crossed eyes, puckered cheeks, pursed lips. She nailed it (“Miss Lopez is a doll of a Harpo,” The New York Times said) and won the Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.\n\nWhen Tune asked if she wanted to be his assistant on the smash musical “Nine” because “he liked the way my brain worked. I said, ‘YES!’ ”\n\n“It was a great experience because I learned how small the actor’s role is.” And one of the takeaways was seeing auditions from a different angle. Now on the other side of the table, she sat through five weeks of them and sobbed for the first two weeks. “I felt like I was auditioning with them. I felt every anxiety, every apology, every flawed moment,” she said. “They don’t realize the production wants to find the right person for the part, and they’re hoping it’s you.” She would sometimes step in for vacationing Liliane Montevecchi.\n\nLopez starred in Nilo Cruz’s Pulitzer prize-winning drama “Anna of the Tropics” in 2003, a play that is close to her heart, and in Cruz’s next play, “The Beauty of the Father,” in 2006. She also starred in the off-Broadway and Broadway productions of fellow Puerto Rican Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “In the Heights.” She would often grab his face and say, “I’m so proud of you!” When the show first opened, she didn’t have a song of her own, but Miranda and his team were so impressed with her work that they gave her a number. Unfortunately, her character didn’t make it into the movie version, but she did get her Sardi’s caricature. You can see her onscreen in the 2000 comedy, “Maid in Manhattan,” as Jennifer Lopez’s supportive mother and as Mila Kunis’ mother in the 2004 film version of the off-Broadway hit “Tony n’ Tina’s Wedding.” (Its church scenes were filmed in Montclair.) She played six characters in “Class Mothers ’68” off Broadway and at Luna Stage when it was in Montclair. This one-woman play was written specifically for her by Eric Weinberger.\n\nWhen she was in her 30s, Lopez took a break from show business. “I had tasted all aspects of the business,” she said. “So, I decided it was time to have children with my husband. I’m so happy I did. As a performer, it can get frustrating when you’re not working. That’s why it’s so important to have a life — to be a sister, a wife, a mother, a daughter, a colleague, a friend.”\n\nTheir children, Alex, who is in the automotive field, and Gabriella, an actress, were born in LA, moved back to New York City, and, in 1991, the family moved to Montclair, when Alex was in fourth grade. He went to Montclair High, as did Gabriella until she switched to Manhattan’s La Guardia High, the Performing Arts School of this generation. Alex is married with two young children, making Priscilla a proud grandmother.\n\nWhy Montclair? “We had family here and they kept asking us to come out, so we did. It’s a beautiful town with beautiful homes. There’s a sense of order to it.”\n\nWhat’s her favorite place in town? “My backyard.”\n\nShe recently appeared in the revival of the Thornton Wilder classic “The Skin of Our Teeth” at Lincoln Center (her first time performing there). The bus is still on a limited schedule, so, for this show, Priscilla drove back and forth to work through dense traffic both ways. Her most recent EZ pass statement was through the roof. She admits to being an aggressive driver, and when Kelly Bishop suggested for her next show the production send a car for her — you know, the star treatment — she nixed it. No one drives fast enough for her.\n\nI saw “The Skin of Our Teeth” just before it closed and was thrilled to see Lopez take the stage in the second act as Esmeralda, the fortuneteller who works the boardwalk in Atlantic City. Dressed in a Miss Havisham white dress, with blazing red hair and 9-inch nails, she calls out to passersby, “Cirrhosis of the liver! Kidney disease!” and acts as a one-woman Greek chorus to the onstage goings on. With her arms outstretched, she regally, commandingly brings down the curtain in the second act. That’s trouping. Now that the show has closed, Lopez is looking forward to peaceful days, catching up on home projects and going to London to visit her daughter. She loves the writer Jonathan Franzen and plans to read his novel “Crossroads.” Lopez was excited by the news of a large film studio scheduled to be built in Newark and hopes to do a film right here in New Jersey.\n\nI looked at her bio in Playbill.
