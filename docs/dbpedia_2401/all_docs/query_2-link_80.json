        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence is honoring five outstanding Oklahoma public school educators as recipients of its 2024 Medal for Excellence Awards.\n\nThe 2024 Medal for Excellence honorees are:\n\nElementary Teaching: Jennifer Goldner, fifth grade science teacher at Jay Upper Elementary School\n\nSecondary Teaching: Jill Andrews, English language arts teacher at Claremore High School\n\nAdministration: Kevin Hime, superintendent of Lawton Public Schools\n\nRegional University & Community College Teaching: Sapna Das-Bradoo, professor of biology and interim chair of the Department of Natural Sciences at Northeastern State University Broken Arrow\n\nResearch University Teaching: Greg Burge, economics professor and department chair at the University of Oklahoma in Norman\n\n“Each of these public school educators has made an indelible impact on their students, school and community,” said Elizabeth Inbody, OFE executive director. “We are honored to make them the recipients of the Medal for Excellence, one of the state’s most prestigious teaching awards. We hope that their passion and innovation will inspire and encourage others in their support of public education.”\n\nThe recipients will be honored at OFE’s 38th annual Academic Awards Celebration on Saturday, May 4, at the Embassy Suites Hotel & Conference Center in Norman. Each educator will receive a $5,000 cash prize and an etched glass “Roots and Wings” sculpture.\n\nThe celebration is open to the public and will also honor 100 Oklahoma public high school seniors as Academic All-Staters and three Oklahoma public school foundations with Outstanding Program Awards. Admission costs $65 and includes dinner. To learn more about the event or register to attend, visit OFE.org.\n\nThrough its flagship Academic Awards Program, the foundation presents $175,000 annually to honor outstanding public school students and educators.\n\nMore information about the 2024 Medal for Excellence recipients\n\nJennifer Goldner, Jay Public Schools\n\nJennifer Goldner, recipient of the Medal for Excellence in Elementary Teaching, teaches fifth grade science at Jay Upper Elementary School.\n\nGoldner grew up in the Jay area and has taught at the school since 1998, but she’s traveled many miles to learn and share her knowledge. She’s attended the Honeywell Educators at Space Academy and Advanced Space Academy, and she studied aboard the Oregon II as a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Teacher at Sea.\n\nFrom 2014-17, she gave presentations across the country as the United States Honeywell Space Academy Ambassador. She’s now a consultant for the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation in support of the Teacher at Sea Program. Goldner has trained teachers in Ecuador and Belize, and she’s instructed educators in the Great Expectations professional development program for more than 20 years.\n\nIn her classroom, Goldner focuses on meeting each student’s learning style.\n\n“In my teaching career I have had all these things in my classroom in an effort to help different students learn to the best of their abilities: a treadmill, a stationary bicycle, balance boards, bouncy balls, fidgets, shades over the lights and a microphone system,” Goldner said. “I am willing and excited to try anything if it will help a student learn.”\n\nShe attributes much of her success to the power of a question.\n\n“So how do I get to know each and every one of my students?” Goldner said. “The answer is simple: I ask them questions and lots of them. This year I have 111 students, so the challenge is daunting for me, but I take it seriously.”\n\nFormer student Gavin Raye Tate says Goldner sparked her interest in pursuing a career in science after she graduates.\n\n“In Ms. Goldner’s class, I found my love for science,” Tate said. “It was her passion that inspired me to dig deeper into the fundamental questions of why things happen the way they do, which is, in my opinion, science. I love participating in lab experiments and collecting data, and it was Ms. Goldner who taught me how to do those things.”\n\nJill Andrews, Claremore Public Schools\n\nJill Andrews, English language arts teacher at Claremore High School, is the recipient of the Medal for Excellence in Secondary Teaching.\n\nAndrews says she wants her students to “see, hear, feel, taste, and smell the literature.”\n\nIt isn’t unusual to find Andrews’ high school students building dioramas with Play-Doh, drinking nonalcoholic mead as they study “Beowulf,” or presenting self-designed coats of arms while dressed as a “Canterbury Tales” character.\n\n“British literature has become my passion; I spend many hours outside the school day researching the literature, language, culture, music, and history of life in Great Britain because it is important to me to present a well-rounded glimpse into the British literature world for my students,” Andrews said.\n\nAndrews has been voted favorite teacher by six of Claremore’s senior classes and earned District Teacher of the Year honors for 2016-2017. She serves as sponsor for two student support groups and is assistant coach for the academic bowl team. Andrews volunteers in the community as a youth soccer and softball coach, and she has organized a student voter registration drive.\n\nFormer student Zachary Noland said Andrews “champions the idea that education is more than learning what is written in textbooks: it is about discovering what makes someone Oklahoman.”\n\nNoland now teaches alongside Andrews.\n\n“Years later, I found my own approach to teaching is an emulation of her techniques,” Noland said. “She actively engages her students through group discussions, such as Socratic seminars; research projects that foster creativity, public speaking skills, and work ethic; and assigns thrilling novels that challenge the essence of our humanity.”\n\nAndrews, a Claremore native and University of Oklahoma graduate, credits the influence of her ninth-grade art teacher, Linda Scudder.\n\n“The inspiration Mrs. Scudder was to me is what I have yearned to be for others,” Andrews said. “She demonstrated acceptance and provided a safe place to create art; she allowed me to express myself both visually and linguistically. Because I knew she cared, I willingly took risks in her class. I willingly stretched my mind beyond what I ever thought I could achieve.\n\n“Just as I took intellectual risks in Mrs. Scudder’s class, my students learn that my class is a safe place to take risks, to stretch their intellectual ability.”\n\nKevin Hime, Lawton Public Schools\n\nLawton superintendent Kevin Hime is the recipient of the Medal for Excellence in Elementary/Secondary School Administration.\n\nSince his arrival in December 2019, Hime’s innovative programs have transformed Lawton Public Schools.\n\n“From the moment I met him, I knew amazing things were going to happen for our district, and he would make long-lasting impacts for our community,” said Lynn Cordes, the district’s executive director of communications. “I could not have imagined the leaps and bounds we have made since then!”\n\nHime and his staff worked with Great Plains Technology Center and Cameron University to open the Life Ready Center. The LRC, which Hime calls a “game-changer,” provides high school students access to programs and concurrent classes previously available at only one of the district’s campuses.\n\nHime started the Lawton Technical Applications Program, which provides hands-on, career-oriented classes to students in grades 7 through 10. Hime also implemented a 5,000-student virtual school, and he established a partnership in which the Lawton Public School Foundation covers funding for college tuition, books and fees for students while they’re enrolled at LPS.\n\n“To help our students achieve success, we must be willing to think outside of the box and provide opportunities to achieve what I call one of the 3E’s: enrolled, enlisted, or employed,” Hime said. “If these opportunities do not currently exist, we cannot be afraid to step up and create them ourselves.”\n\nHe installed Makerspaces on all 18 elementary campuses. In these collaborative spaces, students work with a certified teacher to explore and create using problem-solving strategies and STEM practices.\n\nHime was the 2022 State Superintendent of the Year and the Oklahoma School Public Relations Association’s 2021-22 Superintendent of the Year. He currently serves as president for the Oklahoma Association of School Administrators and the United Suburban School Association.\n\nAn Idabel native, Hime received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant. He started his career as a U.S. history teacher and coach, making stops at Hugo, Woodward and Idabel. Before arriving in Lawton, he served as superintendent at Woodland and Clinton.\n\nSince 2020, Hime has hosted his “Time with Hime” podcast to communicate with school staff, families and stakeholders more effectively. He also organized and hosted the popular weekly #oklaed chat on Twitter (now known as X).\n\n“To foster a sense of unity, it is vital for me, my staff, families, and stakeholders of our community to work together as a team,” Hime said. “This can only be done with effective and purposeful communication.”\n\nDr. Sapna Das-Bradoo, Northeastern State University Broken Arrow\n\nDr. Sapna Das-Bradoo, a biology professor at Northeastern State University Broken Arrow, is the recipient of the Medal for Excellence in Teaching at a Regional University/Community College.\n\nDas-Bradoo has taught at NSU Broken Arrow since 2011 and is serving as interim chair of the Department of Natural Sciences. Das-Bradoo has worked to develop a student-focused, externally funded research program and has obtained more than $1.1 million in funding for the university.\n\nDas-Bradoo credits her research mentor at her alma mater, the University of Delhi in India, for helping her realize her passion for research and giving her the confidence to continue her educational career.\n\n“The excitement of unraveling scientific mysteries, troubleshooting, and scientific discussions with my research mentor shaped my future career in research,” Das-Bradoo said. “I have actively engaged in undergraduate research since my first day at NSU and have served as a research mentor for 60 undergraduate and 4 graduate students.”\n\nStudents and colleagues speak not just of Das-Bradoo’s gift for illustrating complex ideas and relating science to everyday life but also of how invested she is in students’ success. She’s received several student-nominated awards and was honored as Faculty Mentor of the Year for the 2021-22 school year.\n\n“Dr. Das-Bradoo always made or found time for us as her students,” said former student Bryan Wright, who describes her as one of the most influential figures in his life. “Her office may not have been labeled ‘counselor,’ but she definitely was one.”\n\nJessica Martin, interim dean for NSU’s Gregg Wadley College of Science and Health Professions, noted that Das-Bradoo often incorporates advances that haven’t yet made it into textbooks, sparking interest with topics like gene editing and sequencing and the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\n“Constantly, she looks for ways to engage students, pondering how to challenge students without overwhelming,” former student Michael P. Smith said. “She is often worried about the growth of the entire student body. She is concerned. She cares.”\n\nDas-Bradoo started a science seminar series that highlights cutting-edge research, and she recently launched a career seminar series that allows students to learn from NSU alumni.\n\n“I strongly believe in these words from Vitruvius, a Roman architect and engineer: ‘All the gifts which fortune bestows she can easily take away; but education, when combined with intelligence, never fails, but abides steadily on to the very end of life,’” Das-Bradoo said.\n\nDr. Greg Burge, University of Oklahoma\n\nDr. Greg Burge, recipient of the Medal for Excellence in Teaching at a Research University, is an economics professor who chairs the University of Oklahoma’s economics department. The Florida State University alumnus has taught at OU since 2006.\n\nIn 2018, Burge received OU’s General Education Teaching Award, which recognizes an educator whose teaching is considered to have contributed most to the university-wide general education program. Burge says he takes great pride in that award because it “connects directly to OU’s goals related to improving student success and retention.”\n\n“Dr. Burge’s personal touch and sustained engagement work miracles,” said colleague Qihong Liu, who noted that rates of student failure — measured by the number of D’s and F’s — fell by more than half during the first year Burge started teaching OU’s Principles of Macroeconomics introductory course.\n\nFormer students speak of Burge’s passion for teaching and kindness. Burge worked out a deal with a textbook manufacturer so that he can give students a textbook free if they approach him about a financial hardship.\n\n“While this situation occurs only a handful of times each year, on many occasions I’ve seen tears in students’ eyes after they learn I’ve arranged this deal with the publisher,” Burge said. “My goal is that those students would feel just as supported in their educational journey as other students with access to more resources.”\n\nBurge developed and led the Economics in London program, the economics department’s first study abroad program in many years. Burge worked hard to build a strong program that remained affordable for students. In 2017, OU’s Dodge Family College of Arts & Sciences named Economics in London its program of the year.\n\nFormer student Leah A. Pomerantz said Burge went out of his way to make students comfortable with life in a foreign country, planning activities for them and taking them out to dinner.\n\nIn 2023, Burge chaired the local organizing committee for the prestigious Chinese Economists Society North American Conference. The event brought more than 100 scholars to campus and provided students with a valuable educational opportunity, Liu said.\n\nBurge counts among his most prized possessions the more than 100 handwritten letters of thanks former students have sent him.\n\n“I believe educators can tap into something very powerful when they truly care about their students’ goals,” Burge said.\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY — Public school foundation programs in Edmond, Tulsa and Cheyenne have been selected as recipients of the 2024 Outstanding Program Awards for Oklahoma School Foundations, which are presented by the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence and its Oklahoma School Foundations Network.\n\nThe awards recognize innovative programs sponsored or administered by public school foundations in Oklahoma. The winning programs, selected for their impact on their school and community, are the Student Ambassador Program, sponsored by the Edmond Public Schools Foundation; Cheyenne Honors Night, sponsored by the Cheyenne Education Foundation; and the Healthy Thriving Schools Initiative, sponsored by the Foundation for Tulsa Schools.\n\nEach program will receive a plaque and a monetary award of $1,000. They will be honored at OFE’s Academic Awards Celebration on May 4 at Embassy Suites Hotel & Conference Center in Norman.\n\n“Each year, we are amazed at the creativity Oklahoma’s public school foundations show in building programs that deeply impact their schools and communities,” said OFE Executive Director Elizabeth Inbody. “With these awards, we not only honor these impactful programs but also provide a platform for sharing their successes in hopes of inspiring other school foundations to create similarly meaningful programs.”\n\nThe Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence is a statewide nonprofit that recognizes and encourages excellence in Oklahoma’s public schools. The foundation’s Oklahoma School Foundations Network was created to support new and established school foundations across the state. To learn more, visit OFE.org.\n\nStudent Ambassador Program, Edmond Public Schools Foundation\n\nThe Student Ambassador Program builds advocates for public education, cultivates leaders within the school district and fosters philanthropic endeavors for meaningful impact. High school students from Edmond Public Schools actively participate in monthly meetings where they engage with district, community and state leaders. These students take part in various committees and events, such as speaking at public gatherings, organizing fundraisers, conducting food drives, volunteering in schools and advocating for public education on social media. The program also includes the election of officers from each high school and encourages collaboration among students across different schools through committees focused on philanthropy, advocacy and leadership.\n\n“This recognition celebrates the impactful contributions of high school students to public education through leadership, advocacy and philanthropy, reaffirming that their efforts are truly making a difference,” said Deanna Boston, CEO of the Edmond Public Schools Foundation. “Thank you for helping us mentor the future leaders of public education in our state.”\n\nOver the past four years, the program’s meetings have featured guest speakers who provide insights into the Edmond Public Schools Foundation’s strategic focus areas. Among these speakers have been prominent leaders such as the Oklahoma State Superintendent of Education, the Edmond Public Schools Superintendent, the Edmond mayor and various educators and leaders. The primary goal is to equip students with the skills to communicate effectively in the community about public education and inspire them to give back.\n\nCheyenne Honors Night, Cheyenne Educational Foundation\n\nSince 2006, Cheyenne junior high and high school students who excel academically have been celebrated at Cheyenne Honors Night. Approximately 50 students are honored each year with recognition and a prize, and seniors recognize their most influential teacher. Honors Night is now an honored tradition and has grown to include the National Honor Society Induction ceremony.\n\n“The program serves one purpose: to show appreciation of and to give recognition to the students who have excelled academically, who otherwise may go unnoticed during the spring semester awards programs and banquet season,” said foundation board member Dianna Butler, a retired educator and longtime employee of Cheyenne High School. “This program serves as a venue to encourage students in the academic arena and challenges them to continue their diligent efforts for academic excellence.”\n\nAlong with their public recognition, honorees receive “Bear Bucks” to be used at many Cheyenne businesses. These awards encourage students to academic success and boost community involvement in Cheyenne students’ continued academic achievement.\n\nHealthy Thriving Schools Initiative, Foundation for Tulsa Schools\n\nThe Healthy Thriving Schools Initiative, launched in 2022, is funded and supported through the Foundation for Tulsa Schools and executed by Tulsa Public Schools’ Student and Family Support Services team. This initiative supports staff and resources for implementation of best-practice-model mental health services. The initiative allows TPS to create a district-wide framework to promote the whole child by elevating mental health as a district operational priority, strengthening the district’s social, emotional and mental health foundation and developing the leadership capacity and infrastructure needed to implement a multi-tiered support system.\n\n“As mental health challenges become more prevalent in schools throughout the country, we are very thankful to the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence for recognizing the collaborative work taking place at Tulsa Public Schools to provide the support our students need to be successful, both inside and outside the classroom,” said Moises Echeverria, president and CEO of the Foundation for Tulsa Schools.\n\nThe initiative allows for the creation of a coordinated effort by the district to use data on student’s behavioral health or social and emotional needs to identify and implement appropriate interventions and to engage community partners in delivering appropriate evidence-based interventions.\n\nThe initiative created the groundwork to allow the district to receive a $9 million grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The five-year grant will allow TPS to further develop a sustainable infrastructure of school-based mental health programs and services.\n\nThe Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence, a nonprofit that recognizes and encourages excellence in Oklahoma’s public schools, has added five members to its Board of Trustees.\n\nAppointed to serve three-year terms are Shoney Blake, counsel at Pipestem Law, Tulsa; Patsy Mann, retired educator, Checotah; Laura Reed, retired educator, Foraker; Leonelle E. Thompson, manager of Early Career Development at Williams, Tulsa; and Dr. Melissa Woolridge, principal of Booker T. Washington High School, Tulsa.\n\n“The foundation is truly honored to welcome this group of incredible community leaders to our board,” said Elizabeth Inbody, executive director of the foundation. “Their knowledge and enthusiasm will be invaluable to us, and we look forward to collaborating with them.”\n\nOne of the keys to the foundation’s success is the leadership of its 140 trustees. These leaders in business, education and public service represent every region of the state and help promote the foundation’s mission and its programs.\n\nThe Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence was founded in 1985 by then U.S. Sen. David L. Boren to strengthen support for public education in Oklahoma. Through its flagship Academic Awards Program, the foundation presents $175,000 annually to honor outstanding public school students and educators. The foundation’s Oklahoma School Foundations Network provides free training, resources and networking opportunities to new and established school foundations.\n\nAmong its other initiatives, the foundation coordinates a summer fellowship program to send Oklahoma fifth- and eighth-grade teachers to the Colonial Williamsburg Teacher Institute.

Bailey Norwood, professor of agribusiness, Oklahoma State University, STILLWATER, Research University Teaching\n\n“The Oklahoma Medal for Excellence is one of our state’s most prestigious educator awards and recognizes public school educators for their passion and innovation, their commitment to professional development, and their extraordinary impact on student learning,” said Elizabeth Inbody, executive director of the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence, a nonprofit that recognizes and encourages academic excellence in Oklahoma’s public schools. “By honoring these exceptional educators, we are sending a message that we value excellence in public schools and the professionals who have given so much of themselves to enrich the lives of our children.”\n\nThe awards will be presented at the foundation’s 37th Academic Awards Celebration on May 20, 2023, at the Cox Business Convention Center in Tulsa. Each of the five honorees will receive a $5,000 cash prize and a glass “Roots and Wings” sculpture, designed by the late Oklahoma artist Ron Roberts and produced by Artistic Glass Studio of Edmond.\n\nBarbie Jackson, recipient of the Oklahoma Medal for Excellence in Elementary Teaching, teaches STEAM – Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math – for kindergarten through fifth-grade students at Limestone Technology Academy in Sand Springs. Jackson is passionate about providing students with creative, hands-on learning experiences that go beyond curriculum standards and engage them in solving real-world problems.\n\n“I focus not only on academics, but also on those soft skills needed to be successful in life,” Jackson said. “Students practice those skills when they are able to communicate, present, create, make mistakes, recover from those mistakes, try something different, and think critically about what they need to do next.”\n\nIn Jackson’s STEAM Lab, students use the engineering design process in the Maker Space – an area filled with household items, from paper towel tubes and crafting sticks to string and tape – to create prototypes to solve problems. Jackson has also set up a “Breaker Space” with a work bench and hand tools, where students learn to take apart and repair equipment. In addition, Jackson teaches a schoolwide Science of Flight curriculum, engaging students in creative projects involving flying insects, hot air balloons, kites, airplanes, parachutes and 3-D printed rockets.\n\nAmong Jackson’s students’ favorite projects is the Monarch Butterfly WayStation, where students help maintain a butterfly garden and then move caterpillars into the STEAM Lab, where they can observe their metamorphosis. In 2022, students tagged and released 52 monarch butterflies and were able to track their migration.\n\nThe learning continues after school with three STEM clubs sponsored by Jackson. Drone Club members code and pilot drones through student-designed obstacle courses, while the Brick Buddies collaborate on building a LEGO City. In her Girls Who Code Club, Jackson seeks to close the race and gender gap in STEM fields by providing hands-on computer science projects for girls.\n\n“Mrs. Jackson challenged my daughter to use critical thinking skills and helped her develop perseverance when things didn’t work perfectly the first time.,” said Mandi Cloud, a parent and colleague. “My daughter has carried these skills with her to middle school, where science and math are her favorite subjects.”\n\nJackson said the future of STEM occupations ranges from what exists now to jobs yet to be discovered. “I want my students to be ready in either case. Early STEM exposure is the key.”\n\nJason Paris, recipient of the Medal for Excellence in Secondary Teaching, teaches fine arts at Cherokee Middle and High School, a rural northern Oklahoma school serving just over 200 students. A successful playwright with a graduate degree from New York University’s Directing Educational Theater program, the Oklahoma native has found his true calling as an arts teacher and mentor to students in Cherokee.\n\n“I discovered an incredible sense of purpose in building a speech, debate and theater program where one no longer existed,” he said, noting that the program grew from an enrollment of three students when he started to 53 today. Paris also expanded his instruction to include film and media production, studio art and vocal music. In any given hour, one can find his students editing a film for a local business, learning music for a community service project, creating visual arts from Paris’s online art lessons, or reading speech and debate materials.\n\n“Students learn so much more than just techniques from him,” said colleague Michelle Baldwin. “He helps students see how important art is and what place it has in their lives. More importantly, students learn how to see themselves in the world through the art they experience and create.”\n\nParis has an innate ability to see talent and potential in students and draw it out of them, Baldwin added. He has led students to numerous state championships during his tenure and provided unique opportunities for them to showcase their talents in the community and beyond. Last year, Paris raised funds to take current and former students to Red River, N.M., to perform their show “The One-Act Play that Goes Wrong.”\n\nIn a time when young people face increasing rates of depression and apathy, Paris has found that his most critical role right now is to be a caring adult in his students’ lives. “They need guides who show them that, for all the challenges, all the hardships, all the really bad days, life remains full of joy, beauty, wonder and magic.\n\n“Being an effective educator means that everything I do should provide young people with appreciation for all that is good in the world and as many tools as I can provide them to save it,” Paris said. “The best way I know how to achieve that, frankly, is to turn them into artists.”\n\nThe recipient of the Medal for Excellence in Elementary/Secondary Administration is Kyle Reynolds, superintendent of Woodward Public Schools. The Woodward native was named superintendent of his alma mater in 2014 and has focused his tenure on helping build bridges out of adversity and creating solutions for all students to excel in academics and in life.\n\n“My job is to serve all kids, and one of my most frequently repeated mantras is ‘All means all,’” Reynolds said. “Our team works every day to build bridges that will connect to our most needy students. … We must build bridges to those who are hungry, those whose home lives lack stability and support, and those who have suffered adversities most of us cannot fathom.”\n\nRecognizing the number of students who faced food insecurity and lacked after-school care, Reynolds partnered with district supporter Bruce Benbrook to fund Boomer ExSTREAM, an after-school program centered on hands-on activities in science, technology, reading, engineering, arts and math (STREAM). Due to its success, the district received two $1.3 million federal grants to sustain the program.\n\nSeeking solutions to address dropout rates and a skills gap in the region’s career market, Reynolds partnered with High Plains Technology Center to create the Technical Applications Program (TAP), which provides electives to introduce middle schoolers to technical skills and trades. The program seeks to spark students’ interests in careers and establish a foundation for post-secondary opportunities.\n\nRecognizing the high percentage of rural students dealing with mental health issues and traumatic experiences, Reynolds and his team partnered with the State Department of Education to receive a multimillion-dollar Project AWARE grant. The grant provided for additional school counselors and trained every teacher in mental health first-aid.\n\nReynolds also worked with the Office of Juvenile Affairs and Western Plains Youth and Family Services to create COPE: Community Outreach Prevention and Education. Juvenile offenders who would have previously been suspended from school are now able to continue their education while receiving counseling and other services to address their issues.\n\n“Kyle Reynolds is an innovator, problem solver, visionary and a man who always leads with the courage of his convictions,” said Kevin Evans, executive director of the Western Plains Youth and Family Services. “As superintendent, his leadership has impacted not only the quality of education for our students, but also the quality of their health and well-being.”\n\nDr. Alissa Proctor, the recipient of the Oklahoma Medal for Excellence in Teaching at a Regional University/Community College, is a professor of optometry at Northeastern State University in Tahlequah. She has frequently been honored as Outstanding Teacher of the Year by NSU optometry students because of her passion for her subject matter and her unique teaching style that combines learner-centered techniques and service learning opportunities. In her 17 years as a professor, Proctor’s teaching philosophy has evolved from a lecture-style presentation to creating a learner-centered environment.\n\n“A learner-centered classroom engages students in the learning process while empowering them to take ownership of their learning,” she said. “I avoid relaying information students can read elsewhere by encouraging thinking, application, clinical connections and information retrieval.”\n\nProctor connects content to real-world applications through case studies and hands-on learning opportunities to apply knowledge to patient care. In her pediatrics course, for example, Proctor invites alumni to bring their children in for students to conduct exams. She also recruits faculty and staff to volunteer as patients while her students work in small groups to examine them and prescribe lenses.\n\nAs an advocate for children’s vision programs, Proctor engages her students in service learning by inviting them to participate in vision screenings at local elementary schools. Her students learn how to interact with children, use language children understand and collect data in a fun and engaging way.\n\n“During the past 16 years, I have supervised the screening of almost 21,000 children,” Proctor said. “I am proud of the work optometry students do to take care of the children of Cherokee County.”\n\nAs the advisor for SVOSH, Students Volunteering Optometric Services for Humanity, Proctor has organized 12 student service-learning trips to Roatan, Honduras. Joined by professional optometrists, the students have examined thousands of patients who would otherwise not receive eye care, providing glasses, eye drops and referring many for additional care, such as cataract surgery.\n\n“Dr. Proctor uses her profession to advocate for those in need and fosters the same mindset of giving back to the community in her students,” said former student Kayla Cook. “In addition to her work in Honduras, Dr. Proctor is a huge proponent of InfantSee, a program that provides no-cost, comprehensive eye exams to infants before their first birthday. … Her advocacy of SVOSH and InfantSee are awe-inspiring and a testament to her service-oriented mindset.”\n\nThe winner of the Medal for Excellence in Teaching at a Research University is F. Bailey Norwood, a professor of agribusiness at Oklahoma State University. Norwood’s passion for economics and teaching were inspired by a college professor, his “Socrates,” who gave him a thirst for learning. “I am living testimony to the importance of a remarkable instructor,” he said. Now, Norwood himself is inspiring future generations as an engaging professor, mentor and community volunteer.\n\n“Dr. Norwood brings challenging topics to life in a way that resonates with students, enhancing their capability for life-long learning,” said colleague Kellie Curry Raper. “He gives students that one class that provides them with the fondest of memories, where the instructor did things no other instructor dared, and where the instructor stepped up to meet the challenge of short attention spans. He makes students take agricultural economics seriously by inspiring them to see all that it has to offer the world.”\n\nNorwood goes to great lengths to learn all his students’ names early in the semester and holds a “Meet Your Classmates” activity to build relationships. He infuses his courses with humor and provides opportunities for students to “get their hands dirty” and learn things they know they will be need in their careers.\n\nIn his popular Farm to Fork course, Norwood presents the science and economics behind agricultural production and marketing decisions, as well as touching on controversial issues like food insecurity. As part of the course, students help manage a garden at a local food pantry to provide produce for neighbors in need. In Norwood’s Quantitative Methods course, students gather at the baseball field to hit three balls as far as they can and then collect data to determine why someone would hit further than others. The exercise helps students understand statistical concepts used to forecast crop yields and other agricultural applications. In his courses, Norwood has even dressed in character as historical figures to help bring complex economics concepts to life.\n\n“Dr. Norwood is the teacher you never forget,” said student Jaci Deitrick. “He made each of his students excited to come to class and tackle difficult subjects like economics and supply chain management. While the material was not easy, Dr. Norwood made it easy to understand and taught us how to apply textbook formulas and definitions to real world applications.”\n\nIn addition to presenting the Medal for Excellence awards, the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence will honor 100 of Oklahoma’s top public high school seniors as Academic All-Staters at its banquet on May 20, 2023. The Academic Awards Banquet is open to the public, with admission priced at $65. Registration will open online April 3 at ofe.org.\n\nNatalia Alca, a fifth-grader at Truman Elementary School in Norman, has been named winner of the 2023 Colonial Day at the Capitol Literature Contest sponsored by the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence.\n\nNatalia, 11, was recognized and read her award-winning essay, “What It Means To Be An American,” during Colonial Day at the Capitol on Jan. 27 in the House of Representatives Chamber at the Oklahoma State Capitol. Nearly 500 students participated in the contest.\n\nBen Franklin, portrayed by historical interpreter Stephen Smith, presented Natalia with a plaque and a $100 prize during Colonial Day opening ceremonies. She also received a citation from her state representative, Jacob Rosecrants, during the ceremony. Natalia wrote about the rights and responsibilities that Americans share as citizens and about her dream of one day becoming president of the United States.\n\n“I am beyond impressed with Natalia’s essay submission,” said her teacher Janet Villani. “It truly reflects the endless possibilities our country offers. I have no doubt Natalia will carry out the hopes and dreams she put in writing. I am so blessed to have her in my class this year!”\n\nNatalia is a member of Truman Elementary School’s GLAMS Club: Girls Learning Agriculture, Math and Science. She is active on the swim team and participates in dance and piano lessons. She is proud to be a Peruvian American who speaks both Spanish and English. Natalia is the daughter of Rebecca Borden Alca and Carlos Alca.\n\nAlso recognized at the Colonial Day opening ceremony were three literature contest finalists, who received certificates of merit. They were Mya Blanchard of Eisenhower Elementary in NORMAN; Maximilliano Arellano of Tulakes Elementary, Putnam City Schools, OKLAHOMA CITY; and Michael Glanzer of Cache Elementary School in CACHE.\n\nDuring Colonial Day, nearly 500 Oklahoma fifth graders traveled back in time to meet historical figures, learn about the daily lives of early Americans, and debate whether the colonies should remain loyal or seek independence from the British crown. Colonial Day is presented by Colonial Williamsburg and George Washington Teacher Institute Alumni in partnership with the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence, a statewide nonprofit that recognizes and encourages academic excellence in public schools. The program director is Teresa Potter, an instructional coach at Kenneth Cooper Middle School in Putnam City Schools.\n\nThe event is also made possible with support from Jami Rhoades Antonisse, Loyd Benson, Diana Brown, Bob Burke, City Bites, Cory’s Audio Visual, the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Daughters of the American Revolution: Samuel King Chapter, George Washington’s Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens, Lou C. Kerr – The Kerr Foundation Inc., National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in Oklahoma, Polly Nichols, the Oklahoma History Center, Oklahoma Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, Charles L. Oppenheim, Mattocks Printing, Tara C’s Sweet Treats, Catherine Wootten, and the Wyndham Grand – Oklahoma City Downtown.\n\nNatalia Alca’s essay, “What It Means To Be An American”\n\nWhat does it mean to be an American? You might have asked yourself that before. If not, I’m here to tell you what I think being an American means. First, being an American means to have the freedom to live the life you want to live. It also means to not have anyone (except your parents if you’re under 18) control it. Finally, being an American means supporting each other no matter what.\n\nFor instance, living the life you want means having opportunities. One of the opportunities Americans have would be that girls are able to go to school and are able to pursue any dreams they have. For example, when I grow up, I want to be the president of the United States of America, and because I am able to go to school and get a good education, hopefully I can make this dream become a reality.\n\nAs an American, part of living the life you want for yourself means having control of it. That’s why having rights is important. Specifically, I believe that having freedom, the right to free speech, and the ability to make decisions about my health and well-being is essential. These rights are just a few of the examples of living the life you want as an American.\n\nLastly, being an American means that we support each other no matter what. We do this by being kind; voting for laws and practices that are good for all people; and remembering, respecting and honoring not only the people who lived here before us but the people who are here now. Given that we live in a multicultural and multilingual society, supporting each other is crucial.\n\nIn conclusion, being an American is an honor. The opportunities, rights and support we give each other allow us to live the lives we want to live and be a community\n\nA community engagement event, a literacy initiative and a Pre-K transition camp have been selected as recipients of the 2022 Outstanding Program Awards for Oklahoma School Foundations presented by the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence and its Oklahoma School Foundations Network.\n\nThe awards recognize innovative programs sponsored or administered by public school foundations in Oklahoma. Receiving plaques and monetary awards of $1,000 each will be the State of the Schools Luncheon sponsored by the Bartlesville Public Schools Foundation, ReadOKC Literacy Initiative sponsored by the Oklahoma City Public Schools Foundation and the Union Pre-K Transitional Camp sponsored by the Union Schools Education Foundation.\n\n“We are honoring these programs for their creativity and the positive impact they have in supporting academic excellence in their communities,” said Elizabeth Inbody, executive director of the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence. “In addition, we plan to share their success stories so other school foundations might emulate or adapt these programs in their own school districts.”\n\nState of the Schools Luncheon\n\nBartlesville Public Schools Foundation\n\nJust as government leaders hold State of the Union or State of the State addresses to inform citizens about goals and achievements, the Bartlesville Public Schools Foundation began hosting a State of the Schools Luncheon five years ago to educate and engage community stakeholders in their school district.\n\n“The State of the Schools Luncheon is more than a luncheon. It is more than a fundraiser,” said Blair Ellis, executive director of the Bartlesville Public Schools Foundation. “It is a community engagement and education advocacy event that the foundation hosts the week before school starts. … By partnering with our district, the foundation has grown this event to be something our attendees look forward to each year.”\n\nThe State of the Schools Luncheon is held in the Bartlesville High School Commons and features a keynote address by Superintendent Chuck McCauley, who reviews the past school year and gives an overview of the district’s priorities for the year ahead. Approximately 250 district stakeholders attended this year’s event, including business leaders, parents, school board members, educators, state and community policy makers and local college and career-tech leaders.\n\n“We have found that by increasing our community’s awareness of all there is to be proud of in our district and of our challenges, it increases the likelihood that they will engage in our school system, offering their time and financial support, and – perhaps most importantly – serving as advocates for our district,” Ellis said.\n\nThe State of the Schools event has become one of the foundation’s largest fundraisers through ticket sales, table sponsorships and an online auction – all of which support teacher grants in the fall. A text-to-give matching challenge is hosted by the presenting sponsor. The foundation also provides information on its programs during the event and provides information to attendees on how they can volunteer and get involved in the district. One of the greatest results of the program has been the increase in community engagement, Ellis said.\n\n“So many great partnerships have arisen from this luncheon – businesses reaching out to host high school interns after learning about our internship program; experts in fields like STEM and aeronautics who offer to come in to visit with students; and reading tutors at our elementary schools,” Ellis said.\n\nReadOKC Literacy Initiative\n\nOklahoma City Public Schools Foundation\n\nReadOKC is a districtwide literacy initiative with the mission of instilling a love for reading in students of Oklahoma City Public Schools and in the community. The initiative was started in 2017 by the OKCPS Compact, comprised of the school district, the Oklahoma City Public Schools Foundation, the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber, City of Oklahoma City and United Way of Central Oklahoma. The Oklahoma City Public Schools Foundation oversees and leads all aspects of ReadOKC, including program management, volunteer engagement and fundraising.\n\n“To accomplish its mission, ReadOKC works toward three primary goals: hosting reading challenges during each school break, increasing access to reading materials, and recruiting volunteers to serve as Reading Buddies,” said Abbie Vaughan, director of Community Outreach for the Oklahoma City Public Schools Foundation.\n\nThrough its Reading Challenges, all OKCPS students are encouraged to read at least 20 minutes each day during school breaks. Students who meet their reading goals receive a backpack button that says, “I met my goal!” Those who log the highest number of minutes receive prizes donated by the community, such as zoo passes, RIVERSPORT Adventure passes or bookstore gift cards. The school with the highest number of reading minutes logged receives a coveted traveling banner to hang outside its building.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Public Schools Foundation also helps recruit Reading Buddies who volunteer once each week to read with a small group of students. These volunteers help instill a love of reading and foster a mentoring relationship with students. More than 500 people have volunteered as Reading Buddies since the program’s inception.\n\nReadOKC also improves access to reading materials through 69 Little Libraries, free public bookcases which are located outside each OKCPS school building and in many city parks. The libraries are stocked and maintained by volunteers, and students are encouraged to “Take a Book, Leave a Book.” The initiative also offers ReadOKC On the Go!, a school bus that has been retrofitted as a moving library. The bus visits each OKCPS school site and invites students to choose a brand-new book to take home as their own.\n\nSince 2017, ReadOKC has hosted 23 reading challenges, with more than 72,000 students reading for over 30 million minutes. ReadOKC On the Go! has distributed over 22,000 new books to students since July 2021. Preliminary data shows a connection between high performing reading challenge schools and improved benchmark scores for students in those schools.\n\n“Literacy is the foundation of learning and student success in academics,” said Mary Mélon-Tully, president and CEO of the Oklahoma City Public Schools Foundation. “All aspects of ReadOKC strive to improve student literacy by creating lifelong readers and a culture of literacy in our schools.”\n\nUnion Pre-K Transition Camp\n\nUnion Schools Education Foundation\n\nUnion Public Schools’ Pre-K Transition Camp is a summer program that gives incoming Pre-K students the opportunity to experience “school” before the beginning of the formal school year. Students are introduced to school personnel, peers and the routines of each school day. The camp also gives parents the opportunity to participate in parent education programs and to get acquainted with teachers.\n\n“Pre-K can sometimes be an overwhelming transition for some students,” said Shea Ludwig, executive director of the Union Schools Education Foundation. “Union’s Pre-K Camp is designed to ease students and families’ anxiety about this new transition.”\n\nTaking place before the new school year, Pre-K Camp gives teachers the opportunity to lead students through routines of the school day and immerse them in opportunities to develop literacy, math and socio-emotional skills. Meanwhile, parents are invited to attend educational sessions on topics such as establishing healthy sleep habits and reading with children. Parents learn how they can partner with teachers to support their child’s educational goals.\n\nUnion began offering a Pre-K Camp in 2012 targeting Title I schools that served many low-income and immigrant families. The success of the program quickly caught the attention of the Union Schools Education Foundation Board of Directors, who sought to support and expand the program to all elementary schools in the district. The foundation provides materials for each Camp, including supplies and, beginning this year, gifting each student with a book titled “The Night Before Pre-School.”\n\nThe foundation seeks to measure outcomes of the program through attendance data, parent and child surveys, and reports from teachers on how Pre-K Camp participants adapted to school compared with peers who did not participate.\n\n“Pre-K Camp serves as a crucial first step in building relationships with children and families to promote good behaviors that lead to academic achievement throughout school,” Ludwig said. The positive implications of this preparation are immense. On the first day of school, preschoolers will be ready and confident to begin their journeys as students. Families will also benefit from learning about strategies to support their child’s development.”\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY- The Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence has announced the winners of its 2022 Oklahoma Medal for Excellence awards honoring five outstanding educators in Oklahoma’s public schools.\n\nThe awards will be presented at the foundation’s 36th Academic Awards Celebration on May 21 at the Omni Oklahoma City Hotel. Each of the five winners will receive a $5,000 cash prize and a glass “Roots and Wings” sculpture, designed by the late Oklahoma artist Ron Roberts and produced by Artistic Glass Studio of Edmond.\n\nThis year’s Medal for Excellence winners and their award categories are: Lori Zimmerman, a reading teacher at SHATTUCK Middle School, elementary teaching; Elaine Hutchison, a math teacher at FAIRVIEW High School, secondary teaching; Scott Allen, principal of Monroe Elementary School in ENID, elementary/secondary school administration; Elise McCauley, professor of speech, Redlands Community College, EL RENO, regional university/community college teaching; and Dr. K. K. “Muralee” Muraleetharan, professor of civil engineering and environmental science, University of Oklahoma, NORMAN, research university teaching.\n\n“Oklahomans know that education is the best investment we can make for our future,” said Elizabeth Inbody, executive director of the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence, a nonprofit that recognizes and encourages academic excellence in the state’s public schools. “By honoring these exceptional educators, we are sending a message that we value excellence in public schools and the professionals who have given so much of themselves to enrich the lives of our children.”\n\nLori Zimmerman, winner of the Oklahoma Medal for Excellence in Elementary Teaching, is a 24-year teaching veteran who began a new post in 2021 as reading teacher at Shattuck Middle School. Zimmerman’s goal each day is to provide original learning opportunities and exciting, magical experiences for her students. She utilizes project-based learning, technology and drama to help students “fall in love with reading.”\n\nAt least once each year, Zimmerman transforms her classroom library into Mrs. Z’s Literary Café, where each learner is presented with a buffet of books through a menu of book “tastings.” Instead of\n\ncreating old-school book reports, her students make “Book Talk” videos reviewing their books and linking them to a QR code, which is placed in the books for future readers to scan and view online.\n\nAfter reading biographies, Zimmerman’s students have created a “Wax Museum,” dressing up and portraying historical figures who come to life and share their stories when visitors push a button. When her students read historical fiction about the Holocaust, Zimmerman brought a Holocaust survivor to class to share his story of endurance and invited the community members to visit a student-made Holocaust Museum. “Lori has the ability to seamlessly weave all subjects into her lessons and allow her students to make those all-important learning connections,” said Linda Harrison, former Woodward School Board president.\n\nParent Sonya Covalt praised Zimmerman for helping her self-proclaimed “non-reader” son become hooked on books. “No other teacher has impacted my son’s desire to read as she did,” Covalt said.\n\nZimmerman, who has a passion for theater, is also known for dressing up and portraying literary characters – a practice that kept her students especially engaged when the pandemic forced classes to meet online. She recently launched the first drama class at Shattuck Middle School in hopes of instilling an appreciation for theater in her rural community.\n\nZimmerman is the recipient of numerous teaching honors, including selection as a State Teacher of the Year finalist. Former student Adrianna Tibbetts credits Zimmerman for inspiring her to become a teacher herself. “The examples she gave me, both as a caring person and as an effective educator, have had a huge impact on my life story. I go to work every day and think, ‘How can I be like Lori Zimmerman today?’”\n\nElaine Hutchison, winner of the Medal for Excellence in Secondary Teaching, is a 29-year teaching veteran who teaches courses in algebra, trigonometry and calculus as well as serving as the academic team coach at Fairview High School.\n\nHutchison aptly describes her teaching methodology as (HT)6: High Tech, High Touch, Higher-Level Thinking, Hands-On Techniques, Habitual Thankfulness and Heroic Teacher. By engaging her students in meaningful lessons through inquiry-based, cross-curricular learning, they become critical thinkers, problem solvers and effective communicators.\n\nHutchison utilizes technology to help unlock student potential and hands-on projects to help students connect math concepts to real-world applications. Her students have used trigonometry to design roller coasters, complete with a Google site and video demonstrations. Through an innovation grant in 2019, Hutchison purchased two MakerBot 3-D printers and along with her students became a certified MakerBot Innovator. This year, her high school students are collaborating with third-grade students to design and create 3-D printed cookie cutters for a local bakery.\n\n“Learning in my classroom is ‘messy,’” Hutchison said. “It requires students to do, refine, and create final products that take a substantial amount of time. However, my students will remember their Trig roller coaster projects, 3-D printed fractals, Bungee Barbie data collection labs and Exponential\n\nGrowth Investment presentations so much more than any comprehensive test.”\n\nWhile Hutchison may be legendary for her rigorous, advanced placement math courses, she has a special gift for supporting students who are struggling with math. Special education teacher Rinda Bowden recalls how Hutchison patiently encouraged and worked with a young man learning algebra. He eventually went on to earn an advanced score on the state Algebra 2 test. “Elaine is a master at meeting students where they are and motivating them, pushing them to be THEIR best.”\n\nA National Board Certified teacher and former State Teacher of the Year, Hutchison has inspired many of her former students to pursue teaching careers. Mandy Mason, whose four daughters took math and played on the basketball team coached by Hutchison, said three of her four daughters are teachers and coaches, while the fourth is studying to become a school counselor. “Elaine demands a certain standard from her students, only because she gives the same to each of her students. There is no doubt that the study habits and work ethic that Elaine taught my daughters has led to their successes in life.”\n\nThe winner of the Medal for Excellence in Elementary/Secondary Administration is Scott Allen, who has served as principal of Monroe Elementary School in Enid since 2015. Through a transformational growth mindset and series of new initiatives, Allen led Monroe from being an underperforming school to a school of champions.\n\n“When Mr. Allen became principal, he took over a school with a failing grade from the state,” said teacher Pam Seigel, noting that most Monroe students come from low-income families and are often learning to speak English. “Using new programs, intervention strategies and professional development for staff, Monroe became a B+ school!”\n\nAllen instituted weekly Professional Learning Community meetings of school staff and screened the academic performance of each student to “laser focus” strategies for meeting the academic needs of each student. He introduced a new reading curriculum for Pre-K through third-grade students to sharpen phonics skills and participated in a Penpal-a-Principal initiative to encourage reading and writing. Recognizing the high number of students who have endured painful experiences, Allen guided Monroe to become a trauma-informed school through extensive staff training. “When a child is not ‘blooming,’ we don’t try to change the child,” Allen said. “We provide a safe environment where the child can flourish.”\n\nAllen also set out to change school culture and instill a belief in teachers and students that Monroe could reach great heights of success. He started holding daily inspirational assemblies – complete with singing, dancing and call-back affirmations – to help students develop a champion mindset and believe they can overcome life’s obstacles. “His inspired leadership has influenced many of my fifth graders to become positive role models in the school,” said teacher Traci Conrady. “Hope is the message that enables us to go beyond our limitations – as if being a champion were our calling.”\n\nAllen has developed many community partnerships, but the most impactful has been with the 33rd Squadron at nearby Vance Air Force Base. The airmen enthusiastically participate in school assemblies and mentor and read to students. For his leadership, the Squadron recognized Allen as an Honorary Commander.\n\n“The students at Monroe know Mr. Allen cares for them and wants them to succeed,” Seigel added. “In turn, they care about Mr. Allen. It is evident by all the high fives and hugs he receives walking down the hall.”\n\nElise McCauley, the recipient of the Oklahoma Medal for Excellence in Teaching at a Regional University/Community College, is a professor of speech and English at Redlands Community College. Over her 28 years as an educator, McCauley has worked at the middle school, high school and college levels. Her diverse experiences and the unique challenges her students face have driven home an essential truth for her: “Teachers don’t teach subjects; they teach students.”\n\nMcCauley’s empathy and put-the-learner-first focus has helped her adapt her teaching strategies to meet students’ most pressing needs. When she was a rookie teacher at an inner-city school in Tulsa, McCauley adapted her lessons to address some of the daily realities her students faced. “‘Romeo and Juliet’ became about gang violence more than star-crossed lovers; ‘The Odyssey’ became about facing life’s challenges more than classical literature,” McCauley said. “I had students write future autobiographies where they planned to live to 100 so they could visualize the future and set goals.”\n\nToday, as a professor at Redlands Community College, McCauley practices the same strategy based on keen observation of her students’ needs. When COVID forced classes online in 2020, McCauley recognized the need for students to better communicate and physically present themselves in a professional manner over video conferencing platforms, whether for school or job interviews. She incorporated an online training curriculum, Zoom Play Days, into each of her classes. The curriculum received many accolades, including the Great Ideas for Teaching Award from the Oklahoma Association of Community Colleges.\n\n“Professor McCauley maintains a rigor in her classes to prepare her students for the challenges they will face, both academically and professionally, while also showing compassion and empathy for the personal struggles students face,” said colleague Marcia Shottenkirk. She also builds relationships and supports students’ progress through regularly scheduled one-to-one conferences, Shottenkirk added.\n\nFormer student Jamie Warren said McCauley is a role model who has made her feel more confident with public speaking. McCauley provided techniques and a note packet for students to prepare their speeches, taught them the fine art of providing constructive criticism, and pushed them outside their comfort zone by assigning impromptu speeches with little prep time.\n\n“I left on the last day of class a better person, public speaker and even a better friend because I am better at communication than I was before,” Warren said.\n\nThe winner of the Medal for Excellence in Teaching at a Research University is Dr. K. K. “Muralee” Muraleetharan, a David Ross Boyd Professor of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science at the University of Oklahoma. Inspired by many teaching mentors, Muraleetharan has developed a five-part approach over his 28-year teaching career that seeks to “light a fire” of lifelong learning for his students. For him, effective teaching must encompass excitement for the subject matter, relating lessons\n\nto real-world examples, incorporating the latest technological advances, offering project-based learning for students to apply their knowledge, and truly caring about individual students’ well-being.\n\n“Professor Muralee represents the best of the best in research professorship,” said former student Caroline Cochran, co-founder of a tech startup. “His research is outstanding, his outreach to students unparalleled and his instruction is caring while rigorous and even fun.”\n\nMuraleetharan, who worked in industry as a geotechnical engineer, shares his professional experiences, such as seismic design of the Port of Los Angeles Pier 400 and geoenvironmental investigations of metro rail tunnels, to help get students excited about the real-world applications of engineering. “Many young engineers struggle with making the transition from being a student to being a professional engineer,” said colleague Randall Kolar, director of OU’s School of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science. “Dr. Muralee has the background and passion to help bridge this knowledge gap so his students come out better prepared to enter the workforce.”\n\nMuraleetharan helped develop OU’s introductory civil engineering course to engage students in real-world projects while developing skills fundamental to engineering success. He was also a leader in developing OU’s award-winning civil engineering curriculum Sooner City, in which freshmen are given a plat of undeveloped land that is developed into a blueprint for a virtual city infrastructure by the time they graduate. Projects have ranged from concrete footings for virtual office buildings to floodplain analysis and bridge crossing design.\n\nColleagues and students alike praised Muraleetharan for going the extra mile to mentor and support students. Former student Jessica Stanciu credits Mureleetharan for helping her explore career options and land her first job. “He is the type of professor you go back to see after college to say, ‘thank you.’ … Thank you for making me feel valued and cared for while building me up with confidence as I go out into the world.”\n\nIn addition to presenting the Medal for Excellence awards, the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence will honor 100 of Oklahoma’s top public high school seniors as Academic All-Staters at its May 21 banquet. The Academic Awards Banquet is open to the public, with admission priced at $65. Registration will open online April 4 at ofe.org.\n\nTo help support the growth and development of K-12 mentoring programs in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence has announced the recipients of its first Boren Mentoring Initiative start-up grants and opportunity grants totaling $15,000.\n\nThe announcement coincides with National Mentoring Month in January, a campaign that aims to celebrate the power of mentoring relationships and raise the awareness of the importance of youth mentoring around the United States.\n\nTwo start-up grants of $3,000 each have been awarded to BEST! (Building Extraordinary Success Today) Mentoring, a community-based mentoring organization sponsored by the CACHE Schools Education Foundation; and Positive Presence, a mentoring program serving students ages 5-19 in WILSON Public Schools. Start-up grants are awarded to organizations in their first three years of operation and are designed to encourage communities to establish quality mentoring programs.\n\nSix opportunity grants of $1,500 each were awarded to existing mentoring programs to help fund programming, training, materials or other needs that advance excellence in mentoring for K-12 students. Recipients are Big Brothers Big Sisters of Oklahoma in BARTLESVILLE, which serves children ages 6 to 18; Volunteers for Youth Pal+ Program of CLAREMORE, which serves youth ages 6-18 in Rogers County schools; One True Light Inc., which serves DUNCAN K-12 students through Summer Feeding and Link One Mentoring Programs; Freedom City, which helps at-risk OKLAHOMA CITY Public Schools students catch up academically through in-school and after-school programming; Thunderbird Challenge Program in PRYOR, a 22-week program for high school dropouts sponsored by the Oklahoma National Guard; and Oklahoma State University Reading and Math Center and Pre-Service Teachers Program in STILLWATER, which provides mentoring and literacy help to Upward Bound high school students.\n\n“We are excited to announce our first Boren Mentoring Initiative Grant recipients and to watch how this year’s recipients will use their funds to strengthen mentoring and impact student growth in their communities,” said Elizabeth Inbody, executive director of the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence. “We look forward to sharing success stories from each of these programs in the coming year.”\n\nThe Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence is a statewide nonprofit founded in 1985 by then U.S. Sen. David L. Boren to recognize and encourage academic excellence in Oklahoma’s public schools. The David and Molly Boren Mentoring Initiative – one of the foundation’s five programs — promotes the growth and development of quality mentoring programs in Oklahoma. The initiative grew out of the Borens’ own commitment to mentoring and the proven impact that mentoring can make on a student’s success in and out of the classroom.\n\nIn addition to awarding grants, the Boren Mentoring Initiative provides on-call support and resources for mentoring organizations, school districts, businesses and others seeking information on how to start or strengthen their mentoring program for K-12 students.\n\nBoren Mentoring Initiative Grant Recipients\n\nBARTLESVILLE – Big Brothers Big Sisters of Oklahoma provides fully vetted, caring mentors for children 6 to 18. Its mission is to create and support one-to-one mentoring relationships that ignite the power and promise of youth. The agency’s Bartlesville office will use its opportunity grant funds to help revitalize its school-based mentoring program in Dewey Public Schools, recruiting and training high school volunteers to serve mentees in need.\n\nCACHE – The BEST! (Building Extraordinary Success Today) Mentoring Program, sponsored by the Cache Schools Education Foundation, focuses on leadership, career exploration and life skills education for middle school and high school students. Start-up grant funds will be used to support group Lunch-and-Learn events, a spring leadership event at Skills for Life Academy, a Mentor Appreciation Day as well as marketing materials for recruiting and retaining volunteers.\n\nCLAREMORE – Volunteers for Youth’s PAL + Program serves youth ages 6-18 in school systems in Rogers County.

The initiative raised the funds needed to transform a retired Jenks school bus into a fully functional bookmobile.\n\nIn summer 2019, a group of dedicated educators determined a population of Jenks Public Schools students may not have access to books during the summer months. To provide these students with equitable access to books, multiple teachers volunteered their time and resources to load donated books into a van, travel to nearby apartment complexes, and offer books to families. The makeshift book- mobile was well received, and families lined up each week to take home a selection of books. These\n\nteachers presented the positive outcomes of their summer literacy effort to the Jenks Board of Education, along with their vision of expanding the program.\n\nJenks Public Schools Foundation leaders heard their request and approved a Trojans Read the Way funding initiative. In February 2020, the foundation issued a call to action at its annual Dinner and Auction, raising funds to repurpose a retired Jenks school bus into the Trojans Read the Way Bookmobile.\n\nJenks carpenters removed the interior seating and worked with the Trojans Read the Way team to create a colorful interior equipped with bookshelves, seating, and a generator to provide air conditioning during the hot summer months. Once the interior of the bookmobile was completed, a Jenks business produced a wrap with a fun design to cover the bus. The Jenks Public Schools Foundation logo is proudly included in the design. Funds raised for the initiative also provided a permanent canopy for the bookmobile. A call for donated books was made throughout the district with Trojan Read the Way donation receptacles placed at all school sites. Several Foundation board members also offered to place receptacles at their businesses. Thousands of books have been collected.\n\n“Jenks Public Schools Foundation leaders and the Trojans Read the Way team all agree that the Trojans Read the Way literacy program was extremely successful,” said foundation executive director Elizabeth Inbody. “It has grown from a grassroots effort of delivering books out of a van to an air conditioned, colorful, inviting bookmobile where students can experience the joy of selecting a book that will become part of their own home library. The number of students served increased dramatically, and three times "
