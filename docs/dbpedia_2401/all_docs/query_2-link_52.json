We would like to offer students (particularly Year 9) the opportunity to build an underwater robot. This will build on their science knowledge of plate tectonics and oceanography (and links to Nautilus Live expedition), electrical circuits and electromagnetic spectrum. We hope that an “Active Display” could be set up for the final day, where students could demonstrate their robots to staff/students (with an invitation to junior school students).\n\nErindale College\n\nScience and Mathematics Enrichment Day where students from schools on the southside of Canberra are invited to participate in a full day of challenging and engaging science and mathematics activities aimed at promoting enthusiasm and further study.\n\nFrench-Australian Preschool Assoc. Inc.\n\nThe children at our school are very curious and keen to understand and talk about phenomenon they notice around them. The goal is to help them to conduct scientific experiments in the five classes and in the after school program. The staff will decide on the experiments they will organise for their class. The teachers will offer a list of activities to the children who will choose and conduct the activities in small groups during a set time. This will encourage the students to have ownership of the experiments. The children will make their little science booklets to explain to their parents how they did the experiments.\n\nJervis Bay School\n\nScience workshop and show for preschool and primary school students.\n\nKaleen Primary\n\nFamily science night.\n\nMaribyrnong Primary\n\nRobot challenge event to introduce robotics to the whole school. Students will be asked to come up with either a particular goal (eg choreograph a robotic dance routine) or a particular problem they want to use the robot to solve (eg getting through a maze).
