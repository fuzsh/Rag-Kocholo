        "text": "Did not really prepare me for college. Also work was not hard at all. Lots of just busy work and never really had work that made me think besides in maybe 1 or 2 classes. Teachers were nice though while some were oblivious. It was a fun school, but definitley not one for their academics.\n\nAt my time here at Lakeland, I have gotten the opportunity to excel in areas that could benefit me in my future endeavors. Lakeland has done a great job in providing class opportunities for students interested in specific sciences, business, music, arts, and mechanics. As for me, with an intended interest and major in Business, I have had the opportunity to take Entrepreneur classes offered by the University of Delaware, where I have gained knowledge on important attributions in the process of becoming a successful entrepreneur. The worst part of my experience is the lack of school spirit. During my 4 years here at Lakeland, I have been disappointed with the lack of spirit within our community. Watching other schools participate in activities such as spirit week, homecoming, etc. our school has never fully actively participated in these core events in a students high school career."
