        "text": "From the Principal’s Desk, 31 October 2019\n\nDear Parents\n\n“Resolve to be tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the wrong. Sometime in life you will have been all of these.”\n\n― George Washington Carver\n\nOur world has become a place of intolerance, impatience and entitlement. It saddens me to see the anger and impatience of drivers when they have to share the road with pedestrians and instead of honouring the elderly members of our community, we treat them as a burden.\n\nAt Blouberg International we teach our students to greet parents, staff and visitors. Respect and kindness is never wasted.\n\nYou can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force. Educating our children is far more than academics; it is also the tolerance, respect and compassion we show and teach our children.\n\nAs a country we are gearing up for the Rugby World Cup finals on Saturday. In support of our national team therefore, students will enjoy a free civvies day tomorrow (Friday, the 1st of November) and we encourage everyone to wear green and gold in support of the Springboks.\n\nI wish you all a wonderful weekend.\n\nEdna\n\nRead More\n\nFrom the Principal’s Desk, 24 October 2019\n\nDear Parents\n\nThis week I received several emails from parents expressing their excitement after seeing students practicing for athletics in the mornings. It is indeed an awesome sight to see both Key stage 2 and the high school preparing themselves for the upcoming sports events. Their display of hard work and dedication goes a long way in building school spirit and a sense of community amongst the students.\n\nSaturday, the 9th of November, is a Sports Day for the Foundation Stage and Key Stage 1 students and we look forward to cheering on our little athletes. Throughout the key stages, our teachers are encouraging students, as per school policy, to ensure they are doing at least one winter and one summer sport every term.\n\n“If we did all the things, we are capable of doing, we would literally astound ourselves.” – Thomas Edison.\n\nIf we want to live a successful life, we must take complete responsibility for everything we experience. This week I have been particularly mindful of responsibility and the potential greatness we can achieve if we take responsibility for both our physical and mental well-being. The key to success in every aspect of our lives lies within us. Challenging though it may be, taking responsibility for the aspects of our lives within our control, does bring peace of mind.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, our Year 10 and 12 students began their final AS and IGCSE examinations. It was moving to see a group of students the other day, gather and pray before entering the examination venue. I was impressed by their calm and the mindset with which they faced the examination.\n\nThe school’s management team is actively planning for 2020 and we are excited to see the growth in our class numbers. An additional Year 5 class will open in 2020 as we strive to keep our classes small, allowing our teachers to give personal attention to their students.\n\nMy goal for the week ahead is inspired by Dale Carnegie.\n\n“If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy, and inspires your hopes.”\n\nI wish you all a wonderful weekend ahead.\n\nKind regards\n\nEdna\n\nRead More\n\nFrom the Principal’s Desk, 17 October 2019\n\nDear Parents\n\nI have just returned from a wonderfully informative conference in Budapest. It is always encouraging when principals from different corners of the world come together as it’s an opportunity to learn from each other’s different experiences.\n\nI have also recently had a visit from Cambridge Regional Director, Juan Visser, on Wednesday the 16th of October. I am happy to report that as a Cambridge Registered Centre we are looking forward to continued support from Cambridge; their guidance with regards to university entrance, subject choice and compliance is invaluable.\n\nCambridge Primary has traditionally focused on Mathematics, Science and English as Core Subject Areas. However, effective from September 2019, the curriculum will be broadened. It is important that students are able to identify their favorite subjects early in their academic career and are encouraged to pursue the areas in which their natural talents lie. In order to accommodate the differing strengths and interests of the students, Cambridge has broadened its curriculum with the addition of Art and Design, Digital Literacy, Music and Physical Education. Their aim is to develop the all-important “soft skills” of teamwork, responsibility, leadership and resilience. Cambridge is constantly developing and revising its programs in order to offer the best possible education for the learners.\n\n“In a fast-moving world, education needs to evolve.”- Dr. Judith Roberts\n\nThe focus of the curriculum for the various subjects are as follows:\n\nDigital Literacy aims to develop learners understanding of the digital world and celebrates the opportunities that technology offers. The aim is to increase the confidence in students while using technology.\n\nPhysical Education focuses on developing movement skills.\n\nMusic allows the learners to explore the subject as performers, composers and listeners.\n\nArt and Design encourages learners to express themselves as they experience and reflect on art.\n\nWe are incredibly excited about the broadened scope of the curriculum as we are now able to offer the above subjects to the standard which Cambridge requires.\n\nI wish you all a wonderful weekend.\n\nKind regards\n\nEdna\n\nRead More\n\nFrom the Principal’s Desk, 11 October 2019\n\nDear Parents,\n\nThe definition of appreciation- the thoughts of a teacher.\n\nIt’s the little things.\n\nAs clichéd as it might sound, I truly feel that it is the small moments of triumph, the quiet moments we keep to ourselves when an involuntary smile breaks across our face and a lightness, a sense of joyous freedom descends; these are the moments we return for.\n\nHumans need to feel valued, is this not a universal truth? Most of us want our value vocalized, trumpeted, for us to feel secure.\n\nI am coming to realize that teachers are a little different in this respect.\n\nThe importance of teachers is undisputed and good teachers are invaluable. I think we know our value and it’s not just about our students reaching a predefined academic standard. We applaud the A’s and encourage the C’s and, naturally, seeing a student or a class improve over time gives us pleasure; it’s the pleasure of knowing that we are fulfilling our purpose, our requirements. Where I believe the true joy in teaching lies is in the little moments, insignificant perhaps in the grand scheme of academic terms and mark sheets, but nourishing to the soul of a teacher.\n\nThe simple phrase “thank you, ma’am” has a healing quality which can transform bitterness into relief, it can coax a reluctant smile from even the most recalcitrant of jawlines. A scribbled note in the corner of the board, a ‘U rock!’ Or perhaps a ‘stay awesome!’- it doesn’t secure an A, but it sure secures a smile.\n\nWe enjoyed a visit from Andrew Blackie (Commercial Director) and Louise Mayor (Head of Marketing) of Sparx this week. The Sparx Programme will be introduced to our School next year. More information will be sent to parents shortly.\n\nWishing you a restful weekend.\n\nKind Regards\n\nEdna\n\nRead More\n\nFrom The Principal’s Desk, 3 October 2019\n\nDear Parents\n\nWelcome back to the final term of 2019! The teachers enjoyed a short break but are ready and eager to run the last leg of the race before the end of the academic year.\n\nREFLECTING AND GROWING\n\nThe importance of self-reflection is one of the best life lessons I have learnt. The end of a task, the end of a season or a term at school is an opportunity for self-reflection.\n\nWhat have I done well? What can I do better? What areas are in need of change?\n\nReflecting gives us the opportunity to positively critique our decisions and behavior in order to improve.\n\nNothing can ever be perfect and change is as good as a holiday.\n\nReflecting on one’s performance and asking ourselves the difficult question of where we need to improve leads to growth and only good can come from acceptance of what needs to be changed or improved.\n\nWe are busy with the installation of much needed air conditioning systems in the junior school. I am certain that both the staff and students are looking forward to the cooling effect!\n\nThis term key stage 2 and the high school will begin athletics practice. The homeroom teachers will discuss the sports uniforms with students and how best they can wear their uniforms during these crucial practice sessions.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 8th of October, the high school will have an information evening for all Year 6 parents regarding the transition into high school. We look forward to an enjoyable and informative session.\n\nAt Blouberg International, the safety and well-being of our students and staff is of the utmost importance. We wish to reiterate that no parent or visitor may go directly to a teacher’s classroom. All visitors to the school must report directly to reception and the relevant teacher will be informed of your presence. Any items you wish delivered to your child during the course of the school day must be handed in at reception and the child’s teacher will be notified of the item at reception. We are tightening security around the entrance of the school grounds and we will close the security doors to the building in the morning, during break times and after school.\n\nPlease also note that all cars entering the school grounds must carry the official school sticker to prevent unknown vehicles entering the premises. We have our students’ best interests at heart and therefore we will be enforcing these rules strictly.\n\nI wish every teacher, student and parent a successful fourth term with regards to all aspects of school life.\n\nKind regards\n\nEdna\n\nRead More\n\nFrom the Principal’s Desk, 13th September 2019 – Cultivating an attitude of gratitude.\n\nDear Parents\n\nThis week, as I was marking the year 12 examination papers, I was filled with pride when assessing the quality of the work produced. I taught this particular group when they were in year 7 and I remember, even back then, how much they enjoyed hearing real-life examples of the business world and its application in the curriculum. Marking their papers and seeing how far they have come gave me such a sense of accomplishment.\n\nThis experience reminded me of the dedicated staff I am surrounded by and of our shared love of teaching. The job of a teacher is not an easy one and sometimes the challenges we face seem insurmountable. We take decisions based on what is best for the collective and what will be of benefit to the students in the long-run. We have all been guilty, I believe, of being too focused on what is important to us in our private sphere of influence, rather than focusing on the bigger picture.\n\nI wish to thank all the staff at Blouberg International for the dedication and determination they show on a daily basis. It is not always easy, but when students come and share their excitement with you or hug you from pure joy, that is what makes the job easier every day.\n\nI had a chat with one of our year 12 students who I met years ago at a previous school. She was only in year 4 then and soon relocated to the Blouberg area. Years later when I started teaching at Blouberg International, we were reunited at our old campus. We often joke about how I followed her and about how her family left for Abu Dhabi but returned once more to Blouberg (This time she followed me!). I feel such joy when she relates her memories of us at our old campus and now at the current one. It is wonderful to see what a special young lady she has become and it is these bonds we form, which make our years of teaching worthwhile. I truly have a grateful heart.\n\nLet us remember the good and cultivate an attitude of gratitude. When one looks for the good in others, we are sure to find it. The opposite of this is unfortunately true as well.\n\nTo all the teachers: may you come to school every day to make a difference.\n\nThis morning, I had the privilege of enjoying breakfast with the cast of our musical and the teachers who worked relentlessly to make the show the success it was. Thank you to all the cast members for working so hard at rehearsals and to all the parents who supported their children.\n\nHave a wonderful weekend.\n\nRegards\n\nEdna\n\nRead More\n\nFrom the Principal’s Desk, 29 August 2019\n\nDear Parents\n\nWe have had an immensely busy term thus far and this got me thinking the other day about goals.\n\nWe navigate through our lives running from one task to the next, sometimes missing beautiful moments along the way. It feels like we barely blink and our children are walking, going to school, graduating, getting married and suddenly it is time to retire.\n\nPerhaps it would be good practice for us to sit down and take stock of where we have been, where we are now and where we want to go. This is a wonderful exercise to teach our children as they work towards their goal of graduation. However, the ultimate goal of graduation must also be met with balance.\n\nTeaching our children to enjoy the journey will ultimately help them achieve success. It is all too easy to lose sight of your goals when you are overwhelmed and stressed. Taking the time to allow yourself to breathe and enjoy the moment will help you re-evaluate yourself and your goals. This introspection will lead to healthier, happier and more successful individuals entering the adult world with confidence.\n\nSuccess is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful. – Albert Schweitzer\n\nAs we are nearing the end of the third term, I would like to remind parents to start purchasing the correct uniform for the summer months. It is very important that the students wear the correct uniform and that we, as parents and teachers, encourage them in this endeavor. In doing so, we instill a sense of pride in the students with the end goal that wearing the correct uniform is not a chore, but a matter of honour. I therefore urge parents to prepare now for the change in uniform next term.\n\nLast night was the opening night of our high school’s musical production ‘Little Shop of Horrors’. Although a successful opening night, it was disappointing to see the lack of support for our students and for the burgeoning cultural program at our school. The students and teachers have worked incredibly hard to put this performance together and last night was an awe inspiring showcase of their talent. I encourage all our students and parents to purchase tickets for the last two performances as we owe it to the students to support their efforts and to support the growth of arts and culture within our school community.\n\nRegards\n\nEdna\n\nRead More\n\nFrom the Principal’s Desk, 22 August 2019\n\nDear Parents\n\nThis has been an exciting week as we celebrated Book Week in our junior school.\n\nWe had a visit from South African author Lori-Ann Preston who addressed our Key Stage 2 students. She is a seasoned South African educator with more than twenty years of experience. She has a Bachelor of Education Honours Degree through the University of South Africa.\n\nLori-Ann won the Golden Baobab Prize in 2016 for her Early Chapter book ‘The Ama-zings!’, a fast-moving, fun-filled adventure story, and received the New Writer of the Year award in 2016 from the South African Writer’s Circle.\n\nShe just launched another book called “Thabo, the Space Dude“ which promises to be an interesting and compelling read to our children.\n\nOur choir participated in the West Coast Song Festival last night and the organisation of the event at Woodbridge Primary was exceptional. Thank you to all the parents who came to support our choir.\n\nOn Friday we will have our Storybook Dress-up Day and we are looking forward to our students creative costume ideas. This promises to be a fun-filled day at school, signaling the end of another successful Book Week.\n\nNext week we have the opening of our high school’s 2019 musical ‘Little Shop of Horrors. It has been was such a pleasure to see how actively this was promoted by our students this morning as they sang and danced in the car park, inviting parents to come and see the production. They have all worked tremendously hard over the past months to ensure we have a potentially award winning show.\n\nI wish you a wonderful weekend ahead.\n\nKind regards\n\nEdna\n\nRead More\n\nFrom The Principal’s Desk, 8 August 2019\n\nDear Parents\n\n“Happiness is a choice, why are you not choosing it?”\n\nJill Mansfield\n\nI was reminded again this week that we are in control of how we respond to negative situations and people. We all have days where we are in high spirits and other days that are low. How we deal with those days is up to us! Happiness is a choice!\n\nAs we celebrate National Woman’s day tomorrow, let us choose to celebrate; be joyful and be the reason others smile! Let it be your intention to make someone’s day!\n\nIn South Africa, we celebrate Women’s Day on the 9th of August as this day marks the anniversary of the Women’s March of 1956 to the Union Buildings in Pretoria in protest of the pass laws.\n\nToday we celebrate women for more than just the march in 1956. We celebrate them for their individuality and life-giving role. Women are integral in teaching our girls about their unique role in life! Let us celebrate our grandmothers, mothers and daughters to be more!\n\nA reminder that we will have another fun interactive morning on the 17th of August 2019. Please come and join our staff as we learn more about what is happening in our class rooms.\n\nEnjoy the long weekend ahead and stay warm and dry.\n\nRegards\n\nEdna\n\nRead More"
