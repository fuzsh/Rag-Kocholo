        "text": "Anupa was born in Nairobi, Kenya and moved to Australia in 1999. After moving to Australia, she soon started volunteering her services to a range of organisations. She has recently completed a Diploma in Community Services.\n\nAnupa works as a volunteer for the Sikh Volunteers Australia Organisation, a non-profit volunteer organisation focusing on reducing distress in the community by providing free food to disadvantaged families.\n\nAnupa also participates in the Food and Blanket Drive Project where she provides support for homeless people, distributing home-cooked food and blankets. She also volunteers to visit older people in their homes who are isolated from society, providing a friendly face and conversation; and she provides respite support for foster families.\n\nYoung Citizen of the Year - Lachlan Kennedy\n\nLachlan is an outstanding young person who gives 100 per cent to every opportunity he is given. Lachlan was one of the Heathmont College school captains for 2020 before he finished his VCE.\n\nLachlan is a current member of the Maroondah Youth Wellbeing Advocates program which provides two-way engagement between Council and young people. Lachlan has shown maturity in providing feedback on important Council documents and is always willing to share his opinion in a respectful manner. Lachlan also created a wellbeing project at school as part of the Maroondah Student Wellbeing Action Teams project.\n\nLachlan MC'd the 2020 Maroondah Youth Awards, has been involved in multiple video projects with Council, and is following his passion for working with people by studying a Bachelor of Youth Work in 2021.\n\nCommunity Event of the Year - Glen Park and Eastland Food Relief Collection Services\n\nGlen Park Community Centre offers a food relief frozen meal distribution service for those doing it tough. However, the COVID-19 restrictions during 2020 have impacted the service, in particular the travel restrictions imposed under Stage 4 limited the ability to move around freely and safely.\n\nGlen Park Community Centre pivoted its Order and Collect service to provide food relief meal distribution, to help keep those in need fed during the challenging time for Victorians.\n\nThe Centre partnered with Eastland and launched the Eastland Order & Collect service in May, allowing customers to place an order directly over the phone at any participating Eastland retailer and collect on the same day from the convenience and safety of their car through the Eastland Valet area. A no contact option was implemented for those travelling by public transport via a separate collection point in the Valet area. This was a first for both Eastland and Glen Park Community Centre.\n\nThis partnership has allowed Glen Park to be able to connect with people in need who may not have known about or had access to Glen Park Community Centre previously, enabling more members of the community who may be struggling to gain support and easier access given Eastlandâ€™s proximity to public transport.\n\nSince the service launched almost 350 meals have been distributed to Maroondah residents in need and will continue to support the Maroondah community post this pandemic."
