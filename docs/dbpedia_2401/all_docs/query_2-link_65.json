        "text": "Wow, what an amazing trip! We thought we’d have fun, we thought it would be action packed, but we certainly didn’t realise just how incredible it would be and how much we would enjoy it!\n\nDay 1\n\nAfter an early start at GW and looking smart in our brand-new tour tracksuits, we set off for Manchester. It was a long journey, but with snacks a plenty, plus a service station stop with a tasty KFC, we arrived safely and ready for our first trip to the Etihad Stadium, home of World, European and Premier League champions Manchester City.\n\nWe had the pleasure of taking part in the excellent stadium tour – something which turned out to be very informative and enjoyable. We started by sampling what it is like to sit in the stands before moving on to the home changing room. What an experience it was to see where players such as Kevin De Bruyne, Erling Haaland, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish sit every week. Miss Bowen was in her element and had to get a picture with John Stones’ jersey. The tour was finished off with a walk pitch side and alongside the dugouts where the genius Pep Guardiola takes his position – then onto the press conference room where we had pictures with the man himself!\n\nAlready a packed day, but we weren’t finished yet, we still had our games to play!\n\nWinton students were dropped off first with their stand in coach for the weekend Miss Bowen. U13 Winton side were playing a local Manchester club, nerves were showing in the first half and plenty of missed opportunities. Miss Bowen gave what can only be described as an epic team talk channelling her inner Pep. They went back on pitch, and it was incredible. The passing, moving, possession game and the press! We won this game 5-0 and it was brilliant to see the team play the way they did. Encouragement, teamwork and great sportsmanship.\n\nOnto Glenmoor who faced a tough game against a local side from the Denton area of Greater Manchester. It was a particular challenge as it was the against a team a school year older than us. The game itself was a back-and-forth affair with Glenmoor defending resolutely. It was Jazz W who found the back of the net first giving the team a lead slightly against the run of play. This gave Denton the impetus to attack to get back in the game and they did draw level just before the half-time whistle was blown.\n\nOnto the second half which was a very even contest that didn’t feature many chances for either side. Both teams were starting to tire and intensity had naturally dropped. It was here where Denton took the lead. A lesser team would have shut down – not Glenmoor. Despite relentless pressure and having to defend, Glenmoor stayed strong and attacked whenever they could.\n\nOur perseverance paid off and despite not having many chances in the game, Glenmoor scored a late equaliser. This was reward for the never say die, never give up attitude of this brilliant team. A hard-fought draw was earned, and a lot learned from playing against tough opposition.\n\nAfter a busy day, it was time to get to our Old Trafford hotel for dinner and lights out, along with a mattress move but that's another story......\n\nDay 2\n\nAfter having a wonderful Hilton Hotel breakfast, we made our way to the Etihad Stadium again, this time to watch Manchester City vs Everton. With our fantastic seats, we had a superb view of a Premier League game. The game finished 2-0 thanks to a brace from Norwegian striking superstar Erling Haaland. The game was thoroughly enjoyed by all – well except Mr Doyle, who watched his beloved Everton lose ANOTHER game.\n\nAfter the game had finished, we made the short walk to the Etihad Campus where both teams split off to take part in a training. We had the pleasure of using the incredible facilities, including the incredible indoor training centre. Both teams worked on their attacking setups and picked up some brilliant advice from the excellent Manchester City coaches. Despite some tired students and teachers, we round off the day with a fun trip for a game of bowling.\n\nDay 3\n\nDay 3 began with a very early start, up at the crack of dawn for breakfast, before heading off for another training session at the Etihad Campus. We were so impressed at the phenomenal work the students put in despite the busy schedule we had. We learnt so much from the training and it provided us with so many beneficial points to take back with us. After another morning of training, we headed off for our final few activities. Firstly, we visited the National Football Museum. With the history of football all in one building, it was a fascinating look into many aspects of the game including media, technology, equipment and trophies from past and present. Our final event was watching Man City U23s vs Wolves U23s and a glimpse at some of the stars of the future.\n\nWe had come to the end of our trip. It was an incredible weekend filled with everything you could want from a football tour – what a weekend!\n\nTWICKENHAM TRIP (MS DAVIES)\n\nOn the 14th March, the year 7 Glenmoor rugby team were invited to take part in the Love Rugby Initiative. The aim is to promote participation of girl's rugby prior to the forthcoming Women’s World Cup, next year. Only 30 school from across the country had the honour of being invited to this exciting day and Glenmoor was very proud to be amongst them.\n\nThe day started with a touch tournament held at the Richmond Rugby Club. We played schools from Liverpool, London, Birmingham, Berkshire. Initially, the team were tentative and apprehensive, but when they realised that we were very evenly matched with other schools their confidence grew! We finished the morning having lost 2 matches and won 2, but more importantly was the fact that we were playing as a team.\n\nA lunch of chilli and rice was then served in the club house, before we got into the minibus to make our way across to Twickenham.\n\nThe main event of the day was playing on the Twickenham pitch for the year 7 showcase. The National schools cup finals were being played throughout the day, and our mini tournament was taking to the pitch in between the U16 Boys final and the U18 final.\n\nIt was amazing to come through the tunnel and into the stadium which seemed so much bigger in real life than watching on the television. England Red Rose Amber Reed was pitch side welcoming the girls to the ground and cheering on play from the side line.\n\nOur first game on the Twickenham pitch was against a school from Worcester. They went ahead, but it didn't take long for the girls to be playing supportive running rugby and offloading the ball before being touched. When the game ended, we had won by one try. The second game was against a team from Somerset and as we were getting ready to kick off Harrow school supporters had filled the stand alongside our pitch. Angel S picked up a fumbled ball and was off running directly at the space and down the wing; it was amazing to hear the cheers of support that came from the stand all spurring her on! That clearly increased her confidence and she went on to score another 2 tries in the game, there's not many pupils who can say they scored a hat trick in Twickenham!!\n\nMr May was also delighted to have the opportunity to referee a match on the pitch and had polished his boots for the occasion.\n\nIt was such a privilege to have the opportunity to take the students on a trip like this. They played with great spirit throughout the day and it was a pleasure to be in their company.\n\nDUKE OF EDINBURGH SILVER PRACTICE (MS ANNETTS)\n\nWhat a fantastic start to our DofE expedition season...\n\nOn Thurs 21 March – Sat 23 March 16 students embarked on their silver Practice Expedition around the Purbecks. Walking over 16km a day for three days with all of their equipment on their backs; those hills must have felt like Mount Everest!\n\nThe groups worked really well to navigate across the Purbecks, taking in breathtaking views form Corfe Castle, Anvil Point Lighthouse and Win spit quarry. Navigating across different terrains before battling the cold winds whilst cooking dinner and setting up camp.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh aims to empower young people; to support them as they learn new skills, overcome obstacles, and build confidence and resilience. Well, these students have certainly done that with what they have undertaken and completed in their practice expedition. They should all be very proud of what they have achieved!\n\nWe are extremely excited for the 80 students that have signed up for Bronze award this year as they embark on their challenge and find out just what they can achieve next term when they complete their training day and practice expedition.\n\nTRUE MORTGAGES FINANCIAL WORKSHOP (MR LANAHAN)\n\nOn Monday 18th and Tuesday 19th March, our year 10 students were fortunate to undertake a financial advice workshop to educate them and support them with their future financial decisions. This workshop was delivered by Jess Baudry, owner of True Mortgages. During the workshop students covered many topics including:\n\n• The process for first time buyers, property prices and deposit amounts.\n\n• Types of jobs and corresponding salaries.\n\n• Typical outgoings for a first home, including costs of council tax, utilities etc.\n\n• Cost of renting vs the Cost of a mortgage.\n\n• Loan to Value - How the level of deposit affects mortgage rates available.\n\n• Your credit file, the importance of avoiding bad credit and how lenders view debt.\n\n• The power of saving and one small change like a daily coffee at Costa and how much you can save for the year.\n\nJess gave really positive feedback around our students' behaviours and in particular their attention and passion to ask questions. Within the workshop, students were asked to complete a quiz regarding the key topics, of which many students scored highly. A massive well done goes to the year group for how they have engaged with this workshop and a big well done also goes to Ben G for winning a £50 amazon voucher for his efforts.\n\nHouse Event: Around the World in Spring Term (Ms Brown)\n\nThis term students and staff have been competing to see which house could travel the furthest around the globe through exercise. All participants were completing a range of activities from running, cycling, swimming and even going on dog walks at the weekend whilst tracking how far they had completed their exercise.\n\nRowling House had a strong lead for the first 3 weeks of term remaining in first place and travelling all the way to France. King and Ennis house were also in the running being in second and third place but had not left Dorset. But by week 4 Wilson house had jumped to 3rd place with a total of 470km taking them all the way to the Netherlands! Attenborough house also crept up to first place in week 4 from joint last travelling all the way to Germany!\n\nAll was to play for in the final week of term! Will Attenborough remain in first place? Can Rowling reclaim the top spot? Will King and Ennis house travel further than England? All shall be revealed in tutor time on the first day back!\n\nHouse Update: Spreading Kindness with the \"Yours Sincerely Project\" (Ms Ringrose)\n\nWe are delighted to share the heartwarming success of the \"Yours Sincerely Project,\" a wonderful initiative where students extended messages of companionship to the elderly members of our local community who may be experiencing isolation and loneliness.\n\nStudents involved wrote heartfelt letters, offering words of encouragement, sharing stories, and asking insightful questions to form a bond with our invaluable elderly community. Through these small gestures, we were able to brighten the days and uplift the spirits of those who may be feeling disconnected from the world around them.\n\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to all the students who participated in the \"Yours Sincerely Project,\" as well as to Prama Care, for their invaluable partnership in supporting our local community. Students giving up their time have made a meaningful difference in the lives of others, reminding us all of the power of compassion and connection.\n\nHouse Update: \"Thank a Teacher Postcard Project\" (Ms Ringrose)\n\nThis term our \"Thank a Teacher\" Postcard Project went live, where students from Years 7 to 10 took the opportunity to express their gratitude to the dedicated teachers and staff members who have made a positive impact on their lives at the Academies.

Over 300 enthusiastic students eagerly stepped into the shoes of junior detectives, ready to crack the case wide open!\n\nThe atmosphere was electric as students immersed themselves in the intricate web of clues and suspects, showcasing their analytical skills and collaborative spirit. With determination and ingenuity, they pieced together the puzzle, unravelling the mystery one clue at a time.\n\nThe event not only sparked excitement but also fostered critical thinking and teamwork among participants.

The purpose of Ramadan for Muslims is to fast and abstain from things that are impure for our mind and body.\n\nRamadan is a month of worship, service, and spiritual development, every obligation is for our own benefit and comfort.\n\nZakat is one of the 5 pillars and in Ramadan, Zakat is encouraged and comes with many rewards. If they can, Muslims are obliged to give a charitable donation before the end of Ramadan.\n\nRamadan is a month for self-awareness and forgiveness. In Ramadan, Muslims should focus on worship and mercy from Allah, this is the perfect time for strengthening your faith as the Shaytan (devil) is locked up.\n\nDuring Ramadan, how do Muslims open and break their fast?\n\n1. Suhoor translates to ‘the last part of the night’ referring to the fact the meal is eaten early in the morning, before the break of dawn.\n\n2. Iftar is the meal eaten by Muslims to break their fast every day after sunset. It is Sunnah, meaning “the way of the prophet”, to break your fast with a cup of water and dates.\n\nEid-Al-Fitr\n\nEid-Al-Fitr is a 3-day celebration that marks the end of Ramadan. It is celebrated different in every culture but no matter your origin, the Muslim community comes together.\n\nSalat Al Eid is a prayer that’s prayed in the morning of Eid.\n\nEid is a day of celebration and joy. Many Muslims look forward to this day every year.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nCheck in with your Muslim friends\n\nAsk respectful questions about the practice and religion to show your interest and curiosity\n\nArrange to sit down in a different area during lunch where food is not such a temptation\n\nBe patient, gentle and kind\n\nRaise awareness of this month with non-Muslims (family, friends and relatives)\n\nNEW! Diversity & Inclusion half term restaurant night out\n\nThis term, we had a restaurant evening and it was a great event! The first restaurant was ‘Uncle Glenns’, based in Boscombe. It is a family run Caribbean restaurant, which has recently opened in the last year. Miss Ringrose and Mr Khetia have had the opportunity to taste the food and can certainly say, along with the Caribbean atmosphere and music, the food is true to its Caribbean roots.\n\nFuture events\n\nNEW! Diverse Sports Week (next half term)\n\nFor the second year in a row, we are hosting a diverse sports week within our PE lessons WITH 2 NEW SPORTS!
