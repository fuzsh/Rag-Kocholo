        "text": "I am so delighted to welcome you to the Victorian State Schools Spectacular.\n\nFor young performers, I know that the past couple of years have been especially hard\n\nBut in great admiration, you have not given up on your creative ambitions.\n\nFrom auditions late last year to rehearsals since February, you’ve all worked very hard to get here.\n\nThank you to your teachers, schools, tutors, mentors and – the most important support crew of all – your families, friends and carers.\n\nI know there are many proud people who care a lot about you cheering you on.\n\nThe theme of this year’s show is Time to Shine.\n\nThe production brings together about 3,000 students from more than 200 government schools.\n\nThe arts are such an important part of education in Victoria. The scale of the show, the diversity and expertise of the performers and acts, is evidence of this. This show is full of pride and culture with incredible First Nations vocalists and dancers, a Koorie choir and a powerful haka. The Spectacular shows the breadth of talent in Victorian government schools – from musicians, singers and dancers to circus artists, acrobats, skaters, and hip hop dancers as well as those behind the scenes in audio, lighting and stage management.\n\nCongratulations to everyone for a wonderful performance!\n\nThe Hon. Natalie Hutchins MP\n\nMinister for Education\n\nMinister for Women\n\nNeill Gladwin, Creative Director\n\nAward winning performer and director (Green Room Award and International Perrier Awards), Neill’s career encompasses Olympic and Paralympic Games ceremonies, comedy, physical theatre, opera, Shakespeare, films and television. Formerly half of internationally renowned comedy duo Los Trios Ringbarkus, Neill has directed productions for many of Australia’s major subsidised theatre companies, independent theatres and commercial presenters, as well as produced and executive produced for film and television.\n\nMessage from the Creative Director\n\nWelcome to the Victorian State Schools Spectacular 2022. To say the past years have been challenging is an understatement.\n\nWhile COVID has brought adversity, it has also brought clear realisation - realisation of the uniqueness of live performance, of music, of dance and dynamic group expression. Maybe Joni Mitchell was right…\n\nEach year we ask students to tell us what they want to sing, play or dance to in the following year. The songs that we saw coming in last year were clearly a product of a time of pandemic. We saw songs of sadness, loneliness and social cataclysm, but we also saw songs of friendship, of beauty, of caring for each other and ultimately songs of great energy and explosive expression with aspiration for new beginnings. This is the time to celebrate in this moment, recognising our ability to collaborate to make a unique event that is the VSSS.\n\nThis show is the celebration of togetherness, uniting in an energy that can only be found in sharing harmonies, the impulse of the dancers’ movement or the acrobats’ backflip\n\nEnjoy! It is time to celebrate that uniqueness, that shine.\n\nCreative Team\n\nSimon K Patterson, Creative Producer\n\nThis year is Simon’s 14th Spectacular and it continues to be one of his favourite annual events to work on.
