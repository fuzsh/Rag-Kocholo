        "text": "Ideas behind the work…\n\nMy art is an expression of how fragile balance is. Our greed envelops the land we live on, polluting and commandeering the environment in a careless and thoughtless manner. If this behaviour was adopted by nature – could our bodies withstand it? This artwork delves into the repercussions of our collective impact on the environment. The piece reflects on the fragility of the balance between humanity and nature, portraying a figure trapped in the invasive grasp of branches.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nLiving in an area prone to floods and storms, the constant change in the environment influenced my work. Witnessing a tree falling in my backyard triggered a profound realization about our impact on nature. This incident became a starting point for interpreting destruction into creation, highlighting the toxic relationship between humanity and the environment.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nThe environment was a significant inspiration, with a focus on studying leaves, spider webs, and the transient beauty of life, even in death. Australian musician Harry Permezel’s hauntingly beautiful songs provided a soundtrack for the sculptures, balancing melancholy with hope. Tove Jansson’s Moomintroll novels, with their eccentric creatures, served as a reminder of embracing hope in the face of challenges.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nUtilising found objects, polymer modelling clay, sticks, branches, and dead insects, the artworks embodied a fusion of synthetic and natural elements. Watercolour works and a small maquette guided the sculpting process, employing an additive technique for pliability. The incorporation of flora and fauna created a biome-like aesthetic, reinforcing the environmental narrative.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nConstantly learning new skills, such as using watercolour and sculpting anatomical features, proved both interesting and challenging. Stepping beyond my comfort zone as an artist was essential for growth. Embracing risks, studying anatomy, and experimenting with techniques led to the creation of captivating folios and works.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\n‘Ordinary’ challenges traditional female representation in the media and art, more specifically how women are objectified through the male gaze and the discomfort this creates for women. This is depicted through filming from the perspective of the male gaze, which is juxtaposed with the confrontation from the female character prompting audiences to question how they view women in art. The handheld camera, out-of-time side-by-side clips, and the male eye subject matter contribute to the uncomfortable mood, conveying the discomfort and fear felt by women.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nFeminist themes in art have always interested me as I feel I can connect and relate to the strong underlying social issues presented, so I knew I wanted to create a feminist piece. I wanted to produce something that really portrayed the discomfort and fear many women feel when being viewed through the male gaze, something that encouraged all viewers to question how they view women in art and the media and understand this discomfort.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nI was inspired by video artists Sue De Beer and Pipilotti Rist and their engagement with feminist themes as both artists produced works that challenged traditional boundaries of women representation in their own societies. De Beer’s use of techniques and processes inspired me, such as the split-screen technique and out-of-time side-by-side clips which contributed to her signature uncomfortable and eerie mood.\n\nFor the presentation of my work, I was inspired by the set design of Matilda the musical and Mickalene Thomas’ ‘Me as Muse’ which both used various CRT TVs.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nFor my work, I used a Canon 200D, newer LED lights, and a DTI RS3 gimbal stabilizer. In the production process, I utilized a handheld camera as well as close-up segmented shots of the women’s body to contribute to ideas presented. I edited all footage via Adobe Premiere Pro, in the program I was able to colour grade exaggerating the yellow and blue light in the clips creating the rich and powerful colours. Further, the program allowed me to position and order the clips to ensure they were slightly out of time with one another. To present the video onto the TVs I connected the computer to an HDMI cord, connected to an HDMI to RV converter, which then used an RCA cord to connect to the AV input of the CRT TVs. For the DVD player, I simply used a USB to present the video.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nI found learning how to operate old technology a big challenge, as many adapters and specific cords were necessary, and I ran into many issues. However, despite this, it was also very interesting to learn so much about how everything operates and was rewarding when it all came together.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nEssentially, the two works were designed to be exhibited as a pairing. The base concept is the inclusion of two individuals (one being the primary focus and the other being myself) and a dog. I wanted to create a work that could be interpreted in a range of ways, inviting viewers to draw their own conclusions from the images. These works explore human nature and the way we perceive others, reflecting that although identity and environments are interchangeable, they support each other when forming interpretations.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nMy works went through a very extensive development period. Initially, the works were incredibly different from the pieces that became my finals. However, the creative development aspect was one of the most exciting and fulfilling elements of the journey. I began by taking an old 2009 Sony Digital 4 Mega Pixel camera to various friends’ houses to capture them in their home environment. I soon recognized that I needed to intensify my focus on just two individuals, rather than diluting the core focus with too many different people featuring in the photographs. The two individuals featured in ‘Flora’ and ‘Fauna’ were both people I felt connected with at the time. To produce a composition with which I was satisfied, I continued to visit them in their home environment and photographed them numerous times using a Nikon D5600 digital camera and tripod. Some of the factors I drew upon that influenced the images were their unique personalities, their personal style, their interests, and the built environment.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nDavid Hilliard provided me with strong inspiration regarding the separation of subject matter in the composition. Hilliard focuses on one element in each panel, one critical area of the environment to show its symbolic value within the works. I was also influenced by the incorporation of himself and his own life within the works, and how he separated the individuals yet revealed a connection through placement and environment.\n\nShea Kirk became a strong influence later in my works, specifically for the presentation of the final prints. His use of black homemade nails connected with the dark elements throughout his monochromatic portraits. I felt this beautifully balanced the work while reflecting a casual quality. The goal was for my pieces to resemble posters, to not dictate the meaning of the work to viewers, but to let them determine their own meaning of each piece.\n\nI was also inspired by the changes in my relationship with others. How we are continuously growing, our relationships expanding and contracting. How we grow closer to people because we think they are a good fit for us, and how we grow distant from those who we grow out of.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nI used a Nikon D5600 digital camera, with an 18-55mm lens and Adobe Editing software. The artworks were printed on Metallic Gloss 260GSM photo paper using an Epson Inkjet printer. The fixing nails were comprised of the top of Black Upholstery pins and the stem of Blued Cut Tacks. Using hot glue and superglue, I combined these two materials to create bespoke fixing nails. Since the shoot locations of each of the works consisted of differing lighting environments, I adjusted aperture and shutter speed with the assistance of a tripod to mediate the light. This also allowed me to keep the natural light, shadows, and feel of said location.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nThe key challenge was transferring concepts from mind to paper. I could visualize the effect I wanted, so working through the process to externalize this was a lengthy period of trial and error. During the shooting process, I found myself at times overanalysing the scene or not providing enough guidance and support to those I was photographing. This resulted in images that felt messy and emotionally detached. Initially, I was focusing on too many people, too many connections. When I did alter my attention on the subject matter as well as my approach to the shoot, I found that the emotion in the artwork began to grow stronger.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nFamilial bond is a timeless and very important value. Although my siblings are separated through canvas, they are connected by the raw ochre backdrop drawn from our family home’s walls. The motif of a transparent glass bird captivates my subjects with the enchanting play of light through its transparent form—a unifying symbol celebrating children’s joy in life’s simple pleasures. The ability of finding joy in the simple things in life is natural for children but lost as they get older. I believe it is an important ability to exercise, so this artwork is to remind viewers to learn from children to be more curious and actively find simple pleasures life offers.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nDuring quarantine as well as recent events in our family, I was spending more time with my siblings. I realized the role of family heritage, how much previous generations affect the next generation’s way of thinking, and the importance of having strong, healthy familial bonds, especially between siblings. I was always captivated by simple, beautiful scenes of the everyday. I realized that this beauty was created by various effects of light through different materials, the way it creates textures, movement, nuances in colour, etc., that trigger the viewer’s senses. I looked at Rembrandt’s work to study not only the way he represents the effects of light but also how he used his materials to manipulate how light interacts with the painting itself and therefore better create the effects and moods in the subject matter he is communicating. For my artwork, I took my new realization of the importance of family with my fascination of the effects of light and capturing moods through light.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nLight: the way light reacts through space, its interaction with various materials of objects, how different colours of light can create different moods, and how to paint various effects of light how the eye perceives it.\n\nPortraiture artists like Rembrandt who can capture a mood or intimate emotion of their subjects. I painted in Rembrandt’s technique of layering opaque and transparent paints to depict texture,light and dark and space.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nFirst, I had to take photos of my siblings with my iPhone. Although I had a general idea, I let the photoshoot be quite loose so that the subject matter can build organically. After getting good photos, I made thumbnails and value drawings to decide on the best composition. I first toned my canvas with a yellow ochre and burnt sienna diluted with turpentine, then created an underpainting with more concentrated burnt sienna and Vandyke brown for the darker areas. After getting the values right, I started layering colors. Here I had to be aware of opaque and transparent paints. I used opaque paints for the skin and dress, but layered many different transparent paints on top to achieve depth, textures, and various effects of light interactions. A final glaze of Damar varnish was used in parts of the face, hair, and clothes creating a glossy effect to contrast with the raw background that had been left untouched since the very first wash.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nThe most interesting was definitely learning oil painting techniques of glazing, opaque and transparent paints. I liked seeing my technique grow over the year. Being able to study how light interacts with different materials, especially with the painting materials satiated a curiosity I always had. The most challenging was being meticulous about the nuances of colours to use and especially capturing a likeness to the details of my sister’s face since it was such a small area to work on. I had to scrape off the whole face area and start over again and again to get it right.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nThe idea behind this work was to utilise the elements of the subject matter in the photograph and create something more from it. My art series aims to employ digital manipulation to reshape reality, challenging perceptions. Focusing on transformative power, I divert attention from original subjects to emphasize intentional alterations. I integrate manipulated elements into film photography, maintaining a connection to the source. Drawing from Andreas Gursky, repetition fosters visual coherence, while black and white tones enhance clarity. The deliberate blend of traditional film and digital techniques adds depth, utilizing texture and geometric reflections, to challenge reality perceptions.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nMain influences behind this are Andreas Gursky and Victoria Siemer. Both photographers aim to transform ordinary landscapes into works that blur the line between reality and imagination. Gursky’s large-scale photography infuses his images with sweeping grandeur. The starting point of this piece was the transformative power of altering a singular image. The aim is to push the boundaries of perception. Within each artwork, the image undergoes a transformation with Photoshop. This intentional manipulation serves as an idea, inviting the question of the authenticity of what viewers see before them.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nMeagan Streader’s innovative use of neon lights in her installations, her ability to transform physical spaces into immersive visual experiences through the interplay of light and color, prompted me to experiment with warm color palettes and the incorporation of neon lights into my artwork.\n\nAndreas Gursky’s work and his use of digital manipulation to create extremely large-scale works of fictional photography that look unreal yet still comprehensible.\n\nGallery Dixon’s photography series, particularly “Venice Beach, California,” influenced my decision to focus on specific images, cropping them in a distinctive manner that introduced an element of distortion while still preserving their connection to reality. This approach encouraged me to explore the concept of ambiguity, where the subject matter might not be immediately apparent to the viewer.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nI focused on intentionally using digital manipulation to alter reality. Shifting emphasis from the original subjects, I directed attention to the transformative power of altering images with only aspects of themselves, inviting viewers to question the authenticity. I used Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom to enhance composition, lighting, and details, with repetition playing a role in creating visual coherence. Choosing film photography as the foundational material added grain for depth, complementing post-production tools for precise control. I found great ease in manipulating film as the consistent grain allowed the elements to blend fluently.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nWhat I found most interesting in working on all of these pieces was the extensive level of different versions and trials it took before finally settling on what would become my final, and how different it was from my original idea. I found it fascinating to learn how to cut and duplicate segments of the subject matter in a way that could be slightly believable while still distorting and creating fiction.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\n‘Backyard Sunset’ captures the dramatic vibrant cloud sunset, contrasting the dark silhouette of my shrub-filled backyard of Belmont. I wanted to capture the varying lights and colours which filled the space.\n\n‘Storm at Bells’ is inspired by a photograph taken at Bells Beach, Victoria. I aimed to capture the contrasting tones, from the bright foaming waves to the dark storming sky.\n\n‘Over the Hills’ showcases the calm winter glow present within the bright clouds of the hills of Ceres.\n\n‘Waterfront reflections’ is inspired by a photo captured of Corio Bay at sunset, aiming to capture the power held within the clouds.\n\n‘Botanical Doorway’ aims for a more impressionistic style, capturing the fine, intricate details of the Daylesford botanical gardens, from the Autumn leaves to the dirt paths’ indents, compacted into a small canvas showcasing the sheer beauty of the outside world.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nThe first artist who inspired me to follow an impressionistic impasto painting style was Melbourne artist Emily Persson. Her use of colour and texture is captivating, and her painterly Victorian landscapes resonate with me. I love the diversity of my local landscape, including farmland with rolling hills, the Surf Coast, the bay, suburbia, and surrounds.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nImpressionism and Expressionism art movements inspire me, particularly how Impressionists conveyed their reality/perspective of an environment by leaving visible brushstrokes on the canvas. Inclement and unpredictable weather patterns, and the juxtaposition of contemporary photographs and historic Australian landscape paintings in exhibitions like “Beating about the Bush” at the Art Gallery of Ballarat.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nI took my own photos with a Nikon and iPhone during different seasons and times of day to capture an ‘impression’ of the day and atmosphere. I used thick layers of oil paint applied mainly with palette knives, layering the paint heavily on the canvas to create impasto texture. Mixing analogous colours both on my palette and on the canvas board, only loosely blending the paints so that the strokes applied with my knife were visible. Due to slow drying times of oil paint blended with linseed oil, I worked in stages on multiple compositions.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nI found it challenging at times to mix the paint to get a specific colour and to avoid muddying the colours. To combat this, I ensured the thick layers of paint had fully dried. When completed, I realized displaying them effectively within a gallery setting on a wall in a salon hang would be difficult, so I chose to frame them for both practical and symbolic reasons. I used natural wood to connect the artwork series, making them cohesive and meaningful.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nShrine\n\nThese artworks delve into divinity and spirituality, exploring the profound connection evoked by rituals, adoration of objects, and time spent in certain spaces. The artist reflects on personal experiences, noting how specific acts, objects, and places foster a sense of connection. The artworks transcend personal associations to explore the universal power of all things to spark connection in individuals.\n\nA Prayer to the Urban World 1\n\nThis installation extends the exploration of divinity and spirituality, paying respects to urban spaces. Rituals, adoration of objects, and time spent in these spaces are examined for their ability to create a powerful and spiritual connection. The artwork serves as a prayer to urban environments, acknowledging their significance in the artist’s spiritual journey.\n\nA Prayer to the Urban World 2\n\nSimilar to the previous installation, this artwork pays respects to urban spaces, delving into the spirituality and divinity associated with rituals and adoration of objects within an urban context. The piece explores the profound connection that arises in these environments, emphasizing their spiritual nature.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nMy main starting points stemmed from mysterious elements, things not being fully understood, childhood memories, and feelings of connection with people. The theme of shrines, sacred spaces, and rituals was initiated by a list of ideas, allowing for an open-ended exploration without limitations. I reflected on personal beliefs and life experiences related to shrines, spaces, and rituals.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nI focused on the mysterious and incomprehensible elements of childhood memories and feelings of connection with people. Serve as primary inspirations, media, art, music, walks, exploration, and observations of the surrounding environment assisted me with my development toward my final outcome.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nShrine\n\nFound objects, such as fruits, wooden trays, ceramic bowls, worry dolls, incense, and personal creations using oil pastel, ink, cardboard, and paper.\n\nPersonal and meaningful objects are incorporated into the artworks.\n\nA Prayer to the Urban World 1\n\nVarious elements, including cut-up paper, drawings, a black book with tape, masking tape, duct tape, glad wrap, tin foil, staples, printed images, and urban materials found in the environment.\n\nA Prayer to the Urban World 2\n\nSimilar elements as the first installation, with additional materials like rusty bottle tops, metal pieces, plastic bottle lids, CDs, and a cardboard box.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nThe way in which my creative practice took over my life. I found myself totally and utterly absorbed in the creative process. I struggled to sleep or spend time doing anything else, which wasn’t always practical. My work was always on my mind, even when I wasn’t necessarily creating, I was noting down and applying things I heard and saw in the world.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nI have chosen to explore the anxiety of marginalized individuals, addressing the fears of feeling outcast from the community. ‘Self Loathing Poet’ featuring the masks, provides a tangible glimpse into isolation and self-alienation driven by the fear of societal judgment. My works aim to challenge viewers to reflect on societal alienation and the experience of walking alone.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nThe inspiration for my artworks predominantly stemmed from the American Halloween scenes of the 1930s and 40s. The black and white photographs featuring children in costumes and masks evoked a combination of provocation, terror, and innocence. In my own artworks, I aimed to modernise and contextualise the eerie and discomforting emotions conveyed in those images. Referencing homemade costumes, I adopted a more organic approach to creating my own masks, embracing imperfections and roughness.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nVipoo Srivilasa’s ‘The Marriage of Sang Thong’ collection served as a significant source of inspiration for its unique structural features. The anthropomorphic yet foreign nature of the porcelain sculptures influenced my own work.\n\nThe hauntingly innocent portrayal of American Halloween in the 1930s and 40s captivated me, influencing my aesthetic choice of crafting monster masks that blend wholesome human traits with fear-related emotions.\n\nThe mundane yet complex nature of modern life, where people conceal their true emotions and thoughts, also inspired my artwork.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nTo photograph the diptych ‘Self Loathing Poet,‘ presented as a self-portrait, I used an iPhone 14 Pro in ProRAW mode within a basement garage to create a sterile and inhospitable environment.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nThe most challenging aspect was executing my ideas with exceptional detail. A compelling and interesting facet was capturing raw emotions on camera. During the photo sessions, I was undergoing a deeply emotional period in my life. Portraying grief, pain, and vulnerability on film was daunting, forcing me to evaluate my readiness to be open about my mental state.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nEmbracing your own individuality is something incredibly important to me, a deeply comforting experience that I find difficult at times. Routine investigates my insecurities regarding individuality as well as the possibility of falling into the repetitive corporate world to gain monetary support in its ever-rising expenses. Routine showcases the clockwork, routine-based mind of the everyday corporate person. Fast, jarring quick-cuts, surreal imagery, and strong, immersive foley and sound design elicit a confronting and immersive experience. At breaking point, the subject matter expresses the necessity for individuality, the complexity of the mind, and the monotony of repetition.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nMy exploration started with my investigation of photography in the surrealist movement. This led me to discover surrealist photographers such as Man Ray and Philippe Halsman. Halsman’s in-depth study of his subjects and surrealist photographic style greatly inspire my work.\n\nIn 1949, LIFE Magazine commissioned Halsman to reveal the “mind of a poet” in his collaboration with poet Jean Cocteau. In ‘The Versatile Jean Cocteau’, Halsman gave Cocteau additional arms to reveal the subconscious, inner-working mind of the creative, revealing his identity. This inspired me to utilize the convention of additional arms in my video production.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nSurrealist photographer Philippe Halsman is a strong source of influence in my themes and style as I explore surrealist conventions and techniques. While Halsman’s intention was to reveal “the mystery of another human being” (Halsman once wrote), I seek to reveal the monotonous routine of human life in my artworks, in my urgent plea for individuality.\n\nEdgar Wright’s hyper-fast, tense pacing has informed me to adapt a greater manipulation of pace and timing.\n\nIn ‘Temple’, Melbourne-based artist Rel Pham inspires me to manipulate scale to construct a deeply immersive viewing experience and work in a digital medium.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nRoutine began with detailed planning through a series of mock-up sketches, storyboards, and shot lists. I constructed the egg and chicken drumstick using styrofoam, masking tape, air-drying clay, and paint, while also ‘ageing’ the boxing gloves with paint and sourcing all props and costume. Routine was largely filmed over an eleven-hour shoot in front of a green screen, utilizing green cloth to isolate arms for the additional limbs and shot on a Sony A7C. I edited Routine in Adobe Premiere Pro, using Blender to 3D model and animate the floating egg. All foley and sound design were recorded using Ableton.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nThe most challenging part of my work is the post-production process. Filming on a green screen makes every shot a VFX shot, keying out the green and collating all additional footage and arms was time-consuming and a process I was unfamiliar with.\n\nAs I wanted to create a hyper-immersive viewing experience, I recorded all foley and sound design in post-production. This allowed me to have unlimited takes without taking up unnecessary time in the filming process, allowing full dedication to each shot. Though this meant editing the sound to fit every moment, from each pen scratch to mouse click.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\n‘In Mother and Child Pt. 2 (trophy)‘, hair symbolizes the global idea that the relationship between a mother and daughter is so deeply rooted and strong between the individuals; however, my work conveys the idea that this is not always how it is.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nMy first inspiration artist was Polixeni Papapetrou, and she explored obscure tableaux blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, and this is where I first branched into my idea of exploring fairy tales and fables. Expanding from the relationship between myself and my own mother, I explored an intensely emotional telling of my personal story.\n\nI was influenced to portray my story in its true form from seeing and being constantly surrounded by society’s normal portrayal of a mother-daughter relationship and by seeing the difference in comparison to my relationship with my mother compared to my friends.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nArtists I was inspired by were Paula Rego, Caravaggio’s Medusa, and Polixeni Papapetrou; they all explored strong characters in their work correlating to women, strength, or fairy tales and fantasy. My own personal relationship with my mother inspired this work as it has been created from a personal retelling of my story and our bond., brothers Grimm, my mother relationship. Fairy tales from my own childhood inspired me through the surreal characters I created in my works and the idea of the wicked witch or evil stepmother often present in fables.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nSilk, shellac, paint, charcoal, etching ink, pigment powder, printer, impasto, brushes, and palette knives. I began my process by starting on my silk work and from there the paper version of my daughter figure created itself as it is made from the leaked materials on my silk to the paper underneath my workspace. The hair prints were made from hair I collected over my ACP course and using etching ink with mixes of shellac and ink with water.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nMy materials challenged me, and learning and trialling how to use them effectively brought many ups and downs. I had to learn the behaviours of the materials and ways I could manipulate them to convey my meaning and story appropriately. I loved to explore the many uses of my materials, such as wood shellac and using it not as a shellac but as a paint, and how combining shellac with my pigment powdered made the shellac opaquer and more thickened into a paint.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\n‘Sing it 2 Me’ offers a reflection of the balance of human life. By giving both the natural form and human-imposed ideals contemporary importance, I aim to position audiences to question the worth of these jarring concepts. What is the value in such modern constructs in the quest for innate peace and reconciling with our natural form?.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nMy works were birthed from my initial questioning of the relationship between hyper-contemporary amusements and the fundamental components of life. Through consuming social media content and reality TV while also feeling both a personal and cultural drive for groundedness, I felt this tension between the nature of existence and the history of man-made contrasts that cloud our lives.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nTracey Emin’s gestural strokes and expressive mark-making convey a kind of tenderness, a certain authenticity which I aimed to incorporate into my works.\n\nCaroline Polachek’s work, self-described as ‘bratty,’ inspired a trial of exploration in giving importance to seemingly ‘unserious’ ideas. Her song ‘Bunny Is a Rider’ made me question the value in self-centered ideologies and their relationship to the growing push for groundedness.\n\nIn terms of subject matter, David Rappeneaur’s illustrations adorned with Hello Kitty keychains, iPhones, and Instagram notifications informed the way I viewed such contemporary symbolism in a fine arts context.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nThe use of oil paint in ‘sing it 2 me’ involved free form strokes, with little direction other than intuition. This freedom aims to develop a fluidity to the piece, reflecting the fundamental natural components that make up life. On the accompanying paper piece I used a soft grade graphite pencil and pressed firmly with my hand, greeting rigid bold lines. These unconforming lines convey a sense of brattiness, a certain validating of ones own vanity.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nOne thing I found difficult when completing my works is knowing how much to leave ‘unfinished’ and which areas require further refinement. Often, I found myself clinging to certain components of works in the early stages; it was this fear of ruining a line that I liked which stunted progress.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nIn the creation of ‘Egmode or Eggmode’, I have been exploring language and the impact that language has on influencing our thoughts and culture. I became curious about the role and responsibility that linguists have. Exploring the morality of a ‘prescription’ or a ‘description’ based model of language. In examining the French institution of language “l’Académie Française,” I became intrigued by how the board ‘prescribed’ and ‘mandated’ which parts of the French language were continued or discontinued, rather than an English model which is more focused on the observation and documentation of language.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nArt creative practice: When establishing the idea of “translating” recorded conversations into a gibberish language that sounds like English, I was influenced by Italian songwriter Adriano Celentano’s piece ‘Prisencolinensinainciusol,’ in which the artist aimed to create a song that sounded like English to Italian speakers but was complete gibberish. I was intrigued by his playfulness and light-hearted approach to exploring a topic like language, which can be quite intellectual.\n\nTowards finalizing and refining the project, I was heavily influenced by “l’Académie Française” and created a film in which a board of ‘gibberish’ “linguists” discuss the inclusion of a gibberish word “eggmode,” as an exploration and subtle critique of this ‘prescription’ based approach to language.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nAdriano Celentano’s “Prisencolinensinainciusol” represents an immersion into the observational practice of listening to other people and their conversations. This is reminiscent of the work of l’Académie Française.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nI recorded, observed, and documented conversations I heard in public in my notebooks and on recording devices. Then I proceeded to transcribe these into a script-like dialogue with stage directions and other functions of a screenplay. I “translated” these dialogues into a conversation that sounded like English, although it was intelligible, by mimicking the syntax, diction, meter, and engagement of the recorded conversations, then replicating them with a similar combination of sounds. I then began to set up elaborate sets and props, as well as taking on directing, producing, and filming roles in the creation of the film ‘Eggmode or Egmode’.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nI found it most interesting how, during my exploration of language, I became increasingly curious about our own relationships to language and the people around us. Through observing language, I noticed its importance in building community and shaping thought. Additionally, I enjoyed expanding and challenging myself by experimenting with unconventional art materials in the project, such as coding and papermaking.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nGoverning symbol of a shed human skin to represent identity and the self as impermanent, multiplicities and in a constant state of flux, rather than singular and determined.\n\n‘Tattooed’ graphics imply the paradoxical embodiment of past selves within the present self, alongside the inevitable metamorphoses that evolve us into new identities.\n\nDissolution is intrinsic to evolution and vice versa.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nMy governing theme for the year was ‘Invisible Connections’, inspired by a very deep friendship I made last year which provoked me to explore how the existence of potent, yet intangible, relationships can be materialized. My experiments began with investigating how people comprehend connection in their relationships, strongly influenced by Jason Maling’s penchant for formally documenting the abstract human experience. Experimental interviews and activities were conducted, the findings turned into cryptic stickers plastered around the CBD to facilitate new invisible connections. Explorations then shifted towards other contexts of invisible connection such as conscious/subconscious, self/possessions and, finally, past self/present self.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nArtists/filmmakers who reconfigure mundane reality with absurdity e.g. Peter Burke’s nonsensical contraptions interwoven with social commentary; the disconcerting chaos of Eric Fournier’s surreal internet storytelling as Shaye Saint John; Jason Maling’s positioning of average people’s quotidian experiences as the mystical centre of a work.\n\nLocal magazines/zines such as Voiceworks that are conduits for the concerns and perspectives of other diverse young people, and their unique creative expression.\n\nSubversive music such as the industrial genre, where instruments are used in unconventional manners, jarring sounds/noises are reconfigured as music, and heavy topics can be approached with irony and humour.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nI used liquid latex, a large paint brush, Vaseline, scissors and my mum’s assistance in brushing 4 coats of latex (for desired opacity) over my entire body. I stood with my arms up to prevent sticking and smudging as each layer dried to be built on again. A large back slit allowed for removal, but due to painful personal error, my body hair had to be cut and left embedded within the piece. The graphics – or ‘tattoos’ – were drawn in 0.5 fine liner using the technique of stippling, where solely dots are used to create form, texture and achieve tone by being clustered either closer or further apart.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nThe most difficult part of this artwork was creating the suit in one piece. The process involved brushing numerous layers of liquid latex over my entire body, then cutting down the back to remove without ripping. Due to my own error in not priming myself with enough Vaseline beforehand, lots of my body hair was either ripped out or had to be trimmed with scissors to avoid ripping the piece – an extremely painful ordeal. The embedded hair was not particularly planned, but I enjoy the visual/emotional shock value and think it aligns very well with my conceptual ideas.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\n‘Obscura’ explores the interplay between digital technologies and historical artistic tropes, in order to critique the façade which artificial intelligence creates. The cinematic quality of the drawings attempts to communicate context, that the drawing is capturing an ephemeral moment of a much larger conversation rather than a single isolated frame. I have used glass, and AI to warp original photographs of my friend’s eye, creating an exploration of the uncanny valley esthesis created after something so personal and relatable becomes clinical and digitally processed. I explored voyeurism through incorporating the idea of the lens to discuss the panopticon-esque nature of digital surveillance.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nI was interested in the ways new AI software such as DALL-E interpret subjective material I have had a lasting interest in the ways in which perception and reflection have been represented throughout history, and within a contemporary setting this is often explored through ideas of voyeurism, so I incorporated the idea of the lens to discuss the panopticon-esque nature of digital surveillance. Ways in which a larger representation of a person can be communicated through a microcosmic portrayal, built around assumptions and preconceptions.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nI am inspired by the works of Amalia Ulman and the ways in which we present ourselves and how digital facades can alter this. Our presentation is so often superficial we have no way of knowing what is real and what is fake. Stylistically I am influenced by the dramatic lighting of Rembrandt, referencing historical artistic tropes in which the everyday was romanticized and exaggerated. In terms of perceptions and reflection I was heavily influenced by Jan Van Eyck’s Arnolfini portrait, and the way the viewer’s existence and position within an artwork can be directly challenged.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nI took photos on a small digital camera using reflectors and flashes to achieve dramatic lighting, and then I used coloured pencil on paper. I then used toned grey paper and soft layers of pencil with light pressure to build up to full pigmentation, and a white Posca at the end to add highlights. To digitally augment one of the images I used Dall-E and Photoshop to create false versions of the image.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nWhat I find most interesting is the persisting tropes and interests within art throughout history such as voyeurism and using art as a platform to challenge how we see things. Within my own drawing process, I found it really fascinating how the drawing comes to life only in the last few strokes and highlights.\n\nWhat I find most challenging is that the process of the detailed drawings can often become tedious, and I become engrossed in the process rather than the concepts behind the work which initially motivated me to create.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nMy last piece of this series is a bridge between my art creative practice series and the start of my art making and exhibiting series it is the beginning of finding a base in reality and a stability in life. Beige is uneventful, unworthy, unmade. Beige is the feeling of being unremarkable and wanting to do great things. Beige is the name of one of my favourite songs ever written. It is about living a basic, normal life and feeling a calling to do something great. To go to the wild and live independently, away from the crushing weight of society.\n\nSkiing is one of the most important part of my life apart from photography. It is the feeling of being free and able to escape. This photo was taken in the village of Mt. Buller. The bright complementary colours in the photo symbolise my complete comfort on the mountain. It was inspired by both Yoke Lore, the writer of the song ‘Beige’. And Jakara Anthony, Olympic Gold Medallist, and my favourite skier whose homeground is also at Buller. This photo was made as a comfort, a reassurance, so that even through the unknown, depicted by the fog every winter I can still go up to Buller and try not to crash on the park or break my leg going too fast.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nRichard Moss is and Irish photographer who uses infrared film that makes plants appear pink. This kind of changing of the natural colours is something that I did for every work in both series. His influence is most easily seen in Under A Dome with the reddening of the organic matter. Jimmy Chin is a rock climber, skier and photographer who takes photos in the most extreme environments on earth. I wanted to recreate this to some extent with the snow photos. Although I never expected to get into top arts, whenever I was creating a piece of work I always imagined it in the Top Arts space in the NGV.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nCreated using a camera and computer, colour manipulation was done in Camera Raw 15.0. Despite technical challenges, the process allowed for iterative refinement and creative expression.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nLimited storage space posed challenges with software crashes yet offered opportunities for growth. The ability to create authentically and evoke personal meaning was the most rewarding aspect of the series.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nEssentially, the two works were designed to be exhibited as a pairing. The base concept is the inclusion of two individuals (one being the primary focus and the other being myself) and a dog. I wanted to create a work that could be interpreted in a range of ways, inviting viewers to draw their own conclusions from the images. These works explore human nature and the way we perceive others, reflecting that although identity and environments are interchangeable, they support each other when forming interpretations.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nMy works went through a very extensive development period. Initially, the works were incredibly different from the pieces that became my finals. However, the creative development aspect was one of the most exciting and fulfilling elements of the journey. I began by taking an old 2009 Sony Digital 4 Mega Pixel camera to various friends’ houses to capture them in their home environment. I soon recognized that I needed to intensify my focus on just two individuals, rather than diluting the core focus with too many different people featuring in the photographs. The two individuals featured in ‘Flora’ and ‘Fauna’ were both people I felt connected with at the time. To produce a composition with which I was satisfied, I continued to visit them in their home environment and photographed them numerous times using a Nikon D5600 digital camera and tripod. Some of the factors I drew upon that influenced the images were their unique personalities, their personal style, their interests, and the built environment.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nDavid Hilliard provided me with strong inspiration regarding the separation of subject matter in the composition. Hilliard focuses on one element in each panel, one critical area of the environment to show its symbolic value within the works. I was also influenced by the incorporation of himself and his own life within the works, and how he separated the individuals yet revealed a connection through placement and environment.\n\nShea Kirk became a strong influence later in my works, specifically for the presentation of the final prints. His use of black homemade nails connected with the dark elements throughout his monochromatic portraits. I felt this beautifully balanced the work while reflecting a casual quality. The goal was for my pieces to resemble posters, to not dictate the meaning of the work to viewers, but to let them determine their own meaning of each piece.\n\nI was also inspired by the changes in my relationship with others. How we are continuously growing, our relationships expanding and contracting. How we grow closer to people because we think they are a good fit for us, and how we grow distant from those who we grow out of.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nI used a Nikon D5600 digital camera, with an 18-55mm lens and Adobe Editing software. The artworks were printed on Metallic Gloss 260GSM photo paper using an Epson Inkjet printer. The fixing nails were comprised of the top of Black Upholstery pins and the stem of Blued Cut Tacks. Using hot glue and superglue, I combined these two materials to create bespoke fixing nails. Since the shoot locations of each of the works consisted of differing lighting environments, I adjusted aperture and shutter speed with the assistance of a tripod to mediate the light. This also allowed me to keep the natural light, shadows, and feel of said location.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nThe key challenge was transferring concepts from mind to paper. I could visualize the effect I wanted, so working through the process to externalize this was a lengthy period of trial and error. During the shooting process, I found myself at times overanalysing the scene or not providing enough guidance and support to those I was photographing. This resulted in images that felt messy and emotionally detached. Initially, I was focusing on too many people, too many connections. When I did alter my attention on the subject matter as well as my approach to the shoot, I found that the emotion in the artwork began to grow stronger.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nMy series of still-life paintings is titled ‘Row’. The ideas behind it include enhancing the everyday, nostalgia, sentimentality, and an individual’s personal perspective on the four seasons. Its purpose is to prompt the viewer into creating their own interpretations. For example, the position of the camera is from the side and very close up to the objects on the outside table, almost as if a child were peeking over and seeing it at eye level, squinting to avoid the sun in their eyes. The symbolism continues with the rippling of the water, the cherries rolling about, and the playing cards.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nI was greatly inspired by other talented still-life artists I followed on social media such as Alai Ganuza, Leah Gardner, and Victoria Jane. Their colourful, joyful, and impressionistic art pieces highlight the fun and elegance hidden within everyday objects. Alai and Leah do this through oil paintings while Victoria explores this through interesting photographic compositions. Nevertheless, all three attempt to view the world in new ways, by arranging objects, manipulating light, or enhancing the hidden colours and textures of their subject matter. Therefore, they formed the three research artists I consistently went back to throughout my year of art making.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nFirstly, films such as ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’, ‘Aftersun’, and ‘Only Lovers Left Alive’ were significant sources of inspirations as they all utilised the necessary world-building and atmosphere achieved through moments of still-life in cinematic shots. Secondly, instrumental music such as the emotional and melodious works of Jon Brion formed the basis of my nostalgic and comforting theme. Finally, the encouragement I received from my talented friends inspired me to try film photography and ultimately changed my perspective on art entirely.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nI chose to utilise the unpredictable but unique route of film photography for the references I would eventually paint. I meticulously planned and set up each scene with objects around my house before photographing with my Canon Sure Shot 105 zoom film camera. Once they were developed and I had crafted the wooden boards out of pine wood, I began painting with my 1980 Gamblin Oil Paints and Linseed Oil. I used colour theory to match the colours within the photos and created textured brushstrokes to distinguish each object.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nUnlike some other oil paint brands, Gamblin offers a smaller range of colours in very bright and naturally rare hues. Their pigments are extremely versatile and of excellent quality; however, colour mixing is therefore constant and unavoidable. Learning colour theory in a completely practical sense was how I came to find my own technique in creating colours unique to my paintings. For example, to get a certain more natural shade of green from the intense phthalo green, I now know that I need, in addition, red, yellow, orange, purple, white, and black in specific ratios to achieve it.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\n‘City of Lights’ encapsulates the landscape of a cluttered, south-eastern apartment in consequence of modern urbanism in our century. In this place of claustrophobia, pavement, and enclosed lives, the artwork examines all the intricate details of life. Yet instead of focusing on the horrors of urban life, the routines of each animated figure of the work remind us that community and life are ongoing. As the title of the work, ‘City of Lights’, suggests the medium projection’s light, it also suggests light at the end of the capitalistic, parasitic urbanization; that people themselves are light and we are hope.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nWho am I, where am I, what do I do to define myself by not just me? It was when realising my identity is tied not only to me or my connections but my environment. So, I combined the environment of my home country, Malaysia, with Melbourne’s city into my vision. If I have my own ‘home’ in a city, what do others consider for their own? This work, therefore, is my method to conceptualise a ‘home’ for myself and others, that whenever we feel lost in the burdens of urban life and its quotidian condition- we aren’t quite alone.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nReal-life case studies of existing cities were a major inspiration, from photographing the streets of Melbourne City to then investigating humanitarian urban matters like Hong Kong’s ‘Coffin Apartments’. My main inspiration was Kowloon Walled City, known as ‘City of Darkness’, which I reflected in my work’s title. Another main inspiration was the video game, Disco Elysium, which inspired the need to find beauty in the ugliness of a city. The movies, Wong Kar-wai’s works ‘Chungking Express’ and ‘Fallen Angels’, helped with south-eastern Asian imagery and the Japanese artist Yamagami Yukihiro inspired my medium of canvas-projection.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\n‘City of Lights‘ started with a digital composition plan I projected and traced onto cartridge paper, which then through gradual and steady processes drew in each apartment space referencing Kowloon Walled City and urban cities. This was done through 6B to 6H pencil, having a wide grayscale to convey the work’s realism. After the pencil on paper was done, the animating process was done through the app Procreate. Animating each figure in its own routine, I then finished it off by editing it all together as a single video to project it onto the artwork.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nI found the process intriguing in having to balance the digital animation through projection and then the pencil on paper— so neither overwhelms the other. It took some trials and using my own projector to compare and test the projection to then the pencil on paper. Both also must work in conjunction with one another, with the pencil being the stagnant and grounding component while the projected animation is energetic and moving. It was, however, challenging to then ensure both were presented as cohesive together, of one landscape together.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\n‘Self Portrait’ examines how a place may change over time, and how our perceptions of place may also change with time. Comprising both digital and analogue photographs taken by myself in Japan across the last 10 years, Self Portrait came together through a unique digital and hands-on post-production practice that refined itself across the unit. Very personal to me, the work explores my own perceptions of the country as both an outsider and frequent visitor, as well as my own coming of age. As the world in my immediate surroundings slowly loses its façade and mundanity seeps through, Japan holds its futuristic nature and brings me back to how I felt as a child: awe inspired.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nHaving previously worked throughout a unit to prepare for a final photoshoot, and then having images as the result, I flipped my process on its head this year. With an approaching trip to Japan, and the discovery of artists Jean-Vincent Simonet and Leiko Shiga, the starting point of my work this year was to arm myself with a wide array of photographs that I could then draw from and manipulate in a more hands-on and involved process. Shooting over 10 rolls of film in Japan, I had well over a hundred images to work from and became greatly influenced by my experiences there and what I noticed to have changed since my last visit.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nExtremely inspired by the writings of Susan Sontag and Paul Strand, this year I took great influence from art theory literature and became far more philosophically aware of the art I was creating, and my whole practice in general. Questioning the photographic medium and my own involvement in it, I used the learnings to strive in the creation of something different and something more meaningful. Another major inspiration for me was film and experimental cinema. Taking great influence from classical directors – Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jim Jarmusch – as well as modern films – Lily Chou-Chou, after sun– I studied composition in-depth. I’m also really inspired by photographers. Studying both traditional and new photographers, I worked extensively to break down the practices of various artists – most notably Jean-Vincent Simonet – to find and trial new techniques that can influence my own processes.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nShooting all my images on 35mm C-41 film, I captured various street photographs whilst staying in Kyoto and Osaka earlier in the year. I then worked through an extensive printmaking process that largely involved the unconventional printing of my original images to create wet and distorted ink pools. I then worked to recapture and recombine these textures with the original images through digital imaging software like Lightroom and Photoshop to create the ethereal and distorted works. I also experimented with printing multiple rounds onto a single sheet, as well as the use of clear contact (specifically in contact-blue) to capture bubbles of wet ink and utilize this. For Self Portrait, I combined this process with images gathered in Japan by myself across my last few trips there in the 2010s. The combinations were done by hand, in multiple layers of printing – and combined similarly in Photoshop. Once I had the works combined correctly, I worked in Lightroom across three weeks to nail down every single little colour pocket to ensure the works were in an optimal condition to present.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nI just loved being able to experiment throughout the unit and really having the ability to challenge myself. Having focused on photography in Unit 1 and 2 last year, I felt I was often limited in my capacity to explore whilst in the studio, often waiting repeatedly for my negatives to return. This year, my devotion to expanding my practice allowed me to get far more hands-on in the studio, often trialling a multitude of things at once to produce all sorts of art. Being very self-motivated, I challenged myself to the point of exhaustion – but the results far outweighed the torment I put myself through. Most challenging was the final assembly of works, after over a month of feeling on the brink of a great discovery, my trials hit a halt and I was finally able to bring it all together at the end after weeks upon weeks of trial and error.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\n‘Alexia’ depicts an extreme close-up portrait of a girl with her hand pressed into her cheek as she is squashed up against a pane of glass. I have adapted the themes of oppression and confinement, and flesh and manipulation. The themes of confinement and oppression are points of departure I have used to create my work. I wanted to include these ideas; however, I did not want to be extremely literal. Therefore, I used symbolism of the ‘glass box’ to represent male dominance over women and the oppression women have faced throughout history.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nIn creating this artwork, I was inspired by the works of Jenny Saville, specifically her painting “Propped”. I have drawn upon Saville’s themes of the extremities of human flesh and female oppression. I am brought back to my own interests in femininity when looking at Saville’s painting. While I do think Saville’s work can be interpreted by both males and females, being a woman, myself has enabled me to view her work on a much more personal level.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nBeing a creative individual, I am fueled by many different avenues as my inspiration. Personally, I enjoy visiting galleries and looking at many new artists, specifically realism artists on social media platforms. I also turn to film as a visual stimulant that encases my senses of sight and sound to convey meaning.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nTo create this work, I photographed my sister Alexia for a reference image. I did this by squashing her face against a glass pane then taking a black and white image of her on my phone. I then used Pan Pastel, graphite, and POSCA to depict the subject realistically in grayscale. I used the Pan pastel to lay the base, then graphite and Posca to enhance the details such as her lashes and white highlights.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nWhat challenged me most was conveying my ideas in a more symbolic way rather than literal. To do this, I developed the idea of a glass box representative of an oppressive confining world that females have endured and continue to endure. I find it interesting that while the subject is confined, she is still vulnerable and on display for everyone to see.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nFor this artwork, I aimed to reflect my experience exploring identity and mental growth over time. By painting a picture that depicts a wide range of patterns, colours, styles, and subject matter, I wanted to convey a chaotic feeling that represents the change and influence the world can have on one’s identity over time. I wanted this idea to be evident through both the title and the painting itself, purposefully leaving out unclear statements so the viewer can interpret the artwork in an individualistic way.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nI began the artwork by exploring a title before painting. After researching into Steven Rendall’s ‘Cadavor’, I similarly wanted to create an artwork that holds meaning in the connection between the title and physical work. I also aimed to create an emotive work; rather than having a central figure or focal point that can communicate the greatest amount of meaning, I wanted to create a splurge of colour and subject matter that can convey a ‘Chaotic’ feeling or aesthetic.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nPhilosophy (e.g., ‘The good life’, ‘personal identity’).\n\nArtists such as Salvador Dali, Peter Booth, Steven Rendall, Gian Manik.\n\nPop Culture (the bridge between fine art and skateboard/graffiti culture).\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nOil Paint on Unstretched canvas\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nPreviously, I had never used unstretched canvas. However, after completing my work, I found that it was not only easier to work on but gave much character to the overall aesthetic and feeling of the work. Additionally, my earlier works have predominantly focused on a central focal point; however, the busyness of this painting created difficulty in finding one. Yet, I soon accepted this and grew to like this new style I was working with.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nI have often struggled with feelings of anxiety and nihilism and really wanted to express my own subjective opinions on the subject through the lens of humour. The core beliefs of nihilism may be true but are also absurd, abstract, and unhelpful. ‘The Mascot for Nihilism’ is a humorous representation of the absurdity and pointlessness of nihilism. The way that a nihilistic perspective on life slowly eats away at your motivation and drive was represented through the metaphor of a giant creature that is reaching out to consume the world.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nWhat originally influenced my works was the video piece “the Aalto Natives” by two artists, Erkka Nissinen and Nathaniel Mellors. At the time, I was enamoured with the idea of using puppets and wanted to incorporate them in some way. The art piece was originally just going to be a prop for a short film which I wanted to make about a giant planet-eating monster; however, I grew to like the idea of it being more of an installation than a film.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nOld Marvel comic characters, like Galactus and Eternity\n\n“The Aalto Natives” by Erkka Nissinen and Nathaniel Mellors\n\nJim Henson and the Muppets\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nThe mascot was made from wood, polar fleece, cardboard, hula hoops, silicone, and my old clothes. I wanted to make the mascot be able to function as both an installation and a performance prop, with aspects like the fleece being the primary material used in making the Muppets. The milk crates, carpet, plastic, and video work were all ways to ground the installation in the real world and remove the disconnect between the artwork and the viewer.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nI found the most interesting part of the process being how my feelings changed over the course of making the artwork. I went from being proud and excited with what I was creating to being ashamed and disheartened about creating it, and finally returning to feeling comfortable with it towards the end.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nIt’s a playful exploration of institutions.\n\nWhile I positioned the project in ‘underdog opposition’ to Top Arts, both exhibitions (despite flaws on both sides) are ultimately doing the same thing: celebrating young artists. Bottom Arts is just an extension of that.\n\nIn my research for the project, I delved into the historical representation of different school sectors in Top Arts. Bottom Arts is, theoretically, a solution to the independent school bias by omitting the selection process entirely.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nThe idea initially sparked during a visit to Top Arts 2022. It’s natural to ponder about all the works the show can’t represent and then consider what a different exhibition could have looked like. The rest of the concept pretty much flows from there. I believe someone was always going to stumble upon this idea – perhaps someone already had – I’m just glad I had the opportunity to execute it.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nI was captivated by early modernist art manifestos for a while. That crowd was just fascinating. I highly recommend the Futurist Cookbook for the most absurd and insightful look into the rise of fascism in Italy. Agnes Varda is another source of inspiration for me; she embodies all the playful brilliance of other New Wave filmmakers without the ego. Additionally, I frequently listen to Betty Carter; her voice is truly remarkable. While none of this directly relates to Bottom Arts, it still ignites my passion for art.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nMy primary medium is emails – countless emails and phone calls. Much of the project’s promotion and development occurred online, showcasing the wide and rapid dissemination of ideas through social media, which continues to surprise me. However, I also established vital connections using physical methods like flyposting and word of mouth. It’s astounding how much of a difference dedicating an afternoon to putting up posters around the city can make – it allowed me to reach a demographic I wouldn’t have otherwise.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nEverything about creating the work was interesting and challenging. Particularly, I underestimated how difficult it would be to find applicants. Not all my methods were elegant. At one point, I discovered that you could gain slightly earlier access to the shortlist by editing the Top Arts URL, leading to two days spent researching every name for the most likely candidate and their contact details. I have a document filled with hundreds of links to Instagram accounts. I messaged a lot of Tom Martin’s.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nThe first in a series exploring memory and nostalgia. I made the artwork busy and closed in to imitate the cozy feeling of being inside a warm cabin in Winter. The idea behind this work is to use aesthetic qualities to create the same feeling of warmth and homelyness in other people that I feel when I look at any one of the things in this image. Firstly the colour theme is inspired by the Teskey Brothers Christmas EP album cover, the warm, natural colours of the cover and the music of the EP for me represent the togetherness of family. I knew I wanted to use our log cabin in my series as it has great significance to me and my family but I wanted to manipulate the image further than I had all year with just colour. So I decided to include as much as I could such as my skis, Mt Buller and my best mate.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nRichard Moss is and Irish photographer who uses infrared film that makes plants appear pink. This kind of changing of the natural colours is something that I did for every work in both series. His influence is most easily seen in Under A Dome with the reddening of the organic matter. Jimmy Chin is a rock climber, skier and photographer who takes photos in the most extreme environments on earth. I wanted to recreate this to some extent with the snow photos. Although I never expected to get into top arts, whenever I was creating a piece of work I always imagined it in the Top Arts space in the NGV.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nCreated using a camera and computer, colour manipulation was done in Camera Raw 15.0. Despite technical challenges, the process allowed for iterative refinement and creative expression.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nLimited storage space posed challenges with software crashes yet offered opportunities for growth. The ability to create authentically and evoke personal meaning was the most rewarding aspect of the series.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nI sought to visually depict the overwhelming and intense nature of anxiety as it mentally impacts someone. The figures overlaying linework and visual density, combined with the scale of the artwork in comparison to my central figure, depicts my idea of visualizing the internalized emotions of stress and impending dread. The surrounding maze indicates the trapped and isolated emotions of my figure. Depicting my figure’s point of view in yellow serves to highlight how despite the realness of the sense of dread, it is essentially imaginary.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nWhen creating my artwork, I was influenced to freely explore myself creatively rather than constrain myself to one idea or concept. Being able to express ideas, themes, and characters without being limited provided a unique opportunity to create art expressively. As a starting point, I thought the walls of a maze could produce a unique object for my surrounding figures to interact with. Besides this outline, the final product of characters was unknown and was a result of exploring themes which influenced my characters, like phobias, people, or animals.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nArtist Kim Jung Gi and their highly intricate and line-dense character works and environments inspired how I tackled my overwhelming and visually dense surrounding elements.\n\nArtist Song Kang’s use of cross-hatching and hatching to create a sense of depth in their artwork inspired me to create a similar effect within my characters.\n\nFinally, Artist Ch’ng Kiah Kiean’s limited use of colour to create a signature meaning in their work inspired me to integrate colour to create a unique point of contrast and produce intrigue within my artwork.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nI used a pencil to build up the rough sketch for my artwork, providing a clear guideline for me to work off while allowing me to visualize my characters freely before finalizing them in pen.\n\nAdditionally, I utilised Posca Pens to depict my figures and forms, creating bold and defined lines for clarity.\n\nVarying line thicknesses separated my foreground and background elements for the viewers, while cross-hatching built up a sense of form and depth within my characters.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nIt was interesting to see how organically my illustrations formed as I was creating them. Methodically constructing the figures, my illustrations became a product of my artistic creativity and the randomness of my own thoughts. Due to my insistence on a large scale, it was a very time-consuming process. Filling out the negative space with my figures became difficult as I would slowly exhaust all my ideas during the making process. As such, illustrating my artwork came in bursts of creativity and a lot of thinking, leading to upwards of 200 hours put into my work.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nMy artwork ‘Throw Me A Rope’ delves into the theme of connection in various aspects of life, symbolised through intertwining ropes that link each character within the piece. I aim to explore the dichotomy between our inherent connections with all living things and the prevalent disconnections observed in contemporary society. While every character in the artwork shares some connection, many appear detached within their peculiar environment. This, to me, serves as a subconscious reflection of our reality, where individuals often forget their connection to the broader picture.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nDrawing, a natural inclination for me, led me to challenge myself this year by understanding light and tone through fine liner techniques. Katarzyna Gagol’s approach to crosshatching prompted my exploration. Influences from surrealist artists like Salvador Dali and guidance from Stephen Gibbs shaped my characters and their interactions. Martin Liepziger initially inspired my use of coffee stains to form foundational shapes in my artwork.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nMartin Bells’ ‘Worthless, Priceless’ motivated me to undertake a large-scale drawing.\n\nMac Demarco’s dreamy instrumental songs from the ‘One Wayne G’ Album provided inspiration from a calm and subconscious place.\n\nThe cartoon TV show ‘Adventure Time’ has influenced my art style and thinking since a young age.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nSix vertically hung paper panels served as the canvas, onto which coffee was randomly thrown using the automatic chance technique. Ink, applied with 0.8mm and 0.4mm water-based fine liners, was used to develop characters and tonal value. Surrealism inspired the work, allowing the subconscious mind to guide the process and play with ideas emerging from almost accidental coffee stains.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nCreating the artwork was therapeutic yet challenging, consistently drawing from my subconscious mind to craft new characters and scenes within a substantial workload. The process was gratifying, setting a challenge to produce a large-scale drawing and witnessing numerous characters come to life on paper.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\n‘Duality’ being made up of two identical forms represents the idea of mutual coexistence. In that you cannot have one without the other such as light and dark or birth and death. Furthermore, this can be expressed in the idea of yin and yang, impossible for one to exist without the other.\n\n‘Limerence‘ is described as an intense infatuation or obsession with someone. This artwork highlights this idea through its two arches, one being smaller and the other much larger.\n\n‘Paradigm‘ represents a paradigm shift especially in the way that you look at a situation. The coarse exterior of the top portion of the artwork representing a more negative feeling, its sharp edges causing discomfort the same way only looking at a problem from one side may have a negative impact.\n\n‘Reflection‘ encompasses the idea of voids, the absence of substance in a space being the focal point. This empty space and the pathways around it often highlight both the fragile nature of the subject matter whilst preserving the notion of strength that concrete provides as a material.\n\n‘Sanctimony‘ takes inspiration from many forms of architecture, such as the arches seen throughout Roman architecture and the viaducts seen throughout Europe as well as coffin vault ceilings inside church and castle-style architecture.\n\n‘Vacancy‘ explores both a physical vacancy, in its hollow center. As well as a more metaphorical vacancy in the way emotional vacancy and absence can over time cut away at a person until there is nothing left, this notion being represented by the harsh circles cut into the sides of the artwork.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nAll my artworks begin as an idea that is either immediately fleshed out in a three-dimensional form or expanded and refined throughout two-dimensional sketches and drawings. More often it is the more complex sculptures that go through this refinement process. All my artworks are influenced by an abstract form of various architectural styles seen throughout the world such as the arches of both the viaducts of Europe as well as those seen throughout Roman architecture. As well as the prominently geometric stylings of the Art Deco movement.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nMy artworks are all inspired by other artists as well as architecture in the real world. My main artist influences being M.C. Escher in his wild and fantastical geometric artworks such as Relativity and Convex and Concave. David Umemoto was another influence for my sculptures, his body of work consisting of many large geometric concrete sculptures. Additionally, Art Deco and Brutalist buildings and architectural motifs as well as the arches depicted in Roman aqueducts and European viaducts have been a prominent influence on my sculptures.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nThroughout my artistic process this year I have used moulds to create the form of my sculptures. Often, they consist of an outer shell usually made from plywood or MDF and a dense cardstock or foam core interior structure that creates the details of the sculpture. This is followed by a wire support structure inside the mould acting as reinforcement for the concrete that is poured into it. To create the darker look of some of the sculptures I added various amounts of black oxide powder to make it much darker than the traditional grey of the concrete.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nI found it challenging to find a method of production that would provide sculptures with the uniform aesthetics I was aiming for. Once I had achieved this method it was then difficult to expand upon this to a much larger scale in the size of the sculptures as the weight of the increased volume of concrete mixed added additional challenges that had to be overcome. The concrete itself being an interesting material to work with due to its unconventional and somewhat unpredictable nature as an artistic medium.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\n‘cityloopz’ focuses on Cascina, who, while blocking out noisy transit with social media while waiting to meet up with Vidara, confronts more noise: irritating online misogyny. I challenge the best intentions of ‘just put the phone down’ because the internet is essential to everyday life. Young people must fight fire with fire; escapism to escape their escape (social media). Misogyny is never-ending, but a few seconds of funny dogs provided by Vidara relieve them of this; they can laugh and be. When reaching their destination, the video loops, emphasizing that this content is repetitive and never-ending, like their train route.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nStylistically influenced by cartoons like Samurai Jack, Clone High, and Total Drama Island, utilizing a minimal, shape language-driven art style but occasionally exaggerating movements for comedy and to communicate a character’s personality. Production art, character sheets, and background paintings from these shows were my best friend.\n\nMy experiences with online misogyny from when I was little to the present day.\n\nFrustration with contemporary male artists depicting women using social media as inherently vain and women as the face of ALL societal problems, flipping this idea on its head.\n\nUsing social media as escapism during lockdown, on transit with friends/family/myself to kill time.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nFilms/ TV Shows: Adventure Time, The Spider-Verse Films, Everything Everywhere All at Once, and the Italian series ‘Questo mondo non mi renderà cattivo’ (This world can’t tear me down).\n\nVisual Artists/ Musicians: Mauro C Martinez, Victoria Vincent (@vewn), Vincent Namatjira, Kelela, PinkPanthress, RXKNephew.\n\nEvery aspect of my social media feed, particularly X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, and TikTok, especially the comments section, quotes, etc. How we interact with content and what people decide to post, even the most random or hateful, interests me; what we collectively joke about online and the way we do it changes so frequently.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nI started straight with pencil to paper, jotting my ideas down and sketching out character designs and backgrounds, finalized in Procreate. Then I drew storyboards, laying out the story and composition of each shot. I painted the background in Photoshop, trying value mapping techniques and utilizing cohesive colours, texture. Some ‘screenshots’ painted in HEAVYPAINT. Every frame was hand-drawn in Procreate, occasionally copying frames to make minor tweaks. I’d frequently ask friends if they saw the same thing I had envisioned, then adjust for comprehension. I composited all shots and effects in After Effects, compiling shots, dialogue/audio, and colouring in Premier Pro.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nI almost spent 3 months exploring 3D animation as a medium but eventually went back to 2D due to familiarity and time crunch. I completely ditched my Year 11 animation workflow and switched to animate with Procreate on my iPad. Procreate is very difficult to animate with, from managing my colour and linework layers to frequent crashing. Even though I drew turn-around character sheets to keep on model, complex full-body movements longer than a second and keeping my characters uniquely expressive was challenging and laborious to animate, especially since my hands cramped a lot due to injury.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nInvestigating the ways in which conscious desires, fears and experiences can inform the subconscious and vice versa.\n\nElucidating the absurdity and irrational emotional origins of dreams by constructing a nonsensical object from one of my own dreams, in real life.\n\nOccupying space with an object that successfully functions and exists, yet serves no logical, productive purpose within this realm; in the dream realm however, this object evoked a profound emotional effect and attachment.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nMy governing theme for the year, ‘Invisible Connections’, commenced with an investigation into human relationships and how their intangible yet potent quality could be materialized, influenced by Jason Maling’s penchant for formally documenting the abstract human experience. I then explored other contexts where ‘invisible connections’ are present, such as self/possessions and eventually conscious/subconscious. I thoroughly enjoyed the nonsensical products and contraptions of Peter Burke, which often engage an audience in satirical abstract functions which appear futile but encourage meaningful reflection. This inspired me to consider sculpture or construction of objects as an art form that can achieve provoking results.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nArtists/filmmakers who reconfigure mundane reality with absurdity e.g. Peter Burke’s nonsensical contraptions interwoven with social commentary; the disconcerting chaos of Eric Fournier’s surreal internet storytelling as Shaye Saint John; Jason Maling’s positioning of average people’s quotidian experiences as the mystical centre of a work.\n\nLocal magazines/zines such as Voiceworks that are conduits for the concerns and perspectives of other diverse young people, and their unique creative expression.\n\nSubversive music such as the industrial genre, where instruments are used in unconventional manners, jarring sounds/noises are reconfigured as music, and heavy topics can be approached with irony and humour.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nI first constructed the box from scratch to my desired size using cardboard scraps and gum tape. All terrain wheels were removed from a trolley and attached to the box via a wooden rod going through the back. Thick bendable wire was used to create coat hangers, a rail and an antenna. Acrylic paint and black marker were used to paint the ‘dance floor’ on one panel. The video component was filmed on a 2000s Sony camcorder for an unpolished, bloomy, dreamy effect with stylistic zooms. Editing took place through Adobe Premiere Pro using music, sound, narration and cuts to orchestrate the desired dreamlike mood for the piece.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nThe most difficult parts of this artwork were finding the perfectly sized box I desired, which I ended up making from scratch out of scrap cardboard and managing tough weather conditions during filming. I wanted overcast conditions to achieve a gloomy mood for the video, but the on and off raining made us repeatedly cut filming to hastily cover the box with a waterproof tarp. The rain progressively damaged the box which needed constant repairs in between shots, and it also had to be transported to and from Altona via bus as I couldn’t drive at the time.\n\nIdeas behind the work…\n\nMy piece ‘There’s a Space in Me for You’ examines the relationship between natural forms of life and the imposition of man-made constructs and ideals. Through subject matter that positions natural components in relation to human-imposed constructs such as industrial buildings and fashion iconography, the drawing aims to assess the space that seemingly ‘vain’ or ‘selfish’ constructs take up in our lives, and their value in the constant strive for grounding.\n\nStarting points and influences…\n\nMy works were birthed from my initial questioning of the relationship between hyper-contemporary amusements and the fundamental components of life. Through consuming social media content and reality TV while also feeling both a personal and cultural drive for groundedness, I felt this tension between the nature of existence and the history of man-made contrasts that cloud our lives.\n\nSources of inspiration…\n\nTracey Emin’s gestural strokes and expressive mark-making convey a kind of tenderness, a certain authenticity which I aimed to incorporate into my works.\n\nCaroline Polachek’s work, self-described as ‘bratty,’ inspired a trial of exploration in giving importance to seemingly ‘unserious’ ideas. Her song ‘Bunny Is a Rider’ made me question the value in self-centered ideologies and their relationship to the growing push for groundedness.\n\nIn terms of subject matter, David Rappeneaur’s illustrations adorned with Hello Kitty keychains, iPhones, and Instagram notifications informed the way I viewed such contemporary symbolism in a fine arts context.\n\nMaterials and processes…\n\nThe process for ‘there’s a space in me for you’ involved many layers of graphite pencil that would eventually be erased to make way for a new ensemble of marks. This adding and taking away of components added a ‘used’ quality to the work. I also incorporated both soft washes of graphite, with a harder grade of pencil and paired this with a softer grade to provide a harsher contrasting mark.\n\nInteresting/challenging aspects of creating the work …\n\nOne thing I found difficult when completing my works is knowing how much to leave ‘unfinished’ and which areas require further refinement. Often, I found myself clinging to certain components of works in the early stages; it was this fear of ruining a line that I liked which stunted progress."
