        "text": "Today is Wednesday, Aug. 7, the 220th day of 2024. There are 146 days left in the year.\n\nToday in history:\n\nOn Aug. 7, 1974, French highwire artist Philippe Petit performed an unapproved tightrope walk between the two towers of the World Trade Center in New York, over 1,300 feet above the ground; the event would be chronicled in the Academy Award-winning documentary film “Man on Wire.”\n\nAlso on this date:\n\nIn 1789, the U.S. Department of War was established by Congress.\n\nIn 1942, U.S. and other allied forces landed at Guadalcanal, marking the start of the first major allied offensive in the Pacific during World War II.\n\nIn 1960, Cote d’Ivoire gained independence from France.\n\nIn 1964, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, giving President Lyndon B. Johnson broad powers in dealing with reported North Vietnamese attacks on U.S. forces.\n\nIn 1971, the Apollo 15 moon mission ended successfully as its command module splashed down in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn 1978, President Jimmy Carter declared the Love Canal environmental disaster in Niagara Falls, N.Y. a federal health emergency; it would later top the initial list of Superfund cleanup sites.\n\nIn 1989, a plane carrying U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and 15 others disappeared over Ethiopia. (The wreckage of the plane was found six days later; there were no survivors.)\n\nIn 1990, President George H.W. Bush ordered U.S. troops and warplanes to Saudi Arabia to guard the oil-rich desert kingdom against a possible invasion by Iraq.\n\nIn 1998, terrorist bombs at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.\n\nIn 2007, San Francisco’s Barry Bonds hit home run No. 756 to break Hank Aaron’s storied record with one out in the fifth inning of a game against the Washington Nationals, who won, 8-6.\n\nIn 2012, to avoid a possible death penalty, Jared Lee Loughner agreed to spend the rest of his life in prison, accepting that he went on a deadly shooting rampage at an Arizona political gathering in 2011 that left six people dead and 13 injured, including U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords.\n\nIn 2015, Colorado theater shooter James Holmes was spared the death penalty in favor of life in prison after a jury in Centennial failed to agree on whether he should be executed for his murderous attack on a packed movie premiere that left 12 people dead.\n\nToday’s Birthdays: Singer Lana Cantrell is 81. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is 80. Actor John Glover is 80. Actor David Rasche is 80. Former diplomat, talk show host and activist Alan Keyes is 74. Country singer Rodney Crowell is 74.
