        "text": "Item Description\n\n27-1/8x41\" one sheet poster for the original 1944 release of the 12 chapter Republic serial starring Linda Stirling. Made after the 1940 20th Century-Fox remake of \"The Mark of Zorro,\" Republic wasn't able to use Zorro himself, but still wanted to capitalize on it, so Zorro does not feature in this serial. The heroine of the serial is actually called The Black Whip throughout. This is for Chapter 5, \"Take Off That Mask!\" Poster features great image of Black Whip of rearing horse, whip in the air. Poster has been folded (now rolled) as issued and has pin holes at corners. Small pieces of aged tape along top/bottom margins w/some staining from pieces on back. Margins show wear w/some tears including large 9.75\" split along lower left fold line that has tape repair on reverse. 3.25\" tear at bottom center w/tape repair on reverse. Lower right has .75\" corner piece off. Fold crease intersections also show wear w/some splits having tape repairs/reinforcements on reverse. VG."
