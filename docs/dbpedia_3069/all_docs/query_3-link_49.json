        "text": "Cult-O-Meter: ★★★\n\nRating: ★★★ 1/2\n\nFeminist film criticism has brought to light many empowered women kicking butt and taking names in cinema’s first 50 years, but one genre that has proven rather barren for this kind of “reclamation” is the Western. Let’s be honest, folks: the Old West, at least as envisioned in the 1920s-1940s, was a man’s world. Long, tall cowboys duked it out with grizzled villains in black in a mountainous landscape full of dust, dirt, cougars (carnivorous felines, not older women), and exploding powder kegs. A gal wearing a full petticoat and corset couldn’t reasonably be expected to leapfrog across runaway horses, and the average mustachioed villain could confidently say, with Jay-Z, that “he had 99 problems, but a bitch ain’t one.” Enter the exception to the rule: the masked, swashbucklin’ female known as the Black Whip!\n\nZorro’s Black Whip differs from all other Zorro serials and movies in two important respects: it doesn’t take place in colonial California, and Zorro himself is never mentioned except on the title screen. In merry territorial Idaho we set our scene, where a vote over statehood looms large, and the organized crime syndicate benefitting from disorganized lawlessness looms even larger. Local newspaperman Randolph Meredith fights back against the crooks as the masked gunslinger known as the Black Whip, but his career as a serial hero is cut short when low-down coyotes fill him full of lead in the first episode. The mantle, mask, and costume of the Black Whip are then taken up by his sister, Barbara Meredith. (This is a lucky development for Idaho, as she is far better at it than her hapless bro.) Extra help arrives in the form of a handsome, undercover federal agent named Vick Gordon, but the same big problem remains: the secret head of the crime syndicate, Dan Hammond, serves as head of the territory’s committee to “stamp out” crime. With a foe who knows the heroes’ plans as soon as they are made, can the Black Whip and her indestructible but unlucky boyfriend prevail?\n\nZorro’s Black Whip is a 12-part serial, which, for those of you unfamiliar with the format, was the equivalent of a TV series shown at local cinemas in the pre-television era. For a dime or quarter, kids or adults could buy a bag of popcorn and a ticket to watch a half-dozen of these ongoing series. Each episode ended on a cliffhanger, which kept you coming back to the next installment, but they were also set up so that missing one or two of them never left you completely lost. Most were designed primarily for an audience of kids, so the morality is very straightforward and so are the conventions. Black Whip features plenty in common with its contemporaries: a cowboy-hero impervious to any amount of physical punishment unless you hit him on the back of the head with a hard object (is Vick missing a bone plate in his skull?); six-shooters that hold more rounds than a gatling gun, but seem to be loaded mostly with blanks; a scrawny, dastardly mastermind of a villain with a cool moustache; and more cliché local yokels, miners, and old-timers than you can shake a stick at. In fact, the only thing that makes this serial an oddball is the Black Whip herself.\n\nHaving a lady playing hero instead of distressed damsel forces the writers of this serial to tweak both the way the action goes down and the tone of the story. Unlike Vick Gordon, who gives and takes punches like a Rock-em-Sock-em Robot, Barbara never engages in fisticuffs. She deals most of her damage from a distance with a gun, and occasionally at mid-range with a whip that she wields like a pro. Said whip also allows her to scale walls like Batman and disarm crooks fast enough to give them whiplash. When forced into direct combat, as sometimes happens, the villains suddenly take a notion to tackle (and miss) “that mysterious masked man” rather than punch “him” in the face. For her part, the Black Whip seems to have perfected some kind of Western judo-throw that gets her out of scrapes and lets her return to long-range combat. It may sound forced on paper, but it actually makes for pretty compelling action on screen. The serial also displays well-directed, subtle tenderness in the scenes where the Black Whip checks on Vick Gordon after his mishaps; without a word said, you can tell she really cares about this guy, but she also exudes enough badassery to keep viewers from considering it mushy.\n\nThis last point is important, and it leads to the interesting question of “target audience” that this serial brings up. I could be wrong, but I think it was trying to not alienate the Western serial’s bread and butter (young boys, who would be mostly interested in Vick Gordon’s brawls) while engaging an untapped market of Western-loving tomboys. You know – the kind of little girls who, when “playing western” with little boys in the 1940s, would finally get frustrated and say, “Screw this bonnet. I want a gun and horse, too!” At the same time, Zorro’s Black Whip features more than enough adult-oriented elements to raise an eyebrow. Masks, black clothes, and whips? Women tied up, with ropes strategically arranged around the chest? Pantalooned females lashing males into submission? And then there’s that scene in “Fatal Gold” where Barbara is making some interesting motions with her fingers and a rolled-up newspaper as she invites Vick over for dinner. “Yeah, big boy, I got your covered dish right here.” (I kid. This show is pretty innocent. I think.)\n\nOverall, I have to give Zorro’s Black Whip a thumbs-up and hearty recommendation. It shares most of the same quirks and pitfalls endemic to its genre: hit-or-miss acting, somewhat repetitive action sequences, and near-total lack of subtlety. Still, it’s a well-done representative of its type, and the quirk of a female Western hero in an age where that was so uncommon makes it unique, engaging, and fun. An interesting aside to end on: according to an IMDB reviewer, in real life Linda Stirling (the Black Whip) wanted to (and eventually did) become a college English instructor and wasn’t obvious Western material. Specifically, she had a hell of a time staying on a horse, a problem that dogged her throughout her long career in serials. Thankfully, she had the determination, courage, and character to stick with it, fitting traits for the only woman tough enough to become Zorro.\n\nAVAILABILITY:\n\nAlthough not well-known, this serial isn’t especially rare, and you should have little trouble picking it up for cheap. I personally own the “Hal Roach Studios” version and like it — the whole series plus another movie are all packed onto one disk(!), but the video quality is fine, and I had no trouble with it even from my finicky DVD player. The Roan Group edition is probably also a good bet, since their releases tend to be well-done.\n\nZorro’s Black Whip (Hal Roach DVD)\n\nZorro’s Black Whip (Roan Group DVD)"
