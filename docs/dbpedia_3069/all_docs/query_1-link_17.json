        "text": "A feminine take on Zorro! So it gives us something to remember Linda Stirling by. Besides that, this 12-part serial doesn't reinvent the wheel. Does however entertain and stays mostly as a positive experience through-out.\n\nBeen rewatching this old movie serial courtesy of Talking Pictures. the serial nature inevitably makes it a bit repetitive and i'm not sure why it's called Zorro's Black Whip as apart from being set around the same time period it has nothing to do with the Zorro character but it's good fun and Linda Sterling really was the first lady of these chapter plays\n\nA typical fast-paced Republic serial in which the lovely Linda Sterling assumes the role of a female, whip-wielding Zorro-style type (which is nowhere near as kinky as it sounds) in order to foil anti-Union plotters in Idaho. It's full of horseback chases and fist-fights (from which nobody ever acquires a black eye or split lip) and last minute escapes from peril, but although the title character is female, she often has to rely on nominal sidekick b-movie stalaart George J. Lewis to rescue her. And how nobody realises The Black Whip is actually a woman strains belief to the limit..."
