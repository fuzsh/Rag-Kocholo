Lewis - Illinois Veterans History Project\n\nGeorge J. Lewis (December 10, 1903 – December 8, 1995) was a Mexican-born actor who appeared in many films and eventually TV series from the 1920s through the 1960s, usually specializing in westerns. He is probably best known for playing Don Alejandro de la Vega, who was Don Diego de la Vega's father in the 1950s Disney television series Zorro. Lewis co-starred in Zorro's Black Whip (in which a Zorro-like character was a woman played by Linda Stirling) and had a minor role in Ghost of Zorro before starring as Don Alejandro in the Disney series.\n\nContents\n\nOral History Interview with George J Lewis Illinois Veterans History Project\n\nCareer\n\nDeath\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nCareer\n\nLewis broke into films in the 1920s, and his handsome presence led to leading roles in a Universal Pictures short-subject series, The Collegians. The arrival of sound movies came as a blessing for Lewis, who was bilingual. He spoke English without any trace of accent, and could play character or dialect roles of practically any ethnicity. His language skills earned him leading roles in Spanish-dialogue features, produced by American studios for international release. He also played supporting roles in Educational Pictures shorts.\n\nMost of George's screen work was in low-budget films, although he can be seen in a few major productions (in Casablanca he's an Arab peddler with a monkey). Some of his roles were sympathetic; he played the male leads in the 1944 serial Zorro's Black Whip and in the Vera Vague comedy shorts of the 1940s. Usually, George J. Lewis played villains in westerns and serials, chiefly at Republic Pictures. Cast as a sinister henchman, Lewis would carry out the villain's diabolical orders, setting death traps and ambushes week after week. The high point of Lewis's serial career was probably the 1945 Republic cliffhanger Federal Operator 99, in which he was the full-fledged villain of the piece, playing \"Moonlight Sonata\" on a piano while plotting crimes. Holding the heroine captive, the nonchalant Lewis asks the hero: \"What will it be? Cash for me... or incineration for Miss Kingston?\" He appeared in Three Stooges films as Vernon Dent's knife-wielding conspirator in the Stooge short Malice in the Palace, and its remake, Rumpus in the Harem. He was also featured with the Stooges (as George Lewis) in Hollywood's final two-reel comedy release, Sappy Bull Fighters.\n\nMany low-budget filmmakers scored successes in early television, and many familiar faces turned up in half-hour action fare. Lewis appeared in the first two episodes of The Lone Ranger which were \"Enter the Lone Ranger\" and \"The Lone Ranger Fights On\". He was a villain who helped betray a group of Texas Rangers and led them all into a deadly ambush, with the series star of course being the lone survivor. He played a Native American in an Adventures of Superman episode called \"Test of a Warrior.\" Lewis continued to work in dozens of TV episodes including Daniel Boone & Cheyenne until he retired in 1969.\n\nDeath\n\nLewis died of a stroke in 1995, two days before his 92nd birthday.\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\n1969\n\nFamily Affair (TV Series) as\n\nFrancisco Torres y Fiero\n\n- Lost in Spain: Part 3 (1969) -
