        "text": "Stephen Lewis, who has died aged 88, spent much of his long career playing variations of the character of Inspector Cyril “Blakey” Blake that he created so memorably in the long-running ITV 1970s comedy series On the Buses, his face contorted in a rictus of impotent rage as he muttered “I ’ate you, Butler” or “I’ll get you for this, Butler” at the slipshod and uncaring driver Stan Butler, played by Reg Varney. However, he first came to prominence as a playwright with Joan Littlewood’s leftwing Theatre Workshop, in the East End of London.\n\nAfter the success of Frank Norman’s award-winning Fings Ain’t What They Used T’Be, with music by Lionel Bart, which transferred from the Theatre Royal, Stratford, to the West End in 1960, Littlewood was looking for another vibrant slice of working-class London life. In the same year, Lewis, a committed socialist, wrote Sparrers Can’t Sing, which also became a West End hit and was made into a film, for which he wrote the screenplay (1963). It starred Barbara Windsor, another Theatre Workshop stalwart.\n\nOn the Buses came at the end of the decade, running for 74 episodes from 1969 to 1973 and spawning three movie spin-offs. After their success with The Rag Trade (1961-63), which also starred Varney, for BBC TV, the writers Ronald Wolfe and Ronald Chesney came up with the idea of another workplace-set comedy. The BBC disliked the vulgarity of On the Buses and rejected it, so Wolfe and Chesney took the series to LWT.\n\nLewis appeared in almost every episode and, with co-star Bob Grant (also a Theatre Workshop graduate), wrote several of the later shows. On the Buses was cliche-ridden, stereotypical, occasionally racist and totally sexist by today’s standards, but in spite of a poor critical reception it was wildly popular and the first movie version was Britain’s top box-office money-maker in 1971.\n\nVarney, a former variety comedian, and Grant played the driver and conductor whose days were spent trying to “pull crumpet” and thwarting Blakey’s best efforts to get them to work efficiently.\n\nLewis’s Blakey was a magnificently preposterous creation, hopping from foot to foot like an anguished crow, wild-eyed, seemingly on the verge of a heart attack or stroke, and with the jaw always set in that extraordinary grimace. In fact, the grimace became his stock-in-trade. It was there when he became a semi-regular in Last of the Summer Wine from 1988 to 2007, his Clem “Smiler” Hemingway being a sadder, more defeated version of the hapless bus inspector, and in Alexei Sayle’s Merry-Go-Round (1998) and Jim Davidson’s The Generation Game he was still Blakey – billed as such in the former and snarling “I ’ate you, Davidson” in the latter.\n\nLewis was born in Poplar, east London. His first job was as a merchant seaman, and he became enthusiastic about drama after attending Theatre Workshop productions. Members of the audience were often asked on to the stage to discuss with the performers what they had seen; after a few such sessions, Littlewood invited him to audition, and he joined the company. He made his West End debut in Brendan Behan’s The Hostage in 1958.\n\nTo claim that he alone wrote Sparrers Can’t Sing is slightly misleading: Littlewood’s productions always involved the actors improvising around a theme, but Lewis certainly came up with the idea and created most of the dialogue in this colourful and character-rich look at East End life in the 1960s, complete with crooks, spivs, corner-boys and streetwalkers. Much of it was in Cockney rhyming slang, London Yiddish and Romany cant. And when it came to writing a more structured screenplay for the movie, billed as Sparrows Can’t Sing, Lewis did a fine job, though it proved incomprehensible to American audiences and was released in the US with subtitles.\n\nLewis remained a political activist for much of his life, often campaigning with Tony Benn, who in his diaries described him as “very direct” and “extremely amusing”.\n\nAfter On the Buses made him a star, there was probably little else that Lewis – a competent actor though of limited range – could do other than embrace the typecasting of so potent a character wholeheartedly, though off-screen photographs show a relaxed, easy-going, humorous face: the scowling, squinting, grotesque Blakey was very much a mask.\n\nWhen On the Buses ended there was a sequel series, Don’t Drink the Water (1974-75), featuring a retired Cyril Blake moving to Spain with his sister, played by Pat Coombs. Lewis was also a regular in another public transport-based comedy series, Oh Doctor Beeching! (1995-97). Other TV appearances included Look at It This Way (1992), One Foot in the Grave (1990) and London’s Burning (2000).\n\nIn addition to his co-starring roles in On the Buses (1971), Mutiny on the Buses (1972) and Holiday on the Buses (1973), Lewis also appeared in much smaller movie parts, starting with A Prize of Arms (1962) and including The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins (1971), The Last Remake of Beau Geste (1977) and Adventures of a Plumber’s Mate (1978).\n\nPoor health – he suffered badly from arthritis – obliged Lewis to retire in 2007. He spent his last years in a nursing home in Wanstead, east London, where his sister Connie was also a resident.\n\nShe survives him, as do his nephew, Peter, and great-niece, Rebecca."
