        "text": "NOTE: HYBRID BLU-RAYS ARE NOT THE SAME FORMAT AS STANDARD BLU-RAYS BUT A SPECIAL FORMAT DESIGNED TO HOLD AND PRESENT 5-7 HOURS OF SD SERIAL CHAPTER CONTENT IN THE HIGHEST QUALITY POSSIBLE BY ALLOWING IT TO BE PRESENTED IN NEARLY UNCOMPRESSED FORM ON A BLU-RAY DISK.\n\nNOT ALL PLAYERS WILL BE ABLE TO READ THEM.\n\nPLEASE READ THIS ARTICLE BEFORE YOU ORDER A HYBRID BLU-RAY DISK.\n\nBlu-Ray and DVD media are both designed to hold 2 hours or so of content. And the average movie serial contains 3 1/2 to 5 hours of chapters; in the case of some silent titles with 3-reel episodes, maybe even 7 hours worth or more. In order to fit (especially) an entire 15 chapter serial onto a DL-DVD in SD or Blu-Ray in HD requires a great deal of video compression. And the more video is compressed, the less sharp or smooth it will look and the lower the quality of the sound.\n\nSince BD-Rs hold so much content (20gb worth), Hybrid Blu-Rays — SD files burned on a Blu-Ray disk — are actually the most practical way to burn a complete serial onto any sort of digital media because they can spread out SD video on their 20gb of space in nearly uncompressed form, which allows the data to spread out, results in a sharper picture, smoother motion, less grain, and very clear audio.\n\nThere's only one catch in the format, however, and that is that not all Blu-Ray players are equipped with protocols to be able to access the format. Despite the fact that the guy who sold you your Blu-Ray player told you it was \"top of the line,\" and that it would play anything, that doesn't guarantee it contains internal instructions on how to deal with SD video burned on a BD-R. Some players access the menus with no problem at all. Some will choke on the menu but allow you to play the files on the disk using the player's built-in menu, as one would play MP4 files on a USB drive, and some just don't know what to do and will not load anything. So it is necessary for you to have a player which have a built-in protocol which will allow access the Hybrid Blu-Ray format for video to load properly. And it's important you know about that before you order a serial in H-BR format.\n\nPLAYERS THAT WILL PLAY H-BR\n\nFORMAT DISKS FOR SURE\n\nIf you want to be able to be sure Hybrid Blu-Ray disk will load in a player you use, GET ONE OF THESE: We have confirmed that the\n\nSony BDP-X800 Ultra 4K HD Player\n\nSony BDP-1200\n\nSony BDP-s3100\n\nSony BDP-s5390\n\nSamsung BD-DS300\n\nSamsung BD-DS2500\n\nSamsung BD-F5100\n\nONN portable 100009768\n\nwill all play these H-BRs and pretty much anything else you put into them, and many are available on eBay for about $30. Some Playstation players will also will also play the hybrids without any difficulty.\n\nIf in doubt, and you want something that will play the hybrid disks for sure, order a Sony BDP-s3100 from eBay and hook it up into your system. You won't be sorry if you do, because you will be able to play anything you order on this page, which are many of the great Squadron restorations in the closest sound and video quality to the original restored transfers possible.\n\nTHE ROCKETMAN COLLECTION\n\nH-BLU-RAY UPGRADE\n\nFeaturing Tristram Coffin, George Wallace, Roy Barcroft and Judd Holdren\n\nTHREE COMPLETE SERIALS\n\nKING OF THE ROCKET MEN\n\nRADAR MEN FROM THE MOON\n\nZOMBIES OF THE\n\nSTRATOSPHERE\n\nAnd Extras:\n\nAll 3 theatrical trailers\n\nA mini-documentary\n\n\"The Origin of Rocketman\"\n\nAn interview with mega-collector Bob Burns, owner of the Rocketman costume.\n\n8 3/4 hours,\n\nSD video on Blu-Ray disk\n\nDisk is set up with 7 consecutive menus you can click back and forth through showing all files and will play through.\n\nJeff King dons the helmet and rocket pack and becomes the flying superhero called Rocketman, then Commando Cody of Cody Labs takes them over and journeys to the Moon to stop Retik, Ruler of the Moon from plundering Earth, then Larry Martin uses them in his fight against invaders from Mars.\n\nInfluenced by: Bulletman, for whom the original story in the first serial was written.\n\nInfluenced: Iron Man, The Rocketeer\n\nView Online Video: Chapter 3\n\nAVAILABLE NOW\n\nNote: This title is a Hybrid Blu-ray, a special format designed to present 5-7 hours of SD content with higher quality picture and audio than a DVD can contain. A Hybrid Blu-Ray is NOT the same thing as a Standard Blu-Ray and not all Blu-Ray Players are equipped with the protocol to read them. Do NOT assume your player will play it because you just wish to believe it has super-powers and can play everything. It might not, and if it doesn't, the problem isn't the disk.\n\nOrder this disk ONLY if you have a Sony BDP-s3100, Sony BDP-s390, Sony BDP-1200, Sony BDP-s5390 or ONN portable model 100009768 Blu-Ray player or another player you have tried playing a Hybrid Blu-Ray on and can load it."
