        "text": "What I watched: The fifteenth episode of The Gene Autry Show, a kid-friendly Western starring the titular singing cowboy and his sidekick Pat Buttram. “Gun Powder Range” was directed by George Archainbaud and written by Kenneth Perkins, with guest stars Gail Davis, Dick Jones, George J. Lewis, and Kenneth MacDonald. The episode originally aired at 7:30 PM on Sunday, October 8, 1950 on CBS, and is available on Shout Factory TV.\n\nWhat happened: We’re introduced to Jim (Jones), a dishwasher at a picturesque cafe who wants to be a “bad man” and carries a gun. After showing off his sharpshooting skills, a man from the “Red Wolf Bunch” named Chipote (Lewis) expresses interest in having Jim (Davis) join his gang. His sister Millie, a waitress at the cafe, tries to warn him about getting involved with a bad crowd. He gets passers by to bet on whether or not Jim can shoot 4 out of 5 silver dollars out of the air.\n\nGene and Pat ride into town, looking for the waitress, who has written him a letter. Along the way they run into a bank raid, and get into a shootout. One of the bad guys falls off a cliff and surely dies. The sheriff, Jack (MacDonald), suspects that the Red Wolf gang planned the raid, and used Tim’s shooting show as a distraction. The sister protests his innocence, but Jack arrests him anyways. Tim puts up a fight and escapes.\n\nMillie meets up with Gene, and we learn that she wrote him a letter to try to talk some sense into the adventure-hungry Tim. Gene hasn’t seen him since he was 5, but he is very persuasive. Gene and Pat catch up with Tim entering a cabin in the wilderness. They decide to teach Tim “what a bad man’s life is really like”, and Pat is very excited about getting to be evil for a change. Nonetheless, Tim quickly shoots off his hat.\n\nGene sneaks up behind Tim, but doesn’t draw on him. He claims to be a member of the Red Wolves, looking to recruit him, but warns that outlaws’ lives are lonely and dangerous. Pat bumbles in, acting like he’s shooting someone. He’s already notched his gun to suggest that he’s killed almost a dozen men this season. Tim thinks this is very cool and agrees to walk the “outlaw’s trail” with them. Tim’s enchantment quickly dries up after hiking up a harsh trail with no water, in the name of trying to avoid the law. Gene sings about being in the middle of the desert without a drop to drink. Sounds like my dating life.\n\nMeanwhile, the real Red Wolves find out that someone else is going around using their water holes and claiming that they’re with them. Tim finds two famished men by the side of the road, and gives them his canteen of water. After he leaves, the Red Wolves get into a shootout with the two men and kill them. Gene and Pat laugh at Tim’s generousity. Sheriff Jack find Tim’s canteen at the site of the shooting and assume he’s guilty. They arrest our fake outlaw trio, fooled by the notches on Pat’s gun. Gene knocks out the officer of the law and takes off.\n\nChipote arrives with one of his henchmen to testify against the remaining heroes, and the law makes like it’s going to hang Tim and Pat right there on the spot, until Gene comes back with the surviving desert rat, who says that Chipote is to blame. The bandit leader flees, but Gene chases him down and gets into a shootout. Eventually Chipote falls down trying to climb some rocks, leading to his capture. Tim has learned his lesson, but still seems pretty trigger-happy.\n\nWhat I thought: This episode basically echoes the first Gene Autry episode I saw, “The Star Toter”. In that episode, Gene helps a young boy break away from the influence of his outlaw father. At the time I felt this was a refreshing change from the less character-focused Western stories I had been inured to from 50+ episodes of The Lone Ranger.\n\n“Gun Powder Range” revisits this premise, but with an older boy and a more action-packed episode. Instead of a wayward child with torn loyalties, Tim is simply foolish, and needs to be “scared straight” by Gene and Pat. It’s a pretty thin story, but it does have some moments, especially when Pat tries to impersonate an outlaw (perhaps the first time he’s actually been funny.)\n\nAgain, we see that, while the story is ostensibly about the need to keep on the straight and narrow, the forces of law and order are not terribly reliable. One piece of false testimony is enough to get the sheriff’s men to almost string up a teenage boy on the spot. When I was watching this scene I assumed that Gene and Pat had arranged this impromptu execution as part of their lesson-teaching plan, but apparently the sheriff’s department really are just this bloodthirsty.\n\nIn the end, the day is saved, but Tim still seems pretty unbothered. Maybe not everyone can be perfectly redeemed, no matter how many times you try to scare them straight.\n\nComing up next: I’m going to be presenting the long-delayed 3rd Golden Potato Awards, but after that it’s the KFO gang to kick off the week with Halloween Eve. They probably won’t call it Devil’s Night.\n\nWhat I watched: The sixth episode of the first season of The Gene Autry Show, a family Western. In addition to the titular Autry, the show co-starred Pat Buttram as sidekick Pat, with guest stars Barbara Stanley, George J. Lewis and Billy Gray. The episode was directed by Frank McDonald and written by Jack Townley, and aired on Sunday, August 20, 1950 at 7:00 PM on CBS. It is now available on DVD and the Internet Archive.\n\nWhat happened: Autry is introduced as “America’s Favorite Cowboy”, a clear shot across the bow to our masked friend. We see Autry help to herd some cattle and sing “Back in the Saddle Again.” After he’s finished the song, two guys show up to tell him that some outlaws have robbed a nearby bank and killed the sheriff. Gene is the sheriff’s deputy, so it’s his job to bring them to justice.\n\nThere’s an unconvincing-looking horseback chase, and they catch up to the pair. The bad guys hole up in a cabin and start firing, resulting in a shoot-out. Gene sneaks around back just as his sidekick Pat shoots one of the outlaws named Ben (Lewis). Inside the house, they run into a little boy who’s understandably very upset about his dad being killed. Gene eventually gets him to put down the rifle so they can take Dad to the doctor and then to jail.\n\nWith the adults taken care of, Gene sets his sights on re-educating the boy, named Jim (Gray). Pat and the others thing that the kid is just evil and sent to jail or reform school, but Autry wants to invite him up to his ranch. Meanwhile, the other outlaw tells Jim to be friendly with Gene as part of a plan to get his Dad out of jail.\n\nUp at the ranch, Gene is preparing a birthday gift for Jim, against the wishes of Pat: Little Champ, a smaller version of his famous horse. Pat tries to make a birthday cake, and some slapstick ensues. Jim takes off with Little Champ before the party can get started. He gets the new deputy to abandon the jail by telling him Gene is there for a cup of coffee (not a great moment in law enforcement), and passes a gun to his dad, with words of a plan to break out tonight. Just as he’s about to leave town, Martha (Stanley), whose role seems to be just to be the girl, comes up to give him a speech about the power of friendship, which seems to get through to him.\n\nJim returns to the ranch, and guiltily returns Little Champ to Gene. Gene convinces him that he doesn’t have to be loyal to his father, because Ben hasn’t been loyal to Jim by not raising him to be a law-abiding citizen. When Dad attempts to break out, Gene is there and gets in a fistfight with him. Jim ends up with the gun in the scuffle, and throws it to Gene. Ben uses the kid as a hostage, saying that he’ll kill anyone who gets in his way.\n\nGene reluctantly does what he says, allowing the man to rob the safe. But Jim stays behind and frees Gene. Ben also kills his accomplice. Gene chases him down on horseback, and the two horses are even briefly in the same shot. Gene finally catches up with the bad guy and tosses him off the horse. Jim holds him at rifle-point to break up the fight. All’s well that ends well, I guess.\n\nWhat I thought: Gene Autry was already established as a Western star by the time he came to TV. In particular, he was known as one of the foremost stars of the infamous “singing cowboy” sub-genre. I hadn’t seen any of Autry’s movies before watching this — somehow the singing cowboys are not among the Western films on film studies syllabi. But I tried to come into the Gene Autry Show with an open mind, and I actually ended up mostly enjoying it. There wasn’t even any singing outside of the opening sequence.\n\nThe show is a half-hour, family-oriented (read: kiddy) Western, and as such I can’t help but draw comparisons to The Lone Ranger. Compared to the masked man, Gene inevitably comes off as more human and mortal. When he gets trapped in a jail cell towards the end of the episode, it’s actually a little alarming, whereas with The Lone Ranger I would just assume it was all a part of the hero’s plan.\n\nThe plot itself is also a marked difference. As opposed to the mystery-oriented crime stories of The Lone Ranger, “The Star Toter” hinges on an emotional storyline of Gene trying to reform a criminal’s son. The story is undeniably crude and simplified — Jim is converted mainly because Gene gives him stuff and his father turns out to be an absolute scumbag. But it’s nice to see a character drama as the crux of one of these stories. Gene’s heroic trait here is not his shooting arm or rapid steed (although he has both of those) but his compassion. It is his willingness to trust Jim, against the advice of every supporting character, that allows him to foil the father’s plan.\n\nThere’s also an undeniably Oedipal edge to the plot. Jim has to choose the replacement father figure of Gene, representing law, order, social approval and all of that other superego-y stuff over his actual father. To do so, he has to prove himself willing to kill his father by pointing his rifle at him. (The phallic nature of the gun also seems relevant here.) In doing so, he rejects a crude and immediate patriarchy for the broader patriarchal force of social order.\n\n“The Star Toter” is an undeniably didactic story, with a lot of repetitive dialogue and speechifying about the sanctity of the law. But there’s something charming about its simplicity. If I end up getting the DVDs and watching all four seasons of this, I will no doubt start to be annoyed by this type of story. But for now, I’m interested in watching future episodes of The Gene Autry Show and maybe hear some more songs. And, good for me, there are several more first-season episodes available.\n\nComing up next: It’s a big night out on the town for our favourite puppets."
