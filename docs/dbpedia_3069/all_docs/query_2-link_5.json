        "text": "George Joseph Lewis\n\n1903 - 1995\n\nGeorge J. Lewis is a very familiar face to fans of the western and serial. Born in Mexico on December 10, 1903, his silent and sound screen credits number in the hundreds, and his Hollywood film work began in the 1920s and continued through the early 1960s.\n\nHe starred in the \"Collegians\" series of shorts for Universal in the mid to late 1920s.\n\nIn sound films, he often portrayed villains. He did play the occasional hero in serials including THE WOLF DOG (Mascot, 1933) and ZORRO'S BLACK WHIP (Republic, 1944). And he shows up in A grade films and even does comedy - one of my favorites is George's portrayal of the drunken \"Chief Iron Shirt\" in John Wayne's THE COMANCHEROS (20th Century Fox, 1961).\n\nLes Adams has Lewis identified in about 200+ sound era films, of which 82 are westerns and 25 are serials. Lewis worked in about 35 films at Republic Pictures from 1936 - 1951, and roughly half of those are serials. As with many of the B western actors, Lewis also did some shorts including the Three Stooges. And in the mid 1930s, he did a few New York stage plays.\n\nHe's a busy TV actor in the 1950s and 1960s in ANNIE OAKLEY, RIN-TIN-TIN, WILD BILL HICKOK, SGT PRESTON, WYATT EARP, GENE AUTRY, RANGE RIDER, ROY ROGERS, and many more programs. But his biggest television role was playing \"Don Alejandro de la Vega\", the father of ZORRO, on the Walt Disney TV show which starred Guy Williams.\n\nSome may recall Lewis as 'Collins', the double crossing scout who leads John Reid and The Texas Rangers into an ambush in \"Enter the Lone Ranger\", the first episode of the Clayton Moore LONE RANGER television program.\n\nIn his later years, Lewis was a real estate developer and property investor in Rancho Santa Fe, California.\n\nLewis' death certificate mentions that he passed away from congestive heart failure on December 8, 1995 at his Rancho Santa Fe, San Diego County, California home. He also suffered from Parkinson's disease. He was cremated and survivors were his wife Mary Louise, daughter Maylo, and two grandchildren.\n\nAlthough some of the data is incomplete or inaccurate, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) has information on George J. Lewis: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507221/\n\nDeath notice in the December 15, 1995 Oceanside, California North County Times for actor and real estate developer George J. Lewis. He was 91 years old and passed away at his home in Rancho Santa Fe, San Diego County, California. Survived by his wife Mary Louise, daughter Maylo, and two grandchildren.: https://www.newspapers.com/clip/110495179/death-notice-for-veteran-movie-and-tv/\n\nFind A Grave notes that George J. Lewis was cremated and cremains were given to family or friends: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7661876/george-j-lewis\n\nGoogle Maps of Lewis' home at 5465 Maravillas, Rancho Santa Fe, San Diego County, California: https://goo.gl/maps/QSBPSAWZucTAaA6L6\n\nYouTube has several of the Collegians shorts starring George J. Lewis and Dorothy Gulliver: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22collegians%22+%22george+lewis%22\n\nDaniel Neyer's \"The Files of Jerry Blake\" serial website has a webpage on George J. Lewis in serials: https://filesofjerryblake.com/serial-character-actors-2/george-j-lewis/\n\nThe New York Public Library has a 1920s photo of a very young George J. Lewis: https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47df-1489-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99"
