Croatian Parliament is a unicameral national legislature, defined by the Croatian Constitution as a representative body of the people, vested with legislative power. In 2021, Sabor was in its 10th parliamentary term, gathering 151 directly elected MPs, assisted in their work by the Staff Service, a structure ensuring continuity and maintenance of the institutional memory. This chapter aims to provide overview of the structure and main functions of Sabor's Staff Service in the observed period of March to October 2021, with analysis of main challenges and development tendencies. It addresses recent challenges, particularly issues arising from organization of parliamentary work during the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing swift digitalization that was essential in order to maintain the dynamic of Sabor's daily operations. The Republic of Croatia established a central Civil Service, to perform core business tasks in all state bodies. The Staff Service of the Sabor is established by the Standing Orders of the Croatian Parliament.
