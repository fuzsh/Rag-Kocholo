        "text": "INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORK OF THE CROATIAN\n\nPARLIAMENT\n\nImplementation of the measure is underway until December 2018\n\nLeader of the measure CROATIAN PARLIAMENT\n\nDescription of the measure\n\n47\n\nWhich public issue does the measure address? The measure responds to the issue of the outdated technical aspects of the\n\nCroatian Parliament website, its relevant presentation of information of\n\ninterest to the general public, poor search mechanisms of the content, and\n\naccess to information in open code.\n\nWhat does the measure include? The measure involves improving the website of the Croatian Parliament\n\nthrough technical improvements and redesign, and the addition of an\n\nelectronic voting system with the aim of simplifying multiple searches,\n\nfiltering and sorting, as well as overall better access to the content on the\n\nCroatian Parliament website.\n\nHow does the measure contribute to resolving the\n\npublic issue?\n\nThe measure will achieve the implementation of stable search mechanisms\n\nand integrate the contents of the Parliament website, while details of voting\n\nrecords by individual members of Parliament will be published on their\n\npersonal pages.\n\nBuilding up the web system will include many other new functions for\n\nsearching plenary sessions of the Parliament, its members and working\n\nbodies, by various criteria, with the aim of simplifying access to information,\n\nfiltering and sorting data, and downloading it in open format (for example,\n\nsearching members by surname, calling, party affiliation, electoral\n\nconstituency, term of office, ballot paper, members' clubs, gender,\n\nqualifications, education, duties, etc.). For the purpose of improving access\n\nto information on plenary sessions, the aim is to achieve swifter, more\n\nintegrated data searches with the option to download. In terms of working\n\nbodies, improvements will include the ability to monitor the work of a\n\nworking body according to the calendar, searching its documents more\n\neasily, and monitoring the history of its membership, etc.\n\nWhy is this measure relevant to the values of the\n\nOpen Government Partnership?\n\nThe measure is relevant to transparency, because it improves the quality of\n\ninformation published on the Croatian Parliament website and access to it\n\nin open format, and its reuse, among other things.\n\nFurthermore, it encourages the strengthening of mechanisms to control the\n\nexercise of public authority on the part of the public.\n\nAdditional information The totals costs of building up the web system and redesigning the website\n\nare around HRK 200,000, while the updating of the electronic voting system\n\n48\n\nwill be carried out separately, as part of internal development, and will\n\ntherefore require no extra funding.\n\nThe measure is in accordance with the e-Croatia 2020 Strategy.\n\nActivities Implementation start date Implementation end date\n\n7.1. Improve access to the contents of the\n\nCroatian Parliament website Underway November 2018\n\n7.2. Building up the electronic voting system Upon adoption of the Action Plan November 2018\n\nContact information\n\nPerson responsible in the body which is Leader of\n\nthe measure\n\nJasna Vaniček Fila\n\nFunction, department Advisor, Office of the Prime Minister\n\nEmail and telephone jasna.vanicekfila@sabor.hr, +385 1 4569 444\n\nOther\n\nparticipants\n\ninvolved\n\nState participants n/a\n\nNGOs, private sector, multilaterals,\n\nworking groups\n\nn/a\n\n7. Parliamentary Transparency\n\nLanguage of the commitment as it appears in the action plan:\n\n\"Measure 7. Increasing the Availability of Information about the Work of the Croatian Parliament\" [57]\n\n\"The measure will achieve the implementation of stable search mechanisms and integrate the contents of the Parliament website, while details of voting records by individual members of Parliament will be published on their personal pages. Building up the web system will include many other new functions for searching plenary sessions of the Parliament, its members and working bodies, by various criteria, with the aim of simplifying access to information, filtering and sorting data, and downloading it in open format. (....) For the purpose of improving access to information on plenary sessions, the aim is to achieve swifter, more integrated data searches with the option to download. In terms of working bodies, improvements will include the ability to monitor the work of a working body according to the calendar, searching its documents more easily, and monitoring the history of its membership, etc. (…) The totals costs of building up the web system and redesigning the website are around HRK 200,000, while the updating of the electronic voting system will be carried out separately, as part of internal development, and will therefore require no extra funding.\"\n\nMilestones:\n\n7.1. Improve access to the contents of the Croatian Parliament website The Croatian Parliament website improved by building up the web system in accordance with the Act on the Right to Access Information and linked to sublegal acts, relevant EU regulations, the recommendations of the Inter-parliamentary Union on parliamentary websites, and in terms of supporting access to information which can be reused (technological utilisation, open data, open code)\n\nData on voting by each member made available\n\nSimple, stable search mechanisms via xml web service implemented on the Croatian Parliament website\n\nOption introduced to download video recordings of plenary sessions of the Parliament\n\n7.2. Building up the electronic voting system\n\nBuilding up the electronic voting system completed\n\nInformation on voting by all members of Parliament made available\n\nStart date: Underway\n\nEnd date: December 2018\n\nContext and Objectives\n\nThe last major redesign of the official parliamentary webpage occurred in 2003. [58] Since then, Croatian Parliament has continuously worked developing its official web pages. From 2005 and 2007 when a new website was launched. The next systematic improvement of the web system was in 2011 and again in 2018. [59] This commitment arises from a need to align the parliamentary website with the provisions of the Act on the Right to Access Information, [60] relevant EU regulation, recommendations of the Inter-Parliamentary Union on parliamentary websites, [61] and the Open Data Policy. [62] The objective is to improve functionality and user-friendliness of the website to support access to information and reuse of data (technical use, open data, open code, etc.).\n\nThis commitment upgrades a commitment from the second OGP action plan, [63] which promised inclusion of the following functionalities in the new website: voting data for each parliamentarian, searches via XML web service, and downloadable videos of plenary sessions. The activities are specific and verifiable and will directly influence access to information, as they offer data that was previously unavailable, and it will be better organized for reuse.\n\nIts potential impact is minor, as a lot of parliamentary information is already available on their existing website, although in a less functional and user-friendly manner. For example, technical aspects are outdated, information is not presented clearly, search functions are poor, and data is unavailable in open code. Parliament members do not have their voting records available on their webpages and parliamentary working bodies do not publish their activities, membership, or discussion.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe IRM researcher suggests the following:\n\nDuring the redesign, provide a clearly visible link to an archive of the old website for continuity of data;\n\nEnsure API functionality in the new webpage;\n\nStrive for 5th star-level of data design when publishing data for reuse; and\n\nIn the next action plan, Parliament could commit to publish the \"legislative footprint\" of each MP, linked with lobbying activities and business interests, as publicized in their declaration of assets.\n\n[47] Editorial note: The text contained herein is the abridged version of the commitment.
