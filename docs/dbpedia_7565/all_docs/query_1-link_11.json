        "text": "Parliament name (generic / translated) Hrvatski Sabor / Croatian Parliament Structure of parliament Unicameral POLITICAL SYSTEM Type of political regime parliamentary Notes The Republic is a parliamentary democracy with a directly elected President as Head of State. Head of the executive Prime Minister Notes The President represents and stands for Croatia at home and abroad (Article 93, paragraph 1 of the Constitution). He ensures the smooth running of government and is responsible for the defence of the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic. The government consists of a Prime Minister, one or more deputy Prime Ministers and other ministers (Article 108, paragraph 1 of the Constitution). Method for appointing the executive The President is directly elected by universal suffrage (Article 94 of the Constitution). The person asked by the President to form a government proposes its members (Article 109 of the Constitution). The government takes office if it obtains a vote of confidence passed by a majority of all the members of parliament. Once this vote is obtained the motion to appoint the Prime Minister is tabled by the President and seconded by the Speaker of the parliament. The motion to appoint the members of cabinet is tabled by the Prime Minister and seconded by the Speaker of the parliament. Term of office of the executive and coincidence with the term of the legislature The President is elected for a term of five years, renewable once, while members of parliament are elected for a term of four years (Article 72, paragraph 1 of the Constitution). Elections for the members of the parliament are held not later than 60 days after the expiry of their mandate or the dissolution of the parliament. Incompatibility of the functions of member of the executive and member of Parliament Yes Cabinet members cannot be members of the parliament. Neither the Prime Minister nor any other minister may perform any other public or professional duty without the consent of the government (Article 108, paragraph 2 of the Constitution). Dissolution of Parliament Yes\n\nCircumstances\n\nThe parliament may dissolve itself in order to call early elections (Article 77, paragraph 1 of the Constitution). The President may dissolve the parliament in accordance with Article103 of the Constitution.\n\nModalities\n\nThe parliament can be dissolved if so decided by the majority of all its members. The President may, on a motion by the cabinet seconded by the Prime Minister and after consultations with the representatives of the parliamentary groups, dissolve the parliament if, at the proposal of Government, the parliament has passed a vote of no confidence in the government, or if it has failed to approve the budget within 120 days from the date it was proposed. The President may not dissolve the parliament if impeachment proceedings have been instituted against him for violation of the Constitution. In the last ten years, Parliament has been dissolved once because new elections were to be held. ACCOUNTABILITY Accountability of Government to Parliament Yes The government is responsible to the parliament (Article 114 of the Constitution). The Prime Minister and cabinet members are jointly responsible for the decisions made by the government, and are personally responsible for their respective competencies. Modalities of oversight\n\nOral and written questions of parliamentarians\n\nMembers of parliament have the right to put questions to the government and individual ministers (Article 86, paragraph 1 of the Constitution). At least one tenth of the representatives may submit an interpellation on the conduct of the government or any of its individual members.\n\nGovernment reports to Parliament\n\nNot available Measures\n\nVote of confidence on Government programs and/or legislative proposals\n\nImmediately after the government is formed, but not later than 30 days thereafter, the Prime Minister presents the government and its programme to the parliament and requests a vote of confidence to be passed. A vote of confidence may be requested by the Prime Minister at any time. If the vote of confidence for his/her mandate and the new cabinet is not passed during this period, the Speaker of the parliament notifies the President of the Republic of this fact. On receipt of this notification, the President then issues a decision to dissolve the parliament, and simultaneously calls for new elections. Motions of censure and votes of no confidence (sub-report)\n\nCircumstances\n\nA vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, in individual cabinet members, or in the government as a whole, can be tabled (Article 115 of the Constitution).\n\nModalites\n\nA vote of no confidence may be requested by at least one fifth of the members of the parliament, as well as by the Prime Minister. No debate or vote of no confidence may be taken before seven days have elapsed from the date when the motion was submitted to the parliament. The debate and vote of no confidence are carried through not later than 30 days from the day the motion was put before the parliament. A no-confidence decision is accepted if it has been passed by the majority of all parliamentarians.\n\nConsequences\n\nIf a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister or in the government as a whole is passed, the Prime Minister and his cabinet submit their resignation. If a vote of no confidence in an individual cabinet member is passed, the Prime Minister may propose another member to the parliament for a vote of confidence, or the Prime Minister and the cabinet as a whole may submit their resignation. If Parliament rejects the proposal for a vote of no confidence, the representatives who have submitted it may not make the same proposal again before six months have elapsed. Since 1990, 16 motions of no confidence have been tabled by the opposition. None has been carried.
