        "text": "The Croatian Parliament will be dissolved by 22 March at the latest and general elections will be held before the European Parliament elections scheduled for 9 June in Croatia, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nAccording to the constitution, the head of state, Zoran Milanović, will set the election date himself. However, according to the rules, the elections for the 11th convocation of the Sabor are likely to be held either on the last Sunday in April or one of the first three Sundays in May, as they must be held 30 to 60 days after the dissolution of Parliament.\n\nAsked whether parliament would be dissolved on 22 March or a little earlier, Plenković reiterated that it would be dissolved “by 22 March at the latest”.\n\n“The elections for the Croatian parliament will be held before the elections for the European Parliament. This is the last session of the Parliament before its dissolution,” Plenković told reporters.\n\nHe also said that he would lead the HDZ list in the first constituency, which, following recent changes to the electoral law, covers the central districts of the city of Zagreb and part of the surrounding area.\n\n(Adriano Milovan, Euractiv.hr)\n\nRead more with Euractiv"
