        "text": "The ruling majority’s motion to dissolve the legislative body received 105 votes in favor, well above the 76 that were needed. Eight MPs voted against the motion and four abstained.\n\nNow it is up to President Zoran Milanović to choose a date for the elections between four possible Sundays between June 21 and July 12.\n\nParliament Speaker Goran Jandroković said the ninth Sabor would be remembered for unity and solidarity in times of crisis. Citing some statistics about the ninth Sabor, Jandroković pointed out that it had more days in session than any previous one.\n\n“I am saying this to underscore that I believe we increased the dynamics of the Sabor’s work,” Jadroković said.\n\nAmong the key achievements that marked the four-year term, Jandroković named the law that put the struggling privately owned food and retail giant Agrokor under state-run management and legislation passed recently to address the coronavirus pandemic. Jandroković also spoke about Croatia’s six month term as President of the Council of the EU, which has been overshadowed by the coronavirus crisis.\n\n“Unfortunately we did not achieve all that we had planned because of the coronavirus situation,” he said.\n\nResponding to critics who have said this has been the worst Croatian parliament in history, Jandroković defended lawmakers, saying this parliament had passed very important legislation and made some key decisions.\n\n“I think, in that sense, this parliament has done its job. Our main job is to pass laws that benefit our citizens. In two important instances we dealt with the crisis at hand, that is, with the Agrokor crisis and the earthquake,” Jandroković said.\n\nHe believes the poor marks and generally negative public perception parliament has garnered is because of a loss of decorum driven by the inappropriate behavior of a number of MPs, which he did not name specifically.\n\n“Insults, hate speech and lies created a bad and inappropriate atmosphere that does not belong in a parliament. These were not incidents but became an everyday occurrence. The language of the streets, the language of comments on the internet, which most people are disgusted by, seeped its way into the Sabor,” he said.\n\nThis loss of decorum is what Jandorković believes is responsible for the poor marks MPs have received from analysts. He said he hoped that the next parliament would rise above this kind of behavior."
