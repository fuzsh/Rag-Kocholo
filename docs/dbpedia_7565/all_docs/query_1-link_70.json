        "text": "After a meeting of the leadership of the ruling HDZ party, Plenković told the press that they had made some important decisions for the dissolution of the current Sabor and for the organisation of the next parliamentary elections.\n\n\"We will continue with our current coalition partners, with whom we have built a certain level trust and cooperation, as well as a unified policy,\" said the prime minister.\n\nPlenković remains convinced in the power of the HDZ and its partners to once again achieve a convincing win at the elections.\n\n\"We look forward to improving the economy, the social standard, to raising salaries and pensions, protecting Croats abroad, and improving Croatia's international standing. Our focus is on Croatia and Croatians. This is what we guarantee moving forward,\" he concluded.\n\nThis makes the current parliamentary session the last of the current national legislative period.\n\nAnd while the president must set the date for the elections, the possible options are either the last Sunday in April or one of the first three Sundays in May.\n\nThe HDZ will hold its party congress on 17 March to prepare for the elections.\n\nFor the most part, opposition parties in parliament welcomed the news with open arms.\n\n\"This is just the first step; we will have elections as soon as possible. The second step must be taken by the citizens. It's time for them to say: enough corruption, enough lies, enough incompetence and enough HDZ. That's the only way to save this country. This country deserves better. Croatia deserves better. And we will achieve this after the elections,\" SDP President Peđa Grbin.\n\nSandra Benčić from We Can! said it was good news because it represented the perfect opportunity to take down the HDZ.\n\n\"This is good news for the citizens of this country, who can't stand this government, the stealing, the nepotism and the corruption. This is our opportunity for change,\" said Benčić."
