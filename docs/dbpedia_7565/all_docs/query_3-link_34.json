        "text": "Croatia became a kingdom in the 10th century and was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy, Ottoman Empire, and Venice from the 15th to 18th centuries. After WWII, Croatia became a federal republic within Yugoslavia. Declaring independence in 1991, Croatia faced a rebellion from Croatian Serbs supported by the Yugoslav People's Army and Serbia, with fighting effectively ending in 1995. For over a century, Croatian politics has been shaped by conflicts over national identity and the role of religion and tradition. These divisions evolved through critical historical events, including the formation of Yugoslavia, WWII and post-war communism, and the 1990s independence war. Croatia is an ethnically and religiously diverse country, with Serbs being the largest minority group, followed by Bosniaks and Roma. Discrimination against minority groups, including Serbs and Roma, persists in the form of hate crimes and hate speech. Bosniaks lack proper political representation, and several public figures have rejected Croatia’s position as an aggressor in the Bosnian war. This discourse, particularly acute in post-conflict areas, undermines progress towards reconciliation.\n\nThe Catholic Church, which represents Croatia’s most sizeable religious community, plays a significant role in society, with its influence shifting based on the political orientation of the ruling parties. The country has struggled with depopulation and massive emigration, and brain drain has been named as an existential issue in recent years. In 2024, for the first time in 15 years, Croatia’s population grew, as more people immigrated than emigrated. The surge in migrant arrivals created another significant societal cleavage, with the country facing accusations of mistreatment and pushback of migrants.\n\nCroatia faced corruption scandals involving political elites, leading to politicization of institutions, very low levels of perceived judicial independence, and dissatisfaction. This has been exacerbated by disputes over the balance of power between politicians and the judiciary. Concerns persist about the political independence of the Council for Electronic Media and the public broadcaster HRT, along with attacks and threats on journalists. Croatia is among the EU member states with the highest number of strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs), which are used to intimidate and pressure the press. In 2024, the ruling coalition passed a controversial law against whistleblowers.\n\nDespite high performance in Gender Equality and legislative progress, Croatia faces ongoing gender-based inequality, including harassment and violence, with persistent gaps in work, money, knowledge, time, power, and health. Abortion, while legal, is often inaccessible due to pressure from religious and neo-conservative groups. A 2013 referendum banned same-sex marriage, and discrimination and attacks against LGBTQIA+ individuals continue. However, there have been advancements, such as rulings allowing same-sex couples to provide foster care (2020), adopt children (2021), and legal actions against extremist vigilantes (2022 and 2023)\n\nLooking ahead, it is crucial to watch the Rule of Law, especially Absence of Corruption and Judicial Independence, given high-level corruption and accountability issues. Attention is needed for Freedom of the Press, given journalist intimidation and SLAPPs. Focus on Gender Equality, Economic Equality, and Social Group Equality is vital, considering ongoing gender inequality, barriers to abortion, and discrimination against minorities, migrants, and the LGBTQIA+ community. Lastly, Basic Welfare must be watched due to depopulation and brain drain challenges.\n\nLast updated: July 2024"
