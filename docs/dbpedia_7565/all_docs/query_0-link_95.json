        "text": "Guest Post\n\n11 September 2016 – dateline!\n\nCroatia: “Croatians vote for a new government – Again – The LIST goes ON”.\n\nCroatian Sabor election – this time with courage by Connor Vlakancic – 2nd generation Croatian-American in Zagreb\n\nA peculiar feeling to be a Croatian-American here in Zagreb this day of 11 September.\n\nYesterday was my birthday and I “investigated” Garden Pivovara in Zagreb as a potential another beer to import to Chicagoland HR diaspora. Only three months in production, GP sells in cans, not bottles…nice! We sampled all the products very carefully (LoL).\n\nToday Zagreb dawned like any wonderful day a sunup run around Jarun lake and then get-down-to-business…Sabor election Day. “We shall see what happens”.\n\nOn my way to the main voting station in Zagreb, I walk through Cvijetni Trg. Normal day, street performers in custom singing and dancing. All normal except for a Zagreb election observer, with badge, getting a picture. In front of Kino Europa, kava flows and so does the every-day-typical gossip…normal.\n\nHowever, a four minute walk, West, you arrive at 18 Varsavska Ulica. Here is Osnovna Skola elementary school. This is the main voting station in Zagreb (total is over 650 of them, mostly at schools). This one provides for Croatians from wherever is hometown but needed to be in Zagreb today. With their proof of registration voter ID card in hand, there were two very busy receptionists with computer access to voter records to direct the voter to a room (there were 11 rooms) that included the voters hometown. All the voters in all of the rooms got the same ballot. All the ballots were printed in Croatian only, In California the ballots are printed in nine different languages. Readers can decide what that difference signifies.\n\nThe voter folds their ballot and inserted into a box with a sealed lid. No computers involved, the ballots will be hand counted. Croatia, a nation of some 4.5 million people (not all who are eligible will vote [sadly] but still, that is a lot of paper-to-push.\n\nThe election workers awoke early and mostly on-station at 07:00 with the doors open at 08:00. Surprise, there were a lot of people waiting to vote. I inquired of them. Mostly they replied that they worked in a job at a cafe (or caffe) and so vote early first was their only option. I asked “considering the political situation in Croatia, economy and political animosity” why vote? The answer was always without hesitation: “I always vote, no matter anything else”.\n\nWalking to my car to retrieve my laptop to write to Croatish news good readers. A chance encounter.\n\nWith a small entourage of security staff, up walks President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. Like a regular sort of person, she bought flowers in Cvjetnik Trg. Despite her security staff, she was very approachable, I reminded her of our previous meetings in Croatian Embassy in Washington, D.C. of which she well remembered and I asked her election thoughts. She said: “We shall see what happens”.\n\nAnd so we shall. I will be attending the HDZ HQ to observe and report the election results as it is posted. Of course I will be discussing the US Presidential election, in term of voter turnout to be comparing to Croatian voter turnout, but certainly my vision of comparing a Sabor with a “bridge” over Croatia’s political chasm and my futuristic vision of a future US Congress of 200 Democrats and 200 Republicans with 35 Independent Representatives. Can the Sabor rise up to be the world-wide demonstration that this is a future that will resolve political rancor and deprivation. “We shall see what happens”.\n\nHere in Croatia this can be a splendid day to remember and celebrate. However, as an emotional Croatian-American, my personal conflict on September 11th is considerable. Soon, in America, the sun will arise over New York and 9/11 Ground “Zero” will again be first and foremost in the minds of all America an all Americans. Even here on election day, voting is what democracy is where the rubber-meets-the-road, we who are American Expats will gather together to remember that democracy costs a very large price tag.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nGuest post\n\nCroatia: “Horton hears a Who” or “The Mouse that ROARED”.\n\nAn epitaph of Croatian politics-as-Usual\n\nby Connor Vlakancic – 2nd generation Croatian-American in Zagreb\n\nHorton hears a Who is the story about an elephant with very large ears that he could hear peoples voices of a civilization so small as a dust speck.\n\nWhat of Croatian civilization and how loud the voice of its people? Is the Croatian proletariat simple minor meager squeaks of mouses or major mighty ROAR of a national legion of Lions? Planet Earth global politico has very small ears, how loud will Croatian voters ROAR on Sunday – September 11th, 2016?\n\nHere is preview of what could be world-wide headlines on the day after Croatian voters raise their collective voices.\n\n12 September 2016 – dateline! Croatia: “The Mouse that ROARED” is the story of a very small country that challenged the United States for global supremacy.\n\nCroatian SABOR (Parliament) election results stuns all the world’s democracies with its bellow of voters voices exceeding any other countries elections. Croatian SABOR elections greatly exceeds all expectations with such a voter ROAR that challenges The United States voters to achieve an equal percentage of voters at the election ballot box on Tuesday – November 8th, 2016.\n\nModern Croatia exploded onto the world stage with the international collapse of Communism. Yugoslavia government, long floundering for many reasons, disintegrated like all erosion’s reap upon forms of political heresy deprivations of natural human freedoms. Yet, Yugoslavia had provided a predictable existence. Even in its distant past – some say – that its people flourished. Certainly some did … a great many did not and their stories collectively simmered until the pot boiled over and Croatia, in all its heritage, bloomed like flowers in springtime. However, these flowers have withered and it is NOW time for Croatia to jump from the seeds that all Croatian freedom fighters have planted and nurtured with their sacrificed blood.\n\nThe price that beloved Croatian proletariat paid, all the inhuman suffering and social injustices – before the Homeland War and now many years after – bring the Croatian collective civilization to a chasm separating the “left side” and the “right side”. Since modern Croatia became a sovereign nation on 8 October 1991, voters have only known to be collectively suffering on one of the two chasm sides.\n\nGreat was the surprise on 8 November, 2015 (and dismay of HDZ and SDP intelligentsia that this election would be a “breakdown of its work”), that the Croatian peoples arose to no longer be subdued by the supposedly noble and meritorious stewardship of Croatia by one or the other of these two political parties.\n\nThe election was denounced and demonized by international political “experts”.\n\nYet, the emergence of a bridge over Croatia’s political chasm was not so much a disaster as it was an evolution of a national collective conclusion that bitter political segregation is not working for Croatia. That SABOR election was a surprise. Now, in this coming SABOR election “deliberately do it on purpose”.\n\nSunday, 11 September 2016. An angry and bewildered Croatian proletariat voter, feeling powerless, concludes: “I will not vote! I will show my anger by staying home! I don’t know which side to vote for! I raise my voice! Vote for Croatia!\n\nVote for Croatia! “Right, Left or Middle is NOT what is critical in this SABOR election. Every vote, however cast, is the voice of Croatians NOW to newly nurture the seeds that Croatian freedom fighters planted for all Croatians.\n\nDuring all these past years of Croatia’s independence, that the SABOR parliament has not totally eradicated every law of communist times illuminates that a “breakdown of its work” would be an improvement in its function.\n\nRemember when Zoran Milanovic and Ivo Josipovic declared the Presidential election to be held on Sunday, 28 December 2014. What could possibly be more so stagnant communist legacy than a Croatian election between Christmas and New Year. A pox on such mindset!\n\nAs the US Senator-Illinois Independent candidate, on 8th November 2016, with achieving my import of Croatian beers to the Croatian-American diaspora in Chicagoland, I envisioned my campaign to achieve in the US Congress (435 Members) House of Representatives, 100 Democrats, 100 Republicans and 35 nonpartisan Independent Representatives. I look for a political bridge in SABOR to lead Croatia and all Croatians into genuine democracy and thereby show US American voters how: Of the People – By the People – For the People can finally return to America for all Americans.\n\nA strong Croatia SABOR bridge could prove to be the vanguard political Shot-Heard-Round-The-World to launch the new world 3rd Millennium social justice. B+B=B : Beliefs + Believers = Behavior : VOTE to Make it So in Croatia!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
