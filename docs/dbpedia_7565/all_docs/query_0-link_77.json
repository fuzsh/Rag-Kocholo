        "text": "\"Sabor\" redirects here. For other uses, see Sabor (disambiguation).\n\nThe Parliament of Croatia (Croatian: Hrvatski sabor) is the unicameral legislature of Croatia. Under the terms of the Croatian Constitution, the Sabor[1] represents the people and is vested with the legislative power.\n\nThe Sabor is composed of between 100 and 160 members, elected on the basis of direct universal and equal suffrage by secret ballot, for a term of 4 years. Members' mandate can be extended only during a war. Seats are allocated according to the Croatian Parliament electoral districts - most representatives come from the Croatian mainland counties, but there are also some minority and diaspora seats. Currently the number of members is 153. 140 of them are from the counties, 8 from the minorities and 5 from abroad. The Sabor is presided by a President (sometimes referred to as Speaker or Chairman), who is assisted by at least one deputy president (usually four or five).\n\nContents\n\n1 Powers of the Parliament\n\n2 Composition\n\n3 Historical background\n\n4 Bicameral system 1990-2001\n\n5 List of Presidents (Speakers) of the Parliament\n\n6 List of Presidents (Speakers) of the Chamber of Counties of the Parliament\n\n7 Elections for the Parliament\n\n7.1 Last election\n\n7.2 Past elections\n\n8 List of assemblies\n\n9 See also\n\n10 Notes\n\n11 External links\n\nPowers of the Parliament\n\nThe Croatian Parliament (Sabor):\n\ndecides on the enactment and amendment of the Constitution\n\npasses laws\n\nadopts the state budget\n\ndecides on war and peace\n\npasses documents which express the policy of the parliament\n\nadopts the Strategy of national security and the Strategy of defense of the Republic of Croatia\n\nrealizes civil control over the armed forces and the security services of the Republic of Croatia\n\ndecides on alternations of the borders of the Republic of Croatia\n\ncalls referendums\n\ncarries out elections, appointments and reliefs of office, in conformity with the Constitution and law\n\nsupervises the work of the Government of the Republic of Croatia and other holders of public authority responsible to the Croatian Parliament, in conformity with the Constitution and law\n\ngrants amnesty for criminal offenses\n\nconducts other affairs as specified by the Constitution\n\nThe Croatian Parliament (Sabor) makes decisions by majority votes provided that a majority of representatives are present at the session.\n\nLaws which regulate the rights of national minorities, decision of crossing the borders or acting over the borders by the armed forces, altering the borders are passed by the Croatian Parliament by a two-thirds majority vote of all representatives.\n\nLaws which elaborate the constitutionally defined human rights and fundamental freedoms, the electoral system, the organization, authority and operation of government bodies and the organization and authority of local and regional self-government are passed by the Croatian Parliament by a majority vote of all representatives.\n\nEach representative of the Croatian Parliament, the parliamentary clubs of representatives and the working bodies of the Croatian Parliament, and the Government of the Republic of Croatia have the right to propose laws.\n\nMembers of the Croatian Parliament have the right to ask the Government of the Republic of Croatia and individual ministers questions.\n\nAt least one tenth of the representatives of the Croatian Parliament may submit an interpellation on the operation of the Government of the Republic of Croatia or some of its individual members.\n\nThe Croatian Parliament may form commissions of inquiry regarding any issue of public interest.\n\nComposition\n\nComposition as of 2011\n\nCroatian Democratic Union (HDZ) - 65\n\nParliamentary club of the Social Democratic Party - 55\n\nSocial Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP) - 54\n\nindependent - 1\n\nCroatian People's Party-Liberal Democrats (HNS) - 7\n\nCroatian Peasant Party (HSS) - 6\n\nCroatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja (HDSSB) - 3\n\nIstrian Democratic Assembly (IDS) - 3\n\nParliamentary club of Independents - 3\n\nindependents (former HSLS members) - 3\n\nCroatian Party of Rights (HSP) - 1\n\nCroatian Pensioners' Party (HSU) - 1\n\nParliamentary club of National Minorities - 8\n\nParty of Democratic Action of Croatia (SDA HR) - 1\n\nIndependent Democratic Serb Party (SDSS) - 3 [2]\n\nindependent - 4\n\nIndependents - 2\n\nHistorical background\n\nThe Croat nobles agreed to form two Croatian states after settling in the Illyrian territory in the 7th century AD, after the great migration of the Slavs. Their meeting and agreement over the issues important for the people is considered the foundation of Croatian parliament.\n\nCroatian counts and dukes later established a country and elected a king among themselves in the 9th and 10th century, but the legend says that they always made decisions as a group.\n\nAfter Croatia decided to elect Hungarian king as King of Croatia in 1102, these nobles formed a real parliament and their decisions had significant influence in the state politics. In fact, when the Kingdom of Hungary and Kingdom of Croatia lost its leader after the Battle of Mohács in 1526 when the king Louis II of Hungary died, the Croats gathered at Parliament on Cetin and chose Austrian archduke Ferdinand I. Habsburg for King of Croatia.\n\nIn 1712, the Croatian Parliament decided on the so-called Pragmatic Sanction, thus taking the side of Maria Theresa, supporting her to become queen of Hungary.\n\nIn the light of the Revolutions of 1848, Sabor decided to renew some of the country autonomy by exerting its power to all of the old Croatian regions and having the same ban govern them. In 1868 they negotiated a bargain with the Hungarians that regulated the ties between the countries in the new environment of Austria-Hungary.\n\nIn 1918 the Parliament decided to split off Croatia from Hungary, and join the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. However, the country's entry to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes that ensued was never ratified by Sabor, which was decommissioned.\n\nIn 1942, an unelected Croatian State Parliament was held in the Independent State of Croatia, a puppet state of Nazi Germany. It met for the first time on February 23, 1942 and was formally dissolved on December 28, 1942. Its president was Marko Dosen. The post-World War II parliament developed from the council of anti-fascists (ZAVNOH) formed in 1943. It functioned as the Parliament of the Socialist Republic of Croatia (as a part of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), until 1990 when Croatia regained full independence.\n\nBicameral system 1990-2001\n\nUnder the original terms of the 1990 Constitution, the Croatian Parliament was bicameral, comprising the directly elected Zastupnički Dom (Chamber of Deputies) and the Županijski Dom (Chamber of the Counties).[3] Such a chamber - which held a suspending veto power over legislation - was composed of 3 members for each of the 21 districts of the Country, regardless of their population. In addition, it included five members appointed by the President of the Republic and the former Heads of State themselves (similar to the Italian Senate). The Chamber of the Counties was abolished in 2001 with a formal constitutional amendment[4] and the Chamber of Deputies is now known simply as the Sabor.\n\nList of Presidents (Speakers) of the Parliament\n\nSince Croatian independence which was proclaimed on June 25, 1991 and entered in force fully on December 8, 1991.\n\nŽarko Domljan May 30, 1990 - September 7, 1992\n\nStjepan Mesić September 7, 1992 - May 24, 1994\n\nNedjeljko Mihanović May 24, 1994 - November 28, 1995\n\nVlatko Pavletić November 28, 1995 - February 2, 2000\n\nZlatko Tomčić February 2, 2000 - December 22, 2003\n\nVladimir Šeks December 22, 2003 - January 11, 2008\n\nLuka Bebić January 11, 2008 – Present\n\nList of Presidents (Speakers) of the Chamber of Counties of the Parliament\n\nJosip Manolić 1993 - 1994\n\nKatica Ivanišević 1994 - 2001\n\nElections for the Parliament\n\nLast election\n\nSummary of the 25 November 2007 Croatian Parliament (Hrvatski sabor) election results Parties and coalitions Votes % Seats % +/– Croatian Democratic Union (Hrvatska demokratska zajednica) 907,743 36.6 66 43.1 ±0 Social Democratic Party of Croatia (Socijaldemokratska partija Hrvatske) 775,690 31.2 56 36.6 +22 \"Green-Yellow Coalition\" (Zeleno-žuta koalicija) Croatian Peasant Party (Hrvatska seljačka stranka) 161,814 6.5 6 3.9 –4 Croatian Social Liberal Party (Hrvatska socijalno liberalna stranka) 2 1.3 ±0 Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar (Primorsko-goranski savez) 0 0.0 –1 Democratic Party of Zagorje (Zagorska demokratska stranka) 0 0.0 — Zagorje Party (Zagorska stranka) 0 0.0 — Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats (Hrvatska narodna stranka - Liberalni demokrati) 168,440 6.8 7 4.6 –4 Istrian Democratic Assembly (Istarski demokratski sabor/Dieta democratica Istriana) 38,267 1.5 3 2.0 –1 Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonija and Baranja (Hrvatski demokratski savez Slavonije i Baranje) 44,552 1.8 3 2.0 +3 Coalition Croatian Party of Pensioners (Hrvatska stranka umirovljenika) 101,091 4.1 1 0.7 –2 Democratic Party of Pensioners (Demokratska stranka umirovljenika) 0 0.0 — Croatian Party of Rights (Hrvatska stranka prava) 86,865 3.5 1 0.7 –7 Others 184,477 7.4 0 0.0 –7 Independent Democratic Serb Party (Samostalna demokratska srpska stranka) (national minority list) Enrolments and vote totals do not include voters for ethnic minority representatives. 3 2.0 ±0 Party of Democratic Action of Croatia (Stranka Demokratske Akcije Hrvatske) (national minority list) 1 0.7 ±0 Other national minority representatives 4 2.6 ±0 Total 2,483,452 100.0 153 100 — Sources: State Election Committee[5]\n\nMain article: Croatian parliamentary election, 2007\n\nPast elections\n\nCroatian parliamentary election, 1990\n\nCroatian parliamentary election, 1992\n\nCroatian parliamentary election, 1995\n\nCroatian parliamentary election, 2000\n\nCroatian parliamentary election, 2003\n\nList of assemblies\n\n1st assembly (1990–1992)\n\n2nd assembly (1992–1995)\n\n3rd assembly (1995–1999)\n\n4th assembly (2000–2003)\n\n5th assembly (2003–2007)\n\n6th assembly (2008–2011)\n\nSee also\n\nConstitution of Croatia\n\nPolitics of Croatia\n\nList of political parties in Croatia\n\nNotes\n\nThe Croatian Parliament"
