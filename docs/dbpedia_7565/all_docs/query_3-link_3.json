        "text": "a. Initiation of the procedure\n\nThe Croatian Parliament, exercising the rights and authorities established by the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and the Standing Orders of Parliament, enacts the Constitution, constitutional laws, codes, laws, the state budget, decisions, declarations, resolutions, charters, recommendations and conclusions, and issues authoritative interpretations of individual provisions of laws.\n\nThe law enactment procedure commences with the submission of a bill to the Speaker of Parliament. All Members of Parliament, political groups, parliamentary working bodies and the Government are entitled to sponsor bills, unless the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, the Standing Orders or the law stipulate that individual proposals may only be submitted by specific bodies or a specific number of Members of Parliament. The Speaker forwards the received bill to the chairpersons of all working bodies, to all MPs and to the Prime Minister when the Government is not the sponsor.\n\nThe Parliament may, by a special conclusion, determine that preliminary discussions be held in the working bodies on the reason for the enactment of a law and the basic issues to be regulated by such a law, based on a review of the status in the individual fields and arguments put forward on possible normative solutions, accompanied by relevant explanations. Preliminary discussions may also be conducted at the session of Parliament. After conducting preliminary discussions, all positions, opinions and proposals are submitted to the sponsor, who is obliged, when drafting the bill, to take them into consideration and in particular provide an explanation for rejecting specific positions, opinions and proposals.\n\nThe sponsor is obliged to inform the Speaker of Parliament about the person(s) who will provide notifications and explanations or necessary explications in relation to the submitted bill in parliamentary working bodies and in Parliament.\n\nThe sponsor may additionally submit the corresponding documentation to accompany the bill, particularly expert opinions, ratified international treaties, a report on consultations with the public and other acts used to explain the grounds for the bill.\n\nThe text of a bill contains solutions in the form of legal provisions. Individual solutions may be proposed alternatively, with the necessary explanation of each of the proposed alternatives. The explanations of bills shall contain the explanation of individual provisions contained in the bill.\n\nWhen a bill specifies that individual provisions thereof are to be applied retroactively, the sponsor is obliged to explain in particular the reasons justifying such provisions.\n\nb. Bill\n\nBills contain:\n\n- the constitutional grounds for the enactment of the law;\n\n- an assessment of the status and fundamental issues to be regulated by the law and the impact of the enacted law;\n\n- an assessment and sources of necessary funds to implement the law;\n\n- the text of the bill, with its interpretation and explanation;\n\n- the text of the provisions of the existing law.\n\nThe sponsor may additionally submit the corresponding documentation to accompany the bill, particularly expert opinions, ratified international treaties, a report on consultations with the public and other acts used to explain the grounds for the bill.\n\nIn the upper right-hand corner of the title page, bills bear the designation “P.Z. br ___” (abbreviations of the Croatian terms Prijedlog zakona – Bill, and broj – number) while legislation being aligned with the regulations of the European Union bear the designation “P.Z.E. br ___”. Each bill is given the next ordinal number at the end of the designation referred to in Article 177 paragraph 1 of the Standing Orders, and this designation must be cited in all other written materials (reports, opinions, amendments, final drafts, etc.) that pertain to a bill, until its enactment.\n\nc. Consideration of a bill in working bodies\n\nPrior to the debate on a bill at a session of Parliament, the chairperson of the competent working body and the Legislation Committee are obliged to place the bill on the agenda of the session of the working body and conduct a debate thereon. The working bodies adopt a position on all elements of the bill, while the Legislation Committee must particularly adopt a position on the constitutional grounds of the law.\n\nUpon considering a bill, the competent working body submits its report to the Parliament containing the opinions, positions, comments and proposals sponsored during its consideration.\n\nThe competent working body may consider the opinions, positions, comments and proposals submitted to it by other working bodies that considered the bill, and may request other working bodies to deliver such reports. In the report it submits to the Parliament, the competent working body shall additionally communicate its position on the opinions, positions, comments and proposals of other working bodies if they have been received prior to concluding the debate on the bill.\n\nThe Speaker of Parliament submits the reports received from the working bodies to the sponsor of the bill and Members of Parliament.\n\nUpon considering a bill, the working body designates a rapporteur who presents the opinions, positions and comments and explains the proposals of this body at the session of Parliament.\n\nd. First reading\n\nThe first reading is the first stage in the law making procedure which is conducted at the Parliament session and it includes:\n\n• an introductory presentation by the sponsor,\n\n• general debate on the bill,\n\n• debate on the details of the bill, including the debate on the wording of the bill,\n\n• debate on the positions of the working bodies which have considered the bill,\n\n• adoption of a conclusion on the need to pass the bill into law.\n\nIn addition to the introductory speech, the sponsor of the bill or the representatives designated by the sponsor are entitled to provide explanations, express opinions and adopt a position on the opinions, positions, comments and proposals made throughout the course of the debate in line with the provisions of the Standing Orders. A representative of the Government may request the floor during the course of the debate in Parliament even when the Government is not the sponsor of the bill. The sponsor of the bill may withdraw a bill until the conclusion of the debate.\n\nAt the session of Parliament, there is a general debate and a debate on details which, as a rule, are unified. A general debate on a bill is conducted in such a manner that Members of Parliament express their opinions on whether it is necessary to enact the law, on fundamental matters that are to be regulated by the law, on the constitutional authority that the proposed matter be regulated by law, and on the scope and manner of legally regulating such matters. A debate on details includes a discussion on the text of a bill and its individual provisions.\n\nIf Members of Parliament assess that the need to enact the law does not exist, the bill will be rejected by a conclusion that must be explained and submitted to the sponsor. The bill rejected at a session may not be placed on the agenda again before three months have passed after the date of its rejection by Parliament.\n\nUpon closing the debate by a conclusion to accept the bill, the Parliament submits its opinions, positions, comments and proposals to the sponsor for the purpose of drafting the final draft.\n\ne. Form of the final draft\n\nThe final draft is submitted in the form in which the law is to be enacted.\n\nThe explanation of the final draft encompasses the grounds for the enactment of the law, matters resolved thereby, explanations of the individual provisions, information on funds necessary to implement the law and methods to secure such funds and other circumstances pertinent to the matters to be regulated by the law.\n\nIn the explanation of the final draft, the sponsor is obliged to indicate the differences between the solutions being proposed and the solutions contained in the bill, the reasons why these differences emerged and the proposals, objections and opinions that were expressed regarding the bill and that were not accepted by the sponsor, with a statement of reasons why they were not accepted.\n\nApplication of the provisions of the Standing Orders\n\nWhen the final draft of a bill is being debated, the provisions on the debate at the second reading stage are applied accordingly to the provisions on the debate at the first reading stage.\n\nDuring the debate on the text of the final draft of a bill, the final draft is debated by sections or articles, as well as the tabled amendments. After the debate, decisions are adopted on the submitted amendments. The sponsor of the bill states whether he/she accepts or opposes each tabled amendment and only the sponsor of the amendment may respond to such a statement of the sponsor of the bill, in a speech that does not exceed two minutes. After conducting the debate and deciding on amendments, the debate is concluded and the enactment of the law is decided upon.\n\nf. Second reading\n\nThe second reading of a bill is the second stage in the procedure to enact a law that is conducted at sessions of Parliament and it includes:\n\n• an introductory presentation by the sponsor,\n\n• general debate on the bill,\n\n• debate on the text of the final draft of the bill\n\n• debate on the positions of the working bodies,\n\n• debate on tabled amendments,\n\n• deciding on amendments\n\n• enactment of the law.\n\nAfter the introductory presentation, the sponsor of the bill is entitled to request the floor throughout the course of the debate, provide explanations, express opinions and express positions on the tabled amendments as well as on the comments and proposals made throughout the course of the debate. A representative of the Government may also request the floor during the course of the debate even when the Government is not the sponsor of the bill.\n\nDuring the debate on the text of the final draft of a bill, the final draft is debated by sections and chapters, that is paragraphs and articles as well as the tabled amendments and after the debate, decisions are adopted on the submitted amendments. The sponsor of the bill states whether he/she accepts or opposes each tabled amendment while only the sponsor of the amendment may respond to such a statement. After conducting the debate and deciding on amendments, the debate is concluded and the enactment of the law is decided upon.\n\ng. Third reading\n\nThe third reading of a bill is a special stage in the procedure to enact a law conducted according to the decision of Parliament or at the request of the sponsor in cases where the text of the final draft is subject to a larger number of amendments or when the amendments are such that they significantly alter the content of the final draft.\n\nThe third reading is conducted under the conditions and according to the procedure stipulated in Standing Orders of Parliament for the second reading."
