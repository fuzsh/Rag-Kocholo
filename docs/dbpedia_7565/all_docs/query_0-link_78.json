It will focus on the election campaign, the legislative framework and its implementation, the media, the work of the election administration and relevant government bodies, and the complaints and appeals process. The ODIHR will not request short-term observers to monitor voting at the polling stations on election day.\n\nOn the day after the election, the Observation Mission will issue a statement of preliminary findings and conclusions. A comprehensive final report will be released approximately one month after the completion of the election process.\n\nThe OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission and the OSCE Mission to Croatia operate separately under their specific mandates."
