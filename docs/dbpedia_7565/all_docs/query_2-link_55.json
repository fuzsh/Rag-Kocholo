        "text": "The changes aim to give Croatian workers a salary bump, provide more fiscal independence to local governments, and contribute to economic growth. That is what Minister Primorac and the majority claim it will do. The opposition is skeptical, claiming the salary bump is negligible and the package cannot be described as a reform.\n\n\"These changes to tax parameters, rather than a tax reform, should be called the great leader comes baring gifts, which your evil mayors will take away,\" said Marijana Puljak, speaking on behalf of the club of deputies for the Centar and GLAS parties.\n\nThe government is scrapping the surtax that used to fund local governments. Under the new rules, local governments would be able to set their own local tax rates.\n\nSDP leader Peđa Grbin said the changes would result in a minimal increase to most salaries.\n\n\"This is politicking at its worst! We are changing nine laws to yield an average salary increase of 17 euros!” said Grbin.\n\nMost’s Nikola Grmoja was equally skeptical, saying that taxpayers are getting nothing from what is being touted a reform package.\n\n\"We are warning the people that your finance minister and prime minister are filling the state's coffers at the expense of taxpayers without giving them anything in return.\"\n\nFinance Minister Primorac said that this was the only way to try and increase the buying power of consumers in a high-inflation economy.\n\n\"Nobody's pleased that in an effort to increase the real buying power of consumers, we have to tamper with the earnings and contribution systems but that's the only way to do it. Why? Because we tried lowering the VAT on a number of goods but it did not result in lower prices,” said Primorac.\n\nBesides the tax package, one of the hot-button issues in the Sabor today was HEP, the national energy company and natural gas sales. HEP has been losing millions of euros due to a surplus of natural gas. The company purchased large quantities of natural gas from INA at a price set by the government back in the fall. Now, there is a surplus and gas is being sold at a mere fraction of the purchase price. HEP's management and the government are blaming each other, as the company's losses continue to mount.\n\n\"Were losing 100s of thousands of euros daily because the natural gas that had to be purchased at a price of 47 euros is being sold at certain times for as little as one cent! When I heard this, I was convinced this was a mistake because it sounded crazy, unbelievable,” said Grbin.\n\nGrmoja believes the PM is to blame because he appointed the head of HEP.\n\n\"The people involved in this are some of Andrej Plenković's closest colleagues - the head of the Zagreb branch of the HDZ Frane Barbarić, a man Plenković hand-picked to lead HEP. I see some media attacking Minister Filipović and he does hold some accountability because he is the minister but the main responsibility for this lies with Barbarić and the man who gave him this job,” said Grmoja.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister, Minister of Sea, Transport, and Infrastructure Oleg Butković defended the Government’s position, saying they would look into the matter thoroughly.\n\n\"We are going to examine everything: to whom the gas was sold and how. We will be adopting new regulations on Thursday and that issue will be addressed at Thursday's cabinet meeting. I can't say any more about the details of this matter because I don't have enough information,” Butković said."
