        "text": "UPDATED: 5.3.2024.\n\nCroatia is considered a unitary democratic parliamentary republic, and its branches of government include legislative, executive, and judicial bodies. The Constitution confirms people of Croatia have the power to elect their own representatives by direct election and the guaranteed right to local and regional self-government.\n\nCroatia adopted the new Constitution in 1990 and organized its first multi-party elections. While the 1990 constitution remains in force, it has been amended four times since its adoption – in 1997, 2000, 2001, and 2010.\n\nIn this article, we cover:\n\nExecutive branch\n\nJudicial branch\n\nLegislative branch\n\nPolitical parties\n\nThe facts are these…\n\nExecutive branch of the Republic of Croatia\n\nThe predsjednik države (President of the Republic) is the head of state and the commander-in-chief of the Oružane snage Republike Hrvatske (Croatian armed forces). The President is elected to serve a five-year term.\n\nAfter being elected, the president appoints the premijer (Prime Minister) with the consent of the parliament through a majority vote of all representatives or MPs and has some influence on foreign policy. The president also decides on diplomatic missions and consular offices abroad and appoints and recalls diplomatic representatives.\n\nCroatia’s primary executive power is headed by the Prime Minister, who has four deputy prime ministers and extra ministers who manage various departments, i.e., Croatian ministries such as defense, foreign and European affairs, justice, finance, agriculture, health, tourism, etc.\n\n[Read: All the Croatian government ministries and what they do]\n\nJudicial branch of the Republic of Croatia\n\nCroatia has a three-tiered, independent judicial system. The vrhovni sud (Supreme Court) is the highest court of appeal in Croatia, while općinski (municipal) and županijski (county) courts have general jurisdiction.\n\nSpecialized courts in Croatia include:\n\nCroatian Constitutional Court\n\nCommercial Court\n\nSuperior Commercial Court\n\nMisdemeanor Court\n\nSuperior Misdemeanor Court\n\nAdministrative court\n\nSuperior Administrative Court\n\nJudges are appointed by the National Judicial Council. Their term is permanent until seventy years of age.\n\n[Read: How the Croatian legislation system and courts work]\n\nLegislative branch of the Republic of Croatia\n\nThe Parliament of Croatia, called Sabor, is a unicameral legislative body. Sabor representatives are all elected by popular vote and serve four-year terms.\n\nThe number of parliament representatives ranges from 100 to 160 (currently 151), depending on the Zakon o izborima zastupnika u Hrvatski sabor (law on the election of members of the Croatian parliament), which is available here. Up to three members are chosen to represent Croatians living abroad and eight members represent ethnic and national minorities.\n\nThe basic units of regional self-government are the counties. A county is called županija in Croatian. The present administrative-territorial division of the country was introduced in 1997 when the 1992 division was changed. Smaller administrative-territorial units within counties are cities/towns in urban areas and municipalities in other areas.\n\n[Read: How laws are made in Croatia]\n\nPolitical parties in Croatia\n\nCroatia has a multi-party system, which means no one party has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must collaborate to form coalition governments. Between January 1990, when political parties were legalized in Croatia, and February 2024, 402 political parties were registered, out of which 156 are active today.\n\nSome of the most important political parties with elected representation at the national level include:\n\nCroatian Democratic Union (HDZ)\n\nSocial Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP)\n\nBridge of Independent Lists (Most)\n\nCroatian People’s Party-Liberal Democrats (HNS)\n\nCroatian Peasant Party (HSS)\n\nMožemo!\n\n[Read: Croatia’s Largest Political Parties]\n\nView our other Croatian legislation posts\n\nCroatia’s Largest Political Parties\n\nCroatian government ministries and what they do\n\nDomestic abuse in Croatia\n\nDrug laws and usage in Croatia\n\nGun and weapon laws in Croatia\n\nHow laws are made in Croatia\n\nHow the Croatian legislation system and courts work\n\nHow to vote in Croatia\n\nMandatory vaccinations required by law\n\nSources:\n\nZakon o izborima zastupnika u Hrvatski sabor\n\nZakon o lokalnim izborima\n\nRegistar političkih stranaka\n\nHrvatski sabor"
