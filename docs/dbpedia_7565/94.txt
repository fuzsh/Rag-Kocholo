The Parliament of Croatia (Croatian: Hrvatski sabor) is the unicameral legislature of Croatia. Under the terms of the Croatian Constitution, the Sabor[1] represents the people and is vested with the legislative power.

The Sabor is composed of between 100 and 160 members, elected on the basis of direct universal and equal suffrage by secret ballot, for a term of 4 years. Members' mandate can be extended only during a war. Seats are allocated according to the Croatian Parliament electoral districts - most representatives come from the Croatian mainland counties, but there are also some minority and diaspora seats. Currently the number of members is 153. 140 of them are from the counties, 8 from the minorities and 5 from abroad. The Sabor is presided by a President (sometimes referred to as Speaker or Chairman), who is assisted by at least one deputy president (usually four or five).

Historical background

The Croat nobles agreed to form two Croatian states after settling in the Illyrian territory in the 7th century AD, after the great migration of the Slavs. Their meeting and agreement over the issues important for the people is considered the foundation of Croatian parliament.

Croatian counts and dukes later established a country and elected a king among themselves in the 9th and 10th century, but the legend says that they always made decisions as a group.

After Croatia decided to elect Hungarian king as King of Croatia in 1102, these nobles formed a real parliament and their decisions had significant influence in the state politics. In fact, when the Kingdom of Hungary and Kingdom of Croatia lost its leader after the Battle of Mohács in 1526 when the king Louis II of Hungary died, the Croats gathered at Parliament on Cetin and chose Austrian archduke Ferdinand I. Habsburg for King of Croatia.

In 1712, the Croatian Parliament decided on the so-called Pragmatic Sanction, thus taking the side of Maria Theresa, supporting her to become queen of Hungary.

In the light of the Revolutions of 1848, Sabor decided to renew some of the country autonomy by exerting its power to all of the old Croatian regions and having the same ban govern them. In 1868 they negotiated a bargain with the Hungarians that regulated the ties between the countries in the new environment of Austria-Hungary.

In 1918 the Parliament decided to split off Croatia from Hungary, and join the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. However, the country's entry to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes that ensued was never ratified by Sabor, which was decommissioned.

In 1942, an unelected Croatian State Parliament was held in the Independent State of Croatia, a puppet state of Nazi Germany. It met for the first time on February 23, 1942 and was formally dissolved on December 28, 1942. Its president was Marko Dosen. The post-World War II parliament developed from the council of anti-fascists (ZAVNOH) formed in 1943. It functioned as the Parliament of the Socialist Republic of Croatia (as a part of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), until 1990 when Croatia regained full independence.

Bicameral system 1990-2001

Under the original terms of the 1990 Constitution, the Croatian Parliament was bicameral, comprising the directly elected Zastupnički Dom (Chamber of Deputies) and the Županijski Dom (Chamber of the Counties).[3] Such a chamber - which held a suspending veto power over legislation - was composed of 3 members for each of the 21 districts of the Country, regardless of their population. In addition, it included five members appointed by the President of the Republic and the former Heads of State themselves (similar to the Italian Senate). The Chamber of the Counties was abolished in 2001 with a formal constitutional amendment[4] and the Chamber of Deputies is now known simply as the Sabor.
