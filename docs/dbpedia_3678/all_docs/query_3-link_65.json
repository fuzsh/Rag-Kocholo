        "text": "Shelley Duvall's career is symptomatic of a pre-#MeToo era in cinema. Shelley Duvall, an unforgettable actress, known for her roles in Three Women by Robert Altman, Annie Hall by Woody Allen, and The Shining by Stanley Kubrick, in which she played the tormented wife of Jack Nicholson, has passed away at the age of 75. “My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she’s free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley,” said American director and screenwriter Dan Gilroy, her partner, in a statement published by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nToday, in light of this sad news, Vogue is looking back at Shelley Duvall's career, in tribute to the talented actress whose career was marred by an unjust patriarchal system towards women.\n\nShelley Duvall, radiant actress\n\nIn the 1970s, Shelley Duvall's career was one of the most closely followed in the film industry. Almost as daring as she was radiant, she captured the attention of filmmaker Robert Altman, who cast her as Millie in the film Three Women (1977). They actually met even earlier, however. In 1969, at a party held for her then-fiancé, artist Bernard Sampson, she landed her first role in the film Brewster McCloud. She was barely 20 years old, yet already harbored a certain talent despite her youthful awkwardness. Initially hesitant about pursuing acting, Duvall eventually accepted. However, it was another collaboration with Altman, specifically the brilliant Three Women, that cemented her status as an actress. For this role, she acted in a semi-improvised tragicomedy as a health spa worker for the elderly in the California desert, who invites a colleague (played by Sissy Spacek) to share her apartment, leading to a blurring of identities. Her performance elicited both laughter and tears, earning Duvall the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n1980 marked the seventh and final collaboration between Shelley Duvall and Robert Altman with Popeye, a musical comedy starring Robin Williams in his debut role. The strange, madcap film creation, saw the actress shine through her portrayal of Olive Oyl. Around the same time, she appeared in Woody Allen's romantic comedy Annie Hall. Much of her performance was cut out of the film, but it left a lasting impression on viewers: as Pam, a journalist for Rolling Stone, she delivered sharp and witty lines with finesse.\n\nA film career cut short\n\nLet us cast our minds back to 1978, in North London. The Shining, a monumental film, is in the midst of production. Stanley Kubrick is at the helm, putting his leading lady Shelley Duvall through hell. It was only 30 years later that the actress revealed the traumatism she suffered caused by Kubrick's treatment of her, in order to obtain the performance he was looking for. For example, there were around 127 takes of the scene where Wendy (the character played by Duvall) threatens her husband with a baseball bat. Kubrick had her “crying 12 hours a day for weeks on end,” she said in a 1981 interview with People magazine. “I will never give that much again. If you want to get into pain and call it art, go ahead, but not with me.”\n\nWhile Shelley Duvall's film career continued in the 1980s, with movies such as Tim Burton's short film Frankenweenie (1984), or Terry Gilliam's black comedy Time Bandits, (1981), the actress's big-screen appearances became increasingly rare as the years went by. At the same time, she recorded Sweet Dreams, a children's music album, and a year later, her project was transformed into a 26-episode series that she produced herself. In 2022, after an absence of two decades, she returned to the silver screen with Scott Goldberg's confidential horror film The Forest Hills."
