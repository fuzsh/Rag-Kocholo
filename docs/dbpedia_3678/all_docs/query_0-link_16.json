        "text": "Kim Kardashian is rocking a look very different from her usual, and fans seem to be a bit thrown off by the switch-up.\n\nIn one of her latest stripped-down set of photos, shared on Sunday, June 23, the reality TV star wore her ice blonde-colored hair in what looked to be a woven braided style, as she crouched down to the ground for the set of images.\n\nWith the hairstyle, which was likely done on a wig unit, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum sported a flesh toned ensemble comprised of a sheer tank top, leggings, and matching heeled booties‚Äîa style similar to what she frequented while married to ex-husband Kanye West, which is now a fashion theme often seen on the rapper's current wife Bianca Censori.\n\nThe caption-less upload left fans a bit confused, as they wondered what exact vibe she was aiming for with the uncharacteristic choice.\n\n\"What in the constitution is going on here?\" one asked, while another joked, \"she getting ready to write the declaration of independence.\"\n\n\"Founding fathers type wig,\" a third dubbed the hairpiece, as a fourth likened the look to that of a former president: \"Ok george Washington üíÖüèº.\"\n\n\"Soo she‚Äôs taken up basket weaving,\" someone else wrote, and an additional commenter bluntly inquired, \"Kimberly what is this ?\"\n\nMeanwhile, others seemed to appreciate the hairstyle, with one fan adding, \"Y‚Äôall just don‚Äôt get it but I do üòç,\" and another chiming in insisting it's \"iconic.\"\n\nAs of late, the SKIMS owner has seemingly been taking a different route regarding her Instagram content, displaying pictures of a more simplified version of herself with less heavy makeup and editing."
