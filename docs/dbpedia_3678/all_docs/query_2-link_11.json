        "text": "About\n\nAcclaimed New Hollywood filmmaker Robert Altman’s Icarian satire follows the titular Brewster McCloud (Bud Cort), an owlish recluse determined to construct a set of prosthetic wings that will enable him to fly. Under the auspices of his charming yet inscrutable fairy godmother Louise (Sally Kellerman), and in spite of myriad would-be sensual distractions, Brewster’s aerial ambitions quickly turn to ruthlessness, and capture the attentions of hot-shot big-city detective, Frank Shaft (Michael Murphy).\n\nWith sharp dialogue, superb choreography, and Altman’s unmistakeable flare for composition and arrangement, Brewster McCloud is a sprawling tableau of avian-themed absurdism and social satire that takes aim at race, class, authority, and academia in America. Brought to life by captivating performances from its ensemble cast – including a young Shelley Duvall in her debut film performance – Robert Altman further refined his unique directorial vision in this distinctive black comedy.\n\nBrewster McCloud will screen from Robert Altman’s personal print of the film, held by the UCLA Film & TV Archive, Los Angeles."
