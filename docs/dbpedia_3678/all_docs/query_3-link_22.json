        "text": "IT is 4:30 on a Friday afternoon in late December, and the Canadian darkness has fallen like a stone. Water pours down Robert Altman's Mephistophelean beard, and an incongruously thin string of love beads circles his massive neck. At 2 A.M. the preceding night he lurched to bed, a last glass of Scotch in one hand, a last joint of marijuana in the other. But the indulgences of the night have no claim over the day. He was the first man on the set in the winter darkness of 7 A.M. He will be the last man to leave in the slippery frozen twilight.\n\nStanding In the rain with his 205 pounds zipped into a hooded, red nylon jumpsuit and the west coast of North America lying beyond his left shoulder, movie director Robert Altman looks a bit like a giant hawk, bit more like Santa Claus, even more like Alan Hale as Little John to Errol Flynn's Robin Hood. But the over‐all impression is of a cheerful Old Nick. Only tail and pitchfork are missing.\n\nAltman drinks ‘hot buttered rum from a silver flask. He has had no breakfast, no lunch, but “the biggest problem in shooting a movie is time to go to the bathroom.” In the few hours of daylight, he has completed 34 camera setups. He is pleased with himself, and he does not try to hide it. Later tonight, swacked on Scotch, grass, red and white wine, he will announce, “I was so good today was fabulous. I embarrassed myself.”\n\nAt 46, Robert Altman is Hollywood's newest 26‐year‐old genius. The extra 20 years are simply the time he had to spend, chained and toothless, in the anterooms of power —waiting for Hollywood to catch up with him.\n\nWhile he was waiting, he made million dollars as a television director and spent two million; fathered four children on three wives; gave up the last remnants of Catholicism for hedonism, and occasionally lost $2,000 in a single night in Las Vegas without losing half an hour's sleep over the money.\n\nEighteen months ago Hollywood caught up—with a vengeance. Robert Altman had waited 20 years for the historical accident of having 14 more acceptable directors turn down “M∗A∗S∗H.” For “M∗A∗S∗H” Altman won an Academy Award nomination. The film was chosen as best film of the Cannes Film Festival and also selected best film of 1970 by the National Society of Film Critics.\n\nLATER on this Friday in late December, Altman sits on the floor of his rented house in Vancouver, B. C. —a glass of red wine in one hand, joint in the other—casually seducing men and women alike with the intensity of his interest. There are a dozen people in the room, almost all old friends, veterans of half a dozen Hollywood wars, now in Canada with him to work on his new film, “McCabe & Mrs. Miller.”\n\nRound and round the circle goes the joint, sealing some mystical bargain. (“All of it is a love affair,” says the screenwriter of “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” Brian McKay. “Everyone on a Bob Altman movie is there because Bob needs them to make that film. If he doesn't need you anymore, good‐by. So wrapping your whole life in Bob Altman as some people do is dangerous. When he turns off the charisma, it hurts.”) Altman will not let his 16‐year‐old son smoke marijuana. “He's too young. I do what I do. I get up in the morning and go to work. If he gets stoned in the evening, he's not committed to anything the next day.”\n\nBy the time Altman lurches to his feet to take the circle out to dinner, he has consumed enough Scotch, wine and grass to put an army to sleep, but he shows no sign of wear. His energy level and his stamina are so high that he cannot easily blow out the light. (He does, however, have one other way of relaxing. He will sometimes take to his bed for weekend, switching from television station to television station with his remote control in search of a roller derby. When he finds one, he will lie, half‐hypnotized, for hours, watching the skaters go round and round.)\n\nHalfway through dinner, he rests his elbows on the table, his eyes closing, his head swaying. He is suddenly hostile. “I've found myself performing for you 16 times today,” he tells a reporter—infuriated at even unintentional deceit in himself. He charges forward verbally—challenging, taunting—yet neither his crude language nor his massive self‐confidence can mask or take away his considerable charm. More and more uncomfortable, his wife begs him to stop. He shrugs her off. Eventually she moves out of earshot to the other end of the long table.\n\nThe bill for dinner is $153.25. Alt man pays it with an American Express card. He holds the plastic rectangle triumphantly. The card arrived that morning, proof that he is no longer a bad credit risk. He had been applying for It for six years.\n\nAltman insists on driving home. Each member of the party ‘remonstrates, protests, begs, but he is too powerful to be stopped. Eventually they give in. He makes the wrong turn and there is a silent‐movie chase around the restaurant.\n\nBack at his house, Altman is handed a Scotch and soda as a matter of routine. Nobody tries to handle him. Nobody tells him he has had enough. After an hour of sipping Scotch and wine, he is completely recovered, in better condition than the others—most of whom have had far less to drink.\n\nHe is still on his feet when the house empties at 2 A.M.\n\nALTMAN'S staying power through the long Canadian nights is one thing. His staying power as a director is another. It is too early to make any sound appraisal of the range of Robert Altman's talent. Says director Blake Edwards, who has been there and back again, “It used to be that there were 10 directors you were sure of. Now a guy has one great success and three failures and you look back and say, ‘What did I ever see in him?’”\n\nAs a result of “M∗A∗S∗H,” Hollywood — which rarely looks beyond immediate grosses—has chosen Robert Altman as its current hot director. In Matteo's Restaurant, the silken executives paw at his turtleneck sweater. At 20th Century‐Fox, frightened men carry the grosses of “M∗A∗S∗H” on the backs of torn envelopes. Four years ago the Mirisch company wouldn't allow him to direct a $5,000,000 picture. After “M∗A∗S∗H,” they called and begged him to direct the film.\n\nOffered the moon, Altman takes very small bites. “You can steal money in TV and movies. I could make $150,000 a year for the next two or three years ‘without doing thing. By making deals that never go through, by accepting money to develop projects that are never finished.” He thinks that he has been “really lucky with the long gestation period—with failure. If I had had a hit, a imajor success, 15 years ago or even five years ago, it would have destroyed me.” From years of ,gambling he has learned that “it takes only one minute to become totally irrational, ‘to think that it's you who have done something, not the dice.”\n\nHe hopes that he can remain moderately stable. It helps to have had “little minor successes. successes can look back on and see they're nothing. You get caught up to the point you deceive yourself. You can't avoid the traps. There's too much money, too much adulation, too many people saying you're marvelous. You have to believe it.”\n\nHe admires Ingmar Bergman “who has avoided the traps by totally isolating himself.” For Altman, who surrounds himself with people from the moment he gets up until the moment he is poured into bed, Bergman's way is admirable but impossible. Altman's own way of “avoiding the traps” is “to start out with material I think I can't handle. It keeps you honest. But that way, each thing you do eliminates that thing. Perhaps eventually you run out of things you can try.”\n\n“M∗A∗S∗H” was Altman's second film, (If one doesn't count “Countdown,” a melodrama he was booted off in 1966 and two very early nonHollywood films.) His first major film, “That Cold Day in the Park,” was a critical and financial disaster. His third film, “Brewster McCloud,” has shown up on half a dozen Best Films of 1970 lists, including those of Judith Grist and Andrew Sarris. It has also been dismissed by Pauline Kael (“no driving im pulse and no internal consistency”) and by Stanley Kauffmann. The movie is a fairy tale for adults, a myth about bird droppings and whether man really wants to fly or only wants the freedom that he thinks birds have. People who like the film like it very much. The rest detest it.\n\nAltman, who has never gotten a!ong well with bosses, started fighting with MGM after the first previeW of “Brewster McCloud.” “The preview cards were better than ‘M*A*S*IT but afterward the hotel room was like a wake, because nobody had come out of the film laughing. If anybody came out of ‘Brewster McCloud’ laughing, we didn't make the film we thought we were going to make.”\n\nThe studio, eager to get rid of a peculiar film, dumped it with little preparation into vast, drafty theaters across the country. (“I wouldn't make a film at MGM today if they gave me 100 per cent financing and 100 per cent of the profits” is Altman's most printable comment.)\n\nSince it cost only $1,500,000, “Brewster McCloud” will end up making a little money. Altman's newest film, “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” may have equal difficulty turning profit. Although it is, in one way, considerably more traditional, it is, in another, considerably more peculiar. And it cost slightly over $3,000,000. Warren Beatty is John McCabe. His real‐life paramour, Julie Christie, is Mrs. Miller. “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” is Western in much the same strange way that “M∗A∗S∗H” was a war film. It takes place in the northwestern United States in 1902, and it tells the story of “a fool, a poseur, a hero with a hole and it's that hole that makes him a hero.”\n\nTHE peculiarities of “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” begin with the look of the film. Of the many attempts by directors to use color to comment on the picture they are making (Antonioni's “Red Desert,” George Roy Hill's “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” John Huston's “Moulin Rouge”), “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” is closest—both technically and emotionally—to Huston's grim use of color in “Moby Dick.” The faded quality of the color is Altman's deliberate attempt—by methods known as flashing and fogging—to create the archaic feel of an old photograph left for too many years in somebody's attic album.\n\nExcept for the snow sequence at the end of the film where he wanted to increase the reality of “the moment of truth” with as harsh a blackand‐white effect as possible, Altman used fog filters throughout the picture. Then, before the negative was developed, the film was put on a printer and re‐exposed to light. According to Altman, “adding more yellow than normal not only threw the print “toward yellow but made the look of the film more extreme. Adding more blue did the same thing.” Altman's intention was “to complement the period, the set, and the look of the people, to make the audience see the film as more real.” To him the blue and yellow suggested the faded printed material of the period —, old magazines and bottle labels, aging and yellowed newspapers.\n\nAltman's desire to achieve reality has led him less to technical innovations than to the rejection of technical devices considered standard by other directors. Instead of ordinary, clear sound, he uses overlapping sound — characters’ voices, even scenes, blend into and interrupt each other. “That's to give the audience the sense of the dialogue, the emotional feeing, rather than the literal word. That's the way sound is in real life.”\n\nOn all his films he has used two cameras simultaneously and a zoom lens “to keep the actors honest, so that an actor cannot feel, ‘I don't have to give very much in this scene because the camera is on my back.’ They never know.”\n\nHe built a real town for “MECabe & Mrs. Miller” without making any effort to leave room for his cameras; instead of trained animals, he used strays that wandered onto the Canadian set. “In a sense, we created problems for ourselves,” he admits, “but a real town is not carefully constructed for cameras. And real animals don't always behave the way you want them to. We gained the advantage of environment—hopefully for the audience, definitely for ourselves.”\n\nMAKING his films “more real” is close to the core of Altman's work as a director. He wants to catch the accidents of life and fling them on the screen hard enough to knock the breath out of the audience. He wants to weigh the screen down with vulrarity, pleasure, pain, ugliness and unexpected beauty. He wants, magically, to change two dimensions into three.\n\nAltman is, of course, doomed to fai ure—which he admits in his rare morose moments: “Nobody has ever made a good movie. Some day someone will make half a good one.” To Altman, a “good movie” is “taking the narrative out, taking the story out of it. The audience will sit and see the film and understand the movie's intention without being able to articulate it.”\n\nFor his next film, “Images,” a modern Gothic horror story he wrote in one long, tormented weekend several years ago, Altman is already “trying in my head to take all the words out that make sense and to replace them with words that don't.”\n\nIn “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” the words that are there make sense, but in his attempt “to keep from being obvious, to keep the audience from seeing the devices,” Altman has clipped several great chunks of plot out of the film. His concern for emotional rather than literal accuracy has left a number of puzzling and undefined characters to wander—mostly in long shot—in and out of the background.\n\nAltman admits that this “will confuse the literalminded,” but he hopes that “the rest of the audience will sit back and accept the film rather than anticipate it, will simply let the film wash over them. In most films so much specific information is provided that the audience is allowed to be totally uninvolved. I try to make an audience do as much work as they would do reading a novel.”\n\nThe result of this approach, with “M∗A∗S∗H,” was that large numbers of people read Altman's antiwar film as a pro‐war statement. He can only assume that “they are people who need to see children burning to think something is antiwar.” He dismisses them as “people who want a political statement rather than an artistic one.”\n\nALTMAN does not like his films to make any verbal statements. He is interested in the look and feel of a film rather than in words and plot. He speaki often of himself as “an artist painting a picture.” And adds, “It's not words we're dealing with in the films I make, not clever dialogue. I'm not interested in doing ‘A Man for All Seasons’ or ‘A Lion in Winter.’ ”\n\nAs a result, most of the writers of Altman's films have ended up as his more‐or‐lessbitter enemies. By the time one of his films is finished there is nothing left of the original script except a couple of soup bones of plot and a few expletives. “Bob,” says Brian McKay, “considers a script simply as an instrument, as the tool you sell the studio.”\n\nAccording to Bill Cannon, author of the original screenplay of “Brewster McCloud,” Altman “claimed I should take my name off the screen since, in fact, he, himself, had written most of the film.”\n\nAltman cheerfully admits that Ring Lardner Jr., who won an Academy Award for his script of “M∗A∗S∗H,” “hated me. Lardner kept saying things like, ‘That isn't a true Maine accent. You're being false.’ Bull—. If I have an actor uncomfortable in a Maine accent, I let him use an accent he's comfortable in. I'm interested in the behavior pattern of the characters, not in what ‘they say. In my films the actors can be creative. I don't think one person can write dialogue for 15 people. When I read Ring Lardner's script of ‘M∗A∗S∗H,’ I was thrilled with the idea of doing it. Yet if I had done his script the picture would have been disaster.”\n\nLardner is publicly quite circumspect in his opinion of Altman. (His private opinions are considerably more vitriolic.) “Mr. Altman does not treat a script very carefully. He contributed a great deal to ‘M∗A∗S∗H’ and not all of his contributions were good. He tried to do too much adlibbing.” Still, Lardner insists that “each scene came out on the screen more or less as it was intended by me on paper.” Altman disagrees. “My main contribution to ‘M∗A∗S∗H1 was the basic concept, the philosophy, the style, the casting, and then making all those things work. Plus all the jokes, of course.”\n\nBrian McKay, who has worked with Altman more frequently than any other writer, says, “If you want me to get in line with the rest of the angry writers, 1 will, but it's more complicated than that. I think what Bob really wants is the European credit: ‘A Film by Robert Altman.’ And, often, he deserves it.”\n\nSeven years ago Altman told McKay, “Remember this. I take all the credit and most of the money when you work with me.” Through several television series, “Brewster McCloud,” “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” and a number of never‐made films, McKay remembered. “Now I don't think I'll ever work with Bob again,” McKay says, but he looks back on the association with affection. “I can't think of one person who was hurt from his association with Bob Altman—except emotionally.”\n\nALTMAN considers both “M∗A∗S∗H” and “Brewster McCloud” “almost exclusively me—my films.” For “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” he is willing to share the credit—not with his writer but with his set designer, Leon Ericksen, and his star, Warren Beatty.\n\nFor “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” Altman and Ericksen. built the town of Presbyterian Church on a mountaintop in West Vancouver. The town cost $200,000. Everything in it was real. The town—all raw wood, foot‐deep mud and piles of manure that steamed in the freezing winter air — was created by carpenters who lived in the cabins they were building and got drunk at night on whisky from the still they had also built.\n\nLife frozen upon a screen loses its spontaneity. The choices have been made forever. Altman tries harder than most directors to imply what lies below the two‐dimensional surface of the screen. He stuffs his films with things that audiences cannot see yet of which he insists they are somehow aware. To pay for a quick call at Presbyterian Church's whorehouse, the actors held real money in hands that were never seen by the camera. “If someone's playing a scene and they look down and they've got some crappy paper in their hand, they just don't play the scene as well,” says Altman. “I want to be able to go onto a set and open a drawer and find things in there although that drawer will never be opened in a scene. But it adds validity because the actor knows the things are there\n\nHE organic relationship between Altman, his script, his actors, his sets and the final film can best be seen in the town of Presbyterian Church. He built the town because his film was partly about a community in the process of being built and changed. Presbyterian Church was constructed, building by building, as each new character entered “McCabe & Mrs. Miller.” By late last December, the town had reached its peak development—cabins, a sawmill, a whorehouse, a bathhouse, two saloons and a barbershop.\n\n“The town's been ruined,” said Rene Auberjonois the birdlike bird lecturer in “Brewster McCloud,” the Irish saloonkeeper in “McCabe & Mrs. Miller”), who came to Vancouver two weeks before the film started last October. “Only the guys building the town were living there. I felt like an outsider. It was their town. Then the actors started arriving, and we made lit our town. We picked out houses to live in, and we had square dances at night in my saloon.”\n\n“The town grew as the script grew,” says designer Ericksen. “Lots of things in the town changed because of the script; lots of things in the script changed because of the way the town was built. Everything happened organically.” “The film even changed because of the animals,” says Altman's secretary, Anne Sidaris. “It changed because kittens were horn in Presbyterian Church, dogs elected to live there, chickens hatched baby chicks.” (To give some idea of the symbiotic relationship between the animals and the crew, less than a dozen of the chickens were left when the film was finished. It is assumed that the others were killed and eaten.)\n\nTHROUGHOUT the picture, it was rare for Altman to know on one morning exactly what he was going to he filming the next morning. Often, the next morning's scene had not yet been written. Late on a winter Thursday afternoon, Altman sloshed through the rain looking for a place to hold a funeral where the camera could see the church but not the housing development on the hillside across from Presbyterian Church. An offhand suggestion by his secretary of “Asleep in Jesus” as the epitaph for the dead man's gravestone led to a frantic search through old hymnhooks and, in Friday morning's cold mist, to a painfully affecting scene. The music was played on a fiddle by one of the actors. Altman had only given the lyrics to those townspeople—primarily the whores—who could he expected to know the hymn. The other actors shuffled their feet uneasily or tried to come in late on the unfamiliar words. It worked. And none of it had existed—even in Altman's head — 24 hours earlier.\n\nLater, referring to the funeral, Altman mused: “Had it been raining today, everything we did would have been different. I'm going to get accolades for ‘McCabe & Mrs. Miller,’ and all it amounts to is being open to the possibilities—using what. we have.”\n\nIt is almost impossible to exaggerate the organic quality of an Altman film. Yet that quality does not result simply because one day there is rain instead of expected snow and a consequent change in the whole fabric of the film. It is agonizing for Altman to start a film. “You have to box him into a corner,” says his assistant director, Tommy Thompson. “He knows that starting means two months of working seven days a week 24 hours a day.” Once the film has begun, Altman moves eautiously, tentatively, finding out who the people are, assessing their relationships. “You can,” says Rene Auberjonois, “almost see him get sense of purpose.”\n\nThere is nothing intellectual about this groping. It is done by hunch, instinct, intuition. Altman speaks of allowing some internal computer to take over, unrestricted by his brain. “I think you have to he careful in your old age,” he says. “I think you mess up your computer, you get it so filled with cards. That's what makes you die.”\n\nONCE the tone of his film is set to his satisfaction—which takes anywhere from three days to two weeks—he relaxes, open, within very broad limits, to whatever accidents of weather or actors’ improvisations fate has chosen to bring him. (With “M∗∗S∗H,” he ended up shooting the rehearsals because there was so much interplay between Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould. With “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” he has discovered that “Warren Beatty,. unlike most actors, gets better and better with each take, and he can't do it through rehearsals.” Altman adapted himself to Beatty, shooting eight or nine takes of each of Beatty's scenes, despite what he calls his own “notorious past history of Printing first takes.”)\n\nBefore a birthday party was filmed in the whorehouse in “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” the actresses playing the whores asked Altman if they could limit the guests to the actors they particularly liked. His first impulse was to refuse. A moment later, he reconsidered and told them to make out their guest list.\n\nAfter six hours of shooting, neither Altman nor his actors displayed any signs of ill temper. Occasionally, Altman crooned, “Easy now, easy, settle down,” as though he were calming nervous horses. In a heavy, black pullover and with his gray and black curly hair almost indistinguishable from his grayand‐black Russian wool hat, Altman looked like. some bulky animal with a bald spot the size of a demitasse saucer in the center of its head.\n\nAt the suggestion of Julie Christie (“This is a festive occasion”), the east had been drinking vodka instead of water since the first rehearsal. But it was not the vodka that freed them to improvise a cake‐eating scene so wild and uninhibited that even Altman was doubled over with lau??hter. They had been given the freedom to—encouraged to—improvise by Altman.\n\nA glob of cake fell on the hare breast of one of the actresses, and the others instinctively teased a shy, young actor with, “Lick it off, Jeremy, tick It off.” Jeremy blinked, hesitated, was pushed forward. The young actors and actresses were, it was obvious, reacting to each other as people who had lived together for two months, not as actors in a formal scene. Even after Altman shouted, “Cut,” they continued to squash cake in eyebrows, nostrils, ears.\n\nIn the final print of “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” there is almost no trace of the wild finale to the birthday party. “It didn't seem necessary,” Altman says simply. Yet he feels that the hours of shooting were in no sense a loss. “It brought the characters to a different relationship with each other. Without it, Rene Auberjonois wouldn't have ended up in the kitchen with that whore on his lap.”\n\nIf Altman has any theory that can be phrased in a sentence, it is that “moviemaking is a collaborative art.” Leon Ericksen says of Altman: “He can be satanic or angelic but he will always let you do anything you are willing to do. Being with Robert Altman is an awfully good place for any creative person to be.”\n\nTHE corollary is that being with Robert Altman can be unpleasant for less creative people. His intense anger at movie guilds and unions stems from their lack of participation in the collaboration. “The union art directors don't realize their job is to help make a picture, not to dress a set. The union sound men don't realize their job is to help make a picture, not to produce perfect sound. The unions are all the same. They degrade the people in them.”\n\nEricksen, whom Donald Sutherland calls a genius, cannot get into an American union unless he serves eight years of apprenticeship as a draftsman. When Erickson says tentatively, “We'll probably have to call the union to Move that set,” Altman answers. “Bull— You move it yourself. We'll handle it with the union. We'll pay fines or something, but don't want a bunch of guys trying to take it down who didn't see how it went up.'’\n\nFor Altman, the chief participants in the collaboration are his actors. He is proud that “I don't move my actors around. I allow them the artistic freedom to assist me.”\n\nMost of his actors reciprocate with adoration. Mike Murphy, who has been in all of Altman's Hollywood films and half a dozen of his television shows as well, says of Altman, “Most other director.; treat you like a child. Bob spoils you. He never lets you down.” As the hot‐shot San Francisco detective, Murphy Starred in “Brewster McCloud.” In “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” be was offered one week's work, He never considered refusing Altman's offer.\n\nEven Julie Christie was exhilarated by her work with Altman, although, at the beginning, she found it “most unnerving to work with a democratic director. Directors are little kings. Bob's a very kind man, and his kindness makes you comfy. He has a hedonistic streak which again is very different from most directors, who get so anguished by things. Bob wants to enjoy himself. He surrounds himself with people who won't spoil the experience as an enjoyable one.”\n\nTHERE are actors who have reservations. “I got a telephone call tram an old enemy last night,” Altman chortles. The call was from Elliott Gould, who, according to Altman, “had just seen Brewster McCloud’ and who hated to call but hated more not to call.” He has also applied the word “enemy” to Donald Sutherland. Yet Sutherland insists that he respects Altman completely. Sutherland's subtle reservations about Altman as a director concern the communication between the two. “Bob knows things totally rather than specifi?? ‘M∗A∗S∗H’ was all in Robert Altman's head and I knew I'd never know what was in his head. He requires an actor to have absolute confidence in him and to give oneself over to him totally. I cannot totally give myself to anyone.”\n\nWarren Beatty also has reservations. Swigging Vichy water from a quart bottle, the picture half‐finished, the constant rain beating against the walls of his trailer, Beatty says fastidiously that “my own particular taste is to know where I am from the beginning.” Beatty found it hard to work without the comfort of a finished script. Altman found it hard to work with “Warren's concern, his nit‐picking, with the way he pushed me and bugged me.” But Altman didn't try to make Beatty stop. “He drove me nuts, but he did it for the picture. His bugging kept me honest.” Weekend after weekend, Beatty helped Altman rewrite the script, and now, the film finished and about to open in New York, Altman is willing to share the credit with his star. “Warren was involved in the picture.”\n\nNOTHING in Altman's background could have been expected to lead him to his own mountaintop in Canada in the winter of 1970.\n\nHe was born in Kansas City Feb. 20, 1925. His mother's ancestors had sailed on the Mayflower. His father was one of the top life‐insurance salesmen in the world—and one of the worst gamblers. “I learned a lot a lout losing from him: That losing is an identity; that you can be a good loser and a bad winner; that none of it—gambling, money, winning or losing—has any real value; that the value you thought came with winning $10,000 isn't there; that it's simply a way of killing time, like crossword puzzles.”\n\nHe was raised by Jesuits, but he wriggled out of his Catholicism the day he joined the Army at the age of 18. At 19, he was a pilot with his own bomber crew. He flew 46 missions over Borneo and the Dutch East Indies, and it never occurred to him that he was killing people, “although I don't think it would have bothered me.”\n\nHe was 22 when he came back from the war. He remembers himself as “an ass, wanting to be liked so much that I would agree with whoever I was talking to, really dishonest about myself, very anti‐authority.” He married, almost immediately, the last girl with whom he had had any contact before he went to the South Pacific. “It was never a marriage. I was a real chippie chaser.” The results of the marriage were daughter, Christine, now 23, a dozen separations, and, some time in 1950 or 1951, a divorce. His second marriage also went sour. With his second wife he had two sons—Michael, 16, who now lives with him, and Stephen, 13.\n\nDURING those first postwar years he was learning his trade as a writer, producer, photographer, director, set designer and film editor of industrial films for the Calvin ,Company in Kansas City. With Lou Lombardo, a cameraman for Calvin, Altman went to Hollywood in the early fifties. The silence was deafening. Leaving Lombardo to bang on closed doors Altman retreated to Kansas City. Lombardo—who remembers Altman as “tall and thin, just as gregarious as he is today and just as prone to go out and charge $1,000 worth of clothes to cheer himself up whenever he is down and out”—is Altman's film editor on “McCabe & Mrs. Miller.”\n\nA few years later Altman returned to Hollywood with a “deal” for a movie. The deal fell through. Again he retreated to Kansas City.\n\nThe third time he went to Hollywood was for keeps. He brought “The Delinquents,” a low‐budget film he had written, produced and directed. In 1957, he and George W. George made a documentary, “The James Dean Story.” For the next six years Altman wrote, produced and/or directed for television. He was fired with regularity. “Because the star of ‘Combat,’ Vic Morrow, couldn't be killed off, I'd take an actor, establish him as an important character in one segment, use him three or four times more, and then kill him early in the next script, offscreen, in way that had nothing to do with the plot. That was unorthodox. It made them nervous. I used to get fired for it.”\n\nWhen he was making $125,000 a year with “my pick of anything, of everything,” Altman quit television. He quit because he did not want to become “one of those hundreds of creative people who have just died in television.” He was, as usual, in debt. Between 1965 and 1967 he did nothing but go deeper in debt. He continued to live in his big, four‐bedroom house in Mandeville Canyon. Although neither the mortgage nor the milkman were paid, he continued to buy what he wanted when he wanted it.\n\n“I finally begged the milkman to cut off our credit and stop delivering milk,” says Kathryn Altman, his third wife. Kathryn is tall, redhaired, beautiful and totally in command of herself. She is a woman with depth and mystery — strong, bright, witty, one of the few people Altman can't bully verbally. (“Bob has overpowered a lot of women,” says actor Mike Murphy of their marriage. “He and Kathryn fight to draw.”) Altman finds her “exciting.” She says of him that “he has driven me crazy but he has never bored me.” She is the mother of his 10‐year‐old son, Bobby. They have also adopted a 4‐year‐old half Negro boy, Matthew. Matthew was Kathryn's decision. She\n\nNow, as a result of “M∗A∗S∗H,” Altman is out of debt. His wife was able to go Christmas shopping last December with cash in her pocket. “The on y way we had a Christmas the other 10 years of our marriage,” says Kathryn, “was because I had charge accounts in my previous name.”\n\nThe money may disappear. (Altman's living expenses were five times as high as the $750 weekly allowance Warner Brothers provided during “McCabe & Mrs. Miller.” One week's rental of a yacht last October cost him $3,200.) But Altman can live artistically for years on the success of “M∗A∗S∗H.”\n\nALL his pictures share a certain desire to show up the world's insanity, but there are also remarkable differences. “M∗A∗S∗H” was crude and tough in its masculine viewpoint and in its use of women as sexual objects.\n\nIn “Brewster McCloud,” man the idealist is physically and emotionally seduced by women who are capable of saving, betraying or destroying him. In “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” the battle of the sexes is fought on more even grounds although woman—the survivor—has the edge. (“Even though the women are all whores, I'm treating them nicely. I'm not portraying them as lascivious women, just as dumb girls. And that was a pretty good job for a girl, a better job than most honest women had.”)\n\nHe explains the extreme differences in viewpoint with “I'm not making any of these films about myself. I'm exploring a situation, not expressing my own fears and feelings.”\n\nHis own fears and feelings are expressed in his way of making movies themselves. “His film style,” says Tommy Thompson, “is a continuation of his life style—or vice versa. Bob has to know everything that's going on. If somebody tells you that the milk didn't come for lunch yet, from halfway across the set he'll roar, ‘What are you going to do about it?’\n\nAltman has intense loyalty to “my people.” (The obverse is a suspicion of people who are not his.) Anybody who works on an Altman film—carpenter, prop man, elec trician, actor—is welcome at his rushes.\n\nEARLY that evening last December there were 72 people and two dogs sprawled on the floor of Altman's Vancouver screening room. During the rushes, Altman watched the people in the room as closely as he watched the screen. “I get a reaction, a feel about the film, even this early.” In his pocket was a plastic bag of marijuana brownies baked for him by some admirer. On his lap was curled 4‐year‐old Matthew, his adopted son. His eyes glittering, his shoulders thrust forward, Altman watched, sipping continuously from plastic cup of Cutty Sark and soda. The moment the cup was empty, his secretary slipped from the room to re\n\nHe has always been—at least in his work—more disciplined than he allows himself to appear. Now his life is more disciplined, too. His gambling has dwindled to football pools and friendly poker games. The big gambling simply doesn't seem necessary to him now.\n\nThe rushes over, the room almost empty but the images from the screening still imprinted in his head, Altman whispered — half‐bravado, half‐epitaph:\n\n“If they should say to me, ‘You'll never see your sons again or your wife unless you get out of the business of making movies,’ I'd have to say, ‘Sorry, Michael, Bobby, Matthew, Kathryn. It will hurt me not to see you again. But good‐by.”"
