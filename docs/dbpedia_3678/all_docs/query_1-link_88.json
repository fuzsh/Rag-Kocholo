        "text": "Cort, believing himself to be a bird in human form, spends his time hidden below the Houston Astrodome constructing a pair of wings that will enable him to fly around the famous sports arena. Although he usually turns to his bird-lady guardian angel Kellerman for advice, he falls victim to stadium usherette Duvall's seductions. She eventually turns him in to the police after learning that he is a suspect in a series of strangler murders that are being investigated by clothes-conscious Murphy. Intentionally confusing, this surrealistic American satire owes more to the anarchic structure of cartoons and the cinema of the French New Wave than to any type of normal American narrative. Director Altman's work, with its lack of focus and its spontaneous shooting style, can either fascinate or infuriate an audience. Unusually told and well-acted, this film, nevertheless, is forgettable."
