        "text": "On July 11th 2024, 4 days after her birthday, American actress and producer Shelley Alexis Duvall passed away, at the age of 75 years old, in her one-story home in Texas Hill Country.\n\nHer death was reported to the Hollywood Reporter by spokesperson Gary Springer. Dan Gilroy, Shelley’s partner of more than 30 years since 1989; they met in “Mother Goose Rock n’ Rhyme” (a 1990 Disney Channel movie), had to this to say about it:\n\n“My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she’s free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley”\n\n1. An overview of her acting career\n\nBorn in Fort Worth Texas on July 7th 2024, Shelley grew up in Houston with three younger brothers: Scott, Stewart and Shane. Her mother, Bobbie Ruth (Massengale) Duvall was a realtor while her father Robert was a lawyer.\n\nShelley started her career with the role of the love interest in the 1970 dark comedy “Brewster McCloud” directed by Robert Altman. Altman discovered her thanks to two of his producers who were at a home party she, a 20 year-old attending South Texas Junior College, organized for her then fiancé (turned husband, married from 1970 to 1977) Bernard Sampson to make his artwork known. What is really special is that Shelley went on to work with Altman, as his muse, on several acclaimed films (seven in total) after this debut. Without any formal acting training.\n\nToday, Shelley is best known by the general public for her more quirky, unique and eccentric characters in movies such as :\n\n“McCabe & Mrs. Miller” (1971): a Western that marked her reunion with Robert Altman;\n\n“Thieves Like Us” (1974);\n\n“Nashville” (1975): another collaboration with Altman, it is a satire of US society, politics and country music. It is today considered as Duvall’s breakthrough role;\n\n“3 Women” (1977): for this Altman movie, she won the Cannes Film Festival Award for best actress in 1977 and earned a leading actress nomination at the BAFTAs;\n\n“Shining” (1980): an horror classic based on Stephen King’s book of the same name, and directed by THE Stanley Kubrick. In it, she played Wendy Torrance, the mother of Danny (Danny Lloyd) and wife of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a creepy and psychopath hotel caretaker abusing her. For many, her role in this movie remains the most notable in her career;\n\n“Popeye” (1980): a comedy with Robin Williams, it is Altman’s musical version of Popeye and, in a way, fate as she got to play the part of Olive Oyl who kids used to utilize to make fun of her for as a child. About her interpretation of the classic cartoon character, Shelley would call it “one of the best things” she has ever done;\n\n“Frankenweenie” (1984): a short film by Tim Burton;\n\n“Roxanne” (1987): a modern reendition of Cyrano de Bergerac with a happy ending, she played Dixie alongside Daryl Hannah and comedy legend Steve Martin.\n\nAfter her most notable roles in the 1970s and 1980s, starting in the 1990s, Shelley began stepping away from acting. She completely disappeared from our screens in 2002 with a last appearance in the independent film “Manna from Heaven”. This absence and her retirement to Central Texas were later credited by Shelley to many factors at least:\n\nthe very ageist film industry who stopped offering her roles and decided to suddenly turn its backs on her,\n\nthe 1994 Northridge earthquake that caused a lot damage to her Los Angeles home\n\nand the stress she felt due to her brother’s spinal cancer.\n\nToday, her very last credited role on IMDB is her comeback in the 2023 indie horror movie “The Forest Hills” by director-writer-producer Scott Goldberg who personally called her to join his movie.\n\nShelly was not only a film icon with a decade long career but she also was producer of several original TV shows. Over the course of her career, she founded two different production companies, Platypus Productions (two years after filming “The Shining”) and Think Entertainment. Both had completely different purposes as the first one was aimed at making star-studded innovative hourlong TV plays (airing on Showtime) out of classic children’s stories. Two examples of this, the most famous, are “Faerie Tale Theatre” (created and hosted by Shelley from 1982 to 1987, it is a Peabody Award winning series in 26 episodes) and “Shelley Duvall’s Bedtime Stories”.\n\nShelley’s thoughts on the creation of the “Faerie Tale Theatre” in the Chigago Tribune, 1993:\n\n“T he cry in Hollywood at the time was, `Where are all the good scripts? Where are the good stories?’ I looked around and nobody was doing some of the great stories of all time, stories that had been tested over centuries”\n\nThe other company was aimed at adapting horror classics Shelley grew up reading (Edgar Allan Poe, Henry James…) for…you guessed it…adults.\n\n2. Pop culture moments\n\nCelebrating pop culture will always remain a main editorial line of this account. To not fall out of line, here are two moments in Shelley’s career that SCREAM how gold pop culture can be:\n\n1- When on May 14th 1977, Shelley was the host of Saturday Night Live with musical guest Joan Armatrading who performed “Love And Affection” and “Down to Zero”:\n\n2- When in 1977 (right before filming “The Shining”), Shelley was interviewed by none other than Andy Warhol for Interview magazine (a magazine he created in 1969!) and Bob Colacello who was the editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1971 to 1983. One quote from this Interview:\n\n“That’s one piece of advice Robert Altman gave me at the very beginning — never take lessons and don’t take yourself seriously.”\n\n2. Shelley to the younger generation\n\nIf there is one thing I try to do as much as I can, is to remember the people that are no longer here by how full of life they used to be.\n\nThat is precisely why I want to share love for a special fan account dedicated to Shelley on Twitter; the account is @shelleyduvallxo (the same as on Instagram and TikTok). It is directed by a fan of Shelley, identified as Sarah, who was fortunate enough to become her friend while she was still alive. All details of her meeting and befriending Shelley are explained in an interview she gave to the TexasMonthly.\n\nThis wonderful fan shared pictures of her meetings with Shelley and thus made Shelley known to a more younger generation. She also made it her mission to preserve Shelley’s privacy as well as her legacy which I can only describe as a very beautiful act of love:\n\nMore generally, she is for me a great way to make a forgotten actress be known again by the younger generation, thus, helping to forge her legacy.\n\nOld pictures: where Shelley’s thin/ lithesome physique, her large expressive brown eyes are on full display (she is called “the Texas Twiggy” by fans because of her particular fashion style):\n\nHer more recent pictures: where Shelley was NEVER afraid of showing her age to the camera (when it is not a very common fact AT ALL )\n\nThe fan also recreated the trend, that appeared on TikTok, of people sharing fashion videos in five distinct outfits with the repetition in between of Shelley’s famous introduction “Hello, I am Shelley Duvall” she gave at the beginning of every show of the “Faerie Tale Theatre”.\n\n3. Conclusion\n\nA natural actress, a talented producer, a woman of the many talents, Shelley remains severy under-recognized by the industry she was in, she has never won any of the major awards (only one nomination for a BAFTA and for two Primetime Emmys), despite her several creative contributions to it…\n\nMay Shelley now rest in peace."
