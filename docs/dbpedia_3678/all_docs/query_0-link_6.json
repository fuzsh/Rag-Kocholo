        "text": "Nicknamed “Texas Twiggy” and called the “female Buster Keaton,” actress Shelley Duvall, who died July 11 at age 75, entered the Hollywood scene in the 1970s, making iconic films such as Nashville, The Shining and Popeye before eventually stepping back from acting in the early aughts.\n\nDiscovered by famed director Robert Altman, Duvall debuted in his 1970 film Brewster McCloud, leading to a seven-movie collaboration. Known for her naturalistic acting style, Texas lilt and lithe frame, Duvall launched into star status after her turn in Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film The Shining, which the actress called “excruciating work” and “unbearable,” due to the intensity of the shoots as well as their emotional toll.\n\nAfter a steady stream of film and television work, Duvall appeared to abruptly leave Hollywood to head back to Texas. She attributed that choice to the devastating 1994 earthquake in Los Angeles suburb Northridge, which damaged her home, as well as her brother’s health. However, she also called out fickle Hollywood in the process.\n\n“I was a star; I had leading roles,” the actress told the New York Times in April, adding that it wasn’t just aging that made her suspicious of the industry.\n\n“How would you feel if people were really nice, and then, suddenly, on a dime, they turn on you?” she asked the outlet. “That’s why you get hurt, because you can’t really believe it’s true.”\n\nWhile Duvall continued to dip her toe in the film and TV world throughout the '90s, she made a firm break in 2002 and stayed away for decades — until her final film, 2023's The Forest Hills. However, she is best known for her work in the '70s and '80s, influential films that are still available to watch.
