        "text": "Theatrical release poster Directed by Robert Altman Produced by Lou Adler\n\nJohn Phillips Written by Doran William Cannon Starring Bud Cort\n\nSally Kellerman\n\nMichael Murphy\n\nWilliam Windom\n\nRené Auberjonois Music by Gene Page Cinematography Lamar Boren\n\nJordan Cronenweth Editing by Lou Lombardo Distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Release date(s) December 5, 1970 Running time 105 minutes Language English\n\nBrewster McCloud is a 1970 American black comedy film directed by Robert Altman.\n\nThe film follows a young recluse (Bud Cort, as the title character) who lives in a fallout shelter of the Houston Astrodome, where he is building a pair of wings in order to fly. He is helped by his comely and enigmatic \"fairy godmother,\" played by Sally Kellerman, as he becomes a suspect in a series of murders and a haughty hot-shot detective lieutenant from San Francisco, played by Michael Murphy, is soon hot on his trail.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe film opens with the usual MGM logo, but with a voice-over by René Auberjonois saying \"I forgot the opening line\" instead of the lion's roar. As the opening credits roll, wealthy Houstonian Daphne Heap (Margaret Hamilton) begins to sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" on the field of the Astrodome, but stops the band, insisting that it's off-key. The band and Daphne start again, while the credits begin again as well. Daphne, who has been off-key herself, insists that this take is much better, but she is surrounded by the young Black band members as we hear Merry Clayton singing an upbeat version of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\", often called the \"Black National Anthem\". All this time, a woman (Sally Kellerman) in a trench coat has been watching from the stands. As the credits end, we see Brewster (Bud Cort), in an Astrodome fallout shelter, where a pet raven defecates on a newspaper headline about a speech by then–Vice President Spiro Agnew. Scenes are interspersed throughout the film of a Lecturer played by Auberjonois regales an audience including an enthusiastic young woman (Jennifer Salt) with a wealth of knowledge of the habits of birds, as he becomes increasingly birdlike himself.\n\nOwlish Brewster lives hidden and alone under the Houston Astrodome and dreams of creating wings that will help him fly like a bird. His only assistance comes from Louise (Sally Kellerman), a beautiful woman who wants to help. Wearing only a trench coat, Louise has unexplained scars on her shoulder blades, suggestive of a fallen angel. She warns Brewster against having sexual intercourse, as it could kill his instinct to fly.\n\nWhile Brewster works to complete his wings and condition himself for flight, Houston suffers a string of unexplained murders, the work of a serial killer whose victims are found strangled and covered in bird droppings. The victims are all authoritarian or overtly racist figures, including Daphne Heap and the aged and wealthy but vicious landlord Abraham Wright (Stacy Keach). Haskell Weeks (William Windom), a prominent figure in Houston, pulls strings to have the Houston police call \"San Francisco super cop\" Frank Shaft (Michael Murphy) to investigate. Shaft immediately fixates on the bird droppings and soon finds a link to Brewster. Brewster eludes the police with the apparent help of Louise but he eventually drives her away—and dooms himself—when he ignores her advice about sex by hooking up with Astrodome tour guide Suzanne Davis (Shelley Duvall). Suzanne saves Brewster by evading Shaft in her stolen Road Runner. Severely injured after losing Brewster, Frank kills himself. Brewster eventually confesses his responsibility in the killings to Suzanne, who betrays him to the police.\n\nA small army of Houston policemen enter the Astrodome but fail to nab Brewster before he takes flight using his completed wings. However, as a human he cannot overcome his inherent unsuitability for flight. Exhausted by the effort, he falls out of the air, crashing in a heap on the floor of the Astrodome. The film ends with a circus entering the Astrodome, played by the cast of the film costumed as clowns, strongmen and other circus performers. The ringmaster announces the names of each cast member, finishing with Brewster, who remains crumpled on the floor.\n\nCast[]\n\nCultural references[]\n\nScenes and characters often allude to other films, some of which include the following:\n\nDaphne Heap is played by Margaret Hamilton, whose best-known role was as the Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film version of The Wizard of Oz. When Daphne is killed, she is wearing sparkling red shoes like those that the Witch wants to take from Dorothy, and a few bars of the film's most famous song, \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" are heard.\n\nDuring the final credit scene, the character Hope (Jennifer Salt) is wearing a blue-and-white gingham dress similar to Dorothy's in The Wizard of Oz and carrying a dog that looks like Dorothy's Toto from the film.\n\nMichael Murphy's character of Frank Shaft wears only turtleneck sweaters and has blue eyes (from contact lenses) to make him look like American actor Steve McQueen in the action cop movie Bullitt (1968).\n\nCharacter Haskell Weeks' name resembles that of Haskell Wexler, a cinematographer whom Altman admired and with whom he considered working on California Split (1974).\n\nSuzanne's apartment features a poster for Altman's previous film, M*A*S*H (1970).\n\nSally Kellerman's character briefly romps in a fountain, recalling both her nude scene in M*A*S*H and the fountain scene in Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960).\n\nThe circus parade during the closing credit scene of the film is reminiscent of the finale of Fellini's film 8½ (1963).\n\nRelease[]\n\nThe film's premiere was at the Houston Astrodome on December 5, 1970. An audience of 35,000 was anticipated."
