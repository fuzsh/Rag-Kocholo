I had several years of season tickets there. Always spent the game in Lefty's Pub watching one of my favorite Astros ever: Moises Alou. I miss the Astrodome days.\n\nPosted by VaBamaMan\n\nNorth AL\n\nMember since Apr 2013\n\n7675 posts\n\nto Lester Earl\n\nI was able to do that in 2003. It was the summer they finished Reliant. I was 17 at the time. Me and a friend snuck in and walked around for about 45 minutes. Actually walked into the guard station and started talking to the guards. After about 10 minutes and asking twice they let us run down on the floor for a few minutes. Ran out to the 50 yard line. Went back to where home plat normally is and mimed playing baseball. Something I will never, ever forget.\n\nPosted by lsusteve1\n\nMember since Dec 2004\n\n42658 posts\n\nto UNO\n\nI've heard they want to make it a possible hotel, convention center, etc.\n\nHouston has Super Bowl in 2017. They'll get upgrade money for Reliant and maybe do something then with the Dome.\n\nSure hope they keep it in some capacity.\n\nThis post was edited on 3/22/15 at 3:49 pm\n\nPosted by Vdrine\n\nBig Bad Baz\n\nMember since Jun 2014\n\n888 posts\n\nto Lester Earl\n\nThis made me think of the movie Brewster McCloud.\n\nquote:\n\nBrewster McCloud is a 1970 movie, directed by Robert Altman, about a young recluse (Bud Cort, as the titular character) who lives in a fallout shelter of the Houston Astrodome, where he is building a pair of wings so he can fly. He is helped by his comely and enigmatic \"fairy godmother\", played by Sally Kellerman.\n\nPosted by FightinTigersDammit\n\nLouisiana North\n\nMember since Mar 2006\n\n36034 posts\n\nto supatigah\n\nMy dad said he saw Sandy Koufax pitch against Robin Roberts that first season in the Dome. SRO crowd. Brought back this huge media guide that I read a thousand times. Wish I still had it.\n\nPosted by Double Oh\n\nLouisiana\n\nMember since Sep 2008\n\n18551 posts\n\nto supatigah\n\n1st game i ever went to Larry Dierker pitched a no hitter i think it was 1972 beat the Expos 6-0\n\nPosted by ballscaster\n\nMember since Jun 2013\n\n26861 posts\n\nto Lester Earl\n\nIf it can be snuck into, why aren't there a ton of homeless people living there?\n\nPosted by Bestbank Tiger\n\nPremium Member\n\nMember since Jan 2005\n\n72889 posts\n\nto lsusteve1\n\nquote:\n\nSure hope they keep it in some capacity.\n\nThis x 1000.\n\nMaybe some kind of hotel/shopping/entertainment complex.\n\nThey also need to put home plate back where it was so people can visit and stand in the batter's box.\n\nPosted by texashorn\n\nMember since May 2008\n\n13122 posts\n\nto Lester Earl\n\nHarris County demolished the exterior ramps that were added in the late 1980s (so not original).\n\nThey have to keep the air conditioning going because of mold issues. I think it's $1 million per year for electric use.\n\nPosted by Hugo Stiglitz\n\nMember since Oct 2010\n\n72937 posts\n\nto Lester Earl\n\nThat's awesome. I went to many games there as a kid."
