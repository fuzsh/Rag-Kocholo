        "text": "33 Films x 6 Decades: 1970s\n\nRanked: Robert Altman\n\nRobert Altman’s Brewster McCloud is a film that is not exactly conventional. Akin to his later film 3 Women, Brewster McCloud plays almost like a dream-like hallucinatory event as we witness this boy Brewster (Bud Cort) try to fly like a bird. Opening with shot of a lecturer (Rene Auberjonois) speak on birds, their relation to humans, and the human desire to fly both because we view flying as freedom and freedom to be flying, Altman sets the tone for the film. This lecturer continues to appear in the film, increasingly demonstrating bird-like behavior to the point that he begins to peck on bird seed, flap his arms, and tuck his legs in and perch himself as if he were a bird, all while his hair continues to look akin to Nicolas Cage’s bird-like hair. A decidedly avian film, Brewster McCloud that is best, as the lecturer suggests, left a mystery. By leaving it a mystery, we allow the material to spin around in our heads instead of coming to a conclusion about what it all means and quickly moving on.\n\nOne of the best touches in Brewster McCloud is how Altman utilizes his typical approach of overlaying audio from one scene with the occurrences of another scene. This occurs throughout the film, namely as the lecturer speaks about birds. As he describes a bird that is aggressive towards strangers, we see a narcotics cop begin to hastle Brewster in the zoo. As he describes a bird with small wings, a big body, and a bony protuberance from its head, we see a fat cop with a white helmet on his head. As he describes a blue-footed boobie and the way in which it will attract a mate, we see Suzanne (Shelley Duvall) step out of a bedroom with a bright blue skirt on. These touches are often what makes Brewster McCloud so funny as Altman seems to practically poke fun at his characters and equate them to birds. This film about the relation between humans and birds with Altman having a grand old time pointing out every single mating ritual, design feature, activity, or clothing, that would make a human look or act like a bird. These moments are plentiful in the film and always deliver both thematically and comedically.\n\nWhen it comes to this film, none of it really feels real. There is no surprise that a lot of references are made to The Wizard of Oz whether it be in the clothes a character wears or a scene that occurs that rather overt references to the classic film. It all feels very dream-like and hallucinatory, especially as Brewster dreams of flying and eventually puts his contraption to use in the Houston Astrodome. This is a film that is very odd to watch as characters act erratically and without reason. This could be a flaw for many, but in approaching the film as a bit of an experimental dream world, it adds greatly to the aesthetic. The inclusion of the detective who just casually shoots himself after a car crash, the detective’s obsession with the bird poop on dead bodies, and the fact that everybody who encounters Brewster gets shit on by a bird right before they die is just so absurd that it defies logic and reason. This is a film that seems to be existing on a different plane of existence, taken from some surrealist dream where a man flew once and then became obsessed with the belief that he was in fact a bird. However, what would be to discount the fact that nobody makes sense. Suzanne and a guy literally have sex in the back of a car with their chauffeur there. Hope (Jennifer Salt) masturbates under a cover as she watches Brewster do pull-ups in a speedo. Brewster never makes a pass at the naked Louise (Sally Kellerman), but does with Suzanne and becomes interested in Hope over the course of the film. This is a film that just makes no sense whatsoever. It kind of just occurs with Altman constantly winking at the audience as if to say, “How bout them apples?”\n\nOne element that I do wish to dissect a bit more, however, is the character of Louise. As she strips naked to bathe or something with Brewster, we see the outline of wings tattooed on her back. Later, she seems to be in every right spot to help Brewster and Suzanne get away from the cops while she drives a car with a license plate that reads, “BRD SHT”. At the end of the film, she walks through the Astrodome to a garage-like opening that lifts up, revealing a heavenly light on the other side as she walks out with her trusted raven on her arm. Given the film’s fairy tale elements, it is hard to see Louise as anything but a fairy godmother (sans wings) for Brewster. She is the one who guides him, cares for him, and protects him from the wiles of women that would prevent him from being able to become a bird. When he sleeps with Suzanne, Louise leaves him to his own devices as he, by having sex, has chosen to be a human and not ascend to his avian potential. In effect, she leaves him to fail without her magic touch to help him succeed in his avian transition. While the potential for her to be some kind of angel (maybe even a fallen one given the raven), it is more likely that she is a fairy godmother due to her seemingly magical capabilities in not just keeping up with the chase scene, but in also managing to assist Brewster through any tight situation that may see him captured or killed. Instead, she steps in with her magic touch and leaves his enemies dead on the ground with bird shit in their eye.\n\nA comical, farcical, and just other-worldly picture from Robert Altman, Brewster McCloud is a film that is tough to decipher as to whether one should take it seriously or just leave it as a dream. What is certain, however, is that to understand this one would be to destroy the magic behind its madness. Seeing it as a dreamy, hysterical, and surreal look at the similarities between bird and man as well as the jealousy held for birds by man, Brewster McCloud is a film with an appeal that is hard to deny."
