        "text": "Welcome to MsMojo, and today we’re counting down our picks for the actors who landed big-time roles purely by mistake, by surprise, or through nontraditional casting processes. Which of these nontraditional castings surprised you the most? Let us know in the comments.\n\n#10: Chloë Sevigny\n\n“Kids” (1995)\n\nThis graphic film about ungovernable New York City street kids inspired a lot of controversy when it was released. Casting relative unknowns, its makers were looking for natural actors in a lot of unconventional spaces. They scoured the city’s skateparks, and neighborhoods in search of the young cast. It was Rosario Dawson’s film debut, and she was found on her front stoop. Up-and-coming model Chloë Sevigny met the writer by chance in Washington Square Park and was later cast in a small role, before being bumped up to the lead when another actress dropped out. Her role as Jennie, an HIV-positive teenager on a mission, announced her as a major new indie star.\n\n#9: Shelley Duvall\n\n“Brewster McCloud” (1970)\n\nKnown for her distinctive look, anchored by a pair of large, expressive eyes, Shelley Duvall’s entire film career started by accident. Director Robert Altman met her at a party while shooting\n\n“Brewster McCloud” in Texas. He convinced her that she should come to Hollywood and play the movie’s upbeat tour guide character, Suzanne. Though she had doubts about working as an actress, she took the job. She would continue to work with Altman, making appearances in many of his films of the 1970s before appearing in what may be her most famous film, Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining.”\n\n#8: Jason Statham\n\n“Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels” (1998)\n\nWhile the future action star was already earning modeling contracts when he made his film debut in this gripping crime thriller, his past may have given his character an air of authenticity. He had spent several years selling knock-off, black market jewelry in London. Director Guy Ritchie met Statham while he was still working as a model, but when he learned of his past, he cast the first-time actor in the role of Bacon. “Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels’” opening scene features Statham demonstrating his salesmanship for a captive audience. Since then, he’s gone on to become a premiere action hero.\n\n#7: Fernando Rey\n\n“The French Connection” (1971)\n\nDirector William Friedkin knew exactly which actor he wanted to play the enigmatic French drug smuggler in his 1971 classic, he just didn’t know the guy’s name. He could only tell his casting director the name of the movie he had seen this actor in. Through a mix-up, he ended up with Fernando Rey, a Spanish actor who had not even been in that movie. It turned out to be a saving grace. The original actor Friedkin wanted could not speak any English. He didn’t exactly have to settle for Rey, because the actor played the villainous Alain Charnier to sinister and chilling effect.\n\n#6: Tippi Hedren\n\n“The Birds” (1963)\n\nWhen she appeared in a TV commercial spot for the Sego diet drink, Tippi Hedren was a working model just trying to make a living. She had no idea her work would become an informal audition for the most famous movie director of the period. As anyone would, she jumped at the chance to be molded as Alfred Hitchcock’s next big star. Her first assignment was the suspense classic, “The Birds.” Her film career may have begun like a fairy tale but it didn’t turn out that way. The grueling schedule and abuse she suffered under him would be difficult even for an experienced actor.\n\n#5: Danny Trejo\n\n“Runaway Train” (1985)\n\nSometimes, life lands you in the right place at the right time. Before he became a cult figure in action movies and comedies, Danny Trejo spent most of his youth in and out of prison. Once out, he turned his life around and ended up working as a substance abuse counselor and film extra. He found himself on the set of 1985’s “Runaway Train,” a prison-set film written by one of his former fellow inmates, who suggested he should train actor Eric Roberts for his fight scenes. This ultimately led to Trejo appearing in a pivotal fight scene, and his career as a character actor began in earnest.\n\n#4: Matthew McConaughey\n\n“Dazed and Confused” (1993)\n\nThe guy in his 20s who still hangs around with teenagers probably wouldn’t be nearly as iconic now, but Matthew McConaughey made him unforgettable. The role of David Wooderson was never supposed to be as big as it turned out to be. After a chance meeting at a bar with the film’s casting director, he was cast in the role. Through the shooting process, his hilarious improvisations led to director Richard Linklater giving the actor more and more screen time. Not only did he end up in the role at the last minute, but it turned out to be the most memorable one in the movie.\n\n#3: Bill Murray\n\n“Garfield: The Movie” (2004)\n\nThis one is kind of understandable but hilarious nonetheless. When Bill Murray got the call to do the “Garfield” movie with writer Joel Cohen, he pictured Joel Coen of the Coen Brothers. But no, this was a different Joel Cohen, and he signed on after reading a few pages. Before he knew it, he was voicing the orange, lasagne-loving tabby cat. While a co-writer of the film disputes his version of events, it’s the story the actor has stuck to since then. Knowing Bill Murray, either one could be true, but we prefer to believe his version.\n\n#2: Lana Turner\n\nSigned to Warner Bros. in 1937\n\nThe story of how this glamorous Hollywood icon was discovered would forever have young aspiring actors hanging out in public places, doing nothing, and waiting to be noticed. Lana Turner’s story was only slightly more complicated than that. She was just a teenager cutting class and enjoying a malt when a publisher just happened to walk into the malt shop and ask if she had ever considered acting. Using his connections, he introduced her to an agent and in 1937, she was signed to Warner Brothers and her film career began. Pretty good for a young girl who never considered acting before then.\n\n#1: Harrison Ford\n\n“Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope” (1977)\n\nBy 1976, Harrison Ford thought his career in movies was over, short lived as it had been, and had taken up carpentry full-time. He was working on a portico for Francis Ford Coppola’s office when writer-director George Lucas asked him to assist with auditions for his new movie, “Star Wars.” They had worked together before, but Lucas only wanted fresh faces. After seemingly auditioning every other age-appropriate actor in Hollywood at the time, Lucas couldn’t find anyone who could give Han Solo the same effortlessly cool demeanor. So, Harrison Ford ended up with the role anyway. It would be the role that would help blast him into superstardom."
