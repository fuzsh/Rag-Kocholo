Their company, Artists Equity, is behind the project, which is set to be directed by Joe Carnahan.\n\nAffleck and Damon won the best screenplay Oscar for “Good Will Hunting” in 1997. They also costarred in that film.\n\nThe childhood friends are longtime collaborators, having also appeared together in the films “Dogma” and “The Last Duel,” as well as “Air,” which Affleck directed.\n\nThey most recently starred together in a Dunkin’ Donuts ad that aired during this year’s Super Bowl.\n\nNo plot details for “RIP” have been publicly shared.\n\nCNN has reached out to reps for Affleck, Damon and Netflix for comment."
