        "text": "Directed by Robert Altman.\n\nOriginal screenplay by Doran William Cannon.\n\nThe summary of this movie, as it appears on my television, is one of the battier movie summaries I’ve read:\n\n“An owlish boy who covertly lives in the Houston Astrodome constructs a pair of human-size wings to realize his dream of flying inside the arena.”\n\nI love baseball and I love the Astrodome, but I hate batty movies from the ’70s…so this should make for an interesting experience.\n\nThe movie begins with the voice of James Stewart saying “I forgot the opening line.” Why this happens, we do not know – particularly because Stewart does not appear as an actor in this film – but hey, let’s take it as a good sign.\n\nThat one voiceovered line fades right into the image of a disheveled professor, surrounded by a large collection of taxidermied birds & bird skeletons, lecturing a class/us about man’s forever fascination with flight.\n\nI like flight. I am intrigued!\n\nThe secondary opening scene, that plays behind the credits, is of a terrible, old-lady singer, who’s dressed from head-to-toe in red, white, & blue, practicing the national anthem on the field at the Astrodome, accompanied by a marching band, the members of which she keeps stopping to yell at, in between stanzas.\n\n…Is that Margaret Hamilton? We never get a closeup, but she yells like Margaret Hamilton. (Was Margaret Hamilton alive in 1970? Is that crazy?)\n\n[Edit: HA! It was Margaret Hamilton!!! I just pulled up the credits on IMDb. I feel very impressive in this moment.]\n\nThis movie is constructed in a rather loony way – but I kind of love it. We flash between scenes featuring the Bird Professor (or voiceover from the Bird Professor), scenes involving the titular Brewster (Bud Cort), the Astrodome, & Brewster’s PiC Louise (Sally Kellerman), and scenes of an imported detective named Frank Shaft (Michael Murphy). All of this appears to be happening in various stages of the past & present, which makes it fairly impossible to identify the order of things, in any linear way. Like I said…it’s rather loony – but we have no choice other than to just go with it, so go with it we shall!\n\nWe are informed via Frank Shaft, as well as by radio voiceover, that a handful of Houstonians have been strangled recently, and their murderer is still at large.\n\nWithin a half hour of all this back & forth footage, we come to guess that either Brewster or Louise (or some combination of the two) is responsible for these deaths, and the crimes have something to do with justice for birds, because the victims keep somehow being associated with birds in enclosures/cages. Also, before these people are strangled (though we don’t actually see the strangling) (which I’m totally okay with), a bird poops on them.\n\nThis is batshit (birdshit???) crazy…but again – I kind of love it, y’all.\n\nThe disheveled Bird Professor is gradually becoming a bird – with intermittent squawking, an orange-tinted nose, and a feasting-on-birdseed break, mid-lecture.\n\nMeanwhile, we spend some time with Brewster in his Astrodome fallout-shelter home. He does hundreds of chin-ups every day and reads about flying from a book he stole from his former employer, Abraham Wright (Stacy Keach), an old-man asshole curmudgeon who got pooped on (and killed) earlier.\n\n(The scene after his death, in which a dead Mr. Wright unguidedly rolls in a wheelchair down several busy Houston roads, is pretty hilarious in its absurdity.)\n\n(Oh, also – the book on flying Brewster stole was once a possession of Abraham’s relatives, the Wright Brothers. You know, the North Carolinian plane ones.)\n\nIn the middle of all of this, there’s suddenly a super artistic dream sequence, where we (/Brewster – it’s his dream) are flying above some clouds, gazing at the sun, while Merry Clayton sings “White Feather Wings.”\n\nThis movie is exquisite in its bizarreness.\n\nNext, Shelley Duvall appears as an Astrodome tour guide named Suzanne who drives race cars in her spare time, and who doesn’t mind at all when Brewster tries to steal her car (an orange and black Roadrunner) to go pick up his bird photos. We instantly love her.\n\n“One night, this guy offered to take me home, so I said okay. Only instead of taking me home, he took me to Memorial Park. And, wow! He tried to rape me! Anyway, I hit him with a lug wrench and drove home. I haven’t seen him since, so…I’ve got this neat little Roadrunner!”\n\nBud Cort plays Brewster’s reactions to Suzanne spectacularly well. At one point, he looks directly at the camera through the rain & Roadrunner windshield, as if to say, ‘This girl might even be loonier than me…and because of that, I might have fallen in love with her, in five seconds flat.’\n\nThe costumer on this movie – who somehow is not credited (?!) – did a fantastic job. Shaft’s rainbow turtlenecks, Louise’s trench coat (and nothing else), Brewster & Suzanne’s matching-but-different red & white striped shirts on the night they meet…it’s all sensational, and I wish I knew who was responsible for it.\n\nThe bird details in this movie are hilarious. The license plate on Suzanne’s stolen Roadrunner is “DUV-222.”\n\nMan, is this a love letter to Houston scenery. The Astrodome, the Houston Zoo, Astroworld, Buffalo Bayou, Memorial Drive…it’s all there, and I find it marvelous that it’s been preserved on film in this way.\n\nOh, lord – Louise’s license plate (who even knew she had a car?) is “BRD-SHT.”\n\nI love the reaction of Suzanne at the stoplight, when she sees Johnson (the local cop, played by John Schuck) behind them. She puts on black leather driving gloves, as well as her seatbelt…and I love Brewster’s reaction to her reaction – because he knows she’s about to fucking floor it.\n\nGood news: Brewster finally decides to sleep with one of these girls. Bad news: he also decides to tell the girl (Suzanne) about his wings, “plans for flying away,” and the fact that he’s responsible for all of these, you know, strangled people.\n\nIn response to this, Suzanne calls her ex, who works for Senator Weeks (William Windom) and is like, ‘Uh, I just slept with this crazy boy who says he can fly and also that he’s a murderer. This seems problematic?’\n\nLouise’s slow-motion walk across the field to the centerfield gate, with the Crow of Death on her shoulder is so outlandishly bizarre. I mean, within the context of the movie, it fits & makes total sense…but pausing to think about it from a real-world perspective? This girl is making her dramatic movie exit from the centerfield gate at the fucking Astrodome, costumed in nothing but a trench coat & wearing a crow on her shoulder.\n\nLike…who in the world was able to think this shit up?! Where did it come from?!\n\nDoran William Cannon, man. What the hell.\n\nI really enjoyed this movie…but I’m not sure I can articulate why, exactly. Perhaps the best way to end this post is with the words Roger Ebert chose to end with, when he wrote about it:\n\n“One could, of course, get into a deep thing about birds and wings and freedom, but why?”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
