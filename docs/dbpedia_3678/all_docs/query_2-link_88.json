        "text": "Sweet Home Alabama | DVD | (06/10/2003) from £3.99 | Saving you £14.00 (350.88%) | RRP £17.99\n\nReese Witherspoon stars in this romantic comedy as a New York fashion designer with a past that holds many secrets, including Jake, the redneck husband she married in high school, who refuses to divorce her.\n\nRose Red | DVD | (10/02/2003) from £4.99 | Saving you £9.00 (180.36%) | RRP £13.99\n\nThe leisurely pace of the horror miniseries Rose Red is like settling into a long book full of detail--a book not unlike those of Stephen King, who wrote the script. The story (about a researcher into the paranormal who takes a team of psychics into a haunted house) recycles themes that King has used before--a telekinetic girl, a house with its own consciousness--but for his fans, the familiarity is probably comfortable and even enjoyable. The cast (including Nancy Travis, Julian Sands, and Melanie Lynsky from Heavenly Creatures) gives committed performances, and the special effects are television-grade but used pretty well. Most of it doesn't make much sense, but at its best Rose Red is absurd and creepy at the same time. --Bret Fetzer\n\nCoyote Ugly | DVD | (06/08/2001) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £11.99\n\nSexy, romantic comedy about a girl in her early 20s who travels to New York with dreams of becoming a songwriter.

The story of a girl for whom a bad stroke of luck is no match for her internal strength and purity of heart. Drew Barrymore plays Cinderella's alleged inspiration, Danielle, in this romantic drama that purports to tell the \"facts\" behind the Grimm brothers' story. One of three daughters of a man (Jeroen Krabbé) who dies and leaves her fate in the hands of a conniving stepmother (Anjelica Huston), Danielle is cast into the lowly role of a servant. Meanwhile, her sisters are evaluated as possible mates for a French prince (Dougray Scott), but he's far more intrigued with Danielle's intelligence and beauty--not to mention her way with a sword and fist. Directed by Andy Tennant (who directed Barrymore in TV's The Amy Fisher Story), Ever After has that rare ability to win the heart and mind of a viewer simply by being committed to its own innocence, particularly where Barrymore's luminous performance is concerned. A contemporary take on an old, virtually forgotten Hollywood convention--the costume adventure with middling artistic ambition but real audience appeal--Ever After is a surprisingly delightful film. --Tom Keogh\n\nBut I'm A Cheerleader | DVD | (17/04/2019) from £4.99 | Saving you £1.00 (20.04%) | RRP £5.99\n\nMegan Williams is a good christian cheerleading girl but perhaps she's taking her love of her team mates a step too far!

Megan Williams (Natasha Lyonne) is a good Christian cheerleading girl. She doesn't think it at all strange that she can't get the image of tumbling cheerleaders out of her mind while her football player boy friend is trying to French kiss her. But her parents, played respectively by Bud Cort (Brewster McCloud) and John Water' s regular Mink Stole, have noticed Megan's odd behaviour and arrange an intervention. They send her off to New Directions, a sexual rehabilitation camp run by a straight-laced school madam, Mary (Cathy Moriarty), where she is forced to come to terms with her lesbian tendencies. But while on a strict regime of corrective therapy, Megan falls head over heels f or surly dyke, Graham--played by Clea DuVall (The Astronaut's Wife)--and is forced to reassess whether straight really is great. The zany script and over-the-top characterisations have the feel of a John Waters comedy; The day-glo sets and costumes give the film a surreal Pee Wee's Playhouse feel and Lyonne is charmingly dizzy and bewildered throughout. RuPaul excels as Mike, a former gay exercise trainer, and Moriarty out-camps them all. On the DVD: The main feature is presented in letterboxed widescreen with Dolby Digital sound. Extra features are limited to a theatrical trailer and a 10-minute behind-the-scenes look at the film in which director Jamie Babbit explains the genesis of the film followed by hastily assembled footage of random scenes being shot. --Chris Campion\n\nCastlerock: Season 1 | Blu Ray | (02/09/2019) from £15.49 | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £N/A\n\nCASTLE ROCK takes viewers into the chilling world of acclaimed best-selling author Stephen King in this psychological horror series from J.J.
