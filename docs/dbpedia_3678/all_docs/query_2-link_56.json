        "text": "*\n\nAn hour later, she collapsed on her bed at the Carlton with her arms full of French postcards, a $75 Omega watch that, was very butch, and $10 worth of marzipan lobsters. “I'm too tired to be interviewed. This Cannes Festival is wild. All yachts and hookers in bikinis and I've never had less sleep or eaten more rich food in my life. I've always been a compulsive eater, which means you take a bag of cookies to bed and watch the Late Show, right? But here I have 20 croissants for breakfast and 300 courses for lunch all covered with mayonnaise and 585 things for dinner and I look like I'm pregnant ... ‘MASH’ is the second highest grosser in the world, they told me yesterday as I was being photographed on some bicycle on the beach, so I said ‘Wow, what's the first?’ and they said ‘Airport’!!! God, can you believe it? When you're second to ‘Airport,’ makes you wonder how good your own picture is, you know? I need some sleep.”\n\nShe crawled under the covers in her clothes. Then she leaped out of bed, picked some chewing gum out of her bathing suit, and wandered about the room folding clothes, flushing the john, throwing panties into suitcases. “I've got to have my house in order before I can talk ... the only thing I can't do is wash a car. I'm going to take all these postcards home and then every one I didn't send one to will get one ... this is going to be a muted interview because I've been telling all these French reporters terrific things for days and they didn't understand a word I said and now I'm too tired to talk. OK. What do you want to know? My background before ‘MASH’? I have no back ground. Where were you the first day I got here? OK I was born in Long Beach, California, and I always wanted to be an actress and now at 32—oh, God, you found out how old I am. Listen, I was a late bloomer. Took me eight years to get my first job on TV. Discovered right away, heh, heh.”\n\nRing. “Hello. Gig? Isn't it great? Yeah, I'm sitting here being dissected ... will you give us the award tonight? Yeah, I can't speak French either ... hello, bonjour, bonjour ... he hung up. That was Gig Young calling to congratulate me ... he's giving out the awards with Candy Bergen. God, nobody has a right to look as good as she does in the day time! Sweet guy, Gig. I used to date him. I've gone with so many guys, but won't tell you their names, because they're all famous and they're all mar ried ... where was I? Oh, yes. When I got out of Hollywood High, I studied with Jeff Corey and went to college on the side just to please my family, but I failed everything except choir ... I was already 5' 10½” in grammar school, so there I was—terrible in college, no ambi tion except to be a movie star and too tall to see in the mirror to even put my lipstick on ... so I decided to con centrate on something worthwhile ... I got a job as an elevator operator that lasted a week because I got car sick ... I was a waitress for one day. I was a mess because I couldn't wear starched napkins and‐high hats, they made me look like the Jolly Green Giant ... I taught swimming! ... I got a job as a secretary on a Friday and learned how to type over the weekend ...I was just never together. But in CLASS! I was the one everybody said would be a star ... AAAGGHH!!”\n\nShe leaped off the bed to show me the piece of marzipan she was eating from the $10 box. It was covered with green mold. “And then, folks in the middle of this terrific interview, Miss Sally Kellerman dropped dead from poi soned candy. Can you believe the way they rook the tourists with this stuff? Then I got a job playing the school dyke in ‘Girls Reform School’ with Ed Kookie Byrnes ... I should get an award for just having the courage to go on after I saw that ... I didn't work again for three years. In all that time nobody thought I was any good except Hugo Haas. I couldn't get myself together long enough to even have my picture taken ... do you know I don't even have a single publicity photo? Then I did a play, ‘Enemy of the People,’ on La Cienega Boulevard and one critic wrote ‘Although her fresh beauty was a de light to the eye, her wooden portrayal leaves her with no potential at all; she should quit the business before further damage is done’ ... I toured with Ozzie and Harriet in ‘The Marriage Go Round,’ then I did a TV show that was so bad they didn't release it for six months.\n\n“I didn't work one day during that period ... I became totally negative ... I've been depressed every day of my life until ‘MASH’ ... anyway, for a while I played cold rich women who shot monsters in outer space ... I looked like Lizabeth Scott and I played girls who got beaten up a lot ... for a girl 5' 10½” I've gotten beaten up more than anyone I know ... then I did my first really big picture, ‘The Third Day,’ in 1965, and I thought ‘Get ready, here comes a big movie star’ ... one of the worst movies ever made. In it I wrote George Peppard dirty letters and got killed in a car wreck in the first scene ... just awful ... Warner Brothers hated me so much they wouldn't even give me a standard con tract ... so Stuart Cohen, who is now my manager, walked into my singing lesson and said ‘Jeez, with your per sonality you should be a variety star! We'll take you out to the topless room at the airport and get you a singing job!’”\n\nThere was a knock and Robert Alt man, the director of “MASH,” came in, thrilled, and she threw her arms around him. “Hey, we won! We don't have to be nice to anybody in French any more!” Altman gave her a gift—a stone eagle sculpture—and she burst into tears and he left, embarrassed. “See, that's why I don't like to talk about the past?? be cause I was a jerk then. Now is what's happening, man ... I was a Fifties child who grew up on Jo Stafford singing ‘See the pyramids along the Nile’ ... I was just doing what was expected of me ... they said ‘You're sexy’ I tried to play sexy parts, they said ‘You're sophisticated’ I tried to play deadly Nina Foch parts ... I was going to auditions in Chanel suits, man, when I met Bob Altman ... now I feel like I'm a woman all of a sudden, I mean I feel like me ... anyway, I got into ‘Breakfast at Tiffany's’ on Broadway ... I went to see David Merrick at the Beverly Hills Hotel and I had my dog, whose name was Holly, with me and my cat, J.R., and they ran all over the room and guess he thought I was crazy because he said Mary Tyler Moore was playing Holly but I could play Meg Wildwood and when left he said ‘By the way, where did you rent the dog and cat and what are their real names?’\n\n“I went to New York, oh God, some of the worst days of my life were in hotels there with athlete's foot on the rug and costing $360 a minute, but David Merrick walked me to rehearsals and he was just fantastic and I didn't have an affair with him or anything! A new phase of my life was beginning and I was going to be a singing Broad way star, but ‘Breakfast at Tiffany's’ turned into a nightmare ... I really liked Mary Tyler Moore, God was she a pro and the rest of us were afraid to walk out in the curtain calls for fear we'd be murdered by the audience ... any way, she was great, but I feel threatened by girls like Doris Day, you know? I mean, I couldn't stand being second bananas, even though Edward Albee was writing scenes for me and David Merrick liked me, but then our names got linked romantically in the papers and he got very upset although I swore it wasn't me who did it and everything was collapsing around us and ‘Break fast at Tiffany's’ never got to opening night in New York so nobody except the hostile preview audiences knew how good I was and I was neurotic and awful and caused a lot of trouble and every body loathed me so I came back here; ...”\n\n“Here? To Cannes?”\n\n“Oh, aren't we in Malibu? I don't even know where I am ... let's see ... I went to in analyst for two years and had a lot of affairs and I had to find out who I was because I was in serious trouble ... I was $10,000 in debt, so I did ‘The Boston Strangler’ playing the victim who lived to tell about Tony Curtis ... I was the one tied to the bed with black eyes and I looked just awful, but I think it was the first time people really thought I could act ... then I played Jack Lemmon's wife in ‘The April Fools’ but it was the same old stupid blonde routine with only seven lines. I was so desperate after that I went to see Bob Altman about ‘MASH’ and I said ‘I'll do anything! I can be funny, I can break loose, just let me try!’ and I think I had hold of his pants legs or something because he took a long look at me and jumped up and yelled ‘HOT LIPS!’ I was there to see about the role of Lt. Dish. I didn't know anything about any Hot Lips, but for the first time in 14 years some body had responded to me, so I just said, ‘Oooh, yes, Hot Lips!’ and I ran right out of the meeting and practically ripped that script apart looking for all the lines belonging to Hot Lips ... on page 40 I found one line, on page 70, another line ... 14 years and at the end of the rainbow a nine‐line part of a soldier called Hot Lips ... I cried for three days ... I screamed at my agent, I yelled at my manager, I told Bob Altman I hated him, I hated his stupid script and I hated his stupid movie and most of all I hated Hot Lips and they could all take their stupid little project and go ?? themselves.\n\n“Well, Bob Altman must have known what he was doing, because he said, ‘Don't worry, you'll have more to do than it says in the script, because I plan to make up this movie as we go along,’ and what did I have to lose? ... it was a gamble ... I could've lost everything ... but Altman is the first director I ever worked with who didn't make me afraid ... he was a great audience ... the things in the movie everyone thinks took a year and a half were totally spontaneous ... we were a family ... the people you see the most of in ‘MASH’ were the ones who worked the hardest ... the assistants didn't even yell, they'd just say ‘C'mon, Sally’ ... even my analyst said it did more for me than a man could ... I'm not kidding ... it was like a two‐ month paid vacation ... that's what the new renaissance in films is all about, feeling good ... it was the first time in my life I'd ever had a real family ... from the first day, Bob told me, ‘If you worry about what you look like, you're fired!’ and now people are asking me if I minded playing a poor lady who gets knocked around by all the men because it is such a blow to Women's Liberation ... oh, no, man ... I was a stiff, rigid Victorian when I got into ‘MASH’ ... Hot Lips changed me be cause she was the only character in the film who was allowed to change ... she ended up gaining from the degra dation ... she was a pill, she needed shaking up, just like me ... she was an uptight bitch, but she ended up part of the family, yelling for the guys in the football game ... the MASH unit for her was like the movie crew for me ... I'm not a Women's Liberationist anyway ... I think people should be allowed to do whatever they want to in life without outside intimidation ... otherwise, I think they're more like Hot Lips was at the beginning of the movie ... most of them look like bull dykes ... I want a man to run my house and make my decisions, man ... when a burglar comes, I want him to be the one to go downstairs.”\n\nThe man who'll go downstairs is Rick Edelstein, a writer‐director she met last summer. They'll be married next year, when she finishes her next film for Alt man, “Brewster McCloud's Flying Ma chine,” in which she will play “the fairy godmother of a boy who tries to fly off the top of the Houston Astrodome. That's all I know, except that I have been told I may also be a bird woman from a foreign planet and I haves bird wing scars on my back and wear a trenchcoat ... I haven't read it‐yet, but it doesn't matter because I would do anything for Bob Altman and I won't have to wear Army fatigues ... then I'm going to do a rock album and I just did a cut on an album of music from ‘The Adventurers’ in which I fake 20 orgasms to music ... I don't want to get locked into anything and that's why it's hard for me to give interviews be cause I can't be typed as either a come dienne or a siren and I'm sorry I've had so little to say in this interview but should catch good day ...”"
