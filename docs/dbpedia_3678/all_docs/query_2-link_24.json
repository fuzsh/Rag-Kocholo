Frank Shaft:\n\nI'm six one, Milhouse.\n\nButler:\n\nYou are? I'm five nine and you look shorter than me.\n\nDet. Lt. Frank Shaft:\n\nYou're standing on the steps.\n\nButler:\n\nOh. So I am.\n\nDet. Lt. Frank Shaft:\n\nAlright, where were you when you interviewed him?\n\nButler:\n\nHere. Right here, where we are.\n\nDet. Lt. Frank Shaft:\n\nYou were up there and he was down here. Is that right?\n\nButler:\n\nI think so.\n\nDet. Lt. Frank Shaft:\n\nLet's see, those steps are about eight inches, so that means if he was six foot one he would have looked to you to be about 16 inches shorter. About four nine.\n\nButler:\n\nRight. Under five feet. Short. Only I think I was down here. [He steps down to the floor] And he was there. [Shaft climbs up one step]\n\nDet. Lt. Frank Shaft:\n\nWhat the hell would he be doing up here?\n\nButler:\n\nWell, he was short, like I said, and maybe it made him feel better.\n\nDet. Lt. Frank Shaft:\n\n[Shaft sits on the step] Alright, he was up here and you were down there. Is that right?\n\nButler:\n\nRight.\n\nDet. Lt. Frank Shaft:\n\nAnd he looked to you to be about four foot nine?\n\nButler:\n\nThat's right, short.\n\nDet. Lt. Frank Shaft:\n\nJesus Christ, Milhouse, if he was four foot nine and he was standing on sixteen inches of steps that'd make him only three foot five."
