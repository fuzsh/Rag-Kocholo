        "text": "We regularly write about the passing of celebrities with geek-friendly credits in our Good-byes category. However, we aren’t always able to write a post for everyone, especially near to the time we may hear the report of a death. This page will list them.\n\nStarting in 2018, we began including the Geek Factor score we created for Battle of the Network Stars (slightly adapted, since it included people with no geek credits, and those won’t be listed here).\n\nGeek Factor\n\nGeek Factor Unknown (GF?): it can be hard to determine the Geek Factor with celebrities with primarily non-English credits\n\nGeek Factor 1 (GF1): perhaps a few scattered minor roles\n\nGeek Factor 2 (GF2): at least one featured geek-friendly role\n\nGeek Factor 3 (GF3): at least one starring geek-friendly role, or a featured geek-friendly role based on an existing gf character, or multiple featured geek-friendly roles\n\nGeek Factor 4 (GF4): more than one starring gf role, or a starring GF role based on an existing GF character, or an established career as a geek-friendly supporting player…thought of by the public as a geek-friendly actor\n\nGeek Factor 5 (GF5): icon\n\nI do try to improve these, so I thought in 2019 I’d explain my wording. When I say someone was “in” something, it means a movie or a one time (guest) appearance. If they were “on” a show, it means a recurring/regular role (I usually assess that at at least 3 episodes).\n\nFor universes alphabetization, fictional characters are usually alphabetized by their first names, real people by their last names\n\nUniverses affected (see below for individual listings):\n\n#50YearCareerClub: Peter Bogdanovich; Sally Kellerman; Conrad Janis; Mitchell Ryan; Akira Takarada; Lawrence Dane; Michel Bouquet; Gloria Sevilla; Robert Morse; Jacques Perrin; Kenneth Welsh; Susan Roces; Bo Hopkins; Philip Baker Hall; Jean-Louis Trintignant; Frank Williams; Mona Hammond; James Caan; Larry Storch; L.
