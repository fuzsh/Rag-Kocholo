        "text": "While her filmography isn‚Äôt as long as many would have liked it to be, Shelley Duvall cemented her lasting legacy almost immediately as a truly singular screen presence. A muse of Robert Altman throughout the 1970s who would go on to work with directors including Stanley Kubrick, Tim Burton, Jane Campion and Steven Soderbergh, Duvall transfixed with an ethereal effervescence, somehow being the coolest person you‚Äôve ever seen while also holding a fragility that looks as though she might crumble at any moment.\n\nThat latter quality was utilized to perfection in The Shining, and after the actress‚Äôs passing last week, –¥arina used the chilling Kubrick film to pay tribute to this incomparable performer, writing: ‚ÄúWhen I saw Shelley Duvall on screen for the first time, I was struck by her presence. She acted like no one else. There was a certain uniqueness that I never saw in any other actress. She has inspired me so much throughout the years, I even started auditioning for plays because of her. The first time I got the lead part I felt so proud, I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have been motivated to such an extent if i didn‚Äôt have her as an idol.‚Äù\n\nAn idol to some, an icon to many, Letterboxd members have spent the past week honoring Duvall‚Äôs gifts with first-time viewings and rewatches of some of her finest work. A perennially popular pick on Letterboxd, The Shining saw its numbers skyrocket with over 5,000 members logging it in the two days following Duvall‚Äôs passing on July 11, compared to its usual tally of around 1,000 per day. Altman‚Äôs 3 Women typically lands about 40 or 50 watches a day, but jumped up to 700 folks logging it on the 11th, while nearly 3,000 people added the film to their watchlists. In one review of 3 Women, Tomer details the star‚Äôs ‚ÄúEnchanting presence, her odd aura, her captivating peculiarity, her breathtaking beauty, her delicacy yet also her class.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPlease, be safe, kind to each other and happy,‚Äù the YouTube description reads in the beloved montage of Duvall‚Äôs many renditions of her introduction to the children‚Äôs program Faerie Tale Theatre. It‚Äôs a message to live by, and one that permeates through her graceful work on screen. Here‚Äôs a sampling of what Letterboxd members have been writing since her passing about some of Duvall‚Äôs most memorable performances.\n\n3 Women (1977)\n\n‚ÄúShelley Duvall is just a stunning performer. Her body language, tone, and mannerisms throughout this movie were so fitting as she really built Millie. I read that Altman had her write her own diary entries and recipes for the character, and I also found the way she continued to speak and align her body to the people she was talking to (even when they didn‚Äôt care for her and even ignored her) really great. Duvall is always recognized and regarded for her performance as Wendy in Kubrick‚Äôs The Shining, but I find her working relationship with Robert Altman more sensational. With what I‚Äôve seen, they clearly understood one another very well and Altman really knew how to write and direct her. In particular, choosing her for the character of the vain Millie felt downright perfect. She‚Äôs stellar in this. Alongside the dynamic Sissy Spacek, this dream-based film felt all the more dreamlike and sensationalized. Duvall and Spacek played off of one another very well. Shelley Duvall was a shining light in the industry and a darling, and she will be missed so greatly.‚Äù ‚Äîmilkywee\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve written so many reviews on this app about this movie, many fairly long. In every review there is one thing I always mention though, just how fantastic Shelley Duvall is as Wendy Torrance. Genuinely one of my favorite performances of all time. She plays the broken and beaten down housewife that manages to find her strength and rise up to protect her son so well. Whether it‚Äôs in this film, 3 Women, Nashville, or even damn Popeye she always gives a great performance and had such a unique and wonderful screen presence. RIP Shelley, you‚Äôll certainly be missed but thank you for all the fantastic performances we have to remember you by. This one really sucks üò¢‚Äù‚ÄîDave G\n\nBrewster McCloud(1970)\n\n‚ÄúAs soon as I heard about Shelley Duvall yesterday, I knew exactly what film I should watch in her memory: her very first. She makes an undeniable impression here, with both a role and a performance that set the template for what was to come. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs especially controversial to say that no director knew how to use her distinctive presence better than Robert Altman, and though she‚Äôd become a better actress than she is here, as a first go at playing a slightly vacuous kook with enough guileless innocence and naked emotion that she‚Äôs never solely an object of mockery, this is pretty admirable.‚Äù‚ÄîAlbie Hay\n\nPopeye(1980)\n\n‚ÄúAltman got lucky that at the moment he made Popeye, the two most perfect possible actors for the assignment were around to play the lead roles. It‚Äôs impossible to imagine anyone but Robin Williams pulling this character off, and even harder to imagine anyone but Shelley Duvall making a live-action Olive Oyl work so perfectly. I adore them both here. I love Williams‚Äô constant mumbling over the movie, the convincingly rubbery way he moves his legs, his entire commitment to the part‚Äîand also that indescribable sweetness and humanity he brought to every part he ever played. Popeye is a cartoon character, but his desire to meet his Paps feels so earnest and real, and his commitment to being a good mother for Sweet Pea is impossible not to smile at. Duvall, meanwhile, makes this ridiculous lanky cartoon damsel come to life in ways that are both consistently funny and heartfelt, with the ‚ÄòHe Needs Me‚Äô number threading that needle to astonishing effect. God, what an actor!‚Äù ‚ÄîJonathan Lack\n\nNashville (1975)\n\n‚ÄúRest in peace Shelley Duvall. This has been one of the biggest personal losses for me in Hollywood. She‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs favorite actress, and I grew up watching her in Popeye and Casper. Her scenic presence is always strong, even in those, and she was so effortlessly cool but in a genuine way. Late ‚Äô60s/early ‚Äô70s art has always been a source of escapism for me, and her ability to transform into characters has helped make that era very memorable. In my opinion, though, LA Joan in Nashville might just be her best performance. Her outfits are iconic, and her flirtatiousness even more so. In a cast full of crazy freaks, she stands out as the craziest freak and I love her for it. We lost a real queen today.‚Äù ‚ÄîJoe Lollo\n\nThe Portrait of a Lady(1996)\n\n‚ÄúNicole Kidman is absolute perfection here. Richard E. Grant‚Äôs never been more handsome. Martin Donovan, the consumptive cousin/suitor, proves he has more range than his usual unemotional deadpan and was a quiet revelation. I dislike John Malkovich‚Äôs acting, but he makes a perfect slimy and perverse villain. John Gielgud around to class things up. Shelley Winters always a joy. Mary-Louise Parker almost unrecognizable as dowdy lady journalist. Christian Bale brings the youthful longing. Barbara Hershey also perfect. Shelley Duvall playing the flighty spinster for comedy in every scene and then disclosing the ugly truth at the heart of Isabel‚Äôs marriage‚Äîamazing! And Viggo Mortensen... I‚Äôd choose his Goodwood (ha!) over any and all Mr. Darcys any day of the week! Honestly, just an incredible cast and worth a look for that alone.‚Äù ‚Äînikki 26\n\nThieves Like Us(1974)\n\n‚ÄúA love letter to the little moments, the moments in between action when we are able to be ourselves with one another and just exist. The conversation we have while listening to the radio, sharing an immutable time for as long as we can. Most of the bank robberies are not shown, just the response of the three men and how it marks their future decisions. Shelly Duvall is the heart of this, exuding charm and sweetness instinctively; you were so beautiful, rest in peace.‚Äù ‚ÄîHugo Patterson\n\nMcCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971)\n\n‚ÄúAs soon as I finished, started the movie again to watch the first twenty minutes right away. Altman draws you in, McCabe (Warren Beatty) and Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie) are our main characters but the whole town of Presbyterian Church, Washington is alive and bustling‚Ä¶ Major shout out to Shelley Duvall, may you rest in peace; I felt less lonely in the world when she was on screen and her performance in this was fantastic. I love how this movie doesn‚Äôt spell anything out for you, there‚Äôs a lot to read into the characters. It‚Äôs a straight flush for McCabe & Mrs. Miller, looking forward to the next time I get to watch this.‚Äù ‚Äîyepitisnathan\n\nRoxanne(1987)\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an odd premise that sort of falls apart when it leans in too much into the swooning poetry of its source material, but at its best it‚Äôs a solid blend of late-period Steve Martin‚Äôs sweetness with flashes of early-period Steve Martin‚Äôs absurdist bite peppered throughout. We decided to throw this on after hearing of Shelley Duvall‚Äôs passing, and even though she‚Äôs in a smaller supporting role here (as she often was), she radiates a familiar warmth here that makes the whole movie feel lived-in.‚Äù ‚ÄîEthan Rubenstein\n\n‚ÄúI love me a good Frankenstein adaptation. I‚Äôve seen countless, but this might have been one of the cutest. I just really wish this was feature-length so it had some room to breathe because the plot moves along at a comically fast pace (I know there‚Äôs the CGI version but it looks nowhere near as charming or cute). Also, RIP to the sweetest Shelley Duvall. In all her performances and public interviews she couldn‚Äôt help but always exude goodness and grace. A beautiful soul.‚Äù ‚Äîar burton"
