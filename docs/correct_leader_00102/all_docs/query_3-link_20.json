The Danish economics minister is a heavy smoker – her favourite brand is King’s (without filter), the Danish equivalent to a Frenchman’s Gauloise – and she enjoys few things more than a stiff whisky after a hard day’s work.",

        "text": "So she knows exactly how much money can be saved by buying goods at the airport on the way to one of her numerous meetings in Brussels instead of in a grocery store in heavy-dutied Denmark, where the prices of tobacco and alcohol are among the highest in Europe.\n\nShe has nevertheless won notoriety as the politician who, more than any other in Europe, wants to abolish duty-free sales in the EU, even if it means standing up to fellow finance ministers and Union heavyweights Gerhard Schröder and Tony Blair on her own.\n\nAll eyes will be on Jelved next week when finance ministers meet in Brussels to consider EU leaders’ calls for an extension of duty-free sales inside the Union.\n\nShe has few allies in her fight, but it is a sign of her political ingenuity that she has forged an alliance with her countrywoman, Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard. In a highly unusual move, the two issued a joint press release insisting on the demise of duty free and even suggested that diplomatic perks for national civil servants posted abroad in Europe should also be phased out.\n\nFor those who know Jelved, her firm stance on the issue has not come as any surprise. She is renowned for abiding by her principles when making political decisions, and has already warned that she is prepared to use Denmark’s right of veto to block a stay of execution for duty free.\n\nThis is not a threat which can be dismissed lightly. When the former schoolteacher decides to take a stand, she usually gets what she wants.\n\nEven though her social liberal party won only 5% of the votes in the latest election, compared with the 30% obtained by the Social Democrats, it wields enormous power in Denmark’s coalition government, as Social Democrat Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen knows only too well. During his six years in office with Jelved as his most important – and today, his only – coalition partner in different minority governments, he has often had to deal with her party’s readiness to jeopardise the government’s future in order to get its way.\n\nIn October 1997, Rasmussen was planning to take the opposition by surprise by calling a snap general election at a time when the Conservative Party was in the midst of a serious crisis over a proposal on compulsory savings. The plan had been firmly rejected by the government’s right-wing opponents in parliament, but the two largest opposition parties suddenly performed an about-turn at the 11th hour and gave the government what it wanted.\n\nFor Jelved, that was the end of the matter. But Rasmussen wanted to go ahead and call the election anyway. With the entire parliament waiting in the house and the nation following the drama minute by minute on television and radio, Rasmussen cooped himself up with Jelved in his office for two and a half hours trying desperately to persuade her to agree. She threatened to leave the coalition and, once again, ended up getting her way.\n\nJelved’s preference for taking a clinical and analytical approach, rather than relying on emotion, has made her a highly respected senior minister. But it also means she will probably never be elected most popular Dane of the year.\n\nMost Danish children become acquainted with Jelved at an early age. As a schoolteacher, she wrote a number of educational books before she was elected to the national parliament in 1987 and embarked on a full-time career in politics.\n\nHer rise was meteoric. A year later, she became leader of the parliamentary group of her party, the Radical Left, which, despite its name, is a liberal party at the centre of the political spectrum. It is one of the smallest parties in the Folketing, but its influence far outweighs its size. In a country where majority one-party governments are rare, the Radical Left has been in a position to decide the name of the prime minister for the past 20 years.\n\nJelved learned early on how to take maximum advantage of this. As her party’s leader in parliament, she made no secret of the fact that the Social Democrat leader at the time, Svend Auken, was not her cup of tea. This was crucial to Rasmussen’s success in ousting his rival and taking over as party leader.\n\nLess than a year later, Conservative Prime Minister Poul Schlüter was forced out of office by a scandal involving the repatriation of Tamil refugees. It was then that Jelved first demonstrated that sticking to her principles was more important to her than advancing her own career.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to hold on to power, Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen offered her the job of prime minister in a new, centre-right government. Jelved declined the offer. A few weeks later, Rasmussen formed his first government with Jelved as economics minister.\n\nHer strategy was simple. Welfare reforms were an absolute necessity, Social Democrat support was essential to getting them through, and it would have been unthinkable for them to champion the cause if they were not in government.\n\nSince 1993, Rasmussen and Jelved have succeeded in bringing unemployment down to one of the lowest levels in Europe without damaging other aspects of the economy.\n\nWhen Denmark held its first referendum on possible membership of the EEC in 1972, Jelved was among those who voted ‘no’, as she did in a 1986 vote on Danish ratification of the Single European Act.\n\nBut since then, she has undergone a transformation to become one of the most ardent pro-Europeans in Eurosceptic Denmark. She is firmly in favour of Danish entry into the euro zone, although reluctant to call a referendum on the issue yet.\n\n“Many Danes feel betrayed by the political class after the ‘no’ to the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, and I have great respect for that sentiment. I don’t want to force a referendum before people are marching in the streets to get the euro,” she has said.\n\nJelved’s analytical approach to any question often makes her seem didactic in media appearances, and she hates it when people remind her that she used to be a teacher. She insists that she is simply trying to make her point as objectively as possible, but others do not portray her that way.\n\n“But it is excessively irritating that no matter what I say or do, I am presented as the schoolteacher. It is being used as a kind of an invective, and if I give my opinion on something that is inconvenient for anyone, it is ‘the school teacher wielding the big stick’. I am deeply bothered by this,” she said recently.\n\nWhen Jelved rejects calls for an extension of duty-free sales, it is because she has heard no convincing arguments for a reprieve. “If it is all about jobs, we might as well propose a value added tax exemption for the large warehouse that closed down in Copenhagen recently,” she argues.\n\nMoreover, Jelved believes other shopkeepers will benefit from the abolition of duty free. “I am not going to smoke or drink any less just because duty free disappears, so it will probably be good news for my local grocery shop,” she says.\n\nShe is also angered by the idea of rich lobbyists being able to order the EU’s top politicians about, accusing them of waging a “disgraceful” campaign. “What will be left of our credibility if we, after a transitional period of eight years, let ourselves be persuaded to reprieve the abolition further?” she asks.\n\nThere were widespread rumours at last December’s EU summit in Vienna that Jelved had once again threatened to leave the government if Rasmussen gave in to those calling for an extension of duty free. She herself denied it with a typical riposte. “If I left the government, I would only risk not getting my way.\n\nThat would be a very stupid thing to do,” she said, adding in the words of Danish author Henrik Ibsen: “He who stands alone, stands strong.”"
