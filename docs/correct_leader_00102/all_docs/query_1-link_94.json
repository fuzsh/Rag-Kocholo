        "text": "Thanks DealStreetAsia for picking this up. I am happy to announce that we have acquired a substantial majority stake in Milvik Bima through CapitalSG. Milvik Bima is one of the leading digital health and insurance companies across global emerging markets. Gustaf Agartson and Mathilda Strom have built a brilliant business that already touches the lives of 20 million consumers in Asia and Africa. We look forward to working closely with Bima’s Founders and Management to help scale the business further and to build a profitable, sustainable business. We are also delighted that LeapFrog Investments continues to support Bima and has co-invested with us. There are 2 Billion emerging consumers in Asia and Africa who don’t have adequate affordable access to healthcare. Bima is working hard to solve this problem. CapitalSG is honored to be a part of this endeavor. Gustaf Agartson, Mathilda Strom, Stewart Langdon, Fatin Mattar, Michelle Nijun Duan, Bratindra Chakravorty, Mitar Milic, Mafaz Mazeen, Gibron Khalil Mirza, Damien Gueroult, Rotha Leang, Balaji Jayavelu, Harish K.\n\nBack in 2016, we took a call to focus our VC investments in the Fintech sector in Emerging Asia. It was a relatively narrow niche then. Happily my anchor LPs (FMO Holland and SBI Holdings Japan) supported the decision. And they gave me the opportunity to build an initial Fintech portfolio over the next few years. I am delighted to see how far the Emerging Asian Fintech Sector has come in the last 5 years and the quality of the Fintech companies emerging from the region. We have been extremely selective in our investments, but I also think we got quite lucky with both the sector and the timing. While most of the companies in our Fintech portfolio are doing well, I will discuss them some other day. Today is NIUM’s day! As you must have read, Nium is now a Fintech Unicorn – a rare beast in SE Asia. What an incredible journey for a company that was started just 7 years back! I can talk about Nium's leadership or its marquee investor base. And I can talk about the resilience that Nium’s global teams have demonstrated over the last 18 months of covid. But to me the most attractive thing about Nium continues to be the massive size of the opportunity. Nium has grown from a small startup into a unicorn in 7 years – and I am convinced that the company could easily be 10-20x larger in the next few years. As a Singapore VC, its not often that you get to be involved in building a global product and brand. So kudos to Prajit Nanu and the entire NIUM team for giving us this opportunity. Looking forward to the next 5 years of this journey!
