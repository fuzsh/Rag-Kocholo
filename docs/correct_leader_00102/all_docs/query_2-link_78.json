        "text": "Danish voters concerned that immigrants exploit the welfare system shifted to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election, giving the opposition enough seats to form a new government after eight years of having the Social Democrats in office. Opposition Liberal Party Leader Anders Fogh Rasmussen said last night he was prepared to form a new government as national election results showed his party leading in parliament. With 55 per cent of the ballots counted, the Liberal-led coalition had 97 seats, compared with 78 for the Social Democratic coalition led by Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. AP, AFP"
