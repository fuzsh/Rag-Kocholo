Since 2004 Commission President José Manuel Barroso has talked much about flexicurity, the Nordic model and a social Europe without actually putting forward new concrete ways for member states to provide better forms of social protection and security, or by giving new momentum to tripartite social dialogue, which is the foundation of flexicurity.
