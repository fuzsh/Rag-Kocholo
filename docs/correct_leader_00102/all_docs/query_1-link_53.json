The 1849 Constitution established a two-house legislature and a responsible ministry. The vote was restricted to males who met a property qualification. In 1915 the vote was extended to all adults, including women, and in 1953 the upper house of the legislature was abolished.\n\nDenmark was occupied by Germany 1940-45. As a result of this experience Denmark abandoned its traditional neutrality and joined NATO in 1947. Denmark joined the European Union in 1972.\n\nDanish politics were dominated for 40 years by the centre-left Social Democracy in Denmark, which came to power under Thorvald Stauning in 1929, but its dominance has faded since the 1970s. The left-wing vote has fragmented, with the Socialist People's Party, the Radical Left-Social Liberal Party and the Unity List-The Red Greens also represented in the legislature. The largest party on the right is the Liberal Party of Denmark, which is allied with the Conservative People's Party and the Christian People's Party. The Danish People's Party, a far-right populist party, has upset the traditional pattern of Danish politics.\n\nThe Social Democrats were in office under Poul Nyrup Rasmussen from 1993 to 2001. They were defeated at the 2001 election and the Liberal leader Anders Fogh Rasmussen formed a government. He was easily re-elected in 2007. In 2009 Rasmussen resigned to become Secretary-General of NATO and was succeeded by Lars Lokke Rasmussen. (The three Rusmussens were not related.) At elections in September 2011 a left-wing coalition headed by the Social Democrat leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt was elected.\n\nUpdated November 2011"
