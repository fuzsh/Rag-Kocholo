        "text": "Michael Bramsen sent a letter last month to the 16 Danish Euro MPs outlining a novel idea.\n\nHe proposed the production of tiles carrying the images of the elected representatives which could then be sold to the Danish public as gifts.\n\nOne of the first replies came from Lone Dybkjær, the Euro MP whose husband is Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.\n\nWith more than a hint of irony, she thanked Bramsen for his highly original notion and said that, as luck would have it, she had been thinking of redesigning her kitchen.\n\nShe suggested that perhaps the scheme should be extended to include political party leaders so that her new kitchen could be decorated with her husband’s profile instead of her own: “After all, he is the one who does the cooking.”No truth, apparently, in the rumour that other money-making publicity stunts in the pipeline include Euro MP oven gloves, Euro MP toilet brushes and Euro MP luminous garden gnomes."
