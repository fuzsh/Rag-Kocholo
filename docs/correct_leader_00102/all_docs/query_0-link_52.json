        "text": "An Organisational Agreement has been signed between WorldSkills Europe and WorldSkills Denmark for the hosting of the ninth EuroSkills Competition in 2025.\n\nThe signing ceremony, which took place at the Danish Ministry of Children and Education in Copenhagen on 25 November 2021, was attended by the newly appointed Chairman of EuroSkills Herning 2025, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, WorldSkills Europe Chair of the Board, Ms.Teija Ripattila, and by the Danish Minister of Children and Education, Ms. Pernille Rosenkrantz-Theil. The CEO of WorldSkills Europe, Ms. Laurence Gates, and the Chairman of WorldSkills Denmark, Mr. Søren Heisel, were also present.\n\nThe Danish city of Herning was confirmed as host of the ninth EuroSkills Competition following a unanimous vote by WorldSkills Europe Member Countries at an extraordinary General Assembly virtual meeting which took place on 16 September 2020.\n\nTeija Ripattila, Chair of the Board of Directors, WorldSkills Europe said, “We are incredibly thankful to WorldSkills Denmark for having agreed to organise a EuroSkills event on behalf of all 31 WorldSkills Europe Member Countries that participate in our biennial Championships of Young Professionals.”\n\nWorldSkills Denmark worked closely with the Danish Government, the Trade Union Movement’s Main Organisation, the Danish Employers’ Association, Herning Municipality, the Central Jutland Region on the bid to bring EuroSkills to Denmark as part of an ambitious overall strategy to get more young people to choose vocational education.\n\nRipattila continued, “We are equally thankful to the Danish government and all the sector and partner organisations in Denmark that are supporting WorldSkills Denmark on this project. We know that an international event of this scale would not be possible without such high-level national commitment and support. We place strong trust and confidence in WorldSkills Denmark, who we know will deliver, with the support of the Danish government and all partners and stakeholders, an exceptional EuroSkills event for our Members.”\n\nChairman of EuroSkills Herning 2025, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said, “Denmark and EuroSkills Herning 2025 are excited to welcome all WorldSkills Europe Member countries to Herning to provide hundreds of Europe’s most talented young skilled professionals an opportunity to compete against the best of the best. Our ambition with this championship is not only to create increased focus on VET in Denmark, but also to raise the standards of excellence in technical and vocational education and training and provide inspiration for developing the trades and skills across Europe – and lasting relations between countries on all levels.”\n\nIn her speech at the official signing ceremony, Danish Minister of Children and Education, Ms. Pernille Rosenkrantz-Theil said, “We are very enthusiastic about hosting EuroSkills in 2025 – a gathering of the best European VET students and a platform for exchanging experiences across borders and across cultures, a hub for inspiration for developing the VET system in Europe. WorldSkills Europe has given us so much, and now it is time for us to give back by hosting the EuroSkills Competition in 2025. We are committed to making EuroSkills Herning 2025 a success, both for the young Competitors and for the perception of VET in general.”\n\nNew dates confirmed for EuroSkills Herning 2025\n\nOriginally scheduled for 2024, WorldSkills Europe and WorldSkills Denmark announced in December 2020 that EuroSkills Herning would be moved by one year to 2025 due to the postponement of EuroSkills Graz to 2021, and EuroSkills St Petersburg to 2023.\n\nEuroSkills Herning 2025 will take place between 8–14 September 2025 and will be held at MCH Messecenter Herning, the largest exhibition centre in Scandinavia.\n\nThe city of Herning is home to a thriving industrial sector, with a large international workforce focusing on a shift towards Industry 4.0. This is a result of a long-standing tradition of close cooperation between local industry and businesses, educational institutions, elementary schools and the municipality.\n\nInitial planning meetings for EuroSkills Herning 2025 will now be scheduled between the WorldSkills Europe management team and representatives of WorldSkills Denmark."
