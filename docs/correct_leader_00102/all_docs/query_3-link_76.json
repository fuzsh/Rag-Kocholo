        "text": "By Line Vaaben Juhl and Thomas Vennekilde in Copenhagen\n\nThe new Prime Minister of Denmark, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, was greeted with rapturous applause from colleagues as the scale of his election victory became clear.\n\nThe Danes had a wish for change - for new faces - after nine years with the same people in power\n\nSocial Democrat ex-minister\n\nNot only did the right-wing in Parliament - a coalition of his Venstre (Liberal) Party, and the Conservatives - gain power after nine years in opposition, but Venstre is now also the biggest party in Denmark.\n\nThe right's triumph appears to have built on a mixture of two key elements.\n\nFirstly, it seems the electorate was ready for change after nine years of Social Democrat-led government, presided over by the European Union's longest-serving Prime Minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.\n\nSecondly - and perhaps more importantly - the opposition campaign successfully tapped into public concerns over immigration, which increased dramatically in the wake of the 11 September attacks, but which had already been dominating political debate.\n\nIn the end, the campaign focused almost entirely on immigration.\n\nMr Fogh Rasmussen, who was behind in the polls when the snap election was called three weeks ago, has now pledged to run a broad-based administration.\n\n\"Uniting the Danish people is a great challenge. The necessary reforms must be carried out with support from a broad spectrum of political parties,\" he said.\n\nBut he will probably not find much co-operation from the left wing parties in parliament.\n\nThe Social Democrats had a disastrous election, losing 11 out of 63 seats in parliament.\n\nSocial Democrats have already begun analysing the reasons for their defeat.\n\n\"The Danes had a wish for change - for new faces - after nine years with the same people in power,\" the Minister of Tax Affairs, Frode Sorensen, said.\n\nAnalysts also point to the fact that the party spent more energy during the campaign attacking the opposition, than actually explaining their own policies.\n\nI will not run away with my tail between my legs - the party will raise itself again\n\nOutgoing PM Poul Nyrup Rasmussen\n\nAs soon as the disappointing result was known, speculation began on whether defeated Prime Minister Rasmussen would resign as party leader.\n\nBut Mr Rasmussen, visibly moved, refused.\n\n\"I will not run away with my tail between my legs. The party will raise itself again,\" he declared, before striking up an old labour battle song.\n\nThe election was historical in a number of ways.\n\nEighty-seven per cent of Danes participated in the polls, which is almost as many as the biggest turnout ever in 1943, during the German occupation.\n\nWe are in charge now\n\nFar-right leader Pia Kjaersgaard\n\nThe election's other great winner was the extreme right wing party, Dansk Folkeparti. It gained nine new seats, taking its total in parliament to 22 of the 179 seats.\n\nEven though the MPs will not be invited to be part of the government, their support will be heavily relied on by Mr Fogh Rasmussen.\n\n\"We are in charge now,\" Dansk Folkeparties leader Pia Kjaersgaard declared, and promised to work hard for stricter policy towards immigration and refugees.\n\nThere is a hypnotic concern with immigration issues in Denmark, which we haven't seen anywhere else, except from Austria\n\nProfessor Ole Borre, Aahhus University\n\nThis underlines what many commentators predicted before the elections - that xenophobia has had a great impact on how the Danes chose to vote.\n\n\"It is obvious to compare the situation with the one in Austria, even though Dansk Folkeparti will not take part in the government as Joerg Haider did,\" says Professor Ole Borre, of Aarhus University.\n\n\"There is a hypnotic concern with immigration issues in Denmark, which we haven't seen anywhere else, except from Austria.\"\n\nAt the same time, the election was the first-ever for a Dane with an immigrant background to enter the Danish parliament.\n\nThirty-eight-year-old Naser Khader, who has a Syrian background, said: \"It is a great victory for me and for the integration policy in Denmark. It sends a signal, that Denmark not solely xenophobic.\""
