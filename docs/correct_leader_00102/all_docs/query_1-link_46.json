        "text": "AFGHANISTAN\n\nFighting in the North, Manhunt in the South\n\nThe battle for the Taliban ‘s last northern stronghold at Kunduz became a test case for the fate of other Taliban and foreign fighters: Were they to be killed, taken prisoner or allowed to go home? After a first cease-fire fell through and thousands of Taliban supporters faced slaughter, the Red Cross called for all parties to observe the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war. Tensions emerged within the Northern Alliance, as diplomats scurried to arrange multiparty talks in Bonn aimed at securing enough political stability to begin the country’s rehabilitation. Pakistan severed its last diplomatic ties with the Taliban , while the U.S. intensified the hunt for Osama bin Laden, placing thousands of troops on standby. The U.S. also deployed new high-tech sensors in surveillance planes and in scouting vehicles on the ground.\n\nDENMARK\n\nShift to the Right\n\nPrime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen conceded defeat to a conservative coalition in a snap election from which he’d hoped to benefit but which was instead dominated by anti-immigrant sentiment. The Liberal Party, led by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, won more seats than the outgoing Social Democrats for the first time since 1920, after Denmark’s 4 million voters rallied behind allied parties seeking to protect the country’s generous welfare system.\n\nKOSOVO\n\nElections, at Last\n\nEthnic Albanians turned out in high numbers to vote for the province’s first democratically elected assembly, though turnout among minority Serbs was relatively low. Ibrahim Rugova, whose Democratic League of Kosovo took more than 46% of the vote, called for Kosovo’s full independence “as soon as possible.” But U.N. officials said the province will remain part of Serbia until a political settlement can be reached. In the meantime, it will continue to be administered by the U.N., in tandem with the new assembly.\n\nMACEDONIA\n\nShock Waves\n\nThe fragile peace process received further setbacks after a bomb exploded in the border town of Tetevo and the main ethnic Macedonian party, the Social Democratic Alliance, withdrew from the governing coalition. The blast went off outside the office of the E.U.’s monitoring mission on the eve of excavations of suspected mass graves. Inspectors later found human remains thought to belong to six of 12 Macedonian civilians who disappeared during a rebellion by ethnic Albanians in July.\n\nGREECE\n\nHoliday Snaps\n\nA hobby practiced by a group of British and Dutch tourists in Greece grew into a diplomatic incident after they were arrested and charged with espionage. Lawyers said 14 aviation enthusiasts, or “plane spotters,” would be charged with offenses that carry a maximum 20-year jail sentence, including taking photographs and recording information from restricted military bases. British Prime Minister Tony Blair intervened on behalf of the detainees amid concern about the conditions in which they were being held. But authorities said the group had been warned three times before their arrest and would still face serious charges.\n\nISRAEL\n\nMore Sorrow\n\nAs U.S. mediators prepared to lead new peace talks, Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian teen at a funeral for five boys killed in an explosion outside a Gaza refugee camp. Palestinian officials blamed that blast on a booby trap placed to protect a nearby Jewish settlement. A missile strike also killed Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, a Hamas leader accused by Israel of helping to plan suicide attacks. Hamas promised revenge, with one leader saying that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had “opened the door to hell.”\n\nTHE PHILIPPINES\n\nVoting With Their Kalishnikovs\n\nMuslim guerillas from the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLA) broke a 1996 peace pact by attacking an army base on the island of Jolo. Government officials accused former MNLF leader Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao in which Jolo is located, of inciting the violence to stop this week’s election for his successor. The government deployed thousands of troops and more than 100 rebels were killed. Police in Malaysia later nabbed Misuari, who has been stripped of his powers\n\nEGYPT\n\nMilitary Trial\n\nNinety-four alleged Islamic extremists denied charges of plotting to overthrow the state at the opening of their trial in a military court near Cairo. Several of the mainly Egyptian defendants protested their innocence from a cage in the courtroom. Most of them were arrested in May on charges of collecting donations for the Palestinian uprising and for Chechnya, but more serious charges were added later.\n\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO\n\nMoney Talks\n\nAn E.U. delegation persuaded President Joseph Kabila to resume negotiations with rebel groups and neighboring countries after promising to help sponsor the process. Talks broke down in October when the government walked out, but lack of funds was also a factor. As the E.U. delegation visited key Congo allies, a U.N. report said the country’s civil war was driven by the desire of African leaders to exploit its natural resources.\n\nZIMBABWE\n\nChanging the Rules\n\nDays after the Supreme Court threw out charges of terrorism and sabotage against opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, the official Herald newspaper announced government plans to introduce the death penalty for the same charges. A new public order and security bill will make it an offense to “undermine the authority” of the President or engender hostility toward him. In Harare, 35 people protesting proposed changes to election procedures were arrested by police on charges of public violence.\n\nSPAIN\n\nIs Britain Rock-Weary?\n\nSignaling a new readiness to explore giving up Britain’s sovereignty of Gibraltar, the U.K. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw met Spain’s Foreign Minister Josep Pique in Barcelona. Straw said the Rock, held by Britain since 1704, would be returned to Spanish control if its 30,000 inhabitants voted in favor in a referendum. Gibraltar’s elected Chief Minister, Peter Caruana, boycotted the talks in protest at the decision to allow him to attend only as a British delegate, preventing him from vetoing any agreements. The ministers said their governments hope to reach an agreement by next summer.\n\nCHINA\n\nFalun Gong Protest\n\nAuthorities detained and then deported 35 Western supporters of the banned Falun Gong movement after they staged one of the biggest demonstrations by foreigners on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. The protesters, on tourist visas from 10 European countries and the U.S., held a sit-in and unfurled banners before being carted away by police. The Foreign Ministry said they were deported for disrupting public order and breaking Chinese law."
