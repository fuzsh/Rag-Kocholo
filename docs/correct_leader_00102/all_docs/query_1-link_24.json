It is frequently used for governmental conferences, summits and other official purposes, including the prime minister's new year speech. Unlike the residences of many other heads of government and state, Marienborg does not serve as the government headquarters or contain the office of the prime minister. The Prime Minister's Office is instead located in Christiansborg on Slotsholmen in downtown Copenhagen. Marienborg was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1964.",

It is frequently used for governmental conferences, summits and other official purposes, including the prime minister's new year speech.[1][2] Unlike the residences of many other heads of government and state (e.g. the White House, 10 Downing Street, La Moncloa and Élysée Palace), Marienborg does not serve as the government headquarters or contain the office of the prime minister. The Prime Minister's Office is instead located in Christiansborg on Slotsholmen in downtown Copenhagen. Marienborg was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1964."
