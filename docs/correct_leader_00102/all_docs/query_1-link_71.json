        "text": "With events taking place all over the country to celebrate wind power, Austria has embraced Global Wind Day. At one of the country’s main events, a crane measuring the same height as an average onshore turbine, lifted people up high to get a bird’s eye view of a wind farm.\n\nAnother spectacle took place in Lower Austria when a professional skydiver leapt from the top of a turbine, opened his parachute and sailed down to the watching crowd below.\n\nMartin Fliegenschnee-Jaksch, from the Austrian Wind Energy Association, said the events that took place last weekend were a “huge success” attracting hundreds of people despite the scorching heat. More events are taking place this weekend in Upper Austria and Burgenland, he said, including a bike tour through a wind park and a wind power-themed cabaret.\n\nThe cars of the future – electric cars – were available for the public to try out at various locations across Austria in further celebration of Global Wind Day, and for children, events ranged from music to face painting.\n\nAt the main event in St Pöllen, there was a prize draw and the lucky winner won a trip in a hot air balloon over the Austrian countryside.\n\nThis week the Austrian Minister of Economics, Reinhold Mitterlehner, will inaugurate a new turbine at an existing wind farm. Fliegenschnee-Jaksch explained that this is significant since it is the first new turbine in Austria to be constructed for a few years.\n\nFor more infomation on wind energy in Austria (in German), click here.\n\nGlobal Wind Day events in Brussels kicked off today with a conference at the foot of the 29.5m turbine blade in the middle of rond point Schuman. Christian Kjaer, CEO of EWEA, highlighted the fact that over the next few days around 220 Global Wind Day events will take place in 26 countries to celebrate and inform the public about the benefits of wind power.\n\nAt the conference EWEA also released its estimate for new wind power installations in 2010. Despite the ongoing economic crisis, the EU is set to have the same amount of new capacity this year as it did last year – around 10 GW.\n\n“This is another strong year for wind power installations,” Kjaer said.\n\nMore striking is the fact that this year’s installations are based on orders that were placed during the financial crisis. New installations in 2009 were based on orders placed before the financial crisis.\n\nIngmar Wilhelm, Executive Vice President of ENEL – the sponsor of the blade exhibition – said that the crisis has helped “drive the industry to become more organised and efficient.” Wind power “really impacts the energy scenarios of today,” since it is now a mature energy source, he added.\n\nWind power has a “strong development path ahead of it. It will only improve its cost effectiveness and competitiveness,” Wilhelm said.\n\nMore good news for wind power: two countries have installed their first wind farms this year – Slovenia and Cyprus – making Malta the only EU country without wind power.\n\nAs for whether or not wind power will again top the table of new installed energy capacity (last year 39% of all new capacity was wind power, ahead of gas, coal and nuclear), Kjaer said it was “too early to tell.”\n\nWhen tourists are planning a holiday in Hawaii they inevitably think of beautiful Pacific beaches kissed by year-round sunshine and surrounded by stunning arrays of magnificent tropical flowers. Local residents know a darker side of the state, however, one that involves being dependent on expensive, polluting, imported oil to supply about 90% of Hawaii’s energy.\n\nAs a result of being the most oil-dependent state in the US — reportedly four times more dependent than any of the other 49 states — Hawaii has embraced an exciting energy revolution that includes emissions-free wind power to help transform the way it meets its existing, and future, energy needs.\n\nThe state has set a goal of 70% clean energy through energy efficiency and renewable energies by 2030. Hawaii’s Clean Energy Initiative is already working to harness the state’s strong trade winds along with other renewable energies.\n\n“Wind is plentiful on Hawaii’s islands,” notes the initiative web site. “In the past, ancient Hawaiians depended on the trade winds to sail their canoes. And for the people of Hawaii today, the wind holds tremendous potential as a clean, renewable energy source.”\n\nThe web site also says Hawaiian wind farms are already supplying green electricity to consumers on Maui and the Big Island, and plans are under way to install wind turbines on Lanai, Molokai, and Oahu.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has already published a map showing that Hawaii has wind resources consistent with utility-scale production. “Good-to-excellent wind resource areas are fairly evenly distributed throughout the islands,” the web site says the DOE map indicates.\n\nAs a way of achieving its green energy goals, the web site says Hawaii is now discussing building an undersea cable system to transmit electricity between Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, and possibly Maui in order to increase access to wind power and other renewable energy projects statewide, which could lead to consumer and business cost savings.\n\nPoul Nyrup Rasmussen, President of the Party of European Socialists (PES) last night called for green bonds to be set up to help kick-start the European economy following its deepest recession since the 1930s. Speaking at a debate on green jobs held in Brussels and organised by the European Wind Energy Association, Rasmussen said that “Europe cannot solve its crisis through austerity plans alone,” adding that European institutions must create the right economic environment to boost renewable energy.\n\nThe European wind industry has investment needs of around €150bn and green bonds, issued by the European Investment Bank or an independent facility, would help prevent European recovery from losing its momentum and stop countries including China and the US from knocking Europe off its current position as leader in renewable energies, he said.\n\nWith its recovery strategies Europe is now “on the wrong track,” he said. “We risk sluggish economic growth of around 0.2-0.5%, a dramatic rise in unemployment and a drop in investment incentives for industry,” he added.\n\nChristian Kjaer, CEO of EWEA, echoed Rasmussen’s call in saying that Europe “messed up” its economic stimulus package. The US, China and South Korea all had better stimulus plans than Europe since they included stronger measures for green growth, he said.\n\nThe European economic recovery plan included funds for gas, nuclear and CCS and only small funds for renewables, Maria Da Graça Carvalho, MEP for the European People’s Party, lamented. She went on to say that the EIB should be prevented from investing in high carbon projects.\n\nKjaer threw another element into the debate by suggesting that re-working the way Europe subsidies the energy sector could be a simple aid to recovery during this period of austerity. 80% of European energy subsidies are currently spent on nuclear and fossil fuels, 20% goes to energy efficiency and renewables. “If you want to save a lot of money from your government’s budget, remove that 80%. That would also make it cheaper to introduce new technologies,” Kjaer said.\n\nAnne Paneels, Senior Advisor for the European Trade Union Conferation, said that another key aspect to growth in green energies is creating more training for technicians and engineers to boost Europe’s skill base in the manufacturing sector. Women, in particular, should be encouraged, Da Graça Carvalho added.\n\nThe debate rounded off with a call by Rasmussen to make green energy a “people’s demand” via NGOs and organisations which could then apply pressure on decision-makers, stimulating the political will needed for change.\n\nDid you attend last night’s debate or have a point of view on green jobs and economic recovery? Join the discussion by commenting below.\n\nAlthough large-scale wind energy farms are the usual method of tapping into the increasingly popular emissions-free power technology, a growing number of institutions and people are exploring other ways of harnessing wind to create green electricity.\n\nOne of the latest examples of this exciting shift occurred last week in Nevada when civic officials gathered on the top of Reno’s 17-storey-high City Hall to admire two 1.5-kilowatt wind turbines that are part of a plan to install small-scale turbines around the city to create energy and save money.\n\n“It’s a great thing to do to lower energy bills as much as you can,” Jason Geddes, the city’s environmental services administrator, was quoted as saying in a Government Technology report, “and hedge against future increases in fossil fuel energy.”\n\nThe report also says that Reno, one of the first US cities to place a wind turbine on top of a City Hall, has already installed a turbine at the sewage plant and one at a park. In total, the report says, nine urban turbines will be installed so officials can test how they perform in various environments.\n\nThe Government Technology story also quoted Geddes as saying that the city is investing $1 million for wind programs with a total of about $19 million for new energy technology. Locals officials have said the wind, solar and energy-efficiency projects are expected to reduce energy use by 25% save $1 million a year.\n\nMeanwhile, BBC News reported last week that JoeBen Bevirt is putting the final touches to a series of large kites, which he says will be able to harvest the fast crosswinds found at high altitude.\n\nThe BBC story claims that Bevrit’s airborne wind turbines will fly to about 600 metres, where they will float, generating power that can be transferred to the ground via a tether.\n\n“Global wind is a tremendous source of energy — carrying nearly 870 terrawatts in global tropospheric winds,” Bevirt, who works for a Californian company, is quoted as saying. “In comparison, the global demand is 17 terawatts. Harnessing a tiny fraction will transform the way we power our civilization.”"
