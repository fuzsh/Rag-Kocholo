        "text": "Danish youth revolt and the radicalization of the European creative classLe Danemark est le seul pays Ouest-Européen à battre les Pays-Bas sur le\n\nplan d’un sous-courant socio-politique profondement nationaliste,\n\nréactionnaire et xénophobe, ce qui n’est pas peu dire. Mais tout comme les\n\nPays-Bas, l’étranger a plutot une perception sympathique de ce petit pays\n\nchampêtre et soi-disant bon enfant. Les émeutes de Copenhague à\n\nl’occasion de l’éviction et de la destruction du centre culturel de jeunes\n\n‘Ungdomhuset’, batiment historique où Clara Zetkin proclama les Droits de\n\nla Femme au debut du siècle dernier, sont pour nous rappeller a la réalité\n\nalors que s’estompe le souvenir de Prague, de Goteborg et de Genes. La réalité\n\nd’un naufrage politique de l’Europe est de plus en plus manifeste, conséquence\n\nde l’aveuglement et de la surdite de ses élites technocratiques ; mais\n\négalement celle du surgissement d’une nouvelle conscience rebelle au bel\n\navenir. Et cela là ou on s’y attendait peut être le moins. A tort, et les\n\nhéritiers des Vikings continueront de nous surprendre.\n\nPatrice RiemensIt was a very hot weekend in Copenhagen between March 1st and March\n\n3rd, particulary in Nørrebro, the alternative neighborhood where the\n\nevicted and demolished Ungdomshuset was located, and around\n\nChristiania, the hippy free city known Europe-wide being harassed by\n\nthe Rasmussen government. But the the eviction and the three days and\n\nnights of heavy rioting that followed were initiated by the local\n\nsocialdemocrats, who have been in charge of the city since 1900. The\n\nharsh treatment of protesters, Andersen’s mermaid who went pink, and\n\nthe 600 arrests of activists, have prompted a wave of transnational\n\nsolidarity among the European youth with appeals, actions, boycotts,\n\nand occupations of Danish consulates, not only in nearby Malmö,\n\nGöteborg, Hamburg, Oslo, Helsinki, but also in Berlin, Munich, Leipzig\n\nand every single German city, as well as in Warsaw, Poznan, Budapest,\n\nAmsterdam, Venice, Milan, Athens, Salonica, Istanbul.\n\nWhy in Denmark? Why there such a forceful rebellion of the city’s\n\ndissenting youth, promptly joined by the immigrant youth? How could a\n\nfull-scale riot occur in peaceful and wealthy European capital, with\n\nburning barricades and sustained the clashes with the police, who had\n\nto bring in help from Sweden to put the situation back under control?\n\nWasn’t consumerist European youth supposed to be only eager to\n\ndiscover the world, flying and chatting low-cost? Wasn’t the younger\n\ngeneration deemed to be irreversibly post-ideological, much less\n\nattracted to radical politics?\n\nIn political terms, Denmark is a special country in more ways than\n\none. It’s been part of the EU since 1973, but its people have opposed\n\nMaastricht with all their will, with major riots (the only comparable\n\nto last weekend’s in recent history) breaking out after the 1993\n\nreferendum, which in retrospect were at least as important as the 1995\n\nFrench strikes in catalyzing the antiglobalization movement in Europe.\n\nAnd many Danes were in Göteborg, a crucial episode in the maturation\n\nof noglobal protest in Europe, just before Genoa. As the now\n\nrespectable Italian right-wing leader and former fascist Gianfranco\n\nFini said to Time magazine: “Genoa will be like Göteborg, or worse.”\n\n(Since he went on to commandeer the riot cops in Genoa, he made sure\n\nhis dire prediction would come true.) As a consequence of the fierce\n\npopular opposition to Maastricht, Denmark is not part of the euro, but\n\nit’s very much part of the eurocratic mainstream. The reason:\n\nflexicurity, currently the solution favored by the European Commission\n\nto temper the disasters (and limit the political costs) brought by\n\nunilateral flexibility, while forcing workfare down the throats of the\n\nunwilling youth of Europe. Although a Nordic country with an extensive\n\nwelfare system and strong unions, social democracy hasn’t had an easy\n\nlife in 21st century Denmark. A staunchly occidentalist,\n\nneoconservative right has been in power since 2001. Denmark has turned\n\ninto a faithful bushist ally, more long-lasting than Berlusconi’s\n\nItaly. This exceptional partiality to NATO and America make the Danish\n\nversion of flexicurity – the latest edition of Nordic social model\n\nafter the demise of the top-down and paternalist, but generous and\n\nuniversalist, socialdemocratic welfare state – particularly liked by\n\nthe Barroso commission.\n\nOf course, the land which hosted the first Jacobin revolution outside\n\nFrance and invented quantum physics remains a land with a penchant for\n\nfree thinkers and rabble rousers: the Danes have a fierce sense of\n\nhumor, which compares favorably with their Scandinavian neighbors\n\n(remember The Kingdom by Lars von Trier?). And Copenhagen, a city\n\nfully immersed in the informational networks and supply channels\n\n(think container and shipping giant Maersk) feeding the global\n\neconomy, is full of them. With respect to the British or Italian\n\ncreative class, Danish brainworkers are more radical and libertarian.\n\nAnarchism has flourished since the early 80s from anarchopunk to black\n\nbloc and beyond. Radicalism with red and green tinges is also in full\n\nbloom. In fact, generalized reliance on peer-to-peer sharing and free\n\ndownloading has been furthered by collectives such as piratgruppe. And\n\nantiprecarity ideas and actions are currently fermented by groups like\n\nflexico. And who could ever forget such great subvertising stunts like\n\nanti-pepsi Guaraná Power (also a commercial success in the Jutland\n\npeninsula)?\n\nAnd this is just a fractal part of what Copenhagen’s creative class is\n\nable to achieve, when it thinks in terms of political action and\n\ncultural engagement. But Denmark is also a strongly agrarian economy\n\nwhich has prospered under the Common Agricultural Policy, thanks to\n\nits superior dairy and pork products that have conquered European, and\n\nworld, markets. Farmers are as religious and narrow-minded, lily-white\n\nprotestant and patriotic, just as urban dwellers tend to be secular\n\nand open-minded. The former have been pivotal in the rise to power of\n\nthe Right, the latter are increasingly dissatisfied by the traditional\n\nLeft.\n\nThe Danish antiglobalization movement has been the only one in Europe\n\nto develop its own independent political force. Sections of it joined\n\nthe Red-Green alliance, bringing a woman under 30 to Parliament, and\n\nconstituted a Pink list in Copenhagen’s municipal elections, which\n\nscored almost 10 per cent of votes at the city level, and in\n\nalternative neighborhoods like Nørrebro is firmly in the double\n\ndigits. No wonder Andersen’s mermaid was covered in pink as a sign of\n\nsolidarity with the protesters (the 69 signature instead refers to the\n\nstreet number of Undgomshuset, which uses it as some kind of punk ying\n\nand yang in its posters). The osmosis of activists into local politics\n\nand cooperative ventures has created a multi-level context, in which\n\nradical forces of all denominations can work in synergy if the\n\nsituation requires, from the streets to the city to the parliament,\n\nwith a tacit division of labor that respects political autonomy at all\n\nlevels. The proliferation of networked autonomous struggles and\n\nalternative media networks combined with municipal representation has\n\nenabled a common political understanding of the connectedness of\n\nvarious forms of dissent and protest, and has encouraged\n\nexperimentation with the possibilities of social radicalism in a\n\nEuropean metropolis. This was not simply a rebellious episode: it will\n\nhave far-reaching political consequences.\n\nIn the Nørrebro, the neighborhood’s culture of non-conformity has\n\nmanaged to bridge the divide between alternative youth and ghetto\n\nyouth, or more sociologically speaking, between the mainly white\n\ncreative class and the mainly immigrant service class. The\n\nneighborhood has long been an inclusive space for young bohemians\n\nand/or immigrants: it hosts many venues of social interaction, and has\n\na history of connections and exchanges between Arab kids and the\n\nmainly white activists. As the youth of Arab descent was heard saying\n\nduring the riots: “You helped us, we help you.” Militant antiracism\n\nwas pivotal in breaking the wall of mistrust and building some mutual\n\nrespect in Copenhagen, although deep differences still remain between\n\nthe two groups. Unlike Paris, where the students storming the\n\nuniversities and the boulevards to protest against juvenile precarity\n\nand the French government did not really fundamentally connect with\n\nthe rioters (there were actually tensions during the demonstrations\n\nbetween students and radicals and banlieusards intent on looting and\n\nfighting the police), in Copenhagen recent social turmoil has mostly\n\nseen white and non-white youth on the same side of the barricade.\n\nLarge-scale riots occur spontaneously in response to blatant\n\nviolations of individual liberties and collective rights and arrogant\n\nabuses of state and police power. Think of Rodney King trial and the\n\n1992 L.A. riots, or remember the electrocution of teenagers running\n\naway from the cops which triggered the uprising of Paris banlieues in\n\n2005, and you can understand why the raid of the Danish special forces\n\nto evict Ungomdshuset in the early morning of the first of march, was\n\njust like a match thrown on the parched prairie. Riots are spontaneous\n\nprocesses emerging after all hopes in non-violent tools of protest and\n\nconfrontation are exhausted, due to the deafness of power.\n\nAnd Danish state power is as deaf as it is dumb. As soon as the Right\n\ntook office, it launched a cultural crusade to protect the Occident\n\nfrom Muslim immigration, perceived as a threat to the Danish cultural\n\nidentity. The extent of its hostility to migrants in Denmark (a very\n\nnativist state with very strict immigration laws, in an already\n\nxenophobic European Union) became clear to the whole world with the\n\nmishandling of the crisis of satirical cartoons. The cartoons,\n\npurportedly making fun on the Prophet, were in reality the political\n\neditorial of a conservative newspaper, traditionally expression of the\n\nright-wing agrarian interests above noted. Only a panislamic boycott\n\nof Danish products pushed the country’s multinationals to plead for a\n\nmore sensible approach with the Danish Prime Minister, Anders Fogh\n\nRasmussen.\n\nIn fact, the prime minister – whom Berlusconi advised as lover to his\n\nwife for his good looks (seriously!) – shares his last name with a\n\nprime mover of European politics, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, head of the\n\nEuropean socialdemocrats in Strasbourg and influential in the\n\nSocialist International. The socialdemocratic blunder made in\n\nCopenhagen with the shady sale to a homophobic and islamophobic\n\nChristian sect of the social youth center Ungdomshuset, worsened by\n\nthe forced eviction (there had already been skirmishes in September,\n\nso it was clear Copenhagen’s youth was going to explode at the next\n\nprovocation) makes one thing clear: the two Rasmussens are one of a\n\nsame kind! European politicians, either socialdemocratic, liberal or\n\nconservative, increasingly look indistinguishable. They all share\n\ndeference to financial markets, big corporations, have repressive and\n\nxenophobic instincts, and pander to firmly established interest groups\n\nand older generations. Even the mainstream Danish unions are realizing\n\nsocialdemocrats are no longer reliable to defend the interests of\n\nemployees, and when push comes to shove, they side with student\n\nprotesters, as it happened during the general strikes and university\n\noccupations that rocked the country in the spring of 2006, when\n\nRasmussen announced welfare “reforms” cutting benefits for youngsters\n\nand aged workers alike, which the socialdemocrats opposed only\n\nrhetorically. But it would be foolish to ascribe to a supposed Danish\n\nexceptionalism the extension and duration of the riots. Rather, by\n\nvirtue of their socialist past and libertarian present, Danish\n\nmovements are in a privileged position to fight against the\n\nsociopolitical consequences of both Atlanticist neoconservatism and\n\nEuropean free-market liberalism. Copenhagen’s pink rebellion could be\n\nthe harbinger of a more generalized youth insurgence in Europe,\n\ninvolving large sections of the so-called creative class of\n\nnet/flex/temp workers.\n\nIn fact, it makes sense to see in the Copenhagen riots as a\n\ncontinuation of the French protests of 2006, and both as instances of\n\na new phase for radical movements after the decline which followed the\n\nfailed attempt at blocking the Angloamerican invasion of Iraq. In\n\nparticular, it is tempting to see it as an anticipation of the\n\ngeneralized rebellion of the European creative class against the\n\nhyprocrisy, arrogance and corruption elites ruling the EU, which have\n\nbeen delegitimized by the French-Dutch no, but are clinging to power\n\nas if Europe were an asset that belonged to them. The Brussels summit\n\nis supposed to spruce up the environmental credentials of the EU, in\n\norder to make it appealing at least to somebody beyond the privileged\n\nfew. Later in March 2007, the Berlin summit (which will issue the\n\nBerlin declaration on the constitutional future of the EU) will\n\ncelebrate half-a-century of European treaties, but it will be the\n\ndeath of European federalism and the transition to some kind of\n\nconfederation of nation-states, combining the bellicosity and racism\n\nof the former with transfer of sovereignty of the latter. We’ll also\n\nsee how thing turn out in Heilingdamm-Rostock in June, and how\n\nmovements from East and West of Europe will be able to fight the G8\n\nand the huge transnational police force that will protect its\n\nclosed-doors decisions. The insurgence of European youth in\n\nCopenhagen, Paris and elsewhere seems to point toward increasing\n\npolitical awareness and radicalization among young people working in\n\ninformation, knowledge, culture industries. Only the creative class\n\ncan alter the course of European history away from its present\n\nreactionary path toward social emancipation of a finally mulatto\n\neurogeneration. We have to act now for radical Europe, by connecting\n\nand solidarizing with major struggles like the Copenhagen and Athens\n\nrevolts: let’s create a European space for radical youth culture!"
