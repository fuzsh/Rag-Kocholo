        "text": "IF YOU thought EU politics was confusing, try this for size: last week’s elections in Denmark were fought between two candidates called Rasmussen. In the red corner stood the EU’s longest-serving leader Poul Nyrup Rasmussen; in the blue was his Liberal challenger Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who gave his rival a real pasting.\n\nThe new heavyweight champion of Denmark is the leader of Venstre, which means ‘left’ in Danish but has been the country’s Liberal party for over a century. To add to the confusion, the Liberals are to the right of their Conservative coalition partners on most issues and would sit comfortably alongside any European Christian Democrat party.\n\nThen you have Fogh Rasmussen himself. For most of his 23 years in politics, the newly-appointed prime minister has been a right-wing ideologue in Danish terms. He even wrote a book, From Social State to Minimal State, in which he described the welfare state as “developing a slave mentality in the people”.\n\nHowever, as with Belgian premier Guy Verhofstadt – who was once nicknamed ‘baby Thatcher’ by his enemies – the economics graduate realised that to win the keys of office you have to seduce the political centre. So when Fogh Rasmussen took over the party reins from former foreign minister Uffe Elleman Jensen in 1998, he started to ditch the hard-nosed, neo-liberal rhetoric for more cuddly issues like the environment and social affairs.\n\nCartoonists have had a field day depicting Fogh Rasmussen as a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Danish Socialist MEP Helle Thorning-Schmidt thinks the analogy is entirely appropriate.\n\n“A fairly right-wing party has disguised themselves as Social Democrats and won the middle ground,” she says with disgust.\n\nFogh Rasmussen’s pick-and-mix approach to politics might not have pleased political purists, but it certainly wooed the Danish electorate. In the\n\n20 November election, which was rashly called by the former PM to capitalise on his post-11 September popularity, the Liberal Party and its centre-right supporters won 98 out of 179 seats in the Danish parliament.\n\nThis was not just a victory, it was a political landslide. For the first time since 1920 the Social Democrats failed to emerge as the largest party, while the Liberals notched up their biggest share of the vote in over 80 years.\n\nListening to the reaction of Europe’s political élite, one would have thought a palace coup had taken place\n\nin Copenhagen.\n\nNo one quoted Marcellus’ famous line in Hamlet – “Something is rotten in the state of Denmark” – but William Shakespeare’s words were at the back of everyone’s minds. “It’s clear I’m worried,” said Sweden’s Prime Minister Göran Persson. “We now see a government that will be forced to prop itself up with anti-foreigner ideas.”\n\nFogh Rasmussen calmed some fears on Tuesday by refusing to offer the Danish People’s Party any cabinet posts in his minority government. However, on contentious issues such as trimming welfare, curbing immigration and putting a ceiling on taxes, Fogh Rasmussen may be forced to rely on them to secure a majority.\n\nOn the campaign trail, the Liberal leader pandered to the type of xenophobic hysteria whipped up by Pia Kjærsgaard’s DPP party, which doubled its seats in the poll. He has bluntly stated that “we have to make stricter laws so that fewer foreigners come to Denmark” and vowed to push through legislation requiring immigrants to live in the country for seven years before they are granted full access to welfare.\n\nA sign of the seriousness with which he takes the issue is the appointment of Liberal MEP Bertel Haarder to the newly-created post of minister for immigration and European affairs.\n\nHowever, it would be wrong to view Fogh Rasmussen as a rabble-rousing populist in the Jörg Haider mould. He also likes to pose as a guardian of the welfare state and when it comes to the highly divisive issue of Europe there is little to distinguish the Liberals from their centre-left rivals. Both are in favour of the euro, speedy enlargement of the EU, strict environmental laws and greater openness in the Union’s institutions.\n\nThat said, Fogh Rasmussen is probably the more free-thinking man when it comes to EU reform. He wants to get rid of the Common Agricultural Policy as it currently exists, reduce structural and cohesion fund hand-outs, limit EU busy-bodying in areas such as cultural and tourism policy, put in place a Commissioner for subsidiarity and create a council of national parliaments made up of MPs. But it is on the issue of European Parliament reform where Fogh Rasmussen really comes into his own. He describes the current farce of shuttling between Brussels and Strasbourg as an “embarrassment” and favours moving the whole parliamentary road-show to the Belgian capital.\n\nHis party also wants to give MEPs the right to sack individual Commissioners and co-decide in all areas where EU governments vote by qualified majority.\n\nOf course, it’s easier to be radical in opposition than in government, but Fogh Rasmussen’s refreshing ideas are certain to add some spice to the rather bland ‘Future of Europe’ dish that is currently being cooked up by\n\nEU leaders.\n\nWhen it comes to European issues, the new PM will certainly be no pushover. He signed the Maastricht Treaty for Denmark and has sat through his fair share of late-night meetings as minister for taxation and finance.\n\nHowever, his country’s presidency of the EU, which starts in July 2002, looks set to be the ultimate test for the dark-haired Dane. It will be during his stint at the Union’s helm that the final hurdles towards enlargement will have to be overcome. With elections looming in France and Spain holding the presidency during the first half of next year, it is unlikely there will be much progress on the two key issues of agriculture and structural funds until the summer. And in December 2002, the EU is slated to draw up its ten-year plan for fisheries policy. As Denmark has one of the largest fishing industries in the Union, expect the sort of cod-war usually found in the pages of Asterix.\n\nWhen Fogh Rasmussen presented his slimmed-down cabinet to Queen Margrethe on Tuesday, it was a just reward for a lifetime of political activism. One of the few colourful anecdotes about the youthful-looking 48-year-old is that when he was a child he used to play a board game called Politics in which he always bagged the role of prime minister.\n\nThe political bug failed to go away. The farmer’s son from Jutland helped found the Young Liberals at Viborg Cathedral School and midway through his economics degree at Århus University he became leader of his party’s youth wing.\n\nAt the tender age of 25, Fogh Rasmussen became Denmark’s youngest MP and less than a decade later he was minister for taxes. He stayed in the job for five years before resigning for dodgy book-keeping. To this day it is the only blemish on his whiter-than-white record.\n\nFogh Rasmussen is happily married with three children, drinks moderately – the only exception was a bender in Brussels, which he blamed on his mates – and looks as dependable as a regional bank manager.\n\nMEP Thorning-Schmidt says “the only interesting thing about the guy is that he is uninteresting”. European Liberals’ general-secretary Bo Jensen, who has known the new PM for more than 25 years, disagrees. While admitting that Fogh Rasmussen is a “political animal”, he adds that it would be “unfair to describe him as a political machine”.\n\nHe has a house in the foothills of the Pyrenées, where he likes to eat and drink well with close friends and goes jogging for an hour every day.\n\nHe is seen as one of Denmark’s more charismatic political figures, but a man of the people he is not. Serious and cerebral, he is known for his sharp mind rather than his moving oratory and his control-freakery rather than his back-slapping bonhomie.\n\nThis might not make him as immediately likeable as his predecessor as party chief, the quick-witted Elleman Jensen, but few politicians are in the trade to be liked. The more honourable of their ilk will say they are there to make a difference. Few doubt that Fogh Rasmussen will and that is probably the greatest compliment you can pay him."
