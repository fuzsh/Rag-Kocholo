POUL NYRUP RASMUSSEN, Denmark's prime minister since 1993, reckons he has done a good job. The economy has flourished under his government: GDP has grown by an average of 3% a year, and unemployment has fallen from 12.4% in 1993 to about 7.4% this winter. The general government budget has gone into surplus for the first time in ten years. In purely material terms, it is safe to say, the Danes have never had it so good.

Yet it does not follow that Danes are satisfied with their lot. Mr Nyrup Rasmussen may have miscalculated when he called an election for March 11th. The feel-good factor he apparently thought would carry him back into office declines to blow much wind into his sails. His minority government—a coalition of his own Social Democrats and the small Radical Party—seemed this week to be heading for the rocks. If he loses, the next government will be a coalition dominated by the Conservatives and the free-market Liberals, probably under the Liberal leader and former foreign minister, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen.
