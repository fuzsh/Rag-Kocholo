For a TV movie from the 90's, this one isn't too bad. You can tell as you watch it that the cast and crew were professionals. The cinematography really impressed me, and the acting was just superb. The other reviewers here seem to find Sam Elliott to be their favorite actor in this movie, and I understand that perfectly. However, I personally think Jerry O'Connell's performance was the best thing in the film. If you're looking for an entertaining family Western, this is a good option.

However, the film lacks on one major thing: the plot. Its first act is very good at drawing you into the characters and situations. Nonetheless, the movie seems to lose speed halfway through, changing from a film about respect and adolescence to a film about...uh...young love and gambling. If you don't know much about playing poker, there are about ten minutes of the film you probably won't get at all. The film returns to its first theme near the end, but you still might get the impression that the filmmakers just wanted their movie to be more than 90 minutes long. Also, don't let the "Hole in the Sky" within the title excite you much; it's just some gambling term.

In conclusion, "The Ranger, the Cook and a Hole in the Sky" is a professional TV movie that will entertain its viewers at least most of the time. Whether you're a Sam Elliott fan, a Western fan, or just a parent who wants a clean film for their kids to watch, this movie is for you!
