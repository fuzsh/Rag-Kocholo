        "text": "Stargazing at Acadia\n\nThe night sky is one aspect of our environment that everyone across the world can experience. It is a resource that humans throughout time have looked to as both a mode of navigation and a realm for the spiritual. Though the night sky at Acadia looks a little different than the night sky in the Southern Hemisphere, everyone has the access to gaze up into what lies beyond our planet. Stargazing is a great way to experience nature, explore science, and ponder history.\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\nAstronomy can be daunting for beginners, but stargazing does not have to be hard. The two keys to enjoying a gaze up into the cosmos are going out in the proper conditions and arriving prepared.\n\nBest Stargazing Conditions\n\nNew moon, before moonrise, or after moonset – Though a very fantastic and powerful celestial body, the moon and its brightness can impede your ability to see the stars in their multitude. Check the phases of the moon and the moonrise and moonset times.\n\nClear skies and good weather – Stargazing is best on a cloudless or minimally clouded night. Check the forecast for inclement weather and cloud coverage before you venture out.\n\nAn hour or two after sunset – Even after the sun sets, there remains some residual light. Stargazing will be best an hour or two after sunset, when this residual light has dissipated.\n\nAstrophotography\n\nAstrophotograhy is a type of photography involving the night skies. Although these images are different than what our human eyes can see, photographers use long exposure shots to capture the beauty of stars, constellations, and the Milky Way in a dramatic and inspiring way.\n\nCheck out the images from various stargazing locations at Acadia and be inspired to create your own."
