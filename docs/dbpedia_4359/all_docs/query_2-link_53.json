        "text": "Dos Picos County Park is located in Ramona. Its name is Spanish for \"two peaks,\" derived from the two prominent mountains nearby. The surrounding ranchland and steep rocky slopes help preserve its secluded atmosphere.\n\nYou can come for the day, but you’ll want to stay for the weekend. Well-suited for campers, this peaceful locale has a range of camping sites including partial hook-up sites, tent sites, ADA-accessible cabins, a youth group area and coin-operated showers. The park features picnic tables, horseshoe pits, soccer fields, an enclosed pavilion and restrooms. Fishing at the nearby lake is also popular activity. Dos Picos makes a great venue for weddings and special events.\n\nDos Picos is home to many plants and animals. Supporting the abundant wildlife is a mixture of chaparral, open grassland and oak woodland. Coast live oak abounds, though Engelmann oaks are also a regular occurrence.\n\nCoyote, fox, possum, skunk, and raccoon are all seen in the park. Look up to the sky to view birds like great blue herons, egrets, ducks, red-shouldered hawks, woodpeckers and western bluebirds. California quail are afoot in the early mornings, while the evening skies are filled with the sounds of resident barn, screech and great horned owls.\n\nFind out more about our award-winning Discovery Kit Program. It’s an exciting outdoor environmental education adventure for elementary school-age children."
