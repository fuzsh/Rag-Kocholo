        "text": "ROCKY JONES, SPACE RANGER\n\nIntroduction:\n\nAs a child of the 60's I grew up a big Star Trek fan. Not really committed enough to be a Trekkie (or Trekker, I never remember which is politically correct) I still managed to become a big fan of all science fiction based television shows. Classic shows like Lost In Space and The Outer Limits were regularly airing at that time, but I never had the opportunity to see any of the shows that first tested the sci-fi waters of 1950's TV. At least not until the mid-90's when a comedy show called Mystery Science Theater 3000 resurrected two movies from the Rocky Jones, Space Ranger series to use as targets for their rapid-fire jokes. As much as I enjoyed the jabs at Rocky and his crew I was also intrigued by the original movies themselves. I began collecting whatever Rocky Jones memorabilia I ran across and started researching the history of the show. I was surprised to find so much misinformation on the internet. I found some fine articles, but there were so many conflicting stories that it was impossible to tell what was correct. What follows is my attempt to clear up some of that confusion.\n\nMy home town is in the metro-Detroit area, which was one of the first regions to pick up Rocky Jones, Space Ranger for syndication, so that is where my research began and where the broadcast information listed below is based. Enjoy.\n\nSection 1: Show History\n\nWhen Rocky Jones, Space Ranger debuted in early 1954 it promised to be the best of the budding new science fiction genre of kid-oriented space operas on television. Most viewers had no idea that the program had already been in development for nearly three years before the first episode finally aired.\n\nRocky Jones was the first science fiction show on television to be recorded on film stock rather than broadcast live. At the time that resulted in nicer sets, location shots, better special effects and grander story lines. Years later it would mean that new generations of sci-fi fans would still be able to watch the series in its entirety while other shows of the era, such as Space Patrol, Captain Video and Tom Corbett had long since disappeared or survived only on a few old kinescopes.\n\nRocky Jones was the creation of Roland Reed, a Hollywood producer who is best known for his successful My Little Margie series. Roland Reed Productions was founded in 1950 and in 1951 Warren Wilson penned the screenplay for the Rocky Jones pilot. By the end of 1951 a cast had been selected, headed by square-jawed leading man Richard Crane as Rocky Jones and one time Our Gang member Scotty Beckett as RockyÂ’s co-pilot and comic relief, Winky. Merchandising for the show started before the pilot was even shot. A coloring book was produced in 1951 that sold nearly a half million copies in its first printing.\n\nThe pilot was shot between January and April 1952 with the titles and effects shots being prepared in March of that year. Post-production was completed in May and on June 3, 1952 the pilot for Rocky Jones, Space Ranger was registered at the Library of Congress by the newly formed Space Ranger Enterprises. Throughout 1952 articles about the upcoming show and merchandising opportunities began to pop up everywhere. Variety, Billboard, Hollywood Reporter and even Boys Outfitter featured items relating to the show.\n\nThe pilot was screened on September 29, 1952. Although the premise showed potential there would be some changes made to the cast before production began. In particular the character of Vena Ray was given to pretty starlet Sally Mansfield. The character of Secretary Drake was also recast after the pilot. Drake would now be portrayed by Charles Meredith, who appeared in most episodes in the series. The cast was rounded out by 10-year old Robert Lyden as honorary space ranger Bobby and Maurice Cass as Professor Newton. The final recurring character was the sinister yet seductive Cleolanthe, Suzerainne (Queen) of the planet Ophiuchus, played with gusto by Patsy Parsons.\n\nWith the cast finally in place and screenplays prepared for the first 26 episodes filming began in October 1953 and continued over the next few months. An all out merchandising blitz began during this time. For example, a new coloring book was published in late 1953, but this time the rest of the cast, other than Rocky Jones, was mentioned by name. Wrist watches, wallets complete with space dollars, badges, buttons, records and clothing were produced to promote the show. The largest sponsor was the Gordon Baking Company, makers of Silvercup Bread. Silvercup had been associated with the popular Lone Ranger series for many years.\n\nThe series was developed for syndication by television stations across the country. The show was particularly popular in the Midwest and aired in Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Chicago among other markets. Individual stations were allowed to air the show on what ever day and time they chose. They also did not necessarily show the episodes in the intended order. (NOTE: as you will read later this resulted in a lot of confusion about the correct production order.) Most of the episodes were broken down into three chapters that were shown on consecutive weeks. Some episodes Â“made senseÂ” to be seen in a certain order due to introductions of new characters or locations that would then return in a later adventure.\n\nRocky Jones, Space Ranger was reviewed in Variety on January 20, 1954 with some positive comments. The series finally premiered at 6:30 PM on Tuesday, February 23, 1954 (NOTE: dates and times are based on the Detroit, MI viewing area). The first episode was chapter one of Beyond the Curtain of Space. Rocky and Winky are introduced to Vena and they all blast off in the Orbit Jet XV2 to save Bobby and Professor Newton on the planet Ophiuchus. (NOTE: The United Worlds of the Solar Systems headquarters was easily recognizable as the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles).\n\nUnfortunately, off screen issues began almost immediately. In February 1954 Scotty Beckett ran into some trouble with the law and was arrested for possessing a weapon after being implicated in an armed robbery at the Cavalier Hotel in Hollywood, CA. After posting bail he fled to Mexico where he encountered more problems for writing bad checks and more weapons charges. After a gun battle with local police he was incarcerated for four months and did not return to the United States until September 1954. By then Rocky Jones had already moved on. The last of the original 26 episodes had to be completed, so the character of Winky was written out of the final three chapters. These episodes were filmed in April 1954 and still featured elderly Maurice Cass as Professor Newton. Sadly, Cass died of a heart attack on June 8, 1954.\n\nThe series was extended for 13 more episodes, to bring the total to 39. Becket was replaced by James Lydon as Biffen Â“BiffÂ” Cardoza and Cass was succeeded by Reginald Sheffield as Professor Marberry. The character of Cleolanthe also did not appear in any of these later episodes. A similar, but kinder Ann Robinson played Juliandra, Suzerainne of Herculon, which was also the home planet of Biff. Even their rocket ship was replaced by the Silver Moon XV3. These final shows were filmed from August through October 1954.\n\nWhen the last of the 39 episodes was filmed the show had run its course. Each show had ended with the narrator urging viewers to:\n\nBe with us next week, same time, same station, when we again take you into outer space for further adventures with Rocky Jones\n\nAt the end of The Trial of Rocky Jones, Chapter 3 on November 16, 1954 there was no voice over the closing credits. This was the last original episode to air. Reruns were broadcast for another six months in Detroit and even longer in some markets across the country.\n\nMerchandizing for the show continued throughout 1955. Starting in March 1955 Charlton Comics published four Rocky Jones based editions of their popular Space Adventures comic series. An Â“authenticÂ” Rocky Jones rocket ship had been built that was wheeled around to various festivals, fairs and promotional events (NOTE: The Silvercup Rocket made its premiere appearance at the Michigan State Fair in September 1954). Even though the show had been out of production for months occasionally cast members would still show up to greet kids and sign autographs.\n\nEventually publicity for the show dwindled and by the end of 1956 Rocky Jones, Space Ranger was all but gone. Official Films, who had been the showÂ’s original distributor, re-edited all of the three chapter episodes into 78 minute films that began airing on TV during 1956, usually under modified names (NOTE: see titles listed below). By November of that year Roland Reed Productions had shut down.\n\nThe show regained some popularity in 1992 when two of the edited movie versions were used on the comedy series Mystery Science Theater 3000. Manhunt in Space (formerly Pirates of Prah) and Crash of Moons were viewed by the captives of the Satellite of Love while they made humorous remarks about the showÂ’s acting, sets and dialogue. This lampooning actually resulted in a new found fame for the series and Rocky Jones has since developed a cult following. Thanks to the foresight of Roland Reed to produce the series on film stock RockyÂ’s rollicking space adventures can still be seen by todayÂ’s fans in all their glorious, 1950Â’s black & white splendor.\n\n- Tom NoÃ«l\n\nI would like to acknowledge the fine Rocky Jones article by Alan Asherman in Filmfax #19 (March 1990), continued in Filmfax #20 (May 1990) for confirming many of the details and dates noted above. Those articles also include information supplied by Jan Alan Henderson and an episode guide by Andy Anderson (modified slightly by myself).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSection 2: Production Order of Episodes\n\nFirst off, these are the correct episode titles taken directly from the screen credits. I should note that the narrator says Â“TheÂ” before both Silver Needle in the Sky and Crash of Moons, but I prefer to use the title that appeared on the screen as Â“official.Â”\n\nSecond, some episode guides reverse the order of episodes 3 and 4, but I believe this list is the correct production order. In episodes 1, 2 and 3 listed above the Space RangerÂ’s casual uniform is a light gray hat and a bright white t-shirt. In every other episode they wear a dark hat and a light gray t-shirt. Therefore, I believe Escape Into Space belongs with the first two in production order.\n\nOtherwise, Beyond the Curtain of Space is obviously the first episode. We are introduced to Vena Ray and she appears as a crew member in every other show. BobbyÂ’s Comet comes next as we take our first trip to the planet Fornax. Then comes Escape Into Space because the story line takes us back to Fornax.\n\nThe first 9 episodes are all copyright 1953. It is difficult to determine the exact order for episodes 4 through 9, but using the appearance and reappearance of characters and certain story lines this order makes the most sense.\n\nBlast-Off is definitely episode 10 since Winky is now missing, but Professor Newton is still in the story. This is the first show copyright 1954.\n\nFinally, based on new character introductions and story lines the balance of the 1954 copyrighted episodes are as listed above, culminating in The Trial of Rocky Jones.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSection 3: Broadcast Order of Episodes (Based on the Detroit area television listings)\n\nRocky Jones, Space Ranger debuted on WXYZ-TV Channel 7 in Detroit at 6:30 PM Tuesday, February 23, 1954. The schedule below is taken directly from television listings in four different local periodicals. As you can see the broadcast order varies from the production order described previously. Also, when the first run of episodes was complete and the show began to air reruns the order was changed again.\n\nSources: Detroit Free Press Â– Sunday Magazine with TV Prevue\n\nDetroit News Â– Television Guide for the Week\n\nDetroit Times Â– TV for the Week\n\nTV Today (a regional TV guide covering Detroit, MI Cleveland, OH and Buffalo, NY)\n\nTV Guide (some issues from the Midwest gave listings with episode titles)\n\nSome additional comments about the broadcast schedule listed above:\n\nThe week before Rocky Jones debuted viewers of that time slot were treated to an episode of the series My Hero. That week Robert Cummings starred in Big Crush.\n\nAfter nine weeks Rocky Jones shifted from Tuesdays at 6:30 PM to Tuesdays at 5:30 PM in order to make room for the series Cavalcade of America.\n\nAfter the series was already well into reruns the show was moved to Sunday afternoon at 2:00 PM.\n\nChapter 3 of the episode Blast-Off aired on 5/15/55. This is the last listing of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger in the Detroit area TV listings in any of the source publications I reviewed. The show was replaced by Laurel & Hardy.\n\nReaders of this information should remember that in different viewing markets across the country Rocky Jones, Space Ranger aired at different times and on different days. The episodes may not have been in the same order and reruns may have run longer into 1955. For example:\n\nWXYZ-TV Detroit, MI Tuesday at 6:30 PM WNBT-TV New York City Thursday at 6:00 PM WSLS-TV Roanoke, VA Thursday at 6:30 PM WBKB-TV Alpena, MI Saturday at 5:30 PM WTTG-TV Washington, DC Sunday at 5:30 PM\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSection 4: Rocky Jones Memorabilia\n\n1951 Coloring Book from Whitman Publishing.\n\n1952 Advertisement discussing merchandising Rocky Jones.\n\n1953 Fan Club Membership Card.\n\n1953 Fan Club Membership Certificate.\n\n1953 Space Ranger Pins.
