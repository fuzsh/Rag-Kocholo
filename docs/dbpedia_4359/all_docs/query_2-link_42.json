And here’s some more good news—you’re invited!\n\nFess is at his finest in these three special programs that feature everybody’s favorite outdoorsman and revolutionary: Daniel Boone. Come along as he blazes his Wilderness Road through the High Cumberland from North Carolina through Tennessee and off to Kentucky. It won’t be easy, since he’ll have to fight loyalists, pursuers, and his own greedy men along the way.\n\nFinally, enjoy the movie that started a national craze and had children singing “Davy! Davy Crockett” as Fess brings to life the legendary explorer in the original coonskin cap. Davy and his friend, George Russell, fight for survival on the frontier … Davy serves in Congress … and then meets up with George again to fight in the battle of the Alamo.\n\nThis birthday celebration will make you feel like a kid again. So, go ahead: put on your old coonskin cap and follow Daniel Boone’s travels, sing the “Ballad of Davy Crockett,” and raise a glass in a birthday salute to the one and only Fess Parker!\n\nSUN, AUG 18\n\n12PM ET: Daniel Boone – The High Cumberland: Part 1\n\n1PM ET: Daniel Boone – The High Cumberland: Part 2\n\n2PM ET: Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier"
