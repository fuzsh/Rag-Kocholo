        "text": "Filming will soon start on the Lone Ranger movie and Disney is sparing no expense to make it authentic.\n\nKRQE’s pilot-reporter Bob Martin found what looked to be a film set just outside of Albuquerque:\n\nCarpenters and other technicians are rapidly creating a detailed and authentic-looking town from the old west.\n\nAlthough the New Mexico State Film Office neither confirms nor denies this set is for the Disney motion picture The Lone Ranger, industry insiders say it is.\n\nCasting agents have already crisscrossed the state recruiting extras for the film, including many Native Americans.\n\nThe extras will work alongside actor’s Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp who will play the lone ranger and Tonto.\n\nLots of other preparations are underway in area studios and workshops.\n\nMeanwhile, the new movie town is nestled in the quiet and undeveloped Rio Puerco Valley just west of Rio Rancho.\n\nThis setting and others around New Mexico will allow Disney to step back in time and try to return to “those thrilling days of yesteryear”.\n\nLast year Disney actually canceled the film when the budget ballooned past $250 million.\n\nIt was brought back to life when producers were able to reduce the budget to closer to $200 million."
