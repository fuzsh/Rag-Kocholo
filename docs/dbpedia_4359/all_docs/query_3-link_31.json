        "text": "Park rangers help protect and share places of natural or historical significance. They do this by managing these areas, making them available and enjoyable to visitors. They share information on how to make the most of your trip, offer educational programs to help visitors understand the importance of the park, maintain facilities, and keep the parks safe for everyone.\n\nWhat Does a Park Ranger Do?\n\nMost park ranger positions follow one of two career paths: education and interpretation, or law enforcement (also referred to as “protection”). Those working as park educators and interpreters:\n\nPlan and conduct educational programs for the public on the science, culture, or history of a park\n\nProvide information about the park to guests at a visitors' center, or upon request\n\nConduct field trips to point out park highlights\n\nMaintain park structures and facilities\n\nCreate educational displays and write brochures\n\nCollect park fees\n\nBuild and maintain trails\n\nThose in management or administrative positions manage budgets, supplies, employees and schedules.\n\nRangers involved in park protection patrol the grounds, possibly including backcountry areas, by vehicle, foot, and bike.

Some parks provide housing for rangers, though resources are often limited.\n\nThe work can sometimes be strenuous. Park rangers work outside in all kinds of weather. Some work may be done in relative isolation in backcountry areas. Cleaning of campground facilities and other manual labor is often part of the job. Park rangers may also face dangerous situations, particularly when patrolling for drug and other illegal activity. They may need to confront dangerous people, and may encounter dangerous animals.\n\nWhat Is the Average Park Ranger Salary?\n\nPark rangers, who fall under the broader BLS category of forest and conservation workers, earned a median salary of $30,640 as of May 2020. The top 10% in this profession earned more than $48,700 during this time.*\n\nPark Ranger Jobs\n\nPark ranger jobs focus on protecting and conserving natural resources in a federal or state park or rangeland setting. Duties vary significantly from job to job, but the following list includes typical job duties one might encounter as a park ranger:\n\nFirst response to natural or manmade threats to parkland\n\nCombat forest fires; facilitate additional crews for emergency management\n\nPerform search and rescue missions by means of overland, air, or technology via drone technology or GIS\n\nStay up to date on health and safety regulations\n\nProvide technical park services and information to adjacent landowners, ecologists and policymakers\n\nAssist with state lands management, resources, and wildlife\n\nInspect sites for environmental field reports\n\nWork in remote park locations in all weather conditions\n\nProcess forestry specimens and samples\n\nAssess new growth or rehabilitated areas; generate reports\n\nSupervise herbicides and insecticides usage to manage pests, weeds, and disease\n\nMaintain and construct facilities and equipment\n\nPatrol forest areas on land and by air\n\nEnsure that visitors to the area have the supplies and skills required to hunt, fish, camp, or hike in the park\n\nEnforce state and federal wildlife laws in regard to hunting, fishing, and camping\n\nEducate visitors and the public on a variety of conservation issues and how they might impact the park\n\nCreate and facilitate park and wildlife safety programs\n\nHire and train volunteer park staff\n\nSenior park rangers are eligible for the role of team lead or manager at some point in their career. Some of the additional tasks that accompany this senior position are:\n\nConsult with lawmakers regarding regulations which may impact the state park\n\nManage state parklands and resources\n\nOversee park assessments and environmental reporting\n\nPrepare reports and proposals for submittal to funding agencies\n\nDeploy and remotely manage teams in all weather conditions and locations with appropriate training and resources\n\nOversee the mapping of state parkland, resources, wildlife and access roads using whatever means required for accuracy\n\nAssess and report on new growth or rehabilitated parkland\n\nManage the use of herbicides and insecticides to implement pest, weed, and disease control within the park and surrounding natural environs\n\nManage response to natural or manmade threats to forest areas\n\nAdvocate on behalf of the park and its wildlife to the public\n\nFacilitate search and rescue missions within the park\n\nSchedule a patrol schedule that best utilizes human resources and equipment\n\nCreate policy that regulates visitors to the park\n\nCreate park safety programs\n\nNote staffing and funding shortfalls and work to address the gap\n\nProvide technical forestry services and information to adjacent landowners\n\nWhat Is the Job Demand for Park Rangers?\n\nThe BLS predicts job demand for park rangers to decline about 8 percent between 2020 and 2030.*\n\nWhat Do Park Rangers Study?\n\nMost park ranger positions require a four-year bachelor's degree. Rangers may have degrees in recreation and tourism management or environmental education. However, a solid background in earth science, environmental science, and biology is important for work at many locations. Many rangers have relevant degrees in biology, forestry, natural resource management and conservation, wildlife biology, or ecology. Study in these subjects prepares them for becoming park interpreters, so they can educate visitors about natural and scientific features. Some aspiring rangers study history to prepare for careers at historically significant sites, such as battlefields.\n\nCompetition for ranger positions is fierce, particularly within the National Park Service. Those with college degrees in earth and environmental sciences will have an edge in the job market. Experience is also very important. Start volunteering early - there are many opportunities for summer or seasonal volunteers. Dedicated future rangers start with volunteer work while in high school. Volunteering at the same park for a few years in a row can help strengthen your connections with insiders, so they'll remember you when it comes time to apply for full-time or seasonal paid positions.\n\nEmployment with the National Park Service (NPS) is limited to American citizens. Candidates may also need to meet age and physical qualifications.\n\nNew federal employees in the national parks have two years to complete the NPS Fundamentals program, an orientation to the agency that involves travel to onsite training in Washington, D.C. and Grand Canyon National Park. Continuing education opportunities are available through NPS.\n\nDegrees Related to Park Rangers\n\nFish & Wildlife Management Degree\n\nIndustrial Engineering Online Degree Info\n\nReady to become a Park Ranger?
