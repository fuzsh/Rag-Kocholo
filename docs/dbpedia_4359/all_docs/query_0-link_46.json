        "text": "The new 2024 Netflix film Land of Bad kicks off with a scene in which an Air Force Tactical Air Controller, Sergeant JJ Kinney (played by Liam Hemsworth), is trying to decide whether to bring a hotel-sized box of either Fruit Loops or Frosted Flakes on his impending special operations mission with three Delta Force operators in the southern Philippines. It is a fitting scene for the viewer, as picking a military-themed action movie to watch is like picking between two sugary cereals: no matter which you choose, the selection is bound to be loaded with artificial ingredients, the colorful packaging probably masks disappointment, and ultimately, the choice will you leave unsatisfied. Fortunately, Land of Bad is more akin to Raisin Nut Bran than Fruit Loops.\n\nHaving thoroughly tortured that metaphor, let’s look at what makes Land of Bad an intelligent and enjoyable military thriller movie. The plot centers around Hemsworth’s TACP airman, who is tagging along as the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) for a small Delta Force unit whose mission is to locate a “CIA asset” that was last scene in the company of a shady arms dealer in the southern Philippines. We’ll ignore the baffling aspect of this “CIA asset” being an apparently American citizen – who is also inexplicably referred to later as a “JSOC asset” – and focus on the rescue force.\n\nThe three Delta operators, when we first meet them on a helo en route to executing a HALO jump into the target area, initially seem like they will be the same cookie-cutter, brainless killing machines we are often served up in special operations-themed movies. I was prepared to be derisive and dismissive, but then the writers threw in some smart nuance between the bravado and gung-ho spirit, quickly imbuing the three with actual human qualities within a few lines of dialogue. The result is that the three end up being a healthy mix of ferocity, fearlessness, stoicism, and resignation once we get to know them, and especially once fate befalls some of them later. I won’t give the plot away, but suffice it to say that things come off the rails early on in the mission when a group of Abu Sayyef terrorists shows up at the target compound the men are about to assault, setting up for us the JTAC’s story of survival that encompasses the majority of the movie.\n\nRelated: MARSOC: A guide to becoming an elite Marine Raider\n\nHemsworth’s Kinney has the essential task of coordinating air support for the operation, and the writers do a great job of capturing how AFSOC TACPs are often treated by Navy SEALs, Delta Force operators, and Green Berets when out in the field. It is a mix of good-natured ribbing derived from inter-service and inter-SOF rivalry and complete reliance on the JTAC to save their ass if and when things go wrong. The writers clearly know their subject matter in that regard and did a great job portraying it on screen.\n\nKinney’s link to the available air assets throughout is a terrific Russell Crow, who plays Captain Eddie “Reaper” Grimm, an on-the-spectrum former “regular” pilot with major authority issues. He’s now a 50-something Air Force junior officer who sits in an air-conditioned hut back in the States overwatching the operation and providing air support in the form of bombs and missiles when required (and yes, they will be required). The physically remote yet emotionally critical link between Kinney and Reaper harkens back to films like Behind Enemy Lines and Bat-21. And like those two movies, Land of Bad falls squarely into the tradition of the lone service member surviving until he can be rescued.\n\nGrimm’s partner in the drone hut throughout is Staff Sergeant Nia Branson, who provides the constant eyes for the unit on the ground, played effectively by Chika Ikogwe. The warm relationship between the aging Crowe and the younger Ikogwe is portrayed well with some nice human touches thrown in that manage to elevate the characters to more than just “eyes in the sky” for the operators.\n\nWhile there are still some of the fantastical elements we find in most war movies – seemingly unlimited ammo at times, death-defying falls and fights, and nick-of-time lifesaving stunts – the flying bullets, radio lingo, tactical movements, and a fair amount of the combat dialogue are all pretty legit. The final result is a satisfying and entertaining war movie that is a pretty damn good selection for a little cinematic diversion.\n\nRead more from Sandboxx News"
