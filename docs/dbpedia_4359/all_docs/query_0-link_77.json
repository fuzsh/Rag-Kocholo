        "text": "Growing up in the 90s, I had all of the Power Rangers stuff. Everything from the dragon sword, to the action figures, the video games, and even the Megazord. The mighty morphing Power Rangers took America by storm when debuted in 1993, and as an eight-year-old, I was totally obsessed with the show.\n\nI Didn’t realize it was based on a Japanese television series called Super Sentai, but it didn’t matter. Watching the television show back as an adult, I realize just how funny it is that literally every single episode has the same exact formula to it.\n\nI didn’t realize that one of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was a Michigander. One of the original Power Rangers was Walter Emmanuel Jones, who played the original Black Ranger and was born and raised in Detroit.\n\nBefore starring in the show, he appeared in Beverly Hills 90210 and the Malcolm X film. But it was his role as a Power Ranger that I remember him by. That’s why I was excited when he reprised his role as the Black Ranger in the 2023 30th anniversary special film Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once and Always.\n\nIt’s pretty cool that Michigan can say they’re home to one of the most badass Power Rangers from back in the day. Although it's a bit suspect that they had him as the Black Ranger and Thuy Trang as the Yellow Ranger, The Mighty Morphin Power Ranger remains one of the coolest shows from my childhood."
