        "text": "Moab's Unique Movie History\n\nSurrounding yourself with big screen scenery only requires a ticket to Moab, Utah. After all, it was the Duke (John Wayne) himself that said you have to go, \"where God put the West\". The Moab area has long been renowned for its beautiful, otherworldly scenery, a quality which attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world, year after year. Not surprisingly, it’s this same stark, rugged scenery that has been attracting filmmakers here ever since the 1940s. Roughly 80 percent of the TV and movies filmed in Moab area have been shot in the Professor Valley - also known as Castle Valley where the Colorado River meanders observantly through the scene. You can see it for yourself on our Full or Half Day Colorado River Adventure.\n\nMany movies filmed in Moab have been largely forgotten, such as the 1983 film Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone and the 1988 Western-horror-redneck comedy Sundown: the Vampire in Retreat. Some Moab movies and media backgrounds however, have become classics. Remember, we're not only talking about movies, but commercials, print advertisements (ie. Marlboro man) and music videos like Bon Jovi's \"Blaze of Glory\" video, complete with flames atop the red rock cliffs.\n\nWe've put together a YouTube playlist video montage (below) but first wanted to open with the Bon Jovi music video, which pays tribute to the old drive-in movie, whose burning screen plays the feature film Young Guns! It's an appropriate opener!\n\n127 Hours – 2010\n\nAsk Moab locals what they think of the film 127 Hours and you’ll typically get a roll of the eyes and a lecture on hiking safely while you’re in the desert. The film however, opened to critical acclaim and Aron Ralston himself, played by James Franco in the film, described it as “So factually accurate it is as close to a documentary as you can get and still be a drama.” The film was shot in the same location where Ralston was trapped for his eponymous 127 hour ordeal, in a hard-to-reach area of the Blue John Canyon."
