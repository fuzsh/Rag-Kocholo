        "text": "[RYAN ROBERTSON]\n\nTHE DOMINANCE OF DRONES IN UKRAINE IS GIVING RISE TO ANOTHER TREND–FRANKEN SYSTEMS. WHETHER IT’S DECADES OLD AMERICAN-MADE HAWK AIR DEFENSE MISSILES MOUNTED TO SOVIET-ERA LAUNCHERS, OR WORLD WAR II ERA MACHINE GUNS MOUNTED TOGETHER, THE INNOVATION DRIVE TO DOWN DRONES IS STRONG.\n\nBUT RHEINMETALL, ONE OF THE LARGEST DEFENSE CONTRACTORS IN EUROPE,\n\nMAY HAVE THE BEST FRANKEN SYSTEM WE’VE SEEN YET. MORE OF A FRANKENTANK, REALLY.\n\nIT’S STILL A LITTLE CONCEPTUAL AT THIS POINT, BUT HERE’S WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE: A SKYRANKER SHORT RANGE AIR DEFENSE MODULE MOUNTED TO THE CHASSIS OF A LEOPARD 1 MAIN BATTLE TANK.\n\nBUILT DURING THE COLD WAR, LEOPARD 1s ARE NOT THE NEWEST MBTs, BUT THEY ARE STILL IN USE, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, MANEUVERABLE. UKRAINE HAS WELL OVER 100 WITH MORE ON THE WAY. THE DECADES OLD TANK CHASSIS COULD BE GREAT DELIVERY PLATFORMS FOR ONE OF THE NEWEST AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE.\n\nTHE HEAD OF LAND SYSTEMS AT RHEINMETALL ANNOUNCED THE PLANS TO AUGMENT THE OLDER TANKS WITH THE SKYRANGER 35 TURRET, WHICH USES THE WIDELY POPULAR 35MM REVOLVER CANNON MADE BY OERLIKON.\n\nTHE SAME TURRET CAN ALSO BE MODIFIED TO ACCOMMODATE A 30MM GUN, WHICH THEN LEAVES ENOUGH ROOM TO ATTACH A TWIN LAUNCHER FOR STINGER MISSILES, OR SIMILAR MUNITIONS.\n\nTHE SKYRANGER USES OERLIKON’S ‘AHEAD’ AMMUNITION. IT’S AN AIR-BURST ROUND, RAPIDLY RELEASING WAVES OF SMALL PROJECTILES TO TAKE DOWN ENEMY THREATS.\n\nTHE SKYRANGER 35 IS EFFECTIVE AGAINST DRONES, ROCKETS, MORTARS AND EVEN SOME MISSILES OUT TO A RANGE OF ABOUT 2 AND A HALF MILES. THE 30MM GUN IS EFFECTIVE TO ABOUT 1.8 MILES.\n\nSKYRANGER IS A SYSTEM THAT COULD FILL A CRITICAL NEED RIGHT NOW FOR UKRAINE. THE MODULAR DESIGN MEANS IT CAN BE UPGRADED QUICKLY, AND MOUNTING IT TO LEOPARD 1s MEANS IT COULD BE FIELDED FAIRLY QUICKLY AS WELL.\n\nOF COURSE RHEINMETALL WOULD LIKE TO SEE ITS SKYRANGER TURRETS ON AS MANY VEHICLES AS POSSIBLE, WHICH IS WHY THE COMPANY MAKES VARIATIONS THAT FIT THE MORE MODERN LEOPARD 2 TANKS, AS WELL AS BOXER WHEELED ARMORED VEHICLE.\n\nFOR MORE REPORTING ON THE WAR IN UKRAINE, AND THE DIFFERENT WEAPONS BEING USED THERE, BE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE STRAIGHT ARROW NEWS APP TODAY OR CHECK US OUT AT S-A-N DOT COM.\n\nFOR STRAIGHT ARROW NEWS, I’M RYAN ROBERTSON."
