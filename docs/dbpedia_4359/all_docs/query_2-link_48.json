Plan to wear sneakers or closed-toed shoes if you are going to be walking on the boardwalk (1.5 miles round trip) or taking a boat tour with Okefenokee Adventures. A hat and sunglasses will probably be something you don't want to forget. It is always recommended to be prepared for changing weather conditions, you never know when an afternoon storm will pop up! Be advised that after rain, some of the refuge hiking trails may be flooded/partially flooded. Plan to wear something comfortable when in the outdoors so you can best enjoy your visit to the refuge!\n\nWhat should I bring on my trip to the refuge? If you are a kayaker or canoeist, you may want to bring your boat/paddle/pfd and take one of the day-use paddling trails to experience the Okefenokee. If you are a birder, don't forget your binoculars as there are sure to be opportunities for viewing red-cockaded woodpeckers, sandhill cranes, owls, and others. Whatever your interest, have a camera with you as Okefenokee is one of the most picturesque and photographic places! Sunscreen, bug spray, water, snacks, are recommended for EVERYONE!\n\nWhen is the best time to visit the refuge? Each season of the Okefenokee is quite different from wildlife you may see to the flowers blooming in the prairies and the upland forests, so visit any time of year! Generally, for wildlife observation early morning or later in the evening are the best times where they are up and moving around. Also, the summer months can be quite hot and buggy by the afternoon, so plan an early morning trip during the months of July-early September.\n\nWhat is there to do at Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge? One of the greatest things about Okefenokee is that there is something for everyone to do - the refuge has the Swamp Island Drive (Wildlife Drive), hiking trails, canoe/kayak trails, boat trails (for motorboats less than 10HP), guided boat tours, and the Richard S.
