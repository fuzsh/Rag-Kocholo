        "text": "Stories You May Like\n\nThis month’s feature titles include Dr. Fauci’s memoir, a bestselling YA author’s adult debut, and poetry inspired by the Grand Canyon\n\nDid you know that Cornell has an online book club? Check it out!\n\nFor more titles by Big Red authors, peruse our previous round-ups.\n\nHave you published a book you'd like to submit? Scroll down for details!\n\nThere, he led the U.S. response to outbreaks from Zika to COVID—and, during the latter, became a political lightning rod for opponents of pandemic-driven mask mandates and restrictions on public gatherings.\n\n“If Fauci’s childhood reminiscences can be stiff and dutiful,” says the Washington Post, “his accounts of the health emergencies he weathered as a public servant—particularly the AIDS epidemic—are gripping.”\n\nWhile Jasmyn is in many ways relieved to be in a place devoid of societal racism, she has a creeping sense of unease about how Liberty’s residents seem to lose touch with their Black identity—particularly after spa treatments at the wellness center.\n\n“The affection and care [Yoon] has for all her characters and the reasons that have taken them to Liberty deepen the novel’s stakes and heighten its terror,” says the New York Times. “Yoon also reminds us, through Jasmyn’s friendships and her relationship with her husband, King, of the richness and intimacy of Black culture, and underlines how much more we are than our trauma.”\n\n“That, at least, is the explanation put forward by Klein … who jokingly claims that the Rock narrated the story of the town’s history to him—in French, which the author then transcribed and translated.”\n\nAs the publisher explains, that limestone slab “infallibly remembers every moment of its existence, from the Roman conquest of Gaul to the fall of feudal aristocracy, from the domination of the Catholic Church to the present French representative democracy.”\n\nStories You May Like\n\nKlein’s other works include Eat Fat, a “postmodern diet book” in which he contemplates the beauty and value of corpulent bodies.\n\n“Energetic black-and-white illustrations complement the cheerful tone of the narrative and capture some of the book’s funniest moments to great effect,” says School Library Journal, calling the volume “a welcome addition to early chapter book collections, and a surefire hit for animal lovers.”\n\nPet-a-Palooza follows the earlier entries Not Really Buddies and Tiny Tornadoes; a fourth, Say Cheese, is set for September 2024.\n\nAs she writes in a poem titled “Arena”: “The sky is out again, galloping on its inherited ribbon. It’s so easy / to stand under it: the whole pulse / of the world, the dead stars, clouds slinking around, thinking rain, / thinking landless, then giving up on that / and wandering slow with a thought of tomorrow.”\n\nCamp’s seven previous poetry collections include Worn Smooth between Devourings, An Eye in Each Square, and Took House.\n\n(Even the most broken-hearted readers, however, will likely decline another of Ovid’s tips: putting your lost love out of your mind by going off to war.)\n\nHow to Get Over a Breakup is Fontaine’s fourth entry in the series, following How to Drink, How to Tell a Joke, and How to Grieve. Up next: How to Have Willpower, followed by How to Speak Freely.\n\nPublished July 9, 2024"
