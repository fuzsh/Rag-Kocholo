        "text": "This is my second ranger 7 plus I ran it into the back of my car smashed the camera but it's still flies so I bought a new one the same ranger 7 plus they are good machine stable in the air. On the 4th I'm going to take it up and see if I can get videos of fireworks I think that would be cool. What do you guys think of that is anybody tried it. I will put videos of it in later wish me luck.\n\nI received the EXO X7 Ranger Plus (in red) with no obstacle avoidance. I have flown some competitors drones and this one readily compares to them in quality, stability, flight time and ease of use. Right out o the box the drone was ready to fly, with the exception of registration and the calibration process. The drone is smooth and responsive and the still photo and video are good quality. I opted to buy two additional batteries as once you get it in the air, you don't want to stop. Would love to upgrade to the Blackhawk 3 Pro soon to expand my flight experiences and flight times. Overall a good quality drone at a good price over the competitors.\n\nThe drone is awesome! It withstands wind and flys smoothly even for first time flyers. But the obstacle avoidance is useless. There is no way to control it and it made my drone fly straight up, luckily the drone is well made and survived the emergency landing. All in all a great drone, but DO NOT BUY THE OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE, but definitely buy this drone."
