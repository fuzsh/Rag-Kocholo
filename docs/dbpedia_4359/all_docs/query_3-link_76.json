        "text": "The 434th Operations Support Squadron has a new commander. Lt. Col. Brian D. Thompson took command during a ceremony at Grissom Air Reserve Base, August 4, 2024.\n\nCol. David Curl, 434th Operations Group Commander, presided over the ceremony formally placing Thompson in the position in the presence of 434th Air Refueling Wing leadership and Airmen as well as many of Thompson’s family and friends in attendance.\n\nIn his remarks, Curl spoke highly of Thompson’s leadership qualities and history of selfless service.\n\n“It’s about a genuine desire to make a difference,” said Curl. “Selfless service transcends the boundaries of race, religion, and socio-economic status. Brian Thompson is this kind of selfless leader.”\n\nThompson’s previous role was chief of weapons and tactics for the 434th OSS, and he has a strong rapport with the Airmen he will be leading according to Curl.\n\nFollowing Curl’s speech, he presented the 434th OSS guidon to Thompson, symbolically bestowing him with the responsibility of leading the squadron.\n\nIn Thompson’s speech, he used the metaphor of a dinosaur park to describe his subordinate flights’ roles, likening each section to a different type of dinosaur exhibit and placing himself in the authority of the park ranger who is trying to keep everything running smoothly.\n\n“I want the dinosaur park to look nice and I want the dinosaurs to look and act nice,” said Thompson. “Because we’re all here at the bill of the taxpayer,”\n\nIn Thompson’s metaphor, the dinosaur cages represent the workplace and claws represent the lethality of the dinosaurs.\n\n“The claws part comes into play on that fateful day when it’s time for you to do what dinosaurs do,” said Thompson. “Don’t forget about that fighter mentality.”\n\nAs the 434th OSS Commander, Thompson will supervise 11 flights which are responsible for the day-to-day operational support and training for the 434th Operations Group."
