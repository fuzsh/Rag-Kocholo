        "text": "By Tommy Mabson -\n\nCheck your Swatch, pop an ice-cold Zima, and get ready for the Sky Ranger XLT Convertible episode of Ford Made WHAT!?!\n\nALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT! We’re getting to the tail end of Summer when BBQ season is coming to a close, wearing white becomes unfashionable, and kicking your day off with a water gun fight goes from fun and becomes a cry for help. This fascinating Ford pickup is the perfect transition vehicle to take us from these warmer heady months to the cooler glide that is the fall. Say hello to the Ford Sky Ranger XLT Convertible.\n\nYes, we could totally see someone at Ford staring at a Ranger brochure through a kaleidoscope and running around a conference room yelling NO ROOF NO TOP like a crazy person, but alas that doesn’t seem to be the case. This amazing gem was part of the first-gen Ranger lineup from back in the run of the early ’90s.\n\nA company by the name of Professional Auto Crafters, which was located near the Ford plant, built these as a privately funded short-run and then pitched to the suits at Ford. They hoped to build these third-party conversions to sell on official dealer lots. But Ford said now. The way things shook out, Professional Auto Crafters built just under 20 of Sky Ranger XLT Convertibles before closing shop.\n\nThe XLT trim is very befitting for this concoction since an “extra luxurious truck” is exactly what it is. However, if you can find one of these (hint: check eBay often) they’re surprisingly cheap. Like you might be able to trade a sack full of those beanie babies that we all thought would be worth something way back when for one.\n\nThe genius of the SkyRanger is that the Targa-ish rag top folds down to disappear behind the front seats in a way that looks very streamlined. According to the brochure, buyers could opt for a GTS model with more aggressive aero.\n\nUnder the hood was a 4.0-liter V6 hooked to a five-speed manual so rowing delight al the live-long day. Other creature features that make the experience sweeter include an AC that blows colder than a dead marriage, a decent cassette tape deck that may or not contain Jon Bon Jovi, and seats with polyester fibers woven in.\n\nAlso, since this is the XLT, there is power everything with the only exception being the ragtop which is a manual crank system that will result in some pretty sweet biceps. There’s really no way you could lose with one of these.\n\nThat’s all for this week for another crazy creation that wears the Ford badge. In all honesty, this truck would make quite the addition to any garage out there for the unique abilities it has while also dripping with that boxy ’90s design. It’s the be anything you want me to be pickup that comes with a heaping dose of aesthetic that screams the mustard is off the hotdog, folks! Let’s reconvene next week and hopefully those Reebok Pumps I just bought online won’t have busted airbags in them from age.\n\nPhotos:\n\nJoin the Ford Truck Enthusiasts forums now!"
