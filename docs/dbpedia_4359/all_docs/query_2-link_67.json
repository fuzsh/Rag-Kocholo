        "text": "BC Parks requires that any person wishing to conduct a filming project within the provincial protected areas system first contact the regional staff person responsible for the particular parks they are interested in. Contacts for many parks can be found in the special filming conditions and park contacts [PDF] document. For general information on permit requirements or contact information for a particular park, please contact Megan Beveridge.\n\nFor more information on BC Parks’ film permitting process, or to submit a permit application, please visit FrontCounter BC’s website. FrontCounter BC is a provincial agency that manages applications for a number of different provincial government agencies. Film permit applications and fees must be submitted to FrontCounter BC.\n\nInformation on filming in provincial parks, including major parks in the Sea-to-Sky corridor and around the Vancouver area, can also be found on FrontCounter BC’s website under special filming conditions and park contacts [PDF].\n\nMany of BC’s parks and protected areas fall within the traditional territories of British Columbia’s First Nations peoples. Some of these parks may be managed in a collaborative relationship with a respective First Nation. Your commercial filming request may require engagement with First Nations regarding impacts to their aboriginal rights and interests before BC Parks will approve your permit application. Please check with the Area Supervisor listed for the park you are interested in for further information."
