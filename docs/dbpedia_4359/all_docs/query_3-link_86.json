        "text": "​​\n\nWhat We Do & How We Do It\n\nDo you want to inspire an appreciation and passion in others for outdoor recreation and natural resources stewardship? Park Rangers with Colorado Parks and Wildlife have the opportunity to work across the entire state, serving all Coloradans as well as the many people who visit our beautiful state. It’s not an easy job — between our varied geography, conditions, and recreational opportunities — but it’s one that matters to the future of Colorado.\n\nState Park Rangers wear many diverse hats, but their general duties are to provide public safety, natural resource protection and administrative management of those areas. Depending on the day, location, and season, you may find yourself involved with many of the following opportunities as a Park Ranger:\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nEnvironmental education\n\nEmergency Medical Services (EMS)\n\nSearch and Rescue\n\nSupervise, train, and evaluate temporary employees or volunteers\n\nAdministrative duties related to park activities and law enforcement proceedings\n\nTrail work\n\nBoating, rafting, OHVs, and snowmobiles\n\nWildfires\n\nThis is an entry-level position and all of the training and experience truly required for the job will be given to you once you are hired.\n\nWhat Does it Take to Become a Park Ranger?\n\nEducation\n\nA four year degree is required, but we will accept any major. The most competitive applicants have a bachelor's degree in biology, ecology, earth sciences, environmental science, forestry, geology, natural resource management, outdoor recreation management, range management, parks administration, wildlife biology, zoology or a closely related field.\n\nAppropriate work experience which provides the same kind, amount and level of knowledge as the required education may be substituted on a year-for-year basis for the bachelor’s degree.\n\nPeople Skills\n\nPark Rangers interact with the general public on a daily basis. We are seeking people who are skilled at communicating and engaging with their communities and who are comfortable interacting with people of all ages, viewpoints, and backgrounds. You will also need good public speaking and conflict resolution skills.\n\nPhysical Assessment\n\nAll applicants must pass a physical fitness test, the requirements of the test are:\n\nRun 300 meters in 72 seconds\n\n21 push-ups in one minute\n\n28 sit-ups in one minute\n\nWalk/run 1.5 miles in 17:00 minutes\n\nAdditional Requirements\n\nAll applicants must:\n\nPossess and maintain a valid State of Colorado driver’s license at time of hire\n\nSubmit to a drug screening\n\nBe willing to be fingerprinted\n\nSuccessfully pass a background investigation.\n\nEmployees offered a conditional employment must successfully complete the Colorado Parks and Wildlife training program including successful completion of the basic Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) program for certification as a Peace Officer with Colorado.\n\nNOTE: If you have used marijuana in the past year, used other illegal drugs in the past three years, been convicted of a felony, been convicted of any domestic violence charge, or been convicted of any misdemeanors which preclude POST certification as a Colorado Peace Officer, you will be disqualified and will not be hired.\n\nGet Involved\n\nVisit\n\nFamiliarizing yourself with our parks and their work gives you an edge over less prepared candidates, so come and visit us! Find a State Park near you on this map.\n\nVolunteer\n\nVolunteering is a great way to learn about the agency and gain valuable experience. Find more information on our CPW Volunteer web page.\n\nRide Alongs\n\nSeasonal and Temporary Positions\n\nInternships, seasonal work, and temporary positions are a fantastic way to get your foot in the door. Apply today!\n\nHow to Apply"
