        "text": "Our 42nd album,Â Throw a Saddle on a Star, contains 14 tracks including a bonus Roy Rogers track and new, original Western songs. We love this album and we bet you will too.\n\n40 years ago, Ranger Doug, Too Slim and the late Windy Bill Collins played that first date on the bitter cold evening of November 11th, 1977 at Herr Harryâs Frank Nâ Stein Rathskeller in Nashville, and small listening room dates followed. By August of the following year demand was building, and while Windy Bill left, Woody Paul joined, and the true professional beginnings of the band began at the Kentucky State Fair, where the trio played 10 days for $2500 - and bought their own rooms and meals out of that!"
