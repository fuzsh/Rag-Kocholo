        "text": "The peak of the annual Perseid meteor shower is coming soon. As many as 50 “shooting stars” per hour are expected to streak across the night sky overnight on Sunday, August 11 through Monday, August 12, 2024.\n\nTthe Perseid meteor shower is one of the most dependable and does tend to produce meteors with long, bright trains—as well as the occasional “fireball” visible from cities. So you can see the really bright Perseids anywhere there’s a clear sky, but you’ll need a dark sky to see more than a handful.\n\nCamping out in a dark sky area is the best way to witness the meteor shower, but remember to book accommodations early to avoid missing out. Consult a Light Pollution Map, find Dark Sky Place or plan to visit one of these organized events. Whatever you do, switch your smartphone off—“shooting stars” are blink-and-you’ll-miss-them events that require dark-adapted eyes.\n\nAgate Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska\n\nEvent: “An Evening with the Perseids Meteor Shower”\n\nLocation: Visitor Center\n\nTime: 8:00-10:00 p.m, Sunday, August 11, 2024\n\nThis annual event is hosted by rangers, who will provide telescopes (though don’t expect to see a “shooting star” through one!).
