        "text": "Lone Ranger, renegade lawman in the American West, a fictional character of American radio and television programs, books, films, and comics.\n\nIn all media the Lone Ranger fictions are similar. John Reid was born in 1850 and was the sole survivor of a group of Texas Rangers who were ambushed by outlaws who killed five rangers, including his older brother, Daniel. The Indian Tonto found him and nursed him to health. Reid then donned a black mask made from his dead brother’s vest, mounted his stallion, Silver, and roamed the West as the Lone Ranger to aid those in need, to fight evil, and to establish justice.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nThe character was created in the Lone Ranger radio program by George W. Trendle and Fran Striker. First aired on radio station WXYZ in Detroit, Michigan, in 1933, the radio program was carried by more than 400 American stations by the end of the decade. It was radio that made the Lone Ranger’s theme song, Gioachino Rossini’s William Tell overture, a familiar tune in every child’s repertoire, and it was radio that made “Hi-yo, Silver, away!” a familiar playground exclamation."
