        "text": "This article is about an episode in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n\nFoul Play in the Sky is the fourteenth episode of the first season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nKimberly's plans to go flying with her Uncle Steve take an abrupt twist, when Squatt slips a sleeping potion into her Uncle's drink. Now Kimberly's in the pilot's seat as the only one who can steer the plane to safety. To make matters worse in her absence Rita Repulsa has sent Snizzard who soon overpowers the other Rangers, putting all hope of survival on the Pink Ranger's shoulders for the passengers in the plane, and her team.\n\nPlot[]\n\nKimberly is at the airport with her Uncle Steve, talking to Trini on the phone before he says that they're ready to go. Jason and Zack are training with the punching bag at the Youth Center when Zack takes notice of Angela. He goes to talk to her, but she shoots him down quickly.\n\nRita plans on sneaking a sleeping potion in Steve's drink so that the plane will crash with the Pink Ranger inside. Then she elects Snizzard to be her monster that will destroy the Rangers. Squatt puts the sleep potion in Steve's soda before anyone sees him. Meanwhile, Bulk and Skull are also at the airport, plane spotting. They ask if they can join Kimberly's flight with her Uncle. While Kim is hesitant, Steve says it's all right. As they fly over Angel Grove, Kimberly remembers the mountains, and, thanks to flashbacks, recalls to herself her adventures in the mountains as the Pink Ranger.\n\nIn mid-flight, the potion takes effect and Steve falls asleep suddenly. Bulk and Skull panic and pass out, and Kimberly is left to handle the situation. She alerts Alpha and Zordon, and the former tells her to morph and escape, but she can't because of her unconscious Uncle and passengers. At the same time, the alarm picks up Snizzard's arrival on Earth. The other Rangers morph and confront the monster, while Alpha helps Kimberly maneuver the plane safely.\n\nThe Rangers' Blade Blasters are useless against Snizzard, as the apple on its head reflects their energy attacks. Snizzard binds the Rangers with snakes that drain their energy as they struggle. Meanwhile, Kimberly, with instructions from Alpha, who notified the airport, is finally able to land the plane. Steve wakes up and he takes over. As the first responders arrive, Kim runs to where it's clear, morphs and joins the others. The Pink Ranger shoots Snizzard's apple off his head with an arrow from her Power Bow, ultimately destroying the monster.\n\nThe medics wake Bulk and Skull up at the airport. At the Youth Center, a boy flirts with Kim, having heard about her plane adventure. Zack mocks the two with Jason and then accidentally knocks Angela's drinks onto Bulk.\n\nCast[]\n\nAustin St. John as Jason Lee Scott (Mighty Morphin Red Ranger)\n\nThuy Trang as Trini Kwan (Mighty Morphin Yellow Ranger)\n\nWalter Jones as Zack Taylor (Mighty Morphin Black Ranger)\n\nAmy Jo Johnson as Kimberly Ann Hart (Mighty Morphin Pink Ranger)\n\nDavid Yost as Billy Cranston (Mighty Morphin Blue Ranger)\n\nPaul Schrier as Farkas \"Bulk\" Bulkmeier\n\nJason Narvy as Eugene \"Skull\" Skullovitch\n\nRichard Genelle as Ernie (credits only)\n\nDouglas Sloan as Uncle Steve\n\nRenee Griggs as Angela\n\nDavid Fielding as Zordon\n\nRomy J. Sharf as Alpha 5\n\nRichard Steven Horvitz as Alpha 5 (voice)\n\nMachiko Soga as Rita Repulsa\n\nBarbara Goodson as Rita Repulsa (voice)\n\nTakashi Sakamoto as Goldar\n\nKerrigan Mahan as Goldar (voice) (as Ryan O'Flannigan)\n\nTakako Iiboshi as Finster\n\nRobert Axelrod as Finster (voice)\n\nMinoru Watanabe as Squatt\n\nMichael J. Sorich as Squatt (voice)\n\nHideaki Kusaka as Baboo\n\nDave Mallow as Baboo (voice) (as Colin Phillips)\n\nBryan Cranston as Snizzard (voice)\n\n??? as Matt\n\nErrors[]\n\nThe battle footage between Snizzard and the four Rangers features Japan's own Moai statues from Easter Island. Angel Grove or any part of America would not have these statues.\n\nWhen Trini mentions the apple on Snizzard’s head just after the Rangers’ Blade Blaster attacks are reflected back at them, a dark diamond patch can be seen on the larger white diamond of the Yellow Ranger’s suit; this is where the spark squibs are attached to simulate battle damage.\n\nSome scenes from the original plot made it into the aired episode, such as the scene where Zack is kneeling in the Command Center. Next to him is Kimberly's sleeping body, unseen except for one of her socks. The chair used for Tommy in \"Calamity Kimberly\" can been seen between Jason and Trini when the latter tells Alpha to look after her and she points straight at it.\n\nWhen Kimberly reminisces about memories of the mountains, her flashback contains recycled footage from the original pilot as Audri Dubois can be seen instead of Thuy Trang.\n\nNotes[]\n\nThis is Angela's first appearance of several. She shows up later as Zack's only love interest.\n\nKimberly has her first solo morph in this episode.\n\nThe Snizzard is the very first monster of the week shown to be able to summon foot soldiers to aid him in battle. This would become common place beginning with Radster in Lost Galaxy.\n\nSnizzard's defeat marks the second instance Kimberly destroys a monster with her Power Bow and without the use of a Dinozord, Megazord, or Power Blaster.\n\nSnizzard is the third monster destroyed by a Ranger without the use of a Dinozord, Megazord, or Power Blaster.\n\nThe flashback footage of the Rangers first morph includes a shot of the Putties scratching their heads, which only happened in the unaired pilot.\n\nSee Also[]\n\nEp. 13: Fire! The Golden Arrow - Super Sentai counterpart in Zyuranger. See comparison page. (fight footage)\n\n[]\n\nWatch Foul Play in the Sky on the official YouTube page"
