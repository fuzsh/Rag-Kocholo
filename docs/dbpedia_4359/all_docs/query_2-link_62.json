        "text": "Whether you are sitting on the beach or kayaking near the still water’s edge at Fort De Soto, you find yourself absorbed in the abundance of natural beauty as far as the eye can see. The complexity of the ecology is not immediately apparent, but the park offers the greatest diversity of systems just about anywhere. Emerging from the wealth of bird life, sea life, wildlife and plant life is the majestic tapestry called Fort De Soto.\n\nThe largest park within the Pinellas County Park System, Fort De Soto park consists of 1,136 acres made up of five interconnected islands (keys). These keys are home to beach plants, mangroves, wetlands, palm hammocks, hardwoods and scores of native plants. Each of these species plays a vital role in the preservation and protection of the natural environment.\n\nAnother amazing example of the importance of the park’s natural ecosystems is the more than 328 species of birds that ornithologists have documents over a 60-year span. New species are added every year. The beach also provides refuge to the loggerhead sea turtle, which nests between April and September.\n\nFort De Soto was named America’s Top Beach for 2009 by Tripadvisor, the world’s largest online travel community.
