        "text": "Fiesta Island, situated within Mission Bay, is a sprawling park that attracts numerous charity walks, runs, bicycle races, and special events. It is particularly renowned as the host of the annual Over-the-Line tournament. Accessible from 4:00am to 10:00pm daily, this peninsula offers a plethora of recreational opportunities.\n\nNotably, Fiesta Island welcomes both dogs and horses, making it a pet-friendly haven. Dogs can roam freely, either on or off leash, but owners are kindly reminded to clean up after their animals.\n\nOn the island, visitors can find the Fiesta Island Youth Camp and the Aquatic Center, catering to the diverse interests and needs of the community.\n\nTo ensure safety and preserve the environment, fires are permitted exclusively within the city-provided fire rings that dot the island's shoreline. These fire rings operate on a first come, first served basis. It is essential to note that portable fire containers and fires directly on the sand are strictly prohibited.\n\nFor water sports enthusiasts, there is a designated 5 m.p.h. zone on the island's east side, which serves as a favored spot for recreational activities. Additionally, a permitted water ski area called Hidden Cove exists, and those interested in water skiing can obtain permits exclusively from the City of Diego Lifeguards at their headquarters, located at 2581 Quivira Court.\n\nThe City of San Diego Fiesta Island Youth Camp is available for permitting through the Developed Regional Parks Permit Center. This campground is limited to organized non-profit youth groups. A non-profit youth group is a non-commercial organization and family camping is not permitted. The campground consists of 5 clusters with a maximum number of participants per cluster. Typical Check-In time is Friday at 3:00pm and Check-Out is Sunday at 12:00pm. For more information, please refer to the official Fiesta Island Youth Camp Rules and Regulations.\n\nFor parking, loading, and unloading information, see this map.\n\nGroups wishing to use the Youth Camp must complete a Facility and Park Use Permit Application. All applications for requested dates are accepted on a first come, first served basis, and will not be accepted more than 6 months before the requested reservation date(s). All applications must be submitted no later than 15 days prior to the requested dates.\n\nFiesta Island Youth Camp Lottery: Every Friday for reservation requests (6) six months out for groups requesting the same dates. Applications for lotteries must be submitted no later than the Thursday before.\n\nREFUNDS: There is no cancellation policy for the Youth Camp; fees are non-refundable; however fees can be credited to use for up to six months in advance for another date.\n\nFor information about how to obtain a permit, please contact the Developed Regional Perks Permit office at (619) 235-1169 or send the application directly via email to prpermitcenter@sandiego.gov."
