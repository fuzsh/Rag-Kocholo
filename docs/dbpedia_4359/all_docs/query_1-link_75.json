        "text": "Layne Murdoch/Getty Images\n\nFinally, the best story in Major League Baseball will get the big-screen treatment, as Josh Hamilton will be the center of a Casey Affleck film.\n\nDeadline reports producer Basil Iwanyk and Thunder Road Pictures are currently shopping a picture that is to be written and directed by Casey Affleck and will center around the triumphs and tribulations of one of the best baseball players around: Josh Hamilton.\n\nWell, that took a great deal longer than it should have. The only hope remaining is that it finds its way to the big screen without any major hiccups.\n\nThe Story\n\nRick Yeatts/Getty Images\n\nReally, there is hardly a better idea for a sports movie. As the report issues, Hamilton's tale is nearly a modern-day re-telling of Roy Hobbs in The Natural.\n\nFor those uninitiated, Hamilton was the No. 1-overall pick by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1999. At that time, the sky was the limit for a pure hitter with immense talent.\n\nInjuries lead him down a road that culminated in life-altering drug and alcohol abuse. An emaciated Hamilton would then build himself back into the strong ox that once amazed scouts.\n\nUSA Today has a great archived article of his past plight.\n\nHis road back to the majors has been both magical, as was seen in his 2008 Home Run Derby display, and tragic, as we witnessed in his February relapse.\n\nThe Need\n\nThe obvious notion in all of this is the human element. We all like to watch blockbuster movies about superheros and imagine a world wherein The Avengers is real.\n\nHamilton proves we can go above and beyond as humans and still surprise ourselves. The Rangers superstar has experienced the lowliest of lows and managed to right himself to capture the heavenly highs.\n\nThe producer explains it beautifully, via Deadline.\n\nI truly think this guy’s story is one of the most inspiring stories I’ve ever read. It’s also tailor-made for a movie: it has the mythic quality of The Natural, the faith-based angle of The Blind Side, and faith is a major part of our story, and the romance of Walk the Line.\n\nThe Movie\n\nHere comes the fun part—and one we can all participate in. What does this movie look like? As IMDb.com doesn't even have mention of the feature, it's far too early to know who will play heavy parts in the movie.\n\nHere are some fun guesses for a movie by the young director, who has only 2010's I'm Still Here and some shorts on his resume.\n\nJosh Hamilton\n\nThis one should be fun to cast, and it demands an actor who can manage a wide swath of emotions.\n\nSomething we stumbled upon is a link from CheezBurger which states Cole Hauser looks like the Rangers slugger. I see it.\n\nMost know Hauser from Good Will Hunting and Pitch Black, but I would like to hear who you see as Hamilton.\n\nIt would also help if the actor could drop 450-foot bombs over the fence.\n\nRon Washington\n\nThis is a tough one, because you need an actor who can capture one of the most emotional managers in the game.\n\nI say Samuel L. Jackson should play a man who everyone felt bad for at the tail end of the Rangers' World Series run. It would be nice to see this guy get a ring at some point, and Jackson would nail the volatile personality.\n\nNolan Ryan\n\nWho plays the consummate competitor who wants to win at any cost? I am open to any suggestions for the legendary fireballer.\n\nTerry O'Quinn, perhaps?\n\nOf course, there is a little-known law that Kevin Costner has to be in every damn baseball movie, so we have to cast him somewhere.\n\nAs for the rest, let the suggestions fly, Daily Swag readers. We need actors and the ballplayers they match up with."
