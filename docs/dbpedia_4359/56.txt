I have seen the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie too many times. I’m referring to the first movie, not the second movie which was Turbo Rangers, and not the third one which was trash. I can probably still quote the movie backwards and forwards, but that’s not what this article is about. I was sitting around one day and I thought about how many times the Power Rangers and others almost and actually died in this movie. So I’ve decided to do the math. My criteria for a near-death experience is either a near miss or if they survived something that could’ve easily killed them. I’ll have all the stats compiled at the end.

Bulk and Skull Skydiving

The first near-death comes right at the beginning of the movie as the Power Rangers with Bulk and Skull prepare to skydive for charity. After being told to “lead on” by Aisha they open the plane door and start to get cold feet. While they are still in the midst of hesitating Kimberly smugly suggests they put on some parachutes. If these guys had an extra ounce of confidence it would’ve been curtains for them.

Construction Worker Reaching for Egg

Getting regular electrocuted is bad, but getting purple alien electrocuted has to be worse right? We don’t get any confirmation about his condition later on so I’m just gonna assume he died.

Security Guards Shocked

When Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd pull up to the egg there are two security guards there and they get hit with the purple lighting too. As a kid I assumed they were knocked out but when you remember the fact that Lord Zedd has no skin you just know these dudes are dead.

Oozeman against Pillar

Now I wasn’t originally going to include the enemy deaths but then I thought about how their guts would be spilled everywhere so I changed my mind. Have you ever ripped an airhead in half? Now imagine it was wet. That’s what it looked like when Tommy kicked this Oozeman into the pillar from about 20 feet away. He screamed before he died.

Oozeman through a Crane Boom

This Oozeman gets straight up kicked through the boom of crane by Aisha. He also screams in midair before he makes contact. Aisha strikes a pose right after and says, “It’s gonna be one messy night!” The Power Rangers were going for the kill.

Double-Whammy on Oozeman

After a sequence that plays out like a beat-em-up game one Oozeman is left standing and Adam and Rocky decide to hit him with the “Double-Whammy” which consists of them kicking opposite sides of his head at the same time. The Oozeman’s head cartoonishly contorts as he dies what must have been a miserable death.

Oozeman through a Grate

Billy gets thrown off a ledge where he eats a pillar with his ribs. He then uses Dragon Stinger(steel cable?) to get back up there where he viciously launches the Oozeman off the same ledge onto a grate where he splatters.

Tommy Kicks Oozeman to Death

Tommy jumps down from up high and while floating in the air he repeatedly kicks an Oozeman in the chest before sending him flying into a pillar where he explodes and all that is left is the wet, airhead candy-like goop. Tommy was knocking the dust out this guy’s chest. Couldn’t the Rangers have just shot these guys?

Oozeman Smashed

This fight ends with the Rangers gathered together on a platform where Tommy’s sword corrals the remaining six Oozeman and drops a large metal container on them. This felt like a sick display of power and was a bit mocking as both sides had six, but only one group got squished. You ever step on a grape? That’s what this was like.

Zordon Dying

After the Massacre of the Oozemen the Power Rangers return to base and see Zordon dying on a bed of crystals. Why didn’t Ivan Ooze just finish the job? If he knew how ruthless the Rangers were he might have.

Kimberly Dropped from the Sky

During the fight with the Tengu where the powerless Rangers were getting whooped Kimberly gets snatched off the ground and is at least 30 feet in the air. When Dulcea comes through with the save Kimberly is released and she lands on her feet, no tuck and roll. If she had flipped or twisted on that fall that would’ve been it.

Ivan Ooze Explodes the Tengu

As Ivan Ooze oversees the digging up of his Ecto-Morphicons the Tengu Warriors make their return after failing to defeat the Power Rangers. After learning they were unsuccessful and that Dulcea is helping the Rangers he blows up these birdmen in a fit of rage. There are ten Tengu Warriors. Yeah.
