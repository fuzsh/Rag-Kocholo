Wee Troupie's fame was such that a book was written by Scottish football historian, David Potter, about his life.\n\nYoung Alex Troup was the star for the home side and he was certainly well liked and protected by the locals in this game. It was reported that Sunny Jim Young was assaulted with an umbrella by the lad's mother after the game for giving her diminutive youngster a rough time.\n\nFollowing this fine cup result Scots-Irish followers of the Celtic would be made even happier whith the news that Hibernian had knocked Rangers out of the cup at Easter Road.\n\nThe Glasgow Herald of this day reported the death of British rancher and mine-owner, William H. Benton in Mexico. The report states that Benton had stormed into the tent of the Mexican rebel leader Pancho Villa brandishing a revolver upon which Villa shot him. Later reports suggested a slightly different version of events.\n\nReview\n\nTeams\n\nFORFAR ATHLETIC:\n\nG Scott, Ferguson, C Scott, Bruce, Chapman, Leighton, Easson, Walker, Langlands, Alex Troup, James \"Jummer\" Petrie\n\nCELTIC:\n\nShaw; McGregor, Dodds; Young, Johnstone, Davidson; McAtee, Gallacher, McColl, McMenemy, Browning\n\nScorers:\n\nMcColl (3), McMenemy, Dodds (Pen)\n\nReferee: W.

There was a big crowd present totalling 8000, but a breaking in the weather half an hour before the start tended to keep back a good number. The Forfar players were no match for their more experienced opponents, though they were plucky, and at the same time showed a lot of fine play. Troup and Langlands constantly kept the Celtic defenders moving and as a matter of fact the Celtic goalkeeper had more to do in the first half than the Forfar goalkeeper.\n\nThe Celtic got their first goal as a result of a slip by C. Scott, who missed the ball altogether, and allowed McColl to walk through. The same player added a second point five minutes after the first, heading through from a pass by McAtee.\n\nThe second half was nearly all in favour of the Celtic, but the Forfar lads played up very pluckily, Troup again shining. This young lad played a fine game and time and again outwitted the Celtic defence.\n\nMcColl added a third goal thus performing the hat trick. A penalty kick against Leighton for bringing down Gallagher enabled Dodds to score a fourth goal, and McMenemy put on a fifth after giving a first rate exhibition of fast dribbling. The Celtic got their goals fairly easily and there was no excuse for the frequency with which they tripped the Forfar players.\n\nThere was a crowd of about 8000 present, the gate excluding stands, being £240.\n\nThe Glasgow Herald, Monday 23rd February, 1914.\n\nThe provincial side were outplayed from start to finish.\n\nMcColl scored twice in the first half and added a third in the second half, in which portion Dodds (from a penalty-kick) and McMenemy also scored."
