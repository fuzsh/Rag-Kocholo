        "text": "Jennifer’s scouting path started when she was three years old and her older brother Matthew joined Cub Scouts. Their parents became den leaders. Jennifer sat in the back and learned about nature, first aid, and a multitude of other topics. Jennifer later joined Girl Scouts where she went to Camp Ishnala, backpacked in the Olympic National Park, and earned the Silver Award. When she was 17, Jennifer’s older brother invited her to work at Bear Paw Scout Camp. Jennifer spent seven summers instructing scoutcraft, becoming a BSA lifeguard, helping in the health lodge, and directing the shooting sports and climbing departments. Jennifer joined her brother’s troop as an adult leader and became a member of The Order of the Arrow and received Vigil in 2010.\n\nJennifer graduated from Pulaski High School. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin – Stevens Point three years later with a bachelor’s degree in business administration with minors in accounting and music. During her years working a corporate job, Jennifer missed the outdoors and serving her community. Jennifer returned to school and became a paramedic. She volunteered as an Emergency Medical Responder in her hometown while working her first ambulance job in Mountain, WI, the township where she spent seven summers at camp. Jennifer’s career in EMS led her to further her education and earn a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Jennifer currently works full time in the Intensive Care Unit of a Level II Trauma Center and Comprehensive Stroke Center while still serving her community part time on the ambulance.\n\nIn her spare time, Jennifer likes to read, hike, backpack, hunt, ride bicycles, and eat all of the delicious foods on her adventures. Most recently was a trip to Vail, Colorado with her boyfriend Shea riding mountain bikes down ski slopes and exploring the continental divide.\n\nBorn and raised in Green Bay, Bernie Schlafke began his many adventures in scouting while a sixth grader at Howe School. Although his first weekend camping trip with St. John’s Troop 1044 (in someone’s potato field near Suring) was a rained-out disaster with a cold, wet sleeping bag, Bernie actually enjoyed his first week at Bear Paw Scout Camp (BPSC) the following summer. During the next four summers at Bear Paw as well as at home, he completed all the required and elective merit badges for Eagle Scout just before turning eighteen.\n\nOut of his love for Bear Paw and the North Woods, Bernie joined the staff for eight summers at BPSC, where he began his life-long career as an educator, teaching scouts about nature, ecology, and introducing them to low-impact camping skills. In 1985 he spent ten months traveling through Germany and Europe, and the two summer months as a dishwasher in a Bavarian country inn. Despite the joy of traveling and living abroad, he still missed camp and his staff buddies, and his longing for camp led to the composition that summer of his first song, “Bear Paw, My Home Away from Home,” which is still sung there today.\n\nLearning the basics of teaching at Bear Paw (KISMIF—“Keep it simple, make it fun”) and the UW-Madison, Bernie chose a career to serve as a public and private music and language educator, both in Wisconsin and Bavaria, that continues to this day. He is currently semi-retired and resides in the Madison area.\n\nI am a second-generation Scout and a sixth-generation leader for McDonald Companies. I was raised in Scouting, and I have taken lessons with me wherever I have gone. My goal for the future is to give back to both organizations that have helped to shape who I am today.\n\nI returned to the Green Bay area in 2012 with my wife Katie to start a family which has grown from two to five including three boys who are now in Scouting. Professionally, I am collaborating with a team of over 250 co-workers servicing the needs of customers and communities in seven states. In keeping with Scouting Cultural, we are only as good as the communities we help create and this will be our goal as we grow.\n\nThe Scouting Motto, Oath and Mind set have helped me serve in leadership roles in a number of organizations including roles at the Department of Defense, Rockwell, be a founding member of several non-profits and serve on a few non-profit boards in our community.\n\nI was gifted with time from many great leaders and mentors over the years, several of whom are also honored in the 50 Scouts we honor through this award. They have instilled in me the value of a lifelong education. I am passionate about developing resources for experiential education in our community, especially for the youth.\n\nI again appreciate the honor and look forward to paying forward the time to Scouts in our community.\n\nMichael (Mike) Mailand, eldest son of Marian and Raymond Mailand, joined Cub Scouts when he was 8 years old in 1967 in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. His 3 brothers followed suit into scouting making it a family affair. In 1970, he became a Boy Scout in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin as a member of troop 26. Mike attended his first of many National Jamboree’s in 1973 and was also inducted into the Order of the Arrow – Chequah Lodge. From 1973 to 1975, he served as the Order of the Arrow Chapter Chief and was a member of the Awase Lodge Merger Committee. In 1975, Mike became an Order of the Arrow Brotherhood member and received the Ad Altare Dei religious award. He served as the Contingent Senior Patrol Leader for the Scottish Jamborette the following year and had the opportunity to celebrate his 16th birthday in Europe.\n\n1977 was a big year for Mike; he became an Eagle Scout after completing an emergency preparedness project and developing resources in Door County, Wisconsin, received Vigil Honors of the Order of the Arrow Vigil and served on the National Jamboree staff. In the coming years, he was the Lodge Chief for the Order of the Arrow (1978-1979) and received the Bronze Pelican religious award (1982).\n\nIn 1987, Mike married Cub Scout Leader Melanie Gump having met her through scouting. They welcomed their first daughter, Deb, and Mike received his Silver Beaver in 1988. Mike served as staff for the National Jamborees in 1981, 1985, and 1989. He made it home from the Jamboree just in time to be present for the birth of his second daughter, Becca, after the 1989 Jamboree.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, he continued his Scouting activities, including yearly Okpik events, a winter camping training program that he began in 1980 with David Hirn, but prioritized his young family. As he had been all along, Mike continued in office supply sales after learning the ropes from his dad via the family business. He coached his daughters in soccer and assisted his wife with Girl Scouts taking the troop on backpacking adventures.\n\nBy the time his daughters were in middle school, Mike ramped up his scouting activities once again. In 2000, 2004, 2005, and 2007, he served on Wood Badge staff. He became the Wood Badge course director in 2008, and Mike also spent two years as the course director for National Youth Leadership Training. In 2010, he was a National Jamboree Scoutmaster. In 2013 and 2017, he returned to the National Jamboree; this time as the Counsel Contingent Leader and began serving as the Lodge Advisor for Order of the Arrow. Mike also served as the 2019 World Jamboree USA Contingent Leader.\n\nMore recently, Mike was awarded the Pillars Volunteer of the Year and Fox Valley Janet Berry Volunteer of the year in 2021 for his dedication to the homeless population throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and his commitment to scouting. In 2023, Mike served as the National Jamboree Bay Lakes and Samoset Council Contingent Leader.\n\nCurrently, his scouting titles include Order of the Arrow Lodge Advisor, the Jamboree Committee Chair, member of the Bay Lakes Council Program Committee, member of the Bay Lakes Council Winter Programs, and Arctic Adventure Chair (17 years).\n\nDisclaimer: This history of Mike’s time in Scouting is likely incomplete; Mike Mailand has done more for Scouting over the past 56 years than one could possibly remember.\n\nDavid graduated from Kingsford High School in 1966 and enrolled in Northern Michigan University (NMU) under the “Right to Try” program. Unfortunately, he was not a motivated scholar, subsequently finding himself on the Dean’s List of former students after just one semester. David spent the next year digging holes and climbing power poles for M. J. Electric. The job was hard but rewarding and set the stage for a lifelong interest in the transmission and distribution of electricity. He reapplied to NMU in 1968 and was granted “conditional” readmission. With the fear of academic failure fresh in his mind David excelled in the classroom and eventually transferred to Michigan Technological University (MTU) for the study of electrical engineering, graduating Magna Cum Laude in 1972.\n\nDavid began his professional career immediately after graduation working for Wisconsin Public Service as a Division Engineer. He rejoined M. J. Electric in 1973 as a Project Engineer in the Substation Division. In 1975, he formed the Underground Power & Communications Division. In 1978 David was promoted to Vice President of the Utility Division where he was responsible for M. J. Electric’s Transmission, Distribution, Substation, and Underground operations. In 1980 David was named Vice President of Manufacturing; in 1985 he was elected Executive Vice President; and in 1990 President/CEO. In 1992 he purchased a majority of the company’s stock.\n\nUnder David’s leadership, M. J. Electric grew to one of the nation’s largest electrical construction companies – ranked 8th on Engineering News Record’s list of 600 top specialty contractors; one of North America’s largest manufacturers of snow and ice control equipment through its BOSS Snowplow product line; and the largest control and relay panel manufacturer in the nation – Systems Control. David sold M. J. Electric to Exelon Infrastructure Services in 2000 (eventually becoming part of Quanta Services); The BOSS Snowplow to the Toro Company in 2014, and Systems Control to Comvest Partners in 2018. David takes pride in knowing these businesses continue to thrive and employ a combined total of nearly 3,000 people.\n\nIn addition to serving on numerous electrical industry boards and committees David was a founding member of the Electri’21 Council, a construction industry “think tank,” where he was chairman of the Committee on the Future of the Electrical Construction Industry; and a founding member of the Electrical Construction Roundtable. He also served as a guest lecturer on Strategic Market Planning at the University of Wisconsin’s Management Institute, and lectured on How to Run a Successful Construction Business at University of Wisconsin’s School of Construction Administration.\n\nDavid is a former member of the Executive Advisory Board of the Pine Mountain Music Festival; the Federal Reserve’s Committee on Small Business and Agriculture; the First National Bank of Iron Mountain Board of Directors; the Michigan Tech Fund Board of Directors; the MTU Generations of Discovery Campaign Committee; the U.P. Construction Labor-Management Council; Friends of Handicapped People, an organization dedicated to the financial support of Special Olympics in the Central Upper Peninsula; and the Interlochen Arts Academy Presidents Council. In 2001, David was appointed to the Michigan Technological University Board of Control, serving two terms as Board Chair. In 2009 he was awarded an Honorary PhD by the MTU School of Business and Economics.\n\nHe holds appointments to Michigan Technological University’s Electrical Engineering Academy; the MTU School of Business and Economics Academy; the Order of the Engineer; and currently serves on the Michigan Technological University College of Business Advisory Council and the Flagship Campaign Executive Committee.\n\nDavid has received several awards and honors including: the Hiawathaland Council Winthrop Rockefeller Fund Raising Award; the University of Wisconsin Lifetime Achievement Award in Construction; a Commendation Medal from the Cambodian Education Ministry for contributions to educational infrastructure in the Kingdom of Cambodia; the Michigan Special Olympics Family of the Year Award; and selection as the Upper Peninsula Business Person of the Year in 2015.\n\nDavid’s interests include hiking, biking, rollerblading, skiing, driving a race car, and most recently the startup of a new business venture: Thu Brulé Skin Care with his wife Thu.\n\nJeremy grew up in Suamico, WI, and became a Scout in Troop 1033 where his father, Jack, was his Scoutmaster and mentor throughout his early years in Boy Scouts. He earned the Eagle Scout rank in 1997 and held various positions of increased responsibility over the years such as Scout Master, Ceremony Team Member and Leader, Ordeal Master, and Conference Chief, to name a few. When Jeremy graduated from Bay Port High School in 1997, he continued with Boy Scouts taking leadership positions within the troop and earned the Vigil Honor in the Order of the Arrow in 1998.\n\nIn parallel and in complement of his work with Boy Scouts, Jeremy also is an avid sportsman, waterfowl hunter, and hunter safety instructor. He has been a Wisconsin Safety Instructor since graduating from his own hunter safety class at 12 years old and has been assisting in classes in the Green Bay area, as well as Bear Paw Scout Camp, for over 30 years. He was one of the team members who started the Learn to Hunt Waterfowl program in the state over 20 years ago, in partnership with the Wisconsin Waterfowl Association (WWA) and the Department of Natural Resources, and still acts as a mentor for youth and inexperienced hunters in the art and hobby of waterfowl hunting. Jeremy also has served on the board of the WWA for 16 years; a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of Wisconsin’s waterfowl and wetland resources through habitat restoration, education, and being a voice in legislation and regulation.\n\nJeremy led fundraising and took part in the construction of the Jack Van Sistine Educational Building for the Shooting Sports program at Bear Paw Scout Camp in Mountain, WI; an endeavor that was started by his late father, Jack, who sadly passed away in 2017. Jeremy can be found donating many days and weekends throughout the year at Bear Paw Scout Camp, helping with various building and camp projects with Ranger Andy. Jeremy continues to serve as a committee member for Crew 9061 and is a Ceremonies Advisor for the Muk Chapter of the Order of the Arrow, attending conferences and ceremonies throughout the year.\n\nFor Jeremy, being a Boy Scout is not something he does occasionally, it is who he is at his very core and can be seen through his countless hours of volunteer time and his daily service to others. Those who are blessed to know Jeremy (and you should now that he is of the 50 Scouts you should know) will agree he is willing to help anyone, at any time. He has been and continues to be a great mentor, leader, and most of all a friend to many throughout his years in scouting.\n\nJeremy resides in the Green Bay area with his wife and their three children.\n\nA former U.S. congressman and Michigan state representative, Bart Stupak is uniquely positioned to provide clients with well-informed, extensive counsel based on a thorough knowledge of the energy, healthcare, telecommunications, and international trade industries, and their related legislation. Bart currently focuses his practice on healthcare system financial restructuring and has played key roles in the reformation of two systems valued at more than $50 million and $100 million, respectively.\n\nAs congressman to Michigan’s First Congressional District for 18 years, Bart developed a deep understanding of issues that directly affected his constituents.\n\nBart served on the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee. He was involved with several related subcommittees, including the Health, Energy and the Environment, Communications, Technology and the Internet, Consumer Protection, and Commerce and Trade Subcommittees. He chaired the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, and oversaw investigations into physical and cybersecurity breaches at U.S. nuclear labs, food and drug safety matters, and insurance company policy rescissions. He played a critical role in the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010. He also served on the Armed Services, Government Reform, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committees.\n\nBart began his career in public service as a police officer in Escanaba, Michigan. He continued his career in law enforcement as a Michigan State police trooper, until he was medically retired because of an injury sustained in the line of duty. He also served in the Michigan House of Representatives. The lessons I learned while earning my Eagle Scout award have served me well through my personal, professional, and legislative careers. Whether it was arguing a legal matter before a skeptical judge or weathering a political storm, staying true to the Boy Scout Law sustained me. The Scout Law is still applicable today as it was in 1967 when I received my Eagle Scout Award.\n\nA Boy Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean and Reverent has withstood the test of time. By allowing these 12 Boy Scout characteristics to serve as your foundation throughout life you can overcome any obstacle, tragedy, and personal sacrifice.\n\nScouting challenges you to become a leader and an active participant in our democracy starting with Citizenship in the Home, Community, and Nation. Be Prepared to become a better citizen, spouse, father, and a leader in our great Nation through Scouting.\n\nBrad’s passion for scouting started in Cub Scouts where his mom was his Den Leader and Dad was the committee chair of Pack 3836. It was an easy choice to join since his brother and role model, Chris, was already a Boy Scout at that time. When he was able, he became a Boy Scout in Troop 830. Boy Scouts was fun and was an amazing way to learn new skills and be active in the outdoors. Advancement and merit badges were a fun way to expand his knowledge and helped him grow as a person. Living the Scout Oath and Law became second nature. He was elected to and earned Brotherhood in the Order of the Arrow. At the age of 16, he earned his Eagle Scout Award, following in his brother’s footsteps. He stayed active in the troop helping and teaching others all while juggling school, a job, sports and a girlfriend while he moved up through the ranks and earned his Eagle. It was at this time that he realized that he enjoyed mentoring younger Scouts.\n\nAfter attending UW Platteville, getting married and having kids of his own, he knew he wanted to be involved in Scouts to make a good experience for all.\n\nBrad knew being a scout leader was what he wanted to do to give back to the scouting community, so Brad and his son, TJ, joined the Lions program. Brad and his co-den leader excelled at making den meetings fun for the boys. They organized science experiments, fishing, camping and cooking as they grew.\n\nWhen it was time for TJ to cross into Scouts BSA, Brad knew he wanted to stay involved in the program. After joining as an Assistant Scoutmaster, he ran the troop’s largest fundraiser, with record success. He has now taken over as Scoutmaster for Troop 762, which has a linked girls Troop, 6762. He continues to encourage the Scouts BSA ideals with the Scouts and loves to get “dirty” with them, showing them that we are all here to make a fun and rewarding scouting experience.\n\nHis time commitment to his troop, while maintaining a very demanding job and a busy home life, is second to none. When he’s not Scouting, he also coaches TJ’s baseball team, his daughter’s mountain bike team and also occasionally helps his wife and daughter with their Girl Scout events and activities.\n\nJon speaks highly of his experiences in scouts as a kid and how the adults involved shaped the man he has grown to be. He has taken on the Scout slogan to do a good turn daily and shows others what living the Scout Oath and Law means through his actions.\n\nAfter graduating from college, he set out to start a FIRST robotics program in Oshkosh to help students gain experience in real-world engineering and grow their knowledge of STEM careers. He co-founded Wave Robotics in 2008 in Oshkosh and spent a decade volunteering thousands of hours and mentoring hundreds of high school students through the program. Jon is a patient mentor who makes great connections with the students he works with. He has made a lasting impact on many team members. Even now, many of his former Wave students call him for advice and mentorship as adults. In 2018 he took a step back from Wave Robotics in order to become more involved in FIRST Lego League (a feeder program for Wave Robotics) because his own children needed a coach for their team. With the younger students, he continued to teach them valuable STEM skills and empower them to see themselves as leaders. With his support, the Lego League team won second place in the Global Innovation Awards for their innovation project in 2022.\n\nJon has been active in scouting in Oshkosh since his children were first able to join Scouts BSA. He served as Assistant Cubmaster in 2018 for Pack 3615 and then as Cubmaster from 2019-2022. Even through Covid, he worked hard to find creative ways to keep scouting accessible to his pack and to keep scouts engaged in the program. He planned geocaching outings, outdoor meetings, and truly showed that where there is a will, there is a way. He is the first to volunteer to help another family, even opening up his own basement to teach families how to make a Pinewood Derby car. He is currently the Charter Org Rep for Troop 641/6641. Jon is fully committed to giving scouts the best possible scouting experience. As a merit badge counselor, you can often find him teaching scouts how to care for their bikes or how to improve their camping skills. He is the first to volunteer to find funding so that any Scout who wants to attend summer camp can. Jon attends summer camp each summer and shows scouts that service is a way of life. He has built many platform tents and fixed broken things at Gardner Dam throughout the years. This summer at Camp Tesomas he spent time fixing dock boards so that they were safe for scouts and repairing the water slide. Jon is a kind of scout leader who always has time to help. One of his Scouts this year said he couldn’t bring a bike to camp because he had never learned how to ride on 2 wheels. Jon spent free time every day teaching him until he was a confident cyclist by the end of the week. Also at camp this year a Scout gave up on getting his swimming merit badge because he didn’t feel he could do the survival float. Jon went down to the lake with him during free time and coached him. Jon stood in the water cheering this scout on and gave him the confidence to complete the float and get his merit badge. Jon truly cares about his scouts and wants them to learn not only the valuable Scouting skills, but how these skills and Scout Oath and Law can turn them into caring adults who truly impact the lives of those around them.\n\nJon not only excels in his volunteer work, but also in his career. He is the Vice President of Business Transformation at FTI and leads his team as they work on new business opportunities.\n\nJon is the epitome of living a life guided by the Scout Oath and Law with a focus on helping others. He is selfless with his time and truly strives to mentor young people to be the best that they can be.\n\nMy name is Specialist Coleman LaBlanc from Green Bay WI and I graduated from Preble High School in 2022.

He had participated in the first National Youth Leadership Training Pack and Paddle course and later went on to be a staff for the course. While he was active in scouting, Coleman enjoyed attending World Jamboree, National Jamboree, and the Boundary Waters. Coleman credits his time in scouting with providing him with the leadership skills and experiences necessary for him to be successful in his current mission with the Army and his future goals in college and his personal life.\n\nA native of Seymour, Wisconsin, Capt. David Burke graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a Bachelor of Arts Degree. After completing his Masters in 1997, he attended and received his Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from Columbia University in the City of New York in 2003. He completed his final year of doctoral training at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego.\n\nUpon completion of his training, Capt. Burke stayed at the NMCSD as a staff member for one year before being assigned to the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76) as the ship’s first psychologist in 2004. He transited the horn of South America on the ship’s maiden voyage and served through the Reagan’s first extended gulf deployment in 2006. After leaving the USS Reagan, Capt. Burke reported to the U.S. Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy where he served as the SARP Director and the Department Head for Mental Health from 2006-2009. During his tour, Capt. Burke deployed to fill a combat replacement at Al Taqqadum Iraq with the 2nd Medical Battalion as an Individual Augment.\n\nIn July of 2009, Capt. Burke reported to the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command and was assigned as the psychologist for the Special Operations Schoolhouse. At this command, he was instrumental in setting up the mental health evaluation within the Assessment and Selection process for Special Operators and in defining the mental health role during the 6-month training pipeline. In August of 2011, Capt. Burke reported to the James F. Lovell Federal Health Care Center where he served as the Division Officer for outpatient mental health at the first joint DoD/VA facility. During his tour at Lovell, Capt. Burke deployed with the 1st Medical Battalion out of Camp Pendleton and served as the Officer in Charge of the Mental Health Clinic at Camp Leatherneck, Afghanistan (Jan12-Aug12).\n\nCapt. Burke was selected for DUIN’s and from September 2013 to September 2014 attended a Harvard Fellowship in Pediatric Psychology at Boston Children’s Hospital to fill a much needed role in Japan. Capt. Burke served a utilization tour at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, Japan where he served as the Department Head for the Educational and Developmental Intervention Service (EDIS) and then as the Director for Public Health from 2014-2017. Capt. Burke reported to the U.S. Naval Hospital, Okinawa and served as the Director for Mental Health and Competent Medical Authority for Mental Health for all forces on Okinawa from 2017-2020.

Burke is a diplomat of the American Board of Professional Psychology. His awards include the Meritorious Service Medal (three awards), the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal (three awards) and the Navy Achievement Medal.\n\nDaniel Diederich, son of Raymond and Debra Diederich, is a former Scoutmaster and a 2000 Eagle Scout from Troop 1030 and previously Pack 4030. To this day, he spends time giving back to his troop. Upon turning 18, he immediately became an adult volunteer to his troop, after all, it is an easy way to continue to hang out with friends made while Scouting. As years passed, he developed connections with even more Scouts, even if the role style changed from friend to older brother to mentor. When the troop had difficulty with its charter, he took it upon himself to move the charter to his business. From there, he has doubled down on the troop, providing a trailer and campsite to it. As committee chairman and treasurer, he is integral in managing the troop.\n\nOutside of Scouting, Daniel is also busy. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin- Madison in 2004, he became the manager of Diederich Farm, De Pere, WI. Within 4 years he became an owner and set off growing the business from 100 to 550 milking cows. Diederich Farm is one of the most technologically advanced dairies in the U.S. and a pioneer of robotic milking. The farm is considered a trailblazer in the industry and pushes the limits of what tech on farms can do. It isn’t just about business and tech though, the farm is also a leader in environmentalism. They practice conservation no-till and cover crop farming, run a separate 500-acre intensive rotation pasture farm to raise young stock, and are integral in farmer-to-farmer learning sessions. Diederich Farm has been recognized with multiple environmental stewardship awards from organizations ranging from New Water to Fox-Wolf Watershed Alliance to Farm Bureau.\n\nWith his parent’s insistence, he also decided to put his business training to further use in the industry and ran for his first cooperative board of directorship in 2008. Not only was he elected but he was also voted chairman of the board. From there, he oversaw the merger of this co-op with two other co-ops to form Eastern WI DHIC and was then elected to the board of the nation’s largest milk testing cooperative — AgSource. There, again, no time was wasted being elected chairman within three years. This role also placed him on the board for a larger holding cooperative, Cooperative Resources International (CRI) in 2014. In 2016, he earned a graduate level certificate in cooperative governance. At CRI he served as secretary until a combination was made to form URUS Holdings in 2018, a deal he was instrumental in putting together. This revolutionary combination of cooperative and privately held holding companies created the world’s largest cattle breeding center, herd management software and colostrum producer among other holdings. Naturally, Daniel now sits on URUS’s board of directors and helps oversee their global operations. URUS continues to grow having since purchased the world’s largest cattle embryo transfer company among others. Daniel is respected for his financial acumen, technology prowess and way of looking at the industry.\n\nDaniel married Sarah in 2011 and they welcomed their daughter, Adelaide, in 2021.\n\nNever satisfied with the status quo, Daniel is an agent for change and growth. Whether it be personal or business he challenges those around him to be the best.\n\nMydasia Zipperer is a founding member and Eagle Scout of Troop 6925 in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. Her Eagle Project consisted of leading the construction and raising of bat houses along with an educational sign at Camp Sinawa, a Historic Boy Scout Camp in Manitowoc County.

In addition, Van Straten is also the recipient of the prestigious Gold Award from Girl Scouts of the USA. Having both awards as a female now places Van Straten in an even more elite group nationally.\n\nAs part of her Eagle project, Van Straten wrote a children’s book, Parker’s Path, published by Ephraim Publishing and printed by Worzalla Publishing, the same printer for books like Oprah, Marvel, National Geographic, and the Diary of a Wimpy Kids series. In addition to Van Straten’s book, she has created a curriculum for elementary school-aged children, grades 1-4. The book and curriculum are intended to promote empathy awareness at a time when empathy development is reduced with less in-person interactions and increased use of screens and technology.\n\nThrough extensive fundraising including a grant by The Pollination Project, more than $11,000 in funds and services were raised. As a result, 4,000 copies of Parker’s Path and curriculum were distributed for free to Wisconsin schools, libraries, scouting troops, and not-for-profit organizations supporting youth, in collaboration with St. Norbert College’s Cassandra Voss Center initiatives. Books were also distributed in MN, CA, NY, and CO to reach a total of 110 school districts representing 400 schools and their 1st- 4th grade students as well as additional troops, Boys & Girls Clubs, and county libraries. To support online learning during COVID-19, Van Straten also created a video version of her book, along with the curriculum, for area school districts that were teaching either fully or partially online.\n\nThis was Van Straten’s second book. Her first published book, Mary’s Heart, is on kindness, and over 1,000 copies of this book and curriculum were previously distributed as part of her Girl Scout Gold Award and over $6,000 in funds and services were also raised, for a total of over $17,000 in funds and services raised by Van Straten, to-date.\n\nAccording to Van Straten, “while learning science along with math, language arts, and the other components of the Common Core have been important in my life, one of my other important educations has been outside of the classroom through Scouting. The character, leadership, courage, and emergency preparedness skills I have learned through Scouts BSA offer me what I call my ‘Common More,’ — character, social, and emotional learning (SEL) skills that will be in my toolkit for life. I am also pleased to have had an Eagle Project where I can help spread another important life skill, empathy, to even more youth.”\n\nVan Straten is currently a Junior psychology major at Yale University where she conducts research at the Yale School of Medicine at its Center for Emotional Intelligence, Child Study Center, related to the Social and Emotional Learning Observation Checklist for elementary schools (SELOC-ES). Here she helps refine discrete SEL pedagogies, codes classroom observation footage from around the nation in participating classrooms, and catalogs discrete SEL pedagogy examples for the SELOC-ES training. It is Van Straten’s intention to pursue her doctorate in child psychology. She is also contemplating attending law school to better refine her advocacy skills, gain knowledge and a better appreciation of education law and public policy, and best position herself to join the national conversation on U.S. education to bring it to a level where social and emotional intelligence training and learning is commonplace.\n\nDarrel Wittmann has been involved in Scouting for over 55 years.
