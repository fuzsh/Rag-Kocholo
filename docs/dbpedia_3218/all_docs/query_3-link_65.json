        "text": "ROTHERHAM PLAYERS RETURN\n\nJanuary 3, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nEverton Changes\n\nYorkshire Side is Now Recovering From Crop of Injuries\n\nRanger’s Notes\n\nEverton are forced to make one change in the team to meet Rotherham at the Millmoor ground on Saturday. Tom Jones the centre half, is suffering from the prevalent complaint –pulled muscle and is unable to play. His place will be taken by Maurice Lindley, the Yorkshireman, whose height and reach should be a valuable asset. He is a sturdy man to have on your side. Eglington has fully recovered from his strain. Rotherham United team will be the same as that which defeated Doncaster so decisively at Doncaster last Saturday. This means that there will be three newcomers compared with the side which drew 3-3 at Goodison Park early in September after twice being in arrears, and once two goals down. Only the half-back line remains unchanged. Teams; - Everton; Leyland; Clinton, Lindsay; Donovan, Lindley, Farrell; McNamara, Fielding, Hickson, Parker, Eglington. Rotherham United; Quairney; Selkirk, Williams (H.); Edwards, Gibson, Rawson, Grainger; Williams (D.), Shaw, Guest, Tomlinson.\n\nEverton Reserves; to meet West Bromwich Albion at Goodison Park (2-30) is; O’Neill; Saunders, Rankin; Birch, Woods, Grant; Harris, Lello, Lewis, Cummins, Buckle.\n\nALEC TROUP DEAD\n\nJanuary 3, 1952. Aberdeen Evening Express\n\nAlec Troup the former Scottish international left winger who played for Forfar Athletic, Dundee ad Everton, died in his sleep at his home in Forfar yesterday. He was fifty-six. Troup was capped for Scotland against England in 1920 and again in Ireland in 1921 and 1922. He was also capped for the Scottish League against the Irish League in 1921 and 1922.\n\n• Thanks to Kjell Hanssen for this\n\nALEC TROUP DEAD\n\nJanuary 3, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nRanager’s Notes\n\nI regret to announced the death of Alec Troup the former Everton and Scottish international outside left, who died yesterday. Troup was only a little man, but big in football ability, it was Troup who provided the centre which enabled Dixie Dean to score big record breaking 60th goal to the season. The little Scott joined Everton in January 1923 and left to rejoin his old club, Dundee in March 1930. He made 240 appearances for Everton and gained a League championship medal in the season 1927-28. Troup had a shot business in Forfar.\n\nYORKSHIRE AGAIN!\n\nJanuary 4, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nRanger’s Notes\n\nRotherham were something of a revelation when they were at Goodison Park last September. Few people expected the newly promoted Third Division side to put up much of a show in the higher sphere yet for a time they headed the league table, and even to-day are only a couple of points behind their Sheffield Wednesday neighbours. Rotherham have not the resource or wealthier clubs so that a heavy crop of injuries over the Christmas holidays took rather a big toll. Tomorrow, however they will be nearer their normal strength and Everton will by no means have things all their own way. Enforced changes in the forward line recently, have slowed down Rotherham’s rate of scoring which at one period was well ahead of any other Second Division side. Dynamite Dooley has since put Sheffield Wednesday in the lead but Dooley do not spring up every day – more’s the pity. A few more of Dooley’s stand would give us still greater thrills each week. After their spell of five away games without defeat, Everton lost the pattern as soon as they started their December trips to Yorkshire clubs. Successive visits to Barnsley, Sheffield Wednesday and Doncaster added nothing to their points total. Here’s hoping that tomorrow’s trip to Yorkshire will help to redress the adverse balance. Teams; - Everton; Leyland; Clinton, Lindsay; Donovan, Lindley, Farrell; McNamara, Fielding, Hickson, Parker, Eglington. Rotherham United; Quairney; Selkirk, Williams (H.); Edwards, Gibson, Rawson, Grainger; Williams (D.), Shaw, Guest, Tomlinson.\n\nLAST TRIBUTE TO ALEC TROUP\n\nJanuary 5, 1952 Dundee Courier\n\nThe funeral of Alex Troup, former Forfar Athletic, Dundee, Everton and Scottish international footballer, took place to Forfar Cemetery yesterday afternoon. In addition to the representatives gathering of townsmen there was also a number of former team mates. Services at the house and cemetery were the Rev D.M. Bell. Pallbearers were;- James Troup (brother), George Taylor (son-in-law), James Troup jun (Newhew), John Troup (nephew), G. Kydd (brother-in-law), D. Stranchan (brother-in-law), T. Ferrier (brother-in-law), and A. Saddler. Among the mourners were David McLean, J. Thomson, D. Raitt –all ex-Dundee and Everton; W. Cook, D. Thomson, Sam Irving, T. McCulloch, -Dundee; Geo Henderson, ex-Forfar Athletic, Dundee and Rangers; D. Piggott, Angus Junior League; J. Steven, Forfar Athletic supporters Club; W. Dear, Forfar West End; C. Kennedy, Forfar East End; J. Binney, Forfar Celtic, and Geo. Shepherd, former trainer Forfar Athletic. Included in the floral tributes were wreaths from Dundee and Everton clubs.\n\n• Thanks to Kjell Hanssen for this.\n\nROTHERHAM 1 EVERTON 1\n\nJanuary 7, 1952. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nYorkshire Relish\n\nThey breed them tough at Rotherham, where Hickson’s headed goal two minutes from the end snatched a point for Everton when none seemed likely. The small, but game Rotherham reserve outside right White, who fell outside the field of play after collision with Lindsay, cut his head (possibly against the iron enclosure rails) so badly he had four stitches in the wound before coming back in the second half to finish the game. Afterwards he collapsed when about to go home by taxi and when Everton left Rotherham long after the match he was still unconscious in the dressing room. After spending some time in hospital on Saturday he was well enough to be taken home. The voice behind the public address system before the match either had a short memory or a flair for the chronic. He asked Rotherham to give Everton a real Yorkshire welcome. Though it was not another Doncaster, there were times when it came dangerously close. When one considers that Quairney in goal was having his Second Division 2 match. White his third and McGoldrick his fourth and that Rotherham despite White’s long absence, were able to lead 1-0 until two minutes from the end, the result was no special commendation of Everton. The extenuating circumstances for them were that they did get the goal they wanted and that so many of the referee’s hairbreadth decisions went in Rotherham’s favour.\n\nBad Decision\n\nRotherham’s penalty was a bad decision in my view. Farrell and Lindley collided when Shaw was in no position to get the ball and whatever handling there was must have been unintentional. Leyland made a splendid save of Guest’s shot from the penalty spot, but the little man followed up so quickly there was no chance of the goalkeeper saving the rebound shot. Oddly when Parker was brought down near the end the referee gave an indirect free kick and not a penalty. From this Eglington crossed the ball for Hickson to score with a solidity hit header. There were times when the Rotherham defence was wide open but Everton finished badly and unluckily. Hickson clean through did not score, Fielding after a long right wing dash beat Quairney and found the ball wide of the far post by inches. Then Hickson shot which was on the point of crossing the line was miraculously turned to safety by a defender. Rotherham fought hard and with a full complement all through would probably have won. In Guest, a player picked up in War years almost by accident, they have a great general in Grainger an inspired wingmen. Everton are losing they way because they are taking the chances they work hard to produce. Parker had a good match and Fielding a good first half, but the finishing was never sufficiently punishing. Maurice Lindley again filled the role of deputy with distinction – Shaw was rarely seen –and Donovan vied with Rawson for wing half honours. This was the best Leyland I have seen this season –a perfect display with many fine saves and only that unlucky Guest goal to blemish it. Facilities at Rotherham are primitive by comparison with Goodison Park, but the team’s the thing, and Manager Reg Freeman is thoroughly up-to-date in that department. Meanwhile Rotherham ground is under reconstruction against the possibility of Division 1. “Of course we shan’t live to see it” says seventy five year old vice chairman John Watts. To which his eight-one year old brother, the chairman replies “You speak for yourself.”\n\nTHREE FOR BUCKLE\n\nJanuary 7, 1952. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nEverton Res 6, W.B.A 1\n\nOne of the outstanding players in Everton’s Central League victory over West Bromnwich Albion at Goodison Park on Saturday was Buckle, who scored three goals. Lello back again in the forward line, had a good match as did O’Neill in goal Everton’s other marksmen were Lello, Lewis and Cummins. McCall scored Albion’s goal.\n\n• Marlborough 0, Everton “B” 3\n\nINDIFFERENT FINISHING\n\nJanuary 7, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nBy Contact\n\nEverton are all feed up for their cup-tie at Leyton Orient. This match will be treated as any other and in view of Everton’s consistent form in away games the outlook is hopeful even if Leyton’s seven goals on Saturday creates a little apprehension. Everton can win this and many other games if they will only use the chances they build so carefully for themselves. The story of indifferent finishing was true, also Rotherham in the League game on Saturday; indeed had the goalkeeping been ordinary and the shooting a bit better it could have been nearer 4-4 than 1-1. Hickson (twice), Fielding, Eglington and others all had chances to score, but somehow the ball would not behave en route to goal and when Hickson did get on target there was a Rotherham foot to turn it to safety. Everton should never have been involved in a penalty –the decision was a bad one. I thought –and when Leyland made his best of many saves from Guest it seemed like rough justice. Only Guest anticipation of a save prompted him to follow up and do his job at the second attempt. Hickson’s deliberately headed goal two minutes from the end was a surprising solace to his side who had not only looked like losing, but had been faced for a good 20 minutes by a Rotherham only at 10-man strength. White, who cut his head badly in collision with Lindsay came back and performed gallantly and I am glad to say he recovered in hospital after the match, after collapsing on the way home. Rotherham astutely managed by Reg Freeman, are an even tougher proposition at Rotherham than on away grounds. There were times when the match developed as the one against Doncaster did. It was hard and interesting football on a heavy pitch, but both attacks made too many openings for anyone to say that the defences played really well. Yet Donovan, Lindley and Leyland were always good to watch.\n\nLEYTON ORIENT TEAM\n\nJanuary 9, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nRanger’s Notes\n\nLeyton Orient, home to Everton in a game which is expected to set up new attendance figures at the Brisbane Road ground make one change from the side which over-whelmed Colchester 7-0 on Saturday. This is the return of Don Woan, the former Liverpool winger at outside right. Woan is now fit again after tonsillitis. Banner has also recovered from a knee injury. Leyton Orient; Wolton; Evans, Banner; Blizzard, Aldous, Deverall; Woan, Pacey, Rees, Brown, Blatchford.\n\nEVERTON CO-OPTION\n\nJanuary 9, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nRanger’s Notes\n\nAt last night’s Everton meeting, Mr. Cyril E. Balmforth, a former chairman of the Everton-Shareholders Association, and a vice president, this year, was co-opted to the board of the club. He takes over the unexpired term of the late Mr. Fred Lake, amounting to two and a half years. Mr. Balmforth will now have to relinquish his official connection with the shareholders’ Association of which he was one of the founder members. He is a shareholder of long standing. As a boy he played for St. Francis Xavier, but joined the Army in the first World War after leaving school. He attained the rank of captain in the 5th King’s Liverpool Regiment gaining the M.C at Ypres in 1917. In the last war he was a major in the Wallasey Home Guard. By profession he is a chartered account in business in Liverpool and resides at Wallasey. Mr. Balmforth will be a decided acquisition to the Everton directorate. He has been a keen follower of football all his life, and will bring much business acumen and a flair for administration to the board.\n\n“SOONER THE BETTER” –CLIFF BRITTON\n\nJanuary 10, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nWhen I talked, a fortnight ago, with Everton manager, Cliff Britton, over what has come to be known as Everton’s five-year plan for promotion to Division 1, he assured me that a five year plan had never entered his head. “My idea,” he said is to return to Division 1 as and when we can, and the sooner the better.”\n\nMr. Harold Williams whose resignation from the Everton board is front page news this morning has probably seen as much of Everton “in action” as anyone over the past twenty-five years. He followed them first home and away, as one of those supporters to whom no journey is too long if an Everton match was at the end of it. He joined the board four years ago and had a further year to severe before seeking re-election.\n\nThe New Order\n\nOnly in comparatively recent years have Everton have a manager. Mr. Theo Kelly was appointed secretary-manager soon after the war, after many years as secretary and Mr. Britton was appointed manager and later manager-in-chief, or secretary-Manager. The view of the late Mr. W.C. Cuff, Football League President, and a director of Everton was that directors should always direct. “We have never had a paid manager and we never will while I am on the Board” he once said.” Mr. Balmforth, the newly co-opted director, an accountant, is a relative by marriage of Dr. Cecil Baxter, a director and former chairman. He was educated at St. Francis Xavier’s joined the King’s Regiment in the 1914-18 war soon after leaving school and won the M.C. at Ypres as a captain. Quiet shrewd and essentially a man of balance he is well qualified for his new role.\n\nSTARS PASSED FITNESS TESTS THIS MORNING\n\nJanuary 10, 1952. The Evening Express\n\nPilot’s Log (Don Kendall)\n\nEverton will play an unchanged team against Leyton Orient in the F.A.Cup Third Round tie at Brisbane road on Saturday, all the injuries having come through tests this morning all rights. This means that Maurice Lindley will be at Central League in place of Jones, who was unable to play at Rotherham, because of muscle trouble. Ted Buckle will be with the party as 12th man. The team includes several players who will be making their Cup debut for Everton. They are Leyland, Clinton, Lindsay; Donovan, McNamara, Hickson, and Parker. Everton; Leyland; Clinton, Lindsay; Donovan, Lindley, Farrell; McNamara, Fielding, Hickson, Parker, Eglington.\n\nThe official party will leave Lime-Street at lunch time tomorrow just as for an ordinary league match in the London area, and will speed tomorrow every at a show. The return journey will be made on Saturday, there arrangements standing even if there is a reply. The Everton players were given a final training spell this morning.\n\nGOODISON SHOCK\n\nJanuary 10, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nEverton Director Resigns\n\nMr. Harold Williams Disagrees With Board on Question of Policy\n\nRanger’s Notes\n\nThe resignation of Mr. Harold Williams a director of Everton, which was considered and accepted at Tuesday night’s meeting of the board, but not announced yesterday at the time the co-option of Mr. C. E. Balmforth was made public is the sequel to a special meeting of the board held last October. This meeting took place on Monday afternoon, October 29, a week after an Open Letter” to the board in this column and two days after an article which put some searching questions to the directors. The gathering which was held without the usual attendance of paid officials was accompanied by much plain speaking. Other directors besides Mr. Harold Williams expressed their anxiety at the club’s precarious position. At the conclusion Mr. Harold Williams –who is not related to the club’s chairman Mr. W.R. Williams –tendered his resignation. At the urgent request of his colleagues, however, and in order to avoid a split at a time when the club’s position was so fraught with danger he agreed to reconsider the matter. On January 1 he wrote to the chairman confirming his earlier decision and asked the board this time to consider his resignation as final. On seeing no mention of this in the announcement last night of Mr. Balmforth’s co-option , Mr. Williams made public his letter of resignation, which reads;-\n\n“After having given the matter long and serious consideration I herewith tender my resignation from the board of Everton F.C. It is a wrench to sever my official connection with Everton after so many years as supporter member, shareholders and directors but I cannot agree with a policy that sub-ordinated the winning of promotion to a theoretical five year plan. “I think the present manager has resigned quite long enough in sole command, and I for one do not feel inclined to continue as a director under a regime in which directors are directors in name only.” When I spoke to Mr. Williams this morning he said, “My interest in Everton had been completely killed by the way things have been going over the past couple of years. I feel strongly that we need not have suffered relegation had the problem been tackled in the right manner.” Mr. Williams declined to add anything further “I have said all I want to say.” He remarked. “I would now prefer that the matter died a natural dealth.” He finally added however that his resignation had nothing to do with his health which for a long time has not been good, and that he had not” fallen out” with any members of the board.\n\n“Chairman’s Statement\n\nWhen I spoken to Mr. W. R. Williams, Everton, chairman regarding the non-announcement yesterday of Mr. Harold Williams resignation, he said there was a sound reason for this. After the resignation had been accepted,” he stated “I telephoned Mr. Williams to the effect and advised him that I did not intend to make the matter public until a formal letter expressing our regret –which was posted yesterday –had reached him, I did not wish him to think that we were in any hurry or to see it in the Press before he had our official acceptance. Mr. Williams expressed his personal regret at his namesake’s decision but said he had told him he would always be welcome at Goodison Park and that if the club could be of being so, him at any time he must not hesitate to say so.\n\nFilling The Vacancy\n\nWhen I asked the chairman what the board proposed to do regarding this further vacancy he replied that it would probably be filled in due course by a further co-option. Answering a further question regarding an old promise to the shareholders –made several years ago following protests at the annual meeting – that in future the board would refrain from co-option Mr. Williams explained that had the vacancies caused by Mr. Fred Lake’s death and the present resignation been held over it would have meant that five positions would have had to be filled by election at the next annual meeting. “To my mind that is not a position that a club by Everton’s standing should be faced with “he continued. “We have been passing through a parlous time of much anxiety and we feel that it is best for the club that this remaining vacancy should be filled as soon as possible. We shall probably announce the co-option of a new director within the next month or so.\n\nEverton Team Unchanged\n\nEverton will field an unchanged team against Leyton Orient with Lindley continuing at centre half Jones is still unfit. Teams;- Everton; Leyland; Clinton, Lindsay; Donovan, Lindley, Farrell; McNamara, Fielding, Hickson, Parker, Eglington.\n\nThe players are all in good spirits and though by no means prone to belittle the calibre of the opposition, there is a general feeling in the dressing room that Everton’s name will figure in the fourth round. Though cup topics have pushed other matters into the background lately. Everton followers are taking an interest in the affairs of the second team. The chances of the Central League championship landing at Goodison Park are bright. Reserve team gates have been improving lately, and there should be a good crowd on Saturday to see the Blues’s second string oppose Manchester City Reserves. At the moment Everton are back on top of the Central league table.\n\nLEADERSHIP CHALLENGES\n\nJanuary 11, 1952. The Evening Express\n\nBy Pilot (Don Kendall)\n\nEverton have a great chance of consolidating their position among the challenges for the Central League championship when, at Goodison Park tomorrow, they entertain Manchester City. His match was due to have been played on December 8, but heavy rains inside the ground unplayable. The Blues defeated West Bromwich Albion by 6 goals last Saturday, and will now have out the same team, except that as Ted Buckle goes south with the first team, Don Easthope returns to outside left, where he has played for most of the season. This being a day left blank for Cup-tie. Everton Res; O’Neill; Saunders, Rankin; Birch, Woods, Grant; Harris, Lello, Lewis, Cummins, Easthope.\n\nEVERTON CAN DO IT.\n\nJanuary 11, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nRanger’s Notes\n\nEverton are facing Leyton Orient at Leyton, will not be easy, but if the Blues tackle it in the right manner and above all turn good approach work into goals they should be in the draw for round four on Monday. Everton had a spell just before Christmas when the ball at long last was running kindly, for them. Often they played even better than the margin of victory indicated. Since then they have slipped back a trifle due largely to the wastage of scoring chances and occasional shakiness in defence. They have however, been up against some good and improving sides. Leyton are not quite in the same class for skill and artistry as Everton’s recent opponents though on the score of ruggedness and busting tactics I am told they must not be under estimated. The Third Division clubs with less at stake than the bigger and wealthier teams often seek by determined methods to throw their supposedly superior opponents out of their normal stride. Everton must not be ruffied if this turns out to be the case at Leyton. They have the ability to command success if they go the right way about it. Here’s hoping for the best. Leyton Orient; Walton; Evans, Banner; Blizzard, Aldous, Deverall; Woan, Pacey, Rees, Brown, Blatchford. Everton; Leyland; Clinton, Lindsay; Donovan, Lindley, Farrell; McNamara, Fielding, Hickson, Parker, Eglington.\n\nEVERTON JUST COULD NOT KNOCK THE SHINE OUT OF THE ORIENT STARS\n\nJanuary 12, 1952. The Liverpool Football Echo\n\nLeyton Nil, Everton Nil\n\nBy Stork\n\nA little sharp shooting by Everton when they took command would have won this game, but hesitation in making a shot meant the difference between success and failure. Then the Orient took over and gave Everton some anxious moments before the final whistle. It was a match of defences, but there were chances missed by both sides. Leyton Orient; Welton, goal; Evans, Banner, backs; Blizzard, Aldroas, and Deverall, half-backs; Woan, Pacey, Rees (captain), Brown, and Bltachford, forwards. Everton; Leyton, goal; Clinton and Lindsay, backs; Donovan, Lindley and Farrell (captain), half-backs; McNamara, Fielding, Hickson, Parker, and Eglington, forwards. Referee; Mr. G. Parkhurst (Warwick). The visit of Everton to Leyton in the F.A. Cup tie was looked upon as a “tit-bit” in the neighborhood. The programme showed no change in either side. This was Everton’s second visit to Leyton for they were visitors many years ago when the Blues brought off a victory. It was a glorious day. Everton’s new director, Mr. Cyril Balmforth was one of the party of Everton directors. The ground was well sanded and looked a trifle soft on top, but not nearly as bad as Everton have experienced in recent weeks. I hear that Woan is fitting into the Orient team very well and is already a great favourite. Many prefer him to Jackson. Leyton played in red jerseys and Everton in their secondary colours,”white” The Orient kicked off putting Everton to face the sun. Leyton started off on a promising note, for they had the honour of delivering the first shot of the match when Blatchford tried a first-timer which went straight into Leyland’s hands. Woan had made the opening possible with a nice pass to Rees who swept the ball across the penalty time. It was then Everton’s turn and after a short attack, Eglington had a shot blocked Leyton brought the cheers when Woan moved across field and with his left foot shot hard against an opponents the ball going out to Blatchford, who centred only to see Lindley head away. The Orient’s first time methods were at bit of a worry to Everton, but they weathered the little storms which brewed up in front of Leyland. Some of Orient’s midfield play was good and a Woan centre saw Clinton just beat Brown in a heading duel. The game so far was entertaining. The Londoners had more scoring opportunities, mostly made by the right wing, and they could have troubled Leyland had Blatchford been a little calmer in his shooting for he put one, shot high over the bar. A corner by Everton put the Leyton goal in trouble but Welton dealt confidently with Eglington’s flag-kick which was dropping under the bar until the goalkeeper tipped the ball over. A second corner came to Everton and this time Welton rushed out of goal to take the ball off Hickson’s head. Hereabouts. Everton were enjoying their best spell up to the moment and Welton again distinguished himself with a grand save from Fielding. It was a good move which led to the shot, but the honours went to the goalkeeper, who smartly edged the ball over the bar. Everton were now coming more into the picture and Fielding had a shot blocked by Evans, but another corner was won by Everton. This was capably dealt with. Farrell cleverly dispossessed Woan when the former Liverpool winger looked menacing. Everton had taken six corners in a short space of time. The Orient were a little too hurried in what they attempted and thereby missed several good chances. Young Aldous was holding the middle successfully against good Everton play. He was injured and had to receive attention. The Orient goal nearly fell when Fielding offered Parker a shot which was taken leisurely and just scraped the outside edge of the upright. Everton had been on top for some time and goals promised to come despite some stern work by the Southern defence. After a quick raid by Leyton when Leyland had to cut in and take a ball from Rees close in. Eglington was offered a chance to bring that worthy left foot into play. The Irishman hit the ball hard and true, but again it was deflected from goal. Everton were still pressing their cause.\n\nSpilt Second Decision\n\nParker was slow to take an opening. A quick shot could easily have done the trick, but that split second made all the difference. It was astonishing how many Everton shots struck one of the opposition. Farrell was coming through as a sixth forward time and again and the once got to within shooting range. He let his shot go but pulled, it a shade, and the ball passed outside. Rees had gone outside right, and was limping along the line with Pacey centre forward. Near the interval the Orient made an effort to sneak a last minute goal but did not get near enough to Leyland to cause any heartburning. Half-time; Leyton orient nil, Everton nil.\n\nEverton opened the second half with a move on the right culminating in a wild shot by Eglington which slewed wide. The Orient replied with a centre from Blatchford, which was nicely caught by Leyland. Rees was back at centre forward but he was laboring under the handicap of lumbago. Welton dropped on a Fielding flack and later saw the same player shoot outside. Leyland had to come out of goal to kick clear when Orient made a knife-like attack. For some minutes the Orient put up a strong challenge and the Everton goal had a lucky escape when Woan burst his way through. He tried a second time, but Leyland smothered him up. Leyton got every encouragement from their supporters, but accepting chances was not one of the strong notes of this game. Had it been McNamara would have scored when the ball was put on a plate for him. The ball swung outside. A free kick to Everton looked to be a gift to Parker but the inside man could not get hold of the ball properly and Welton was able to step in and collect.\n\nLost Their Grip\n\nEverton had lost their grip on things and Leyton came more into the game, but the respective defences were well able to deal with what problems faced them. A free kick against Lindley for a foul on Blatchford almost brought the Orient their longed for goal. The kick was sent into goalmouth and Blizzard shot outside. The Orient were fighting strongly whereas Everton had lost what craft they had. Eglington was now operating at centre forward, Hickson at inside left and Parker on the wing. A centre by McNamara just passed too high for Parker. Donovan tried to give Farrell an opportunity but the Orient stood firm. Aldous stopped a Fielding effort but the shooting was not of the kind likely to break down the defences. The game was stopped when Blizzard sat down with a leg injury. Leyton took a corner and sent all their tall players down into the Everton goalmouth but the ruse did not come off. Lindley was defiant in the centre and Clinton was defending stubbornly. Near the end, Welton was nearly caught with the ball at his feet and had not apparently seen McNamara on the horizon. It was a rare battle for supremacy and I had to admit that Orient were the more dangerous lot. Final; Leyton Orient nil, Everton nil. Attendance 21,240 receipts £2,688.\n\nEVERTON RES V. MAN CITY RES\n\nJanuary 12, 1952. The Liverpool Football Echo\n\nEverton Reserves; O’Neill, goal; Saunders and Rankin, backs; Birch, Wood and Grant, half-backs; Harris, Lello, Lewis, Cummins, and Easthope, forwards. Manchester City Reserves; Williams, goal; Beecher and Westwood, backs; Barnes, Fowler, and McCourt, half-backs; Allisopp, Williamson, Webb, Davies, Cunliffe, forwards. Referee; Mr. H.E. Lambert (Blackburn). In this pre-arranged match Everton were much the better side with Easthope and Cummins displaying grand tactics on the left. After 23 minutes Lewis put Everton ahead from five yards range. In the 38th minute Cunliffe, with a great drive, placed the City on level terms. Half-time; Everton Reserves 1, Manchester City Reserves 1. Everton pressed after the resumption and succeeded in regaining the lead in the 50th minute through Grant. The City were dangerous but found O’Neill safe. Allison equalized for City, and Lewis gave Everton the lead. Final; Everton Reserves 3, Manchester City Reserves 2.\n\nEVERTON’S CO-OPTION\n\nJanuary 12, 1952. The Liverpool Football Echo\n\nBy Rangers\n\nThis week’s announcement of the co-option of Mr. Cyril E. Balmforth to the Everton board plus the statement of Christmas W.R. Williams that another co-option will be forthcoming shortly to fill the place rendered vacant by the resignation of Mr. Harold Williams appears to have made quite a few Everton shareholders rather hot under the collar. Two or three have rung me up about it and others have written. All recall that some years ago a promise was made at an annual meeting that the board would allow all future vacancies to go to the vote, and not co-opt new directors, I do not propose to give more than one letter on this point for most are couched in the same strain.\n\nMr. L. B. Osborne of 110 Portelet Road, Liverpool 13 writes;-\n\n“As a member of the Everton Shareholders Association I was interested to see the announcement of Mr. Balmforth’s co-option in your notes I seem to recall that the Shereholders Association have always opposed co-option in the past and I think that I am correct in stating that some ten or twelve years ago the board give a promise not to co-opt in future without consulting the shareholders. I would like to ask how the directors reconcile their present action in view of their past promise and more especially as at the last annual meeting accusations were flung at Mr. R.E. Searles about being a “dictator.” “It would now seem that the board themselves are appearing in the role of dictators by telling the majority of the shareholders who shall sit on the board. “Surely the shareholders have the right to say who should represent them and he fairest method would have been either to have an election or else give the seat to the man who finished fourth at the last election.”\n\nChairman’s Statement\n\nI do not propose to offer a personal opinion on the matter. There is much to be said for both sides Mr. W.R. Williams pointed out in an interview which I gave on Thursday that the board considered it was not in keeping with a club of Everton’s standing that all position should arise in which five vacancies required filling at the next annual meeting. There is also the point that the board has changed considerably in constitution since this promise was given and a statement made by their predecessors could hardly be considered to find those who were not directors at that time. There may be some who ask whether an interim election could not have been held to fill the two vacancies. It is three months since Mr. Fred Lake died, and for the past two months or more the board has known of the possibility of Mr. Harold Williams resignation. He first tendered his resignations on October 29 at the emergency board meeting which followed as article in these columns calling on the directors to fulfill the functions indicated by their title. Although he held the matter over for the time being at the request of his colleagues Mr. Harold Williams impending departure was known for some time. His final letter of resignation was dated January 1 ten days before the first co-option. These, however, are matters for the board and the shareholders to thrush out themselves. The latter can ask any questions they wish at the annual meeting and no doubt the chairman will give us explanation. It would have been a decidedly intriguing situation however, had both vacancies been left open. With five positions to fill out of a board of nine, the way might have been open to a complete change in the balance of power in the directorate. Not that I think it would have happened unless the club had been in a decidedly more precarious position than it is at the moment. But we should have had an even livelier election than any in the past, which is saying a lot.\n\nEVERTON FIRED “BLANKS”\n\nJanuary 14, 1952. The Liverpool Football Echo\n\nBy Stork\n\nLeyton Orient 0, Everton 0\n\nEverton had to fight tooth and nail for the right to a replay with Leyton Orient, yet with good snap-shooting they could have won. Once they had mastered the Orient’s fiery opening and taken command they had only to accept their chances to have snuffled Leyton out. I feel sure that a goal, when Everton were on top, would have shattered the Londoners completely but seeking that Everton were no wonder men in shooting the Orient gained heart and confidence. There are dalliance on the part of forwards which was fatal. It was aggravating to see Everton move towards the target by superior football and then find they had only blank shot in their rifles. At least three times a player was in position to surprise the Orient defence but the chances were not taken. Parker in everything else but shooting showed himself to be a clever player, Fielding showed how the quick shot could be made to pay when he slammed in two that Welton did well to save, but the desire seemed to be there to make one more move before releasing the trigger.\n\nNot Intimidated\n\nThe Londoners certainly made a fight of it. The name Everton did not intimidate them and there were some close misses to the visitor’s goal; aye and several anxious moments. The Everton defence had some tough assignment before the final whistle came to relieve the tension which seemed to affect player and spectator alike. Everton should win the replay, but they will have to practice more shots than they did at Brisbane Road. During the second half Parker was moved to outside left. It was not a successful move; it mights have been costly. That it wasn’t was due to sterling defence. I thought a draw was a fair reflex of the game, although some claimed that Orient could well have snatched a win during their final rally. None played better than Clinton ably assisted by Lindsay and Lindley. The wing half backs could not be faulted but I would beg of the Everton forward to shoot. Leyton were handicapped with an injury to Rees. Their best forwards were Brown and Pacey. Fielding was the best Everton forward.\n\nLETON LESSONS\n\nJanuary 14, 1952. The Evening Express\n\nPilot’s Log (Don Kendall)\n\n“Everton failed to hit the high spots in the initial cup venture but when one realizes what happened to the First Division sides against lower standard opposition one inevitably comes to the conclusion that this was not such a bad performance after all. If Everton have assimilated the lessons that this game taught I have no fears regarding the outcome of Wednesday’s replay. This was a match which the Blues should have had tightly slew up long before half-time even allowing for the spirited resistance offered by an Orient defence, which covered itself splendidly and allowed the minimum of shooting loopholes. For some reason Parker and Eglington switched positions early in the second half and this, I thought was a tactical mistake Parker is essentially the stronger midfield tackler and with Eglington inside Leyton right half blizzard was able to come into the picture as an attacking force. Everton had more than enough anxious moments midway through the second session, and they owned much to the flawless defensive work of Clinton, whom I rated easily the outstanding unit for the side. “Leyland’s best work was his confident cutting out of a flew of the dangerous centres from Blatchford and Woan, who gave Lindsay quite a deal of trouble by reason of his speed and dash. Lindley was cool and competent after a rather shaky ten minutes at the start and I thought Donovan rather the more effective wing half. The attack although producing touches which showed them to be infinitely superior to the Orient did not really slick. Hickson and McNamara found little going right for them, and neither responded capably to the prompting of Fielding who got through a tremendous amount of hard work and was in fact the prime marksman in the line. Parker forged willingly before the interval but was inclined to year away from goal instead of realist the value of the snap shot. Eglington suffered in the general fall from normal ability and missed one glorious Fielding engineered chance in the opening seconds of the second half. Considering that Rees was a passenger for most of the game, Leyton merit commendation for there excellent fight, and in the goal no-one could deny that they were worthy of a second chance. “The Leyton folk from chairman Mr. H.S. Zussman downwards spared nothing in their efforts to give the Everton party a grand welcome and if this was not a game which those of us who saw it will especially remember, the Orient’s hospitally certainty will have a nice taste to the match. “\n\nEVERTON’S RIVALS WILL BE WITHOUT REES\n\nJanuary 14, 1952. The Evening Express\n\nHarris Will Lead Leyton Orient Attack\n\nBy Pilot (Don Kendall)\n\nTommy Harris, the former Fulham player, definitely will lead Leyton Orient’s attack against Everton in the F.A Cup replay at Goodison Park on Wednesday in place of Rees. Rees, the Orient captain, is suffering from Ininbago, which troubled him during Saturday’s game, and for a spell he played on the wing. The clubs is taking no risks with him that time and the introduction of Harris is the only change. Leyton Orient; Welton; Evans, Banner; Blizzard, Aldous, Deverall; Woan, Pacey, Harris, Brown, Blatchford. The Everton players, who usually have Monday off, were at Goodison Park this morning for a check up and a little work, but Manager Cliff Britton states that it may not be possible to announce this team until tomorrow. He has several problems despite the freedom from injury. The main problem is whether to aim at more striking power in attack, or to leave the “drawists” to the task of winning the tie. Whatever the decision I fancy Everton can manage this task all tight. Shareholders and members will be given priority in admittance to their stands in Bullens-road up to 1.45 p.m on production of the Third Round vouchers in their books and the 5s admission charge. They will queue only in Bullens road. Other stands seats will be 3d, 6d, paddock 2s, 3d, and ground 1s 6d.\n\nIf Everton beat Leyton Orient, Everton visit St Andrews against Birmingham in the F.A Cup Fourth Round.\n\nORIENT’S FIGHT\n\nJanuary 14, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nBy Stork.\n\nThe Leyton Orient directors say “We are only a struggling Third Division club.” Well, the team lived up to that in forcing a draw with Everton. At one time Everton looked to be so much on top that the opinion appeared that it was only a matter of time before Everton’s superiority must show itself in the shape of goals. Many times I have had cause to blame Everton for not shooting. This time I accuse them of being too slow in making their shots. They did make them, it’s a true but they made them seconds after they should have been delivered. That little hesitancy was their downfall. On the other hand the Orient’s propensity to be too hurried in their shooting was well for Everton for I am sure it cost them goals. Everton’s approach work was infinitely better than that of Leyton but after that things became balanced for the Londoners had their moments when Everton were striving to hold on to “half.” Like most Third teams the Orient opened full of fiery notions to make a quick dent in the Everton armour. It failed and Everton’s more methodical football intimately swung the pendulum in the opposite direction. It was then that the Merseysiders should have staked their claim for round “four.” It only needed the quick shot to have shaken the Orient to the depths. The Orient were soon acquainted with the methods of their rivals close to goal, so they packed their goalmouth and when the shot came it usually rattled against someone or swung outside or was collared by the goalkeeper. The half-hour preceding the interval was Everton’s best. The foundation of success should have been laid there and then, but having failed to build solidity the “Everton house” became shaky at least so far as the attack was concerned. Orient saw it and set out to lay their own foundation but they were not one wit better when “came to piloting the ball into the net. There were near squeaks pulse quickening actions which had us wondering whether Everton could hold out for the Orient were putting up a bonny fight. They did, but all their thanks must go to the defence, which never faltered under whatever stress it was placed. But I will wager that the final whistle was never more welcome to Everton, for they had been on the wrong end of the stick during the last 35 minutes of the game I cannot understand why forwards clever enough in football ability will not chance their arm after they have put up the scaffolding. Parker was slow to take shooting chances, McNamara missed a reasonably good scoring chance and Hickson rarely got a show against the hard tackling Aldous. Fielding was Everton’s best forward, and right behind him were six men who would not yield an inch to nay man. Clinton and Lindsay were confident and Lindley used his head to great effect, when the Orient forwards were hitting hard and threatening Brown and Pavey were their best forwards for Woan tried to do too much. Blatchford’s speed was a menace, but Rees was a passengers most of the game.\n\nCAN EVERTON PULL IT OFF?\n\nJanuary 15, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nScoring Chances Must Not Be Wasted If Blues Are To Progress Further.\n\nRanger’s Notes\n\nCup fever will run high again tomorrow in many places with the main interest in this area centred on the Everton –Leyton replay at Goodison Park. Everton with ground advantage behind them plus the lessons they learned at the first tussle with Leyton Orient ought to get through Leyton too, doubtless picked up a few tips at Brisbane Road which will be helpful to their cause though whether enough to sway the balance in their favour’s another matter. There have been so many cup-tie shocks already that nothing can be ruled out as impossible though some things may look a trifle improbable. If Everton produce their normal form and take their chances without hesitation then I fancy Leyton’s Goodison visit will mark the end of their active participation in this season’s competition. Should Everton fiddle about as they did at Brisbane Road, however, the tale may be different. No side can afford to fritter away scoring openings in a cup-tie. That is courting trouble. We had sufficient proof in Saturday’s game the difference in league standing count for precious little in these do-or-die matches. The Third Divisioners have no respect for position or tradition. They are out to win if possible and by hard endeavour and rugged tackling often counter-balance the extra skill and craftsmanship of their more aristocratic opponents. We saw that at Anfield with Workington. Workington may not have been in Liverpool’s class in some respects, but they were bonny fighters. Leyton will probably put just as much into their game as the Cumbrians did. They have every incentive. Everton will not decide their attack until later. Choice will be made from six forwards. The defence is unchanged. The only change in the Orient side is Harris at centre forward for Rees, who has now definitely had to cry off following the report of the club’s specialist. Everton; Leyland; Clinton, Lindsay; Donovan Lindley, Farrell; from; McNamara, Buckle, Fielding, Hickson, Parker, Eglington. Leyton Orient; Walton; Evans, Banner; Blizzard, Aldous, Daverall; Woan, Pacey, Harris, Brown, Blatchford.\n\nMcNAMARA OR BUCKLE\n\nJanuary 16, 1952. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nTransfer-listed Ted Buckle, the man whose spare frame cannot stand the rigour of weather in the North, may be in the Everton side which replays Leyton Orient, at Goodison Park this afternoon. If manager Cliff Britton decides Buckle for McNamara at outside right –and Buckle’s greater experience and penetration may turn the balance – the man whom we said farewell a few weeks ago might delay his departure notably. A fortnight ago Buckle was telling me how much he disliked the climate here. He was then having penicillin injection for ear trouble and it was clear that all he wanted was opportunity to go South into milder conditions and find a club in the London area where he lives. News that he is in the Everton attack may disturb Leyton. Buckle is apt to be a match winner on the wing; but when I spoke to Manager Alex Stock of Leyton at Southport last night there was no mistaking his optimism. “We feel that having held Everton, despite the injury to Rees we are in the match with a positive chance” was his summing up.\n\nComing Home\n\nFor Alex and for his winger Don Woan it is almost a case of coming home, though the Leyton manager never played here. During the war he was posted to the armor of the 1st King’s Regiment and who should be his room-mate but the son of the late Jack Parkinson most notable of Liverpool centre forwards. Woan you will remember was a discovery, at Bootle of Alex Stevenson. Bootle had ideas that he might be signed by Everton, but Everton made no move and Liverpoool stepped in. Then Woan left for Leyton in an exchange of players involving the present Liverpool right winger. Brian Jackson. Among the scouts at Goodison Park will be Manchester United manager Matt Busby, who has had the Leyton Orient inside forward, Pacey watched in each of his last two games. This will be a first rate chance for Matt to “see for himself.” Another Leyton player noted “in running” is centre half Aldious. I am told he played exceptionally well in the first match. Harris is a young lad in the Army, takes over at centre forward from the injured Rees. With the tie now at their own ground Everton are at an advantage yet many will go to this match “prepared for anything” the only certainty being that Leyton are going to fight hard, tactically and physically to upset the odds.\n\nEVERTON GO OUT\n\nJanuary 16, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nTragic Errors In Defence\n\nPacey Double\n\nBy Ranger\n\nLeyton Orient provided an even bigger surprise at Goodison than Tranmere did at Huddersfield. The issue should never have been in doubt for Everton enjoyed 90 per cent of the game territorially. Enjoyed is the right word for Leyton’s three goals all came through a defensive blunder. Leyland had a tragic match. Before the finish he was reduced to such a state of nervous that he once required three efforts to pick up the most simple shot. Before the start of the game the Everton loudspeakers played the record “Just one more chance.” They do not get another chance but Leyton do, and now visit Birmingham in the fourth round on February 2. Everton, truth to tell, did not deserve another chance. Whoever chooses the music? As the players trooped off the field he record played was “You’d be far better off in a home.” Everton; Leyland, goal; Clinton and Lindsay, backs; Donovan, Lindley and Farrell (captain), half-backs; Buckle, Fielding, Hickson, Parker and Eglington, forwards. Leyton Orient;- Weldon, goal; Evans and Banner, backs; Blizzard, Aldous, and Deverall, half-backs; Woan, Pacey, Harris, Brown and Blatchford, forwards. Referee; Mr. G. Pankhurst, (Warwick). Everton decided in view of the firm state of the pitch, to play Buckle at outside night in place of McNamara. This was the only change from Saturday. Leyton Orient had Harris taking the place of Rees so that orient were without their only two international players. Blair missing both games. The first shot of note was a 30 yarder from Buckle which Walton saved at the foot of the post. A long pass by Parker looked promising for Hickson until Aldous produced a timely intervention. Aldous was not so fortunate a moment later when Hickson came tearing up. He had to sacrifice a corner as a safety first measure from which Fielding leveled a shot but Welton had positioned himself nicely to collect. At the others end Leyland was the unfortunate perpetrator of an error which led to Leyton taking the leading goal in seven minutes. The Everton goalkeeper failed to punch away a corner by Blatchford and Brown faced with an open goal made what appeared to be an equally expensive miss. His shot cannoned off Clinton to the foot of Harris, who this time made no mistakes. This was a bit of luck for Orient but terribly hard on Everton who have suffered severely this season from goalkeeping errors. Buckle trying to place the ball when he picked up a punch away by Walton wrung his hands in despair as he saw it miss its billet by a mere foot or so. It seemed certain that before long the Leyton defence must crack for it was not only subjected to terrific pressure but was not at all impressive. Some clearances were very weak.\n\nReward Comes\n\nSurely enough at the 25th minute Everton got their reward. All the players were in Leyton’s half except Leyland. A long punt by Clinton dropped alongside Parker who in one movement veered to the left to avoid a defender then whipped in a shot which gave Welton no possible chance. Still the “shooting-in” match continued. Leyton’s packing of their goal area and Everton’s inability to put their effort on the urgent meant that Welton was still not being employed as busily as he should have been in relation to Everton’s territorial advantage and close-in pressure. Buckle, Hickson, and Eglington were wide of the mark with strong shots, while several times Orient defenders nipped in to clear as an Everton player was about to shoot. Welton on the ground, found the ball lip out of his grasp and as he and Evans scrambled to get it away between them they almost had it in the net. For the second time, after they should have been well in front Everton found themselves a goal down, through defensive error. This time the culprit was Lindsay, usually so reliable who was top nonchalant. He found an awkwardly bouncing ball beat and Pacey, rounding him quickly, went on a few paces to put the ball into the net. This was at 42 minutes and a moment later Leyland almost dropped the ball at the foot of Blatchford. It had been an amazing first half Everton enjoyed such superiority that they should have had the game well won. Instead of which with the shaky Leyton defence –Welton apart – they went off a goal down.\n\nHalf-time-Everton 1, Leyton Orient 2.\n\nOrient were saved three times inside a minute first when Welton dived to stop a Hickson header from a corner and again when Aldous and Evans kicked off the line.\n\nNarrow Escape\n\nYet another narrow escape for Leyton the ball forward from an Eglington centre for Parker to hook it goalwards. He had the mortification of seeing it hit the bar and go behind. An inch lower and he deflection would have been into the net. Hickson needed attention and an Eglington shot sped a couple of yards over the bar. This match will go down in history by reason of Everton’s defensive errors for it was another goalkeeping mistake by Leyland which led to Leyland getting a third goal at the 64th minute. Blatchford, put over a strong centre-cum-shot which Leyland elected to fist away instead of catching. The ball flew almost straight up in the air and dropped at the feet of Pacey, who turned round and flashed it into the net to give Leyton a two goal lead. It was all against the run of play, but once more showed that only goals count and Everton were not getting them. Buckle came nearest to reducing the lead with a quick first-timer which was just on the wrong side of the woodwork. Parker rammed in a shot which was well worth a goal, but Welton was there to deny him with a full length save. Poor Leyland appeared to have been so upset by his errors that he had to have three efforts to make a simple pick up from Harris. Everton with ten minutes to go were a dispirited and weary lot and Leyton were now actually on top. Woan, former Bootle boy, and Blatchford, twice cut through with grand individual runs but with no ho at the end of them.\n\nBrilliant Save\n\nWelton made a brilliant save from Buckle, sweeping the ball out after it had appeared to be behind him, risking his back in doing so. Evens headed out off the goal line with Weldon helpless. Final; Everton 1, Leyton Orient 3. The Official Attendance was 33,750.\n\nORIENT TWICE TAKE LEAD IN FIRST HALF\n\nJanuary 16, 1952. The Evening Express\n\nOrient Twice Take Lead in First Half\n\nVital Slips; Visitors Sound Defence\n\nBy Pilot (Don Kendall)\n\nEverton staged their fourth home post-war cup-tie at Goodison Park today, when they entertained Leyland Orient in their third round replay, for the right to visit Birmingham City in the fourth round. The clubs played a goalless draw in London on Saturday and both sides made one change. Ted Buckle was brought in at outside right for Everton in place of McNamara the decision being made just before the start and in view of the excellent ground condition –a ground requiring only a minimum of sand. Leyton had Harris at centre forward in place of Rees. There were about 35,000 spectators at the start but little of the cup-tie atmosphere was felt. Everton; Leyland, goal; Clinton and Lindsay, backs; Donovan, Lindley and Farrell (captain), half-backs; Buckle, Fielding, Hickson, Parker and Eglington, forwards. Leyton Orient;- Weldon, goal; Evans and Banner, backs; Blizzard, Aldous, and Deverall, half-backs; Woan, Pacey, Harris, Brown and Blatchford, forwards. Referee; Mr. G. Pankhurst, (Warwick). The ground was often than it appeared, and footprints appeared as soon as the players started to appear. The first real effort was Hickson’s crossfield run from the right, followed by a Buckle centre which however brought no danger. A fielding shot was kicked away by Aldous, before Buckle away on the right, tried a surprise left foot shot dead on the mark and which Welton saved at full length near the post. Blatchford broke away but Leyland came out to catch his centre as Harris charged in. This first corner fell to the Orient, and the Third Division were rather quicker into their stride than the Blues playing in white.\n\nWelton’s Save\n\nAldous conceded a corner when challenged by Hickson, and from this Fielding made a strong right shot which Welton pulled down from under the bar. Challenged by Harris and Blatchford, Lindley and Clinton were a trouble but Donovan came back to concede a corner to hold up Blatchford. This brought the opening goal in seven minutes, Harris being the scorer. Leyland can take a lot of the blame for this for he came running out to take Blatchford corner but missed the ball completely and it was pushed well forward towards the far post. There was a slowness to clear and Harris from two yards, stabbed the ball into the net, with Leyland still miles out of his ground. It was a scrappy goal, but was the direct to curious in certainty almost the Everton defence. Clearances has not been crisp and there was lax covering. The Orient tried to cash in on their advantage but suddenly Buckle broke away; place Hickson in possession, but Hickson advanced the ball too quickly. From a throw in the ball was swept across to Buckle, whose shot was just wide of the post. Welton saved the Orient when Fielding went through and pushed the ball across towards Hickson and Buckle. Just as Hickson was about to shoot, Welton dashed out and fell on the ball to prevent a certain goal. Lindley’s free kick saw Hickson and Buckle combine but the long legs of Aldous took charge and the Orient foster on the ball, were soon back again, the Everton passing lacking conviction as well as accuracy. Hickson raced away to survive a foot and to make a fast cross shot which went just over the top. Aldous handed the ball on the edge of the penalty area to intercept Lindsay’s kick which was going through to Hickson, and following the free kick, Hickson, and then Eglington centred before Eglington forced a corner.\n\nPepper Defence\n\nEverton began to swing into the game after a quarter of an hour, and they really peppered the Orient defence, Fielding and Buckle having shots charged down, before Buckle pushed the ball through to Parker, who, however, could not get hold of it properly and it ran off his toe. Everton, driven on by the roars of the crowd, literally penned the Orient into their own goalmouth or ten minutes on told, one breakaway by Don Woan being the only real thrust by the Orient. Everton seemed to be playing with greater confidence and one could see a goal coming all the way, as Orient defended oft-times with sheer desperation. It did come in 22 minutes, when Donovan placed the ball into the goalmouth where Hickson and Parker went for it. Hickson obviously hearing a shout moved out of the way and Parker pushed the ball into the net from close range. Everton seemed to have taken command and a little extra speed in sending the ball in the goalmouth must have got a greater reward than this line goal, for unless the ball was trapped first time, the Orient defenders gave no second chance. Welton under the greatest difficulties fisted away Buckle’s lobbed centre which seemed to be curling under the bar. Hickson’s had a grand chance after an enterprising burst through by Farrell, but he allowed the ball to bounce off his leg, and so Leyton were able to take charge. Straight away Woan burst through to feed Harris who found his path to goal harried by Lindley and Clinton. Everton were attacking so much that they won three corners in the pace of two minutes, and from the third Hickson having missed his own chance of shooting back-heeled the ball to Buckle whose quick shot flashed outside. Hickson cleverly held off three men, and eventually beat Aldous before shooting just past the post. The Orient came back to take a corner which gave Everton more than a little trouble, before Farrell got the ball away and we saw Welton dive to his right to save from Parker. Fielding made a glorious effort when he dribbled from 13 yards and from just inside the penalty area shot hard along the floor, Welton again diving to his right to make a thrilling save.\n\nAmazing Escape\n\nOrient had an amazing escape when from Lindsay’s free kick Hickson and Parker bore through, faced by six Orient defenders. Weldon dived to, but could not hold Hickson’s first shot and was injured in making the dive, Hickson and Parker both made bold attempts to force the ball through, but the Orient covered magnificent, beating away shots with legs and bodies. Just as so often happens, after prolonged pressure, the Orient went away to regain the lead in 41 minutes, pacey being the scorer. Farrell can the take the blame for this goal, for unchallenged he made a pass straight to the feed of Deverall who moved the ball upfield to Harris. Harris broke clear from Lindley and lobbed the ball square to Pacey just inside the penalty area, Pacey flashed it into the net, Leyland having no possible chance. Leyfield a little later ran out but failed to field the ball cleanly and it dropped back to Deverall who, however, with an open goal facing him was much too long in making his shot.\n\nHalf-time; Everton 1, Leyton Orient 2\n\nEverton took up the attack immediately on resulting but the Orient’s body checking was so good that never a direct shot reached Welton, despite hard grafting by Hickson, Parker, and Buckle. There is no doubt that Everton were to blame for their position, for both goals, headed down, were in the nature of grits. So much attacking by a Second Division man against a Third Division side should have produced more goals than one, especially in view of the tremendous pressure Everton had exerted.\n\nMore Escapes\n\nThe Orient had some amazing escapes, following a Fielding corner, for Hickson headed in like a bullet, Welton driving on the ball on the line. His clearance was not complete, and Parker and Eglington had shots kicked off the line. Eglington soon recovered from an injury, and Fielding backed heeled the ball only for Parker to shoot just over the top. It was Welton again who saved Orient when Parker cleverly back headed the ball, and Banner saved an awkward situation for Orient when he flung himself through the air to head the ball away from Fielding. Parker centred from the line and the ball bounced off Welton, but there was no one at hand to tap it into the net. Everton hammered away at the Orient barrier but could not score. The Orient’s sudden raids were till dangerous. They forced a corner where Everton, in an Endeavour to get extra striking power, switched Buckle ad Hickson. This was only a temporary measure and during it no shot replied Welton. Orient increased their lead in 64 minutes, Pacey being the scorer from what was another gift from Everton. Blatchford broke away and centred hard long the floor, Leyland came out to take the ball, but missed it completely and it ran to Pacey who sented it into the net from short range. Everton came back fighting but there were still slowness to shoot and the Orient defenders needed no more than a split second in which to make their clearances. Buckle tried to burst through by swerving to the right, but Deverall flung his body into the way of the shot which otherwise would have test the keeper.\n\nIRONY OF A MARTIAL MOMENT\n\nJanuary 17, 1952. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nEverton 1, Leyton Orient 3\n\nWe three kings of Orient are “pipe the carolers. The Orient of Leyton have only one king, goalkeeper Welton, but, by all the heavenly bodies, he reigned supreme over these Everton forwards. When they shot well (there were times) he save brilliantly, when they shot to well (they did, this three times) out came the trusty foot of one of his lieutenants to kick the ball from the line they shot badly (as they did too often) he did not need to brother and when they should have shot and did not he must have had difficulty in reviewing the evidence of his eyes. One glance at the other end of the field where Leyton shot infrequently and scored three times and you have and accurate if dismal picture of what happened in this third round F.A.Cup replay –a game which sent the Everton faction of 40,000 people from the ground laughing almost to the point of crying at the irony of the opening bars of marital music which played them out. We’d be far better off in a home.” Now if Weldon’s name had only been Max and Everton had the record how much happier it would have been had we been able to him. Welton’s saves are bonny.\n\nLeyton Glory\n\nBut Everton’s too negative faults must not take from the winners the glory they deserve for rubbing their opponents into the mud of Goodison Park –not in a nasty way, but by some first-rate chance-taking against the most jittery and sometimes a too complacent Everton defence. All three Leyton goals were tarnished at some stage, by indecision and blundering. Leyton to their everlasting credit, seized these chances well. That first goal of Harris at nine minutes. Leyland completely missed the Blatchford corner and from that moment was never in a position to recover. Clinton bravely poked Harris’s first shot away from the line, but this small, but able reserve was persistent and just as promptly hit the clearance back. How many times Everton should have equalized before Parker fastened quickly on to a ball half-headed away and lashed it past Welton at 23 minutes only Welton and his backs cam appreciate but maybe they were too busy congratulating themselves on Everton’s lack of shots, or on shots which flew wide to count.\n\nPlaying Well\n\nAt this point Everton were playing well, it without giving evidence that they appreciated the urgency of getting goals. They gave the impression that the match was nicely in hand and that it was only a matter of time. Pacey’s goal immediately before the interval the result of yet one more defensive blunder –did not seen to jolt them. Welton saved on the line and had his life saved twice within a matter of seconds early in the second half, before Parker had the bad luck to hit a fierce shot on to the top layer of the bar. Brown then made the best run of the match, struggling on when he might reasonably have appleaded for a penalty and getting the ball to the lively Blatchford whose centre Leyland tried to grasp, but only succeeding in turning high to where Pacey hit it home. He seemed unable to realize he had scored. Even then Everton had time to pull the match round. But Leyton obviously began to believe in themselves and once Evans had done his acrobatic goal-line turn to prevent he score going to 3-2 in the closing minutes it was only a matter of time.\n\nHad The Edge\n\nEverton lost this tie for a number of reasons, the chief one being Weldon but they had sufficient edge, in every way to have won the match on their first-half command. Leyton their goalkeeper and left wing triangle of Blatchford, Brown, and Deverall apart, were an indifferent side, but one quick to take chances and quick to stop Everton taking their’s. This slow reaction of Everton meant that time and again the Leyton defender moved to the ball at critical moments a fraction of a second before the would be shooter. Slowness to move at vital moments and laxity in defence to the point of jitters meant that Everton could not succeed. Leyton are to be congratulated on Cup progress against the odds with a side which can hardly go further. The policy of Orient seemed to be to give the Everton wingers space and freedom –to force the ball to the wings. On the deep mud of the shooting range Orient congregated in depth. There was one-moment when all save Harris were occupied in their own penalty area. Buckle was the best and most luckless shooter, it was a crime that an Everton attack fast and promising in many of its combined operations should founder so badly in front of goal.\n\nEVERTON’S BITTER PILL\n\nJanuary 17, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nRangers Notes\n\nTo suffer cup dismissal on one’s own ground by a team from a lower strata of football “society” is always a disappointment, but when defeat comes after enjoying four-fifths of the game territorially and presenting the opposing with all their goals, that surely is the bitterest pill of all. The same faults which caused Everton to lose their chances against the ten-men Orient side at Brisbane road were partly responsible for yesterday’s shock result, namely inaccurate finishing and slowness to shoot. Very early on I ceased counting the times Everton shots hit Leyton defenders. This was not always the fault of the shooter but too often it happened because the marksmen had “fiddled” away the valuable seconds which enabled someone to interpose his body between shooter and goalkeeper. I felt sorry for Leyland he had so disastrous a day that in the end he was too “butter-fingered” to hold the slimpiest effort. Others may make mistakes and get away with them, but the poor goalkeeper often has nobody to save his bacon when he errs.\n\nSimple Goals\n\nLeyton’s first goal came when Leyland completely missed a corner kick, the third when his poor effort at saving a fairly easy shot resulted in another simple short-range chance while the second was due partly to Farrell’s mis-directed pass, which caught the defenders spread-eagled and found Lindsay to nonchalant Leyland had no chance with the shot. Chatting with Leyton’s manager, Alec Stock, before the match, he seemed anything but optimistic about his side’s chances. His main hope was that they would put up a fighting show. They did the latter all right. Yet they were by no means brilliant in defence –Welton apart. Welton gave a splendid display. Had Everton had him in their team they would still be in the cup. Often the Orient defence escaped more by good luck rather than good play. There was nobody in the full back or half-backs lines who could clear the ball any distance. Several times the ball was dribbled towards his own goal by a Leyton man or tip-tapped when a lusty full-blooded clearance was the obvious thing.\n\nLost Heart\n\nIt was mainly their covering up which held Everton at bay, plus the latter’s own shortcomings in front of goal. Even so the Leyton goal had many narrow escapes. Three times in two minutes in the second half the ball was kicked away from the goalline when Welton was beaten, then Parker hit the bar, other shots missed by a mere fraction and still Everton could not reduce the leeway. After the third Leyton goal Everton seemed gradually to lose heart. They faded out so much that in the last 15 minutes the visitors became the more aggressive side for the first time and almost increased their lead. The game proved once more though further proof was not needed that differences of League standing means nothing in cup-ties. Superior midfield play or artistry means nothing if there are no goals to back it up and that is where Everton failed.\n\nNothing Went Right\n\nThe inclusion of Buckle for McNamara was no improvement. The latter’s service of centres might have been more advantageous. The forwards all worked hard enough but nothing went right for them and too big a proportion of passes went wrong. Farrell did everything possible to try to pull Everton together. But these days he is making too big a labour of his task, doing the work himself instead of letting the ball save hit legs. To dribble 30 yards and then make a five or six yards pass is reversing the natural order of things. While this is a game best forgotten I thrust the lessons it provided are taken to heart, other wise Everton are not going to meet with much success in the next few months. We have been told officially now that Everton have no five year plan. Instead that their aim is promotion as quickly as possible. I cannot see much hope of that with things as they are.\n\nParamount Need\n\nThe inspired spell they enjoyed just before Christmas has petered out. There will have to be a big improvement before promotion becomes a practical proposition, I said before the season started that I did not expect Everton to finish higher than half-way. Recent displays have given me no cause to amend that opinion. It is no consolation to say that Everton have lost matches they should have won. Their descent to the Second Division was paved by things they should have done but didn’t. Everton’s paramount need at the moment is a reliable goalkeeper. O’Neill and Leyland have been dropped before because of bad spell’s. The club cannot carry shaky custodians. Nothing destroys a team’s morale more than lack of confidence in the man beneath the bar. I have seen both these goalkeepers play splendidly at times but occasional good displays do not wipe but such tragic errors as yesterday’s. Consistency above all is required from the last line of defence. This, however, is not the only weakness. Others still persist and though temporarily there is improvement from time to time we always seem to get back more of less where we started. Everton have a long way to go yet before the old tradition are revived. Time is marching on. They may be only seven points behind the League leaders – but they are also only six points above the bottom club, and some of those below hem are showing much improved form.\n\nBLUES FATAL ERRORS\n\nJanuary 17,1952. The Evening Express\n\nPilot’s Log (Don Kendall)\n\nThree errors brought about the sensational 3-1 victory of Leyton Orient over Everton at Goodison Park yesterday to close the 1952 Cup chapter of the Blues. Everton did more to lose the match than Orient did to win it. Let me say at once that the Everton forwards did sufficient to have won ten games, even allowing for a slowness at times to do ordinary minds and feet. Shot after shot was sented in on the Leyton goal, and shot after shot was kept out. It was almost an believable. On the other hand, Leyton never made a single goal effort, apart from those which enainted from the Everton “gifts.” All through, Everton’s defence was jittery and at times incapable of making a crisp clearance even when unchallenged. Why Leyland came out to Blatchford’s corner in seven minutes lost everyone. He was yards off the ball, which was returned to the goalmouth and Harris had it in the net. The second goal at that vital pre-interval came from a misdirected Farrell pass. It went to Deverall who slipped it upfield for Harris, Lindley’s effort at interception as weak and so was Lindsay’s move to make Harris’s pass his own and so fancy stepped in to score.\n\nAnother\n\nWhen Parker struck the bar with an enterprising overhead kick Everton seemed to lose some fight, and the fight was stripped from them when in 64 minutes there was another “gift” Blatchford centred from the line (some thought it was over) and Leyland by driving outwards, completely missed the ball so that Pacey’s task was easy. Three errors, three chances to Orient and three goals. Surely a team capable of scoring on those opportunities deserved to win. Everton had far more chances and yet could take only one – the always ready to have a go Parker. Accepting the fighting spirit of Farrell and occasionally Donovan the whole Everton defence was under form so that the Orient raids looked more dangerous than did prolonged Everton pressure. Everton forwards have played much better as a line and yet not enjoyed so much of the pressure, I guarantee it as three parts of this crazy game was enacted in the Orient goalmouth where Peter Welton, their goalkeeper played the game of his life. Orient folk said afterwards that was Peter’s finest ever. Everton missed chances, plenty of them, but they also made great effort, dozens of them. The tragedy was that three such errors should bring about a defeat as crushing as that at the hands of Crystal Palace in 1922. It will take a lot of league wins to erase the injustice of this defeat at the hands of an indifferent Third Division side. Leyton were a poor team and yet there ability to take that which was offered made them deserving of progress in the end.\n\nEVERTON CHANGES LIKELY\n\nJanuary 17, 1952. The Evening Express\n\nThere will be defensive changes in the Everton ranks, following the club’s fantastic downfall from the F.A. Cup by Leyton Orient at Goodison Park yesterday. Let’s not expect any radical changes but efforts certainly will be made to tighten up the defence. There is no denying that Everton did not deserve to lose yesterday, except that they made the rope for their own backs but by the same argument neither did the Orient for their grand stout, hearted defence.\n\nEVERTON CO-OPTION POLICY\n\nJanuary 18, 1952. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nAlderman Hogan Asks For Enlightenment\n\nAlderman Luke Hogan, a former Lord Major of Liverpool and a shareholder and supporter of Everton F.C, yesterday sent the following letter to Mr. W.R. Williams chairman of the club – “No one can be indifferent to the deep concern felt by all interested in the fortunes of the Everton Football Club and as one who has been asked by many who support the club with its great and honourable traditions, can the chairman please elucidate the one question which would seem to agitate the minds of those not familiar perhaps with all the facts? “My own association as a supporter for more than forty years and my own personal gratitude for the compliment the Everton board paid me will I am sure, indicate that I am not raising this issue in any narrow spirit, nor am I going to enter into the reasons which may or may not be responsible for the temporary decline in the status of the team. “I think we would like to know however, what is the policy of the club in regard to the co-option, as distinct from election of individual members or shareholders to the board of directors?\n\n“Fierce Speeches”\n\n“As a shareholder I have attended meetings of the shareholders Association and have listened to fierce speeches made, i.e. Under no circumstances would such a body ever agree to the principle of co-option being maintained or sustained by the board. “May I quote from a circular issued by the association in 1946 in which this definite statement appears ‘its objects then as now, were to oppose co-option to the board without reference to the shareholders. Another paragraph in the same circular reads. The result of the forthcoming election will decide whether the Everton club is to be governed by a dictatorship or by the general body of shareholders. “Following the election or re-election of members to the board at the last annual general meeting one retiring member failed to secure re-election and a nominee of the Shareholders’ Association was appointed in his stead. Following some internal difficulties we now read that Mr. H. R. Williams has resigned from the board and that his vacancy may be filled by co-option. “Already the vacancy caused by the death of Mr. Lake has been filled by this method, without regard whatever to the genuine interest of the shareholders and it would seem to be playing down to crupt to the shareholders Association an outside body comprising less than 10 per cent of the shareholders members of the club. “If this policy is pursued is it not obviously that the shareholders as a whole are being denied the right of having a voice in the election of the members of the board? It would seem that quite soon there will be three nominees exclusively belonging to the Shareholders Association members who, as stated represented less than 10 per cent of those concerned in the club welfare. “Whilst wishing every success to the club not merely in the distant future but here and now in this year would it not be wise for us to have some definite and declared statement of policy on this issue of co-option? “The other senior club in the city discarded the principle of co-option years ago with credit and success, and surely the general public cannot be completely ignored on a principle of democratic election to the control of nay board of management.”\n\nCHAIRMAN MAKES HIS POINTS\n\nJanuary 18, 1952. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nMr. W. R Williams had not received Alderman Hogan’s letter when I spoke to him last night. After it had been read to him over the telephone he said; “I am grateful to Alderman Hogan for the interest in our club but at present I am not inclined to answer his letter.” Points Mr. Williams made in conversation with me on club policy regarding co-options were;\n\n1. The question which faced the Board following the death of Mr. Lake and the resignation of Mr. Harold Williams was of the possible number of vacancies at the next annual meeting, next June of July. It was felt highly inadvisable to have five vacancies for a Board of nine seats.\n\n2. In Mr. Tom Nuttall and Mr. Cyril Balmforth, both co-opted recently, the club had executive members of the Shareholders’ Association and men well-known to the club for their capabilities and for their active interest and support in it.\n\n3. Everton do not intend to make automatic co-option from members of the Shareholders Association – which is not officially linked with the club –but take their directors as and when the best candidates can be found. It is certain that another vacancy on the Board will be filled shortly.\n\n4. There is no substantial reason why the club should not co-opt directors; the board is unanimous that it would be altogether too perilous to place the club in the position of undergoing violent changes, directorially, next year, or at any time.\n\nEVERTON’S CHANGES FOR CARDIFF CITY VISIT\n\nJanuary 18, 1952. The Evening Express\n\nBy Pilot (Don Kendall)\n\nLeyland, Donovan and Buckle lose their places in Everton’s team res-shuffle, following the defeat in the F.A. Cup and O’Neill, Lello and McNamara are brought back for tomorrow’s League game at Goodison Park against Cardiff City. Altogether there will be four changes, but one is positional, for skipper Peter Farrell switches to right half to allow Lello to come in at left half. O’Neill is back in goal for the first time since Christmas Day, when he played against Doncaster Rovers at belle Vue. This will be Jimmy’s sixth game of the season, while Cyril Lello will be making his seventh appearance after playing inside-right for the reserves recently. McNamara has missed only six League games this season, Lindley heads the centre-half position for his tenth League game of the season. Everton; O’Neill; Clinton, Lindsay; Farrell, Lindley, Lello; McNamara, Fielding, Hickson, Parker, Eglington. Cardiff; Hughes; Rutter, Sherwood; Baker, Montgomery, McLoughlin; Tiddy, Blair, Grant, Sullivan, Williams (R.).\n\nEVERTON’S THREE CHANGES\n\nJanuary 18, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nDonovan, Buckle, and Leyland Dropped for Cardiff City Game\n\nRanger’s Notes\n\nEverton home tomorrow to Cardiff City make three changes –Involving four positions –compared with the side which was beaten in the Cup replay on Wednesday by Leyton Orient. O’Neill returns to goal for the luckless Leyland. Farrell supplants Donovan at right half thus permitting the return of Lello at left half, and McNamara omitted for the Cup-tie is now preferred to Buckle at outside right. Goodison will be a miniature Ninian Park for the visit of Cardiff. The Welsh clubs rise to the top of the Second Division has fixed the imagination and national patriotism of all Welsh people. North Wales in their thousands intend to make a gala day of it, and there will be quite a contingent from South Wales. In the evening those who can manage it might do worse than go along on the Philharmonic for the table tennis international between England and Wales. North Wales folk larger numbers of whom visit this city every week will be suffering a conflict of allegiance. Normally they support Everton, but tomorrow their cheers will be mainly for Cardifff. If Everton will arrange for some Welsh music we may hear the visitors render those stirring songs which always prove so moving prior to the start of Welsh International matches. There is nothing anywhere to beat the fervent melody of a Welsh football. I’m looking forward to it. Talking of moving though in a different sense, Everton must move to the ball quick and take chances more smartly than have been doing recently if they are to have much hope of strengthening the League position at the expense of the Welsh side.\n\nWill They Improve\n\nIt would be in keeping with the uncertainly of football form if, after their disappointing show against Leyton Orient on Wednesday, Everton weighted in with a good victory. But to get it they will have to improve considerably on their replay performance. No side cam make either a present of goals or fritter away their own chances against a team of Cardiff’s calibre and still hope to get anything tangible in the points column. Everton cannot play worse than against Leyton. Despite their position at the head of the table with a point and a game in hand over their nearest challengers Cardiff have not got a particularly brilliant away record. Everton have gathered exactly as many away points as the Welsh men. Cardiff’s only two foreign victories have been against Notts Forest and Blackburn, but they have drawn six times and with the big incentive of promotion are going to be a hard team to beat. To a large extent Cardiff’s success this season has been founded on the excellence of their defence. The attack, while not so outstanding by comparison, is capable of a good crop of goals on occasions and centre forward Grant with 18 goals to his credit is obviously a man who will take some watching. Cardiff make three changes from the side which lost to Swindon in Wednesday’s Cup replay. Howells is injured and Welsh international Iorwerth Hughes who has been out of the side since Christmas returns, to keep goal. Danny Blair resumes at inside right and the left wing berth will be filled by Roley William Edwards being rested. Everton; O’Neill; Clinton, Lindsay; Farrell, Lindley, Lello; McNamara, Fielding, Hickson, Parker, Eglington. Cardiff; Hughes; Rutter, Sherwood, Baker, Montogmery, McLaughlin, Tiddy, Blair, Grant, Sullivan, Williams (R).\n\nReserves Goalkeepers\n\nFor their Central League game against Stoke City at Stoke Everton play Taylor in goal and recall McIntosh to lead the attack. Taylor is a 22-year-old part-time professional who joined the club from Southport junior side year ago. He made a few reserve appearance last season, but this is his first Central league match this campaign. Team; Taylor; Saunders, Rankin; Birch, Woods, Melville; Harris, Potts, McIntosh, Cummins, Easthope.\n\nEverton Co-Option\n\nMr. W.R. Williams Everton chairman is to place Alderman Luke Hogan’s letter regarding co-option before his directorial colleagues at their weekly meeting next Tuesday. Alderman Hogan has asked for a statement of the board’s policy in relation to filling vacancies on the board and has expressed the opinion that co-option ignores the democratic rights of the vast majority of shareholders. Mr. Williams told me he did not wish to discuss Alderman Hogan’s letter at this stage but pointed out –as stated in this column eight days ago –that the board considered it was not in keeping with a club of Everton’s standing that a position should arise in which five vacancies required filling at the next annual meeting. He further added that the board did not intend to confine any future co-options to solely members of the Shareholders Association. They would choose the best candidate available.\n\nNew Association\n\nFor some months moves have been going on to form a new association of Everton followers, but not limited to shareholders alone, as is the case with the existing Shareholders Association. This has now taken concrete shape in the forms of a circular received this morning by many shareholders, over the signature of Mr. L. B. Osborne of 110 Portelet Road, Liverpool 13, who is described as secretary pro tem. Known as the “Everton shareholders and Supporters Federation, the new organization declares its objects as being (1) To assist Everton in every possible way, and (2) to promote social amentias. The circular adds that the new federation will oppose the filling of directorial vacancies without the matter being referred to a general meeting of shareholders and recalls a promise to this effect being made some years ago.\n\nTHE PRACTICAL EVERTON\n\nJanuary 21, 1952. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nEverton 3, Cardiff City 0\n\nBy Leslie Edwards.\n\nThe strangest thing about this game was not the fact that wild ducks flew low over the stands or that Everton should rehabilitate themselves against the Second Division leaders but was that two sides, each of which had been beaten four days earlier by a Third Division team should attract the day’s second highest attendance –a few short of 50,000. For this Everton have to thank long established popularity with people in North Wales. These folk come to Goodison Park as and when they can. With Cardiff City here their attendance was a necessity. Not for years has an Everton club game half such atmosphere but the traditional airs died away to double pianissimo long before the end when even Welshmen sensed that this at least, was not to be a great Welsh victory, I do not doubt that the Welsh win at Twickenham (which offered the T.V. viewer an excellent sight of fantastically fast running by one Morgan) would more than restore the prestige left at Everton. This Everton was far from being the timid, ineffective force which was made to bow itself out of the F.A. Cup. It showed a refreshing inclination and ability to do the simple things of football with no delay and no eye to the gallery.\n\nThe Vital Element\n\nThe centring chance was taken as soon as it appeared; the shooting chance was used quickly and before allowing the defence to consolidate itself in readiness. Persisting in this spirit of urgency and letting others make the too frequent lateral and reverse passes which leave opponents to use a vital element of time Everton are always capable of heating such sides as Cardiff. They won quite as handsomely as 3-0 indicates; indeed the Llandudno boy Iorwerth Hughes kept a good goal to starve off further disaster. Cardiff City were contradictory and disappointing. Their defence a good-one by repute, was beaten too often and the attack although having class and ability hardly ever finished it’s job satisfactorily. It moved nicely in combined fashion, so often one sensed that sooner or later a goal would come, but always when confronted by the necessity of having to make the vital pass or shot, it was totally unproductive. Everton with Lello in the half back line and O’Neill in goal, were constantly ending their work, adequately. The Hickson header from an Eglington centre was moving so fast Hughes could only go through the motions of attempting to stop it. Given a free course to a ball like this with room to manoecurve, Hickson’s high leap and the sure touch of his forehead, is good for a goal nearly every time.\n\nNo Penalty\n\nCardiff claimed a penalty when Lindley, arms outstretched characteristically, faced Grant and was adjudged to have handled, in the penalty area. The referee was never rightly I imagine than when he waved play on. The intent to handle, was not there, had it been Lindley would have had to think like lightning to commit the offence. Clinton’s penalty shot was an odd one in that he walked to the ball as though to examine its placing, but after a stride or two he hit it home, via Hughes hands, for the second goal. I think Montgomery’s handling of Hickson’s shot was wise. The ball would surely have found a place under the goal angle. Everton’s final point was a fine one and put McNamara into the spectators good books. Fielding did well to sense Parker’s through pass; he did better to fling it, as he ran high towards the far post where McNamara leaped spectacularly to nod the goal. Cardiff City had but one real chance to console themselves and they missed it. On this showing the side may not after all return as everyone hopes to Division 1. If Everton will only make a priority of playing in this severely practical way they will go a long way towards restoring their lost prestige, their lost support and the unruffled atmosphere which must arise again when they are back where they belong.\n\n• Everton “A” 0, Earle 1\n\n• Prescot O.B. 0, Everton “B” 2\n\n• Linacre F.C 0, Everton “C” 8\n\nMASTER MOVE\n\nJanuary 21, 1952. Evening Express\n\nPilot’s Log (Don Kendall)\n\nEverton made a master move in the switch of Peter Farrell to right half against Cardiff and the re-introduction of Cyril Lello. It was one of the main factors in this great return to form. Peter, on the right was able to bring his right this best foot into action better, and we saw him bringing better variety into his constructive play and exploiting the cross-field pass so expertly, while Lello emphasized that there was wisdom in giving him plenty of time to play himself back into the game after his serious injury. Cyril is no back to his best, and yet would be the first to agree that much of his success in this game was due to the man in front of him, John Willie Parker. This was Parker’s best to date without a doubt, the result no doubt of the fact that he has done exactly what he wanted him to do –speed up. How else could he have covered so much ground? Parker was the fetcher and carrier; the strong man in the clock work, and yet was always there to add punch in the goalmouth. He and Lello helped to bring Tommy Eglington back to his sparkling best. There was the old Eglington confidence, as witness that almost cheeky bout of passing between himself and Lello before he laid on Dave Hickson’s goal. Hickson is another who crashed back to his best and had Montgomery tied up into knots as he thrived on the stream of the up the middle passes. Hickson was always doing the right thing in this game, even if he did try those right things too quickly at times. McNamara took half the game to solve the Sherwood puzzle but one of the reasons was that Fielding took a similar time to get into the game. The Fielding passes went astray repeatedly until the second half when he drew so much of the Sherwood attention, that McNamara was able to get weaving. This without doubt was a really good Everton attack against a side noted for its solidity in defences. Tommy Clinton had a utting reward for an almost inspired full back display. It was his first-ever goal, Hickson would have had his second goal but for Alf Sherwwod’s agile goalkeeping act, and with Ted Buckle sitting in front of him in the stand, we wondered who would take the penalty. Well, Tommy has been perfecting the art in practice and when I saw perfecting I meant it. He believes in the old saying “hit em” hard enough and they’ll go in. He did after a rather sideways step to the ball. After this I am confident that the penalties in the Blues future are as good as goals. Everton’s most consistent penalty taker for years was also a right back, Billy Cook. After the Clinton goal came the epic –as grand a goal as one could ever wish to see; so good, in fact that it is worthy of description again. Hickson dropped back to the left to turn quickly with the ball and slip it to Parker. They made ground as they inter-passed. Eglington moved up to the centre forward position and so Fielding with a spot of quick thinking, skated across field to make the open space on the left his own. His journey was not in vain, for the ball was slipped through to him along the floor as accurately as if it had been carried. Unhesitatingly, Fielding made a first time fast centre which the alert McNamara racing in at top speed took on his forehead and Hughes had no more chance of saying than I had. Yet friends a mighty goal such as the Blues used to provide so often during those goals riots of 1931-32. It showed that all the old arts are not lost to football. It emphasized the Everton way of things in this game, it was forward, forward, all the time.\n\nTOP MARKS FOR BLUES\n\nJanuary 21, 1952. The Liverpool Echo\n\nRangers Notes\n\nEverton will soon be getting the same “unpredictability” reputation as Liverpool if they go on as they have been doing lately, for after the shocking display against Leyton they gave an extremely good one against Cardiff City. This was an entirely different Everton. There was understanding in the attack plenty of good shooting constructive work from the wing halves, and –most vital of all –a tip-top display by O’Neill in goal. The Irishman never showed the slightest trace of nerves or indecision. He plucked centre after centre from the air with complete reliability, saved a few hot shots –Cardiff did not produce many – and gave confidence to the men in front of him. There was not a great deal of difference between the sides for the first hour, during 19 minutes of which Everton led through Hickson’s finely-headed goal off Eglington’s centre. Then Sherwood’s “Save” of Hickson’s shot brought Clinton’s penalty effort which Hughes touched but could not stop, and thereafter it was almost one-way traffic. McNamara’s header from Fielding’s centre was another grand goal, and with Everton well on top Cardiff were made to look anything but a possible promotion prospect. This was more like what we expect from the Blues. Now it is up to them to “keep the pot boiling.” A visiting South Wales journalist told me that he reckoned Everton on that showing were one of the three best sides Cardiff had met this season. Refraining from saying it was a good job he had not seen them against leyton I agreed when he added that on such form they should soon be climbing the table. The trouble for some years past, however has been that their form has fluctuated too violently.\n\nConsistency is Vital\n\nA spell of good play has been followed by a run of mediocre games and vice versa. If only the team could settle down to a reasonable measure of consistency a lot of problems and anxiety would disappear. Hickson was a grand leader of the attack, reminiscent in some ways, if not in artistry, of Stan Mortensen. His speed over a short burst is amazing and his courage in fighting for possession of every ball not only inspires his colleagues but rattles the opposing defence. He is just the type who would make a big difference to Liverpool’s attack, which so lacks challenging fight in some positions. Some good chances were missed of course. That often happens with the finest of teams. If only Eglington could take scoring openings as well as he carves them out he would be a record wing marksman. Ly Parker did well. Fielding was off with his shooting, but at least did try, the wing halves were sound, and Lindley and the backs could rarely be faulted. In short, Everton put themselves back in favour with their supporters. A few more displays like this and the memory of the Leyton debacle will soon be largely wiped out. On this display Cardiff did not impress as likely to stick the promotion pace. Their defence is quite good, but the forwards had little plan, punch or pertinacity. Their short passing game was too fanciful and even when they had easy chances their shooting was poor. I wonder whether the state of the ground had anything to do with Everton’s improved display? It was the first time for some weeks that it"
