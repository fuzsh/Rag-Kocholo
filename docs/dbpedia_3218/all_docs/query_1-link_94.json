        "text": "David Scott Curtis passed away peacefully and unexpectedly at home in Branchburg, NJ on Thursday, March 16, at the young age of 50.\n\nDavid was born in Summit, NJ on September 15, 1972 and was the son of Jane W. Curtis of New Providence, NJ, formerly of Westfield and the late G. Graydon Curtis. David was raised in Westfield and attended Tamaques Elementary School. As a young boy, he loved playing outdoors with his neighborhood friends. He played on local soccer and baseball teams, joined scouting and grew up as a member of The Presbyterian Church in Westfield. In the summers, he attended Camp Belknap on Lake Winnipesaukee, NH where he developed his great love of the outdoors. Memorable family vacations included ski trips to Stowe, VT and a month-long car trip out West.\n\nDavid attended The Pingry School from seventh through twelfth grades graduating as a member of the Class of 1990, where from 1996 to present he was a Class Trustee and Class Agent. While there, he was a goalie for the lacrosse team, and he began fencing saber, a sport he loved passionately rising ultimately to compete on the US Junior World Cup Fencing Teams multiple times, and in The World Cup saber finals in Budapest, Hungary. During these years, David also became an Eagle Scout as a member of Troup 72 and was recognized as New Jersey’s Scout of the Year. He attended Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico.\n\nDavid went on to attend and fence at Cornell University majoring in Philosophy; he was a member of Delta Chi fraternity.\n\nHe met the love of his life, Karen Linck, of Cranford in 1994 and they were married in 2004. He was the proud father of two wonderful children, Katharine (Katie), age 16 and Alexander, age 13.\n\nDavid was an avid outdoorsman; his passions included fly fishing, fishing in the Florida Keys, birding and spending time outdoors with his dogs. He received an honorarium to work for the National Park Service for a time in Sequoia National Park. At the time of his death, David was a member of Hudson Farm Club in Andover, NJ, the National Society Sons of the American Revolution and a member of numerous Boards of Directors.\n\nDavid began his professional career in medical diagnostics, before becoming a trailblazer in the field of digital marketing. He proudly founded Blue Pig Media in 2008 and was at the time of his death its CEO. Blue Pig Media is a firm which focuses on search engine optimization, pay per click, content management, paid social, web development and digital marketing.\n\nDavid is also survived by his sister, Susan and niece Kathryn Tonking of Westfield, as well as brothers-in-law Ronald Linck (children Hailey, Brian and Lily) and Kenneth Linck and members of his extended family including an aunt, uncle and four cousins, all of whom he loved dearly. He was additionally predeceased by his grandparents G. Graydon and Dorothea Curtis and C. Harold and Margaret Wherly.\n\nDavid was fortunate to have counted hundreds of people in his network as personal friends and mentors, including professional colleagues and contacts spanning the globe and from all walks of his life. His business travels had him criss crossing the United States and making frequent trips to Europe, even including a presentation to the House of Commons in the United Kingdom. David was loved by many, and encouraged and supported throughout his life; in turn, he was always ready to lend a helping hand to anyone in need.\n\nThere will be a memorial/celebration of life service of remembrance on Saturday, April 1 at 11AM in the sanctuary of The Presbyterian Church in Westfield, 140 Mountain Avenue.
