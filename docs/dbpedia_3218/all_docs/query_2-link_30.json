As the industry continues to grow, MSU Denver’s Aviation and Aerospace Science Department (AVS) has reimagined possibilities by evolving into one of the largest and most sophisticated programs in the country – all the while remaining the most affordable program of its kind.\n\nIt’s no mystery why MSU Denver’s aviation program is recognized for its excellence. Our students have access to unrivaled resources no other university in Colorado can offer; such as the most innovative flight simulation training laboratories in the world, an on-campus satellite engineering lab and partnerships with the industry that grants students access to the same advanced technology and software used at NASA. We’ve invested $40 million worth of technology so that our graduates will soar on their first day on the job.\n\nOur close relationships with nearby aerospace contractors – including York Space Systems, Lockheed Martin, Booze Allen Hamilton, Ball Aerospace, and Raytheon, to our long standing relationships with aeronautical companies – such as Jeppesen-Boeing, United Airlines, Envoy, Mesa Airlines, Air Wisconsin, and Republic Airlines – translates into incredible internship opportunities for students and job opportunities for graduates. At MSU Denver, we have everything in place to ensure the best possible education in aviation and aerospace science; so, jump on board and watch your career take off."
