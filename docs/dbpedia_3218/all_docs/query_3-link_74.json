        "text": "Really looking forward to the Contentious Trusts Association (\"ConTrA\") conference this week in Birmingham and, in particular, Natasha McKeever's talk with Hugh Series and Alex Troup KC on Will challenges.\n\nJonathan Kitchin and I have co-written a piece on unfair prejudice titled: \"Unfair treatment by fellow shareholders\", which appears as the first article in Michelmores' latest edition of AgriLore. Whilst aimed at agricultural businesses, it's of relevance to anyone involved in the running of a business. The other excellent articles focus on animal liability, telecoms, tenancies (residential and agricultural), proprietary estoppel, wild camping and rights of way. Thank you to Charlotte Razay and Caroline Baines for their work on the publication more generally and to my colleague William Rees for his helpful comments. https://lnkd.in/eDG_CSdZ\n\nGreat to be part of the Michelmores 5k Charity Run yesterday and to run alongside my Commercial Disputes colleagues Abigail Brown and Emily Edwards. A personal achievement completing my first 5km since an ankle reconstruction and, more importantly, raising money for our charity partner FearFree. Thank you to all those who helped organise the event - Harriet Goodall Naomi Morris Rosie Brice #mm5k\n\nOur new brand video fits with the Michelmores that I know - having trained here and qualified into our Band 1 (South-West) ranked Commercial Disputes team. That ranking puts us alongside Burges Salmon and Osborne Clarke - two amazing firms. It is reflective of our ability to advise on top national and international disputes whilst genuinely caring about our clients and colleagues."
