        "text": "Description\n\nBorn in Forfar, winger Alec Troup played junior football with Forfar North End in 1913, joining hometown professional club Forfar Athletic in 1914 and from there moving to Dundee a year later. In a scintillating performance on the first day of the 1915-16 season Troup set up the first goal for centre-forward Davie Brown before adding a second himself, a goal which The Courier described as “an outstandingly brilliant goal”, in a 2-0 win over Ayr United in front of 5,000 at Dens Park.\n\nOver the next two seasons Troup played forty-one times for Dundee before he volunteered for military service and was called up to join the Royal Engineers. His last game before leaving for basic training at Largs on the Ayrshire coast, where he spent time on loan at Ayr United in 1916, was against Hearts at Tynecastle on December 16th 1917 but he turned out again for The Dark Blues when they played nearby Ayr United in February before being sent to the Western Front, where he played in inter-regiment matches for the 13th Reinforcement Company Royal Engineers and managed to survive the maelstrom before returning to Dundee in 1919.\n\nHe became a real hero of the people at Dens Park, being a wonderfully tricky winger whose sparkling play, gentlemanly demeanour, good humour and extremely likeable personality and was known as “Wee Troupie” due to his small stature. He won his first Scotland cap in April 1920 in a 5-4 defeat to England at Hillsborough. He won 3 more caps between February 1921 and March 1922. He first represented The Scottish League in January 1921 against The Irish League, winning his second cap that October against the same opposition, both games finishing in 3-0 victories."
