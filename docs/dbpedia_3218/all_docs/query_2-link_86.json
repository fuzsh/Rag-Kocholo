        "text": "Hannah’s dad is her main shooting partner, and they rarely shoot apart, and has supported her from the start of her career. They’ve shot all over the UK as a Father and daughter team, Hannah said, “I respect his opinions because he knows me so well, he understands how I think and reads me. He knows what to say to me, and that really can help me when I’m shooting.”\n\nThis year, she made the British and England teams, and would love to shoot in the USA. She follows The Pro Tour (the Professional Sporting Clays Association), and said, “they are really well set up, and it is amazing what they do for their shooters and the sport, it’d be great to see something similar in the UK.”\n\n“I am a massively competitive person, and push myself. There’s nothing better than the feeling of hitting a target and I really do get a buzz out of it” said Hannah.\n\nOutside of the clay shooting season, Hannah shoots once a fortnight, and juggles her busy schedule with loading on shoot days for local sporting estates. “I really enjoy being outdoors and meeting people, it’s great to be standing with someone when they hit their first bird and you are part of that memory.”\n\nHer partner, Alex, is gamekeeper, and when she is not helping him out with the birds and gundogs, she enjoys going out stalking and is fortunate to have four species of deer on their local ground. “Last year I got into it, I went out stalking with my other half. I enjoy seeing the deer but also gaining an understanding of why I’m shooting the animal and how important deer management is. You have to understand their way of thinking, be aware of the wind direction and outsmart them.”\n\nWho is our author Linda Mellor?\n\nLinda Mellor is one of Scotland’s foremost shooting, fishing and hunting female writers and photographers.
