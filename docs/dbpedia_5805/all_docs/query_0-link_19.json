Mehrhoff, University of Connecticut, Bugwood.org.\n\nIdentification:\n\nDeciduous small tree or shrub – can reach 25 feet tall.\n\nLeaves are dark- green, oval and slightly toothed.\n\nIn spring, small, yellow-green, 4-petaled flowers grow in clusters of 2-6 at the base of leaves.\n\nSmall, purple to black fruits ripen in the fall.\n\nTwigs often have a single, sharp thorn at their tip.\n\nDistinctive orange inner bark.\n\nHabitat: Common buckthorn can be found in disturbed and undisturbed areas including roadsides, pastures, old fields and woodlots.\n\nNative Range: Europe and Asia.\n\nU. S. Distribution: East Coast and Midwest, also in limited areas of California and Oregon.\n\nLocal Concern: This invasive plant spreads quickly through seeds distributed by birds and wildlife and crowds out native shrubs and understory plants. It is a host for alfalfa mosaic virus and crown fungus, and may be a possible host for the soybean aphid.\n\nMORE INFORMATION:\n\nCommon Buckthorn Invasive Species Alert - Printable PDF"
