        "text": "So a couple weeks ago I went Yamadori scouting in and around my parents' property. Lots of overgrown fields and patches of woods. One species I had in mind on this walk was this one, though I was unable to identify it until now. Common Buckthorn or Rhamnus cathartica. It is an exotic invasive here in the Americas, originally native to europe and was brought here as an ornamental tree apparently. It grows like a weed around my parents property. It is a small tree, does not get very much taller than 25 feet as I've seen it around here. Reminds me of Hawthorn when I see a mature tree... smaller in stature but wild and gnarly in character.\n\nThe Bark seems to mature to a rough and gnarled almost black color quite quickly and in contrast the leaves are quite small and delicate looking (~2inches long, oval shaped and smooth, perfectly sized for bonsai), which I love that stark contrast between trunk and foliage.\n\nI suppose the reason why I am putting all this detail in is that I have been very very hard-strapped to find any other instances of people using this species as bonsai. Which if they grow like they do around here in other areas I would hope someone would have ripped one out of the ground by now to experiment. But these are the two threads i've really been able to find, which are completely lacking:\n\nhttp://bonsainut.com/forums/showthr...nsai-(Rhamnus-cathartica)&highlight=buckthorn\n\nhttp://ibonsaiclub.forumotion.com/t2976-buckthornrhamnus-cathartica-as-bonsai\n\nHere's the Yamadori I've fallen in love with:\n\nThe pictures make it look smaller than it actually is I feel. I have to remember to bring a soda can with me next time I go hiking. I think the trunk base is probably 7 or 8 inches across, and where the second branch up departs from the main trunk is definitely over a foot off the ground. I believe I could achieve really great, dramatic taper rather quickly by chopping the main trunk above the second branch.\n\nI'm thinking that I will chop the main trunk this spring, as well as the second branch to some degree (this branch will serve as the new apex trunk/leader) and will chop the first branch (on the right in pic 1) as well. Although I am considering keeping the first branch on to further develop taper. This may not be necessary at all though. Thoughts???\n\nPS.\n\nHere's someone else's decent collection of photos of Common Buckthorn Foliage and fruits, etc (I'll have to remember to take pictures when the leave are still on the tree!): http://flickrhivemind.net/Tags/rhamnuscathartica/Interesting\n\nI guess the point of me posting this thread was to see if anyone out there has any experience with this species at all, specifically collecting.\n\nI'm debating whether I should completely collect the tree this spring and get it into a training pot, OR if I should just cut it back really hard, dig a trench and sever the major roots, then let it recover for another year and collect it the next spring. The longer time frame wouldn't be an issue as it is growing on my parents property. On the other hand there are tons of common buckthorn growing around here too, so losing this one wouldn't be completely detrimental. It's just the nicest trunk I've found so far.\n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPS.\n\nThis is the only image I've been able to find of this specific species as bonsai, keep in mind the trunk on the one I'm going to collect is substantially wider than this one:\n\nand the photographer's page: http://www.flickr.com/photos/25360950@N06/2820005474\n\nWhile I may not have any experience working with buckthorn, here's something to think about when collecting (some of this I learned the hard way).\n\nIf you are collecting a big, mature trunk on a relatively \"unknown\" species, it stands to reason that you want to figure out the best way to do it so the tree can recoup more easily, since older trees don't generally respond to collection with the same vigor younger trees do.\n\nOne way to do this is to test out different collection techniques on smaller \"guinea pig\" trees in the general area. This means you might have to put off collection of the larger specimen for a season or two, but having the knowledge to remove it safely IMHO is worth the wait. (plus, you can later experiment with different pruning/styling techniques on the experiment trees to see how the big tree might react)\n\nDon't feel bad. I'm not that old, and I don't know who he is either... or... I am older than I think?!?\n\nHopefully this survives the harvest. Can't wait to see how this progresses.\n\nI don't think age is a necessary factor in this, maybe just that you are or were slightly nerdy at one point. Jet is a character from a really highly regarded anime (japanese animation) show. Who has a robotic arm and also happens to enjoy bonsai. Haha.\n\nAnd thanks. Since Buckthorn is rather aggressively invasive, at least in the area where I found this tree, I'm hoping that means this species is pretty resilient. When faced with sharp saws! But I think I will probably just work it while it's still in the ground this coming growing season. Sever some of the major lateral roots with a trench, and chop back the trunks to some degree. That way I can at least spare it from losing all it's foliage and most of it's roots in one go.\n\nSo how did it go. I found a couple near me that has been trimmed back by deer over the years and are all gnarly and really cool looking. I was going to try to Tony tickle technique and put them in a black bag\n\nDid you do it? I just found a filed full of them, construction site so they all will be dead soon. I'm considering taking one up to train, same reasons as you- the deer pruned them nicely so the trunks are somewhat thick and cool looking. I'm not sure about the thorns to be honest, but the sprouting leaves are beautiful. The older trees that are growing there also very pretty to look at."
