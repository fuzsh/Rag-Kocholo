        "text": "Biological Control\n\nThere is currently no single optimal biological control agent in use against this species. (3)\n\nManual or Mechanical Control\n\nPulling / Digging Up: Pulling by hand or via a weed wrench is an effective method of control for seedlings and smaller plants.\n\nMowing: Regular mowing, particularly in open areas will reduce or halt fruiting. Successive cuttings, at least 2 for at least 3 years, will reduce the size and density of common buckthorn infestations but will likely not eradicate it. (8)\n\nGirdling: Larger stems may be girdled and re-sprouts clipped or sprayed as they emerge. (8)\n\nPrescribed Fire: Fire will top kill the species and re-sprouting will occur. (3)\n\nPrescribed Grazing: Common buckthorn may be browsed by deer, particularly in open environments, however, it is not a preferred species. The species is poisonous to some livestock, such as horses. (3)\n\nSoil Tilling: Not advisable. Tilling will fragment roots and encourage re-sprouting. It will also expose more seeds for germination. (8)\n\nMulching: Not applicable\n\nSolarization: Not applicable\n\nHot Foam Spray: Not applicable\n\nChemical Control\n\nThe pesticide application rates and usage herein are recommendations based on research and interviews with land managers. When considering the use of pesticides, it is your responsibility to fully understand the laws, regulations and best practices required to apply pesticides in a responsible manner. At times, the pest you seek to treat may not be on a pesticide label, requiring a 2ee exemption from NYSDEC. Always thoroughly read the label of any pesticide and consult the NYSDEC or a licensed pesticide applicator with questions.\n\nFoliar Spray: A 2% solution of glyphosate or triclopyr is effective at managing small plants of common buckthorn, although repeat applications may be necessary. Infestations managed in this way should be revisited in 2-3 weeks to monitor for regrowth. Always read and follow all instructions on the herbicide label. (9)\n\nCut Stump: A 50% solution of glyphosate or triclopyr is effective at managing larger plants when applied in the late summer or fall. (9)\n\nBasal Bark: A 30% solution of triclopyr in oil is effective on smaller shrubs (i.e. less than 6 inches in diameter) when applied between midsummer and December. (9)\n\nHack-And-Squirt\n\nStem Injection: Not applicable\n\nPre-Emergent Spray: Not applicable\n\nGeneral management overview and recommendation\n\nAs with any other invasive infestation complex, large stands of common buckthorn are best managed via a combination of mechanical and chemical means. Small seedlings and plants can be hand pulled or removed using a weed wrench while larger shrubs must be cut and sprayed, either with a basal bark or cut stump application, to attain good control. All managed infestations should be monitored to ensure exhaustion of the seed bank for at least two years and to prevent reinvasion from nearby populations. Any new seedlings can be hand pulled or sprayed.\n\nPost treatment monitoring\n\nAny infestations managed by chemical means must be revisited in 2-3 weeks to check for treatment efficacy, unless the application occurred during dormancy, in which case, follow-up during the growing season will be necessary. Infestations managed solely by mechanical or physical means will need consistent follow up treatment to manage root suckers and sprouts. Due to the long-distance dispersal mechanisms of common buckthorn, managed infestations must be checked for reinvasion.\n\nDisposal Methods\n\nWaste material can be burned, chipped or composted so long as management was completed prior to seed set. Any fruit must be bagged and disposed of. All roots must be thoroughly dried and or crushed."
