        "text": "Do you see...? Leaves Breaking leaf buds\n\nOne or more breaking leaf buds are visible on the plant. A leaf bud is considered \"breaking\" once a green leaf tip is visible at the end of the bud, but before the first leaf from the bud has unfolded to expose the leaf base at its point of attachment to the leaf stalk (petiole) or stem.\n\nMore...\n\nHow many buds are breaking?\n\nLess than 3\n\n3 to 10\n\n11 to 100\n\n101 to 1,000\n\n1,001 to 10,000\n\nMore than 10,000\n\nLeaves\n\nOne or more live, unfolded leaves are visible on the plant. A leaf is considered \"unfolded\" once its entire length has emerged from a breaking bud, stem node or growing stem tip, so that the leaf base is visible at its point of attachment to the leaf stalk (petiole) or stem. Do not include fully dried or dead leaves.\n\nMore...\n\nWhat percentage of the potential canopy space is full with leaves? Ignore dead branches in your estimate of potential canopy space.\n\nLess than 5%\n\n5-24%\n\n25-49%\n\n50-74%\n\n75-94%\n\n95% or more\n\nIncreasing leaf size\n\nA majority of leaves on the plant have not yet reached their full size and are still growing larger. Do not include new leaves that continue to emerge at the ends of elongating stems throughout the growing season.\n\nMore...\n\nWhat percentage of full size are most leaves?\n\nLess than 25%\n\n25-49%\n\n50-74%\n\n75-94%\n\n95% or more\n\nColored leaves\n\nOne or more leaves show some of their typical late-season color, or yellow or brown due to drought or other stresses. Do not include small spots of color due to minor leaf damage, or dieback on branches that have broken. Do not include fully dried or dead leaves that remain on the plant.\n\nMore...\n\nWhat percentage of the potential canopy space is full with non-green leaf color? Ignore dead branches in your estimate of potential canopy space.\n\nLess than 5%\n\n5-24%\n\n25-49%\n\n50-74%\n\n75-94%\n\n95% or more\n\nFalling leaves\n\nOne or more leaves with typical late-season color, or yellow or brown due to other stresses, are falling or have recently fallen from the plant. Do not include fully dried or dead leaves that remain on the plant for many days before falling.\n\nMore...\n\nFlowers Flowers or flower buds\n\nOne or more fresh open or unopened flowers or flower buds are visible on the plant. Include flower buds or inflorescences that are swelling or expanding, but do not include those that are tightly closed and not actively growing (dormant). Also do not include wilted or dried flowers.\n\nMore...\n\nHow many flowers and flower buds are present? For species in which individual flowers are clustered in flower heads, spikes or catkins (inflorescences), simply estimate the number of flower heads, spikes or catkins and not the number of individual flowers.\n\nLess than 3\n\n3 to 10\n\n11 to 100\n\n101 to 1,000\n\n1,001 to 10,000\n\nMore than 10,000\n\nOpen flowers\n\nOne or more open, fresh flowers are visible on the plant. Flowers are considered \"open\" when the reproductive parts (male stamens or female pistils) are visible between or within unfolded or open flower parts (petals, floral tubes or sepals). Do not include wilted or dried flowers.\n\nMore...\n\nWhat percentage of all fresh flowers (buds plus unopened plus open) on the plant are open? For species in which individual flowers are clustered in flower heads, spikes or catkins (inflorescences), estimate the percentage of all individual flowers that are open.\n\nLess than 5%\n\n5-24%\n\n25-49%\n\n50-74%\n\n75-94%\n\n95% or more\n\nFruits Fruits\n\nOne or more fruits are visible on the plant. For Rhamnus cathartica, the fruit is berry-like and changes from green to black.\n\nMore...\n\nHow many fruits are present?\n\nLess than 3\n\n3 to 10\n\n11 to 100\n\n101 to 1,000\n\n1,001 to 10,000\n\nMore than 10,000\n\nRipe fruits\n\nOne or more ripe fruits are visible on the plant. For Rhamnus cathartica, a fruit is considered ripe when it has turned black.\n\nMore...\n\nWhat percentage of all fruits (unripe plus ripe) on the plant are ripe?\n\nLess than 5%\n\n5-24%\n\n25-49%\n\n50-74%\n\n75-94%\n\n95% or more"
