        "text": "Flower:\n\nFlowers are small, ¼ inch or less across, yellowish green, 5 pointed and star-like, short stalked, in clusters of 1 to 3 in the leaf axils of new growth. There are no petals, the triangular star points are sepals set around a flattened, saucer like recepticle. Male and female flowers are on separate plants, the male flowers with 5 yellowish stamens surrounding a green center, females with a 3-parted style in the center.\n\nLeaves and bark:\n\nLeaves are simple and alternate, oval or oblong lance-elliptic, 2 to 4½ inches long and ¾ to 2¼ inches wide, the edges with rounded teeth, with or without glands in the serrations, and 5 to 8 veins per side. The upper surface is darker green, appearing shiny or with sparse hairs; the lower surface is lighter green with hairs typically present.\n\nAt the base of the leaf stalk of new growth is a pair of narrow, leafy appendages (stipules). Main branching stems are horizontally spreading, typically less than 1 inch in diameter at the base with thin, roughish red-brown to gray bark. Side branches are erect, spindly, and thornless. New growth is green or brownish with minute hairs turning grayish brown the second year.\n\nFruit:\n\nFruit is a short-stalked, shiny, black berry up to 1/3 inch in diameter, with 1 to 3 seeds inside. The berry is often irregularly slightly lobed with a faint groove on the surface between each seed.\n\nNotes:"
