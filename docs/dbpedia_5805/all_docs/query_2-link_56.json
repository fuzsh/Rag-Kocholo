        "text": "Ornamental, thorny shrub to shape hedges, edges and rockery. A purgative syrup is made for pets from its fruit. The wood is used as firewood and coal. It is also useful for marquetry works and turnery. It is not recommended for domestic use.\n\nDeciduous shrub growing up to 8m with abundant little yellow-greenish flowers. Oval and serrated leaves with red and black berries filled with seeds.\n\nDig a hole at least two or three times as wide and deep as the root ball. Take out the plant from the container and loosen roots to allow them to spread out in all direction. Cut possible broken roots. Mix the soil extracted with a substrate and fill part of the hole with the mixture obtained. Place the plant in the hole and cover with the remaining mixture. Compact the soil around the plant and water thoroughly."
