        "text": "(PDF version of this page)\n\nEcological Impact\n\nCasts dense shade which reduces the growth and survival of native shrubs and trees;\n\nLeafs out so early that even spring ephemerals are impacted;\n\nChanges soil characteristics making soil inhospitable to other plant life;\n\nWorks like a laxative on birds which spread the seeds and stain outdoor furnishings.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nCommon buckthorn is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can reach 22 feet in height with a trunk up to 10 inches wide. Its bark is gray to brown and looks like that of plum or wild cherry. A spine often tips the twig of common buckthorn. Buckthorn’s inner bark is yellow, and the heartwood is pink to orange.\n\nLeaves are dark green, broadly oval, and may have pointed or rounded tips with toothed edges. A reliable indicator for identification is its green foliage late in autumn after native shrubs have lost their leaves.\n\nBuckthorn has a long growing season, leafing out before native plants have broken dormancy and retaining its leaves until late fall. Its foliage creates dense shade in which wildflowers, grasses, and shrubs are unable to thrive. Buckthorn’s shade also prevents growth of young oaks and hickories.\n\nProlific seed production allows buckthorn to flourish. Female specimens produce numerous small, black, berry-like fruits most of which fall directly under the shrubs creating an impenetrable mass of seedlings; birds eat other fruits and carry them far beyond the mother shrub. Because birds have difficulty digesting the fruits, they rapidly expel the seeds (note the species epithet, cathartica). Thus, the shrubs reproduce and spread rapidly.\n\nControl Methods for Common Buckthorn"
