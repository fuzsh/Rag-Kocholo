        "text": "Common Buckthorn leaves are dark-green and glossy, with a finely toothed edging, turning yellow before they fall in Autumn. Being a dioecious plant, both male and female flowers are found on separate plants. They will appear as small, yellow-green blooms with small petals.\n\nSoon after pollination, Common Buckthorn's female flowers will then develop into dark, black berries. The seed from these berries are willingly then scattered by the birds.\n\nPrune your Common Buckthorn plant in Summer as to avoid the risk of bleeding from cuts- well established hedging will need very little pruning, but this depends on the plant height desired. All you will need to do is remove any diseased, dead, crossing, damaged, or congested shoots- those growing out of the desired shape can also be pruned out. You will not need to carry out a pruning routine.\n\nWe do recommend adding some mulch and feed, however, after pruning. This will maintain overall health."
