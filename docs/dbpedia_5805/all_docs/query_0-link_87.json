        "text": "Purging Buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) gets its name from the purging effect of the berries which are safe for livestock but definitely not recommended for human consumption – and actually, this species is not recommended for horse paddocks either.\n\nThis native common or Purging Buckthorn is a terrific hedgerow species or woodland shrub with spiny branches, wildlife friendly flowers which are late in the season so are good for extending the season, and shiny berries in autumn the size of blueberries. The leaves are the main food of brimstone blue butterflies so if you want to do your bit for butterflies, you can include some of these plants in with a mixed native hedgerow pack, or plant a few in the garden or woodland area. This species has very dense growth so makes a good nesting site for birds, with butterfly caterpillars on hand for feeding their young!\n\nIt likes a moist site, even beside a stream, in sunshine or shade.\n\nIf left to grow as a woodland shrub, it will grow up to about 10m in height.\n\nHedge Nursery has supplied very large quantities of British grown bare root Purging Buckthorn plants over many years – our reviews are excellent, and you can buy with confidence knowing that you will receive top quality plants. You can read more about bare root plants and how they are grown here.\n\nDELIVERY CHARGES ARE CALCULATED AUTOMATICALLY AT CHECK OUT\n\nOur delivery charges and the kick-in points for free delivery are highly competitive. About 90% of our orders get free delivery.\n\nPlant TypeUK Mainland (excl. Scottish Highlands and Islands)Scottish Highlands Bare root plants shorter than 100cm, all cell grown plants, plants in pots up to 7 Litres £7.99 (Free over £60) £14.99 (Free over £150) Bare root plants 100-120cm £14.99 (Free over £300) £29.99 (Free over £300) Bare root plants taller than 120cm, plants in pots larger than 7.5 Litres, all root ball plants and instant hedging £59.99 (Free over £350) £112.99\n\nNotes:\n\nAll prices include VAT.\n\nOrders of plants requiring delivery on pallets (bare root plants taller than 120cm, plants in pots larger than 7.5 Litres, root ball, and instant hedging) delivered to destinations in the UK Mainland, are free delivery when the order is over £350, regardless of the number of pallets needed.\n\nScottish Highlands do not have a free delivery option for pallet deliveries.\n\nDo I need to be at home?\n\nAll deliveries will be sent with “no signature required” so you do not need to be at home on the day of delivery. For convenience on pallet deliveries, we will phone or email you on the day we despatch so you can, if you wish, be there (or arrange for someone to be there) to receive the delivery and unpack the plants. If no one is there, the pallet will be left in a safe place (but cannot be moved over gravel or grass).\n\nReturns\n\nWe are rarely asked to accept a return. We can facilitate returns by collecting the parcel/s or palletised plants from you (in their original packaging), but we do not refund the delivery charge or the cost of the carrier collection and redelivery back to us. If you wish to return an order, please contact us and we will explain the process in more detail."
