        "text": "Discussion\n\nRhamnus cathartica was introduced to North America as an ornamental shrub in the middle 1800s and was originally used for hedges, farm shelterbelts, and wildlife habitat; it is an aggressive invader of woods and prairies and is able to completely displace native vegetation. W. H. Brewer collected R. cathartica (UC 18526) in the 1800s from an unknown location in California. No specimens have been collected in the state since that time and it apparently is not naturalized there.\n\nRhamnus cathartica is a primary host for the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, native to eastern Asia. It uses the buckthorn as a winter host and spreads to soybean in the spring. The insect was first discovered in North America in 2000 in Wisconsin and subsequently has spread to at least 20 states in the United States and three provinces in Canada. The orange-colored wood of R. cathartica is sometimes used by woodcarvers."
