        "text": "Common Buckthorn\n\nRhamnus cathartica\n\nBackground\n\nCommon buckthorn (also known as European buckthorn) is a small shrub or tree native to Eurasia. It was introduced to North America in the 1880s as an ornamental shrub and was widely planted for fencerows and windbreaks in agricultural fields. Since then it has spread aggressively throughout southern Ontario and in other provinces. Common buckthorn can thrive in a wide range of soil and light conditions, enabling it to invade a variety of habitats. It is most often found in woodlands and open fields, where it forms dense stands under which few other plants can grow. Buckthorn can spread widely with the help of birds and animals that eat its fruit, carry the seeds long distances and deposit them in their droppings. Stands of buckthorn can invade roadsides, riverbanks, mature forests, farm fields and hydro corridors.\n\nRange\n\nOutside its native range, common buckthorn is found in Canada as far west as Saskatchewan and as far east as Nova Scotia. It also grows throughout the northeastern and north central United States.\n\nImpacts of Common Buckthorn\n\nBuckthorn thrives in a variety of habitats and forms dense thickets that crowd and shade out native plants. It can alter nitrogen levels in the soil, creating better conditions for its own growth and discouraging the growth of native species.\n\nIt produces large numbers of seeds that germinate quickly and prevent the natural growth of native trees and shrubs.\n\nThe shrub can host oat rust, a fungus that causes leaf and crown rust and affects the yield and quality of oats.\n\nThe soybean aphid, an insect that damages soybean crops, can use buckthorn as a host plant to survive the winter. Because it can affect agricultural crops, common buckthorn is listed as a noxious weed under Ontarioâ€™s Weed Control Act.\n\nHow to Identify\n\nBuckthorn is usually the first shrub to leaf out in the spring and the last to drop its leaves late in the fall.\n\nIt often grows 2-3 m (6.6-9.8 ft) tall. Occasionally it reaches 6 m (19.7 ft), with a trunk up to 25 cm (9.8 in) in diameter.\n\nSmooth, dark green leaves are finely toothed, 2.5-6 cm (1-2.4 in) long, and arranged in opposing pairs along the stem.\n\nMost branches older than one year end in a short, sharp thorn.\n\nFlowers have two to six small yellowish-to-green petals.\n\nCommon buckthorn produces clusters of berry-like black fruit in late summer and fall.\n\nCommon buckthorn resembles another invasive species, glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus), and a much smaller native shrub, alder-leafed buckthorn (Rhamnus alnifolia). Check the chart below to identify common buckthorn, glossy buckthorn and alder-leaved buckthorn.\n\nINVASIVE\n\nCommon buckthorn\n\n(Rhamnus cathartica)\n\nDetails\n\nGrows in drier areas\n\nOften two to three metres tall; can reach six metres\n\nTwigs end in sharp thorn\n\nUsually opposite leaves with finely toothed edges\n\nINVASIVE\n\nGlossy buckthorn\n\n(Frangula alnus)\n\nDetails\n\nGrows in wet areas\n\nOften two to three metres tall; can reach six metres\n\nNo sharp thorn on end of twig\n\nAlternate, shiny leaves with smooth, wavy edges\n\nNATIVE\n\nAlder-leaved buckthorn\n\n(Rhamnus alnifolia)\n\nDetails\n\nGrows in very wet areas\n\nUp to one metre tall\n\nNo sharp thorn on end of twig\n\nAlternate, shiny leaves with toothed edges\n\nSmall growths (stipules) at base of leaves\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nLearn how to identify common buckthorn, glossy buckthorn and other invasive plants, and how to effectively manage these species on your property. The guide toBest Management Practices for Invasive Common Buckthorn describes the most effective and environmentally safe control practices for this species.\n\nAvoid using invasive plants in gardens and landscaping.\n\nBuy native or non-invasive plants from reputable garden suppliers. SeeGrow Me Instead: Beautiful Non-Invasive Plants for Your Garden.\n\nDispose of invasive plants in the garbage. Do not put them in the compost or discard them in natural areas. Discarded flowers may produce seeds.\n\nWhen hiking, prevent the spread of invasive plants by staying on trails and keeping pets on a leash.\n\nIf you find Common Buckthorn or other invasive species in the wild, please contact the Invading Species Hotline at 1-800-563-7711, or visit EDDMapS to report a sighting.\n\nResource Files\n\nBuckthorn - Best Management Practices\n\n1 file(s) | 3.03 MB | 2232 download(s)\n\nBuckthorn - Fact Sheet\n\n1 file(s) | 592.33 KB | 2976 download(s)\n\nInvasive Terrestrial Plants - A Quick Reference Guide\n\n1 file(s) | 1.25 MB | 11719 download(s)\n\nOFAH/OMNRF Invading Species Awareness Program.
