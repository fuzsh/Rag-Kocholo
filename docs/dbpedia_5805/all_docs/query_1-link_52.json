        "text": "Michigan has a native Buckthorn, Alder-leaved Buckthorn (Rhamnus alnifolia). It normally grows in fens and is seldom found in dry habitats. It is similar to the invasive Common Buckthorn (R. cathartica) but the two species are easy to tell apart.\n\nAlder-leaved Buckthorn is normally shorter than 1m [3 feet] tall. Its toothed leaves are strictly alternate with 5 to 9 veins per side and are more pointed at the tips than Common Buckthorn. The leaves have stipules at the base of the petioles; however, they are sometimes missing late in the growing season. The flowers lack petals. The petal-like structures are sepals. Sepals are the covering of flower buds; petals are found inside the bud. There are 5 sepals and 5 stamens on each flower. The flowers, and hence the fruits, are in small groups, less than 3 in a cluster.\n\nCommon Buckthorn can reach the size of a small tree. Its toothed leaves can vary from alternate, to sub-opposite, to opposite, on the same branch. Its flowers are 4-parted with both sepals and petals. Flower and fruit clusters are large, seldom as few as 3in a cluster. The branch tips are normally spine tipped and spines can often be found on the along the main trunk.\n\nGlossy Buckthorn (Frangula alnus) is a wetland invasive species but has non-toothed leaves. Its veins are 6 to 9 per side. It has 5 sepals and 5 petals on each flower. The leaf buds are tan pubescent (covered with dense short hairs).\n\nIf you are removing invasive buckthorn you should know this native species. One site in Oakland County was almost destroyed by over-zealous invasive species hunters who did not realize that the invasive Common Buckthorn did not grow into the fen at the bottom of the hill.\n\nCopyright 2016 by Donald Drife\n\nWebpage Michigan Nature Guy\n\nFollow MichiganNatureGuy on Facebook\n\nCommon Buckthorn, also called European Buckthorn, (Rhamnus cathartica) was first collected in Michigan in 1914 but reported by Beal in the 1904 Michigan Flora. Billington in his Shrubs of Michigan, published in 1949, still recommends this species as “an excellent hedge plant;” although, he does admit that the “seeds do germinate easily” and they “create a green carpet under the bushes.” This invasive species should never be planted.\n\nAn aggressive invader of many habitats in Michigan, this shade tolerant shrub is choking out many native species. While distributed throughout the state, it is common only in southern Michigan, but seems to be spreading in northern Michigan.\n\nIt is one of the the first species to leaf out and one of the last to drop its leaves, resulting in a long growing season and giving it an advantage over our native species. The plants are allelopathic, meaning they inhibit the germination of other species. Their fruit is largely responsible for this characteristic so once the species becomes established it aggressively colonizes the habitat. I have seen colonies of Common Buckthorn that have one large “mother-tree” in its center. The seeds are also epigeal, meaning that they germinate on the ground without having to be buried. This allows large numbers of them to germinate.\n\nThe twigs are tipped with a thorn slightly longer than the buds. The buds, and hence the leaves, are sub-opposite but opposite and alternate nodes occur. The nodes shown in the photo are three successive nodes on the same twig. The thorns occur along the branches and are sharp. These distinguish the plant from Wild Black Cherry, and Choke Cherry.\n\nThe bark resembles the bark on a Wild Black Cherry but Buckthorn Bark is often redder. Choke Cherry bark is also similar but the lenticels (the large pores) are more prominent in the cherry. If you have doubts, then peel a little of the bark away from a branch and look for the orange inner bark. Most Common Buckthorns have this bark.\n\nThe leaves are slightly folded, with fine teeth and 3-5 pairs of prominent recessed veins. They are normally a dark green.\n\nThe flowers have four yellow-green petals. Male and female flowers occur on different trees and the female trees outnumber the males. A few male trees in a given population can produce enough pollen to pollinate a large colony. I checked 60 shrubs in one colony looking for male flowers to photograph and could not find any. This same colony heavily fruited that year indicating there was no shortage of pollen.\n\nThe fruit is a three to four seeded drupe that is eaten by birds. A drupe is a fleshy fruit that surrounds a hard pit or pits. Cherries are an example. Most Common Buckthorns fruit heavily, so once a few plants begin to colonize an area it can rapidly take over. The seeds remain in the seed bank for a relatively short period (three to five years). After we cut a large stand in Royal Oak, Michigan, seedlings continued to appear for the next three years.\n\nMichigan Natural Features Inventory has an excellent site on Common Buckthorn.\n\nCopyright 2013 by Donald Drife\n\nWebpage Michigan Nature Guy\n\nFollow MichiganNatureGuy on Facebook"
