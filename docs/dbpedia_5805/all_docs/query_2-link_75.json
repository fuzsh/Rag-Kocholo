        "text": "There is also a native buckthorn (Rhamnus alnifolia), so verify identification prior to removal. The bark is dark gray and the inner bark is orange (easily seen when the tree is cut). Twigs are usually tipped with a sharp spine. Birds and wildlife eat the small purple to black fruits and disperse seeds. Shrub regenerates after burning and cutting and forms dense thickets."
