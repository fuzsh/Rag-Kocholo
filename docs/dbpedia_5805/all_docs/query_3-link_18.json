        "text": "Purging buckthorn is a small tree, often used as a shrub or hedging plant, which is native to England and Wales and much of Europe. It has grey-brown bark and spiny branches, and glossy, dark green, toothed leaves, which turn yellow before falling in autumn. Purging buckthorn is dioceous, meaning its yellow-green, male and female flowers are borne on separate plants. After pollination the female flowers develop into slightly poisonous black berries. Indeed, purging buckthorn is so named due to its traditional use as a laxative, thanks to the purgative effects of eating the berries. It can grow to an eventual height of 10m.\n\nIt's very closely related to alder buckthorn (Frangula alnus), which is thornless.\n\nIn the United States of America, purging buckthorn is highly invasive. However, in Britain, being native, it has no such problems. What's more, purging buckthorn is a fantastic wildlife plant â€“ its leave are used as a caterpillar food plant by the brimstone butterfly, its flowers are visited by pollinators and its berries are eaten by birds. It makes a fantastic addition to a wildlife hedge.\n\nWhere to buy purging buckthorn\n\nThis page contains affiliate links and we may receive a commission for purchases made.
