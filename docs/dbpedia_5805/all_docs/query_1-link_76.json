        "text": "Discussion\n\nRhamnus cathartica was introduced to North America as an ornamental shrub in the middle 1800s and was originally used for hedges, farm shelterbelts, and wildlife habitat; it is an aggressive invader of woods and prairies and is able to completely displace native vegetation. W. H. Brewer collected R. cathartica (UC 18526) in the 1800s from an unknown location in California. No specimens have been collected in the state since that time and it apparently is not naturalized there."
