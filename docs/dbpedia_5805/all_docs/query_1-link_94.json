        "text": "Appearance\n\nCommon buckthorn is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow to 25 feet in height. The bark is dark gray and the inner bark is orange (easily seen when the tree is cut). Twigs are usually tipped with a sharp spine.\n\nFoliage\n\nThe leaf arrangement is usually subopposite, but examples of opposite and/or alternate arrangements are commonly found. Leaves are dark green, oval, 1.5 to 3 inches long, slightly serrate with 3 to 4 pairs of curving veins and a somewhat folded tip.\n\nFlowers\n\nFlowering occurs in the spring, when yellow-green, 4-petaled flowers develop in clusters of 2 to 6 near the base of the petioles. Plants are dioecious (male and female flowers occur on separate plants).\n\nFruits\n\nFruits are small, black berries that are 0.25 inches in diameter.\n\nCheck out the downloadable fact sheet above.\n\nCheck out this video by RiverBankMedia on identifying buckthorn.\n\nEcological Threat\n\nBirds and mammals feed on buckthorn berries during the winter, aiding in the dispersal of seeds. While buckthorn may benefit from this behavior, the feeding animals do not. Buckthorn berries contain emodin, a natural laxative, that prevents mammals from digesting sugars found in the berries.\n\nLike many other invasive trees and shrubs, buckthorn leafs out early and retains its leaves into late fall, giving it a much longer advantageous growing season than native plants.\n\nBuckthorn can increase the amount of nitrogen in the soil, impacting the composition of native species that can grow in the area.\n\nCommon buckthorn invades forests and can form dense thickets crowding out native shrubs and understory plants. Once established, it is difficult to remove.\n\nOrigin\n\nCommon buckthorn is a native of Europe and was introduced into the United States as an ornamental shrub\n\nHabitat\n\nForests, forest edges, meadows, fields, disturbed areas\n\nLife Cycle\n\nBuckthorns reproduce by seed but plants can root sprout or regenerate even after they are cut or burned. Plants mature at 5-6 years old. Seed production is prolific. Common buckthorn fruits ripen from August to September while glossy buckthorn fruits ripen earlierâ€”July to August. Seed germination rates are high and germinate well in the shade. Seeds remain viable for at least 2 years. Plants are usually dioecious; males do not produce fruit. Fruits are eaten by birds, mice, and deer. Seeds viable for 2-6 years."
