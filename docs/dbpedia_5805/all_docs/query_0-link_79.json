        "text": "Management options for buckthorn may include manual, mechanical and chemical removal. Seedlings and smaller shrubs may be hand-pulled or dug out. Large infestation can be mowed using a forestry mower, in preparation for foliar chemical treatments. Effective herbicide treatments include foliar, basal bark, and cut-stump. Follow-up treatment will likely be required. Common buckthorn are prolific seed producers and tend to re-establish via the seed bank, as well as re-sprout, after herbicide treatment. Different herbicides can be more or less effective, depending on timing of application.\n\nCommon buckthorn was introduced as an ornamental plant and was widely planted across the landscape. Common buckthorn spreads primarily by seed that is transported by birds and humans."
