In small doses, and for short periods, these can be safe and effective, but used over long periods they can weaken the body's natural ability to defecate and can have a range of long-lasting negative effects upon the body, including anaemia, malabsorption, haematuria and weight loss. Large single doses can cause severe purging.\n\nBotanical References\n\n11\n\nTitle\n\nTrees and Shrubs Hardy in Great Britain. Vol 1 - 4 and Supplement.\n\nPublication\n\nAuthor\n\nBean.
