It is the food-plant of the Brimstone butterfly.\n\nSee Woodland Trust\n\nIf it is isolated from others perhaps it is rarely pollinated and never produces berries.\n\nFrom http://www.sussex-butterflies.org.uk/conservation/allotments/\n\nIt is unusual to see such a large specimen but here is a photo taken in Oct 2016 at Kingley Vale National Nature Reserve in West Sussex, UK. The vale has many Purging Buckthorn of a mature age and size as shown in middle of the photo with people to give some scale. Well worth a visit if you ever get a chance, it is one of Europe's most impressive yew forests.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingley_Vale_National_Nature_Reserve"
