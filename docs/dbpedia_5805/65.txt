Description

Common Buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) is a small tree or large shrub that has become a major invasive plant, almost to the point of becoming out of control. It forms monocultures, suppressing all native plant species by leafing out early and holding leaves late into the fall.

Native SiteNative to Eurasia it was introduced into the United States in the early 1880's. It was used for hedge rows and ornamental plantings Author's NotesAs an adviser for "Students To Save The Earth", one of our major service projects was to go to different parks, Nature Conservancy's and cut down this plant. I don't know how many thousands if not 10's of thousands we eliminated over the years.
