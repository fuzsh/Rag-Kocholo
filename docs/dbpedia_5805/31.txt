Rhamnus cathartica has been cultivated in the past for ornament, shelter and as a hedge. It has a wide habitat tolerance as it can tolerate extremes in soil moisture, herbivory, pathogens and shade. It also exhibits high fecundity, rapid growth rates, and low mortality. Reproduction can occur after 9 - 11 years after which fruit production is generally very high. The species has often escaped from cultivation and has become naturalised and invasive within northern USA and Canada. It has been declared a noxious weed in several N. American states[

Species in this genus contain hydroxyanthracene derivatives which have a stimulant laxative effect upon the body, and many species are used traditionally as laxatives. In small doses, and for short periods, these can be safe and effective, but used over long periods they can weaken the body's natural ability to defecate and can have a range of long-lasting negative effects upon the body, including anaemia, malabsorption, haematuria and weight loss. Large single doses can cause severe purging.
