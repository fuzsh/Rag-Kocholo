These churches are the hallmarks of Pampanga's long and rich history, with most of these structures dating back to the Spanish era.

It was rebuilt by Father Antonio Redondo between the years 1876-1880. Its towers were finished in 1896 by the Rev. Toribio Fanjul, who purposely made them low to minimize the effects of earthquakes.\n\nApu Chapel – Bgry. Lourdes Sur, Angeles City, Pampanga\n\nThis is the shrine of the replica of Our Lord of the Holy Sepulchre or Santo Entierro (Apung Mamacalulu).

It is also every Friday when people buy household items, clothing including audio-video equipment in a makeshift market called \"tiangge\" at bargain prices. It was in 2012 when the chapel was decreed by Archbishop Paciano Aniceto, at the recommendation of Auxiliary Bishop Pablo Virgilio David, as an archdiocesian shrine during the canonical rites. Aniceto also established the chapel as a \"center of mercy.\" The original image, a gift by Fr. Macario Paras to the Holy Rosary Parish in Brgy. Sto. Rosario in 1872, is enshrined in the same parish. Aniceto also assigned Fr. Enrique Luzung as the shrine rector.
