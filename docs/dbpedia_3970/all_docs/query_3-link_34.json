        "text": "Reviewed By Ntrekker - Metuchen, United States\n\nA beautiful Baroque Style Church built in 1660 hosts a beautiful ceiling and altar piece put together by the skilled wood carvers and artisans of the town of Betis now part of Guagua Pampanga. Helpful descriptions at the church entry give the history of the town and the church. At the time of our visit as part of the town fiesta celebration a competition of wood carving with participants from around the country was in full swing and we watched in awe as they carved wood into beautiful pieces.\n\nReviewed By King_Elmer26\n\nOne of the oldest churches in Angeles City. Since my High School Days I've been visiting this miraculous image of Apung Mamacalulu. Some may not believe but i usually visit the shrine and asked blessings before i take exams. Before it was only considered as a chapel called \"visitas\" by the local. Now it is already a parish and it has improved a lot. Every Friday is the regular visit for Apung Mamacalulu. Its Feast is every last Friday of October. Aside from visiting the miraculous Shrine, you may enjoy buying various items around the vicity at a very low price."
