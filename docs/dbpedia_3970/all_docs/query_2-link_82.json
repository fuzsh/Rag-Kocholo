        "text": "A devastating earthquake struck Bohol, Philip- pines, on 15 October 2013. The earthquake originated at 12 km depth from an unmapped reverse fault, which mani- fested on the surface for several kilometers and with maxi- mum vertical displacement of 3 m. The earthquake resulted in 222 fatalities with damage to infrastructure estimated at USD 52.06 million. Widespread landslides and sinkholes formed in the predominantly limestone region during the earthquake. These remain a significant threat to communi- ties as destabilized hillside slopes, landslide-dammed rivers and incipient sinkholes are still vulnerable to collapse, trig- gered possibly by aftershocks and heavy rains in the upcom- ing months of November and December. The most recent fatal temblor originated from a previously unmapped fault, herein referred to as the Inabanga Fault. Like the hidden or previously unmapped faults responsible for the 2012 Negros and 2013 Bohol earthquakes, there may be more unidentified faults that need to be mapped through field and geophysical methods. This is necessary to mitigate the possible damaging effects of future earthquakes in the Philippines.\n\nAt 00:43 UTC on 27 July 2022, a 15-km deep major earthquake with magnitude (Mw) 7.0 struck Northwestern Luzon, Philippines. The strongest ground shaking felt was at PHIVOLCS Earthquake Intensity Scale (PEIS) VII (destructive), equivalent to Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) VII, in Abra and along the coastal areas of Ilocos Sur. More than a thousand landslides, rockfalls and tension cracks were mapped, near the epicentral region, in the northwestern part of the Central Cordillera. Most of the landslides were shallow-seated, many of which were situated along road cuts. Liquefaction manifested as lateral spreads, sand boils, fissures, ground subsidence, and localized swelling was documented along the coastal areas of Ilocos Sur and river channels in Abra and Ilocos Sur. Sea level disturbance was also observed in some coastal areas of Ilocos Sur and La Union. Damages to buildings and infrastructures were documented in areas that experienced PEIS VI (very strong), equivalent to MMI VI a...\n\nSince 12-2004 till 4-2015 there has been 5 earthquake events in Asia having an Richter of above 8 in magnitude. These are also ’severe natural disasters’ for they have been associated with massive losses of human lives and livelihood assets. In this brief communication the author revisit the related domains and makes a atypical discussions based on observations. It is hoped that such method and model may eventually be of (some) help to the indulgent administrations and also to the interested scholars.\n\nA devastating earthquake struck Bohol, Philippines on 15 October 2013.
