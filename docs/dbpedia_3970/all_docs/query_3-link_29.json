        "text": "75 towns in 1885. The Index Guide for Travelers in the Philippine Islands lists a total of 75 towns in the provinces of Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, and Pampanga. It listed 26 towns in Bulacan, which includes Barasoain and Santa Isabel, which are now part of Malolos City (18) and existent only as part of Catholic parishes and not as administrative barangays. It also lists Polo, which became part of Metro Manila under Valenzuela City (24) in the 1970s. In Pampanga, the Index Guide lists a total of 24 towns, including Betis, which is now part of Guagua (12) and San Miguel, which is now Masantol (10). The number of Nueva Ecija towns meanwhile is 25, including Valle, which is now just one of the barangays of Talavera (264), and Puncan, now part of Carranglan (570). The Index Guide lists as part of Nueva Ecija the towns of Rosales (387), San Quintin (460), and Umingan (447), which were annexed to Pangasinan in 1901. Out of the 75 towns listed for Bulacan, Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija in 1885, 61 continue to exist as municipalities and cities within the current borders of these three provinces.\n\nWhy these three? I had been asked why I chose Bulacan, Pampanga and Nueva Ecija as the first provinces in my Restart. My only idea was to see more of these provinces which I often bypassed. I knew I was far from Manila whenever I saw the bluish-green tops of Mt. Arayat from the North Diversion Road, as what the North Luzon Expressway was called then, or from the Central Luzon segment of the Maharlika Highway, renamed the Pan-Philippine Highway and designated internationally as AH-26. My earliest memories of these three provinces are views of endless rice fields that changed color with the passing seasons, that received the love of farmers for the earth with their gentle beasts of burden. Fertile lands decorated with curious-looking stacks of dayami or hay beside small makeshift huts to protect them from the sun. The smell of burning dayami that mixed with the wind from the open window, and the silhouettes of farmers, their small tractors and reliable carabaos coming from the haze of the morning.\n\nWhenever I see Mount Arayat, I always recall one of the legends about Maria Sinukuan, the mountain goddess to which the 1,026-meter extinct stratovolcano is associated. The greed of humans and their abuse of her generosity to allow them to partake of the fruits and game from the bountiful forests of Mount Arayat brought the goddess to decide to never to be seen by the villagers again. She withdrew too, the bounty under her green dominion. I could not help but think of the insidious greed by the Spanish colonizers that spanned centuries, and of the alleged misuse of more than USD 8 million in state lottery funds by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in October 2012. In the Maria Sinukuan legend, the abusive humans who stole from her turned into wild boar— a divine punishment for avarice.\n\nOf centers of devotion and fruits of hardships\n\nIn the 1590s, by the time the river town of Sasmuan (14) in Pampanga was founded, the province faced famine after food production had fallen because of the conscription of its men to fight the Spanish expansion campaigns in the Visayas and Mindanao. The religious and civil jurisdiction of Sasmuan ping-ponged between the towns of Guagua and Lubao. Although founded as a visita of Guagua in 1590, it became a part of Lubao in 1611, but Sasmuan became an independent parish four years later. Several years before the establishment of Sasmuan’s Santa Lucia Parish, Don Juan de Manila and Don Nicolas Mananguete unsuccessfully staged a revolt farther up the Pampanga River in Candaba (7) after their petitions against the abuses of authorities were ignored. With his followers, Don Nicolas surrendered on condition of being granted pardon, while Don Juan and his group were defeated and shot by native operatives who disguised themselves as travelers. Often with no exception, those who fought the Spanish were brutally executed. This knowledge gave me a greater appreciation for the faith and hardships that countless, often unnamed people endured during the Spanish regime. This same appreciation applies when I see the parish churches of old and learn of their histories.\n\nI imagine the extreme difficulty of the residents of San Fernando and Santa Ana in the first 20 years since their founding. From 1755 to 1756, a smallpox epidemic hit San Fernando and other towns in Pampanga resulting in hundreds of deaths. Six years later, as the area of operations of Oidor and acting Governor General Simon de Anda, the theater of war during the British occupation of Manila in 1762 extended to the province. Natural disasters in the 1770s resulted in poor harvests in many areas in the province, including San Fernando and Santa Ana, which are part of Pampanga’s rich rice belt. The faithful I have seen in the churches of San Fernando and the farmers, fishermen and rice and fish traders in Santa Ana are part of the continuing narratives of the struggling to cope with man-made and natural disasters. Like many of those living in the Pampanga River Basin, they are a people that remain steadfast in the face of challenges such as climate change and the effects of phenomena like El Niño and La Niña in their sources of livelihood.\n\nOf colonial plunder\n\nHistory lessons never emphasized the long-term and irreparable ill-effects of the mercantilist system and other policies that the Spanish authorities used to sustain their control and plunder of the archipelago. In school, I learned about the tributo or tribute collection and the polo y servicio or forced labor, but only a month ago, I found myself eaten up by a chapter in a scholarly book by Luis Camara Dery on how pestilence, smallpox, and two other policies— the Real Compra de Bandala and repartimientos- — impoverished rich agricultural lands like Pampanga just within the first three decades of its conquest in 1572. The former required people to sell to the government — at an annually assigned time — commodities such as rice and chickens at lower prices. The latter meant working for almost no wages in the ship- or lumberyards to support the building of galleons or fighting the enemies of Spain. In the 1580s, famine hit Pampanga after rice production decreased as a result of the conscription of Kapampangan men to work in the mines in the Ilocos. In the 1600s, another generation was sent to work as sailors and carpenters in what is now the Cavite Naval Yard in Cavite City (362).\n\nI could just simply conclude that the Spanish colonial experience is like a coin: on one side is the faith narrative and the other are the imposed hardships. I could also easily conclude that both are part of a necessary chapter in our journey as a country to be saved— as the Spanish viewed it — from pagan demons and Mahomet. After all, I have grown up taking pride in living in a country whose another moniker is being the only Christian nation in Asia — but this something that has become rather inaccurate. I grew up bombarded with the idea that had it not for the Spanish, we never would have been a Christian nation, or predominantly Roman Catholic, that is. But truth be told and boldly: conversion came through legendary piety and the exertion of brutal force. Alongside it came plunder, but the Spanish rule was met with resistance and revolts.\n\nEncapsulating more than 400 years of the history of the province in less than 10 sentences, the NHI marker at the Provincial Capitol in San Fernando City (15) testifies to the wealth of a pre-colonial era Pampanga, described as being the most developed, most beautiful, and most prosperous. Pampanga supplied rice throughout the Spanish regime. But the marker also honors the four times it rose in arms against the excesses of Spanish rule: once in the 16th century and thrice in the 17th century. It mentions Francisco Maniago of Mexico (117) who raised a rebellion against forced labor and the excessive imposition of taxes.\n\nThe NHI marker does not mention that the Spanish defeated Maniago in 1660 with the help of another Kampampagan leader, Juan Macapagal of Arayat (6), who turned his coat after being promised great wealth by Governor Manrique de Lara if he supported the Spanish. And this he did. Juan, the grandson of Manila’s last ruler Lacandula was given the the title of Maestro de Campo after suppressing a couple more attempts in rebellion in other areas. An ancestor of 9th PH President Diosado Macapagal, and his daughter Gloria, 14th PH President, Don Juan Macapagal became an encomiendero.\n\nPampanga suffered under the Real Compa de Bandala, which was abolished in the province in 1792, but the equally oppressive tobacco monopoly was implemented in the province from the 1780s until its abolition in 1882. It is in this socio-economic context that the town of Masantol (10) was formed out from Macabebe in 1878, under newly appointed Governor General Domingo Moriones y Murillo. Some 15 years later, the San Miguel Archangel Parish was formed. It is the last of the 23 parishes founded by the Spanish that still remain within Pampanga province. Within a year after the founding of Masantol, Andres Bonifacio founded the Katipunan and led the struggle against Spain; two years later, the Philippine Revolutionary War against Spain begins. Although born in Manila, recent historical research suggests that the Katipunan Supremo traces his roots to Maticling, Brgy. Sta. Cruz in Masantol, where a statue was built at the town center in November 2013 to honor the hero’s 150th birth anniversary.\n\nOf generals and heroes, revolutions and renovations\n\nIn the 21 towns and two cities in Bulacan, Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija that I had visited for the Restart, most of the monuments I have seen are dedicated to national heroes like Rizal and Bonifacio and to valorous veterans of World War II. What I also saw are other valiant heroes of the Philippine Revolution against Spain and the succeeding Philippine-American War. Gallant equestrians are the depictions of Gen. Gregorio del Pilar at his monument in Bulakan (23) and his final resting place in front of the Bulacan Provincial Capitol in Malolos City (18), of Gen. Maximo Hizon in front of the Pampanga Provincial Capitol in San Fernando City (15), and of Aguinaldo’s War Secretary Jose Alejandrino in front of the Municipal Hall in Arayat (6).\n\nMeanwhile, Gen. Maximo Hizon, Jose Alejandrino, and Aurelio Tolentino are among the Kapampangans that contributed to the revolution against Spain and to the succeeding struggle after the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1898 which ceded the Philippines to American rule. I was only familiar with the name of Aurelio Tolentino, after whom the Little Theater of the Cultural Center of the Philippines in Manila (28) was named. When the treaty was signed, Maximo and Jose were in their late 20s, while Aurelo was already 31 years old. Already a member of the Katipunan, Maximo exiles to Jolo in 1896. He returned two years later to become one of the independence movement’s most capable generals, rising to the rank of brigadier, but he was injured near Porac (214) and captured in Mexico (117). The Americans afterwards had him exiled to Guam where he died at the age of 31. Meanwhile, Jose, a contemporary of Rizal and Apolinario Mabini, studied in Europe, and even helped edit and distribute the former’s Noli me Tangere. At almost 30 years old, he helped draft the Malolos Constitution, becoming a senator in the 1920s and a delegate to the 1934 Constitutional Convention. He died at the age of 80 in 1951. Aurelio, a signatory to the Declaration of Independence in Kawit (371) in 1898, was sent to jail for his anti-US literature but was pardoned in 1912. The militant and nationalistic playwright that he was, he produced more than 60 Tagalog and Kapampangan literary works until his death in his late 40s in Manila in 1915.\n\nAt age 41, Mariano Llanera led 700 men to become part of the forces that attacked San Isidro in 1896. A year later, Aguinaldo designated him Lieutenant General, and he continued to fight on until the signing of the Pact of Biak na Bato after which he left for exile in Hong Kong. He resumed his military career during the Philippine-American War until his capture at age 46 — my age at the time of writing this article. With other Filipino military leaders, he lived in exile for the second time to Guam, where he stayed for a year. He died in at age of 87 in 1942 in Cabiao. Meanwhile, Mamerto Natividad Jr. who was 16 years younger than Llanera, joined the Katipunan at the age of 25, became a general after a series of successful battles he fought alongside 18-year old Manuel Tinio against the Spanish. Both men saw action in Cabiao, where Mamerto was killed by Spanish sniper fire in 1897 at the age of 26. Gen. Manuel Tinio, who survived and brought home Mamerto’s remains to his family, became a general at 22, making him the youngest general in the revolutionary army. Heading the so-called Tinio Brigade, he put up a fierce fight in the Ilocos and the Cordilleras with the Americans, evading capture. But he surrendered to them in 1901, soon after Aguinaldo’s capture and surrender to US authorities. Two years later, the Americans appointed him to become the Governor of Nueva Ecija. Backed by his businesses and landholdings, Gen. Tinio became one of the most powerful politicos in the province during his time. He however died at age 46 of cirrhosis in Manila. The narratives of Aurelio Tolentino and Manuel Tinio hit me in particular-— they died at my age.\n\nAll these three men, who at some point fought the Spanish alongside one another, were all signatories to the Biak na Bato Constitution. Some 10 years after the granting of Philippine Independence in 1946, all three generals had towns in Nueva Ecija named after them. The municipality of Llanera (263) was created in 1954, followed by Gen. Mamerto Natividad (261) three years later, 60 years after the death of the young general. In the same year, the town of Papaya was renamed Gen. Tinio (3), although residents and drivers still refer to its old name which is the Filipino for the tropical fruit Carica papaya.\n\nBut the narratives of the Philippine Revolution against Spain continue to live on, and not without controversy nor contradiction. For example, in his blog, a descendant of Pantaleon Valmonte offered a totally different account of the Cry of Nueva Ecija. Pantaleon and Mariano with their respective delegations planned to serenade the Captain Machorro and plead for the release of local Katipunan members. However, the son of one of the arrested members assassinated Machorro, and this resulted in chaos. In retaliation, the Spanish authorities ordered the immediate arrest of Pantaleon and other officials who were executed. This very different account of events in the erstwhile Novo Ecijano capital of San Isidro brought me to think of how historical events can have three versions: the official as stated in books and NHI markers, the contradicting as sometimes offered by descendants, and the unknown.\n\nThe mental image I had of the Macabebe Scouts were long-haired and I had to reconcile this when I first saw the memorial built for them in front of the municipio in Macabebe, which depicted them as short haired men in period combat gear. Their predecessors, the Voluntarios de Macabebes, have been serving the Spanish authorities for centuries, joining them in their campaigns, quelling homegrown and far-off rebellions. There were also unfounded stories that the Macabebes descended from the Aztecs or the Yaqui tribe in Mexico. Nonetheless, Macabebe warriors have been labelled as untrustworthy mercenaries and traitors, perhaps having been very instrumental in the American’s capture of President Aguinaldo in 1901. These labels I held until I read the marker at the scouts’ memorial. While their organization is attributed to an American, Maj. Matthew Batson, part of the formation of the Macabebe Scouts came from the the desire of residents to settle the score with the revolutionary forces under Aguinaldo for destroying the town. I recalled the story of burning of the San Nicolas de Tolentino Church along with 300 people by Col. Agapito Bonzon. This must have been the reason why some of the old decorations on the walls of the church looked like funeral wreaths.\n\nAlthough there are no evidences to this, there is even talk that their role in Aguinaldo’s capture was also to even the score for the execution of Supremo Andres Bonifacio whose mother hails from nearby Masantol. My appreciation of the Macabebe Scouts and even the 1896 Cry of Nueva Ecija requires having an open mind. Local histories and accounts of events handed down to direct descendants continue to swim in the fringes of mainstream historical events that are often supported by official historical markers, issued either by the NHI, local governments, or civic institutions. Hopefully these markers would not to be altered, removed or destroyed during the renovation of public structures and spaces.\n\nOf rice, rivers, rails and roads\n\nIf there is another equation to put together the provinces of Bulacan, Pampanga and Nueva Ecija, it would have to be the lucrative rice trade and how this precious staple was and is being transported to Manila. A book by Daniel Doeppers described how rice and other foodstuff were transported to the capital from the 1850s to 1945. His work helped me further appreciate the developments in infrastructure such as the construction of the rail and road networks. For centuries, the Rio Grande de Pampanga, its tributaries and the other rivers that emptied into the Manila Bay served as the lifeblood of trade between the kingdoms that would later become Intramuros and the Provinces of Pampanga and Bulacan. For example, the towns of Guagua and the former provincial capital Bulakan (23) profited from the trade with Manila. A marker at the municipal hall in Bulakan testified in Filipino that the town served as the conduit for trade because it provided the quickest access to and from Manila using the watercraft called parao. The rice trade soon expanded beyond Pampanga and Bulacan to include other rice-producing areas in the Visayas, Bicol and Ilocos through the construction ports and use of steamships, but flat bottomed boats continued to travel down river to Manila Bay to bring rice into the traders’ warehouses in Malabon (26), now a city more famous for its fish market."
