Also, La Pampanga served as the archipelagoâs capital from 1762 to 1754 during the British invasion of Manila.\n\nThe province of Nueva Ecija borders the northern part while Bataan and Zambales on the southwestern and western regions, respectively, and Bulacan on the eastern and southeastern parts.

Clark International Airport is the 2nd international airport in Luzon.\n\nORIGIN OF PAMPANGA\n\nLocated in Central Luzon, it was the Spaniards who gave Pampanga its name La Pampanga upon discovering natives living near the riverbanks of the largest river during that time, Indung Kapampangan River.
