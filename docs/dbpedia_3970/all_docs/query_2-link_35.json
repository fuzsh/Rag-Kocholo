        "text": "Who would’ve though that this would happen in our lifetime.\n\nAfter almost eighty years since the Second World War, the original image of Nuestra Señora del Santisimo Rosario – La Naval de Manila comes home to Intramuros, Manila for a special occasion – the Quadricentennial Celebrations (400th founding anniversary) of Colegio de San Juan de Letran. This visit is one of a kind because it is one of the rare instances that the Santo Rosario (as she was originally called) goes outside of her shrine in Santo Domingo Church in Quezon City apart from her annual fiesta procession. The last time that the Virgin went outside of her shrine and jurisdiction took place in 2011 at the University of Santo Tomas in España Boulevard, Sampaloc, Manila for its Quadricentennial celebrations.\n\nI originally intended to present a factual timeline that leads to this once in a lifetime event of our modern generation, in the tradition of this blog. But after witnessing the event myself, (Of course I wouldn’t miss it in the world) relishing and pondering each moment in my memory, I will instead share this in a very personal manner which I’ve never done before because of an impulse of inspiration. When I was conceptualizing the content in my head while traveling to Malolos, Bulacan to attend the 2 day conclusion of the Santo Niño de Malolos festivies, I realized that a personal eyewitness account will work on this blogpost because it is a perfect way to record the events in detail that took place on that fateful day of January 24, 2020 – a day every Letranite, history buffs, and La Naval devotees waited for decades.\n\nLa Gran Señora de Filipinas and Intramuros\n\nI wouldn’t dwell much on the origins and miracles of the Santo Rosario because I’ve already written a blogpost about its rich history that dictated the course of our country’s history and how her historic festivities and Grand Procession in Intramuros became part of our history and culture that was later immortalized in literature and film. Since the carving of the image in 1593, the Santo Rosario and Intramuros became inseparable. The Santo Rosario became a silent witness to the glorious and tragic history our nation and the flourishing of the Catholic faith in the islands.\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out in 1941, everything went to a screeching halt. The Japanese forces invaded the country and both Japanese and American forces are bombing the country – unfortunately, Intramuros was one of the casualties. Fortunately, when the news of the War broke out, the image of Our Lady of the Rosary was kept in an underground vault for safekeeping and on December 30, 1941, the image was recovered successfully and it was later kept at the University of Santo Tomas for safekeeping until the image was enthroned in her permanent shrine in the New Santo Domingo Church in Quezon City.\n\nLa Naval and Letran\n\nThe main purpose of the La Gran Señora’s visit to the Walled City is for the 400th founding anniversary of Colegio de San Juan de Letran. Why Letran one may ask, let us look at the historic link between Colegio de San Juan de Letran and the miraculous image of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary – La Naval de Manila.\n\nThe college was founded by Don Juan Geromino Guerrero in 1620, a retired Spanish officer in Intramuros as “Colegio de Niños Huerfanos de San Juan de Letran” in honor of San Juan Bautista. The school was founded to give shelter, educate and mold orphans to be good Christian citizens. The Colegio gained approval in 1623 and was placed under the Royal Patronage of the King of Spain.\n\nAround the month of May in 1632, Fray Diego de Santa Maria, O.P. arrived at the Sto. Domingo convent from Spain. He was officially assigned to this same convent on April 23, 1633. He later founded the “Colegio de Huerfanos de San Pedro y San Pablo” and the orphans under this Colegio was residing at the Convento of the Dominicans. As Don Guerrero grew old, the two schools were fused together, and in 1706, the Provincial Chapter of the Dominicans in the Philippines decided to adopt officially the name Colegio de San Juan de Letran in memory of its first founder, Don Juan Alonso Geronimo Guerrero.\n\nSince then, the students and faculty of Colegio de San Juan de Letran had this close ties and special devotion to the Virgin and they always accompany her on the Virgin’s fiesta procession held every October. During the First Plenary Council of the Philippines in 1953, the image of Nuestra Señora del Santisimo Rosario – La Naval de Manila returned to Intramuros, twelve years since the Second World War to oversee the council held at San Agustin Church. On January 24, 1953, as part of the closing of the Plenary Council and a brief public veneration at San Agustin Church, the image made a short visit to Colegio de San Juan de Letran for the veneration of the Letranite community. The short visit edified the Letranites for it was seen as a reunion of their Mother and her “huerfanos”.\n\nGaining momentum\n\nOver the next decades, many are hoping the Virgin of La Naval de Manila will return to Intramuros, at least for a short while (perhaps out of nostalgia). Since the 1980’s up to the early 2000’s, the vicaria of the Virgin of La Naval would participate the annual Grand Marian Procession held every First Sunday of December in Intramuros which gives the attendees a glimpse of the old La Naval procession back in the day.\n\nIn 2017, with the release of the modern adaptation of Nick Joaquin’s stage play “Ang Larawan” (Originally known as “Portrait of an Artist”) which it highlights the last La Naval procession in 1941, hopes and imaginations of the Virgin’s return increased due to the film’s cult following.\n\nThat same period, Colegio de San Juan de Letran was then preparing to celebrate its 400th founding anniversary. Many are wondering if the original and canonically crowned image of Our Lady will visit Letran in Intramuros just like what happened at the University of Santo Tomas in 2011 during its own Quadricentennial festivities that year. (The blogger himself was a student of UST when the Virign visited the campus and stayed at the Santisimo Rosario Parish overnight).\n\nBy the end of 2019, the news finally came that the Virgin of La Naval will return to Intramuros for the opening of the Quadricentennial celebrations of Colegio de San Juan de Letran on January 24 – 25, 2020 – exactly 67 years since the Virgin’s last visit to Intramuros and Letran. The announcement was first published in the 2019 La Naval de Manila fiesta souvenir program then months later, it was announced thru Letran’s social media platforms by December of 2019. The announcement electrified La Naval devotees and history lovers for the hopes of many will finally come true to see the Santo Rosario back to her home in Intramuros. Preparations for a once in a lifetime event was important and by the detail from the vestment that the Virgin will use for the event, logistics, traffic, security, preparations at the Manila Cathedral and Colegio de San Juan de Letran, the key venues of the visit are closely monitored to ensure that the everything is in place for her historic visit.\n\nA special entourage of the Santo Rosario\n\nFor this occasion, the Virgin will have a special entourage of saints that will accompany her in her Grand Procession in Intramuros. The line up of the saints were quite different from the current set up of the modern La Naval de Manila festivities (27 saints).The Intrmuros homecoming line up consits of the following in chronological order of appearance: El Glorioso San Jose, San Juan Baustisa (The titular Patron of Colegio de San Juan de Letran), San Pedro and San Pablo (The original titular patrons of Letran), Sto. Domingo de Guzman, Sto. Tomas de Aquino, Sta. Catalina de Sena, San Martin de Porres (Reportedly bilocated in Intramuros, particularly in Letran), San Vicente Liem de la Paz, San Vicente de Sto Domingo, Sto. Domingo Tuoc and Beato Jose Maria de Manila.\n\nFor the line up, the images of San Jose, Sto. Domingo, Sto. Tomas de Aquino and Sta. Catalina de Sena came from Sto. Domingo Church that are currently used for the modern La Naval Processions (The Pre-War image of Sta. Catalina is currently venerated in the chapel of Siena College in Quezon City). The image of San Juan Bautista came from Nazaren School in Quiapo, Manila while those of San Pedro and San Pablo came from Sta. Maria, Bulacan that were used for Holy Week processions in the said town. The images that were kept in Letran were that of San Martin de Porres and San Vicente Liem de la Paz. Three new processional images were commissioned for this special occasion, namely San Vicente de Sto Domingo, Sto. Domingo Tuoc and Beato Jose Maria de Manila. The three new saints in this line up are known as Letranite saints because these saints, which includes St. Vicente Liem de la Paz, were foremost alumni of Colegio de San Juan de Letran in Intramuros who died as martyrs during the Christian persecution in Vietnam and the Spanish Civil War respectively.\n\nIt is imperative for this blog to introduce the two saints that were seen in the homecoming of the Santo Rosario in Intramuros. I’ve already written a biographical sketch to Blessed Jose Maria de Manila in this blog so I will only introduce two Letranite saints who belonged to the Dominican Order and died as Martyrs of the Vietnamese Christian persecution.\n\nSt. Vicente Yen de Santo Domingo\n\nSan Vicente de Santo Domingo was born in Tra-lu in the province of Nam-dinh in 1764. He was trained under the supervision of Bishop Ignatius Delgado, who ordained him a priest at the age of 40. He was appointed to the care of souls. His Calvary began right away. He was secretly denounced to the Mandarins, taken prisoner and made to carry a heavy cangue [yoke]. He spent a month in this condition until he was rescued by friends and set sailed to the Philippines.\n\nVincente studied at Colegio de San Juan de Letran and asked to be admitted to the Dominican Order. Vicente received the habit on July 22, 1807. His purity and considerate treatment of others was such that he won everyone’s respect. He later returned to Vietnam and was once again imprisoned on June 8, 1838; on the 11th, the Mandarins came together to judge him to be beheaded. The venerable priest of 74 years of age walked calmly and with joy to his execution on June 30, 1838. He was beheaded for being a priest of the Religion and for teaching it to the people.\n\nSto. Domingo Tuoc\n\nSto. Domingo Tuoc was born around 1775 in Trung Lao, province of Nam Dinh. He later set sailed to the Philippines and studied at Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He entered the Dominican Order in 1811, and was ordained a priest shortly after. He went back to his home country to minister his flock. A witness in the process of beatification (Dominic Doai) said that the saint was hidden in his house for two months, that he spent long hours at night in prayer, and that in the early morning he celebrated Mass every day.\n\nOnce he was hiding in a house, some local soldiers came to look for priests, and he hid, but seeing that the people in the house were in danger, he went out and let himself be seen: “I am the priest.” But as they were local soldiers, without any Mandarin or other great authority, the local people attacked them in large numbers with sticks and other tools pretending to help the priest escape. One of the soldiers put an end to the brawl, and struck the saint in the head, so that he fell bathed in blood, while the soldiers fled.\n\nHe did not die immediately, but a few hours later, praising and blessing God for allowing him to die for the faith he had professed and uttered the Holy Name of Jesus before he breathed his last. The Christians around him collected everything that touched the saint, including the earth bathed in his blood, considering it a sacred relic.\n\nThe Return of the Queen\n\nThe long wait was over, the day finally came, exactly 67 years since the First Plenary Council of the Philippines was held in the Walled City. On that fateful day of January 24, 2020, Intramuros was filled with much excitement and a Marian air was all over that the faithful, the La Naval devotees from different parts of the country, history lovers, the students and faculty of Letran, UST and other neighboring schools are eager to witness a very historic comeback of the La Gran Señora de Filipinas to her first home.\n\nThe Virgin arrived in the earlier than what was scheduled at around 1:30 pm and as the Patroness of the Philippine Navy, she was was welcomed with water salute (The Virgin was covered with a custom made jacket) before making her way to the Cathedral. The shouts of “iViva Virgen de La Naval!” from the crowd can be heard all over Plaza Roma as they welcome the Queen to the Capital and the “Vivas” became louder as she enters the Cathedral. This was the first time that the venerable image of Our Lady of the Rosary – La Naval de Manila entered the Manila Cathedral since the Spanish regime.\n\nInterestingly, the Santo Rosario and the Niño Jesus entered the aisle wearing the medals of the Colegio and without their crowns, which is reminiscent of her Canonical Coronation procession in 1907 at Plaza Magallanes in Intramuros and a century later in 2007 on the event’s centenary in her present shrine as she is about to receive her Canonical Crown donated by the Filipino nation to its Great Protectress. As the Virgin was enthroned at the Cathedral, the Holy Rosary, done in the Dominican Format, was prayed while waiting for the Mass that was set at 3:00 pm. The faithful inside and outside the Cathedral was in a prayerful mood as the faithful prayed the rosary and sang its Inter-Mystery hymns of the La Naval de Manila tradition.\n\nAfter praying the rosary, the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass started presided by His Eminence Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle, the outgoing Archbishop of Manila, together with the priests of the Archdiocese of Manila and the Dominican Order headed by Rev. Fr. Clarence Marquez, OP, President of Colegio de San Juan de Letran. Before the Mass, the re-enactment of the Canonical Coronation took place to the surprise of many and once again, the shouts of “iViva Cristo Rey!” and “iViva Virgen de La Naval!” once again were heard inside and outside of the Cathedral as homage to the Queen of the Islands. Cardinal Tagle gave a reflective homily on imitation of Mary’s virtues and how we should pray like her which help us ponder with one’s prayer life and how this should lead to action. Before the Mass was ended, the popular Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Dumagoso lead Solemn Act of Consecration to Our Lady of the Rosary – La Naval de Manila, again following a tradition where a government official, a popular personality, or a representative from different sectors would lead this solemn act to consecrate the Philippines to its powerful Queen and Protectress. After the Mass a brief veneration of the image took place for those who haven’t seen the Santo Rosario up close and personal while her carroza triunfal is being prepared for the solemn procession – a first after 79 years since the Second World War.\n\nThe Much awaited historic Procession\n\nAfter the Carozza Triunfal of the Santo Rosario was set, the Virgin later emerged beautifully from the portals of the Cathderal, greeting the crowd at Plaza Roma. A few minutes later, a dance was offered to the Virgin by the students of the Colegio.\n\nOnce the dance concluded, the much awaited Procession followed, flanked by her special entourage of saints, the priests and friars, the students, devotees, and members of different groups, religious and Civic, as the procession winds its way to the old cobbled streets of Intramuros. The processional rosary prayer was led by the priests and friars at the beginning of the procession while the members of the Guardias de Honor de Maria led the rosary, once again in the Dominican format, at the tail end of the procession, following the Virgin. It was a solemn, beautiful yet nostalgic scene that one may felt that they traveled back in time where the Santo Rosario is commanding the procession in the old days of the Walled the City before the destructive War, especially when the procession passed by different old houses that can still be seen up to this day. At one point, the procession stopped when the bells of San Agustin Church was rang in her honor, welcoming her back to her old home. Although some thought it was for the Angelus but it was really a tribute to the Virgin.\n\nThe bell ringing lasted for a few minutes and I can truly say that it was an emotional moment and chills went to down to my spine, realizing that she was indeed in Intramuros, praying her rosary and joining her in procession just like what our ancestors did centuries ago in fulfillment of the vow the soldiers and the nation made to Our Lady in thanksgiving for the victory of the Spanish-Filipino forces against the invading Dutch fleet that threatened the archipelago. That moment of solemnity and a prayerful atmosphere is one of the best experience that something that was unfortunately missing in the recent La Naval processions in modern times due to endless distractions that we experienced that most of us are guilty of. It was at that point that I stopped taking pictures and be in the moment and it was a rewarding experience that my heart and my memory will always keep. As the procession progressed, I can’t help but notice that everyone was in prayer, praying for one’s intention, for one’s family and friends, an answer to a petition, for the nation in crisis due to a series of unfortunate events at the beginning of 2020 and for the Church who is constantly under attack by the current government and a constant victim of social media mockery by so-called “Christians” who are blinded by their pride and conceit.\n\nThe procession ended when it reached the Colegio grounds and made its triumphant entry. The students and the faithful cheered for their Queen and Mother once again and it was concluded with the singing of her hymns, most specifically “Ynvocacion a la Reina del Santisimo Rosario”, “O Beata Mater” and the haunting “Despedida a la Virgen”. An overnight vigil followed soon after which was open to the public where the traditional besamanto is in place.\n\nThe next day. January 25, 2020, the Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul, the farewell mass took place in the morning and after some farewell rites, the Virgin left Intramuros to go back to her present shrine in Quezon City once again though a motorcade. The moment she stepped out of Intramuros, all of us present at that moment realized that this moment will never happen again, and if it does, it might take another century or decades which most of us will never see in our lifetime.\n\nA take away on her historic visit\n\n“Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, Our Lady of La Naval. We gather as one people in celebration of a battle fought and won; a vow made and fulfilled; a time remembered and held dear; a miracle experienced and kept alive; love received and returned; your patronage sought and thanked for; God praised, God adored.” These were the first few lines of the Act of Consecration to Our Lady of the Rosary – La Naval de Manila that her devotees pray at the end of the novena and procession.\n\nNow that the Virgin is back to her current home after this historic event, what can we take away from this experience? In my opinion, I would say that see that despite the challenges that we face, regardless if it’s personal or of national concern, we would still cling to the Divine for help, just like what the Virgin did centuries ago. While I was about to go on a journey to Intramuros to be part of this historic event, nostalgia was already in mind and I believe that this was also one of the driving forces of most of the attendees who also wanted to witness her return. But as soon as the rosary prayers, the mass and her solemn procession took place, the nostalgic force changed gradually to that of act of devotion to the Blessed Mother where everyone in attendance are praying the rosary devoutly and witnessed some devotees tossed flowers to the Virgin while she was passing the old streets of Intramuros in her honor.\n\nI always believe that everything happens for a reason and her visit, looking at it in the eyes of faith, was an act of Divine providance. It is interesting to note that prior to her visit, we are bombarded with tragic events that challenged our country in the early part of 2020. Perhaps, her homecoming to Intramuros is God’s way of saying that He will comfort his people in the midst of crisis and He will help them rise again. In this case, he willed that the country’s Protectress to intervene through her presence alone to give comfort to our battered nation, so divided and bruised and gives us hope to rise again, if we once again put our trust to God through her.\n\nI will conclude this blog post in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary – La Naval de Manila with the lines of one of her beautful hymns that we rarely hear but it’s lyrics beautifully expresses our love and devotion to the country’s La Gran Señora de Filipinas:\n\nO Ina ni Kristo, Ina naming lahat,\n\nlingapin mo ang aming bayang Pilipinas,\n\nna ang debosyon sayo ay di kumukupas,\n\ntulad ng pagsamba sa Mahal mong Anak.\n\nKami’y nagdiriwang sa dakilang araw mo,\n\nnagpapasalamat kami, nagpupuri sayo,\n\nniluluwalhati ka, ikaw at si Kristo,\n\npinipintuhong Birhen, Reyna ng Rosaryo!\n\nRegina Sacratissimi Rosarii, Ora pro nobis.\n\nReferences:\n\n“Anales Ecclesiasticos de Philipinas”, Archdiocese of Manila Archives, Arzobispado de Manila, intramuros, Manila, 1995.\n\nCortez, O.P., Regino, “The Story of La Naval”.

Fr. Fidel Villaroel, OP\n\n[Originally Published in Philippiniana Sacra Vol. XXXIV, No. 12 (Sept. – Dec., 1999)]\n\nBlogger’s note: One of the most awaited season in the Philippines is the Christmas season where we are known to celebrate this season with so much merriment and it is rich with traditions that we still practice up to the present.One of the most cherished Christmas tradition that we still practice is the “Simbang Gabi” where the faithful hear dawn or evening masses for 9 concecutive days before Christmas – a Christmas novena if we are going to look at it that way. This venerable tradition became one of the most enduring that aside from the Masses itself, other practices were also done specifically on these 9 mornings: the selling of hot puto bumbong and bibingka, singing of carols among others.\n\nHowever, in the recent years, this venerable tradition is in danger of degeneration for unnecessary things that seems harmless yet it is slowly taking away the solemnity of the 9 morning masses from not observing the proper church attire by some of the faithful, using the tradition as an excuse to hang out with friends and lovers without bothering to participate in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, which is a sin. Whats worse is that other so-called “Christian denominations” are using the lure of “Simbang Gabi” to mislead the people to the wrong faith.\n\nTo understand what this tradition’s real purpose is to understand the origins of the Simbang Gabi, or better known as “The Aguinaldo Masses”. Although several articles were written about the Simbang Gabi tradition, it is the findings of the great Dominican archivist and historian, the late +Rev. Fr. Fidel Villaroel, OP, that shed some light on the factual origins of this venerable tradition and its purpose that evolved over the centuries.\n\nIn this modern age, I do believe that it is an opportune time to have this groundbreaking study be featured in this blog for the tradition is being challenged with the whims of modernity and to re asses on how we should view the Aguinaldo Masses is not just another Filipino Christmas tradition.\n\nEvery year, as the popular novena of “Aguinaldo Masses” is about to begin on December 16, journalists in our daily newspapers think it timely and relevant to write a column in the editorial section on the nature and significance of this Filipino religious tradition. Reviewing at random various mid-December issues of some newspapers in the last forty years, one finds the write-ups rather repetitious, superficial and stagnant. There is little progress in the field of research about the origins of these Masses and the reason for their celebration. There is confusion even about the names de Gallo and de Aguinaldo.\n\nFruitless are also the efforts of these writers to establish the origin of these Masses. For while this religious custom looks and sounds typically Filipino in songs, atmosphere and surroundings, some will think about possible pagan survivals in these Christian rites, others place their origins in Mexico or perhaps in Spain; or perhaps not, because they are unknown today there. And finally there exists a variety of opinions about the reason or intentions for which the Masses are celebrated at such early hours of the morning.\n\nThese Masses being among the oldest if not the oldest and most venerable religious traditions still existing in the Philippines, it seemed to me worthwhile to undertake a work of research on this matters in order to clarify, as far as possible, the various points of doubt often asked about the Misas de Aguinaldo.\n\nVotive Masses\n\nBefore discussing the origins of the Aguinaldo Masses in the Philippines, a short preamble on the liturgical character of these Masses may be in order, especially for lay readers who are not acquainted with technicalities regarding rituals and the great variety of Masses that are celebrated throughout the year.\n\nThe Aguinaldo Masses belong to a special kind of masses called votive in the liturgical books, in the old Missals as well as in the Post Vatican II Missals. Votive Masses are those that do not correspond with the Office of the day (the prayers said by priests in the Breviary and the Mass offered by them), but are said by choice of the celebrant, with special text and for particular intentions.\n\nAnyone handling the small daily Missal books for the use of the faithful will realize that proper masses are provided for every day of the year. These are daily proper Masses distributed throughout the various seasons of the liturgical year, namely, Advent, Christmas,Lent, Easter and the long post-Easter season called “Ordinary Time” until the next Advent season opens a new cycle. This applies to both the Sundays and the weekly masses. Then, there are Masses proper to the celebration or commemoration of the feasts of saints, which replace the Mass of the corresponding seasonal Mass.\n\nBut aside from these daily masses assigned to every day of the year, there are in the Roman Missal, and found at the end of it, a great variety of special masses called votive Masses, which the priest, not arbitrarily but following certain liturgical norms established by the Church, may choose to celebrate in special days for particular reasons and needs in substitution of the masses assigned to a given day: like a votive Mass of the Virgin Mary, of the Holy Spirit, of St. Joseph, for the dead, on a death anniversary, etc.\n\nThe practice of saying votive Masses is very ancient in the Church, going as far back as the fourth century. Christians then begun to ask for, and the Church to celebrate, special Masses for particular intentions, for instance, for the dead, for protection against enemies, for unity, for peace; Masses in time of earthquakes or storms, for a good harvest, for refugees, etc. Later, in the Middle Ages, the Church introduced the votive Masses in honor of saints (aside from the saints of the day), saints considered as special intercessors before God for obtaining certain spiritual or temporal benefits; Masses, for instance in honor of St. Raphael in view of a long journey to be undertaken, to St. Roche (San Roque) against plagues, and so on.\n\nIn addition, there were also votive Masses celebrated for one or other day of the week connected with some saint or Christian mystery, under certain liturgical norms. For instance, in honor of the Trinity on Mondays, of the Blessed Sacrament on Thursdays, of the Passion of Christ on Fridays, and, the most commonly celebrated, even in our times, the votive Mass in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary on Saturdays.’ Votive Masses have been preserved through the centuries, but as the centuries passed, some of them were kept in the Roman Missal, as most appropriated to the times, while some were eliminated. It is worth noting that the reformed Post-Vatican Roman Missal, instead of reducing the votive Masses with respect to earlier periods, increased their number considerably.\n\nThe Aguinaldo Masses being votive masses introduced by a particular church (Spain, Mexico or the Philippines) do not have a special text of their own in universal Roman Missal. But Rome has recognized them as privileged votive masses, celebrated “for grave or weighty reason” (pro re gravi) and with massive attendance of the faithful. The privilege given to them is manifested in allowing them to be celebrated instead of the daily Masses for the Advent season, which are catalogued in the liturgical calendar as first class ferial days.\n\nThe “Novenas” of Advent and the Expectant Mary\n\nAs every Catholic knows, the Church’s Liturgical Year begins with the first Sunday of the season of Advent. Advent is a period of preparation for the celebration of the Nativity of Christ. The entire liturgy of Advent, including the Divine Office recited by the clerics, and the Holy Mass, express in beautiful mystic spirit the deep feelings and the ardent longings of the Church for the arrival of the awaited Messiah and Savior of the World.\n\nIn that atmosphere of waiting, two biblical persons dominate the sacred readings, the antiphons and the songs, as symbolic of the nearness of the great event. Of the four weeks of Advent, the liturgy of the first two focus on the Precursor St. John the Baptist preaching in the desert with the powerful voice of a gigantic prophet. In the third and fourth weeks, the liturgy is centered on the person closest to Christ, Mary the expectant Mother.\n\nIt is of special interest for our study to underline how as Christmas looms near, the liturgy uses several series of prayers in the Office and in the Mass in numbers of seven, eight and nine. One of these series is precisely the novena of Masses celebrated in the Philippines known as Aguinaldo Masses. To be more specific, starting December 17 and ending with December 23, the Divine Office uses new hymns to introduce Lauds and Vespers. On the same days, a set of seven antiphons are used before and after each Psalm of Lauds and Vespers. The new hymns and the seven antiphons convey with greater intensity than in the previous days a sense of urgency in the spiritual preparation for the mystery of the God’s appearance in the world.\n\nAmong the series of antiphons used in the liturgy in those days, there are seven that are called “major antiphons” and also “O Antiphons.” These antiphons are recited or sung before and after Mary’s song, the Magnificat, at Vespers, from December 17 to the day of Christmas Eve. All the antiphons begin with the exclamation “O” (O Key of David, O Emmanuel, O Flower of Jesse, etc.), and end with the vivid cry of “come” addressed to the approaching Redeemer. Such antiphons are christological in content, but also Marian in the sense of being prayed together with Mary’s Magnificat.\n\nEven more significant for our case is that the Aguinaldo Masses are votive in honor of Mary, something that escapes the knowledge of the ordinary faithful. To make a brief digression at this point, the votive Masses in honor of Mary, which are said on Saturday all throughout the year, are provided with a special text on the Saturdays of Advent (de tempore Adventi). They are called “Rorate” Masses from the first words of the entrance song Rorate coeli desuper (“Let the clouds rain the Just One”); the verse before the Gospel is Hail Mary full of Grace, the angelic salutation at the Annunciation; and the Communion antiphon begins with the words The Virgin is with Child. Further to show the intimate connection between the last period of Advent and the devotion to Mary the Expectant Theotokos (Mother of God), let us turn attention to Spain, where the Aguinaldo Masses had their origin.\n\nIn former times, the Church in Spain and in some parts of France celebrated on December 18 a feast in honor of the Virgin Mary called the “Expectation of the Delivery of Mary,” and by other names “Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza” and “Nuestra Señora de la O.” Our Lady of Hope obviously referred to the hope that soon a Child would be born of Mary. Our Lady of the “O” had reference to what we have explainēd – earlier, that is, to the recitation of the major antiphons “O” before and after Mary’s song Magnificat at Vespers of the Divine Office. In this connection it is interesting that Maria de la O is a name formerly used in Spain for women, perhaps not very commonly, and probably not given to any woman in our times.\n\nFor the purpose of the present study, what is more important to note is that the Aguinaldo Masses were and are, in fact, votive Masses in honor of Mary. The color of the liturgical vestments of these Masses are not the purple of Advent, but the color of all Marian Masses, white; and the text of the Aguinaldo Masses were those of the votive Masses for Mary “tempore Adventus” (in Advent). And for further and final proof of their Marian character, there is the explicit intention of dedicating them to Mary as it was done in the countries of Spain, Mexico and the Philippines from the beginning.\n\nThe Aguinaldo Masses in Spain\n\nIt is not possible for us to determine the exact time in which the practice of celebrating the Aguinaldo Masses was introduced in Spain. We know, however, that as early as the seventh century the Holy Mass was already said there for the particular intentions of certain persons, and that before the 8th century votive Masses were celebrated there in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary.’ But it is not until the last decades of the sixteenth century that documents show that Masses called de Aguinaldo were celebrated in Spain.\n\nThe first available testimony to this effect comes from the famous Jesuit canonist and missionary in the Philippines, Fr Pedro Murillo Velarde. In his work “Cursus Juris Canonici Hispanici et Indici”, published in 1743, Murillo quotes a certain classical canonical book under the name of “Grijalbanus” as stating that “Pope Sixtus V granted a plenary indulgence to those who attended these Masses, which we call in Spanish “de Aguinaldo. ” Now Sixtus V was Pope from 1585 to 1890. This grant presupposes that such Masses were well established at least in some parts of Spain before the last decade of the 16th century. Furthermore, from other testimonies, we have knowledge of the fact that in 1585, the Aguinaldo Masses were said in Mexico, and that being the case, they must have existed in Spain much earlier.\n\nEven the very appellate name of these Masses denotes Spanish origins. In relation to them, there has always been in Spain the Misa de Gallo, which is celebrated at midnight of December 24 even today, and is wrongly used by many Filipinos when referring to the novena of dawn Masses celebrated in this country. In Spain, when the Masses de Aguinaldo existed, they were celebrated in the early hours of the morning. It is curious that the old documents in this regard use two different spellings of the word. For instance, we find in a work of Aloysius Gardellini (1856) the use of “Aguilando” and “Aquilando,” while other authors, like Vicente Salazar, O.P. (1742), the Anales Eclesiásticos de Filipinas (end of the 18th century) and Benito Corominas, O.P. (1875) write it as we do today, that is, “Aguinaldo.” Aguinaldo is a Spanish word of very limited use, for it means “a Christmas gift”, that is, a gift given during the Christmas season, especially on Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, and Epiphany or “Three Kings.” And it is never used when making a “regalo” throughout the rest of the year.\n\nAs to why this name is used for these Masses, one interpretation could be that the Christian faithful offer to God nine Masses as a gift on the occasion of the Birth of Jesus, to him and to his mother. Another could be that the Church rejoices at receiving from God the gift of his son, the Word, at the time he is born human. From their inception in Spain, a peculiar trait of these Masses was that they were said much earlier than the ordinary daily Masses.\n\nIn three documents of the 17th century referring to these Masses, they are said to be celebrated “summo mane” (very early in the morning), “ad auroram” (ad dawn) and “antequam dies illuxerit” (before daybreak). We come now to the establishment of historical facts. Two authoritative documents testify to the existence of the Aguinaldo Masses in Spain by the end of the 17th century in two dioceses of Spain, namely, Seville and Granada.\n\nInterested parties in both dioceses submitted queries to the Sacred Congregation of Rites describing the Masses and asking for clarification of some doubts.\n\nIn December of 1676, the Presbyter Diego Diaz de Escobar, Master of Ceremonies of the Cathedral Church of Seville, presented to the Sacred Congregation of Rites a list of nine queries regarding various customs practiced in that Archdiocese. Question 7 refers to the Masses popularly called de Aguinaldo. From the terms of the exposition, we cull the following elements that describe them:\n\nThe Aguinaldo Masses are celebrated nine days before the Nativity of Christ;\n\nthey are said at dawn;\n\nthese votive Masses are called by the people “de Aguilando”;\n\nthey are celebrated in honor of the expectant Mother of God;\n\nthey are said not only in ordinary weekdays (ferial days), but even on special feasts days (of dupplex class) and on Sundays;\n\nlike in great feasts, Gloria and Credo are sung, and only one Prayer is said;\n\nthere is a great popular devotion to these Masses.\n\nThe exposition and query end by informing the Sacred Congregation about certain anomalies and abuses that had crept in the celebration of the Masses, which called for a remedy.\n\nNotwithstanding the condemnatory declaration of the Holy See against the abuses mentioned in the above query, five years later, a similar query was received in the Holy See from the city of Granada. In 1681, Fr. Juan de Arjona Valle, of the Franciscan Friars of the Observance, wrote to the Sacred Congregation of the Rites presenting three doubts and queries.\n\nThe request of the petitioner implies that there was some decree already issued by the said Vatican Congregation downgrading the solemnity of the Aguinaldo Masses sung in honor of the Virgin Mary popularly called de Aguinaldo.” Now, the request explains, the elimination of the festive and solemn elements of the Masses, by taking away the Gloria, the Credo and the single Prayer, and their reduction to the category of an ordinary votive Mass, has resulted in great inconveniences “in Spain, and especially in the convents of the Friars,” for two reasons: first, because in many convents such Masses were celebrated by special request and intention of the people, with massive attendance of the faithful, and with a sermon; secondly, if now the Masses were not to be sung and the sermon not preached, the convent would not perceive the stipend or offering given for an Aguinaldo Mass, which constituted a source of maintenance for the community.\n\nFr. Arjona is asking, therefore, whether the Sacred Congregation of Rites would allow the return to the former solemn celebration, the characteristics of which are similar to those found in the earlier request of the church of Seville:\n\nThey are nine Masses said before Christmas at a very early hour of the morning;\n\nthey are sung with Gloria and Credo;\n\nthe custom “comes from very ancient times beyond memory”;\n\nthe Masses are celebrated due to the great popular devotionto the Virgin Mary;\n\nand the devotees want the Masses offered `pro re gravi” (for a grave and weighty reason or intention),\n\nthat is, “for the recently sowed fields and for the well-being of the whole people” (pro agris nuper seminatis et pro salute totius populi).’\n\nFrom these two expositions, it is clear that the Aguinaldo Masses were celebrated in Spain much earlier that the seventeenth century with a solemnity and festive mood not dissimilar to what we see today in the Philippines. In view of the second request made from Granada, it is well to take note here of the explicit intention for which the Messes were celebrated: the fertility of the sowed fields and health and well being of the people. The intention was timely. A great part of the arable lands in Spain are sowed in the autumn season waiting to sprout in spring.\n\nI must not bypass an objection commonly made against the Spanish origins of the Aguinaldo Masses. The objection comes from what we read in a report written in the seventeenth century by a Jesuit missionary in the Philippines, Fr. Francisco Ignacio Alcina, a report to be quoted more fully later in this study. In his extraordinary studies on all aspects of the Philippines of his times, specially the Visayas region, Alcina does not fail to deal with the religious celebrations, and in particular with the Aguinaldo Masses. About them he says that the first time he saw them was in Mexico, but not in his native Spain: “Que en España yo no to vi” (in Spain I did not see them).”\n\nThis statement needs a brief commentary. Fr. Ignacio Alcina was born in the town of Gandia, province of Valencia, Spain, in 1610, and he entered the Society of Jesus in 1624. In 1631 when he left for the Philippines, his -residence was the city of Zaragoza, in the northern region of Aragon. That Fr. Alcina never saw Aguinaldo Masses celebrated in Spain, as he states, is one thing; that the Masses were not said anywhere in Spain is quite another. Eastern Spain, where Valencia is, and even more northern Spain where Aragon is, have extreme cold temperatures in December, while southern Spain, the Adalucian region of Seville and Granada, has a temperate climate even in winter.\n\nTo celebrate Aguinaldo Masses for nine days in northern Spain at dawn in the middle of winter would have entailed excessive inconvenience to people especially the elderly and the children. It is unlikely that these Masses would have had a favorable massive response. It is, therefore, very possible that Fr. Alcina did not actually see the Aguinaldo Masses in the areas where he spent his early life, while such Masses were certainly celebrated in the southern cities of Granada and Seville where they were very popular and where they were attended by big assemblies of the faithful.\n\nThe Aguinaldo Masses in the Azores and in Mexico\n\nExplorers, conquistadors, colonizers and missionaries; language, laws, customs and traditions: all of them traveled from Spain to the New World westward with the sails of the galleons. This was also the case with the practice of the Aguinaldo Masses. They were carried by the Spanish missionaries to Mexico (New Spain) in the early years of the evangelization of America. In relation to these traveling of so many things from the Old Continent to the New, we have found with surprise that the Aguinaldo Masses existed, some time in the past, in the Azores Islands, a bridge or stepping stone placed in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The Azores have never been linked to Spain; they were always a colony (today an autonomous region) of Portugal. In 1534, the small archipelago of nine islands became a diocese, suffragan of Lisbon, which was called “Anagrenesis” from the town ofAngra, capital of one of the islands, the Terceira.\n\nNow we come to the point of interest for our study. On a date we have not been able to establish, a document related to this Diocese speaks an ancient custom of celebrating nine Holy Masses in honor of the Virgin Mary before the Nativity of Christ. The document is a query elevated by that Diocese to the Sacred Congregation of Rites: “Whether, in consideration of being a very ancient (antiquissima) custom, it could be licit to celebrate the nine votive Masses in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary before the Nativity of the Lord, even though some of them coincide with the feast of St Thomas the Apostle [December 21] and on the 3rd and 4th Sundays of Advent.” The Sacred Congregation replied that, considering the multitude of the faithful who attend those Masses, they may be sung. No name is given to this novena of Masses, but it is clear that they were no different in character from the Aguinaldo Masses of southern Spain.\n\nThe voyage across the Atlantic ended in Mexico, New Spain. In Mexico, the Aguinaldo Masses must have been introduced in the sixteenth century by the earliest missionaries. For they are the subject matter of a decree enacted by the Third Provincial Council of Mexico held on 1585. That Council, presided over by Archbishop Pedro Moya de Contreras, was convoked with the aim of implementing the doctrinal and disciplinary decrees of the Council of Trent. It was the most important and complete of all the Mexican Councils and its influence was transcendental for two centuries.\n\nThe aforementioned decree is part of the chapter on “the celebration of Masses and of the Divine Office,” and it reads as follows: “Nullus Missam ante auroram nec post meridiem (nisi privilegio sibi ad it concesso) celebret. Missae vero quas hispanice de Aguinaldo vocant antequam dies illuxerit ne celebrentur.” (No one may celebrate Mass before sunrise, nor in the afternoon, unless a privilege has been granted to him to do so. Besides, the Masses called in Spanish de Aguinaldo must not be celebrated before daybreak).\n\nFrom this conciliar provision it can be surmised that the Aguinaldo Masses were well established in Mexico by the year 1585, for the Council introduces a change in its celebration, that is, regarding the hour of their celebration that should not by before daybreak.\n\nForty years after this Council, the Aguinaldo Masses continued to be very popular in Mexico, judging from a report coming to us from the personal experience of the Jesuit missionary Fr. Ignacio Francisco Alcina, already quoted in this study. Father Alcina arrived in Mexico on August 1, 1631 on his way to the Philippines, leaving Mexico on February of the following year. It was therefore in the season of Advent of 1631 that he witnessed the celebration of the Aguinaldo Masses there. Here is his report:\n\n“The first time that I heard about and saw these festive manifestations of the nine Masses (de Aguilando), was in Mexico, where their celebration is very much spread. It was in the Seminary for the natives which our Society [of Jesus] has in that city, called St Gregory Seminary, where I first began to appreciate it, [and this not only] for the well-known and revealing circumstances of its celebration, but also for its reverential, religious and solemn air. I say that it came here [to the Philippines] from Mexico without any doubt (in Spain I did not see it. It must have been brought to these Islands where it is celebrated with no less ostentation.”\n\nAnd this is the last time we hear about the Mexican tradition before the Masses were prohibited in 1677, as it is will be seen below.\n\nThe Aguinaldo masses in the Philippines As far as I can know, no historical document has yet been found giving us a clue about the first time and place of the celebration of the Aguinaldo Masses in the Philippines. Two Jesuit missionaries will lead us to establish approximate dates of their celebration in the 17th and 18th centuries. They are Fr. Francisco Ignacio Alcina and Fr. Pedro Murillo Velarde. Later on, a Dominican will be added as witness: Fr. Vicente Salazar, in the 18th century.\n\nFr. Ignacio Alcina, “one of the most outstanding and indefatigable missionaries in the entire Visayas region”, has already been quoted in this study. Born in Spain, and after entering the Society of Jesus in 1624, he arrived in the Philippines in 1631. After staying two and a half years in Manila, he was assigned to the Visayan missions in 1634, where he worked as missionary for the rest of his life, except for another brief period of residence in Manila from 1658 to 1660. All through these years Alcina moved from one island to another in the provinces of Samar, Leyte, Panay and Cebu. He died in 1674.\n\nAlcina’s references to the Aguinaldo Masses do not specify particular places, but apply to the Visayas in general and presumably Manila also, but they might apply to the entire Philippines as well. These references are found in his monumental work Historia de las Islas e Indios de Bisayas in 1668, which he left unpublished. The voluminous work has been praised as “true, meticulous and most exhaustive,” “the achievement of a very erudite man,” “a masterpiece of history. In Chapter 12 of the Second Part, dealing with the Advent celebrations in this country in his times, that is, between 1634 and 1674, Alcina describes, among the Advent devotions, those in honor of St. Francis Xavier (December 4), the great evangelizer of India and of the Far East, and those in honor of the Immaculate Conception of Mary (December 8). Explaining the latter feast, Alcina ponders how the “new Christians” in Visayas are pleased with everything that pertains to the devotion to Mary. And he continues:\n\n“As a result of this devotion, there are established in our communities the Masses they called de Aguilando. This devotion consists of nine Masses and begins on the 16th of December (and continues on) till the 24th, which is the Vigil of the Nativity.”\n\nThen Alcina refers to the practice of these Masses in Mexico, as we have previously described. And he adds:\n\n“It [this devotion] must have been brought [from Mexico] to these Islands, where it is celebrated with no less ostentation [than in Mexico]. And in this new ministry [Visayas], as far and as much as possible, we say the nine Masses, all sung [to the accompaniment] of excellent music, carols, musical instruments and all that fosters devout expression of such a holy Expectation [i.e. of Christ’s birth] . Although the Masses here are not as early as elsewhere…”\n\nIt is unfortunate that, at this point, one folio is missing in Alcina’s original text, depriving us of further details about the celebrations he was describing. But from the little that was left, we are informed not only about the early existence of this religious celebration but also about their connection with the veneration of the Virgin Mary the expectant Mother of God and with the Nativity on earth of God’s Word.\n\nThe second Jesuit missionary reporting on the Aguinaldo Masses in this country is Fr. Pedro Murillo Velarde, whose testimony proves the continuation of this tradition one century after Fr. Alcina. For a brief situationer, let us say that Murillo was born in 1696 in Laujar, Granada, Spain. Having joined the Society of Jesus in 1718, he arrived in the Philippines in 1723. After working in these Islands for twenty six years, he returned to his native Spain, where he died in 1753.\n\nBesides a very valuable history of the Jesuits in the Philippines, Fr. Murillo wrote a canonical treatise entitled Curs us Juris Canonici Hispanici et Indici, printed in 1763 and re-edited in 1779. 25 This work was very much appreciated by canonists here, and in fact it was used in the nineteenth century as textbook in the Faculty of Canon Law of the University of Santo Tomas. It is in this book that Fr. Murillo, discussing the ecclesiastical norms about votive Masses, enters into certain details about the Aguinaldo Masses. Although we have not been able to find a copy of Murillo’s work, we know his information through quotations made from him by a nineteenth century Canon Law professor of the University of Santo Tomas, Fr. Benito Corominas.\n\nIn the Philippines, Fr. Murillo Velarde wrote in 1763, a solemn Mass is celebrated every Saturday in honor of the Virgin Mary, using texts appropriate of the Advent season. This Mass is said with special solemnity, with Gloria et Credo; and the intention of the celebrants and assistants is:\n\n“for the perseverance of the natives in the faith and for the preservation of Religion in this part of the world; certainly a very weighty reason for the advancement of Religion”.\n\nAt this point Velarde passes from the Saturday votive Masses to the Aguinaldo Masses:\n\n“Then, in the nine days preceding the Nativity of the Lord, some Masses are celebrated in the same way and for the same intention, but with a text pertaining to the Advent season. The faithful who attend these Masses, called by us in Spanish de Aguinaldo, gain a plenary indulgence granted by Sixtus V in 1585.”\n\nBy way of summary, these testimonies of Alcina and Velarde are sufficient to prove that the Aguinaldo Masses existed in the Philippines from the early years of evangelization, through the 17th and 18th centuries. Shortly we will see that such a venerable tradition would continue until our times, except for a brief period when the Masses were prohibited by the Sacred Congregation of Rites in the Holy See. Prohibition of the Masses. It is a fact that today the celebration of the Aguinaldo Masses has disappeared from Spain, the Azores Islands and Mexico, while it is still holding out in the Philippines.\n\nHere the Masses are attended with undiminished enthusiasm in spite of the defying changes of modern life and mentality. This surprising phenomenon must be explained. In the first place, the disappearance of the Aguinaldo Masses in those countries was not due to loss of popular fervor, but to excess of it and to the intervention of the high ecclesiastical authorities. By the year 1677 several abuses were reported to have crept during or around the celebration of the Aguinaldo Masses. Those abuses scandalized many people who were `zealous for the observance of good liturgical rites, also causing “scruples to learned and spiritual men” on account of the disorderly manner of expressing the joyful anticipation of Christmas. The abuses had nothing to do with the sacramental aspect of the Mass itself, nor with attitudes of the celebrant priest, but with the behavior of the assembly and specially of the choir.\n\nThe complaints of such zealous people moved the Master of Ceremonies of the Cathedral Church in Seville, Spain, to submit, at the end of 1676, a query to the Sacred Congregation of Rites, asking this\n\nRoman dicastery to issue a formal declaration on the matter. In his exposition, the petitioner describes in Doubt 3 the character and traditional celebration of these Masses, as we have described above, and then he passes on to explain the abuses:\n\n“Under pretense of popular devotion and to add more flavor to the celebration, improper things are done which need to be corrected. For many lay people assemble in the choir of the church for the purpose of singing certain light songs (cantinelas) that provoke to laughter and are improper of the time and place. Opportune remedy must be applied to this abuse, so that the public scandal may be totally eliminated.”\n\nOn January 16, 1677 the Sacred Congregation replied with the following declaration:\n\n“In as much as this custom, or to put it better, these abuses, exposed in Doubt 3 are contrary to the Rubrics and to the opinion of the exponents, they must be suppressed totally, because not only are they not laudable, but rather they are scandalous, more so to those who are zealous for the observance of good liturgical rites. This is so declared and decreed [by this Sacred Congregation], which hereby orders the above to be totally suppressed.”\n\nThe decree took effect immediately upon receipt of it in Spain, Mexico and the Philippines. Therefore, the Aguinaldo Masses were either totally discontinued or they were reduced to a lower rank of ordinary votive Masses in honor of the Virgin Mary, without solemnity, without the singing of Gloria and Credo, without sermon and other festive manifestation used until then.\n\nIn Spain an attempt was made to have the Aguinaldo Masses reestablished in some places. In 1682, the Superior Provincial of the Franciscan Province in Granada, Fr. Juan de Arjona Valle, presented to the Sacred Congregation of Rites a request for dispensation from the prohibition, alleging several great inconveniences (including the loss of alms for the maintenance of the Community) that the Roman decree of prohibition had caused to them. But the Sacred Congregation, with a Declaration dated January 24, 1682 answered with a laconic “negative”.\n\nTheir Suppression and Survival in the Philippines\n\nIt took about three years for the Roman decree of 1677 to arrive in the Philippines, via Spain and Mexico, not a surprising delay considering the bureaucratic procedures of the Royal Patronage of the Indies and the slow system of communications through two oceans and the Church. They were tolerated under the guise of devotion, and although they seemed bad to some, these ones did not dare to denounce them publicly for fear of attracting the ire of the piety of the common people. The handling of these matters belongs to the zeal and care of the Prelates”\n\n“We are informed by the Anales Ecclesiásticos de Filipinas that “a copy [of that Decree] was received from the Archbishopric of Mexico, where the Masses had already been prohibited and are no longer sung.” That was in 1682.\n\nIn this year the Archdiocese of Manila was governed by Archbishop-Elect Felipe Pardo, OP., who had been promoted to that office in 1676. For all canonical purposes, he had all the faculties to govern the Archdiocese even though he had not received the Pontifical Bull of nomination and had not received the Episcopal Ordination. He received both in 1681. Now, in 1680, having received the Roman declaration prohibiting the Aguinaldo Masses, Archbishop-Elect Pardo “communicated the matter to, and asked for the advice of, learned persons of the Religious Orders,” and consequently issued an “auto” or decree which he “ordered to be posted at the doors of the churches” of Manila. This being a document of transcendental importance for our subject, we may well transcribe in full, but in the decree, it is stated that:\n\n“We, Dr. Don Fray Felipe Pardo, Archbishop-Elect of this Metropolitan Church of Manila, of the Council of his Majesty, and Governor of this Archdiocese, etc. Whereas it has come to our knowledge that a decree has arrived prohibiting the celebration of the Masses that are sung for nine days before the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ (which are commonly called de Aguinaldo), enjoining that they absolutely may not be sung, forbidding also all kinds of music and instruments and light songs (chanzonetas), prohibition be observed and kept in this archdiocese;\n\nTherefore, by this present decree We order that absolutely in no way may such Aguinaldo Masses be sung or said, that no rejoicing of music be made, no instruments be played or light songs or any other songs be sung even if they are transformed into religious tunes (aunque sean a to divino). Those who will do the contrary, disobeying the commandments of our Holy Mother Church and our injunctions, will suffer the public punishment that will be inflicted on them. And we order that this decree be posted at the doors of the churches of this City and that it be forwarded to the (Cathedral) canons for their information.\n\nGiven at San Gabriel, “Extramuros” of Manila, on this 12th day of October of the year 1680.\n\nFray Felipe Pardo,\n\nArchbishop-Elect of Manila\n\nBy order of the Archbishop, my Lord,\n\nAndres Escoto,\n\nSecretary”\n\nThe author of the Anales Eclesiásticos comments: “And so in this year 1680 [the Masses] begun to be omitted and not to be sung.” For how long? We do not know exactly. But the Dominican historian Fr. Vicente Salazar, writing the history of his Order in the Philippines, published in Manila in 1742, gives us a sure answer and an approximate date: “While [Archbishop Pardo] lived, the Masses were not celebrated, but after [his death] they began to be celebrated again, although with some moderation (I do not know if this was universal) with regard to the abuses with which they had been celebrated.” or in other religious feasts”.\n\nOn with the Tradition Historian Salazar assures us that the celebration of the Aguinaldo Masses was resumed after Archbishop Pardo’s death, but he does not inform us about the exact date or about the authority on which the Masses were permitted again. Nor can we find any document to that respect. What is not difficult to assess is that the celebration once resumed has continued through the centuries without interruption.\n\nHere are some testimonies:\n\nIn the 18th century, Pedro Murillo Velarde, writing his manual of Canon Law before 1763 , describes the celebration with the details we have already mentioned. In the 19th century, Fr. Benito Corominas, O.P., writing in 1873 his commentaries on the canonical works of Giovanni Devoti, attests to the celebrations of these Masses in his time (“et hoc anno celebrantur”, they are celebrated this year).\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Fr. Serapio Tamayo, another Dominican canonist, in his inaugural address of the school-year 1906-1907, at the University of Santo Tomas, states that this religious “custom has been continued in this capital [Manila], where the Aguinaldo Masses continue to be celebrated in some churches [of Intramuros].”\n\nIn 1953, the First Plenary Council of the Philippines, attended by the entire Philippine Hierarchy, drafted a special decree regarding the Aguinaldo Masses, which may be considered as the most solemn ratification and consecration of one of the oldest traditions of the Philippine Catholic religiosity. The decree is worth transcribing here:\n\nThere is a legitimate tradition in these Islands coming from ancient times to celebrate the Masses popularly called de Aguinaldo for the perseverance of Filipinos in the [Christian] faith and for the preservation of religion in this area of the world. For nine days preceding the Nativity of Christ the Lord, the solemn votive Mass “Rorate Coeli desuper” is sung with great solemnity and with massive attendance by the people, one Mass every day in the churches, especially the parochial and conventual ones.\n\nThese Masses are celebrated with Gloria, a proper Prayer with other commemorative prayer of the concurrent Advent ferial Mass, with preface of the Blessed Virgin Mary and with the Gospel of St. John at the end, except on Sundays and on First Class feasts that may coincide [with the Aguinaldo Mass].”\n\nBut six years after this statement of the Hierarchy in a Plenary Council, a new Code of Rubrics or Code of Liturgical Norms valid for the universal Church was published in 1961 by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, with the approval of Pope John XXIII. The Code revoked “all statutes, privileges and customs of any kind, even the multisecular and most ancient ones, which are not in accordance with this Codex.”\n\nHowever, the Vatican new rulings left some leeway for special Masses celebrated “for grave and public reasons.” This exceptive clause notwithstanding, since some people the ught that the Aguinaldo Masses might fall into the category of the suppressed customs, the Philippine Hierarchy, through their President, Archbishop Julio Rosales of Cebu, decided to elevate to the Holy Father in the same year 1961 a suppliant letter “humbly asking that, in spite of the promulgation of the new Code of Rubrics, and for as long as the same grave reason, namely the conservation of the Faith [in the Philippines] continued, the Aguinaldo Masses be allowed to be sung for nine days preceding the Nativity.” And the petition was granted on March 24, 1961, for a period of five years.”\n\nThe historical study on the origins of the Aguinaldo Masses should end here, leaving the canonical and liturgical aspects to canonists and liturgists. There is the question of the expiration of the above-mentioned authorization of the Holy See valid for a period of “five years.” This writer has not found any document as to whether a renewal of the authorization was requested and granted or whether there was no need for renewing it.\n\nWe doubt about that need because before the concession expired in 1966, the Vatican Council came upon the Church marking a new era in many aspects of the Church in our modern world. One of the most visible changes introduced were the liturgical reforms. It is for canonists and liturgists to explain how the conciliar and post-conciliar documents affected the Aguinaldo Masses. For such study there are several basic documents issued after the Council, plus a new Roman Missal.\n\nAs the Second Millenium is ending this month of December, Catholic Philippines still clings strongly to the centuries old tradition of celebrating the Aguinaldo Masses, with undiminished popular attendance and festive joy, for the same reasons adduced in ancient times, but with some changes and trends caused by the “Filipinos’ changing life style” in our consumer society. Regarding the reasons or main intent of the celebration, it is significant to observe something most people cannot notice. That is, that the “grave reasons” that our ancestors in Spain, Mexico and the Philippines adduced for celebrating these Masses, were the reasons repeated in the Plenary Council of 1953, and exactly the same ones stated in the Ordo 1999 [Liturgical calendar for guidance of priest reciting the Divine Office].\n\nHere is the informative note of the Ordo on December 15, 1999: “Tomorrow begin the Aguinaldo Masses (white color), to be celebrated on the nine days before Christmas for the perseverance of the nation in faith and the preservation of our holy religion in this part of the world.” Let us note also that “white color” is the color of the Marian celebrations, while the color of the Advent Masses is purple.\n\nThe new trends introduced in the last few years are not essential to the Mass itself, but to circumstantial —yet very typically traditional— aspects of these Masses. We refer to the time and places of their celebration. Some Masses are now being said in the evening, and not only in the churches and chapels but also in megamalls and commercial centers, “obviously geared for the mall’s clientele, especially those rushing to finish their Christmas shopping,” or ” to accommodate employees in the commercial districts who find free time only after office hours .”\n\nThese are still considered Aguinaldo Masses, preparatory for Christmas, but the mystic of the “Dawn Masses” must be missing when celebrating the “Simbang Gabi” Masses in those places. One wonders what the new trends will become one century hence.\n\nReferences:\n\n“Acta et Decreta Primi Concilii Plenarii Philippinarum”, Manila 1956, n. 356, p. 126.\n\n“Alcina’s Report on the celebration of the feasts in the XVII Century Samar and Leyte,” Philippiniana Sacra, XVI, 46, (January-April 1981).\n\nGardellini, Aloisius,”Decreta autentica Congregationis Sacrorum Rituum”, Roma 1856, I p. 491; II, pp. 35-36.\n\nKobak, Kantius, OFM, “The Great Samar Leyte Bisayan Missionary of the 17th Century,” in Philippiniana Sacra, XIII, 39 (Sept.-Dec. 1978), p. 402.\n\nLang, Jovian, OFM, “Dictionary of Liturgy”, New York 1989, p. 461.\n\nRicchetti, Mario, “Historia de la Liturgia, Biblioteca de Autores Cristianos”, Madrid, 1956, II, pp. 114-119.\n\nSalazar, Vicente, OP, “Historia de la Provincia del Santísimo Rosario de Filipinas”, Manila 1742, pp. 493-494.\n\nTamayo, Serapio, OP, “Idea General de la Disciplina Ecclesiástica en Filipinas durante la Dominación Española (Discurso Inaugural)”, UST, Manila 1906, p. 78.\n\nVelarde, Pedro Murillo, SJ, “Cursus Juris Canonici Hispanici et Indici”, Madrid 1743.\n\nVelarde, Pedro Murillo, SJ, “Historia de la Provincia de Filipinas de la Compañía de Jesús, desde el año 1616 hasta 1716”, Manila 1749.\n\nYlla, Juan, OP, “Sobre las Misas de Aguinaldo,” in Boletin Eclesiastico de Filipinas, November 1935, p. 724.\n\nSpecial thanks to the owners of the photographs used in this blogpost.\n\n+AM+DG+ +AMPSPC+\n\nIn loving memory of +Rev. Fr. Fidel Villaroel, OP who became one of my inspirations and mentors that led me to the inception and creation of this blog.\n\nThe month of December is one of the most colorful months that Filipinos await because of its unique Christmas season where we celebrate the birth of Christ with the old traditions that we practice and celebrate with our families. Interestingly, it is also in the month of December that there were numerous feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary that are celebrated from celebrating some key episodes of her life and other Marian sobriquets and apparitions.\n\nOne of the most important Marian feasts that is celebrated in the month of December is the Feast of the Immaculate Conception where we give thanks to God for the singular grace He gave to the Blessed Virgin Mary by preserving her from the stain of original sin to prepare her for the role as the Mother of God, the Redeemer of the World. Numerous countries took the Blessed Mother as the Immaculate Conception as its Patroness and one of them is the Philippines.\n\nAs the “Pueblo Amante de Maria”, we always make sure that we celebrate the feast of our nation’s Patroness with much grandeur and solemnity and this can be seen in different towns, cities, and provinces in the Philippines that it would extend for a number of days in some cities and provinces.\n\nOne of the most popular and prominent celebrations in honor of the Immaculate Conception in our country is the annual Grand Marian Procession (also known as Intramuros Grand Marian Procession) which is held every first Sunday of December in the historic Walled City of Intramuros, Manila were numerous images of the Blessed Virgin Mary from different families, parishes, organizations and shrines gathered together in a single event to celebrate and honor the Blessed Mother in her different titles and attributes in thanksgiving to the graces and protection she bestowed to her chosen nation.\n\nThe rebuilding of the Walled City\n\nWith the establishment of the Intramuros Administration in 1979, the goal of the then-new agency was to bring back life into what was then a neglected backwater at the heart of Manila. Works on the fortifications were relatively easy and soon afterward the walls, the moat, the old Plazas, portals, and tunnels were rehabilitated and restored. Museum collecting also began, concentrating on painting, sculpture (mainly Santos), furniture, and domestic furnishings of the Spanish era now beautifully installed in different museums inside the Walled City.\n\nThe Procession\n\nWhen rebuilding Intramuros was about to complete and with the success of festivals and cultural shows that was staged in the Walled City proven to be a success, the Intramuros Administration thought of the impossible – to revive the old religious processions that once snaked its way in its old cobbled streets.\n\nThe agency decided to try to revive processions inside the Walled City, one for the month of December in honor of the Immaculate Conception – the Patroness of the Philippines, and a Holy Week procession. The agency tapped Mr. Conrado Escudero, a known patron of the culture and arts, of Villa Escudero in Quezon Province and the person behind the spectacular Holy Week processions of San Pablo City, Laguna, to organize the undertaking.\n\nWith Mrs. Helen B. Espino as the first Hermana Mayor, the first procession was held with two dozen participating images from different families and shrines in the country. Ms. Irene Marcos walked behind the carroza of the festejada, representing her mother, then First Lady Imelda Marcos who was then abroad.\n\nThe procession would then start at San Agustin Church and the procession wound around the streets of Intramuros and end in Plaza Roma at dusk, with brilliantly lit carrozas arrayed in a spectacle for a long period of time. A Te Deum was sung at the Cathedral amidst pealing bells, a ceremony attended by government and business leaders, religious communities, and the faithful who participated in the event.\n\nThe procession became a resounding success with numerous faithful in attendance and it caught the wind of Marian devotees all over the country.\n\nThe Festejada\n\nThe focal point, or we should say, the last image of the Grand procession is the image of Nuestra Señora de la Inmaculada Concepcion – Mater Purisima more popularly known as ‘La Festejada” (Image used for festivities). The “La Festejada” image is a de vestir image of the Blessed Virgin Mary presented in a typical Philippine iconography of the Immaculate Conception that is seen in numerous shrines in the country: the Virgin is standing upright while crushing the serpent, her hands clasped in prayer or held together, the face looking at the beholder, wearing an intricate vestment, mostly a de bastidor vestment (A vestment with a wide opening) mostly of blue and white tone with the cape done in “palikpik” style, and sports a crown, a scepter, the diagnostic doce estrellas and a set of jewels that adorn the image that was given by the Grand Procession’s Hermanos Mayores, officials and members of the Intramuros Administration and the Cofradia de la Inmaculada Concepcion, Inc.\n\nSince the original festejada image of the Immaculate Conception of the Franciscans was destroyed during the War, a new image was commissioned, incorporating an antique ivory head and hands with a new bastidor body and set of vestments. The new festejada image was blessed at San Agustin Church on December 7, 1980 by Rec. Fr. Gregorio Liqueta, OSA. A silver-plated museum carroza bought from a Pampanga family was reconditioned and improved for the use of the festejada image.\n\nThe image at present is currently kept at the Museo de Intramuros where the ruins of the old San Ignacio Chruch and Convento of the Jesuits stand.\n\nThe Cofradia and its apostolate\n\nIn the second year of the Grand Procession in 1980, Philanthropist Ms. +Imelda Cojuangco, the Hermana Mayor of the Grand Procession that year and a known Marian devotee, decided to organize a Cofradia (Confraternity) that not only supervised the now annual Marian event. Ms. +Cojuangco, the founding chair of the Cofradia de la Inmaculada Concepcion, Inc., stressed that this is not “… a social club or a society organization. It is a group of devotees of the Virgin Mary. We have recollections and pilgrimages. It’s not a high-society thing”. The Cofradia gained recognition from the Archdiocese of Manila and made the Archbishop of Manila its honorary chairman.\n\nAside from organizing the Grand Marian Procession, the Cofradia also has its own apostolate from visiting imprisoned women and sponsors the introduction of 500 children from depressed areas to the Eucharist, apart from several other charitable–and unsung–activities.\n\nThe flow of the Procession\n\nThe flow of the procession changed over the years yet it followed a certain pattern (order of appearance) that can still be observed in the event. The Hermano Mayores mass will start the event and then follow the procession at Plaza Roma (located in front of the Manila Cathedral). The procession began with marching bands from AFP and other groups, followed by the banners of the Cofradia, Intramuros Administration, and the ceriales, then began with the image of San Andres Apostol, the Patron of Manila followed by images of St. Joseph, and other saints followed by images depicting the life of the Blessed Virgin Mary and titles from the Litany of Loreto from different families, parishes, and shrines. The next set would be the images from different families and private individuals, usually replicas of venerated Marian images in the country and other parts of the world.\n\nThe procession continues with a plethora of venerated images from different parishes and shrines all over the country followed by images that were granted Canonical Coronation from the most recent to the earlier ones. The procession concludes with the Canonically Crowned image of Nuestra Señora de la Consolacion y Correa of San Agustin Church – the lone Coronada that is still enshrined in the Walled City – and the Festejada image. The procession ends with a final blessing from the guest prelate followed by a fireworks display.\n\nThe Impact of the Grand Marian Procession\n\nAt the beginning of its conception and planning, the procession appeared to be a cultural-historical orientation of what was Intramuros then, yet the organizers admitted that the spiritual aspect of the procession prevailed and humbled by the faith shown by the participants, the outcome being the progressive intensification of the faith and Marian devotion in the Philippines.\n\nSince that fateful December 1980 procession, the procession honoring the Inmaculada has been held each year and the number of participating images and devotees has grown each year up to this day. Enthusiasm was such that images from famous Marian shrines in the provinces began to come to Manila for the procession, not only to honor the country’s patroness but also to propagate the devotion of their beloved Patrona to the other devotees present in the procession. In this, the celebration followed the model of the Marian Procession of 1955 when some 60 famous and venerated images of the Virgin were united at the Quirino Grandstand.\n\nInterestingly, most of the participating images from different shrines in the country gained more devotional following which helped on the popularity of the shrine’s patroness like in the cases of Nuestra Señora de Dolores de Turumba of Pakil, Laguna; Nuestra Señora de Aranzazu of San Mateo, Rizal; Nuestra Señora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga of Cavite City, Cavite; Mary Help of Christians of Parañaque City, Marawi City; Nuestra Señora de Asuncion of Bulakan, Bulacan; Nuestra Señora de la Merced of Candaba, Pampanga among others. The Grand Procession is also the day the reunion of some of the venerated images of Old Intramuros, at least for this occasion like those of Nuestra Señora de la Consolacion y Correa of San Agustin Chrch of the Augustinian Order (OSA), Nuestra Señora de Lourdes of Old Lourdes Church of the Franciscan Capuchin fathers (now in her National Shrine in Quezon City), Nuestra Señora de la Salud of the Old San Nicolas Church of the Recollect Fathers (now in her own shrine in San Nicolas de Tolentino Parish in Quezon City) and Nuestra Señora del Santisimo Rosario – La Naval de Manila of Old Santo Domingo Chruch of the Dominicans (now in her National Shrine in Quezon City).\n\nThe Grand Marian Procession became a resounding success that it became one of the much-awaited and one the biggest Marian events in the Philippines and it became known as the pioneer of this kind of procession that other parishes and organizations were inspired to have their own and have its own fair share of attendees.\n\nWhen the pandemic drastically altered the whole world in 2020, numerous preventive safety restrictions were imposed like the prohibition of holding public gatherings. The said prohibition forced all scheduled civic, entertainment, and religious events to be canceled. The Cofradia continued to hold the Hermano Mayores Mass at the Manila Cathedral in compliance with the public safety guidelines. Interestingly, a group of Filipino Youth faithful came up with a virtual recreation of the annual procession in the online gaming platform “Roblox” which met much enthusiasm from the faithful for bringing the tradition to a modern platform.\n\nThe procession recommenced in 2022 following the relaxation of restrictions and a modification that allowed only Pontifically Crowned images to participate. This alteration welcomed the inclusion of certain revered images that had not previously joined the procession. These newly honored Pontifical Coronation recipients made their debut during the annual event, which persisted in 2023.\n\nThe legacy and future\n\nAs for the critics of the Grand Marian Procession, quoting Mr. Escudero from a magazine interview: “Can you imagine going there and stopping the procession? When it’s time to celebrate, you cannot argue with the townspeople”\n\nWhat makes the Grand Marian Procession so important and big of an event? The Grand Marian Procession shows us a picture of who we are as Filipino Catholics and the Filipino identity.\n\nWe are known to be the nation truly devoted and in love with the Blessed Virgin Mary and we have a myriad of ways to express our devotion from praying the rosary, wearing her scapular and the Miraculous Medal, praying novenas or the Divine Office, going on a pilgrimage to her shrines, celebrating her festivities either in a simple, solemn, grand are festive manner, (depending on the culture of the place) and others. Here, the faithful witness a celebration of the Virgin in her different attributes and titles that are known nationwide and it is a moving testament that the devotion to the Blessed Mother is still evidently strong in the islands despite the changes of the times and challenges in our Church and the society that we faced at these dark times.\n\nThe Grand Procession showcases the rich culture that we have nurtured and preserved which really shows our identity as Filipinos that despite the challenges that our nation faced, we still have the courage to celebrate and to give thanks to God for all the blessings, the graces and the protection that He bestowed to our Land through His Mother, the nation’s patroness.\n\nReferences:\n\nCofradia de la Inmaculada Conception, Inc. “Grand Marian Procession, 39 years” (Souvenir program), Intramuros, Manila, 2018.\n\nDarang, Josephine, “A Purely Personal Book of Miracles: A Collection of Columns published by Philippine Daily Inquirer“, Sound Publishing Corporation, Makati City., 2006.\n\nGaba, Marc, “Moving images”, Town and Country, 2006, Retrieved from http://andalltheangelsandsaints.blogspot.com/2011/10/85-moving-images.html on November 20, 2019.\n\nTesoro, Salud, “Mary, conceived without sin, Mary, Mother of God”, ML Tesoro Castañeda, Manila, 1988.\n\nInterview:\n\nChua, Clifford – Cofradia de la Inmaculada Concepcion, Inc.\n\nPhotos:\n\nCofradia de la Inmaculada Concepcion, Inc.\n\nDaquiaog, Michael of Buen Viaje PH\n\nIntramuros Administration\n\nMalabanan, James Benedict\n\nNaval, Wilfred Jason of My Religious Journey\n\nPata, Danny\n\nFeliciano, Raymundo\n\nSpecial thanks to Mr. Clifford Chua of the Cofradia de la Inmaculada Concepcion, Inc.\n\n+AM+DG+"
