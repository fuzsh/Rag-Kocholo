        "text": "The Php30 billion Cebu–Cordova Link Expressway (CCLEX), also known as the Cebu–Cordova Bridge and the Third Cebu–Mactan Bridge (colloquially known as the Third Bridge locally), is a toll bridge expressway in Metro Cebu which links Cebu City with the municipality of Cordova, Cebu. The artistically designed CCLEX, with its iconic crosses on top of the twin pylons, has now become part of Cebu’s iconic landmarks.\n\nHere are some interesting trivia regarding this bridge:\n\nAfter the Mactan-Mandaue Bridge and the Marcelo Fernan Bridge, it is the third road link between Cebu and Mactan\n\nAt 8.9-kms. (5.5 mi.) long, it is the longest and tallest bridge in the Philippines, surpassing the San Juanico Bridge, which crosses Leyte and Samar, and the Candaba Viaduct along the North Luzon Expressway in Luzon.\n\nIt the longest cable-stayed bridge in the Philippines surpassing the Marcelo Fernan Bridge which also crosses the Mactan Channel.\n\nIt the first toll road project of Metro Pacific Tollways Development Corp. (MPTDC) outside of Luzon\n\nCordova mayor Adelino Sitoy first proposed the bridge to connect his municipality with Cebu City in mainland Cebu. After numerous studies were conducted, the local government of Cordova and Cebu City entered into a public-private partnership with Metro Pacific Tollways Development Corp. (MPTDC). Then chairman of the Regional Development Council of Region VII Michael Rama also lobbied for the construction of the Cebu-Cordova bridge. Rama later became Mayor of Cebu City when the Cebu–Cordova Bridge project was already awarded to a company.\n\nHere is the historical timeline of the bridge:\n\nIn January 2016, the Metro Pacific Tollways Development Corp.(MPTDC, the toll road arm of Metro Pacific Investments Corp. which is a publicly listed infrastructure company and a member of the Manny V Pangilinan Group of Companies), through a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange, announced that the construction of the bridge that was to commence in 2017. In the same announcement, MPTDC said that they will be responsible for the construction and financing of the bridge and, once it is completed, its operation as well.\n\nOn March 2, 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the Cebu–Cordova Bridge was held.\n\nOn April 15, 2021, eight ecumenical “Iconic Crosses,” placed on the two main pylons of the bridge, were lighted during the 2021 Quincentennial Commemorations in the Philippines to highlight Cebu’s title of being the Cradle of Christianity in the Far East.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, the bridge is 85.38% complete.\n\nOn October 5, 2021, the final concrete pouring in the main bridge deck was held effectively completing the main bridge deck. The entire expressway is expected to be completed in December 2021, with opening slated for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nDesigned by the Spanish firms Carlos Fernandez Casado (CFC) and SENER Ingeniería y Sistemas, the local firm DCCD Engineering Corp and the Danish firm COWI did the engineering works. Built by a joint venture between Spanish firm ACCIONA, and Philippine firms First Balfour and DMCI, the bridge was meant to serve as an alternate route serving the Mactan–Cebu International Airport.\n\nThe 390-m. long (1,280-ft.) cable-stayed main span of the CCLEX is supported by 145-m. (476-ft.) high twin tower pylons whose design was inspired by the historic Magellan’s Cross Pavilion. The main span of the 27–m. (89 ft.) wide bridge has a 51 m. (167 ft.) navigation clearance for maritime traffic which allows ships to traverse the bridge. Viaduct approach bridges and a causeway, as well as toll road facilities (its design inspired from the eight-rayed sun of the Philippine flag) on an artificial island, also form part of the CCLEX. It has two lanes in each direction, with a design speed of 80 kms. per hour allowing it to serve at least 50,000 vehicles daily.\n\nThe planned expressway extension to Lapu-Lapu City will have a direct connection to the Mactan–Cebu International Airport and will add roughly 5 to 8 kms. (3.1 to 5.0 mi.) to the expressway, and is estimated to cost ₱10 billion to ₱15 billion.\n\nTo provide safe and seamless travel between Cebu City and Mactan, which hosts the Mactan–Cebu International Airport, Mactan Export Processing Zone, and some of the country’s premier resorts and hotels, the CCLEX will use an all-electronic toll collection system.

(an hour’s drive away) from downtown Cebu City, the Our Lady of Manaoag Rosary Sanctuary is owned by Ms. Edna Ouano Toral who wanted to propagate the devotion of Our Lady of Manaoag in the Visayas.\n\nEdna, a Cebuana from Mandaue City, once joined a pilgrimage, organized by Chito Makalintal, to Manaoag in Pangasinan for healing as she was seriously ill at the time with complicated ulcers.\n\nIn 1994, she was healed, a miracle she attributed to the intercession of Our Lady of Manaoag. Since then, she has donated 100 icons to churches in the Visayas and Mindanao.\n\nShe also built this hilltop sanctuary of quiet, serenity, contemplation and prayer. A quiet place to reflect, it is open to the public and use of all its facilities is also free. Edna simply wants to spread the devotion of Our Lady of Manaoag and to pray the rosary.\n\nThe road leading to the sanctuary tended to live up to the name of the barangay (“guba,” in Cebuano, means “ruins” or “disrepair”) but, once you reach the sanctuary entrance, you feel the trip was worth it.\n\nVisitors to this sanctuary have to park their vehicles outside and enter on foot, via a concrete bridge over a creek, leading to a footpath lined with cucharita (Althernanthera ficoidea) plants and mani-mani (Arachis pintoi) plants. On the right is a small rose garden while on the left are mango trees.\n\nUp the hill is the prayer room, a simply roofed structure, ventilated at its sides by thin strands of wood woven into sunburst patterns (solihiya), with the image of Our Lady at the end. Inside are benches for devotees and two statues of cherubs holding rosaries.\n\nFurther up the hill is another small structure housing a museum and an outdoor chapel with a statue of Our Lady, a candle stand, a concrete altar and a number of concrete benches lining the hillside.\n\nDown the hill is a river where wild flowers such as camia (white ginger) abound in season.\n\nDuring the last Holy Week, the sanctuary was included in the Highland Pilgrimage Tour launched by the Cebu City Tourism Commission (CCTC).\n\nOur Lady of the Rosary Manaoag Rosary Sanctuary: Cataline Hill, Brgy.

It was named after Alejandra Bacos, the mother-in-law of barangay councilman Eleuterio Gentapa who is the flower gardens’ landscaper. He is also the chairperson of the Committee on Tourism of Brgy. Gaas.\n\nGorgeous and Instagram-worthy, its stunning landscape is home to more than 200 varieties of colorful, locally grown flowers. Unlike the celosia flower farms in Sirao, this botanical garden takes pride in colorful varieties of dahlia.\n\nCheck out “Sirao Garden”\n\nOther flowers planted include roses, hibiscus (gumamela), sage, hygrangeas, morning glory, wax begonias, angel’s trumpets, bougainvillas, etc.\n\nPlanted at the center are dozens of pink-colored flowers called Spider Flower (Cleome Hassleriana) which look like birthday cake candles.\n\nAlso intriguing is nipplefruit, fox head, cow’s udder, or apple of Sodom (Solanum mammosum), a peculiar-looking plant locally known as “Mickey Mouse” plant. Adding to the charm are different shapes of floral arches.\n\nThese could be admired from a steel boardwalk with rainbow-colored footpaths with a picturesque mountain in the background. On average, the garden gets more tan 70 visitors on weekdays and hundreds on weekends.\n\nThe garden also has a restaurant which reopened February 1, 2022 after being damaged during Typhoon Odette. Their bestsellers include soy fried chicken, quarter leg chicken barbecue, special bam-i, baraku shrimp, pork gising-gising and chicken picata.\n\nThis scenic location is perfect for pre-nuptial and pre-debut photo shoots. Upon entering the garden, visitors must first attend an orientation.\n\nSmoking is not allowed in the premises and visitors should only walk along a designated trail. They are also not allowed to pick flowers (they are also not for sale) and step in areas where flowers are planted.\n\nBuwakan ni Alejandra: Transcentral Highway, Sitio Bunga, Brgy.

Book via www.cebupacificair.com.\n\nAside from the famed Santo Niño de Cebu, Cebuanos are also devoted to another image – the felicitous and miraculous image of Nuestra Señora De la Regla (Our Lady of the Rule). The image, carved from the trunk of dark Philippine hardwood, is patterned after the original located in Chipiona, Spain. The image is currently venerated at her own altar at the National Shrine of Nuestra Señora de la Regla.\n\nSt. Augustine, the bishop of Hippo, started the devotion to Our Lady of the Rule in Northern Africa. Using his own hands, he has carved an image of Our Lady which was one of the relics that has survived the destruction of the city of Hippo. Upon St. Augustine’s death, the monks took the image with them when they fled to Spain.\n\nIn Spain, the image survived the destruction and pillage of the Moors. Miracles were attributed to it and, because of this, the devotion to Our Lady rapidly spread. In 1330, the Virgin appeared to an Augustinian monk and instructed him to go to the city of Cadiz. Here, he was to look for a cave where the image had been hidden away. He dug it up and found a hidden underground altar.\n\nThe richly vested (given by the devotees as a sign of gratitude to the answered prayers through her intercession) Brown Madonna holds the Infant Jesus in front of her, as if presenting the child to the people and telling them to worship his Son, the God became Man. For several centuries, the Virgen de la Regla was venerated under several names: Virgen Libica, Virgen del Sagrario, Estrella de los Mares and La Virgen Morena, or Morenita.\n\nIn the 18th century, when the Augustinian Order was given control over the parish of Opon (now Lapu-Lapu City), the devotion was transported to the Philippines. In 1735, the people first saw a picture of the Virgen de la Regla when the first parish priest, Francisco Avalle, an Augustinian monk, showed it to them. Fr. Avalle, having lived for 10 years in the Monastery of Nuestra Señora de la Regla in Chipiona, Andalucia, Spain, was a devotee.\n\nUpon hearing the story of the Virgin of Chipiona, the Oponganons chose Our Lady of the Rule as their patroness. A big picture, encased in a wooden frame, was made and placed on the altar. Miracles began to happen and the devotion flourished. Later a hardwood statue replaced the picture for veneration. Between 1735 and 1744, a Baroque-style church, made with Mactan coral stone and measuring 60 m. long, 23 m. wide and 14 m. high, was built.\n\nDuring World War II, the church was slightly damaged but, in 1960, it was torn down during the term of Dutch Fr. Cornelio Van De Loo, of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, who was assigned as parish priest, bypassing 200 years of history, and replaced with a new concrete church. The priests also sold off the church’s coral blocks and, later, its altar to the University of San Carlos Museum. Thankfully, the spacious and solid convent, built in 1855 by Fr. Simon Aguirre, is still intact.\n\nOn Nov. 27, 1954, as a highlight to the Archdiocesan Marian Congress that year, Archbishop (later Cardinal) Julio Rosales crowned the Virgin, the first image from the Visayas to receive such a recognition.\n\nNational Shrine of Nuestra Señora de la Regla: B.M.

Quezon was erected when he was still serving as President of the Philippines. Saint Anne is the patroness of the church.\n\nThis church, as well as the convent, was first built, in 1848, of nipa and bamboo by Fr. Diego Alvarez, O.S.A.. The construction of the present concrete church, from 1609 to 1611, was supervised by Fr. Hernando Guerrero, O.S.A..\n\nDuring the November 30, 1645 Luzon earthquake, both were considerably damaged and later repaired. Both survived the June 3, 1863 earthquake but the June 20, 1880 earthquake cracked the bell tower sending its bell crashing on the church roof, destroying the choir loft and part of its framework.\n\nIn 1881, the reconstruction of both buildings was started by Fr. Patricio Martin, O.S.A. and, in 1885, continued by his successor Fr. Guillermo Diaz, O.S.A.. In 1898, the buildings were occupied by American soldiers and used as their headquarters. Both were restored by Filipino secular Frs. Vicente Estacio (1905 to 1916, he oversaw the installation of the church’s sawali ceiling) and Gerardo Maximo (1938 to 1951). The fence was left unfinished.\n\nIn August 1943, during the Second World War, hundreds of male inhabitants were incarcerated by the Imperial Japanese, for a number of days, inside the church. In 1987, in preparation for the parish’s 400th anniversary, more improvements in the edifice were undertaken by Msgr. Augurio Juta and Msgr. Emmanuel Sunga.\n\nOn July 25, 1987, a historical marker was installed on the church facade by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. The church was also declared and recognized by the government as a cultural property based on the official list provided by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, National Historical Commission of the Philippines and the National Museum of the Philippines.\n\nAUTHOR’S NOTES:\n\nThe church’s barn-style Baroque facade has flat pilasters, a first level with a centrally located arched main entrance flanked by statued niches; a second level with a centrally located rose window flanked by semicircular arched windows and a triangular pediment with a centrally located statued niche.\n\nThe four-storey bell tower, on the church’s right, has a two-storey square base (with a bas-relief of St. Anne), an octagonal third storey (with semicircular arched windows) and a round upper storey topped by a dome.\n\nThe church houses the Museo de Sta. Ana which contains religious relics and a repository of artifacts detailing the rich religious culture and history of Taguig since 1857.\n\nArchdiocesan Shrine of St. Anne: 1 Liwayway St., Brgy. Sta.

When we entered the churchyard from the main road, we only saw the side entrance near the altar. To see the beautiful façade, we had to first enter the church then go out the front door.\n\nThis town’s original church (at the time was under the patronage of Saint Andrew the Apostle), designed by Fr. Juan de Salazar, S.J., was first constructed in stone by Jesuit Fr. Gaspar Marco in 1707 and completed in 1716, during the time of Joaquin Sanchez, S.J, while he was still the parish priest.\n\nCheck out “Church of San Felipe Neri” and “Immaculate Concepton Cathedral“\n\nIn 1727, a painting of Our Lady of Light was brought in from the Kingdom of Sicily and was chosen as the new patroness of the church and, by 1760, the church was officially declared a separate parish.\n\nOn February 23, 1853, the church building was damaged by an earthquake, both its roof and one wall collapsed while the walls of the parish rectory or convent sustained cracks. By 1884 the parish had been named Our Lady of Light (Virgen ng Caliuanagan or Madre Santissima del Lumen in Tagalog and Spanish languages), as attested in the August 5, 1884 letter by Don Mariano de San Juan (the pastor of Cainta) to Fray Pedro Payo, O.P., the Archbishop of Manila.\n\nIn March 1899, during the Filipino-American War, the church and parish rectory, including the venerated Marian image within, were burned down. The stones from the church walls were later used to build roads. The monogram of the Holy Name of Jesus “IHS” (Latin: Iesus Hominum Salvator), attached at the top portion of the church’s façade, was the only mark left of its Jesuit beginning.\n\nFor 67 years, the church was left in ruins, without any significant restoration. On June 10, 1966, after Archbishop of Manila Rufino Cardinal Santos gave permission for the church’s reconstruction on February 15, 1965, the reconstruction of the church began. The facade was kept untouched. When one of the beams collapsed, the reconstruction was halted and further study was conducted to determine if it could withstand earthquakes.\n\nOn June 15, 1967, reconstruction resumed and it was completed and blessed by Rufino Cardinal Santos on February 25, 1968. In 1975, the administration of the parish was turned over, by the CICM Missionaries, to the Archdiocese of Manila, with Monsignor Alfredo Santa Ana, HP, as its first diocesan parish priest. Until 1998, the church was the sole parish in the entire municipality of Cainta.\n\nIn 2007, the church was declared as a historical site by the National Historical Institute (NHI), now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP), for its significant role during the Philippines-American War.\n\nOn December 1, 2007, the newly renovated altar and the new historical marker of the church were blessed. On December 1, 2012, an episcopal coronation, coinciding with the parish fiesta, was performed by the local bishop with the assistance of Ms. Henrietta De Villa, former ambassador to the Vatican.\n\nAfter the burning (during the Filipino-American war in 1899) of the original enshrined icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary (a painting of Our Lady of Light brought to Cainta in 1727 from Ferrara, Italy by Fr. Bartolommeo Cavanti, SJ.), the venerated Marian image was recreated by Philippine National Artist Fernando Amorsolo.\n\nOn December 6, 2017, the image was granted the papal bull of canonical coronation by Pope Francis and it was crowned on December 1, 2018, the first Marian image in Philippine history to be pontifically crowned as an artistic painting. On the same day as its canonical coronation, the parish church was consecrated and elevated into a Diocesan Shrine.\n\nThe original church, including the sacristy and rectory, measured approximately 44 m. (144 ft. long), 15 m. (48 ft.) wide and 11 m. (36 ft.) high. Made of stone and limestone (calycanto), its roof was tiled and had a dome (media naranja), transepts (crucero) and five buttresses (contrafuertos).\n\nThe nave’s spacious presbytery had windows and skylight (claraboya) while the belfry had four bells, two of which were small bells rung by rotation (esquitas). The baptistery, with an arched ceiling, was situated at the bottom of the belfry. Flooring was made of wood. It also had a choir loft, communion rail, pulpit and three doors. Five retablos are found inside the church, with the original picture of the Our Lady of Light enshrined at the central niche.\n\nThe sacristy measured approximately 8.2 m. (27 ft.) long, 7.3 m. (24 ft.) wide and 5.5 m. (18 ft.) high. The parish rectory, with a kitchen, two brick chimneys, four rooms and offices, measured approximately 37 m. (120 ft.) long, 15 m. (48 ft.) wide and 7.3 m. (24 ft.) high.\n\nThe larger reconstructed church measures 68 m. (223 ft.) long, with a transept 42 m. (138 ft.) wide, and with walls 10.5 m. (34.4 ft.) high. It has a semicircular arch main entrance and four lateral doors. There are separate chapels for the Blessed Sacrament and for Our Lady of Light and Saint Andrew, both enshrined at the sides of the sanctuary.\n\nIt’s simple, two-level Early Renaissance façade, with superpositioned paired columns, has semicircular arch statued niches, a square window at the choir loft and a circular window at the tympanum of the triangular pediment. The attached four-storey bell tower, on the church’s right, has semicircular arched windows.\n\nChurch of Our Lady of Light: Andres Bonifacio Ave. (near Cainta Junction), Brgy.

This church was first built by Augustinian missionaries in 1575. Initially consecrated to the Visitation of Our Lady (consecrated on July 2, 1573), on April 25, 1587, the parish was changed to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, the patroness of the Augustinian priests during that time.\n\nThe present structure, started before 1639, was said to have been finished during the brief British occupation of Manila from 1722 to 1747 (when it was converted into horses’ stables and served as the British military headquarters) and its belfry used as a watchtower against the Spanish defenders. In 1764, it underwent repairs.\n\nThe stone convent was built by Fr. Felix Trillo. In 1879, the church was restored by Fr. Simon Barroso who also replaced the roof with galvanized iron. From 1910 to 1979, the parish was administered by the CICM Fathers, after which the Filipino clergy took over the pastoral leadership of the parish.\n\nIn 2000, the Immaculate Conception Cathedral was declared one of the Jubilee churches in the Archdiocese of Manila (the parish was a part of this archdiocese until August 21, 2003 when the district was elevated as a separate and independent diocese on October 2001, with the elevation of the parish into the status of a cathedral).\n\nOn December 7, 2008, the Solemn Canonical Coronation of its patron as Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception of Pasig was led by Edward Joseph Adams (the Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines), the Bishop of Pasig, and the entire faithful in the diocese.\n\nIn February 2021, as part of the Celebration of the 500th year anniversary of the arrival of Christianity in the Philippines, the cathedral was named as a Jubilee Church in the Diocese of Pasig along with the Diocesan Shrine of St. Martha and Parish of St. Roch in Pateros and the Archdiocesan Shrine of St. Anne in Taguig City.\n\nOn March 25, 2022, after a 7 year-long restoration and renovation of the cathedral (including the addition of ceiling paintings), the cathedral was inaugurated and blest by Bishop Mylo Hubert Vergara.\n\nIts plain Neo-Classical and Colonial Baroque façade has triglyphs that separate the first level from the second and third level; semicircular arched doors and windows, and small rose windows and the Augustinian symbol of the stylized heart on the second level.\n\nIts triangular pediment, with its centrally located statued niche and supported by slender Doric columns, is topped by a Renaissance-influenced min-balustrade lacing the raking cornice. The massive five-level bell tower is located on the church’s left.\n\nImmaculate Conception Cathedral: Justice Hubson St., Plaza Rizal, Brgy. Malinao, Pasig City 1600, Metro Manila.
