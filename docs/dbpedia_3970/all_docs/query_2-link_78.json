        "text": "The history and culture of the Philippines are reflected in its architectural heritage, in the dwellings of its various peoples, in mosques and churches, and in buildings that have risen in response to the demands of progress and the aspirations of a people. Houses and monuments from Batanes to Tawi-Tawi do not only represent different cultures and periods in Philippine history; they also constitute the Filipino's creative response to the problems posed by the geography and climate of the archipelago. The 7,100 islands of the Philippines appear to be a mountain range that is half submerged. More than half of the land is mountainous and hilly. With their headwaters in the mountains, rivers flow down to the plains and out to the sea. For its relatively small area of 300,000 square kilometers, the country has an extensive coastline of 17,500 kilometers. On this fragmented territory and rugged terrain, on mountain, plain, riverbank, and seacoast, the people have made their home. With its southernmost islands about four degrees from the equator, and its northern and central islands in the path of typhoons, the Philippines is subject to the worst of tropical heat, humidity, and rain. A long dry season can bring drought, rains can cause floods, and high winds can ruin houses. Several times a year the land is rocked by earthquakes. As the climate dictates the need for shelter, the land provides the materials for it: wood from the forests, bamboo from groves, leaves from the fields, stone from rivers and quarries, and clay from the earth itself. Setting, climate, and available materials are among the factors that give shelter its form and character. The Ethnic Tradition The earliest shelters of human beings were probably not built by them. They simply found these shelters or found themselves in them. It was nature which fashioned hollows on cliffs and mountainsides that offered protection from heat, rain, and wind. In Angono, Rizal, evidence of ancient cave dwellers exists in carved figures on cave walls, the earliest known Philippine mural. The Tabon Cave in Palawan yielded the earliest-known remains of human beings in the Philippines. Meanwhile, the food gatherers, the fishers, or the hunters, who moved from one place to another in their search for food and game, needed a portable shelter. Thus they fashioned the lean-to from a frame made of tree branches and twigs, using leaves and fronds for sidings. A screen resting on the ground and held up at an angle by one or several poles, the lean-to is both roof and wall, protecting dwellers from rain and the heat of the sun.\n\nThe Japan Consortium for International Cooperation in Cultural Heritage conducts studies of countries in need of assistance in conservation efforts with the objective of promoting Japanâ€™s engagement in international campaigns for the protection of worldwide cultural heritage. The studies focus on the state of cultural heritage protection in the country in need of assistance and on international cooperation initiatives of foreign countries in the field of cultural heritage. There are two types of studies: emergency studies aiming to rescue cultural heritage damaged by a natural disaster or other such situation by assessing damage, and regular studies that are conducted to collect information for future assistance for cultural heritage protection at the request of foreign countries. The countries for which the Consortium has conducted such studies in the past include Laos and Mongolia in fiscal 2007, Australia, Yemen, Germany, Norway and Sweden in fiscal 2008, Bhutan in fiscal 2009, Armenia and Micronesia in fiscal 2010, and Bahrain and Myanmar in fiscal 2011. This particular study was launched in fiscal 2012 in response to a request for assistance from the Philippines, and was conducted to assess the status of cultural heritage protection and international cooperation in the Philippines with a view to exploring future potential for cooperation by Japan"
