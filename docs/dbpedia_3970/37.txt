1572

Called as the “Jardin de Filipinas” in Fr. Manuel Buzeta and Fr Felipe Bravo’s Diccionario geografico, estadistico, historico de la Islas Filipinas, Bulacan is indeed one of the most fertile agricultural centers in the country. Surrounded by the provinces of Nueva Ecija (North), Pampanga (West), Quezon and Rizal (East) and Metro Manila (South), Catholicism began in this part of the country in the early years of Christianization of the Philippines. Once comprising of several encomiendas formed with the province of Pampanga, Bulacan became part of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Manila when the later was erected through the papal bull Illus fulti præsidio on February 6, 1579 by Pope Gregory XIII. The first Augustinian missionaries landed in Meyto in Calumpit town in 1572 and made it a visita of Tondo. It was later created as a house of the order named Parroquia de San Nicolas de Tolentino in 1575 (to be later renamed San Juan Bautista in 1576). On the other hand, Franciscan missionaries founded Meycauayan town and the Parroquia de San Francisco de Asis in 1578.

1575-1898

After establishing Calumpit, the Augustinian missionaries founded Bulacan (1578), the future province’s namesake, under the advocacy of “La Asuncion del Nuestra Señora”. This was followed by: Malolos (1580) under the advocacy of “La Purisima Concepcion”; Hagonoy (1581) under the advocacy of Sta. Ana, Madre de Maria; Bigaa [now Balagtas] (1596) under the advocacy of San Lorenzo de Roma; Quingua [now Plaridel] (1602) and Paombong (1639) under the advocacy of Santiago Apostol; Angat (1693) under the advocacy of Sta. Monica; Baliuag (1732) under the advocacy of San Agustin; San Miguel [then part of Candaba] (1725) under the advocacy of San Miguel Arcangel; San Rafael (1750) under the advocacy of San Rafael Arcangel; Norzagaray (1860) under the advocacy of San Andres Apostol, Bustos (1867) under the advocacy of the Sto. Niño and San Ildefonso (1885).

After establishing Meycauayan in 1578, the towns around it were gradually formed: Bocaue (1606) under the advocacy of San Martin de Tours, Polo [now Valenzuela City] (1623) under the advocacy of San Diego de Alcala, San Jose del Monte (1751) under the advocacy of San Jose Obrero, Obando (1754) under the advocacy of San Pascual Bailon with Sta. Clara and the Nuestra Señora de la Inmaculada Concepcion de Salambao as secondary patronesses, Santa Maria (1792) with La Purisima Concepcion as patroness, Marilao (1796) under the advocacy of San Miguel Arcangel and Pandi (1874) under the advocacy of La Inmaculada Concepcion.

The Archdiocese of Manila’s Bulacan territories were divided between the areas between the Augustinians (Bulacan Norte) and the Franciscans (Bulacan Sur). Later on, there would be other subdivisions until the entire territory of Bulacan was considered for separation as an individual diocese.

1575-1898

Bulacan became home for some of today’s known holy men and women as its proximity to Manila provided a strategic location for ministerial and educational work. St. Andrew Kim Taegon (1821-1846), the first Korean priest, lived in Lolomboy, Bocaue, Bulacan when he was educated in the Pontifical & Royal University of Sto. Tomas, Manila. The Franciscan martyr St. Pedro Bautista (1542-1597), who became Minister Provincial of Meycauayan stayed there before leaving for Japan in 1588. Blessed Francisco de Santa Maria, also a Franciscan, administered the towns of Meycauayan and Polo before heading to Japan where he met his martyrdom. Fr. Francisco Gascueña, a Franciscan who escaped Christian persecution in China, administered Meycauayan until his death in 1831. The Augustinian Fray Joaquin Martinez de Zuñiga, though not a canonized saint, was a famous historian who wrote two volumes of Estadisimo de las Islas Filipinas o mis viajes por este pais, was assigned in Hagonoy, Bulacan. Fray Manuel Blanco, OSA, a renowned Augustinian botanist who published the monumental Flora de Filipinas which he began to work during his stay in Angat.

Besides the foreign missionaries, religious heroes could also be found among Filipino Bulakeños. Fr. Mariano Pilapil from Bulacan is known for being a censer for the Pasyong Genesis, the originating text of today’s Pasyong Mahal read during Holy Week. Fr. Mariano Sevilla, also from Bulacan, became curate of Hagonoy, a delegate to the 1898 Malolos Congress, and the writer of the Flores de Maria o Mariquit na Bulaclac, the originating text of the Flores de Maria celebration. Calumpit, Bulacan became the birthplace of Servants of God Dionisia de Sta. Maria Talampaz (1691- 1731) and Mitas Cecilia Rosa de Jesus Talampaz (1693 – 1731), co-foundresses of the Beaterio de San Sebastian in Quiapo, now the Augustinian Recollects sisters.

1896-1898

During the Philippine Revolution against the Spaniards from 1896 to 1898, Bulacan would serve as national capital of the first Philippine President, Emilio F. Aguinaldo. Aguinaldo took quarters at the Malolos church convent, the Malolos Congress operated at Barasoain church and other offices in the houses of the elite in the town. Here Malolos became a cradle of Philippine democracy as the first Philippine Constitution became the fruit of the efforts of the Aguinaldo administration in their stay in Malolos. However, as the Americans advanced their invasion from Manila, Aguinaldo and his forces moved north. To our dismay, the burning of churches, especially the Malolos church, was one of the saddest things the revolutionaries did as the Americans arrived in a pillaged and burned Malolos.

1962-1977

For the new diocese, Most Reverend Manuel Platon del Rosario, then Bishop of Calbayog, Samar was appointed as the first Bishop of Malolos. He was jubilantly welcomed by the newly-gathered Bulakeño faithful that now formed the diocese. Governor Tomas Martin and the provincial cabinet of Bulacan were present. Del Rosario’s canonical installation was presided over by then Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines, Salvatore Siino. During his tenure, he established the Immaculate Conception Seminary (Minor) in 1962 at the Bulacan church convent, and was later transferred to the current seminary complex in Tabe, Guiguinto, Bulacan. Religious and monastic orders were soon invited to form communities here as Bulacan became a known producer of priestly and religious vocations. During this time, the diocese had eight (8) vicariates: Valenzuela, Malolos, Hagonoy, Sta. Maria, Baliuag, Meycauayan, Plaridel and San Miguel. In 1966, Del Rosario received Bishop Leopoldo A. Arcaira (+1994) as his auxiliary bishop. In 1971, Bishop Ricardo J. Vidal (who became Archbishop of Lipa, then Cebu) was appointed as coadjutor bishop due to Del Rosario’s ill health.

1977-1987

As Bishop Vidal was assigned as the new Archbishop of Lipa, Malolos was given a young and energetic bishop from Cavite, Most Rev. Cirilo Reyes Almario, Jr., D.D. who was appointed Apostolic Administrator sede plena of Malolos and then became the second Bishop of Malolos. Several developments would in fact occur during Almario’s term. One of his most known is the establishment of the diocese’s own major seminary, the Immaculate Conception Major Seminary. The Institute of Formation was established in 1983 with Msgr. Fernando G. Gutierrez as first Rector. The college department followed the next year and its theologate in 1987. ICMAS, as it is called, is Almario’s greatest legacy. Today the seminary houses future priests not only from Malolos but from neighboring dioceses as well.

1999-2000

On December 1999, at the inauguration of the Great Jubilee Year 2000, the Diocese of Malolos witnessed the elevation of its cathedral as minor basilica granted by Pope St. John Paul II together with the episcopal coronation of its patroness, La Virgen Inmaculada Concepcion de Malolos.

SHRINES

Together with the basilica at present are eight (8) more shrines in the Diocese: the Parish of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, Valenzuela City (1976); the National Shrine and Parish of St. Anne, Hagonoy, (1991); the National Shrine of the Divine Mercy, Marilao; the Diocesan Shrine and Parish of Sagrado Corazon de Jesus, San Rafael (2000); the Diocesan Shrine of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist & Grace, Sta.

BULACAN’S RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS

All year round, the faithful of Bulacan manifest their religious spirituality and popular religiosity with its various festivals. Each locality offers a remarkable expression of faith that gives color to the way Bulakeño Catholics present their devotions.

HOLY WEEK

On this three-day festival, dedicated to the three patrons of Obando (San Pascual Baylon, Sta. Clara de Asis and the Nuestra Señora de la Inmaculada Concepcion de Salambao), the faithful dance their way in a procession for the prayers of couples and families be heard and answered.

FLUVIAL PROCESSIONS

As Bulacan is surrounded by delta riverbeds, the water becomes ground for religious activities as well.

On July, the famous Pagoda ng Bocaue processes the Mahal na Poon ng Krus sa Wawa on its annual river route and in Hagonoy town, Sta. Ana and San Joaquin meet in an encuentro in the river and together, Mary’s parents go towards the shrine with singing and dancing.

FOURTH BISHOP

In 2004, Most Rev. Jose Francisco Oliveros, D.D., then Bishop of Boac, replaced Bishop Tirona, who would later be assigned as Prelate of Infanta and then Archbishop of Caceres. Bishop Oliveros became Apostolic Administrator sede vacante before assuming office. It was in his term that the Diocese of Malolos prepared for its Golden Jubilee. During his time, the Diocese was divided into four ecclesiastical districts (West, East, South and North).

2007-2012

The Diocese had five preparatory years dedicated to the priests, religious, laity and the youth of the Diocese. During the journey of the Diocese, the Jubilee Cross and the replica image of La Virgen Inmaculada Concepcion de Malolos joined the community in its journey towards the different religious, social, cultural and beneficial gatherings held during the five-year preparation, which was a remarkable opportunity for people to renew their faith in the Lord.
