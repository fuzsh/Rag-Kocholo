Goober and the Ghost Chasers is an American animated series made by Hanna-Barbera, which originally aired on ABC from September 8, 1973 to December 22, 1973. The series was very similar in concept with the studio's more famous production Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, which also focuses on a group of teens and their dog solving mysteries.

Get spooked with ghost hunters Gilly, Ted and Tina as they travel the globe with their reluctant pooch Goober on a search for paranormal action in this fondly remembered animated treat. Whether they’re uncovering urban legends, unmasking bumbling crooks or solving wacky mysteries, it’s spooktacular fun for all!
