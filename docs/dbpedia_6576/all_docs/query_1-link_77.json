        "text": "This movie will make you use your imagination! It’s more of a guessing game than evidence presented as the kids, best friends, run their own amateur ghost hunters organization. They would fit right in with the “Scooby Doo” series.\n\nThe premise is that a ghost helps the kids find a hidden treasure (a bracelet) to help a brother and sister’s mother save her shop from back taxes. The supernatural elements are mentioned more than seen. We see the results of wind blowing and so forth and the kids’ imagination goes wild.\n\nWe are pleased to award this film our Dove Seal for all ages."
