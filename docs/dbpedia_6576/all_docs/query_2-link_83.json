        "text": "Rafe Spall will be chasing spooks in his new TV role as Harry Price: Ghost Hunter.\n\nThe Life Of Pi actor has signed up to star in the feature length drama for ITV about a fraudster medium and ghost hunter who is given a chance to turn his life around by taking on a new case.\n\nThe period film, set in the 1920s, is based on the novel The Ghost Hunters by Neil Spring and will be made by Bentley Productions.\n\nFact and fiction will be combined to tell the story of Price, a famous British ghost hunter and sceptic.\n\nSpall said: “I’m delighted to be portraying Harry Price for ITV. It’s a fantastic piece of history that has mass appeal and I can’t wait to start filming.”\n\nHe will be joined by Downton Abbey’s Cara Theobold as maid Sarah Grey, who helps Harry with his investigation into the supposed haunting of the home of a local MP.\n\nSpring told MediaGuardian that he had written The Ghost Hunters with a television series in mind and that Spall was ideal to play Price.\n\nThe writer – who has a new novel out soon called The Watchers, about UFO sightings during the cold war – said: “It is a tremendous honour to know that one of the most talented actors of his generation is about to play such a complex and flawed character as Harry Price.\n\n“The man I envisaged in The Ghost Hunters is about to live again. I can only hope audiences are as enthralled by him as I was.”"
