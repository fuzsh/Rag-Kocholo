        "text": "IT’S just before midnight on the edge of Death Valley and I’m standing in a dark room in the Amargosa Opera House and Hotel with five people who are certain that we’re talking to ghosts.\n\n“There’s something going on,” said one ghost hunter who is holding a device meant to find electromagnetic fields. Sure enough, it’s going wild. And while I don’t believe in ghosts, I have goose bumps.\n\nDeath Valley National Park doesn’t need a lot of help being spooky. One of the lowest, most arid places on earth, the valley has more ghost towns than actual ones: dried-up spots like Leadfield, Chloride City and Skidoo, whose last residents skedaddled as soon as the gold, or rumor thereof, was gone.\n\nEven the places that survive have foreboding names like Furnace Creek or haunted reputations like Death Valley Junction, just outside the park’s eastern gate, where paranormal fans convene to hunt the spirits of miners, mistresses and other metaphysical outliers. Then there are anomalies like the park’s Racetrack Playa, where rocks seemingly slide across sand under their own power.\n\nDeath Valley’s mysteries and its extremes have always intrigued me. So earlier this year, I made the pilgrimage to this three million acre expanse on the California-Nevada border, following the footsteps of unknown numbers of old-time prospectors and oddballs.\n\nPart of the draw for me (and, no doubt, for the countless others who visit each year) is the valley’s remoteness and the peculiar air of excitement that being in such a lonely locale can inspire. Forget about being lost at sea; I’ve rarely felt more isolated than I did in Death Valley, whose eastern tip is some 75 miles (as the buzzard flies) west of Las Vegas. Yet, despite its name and foreboding reputation, what I found was a place teeming with pockets of life, from tough tortoises to equally hardy tourists.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
