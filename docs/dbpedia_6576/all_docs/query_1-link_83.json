        "text": "Ghosts are a mysterious and sometimes pesky phenomenon, making us look both ways when leaving a room, shutting doors, showing up in the back of photographs, and creating an endless amount of spooky sounds. With countless ghost hunter shows on TV and a thriving ghost tourism industry it's hard not to believe just a little bit that they could exist. But even if you're a cynical naysayer about anything unknown, like if vampires or ghosts are real, we've still got Hollywood to help entertain us and show us what it might be like if ghost really were a part of our lives.\n\nThankfully, in this list of the best ghost movies ever made, not all of these apparitions are out for vengeance, some are nice like Casper, maybe even worth falling in love with, like Patrick Swayze in the infamous pottery wheel scene from Ghost. We also included plenty of the kind of ghosts you wish you'd rather not have met like the kind in The Grudge or the classic horror film, Poltergeist. Any way you spin it, our movie marathon is great for your next Halloween movie night, or any night you're feeling a little extra brave. You'll soon discover that specters are not to be messed with, and don't even think about trying to renovate their former home! Otherwise your home will be yet another listing on the Most Haunted Places."
