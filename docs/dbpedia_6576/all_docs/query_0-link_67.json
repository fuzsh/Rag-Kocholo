Lavished with many photos from the films from the author's personal collection, this is one book you'll need to have in your collection, tough guy!\n\nHollywood's Made-to-Order Punks Part 2\n\nby Richard Roat (Author)\n\nBack in 1964, when I was 12 years old I saw my first Dead End Kid film, the title of the film was Crime School. After watching it I learn all about the Dead End Kids and their lives on and off the big screen. Over the past 40 years, I became friends with many of the actors who portrayed the kids, and the actors who worked with them in their films. I have had the great pleasure of becoming friends with Billy Halop, Huntz Hall, Gabe Dell, Bernard Punsly, Billy Benedict, Bennie Bartlett, Stanley Clements, Pepe Hern, Joe Turkel, Eugene Francis, Johnny Duncan, David Gorcey, Jimmy McCallon, Frankie Thomas, Eddie Le Roy, Bill Lawrence and Keye Luke. My greatest joy is my friendship over the past 30 years with Mendie Koenig (Mendie was a dear Dead End Kids friend-I think of him often), Dick Chandlee, Johnny Duncan and Eugene Francis. I have collected thousands of 8x10 stills, countless posters, lobby cards and anything I can find that has to do with the Dead End Kids. I hope you the reader will enjoy your travels as you thumb thru the pages and look at the pictures that I have collected. ­ Richard Roat\n\nHollywood's Made to Order Punks Part 3\n\nby Richard Roat (Author), Johnny Duncan (Foreword)\n\n\"The first book in this series, Hollywood's Made To Order Punks, gave you insight into The Dead End Kids/Little Tough Guys/East Side Kids and The Bowery Boys.

Richard Roat aspires to enlighten all his readers with the artistry of this amazing group of entertainers as one turns the pages of this book. As Bim would say (while clicking his fingers together) 'All Gamblers Die Broke.'\" - Jennifer Roat Richard Roat lives in Tinley Park, IL just outside of Chicago with his wife Mary and daughter Jenny. Richard retired in 2012 after many years working at a cemetery as a groundsman/gravedigger.ls as you thumb thru the pages and look at the pictures that I have collected. ­ Richard Roat\n\nFrom Broadway to the Bowery\n\nby Leonard Getz (Author), Leo Gorcey Jr. (Foreword)\n\nIn 1935 Sidney Kingsley's play about streetwise urban kids, Dead End, opened on Broadway featuring 14 adolescent actors. For two years on Broadway and then on tour, Kingsley's play delivered its social commentary contrasting affluent neighborhoods and tenement slums on New York City's East River. The film industry picked up the story and in 1937 released Dead End which spawned 23 more years of films and serials featuring the Dead End Kids and their offshoots, Little Tough Guys, East Side Kids and the Bowery Boys.\n\nThis chronicle follows the street kids through the many assorted incarnations, shifting casts and studios. First the reader is introduced to how the original play and film came about. A cast list and analysis of each production follows. For the major players, the author provides a biography and filmography, and several of these entries include a tribute from a friend or family member. Brief biographical profiles are given for other actors. Sketches of the \"Dead End\" revivals of 1978 and 2005 follow.\n\nBeyond Dead End:\n\nThe Solo Careers of the Dead End Kids\n\nby Joseph Fusco\n\nNo one exemplifies the angst of the Depression era street kid more than The Dead End Kids. They were the stars of Sidney Kingsley's 1935 play, Dead End and reprised their roles in Samuel Goldwyn's 1937 Hollywood film version. The movie defined the theme of slum dramas for the juvenile rebellion films of subsequent decades. The Dead End Kids were Billy Halop, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan, Leo Gorcey, Gabriel Dell and Bernard Punsly.\n\nFilms Of The Bowery Boys\n\nHardcover - Paperback\n\nby David Hayes & Brent Walker\n\nDetailed information on all the films.
