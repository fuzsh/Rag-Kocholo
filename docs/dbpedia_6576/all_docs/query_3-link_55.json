        "text": "Which colors will predominate?\n\n“Brown — the more ‘off,’ the better. It’s subtle and confrontational: Not a lot of colors have that versatility.” — Thebe Magugu, 30, fashion designer\n\n“After a hugely colorful period, I think we’re going back to a place of minimalism in our clothes: black, a faded brown. Subtlety.” — Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, 37, actor\n\n“Whiskey and cognac — a brown with a lot of caramel.” — Jenna Lyons, 55, designer\n\n“There’s always a resistance to meatball brown, so I believe that is going to be the next color to sweep runways.” — John Waters, 77, film director\n\n“Purple. It’s finally getting its due.” — Freddie Ross Jr., a.k.a. Big Freedia, 45, musician\n\n“Deep violet.” — Sharon Van Etten, 42, singer-songwriter\n\n“Colors that reflect opulence. Like bluish purple. It’ll be the year of treating yourself.” — Kwame Onwuachi, 34, chef\n\n“Neutrals will step up their game and pack some actual punch. I won’t be surprised if a diarrhea tone becomes Pantone’s color of the year. On the flip side, bright colors are still seeking vengeance for the millennial tyranny of pastel; we’ll finally get treated to a color like Tyrian purple.” — Misha Kahn, 34, designer and sculptor\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
