        "text": "With the entertainment business in flux because of the writers and actors strikes, the new offerings for the fall television season — which remains a celebratory occasion for TV fans, even in the streaming age — feel dimmer in their star power in aggregate, and more in flux than usual. There are certainly plenty of high-profile new series heading our way, such as Apple TV+’s “Lessons in Chemistry,” led by Brie Larson; Kelsey Grammer’s “Frasier” revival on Paramount+; and Shawn Levy’s Netflix passion project “All the Light We Cannot See,” and those dates have remained fixed. We also have a month announced (November!) if not the exact dates yet, for Chuck Lorre’s Max comedy “Bookie,” Apple’s new Legendary series “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters,” and Baz Luhrmann’s “Faraway Downs,” in case you always wanted “Australia,” his Hugh Jackman-Nicole Kidman movie, to be a six-episode series instead.\n\nAnd yet! If the strikes aren’t settled in the next month or so, will those premiere dates stick? FX already delayed its promising Brit Marling-Zal Batmanglij series “A Murder at the End of the World,” which was supposed to premiere in late August, to November, and Max delayed the second season of “Rap Sh!t” (also to November) so the talent on the show could do press. Noteworthy projects like HBO’s Jodie Foster-led season of “True Detective” and FX’s “Feud: Capote’s Women” from Ryan Murphy have simply been pushed into 2024.\n\nSelfishly, we’re sad; practically, we get it. And here’s hoping that the dates in our fall TV preview list below will remain in place, and that everyone can go back to work — happily — soon."
