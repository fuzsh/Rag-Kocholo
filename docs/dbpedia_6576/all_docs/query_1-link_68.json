The owner is so frightened that she no longer sleeps there at night.\n\nUnlike most haunted houses, this home has been studied for almost 10 years by a ghost-hunting team who has security cameras monitoring the home 24–7. Despite this, the cause of stuff moving around, swinging chandeliers, flickering ceiling lights, and even mysterious bright lights in the hallway remain unexplained.\n\nReleased in April of this year, it’s unique because the film gives debunking an honest shake and at least nominally looks for explanations that are neither paranormal nor supernatural.\n\nThe film features interviews with the home’s current owner and explores how the strange events in the home — weird lights and stuff moving around — have impacted her life. The film also treats the ghost hunters themselves like characters, and they get a lot of air time."
