        "text": "This template does not require a rating on Wikipedia's content assessment scale.\n\nIt is of interest to the following WikiProjects:\n\nAs of this writing, I have reverted revisions by User:Neutralhomer to this template twice tonight and will do so only once more (if necessary) in this 24-hour time period. User:Neutralhomer is attempting to improperly and unnecessarily modify this template rather than properly correct the problems at Moody Broadcasting Network. The article in question is using this template, a template for translator stations (as defined and licensed by the US government, and tailor made to do so) rather than the much more appropriate {{RadioRebroadcasters}}, as the stations listed in the article are NOT translator stations (as defined and licensed by the US government). JPG-GR (talk)\n\nI have now made my final revert on the template for this 24-hours period. User:Neutralhomer REFUSES to acknowledge or accept that no current US radio station has more than 21 translator stations (and has produced no evidence to support his implication). Long story short - he is attempting to modify a template when there is already a template designed for this specific use available, that being {{RadioRebroadcasters}}. JPG-GR (talk)\n\nHere is some \"evidence\" that supports my \"more than 21\" claim...ALOT.\n\nTranslating KAWZ TWIN FALLS, ID 89.9 FM K206DG 89.1 KENAI, AK LICENSED K216DG 91.1 KETCHIKAN, AK LICENSED 02/04/2000 K216DF 91.1 KODIAK, AK LICENSED K220FW 91.9 SELDOVIA, AK LICENSED K220FY 91.9 SITKA, AK LICENSED 04/04/2000 W273AJ 102.5 ATHENS, AL LICENSED 02/07/2007 W209BL 89.7 HUNTSVILLE, AL LICENSED 04/11/2002 W214BN 90.7 MALBIS, AL LICENSED 05/15/2001 K268AQ 101.5 BENTONVILLE, AR LICENSED 07/24/2006 K215EE 90.9 FAYETTEVILLE, AR LICENSED 12/02/1999 K218DE 91.5 JONESBORO, AR LICENSED 11/19/2001 K204DN 88.7 PARAGOULD, AR LICENSED 11/19/2002 K207CW 89.3 PARIS, AR LICENSED 10/28/2002 K204DO 88.7 PINE BLUFF, AR LICENSED 03/28/2002 K210DY 89.9 BLACK CANYON CITY, AZ LICENSED 03/15/2001 K220GI 91.9 CAMP VERDE, AZ LICENSED K220IL 91.9 CLIFTON, AZ LICENSED 08/07/2001 K258AL 99.5 GROOM CREEK, AZ LICENSED K217CN 91.3 HOLBROOK, AZ LICENSED K219KQ 91.7 PAYSON, AZ LICENSED 08/28/2001 K218DV 91.5 PINETOP, AZ LICENSED K206DH 89.1 WINSLOW, AZ LICENSED 02/12/2002 K211DD 90.1 YUMA, AZ LICENSED K262AM 100.3 ANDERSON, CA LICENSED 02/14/2005 K289AN 105.7 BAKERSFIELD, CA LICENSED 01/24/2005 K212BD 90.3 BARSTOW, CA LICENSED 10/25/2001 K234AL 94.7 BELLVUE, CA LICENSED 06/15/2004 K214ED 90.7 BENA, CA LICENSED 03/31/2000 K212DF 90.3 BEND, CA LICENSED 04/12/2000 K221EU 92.1 BIG SUR, CA LICENSED 09/21/2007 K209CY 89.7 BLYTHE, CA LICENSED 02/01/2000 K217EL 91.3 BORREGO SPRINGS, CA LICENSED 11/19/2001 K217EA 91.3 BROWNSVILLE, CA LICENSED 07/19/2001 K203CU 88.5 BURNEY, CA LICENSED K225AJ 92.9 BURNEY/REDDING, CA LICENSED 11/28/2001 K207DN 89.3 BYRON, CA LICENSED 05/29/2001 K221ET 92.1 CHUALAR, CA LICENSED 08/29/2007 K212DJ 90.3 CLEARLAKE, CA LICENSED 09/26/2001 K217EQ 91.3 COALINGA, CA LICENSED K207CE 89.3 COTTONWOOD, CA LICENSED 10/27/1999 K272AY 102.3 CRESCENT CITY, CA LICENSED 12/06/2001 K288DR 105.5 DESERT HOT SPRINGS, CA LICENSED K235AG 94.9 DORRIS, CA LICENSED 08/31/2000 K214DM 90.7 DURHAM/CHICO, CA LICENSED 05/03/2000 K229AF 93.7 EUREKA, CA LICENSED 08/15/2001 K289AO 105.7 FALL RIVER MILLS, CA LICENSED 12/12/2006 K211DG 90.1 FIREBAUGH, CA LICENSED K201HL 88.1 GARBERVILLE, CA LICENSED K272DX 102.3 GRASS VALLEY, CA LICENSED 10/12/2006 K216EC 91.1 HAPPY CAMP, CA LICENSED 10/27/1999 K260BI 99.9 HAVILAH, CA LICENSED 11/18/2006 K205DT 88.9 INDIO, CA LICENSED 05/06/2003 K216EW 91.1 KERNVILLE, CA LICENSED 12/03/2002 K207CT 89.3 LAKEHEAD, CA LICENSED K212EP 90.3 LANDERS, CA LICENSED 09/20/2001 K213AR 90.5 LAS CRUCES, ETC., CA LICENSED K216AX 91.1 LAUREL, CA LICENSED K210DQ 89.9 LAYTONVILLE, CA LICENSED 12/14/2004 K216CO 91.1 LOMPOC, CA LICENSED K201FW 88.1 LOS GATOS, CA LICENSED 06/11/2001 K220IA 91.9 MAPLE CREEK, CA LICENSED 08/15/2001 K214CT 90.7 MARIPOSA, CA LICENSED 07/31/2001 K262AO 100.3 MARYSVILLE, CA LICENSED 03/12/2007 K234AW 94.7 MONTEREY, CA LICENSED 08/22/2007 K267AJ 101.3 MT.

When I checked in October, I either overlooked that lengthly list as an anomaly or presumed some of those translators are translators or rebroadcasters (ugh). Either way, your reasoning for adding entries to the template was invalid, as you were adding to the wrong template. JPG-GR (talk)\n\nYou overlooked some 200+ stations? Dude....why don't I believe that. Still, just California has 73 stations...73! If you added just California to the CSN page, you would be WAY over your \"only 21\" limit. I suggest that you expand that template...ALOT. Probably 75 will do....unless Texas has more (didn't count them)...and that is just KAWZ, there are probably more. Remember American Family Radio has craploads of translators. - NeutralHomer T:C\n\nAs there is no article for KAWZ at this point, and as I've already said it would violate WP:NOT#DIR, there is no reason to at this time. JPG-GR (talk)\n\nIt would all be under CSN International where, as stated in the article itself, \"KAWZ is the uplink station, owned by Calvary Chapel of Twin Falls\". So, they would all go there. Hey, that is something for ya to do tonight.\n\nAlso, when you said translators \"only exist on the FM band\", this is technically true....BUT they also re-broadcast AM signals.\n\nTranslating KCSP KANSAS CITY, MO AM 610 K271BE 102.1 GLENROCK, WY LICENSED 07/25/2007\n\nTranslating WIZK BAY SPRINGS, MS AM 1570 W249AO 97.7 HATTIESBURG, MS LICENSED\n\nTranslating WQVA LEXINGTON, SC AM 1170 K276DR 103.1 MONTPELIER, ID LICENSED\n\nYou figure that last one out. Originally it was just Alaskan stations that could do that with KOTZ AM-720 in Kotzebue rebroadcasting on a couple FM translators, but the FCC began (in Mid-2007) allowing AM's elsewhere to rebroadcast on FM too. Mostly the translators on located in small towns (Kentucky and Virginia has a few) where AM and FM signals are hard to recieve and most still listen to AM.\n\nEither way, you still will have to expand your template. - NeutralHomer T:C\n\nOh and I checked and American Family Radio doesn't have as many translators as I thought. Probably only 50 to 60. My mistake there. - NeutralHomer T:C\n\nI'd love to know why you are now trying to lecture me on stuff I already know about translators & rebroadcasters, despite apparently not knowing the difference an hour ago. JPG-GR (talk)\n\nAnd, I don't have to add anything to \"my\" template, as I do not own any templates. I think you're a little confused. JPG-GR (talk)\n\nLike I said on ANI...I never said I didn't know, I just asked what the difference was. You can know something and still ask.\n\n...and you most certainly do OWN the templates you create. If you didn't, we wouldn't be having this conversation...now would we? - NeutralHomer T:C\n\nWe wouldn't be having this conversation if you didn't have my talk page watchlisted and been stalking my edits, as I pointed out nearly two hours ago. But, that's just splitting hairs. JPG-GR (talk)\n\nDude, like I told you before, I wouldn't have to keep an eye on you, if you knew what the hell you were doing.\n\nThe \"only 21 entries rule\" on your template and then being proved wrong by the MASSIVE list above and THEN you admitting you \"overlooked\" it...shows you have to be watched because you don't know what you are doing and obviously DON'T check your work.\n\nIf you didn't \"overlook\" the 200+ list, we wouldn't be having this conversation at all, because you would have done it right in the first place. - NeutralHomer T:C\n\nYou are truly one of the most insulting people I've ever come across in my entire time online. And, that's going on a decade now. Yes, you CLEARLY need to keep an eye on me. How about this? Take me off your damn watchlist as the next time you show up with no reason in a discussion that doesn't involve you even REMOTELY, especially on my talk page, I'm reporting you for wikistalking and pointing out this lovely dif as you admitting it. Try keeping an eye on your own edits, rather than mine or any of your other \"unfortunate victims.\" I see no blocks on my record, so I think I'm doing just fine. This \"conversation\" has ended. Period. JPG-GR (talk)\n\nI love when the conversation isn't going your way, you threaten, insult and end the conversation and you think you have \"won\". You are like the kid with the ball. Kid gets angry at the other kids, so he takes his ball, stomps off, and goes home. You are like that kid. never liked that kid Oh well.\n\nYou report me for WikiStalking, go ahead. I think I can find a few occasions where you have done the same.\n\nOh and calling me \"one of the most insulting people I've ever come across in my entire time online\"....I take that as a compliment. Thanks! :)\n\nNow, since you obviously won't, I will be updating the template (I think someone else is going to nom it for merge) so that it can be used for states with more than 21 translators. You have clearly be shown that there are instances where states have more than 21 translators of any given network and refuse to update the template, so, AGAIN....I will.\n\nI really wish you would play better with others, then you would be home, alone, with your ball....while all the other kids are playing. - NeutralHomer T:C\n\nTry reading WP:NPA. And, I mean really reading it. Not looking over this comment and ignoring it. And, for the last time, {{RadioTranslators}} isn't for \"states with more than 21 translators\". ALL STATES have more than 21 translators. Unless you are referring to rebroadcasters... oh wait, you still aren't reading my posts, just choosing to believe what you want... JPG-GR (talk)\n\nI thought the post above was your last on the subject? No matter.\n\nYou see that list up there, the big one. Those are translators. W222AA or K222AA are calls for translators NOT rebroadcasters. So translators would use the {{RadioTranslators}} and according to that very list, KAWZ-FM (parent station of CSN International) has 73 translators in California. Now, I didn't take Algebra or anything, but I think 73 is greater than 21.....52 greater. So, you would have to expand {{RadioTranslators}}.\n\nAll clear on that? OK, good. - NeutralHomer T:C\n\nOh yeah, and saying I am \"one of the most insulting people I've ever come across in my entire time online\" is probably a violation of WP:NPA too. You might want to read it as well. - NeutralHomer T:C"
