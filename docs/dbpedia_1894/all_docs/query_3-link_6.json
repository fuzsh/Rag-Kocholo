        "text": "2011\n\nCity Locations\n\nVancouver, Richmond, Langley (Canada)\n\nLocation Types\n\nAmerican, Cafe, Office, Riverside\n\nLocation Styles\n\nBeachfront, Bed & Breakfast, Cape Cod, Colonial, Building Dated, Parking Lot, Film Studio\n\nAbout Once Upon a Time\n\nFrom 2011 to 2018, ABC aired an American fantasy drama TV series called Once Upon a Time. The creators and producers were Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Its ensemble cast included Ginnifer Goodwin, Jennifer Morrison, Lana Parrilla, Jared S. Gilmore, Robert Carlyle, and Colin O'Donoghue. Each episode typically features two segments. One segment details the characters' past, revealing how they are connected to the curse and its consequences. The other segment takes place in the present and offers similar insights but with a different outcome. The series follows the adventures of Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), who is drawn to a small Maine town called Storybrooke by an enigmatic 10-year-old boy named Henry (Jared S. Gilmore). She soon discovers that the city is inhabited by characters from fairy tales and other stories living in the \"real world,\" unaware of their true identity when the Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla) casts a spell over them. Emma begins to discover her past and break the curse by reuniting the characters with their lost memories. In its seventh and final season, the \"real-world\" portion of the story occurs in Seattle, Washington, in a fictitious neighborhood known as Hyperion Heights, with new main narratives led by adult Henry (Andrew J. West) and his wife and daughter. The first season received positive critical response, with a \"generally favorable reviews\" score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic. Once Upon a Time was nominated for various awards across its seven seasons. It was nominated for Favorite New TV Drama at the 2012 People's Choice Awards but lost to Person of Interest. At the 40th People's Choice Awards, the show was nominated but failed to Beauty and the Beast. It also received a Best Network Television Series nomination at the 38th Saturn Awards, and Parrilla was nominated for Best Supporting Actress on Television. However, both awards were lost to Fringe and Michelle Forbes, respectively.\n\nOnce Upon a Time Locations\n\nThe hit television show Once Upon a Time has been filmed in the Greater Vancouver area throughout its 2011-2018 run. The primary filming location is Steveston, a charming seaside village in Richmond that transforms into the fictional town of Storybrooke for the series. But the production also occurs at many other spectacular locations around Vancouver, providing a stunning backdrop for the show's iconic scenes. The backdrop of this region is truly awe-inspiring. From the waterfront of Steveston to downtown Vancouver, viewers can glimpse spectacular mountain vistas and lush forests from their televisions. Many memorable scenes were shot at recognizable landmarks, such as the Nikka Industries Clock Tower on Moncton Street, which serves as one of many iconic props in the show. Other locations used for filming include Grannyâs Diner and the library, both located on Moncton Street. A trip to these locations would be highly worthwhile for any diehard fan of Once Upon a Time. Fans could explore Stevestonâs historic streets or take in breathtaking views from anywhere around Vancouver while imagining they are walking through Storybrooke themselves. The area also has plenty of exciting activities, including visiting nearby scenic parks and attractions like Granville Island Public Market and Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge, allowing fans to experience real-life fantasy worlds near where their favorite show was filmed.\n\nThe scene at Granny's Diner symbolizes Emma's (Jennifer Morrison) and Henry's (Jared S. Gilmore) growing relationship, with this particular scene showing how far their bond has come since Emma first arrived in town. Red (Meghan Ory) serves Emma hot chocolate with cinnamon at Granny's diner. This particular hot chocolate with cinnamon is a recurring theme throughout the series, significant to Emma and Henry. Initially, Emma mistakenly believes that the sheriff, Graham (Jamie Dornan), is the one who sent her the drink. Later on, it turns out that Henry was the one who guessed that Emma preferred her hot chocolate with cinnamon because he also liked it. Then, Henry asked Emma to walk him to school. While walking, he noticed that Emma was about to bite an apple. He inquired where the apple came from, and Emma replied that Regina (Lana Parrilla) had given it to her. However, Henry slapped the apple out of her hand and exclaimed, \"Don't eat that!\" horrifiedly. The location used for Grannyâs Diner is the Cannery Cafe in Richmond, British Columbia. It is located at 3711 Moncton St, Richmond, British Columbia, and looks pretty much like it did when filming took place in 2011. The Cannery Cafe features a variety of dishes, from traditional breakfast foods to burgers and sandwiches. It also has a full bar with craft beers and rotating selections on tap. To get to Cannery Cafe, you can take public transit, as there are several bus stops nearby, or take a taxi or ride-sharing service from Vancouver International Airport (YVR). Alternatively, if you're driving from YVR, direct roads will take about 20 minutes, such as Grant McConachie Way or Russ Baker Way S and Steveston Hwy, which will take around 15 minutes, depending on traffic.\n\nVisit Vancouver Filming Locations\n\nThe setting for this scene is Storybrooke Town Hall, where Regina works as the Mayor. The apple tree is located behind the town hall. The scene in \"Desperate Souls\" (season 1, episode 8) perfectly encapsulates the power struggle between the two main characters, Emma and Regina. As the fire breaks out at the town hall, Emma (Jennifer Morrison) bravely uses a fire extinguisher to create a path for Regina (Lana Parrilla) to escape. While Regina is not happy that Emma, her political rival, saved her, she is also upset that Emma's campaign gained popularity due to the incident. The scene was filmed at Fort Langley Community Hall, built in 1931 by renowned Vancouver architect Archibald Campbell Hope. This building holds significant historical and aesthetic value to the Township of Langley and is considered a landmark by many who live there. It features stunning brickwork and beautiful stained glass windows, which were present during filming. To get to Fort Langley Community Hall from Vancouver, take Trans-Canada Hwy/BC-1 E from Surrey and exit at 61. After that, keep driving straight on 216 St while in Walnut Grove, and at last, take a right onto 88 Ave. Next, turn left on Glover Road and go straight until you reach Fort Langley Community Hall's parking lot.\n\nAccess Vancouver Video Shoot Locations\n\nThe scene from the first season, 19 episode, occurs in the local convent and features Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) feeling suspicious of August (Eion Bailey). The tension between them is palpable as it slowly becomes more and more apparent that August may be Baelfire, the long-lost son of Gold. This scene could be seen as iconic due to its setting, as it marks an emotional turning point in Gold's relationship with his son and a significant moment in their journey of reuniting. The scene was shot at Burnaby Art Gallery, also known as Fairacres Mansion, in Vancouver, Canada. It is a stunning 1911 Arts and Crafts-style mansion designed by architect R.P.S. Twizell for Grace Ceperley and her husband. The exterior views of the building feature gorgeous gardens with mature trees and serene pathways. At the same time, indoors, one can find unique handcrafted woodwork coupled with stained glass windows which creates a warm atmosphere filled with history and charm. To get to this location, itâs best to take public transit via Expo Line from downtown Vancouver to Edmonds (20 minutes) and then transfer bus #123 (13 minutes). Alternatively, you can take an Uber/Lyft directly to Fairacres Mansion (15 minutes).\n\nVancouver Film Shoot Locations Directory\n\nThe seventeenth episode of season three of Once Upon a Time is set at the docks. Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) is talking to Smee (Christopher Gauthier) about his missing ship, The Jolly Roger, and trying to find out what happened. Emma (Jennifer Morrison) then appears with Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) Hook tries to flirt with her, telling her that it's good she is learning about magic so she can defeat Zelena (Rebecca Mader). He also clarifies that she cannot return to her old life as it did not work for him. This scene is iconic for show fans due to the romantic tension between Hook and Emma and the references to his boat, which serves as a metaphor for his true love. The scene was filmed on Steveston Fisherman's Wharf in Richmond, a well-known area among locals and visitors for being a popular filming location throughout the show's 2011-2018 run. Whether you're a local or a visitor, the shoreline attraction offers a glimpse into the local fishing industry and the region's cannery-era heyday. It's a great place to spend a few hours exploring.

Alternatively, you can take a taxi or rental car if you're coming from further away or don't have access to public transportation.\n\nUncover Vancouver Production Spaces\n\nThis scene on the beach is a crucial moment for Emma (Jennifer Morrison) and Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) as Mulan (Jamie Chung) and Princess Aurora (Sarah Bolger) capture them on their journey to free Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) from the curse. Mulan throws a bola at Mary Margaret while trying to escape from an isolated island with Emma, making her lose consciousness. Mulan instructs the refugees to take them to \"the pit.\" Emma hears a voice that turns out to be Cora (Barbara Hershey), Regina's estranged mother, offering to assist her. Here, Cora makes her surprise appearance, offering to help them escape the island. The scene was filmed at Iona Beach Regional Park in Richmond, Canada. The park provides an ideal location for filming due to its wide open spaces and stunning views of the Georgia Straight south and west of Vancouver. The beach extends along Fraser Riverâs shoreline, with boardwalks providing access to various viewpoints. During low tide, visitors can also spot multiple sea birds wading amongst exposed sandbars, while sandy beaches offer excellent opportunities for beachcombing or exploring tidal pools teeming with life. Iona Beach Regional Park can easily be reached by car or public transit from Vancouver or Richmond. From Vancouverâs downtown core, take a road via Granville St and Ferguson Rd, which will take you directly to Iona Beach Regional Parkâs main entrance at Ferguson Road in Richmond.

After King Henry (Tony Perez) had moved on, the tower's bell rang once to signify his freed soul, a scene that touched many show fans. The Clock Tower can be found at 3551 Moncton Street in Richmond, which used to be owned by Nikka Industries and was previously a fishing and marine supply shop that is now closed.
