        "text": "(BBC)\n\nIndie sleaze has been making a revival, The Hunger Games are back on Netflix, and skinny jeans… Okay, so skinny jeans may not currently be in vogue, but regardless, there has been a slowly growing buzz surrounding all things 2010s. Which brings us, in our TikTok-saturated era, to the first purveyor of all things trendy: Tumblr.\n\nIn the 2010s, Tumblr was where things happened first -- in fashion, memes, entertainment, and more. Tumblr had basically everything on it, yet one of the most memorable parts of it was the fandom activity (and endless meme GIFs) spawned by shows that became staples of the site. Whether you actually watched it, or just saw a screencap of it, here are 10 shows that were crucial to the Tumblr experience!\n\n1. \"Supernatural\"\n\nA Tumblr TV show list would simply not be complete without the work of the \"Supernatural\" fandom, which became one of the most omnipresent groups on the site. \"Supernatural\" began on The WB (later the CW) in 2005, and only just finished its run in 2020, in its 15th season. It follows the story of two monster-hunter brothers, Sam and Dean, who are looking for the demon that killed their mother. The plot thickens, of course, and goes off the rails toward the end of all those seasons, but people stay for the characters — particularly Castiel, the third of the Sam-and-Dean trio who is introduced in Season 4. \"Supernatural\" was, and likely still is, the crowning jewel of Tumblr TV shows; if you were on Tumblr in 2013, a GIF from the show was simply unavoidable. You can currently stream \"Supernatural\" on Netflix, but it’s also available to buy/rent on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, and Google Play.\n\n2. \"Adventure Time\"\n\n\"Adventure Time\" is a Tumblr show that holds up, and its cute animation style and whimsical cast of characters make it a perfect comfort show. \"Adventure Time\" follows the stories of 12-year old Finn the Human and his magical best friend/adoptive brother Jake the Dog in the post-apocalyptic land of Ooo. It’s a kids show, but many adults still enjoy the series for its weird humor, relaxing element, and growth throughout the seasons. In its airing from 2010 through 2018 on Cartoon Network, \"Adventure Time\" matured with its audience, and while remaining more light, it grappled with more advanced themes and did not always have a happy ending. Overall, \"Adventure Time\" is one of the most beloved of Tumblr shows; even if you never saw the show, you've definitely seen the GIFs. Willow Smith even wrote two songs after character Marceline from the show. You can stream it on HBO Max or Hulu, and rent/buy on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, and Google Play. There is also a spinoff on HBO Max currently.\n\n3. \"Skins\"\n\nThere’s a classic GIF of a girl crying on every edgy Tumblr blog ever, and that girl is often none other than protagonist Effy from \"Skins\". \"Skins\" was the \"Euphoria\" of 2007 to 2013, and is an ensemble story of the lives of British teenagers 2 years from graduation; it, too, focuses on dark themes like substance abuse, mental health disorders, and interpersonal relationship drama. \"Skins\" explores a troubled cast of teens through long school days and wild parties at night. It showcases the deep and powerful emotions of young people trying to find their footing in the world and became relatable for many people, if not romanticized. On Tumblr, \"Skins\" was a mirror for many people struggling with mental health, and through the show, people would reflect on and catalogue some of their own feelings. \"Skins\" has a complicated legacy, but the impact it had on a generation of teens is undeniable. You can stream it on Hulu or Netflix, and buy/rent through Google Play.\n\n4. \"Doctor Who\"\n\nOn Tumblr was this thing called “SuperWhoLock”, and while the name is silly, it comprised the “elite” triad of Tumblr TV fandoms. The \"Super\" came from \"Supernatural\", as expected, but with the “Who”, we finally arrive at \"Doctor Who\". \"Doctor Who\" was around long before Tumblr and had its first 26-season run from 1963 through 1989. It was, and still is, one of the most quintessential British TV shows, which revolves around the adventures of a humanoid alien time traveller called the Doctor as he roams the universe in his iconic TARDIS. The show, after a 16-year hiatus, resumed in 2005, where it then got its grip on Tumblr. The most popular years for \"Doctor Who\" on Tumblr were 2005-2013, when David Tennant and then Matt Smith played Doctors Ten and Eleven, respectively. At present, \"Doctor Who\" has had its first female Doctor, played by Jodie Whittaker, whose reign ended in 2022. The next Doctor? David Tennant reprising his role. The Fifteenth Doctor will be Ncuti Gatwa, the first Doctor of Color. You can stream the 2005 and onwards \"Doctor Who\" through HBO Max, or buy/rent through Amazon, iTunes, or Google Play.\n\n5. \"Misfits\"\n\nTumblr sure loves its U.K. television, and \"Misfits\" was no exception. While only 5 seasons were released between 2009 and 2013, with 37 episodes total, \"Misfits\" is the kind of show you forget watching until you hear of it and then remember how fun it was. It’s a sci-fi comedy about 5 young criminal offenders who, in a strange lightning storm, develop supernatural powers with which they must battle adults-turned-monsters from the same storm. The show-stealer is really Nathan, played by a young Robert Sheehan; he’s laugh-out-loud funny, bad-boy complicated, and really makes \"Misfits\" what it is for the first 2 seasons he stars in it. \"Misfits\" was loved deeply by its niche Tumblr community and is a light-hearted teen counterpart to darker shows like \"Skins\". You can stream it on Pluto TV for free or on Hulu, and buy/rent through Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, and Vudu.\n\n6. \"Teen Wolf\"\n\nBack to American shows, we have \"Teen Wolf\", about, well, a teen wolf. Werewolf, that is. \"Teen Wolf\" is based on Michael J. Fox’s 1985 cult film, but the 2011 to 2017 TV show follows Scott McCall, played by Tyler Posey, as he manages everyday high school and his new identity as a werewolf. He encounters many paranormal and interpersonal obstacles, but the key to \"Teen Wolf\" is his well-developed cast of friends that only grows throughout the seasons. Most notable is an early-career Dylan O’Brien cast as Stiles, Scott’s best friend and the most-GIF’d character of perhaps any on the show. \"Teen Wolf\" is a perfect teen show: enjoyable but not too deep. You can stream it on Prime Video or Hulu, and buy/rent through Google Play, Vudu, and Amazon.\n\n7. \"Steven Universe\"\n\n\"Steven Universe\" came a little later in the Tumblr era, only coming out in 2013, but its influence cannot be understated. Created by Rebecca Sugar, a writer and storyboard artist for \"Adventure Time\", \"Steven Universe\" continues the legacy of unique fantasy released on Cartoon Network and adopted by Tumblr users. It tells the story of Steven and the alien Gems as they protect their fictional town Beach City from monsters and other threats. It’s magical and gorgeously illustrated, but \"Steven Universe\" is really significant for its LGBTQ+ representation and its themes of family, love, and community. It’s another kids show loved by adults, and while it ended in 2019, it still lives on in books, the limited series epilogue, video games, toys, and comics. You can stream \"Steven Universe\" on HBO Max or Hulu, and buy/rent through Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, and Vudu.\n\n8. \"Once Upon a Time\"\n\nMore adult-oriented than many of the Tumblr teen shows, \"Once Upon a Time\" (2011-2018) is like the grown-up version of the Sisters Grimm books. It follows Emma Swan as she moves to Storybrooke, Maine, for her son Henry, now adopted by a resident of the town. Yet, Storybrooke is not all it seems, and truthfully, the residents are all fairy tale characters under a curse that prevents them from remembering their past fairy tale lives. \"Once Upon a Time\" oscillates between the fantasy world and the small central town, and slowly pieces together the story of what really happened in Storybrooke. It has an incredible redemption arc throughout the seasons and strong female protagonists. You can stream \"Once Upon a Time\" fittingly through Disney+, or rent/buy through Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, and Vudu.\n\n9. \"Merlin\"\n\nTeetering on the verge of power triad “SuperWhoLock”, 2008 to 2012 BBC show \"Merlin\" did not quite make it in but was adjacent to those fandoms. It retells the Arthurian legend of the wizard Merlin — only this time, Merlin is a young man, and magic is banned in the land of Camelot. Merlin becomes manservant to Prince Arthur and must hide his magic while also protecting the prince from various hijinks. The best part of the show is the slow-burn enemies-to-friends dynamic between Merlin and Arthur. The ending of its 5 seasons is one to cry to, but the friendship found along the way is worth it. Heavy on the fantasy and adventure, Merlin is a classic of many Tumblr GIFs, and remains a staple of the site. You can stream it free on Plex, Pluto TV, and Tubi, or with a subscription to Prime Video, NBC, and Peacock. It is also available to buy or rent via iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, and Vudu.\n\n10. \"Sherlock\"\n\nThe third bit of the “SuperWhoLock” name, \"Sherlock\" is one of the Big 3 of Tumblr TV shows. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch, the 2010 to 2017 BBC \"Sherlock\" is only 13 episodes long and derived from, of course, the original Adventures of Sherlock Holmes novels but recasts it in a modern setting with a greyer protagonist. The writing is extremely sharp, alongside the acting, and it’s probably one of the most critically-acclaimed television shows that was popular on Tumblr. It’s also notable for being one of the few non-fantasy/paranormal shows that was extremely popular on the site. \"Sherlock\" follows Sherlock Holmes as a consulting detective, solving cases leading up to the final showdown with eternal enemy James Moriarty. John Watson is played by Martin Freeman, and the chemistry in the central pair of \"Sherlock\" makes one of the best detective duos on TV. You can stream the first season on Fubo for free, or buy/rent through Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, and Vudu.\n\nTumblr gave us some of the formational shows of our teenage years. And what’s wrong with a little nostalgia? Let us know your favorite Tumblr TV show, or any we should have included on the list!"
