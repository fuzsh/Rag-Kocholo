If you’re looking for books set between 2000-2009, you can find them here.\n\nOur fiction recommendations include works of drama, romance, comedy, and young adult literature. Each provides insights into the culture and social issues of the decade. Memoir and non-fiction titles also closely examine relevant topics of the decade.\n\nThe Twenty-Tens – A Look Back at the Not-So-Distant Past\n\nThe 2010s shined a light on new and lingering inequalities, both in America and around the world. This focus led to both strife and progress. Mass shootings and natural disasters permeated throughout the decade, and politics became increasingly divisive.\n\nSocial media use evolved from a simple way to stay connected with friends into an easy way to influence strangers. Sometimes it’s good, like our ability to share favorite books with you right now. Or the money raised for ALS research during the viral Ice Bucket Challenge. However, social media’s full negative ramifications are still being learned. Sadly, this includes increased teen suicide and dangerous misinformation spreading like wildfire during elections.\n\nAlong the way, there were fundamental changes in how we travel and vacation. The sharing economy led to huge new companies like Uber and Airbnb. Alternative energies have become more advanced, and many companies have become more aware of their environmental impacts. We learned more about the harm of things like single-use plastics. We have a way to go, but by the end of the twenty-tens, we were doing a better job protecting Earth than when the decade started.\n\nFor additional historical context, check out the timeline of major world events included at the end of the post.\n\nBooks Set in the 2010s\n\nBook Summary\n\nThis dual-timeline novel weaves together past and present stories of War and immigration. In 1938 Vienna, Samuel Adler was just six when his father disappeared during Kristallnacht. In order to save her son’s life, his mother secured him a spot on the last Kindertransport train out of Nazi-occupied Austria. He boarded the train alone, bound for the UK with nothing more than a change of clothes and his violin.\n\nEighty years later, a mother and daughter board a train seeking a better life. They are fleeing danger in El Salvador, but their arrival in the US coincides with the new family separation policy. Anita, just seven years old and blind, finds herself alone at a camp in Nogales. She comforts herself by escaping into a fantasy world called Azabahar that she dreamed up with her sisters back home.\n\nA young social worker named Selena is assigned to Anita’s case, and with the help of a lawyer, they discover that Anita has one relative in the US – Leticia Cordero, who works in the home of 86-year-old Samuel Adler.\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n99% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nRuth Jefferson is a 44-year-old labor and delivery nurse with twenty years of experience at a Connecticut hospital. After being reassigned away from a patient, she learns that the parents are white supremacists and don’t want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child.\n\nThe hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey the orders of her superiors based on the parent’s mandate, or does she intervene?\n\nThis story is told from three alternating points of view: Ruth, the nurse; Kennedy, her middle-aged attorney; and Turk, the newbornâs white supremacist father.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nThis novel is an emotional roller coaster ride that is painful to read at times, but we promise that itâs totally worth it. You may need to take a little break after reading the first chapter from Turkâs perspective, but after some deep breaths, please, please pick this book back up and keep reading. If we had the power, weâd make this book required reading for everyone!\n\nAlso Featured on These Book Lists:\n\nBooks With Characters in Their 40s\n\nBooks Set in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n96% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nA Hope More Powerful Than the Sea is a non-fiction book that reads like page-turning fiction. In the 2010s, the Syrian refugee crisis flooded the news, with many countries overwhelmed trying to process the vast numbers of asylum seekers fleeing their war-torn homes.\n\nThis book tells the well-rounded story of one girl, Doaa, starting with her life in Syria before the war and following her journey of strength, courage, and sorrow. Each page is compelling as you get an inside look at a 19-year-old refugee who first fought to stay in Syria and then fought for her life and the lives of other children during a harrowing four days at sea.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nThis is one of Melissa’s favorite books of all time. It intersects a dramatic page-turning story with rare insight into everything a refugee endures before landing in another country to ask for asylum. If you loved Adunni in The Girl with the Louding Voice, we think you’ll also fall in love with Doaa.\n\nMelissa Fleming was born in Massachusetts and has spent her adult life living in Europe and working for international refugee organizations. She leads communications for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and travels to war zones and refugee camps to give voice to those people forcibly displaced from their homes. In A Hope More Powerful Than the Sea, she tells the story of one of the Syrian refugees she worked with.\n\nAlso Featured on These Book Lists:\n\nBooks Set in the Middle East\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n100% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nClaude is the youngest son in a family with five brothers. And he firmly knows that when he grows up, he wants to be a girl. His parents see his sincerity and opt to move out of their smaller town to Seattle, where they expect people to be more accepting of others. However, despite being okay with Claude being whoever he is, they donât want themselves or Claude to be targeted as weird. In their new city, Claude is Poppy. The entire family keeps the secret until everything explodes one day.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nThis story is a timely look at the inner workings of a family with a transgender child. While the book is about a fictionalized family, the author has first-hand experiences with the topic, giving authenticity to the parents’ perspectives.\n\nKindle Unlimited as of: 10/04/2023\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n96% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nIn the tiny community of Beartown, life revolves around hockey. It provides entertainment and hope for a better future. It’s a story about hockey, small-town life, and much more. When a shocking event occurs, the town quickly takes sides. Who will stand up for the truth and put hockey above humanity? The themes are definitely relevant to the decade.\n\nIf you’ve already read Beartown and the sequel Us Against You, this is a great excuse to pick up the final book in the Trilogy, The Winners, which was published in September 2022. It’s set two years after Beartown, so it still sneaks into the 2010s.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nFredrik Backman has a gift with words, melodic phrasing, and unparalleled insight into human motivations. He writes characters that are so well-rounded that even if you disagree with their decisions, you understand what they were thinking. We both gave this one all the stars!\n\nAlso Featured on These Book Lists:\n\nBooks with Teenage Characters\n\nBest Books to Read in Winter 2023\n\nReadersâ Favorite Books: 2021 Edition\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n100% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nChanel Miller first took the world by storm in 2016 as Emily Doe after her victim impact statement in a sexual assault hearing against Brock Turner went viral. Her memoir goes into more depth about her life before, during, and after that night. She’s vulnerable and brave, sharing her struggles each step of the way.\n\nWhile the prominent Me Too Movement started in 2017 with Harvey Weinstein, Chanel Miller’s bravery and beautiful writing in 2016 was a precursor and opened millions of eyes to the second assault women face in the courts and public perception.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nMelissa read this and was blown away by the brilliant writing. It’s not just an account of a terrible event, it’s full of beautiful language and raw emotion.\n\nAlso Featured on These Book Lists:\n\nBooks with Characters in Their 20s\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n88% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nRandolph and Buddy Lee are both ex-cons, but have very different lives. Randolph left his past behind and started a successful lawn care business. He has a loving wife and owns a lovely small home. Buddy Lee is a barely functioning alcoholic living in a run-down trailer.\n\nBesides both being ex-cons, the only thing they have in common is that their sons married each other, and both dads handled that poorly.\n\nWhen both sons are brutally murdered, the men meet because of their shared goal – finding out what really happened to their boys.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nEvery chapter is easy to visualize in detail, but you won’t just see the characters. You’ll experience their emotions throughout the compelling story. Amid the page-turning tale, there are also great reminders about life and the importance of choosing to love your family while you can.\n\nWARNING: If you’re sensitive to violence or lots of rough language, consider skipping this one. The downside of being able to picture every scene is that the descriptive writing includes the violent scenes.\n\nAlso Featured on These Book Lists:\n\nBest Books of 2021\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n92% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nAfter suffering a head injury in her home country of Mexico, Maribel’s family must move to Delaware so she can attend a special school, which will give her the best chance of recovery. The neighbors within their new apartment building are from other Central & South American countries, creating a bond as they try to adapt to their new home.\n\nIt’s a great look at the challenges of the immigrant experience and the lengths parents will go to for their children. You’ll also see an unlikely love story between Maribel and one of the boys from the apartment complex.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nMelissa read this one back in 2015 and rated it 5 stars. Some reviewers don’t love that the coming-of-age story writing skewed a bit more toward YA versus literary fiction, but Melissa didn’t mind.\n\nAlso Featured on These Book Lists:\n\nBooks Set in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n93% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nWhile roommates aren’t a concept unique to the 2010s, this decade was the rise of the sharing economy from ride-sharing to desk-sharing in coworking spots. The Flatshare takes this prevalence into a British apartment.\n\nWhen night-shift worker Leon needs extra cash to help a family member, he decides to get a roommate. The problem is that he has a one-bedroom flat with just one bed. So he places an ad for someone to sleep in his bed while he’s at work. Of course, they’ll never be home simultaneously, but it’s still a crazy plan. But it’s just the affordable solution that Sophie needs after a breakup.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nThe Flatshare will make you laugh out loud as Leon and Sophie exchange notes and learn to co-habitat on opposite schedules. Under the humor, however, more serious storylines encompass other topics equally relevant to the last decade.\n\nYou can also now watch the streaming series adaptation of The Flatshare.\n\nAlso Featured on These Book Lists:\n\nBest Books of 2020\n\nBooks Like The Hating Game\n\n20 Books Like It Ends With Us\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n97% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nThe Newcomers follows twenty-two immigrant teenagers throughout the 2015-2016 school year as they land at South High School in Denver, Colorado. Ranging in age from fourteen to nineteen, most of these students came directly from refugee camps in countries plagued by war, famine, or drought.\n\nThe book follows the student’s English language education with their dedicated and creative teacher, Mr. Williams. As they get a grasp of the languages, their individual histories unfold and add faces, names, and stories to those seeking asylum.\n\nAlso Featured on These Book Lists:\n\nBooks with Teenage Characters\n\nBooks Set in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming\n\nUplifting Books for Book Clubs\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n93% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nClass Mom is a light and entertaining novel about the life of a 40-something mom in a large suburb southwest of Kansas City. She also has two daughters in college, as well as a son in kindergarten.\n\nIf you’ve ever done a little eye-rolling when dealing with other parents at your child’s school, this is the book for you. Former rockstar groupie Jen is bamboozled into being the class mom for her daughter’s kindergarten class. Her emails recruiting other parent volunteers are full of the things you wish you could say, but hopefully wouldn’t.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nThis fun, irreverent book will make you laugh out loud as long as you don’t take it too seriously. If you’re not a fan of snark, sarcasm, or adult language, skip it.
