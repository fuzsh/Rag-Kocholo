The first six seasons are largely set in the fictitious seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, with the characters of Emma Swan and Regina Mills serving as the leads, while the seventh and final season takes place in a Seattle, Washington neighborhood called Hyperion Heights, with a new main narrative led by Mills, and Swan and Mills son, Henry Mills. The show borrows elements and characters from the Disney universe and popular Western literature, folklore, and fairy tales.\n\nOnce Upon a Time was created by Lost and Tron: Legacy writers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. A spin-off series, Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, consisting of 13 episodes which followed the titular character from Alice in Wonderland, premiered on October 10, 2013 and concluded on April 3, 2014.[2]\n\nSeries overview[]\n\nFor the first six seasons, the series originally took place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales and other stories that were transported to the real world town and robbed of their original memories by the Evil Queen Regina (Lana Parrilla) who used a powerful curse obtained from Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle). The residents of Storybrooke, where Regina is mayor, have lived an unchanging existence for 28 years, unaware of their own lack of aging. The town's only hope lies with a bail-bonds person named Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), who was transported from the Enchanted Forest to the real world via a magic tree as an infant before she could be cursed. As such, she is the only person who can break the curse and restore the characters' lost memories. She is aided by her son, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), with whom she was recently reunited after giving him up for adoption upon his birth, and his Once Upon a Time book of fairy tales that holds the key to breaking the curse. Henry is also the adopted son of Regina, providing a source of both conflict and common interest between the two women.\n\nIn the seventh season reboot, an adult Henry Mills (Andrew J. West), along with Regina, Wish Realm Captain Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) and Rumplestiltskin, are found years later in the Seattle neighborhood of Hyperion Heights, where characters from a different realm were brought under a new curse. Hoping to restore her family's memories, Lucy (Alison Fernandez) must convince her parents, Henry and Cinderella (Dania Ramirez), of the true nature of Hyperion Heights, in the midst of emerging dangers involving Lady Tremaine (Gabrielle Anwar), Mother Gothel (Emma Booth) and Dr. Facilier (Daniel Francis).\n\nEpisodes usually have one segment that details the characters' past lives that, when serialized, adds a piece to the puzzle about the characters and their connection to the events that preceded the curse and its consequences. The other, set in the present day, follows a similar pattern with a different outcome but also offers similar insights.\n\nSeason 1 (2011–12)[]\n\nSee also: Once Upon a Time (season 1)\n\nThe first season premiered on October 23, 2011. The Evil Queen interrupts the wedding of Snow White and Prince Charming to announce that she will cast a curse on everyone that will leave her with the only happy ending. As a result, the majority of the characters are transported to the town of Storybrooke, Maine, where they have been stripped of their original memories and identities as fairy tale characters. On her 28th birthday, Emma Swan, the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming, is brought to Storybrooke by her biological son Henry Mills in the hopes of breaking the curse cast by his adoptive mother, the Evil Queen Regina.\n\nSeason 2 (2012–13)[]\n\nSee also: Once Upon a Time (season 2)\n\nThe second season premiered on September 30, 2012.[3] Despite Emma having broken the curse, the characters are not returned to the fairy tale world, and must deal with their own dual identities. With the introduction of magic into Storybrooke by Mr. Gold, the fates of the two worlds become intertwined, and new threats emerge in the form of Captain Hook (Colin O'Donoghue), Regina's mother Cora (Barbara Hershey), also known as the Queen of Hearts, and sinister operatives from the real world with an agenda to destroy magic.\n\nSeason 3 (2013–14)[]\n\nSee also: Once Upon a Time (season 3)\n\nThe third season premiered on September 29, 2013. It was split into two volumes, with the first eleven episodes running from September to December 2013, and the later half from March to May 2014. In the first volume, the main characters travel to Neverland to rescue Henry, who has been kidnapped by Peter Pan (Robbie Kay) as part of a plan to obtain the \"Heart of the Truest Believer\" from him. Their increasing power struggle with Pan continues in Storybrooke, which ultimately results in the complete reversal of the original curse. All the characters are returned to their original worlds, leaving Emma and Henry to escape to New York City. In the second volume, the characters are mysteriously brought back to a recreated Storybrooke with their memories of the previous year removed, and the envious Wicked Witch of the West (Rebecca Mader) from the Land of Oz appears with a plan to change the past. Once again, Emma is needed to save her family.\n\nSeason 4 (2014–15)[]\n\nSee also: Once Upon a Time (season 4)\n\nThe fourth season premiered on September 28, 2014. It was also split into two volumes, with the first eleven episodes running from September to December 2014, and the later half from March to May 2015. A new storyline incorporating elements from Frozen was revealed when the time travel events of the previous season lead to the accidental arrival of Elsa (Georgina Haig) from the Enchanted Forest of the past to present-day Storybrooke. As she searches for her sister Anna (Elizabeth Lail) with the aid of the main characters, they encounter the Snow Queen (Elizabeth Mitchell).[4] Meanwhile, Regina seeks the Author of Henry's Once Upon a Time book so that she can finally have her happy ending. However, Mr. Gold, with the help of Cruella De Vil (Victoria Smurfit), Maleficent (Kristin Bauer van Straten), and Ursula (Merrin Dungey), has his own plan to rewrite the rules governing the fates of all heroes and villains. Henry and Emma race to restore reality and the truth before the twisted inversion becomes permanent. However, the price leads to the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nSeason 5 (2015–16)[]\n\nSee also: Once Upon a Time (season 5)\n\nThe fifth season was announced on May 7, 2015,[5] and premiered on September 27, 2015. It was once again split into two volumes with the first volume ran from September to December 2015, and the second volume from March to May 2016. The characters embark on a quest to Camelot to find the Sorcerer Merlin (Elliot Knight) in order to free Emma from the powers of an ancient darkness that threatens to destroy everything. To complicate matters, King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) is determined to forever alter the balance between light and darkness using the legendary Excalibur. As history and destiny collide, Hook's death makes Emma lead a rescue party to the Underworld in order to bring him back. During their mission, they encounter souls of those with unfinished business and must face Hades (Greg Germann). In an attempt to restore order to the chaos that has culminated, the characters' dangerous manipulations of magic lead to an exacerbation of the war between light and darkness, with the separation of Regina and her Evil Queen persona, as well as the arrival of Dr. Jekyll (Hank Harris) and Mr. Hyde (Sam Witwer).\n\nSeason 6 (2016–17)[]\n\nThe sixth season was announced on March 3, 2016, and premiered on September 25, 2016. The characters must defend Storybrooke from the combined threat of Mr. Hyde and an unleashed Evil Queen and the mysterious fate of saviors leads to Emma learning about Aladdin (Deniz Akdeniz).[6] The ongoing war between light and darkness ultimately leads to the arrival of the Black Fairy (Jaime Murray) as well as the final battle that was prophesied before the casting of the original curse.\n\nSeason 7 (2017–18)[]\n\nSee also: Once Upon a Time (season 7)\n\nIn May 2017, the series was renewed for a seventh and final season consisting of 22 episodes,[7] which marked a soft reboot.[8][9][10][11] Years later, Lucy (Alison Fernandez) arrives in the fictional neighborhood of Hyperion Heights in Seattle, Washington with her Once Upon a Time book to find her father Henry Mills (Andrew J. West) who is needed by his family.[12][13][14] Characters from the New Enchanted Forest[15] were brought to Hyperion Heights under a new curse and are caught in a rising conflict involving Cinderella (Dania Ramirez) and Lady Tremaine (Gabrielle Anwar) whose dangerous history with Mother Gothel (Emma Booth) is revealed as well as the agendas of Dr. Facilier (Daniel Francis). Two worlds collide when the arrival of Wish Realm Rumplestiltskin and Wish Henry Mills as they plot and culminates on every characters' happy endings by separating them in a separate realms into their own separate storybooks, leading to someone making the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nSee also: List of Once Upon a Time episodes\n\nList of Once Upon a Time episodes Once Upon a Time's first season received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics.

For us, this was as much about the character journeys and seeing what was ripped from them in coming to Storybrooke – going at it that way as opposed to making it the 'break-the-curse show.'\"[33]\n\nDespite the comparisons and similarities to Lost, the writers intend them to be very different shows.[32] To them, Lost concerned itself with redemption, while Once Upon a Time is about \"hope\".[34] Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof aids in the development of the series as a consultant, but has no official credit on the show. Kitsis and Horowitz have called him a \"godfather\" to the series.[35][36] To differentiate the storytelling from what the audience already knew, the writing staff decided to begin the pilot with the end of the typical Snow White fairytale.[33] Themes concerning family and motherhood were emphasized, in contrast to the focus on fatherhood in Lost. Kitsis and Horowitz sought to write strong female characters, rather than the classic damsel in distress. Horowitz stated their desire to approach each character the same way, asking themselves, \"How do we make these icons real, make them relatable?\"[32]\n\nThe pilot is meant to be the \"template of the series\".[31] Kitsis confirmed that every week will contain flashbacks between both worlds,[30] as they \"love the idea of going back and forth and informing what the character is missing in their life.\"[37] The writers' desire to present a \"mash up\" of many small characters can be seen in a scene of the pilot, in which there is a war council featuring Geppetto, Pinocchio, and Grumpy. Horowitz elaborated, \"One of the fun things for us coming up with these stories is thinking of ways these different characters can interact in ways they never have before.\"[32] Since then, the creators have added more elements, and given its ties to Disney, have managed to expand the universe to include more recent material, by throwing out hints that they might look ahead at incorporating characters from Brave and Frozen in future episodes, if they get the green light from Disney.[38] The Season 3 finale introduced Elsa in the final minutes of the episode.[39]\n\nThe general premise, importing the Snow White core characters into the \"real world\", was previously seen on ABC television in the short-lived 1980s comedy The Charmings. The show also has a similar premise to Bill Willingham's ten-year-old comic series Fables, to which ABC bought the rights in 2008 but never made it past planning stages. After Fables fans raised controversy over possible appropriation, the show writers initially denied a link, but later said they may have \"read a couple issues\" of the comic book but while the two concepts are \"in the same playground\", they are \"telling a different story.\"[37] Bill Willingham responded to the controversy in an interview, where he stated he did not feel the show was plagiarism and said: \"Maybe they did remember reading Fables back then, but didn't want to mention it because we've become a very litigious people.\"[37][40]\n\nCasting[]\n\nSecondary character casting director, Samuel Forsyth, started the casting process in 2010. Horowitz stated that everyone they initially wanted for roles in the series accepted their roles after being sent a script.[31][32] Ginnifer Goodwin was cast as Snow White / Mary Margaret Blanchard,[41] who appreciated that she would be playing a strong character that was fleshed out for the audience. Goodwin had stated in interviews that she would love to play Snow White, and called her acceptance of the role \"a no-brainer.\"[42] Both Kitsis and Horowitz are self-described big fans of Goodwin's previous series, Big Love, and wrote the part of Snow White with her in mind.[32] Josh Dallas, who portrays Prince Charming / David Nolan, was pleased the writers took \"some dramatic license\" with his character, believing the prince had become more real. He explained,\n\n\"Prince Charming just happens to be a name. He's still a man with the same emotions as any other man. He's a Prince, but he's a Prince of the people. He gets his hands dirty. He's got a kingdom to run. He has a family to protect. He has an epic, epic love for Snow White. He's like everybody else. He's human.\"[42]\n\nJennifer Morrison was hired for the part of Emma Swan.[43] The actress explained her character as someone who \"help[s] her son Henry whom she abandoned when he was a baby and who seems like he's a little bit emotionally dysfunctional\", but noted that Emma does not start out believing in the fairytale universe.[42] Ten-year-old Jared Gilmore, known for his work on Mad Men, took the role of her son, Henry.[43] The role of The Evil Queen/ Regina was given to Lana Parrilla.[44]\n\nThe role of Rumplestiltskin / Mr. Gold was given to Robert Carlyle,[45] after having been written with him in mind, though the writers initially thought he would not accept the part.[30] Horowitz recalled Carlyle's prison sequence, which was the actor's first day on the set as \"mind-blowing ... You could see Ginny actually jump, the first time he did that character. It was fantastic!\"[31] Jamie Dornan portrayed the Huntsman / Sheriff Graham[46] as a series regular before being killed off in the seventh episode,[47] while Eion Bailey was cast as Pinocchio / August Wayne Booth[46] in a recurring role,[48] starting in the show's ninth episode, \"True North\", where he was credited as \"Stranger\", he was promoted to series regular status for the fifteenth episode, \"Red-Handed\".[49] Raphael Sbarge portrayed Jiminy Cricket / Dr. Archie Hopper.[46]\n\nFor the second season, Meghan Ory and Emilie de Ravin were promoted to series regulars as Red Riding Hood / Ruby[50] and Belle / Lacey[51] respectively, while Bailey made guest appearances in two episodes after departing the series[52][53] and Sbarge joined the recurring cast.[54] Colin O'Donoghue was cast as Captain Killian \"Hook\" Jones,[55] and was upped to series regular for the fourteenth episode of the season.[56]\n\nFor the third season, Michael Raymond-James was promoted to a series regular as Neal Cassidy,[57] while Ory did not return as a series regular due to commitments to the TV series, Intelligence.[58]\n\nFor the fourth season, Michael Socha was brought onto the show as Will Scarlet / Knave of Hearts from the show's spin-off, Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,[59][60] while Raymond-James was dropped from the regular cast[61] when the writers decided to kill off his character.[61] Bailey returned in a recurring arc towards the end of the season after being absent from the show since the second season.[62]\n\nFor the fifth season, Rebecca Mader[27] and Sean Maguire[27] were announced to have been promoted to series regulars as Zelena / Wicked Witch of the West and Robin Hood respectively, while Socha was confirmed to not be returning as a series regular.[63] Ory also returned to the series in a recurring capacity after being absent since the third-season finale.[26]\n\nBefore the series was renewed for a seventh season, Jennifer Morrison announced that, if the series were to be renewed, she would not be returning as a series regular for that season but agreed to return for one episode to wrap up Emma Swan's storyline.[64] Later that week, actress Rebecca Mader announced that she would also be leaving the series after the sixth season wrapped. It was later announced that Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Jared S. Gilmore and Emilie de Ravin would also be leaving the show after the sixth season's finale aired. Along with departures, Andrew J. West and Alison Fernandez were announced to be joining the seventh season of the show as series regulars after guest starring in the previous season's finale. They will portray an older Henry Mills and his daughter Lucy respectively. In July 2017, actresses Dania Ramirez and Gabrielle Anwar were announced to be joining the cast of the seventh season as series regulars, playing new iterations of Cinderella and Lady Tremaine, respectively. In September 2017, Mekia Cox, who portrays Tiana, was promoted to a series regular.[65]\n\nFilming[]\n\nPrincipal photography for the series takes place in Vancouver, British Columbia.[66][67] Steveston Village in the adjacent city of Richmond doubles as Storybrooke for the series, with props and exterior sets disguising the existing businesses and buildings. During filming, all brightly colored objects (flowers, etc.) are hidden to reinforce the story village's spell-subdued character. Certain sets are additionally filmed in separate studios, including the interior of Mr. Gold's pawn shop and the clock tower, which are not found in Steveston.[68]\n\nSetting[]\n\nMain settings[]\n\nDuring the first six seasons, the Enchanted Forest and Storybrooke, Maine are the main settings of the series. The Enchanted Forest is a realm within Fairy Tale Land, but the actual spread and scope of the realm is not known. However, they are later united during the Ogre Wars, which played a part in the formation of the War Council that is formed by Prince Charming and served as the catalysts in the backstories involving Rumpelstiltskin and the Evil Queen. Several independent kingdoms are implied by an array of different rulers. Most of the stories detailed their earlier lives before ascension to power and being influenced by their mentors through their upbringings. Meanwhile, Storybrooke serves as an isolated town separated from the rest of the Land Without Magic, where the cursed inhabitants are trapped by various forces.\n\nDuring the seventh season, the New Enchanted Forest[15] is shown as the main setting, alongside with Hyperion Heights, Seattle. As a realm in New Fairy Tale Land, the New Enchanted Forest is divided into several independent kingdoms with different rulers. The inhabitants are in-conflict with each other, most notably between Lady Tremaine, Cinderella, Drizella, a resistance led by Tiana, and the Coven of the Eight led by Mother Gothel. Most flashbacks shown are involving events happened before the original curse and before the latest curse that brought everyone to Hyperion Heights, where unlike Storybrooke, its cursed inhabitants are living among ordinary people.\n\nExpanded settings[]\n\nThe show, including its spin-off, have explored beyond the main settings to numerous realms, each based on fairy tales, literature, and folklore.

In Canada it airs on CTV from October 23, 2011. It premiered on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom on April 1, 2012.[92] On December 17, 2013, it was confirmed that Channel 5 would not be picking the series up for the third season airing in the UK.[92] On March 14, 2015, Netflix picked up the show in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, subsequently showing all seasons and premiering each new episode on Wednesdays after their initial showing on Sundays on ABC.\n\nReception[]\n\nCritical response[]\n\nCritical response to the first season was generally positive. On Metacritic, it was given a score of 66 out of 100 with \"generally favorable reviews\".[93] E!'s Kristin dos Santos cited the show as one of the five new shows of the 2011–2012 season to watch.[94] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe gave the show a \"C+\" grade commenting\n\n\"From a pair of Lost producers, this is a love-or-hate proposition. The ambition is impressive, as it asks us to imagine Goodwin's Snow White and Parrilla's Evil Queen as moderns. But Morrison is a wooden lead, and the back stories – a random collection of fairy tales -- don't promise to surprise.\"[95]\n\nIn a review from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, TV critic Gail Pennington hailed it as one of the \"Most Promising Shows of The Fall\" and, unlike Gilbert, had high marks for Morrison.[96] USA Today's Robert Blanco placed the series on its top ten list, declaring that \"There's nothing else on the air quite like it.\"[97] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times preferred the series to another fairy-tale themed drama, Grimm, citing that the premise takes its time building up the charm and that the producer \"has that part nailed\". She also gave excellent reviews for Morrison's character: \"Her Emma is predictably cynical and prickly – fairy-tale princess, my Aunt Fanny – but she's sharp and lively enough to keep audiences begging for 'just a few more pages' before they go to bed.\"[98]\n\nSeveral feminist outlets were pleased with the show for its feminist twist on fairy tales. Avital Norman Nathman of Bitch stated that she liked the show for \"infusing a feminist sensibility\" into the stories.[99] Genie Leslie at Feministing commented that Emma was a \"badass\", that she liked how Emma was \"very adamant that women be able to make their own decisions about their lives and their children\", and how Emma was a \"well-rounded\" character who was \"feminine, but not 'girly'\".[100] Natalie Wilson from Ms. praised the show for a strong, \"kick-butt\" female lead, for including multiple strong women who take turns doing the saving with the men, for subverting the fetishization of true love, and for dealing with the idea of what makes a mother in a more nuanced fashion. Wilson went on to state of the lead: \"Her pursuit of a 'happy ending' is not about finding a man or going to a ball all gussied up, but about detective work, about building a relationship with her son Henry, and about seeking the 'truth' as to why time stands still in the corrupt Storybrooke world.\"[101]\n\nRatings[]\n\nThe first season premiered as the top-rated drama series.
