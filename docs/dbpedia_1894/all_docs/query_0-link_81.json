        "text": "For a second consecutive year on Deadline, here are complete series rankings for the 2010-11 season in adults 18-49 and total viewers. Several interesting tidbits from the lists: NBC and ABC may be smart for holding some of their biggest series for midseason next year – the highest-rated new series this past season were both midseason shows: NBC’ The Voice in adults 18-49 and ABC’s Body of Proof in total viewers. Overall, it was a weak year for freshman series as The Voice was the only new show in the Top 20 among adults 18-49, at No. 4. The highest-rated new scripted series was CBS’ Mike & Molly at No. 26. There were no new shows in the Top 10 most watched series, with 3 in the Top 20: Body of Proof (#14), Blue Bloods (#17) and The Voice (#20). The highest-rated series to get canceled: CBS’ $#*! My Dad Says. The lowest-rated scripted series to get renewed on the Big 4 networks: ABC’s Happy Endings. Also, canceled sci-fi dramas V and The Event both ranked higher than the one that was renewed, Fox’s Fringe. Canceled Fox freshman Breaking In did better than all 3 as well as renewed Raising Hope, 30 Rock and Parks & Recreation. NOTE: Glee‘s average (4.0/11 in 18-49) does not include the highly-rated post-Super Bowl episode. With it factored in, the dramedy averaged a 4.3/12, which would lift it to eighth place. Here are the listings (new series in bold).
