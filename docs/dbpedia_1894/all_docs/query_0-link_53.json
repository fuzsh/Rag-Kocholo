        "text": "ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF) receives reports from libraries, schools, and the media on attempts to ban books in communities across the country. We compile lists of challenged books in order to inform the public about censorship efforts that affect libraries and schools. This list includes the 100 most frequently challenged books of the decade 2010-2019.\n\nThe American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF) has been documenting attempts to ban books in libraries and schools since 1990. OIF compiled this list of the most banned and challenged books from 2010-2019 by reviewing both the public and confidential censorship reports it received.\n\nThis list draws attention to literary censorship but only provides a snapshot of book challenges. About 82-97% of challenges remain unreported, estimates OIF, which compared results from several independent studies of third-party FOIA requests documenting school and library book censorship with the information in its database.\n\nOIF offers direct support to communities to defend their right to access information. If you’re able, please consider a donation to OIF to ensure this important work continues.\n\nThe Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie\n\nCaptain Underpants (series) by Dav Pilkey\n\nThirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher\n\nLooking for Alaska by John Green\n\nGeorge by Alex Gino\n\nAnd Tango Makes Three by Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell\n\nDrama by Raina Telgemeier\n\nFifty Shades of Grey by E.
