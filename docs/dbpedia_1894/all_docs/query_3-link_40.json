        "text": "Quentin Tarantino has revealed that he will direct the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood spinoff series, Bounty Law, based on the fictional TV show within the Oscar-nominated movie. Speaking to Deadline, Tarantino shared his plans to break out the Western drama, originally starring Rick Dalton as gunslinger Jake Cahill, to create a limited series with five half-hour episodes, which he plans to direct.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\n\"As far as the Bounty Law shows, I want to do that, but it will take me a year and a half,\" he told the outlet. \"It got an introduction from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but I don't really consider it part of that movie even though it is. This is not about Rick Dalton playing Jake Cahill. It's about Jake Cahill.\"\n\nTarantino went on to discuss some of the influences behind the Bounty Law series that features in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, as he spoke about the classic Western TV shows that he watched to switch his mindset over to that genre.\n\n\"Where all this came from was, I ended up watching a bunch of Wanted, Dead or Alive, and The Rifleman, and Tales of Wells Fargo, these half-hour shows to get in the mindset of Bounty Law, the kind of show Rick was on,\" he said. \"I'd liked them before, but I got really into them. The concept of telling a dramatic story in half an hour. You watch and think, wow, there's a helluva lot of storytelling going on in 22 minutes. I thought, I wonder if I can do that? I ended up writing five half-hour episodes. So I'll do them, and I will direct all of them.\" In addition to Bounty Law, we can expect to see more footage from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood in the future, as Tarantino previously hinted that the full four-hour cut could be released \"maybe in a year's time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has been nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Original Screenplay, as well as Best Director. The comedy-drama was also a contributor to IGN's Most Epic Movie Moments of 2019. Adele Ankers is a Freelance Entertainment Journalist. You can reach her on Twitter."
