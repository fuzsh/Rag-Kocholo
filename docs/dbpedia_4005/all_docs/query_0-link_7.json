        "text": "I am in my 20th year of teaching, and my ninth year as Choir Director at Elkins High School in Fort Bend ISD. Previously, I worked at Angleton High School with Beth Casey, as Head Director at Columbia High School and West Brazos Junior High in Columbia-Brazoria ISD, and as Assistant Choir Director at Clements High School. Elkins choirs regularly earn Sweepstakes at UIL Concert and Sight Reading Evaluation, Outstanding in Class and Best in Festival, and the prestigious Performance of Distinction at the Celebration of Excellence. In 2023, the EHS Varsity Mixed Choir was a National Winner in the Foundation for Music Education's Mark of Excellence National Competition, and the Varsity Treble Choir was a Commended Winner in the same contest. My students have earned placements in the All-Region Choir, Area Choir, and TMEA All-State Choir. I completed the Bachelor of Music Education from Hardin-Simmons University under the tutelage of Dr. Loyd Hawthorne and the Masters of Music in Choral Conducting from Michigan State University under the instruction of Dr. David Rayl, Dr. Jonathan Reed, and Dr. Sandra Snow. My wife Michelle and I have been married for over 20 years, and we have 3 children."
