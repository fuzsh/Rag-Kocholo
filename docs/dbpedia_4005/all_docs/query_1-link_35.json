        "text": "by Colby Mayer (Furman University Education major)\n\nIt was not until I learned about critical comprehension while taking a class on young adult literature that I began to realize how many books were written with white children as the audience. While I believe that accurate portrayals of history are essential, I have discovered that many stories are left out. Reflecting on the Dear America series, which was widely popular when I was in elementary school, I now recognize limitations I had never noticed. The Dear America series and its multiple spin-offs have a combined 103 books, over 75% of which center white main characters. I was curious about how many of the Dear America books were about girls of color. What I found was disappointing, though not unexpected.\n\nOf the 43 books originally published as a part of this series, only 8 were written about girls of color and only 5 of those were written by women of color. The books about girls of color include:\n\n(Books written by women of color are marked with an asterisk).\n\n*A Picture of Freedom: The Diary of Clotee, a Slave Girl by Patricia C. McKissack\n\n*I Thought My Soul Would Rise and Fly: The Diary of Patsy, a Freed Girl by Joyce Hansen\n\nMy Heart Is on the Ground: The Diary of Nannie Little Rose, a Sioux Girl by Ann Rinaldi\n\nThe Girl Who Chased Away Sorrow: The Diary of Sarah Nita, a Navajo Girl by Ann Turner\n\n*Color Me Dark: The Diary of Nellie Lee Love, The Great Migration North by Patricia C. McKissack\n\nValley of the Moon: The Diary of Maria Rosalia de Milagros by Sherry Garland\n\n*Look to the Hills: The Diary of Lozette Moreau, a French Slave Girl by Patricia C. McKissack\n\n*With the Might of Angels: The Diary of Dawnie Rae Johnson by Andrea Davis Pinkney\n\nWhen selecting texts for the study of history we must strive to discover which stories have been left out of the dominant narrative. As we work to include those texts, we must also search for those written by authors whose voices reflect the culture and experience of those whose stories are missing.\n\nThe importance of “own voice” texts is illustrated by a close look at two controversial books from the Dear America series written by authors outside the culture represented:\n\n· My Heart Is on the Ground: The Diary of Nannie Little Rose, a Sioux Girl by Ann Rinaldi\n\n· The Girl Who Chased Away Sorrow: The Diary of Sarah Nita, a Navajo Girl by Ann Turner\n\nThese two books received pushback from Native American scholars who pointed out inaccuracies in the books.\n\nMy Heart is on the Ground: The Diary of Nannie Little Rose, a Sioux Girl presents an oversimplified and inaccurate account of the experiences of children taken from their families and forced into Native American boarding schools. On the cover Nannie Little Rose refers to herself as a Sioux girl, which is not how she would have identified. In fact, she would have self-identified by her band (Sicangu), location (Spotted Tail Agency), or a smaller family group (Smith, n.d.).\n\nFiction Posing As Truth: A Critical Review of Ann Rinaldi’s My Heart Is on the Ground: The diary of Nannie Little Rose, a Sioux Girl by Cynthia Smith\n\nWhat I found most alarming about this book are the “creative liberties” taken. In the author’s note, Rinaldi wrote about a visit to one of these boarding schools where she saw the burial ground. She reports that the names of the children who died while at the school “took on instant personalities” that she included in her book. Yet those children attended the school much later than the fictional Nannie Little Rose. Furthermore, Rinaldi paints the boarding schools in an almost positive light, by not showing the true horrors that took place there. There is no discussion of the coercion that many parents faced to send their children to these schools or the purpose of these schools to break the spirits of the children in attendance. This is particularly problematic when this book could be the first, and possibly only, introduction students have to the history of Native American boarding schools.\n\nA more accurate depiction of boarding schools can be seen in the book, When We Were Alone by David Robertson.\n\nBecause the story is simplified, it is an appropriate book to use to introduce boarding schools to younger children. While it does not “sugar-coat” the realities of the boarding schools, it also does not venture into the graphic brutalities Native American children experienced.\n\nOther recommended books include:\n\nI Am Not a Number by Dr. Jenny Kay Dupuis\n\nWhen I Was Eight by Christy Jordan-Fenton\n\nStolen Words by Melanie Florence\n\nFry Bread by Kevin Noble Maillard\n\nWe Are Still Here by Traci Sorrell\n\nThe Girl Who Chased Away Sorrow: The Diary of Sarah Nita, a Navajo Girl features the Long Walk from Fort Defiance to Fort Sumner in 1864 when Navajo families were forced out of their territories by the U.S. government. One issue is that a Navajo child is writing this story in a diary as her grandmother, Sarah Nita, tells it to her. This part of the story is quite confusing, as it would be considered disrespectful in Navajo storytelling for a child to write down the stories of their elders. In Navajo communities, elders tell stories to be learned, not to be written down, so it is unrealistic that an elder would ask a child to write down their story as they tell it. The book has other inaccuracies regarding Navajo culture, as well as historical inaccuracies. For example, the book shows the “kindness” of the soldiers throughout the Long Walk, which is historically inaccurate. Historical records reveal that soldiers beat, brutalized, raped, shot, and killed the Navajo. For greater detail I invite you to read the following article by Beverly Slapin who provides a more complete analysis/critique of the book.\n\n[Archived] Avoid The Girl Who Chased Away Sorrow, The Diary of Sarah Nita, a Navajo Girl by Beverly Slapin\n\nSlapin notes, “the notion seems to be that translating Native experiences into a European worldview and form– while pretending to be an indigenous worldview and form– is a good thing.” When a book is written from a perspective different than our own, we must analyze how that story is told and where the information is coming from to ensure accuracy and authenticity. We must always seek to critically analyze the media around us and teach students to do the same.\n\nThe following questions from “Critical Comprehension: Lessons for Guiding Students to Deeper Meaning” can be used to help unpack texts when reading critically.\n\nFor more information and lessons focused on critical comprehension, Katie and Lester’s new book titled “Critical Comprehension: Lessons for Guiding Students to Deeper Meaning” will be released in February 2023. The book features a chapter titled “Interrogating the Past and the Present” that aligns with the ideas in this blog post.\n\nIf we want to help students explore multiple perspectives and participate in critical conversations about what they read, we must ensure access to a variety of texts that can both validate students’ identities and stretch their thinking. For many students, the classroom library is the most immediate access to texts. Therefore, our classroom libraries must be inclusive of all voices and perspectives. Consider a cursory assessment of your book collection to identify gaps and areas of overrepresentation or misrepresentation as you make book selections for your classroom library.\n\nA book sorting activity is one way to begin that process. To get started pull a random sample of your library. We like to begin with 25 books. Sort the books into three stacks to examine gender:\n\nFemale main characters\n\nMale main characters\n\nNon-binary or characters whose identities are not defined\n\nPause and reflect: What do you notice? What surprises you? Does this identify a gap or an overrepresentation? Would this sample be representative of your entire collection?\n\nNext, within each stack make another sort. This time, examine how the main character is portrayed.\n\nIs the character portrayed in a stereotypical gender role (e.g. girls who love pink, fear bugs, play with dolls, etc./ boys who are rough and tumble, love the outdoors, explore nature, etc)?\n\nIs the character portrayed in a non-stereotypical gender role (girls who dislike dresses, climb trees, like to fish, etc./ boys who prefer dolls, like sparkly things, prefer music or art, etc.)?\n\nPause and reflect: What do you notice? What does this suggest for your library? Who is underrepresented?\n\nNow, take a look at each of these stacks.\n\nIn which stacks do you find characters of color?\n\nWhat percentage of boys are BIPOC?\n\nWhat percentage of girls are BIPOC?\n\nAre girls portrayed as strong, independent, self-reliant? If yes, what percentage of those girls are BIPOC?\n\nAre boys portrayed as artistic, sensitive, caring and nurturing, in touch with their emotions? If yes, what percentage of those boys are BIPOC?\n\nPause and reflect: What message does this sample of your collection send about gender representation? Does that message differ when examining the portrayal of BIPOC males or females or non-binary? What messages are being sent to readers about who is valued and honored and respected? Are there students who find no character with whom they identify? Does your collection suggest that one group is preferred or privileged? Does your collection marginalize any groups?\n\nNow that you have sorted the books in your first sample take a look at your stacks.\n\nWhich seem to be lacking?\n\nWhere do you find overrepresentation?\n\nWhat does it suggest to you about adding to your collection?\n\nWhat does it suggest that you look for as you examine the remainder of your collection?\n\nShare what you noticed with your students, then repeat the process with a second sampling of books, but this time invite your students to join in. Get them into groups of 4 or 5 and give each group 20-25 books to sort. Make a record of their noticings and reactions using this optional handout.\n\nWhen you’ve worked through this second sort have each group share their findings and offer examples from each stack. Compare the findings of each group and those from your first sort. Invite students to offer insights, raise questions, and make suggestions.\n\nBased on this information, invite your students to make predictions about what they would likely discover if they were to sort the entire classroom library. Then, if you are up for it, pull all the books into tubs in the middle of the room and invite students to do the sorts in groups. To make your findings more concrete, create a bar graph of books in stacks.\n\nWhen the sorts are complete make note of what this reveals about the classroom collection. Invite students to analyze the information and make charts to show the findings. Ask your students to point out the gaps discovered in your library and launch a search of titles that could fill the gaps. Explore resources to add books and prioritize titles to be added.\n\nNow pause and reflect with students. Brainstorm other types of information you want to explore about your collection. Consider what sorting you will need to do in order to discover that information and try it with a small sample of 25 books. For example, you may consider sorting books by setting (urban/rural, time of year, weather, time of day, inside/outside, time period, etc.) by language patterns (colloquial, regional dialect, etc.) socioeconomic conditions, and more. Consider what these sorts may reveal to you and your students.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nChecklist: 8 Steps for Creating a Diverse Book Collection from Lee & Low Books\n\nGuide for Selecting Anti-Bias Children’s Books\n\nFor recommended lists of thematic inclusive literature, check out Reading to Make a Difference: Using Literature to Help Students Speak Freely, Think Deeply, and Take Action by Lester Laminack and Katie Kelly\n\nBy guest blogger Meg Ackemann\n\nGrowing up, I was rarely exposed to stories featuring characters whose lives were very different from my own. I recall only a few stories that featured characters with exceptionalities. Those that did focused mostly on the exceptionality of the character and how they overcame obstacles in their lives, rather than their everyday joy and humanity. As a future educator, I have a responsibility to find and make available more inclusive stories including books featuring characters with exceptionalities so my students can become more knowledgeable, understanding, and equity-oriented citizens. This collection highlights stories of characters with varying abilities.\n\nEl Deafo by Cece Bell\n\nThis graphic novel is about a young girl who is coming to terms with being deaf and eventually embraces a positive outlook on life. As a child, Cece becomes sick with Meningitis causing her to lose her hearing ability. Afterward, she struggled to develop true friendships. She ultimately finds that she can use her hearing loss as a superpower rather than a disability. Cece becomes confident and stands up for herself. At the end of the story, she and her peers realize that she is more like them than different.\n\nGrowing up with hearing loss, there were no characters in books or in TV shows that I could relate to. In spring 2021, I participated in an El Deafo book club with a group of elementary students who live with hearing loss. The students related to Cece, and they admired the strong, kind, and funny main character. This story inspired these young children to be more confident as well. El Deafo highlights the hearing loss community and demonstrates how Cece, as well as other individuals with hearing loss, are really not much different than those who have full hearing.\n\nFreddie and the Fairy by Julia Donaldson\n\nThis book is about a young boy named Freddie and his encounters with a fairy who is hard of hearing. The fairy promises to grant Freddie some wishes but is unable to fulfill those wishes because she has difficulty hearing what Freddie is asking. She would almost get the request right but would substitute key letters in words, such as hearing ‘cat’ instead of ‘bat’. Freddie’s frustration with the fairy increases throughout the story until a magical Queen Fairy appears and shares three rules that people must follow when speaking to others so they can be understood:\n\n1. Do not mumble.\n\n2.Do not turn your head away.\n\n3. Do not cover your mouth.\n\nThese rules are helpful for young speakers and could be applied to any situation.\n\nThis book introduces young children to new ideas and offers concrete suggestions to have their voices heard and help them communicate more effectively with people with hearing loss.\n\nAs a child, I frequently did not hear things properly and tended to have experiences like those of the fairy. It was frustrating for me when I would ask my peers to repeat themselves and they would just yell what they had said again rather than enunciating so that I could understand. This book would have been a comfort to me and a guide for my friends.\n\nHello Goodbye Dog by Maria Gianferrari\n\nThis book is about Zara, a young girl who uses a wheelchair and has a service animal named Moose. Zara and Moose love to spend time together. But when Zara goes to school, Moose cannot handle being away from her, so he follows her. But dogs are not allowed at school and Moose gets sent home. Moose misses Zara so much that he makes his way to school again and again and is sent home each time. Although Zara is in a wheelchair and has a service animal, she is not defined by this exceptionality.\n\nTune it Out by Jamie Sumner\n\nLu, a young girl with a sensory processing disorder (SPD) lives with her mother in the back of a truck. Because of their nomadic life, Lu has missed almost a year of school. Lu’s mother is a waitress and Lu earns tips singing at open mic nights. When the police and social services discover how they are living, Lu is taken from her mother and forced to live with her aunt and uncle. She is enrolled in a new school and makes new friends. As she comes to terms with all the abrupt changes in her life, Lu learns how to accommodate her needs. Readers discover how Lu combats discomfort with loud sounds and physical touch. The author highlights Lu’s incredible ability to sing in such detail that you wish you could hear it yourself.\n\nRight Now, I am Fine by Daniela Owen and written by Gülce Baycik\n\nThis book features a child coping with the anxiety of living through the COVID pandemic and all of the uncertainty they face. The author offers breathing techniques and alternative behaviors for children to avoid sitting with worry. It does not diminish the feelings a child may face, but reminds the child that the problems are often out of their control and they are okay in that exact moment. Readers are reminded that anxiety is a normal feeling but does not need to be a constant state of being.\n\nI grew up as a very anxious person and I never knew how to deal with my anxieties. Being exposed to coping mechanisms and breathing strategies would have been very helpful.\n\nEmmanuel’s Dream by Laurie Ann Thompson\n\nEmmanuel’s Dream is a true story about a young boy in who was born in Ghana with a physical disability. He was unable to use one of his legs which left him unable to walk. With encouragement and assistance from his mother, he surprised everyone. At that time people did not have much respect or hope for people who were considered disabled, but Emmanuel persisted. He ended up breaking many stereotypes and becoming a role model for many people, including those with disabilities.\n\nA Different Little Doggy by Heather Whittaker\n\nThis is a story about Taz, a dog with disabilities. As the story progresses, Taz points out how her friends are all different, but happy. The book ends on a positive note that emphasizes that although they are all different, they are still happy and accepting of others.\n\nJust Ask! by Sonia Sotomayor\n\nThis beautifully illustrated book begins with the author, Supreme Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor sharing about her own experiences with being diagnosed with Diabetes as a child. The affirming story celebrates the many abilities and differences we have as human beings and features children with asthma, physical disability, hearing and vision impairment, dyslexia, autism, stuttering, Tourette’s syndrome, ADHD, nut allergies, and Down syndrome.\n\nFloat by Pixar\n\nThis is a short film about a father and his son who has special abilities. Although the father is fascinated by how his son is able to float, he is also embarrassed and hides his son from the world. He keeps him hidden in their home and will only take him outside if he is physically held down by rocks. One day they go to a park and the son escapes from his rocks and starts floating around the park. The father freaks out and yells at the son “Why can’t you be normal?” In that moment the father realized he was wrong, and that he should love his son for exactly who he is and appreciate every part of him and his abilities.\n\nBy guest blogger Valentina Gonzalez\n\nMy childhood home was not filled with bookshelves lined with books. I didn’t have a stack of books to read in my bedroom. Nor do I remember sitting on mama’s or tata’s (Serbian for dad) lap as we turned the pages of a book.\n\nBut what I do remember is cuddling up next to my tata before bedtime and listening anxiously as he told stories he remembered or even ones he made up. As an immigrant family from the former Yugoslavia, we brought little with us when we came to America. Books were heavy and did not make the journey. Storytelling, however, was a cherished time in our home. My favorite story was Hansel and Gretel.\n\nMy first formal introduction to English was as a kindergartener. I loved school. I soaked it up like a sponge and admired my teacher as if she were a queen. My favorite part of the day was when she read aloud to us. I loved watching as she melodically formed the words and gracefully turned pages.\n\nOne magical day as she read, I realized that the story she was reading to us in English was the bedtime story my dad told me at home in Serbian. It was Hansel and Gretel! The two people I adored more than anyone else knew the story I loved most and in two languages! I was in disbelief. Until that day, it always seemed to me that my homelife and language were completely separate from my school life and language and never the two shall meet. But that day they met! And it was magical.\n\nI have mixed emotions about this memory. It makes me sad because it was one of the only times that I felt as if a little part of my homelife and culture were allowed into the classroom. For years after that experience I struggled to connect with books. I rarely found myself in literature or read about my lived experiences. As an educator, this reminds me that children should not have to shed their identity, their language, literacy, and who they are at home when they come to school. On the other hand, the memory makes me happy because it reminds me that we can create great places in our classrooms that open students’ hearts and minds and builds joy for reading. We can help children feel seen, heard, and valued. We can embrace cultures and identities. We have the power to make an enormous impact on readers in our classrooms every day.\n\nBy the year 2025 it’s estimated that 1 in 4 students in the United States will be classified as English learners (ELs). That number is remarkable. ELs, or multilinguals (a more asset-based term) are the fastest growing population of students in our nation. And they bring many valuable attributes, lived experiences, and qualities that can be leveraged in our classrooms.\n\nOne of the greatest strengths we each have is our identities as unique humans (see Reading to Make a Difference CHAPTER 1 Discovering Our Own Identities). So how can we support multilingual children in our classrooms as readers?\n\nAs a teacher, I worked in a campus that served multilinguals that spoke over 20 different languages. Of course I could not speak all of them. But there were things I could do even though I did not serve in a bilingual program. The following are three practical suggestions for supporting multilingual readers in any classroom.\n\nPartner with parents, families, and caregivers. Parents are often a child’s first teacher and know their children best. They can provide us with valuable information about students’ lives, passions, strengths, etc. We can use this information to connect them with books they will love. Partnering will also help us to create a team for literacy and reading growth. On the other hand, we also have a lot to offer to parents, families, and caregivers. Through a partnership, we can:\n\nshare with them reading strategies,\n\nprovide books and resources, and\n\nhelp through literacy related challenges.\n\nEnsure that the books offered on shelves represent the students in the classroom. Rudine Sims Bishop calls this mirrors (1990). Recent studies on published children’s literature have shown that a great proportion of books offer main characters who are white and books featuring people of color are not only limited but often misrepresented or stereotyped. When I first learned about these studies, I didn’t think my own library shelves were out of proportion, but I was shocked when I took an audit. That audit prompted me to take action. Each time my district offered funds that I could use for books, I applied that money towards books that my students could connect with. It was important to me that the books were not solely for the ESL classroom. The goal was for the books to be in every classroom, accessible as read alouds and for students to enjoy on their own as independent reading. This is just a sampling of the books we purchased:\n\nTeam up with the campus library media specialist. Work together to build more inclusive multilingual book offerings to the campus library. The librarian I worked with used Follett Titlewave. We pulled up the top languages spoken on our campus and we began ordering the most popular books in multiple languages. Students that can read in multiple languages have unique linguistic capital. We can embrace and support biliterate children and their linguistic identities through providing books in the languages they read. They are future global leaders!\n\nWhen literacy (in all languages) is seen from an asset perspective, nurtured, and valued, all stakeholders benefit. I learned along the way to allow myself the autonomy to be flexible in teaching and learning and to let students lead. Centering instructional practices and all that I do around them changed how we learned, how much we learned, and how much joy we all had in learning.\n\nBy guest blogger Nawal Qarooni Casiano\n\nIn my family, love looks like an intricately cooked meal. Love looks like stew left to simmer on low, all day, so the turmeric and onions caramelize into a rich sauce. Love looks like bowl after bowl served atop long-grain basmati rice, with crispy tahdig from the bottom of the pot.\n\nWe overfeed. Like Bilal in Aisha Saeed’s gorgeous picture book about a little boy introducing his friends to daal, we must have patience to cook our Persian stews.\n\nNoushe-jan, my mother says.\n\nNoushe-jan, my Ameh says.\n\nNoushe-jan, I tell my children.\n\nThe aroma of fesenjan in the house means we’ve ground walnuts to a pulp and combined it with pomegranate molasses so it’s the perfect melange of sweet and sour. Persian stews are like fine wines; the longer they sit and simmer, the more delicious they become.\n\nAs educators, one way to share of ourselves and our students’ unique identities is by bringing alive stories of food: nourishing, layered, textured. Food is commensurate with love, in many cultures, but more than that, identity stories often rely on memories of food. When teachers and students storytell about food rituals in school spaces, we more readily build community, connectedness and understanding. We are able to cultivate empathy and compassion for all cultures and people.\n\nAs educators, every decision to include a story is an omission elsewhere. Writer Arundhati Roy once said, “There’s really no such thing as the ‘voiceless.’ There are only the deliberately silenced, or the preferably unheard.” Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop’s scholarship names the need for students to see themselves in texts (mirrors) while also learning about others (windows). When we consider both of these ideas, it becomes clear how critical text selection truly is.\n\nThe framework in Reading to Make a Difference provides lenses through which educators can select texts, ensure students make connections, reflect deeply, take action and co-construct next steps for future behaviors and understandings.\n\nBelow are several picture books that center culturally nourishing stories – ones that celebrate inclusivity and depict familial love. I included picture books, poetry, songs and video – purposefully multimodal – so students can interact with culturally nourishing stories in a variety of ways.\n\nIn Amy Wu and the Perfect Bao, by Kat Zhang, a little girl learns to love her bao-making skills. They’re not easy to make and they’re initially imperfect, but they’re delicious in any iteration, and readers quickly notice the familial closeness and special, comforting connections that arise as a result of crafting bao together. You can share the video for making bao with students too.\n\nIn the classroom, teachers might try using the following questions from Reading to Make a Difference to support student connections to text.\n\n■ When students have an opportunity to explore landscapes, neighborhoods, and dwellings unlike their own, how can I help them make connections to their own environment?\n\n■ When students meet characters that have experiences or family structures different from their own, how can I draw connections so that these don’t seem so different?\n\n■ When students read about new cultural ways of being and lifestyles, how will I connect these to what is familiar to them?\n\nBilal Cooks Daal by Aisha Saeed is about a little boy who shares with his friends the long process of making lentil stew, from selecting the ingredients to patiently playing outside while the flavors merge together. He worries briefly about his friends not liking it but those worries quickly give way to the final touches, adding naan, fresh ginger and cilantro to serve. This is a beautiful book about friendship, community, and celebrating new experiences.\n\nQuestions to support connection from Reading to Make a Difference:\n\n■ When students meet characters that face challenges and obstacles different from their own, how will I help them build on what they already know?\n\n■ When students are exposed to language and speech patterns that differ from their own, how will I help them find value in all language?\n\nI fell in love with Leila in Saffron by Rukhsanna Guidroz because of its enchanting descriptions of life in colors, smells and textures (“I see the color of lentils, bright and orange; pomegranates, juicy and rosy; cucumber skin, dark and green; and threads of saffron, gold and copper.”) The protagonist is Pakistani and her journey to know herself is deeply connected to the cultural wisdom of her grandmother. She uses all of her senses to absorb her family so powerfully, it feels like readers are witnessing the weaving of a gorgeous tapestry.\n\nTeachers and students can enjoy these stories across many days, stacking layering texts to facilitate conversation about varied cultures and nourishing traditions.\n\nFrom Reading to Make a Difference, classroom teachers might specifically think about the question ‘How will students make connections across texts to build their understanding of the issue?’\n\nEach of these picture books include recipes in the back, and often, nonfiction facts about the cultural background it came from. Teachers might ask students to write their own family food traditions, or create their own Flipgrid videos naming the steps of a special recipe. Students might draw pictures of their food stories or even record their family in the kitchen step-by-step. Happy food-related reading!\n\nFor a more comprehensive resource list of food stories click here.\n\nNawal Qarooni Casiano is an award-winning journalist and educator with experience in New York City and Chicago schools.

Almost immediately, the question arose for educators across the country: How do we approach this with students?\n\nIn my virtual fourth grade classroom, we held a candid and honest conversation about the events of the previous day. One student asked why Black Lives Matter protestors were treated so differently from these protestors. Other students shared their observations about how people with black or brown skin are treated in the United States.\n\nStudents recognized that the violence was wrong, and that it has no place in our democracy. But the question remained: How do we reconcile these protestors with peaceful protestors such as those during the Civil Rights Movement or the Women’s Liberation Movement?\n\nTo illustrate this distinction, we engaged in several activities over the next few days, including:\n\nRead alouds of books that depicted examples of peaceful protests, such as Freedom on the Menu: The Greensboro Sit-Ins by Carole Boston Weatherford, The Story of Ruby Bridges by Robert Coles, and Ron’s Big Mission by Rose Blue.\n\nResponding to and asking questions about the violence we had just witnessed. For example, one student wrote a letter to President Biden asking for him to initiate police reform and hold police officers accountable, while another student recorded a Flipgrid video explaining his mixed feelings about the Inauguration.\n\nWhen learning about the Constitution the following week, we read I Am Martin Luther King, Jr. by Brad Meltzer to better understand our right to peacefully protest under the First Amendment.\n\nIt is important to show students the power of nonviolent resistance beyond standalone read alouds during Black History Month or Indigenous Peoples’ Day. The Capitol Hill riot cannot be the reference point for students when they think about protesting for meaningful change. As educators, we must teach them the fundamentality of peaceful protests to our democracy, and the role they have played in cultivating reform in American history.\n\nThere is a significant contrast between the events of January 6th and protests of the past in the manner of, and the reasons for, protesting. As educators we must teach this intentionally and explicitly. Books are one of the most powerful platforms for having these difficult conversations at all grade levels.\n\nTexts about Peaceful Protests\n\nElementary\n\nThe Youngest Marcher: The Story of Audrey Faye Hendricks, a Young Civil Rights Activist by Cynthia Levinson\n\nThis biography tells the story of nine-year-old Audrey Faye Hendricks, who was enraged at the segregation laws in 1960s Alabama. The youngest known person to be arrested for protesting in the Civil Rights Movement, Audrey helps lead the cause of “filling the jails,” and makes her mark as a young pioneer of desegregation.\n\nRosa by Nikki Giovanni\n\nA common misconception is that Rosa Parks’s peaceful protest was a spur of the moment, impulsive decision, because she was tired from work and did not want to get up from her bus seat. This text takes the reader through the background of that protest, and to the greater Montgomery Bus Boycott that took place as a result. Through its powerful illustrations and in-depth look at Parks’s life in the context of the Civil Rights Movement, readers will understand just how significant a role she played in the fight for racial justice.\n\nBrave Girl: Clara and the Shirtwaist Makers’ Strike of 1909 by Michelle Markel\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a world in which children are forced to work rather than go to school, and are even employed over their parents. But that’s just what happened with Clara Lemlich, an immigrant from Ukraine in the early 1900s, who worked in a shirtwaist factory as a young child. Tired of not being fairly compensated or treated justly, Clara helps organize a massive walkout with her fellow female employees, resulting in changes to their salaries, working conditions, and treatment.\n\nSeparate Is Never Equal: Sylvia Mendez and Her Family’s Fight for Desegregation by Duncan Tonatiuh\n\nWinner of the Jane Addams Award and Pura Belpré Award, this picture book tells the often overlooked story of Sylvia Mendez who, despite being an American citizen, was prohibited from enrolling in her local elementary school in the early 1940s and was instead forced to enroll in the nearby Mexican school. Her family, confused and frustrated by the laws of segregation, launches a full petition and lawsuit to desegregate California schools. As one of the major court rulings leading up to the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954, the Mendez family’s fight helped integrate California schools and showed the power of a community rallying around a common cause.\n\nThe One and Only Ivan by Katherine Applegate\n\nBased on a remarkable true story, a gorilla named Ivan lives at the Exit 8 Big Top Mall and Video Arcade with his friends, an elephant named Stella and a stray dog named Bob. Ivan longs for a day when he can be free among his family. When a baby elephant named Ruby joins their group, Ivan realizes he must fight to help get her out of captivity. He does this the best way he knows how: through his art. The signs he makes, along with his drawings, draw attention to the mistreatment of the animals at the mall, and help free Ruby and Ivan.\n\nMiddle & Secondary\n\nA Good Kind of Trouble by Lisa Moore Ramee\n\nShay is a twelve-year-old girl who avoids trouble at all costs. But as a junior high schooler now, Shay has started to notice some new dynamics – with her family and with her friends. Her older sister, Hana, is active in Black Lives Matter, but many of Shay’s classmates don’t understand that movement. Shay is caught between wanting to fight for people who look like her, and wanting to just fit in at school and stay out of trouble. As she begins to learn more about the meaning of Black Lives Matter, Shay realizes that not all trouble is bad, and sometimes you have to break a few rules to see real change.\n\nInternment by Samira Ahmed\n\nSet in the near-future, the American President has passed several laws restricting the rights of Muslim Americans, and forcing them to live in an internment camp. Layla, a seventeen-year-old, along with her parents, are three of the citizens forced into this camp. Determined to break out, Layla forms an alliance with others in the camp and begins a revolution against the camp’s Director and the guards.\n\nLand of the Cranes by Aida Salazar\n\nBetita’s father loves telling her stories about her family’s journey to the United States from Mexico, and Betita loves using picture poems to illustrate her family’s plight. But after her father is deported back to Mexico, and Betita and her mother are taken into custody at an ICE detention center, she loses her passion for creating picture poems. She realizes, however, that her poetry is her greatest weapon in the fight against injustice, and uses it to draw attention to the inhumane treatment she receives in the detention center.\n\nAdditional Recommended Texts/Resources:\n\nEnough! 20 Protestors Who Changed America by Emily Easton\n\nHarvesting Hope: The Story of Cesar Chavez by Kathleen Krull\n\nMy Brother Martin: A Sister Remembers Growing up with the Rev.

Follow her on Twitter @tmoliveira17.\n\nGuest Blog Post by Ysaaca Axelrod, Denise Ives, & Rachel Weaver\n\nClimate change is not a new issue, however, over the past decade it has gained visibility and more and more people are concerned about climate change and its impact on our planet and our lives. Youth are becoming more vocal and involved in efforts to address climate change and many are the face of climate activism. One of the challenges of talking and teaching about climate change is that it is a complex topic that sometimes feels overwhelming because of the scientific complexity and the magnitude of the effects of climate change on our planet. However, while the science behind climate change is complex and constantly changing and evolving, it continues to affect the lives of every living creature on our planet. Yet, we are not all impacted equally.\n\nThe most marginalized and least-resourced communities on the planet suffer disproportionately from the changing climate’s devastating effects, making climate change not just a scientific matter but ultimately a social justice issue. As educators we believe that in spite of the magnitude of the topic, it is imperative that we talk to children about climate change and climate justice.\n\nSharing carefully selected books can create opportunities for learning and discussion. Books on climate change and climate justice can be found across several genres: non-fiction, fiction, and narrative nonfiction, and together can provide children with an understanding of the concept of climate change, the ways that different living creatures and people are impacted by these changes, as well as ideas for how we can all be engaged and work towards climate action.\n\nPasquet, J., & Arbona M. (Illustrator). (2017). My Wounded Island. (S.B. Watson, Trans.). Orca Book Publisher. (Original work published 2009) Narrative Fiction\n\nUsing the metaphor of a monster, the narrator, Imarvaluk, a young girl from Sarichef, one of the islands near the Arctic Circle, describes the changes to her island due to rising sea levels. The book describes shifts in their way of life due to climate change, and how they are losing their traditions as well as being forced to move because of environmental changes. This book can help to understand the concept of ‘climate refugees,’ people who are displaced due to climate changes, as well as a look at some of the populations around the world who are most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nWinter, J.

(Original work published 1992) Narrative Nonfiction\n\nThis particular book is particularly relevant to us, located in Massachusetts. It is important to read books that provide examples of how climate change impacts our local communities as well as those that are far away. In this book, the author, Lynne Cherry (who is also the author of The Great Kapok Tree: A Tale of the Amazon Rainforest), tells the true story of the Nashua River and the efforts to clean the river and restore and protect the water through local and legislative efforts. This story shows the ways that individuals, communities and policymakers can work together to enact change.\n\nGodsey, M., & Kellner, C. J. (Illustrator). (2018). Not For Me, Please! I Choose to Act Green. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. Narrative Nonfiction.\n\nIn this book, Luke, a little boy, talks about how he shifted from not caring about his actions and the environment to being aware of the consequences of his behaviors. It highlights how interconnected we all are, and how small changes on our part, can positively impact the planet and its inhabitants. The book provides concrete examples for children (and adults), how we can act green.\n\nThese are some of the books we have used with children and teachers in classrooms to help support the teaching and learning about climate change. Our hope is that together, we can work towards climate justice to save our planet for us and generations to come.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nEarthrise, a climate poem by Amanda Gorman\n\nBigelow, B., & Swinehart, T.

However, technology allows us to connect to engage in rich discussions and to deepen our thinking and our humanity.\n\nIt’s been a full year since COVID began and school as we knew it completely shifted to a fluid combination of online and face-to-face learning with masks, plexiglass shields and desks in isolated islands spaced six feet apart. Many headlines across media sources suggest learning loss and children falling further behind in reading. We reject this deficit view and instead acknowledge the innovating ways educators and children have engaged in meaningful learning experiences. By partnering preservice teachers in Katie’s literacy methods class with Alyssa Cameron’s fourth graders for virtual book clubs, we witnessed first hand the joy and growth that comes when readers have a space to connect and discuss their thinking. Even in the midst of one of the most difficult school years ever, there is much learning and thinking and growing happening albeit occurring in different ways and through different contexts BUT still present and strong nonetheless.\n\nChoosing Books and Establishing Book Clubs\n\nBecause we believe that all children should have opportunities to read books that matter to them, the partnership began with Alyssa providing a list of suggested chapter books based on her students’ interests, identities, and reading histories. The preservice teachers in Katie’s class then selected a book to read and created a book trailer for the fourth graders to view and then choose the book they were interested in reading.\n\nVirtual Book Clubs\n\nWith book clubs established, the preservice teachers and fourth graders connected at least twice a week for four weeks using Edmodo, Flipgrid, and Jamboard to discuss the self-designated chapters. They brainstormed ‘words to live by’ or a set of norms and expectations for participating in online book clubs and developed their own reading schedules to hold themselves accountable.\n\nFor the first post each week, Alyssa offered personalized, needs-based guiding questions to scaffold the discussions and modeled for the preservice teachers various types of open-ended questions to facilitate discussion. The first posts often pulled in supporting resources to deepen understanding of topics within the books: non-fiction articles, guest experts, parallel read alouds and video clips. The second post each week was more open-ended in nature with the fourth graders sharing their thinking and the preservice teachers responding with a ‘nurture and a nudge’. For example, when a student posted that “Nya (from the book A Long Walk to Water by Linda Sue Park) cares about her family because she goes and gets water for them,” the preservice responded as follows:\n\n“This is a very thoughtful observation in the text of the book of how Nya cares and takes care of her family. What questions or other thoughts do you have as to why Nya, being a child, has to do such hard work for her family?”\n\nSome groups created multimodal Jamboards with images and links to Google Earth to explore the settings and learn about geographical contexts for the books they read, while others conducted research to understand the cultural and historical contexts within their book. Students and preservice teachers alike were empowered to take control of their own learning directions and use their voices, openly and honestly.\n\nFor the culminating discussion, Katie and Alyssa surprised them with a synchronous gathering using Zoom. Before heading to book club breakout groups in Zoom to discuss their post-reading reactions to their books, they blew up the chat box with their excitement to see their reading buddies in real time.\n\n“Good morning book buddy!!!!!”\n\n“this is so fun”\n\n“This is a fun surprise for us!!”\n\nThe preservice teachers facilitated post-reading conversations using co-constructed thinking stems they brainstormed together using Jamboard. As the fourth graders met in breakout groups with their reading buddies in real time, Alyssa observed the pure joy and excitement filling her classroom. Every single child was engaged… talking, smiling, and participating fully in the book club conversations.\n\nBook clubs are for everyone! One student who is deaf signed her thoughts while her translator translated for her reading buddies in the Zoom breakout. Her college buddy from Katie’s class made this completely normal. When Alyssa popped into the breakout, she commented, “Hi Miss. Cameron, Right now Emma is talking and sharing her ideas.” Her entire group was glued to the screen, listening, nodding and ready to respond. Her voice mattered, just as much as everyone else’s even though we “heard” it in a different way.\n\n“Kids are often limited by what adults think they can do, especially in schools right now. And these book clubs proved so clearly that kids are ready to talk, ready to grow and able to have BIG conversations… reading DOES make a difference… and so will these humans – big and small!”\n\n-Alyssa Cameron, 4th grade teacher\n\nRead more about Alyssa Cameron’s work in chapter 5, Advocating for Change in Reading to Make a Difference.\n\nNext Tuesday, November 3, 2020 is the date for elections in the United States. According to a report from NPR “…Americans have already cast a record-breaking 66 million early ballots, putting the 2020 election on track for historic levels of voter turnout.” This is a significant shift compared with the low voter turnout in 2016 (only about 6 in 10 ballots cast).\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the upcoming presidential election (and whether or not we know the outcome on Wednesday) there will be feelings of angst and uncertainty across the country. Teachers and students certainly will not be immune from these feelings and concerns. Self-care and support for students is necessary regardless of the election results.\n\nWith relationships as the heartbeat of our work as educators, it is important that we reflect on how we might consider ways to sustain community and a sense of safety during the election. Teaching Tolerance offers four suggestions to prepare for teaching during the election. First, re-establish the values of inclusivity in your classroom. Second, reflect on your identities, positionality and feelings. Next, reaffirm our responsibility to engage these issues. Finally, have plans in place if things go wrong or students need support.

We have also included some resources at the end of the blog post to support your work as you guide students through the election (and beyond).\n\nVoting is a right and a powerful way to have a voice in the democratic system. Although Election Day was first observed in 1845, several groups remained excluded and were not given the right to vote until many years later. It took 75 years before women were granted the right to vote and one hundred and twenty years for the Voting Rights Act to be signed into law giving African Americans the right to vote.\n\nWe have curated a small collection of books as a reminder of the tremendous privilege it is to vote. These titles can introduce students to the history of voting and concepts such as the electoral process.\n\nThis recently released biography of vice presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris tells the story of a young daughter of immigrants who grows up to advocate for the rights of all. The reader is introduced to Kamala as a young girl and follow her story and her accomplishments through college and her career right up to being invited to be the vice presidential nominee.\n\nWhen Grace learns that the United States has not yet had a female president, she is inspired to become the first female president. Her teacher suggests an election at the school. Grace campaigns against Thomas, a fellow classmate. They each make compelling speeches and promises to their peers in an attempt to win votes. The election is a nail-biter and teaches the reader about the electoral college through the story. The author’s note in the back of the book provides additional helpful information about the electoral system.\n\nLife is hard on Farmer Brown’s farm. Duck did not like to do chores and questions why Farmer Brown is in charge. He decides to campaign to replace Farmer Brown. The animals registered to vote and cast their ballots resulting in a win for Duck. Duck soon realized that running a farm was hard work so he sets out to run for governor and won. However, he soon learned running a state was hard work. So Duck successfully ran for president. Yet, he quickly learned that being president was also hard work. He returned to the farm to write his autobiography. This text follows a predictable pattern and highlights the importance of conveying meaning in print as the animals who cannot communicate verbally beyond animal sounds rely on reading the signs to empower them to vote.\n\nBessie who is not allowed to go with her father and brothers on a hike because it is too strenuous for girls soon learns that there are many things girls are not allow to do in the late 1800’s. Bessie’s aunt, Mary McHenry Keith, introduces her to Susan B. Anthony and invites her to attend a rally in San Francisco for women’s rights. Inspired by the rally Bessie joins her mother and aunt in a march led by Susan B. Anthony. Though the 1896 campaign did not result in the right for women to vote Bessie and her family were undaunted and continued their efforts. The author’s note reveals this story is based on a real girl named Bessie Keith Pond. In addition there is a profile of Susan B. Anthony, a timeline of progress toward women’s right to vote from 1787 through 1920 when the 19th Amendment was ratified. The book also includes a list of further resources for young readers.\n\nIn April 1916, Nell Richardson and Alice Burke set off in a little yellow car to drive around America. Their journey took them “ten thousand bumpy, muddy, unmapped miles–facing danger and adventure all alone…” Their mission was to rally for women’s rights. Their rallying cry, “Votes for women!” was heard across the country. In September, 1916, the two women returned to New York City. They traveled through a blizzard, mud and flooded creeks, across the desert, through small towns and cities to inspire support for women’s rights. There are three pages of detailed background on the time period, the newness of the automobile and the fascination generated by the little yellow car, and the long struggle to win the right for women to vote in America. There is also a list of resources for further reading.\n\nThembi stays with her one-hundred-year-old Gogo (grandmother) after school until her parents are able to leave work. Although Gogo is very old and rarely leaves the house anymore she has vowed to go to the polls to vote in the April 1994 election. Thembi asks her Gogo why it is so important and Gogo explains, “Thembi, black people in South Africa have fought for many years for the right to vote? This is the first time we have had a chance to vote for our own leaders, and it might be my last…” Finally arrangements are made to get Gogo to the polls and she casts her ballot in the election that seated Nelson Mandela as president of the country.\n\nYoung Simms and his family live in Lamar County and the upcoming election will be the first one African-Americans have been allowed to vote. Each week Papa makes his mark, an X, at the general store when he and Simms pick up their order. Simms wishes his father could sign his name rather than making his mark on documents. Papa sits at the table by candlelight and tries to write his name, “This writing looks like chicken scratch…When I vote…I’m going to write my name to get my ballot.” Before leaving for school the next morning Simms writes his Papa’s name on a piece of paper and leaves it on the table. Papa tries and finally asks for Simms help. Slowly Papa learns to make the letters in his name. On the morning of voting day Papa and a wagon load of men from the community ride into town and Papa proudly signed his name to receive his first ballot.\n\nLillian walks uphill towards a voting booth. She recalls relatives being sold on the auction block. As she progresses in her walk, Lillian recounts how her great-grandpa was unable to vote because of a poll tax and her Uncle Levi was turned away from voting after being asked such ridiculous questions as “How many bubbles are in a bar of soap?” After the 19th Amendment is passed, Lillian remembers being chased away by an angry mob after her mother attempts to vote. She details the marches, the beatings, and the tenacity of those who fought for her right to vote. She votes. She has to. It is her right, her duty, her honor as an American.\n\n*Many of these texts including Lillian’s Right to Vote could be used through high school as a catalyst for discussion on the Voting Rights Act of 1965, voter ID laws, and the 13th, 15th, and 19th Amendments.\n\nSuggested Follow-up Activities\n\nBrainstorm reasons why people should vote. Then work in groups to create posters, public service announcements, speeches, etc. to encourage registered voters to get out and vote.\n\nResearch the Voter ID Laws. Are these “laws” legal? Why or why not? Encourage students to write opinion pieces and engage in debate.\n\nWhy do we vote in America? Is it important? Interview up to three people (family members, community members, friends) to ask why it is important that we vote and whether or not they plan to vote in the midterm election and why.\n\nCreate a poster, timeline, or infographic detailing the Amendments that led up to our rights to vote. Why is it important (or not) that we vote today? (see the Timeline tool from Read Write Think)\n\nWe invite you to share some of your favorite books and resources about voting and teaching during the election. We will compile a list on the blog. Email us at katie.kelly@furman.edu or lesterlaminack@gmail.com or leave your thoughts and additions in the comments box. Also, please check in on yourself, your loved ones, and your students in the upcoming days and beyond.\n\nSending you peace and love,\n\nKatie and Lester\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nAfter the Election: A To-Do List\n\nTeaching in Response to the Election\n\nVoting and Voices from Teaching Tolerance\n\nVoting! What’s It All About? Lesson from Read Write Think\n\nMany cities and states in the U.S. have renamed Columbus Day (celebrated on the second Monday in October) as Indigenous Peoples’ Day and many places have made decisions to remove statues of Columbus. The city of Columbus, Ohio (named after Christopher Columbus) will no longer observe Columbus Day as a holiday and plans to remove a statue of Columbus from City Hall. The county will replace the holiday with Juneteenth, the celebration of the abolition of slavery.\n\nColumbus Day became a federal holiday in 1937 as a way to honor Christopher Columbus’s achievements. Yet, the dark side of Columbus and the inhumane effects of colonization were largely ignored. He did not stake claim to uninhabited land. Indigenous people living on the land when Columbus (and later other colonists) arrived were enslaved, tortured, and murdered. Indigenous Peoples’ Day recognizes that Native people are the first inhabitants of the Americas and is a call to reframe history.\n\nThe stories of Native people have been omitted or whitewashed in history books. The genocide of Native Americans and the forced removal from their land and stripping of their identities, culture, and language when sent to boarding schools is rarely discussed.\n\nAs educators, we make choices everyday. We decide what books to read with our students. We decide whose stories are honored and whose are ignored. We decide what to say and what not to say and how we say it. Sometimes our choices make us complicit in the perpetuation of institutional racism.\n\nSo what can we do? We can make intentional decisions to ensure all voices and stories are honored and celebrated. Begin by talking with students about Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Ask: “Do you know what is special about today?” Follow students lead and guide them through a discussion to determine what they already know about Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Invite them to share their own questions as a springboard for further inquiry.\n\nAs you engage in this work alongside your students, you may consider the following questions as a framework: Whose history has been told? Whose history has been silenced? ignored? or whitewashed? Who benefits as a result? How does that perpetuate inequities and injustice?\n\nCreate land acknowledgement statements such as the one created at Furman University where Katie teaches. We (Lester and Katie) both live on the ancestral homelands of the Cherokee people and Katie grew up on the land of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in Upstate New York (also known as the Iroquois, the name given by the French colonists and therefore pejorative). Do you know whose land you live on? Do you know whose land your school resides? We invite you to research and learn about the first people of your own land.\n\nYou might read the book Encounter by Jane Yolen and discuss how this counternarrative as told by a young Taino child disrupts the dominant story of Christopher Columbus. Or you might view this short video from Adam Ruins Everything.\n\nAdditionally, share stories about and written by Indigenous authors, or #OwnVoice texts with your students all year long. Integrate these books into your bookshelves and your regular read alouds. Here are a few recommendations to get you started:\n\nPicture Books:\n\nBooks for Upper Elementary and Middle Grades:\n\nPrairie Lotus by Linda Sue Park\n\nThis book tells the story of Hannah who moves with her father to the South Dakota prairie in 1880. She makes friends with the indigenous people who lived on the land long before the white settlers arrived. Seen as dangerous savages by most of the townspeople, Hannah befriends them and learns from them. This is an important detail that honors the native people who were negatively portrayed in the Laura Ingalls Wilder series that was the inspiration for Park’s book. This book could lead to conversations around land acknowledgement and students can research which Indigenous tribe first owned the land where their school and homes are located. For instance, we acknowledge that we live on the land once belonging to the Cherokee and the Catawba. Additionally, this book could be a springboard for conversations about marginalized perspectives during the westward expansion. *Note: This book is part of the 2020 Global Read Aloud.\n\nIndian No More by Charlene Willing McManis with Traci Sorell\n\nThis historical fiction novel is based on real events in the author’s life. It takes place during the 1950s on the Grand Ronde Tribe’s reservation. When the government passed the Indian Relocation Act of 1956 indigenous people were forced to move off reservations. They were told they would receive job training, transportation, a new home, and be assimilated. When faced with this situation, Regina and her family moved to Los Angeles and she becomes “Indian no more” and her life changes instantly. Her new neighborhood has more concrete than grass, new food, new friends, a larger school, and she and her new friends experience racism. Her grandmother (chich) helps her remember stories of her people and memories from the rez. *Note: This book is part of the 2020 Global Read Aloud.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nAn Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States for Young People by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz Adapted by Jean Mendoza and Debbie Reese\n\nThis highly informative book is a must read as you expand your own understanding and knowledge of history and is appropriate for middle grades and young adults.\n\nAmerican Indian’s in Children’s Literature blog\n\nNational Museum of the American Indian\n\nFive Ideas for Celebrating Indigenous Peoples’ Day from the Smithsonian\n\nPRIDE–”the quality or state of being proud…a reasonable or justifiable self-respect…” (Merriam Webster app)\n\nJune is designated as PRIDE month, a time when members of the LBGTQ+ community and our families and allies come together to celebrate our common humanity. It is a time to stand up with others, to remind the nation everything that makes any one of us human is present in each of us in the human family. It is a time to celebrate our successes and the continued struggle for equal rights for all people. It is also a time to remember and respect those who came before, especially those in the 1969 Stonewall uprising in Greenwich Village.\n\nPride, “a reasonable or justifiable self-respect” should be the birthright of every human being. Pride is our human birthright. Elizabeth, an openly gay preservice teacher shares her story and hopes to erase stigma about the LGBTQ+ community to make the classroom a safe space for teachers and students.\n\nMy name is Elizabeth. I am a 21-year-old education major in South Carolina. I came out the summer before college and was met with very mixed responses. I was terrified of being rejected by friends and extended family and how my sexuality would affect a future career in education. Of course, my close friends and parents continued to love me unconditionally, but valued church members took it upon themselves to fill me in on “the perverse direction my life was taking.” I was verbally abused face to face in the sanctuary of my church. Bigotry and hatred runs rampant in my hometown and these fears follow me every time I return. I also experienced more abuse online where people do not have to look me in the eye.\n\nIn the flurry of emotions I turned to literature to reassure me that my life is just different, not wrong. I discovered many books and resources including LGBTQIA+ families. Yet, many of the books claiming to support and cherish gay readers held messages of homophobia and hatred. A small number of children’s books portray happy LGBTQIA+ families and individuals, yet even fewer of them are included in school and classroom libraries. It is important for books written by authors like Lesléa Newman to be accessible in classrooms so children know at an early age that they can be exactly who they are without any fear or shame.\n\nMy story is not as harrowing as my some of my peers in the queer community, but my heartbreak is just as real. I will be a fantastic teacher because of my identity, not despite it. Being gay has taught me to be an advocate for myself and for all people, especially those who are marginalized. We as educators must present our students with a safe space, a space free of fear within our classroom walls, a space where they can learn how to be their most authentic selves. Especially in a world where it is slowly becoming easier to be proud of your identity, I will strive to cultivate my classroom community with love and respect, and pride.\n\nPerhaps what makes Elizabeth’s story so poignant is that it brings an issue out of the shadows and into the light. Her story helps us to recognize how powerful literature can be in the life of a young person. The idea that “the right book at the right time can open doors to possibility for a better world.” (Laminack and Kelly, 2019) is at the heart of her story. At the age of 21 she can name books from her youth that opened doors to self-respect, to pride in her own existence. Yet, her comment that many books she thought would be helpful actually “held messages of homophobia and hatred…” clearly makes the case that we need books that serve as mirrors, windows, and doors for our LBGTQ+ students. These books would also open the windows and doors to cisgender classmates as well.\n\nAccording to the book, Reading the Rainbow: LGBTQ-Inclusive Literacy Instruction in the Elementary Classroom, there are an estimated 6 million people with one or more LGBTQ+ parents (Gates, 2014) and at least 30,000 of these children are school age (Adams & Persinger, 2013). To create more inclusive classrooms, we can begin by avoiding heteronormative language and practices such as calling children ‘boys and girls’, referring to parents as ‘room moms’, or hosting events such as ‘donuts for dads’. In our book, Reading to Make a Difference: Using Literature to Help Students Think Deeply, Speak Freely, and Take Action, we share how Jennie Robinette transforms the traditional Q and U wedding in her kindergarten class by inviting any students to participate regardless of gender. In addition Jennie invited parents, including same-sex parents to come and tell the stories of their own weddings. This sent a message that anyone can be married and love each other. Students celebrated by creating “Love is love” signs.\n\nEntry points to becoming LGBTQ+ inclusive may include connecting with diverse families in your classroom and school community, responding to instances of taunting, teasing and full on bullying, and discussing current events and children’s literature (Ryan & Hermann-Wilmarth, 2018). For instance, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, children could read Rob Sanders new book, Stonewall: A Building. An Uprising. A Revolution. With last year being the fortieth anniversary of the gay pride flag, students could read Pride: The Story of Harvey Milk and the Rainbow Flag.

We believe that literature can serve as a window to learn about unfamiliar people, places, and experiences and can help to deepen the reader’s ability to value all humans. “According to Scholastic’s biennial Kids & Family Reading Report, 88 percent of parents believe that reading fiction and nonfiction is a good way for their kids to better understand the world and three out of four kids agree.”\n\nIn this month’s post, we invite guest blogger, Johnna Malici, principal and fifth grade language arts teacher at As-Sabeel Academy, an Islamic elementary and middle school in Greenville, South Carolina, to share why students need books with muslim characters.\n\nWhy Students Need Books with Muslim Characters\n\nAbout three years ago, our then sixth grade class was on a field trip to see a play at a local performing arts center along with hundreds of other students from neighboring schools. That day, as it turns out, would not be remembered as a fun outing with classmates. Instead, the students would be scarred by the memory of what it can mean to be part of a vilified minority group in America.\n\nBy the end of the school day, we learned all the details. It started even before the performance began. A group of students from another school began harassing our female students, who are identifiably Muslim by virtue of wearing the headscarf (hijab). “Are we gonna die today?” “Do you have bombs?” they taunted. Our students ignored the abuse, thinking it would stop if they didn’t respond. However, it only continued during the show when the harassers began pulling at our girls’ hijabs. Because teachers from both our school and the other school were seated at the other end of their respective rows, no adult was present to witness the abuse. Unsure of how to handle such a situation, our students told the teacher only upon returning to school, unable to hide their emotions as they described what had happened.\n\nI wish I could say that these kinds of experiences are rare in the American Muslim community. But unfortunately, they have become rather common. And, to be frank, this instance was rather benign compared with the abuse and violence that some Muslims are subjected to. To be a Muslim youth in America means to experience regular doses of micro-aggressions, at a minimum.\n\nYou may be wondering what this has to do with children’s books. In my mind, the connection is clear. In this climate of “fear of the other” on the one hand, and “fear to be myself” on the other, books are important. For non-Muslim students, books offer the possibility of “meeting” a Muslim. Upon meeting a character like Amina from Amina’s Voice by Hena Khan, for example, readers will relate to her struggle to overcome stage fright and to navigate middle school friendships. They will relate to her desire to want to blend in. They will experience the sadness and grief alongside her when her mosque is vandalized. In short, they will begin to see Amina as a human, and they will begin to empathize with her hopes and struggles. Through the book, the feared other becomes much less scary and a lot more like themselves.\n\nFor Muslim students, books can offer support, comfort, and validation. Imagine how rare an occasion it is for a Muslim student to “see” him or herself in a text. Though books featuring Muslim characters have definitely been increasing in recent years, they are still few in number. As a teacher or librarian, you have the power to choose a book that will validate the very students who, day in and day out, experience attacks (big and small) on their identity. Imagine how your Muslim student would feel when you choose to read aloud Wishtree by Katherine Applegate. My teacher chose a book about a character like me! Through Samar, the Muslim student will see that s/he is not alone; there are other Muslim kids out there who experience negativities at school and in their community. But s/he will also see that, just like Samar, there are friends ready to help, notably the teacher who chose to read this book.\n\nYes, books are important. But, teachers and librarians are important, too. How many school libraries offer books featuring Muslim characters? Even more importantly, how many teachers are choosing these books for read alouds and novel studies in their classrooms? How would that field trip three years ago have been different had those students “met” a Muslim previously? As educators, we have a critical role to play in creating a culture where marginalized students, be they Muslim, Latinx, African American (or of any other marginalized identity), feel they are a valued part of the society, and where majority students are compelled to understand and empathize with the other. Books can help us with this mission.\n\nFor more reading:\n\nParents, we need to teach our children about the dangers of hate-laced speech against Muslims by Hena Khan\n\nMore Muslim Characters in Books by Johnna Malici\n\nNewstreet, C., Sarker, A., & Shearer, R.

Red roses, heart-shaped cards for our loved ones, and sweet candy heart conversations. Hopefully we think about love all of the time. Love is what drives us and gets us through difficult times. Love surrounds us when we celebrate triumphs and joy in our lives. Love connects us and warms our hearts. In this post, we celebrate the love of reading and ways to cultivate a love of reading in the classroom to inspire readers of all ages.\n\nHow can we fall in love if we never meet? Access to the just right book can make all of the difference. We must fill our classroom libraries with books featuring diverse topics, genres, characters, and lived experiences. It’s also helpful to organize the books in some type of systematic way to help readers find and select a potential mate. Bins of books organized around favorite topics and authors rather than levels removes any shame associated with reading levels and matches what real readers do when shopping for books. Showcase favorite books through book talks and book shares and by propping them on display.\n\nSpeed dating with books (or book tastings for younger students) is a fun way to expose children to different books in a short amount of time. Have children sit down at a table featuring a selection of books. Give them approximately one minute to browse the front and back cover, read the inside jacket, and skim and scan the text and illustrations. Encourage them to consider which book they’d like to take on a second date. During the second date, they sit down and begin reading the text, getting to know it better.\n\nFinding ‘just right books’ is more than matching readers with a level. Compatibility is more than a score or a percentile ranking. Consider your true love. What attracted you? What kept you engaged? Learning what you find appealing can build a lifetime relationship with reading.\n\nIt’s ok to abandon books. If you begin reading a book and you are just “not feeling it” be honest, consider and reflect about why this is not working. That will help you recognize what you don’t like and will help you find a better mate in the future.\n\nBooks can evoke feelings, changes in our thinking and behavior, and spark us to take action in some way. When you fall in love at first sight, take a moment to reflect on why. Come to know yourself as a reader and learn to manage your selections for future reads.\n\nKatie tends to read fiction, historical fiction, memoir and nonfiction. Other than when Harry Potter and the Hunger Games series was popular, rarely did she read fantasy or dystopian novels. As she shares about the books she loves reading, she realized she rarely recommended fantasy or science fiction books. This is most likely because she personally doesn’t read those genres as often. We must be cautious when selecting books for our class libraries that we don’t fall into the trap of only including books that we love. We must also guard against “showing favoritism” for certain genres as we book talk new titles and promote new options for our students. Consider your students’ interests and build your classroom libraries so that a wide variety of genres are represented. Consider conducting an inventory of your library. How many books do you have that fall under different genres? Graphic novels, biography, fantasy, memoir, poetry, science fiction, etc.\n\nFalling in love with an author or illustrator or topic is one of the joys of being a reader. Help your students find their match with a spotlight on an author or an author study. Assembling a text set to explore topics of interest is an effective way to introduce a variety of authors, text formats, and genres connected to a topic of interest.\n\nAs a young reader Lester loved the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew. The beloved Boxcar Children series held an element of mystery that drew him in. He later read every Agatha Christie novel he could find in either the school library or the public library. Not every reader will be wooed by a good mystery, but for those who are lead them to series such as, Encyclopedia Brown, Nate The Great, and The Magic Treehouse.\n\nSometimes we meet characters in books that stay with us. We can’t shake them. Lily from Lily’s Purple Plastic Purse. India Opal from Because of Winn-Dixie. Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird. Henry, Jesse, Violet, and Benny from The Boxcar Children. Salva Dut from A Long Walk to Water. Ivan from The One and Only Ivan. Auggie from Wonder. Falling for a character gives us various ways for viewing challenges and obstacles in life.\n\nNonfiction offers readers the opportunity to delve into a topic and weigh information in a search for truth. As students become more facile as critical thinkers and readers they learn to question the texts they read and to search out various perspectives on an issue. As you collect titles for your classroom library consider offering a range of perspectives on the topics in your curriculum.\n\nReading aloud is an essential part of our reading instruction. As you plan for read aloud experiences do so with intention. Make your selections with the same care your give to choosing manipulative for a math lesson and the perfect Valentine’s card for a loved one. Think through the purpose of each read aloud experience and match the selection to the intention.\n\nCommunication is critical in relationships. While reading may seem like an isolated experience at least during the reading process, reading should be a social act. When we talk about what we are reading with others, we deepen our understanding, develop new perspectives, and form connections.\n\nGood books leave us wanting more. They move us. We laugh, we cry, we turn pages in suspense. We are changed by our time with them. Good books spark the love for reading and inspires us as lifelong readers.\n\nStudents from Anna Doyle’s class (@DoylesDivers) in Greenville, SC challenge us to share the love of reading using the hashtag #ForTheLoveOfReading.\n\nSome of Our Favorite Professional Resources to Cultivate the Love of Reading:\n\nBook Love by Penny Kittle\n\nThe Book Whisperer by Donalyn Miller\n\nThe Ultimate Read Aloud Resource by Lester Laminack\n\nConversations by Regie Routman\n\nReadicide by Kelly Gallagher\n\nNo More Reading for Junk: Best Practices for Motivating Readers by Barbara A. Marinak and Linda Gambrell\n\nPernille Ripp’s Blog https://pernillesripp.com/\n\nNerdy Book Club Blog https://nerdybookclub.wordpress.com/\n\nEach year around this time it seems that we all begin to examine ourselves, revisiting our lives over the past year, and pondering what’s possible in the new year. We reflect, make great plans, and proclaim our resolutions for the coming year. We are looking forward to the new year, 365 days of fresh pages. In this blog post, we revisit favorite books from the past year and focus our attention on books we plan to read (or reread) to enrich both our professional and personal lives. We aim to make 2019 a year of growth with a return to some of the texts that shaped our thinking and devote time to new texts that have captured our attention.\n\nEach of us has our own ways of finding new reads. Like many of you we return to favorite authors, look for new titles in a favorite genre, do the one-click purchase of a book just reviewed on NPR, or find ourselves standing at the checkout counter with books in hand just because we decided to step inside an independent bookstore–you know, just for a look around. Then there are friends we’ve come to trust about books and when they give a book a thumbs-up we find ourselves adding it to the lists we keep on GoodReads or in the back of our notebooks. We’ve come to trust recommendations by Penny Kittle, Colby Sharp, Donalyn Miller, Teri Lesene, Mr. Schu, Laura Robb, Kylene Beers, Mary Howard, Pernille Ripp, and Brian Kissel. Here are some of our favorites from 2018:\n\nLester’s 2018 favorites:\n\nJesmyn Ward Sing, Unburied, Sing (because Penny Kittle made me believe I’d be missing out if I didn’t. She was right. I could not stop reading.)\n\nJames Baldwin Go Tell it on the Mountain (because we need to revisit his voice and contributions.)\n\nS.E. Hinton The Outsiders (because my work is more focused on picture books this is one that I never read and needed to. I was moved to tears.)\n\nParker J. Palmer On the Brink of Everything (because I admire his contemplative life and writing. If you are of a “certain age” you will find this book filled with sage insights that will give you pause.)\n\nPhillip Hoose The Boys Who Challenged Hitler (Penny Kittle mentioned this book in several groups and each time I made note of it. I found the history behind this book fascinating and was compelled to read it. On a long flight I did the one-click thing and it appeared on my i-Pad. I read the flight away.)\n\nHarriet Ann Jacobs Incidents of a Slave Girl Written by Herself (I heard so much about this book from so many sources that I had to read it. Now I hope you will.)\n\nKylene Beers and Bob Probst Disrupting Thinking (because they are wicked smart and articulate. I read everything they write and I am never disappointed.)\n\nLori Duron Raising My Rainbow (because I think we need to hear more from the parents of LGBTQ children.)\n\nElizabeth Acevedo The Poet X (because it was on the tongue of everyone at NCTE 2018 and it was in the stack of books submitted for an awards committee I am serving on. It is a powerful story with some stunning lines.)\n\nMarcella Pixley Ready to Fall (because Marcella is an amazing MG ELA teacher, a most talented writer and weaver of story, and a dear friend.)\n\nBarbara O’Connor Wonderland (just because Barbara wrote it. Period. And I read Wish earlier in 2018. You’ll want to read it also.)\n\nNikki Grimes One Last Word (I’m on a mission to read everything she has written.)\n\nNikki Grimes Between the Lines\n\nNikki Grimes Garvey’s Choice\n\nNikki Grimes Words with Wings\n\nWiley Cash The Last Ballad (Southern fiction is one of my favorite genres and this one is rife with the history of organizing the unions at the textile mills of NC and SC. This is a true story of one white woman who lost her life in the effort to integrate the union.)\n\nAmy Hollingsworth The Simple Faith of Mister Rogers (because Fred Rogers is my hero. This is written in segments that make it easy to read it small moments. When you reach the end you’ll have a deeper understanding of the man, his faith, and the love and ministry behind his show.)\n\nKatie’s 2018 favorites:\n\nBryan Stevenson Just Mercy (This book was recommended by Penny Kittle when she spoke at Furman. This book opened my eyes to the broken justice system. In 2018, the author’s organization, the Equal Justice Initiative, opened the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama as a reminder of America’s history of racial inequality. I hope to be able to visit the memorial and museum in 2019.)\n\nChristina Baker Kline Orphan Train (I found this fascinating novel about an orphaned Irish immigrant child sent by train to live in the midwest while browsing in an airport. I loved the story so much I finished it by the time I arrived to my destination.)\n\nMariana Souto-Manning, Carmen Lugo Llerena, Jessica Martell, Abigail Salas-Maguire, Alicia Arce-Boardman No More Culturally Irrelevant Teaching (This short and easy to read book packs a powerful message for all educators. And Lester agrees.)\n\nTara Westover Educated (because it was on Obama’s reading list so I knew it would be good! I was not disappointed.)\n\nTrevor Noah Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood (This eye-opening and touching story of Trevor Noah’s childhood in South Africa brought me to tears and made me laugh.)\n\nSara Ahmed Being the Change: Lessons and Strategies to Teach Social Comprehension (because the topic of this book is connected to the theme of our new book also published by Heinemann and I love to learn from other educators. I later attended a packed session at NCTE led by Sara and her colleagues and left inspired and renewed to continue this important work focused on social justice and anti-bias teaching.)\n\nDavid Sedaris Me Talk Pretty One Day (Looking to add some humor into my otherwise mostly serious reading stack, Brian Kissel suggested I read anything by David Sedaris and he did not disappoint.)\n\nJacqueline Woodson Harbor Me (because I saw it on the shelf at M. Judson’s Bookstore in Greenville, SC and had to have it because I love everything written by this author.)\n\nNic Stone Dear Martin (Recommended by the ProjectLIT Community, this seemed like a good follow up to my 2017 favorite book, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas. Plus I had the honor of listening to Nic Stone speak when we both presented at NerdCampGA!)\n\nRobin DiAngelo White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism (Recommended by Travis Crowder, this book helps me as I continue to seek support of others as we work through difficult conversations related to race.)\n\nLester’s 2019 Book Stack:\n\nFrank Smith Essays into Literacy (because this collection of essays helped fine tune my thinking about literacy instruction.)\n\nRudine Sims Bishop Free Within Ourselves: The Development of African American Children’s Literature (because Rudine’s work was the first I read on the need for diverse books and I want to return to this title now with greater insight and appreciation.)\n\nRalph Fletcher What a Writer Needs (first edition) (Ralph has been a mentor and has become a friend. This is the one book on writing that I would hold onto if I could keep only one. I want to revisit all the notes I scribbled in the margins long ago and discover how my understanding has developed over time.)\n\nDon Holdaway The Foundations of Literacy (the influence of Holdaway upon my understandings of early literacy development and instruction was remarkable. Rereading him now would be refreshing)\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie Americanah (I was totally inspired by her keynote at NCTE 2018 in Houston.)\n\nCornelius Minor We Got This (well, first off, I just adore the guy. I’ve watched his work blossom since our first meeting at Teachers College in a summer institute years ago. And, well, everyone is reading this.)\n\nDonalyn Miller and Colby Sharp Game Changer! (because these two know books about as well as anyone I know and they are at the point of impact.)\n\nAnne Lamott Almost Everything (because I love her work.)\n\nMaxwell King The Good Neighbor: The Life and Work of Fred Rogers (because I so admire Mr. Rogers)\n\nMichelle Obama Becoming (because she is an admirable human being, a great First Lady, and it was recommended by Glenis Redmond.)\n\nHenri J. Nouwen The Way of the Heart (inspired by reading Amy Hollingsworth The Simple Faith of Mister Rogers.)\n\nKatie’s 2019 Book Stack:\n\nMichelle Obama Becoming (because I find her incredibly inspiring and miss seeing her as our First Lady.)\n\nCornelius Minor We Got This. (because Cornelius Minor is as authentic as they come and a true inspiration.)\n\nMatthew Kay Not Light, But Fire (recommended by Shawna Coppola in a Facebook Live video. Social media can be so powerful!)\n\nJoan Williams White Working Class (This book was recommended by Brian Kissel at NCTE during one of our late night chats about everything under the sun including how to make sense about what is happening in the current political landscape.)\n\nMichelle Alexander The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness (This book has been on my to-read list for awhile. After reading Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson, I was inspired to learn more about the role of race and the criminal justice system. It was also recommended by my dear friend, Lindsay Yearta.)\n\nEve L. Ewing Ghosts in the Schoolyard (recommended by Jacqueline Woodson on Twitter so duh, I must read it! Plus I watched the author’s interview on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah where she discusses the need to break down structural racism particularly in the context of the schools in Chicago’s south side.)\n\nZora Neale Hurston Barracoon: The Story of the “Last Black Cargo” (My mom gave me this book for Christmas. She thought I might like it since Michelle Obama was also reading it. A few days later, I saw Brian Kissel tweeted it as one of his top ten favorite reads of 2018.)\n\nSharon Draper Blended (As an educator, I like to stay current with the children’s books being published. This middle grade novel is a story of a young girl dealing with the complexities of a blended family. This book seems relatable for many children as the main character explores her racial identity and her place in the world and perhaps a way for other readers to expand their notion of identity and to empathize with others.)\n\nRinging in the New Year with Reading Resolutions\n\nNow you know which books left a great impression on us in 2018 and you know which titles have captured our attention for the next year of reading.
