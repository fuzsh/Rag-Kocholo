        "text": "Schools\n\nOhio\n\nHillsboro High School and Hudson High School both canceled productions of the play She Kills Monsters because of implications that one of the characters might be gay.\n\nShe Kills Monsters was written by Qui Nguyen and is set in Athens, Ohio, and tells the story of a young woman whose sister dies in a car crash. While attempting to learn more about her sister, she discovers the Dungeons & Dragons campaign she was playing in and that she may have been gay.\n\nAfter the play’s 2011 debut, it has become one of the most widely produced plays at high schools and on college campuses.\n\nHillsboro High School’s administrators shut down their production on October 21, less than a month before it was scheduled to premiere. The superintendent issued a statement proclaiming “the fall play has been canceled this year because [it] was not appropriate for our K-12 audience.”\n\nThe cancellation at Hillsboro came one week after pastor Jeff Lyle and some parents met with the play’s directors.\n\nJon Polstra, a graduate of Hillsboro High who had both a son and daughter in the play said it was inappropriate “for the school to have allowed that influence to cause them to make their decision to cancel the show.”\n\nStudents of Hudson High found out their production was canceled when they arrived for their first rehearsal on September 20. The play had been approved, auditions had occurred, and roles were already cast.\n\nFor months prior to the play’s cancellation, Hudson school board meetings were dominated by debates about critical race theory.\n\nAt the September 27 meeting of the Hudson Board of Education, resident Cara Wright attributed the play’s cancellation to the influence of this group, which she said “is disabling our community and our Board from creating a well-rounded experience for our children.”\n\n“By not running that play that exposes and thoughtfully delivers different experiences and perspectives, our children are being implicitly told that these different experiences don’t matter,” said Wright. “Our children deserve better than this.”\n\nHudson’s fall production was replaced with Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, a fictionalized account of the Salem Witch Trials which serves as an allegory for McCarthyism.\n\nReported in: Cleveland Scene, October 26, 2022; WKRC, October 22, 2021.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAt the November 2 board meeting of the Fort Mill School District, parent Ellen Abramo said three books at the school contained pornography and critical race theory: Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe, Lawn Boy by Jonathan Evison, and All Boys Aren’t Blue by George M. Johnson.\n\nOn November 3, Fort Mill School District superintendent James Epps Jr. instructed all three books be removed from all district libraries, despite a board-approved reconsideration policy requiring books to remain in circulation while under review.\n\nOn November 10, Governor Henry McMaster sent a letter to the South Carolina Department of Education calling for a “comprehensive investigation and a detailed explanation” of how inappropriate books with “obscene and pornographic depictions” entered school library collections.\n\nIn the letter, McMaster specifically cited the removal of Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe from the Fort Mill School District, which he claims “contains sexually explicit and pornographic depictions, which easily meet or exceed the statutory definition of obscenity.”\n\nMcMaster also sent a copy of the letter to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel under the belief that “it is likely illegal under South Carolina law” to have materials like Gender Queer “in our state’s public schools.”\n\nMcMaster’s letter precipitated a statewide spate of swift reviews and removals of school library material.\n\nAccording to State Department of Education Chief Communications Officer Ryan Brown, a statewide meeting of district superintendents was held during the week before McMaster sent his letters, alerting them to what was to come.\n\nBrown said that at the meeting, every superintendent was provided with the title of Kobabe’s memoir and the name of its publisher and told to review their library materials for “appropriateness.”\n\nOn November 11, Greenville County Schools (GCS) announced they would evaluate all illustrated novels in district libraries in accordance with McMaster’s letter.\n\nGCS director of media relations Tim Waller said the one copy of Gender Queer that was in the system was withdrawn from Riverside High School on the night of November 10 and was not approved for future purchase.\n\nAlso on November 11, the principal of Northwestern High School, under order of the school superintendent Tommy Schmolze, removed Gender Queer from the school library. The same day, the librarian for Rock Hill Schools was instructed not to purchase Lawn Boy by Jonathan Evison, which was on her order list.\n\nOn November 15, the Fort Mill School District announced the permanent removal of Gender Queer from all high school libraries.\n\nA district administrator checked Maia Kobabe’s Gender Queer: A Memoir out from a district library for review after learning McMaster had called it “pornographic.”\n\nA school district administrator for Lexington-Richland District Five checked Maia Kobabe’s Gender Queer: A Memoir out from a district library for review after learning McMaster had called it “pornographic.”\n\nOn January 24, parents raised concerns about additional books available at school libraries in Lexington-Richland District Five. Passages were read from Monday’s Not Coming by Tiffany Jackson and Grl2grl by Julie Ann Peters.\n\nWhile board members typically refrain from responding to public comments, in this instance, board chair Jan Hammond interjected, “I need to find out what teacher is assigning these books.”\n\nReported in: Greenville News, November 11, 2021; The Hill, November 12, 2021; NEWS19, January 25, 2022; The Island Packet, November 16, 2021; WMBF, November 11, 2021; WLTX, November 10, 2021.\n\nTexas\n\nOn November 19, the Texas State Board of Education Agency (SBOE) rejected all but one of the middle school health textbooks submitted for approval.\n\nThe inclusion of sections on sexual health; consent; LGBTQIA+ issues; and abortion were the reasons the overwhelming majority of textbooks were denied approval.\n\nThis decision comes not long after the announcement of initiatives from Governor Greg Abbott and state representative Matt Krause to remove books on sex education, abortion, and those with LGBTQIA+ themes, characters, or authors from school libraries. Democrats allege the decision is part of a larger effort to quell discussion around sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nGoodheart-Wilcox publishes the only book approved for use in Texas schools by the SBOE. Its approval came only after they removed references to HIV-prevention practices and to emphasize the effictiveness of abstinence in preventing pregnancy and sexually-transmitted infections above all other methods.\n\nGoodheart-Wilcox also changed every recommendation of talking to a doctor, school nurse, teacher, counselor, or other trusted adult to recommendations to talk to a parent. No mention of gender identity, sexual identity, or LGBTQIA+ individuals exists in the textbook. However, a section discouraging talking about “identity” with teachers and classmates was added.\n\nBoard member Rebecca Bell-Metereau advocated for the adoption of more accurate and inclusive textbooks, but her opinions ran contrary to the majority of the board.\n\n“The idea that mentioning anything to do with sex will harm our students is simply not validated by scientific research. The more students know about their bodies, the more likely they are to make wise decisions about their bodies,” said Bell-Metereau.\n\nIn Texas, parents must opt-in for their children to receive sex education in public schools. In 2020, the SBOE voted to allow teaching about birth control methods other than abstinence for the first time since 1997. Those rules went into effect in August 2022. This was the first slate of health textbooks considered under the new rules.\n\nAccording to Karen Rayne, a professor at the University of Texas who researches the success of sex education programs, decisions made by the SBOE impact education at a national level.\n\n“Textbook companies look to Texas to set their standards for the rest of the country because we are such a large textbook purchaser,” said Rayne.\n\n(See: Journal of Intellectual Freedom & Privacy, v.6 iss.4: For the Record: Texas).\n\nReported in: San Antonio Express-News, November 19, 2021; The New York Times, November 20, 2020.\n\nAnchorage, Alaska\n\nOn November 11, Anchorage School District superintendent Deena Bishop instructed that all copies of Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe should be removed from district school libraries after a complaint from resident Pete Brown.\n\nThere was one copy of the book in the district. According to Bishop, it was moved to the public library.\n\nBrown emailed a complaint to School Board President Margo Bellamy at the end of October. Bellamy forwarded the complaint to Bishop. A committee was formed to review the book. The review process was conducted between November 1 and 10.\n\nKobabe’s graphic memoir is a 2020 American Library Association Alex Award winner and a Stonewall Award Honoree. School Library Journal called it “a great resource for those who identify as nonbinary or asexual, as well as for those who know someone who identifies that way and wish to better understand.”\n\nSchool Library Journal recommended it for grades 9 and up and called it “a book to be savored rather than devoured, this memoir will resonate with teens. . . . It’s also a great resource for those who identify as nonbinary or asexual as wll as those who know someone who identifies that way and wish to better understand.”\n\nBishop said “the review process determined the book contained adult material,” and instructed that it be removed the day after the review concluded.\n\nBellamy said that she could not recall any other book being challenged in the Anchorage School District in the last 10 years. However, last year a reading list from the district’s Office of Equity and Compliance was removed from their website in response to a community member’s protests that it constituted critical race theory.\n\n(See: Journal of Intellectual Freedom & Privacy, v.6 iss.4: Censorship Dateline: Schools: Anchorage, Alaska).\n\nReported in: Anchorage Daily News, November 18, 2021; Must Read Alaska, November 13, 2021.\n\nSoldotna, Alaska\n\nOn October 16, Kenai Peninsula Education Association (KPEA) President Nathan Erfurth wrote that “a pattern of bullying and exclusion is developing in our school district.”\n\nErfurth’s comment was in response to five instances of “bullying and exclusion” targeting LGBTQIA+ students of the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District during the current school year.\n\nIncidents include the removal of pride flags from Homer High School, the recall of numerous LGBTQIA+ titles from the Seward High School library, and the principal of the Kalifornsky Beach Elementary School apologizing to parents after Flight of the Puffin was read to students in multiple classrooms.\n\nFlight of the Puffin is a children’s book about acceptance that includes non-gender-conforming characters.\n\nAssistant Superintendent Kari Dendurent recalled books ordered for Seward High School after receiving a forwarded email from a warehouse worker reporting “many LGBTQ books and a CRT [critical race theory] book that was received last week.” The email was forwarded on by Kevin Lyon, the district’s Planning and Operations Director.\n\nThe books Dendurent recalled from the school library were:\n\nBeing Jazz: My Life as a Transgender Teen by Jazz Jennings\n\nThe Gay Liberation Movement: Before and After Stonewall by Sean Heather K. McGraw\n\nEverything You Need to Know About Bisexuality by Greg Baldino\n\nI Am a Feminist: Claiming the F-Word in Turbulent Times by Monique Polak\n\nWe Are Not Yet Equal: Understanding Our Racial Divide by Carol Anderson\n\nGay-Straight Alliances: Networking with Other Teens and Allies by Kristina Lyn Heitkamp\n\nThe Road to Marriage Equality by John Mazurek\n\nThe New Queer Conscience by Adam Eli\n\nEverything You Need to Know About Nonbinary Gender Identities by Anita Louise McCormick\n\nLGBTQ: The Survival Guide for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Teens by Kelly Madrone\n\nDendurent asked the school secretary to “get the books back from students” if they were checked out. She also asked Follett for a refund for the titles, stating that they did not align with “our health curriculum and district policy.”\n\nKPEA alleges Dendurent violated two district policies when recalling the titles: the board’s policy governing handling of “Public Complaints Concerning Instructional Materials” and their administrative rule regarding “Challenges to Instructional Materials.”\n\nDistrict Superintendent Clayton Holland said that after two months in the district office, the books were returned to the library on October 11 after Soldotna High School Librarian Tamra Wear sent a letter to Holland, Dendurent, and members of the school board condemning Dendurent’s actions and calling for a “full disclosure” of the incident.\n\nReported in: Juneau Empire, November 1, 2021; KTOO, October 28, 2021.\n\nScottsdale, Arizona\n\nOn December 2, Paradise Valley Unified School District’s governing board voted to terminate the contract of Linda Ihnat, principal of Horizon High School, citing that Ihnat failed to follow procedure requiring her to inform parents about sensitive content in an optional book.\n\nSo You’ve Been Publicly Shamed by Jon Ronson was on last summer’s Advanced Placement English reading list. Ihnat was put on leave in November after parents complained of references to orgies and bestiality in the book.\n\nRonson is a Welsh journalist and his book focuses on the fallout from high-profile instances of shaming on social media, schadenfreude, and how shame functions as a form of social control. One section of the book quotes from a 2008 News of the World article about a “Nazi-style orgy in a torture dungeon.”\n\nOn November 16, Superintendent Troy Bales sent an apology letter to district parents in which he stated the book was not on a district-approved literature list and was not appropriate for high school-age readers.\n\nRonson’s book was withdrawn from the Horizon High School’s library.\n\nReported in: Associated Press, December 3, 2021; Channel 12 News, November 23, 2021.\n\nJonesboro, Arkansas\n\nOn October 15, the Craighead County Jonesboro Public Library announced that it would be moving several titles from the children’s section to the parents and teachers section of the library.\n\nLibrary director David Eckert said this section “contains education resources for caregivers to help with school work, learning disabilities, and those who homeschool their children.”\n\nThe titles moved were primarily sex education materials written for children ages 3 through 8. Understanding Gender Dysphoria, a book intended for middle school-aged children, was also moved.\n\nIn a related turn of events, on November 8, the Craighead County Jonesboro Public Library board voted 4 to 2 against a proposal that would have required the library director to receive board approval for the purchase of any “sensitive material.” This was the third time since August that the board has voted on this issue. The Sensitive Materials Subcommittee also voted against recommending the change on November 1.\n\nFormer library board member Amanda Escue, who initially proposed the policy before resigning from the board, said “I don’t know what makes y’all think that this is going away because you voted against [it].”\n\nFollowing controversy around the a Pride Month display the library put up, “sensitive materials” is the term the library board has used to refer to books pertaining to sex educatoin or which have LGBTQIA+ characters, themes, or authors.\n\nOn November 11, Eckert announced his resignation, effective January 1, 2022.\n\nThese are the books relocated from the children’s section to the parents and teachers section:\n\nYou Be You!

One of them has a child in the school, two have children in middle schools in the district. According to superintendent Jody Wiggins, the book has not circulated since 2016, so it was never checked out by one of their children.\n\nA committee was convened on December 17 to hear the parents’ complaints and consider the book in its entirety. They determined that the book met the school’s criteria and submitted a report recommending that it be retained in the library.\n\nThe parents appealed this decision to the school board, ultimately resulting in its withdrawal from the collection.\n\nBoard member Misti Stephens argued that the book was professionally done and that the excerpts the parents took issue with were not graphic.\n\n“School is about getting different points of view, different perspectives, so that the kids will think through some of the things they have concerns and issues with,” Stephens said. “We know there are kids dealing with these issues, so I believe they should have access to [this book].”\n\nStephens also pointed out that the book’s presence on a library shelf does not indicate that the school’s administration agrees with the views expressed in it.\n\nStephens and Board Vice President Audra Farrell voted to retain the book. Grant Loyd, Brian Lamb, and Travis Jackson voted to withdraw it from the school library.\n\nReported in: Siloam Springs Herald Leader, January 9, 2022.\n\nShelton, Connecticut\n\nAt their December 15 board meeting, Amy Romano, a member of the Shelton Board of Education, called on her fellow board members to review The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls, which she considers inappropriate for ninth grade students.\n\nWalls’s memoir recounts the poverty, hunger, and abuse she experienced while coming-of-age in a deeply dysfunctional yet loving family. It spent more than eight years on the New York Times bestseller list, was nominated for the Lincoln Award, received the American Library Association (ALA)’s Alex Award as well as the Christopher Award, and was named an ALA Outstanding Books for the College Bound and Lifelong Learners.\n\nThe Glass Castle is required reading for freshmen enrolled in honors English at Shelton High School.\n\nAt the January 11 meeting of the board’s Teaching and Learning Committee, ten people submitted testimony, all in support of retaining the book as part of the curriculum.\n\nOne of them, high school student Florian Hurlbert, recalled reading the book as a freshman. “This book informs about poverty, abuse, constant moving, real challenges that people go through in this life that you may never know about just by looking at them or talking to them.”\n\nHurlbert said these issues need to be discussed, not removed from the curriculum.\n\n“The job of the BOE is to set policy,” Teaching and Learning Committee Chair Kate Kutash stated. “We trust our educational professionals to select and set required curriculum to carry out our policies.”\n\nKutash cited several portions of the board’s policy book indicating that the board has no control over district curriculum. She said setting curriculum and banning books are “not within our governance.”\n\nSuperintendent Ken Saranich said Romano would have to adhere to the district’s reconsideration policy as a parent if she wanted them to entertain removing the book from the curriculum, instead of attempting to use her position on the board to exert undue influence.\n\n“The micromanaging of curriculums, while both students and teachers are living through one of the hardest times in history, is hard for me to wrap my head around,” read a statement from the Shelton Education Association. “My colleagues and I have spent years in our education . . . to become professionals in the classroom. I ask that you respect this and our judgment when it comes to what is put forward to our student body.”\n\nReported in: Shelton Herald, December 18, 2022, and January 14, 2022.\n\nFlagler, Florida\n\nOn November 9, Flagler County School (FCS) Board member Jill Woolbright filed a criminal complaint that All Boys Aren’t Blue by George M. Johnson was available from the Palm Coast High School, Matanzas High School, and Buddy Taylor Middle School libraries.\n\nWoolbright met with superintendent Cathy Mittelstadt and school board attorney Kristy Gavin on November 3 to discuss the book. She filed her criminal complaint after they did not bring her concerns to the rest of the board.\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue is a memoir about Johnson’s experiences growing up as a queer Black man which Kirkus referred to as a “captivating merciful mirror for growing up Black and queer today.”\n\nPublishers Weekly called it “a balm and testimony to young readers as allies in the fight for equality” and said “in a publishing landscape in need of queer Black voices, readers who are sorting through similar concepts will be grateful to join him on the journey.”\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue received numerous accolades including being the American Library Association’s 2021 Rainbow List selection for Young Adult Nonfiction, one of the Young Adult Library Services Association 2021 Teens’ Top 10, one of the 2019 Outstanding Books for the College Bound, and a selection for the Goodreads Choice Award.\n\nWoolbright told the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office that “It’s a crime to have [that] book in the media centers.” Her complaint cited state statute chapter 1006.40 requiring school materials to be “free of pornography” and 847, which prohibits distribution of obscene materials to minors.\n\nIn Woolbright’s criminal complaint, she notes that she did not read the whole book. “I don’t think it matters what the whole story is if those parts are, under our state statute, obscene.”\n\nWoolbright submitted the copy of All Boys Aren’t Blue she checked out from the Palm Coast High Library to a deputy as evidence.\n\n“My book is not what is doing your child harm,” said Johnson. “It is you who will do your child harm by not allowing them to one: learn that other people exist in this world who have a different lived experience than them and, two: not allowing them to have the language or this particular resource to deal with the problems that will come to them in this world when they arise.”\n\nThe Flagler County Sheriff’s Office agreed with Johnson and found that no employee of FCS had committed criminal wrongdoing by having All Boys Aren’t Blue in libraries or by circulating it to students.\n\nSheriff Rick Staly’s statement also said that “the determination of whether the book is appropriate for school libraries rests on the shoulders of the Flagler County School District leadership. This matter should have been addressed by the school board . . . before being submitted to the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office as a criminal complaint.”\n\nAt the November 16 meeting of the FCS board, 79 public comments spurred by the news of Woolbright’s criminal complaint dragged the meeting out to nearly six hours. Three additional titles were contested during the meeting: Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson; Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You by Jason Reynolds; and The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas.\n\nA small group of mostly student protestors formed outside the meeting to demonstrate against book-banning and defend the rights of LGBTQIA+ students.\n\nA counter-protest group also showed up carrying white power banners, Christian flags, and anti-LGBTQIA+ posters. They shouted obscenity-laden accusations of pedophilia at the protestors, alongside body shaming and other insults.\n\n“Initially the counter-protest, while ugly and rife with homophobic slurs, . . . was still just a counter-protest,” said a teacher who attended the protest. “As the night wore on, however, the counter-protestors were replaced by men and women dressed in flak jackets, walkie-talkies, and full face and head masks or helmets.”\n\n“The language was uglier, more intimidating,” said the teacher. “They kept shouting violently sexual threats toward a young man with a pride flag. As a result, it seemed less about a message against a book and more about intimidating those with whom they disagree.”\n\nOn December 2, the review committees submitted their reports to superintendent Mittelstadt. The committees determined that all four books were appropriate for use and should be retained in all libraries.\n\nOn December 7, Mittelstadt announced that All Boys Aren’t Blue would be removed from all district libraries, contrary to the review committee’s recommendation. Speak, Stamped, and The Hate U Give were retained.\n\nAt the January 18 school board meeting, a three-tiered structure introducing substantial parental restriction of students’ library access was announced. Tier one allows open access for students. Tier two gives parents the option to prohibit their children from accessing up to five titles they specify. Tier three only allows a student to check out titles that their parents have pre-approved.\n\nParents are required to have a meeting with administrators and school library media specialists before imposing tier two or tier three restrictions.\n\nAt the meeting it was also announced that All Boys Aren’t Blue would return to library shelves, now that parents had been provided additional tools to prevent their children from reading it.\n\nReported in: FlaglerLive, November 13, 2021, November 14, 2021, November 16, 2021, November 17, 2021, December 7, 2021, and January 18, 2022; WFLA, November 14, 2021; CNN, November 18, 2021; Yahoo!

Legislation strengthening and extending that prohibition has been championed by Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nThe books challenged by Moms for Liberty primarily consist of titles with LGBTQIA+ characters, themes, and authors; books with Black, Indigeonous, People of Color (BIPOC) characters and authors; and books about race and racism. A few sex education titles were also targeted.\n\nSuperintendent David Moore said that the challenged books were removed from circulation while undergoing review.\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue; Blankets: An Illustrated Novel; Triangles; Grl2grl; Deogratias: A Tale of Rwanda; and Gone Girl were withdrawn from all school district libraries.\n\nBefore any of the other books are returned, they’ll have to be approved by both the district’s library media center specialist and the school principal.\n\nThese are the titles challenged by Moms for Liberty at the Indian River County School District:\n\n#BlackLivesMatter: Protesting Racism by Rachael L.

The district did not follow their policies governing challenged materials.\n\nA couple with five children in the district complained about the book during the October 26 school board meeting. Alicia Farrant said, “There should be no pornography allowed in schools.”\n\nGender Queer is a nonbinary coming-of-age graphic novel. Kobabe wrote and illustrated it in part to explain what it means to be nonbinary and asexual. It received an Alex Award, a Stonewall Book Award, was nominated for an Ignatz Award, and was included on the Young Adult Library Services Association’s 2020 list of Great Graphic Novels for Teens.\n\nBefore the meeting, Farrant spoke with Jacob Engels, a far-right blogger, protege of Roger Stone, and associate of the Proud Boys. At the meeting Engels read from the book during the public comments section.\n\nThe book was part of the libraries of the Boone, Dr. Phillips, and Lake Buena Vista high schools. After the board meeting, Shari Bobinski, a spokesperson for the district, sent an email stating that “Leadership determined it is not appropriate for the targeted age group and have removed it from circulation.\n\nOn October 28, Boone principal Dusty Johns apologized to parents in a Facebook post.\n\nOn November 17, the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC) sent a letter to the board of Orange County Public Schools urging them to ensure that “all challenges are addressed pursuant to District regulations.”\n\nNCAC noted that by deviating from standard procedures, “the District raises the suspicion that the removal of the book was motivated by hostility to the book’s position on gender nonconformity,” which would be a First Amendment violation.\n\nReported in: National Coalition Against Censorship, November 17, 2021; Orlando Sentinel, November 3, 2021.\n\nPolk County, Florida\n\nPolk County Public Schools (PCPS) Regional Assistant Superintendent John Hill and several of his colleagues drove to every school in the district to remove every copy of books from a list of 19 titles identified in a complaint emailed by County Citizens Defending Freedom.\n\nThe conservative pressure group alleged the books were in violation of Florida Statute 847.012, dealing with distributing obscene or harmful materials to children.\n\nSuperintendent Frederick Heid sent an email to all middle and high school principals and media center librarians stating that “While it is not the role of my office to approve/evaluate instructional or resource materials . . . I do have an obligation to review any allegation that a crime is being or has been committed.”\n\nDistrict spokesperson Jason Geary said that the books were placed “in quarantine.” Geary said the books had not been banned, but rather “removed so a thorough, thoughtful review of their content can take place.”\n\nGeary said the process in place requires establishing a review committee of curriculum and literacy staff, media specialists, parents, and other community members and since copies of some of the titles were held at multiple locations, the review was being conducted at the district instead of the school level.\n\nStephanie Yocum, representing PCPS librarians, said they were alarmed by the book removal as books typically remain available during a challenge. Yocum also said that based on the titles targeted, the challenges seemed to be about oppressing minority voices.\n\n“If you don’t want to have your child read them, you can choose that. Out of one side of their mouth they want all this ‘parent choice,’” said Yocum. “But with this, they’re choosing for all kids, not just their own.”\n\nYocum said the books in question depict the mistreatment of people. She wondered if autobiographies about life during the Nazi occupation or in concentration camps would be next. “Is that the road we’re going down? It sounds like it.\n\nA timeline for the review process has not been disclosed.\n\nTitles challenged:\n\nThe Hate U Give by Angie Thomas\n\nTwo Boys Kissing by David Levithan\n\nThe Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini\n\nExtremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer\n\nThirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher\n\nVincent Boys by Abbi Glines\n\nIt’s Perfectly Normal by Robie Harris\n\nReal Live Boyfriends by E.

Johnson’s coming-of-age memoir All Boys Aren’t Blue from its libraries.\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue is a series of essays about Johnson’s experience growing up as a queer Black man. Publishers Weekly said the book’s “‘Be yourself’ message remains a radical stance for doubly marginalized individuals” and is “a balm and testimony to young readers as allies in the fight for equality.”\n\nKirkus named All Boys Aren’t Blue one of the best young adult biographies of 2020, it made the American Library Association’s “2021 Rainbow List Top 10 Titles for Teen Readers” and the Young Adult Library Services Association’s “2021 Teens’ Top Ten,” and was a nominee for the Goodreads Choice Award.\n\nJohnson said attempts to silence Black and queer voices were entirely too commonplace. “I knew it was going to rattle the nerves of people who have always suppressed strokes like mine.”\n\nThe book was removed from the school district after a group of parents complained to the school board about its existence.\n\nSpokesperson Laura Christmas said the decision was made after a review process and was “based on board policy and state statute.”\n\nClay County Education Association President Vicki Kidwell expressed concerns over the district’s decision and the emerging trend of censorship. “I think we owe it to our students to give them those viewpoints where they can see themselves,” Kidwell said. “Our librarians are tasked with resisting censorship.\n\nReported in: WCJT News, December 16, 2021; WPTV, November 16, 2021; Treasure Coast Palm, March 3, 2022.\n\nSt. Petersburg, Florida\n\nThe Pinellas County School District instructed high schools to withdraw Maia Kobabe’s Gender Queer: A Memoir from circulation at their libraries.\n\nThe district did not receive a formal complaint regarding the book and did not follow the procedures laid out in its “Controversial Material” policy when it removed the titles.\n\nKobabe’s graphic memoir is a 2020 American Library Association Alex Award winner and a Stonewall Award Honoree. School Library Journal called it “a great resource for those who identify as nonbinary or asexual, as well as for those who know someone who identifies that way and wish to better understand.”\n\nDistrict spokesperson Isabel Mascareñas said in a statement that the book was removed from the shelves of the Lakewood High School and the Dunedin High school libraries “due to the graphic illustrated sexual nature of some of the content.” She noted that it “is still available to district staff,” however.\n\nMascareñas said the district reviewed the book after hearing concerns about it from a parent. No formal request for reconsideration was ever received. The district’s integrated library system has the ability to prevent circulation of a title to a child upon parental request, however no explanation was given as to why that wasn’t done in this case.\n\nNora Pelizari, spokesperson for the National Coalition Against Censorship, said “When you pull a book off the library shelf, you’re dictating what other peoples’ kids are allowed to read. That can’t be allowed to happen.”\n\nMara Rish, editor-in-chief of Lakewood High’s student newspaper, Spartan News Network, said students were “really shocked” to learn the book had been withdrawn from circulation.\n\nPinellas School Board member Nicole Carr said the district had reviewed the “Controversial Material” policy with their media specialist the week before Gender Queer was withdrawn from circulation.\n\n“We do not want to get in the habit of banning books,” said Carr. “We want to make sure our process is well-defined, uniform, and consistently followed.”\n\nAccording to Lakewood High School media specialist Heather Robinson, that process was not followed in this case.\n\nPinellas Park High media specialist Ginger Brengle said, “I’m extremely disappointed in our district for not following the policy it just instructed us to use.”\n\nAngela Dubach, president of the Moms for Liberty Pinellas chapter, has questioned the availability of other books from district libraries, including All Boys Aren’t Blue.\n\nReported in: Tampa Bay Times, November 19, 2021; Spartan News Network, November 18, 2021.\n\nPost Falls, Idaho\n\nOn December 18, police arrested a man armed with a loaded handgun and a knife who allegedly trespassed on Hayden Library property while protesting Rainbow Squad, a program for LGBTQIA+ youth.\n\nRainbow Squad is a monthly Community Library Network (CLN) program for LGBTQIA+ youth and allies where attendees participate in crafts, games, and other activities. They also have sessions for parents, where they can meet other parents, ask questions, and support their children.\n\nCLN Director Amy Rodda said LGBTQIA+ topics aren’t generally discussed at the Rainbow Squad teen meetings. “These teens are in a supportive environment where they do crafts and games,” Rodda said. “It’s just teens being teens.”\n\nAt the November 20 meeting, attendees were met by a crowd of protestors holding anti-LGBTQIA+ signs. The protestors yelled at youth as they entered the library for Rainbow Squad.\n\n“There were some people who felt intimidated from entering the building [and] others left because they were feeling so terrible,” said North Idaho Pride Alliance Outreach Coordinator Jessica Mahuron, who attended the event. “For some, this is nothing new to them, so they stood strong.”\n\nMahuron believes the picketing stems from nonpartisan library trustee positions being filled by partisan candidates.\n\n“There was an individual who ran blatantly on a campaign wanting to remove Rainbow Squad . . . and also targeting books in the library,” said Mahuron. Once elected, this person began “rallying people to library board meetings to speak against programming or books.” (See: Journal for Intellectual Freedom and Privacy v.6, iss.2: Is it Legal?: Libraries)\n\nThe December meeting of Rainbow Squad was a private event held outside of the library’s operating hours. Advance registration was required to attend. A presence from the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office was requested at the meeting after Post Falls police were needed to prevent protesters at the November meeting from obstructing library use.\n\nThe protests were organized by Steven Hemming, a pastor at Family Worship Center in Hayden. Police said they “clearly conveyed” the restrictions against blocking the fire lane, parking lot access, and the entryway to Hemming in advance of the meeting.\n\nAccording to court documents, Thomas Meyer, 67, left the demarcated protest area and refused to return when instructed to by police. While he did eventually return to the designated area, he then left again and approached the library’s entrance. After refusing multiple orders from law enforcement, he was arrested for trespassing and obstructing officers.\n\nReported in: Coeur d’Alene/ Post Falls Press, December 1, 2021, and December 21, 2021; KREM, December 17, 2021.\n\nDowners Grove, Illinois\n\nOn November 15, members of the far-right neo-fascist group the Proud Boys attended a Downers Grove school board meeting to demand that Maia Kobabe’s memoir Gender Queer be banned from school libraries.\n\nBoth Edgar Delatorre, who participated in the January 6 insurrection and was caught on video pummeling a protestor at an Anti-Biden rally he organized, and Brain Kraemer, who was charged with brandishing a hunting knife in a threatening manner after driving into a crowd of people at a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Joliet, were in attendance at the school board meeting.\n\nMembers of the Proud Boys who attended held signs saying “No Porn” and jeered at board members, parents, and students.\n\nWhile 18-year-old senior Josiah Poynter addressed the board supporting Gender Queer’s place in the library, Kraemer shouted “You’re a pedophile. You promote pedophilia.” According to Poynter, Kraemer drove up to him in the parking lot after the meeting and again shouted “Pedophile” at him.\n\n“The last thing we need is some 30- or 40-year-old man who lives in the middle of nowhere to be calling . . . some kid a ‘pedophile,’” said Poynter. “That’s not OK.”\n\nLauren Pierret, a senior at Downers Grove North, said “it made me very uncomfortable” to have “men in the back yelling things out for no reason” while she and her friends addressed the board.\n\nTabitha Irvin, a Downers Grove North junior, said “It kind of fell apart after the board meeting.” She said she’s begun seeing students wearing Trump garb to class and starting arguments against the book.\n\n“Students are now getting caught up in the political controversy . . . and that’s exactly what fuels groups like the Proud Boys,” Irvin said. “We can’t stoop down to their level and engage with them, because it only strengthens them.”\n\nReported in: Chicago Sun-Times, November 21, 2021.\n\nLa Grange, Illinois\n\nAt both the November 15 and December 20 board meetings of the Lyons Township High School board of education, Laura Tussing read passages from the books All Boys Aren’t Blue and Monday’s Not Coming, which she described as “pornographic.”\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue is a series of essays about Johnson’s experience growing up as a queer Black man. Publishers Weekly said the book’s “‘Be yourself’ message remains a radical stance for doubly marginalized individuals” and is “a balm and testimony to young readers as allies in the fight for equality.”\n\nKirkus named All Boys Aren’t Blue one of the best young adult biographies of 2020, it made the American Library Association’s “2021 Rainbow List Top 10 Titles for Teen Readers” and the Young Adult Library Services Association’s (YALSA) “2021 Teens’ Top Ten,” and was a nominee for the Goodreads Choice Award.\n\nMonday’s Not Coming received the Coretta Scott King-John Steptoe Award for New Talent and was a School Library Journal “Best Book,” a 2019 YALSA Best Fiction for Young Adults “top ten” selection, and a Walter Dean Myers Award for Outstanding Children’s Literature Honor Book, among other accolades.\n\nJackson’s novel deals with issues of gentrification, race, poverty, mental illness, and cultural biases about the value of missing children. School Library Journal recommended it for grades 9 and up and called it “a spellbinding, profoundly moving choice for YA collections.”\n\nBoth books are available from the high school library and Monday’s Not Coming was on last year’s summer reading list.\n\n“Salty language. Is this what qualifies as quality literature today?” Tussing asked. She also stated that the books were “less than well-written.”\n\nLa Grange Trustee Beth Augustine gently pushed back against Tussing’s repeated calls for the books’ withdrawal from the two high school campus libraries.\n\n“I am concerned not that people have different opinions about literature, but [that] people think that banning books essentially is the way to go,” said Augustine. “While we all might not be comfortable with that content, where do we start or where do we end if we begin banning books again? There’s an internet full of things that our kids can easily get a handle on.”\n\nThe district’s library collection development policy has procedures covering the reconsideration of material. These require receipt of a written complaint form to initiate the process. Unless Tussing submits a formal request for reconsideration, a committee will not be formed to review the materials to which she has raised verbal objections.\n\nReported in: Patch, November 24, 2021, and December 23, 2021.\n\nOneida, Illinois\n\nOn November 15, after receiving parent complaints, the ROWVA District 208 Board of Education directed the principal to suspend teaching of Angie Thomas’s The Hate U Give. A freshman English class was halfway through reading it at the time. No date was set for when the temporary suspension would end.\n\nThe complaints about the book were that it contained strong language and portrayed police in a negative light.\n\nThe Hate U Give is a young adult novel narrated by a Black teenager who witnesses a White police officer shoot and kill an unarmed Black man during a traffic stop. It won the Michael L. Printz Award, the William C. Morris Award for best debut book for teens, and was a Coretta Scott King Book Award Honor Book.\n\nThe board’s decision to suspend teaching of The Hate U Give was made during a closed session which was not on the agenda. Following backlash against this maneuver, they opened up discussion of the book for public comment at their January board meeting.\n\nOn January 18, the ROWVA District 208 Board of Education announced that The Hate U Give would remain suspended from classrooms until it has been reviewed by a curriculum committee. However, it will continue to be available for circulation from the school library.\n\nBoard member Missie Shepherd cautioned that “I think as a board we’re walking a thin line between critiquing our teachers to the point where they feel that we don’t value their expertise.”\n\nDistrict Superintendent Joe Sornberger argued that the book should neither be banned nor suspended. “When you deny the author the right of free expression, you in turn deny everyone else the right to see a different perspective,” said Sornberger. He noted the district already has a policy in place allowing parents to opt their children out of reading assignments to which they object.\n\nBoard member Ryan West made a motion to remove The Hate U Give from the curriculum but retain it in the library. The motion died on the floor, failing to find a second.\n\nA motion was made by Matthew Johnson to postpone any further action on the book until the board has approved “the core values of the ROWVA school district,” a curriculum committee has been established, and the book has been reviewed by them. The motion carried 4-2, leaving the fate of the book indefinitely in limbo.\n\nReported in: WQAD8, January 19, 2022; The Register-Mail, January 19, 2022.\n\nMuncie, Indiana\n\nOn November 15, Muncie Central High School (MCS) students protested the school’s handling of student artwork related to police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of complaints from school resource officers.\n\nThe posters were created by students as part of a class assignment to reflect on Alan Moore’s graphic novel V for Vendetta and issues in America today. The posters were displayed outside of the classroom. The school resource officers complained that the posters negatively portrayed law enforcement.\n\nAll three of the school’s resource officers confronted Emma Martin, a Junior, about her poster, and got into a heated debate with her.\n\nSchool resource officers are members of law enforcement. They are armed with tasers and batons and have the authority to arrest school children.\n\nAccording to MCS Chief Communications Officer Andy Klotz, “The display created a disruptive discussion between a student and school resource officers that the student and other observers found offensive.”\n\nOne of those offended by the officers’ actions was teacher Melissa Zimmerman. “The things revealed to me that day broke my heart. I’m one of the only Black teachers in the school. They felt comfortable and emboldened to say the things they did. I was told ‘police brutality is not a thing,’” said Zimmerman.\n\nKaty O’Connor, the teacher who assigned the project, was asked to move the posters inside her classroom to reduce their visibility.\n\nStudents from O’Connor’s class then organized and staged a peaceful protest in the main atrium of the school, demanding the posters’ return to the hallway and accountability for the school resource officers.\n\nKlotz said, “The students voiced their concerns and engaged in civil discussion with school and district officials.”\n\nDespite their civil response, MCS sent the students home and switched to online classes for the following three days in an effort to quell further protests.\n\nThe school board sent an email to parents informing them that the return to in-person instruction was done “in order to ensure school safety for all and to permit the educational process to move forward, there will be no more in-school protests allowed.”\n\nSchool Board President Jim Williams wrote, “We are listening to their voices with the goal to address constructive concerns and to get our students back into class as soon as practicable.”\n\nMuncie Human Rights Commission organized a peaceful protest on November 23, including a March from the school to City Hall.\n\nReported in: Liberation, November 30, 2021; Motherboard, November 18, 2021; Muncie Star Press, November 16, 2021.\n\nCarmel Clay, Indiana\n\nParents attending the July 26 Carmel Clay Schools Board meeting complained about several books offered at school libraries because they included transgender characters or had sexually explicit content.\n\nSuperintendent Michael Beresford said the district would examine all of the books mentioned during the meeting.\n\nOn their Facebook page, Unify Carmel states they are targeting any book they can find through the search terms “transgender” and “gender identity.” Unify Carmel is a local conservative group opposed to wearing masks, teaching “critical race theory,” and to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.\n\nAfter the meeting, Unify Carmel member Michelle Ball added Yaa Gyasi’s Homegoing to the list of books they were challenging. Ball sent an email to Carmel Clay Schools’s attorney calling for the immediate removal of the book based on the belief it was violating Indiana code 35-49-3-3 regarding dissemination of matter harmful to minors.\n\nIn response, Homegoing was collected from students and removed from the classroom and the curriculum.\n\nThe disposition of the other challenged titles has not been reported on or documented in school board meeting minutes.\n\nAdditional titles challenged by Unify Carmel:\n\nCall me Max by Kyle Lukoff\n\nIntroducing Teddy: A Gentle Story About Gender and Friendship by Jessica Walton\n\nIt’s Perfectly Normal by Robie Harris\n\nDoing it Right: Making Smart, Safe, and Satisfying Choices About Sex by Bronwen Pardes\n\nL8r, G8r by Lauren Myracle\n\nCrank by Ellen Hopkins\n\nPhoenix Goes to School: A Story to Support Transgender and Gender Variant Children by Phoenix Finch\n\nSparkle Boy by Leslea Newman\n\nThe Infinite Moment of Us by Lauren Myracle\n\nJesus Land by Julia Scheeres\n\nWater for Elephants by Sara Gruen\n\nMorris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress by Christine Baldacchino\n\nWoke: A Guide to Social Justice by Titania McGrath\n\nJulian is a Mermaid by Jessica Love\n\nThe Hate U Give by Angie Thomas\n\nSeeing Gender: An Illustrated Guide to Identity and Expression by Iris Gottlieb\n\n(See: Journal of Intellectual Freedom & Privacy, v.6 iss.4: For the Record: Carmel, Indiana).\n\nReported in: FOX 59, July 27, 2021; Unify Carmel, August 27, 2021.\n\nWestfield, Indiana\n\nA group called Unify Westfield started an online petition calling for the removal of all books dealing with gender identity or sexual orientation from Westfield Washington elementary schools.\n\nAt their February 9, 2021 meeting, Parent Veronica Winkleman spoke to the school board regarding her concerns with the books on the petition as well as the title Sometimes People March by Tessa Allen.\n\nWinkleman said felt it was inappropriate for elementary students to learn about reproductive rights. She also said she “does not like people choosing their pronouns.”\n\nAt the March 9 board meeting, six people expressed concerns about the availability of books about gender identity at the school library. At the April 20 meeting, nearly 90 people addressed the board about the books.\n\nAll of the books challenged were moved behind the counter at the library, out of students’ reach.\n\nThe Westfield Washington School District has a materials challenge process that requires review by a committee following the submission of a request for reconsideration form. It does not appear the policy was followed in this instance.\n\nBrooke Watkins, district director of secondary curriculum instruction and talent development, told the board that the district has only received four requests for reconsideration in the past four years.\n\nBooks targeted:\n\nI am Jazz by Jazz Jenning\n\nIt Feels Good to Be Yourself by Theresa Thorn\n\nJulian is a Mermaid by Jessica Love\n\nMelissa (previously published as George) by Alex Gino\n\nMorris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress by Christine Baldacchino\n\nOne of a Kind Like Me by Laurin Mayeno\n\nThey, She, He, Me. Free to Be by Maya Christina Gonzalez\n\nReported in: Indianapolis Star, April 2, 2021, August 30, 2021.\n\nAnkeny, Iowa\n\nOn November 24, Ankeny school district removed Maia Kobabe’s memoir Gender Queer from all district libraries, following the recommendation of a committee convened to review it.\n\nKobabe’s graphic memoir is a 2020 American Library Association Alex Award winner and a Stonewall Award Honoree. School Library Journal called it “a great resource for those who identify as nonbinary or asexual, as well as for those who know someone who identifies that way and wish to better understand.”\n\nSchool Library Journal recommended it for grades 9 and up and called it “a book to be savored rather than devoured, this memoir will resonate with teens. . . . It’s also a great resource for those who identify as nonbinary or asexual as wll as those who know someone who identifies that way and wish to better understand.”\n\nThe committee determined that while Gender Queer met the criteria of the district’s selection policy and was “in no way pornographic, the explicit visual and graphic nature of the graphic novel overshadowed the message to the reader.”\n\nThe committee recommended that three other books be retained by district libraries: The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie, All Boys Aren’t Blue by George M. Johnson, and Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews.\n\nAccording to the librarian, parents have also challenged Lawn Boy by Jonathan Evison and Queer, There, and Everywhere by Sarah Prager, but the fates of these titles were not delineated in the school district’s press release.\n\nReported in: Ames Tribune, December 7, 2021; Ankeny Community School District News, November 24, 2021.\n\nJohnston, Iowa\n\nParents Mandy and Rodney Gilbert submitted formal reconsideration requests to remove the books The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas and The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie from the curriculum of the Johnston Community School District.\n\nThe Gilberts objected to the themes the books contain and the profane language they include. Rodney Gilbert went so far as to claim that the school was violating the law by making the books available. “It’s about the law and giving obscene things to children. If I gave this to my 15-year-old neighbor, I would be arrested,” he said.\n\nThe first meeting of the reconsideration committee took place on November 3 at a fraught time for both Iowa politics and the school board. Brad Zaun, president of the state Senate Judiciary Committee, attended the meeting and said he supports charging teachers with felonies for having “obscene” books in school and classroom libraries.\n\nEarlier this year, Governor Kim Reynolds signed a law barring the teaching of critical race theory (CRT) and other concepts from government training and classroom curricula.\n\nOn the day before the meeting, three candidates who signed the 1776 Action Pledge to “defeat toxic, CRT-inspired curriculum and restore honest, patriotic education” were elected to the board.\n\nFormer school board president Justin Allen, who was not re-elected, expressed concerns about these candidates’ actions before the election. “If you sign a pledge to an outside organization, you’re no longer thinking independently [about] what’s best for the district.”\n\nAllen wasn’t alone in holding these sentiments. A protest against the board members who signed the 1776 Action Pledge was organized by community members and held outside the library on November 22.\n\nThe Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian is a semi-autobiographical novel about Junior’s life on the Spokane Indian Reservation and attending a nearly all-White public high school. It explores themes of poverty, racism, alcoholism, and bullying.\n\nAlexie’s book won numerous awards including the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature, the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, and the Odyssey Award for the best audiobook for children or young adults.\n\nThe Hate U Give is a young adult novel narrated by a Black teenager who witnesses a White police officer shoot and kill an unarmed Black man during a traffic stop.\n\nThomas’s book has also won numerous awards, including a 2018 Michael L. Printz Award, three Goodreads Choice Awards, the 2018 William C. Morris Award for best debut book for teens, the 2018 Indies Choice Award for Young Adult Book of the Year, and it was a 2018 Coretta Scott King Book Award honoree.\n\nJake Chapman, president of the Iowa State Senate, attended the second meeting of the reconsideration committee on November 18. He said he would work to make providing youth with such books a felony and would see that teachers are charged.\n\n“I don’t know why the school thinks that they’re above the law, but I intend to do something about it,” said Chapman.\n\nNumerous Johnston High School students in attendance spoke out in defense of the books. Regarding The Hate U Give, Sofia Bristow said “This book should not be censored to make lessons of racial injustice palatable to White audiences.”\n\n“I experienced my first act of racism at six years old,” said freshman Kaylee Jones. “All that The Hate U Give is doing is drawing attention to the problem and I’m asking you to hear me out.”\n\nThe reconsideration committee issued a recommendation to keep the books in the curriculum, provided that detailed notice about the books would be given to parents going forwards. Superintendent Laura Kacer endorsed their recommendation.\n\nThe Gilberts appealed the committee’s decision, requiring a determination from the school board.\n\nAt their regular December 13 meeting, the school board voted 4-3 to uphold the recommendation that had been made by the reconsideration committee and endorsed by Superintendent Laura Kacer.\n\nThe three board members who voted against the motion were Deb Davis, Clint Evans, and Derek Tidball, the newly elected members who signed the 1776 Action Pledge.\n\nReported in: WHO13, November 18, 2021; KCCI, November 22, 2021; Des Moines Register, November 19, 2021.\n\nMuscatine, Iowa\n\nNumerous residents voiced their opinions about banning books during the public comments section of the November 15 meeting of the Muscatine school board.\n\nWhile there was no related item on the agenda and while the parent of a high school student had complained about the book All Boys Aren’t Blue by George M. Johnson, no formal request for reconsideration was received until January.\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue is a memoir about Johnson’s experiences growing up as a queer Black man which Kirkus referred to as a “captivating merciful mirror for growing up Black and queer today.”\n\nPublishers Weekly called it “a balm and testimony to young readers as allies in the fight for equality” and said “in a publishing landscape in need of queer Black voices, readers who are sorting through similar concepts will be grateful to join him on the journey.”\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue received numerous accolades including being the American Library Association’s 2021 Rainbow List selection for Young Adult Nonfiction, one of the Young Adult Library Services Association 2021 Teens’ Top 10, one of the 2019 Outstanding Books for the College Bound, and a selection for the Goodreads Choice Award.\n\nDuring the school board meeting, most residents spoke out in opposition to book bans of any kind.\n\nResident Tom Emerick said “Our students need an unrestricted library, and in this critical time we can’t afford to have students without critical thinking skills.”\n\nBoy Scouts of America troop leader Frantz Silberger spoke about the requirement for new scouts to learn about diversity, equity, and inclusion in order to earn their Citizenship in Society merit badge.\n\n“If we want people to live in Muscatine, I personally believe we need to educate people—and that includes our children—on the importance of welcoming all people, regardless of their differences,” said Silberger. “As you move forward, I hope you consider who we are and who we want to be before you ban educational materials for youth.”\n\nDeb Hagy spoke on behalf of Faith United Church of Christ’s Open and Affirming Committee. “As citizens of Muscatine and people of faith, we respectfully ask you to consider the banning of books as both divisive and undemocratic.”\n\n“We believe the school library should reflect and respect the diversity of the community. We also believe that school libraries should honor and support the freedom of speech and the freedom to learn about the world from multiple perspectives,” Hagy said.\n\n“I have some experience with being abused as a child,” said Shelly Servadio Elias. “The library was my refuge.” She said reading about women overcoming similar experiences gave her hope.\n\n“Banning books, education, and those safe spaces and places where children can read about different experiences and backgrounds cuts off lifelines to the outside world . . . If you take that away from them because you want to ban a book because of your own ideology or narrow world view, that’s about you, not about what’s best for your child.”\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue is currently under committee review in accordance with the district’s reconsideration policy for books and instructional materials.\n\nReported in: Muscatine Journal, November 19, 2021.\n\nGreenville, Michigan\n\nDuring the December 13 meeting of the Greenville Public Schools Board of Education, two residents raised concerns about books available from school libraries.\n\nJon Behrends did not specify any titles he was concerned about, but lamented that the district was a place where “vulgar pornographic content” was available for students to check out. Behrends asked, “Does the board support 13-year-old children reading vulgar material?”\n\nBehrends requested that the board tender a list of every book within district libraries, a list of every book ordered in the last four years, and a breakdown of the district’s social-emotional learning curriculum.\n\nResident Jennifer Gunderson focused her comments on Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews, which is available at the high school library.\n\nMe and Earl and the Dying Girl is a coming-of-age novel about two high school friends who make films together and a classmate with leukemia. It explores themes of friendship, jealousy, and loss. It was selected as one of the Young Adult Library Services Association “2013 Top Ten Best Fiction for Young Adults” titles.\n\n“This book is full of disgusting language,” Gunderson lamented. “Why are our students reading this type of stuff?”\n\nSuperintendent Linda Van Houten said that the district has an established process for reconsidering materials, which Gunderson and Behrends were welcome to utilize.\n\nVan Houten said that the district has a request for reconsideration form “that allows individuals to submit their concerns to be reviewed. This form is reviewed by the professionals in the field, administration, and a committee representative of our district, before decisions are made. We must balance the interests of all students and families within our district with the opinions of some.”\n\nIn January, the district received requests for reconsideration for Me and Earl and the Dying Girl as well as for Looking for Alaska by John Green.\n\nReported in: The Daily News, December 30, 2021.\n\nKirkwood, Missouri\n\nDuring the public comments section of the November 29 meeting of the Kirkwood School District Board of Education, a parent claimed that school libraries had 21 “pornography-related books.”\n\nAnother speaker raised objections to Stamped from the Beginning by Jason Reynolds on the grounds that it promoted critical race theory (CRT).\n\nOther parents praised the work of the district’s equity task force and spoke about the importance of avoiding censorship and allowing children access to a wide range of ideas, books, and authors.\n\n“Apparently, I’m supposed to be outraged by the books in our school libraries. I am not,” said parent Sarah Pitt Kaplan. “I can’t deem what is appropriate for another person’s child, nor should I have them dictate what my children can read.”\n\nThe spate of community members who came prepared to speak either for or against the banning of books from school libraries was apparently spurred by an event at the October 25 board meeting. During that meeting, Jessica Crandell left the podium and approached the board members with a copy of Maia Kobabe’s Gender Queer.\n\nThe book was not in any district library and Crandell was barred from school board meetings for a year for failing to follow the policy governing\n\nThe district confirmed that all but one of the titles mentioned were in school libraries and available for circulation to students.\n\nFormal requests for reconsideration have not been filled out and submitted regarding these books.\n\nAt the board’s January 10 work session, the district’s policy governing the reconsideration of library materials was updated.\n\nThe policy now requires that principals receive all book reconsideration requests; that committees reviewing materials for reconsideration consist of two teachers, the principal or designee, a librarian from the school, two parents of students at the school, a district patron, and an additional administrator.\n\nCommittee members are required to read challenged materials in their entirety. Decisions made by a reconsideration committee apply to all schools in the district and the same items cannot be challenged again for 36 months.\n\nThe titles challenged during the public comments section of the November 29 board meeting were:\n\nFences by August Wilson\n\n#MurderTrending by Gretchen McNeil\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue by George M.

M. Johnson.\n\nThe parent group appealed this decision to the school board. At their December 16 meeting, the board voted 6-1 to retain The Handmaid’s Tale for library use and for use in the curriculum. They also voted 6-1 to retain Gender Queer in libraries.\n\nOn February 24, the board voted 6-1 to retain All Boys Aren’t Blue and The Testaments. The board voted unanimously to retain This Book is Gay but with a the label “mature for high school” added to the online catalog and inside the cover.\n\nThe disposition of the additional titles is yet to be determined.\n\nTitles challenged:\n\nLiving Dead Girl by Elizabeth Scott\n\nThis Book is Gay by Juno Dawson\n\nCrank by Ellen Hopkins\n\nOut of Darkness by Ashley Hope Perez\n\nBlack Girl Unlimited by Echo Brown\n\nFlamer by Mike Curato\n\nFences by August Wilson\n\nAnger is a Gift by Mark Oshiro\n\nHeavy: An American Memoir by Kiese Laymon\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale: The Graphic Novel by Margaret Atwood and Renee Nault\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood\n\nTestaments by Margaret Atwood\n\nThe Girl Who Fell from the Sky by Heidi W.

After being thrown to the ground and handcuffed by a White police officer, he attempts to make sense of life as a Black teenager today by writing letters to the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nDear Martin was nominated for numerous awards and was included on the American Library Association’s 2018 Top Ten Quick Picks for Reluctant Young Adult Readers lists.\n\nSuzy Gonzalez was disturbed by the decision to remove the book from the curriculum, as her son felt a personal connection to it.\n\n“His peers in his class started telling him that racism didn’t exist,” Gonzalez said. “To me, it is important for the community to know that this is a problem in their own backyard.”\n\nSuperintendent Mark Drake said that the book wasn’t pulled because of its content, but because it wasn’t properly approved for use in the curriculum.\n\nPrincipal Stephanie Heman wrote to parents that “Selecting books for students to read in the classroom will undergo strict review to avoid similar situations.”\n\nAn updated process that will use a committee of teachers, administrators, and parents to review all reading materials is expected to be in place for the 2022-2023 school year.\n\nDrake said that Dear Martin “would be a book that would go through the committee if the teacher still wanted to teach that or even if we wanted to have it on the shelf of the library.”\n\nDirector of communications Ana Espinoza said that the district has copies of the book which parents can check out if they want to read it.\n\nAndy Brandt, who has three children in the district, expressed concerns over the proposed plan to pre-screen new reading material.\n\n“They don’t need to be banning any more books because of a small, vocal minority,” Brandt said. “If they think this book is wrong, I question their ability to filter the other books.”\n\nStudents who had been assigned to read Dear Martin will be reading To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, instead.\n\nReported in: Associated Press, January 14, 2022; Springfield News-Leader, January 13, 2022.\n\nNorth Kansas City, Missouri\n\nDuring the October 26 board meeting of the North Kansas City School District, members of the Northland Parent Association (NPA) lobbied for the removal of All Boys Aren’t Blue, Out of Darkness, Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic, and Lawn Boy.\n\nA Google Sheet called “MO State Public School Books List” was shared by NPA prior to the meeting. It identified a total of 32 books, the number of copies of each held by every high school in two school districts, whether they were digital or hard copies, and the “offensive pages” in each title.\n\nThe sheet was riddled with typos and three of the five tabs–the ones for middle and elementary school library holdings–remained unused by NPA. The tabs for high school materials contained numerous empty columns labeled “[School Name] (School District).” The formatting and lacuna suggest that some manner of book banning template was utilized by the association.\n\nAll the challenged books were by or about Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC), and/or had LGBTQIA+ authors, characters, and themes.\n\nFollowing the October board meeting, superintendent Dan Clemens instructed librarians to remove Fun Home and All Boys Aren’t Blue from the libraries of the North Kansas City, Oak Park, Staley, and Winnetonka high schools in violation of district policy.\n\nUpon learning of this, the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC) sent a letter to the board pointing out that “it is obviously improper for the District to ignore duly adopted Board rules and regulations.”\n\nNCAC pointed out that the books which were improperly removed from district libraries both serve to support the district’s mission statement to “inspire lifelong learning” and “embrace inclusion.”\n\nFun Home is a graphic memoir exploring themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, and family dysfunction. It received numerous accolades including the Eisner Award for Best Reality-Based Work and a nomination for the National Book Critics Circle Award. Publishers Weekly named it the best comic book of 2006 and The New York Times, Amazon.com, and The Times of London all named it one of the best books of 2006.\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue is a memoir about Johnson’s experiences growing up as a queer Black man which Kirkus referred to as a “captivating merciful mirror for growing up Black and queer today.”\n\nPublishers Weekly called it “a balm and testimony to young readers as allies in the fight for equality” and said “in a publishing landscape in need of queer Black voices, readers who are sorting through similar concepts will be grateful to join him on the journey.”\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue received numerous accolades including being the American Library Association’s 2021 Rainbow List selection for Young Adult Nonfiction, one of the Young Adult Library Services Association 2021 Teens’ Top 10, one of the 2019 Outstanding Books for the College Bound, and a selection for the Goodreads Choice Award.\n\nOn November 2, a group of students started an online petition against banning books from the North Kansas City school district. It garnered over 1,100 signatures.\n\nOn November 19, the school district sent a letter to parents announcing that Fun Home and All Boys Aren’t Blue would be returned to library shelves in the district as their earlier removal had violated students’ First Amendment rights.\n\nPrior to this reversal being reported, but after it took place, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Missouri sent an email to school board president Jan Kauk stating that “The Constitution prohibits community members or school officials from imposing their own personal views and concerns upon an entire school community.”\n\n“The Board has no basis for denying student access to a specific book based on the disagreement and discomfort of certain parents with the book’s content,” wrote Anthony Rothert, Director of Integrated Advocacy for ACLU of Missouri. “Removing a book from library shelves constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination while also impermissibly stigmatizing students who would choose to read the book.”\n\nThe ACLU email called for the return of Fun Home and All Boys Aren’t Blue to the shelves; for books to remain continuously available to students while titles or district policies are under review; to deny further requests to ban books; to review policies and practices related to library book selection to ensure “conformity with constitutional law”; and “for student advocates to have an opportunity to be heard on this issue.”\n\nThis is the full list of titles targeted by NPA:\n\n#MurderTrending by Gretchen McNeil\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue by George M.

The fliers also listed which school libraries the books were available at.\n\nJanet Deidrick called the books “pornography” and said they include drinking, foul language, teen pregnancy, oral sex, and a rape scene.\n\nAssistant superintendent Shelley Willott said Rockwood had policies in place to allow parents to place restrictions on what their children are allowed to check out from district libraries. The district also has a policy governing how requests for the reconsideration of materials are handled.\n\n“It’s important to remember that for every person that doesn’t want their child to read a certain book, there’s somebody who does want their child to read those books,” said Willott.\n\nWillott noted that no formal challenges had been received for any of the books parents objected to at the meeting.\n\nTwo books for which formal requests for reconsideration had been received were on the official agenda, however.\n\nThe board voted unanimously to retain The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas in the district’s middle school libraries.\n\nThe Hate U Give had previously been used in an 8th grade “critical literacy unit” and the review committee recommended retaining the book as the unit was now called “analyzing contemporary literature” and it no longer included Thomas’s book.\n\nThe board also voted unanimously to retain Batman: The Brave and the Bold—Clobbered by Clayface in the Chesterfield Elementary School library.\n\nAfter the October 21 meeting, nine formal requests for reconsideration were received from the district.\n\nLanguage Arts Department Chair Lisa Donovan expressed her belief that people at the board meetings have taken elements of the books out of context and represented the material in an inaccurate fashion.\n\n“I think some of the accusations have been a bit exaggerated. I think teachers and librarians give thoughtful time to choose books that will help kids in any way possible,” said Donovan.\n\nAt the December 16 board meeting, it was announced that a review committee of two teachers, two librarians, a curriculum coordinator, a school board member, four parents, and two high school students decided to retain All Boys Aren’t Blue, Crank, Gender Queer: A Memoir, Looking for Alaska, The Haters, and Where I End and You Begin without restriction.\n\nWillott says that the person who challenged the book shares their concerns with the committee and then is dismissed so the committee can “have authentic conversation without interruption and without fear of their conversation ending up on social media.”\n\n“We did have an instance where we did have a challenger take pictures of the committee in one of our sessions, so there was concern from them,” noted Willott.\n\nThe three other books under review are This One Summer, Heroine, and The Breakaways.\n\nAdditional titles which were objected to during board meetings or on social media but which were not formally challenged are:\n\nBreathless by Jennifer Niven\n\nDead End by Jason Myers\n\nLawn Boy by Jonathan Evison\n\nMonday’s Not Coming by Tiffany Jackson\n\nThe Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie\n\nReported in: The Lancer Feed, January 4, 2022; Leader, November 1, 2021; St. Louis Public Radio, November 18, 2021; FOX2 Now, December 29, 2021.\n\nWentzville, Missouri\n\nOn January 27, the Wentzville R-IV School District’s board voted 4-3 to withdraw Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye from its library, despite the review committee’s recommendation to retain it.\n\nA formal request for reconsideration of the book was received last October, citing a scene of rape and incest. Six members of the committee voted to retain the book, two voted to retain it with restrictions, and one voted to withdraw the title.\n\nKeri Skeeters, Assistant Superintendent of Teaching & Learning, sent the committee’s recommendation and comments to the board on January 13 and asked the board to approve their recommendation and retain The Bluest Eye.\n\nEmboldened by the board’s willingness to ban books, requests for reconsideration were then submitted for the following:\n\nAll Boys Aren’t Blue by George M.

We must protect this right, including educators’ and students’ rights to talk and learn about race and gender in schools.”\n\nReported in: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January 26, 2022; ACLU Missouri, February 15, 2022.\n\nHillsborough, New Jersey\n\nOn November 8, a student’s artwork was removed from the Hillsborough Middle School on orders from a board member, despite objections from principal Joseph Trybulski.\n\n“What happened today dishonored the work of those who defend our communities and our Constitution. What happened today was an affront to critical thinking, academic freedom, and the freedom of expression of our young people,” says Trybulski.\n\nThe student’s poster was part of a display of African American history, literature, album covers, and icons, which included social commentary and pieces on social justice. The removed poster depicted a raised fist labeled “Black Lives Matter” superimposed over the names of individuals who were victims of police violence along with the caption “Stop Police Brutality Now.”\n\n“It is abhorrent to me that any public official, including a member of this board of education, would use his or her authority to advance an agenda in censoring the views of others in an academic or any other setting.”\n\nJohn Oliver, the board member who ordered the removal of a student’s artwork, said he took issue with the student’s decision not to show the other side of police brutality. “We need to give both opposing views and let our young students and let our children make the decisions for themselves.”\n\nAs the National Coalition Against Censorship pointed out in their November 18 letter to the Hillsborough Township Board of Education, “our courts have time and again reaffirmed that the First Amendment prohibits public school officials from censoring student speech, including artistic expression, merely because they find it offensive or provocative.”\n\nDisagreement with an opinion expressed in a student’s artwork does not meet the standard established by the Supreme Court in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969), that “students have the right to speak on school grounds as long as they do not substantially disrupt the activities of the school.”\n\nReported in: National Coalition Against Censorship, November 19, 2021; Patch, November 10, 2021.\n\nHaywood, North Carolina\n\nAt the January 10 board meeting for Haywood CountySchools, Superintendent Bill Nolte said Nic Stone’s Dear Martin would be removed from the tenth grade English curriculum after a parent complained that it contained strong language.\n\nDear Martin is about Justyce McAllister, a Black student attending a predominantly White Preparatory high school in Atlanta. After being thrown to the ground and handcuffed by a White police officer, he attempts to make sense of life by writing letters to the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nNic Stone said the shooting deaths of Jordan Davis and Michael Brown inspired and informed her writing.\n\nDear Martin was nominated for numerous awards and was included on the American Library Association’s 2018 Top Ten Amazing Audiobooks for Young Adults and Top Ten Quick Picks for Reluctant Young Adult Readers lists.\n\nThe district has a policy governing “parental inspection of and objection to instructional materials.” While the policy does not require review by a committee, it does state “the board believes professional educators are in the best position to determine whether a particular instructional material is appropriate for the age and maturity of the students and for the subject matter being taught.”\n\nThe policy also states that “books and other instructional materials may be removed from the school media collection only for legitimate educational reasons and subject to the limitations of the First Amendment.”\n\nAccording to Smoky Mountain News, “when a parent takes issue with an assigned reading, the course of action in Haywood County Schools is for the parent, teacher, and principal to discuss the issue and then provide the student with an alternative reading assignment.”\n\nNolte’s actions in this case do not align with either district policy or past practice.\n\nNo copies of Dear Martin are available from the school library, so with its removal from the curriculum, students can no longer access the book at school.\n\nReported in: Smoky Mountain News, January 26, 2022.\n\nHillsborough, North Carolina\n\nLieutenant Governor Mark Robinson posted a Facebook video on October 9 calling for the removal of Melissa (previously published as George) by Alex Gino, Lawn Boy by Jonathan Evison, and Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe from all schools in North Carolina.\n\nRobinson has repeatedly called on parents to report schools to law enforcement if these and other books with LGBTQIA+ themes are available in their libraries.\n\nIn the video he referred to homosexuality and transgenderism as “filth” and “garbage” and condemned school districts for pushing “an LGBTQ agenda.”\n\nOn October 11, droves of protesters showed up at the Orange County Board of Education meeting–some supporting Robinson’s crusade, others opposing it.\n\n“The idea that I, as an educator, brainwashed children into being trans or bisexual or queer is absurd,” said teacher Jayme Carr. “If I could brainwash, my kids would be doing better in school.”\n\nAfter the meeting, a parent filed a formal complaint about Gender Queer, Lawn Boy, and Out of Darkness by Ashley Hope Pérez in a letter to Orange County High School principal Carlos Ramirez.\n\nThe school review committee, consisting of the principal, media coordinator, and teachers, read the books and recommended they be retained in the library based on their educational value and age-appropriateness.\n\nThe parent appealed the decision to school district administrators. The district review committee reached the same conclusions as the school review committee.\n\nBoard member Sarah Smylie said “I do not agree with pandering to these attempts to limit students’ access to voices of people of color and LGBTQ perspectives.”\n\nThe parent then appealed their decision to the Orange County Board of Education.\n\nBoard chair Carrie Doyle said that students who met with board members were unanimous in wanting to retain access to the books.\n\n“They needed these books.
