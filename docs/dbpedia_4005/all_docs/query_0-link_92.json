Boakye (left) and NJCU Interim President Andres Acebo after signing the agreement\n\nOfficials and students from the two institutions following the signing agreement\n\nNew Jersey State Assemblywoman Carmen Morales, D-34\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nA Transfer Agreement ensuring a seamless transition from Essex County College (ECC) to New Jersey City University (NJCU) was signed by the presidents of both institutions in a ceremony on Thursday, July 18. The signing, held on ECC’s Newark campus, will help ensure a clear pathway for students to first earn an Associate degree followed by a Bachelor’s degree and beyond, said ECC’s President, Dr. Augustine A. Boakye.\n\n“This is an agreement that brings two outstanding institutions together who have similar goals and missions. We believe that everyone should have access to a quality higher education at an affordable price,” said Dr. Boakye.\n\n“Today we are executing a plan that will not only support both our institutions, but the communities that we serve.” Dr. Boakye stated that this agreement is one more way that the College can help students first graduate from Essex County College, then continue to grow and succeed.\n\nNJCU Interim President Andres Acebo concurred. “This agreement will be our collective legacy, a program that has been championed through by our concerted efforts.” He said that there will be nearly 40 majors that students moving from ECC to NJCU can pursue at little or no cost.\n\nThe state Community College Opportunity Grant (CCOG) program covers the tuition and approved educational fees for eligible community college students which their remaining aid doesn’t pay. At the four-year institution level, the state’s Garden State Guarantee (GSG) program covers the cost of tuition and fees that are not already covered by federal and state financial aid or other scholarships.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, both institutions will establish procedures for the sharing of campus resources and student support services. The program will be evaluated on a regular basis to ensure its effectiveness.\n\nNew Jersey State Assemblywoman Carmen Morales, a former ECC Board of Trustees member, said “today marks a significant milestone in education. We are making higher education more accessible and affordable. We are strengthening the community and building a greater New Jersey.”\n\nEssex County Executive Joseph N. DiVincenzo, Jr., a graduate of NJCU when it was Jersey City State College, said, “This agreement is definitely about the students who will greatly benefit from this wonderful opportunity.”\n\nThe transfer agreement is for five years.\n\nLearn More\n\nFrom left: Ton Duong, ECC Math Professor Ines Figueiras, and Math Professor Monica Matos.

On June 13, Ton stopped by Professor Monica Matos’ MTH 121 (Calculus with Analytic Geometry I) class to talk to her students about his academic experiences and what they can expect in college and beyond going forward.\n\n“It’s always a pleasure to come back to ECC and meet with students. I want to share my story with them. Many faced the same challenges in their journey as I have in mine,” said Dr. Duong. Since graduating from ECC, he has returned to campus to meet with students on a number of occasions.\n\nHe has known Professor Matos ever since they were both students, and members of the Class of 2014, at Essex County College.\n\n“It’s amazing what Ton has accomplished. It’s wonderful that he is willing to give of his time to return and meet with our current students,” said Professor Matos.\n\nIn July, Dr. Duong is headed to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, in Maryland, where he will be a research engineer.\n\nLearn More\n\nRegistration for Summer II 2024 classes at Essex County College is underway.

The announcement was met with loud applause throughout the arena.\n\nMr. Tooma, of Clifton, served in the U.S. Air Force after graduating from high school. After receiving an honorable discharge, he worked in the computer programming industry while also attending college.\n\nBy the time Mr. Tooma had completed several general education courses, he had become a father to his son, Dr. Tooma. Knowing he had to provide for his new family, William ended his studies and took a position at IBM, going on to have a successful career as a computer systems analyst there and with other companies around the world.\n\nBut the idea of obtaining his degree lingered in the back of his mind.\n\nIn early 2023, Mr. Tooma found his old transcript and showed it to his son. Dr. Tooma joked with his father that if he enrolled at Essex, he could complete his Liberal Arts: General A.A. in a year. Father took son up on that. “I wanted my granddaughter to know that her grandfather finishes what he starts,” Mr. Tooma recalled.\n\nFor the next year, Mr. Tooma took classes at ECC, finishing up as a Summer I student eligible to be a proud member of the Class of 2024.\n\n“I just felt that, at 67, it was now or never. I hope that my story inspires others my age and younger that no matter what life may have in store for you, it’s ultimately up to you to decide what you can achieve when you push yourself. I’m truly honored and humbled to have had this experience at Essex County College,” Mr. Tooma stated.\n\n“I didn’t realize just how important it was to him. Dad never really spoke about his time in college when I was a kid. But it was clearly important to him because he raised me to know the value of a college education. I’m so proud of him. He’s a modest man, but at Commencement, I know he felt like a giant,” said Dr. Tooma.\n\nLearn More\n\nClass Valedictorian Sergio L. Cubas-Roman, is flanked by ECC's President Dr. Augustine A.

The College’s 55th annual Commencement was held at Newark’s Prudential Center with cheering family and friends filling the arena’s lower level.\n\n“Class of 2024, we did it! Each and every one of us has worked tirelessly to reach this moment, and it's a testament to our dedication and resilience. So, as we bid farewell to this chapter of our lives and set out to conquer the world, let's do so with our heads held high and our hearts full of hope. The best is yet to come,” said class Valedictorian Sergio L. Cubas-Roman. The Engineering major with a 3.98 grade point average is transferring to NJIT.\n\nEsther Okie, a Finance major, served as Salutatorian. She has a 4.0 GPA and will transfer to NJIT.\n\nIn her keynote address, New Jersey Lieutenant Governor Tahesha Way talked about the power of education. “I hope your time at Essex County College helped to make you more confident. You’ve taken a huge stop forward. But your journey doesn’t end today. I can’t wait to see what you can do next.” Lieutenant Governor Way received an honorary Essex County College Associate degree.\n\nECC’s President, Dr. Augustine A. Boakye, presided over the Commencement.\n\nThere were five Assistant Marshals in this year’s class. All five graduated with perfect 4.0 GPAs. Pharell Kenda (Engineering); Daniel Youn Suh Lee (Physical Therapist Assistant); Monica Sanchez Plasencia (Finance); Joanna Vicente (Social Science), and Jasmine Williams (Social Science) had the honor of leading the Class of 2024 Commencement procession.\n\nThe youngest graduate was Ademide Johnson, 16, with an Associate degree in Business Administration. This year’s oldest grad was Jean Claude Therlong, 74, with a degree in Finance.\n\nMath Professor Ines Figueiras served as this year’s Grand Marshal. “Be a lifelong learner. Learning doesn’t stop here. Make this world a better place,” she said in her charge to the graduates.\n\nEach Academic Division Chair read the names of graduates in their areas. Dr. William Tooma, Chair of Humanities and Bilingual Studies, had the unique honor of calling his father, William Tooma, 67, to receive his hard earned Associate of Arts in Liberal Arts. “It’s certainly a rare moment for a son to bestow a degree on his father,” said Dr. Tooma to thunderous applause.\n\nAmong this year’s graduates were 131 high school students in the College’s Dual Enrollment program. They represent East Side High School (83 in Liberal Arts), West Side High School (13 in Business Administration), University High School (3 in Liberal Arts), Orange High School (10 in Liberal Arts) and Essex County Schools of Technology – Newark Tech (22 in Liberal Arts). They were recognized during the ceremony and called up by name to receive their degrees.\n\nLearn More\n\nAt PACE program signing, from left, Dr. Elvy Viera, ECC Dean of Community, Continuing Education & Workforce Development; James Walker of RampUp America; ECC President Dr. Augustine A.

This partnership will create a pathway into the burgeoning telecommunications sector.\n\nThe College received a $502,998 New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development grant for the program, geared to enroll and train 45 historically underrepresented students and adult learners for the fiber optics industry.\n\nThe first group of 15 students will begin classes for eight weeks at the College in July, said Dr. Elvy Vieira, Dean of Community, Continuing Education & Workforce Development. The students will also work as pre-apprentices in the fiber optics and broadband industry as part of their training. The initiative is known as Fiber Optic Careers Unlock Success (FOCUS), she said.\n\nDr. Vieira said that in order to make the initiative a success, the College joined forces with RampUP America, Inc. RampUp has a collaborative alliance with the Minority Business Enterprises NetTarius Technology Solutions, LLC, and Avatar Tech LLC, both Newark-based networking infrastructure firms. These companies will offer pre-apprenticeship positions for the students.\n\nDerrick E. Law, President of NetTarius, said the program will lead to industry credentials, apprenticeship opportunities, and eventual employment. “This program is ideal for those starting out in fiber optics and for career advancement. The industry is growing tremendously. We are looking at an increase of 400,000 jobs in the field over the next few years.”\n\nMr. Law said it is important for people to have stackable credentials in order to move up in the industry. “That’s what RampUp is about. We want individuals to ramp up their credentials for career advancement.” He said the goal of the program is really focused in four areas:\n\nCreating a pathway to certifications\n\nPre-apprentice training\n\nPaid apprenticeship training\n\nFull time job placement\n\nECC’s President, Dr. Augustine A Boakye, stated that the FOCUS program is a comprehensive plan of action covering training, work experience, connection to a Registered Apprenticeship, and ongoing support services.\n\nThe program was officially launched recently at a meeting and agreement signing on the College’s West Essex campus with ECC officials and RampUp America representatives.

Rice, Sr. (ECC Class of 1974) was front and center as the College’s Public Safety Department was renamed in his honor during a special ceremony on March 21.\n\nECC Board of Trustees Chair Marion A. Bolden, a high school classmate of Ronald Rice, called him a “good friend” who cared deeply about his constituents and was always ready to help when asked. The dedication was spearheaded by the College Trustees soon after his death last March. Chari Bolden also read aloud the Board of Trustees proclamation for Senator Rice.\n\n“Today, we are here to celebrate the life of Ronald Rice,” ECC’s President, Dr. Augustine A. Boakye told the audience that included his son, Ronald, Jr., former members of his legislative staff and former colleagues.\n\n“I want to thank everyone who made today possible. You have made my father an integral part of this great institution that he loved so much. Today I feel him smiling down on us, said Ronald Rice, Jr. “I remember my father saying whatever he was able to achieve in life started at Essex County College. He understood the importance of community colleges.”\n\nDr. Boakye noted Senator Rice’s long affiliation with ECC. “He was first a student, and then served as President of our Alumni Association,” Dr Boakye stated. “The Senator said be committed to everything you want to do, and don’t be afraid,” Dr. Boakye added.\n\nSenator Rice devoted nearly half a century to public service, working as a Newark Police Officer and serving as a Newark City Council member, as well as a New Jersey State Senator for 36 years in the 28th Legislative District.\n\nHe spearheaded legislation to provide relief for individuals in a wide range of quality of life issues. He was a founder and the longtime chair of the Legislative Black Caucus, and focused on racial and social justice issues throughout his career.\n\nDr. Mamie Bridgeforth, Chair of ECC’s Division of Social Sciences, served as Mistress of Ceremonies at the program. She recalled her long friendship with Senator Rice. In 1998, she replaced him on the Newark City Council, representing the West Ward.\n\nSenator Rice’s pastor, Bishop Jethro James of Paradise Baptist Church, offered the Invocation.\n\nOther dignitaries at the ceremony included ECC President Emeritus A.

The designation was awarded at the recent PTK Middle States Regional Convention in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\n“Receiving this honor is so gratifying. It’s really due to the hard work and dedication of our membership and advisors,” said Samirah Scantling, ECC’s PTK President.\n\nAt the convention, Samirah received the Distinguished Chapter Officer, and Hall of fame Chapter President awards. Yanilda Munoz received the Distinguished Chapter Member and Karen Alcocer (Fall 2023 Vice President) was the recipient of the Distinguished Chapter Officer.\n\n“Achieving the 5 Star Chapter honor only comes with a lot of hard work and collaboration on the part of the Officer Team and the membership of our Chapter. Their cohesiveness made it possible to produce the Honors in Action and College Projects – examples of true teamwork,” said ECC Professor Lynn Wilson, co-advisor of the Chapter.\n\nThe Chapter’s College Project was dubbed Charity Begins at Home, the PTK ECC Cares Pop-Up Shop. The shop provided numerous, clothes, shoes, other Winter essentials and hygiene items to 75 students from November 27 to December 1, 2023.\n\nThe Honors in Action project involved working with the College’s Child Development Center on the Montessori Method, providing various Montessori activities to the young children. The project’s goal was to encourage parents to incorporate free activities into their children’s daily routines.\n\nThese activities contribute to earning the 5 Star Chapter designation.\n\nThe Chapter held PTK at West Essex on March 12. “By being at our newly opened West Essex campus today, we are showing that the College is growing and PTK is an important part of that,” said Dr. Keith Kirkland, Dean of Student Affairs. He told the PTK members at the event “you are ambassadors for ECC. Continue to reach out to your fellow students.”\n\nPTK member Vanessa Porta said the Chapter is starting work on an initiative called the Power of Stories for the next Honors in Action project. She said the project will focuses on the importance of mental health\n\nPhi Theta Kappa has been a part of ECC since 1982. Samirah said there are numerous scholarship opportunities for PTK members.

The two institutions signed a wide-ranging articulation agreement on February 21 during a ceremony held at ECC’s West Essex campus in West Caldwell.\n\nThe five year agreement commences on May 1, 2024. It is for designated programs for which the institutions have articulated program agreements.\n\n“This agreement will give more of our graduating students the opportunity to reach the goals they have set for themselves. We are building on what we have done before. Our College provides students the opportunity to earn Associate degrees; that’s what we do. But we certainly don’t want them ending their education at that level. Our agreement gives them another avenue to move up,” said ECC’s President, Dr. Augustine A. Boakye.\n\n“It makes perfect sense for our two institutions to work together. This agreement provides up to $30,000 in scholarship money for the transferring students. We serve people in this community who will stay in this community. We will continue to look for other ways our two institutions can work together,” stated Caldwell University President, Dr. Jeffrey D.

The annual pinning, held on January 19, marked the end of just one step for these students toward a career in healthcare.\n\n“This evening is a significant milestone in our lives. Today we have proven that nothing is important if we work hard. We now must make the commitment to be the best possible nurse that we can be,” said LPN Class President Cassandra Nerette in her remarks at the pinning.\n\nPrince Cepeda, who served as class Vice President, said the LPN program has really helped him on his way toward achieving his dream of becoming a Registered Nurse (RN). The Newark resident has been working as a Patient Care Technician in the ER at Clara Maass Medical Center in Belleville. “I like being on the front line of care and ECC is really preparing me for that.” His next step, after the upcoming National Council Licensure Examination (known as NCLEX), will be applying to the ECC RN program.\n\nSimona Wright, who also aspires to become an RN, said she wants to set a good example for her 14-year-old daughter. Simona, of Irvington, presently works as a Patient Care Technician at University Hospital. She is now ready to apply to the RN program at ECC, the next step toward her dream and the example she is setting for her daughter.\n\nNursing Chairperson Lori York stated it was the dedication of the faculty, along with the determination of the students, to earn the LPN pins. “Your faculty loves you,” she told the graduates.\n\nIn her keynote address, Nursing Professor Natalee White-Smith urged the graduates to “take advantage of all the opportunities available to you. Life offers you possibilities and opportunities.”\n\nMoromoke Adedapo was class Valedictorian with a 3.89 grade point average. Olubisi Williams-Adenuga carried a 3.87 average as Salutatorian.

His older brother, Samuel, also an ECC student majoring in Biology, Pre-Medicine, heads to campus a little later in the day. His mom, Adeola, makes sure he is ready for his long day.\n\n“I’m usually at school around 8:30 when I grab a quick cup of coffee,” Mark said. Then his day really gets going. “Before class I’ll watch videos related to my assignments and go over some class notes.”\n\nMark is taking four classes in the Fall 2023 Semester; Calculus, Chemistry, Physics and AutoCAD. He currently maintains a 3.6 grade point average. He also offers tutoring help to classmates, when asked, in Math and Chemistry.\n\nIn addition to his academics, Mark serves as President of the College’s Student Government Association (SGA) and a member of the Technology, Engineering & Computer Science (TECS) Club. It’s his SGA position that takes up a large part of his day, whether it be planning for an upcoming Student Forum, preparing for a large campus project, or keeping students updated on the latest campus news. Mark finds time to help out at the Student Food Pantry. “By working in the Food Pantry, I can see how important it is to provide this service to students.\n\n“I like to keep busy and I’m motivated because I want to help people. I only have two years at ECC and I want to make an impact,” he stated.\n\nMark appeared in a recent episode of ECC’s Community Education Forum where he talked about his busy schedule with host Alfred Bundy, Executive Director of the College’s Office of Institutional Advancement.\n\nAfter class, and when he doesn’t have SGA work, Mark can usually be found attending the TECS Club meetings. “Honestly, this is the only club I have time for aside from SGA,” he admits.\n\nThe meetings also give Mark the opportunity to connect with a few other club members who comprise an informal study group. “The four of us are either Engineering or Computer Science majors. The sessions keep me focused on school work and it’s a great time to share information and new ideas,” he said.\n\nThe group also usually gets something to eat in the early evening before eventually calling it a day. Mark gets home between 8 and 9 p.m. At that point, he has a snack and watches a movie or the news. “It’s when I wind down before I start up again.”\n\nMark receives a lot of support from his mom and brothers, along with his SGA peers, professors and friends at College.\n\nMark enjoys playing drums, which he performs during services at the Newark Assembly of God. “I’ve always liked music. Growing up in Nigeria I had a guitar, which I’m starting to relearn now.”\n\nHis career goal is becoming an aerospace engineer. MIT tops his list of transfer destinations after ECC, followed by Princeton University and Rutgers University-New Brunswick. Mark wants to work on the conversion of combustible aircraft engines into electrical units.\n\nMark has a bright future.

Essex County College was well represented in the Challenge as ECC produced three teams to compete.\n\nFor five weeks through the end of November, the students worked in five member teams placing trades using $1 million in “virtual funds.” The students had to carefully select their investments as they were limited to spend no more than $200,000 for any one stock, said Professor John Hammond, one of the faculty advisors to the Challenge.\n\nThe students worked at the College’s Bloomberg Lab terminals on average about five hours per week. The terminals allow students, mostly Finance or Business Administration majors, access to the most up to date financial information available.\n\nThe results were tabulated weekly by Bloomberg LP. According to Bloomberg, the challenge was to provide students firsthand what real-world investing looks and feels like. Teams used the Terminal to define market assumptions, develop a return-generating strategy, and execute trades within a closed network.\n\nProfessor Hammond said that this was the second year ECC competed in the Challenge. “We started talking about the Challenge in the Spring for recruiting and student participation was outstanding this year,” he added.\n\n“The Bloomberg Challenge helped give me a lot of experience navigating the financial markets. I’m interested in an investment career and I’m certainly glad I took part in the Challenge,” said Angelica Laguador, a Finance major from West Orange.\n\n“I now have a better knowledge of the stock market. I really learned a lot by participating,” stated Rihanata Sana, a Finance major from Irvington.

The purpose of the conference was to discuss alternative pathways to tech careers.\n\n“It’s important for us at ECC to provide tech training to our students, many of whom are the first in their families to attend college. If we don’t look at giving access to high tech training to our minority population, these students face the danger of being left out of in-demand careers,” said Dr. Vieira.\n\nECC does provide a wide range of technology training through the College’s Training, Inc. But Dr. Vieira noted there is always room to expand and offer more programs.\n\n“Tech talent is in high demand with one million open positions in the U.S.,” said Nancy Hammervik, Chief Solutions Officer for CompTIA. “These jobs can open doors and unlock potential for underserved populations to earn sustainable wages and strong career paths to help economically disadvantaged families and communities.”\n\nThe conference included government officials who discussed funding programs for tech career pathways and workforce needs.\n\n“The session provided information on emerging technologies which we can use in developing new program offerings. We want our students to earn the credentials needed to secure these in-demand jobs,” stated Dr. Vieira.\n\nThe Success Stories in the Tech Workforce Landscape panel discussed how employers, educators and workforce boards are addressing the tech workforce needs and shared their experiences and recommendations.\n\n“It’s important to know the direction various industries are going in order to meet their hiring needs and provide them with the trained employees they will require in the future,” stated Dr. Vieira.\n\nLearn More\n\nBusiness Professor Jean-Wilner Alexandre (left) displays his Bright Idea Award.

But I am honored to have been recognized in this way,” Professor Alexandre said.\n\nProfessor Alexandre’s research work was one of 10 to receive the award out of 114 publications throughout the state submitted. The awards ceremony was held on November 17, 2023.\n\nHis research paper was on “Sub-Saharan Africa Case Study: Doing Business in Sub-Saharan Africa, a Paradigm Shift from Humanitarian Aid to Investment in Infrastructure, Education and Industry.”\n\nProfessor Alexandre spent over two years on the research, including a four week trip last year to Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n“This award is a big honor for both Professor Alexandre and our College. To be the first community college professor to receive the award is a huge achievement. It proves our faculty is of very high caliber,” said Business Division Chair Germaine Albuquerque.\n\n“We are all very proud of the work and dedication of Professor Alexandre.

The energetic retired teacher is passionate about her commitment to education, and her love of community and the City of Newark that nurtured her.\n\n“Volunteering and giving back to the community is a part of me. I was taught at an early age the importance of giving to others. I remember when I was in the eighth grade I volunteered at a nursing home on 10th Street” in Newark, and I haven’t stopped,” Vivian stated. “It’s in my blood.”\n\nVivian proudly says that enrolling at Essex County College, after starting out at an out-of-state school, put her on the path to a long and rewarding teaching career in the Newark Public Schools. She was able to start initially working as a teacher assistant in Newark with the credits she had already earned. But she needed a degree to become a teacher.\n\n“I was 24 when I started at Essex. Here I was, an adult learner and a little apprehensive. But the College was like a big family and the professors heightened my exuberance for learning. ECC rekindled my love for learning and teaching. I’m proud to say I graduated from ECC with Honors,” Vivian stated.\n\nVivian then went on to Rutgers University-Newark where she majored in Education and Urban Planning. “I wanted to be a city planner and teacher,” she recalled. But fulltime teaching won out.\n\nThat began a long and rewarding teaching career in which Vivian taught at a number of Newark schools. She impressed upon her students the importance of giving back to their community. Those lessons have not gone unnoticed by her pupils. “One of my former students was awarded a volunteer medal from Seton Hall University. She mentioned me in her speech. I just felt so truly blessed.”\n\nSince retiring from teaching in 2009, Vivian dedicates herself to volunteering practically every day. Although she tries to limit her volunteer hours on Mondays, whenever possible.\n\nThe Rev. Ronald Slaughter, pastor at Newark’s St. James AME Church, can count on her for any church program and activity. “I’m a lifelong member of St. James, so I’m there for anything,” Vivian said.\n\nVivian frequently stops by her ECC alma mater to help with voter registration through her Delta Sigma Theta (North Jersey Alumni Chapter) where she serves on the Social Action and Scholarship committees.\n\nHer affiliations range from membership on the Arts (Newark) High School Alumni Association to numerous college and teacher organizations. She is also Education Chair for the Ivy Hill Neighborhood Association, Newark Senior Services, Greenlight Greater Newark, Newark Museum, Newark Library and co-chairs the Friends of Newark Symphony Hall with Essex County College Executive Director of Institutional Advancement Alfred Bundy. “What the Apollo Theater means to Harlem, Newark Symphony Hall means to Newark,” she stated.\n\n“I can’t imagine my life without volunteering. Clara Dasher (who was a longtime Chair of ECC’s Board of Trustees) was an elementary school teacher, an excellent role model for education and one of my inspirations,” noted Vivian. “It’s my spiritual calling and I can say that I’m fulfilled.”\n\nLearn More\n\nCoach Fawzia Kheir\n\n____________________________\n\nFawzia Kheir was a National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) All-American when she was an ECC track standout.

Her biggest challenge is building a program, literally “from scratch.” This is only the second year the school is offering intercollegiate Cross Country.\n\n“I spent the summer getting students to try out for the Men’s and Women’s Cross Country teams. I believe we are off to a promising start,” stated Coach Kheir, a member of ECC’s Class of 2014 who earned an Associate degree in General Science. Originally hired as Cross Country coach in the summer, she was also named Track & Field coach in September.\n\nPreviously, Coach Kheir served as an assistant coach at NJIT. “I learned a lot at NJIT, especially with recruiting. I worked mostly with the middle distance runners. That experience will help me going forward.”\n\nFollowing her graduation from ECC, Coach Kheir had an outstanding athletic career at Winston Salem State University. She captured NCAA Division II All-American Honors in the 800 meters and still holds the school’s all-time program record in the event with a time of 2:10.10.\n\nCoach Kheir said she will pull from her ECC experiences in building the Manhattan programs. “Essex County College was a huge stepping stone for my athletic career. I learned that hard work will pay off and we did have to work hard.” She credits the late ECC Track Coach Michael Smart as pushing her to do her best. “He believed in me and told me where ever I go I will always shine.”\n\nShe holds dual citizenship with the United States and Egypt, and runs competitively for the Egyptian National Track & Field Team.\n\nLearn More\n\nDr. Margaret Stevens and ECC's President, Dr Augustine A.

She is one of only 30 recipients out of nearly 2,000 applicants to receive the 2023 Fellowship.\n\nSilvia, who is in the Harvard Medical School joint Harvard-MIT MD/PhD program, applied for the Fellowship last Fall upon hearing about it from someone she works with in the school lab. “At that point, I just said to myself I hope I get it and I waited, she recalled. She was notified in early April, prior to the formal announcement from the Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans.\n\n“Congratulations to Silvia Huerta Lopez. All of us at ECC are very proud of her. Her accomplishments are a testament to the strong academics and student support we provide at Essex County College,” said ECC President Dr. Augustine A. Boakye.\n\n“It’s amazing to receive this Fellowship. To me, what’s so special is that the Fellowship is for immigrants and children of immigrants,” said Silvia, who was born in rural Mexico. Her family came to the United States when Silvia was 6, settling in Perth Amboy, NJ, a city with a large Spanish speaking population, which helped ease the transition of uprooting from another country.\n\nAfter earning her A.S. in Biology, Pre-Medicine, Silvia received a Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Transfer Scholarship worth, at the time, $90,000. She transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, earning her Bachelor’s degree in Biology in 2017. The Fellowship will go a long way toward Silvia being able to earn her doctorate in Neurobiology, she said.\n\nSince the Fellowship’s founding 25 years ago, the program has provided more than $80 million in funding, and recipients have studied a wide range of fields from medicine, the arts, law and business.\n\n“My and Paul’s experiences as immigrants informed our desire to give back by investing in the accomplishments of New Americans. It has been a joy to see how our Fellows leverage their education over the years to make a deep impact across communities. I’m delighted to welcome this year’s Fellowship class. As we commemorate the 10th anniversary of Paul’s passing, it is gratifying to see how his legacy lives on through every Fellow,” said Co-Founder Daisy Soros.\n\nWhile at Harvard, Silvia co-founded Quetzales de Salud, a non-profit organization that aims to improve access to primary medical care for undocumented immigrants through medical accompaniment. The organization supports Spanish-speaking patients through one-on-one phone calls with medical trainees before, during, and after clinic appointments or hospitalizations to ensure they have the resources and services to receive quality medical care.\n\nOnce she completes her Doctorate studies, Silvia wants to work with underserved communities and immigrant populations.\n\n“Essex County College provided me with a solid foundation to help me work toward my goals and dream. I owe so much to ECC and all the people I met while a student,” said Silvia.\n\nLearn More\n\nThe visit to Essex County College by His Majesty, Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin, Okyenhene, from the Ghanaian Akyem Abuakwa State on Friday, April 21, will not be forgotten by all who saw the awe-inspiring procession and heard the King’s words. The visit mixed both centuries old traditions and a 21st Century outlook by His Majesty, who assumed the Ofori Panin Stool (throne) in 1999, following the death of his brother.\n\nThe historic was on full display as the King and his entourage entered the Newark campus and moved across the College’s main forum in a slow procession accompanied by the sounds of a flute and the steady beat of drums. A member of his entourage was entrusted with a golden staff, topped with a leopard and the Ofori Panin Stool. When the staff is raised, that means the King is about to speak.\n\nAccompanied by his wife (Nana Asabea Ofori-Atta), the King spoke at a small gathering in the College’s Africana Institute followed by a public program in Smith Hall.\n\nDuring his address, the 35th royal ruler of Akyem Abuakwa talked about the history of his country – before, during and after European colonialism - and what the future can offer. “Hope for all will come when we make investments in education. The best use of technology is through the education of all people. But we can’t do that if we leave our women behind. Change is not for the faint of heart; we must prepare a better future for our children.”\n\nThe King is a proponent of equal rights and education for all citizens, and protection of natural resources.\n\nThe Akyem royal lineage goes back to the 13th Century. The Rev. DeForest “Buster” Soaries noted that His Majesty has broken a royal tradition of rulers having a number of wives. “He has distinguished himself; his wife with him today is his only wife,” the former New Jersey Secretary of State said to applause from the audience.\n\nECC’s President, Dr. Augustine A. Boakye, said the College has students from more than 32 nations, including many from Ghana. “I was very pleased when I learned that His Majesty would come to our College during his short visit to the United States. We have a rich history and culture to teach the next generation,” said Dr. Boakye, who was born and raised in Kiamasi, Ghana. ECC President Emeritus, Dr. A. Zachary Yamba, who took part in the program, was also born in Ghana.\n\nThe visit to ECC was coordinated by Dr. Akil Khalfani, Director of the College’s Africana Institute and Sociology Professor. “We think the distances between our countries is so great. But the land never ceases beneath the ocean, so we are always connected. We have to understand our long histories for us to continue to exist,” stated Dr. Khalfani.\n\nOther guests included Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Newark Deputy Mayor Ligia DeFreitas, and former Akyem Association of New Jersey President Richard Antwi Bosiako.\n\nAt the conclusion of the ceremony, His Majesty was presented with an ECC gift basket and a plaque. In turn, the College received a book on the history of the royal Akyem and a colorful mask symbolizing leadership.\n\nIn 2001, the College welcomed another king from Ghana on the occasion of the African Institute opening. Then President Dr. Yamba hosted His Majesty Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, of Ghana’s Asante Kingdom.\n\nLearn More\n\nRenee C.
