        "text": "Mentor Profile: Ceren Ocak\n\nI am Ceren Ocak, master student in the department of Curriculum and Instruction at METU. I also work as a project assistant in METU-TAF Modeling and Simulation Center. The project I work is about educating teachers with game based technologies.One of the goals of the project prepare pre service ( as in the case of PT3 project) and in-service teachers to use technology by using 3-D virtual reality technologies.Therefore, I highly interested in teacher’s perceptions and attitudes towards technology integration, their existing technological habits both in and out of school time, their effort and motivations to integrate technology into their lessons and sustain the process, their ideas about strong and weak practices in the integration process.Our Faculty Mentoring Project is also sharing same concerns. Therefore,I believe that our Faculty Mentoring Project is a revolutionary step to change habits of faculty of METU towards technology integration in classroom settings and will inspire many researchers and practitioners to conduct similar studies in all over Turkey and in all over the world.\n\nMentee Profile: Dr. Şerif Onur Bahçecik\n\nIn Faculty Mentoring Project, My partner is Dr. Şerif Onur Bahçecik from the department of International Relations at METU. I want to mention about his educational and professional background briefly. He completed his undergraduate degree in Boğaziçi University.Then he took his master degree from International Relations at METU.As a YÖK scholar, he received his Ph.D on Political Sciences at Canada Carleton University and now he is instructor in the department of International Relations at METU. If it is required to mention about his research interests, they are International Political Sociology, Human Rights in World Politics and Governmentality Foucault.\n\nWe imagined\n\nWe inspired\n\nWe learnt\n\nTOGETHER HAND in HAND\n\nby the WAY of MENTORSHIP\n\nto My Mentoring Journey!\n\nMentorship is simply building relationship between people who “demand help” and “who provide help” in which deep knowledge flows from the expert one towards novice one .Even though, this is true to some extent, I believe that it is not the case all the time. After a while,roles have began to become blurred and indistinct which is the best part of mentoring projects.The feeling of being student and the teacher at the same time keep the process dynamic, open, self-renewing and subject to change. It is obvious that no matter who we are we have much to learn from each other as long as we are willing to share and cooperate.\n\nFaculty Mentoring Project\n\nWithin the scope of the mentoring project conducted as a partial fulfillment of EDS 536 Research and Practice on Technology in Teacher Education Course, the goal is to assist faculty members with technology use in the classrooms.My motivation to engage in faculty mentoring project is to discover how new technologies can be integrated into classroom environment without disturbing its natural setting so that it would be possible to find out why educational institutions are the last places considering to keep up with developing technology.Moreover, our case would inspire other researchers or practitioners all over the world if we manage to set a good example to combine technology, pedagogy, content knowledge successfully. Even if we fail, again there would be a zero chance to get disappointed because we could still be helpful others to learn from our mistakes together.\n\nPhilosophy of Technology\n\nDr. Bahçecik has an inspiring understanding of technology. His philosophy of technology definitely worth to put into words. When I asked him what technology means to you, he definitely gives an example from Bruno Latour who is French sociologist of science and anthropologist known for his works in the field of Science and Technology. According to Bruno Latour, technology is the form of stabilized norms and values of the society.There is a two destination for bread knife, one can slice bread with it or kill a man. It is up to aim of the person who use the knife.This represents the understanding of neutrality of technology which means technology is the neutral, it depends how it is used.However,Latour says the exact opposite,technology is not neutral,instead society ascribes values and meanings to technology and fixes these norms.According to Dr. Bahçecik, it is for certain that certain technological tools have certain impact on society.It strongly required to think about these impacts and take the advantage of these technological tools and their influence on society.Moreover, he also thinks that actually technology is an old thing. In ancient times, human beings were dressing stones which was great technology for them in that times and he adds of course, technology is not called in that way, it is more associated with innovative technologies.To sum up, technology can be called as everything eases our lives.I strongly agree with Dr. Bahçecik’ point of view towards technology.\n\nMentoring Activities\n\nMeetings with Dr. Bahçecik\n\nIn total , Dr. Bahçecik and I met eight times on each Wednesday. Each session lasted approximately forty minutes in second semester of 2013-2014 academic year. In these meetings we were discussing which technological devices or software products can be integrated into classroom sessions to be able to answer needs of both the instructor and the students. The main focus is to combine technology, pedagogy and content together successively (TPACK) not to cause the feeling of “technology is used just to be used “.Therefore these discussions were really helpful to find out instructor’s classroom routines and needs of the Dr. Bahçecik and his students while the sessions go on. Besides, it is for certain that discussion with the Dr. Bahçecik was not enough to understand nature of the classroom, it was really significant to learn student’s ideas about technology and their attitudes towards technology, hopefully the classrooms dynamics were going to provide strong evidences about the nature of the classroom. That’s why, I also attended Dr. Bahçecik course as an observer and conducted a questionnaire with students to learn about their point of view about technology, it’s integration into classroom setting and their needs to decrease course load.\n\nIR 326 International Organization\n\nFirstly, I want to give some information about the course of Dr. Bahçecik that we worked on together. Name of the course is IR 326 International Organization which examines the institutional structures, political processes and impact of international organizations(IOs) in the contemporary global political and economic system. This course is offered as a must course to 3rd year International Relation students.\n\nThe Very First Meeting\n\nDiscussion of the needs and clarifying goals\n\nOur meetings started at 5th of March and at the very beginning we discussed what we expect from the Faculty Mentoring Project together with Dr. Bahçecik and I asked which parts you are dissatisfied related with the course itself. Then, based on statements of Dr. Bahçecik, IR 326 International Organization as a nature were boring students because of the heavy load of readings; thus we needed more interactive, remarkable classroom platform. Our priority was to increase participation rate in the classroom. That means, we wanted students engage more to the classroom activities and did their readings on time. We decided to use student response systems such as Clicker, Socrative , e-choice, poll everywhere etc. to attend students more into lesson and to ensure that they are having fun at the same time. However, there were two problems to overcome while applying these products into classroom. First, we have to be ensure that each student has a smart phone or find an alternative. Second, we what if using phones distract students attention and they start to interested in with their phones instead of lesson. Second of all, we want students to do their reading on time and come prepared to the classroom because there was a strong need for instruction to shift from teacher centered to student centered. That’s why we wanted to use LMS, to easily assign students and put readings there each week. Moreover, group work was included in the course syllabus, we that we could increase the rate of interaction between students via using LMS and assign each student to the groups via using the features of the LMS. Afterwards, we wanted students to have up-to- date knowledge about international organizations like NATO etc. That’s why we thought to form informal groups in the web environment where students could share daily news with related course content like facebook account or diigo account etc. Lastly, Dr. Bahçecik asked for if we could take an attendance via net environment. There was a possibility that via sending passwords to a special kind of software product students can prove their existence. We thought that we can use that kind of software.\n\nIR 326 International Organization Classroom Observation\n\nAfter clarifying the needs of Dr. Bahçecik in IR 326 course, I wondered how the 326 classroom had been operating and I participated IR 326 class as an observer to identify the parts in which technology could be integrated. According to my observations; generally there were one way interaction in the classroom. Teacher was the director, information provider, speaker of the classroom. That’s why, certainly there was a real need for more collaboration in the classroom, both from teacher to student and student to student. Dr. Bahçecik, were giving the chance of making own presentations to the students and present it in the classroom , which may increase the student’s role to some extent; however still there were a need for more interaction from student to student. This is the point, which we are going to benefit from technology but the main question is “how” ?\n\nEDS 536 ( Research and Practice on Technology in Teacher Education)\n\n” Which” and “How”\n\nFrom the aspect of technology integration into classroom setting, choosing the kind of technology and how it is going to be implemented into classroom setting can be said the most challenging part. EDS 536 Research and Practice on Technology in Teacher Education Course is the great opportunity for mentors to discuss various kinds of software products , affordances and constraints of the technology were going to be used. We as mentors, each week in EDS 536 classroom, negotiated the technological opportunities in the classroom and for each technology, we presented a demo lesson among how this specific kind of technology can be integrated into classroom setting. Therefore; more or less we were aware of the strong and the weak parts of the technology that we were going to offer to our mentees because we had a chance to practice it in our course already. Moreover, EDS 536 was the platform where we had a chance to discuss our mentee’s problems which we could not deal with our friends and the course instructor.\n\nQuestionnaire with IR 326 Students\n\nStudent’s attitude towards technology:\n\nBefore deciding to use, inevitably it was important to know how students approach our project and what would be their expectations from our Faculty Mentoring projects. That’s why I conducted a questionnaire with IR 326 students to understand their point of view towards technology integration into their courses. Moreover, it was also significant to learn about their habits among technology use both in and out of the classroom setting. Findings of the questionnaire showed that most of the IR 326 students had a positive attitude towards technology use in the classroom. They were all at least moderate level computer user. Here are some suggestions for technology integration in the classroom from IR students; using prezi instead of power point for presentations, applying students response systems, engaging in online course forums and they are also affiliated to use social media in the classroom setting.\n\nSummary\n\nWhat we have done so far\n\nBefore deciding which software we are going to use, Dr. Bahçecik and I made demo of the products together and tried to find the best one which could answer to our needs at that time. We made demo of LMS, Piazza, Socrative, Poll Everywhere, Friendfeed, Diigo together. In addition its’ appropriateness, we also expected from technology we use to be user-friendly, easy to use and possess attractive interface.\n\n1. METU LMS\n\nOur first effort was to use METU LMS which is going to be mandatory for teachers to use next semester at METU as an online communication platform with students. METU LMS provide teachers to easily assign students, share course documents ,engage students with online discussions , conduct video conferencing, grouping students etc. Instructional Technology Support Office enrolled Dr. Bahçecik as an instructor to METU LMS and Dr. Bahçecik started t use LMS actively. He said he currently use LMS while sharing documents with students. However, he had some complaints with the interface of METU LMS. At first, weekly format of LMS made a confusion about the day which the class actually takes place, that’s why I suggested him to other LMS formats where he could change from editing section. Furthermore, to send message each student, he was meant to go whole page down to click send button ,he said this represents one of the difficulties he had with LMS. Moreover, while uploading PPT presentation, the parts that should be filled necessarily was the waste of time for him. Even though, Dr. Bahçecik had some difficulties with the interface of METU LMS, he found really useful because LMS has many different features in itself and via using METU LMS Dr. Bahçecik started to serve Online Office Hour with students via using online chat feature of METU LMS. Now , he is currently using LMS and its online chat feature in the classroom before the examinations which is going to be explained in a detailed way below. For the future implications; he also want to integrate wiki book into LMS as a feature for his master course and assign his master students to prepare wiki-books as a term project.\n\n2. Online Office Hour via METU LMS\n\nWhen Dr. Bahçecik wanted to serve Online Office Hour to increase interaction rate with students out of the classroom, I suggested him to use online chat feature of LMS or Piazza in which students can also ask questions anonymously. He immediately started use LMS chat for office hour (because this feature is easier to use than Piazza) and first trial of online office hour was coincided with a week before mid-term examination. In the first practice, students generally asked the instructor about the details of the midterm examination and also asked how they are going to use piazza in which Dr. Bahçecik assign students some tasks. Dr. Bahçecik found online office hours really helpful. However, when I asked if he continued to use online office hours after first trial he said I did it for once before the exam, I did not apply after then. He thinks that using online office hours before the exam better idea. I think that he is going to make online office hours before the exams for this year.\n\n3. Piazza\n\nPiazza is an online platform where students and instructors come together to learn and teach. It offers a refined question and answer environment along with key features for effective course collaboration (https://piazza.com).After introducing piazza to Dr. Bahçecik, he really impressed by the product and decided to integrate it into his lessons. At first, he prepared 30 questions as a preparation to the exam and share this questions on piazza platform with students. In piazza, successively 2 weeks along, he shared 30 poll questions in piazza. He said I keep sharing questions upcoming weeks. Participation rate changes averagely from 7 to 9 students out of 30 students in the classroom and increased day by day with every application of each week. Dr. Bahçecik said that piazza changed the way I think , even while I am reading the weekly texts before coming to class, I think about what kind of test questions can I prepare this week which was one of the significant feedbacks he provided. Piazza not only increased the interaction rate between students and the instructor but also motivate students to come class prepared automatically because before coming to class they are expected to read required texts to be able to answer the questions served on Piazza. Lastly ,by the way , he keeps going on to use piazza in the classroom each week and he is really satisfied with Piazza.\n\n4. Socrative\n\nSocrative is a smart student response system that empowers teachers to engage their classrooms through a series of educational exercises and games via smart phones, laptops, and tablets(http://www.socrative.com). In the beginning of our Faculty Mentoring Project, we have discussed about student response systems with Dr. Bahçecik; however he started to use student response systems which is Socrative towards at the end of the course. At first, He prepared 3 or 4 questions to ask during the lesson. He used Socrative at the end of the lesson not to cause any distraction during the class time and after Socrative they spent nearly 10 to 15 minutes to discuss questions answered wrong by the students. Dr. Bahçecik generally pleased with the software but he said there happened some problems with interface of the software which is the length of the answer. It caused a problem with the display of whole words on the page. He said may be it would be a better option to use true false questions in the classroom not to have that kind of questions. As in the case of Piazza, Dr. Bahçecik emphasized that Socrative also changed the way I think, he said “whenever I read an article, there are some questions coming to my mind and I automatically think to use these questions either in Socrative or Piazza”. I asked for the opinions of the students about Socrative .He said generally they found it fun, but some students said it did not make any huge difference; it is okay to use or not to use it in the classroom. However, it is observed that each week participation to Socrative in the classroom is increasing and the participation rate is increasing among students. Moreover, using Socrative in the classroom has any other benefits according to Dr. Bahçecik.He said I can instantly see the reactions of my students and I can measure how much they listened my lesson and lastly I have a chance to re-emphasize the points I already underlay during the classroom with Socrative. In IR 326, there was just 1 student who has not smart phone which is required for Socrative. However, this problem is handled by group work. Moreover, Dr. Bahçecik does not push students to engage in Socrative activity, it is optional. However, there is a sharp increase in willingness of students to participate in technological activities by the student each week. I really wondered if these create heavier workload for Dr. Bahçecik and he sincerely stated said “when it is the first time of using a software, inevitably there is a need an effort to be made, however after a while, when I get used to be familiar with programs, it is getting easier to adapt and implement these innovative technologies into classroom setting. Furthermore, for the next years, the content of the lesson is not changing that’s why I can use the materials that I already prepared for the next semesters.”To conclude; every cloud has a silver lining.\n\nI want to present my special thanks to Dr. Bahçecik as a great contributor of Faculty Mentoring Project, Dr. Baran who gave us a chance to be a part of this inspiring project as a designer and instructor of EDS 536 course."
