        "text": "New species from the Galoka and Kalabenono massifs: two unknown and severely threatened mountainous areas in NW Madagascar\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCallmander, Martin W.; Rakotovao, Charles; Razafitsalama, Jeremi; Phillipson, Peter B.; Buerki, Sven; Hong-Wa, Cynthia; Rakotoarivelo, Nivo; Andriambololonera, Sylvie; Koopman, Margaret M.; Johnson, David M.; Deroin, Thierry; Ravoahangy, Andriamandranto; Solo, Serge; Labat, Jean-NoÃ«l; Lowry, Porter P.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Galoka mountain chain, comprising principally the Galoka and Kalabenono massifs, situated at the northern edge of the Sambirano Region in NW Madagascar is an area that was virtually unknown botanically. It was visited three times between 2005 and 2007 as part of a floristic inventory. Both massifs contain the last remaining primary forests in the Galoka chain, which extends parallel to the coastline from South of Ambilobe to North of Ambanja. Several new species have been discovered amongst the collections, eight of which are described here.

D.; Cemen, I.; Ozerdem, C.; Atakturk, K. R.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHere we apply thermodynamic modeling using Theriak-Domino to garnet-bearing rocks from the central and southern portions of the Menderes Massif to gain insight into the dynamics of western Turkey as the region experienced a transition from collisional to extensional tectonics. To this end, we report new pressure-temperature (P-T) paths from garnet-bearing rocks collected along the Alasehir detachment fault, a prominent exhumation structure in the central portion of the Menderes Massif in western Turkey, constituting the southern margin of the Alasehir Graben. These paths are compared to those from the Selimiye shear zone in the Southern (Cine) Massif. Two Alasehir garnets collected from the same outcrop record two P-T paths: 1) a prograde path beginning at 565oC and 6.4 kbar increasing to 592 oC and 7.5 kbar; and 2) near isobaric growth initiating at 531oC and 7.1 kbar and terminating at 571oC and 7.3 kbar. High-resolution P-T paths could not be modeled for the majority of Alasehir samples due to diffusional modification of garnet. However, conditions were estimated by garnet isopleth thermobarometry at the point of highest spessartine content for each crystal. Calculated P-T values for this subset of samples range between 566-651oC and 6.2-6.8 kbar. Despite this broad range, these P-T conditions are consistent with what is observed in the modeled paths. Th-Pb ages of matrix monazite range from 35.8Â±3.0 to 20.6Â±2.4 Ma, suggesting metamorphism in the central Menderes Massif occurred over a 15 m.y. period. Selimiye shear zone rocks show distinct N-shaped P-T paths, suggesting garnets in the central and southern portion of the Menderes Massif record distinctly different tectonic histories.\n\nTrace element composition of rutile and Zr-in-rutile thermometry in meta-ophiolitic rocks from the KazdaÄ Massif, NW Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÅengÃ¼n, FÄ±rat; Zack, Thomas\n\n2016-08-01\n\nIn northwest Turkey, ophiolitic meta-gabbros are exposed on the KazdaÄ Massif located in the southern part of the Biga Peninsula. Trace element composition of rutile and Zr-in-rutile temperatures were determined for meta-gabbros from the KazdaÄ Massif. The Zr content of all rutiles range from 176 to 428 ppm and rutile grains usually have a homogeneous Zr distribution. The rutile grains from studied samples in the KazdaÄ Massif are dominated by subchondritic Nb/Ta (11-19) and Zr/Hf ratios (20-33). Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf show positive correlation, which is probably produced by silicate fractionation. The Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf ratios increase with a decrease in Ta and Hf contents. The core of rutile grains are generally characterized by low Nb/Ta ratios of 17-18 whereas the rims exhibit relatively high Nb/Ta ratios of 19-23. Trace element analyses in rutile suggest that these rutile grains were grown from metamorphic fluids. The P-T conditions of meta-gabbros were estimated by both Fe-Mg exchange and Zr-in-rutile thermometers, as well as by the Grt-Hb-Plg-Q geothermobarometer. The temperature range of 639 to 662 Â°C calculated at 9 kbar using the Zr-in-rutile thermometer is comparable with temperature estimates of the Fe-Mg exchange thermometer, which records amphibolite-facies metamorphism of intermediate P-T conditions. The P-T conditions of meta-ophiolitic rocks suggest that they occur as a different separate higher-pressure tectonic slice in the KazdaÄ metamorphic sequence. Amphibolite-facies metamorphism resulted from northward subduction of the Ä°zmir-Ankara branch of the Neo-Tethyan Ocean under the Sakarya Zone. Metamorphism was followed by internal imbrication of the KazdaÄ metamorphic sequence resulting from southerly directed compression during the collision.\n\nPetrotectonics of lawsonite eclogite exhumation: Insights from the Sivrihisar massif, Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDavis, Peter B.\n\n2011-02-01\n\nThe Sivrihisar massif of the TavÅanlÄ± Zone of Turkey is 1 of less than 10 known lawsonite eclogite localities worldwide. Rocks of the Sivrihisar massif consist of eclogite and blueschist in contact with metasedimentary host rocks and record decreasing maximum pressure conditions across three WNW-ESE striking belts from 16-24 kbar in the northern HalilbaÇ§Ä± belt to 14-16 kbar in the KaracaÃ¶ren belt and 8-10 kbar in the Kertek belt. Where present, sodic-amphibole, phengite, chlorite, and quartz define a pervasive S0/S1 foliation; garnet, omphacite, and lawsonite define stretching lineations and kinematic indicators. D1 and D2 structures are similar in the HalilbaÇ§Ä± and KaracaÃ¶ren belts but differ to those in the Kertek belt. D3 structures are uniform across the massif including fibrous calcite that occurs parallel to F3 fold axes. Shear sense indicators from field observations and asymmetric type-I cross girdle of quartz c axes obtained from electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) show top to the south thrusting throughout much of the massif. D1 and D2 structures are interpreted to have formed during exhumation by extrusion along a Ë5Â°C/km gradient. The HalilbaÇ§Ä± and KaracaÃ¶ren belts were juxtaposed possibly as deep as 45 km within the subduction channel and exhumed by the arrival of the Anatolide microcontinent at approximately 70 Ma. Homogeneity of F3 axes and calcite fibers across the massif suggests that assembly occurred at blueschist conditions before exhumation through the aragonite-calcite transition (Ë350Â°C) above 8 kbar.\n\nCrustal structure of the northern Menderes Massif, western Turkey, imaged by joint gravity and magnetic inversion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGessner, Klaus; Gallardo, Luis A.; Wedin, Francis; Sener, Kerim\n\n2016-10-01\n\nIn western Anatolia, the Anatolide domain of the Tethyan orogen is exposed in one of the Earth's largest metamorphic core complexes, the Menderes Massif. The Menderes Massif experienced a two-stage exhumation: tectonic denudation in the footwall of a north-directed Miocene extensional detachment, followed by fragmentation by E-W and NW-SE-trending graben systems. Along the northern boundary of the core complex, the tectonic units of the Vardar-Izmir-Ankara suture zone overly the stage one footwall of the core complex, the northern Menderes Massif. In this study, we explore the structure of the upper crust in the northern Menderes Massif with cross-gradient joint inversion of gravity and aeromagnetic data along a series of 10-km-deep profiles. Our inversions, which are based on gravity and aeromagnetic measurements and require no geological and petrophysical constraints, reveal the salient features of the Earth's upper crust. We image the northern Menderes Massif as a relatively homogenous domain of low magnetization and medium to high density, with local anomalies related to the effect of interspersed igneous bodies and shallow basins. In contrast, both the northern and western boundaries of the northern Menderes Massif stand out as domains where dense mafic, metasedimentary and ultramafic domains with a weak magnetic signature alternate with low-density igneous complexes with high magnetization. With our technique, we are able to delineate Miocene basins and igneous complexes, and map the boundary between intermediate to mafic-dominated subduction-accretion units of the suture zone and the underlying felsic crust of the Menderes Massif. We demonstrate that joint gravity and magnetic inversion are not only capable of imaging local and regional changes in crustal composition, but can also be used to map discontinuities of geodynamic significance such as the Vardar-Izmir-Ankara suture and the West Anatolia Transfer Zone.\n\nUsing Facilities And Potential Of Geothermal Resources In The Canakkale Province - NW Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDeniz, Ozan; Acar Deniz, Zahide\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTurkey, due to its geological location, has a rich potential in point of geothermal resources. Ãanakkale province is located northwestern (NW) part of Turkey and it has important geothermal fields in terms of geothermal energy potential. Geothermal resources reach to the surface both effects of past volcanic activity and extensions of fault zones associated with complex tectonic systems in the region. The aim of this study is to summarize hydrogeochemical characteristics, using facilities and potential of hot springs and spas located in the Ãanakkale province. There are 13 geothermal fields in the region and the surface temperatures of hot springs are ranging between 28 centigrade degree and 175 centigrade degree. Hydrogeochemical compositions of thermal water display variable chemical compositions. Na, Ca, SO4, HCO3 and Cl are the dominant ions in these waters. Thermal waters of Tuzla and Kestanbol geothermal fields which is located the near coastal area can be noted NaCl type. Because these two geothermal waters have high TDS values, scaling problems are seen around the hot springs and pipelines. Geothermal waters in the province are meteoric origin according to oxygen-18, deuterium and tritium isotopes data. Long underground residence times of these waters and its temperatures have caused both more water - rock interaction and low tritium values. Geothermal energy is utilized in many areas in Turkey today. It is generally used for space heating, balneotherapy and electricity generation. Explorations of geothermal resources and investments in geothermal energy sector have risen rapidly in the recent years particularly in western Turkey. High-temperature geothermal fields are generally located in this region related to the Aegean Graben System and the North Anotalian Fault Zone. All geothermal power plants in Turkey are located in this region. Considering the Ãanakkale province, most geothermal fields are suitable for multipurpose usage but many of them have\n\nN-S crustal shear system in the Bundelkhand massif: A unique crustal evolution signature in the northern Indian peninsula\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSingh, S. P.; Bhattacharya, A. R.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Bundelkhand massif, located in the northern part of the Indian shield, is a poly-deformed and poly-metamorphic terrain. This paper reports a new shear system developed throughout the massif in the form of N-S trending quartz veins that are sometimes quartzo-feldspathic and rarely granitic in composition. The veins are vertical and commonly occur in conjugate sets. This tectono-magmatic event appears to represent the youngest shear system of the massif as it cross-cuts all the earlier shear systems (E-W, NE-SE and NW-SE). Emplacement of this N-S vein system may have taken place due to extensional processes that developed some cracks along which siliceous magma was vertically emplaced. The complete absence of signature of the N-S event from the surrounding sedimentary cover of Vindhyan Supergroup, Bijawar and Gwalior Groups suggests that this shear system is pre-tectonic to the nearly E-W trending passive basins developed at the margins of the Bundelkhand craton. Further, several workers have considered the Bundelkhand massif as a part of the Aravalli craton. However, due to the absence of N-S, as well as the other (i.e., E-W, NW-SE and NW-SE), tectonic fabrics of the Bundelkhand massif in other cratons of the Peninsular India, and vice versa, makes the Bundelkhand block a separate and unique craton of its own and is not part of the Aravalli craton.\n\nQuaternary glaciation of the Lato Massif, Zanskar Range of the NW Himalaya\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOrr, Elizabeth N.; Owen, Lewis A.; Saha, Sourav; Caffee, Marc W.; Murari, Madhav K.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe glacial chronostratigraphy and history of the Lato Massif of Zanskar northern India is defined for the first time using geomorphic mapping and 10Be surface exposure dating. Three local glacial stages, the Lato, Shiyul and Kyambu, are dated to 244-49, 25-15 and 3.4-0.2 ka, respectively. The Lato glacial stage was the most extensive period of glaciation, characterized by expanded ice caps with glaciers advancing to â¼16 km from their present position. Large till deposits are associated with this glacial stage, which represent a time of heightened glacial erosion and localized incision, and increased rates of sediment transfer and deposition. The glacial style transitioned to entrenched valley glaciation during the Shiyul glacial stage. Hummocky moraine complexes reflecting fluctuating glacier margins characterize this glaciation. Glaciers have been confined to the cirques and headwalls of the massif during and since the Kyambu glacial stage. Equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) reconstructions help define the shifts in glaciation over time, with ELA depressions changing from 470 Â± 140, 270 Â± 80 to 100 Â± 30 m for the Lato, Shiyul and Kyambu glacial stages, respectively. The change of glacial style during the latter part of the Quaternary is similar to other regions of the Transhimalaya and Tibet suggesting that this pattern of glaciation may reflect regional climatic forcing. The evolution of the Lato Massif from an isolated alpine plateau to a steeply incised massif over the last several glacial-interglacial cycles may have also influenced the shifts from ice cap to valley glaciation.\n\nKinematics of Post-Collisional Extensional Tectonics and Exhumation of the Menderes Massif in the Western Anatolia Extended Terrane, Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCemen, I.; Catlos, E. J.; Diniz, E.; Gogus, O.; Ozerdem, C.; Baker, C.; Kohn, M. J.; Goncuoglu, C.; Hancer, M.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nThe Western Anatolia Extended Terrane in Turkey is one of the best-developed examples of post-collisional extended terranes and contains one of the largest metamorphic core complexes in the world, the Menderes massif. It has experienced a series of continental collisions from the Late Cretaceous to the Eocene as the Neotethys Ocean closed and the Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan suture zone was formed. Based our field work and monazite ages, we suggest that the north-directed postcollisional Cenozoic extension in the region is the product of three consecutive, uninterrupted stages, triggered by three different mechanisms. The first stage was initiated about 30 Ma ago, in the Oligocene by the Orogenic Collapse the thermally weakened continental crust along the north-dipping Southwest Anatolian shear zone. The shear zone was formed as an extensional simple-shear zone with listric geometry at depth and exhibits predominantly normal- slip along its southwestern end. But, it becomes a high-angle oblique-slip shear zone along its northeastern termination. Evidence for the presence of the shear zone includes (1) the dominant top to the north-northeast shear sense indicators throughout the Menderes massif, such as stretching lineations trending N10E to N30E; and (2) a series of Oligocene extensional basins located adjacent to the shear zone that contain only carbonate and ophiolitic rock fragments, but no high grade metamorphic rock fragments. During this stage, erosion and extensional unroofing brought high-grade metamorphic rocks of the central Menderes massif to the surface by the early Miocene. The second stage of the extension was triggered by subduction roll-back and associated back-arc extension in the early Miocene and produced the north-dipping Alasehir and the south-dipping Buyuk Menderes detachments of the central Menderes massif and the north-dipping Simav detachment of the northern Menderes massif. The detachments control the Miocene sedimentation in the Alasehir, Buyuk\n\nLate Cretaceous extensional denudation along a marble detachment fault zone in the KÄ±rÅehir massif near Kaman, central Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLefebvre, CÃ´me; Barnhoorn, Auke; van Hinsbergen, Douwe J. J.; Kaymakci, Nuretdin; Vissers, Reinoud L. M.\n\n2011-08-01\n\nIn the Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex (CACC), 100 km scale metamorphic domains were exhumed in a context of north-south plate convergence during late Cretaceous to Cenozoic times. The timing, kinematics and mechanisms of exhumation have been the focus of previous studies in the southern NiÄde Massif. In this study, we investigate the unexplored northern area regarding the tectonic features preserved on the edges of the KÄ±rÅehir Massif, based on detailed field-mapping in the Kaman area where high-grade metasediments, non-metamorphic ophiolites and monzonitic plutons are locally exposed together. Close to the contact with the ophiolites, west-dipping foliated marble-rich rocks display mylonites and discrete protomylonites with normal shear senses indicating a general top-to-the W-NW direction. Both of these structures have been brittlely overprinted into cataclastic corridors parallel to the main foliation. The mylonite series and superimposed brittle structures together define the Kaman fault zone. The study of the evolution of calcite deformation fabrics along an EW section supported by Electron Back Scattered Diffraction measurements (EBSD) on representative fabrics indicates that the Kaman fault zone represents an extensional detachment. In ÃmerhacÄ±lÄ±, in the vicinity of the BaranadaÄ quartz-monzonite, the metamorphic sequence shows static annealing of the calcite mylonitic fabrics. This evidence suggests that intrusion took place at shallow depth (Ë10 km) into an already exhuming metamorphic sequence. As a consequence for the Kaman area, buried metasediments have been rapidly exhumed between 84 and 74 Ma (Ë1 km/Ma) where exhumation along a detachment zone, displaying a top-to-the W-NW shear motion, took place in the mid to upper crust prior to magmatic intrusion in the late Campanian. As the intrusion cut through the detachment fault, the main shearing deformation ceased. Brittle tectonics coupled with erosion likely took over during the final\n\nEvidence for polymetamorphic garnet growth in the Ãine (southern Menderes) Massif, Western Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaker, C. B.; Catlos, E. J.; Sorensen, S. S.; Ãemen, I.; Hancer, M.\n\n2008-07-01\n\nGarnet-based thermobarometry is often used to develop models for the evolution of the Menderes Massif, a key Aegean metamorphic core complex. Here we present X-ray element maps and high-contrast backscattered electron (BSE) and cathodoluminescence (CL) images from a garnet-bearing rock from the Ãine (southern Menderes) Massif. The images document a polymetamorphic history as plagioclase and garnet grains show distinct cores and rims. The sample contains matrix monazite in reaction with allanite. The garnet in the sample is likely not in equilibrium with its matrix minerals. This is evidenced by BSE images that document compositional variability in both core and rim zoning and tracks of bright streaks extending from rim to core. We propose that some garnet that is now present in the Menderes Massif formed due to collision during Cambro-Ordovician and may have recrystallized during subsequent collisional and extensional events. These processes led to non-equilibrium compositions and can result in spurious pressure-temperature (P-T) calculations. To establish the feasibility of the P-T estimates of rocks from the Ãine Massif for input into tectonic models for the region, more than one sample from single outcrops should be analyzed. Rocks within the Ãine Massif have been suggested to display inverted metamorphism, an increase in T towards structurally higher levels. Based on the garnet documented here, we propose that the inverted metamorphism may be a consequence of apparent P-T rather than a real phenomenon.\n\nStudent Retention in Higher Education in Turkey: A Qualitative Study\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAypay, Ahmet; Cekic, Osman; Boyaci, Adnan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this article is to investigate student perceptions of college departure in three state universities in Turkey. Since the beginning of the 1990s, higher Education System in Turkey went through a massification of higher education. The rapid growth brought enrollment and dropout issues in the system.

Furthermore, This granite is traversed by numerous mineralized sheeted vein systems, which locally transgress into the surrounding metasediments. Therefore, this mineralization closely associated with intense hydrothermal alteration within brecciation, and quartz stockwork veining. The ore mineral assemblage includes chalcopyrite, galena, and some sphalerite with covellite and goethite formed during three phases of mineralization (pre-ore, main ore, and supergene) within an abundant gangue of quartz and calcite. The geologic and field relationships, petrographic and mineralogical studies reveal two alteration zones occurred with the Cu-Pb (-Zn) mineralization along the contact between the Bagcagiz Formation and Duztarla granite; pervasive phyllic alteration (quartz, sericite, and pyrite), and selective propylitic alteration (albite, calcite, epidote, sericite and/or chlorite). This work, by using the mass balance calculations, reports the mass/volume changes (gain and loss) of the chemical components of the hydrothermal alteration zones associated with Halilar Cu-Pb (-Zn) mineralization at Balikesir area (Turkey). It revealed that the phyllic alteration has enrichments of Si, Fe, K, Ba, and LOI with depletion of Mg, Ca, and Na reflect sericitization of alkali feldspar and destruction of ferromagnesian minerals. This zone has high Cu and Pb with Zn contents represents the main mineralized zone. On the other hand, the propylitic zone is characterized by addition of Ca, Na, K, Ti, P, and Ba with LOI and Cu (lower content) referring to the replacement of plagioclase and ferromagnesian minerals by albite, calcite, epidote, and sericite\n\nThe Solarya Volcano-Plutonic Complex (NW Turkey): Petrography, Petrogenesis and Tectonic Implications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÃnal, Alp; KamacÄ±, Ãmer; Altunkaynak, Åafak\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe post collisional magmatic activity produced several volcano-plutonic complexes in NW Anatolia (Turkey) during the late Oligocene- Middle Miocene. One of the major volcano-plutonic complexes, the Solarya volcano-plutonic complex is remarkable for its coeval and cogenetic plutonic (Solarya pluton), hypabysal and volcanic rocks of Early Miocene (24-21 Ma) age. Solarya pluton is an epizonal pluton which discordantly intruded into metamorphic and nonmetamorphic basement rocks of Triassic age. It is a N-S trending magmatic body covering an area of 220 km2,approximatelly 20 km in length and 10 km in width. Based on the field and petrographic studies, three main rock groups distinguished in Solarya pluton; K-feldspar megacrystalline granodiorite, microgranite-granodiorite and haplogranite. Porphyritic and graphic-granophyric textures are common in these three rock groups. Pluton contains magmatic enclaves and syn-plutonic dykes of dioritic composition. Hypabyssal rocks are represented by porphyritic microdiorite and porphyritic quartz-diorite. They form porphyry plugs, sheet inrusions and dykes around the pluton. Porphyrites have microcrystalline-cryptocrystalline groundmass displaying micrographic and granophyric textures. Petrographically similar to the hypabyssal rocks, volcanic rocks are formed from andesitic and dasitic lavas and pyroclastic rocks. Plutonic, hypabyssal and volcanic rocks of Solarya volcano-plutonic complex show similar major-trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions, indicating common magmatic evolution and multicomponent melt sources including mantle and crustal components. They are mainly metaluminous, medium to high-K calc alkaline rocks and display enrichment in LILE and depletion in Nb, Ta, P and Ti. They have initial 87Sr/86Sr values of 0.70701- 0.70818 and 143Nd/144Nd values of 0.51241-0.51250. These geochemical characteristics and isotopic signatures are considered to reflect the composition of the magmas derived from a\n\nDetermination of Bedrock Variations and S-wave Velocity Structure in the NW part of Turkey for Earthquake Hazard Mitigation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOzel, A. O.; Arslan, M. S.; Aksahin, B. B.; Genc, T.; Isseven, T.; Tuncer, M. K.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nTekirdag region (NW Turkey) is quite close to the North Anatolian Fault which is capable of producing a large earthquake. Therefore, earthquake hazard mitigation studies are important for the urban areas close to the major faults. From this point of view, integration of different geophysical methods has important role for theãstudy of seismic hazard problems including seismotectonic zoning. On the other hand, geological mapping and determining the subsurface structure, which is a key to assist management of new developedãareas, conversion of current urban areas or assessment of urban geological hazards can be performed by integrated geophysical methods. This study has been performed in the frame of a national project, which is a complimentary project of the cooperative project between Turkey and Japan (JICA&JST), named as \"Earthquake and Tsunami Disaster Mitigation in the Marmara Region and Disaster Education\". With this principal aim, this study is focused on Tekirdag and its surrounding region (NW of Turkey) where some uncertainties in subsurface knowledge (maps of bedrock depth, thickness of quaternary sediments, basin geometry and seismic velocity structure,) need to be resolved. Several geophysical methods (microgravity, magnetic and single station and array microtremor measurements) are applied and the results are evaluated to characterize lithological changes in the region. Array microtremor measurements with several radiuses are taken in 30 locations and 1D-velocity structures of S-waves are determined by the inversion of phase velocities of surface waves, and the results of 1D structures are verified by theoretical Rayleigh wave modelling. Following the array measurements, single-station microtremor measurements are implemented at 75 locations to determine the predominant frequency distribution. The predominant frequencies in the region range from 0.5 Hz to 8 Hz in study area. On the other hand, microgravity and magnetic measurements are performed on\n\nThe Triassic reworking of the Yunkai massif (South China): EMP monazite and U-Pb zircon geochronologic evidence\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Cheng-Hong; Liu, Yung-Hsin; Lee, Chi-Yu; Sano, Yuji; Zhou, Han-Wen; Xiang, Hua; Takahata, Naoto\n\n2017-01-01\n\nGeohistory of the Yunkai massif in South China Block is important in understanding the geodynamics for the build-up of this block during the Phanerozoic orogenies. To investigate this massif, we conduct EMP monazite and U-Pb zircon geochronological determinations on mineral inclusions and separate for seventeen samples in four groups, representing metamorphic rocks from core domain, the Gaozhou Complex (amphibolite facies, NE-striking) and the Yunkai Group (greenschist facies, NW-striking) of this massif and adjacent undeformed granites. Some EMP monazite ages are consistent with the NanoSIMS results. Monazite inclusions, mostly with long axis parallel to the cleavage of platy and elongated hosts, give distinguishable age results for NW- and NE-trending deformations at 244-236 Ma and 236-233 Ma, respectively. They also yield ages of 233-230 Ma for core domain gneissic granites and 232-229 Ma for undefomed granites. Combining U-Pb zircon ages of the same group, 245 Ma and 230 Ma are suggested to constrain the time of two phases of deformation. Aside from ubiquity of Triassic ages in studied rocks, ages of detrital monazite in the meta-sandstone match the major U-Pb zircon age clusters of the metamorphic rock that are largely concentrated at Neoproterozoic (1.0-0.9 Ga) and Early Paleozoic (444-431 Ma). Based on these geochronological data, Triassic is interpreted as representing the time for recrystallization of these host minerals on the Early Paleozoic protolith, and the also popular Neoproterozoic age is probably inherited. With this context, Yunkai massif is regarded as a strongly reactivated Triassic metamorphic terrain on an Early Paleozoic basement which had incorporated sediments with Neoproterozoic provenances. Triassic tectonic evolution of the Yunkai massif is suggested to have been controlled by converging geodynamics of the South China and Indochina Blocks as well as mafic magma emplacement related to the Emeishan large igneous province (E-LIP).\n\nUsing SHRIMP zircon dating to unravel tectonothermal events in arc environments. The early Palaeozoic arc of NW Iberia revisited\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nAbati, J.; Castineiras, P.G.; Arenas, R.; Fernandez-Suarez, J.; Barreiro, J.G.; Wooden, J.L.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nDating of zircon cores and rims from granulites developed in a shear zone provides insights into the complex relationship between magmatism and metamorphism in the deep roots of arc environments. The granulites belong to the uppermost allochthonous terrane of the NW Iberian Massif, which forms part of a Cambro-Ordovician magmatic arc developed in the peri-Gondwanan realm. The obtained zircon ages confirm that voluminous calc-alkaline magmatism peaked around 500Ma and was shortly followed by granulite facies metamorphism accompanied by deformation at c. 480Ma, giving a time framework for crustal heating, regional metamorphism, deformation and partial melting, the main processes that control the tectonothermal evolution of arc systems. Traces of this arc can be discontinuously followed in different massifs throughout the European Variscan Belt, and we propose that the uppermost allochthonous units of the NW Iberian Massif, together with the related terranes in Europe, constitute an independent and coherent terrane that drifted away from northern Gondwana prior to the Variscan collisional orogenesis. ?? 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\n\nThe Galicia-Ossa-Morena Zone: Proposal for a new zone of the Iberian Massif. Variscan implications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArenas, Ricardo; DÃ­ez FernÃ¡ndez, RubÃ©n; Rubio Pascual, Francisco J.; SÃ¡nchez MartÃ­nez, Sonia; MartÃ­n Parra, Luis Miguel; Matas, JerÃ³nimo; GonzÃ¡lez del TÃ¡nago, JosÃ©; JimÃ©nez-DÃ­az, Alberto; Fuenlabrada, Jose M.; Andonaegui, Pilar; Garcia-Casco, Antonio\n\n2016-06-01\n\nCorrelation of a group of allochthonous terranes (referred to as basal, ophiolitic and upper units) exposed in the NW and SW of the Iberian Massif, is used to propose a new geotectonic zone in the southern branch of the Variscan Orogen: the Galicia-Ossa-Morena Zone. Recent advances in SW Iberia identify most of the former Ossa-Morena Zone as another allochthonous complex of the Iberian Massif, the Ossa-Morena Complex, equivalent to the Cabo Ortegal, Ãrdenes, Malpica-Tui, BraganÃ§a and Morais complexes described in NW Iberia. The new geotectonic zone and its counterparts along the rest of the Variscan Orogen constitute an Internal Variscan Zone with ophiolites and units affected by high-P metamorphism. The Galicia-Ossa-Morena Zone includes a Variscan suture and pieces of continental crust bearing the imprint of Ediacaran-Cambrian events related to the activity of peri-Gondwanan magmatic arcs (Cadomian orogenesis). In the Iberian Massif, the general structure of this geotectonic zone represents a duplication of the Gondwanan platform, the outboard sections being juxtaposed on top of domains located closer to the mainland before amalgamation. This interpretation offers an explanation that overcomes some issues regarding the differences between the stratigraphic and paleontological record of the central and southern sections of the Iberian Massif. Also, equivalent structural relationships between other major geotectonic domains of the rest of the Variscan Orogen are consistent with our interpretation and allow suspecting similar configurations along strike of the orogen. A number of issues may be put forward in this respect that potentially open new lines of thinking about the architecture of the Variscan Orogen.\n\nStructural and kinematic evolution of a Miocene to Recent sinistral restraining bend: the Montejunto massif, Portugal\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCurtis, Michael L.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe Montejunto massif lies in the apex of a large-scale restraining bend at the southern termination of a sinistral transpressive fault system, in the Lusitanian basin of Portugal. Cenozoic deformation within the Montejunto massif initiated with southerly directed thrusting along the southern boundary of the massif, in association with the development of the E-W oriented Montejunto anticline, probably during the Langhian. Deformation switched to the northern boundary of the massif, in association with a change to NW-directed thrusting and continued development of the Montejunto anticline. The youngest set of structures within the massif is related to the sinistral reactivation of the Arieiro fault system, and steeply inclined bedding. This late phase of deformation represents the accommodation of a component of sinistral displacement across the restraining bend along mechanical anisotropies formed during this progressive Cenozoic deformation event. Variation in the kinematic style of the Main Arieiro fault is related to the angle ( Î±) between the fault plane and the displacement vector. Where Î±â20Â°, abrupt pene-contemporaneous switches in displacement direction are recorded along the fault, whereas strike-slip kinematics predominate where Î±<20Â°. The timing of deformation events in the Montejunto massif is uncertain. However, correlation with the established Cenozoic Africa/Europe plate convergence directions may provide potential temporal constraints.\n\nLate Mesoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic history of metamorphic basement from the southeastern Chiapas Massif Complex, Mexico, and implications for the evolution of NW Gondwana\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWeber, Bodo; GonzÃ¡lez-GuzmÃ¡n, ReneÃ©; Manjarrez-JuÃ¡rez, RomÃ¡n; Cisneros de LeÃ³n, Alejandro; Martens, Uwe; Solari, Luigi; Hecht, Lutz; Valencia, Victor\n\n2018-02-01\n\nthe amphibolite have E-MORB characteristics and were derived from a depleted mantle source younger than the Rodinia-type basement. Inasmuch as similar amphibolites also occur in the Ediacaran metasedimentary rocks as dykes or lenses, Late Neoproterozoic magmatism in a rift setting is suggested. Hence, the geologic record of the El Triunfo Complex includes evidences for Rodinia assemblage, Tonian circum-Rodinia subduction, and breakup during the Late Neoproterozoic. Metamorphism, and partial melting are interpreted in terms of a convergent margin setting during the Ordovician. The results place the southern Chiapas Massif along with Oaxaquia and similar Northern Andes terranes on the NW margin of Gondwana interpreted as the extension of the Famatinian orogen that evolved during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean.\n\nLinking microcracks and mineral zoning of detachment-exhumed granites to their tectonomagmatic history: Evidence from the Salihli and Turgutlu plutons in western Turkey (Menderes Massif)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCatlos, Elizabeth J.; Baker, Courteney B.; Sorensen, Sorena S.; Jacob, Lauren; Ãemen, Ibrahim\n\n2011-05-01\n\nThe Menderes Massif (western Turkey) is a metamorphic core complex that displays linked syntectonic plutonism and detachment faulting. Fabrics in S-type peraluminous granites (Salihli and Turgutlu) in the detachment (AlaÅehir) footwall change from isotropic to protomylonitic to mylonitic towards the structure. Samples from the isotropic and protomylonitic zones were imaged in transmitted light, cathodoluminescence (CL), backscattered (BSE), and secondary electrons (SE), and show that these rocks contain abundant microcracks, and that plagioclase grains have zoning consistent with magma mixing. The granites contain fluid inclusion planes (FIPs), myrmekite replacing plagioclase, and the removal of blue luminescence in K-feldspar along microcracks and grain boundaries. Calcite and hydrous minerals commonly fill microcracks. The samples record features that formed due to (1) magma crystallization and ductile deformation (FIPs, mineral zoning), (2) changes in P and/or T (impingement and stress-induced microcracks in protomylonitic rocks), and (3) differences in intrinsic mineral properties (radial, cleavage, blunted, and deflected microcracks). Overprinted microcracks indicate exhumation during pulses. The Middle Miocene ages of these granites reported elsewhere are similar to those from large-scale extensional structures in Greece's Cycladic Massif. The Menderes and Cycladic core complexes may have developed simultaneously due to the widespread intrusion of subduction-related granitoids.\n\nConstraining the deformation and exhumation history of the Ronda Massif, Southern Spain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMyall, Jack; Donaldson, Colin\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe Ronda peridotite, southern Spain is comprised of four peridotite units hosted within metasedimentary units of the Betic Cordillera, Western Alps. These four areas of differing mineral facies are termed: the Garnet Mylonite , the Foliated Spinel Peridotite, the Granular Spinel Peridotite and the Foliated Plagioclase Peridotite. Whilst two of these units show a strong NE-SW foliation, the granular unit has no foliation and the Plagioclase facies shows a NW-SE foliation. The massif is separated from the metasedimentary host through a mylonite shear zone to the NW and thrust faults to the SE. The Garnets contain rims of Kelyphite which when combined with the rims of Spinel on the Plagioclase crystals illustrate the complicated exhumation of this massif. The Kelyphite shows the breakdown of garnet back to spinel and pyroxene showing the deeper high pressure high temperature mineral is under shallowing conditions whereas in contrast to this the low pressure low temperature plagioclase crystals have spinel rims showing that they have been moved into deeper conditions. The P-T-t pathway of the massif suggests slow exhumation to allow for partial recrystallisation of not only the garnets and plagioclases but of a 100m band of peridotite between the Foliated Spinel Peridotite and the Granular Spinel Peridotite facies. The tectonic model for the Ronda Peridotite that best describes the field data and subsequent lab work of this study is Mantle Core complex and slab roll back models. These models support mantle uprising during an extensional event that whereby slab roll back of the subducting lithosphere provides uplift into a void and emplacement into the crust. Further extension and final exhumation causes rotation of a mantle wedge into its present day position.\n\nSuccessive post-Variscan stress fields in the French Massif Central and its borders (Western European plate): comparison with geodynamic data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBlÃ©s, J. L.; Bonijoly, D.; Castaing, C.; Gros, Y.\n\n1989-11-01\n\nStructural analysis and particularly microtectonic methods have made it possible to define the different stages of brittle deformation of the Massif Central basement and the surrounding sedimentary cover from the end of the Hercynian orogeny to the end of the Tertiary. During the Stephanian a compressional tectonic regime prevailed: regional faults appeared or were react vated reactivation as a result of initial N-S compression, becoming NW then E-W. These regional strike-slip faults caused local extension which led to the formation of small coal-bearing basins. This compressional regime, which marked the end of the formation of Pangea. was followed by a series of extension episodes: Permian-Triassic extension oscillating around N-S. E-W to NW-SE extension in the Early and Middle Jurassic and finally N-S to NE-SW extension in the Late Jurassic to Cretaceous. The normal faults formed during these episodes strongly influenced the distribution of emerging continents and sedimentary basins. From the Campanian (75 Ma) to the Present, the convergence of Africa and Eurasia involved the distribut on of stresses in the West European plate. Several tectonic episodes are distinguished in the Massif Central. During the Eocene approximately N-S compression predominated. General E-W extension in the Late Eocene-Oligocene resulted in grabens with general northerly strike, mainly in the centre of the Massif Central and on its east and southeast borders. Lastly, compression, varying from NW-SE to E-W, in the north and south of the Massif Central, prevailed during the Alpine orogenic phase at the end of the Miocene. These successive stages of brittle deformation are interpreted in the context of the evolution of the West European plate and its displacement in relation to the African plate. The correspondences between the major geodynamic periods and the distribution of stresses over the West European continent are noted as well as the problems which remair to be resolved.\n\nThermochronology and tectonics of the MÃ©rida Andes and the Santander Massif, NW South America\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan der Lelij, Roelant; Spikings, Richard; Mora, AndrÃ©s\n\n2016-04-01\n\nNew apatite U-Pb and multiphase 40Ar/39Ar data constrain the high to medium temperature ( 500 Â°C- 300 Â°C) thermal histories of igneous and metamorphic rocks exposed in the MÃ©rida Andes of Venezuela, and new apatite and zircon fission track data constrain the 500 Â°C- 60 Â°C thermal histories of pre-Jurassic igneous and metamorphic rocks of the adjacent Santander Massif of Colombia. Computed thermal history envelopes using apatite U-Pb dates and grain size information from an Early Palaeozoic granodiorite in the MÃ©rida Andes suggest that it cooled from > 500 Â°C to < 350 Â°C between 266 Ma and 225 Ma. Late Permian to Triassic cooling is also recorded in Early Palaeozoic granitoids and metasedimentary rocks in the MÃ©rida Andes by numerous new muscovite and biotite 40Ar/39Ar plateau dates spanning 257.1 Â± 1.0 Ma to 205.1 Â± 0.8 Ma. This episode of cooling is not recognised in the Santander Massif, where 40Ar/39Ar data suggest that some Early Palaeozoic rocks cooled below 320 Â°C in the Early Palaeozoic. However, most data from pre-Jurassic rocks reveal a regional heat pulse at 200 Ma during the intrusion of numerous shallow granitoids, resulting in temperatures in excess of 520 Â°C, obscuring late Palaeozoic histories. The generally accepted timing of amalgamation of Pangaea along the Ouachita-Marathon suture pre-dates Late Permian to Triassic cooling recorded in basement rocks of the MÃ©rida Andes by > 30 Ma, and its effect on rocks preserved in north-western South America is unknown. We interpret late Permian to Triassic cooling in the MÃ©rida Andes to be driven by exhumation. Previous studies have suggested that a short phase of shortening and anatexis is recorded at 253 Ma in the Maya Block, which may have been adjacent to the basement rocks of the MÃ©rida Andes in the Late Permian. The coeval onset of exhumation in the MÃ©rida Andes may be a result of increased coupling in the magmatic arc, which was located along the western margin of Pangaea.

Here, we present new textural analysis and in situ U-(Th)-Pb titanite dating from selected samples collected in the transition from the undeformed to the mylonitized zones of the Salihli granodiorite at the footwall of the Neogene, ductile-to-brittle, top-to-the-NNE Gediz-AlaÅheir (GDF) detachment fault. Ductile shearing was accompanied by the fluid-mediated sub-solidus transformation of the granodiorite to orthogneiss, which occurred at shallower crustal levels and temperatures compatible with the upper greenschist-to-amphibolite facies metamorphic conditions (530-580 Â°C and P < 2 GPa). The syn-tectonic metamorphic overgrowth of REE-poor titanite on pristine REE-rich igneous titanite offers the possibility to constrain the timing of magma crystallisation and solid-state shearing at the footwall of the Gediz detachment. The common Pb corrected 206Pb/238U (206Pb*/238U) ages and the REE re-distribution in titanite that spatially correlates with the Th/U zoning suggests that titanite predominantly preserve open-system ages during fluid-assisted syn-tectonic re-crystallisation in the transition from magma crystallization and emplacement (at 16-17 Ma) to the syn-tectonic, solid-state shearing (at 14-15 Ma). A minimum time lapse of ca. 1-2 Ma is then inferred between the crustal emplacement of the Salihli granodiorite and nucleation of the ductile extensional shearing along the Gediz detachment. The reconstruction of the cooling history of the Salihli granodiorite documents a punctuated evolution dominated by two episodes of rapid cooling, between 14 Ma and 12 Ma ( 100 Â°C/Ma) and between 3 and 2 Ma ( 105 Â°C/Ma). We relate the first episode to nucleation and development of post-emplacement of ductile shearing along the GDF and the second to brittle high-angle faulting, respectively.

Measurements of the elevation have fluctuated over the years, from its earliest surveyed elevation of 5140 m (16,859 ft), to its present height. Vinson Massif and three of its near neighbors in the Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth Mountains are the highest peaks in Antarctica, making them a favorite objective of mountaineers. Well over 1,100 people have climbed Vinson since the first ascent by a team in the 1966-67 austral summer. The range is composed of Crashsite quartzite, making the Sentinelâs very resistant to erosion. Very accurate elevations have been achieved annually by GPS mapping done by a climbing team sponsored by the Omega Foundation, active in Antarctica since 1998. The Craddock Massif now includes Mt. Craddock, the ninth highest peak in Antarctica, at 4368 m (14,327 ft). Both are named for Campbell Craddock*, a U.S. geologist active in Antarctic research beginning in 1959-60.\n\nKondyor Massif, Russia\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2008-02-19\n\nThe Kondyor Massif is located in Eastern Siberia, Russia, north of the city of Khabarovsk.

A large amount of the extension was accommodated by the two oppositely dipping Gediz and BÃ¼yÃ¼k Menderes detachment faults, which led to the exhumation of the central Menderes Massif (Gessner et al., 2013). Previous studies proposed a synchronous, bivergent exhumation of the central Menderes Massif since the Miocene (Gessner et al., 2001), although only the evolution of the north-dipping Gediz detachment is well constrained (Buscher et al., 2013). Detailed structural and thermochronological investigations from the south-dipping BÃ¼yÃ¼k Menderes detachment have still been missing. Here we present results from different thermochronometers, which constrain the cooling and exhumation history of footwall and hanging wall rocks of the BÃ¼yÃ¼k Menderes detachment. Our new zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He and fission track ages of footwall rocks from the BÃ¼yÃ¼k Menderes detachment document two phases of increased cooling and exhumation (WÃ¶lfler et al., in revision). The first episode of increased footwall exhumation ( 0.9 km/Myr) occurred during the middle Miocene, followed by a second phase during latest Miocene and Pliocene ( 1.0 km/Myr). Apatite fission track ages yield a slip rate for the Pliocene movement along the BÃ¼yÃ¼k Menderes detachment of 3.0 (+1.1/-0.6) km/Myr. Thermochronological data of hanging wall units reflect a slow phase of exhumation ( 0.2 km/Myr) in the late Oligocene and an increased exhumation rate of 1.0 km/Myr during the early to middle Miocene, when hanging wall units cooled below 80 Â°C. In comparison with the Gediz detachment, our thermochronological data from the BÃ¼yÃ¼k Menderes detachment confirms the concurrent activity of both detachments during the late Miocene and Pliocene. With respect to the relative importance of normal faulting and erosion to rock exhumation, a comparison with 10Be\n\nMonitoring of Landslides using Repeated Kinematics GPS Observables in Sevketiye Town, Biga Peninsula, Ãanakkale, NW Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCuneyt Erenoglu, Ramazan; Akcay, Ozgun; Karaca, Zeki; Erenoglu, Oya; Sengul Uluocak, Ebru; Yucel, Mehmet Ali\n\n2014-05-01\n\nLandslide is one of the most important natural events, and is also a result of earth's crust movements. Landslides generally result in the outward and downward movement of slope-forming materials consisting soil, rock, artificial fill and etc. Moreover, possible earthquakes are one of the main reasons of triggering landslides in active areas seismically. There have been many studies based on the Global Positioning System (GPS) observables to compute the three dimensional positioning of established sites, and to model landslides precisely. We can monitor landslide with GPS using continuous data collection or the type of campaign surveying. While continuous data collection provide a millimetre-level of accuracy, the accuracy decreases with the shorter sessions, e.g. campaign surveying, due to possible sources of error. The area, located west of the Ãanakkale, has been studied to identify the landslide susceptibility and geology. Ãanakkale, NW Turkey, is located on the territory of the Biga Peninsula and the Gallipoli Peninsula. The section of remaining at the west of the line from the Gulf of Edremit to the Gulf of Erdek is called Biga Peninsula, and it covers an area of approximately 10 thousand kmÂ². In the Biga Peninsula, the main morphological units are at the western, northern and southern of coastal plains, and on their behind the hills, plateaus and mountainous areas of the inland. But at the middle areas, it is often possible to find the tectonic depressions sandwiched between the masses plateau and mountainous. In general, moving down the slope of a rock, soil or debris can be defined as landslides that are ranks second in terms of caused losses after earthquakes in Turkey. Landslides, harm to urbanization as well as loss of lives and economic losses. Moreover they adversely affects to agricultural, forest areas and the quality of the rivers.

To cope with this problem, we must determine which areas are erosion-prone. Many studies have been carried out and different models and methods have been used to this end. In this study, we used a logistic regression to prepare an erosion susceptibility map for the AyvalÄ±k region in BalÄ±kesir (NW Turkey). The following were our assessment parameters: weathering grades of rocks, slope gradient, structural lineament density, drainage density, land cover, stream power index (SPI) and profile curvature. These were processed by Idrisi Kilimanjaro GIS software. We used logistic regression analysis to relate predictor variables to the occurrence or non-occurrence of gully erosion sites within geographic cells, and then we used this relationship to produce a probability map for future erosion sites. The results indicate that lineament density, weathering grades of rocks and drainage density are the most important variables governing erosion susceptibility. Other variables, such as land cover and slope gradient, were revealed as secondary important variables. Highly weathered basalt, andesite, basaltic andesite and lacustrine sediments were the units most susceptible to erosion. In order to calculate the prediction accuracy of the erosion susceptibility map generated, we compared it with the map showing the gully erosion areas. On the basis of this comparison, the area under curvature (AUC) value was found to be 0.81. This result suggests that the erosion susceptibility map we generated is accurate.\n\nGeological mapping of the Rainbow Massif, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 36Â°14'N\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIldefonse, B.; Fouquet, Y.; HoisÃ©, E.; Dyment, J.; Gente, P.; Thibaud, R.; Bissessur, D.; Yatheesh, V.; Momardream 2008 Scientific Party*, T.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe Rainbow hydrothermal field at 36Â°14'N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is one of the few known sites hosted in ultramafic basement. The Rainbow Massif is located along the non-transform offset between the AMAR and South AMAR second-order ridge segments, and presents the characteristic dome morphology of oceanic core complexes, although no corrugated surface has been observed so far. One of the objectives of Cruises MOMAR DREAM (July 2007, R/V Pourquoi Pas ?; Aug-Sept 2008, R/V Atalante) was to study the petrological and structural context of the hydrothermal system at the scale of the Rainbow Massif. Our geological sampling complements previous ones achieved during Cruises FLORES (1997) and IRIS (2001), and consisted in dredge hauls, and submersible dives by manned submersible Nautile and ROV Victor. The tectonics of the Rainbow Massif is dominated by a N-S trending fault pattern on the western flank of the massif, and a series of SW-NW ridges on its northeastern side. The active hydrothermal site is located in the area were these two systems crosscut. The most abundant recovered rock type is peridotite (harzburgite and dunite) that presents a variety of serpentinization styles and intensity, and a variety of deformation styles (commonly undeformed, sometimes displaying ductile or brittle foliations). Serpentinites are frequently oxidized. Some peridotite samples have melt impregnation textures. Massive chromitite was recovered in one dredge haul. Variously evolved gabbroic rocks were collected as discrete samples or as centimeter to decimeter-thick dikes in peridotites. Basalts and fresh basaltic glass were also sampled in talus and sediments on the southwestern and northeastern flanks of the massif. Our sampling is consistent with the lithological variability encountered in oceanic core complexes along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Southwest Indian Ridge. The stockwork of the hydrothermal system has been sampled on the western side of the present-day hydrothermal\n\nFethiye-Burdur Fault Zone (SW Turkey): a myth?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaymakci, Nuretdin; Langereis, Cornelis; Ãzkaptan, Murat; Ãzacar, Arda A.; GÃ¼lyÃ¼z, Erhan; Uzel, Bora; SÃ¶zbilir, Hasan\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFethiye Burdur Fault Zone (FBFZ) is first proposed by Dumont et al. (1979) as a sinistral strike-slip fault zone as the NE continuation of Pliny-Strabo trench in to the Anatolian Block. The fault zone supposed to accommodate at least 100 km sinistral displacement between the Menderes Massif and the BeydaÇ§larÄ± platform during the exhumation of the Menderes Massif, mainly during the late Miocene. Based on GPS velocities Barka and Reilinger (1997) proposed that the fault zone is still active and accommodates sinistral displacement. In order to test the presence and to unravel its kinematics we have conducted a rigorous paleomagnetic study containing more than 3000 paleomagnetic samples collected from 88 locations and 11700 fault slip data collected from 198 locations distributed evenly all over SW Anatolia spanning from Middle Miocene to Late Pliocene. The obtained rotation senses and amounts indicate slight (around 20Â°) counter-clockwise rotations distributed uniformly almost whole SW Anatolia and there is no change in the rotation senses and amounts on either side of the FBFZ implying no differential rotation within the zone. Additionally, the slickenside pitches and constructed paleostress configurations, along the so called FBFZ and also within the 300 km diameter of the proposed fault zone, indicated that almost all the faults, oriented parallel to subparallel to the zone, are normal in character. The fault slip measurements are also consistent with earthquake focal mechanisms suggesting active extension in the region. We have not encountered any significant strike-slip motion in the region to support presence and transcurrent nature of the FBFZ. On the contrary, the region is dominated by extensional deformation and strike-slip components are observed only on the NW-SE striking faults which are transfer faults that accommodated extension and normal motion. Therefore, we claim that the sinistral Fethiye Burdur Fault (Zone) is a myth and there is no tangible\n\nThe Nahuel Niyeu basin: A Cambrian forearc basin in the eastern North Patagonian Massif\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGreco, Gerson A.; GonzÃ¡lez, Santiago N.; Sato, Ana M.; GonzÃ¡lez, Pablo D.; Basei, Miguel A. S.; LlambÃ­as, Eduardo J.; Varela, Ricardo\n\n2017-11-01\n\nEarly Paleozoic basement of the eastern North Patagonian Massif includes low- and high grade metamorphic units, which consist mainly of alternating paraderived metamorphic rocks (mostly derived from siliciclastic protoliths) with minor intercalations of orthoderived metamorphic rocks. In this contribution we provide a better understanding of the tectonic setting in which the protoliths of these units were formed, which adds to an earlier suggested idea. With this purpose, we studied the metasedimentary rocks of the low-grade Nahuel Niyeu Formation from the Aguada Cecilio area combining mapping and petrographic analysis with U-Pb geochronology and characterization of detrital zircon grains. The results and interpretations of this unit, together with published geological, geochronological and geochemical information, allow us to interpret the sedimentary and igneous protoliths of all metamorphic units from the massif as formed in a forearc basin at â¼520-510 Ma (Nahuel Niyeu basin). It probably was elongated in the â¼NW-SE direction, and would have received detritus from a proximal source area situated toward its northeastern side (present coordinates). The basin might be related to an extensional tectonic regime. Most likely source rocks were: (1) 520-510 Ma, acidic volcanic rocks (an active magmatic arc), (2) â¼555->520 Ma, acidic plutonic and volcanic rocks (earlier stages of the same arc), and (3) latest Ediacaran-Terreneuvian, paraderived metamorphic rocks (country rocks of the arc). We evaluate the Nahuel Niyeu basin considering the eastern North Patagonian Massif as an autochthonous part of South America, adding to the discussion of the origin of Patagonia.\n\nThe ~2.4 Ga granitoids in the Quanji Massifï¼NW China: Petrogenesis and Implication for the early Paleoproterozoic Tectonics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGong, S.; Chen, N.; Wang, Q.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe 2.4-2.2 Ga collision-related magmatism had once been considered to be weak or lacking, and were interpreted to represent the stagnation and deceleration of plate subduction. However, large-scale intermediate to acid intrusions at 2.4-2.2 Ga are widely reported in the Trans-North China Orogen and Tarim Craton, NW China. Here we presented geochronological and geochemical and Nd-Hf isotopic studies of the Hudesheng and Delingha granitoids in the Quanji Massif, which could shed new light on the NW China and global tectonics in the Paleoproterozoic. The two granitoids are exposed in the eastern and central parts of the Quanji Massif, showing similar rock types and including mainly the syenogranitic, monzogranitic and adamellitic gneisses, with ~2.41 Ga low P/T-type amphibolite enclaves. They were formed at 2.37-2.39 Ga and underwent medium P/T-type amphibolite-facies metamorphism at ~1.95-1.90 Ga. Both granitoids have relatively high Si, K contents and FeO*/Mg, 104Ga/Al ratios, and are characterized by a relative enrichment in LILEs and LREEs, but depletion in Ba, Sr, Eu and Nb. These signatures are similar to those of the high-K calc-alkaline I-type granites, and with some geochemical features of A-type granites as well, suggesting that their formation might be related to a post-collisional setting with transition from compression to extension regimes at ~2.4 Ga. The whole-rock Nd and zircon Hf isotopes suggest important crustal growth occurred at ~2.5-2.8 Ga, and the precursor magmas of both granitoids were derived from partial melting of the Neo-Archean juvenile and ancient crustal components. Collectively, the ~2.37-2.39 Ga magmatic activities in the Quanji Massif took place right after arc-related metamorphism and arc-continent collision, thus probably making up part of the arc-related ~2.4-2.2 Ga magmatic activities, including those in the Trans-North China Orogen and Tarim Craton, NW China. This implies that a prolonged strong subduction\n\nHydrogeological, Hydrogeochemical and Isotope Geochemical Features of the Geothermal Waters in Seferihisar and Environs, Western Anatolia, Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÃzgÃ¼r, Nevzat; Aras Pala, Ebru; Degirmenci, Saliha\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe study area of Seferihisar is located within the Izmir-Ankara suture in the NW of the Menderes Massif in western Anatolia, Turkey. The Paleozoic metamorphic rocks of the Menderes Massif form the basement rocks in the area which are overlain by 760 m thick Izmir-flysch series consisting of metamorphic rocks, limestones and ultrabasic rocks tectonically. The Pliocene BahÃ§ecik formation which consists of an alternation of conglomerates, sandstones, claystones, lignite and limestones and shows a thickness of 300 m overlies the (Ä°zmir) flysch series discordantly. This is overlain by 430 m thick YenikÃ¶y formation composed of conglomerates, sandstones, claystones and clayey limestones discordantly. The Miocene volcanic rocks of CumaovasÄ± overlie the YenikÃ¶y formation concordantly which are overlain by alluvium and travertine deposits. Geothermal waters which are observed in the localities of Tuzla, CumalÄ±, DoÄanbey and KarakoÃ§ are associated with NE-SW trending faults in the area. The geothermal waters in the area are considered as Na-Cl or Na-Cl-HCO3 type waters. The geothermal waters of Seferihisar and environs are identified to be Na+K>Ca>Mg dominant cations and Cl>HCO3>SO4 dominant anions. According to the diagram of Na/100-K/100-âMg, a certainly part of the thermal waters can be considered as equilibrated thermal waters during some waters are of immature waters. According to the results of geochemical thermometers, the reservoir temperatures of thermal waters range from 150 to 240Â°C. The Î´2H values of thermal waters are between -13,3 to -31,9, while Î´18O values range from -2,55 to -5,70. The tritium contents of thermal waters are between 13 to 64Â±10 TU.\n\nThe Nature and Subsurface Geometry of Late Holocene Coquina Rocks, Karaburun-Istanbul, NW Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEkinci, Y. L.; Demirci, A.; Erginal, A. E.; Kaya, H.; Ekinci, R.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe so-called coquina defines moderately to hardly amalgamated shell debris by calcium carbonate cement. Even though its some depositional features are similar to intertidal beachrocks and carbonate-cemented dune rocks or eolianites, coquina occurs in shoal environments and is, in some cases, representative of tectonically uplifted coasts when it exposes remarkably above sea-level. In this study (supported financially by the Research Foundation of Ãanakkale Onsekiz Mart University under project number COMUBAP: 2011/41), we discuss diagenetic features, radiocarbon age and subsurface geometry of coquina on Black Sea coast of Istanbul, NW Turkey, where such a Late Holocene occurrence has not been recorded so far. Having a visible thickness of 1 m, the coquina beds crop out on a slightly inclined wide beach formed mostly of shell fragments less than 5 cm in size. It contains calcite and aragonite as connective cement and broken or unbroken shells of Donacilla sp., Pecten glaucum and Ostrea edulis together with various foraminifera such as Elphidium macellum Ammonia compacta and coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi. Radiocarbon ages from four bulk samples yielded calibrated ages ranging between 3.7 and 2.8 ka BP. Electrical resistivity tomography survey along three distinct transects perpendicular to the coastline were carried out in order to understand the thickness of coquina and its subsurface extensions along the beach. The apparent resistivity data were acquired along the survey lines of 21 electrodes with electrode spacing of 2 m, to give a total length of the line of 40 m. Dipole-dipole electrode configuration was used for 9 data levels. Topographic changes at the locations of each electrode points were determined by means of optical leveling technique for a more accurate calculation and interpretation. Apparent resistivity data were inverted by using 2D smoothness-constrained least squares algorithm. Similar electrical resistivity tomograms were obtained for three\n\nPalaeoecological construction from the Oligo-Miocene coal deposits of Gelibolu Peninsula, NW Turkey.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDemirtaÅ, Ferdi; KoÅun, Erdal; Serkan Akkiraz, Mehmet; Bozcu, Mustafa; KoÃ§, Koray\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe palynomorph composition of the Upper Oligocene and Miocene coal deposits from Gelibolu peninsula, NW Turkey, was analyzed to determine the palaeoclimate conditions. The samples were collected from two different abandoned coal mines. Also two different palynological assemblages were reported. The first one belongs to the Late Oligocene (Osmancik Formation). The other one is the Miocene (Gazhanedere Formation). The Late Oligocene palynological assemblage consist mainly of Alnus, Myricaceae, Cyrillaceae-Clethraceae, Calamus and Castanea. Riparian vegetation or wetland forest community incorporate high amounts of Alnus, and low percentages of deciduous Salix, Pterocarya and Carya. Calamus, which is a stratigraphical marker for the Late Oligocene of the Thrace Basin, was also recorded in high quantities. The content of the Miocene palynological assemblage is different from the Late Oligocene assemblage, and is mainly made up of Polypodiaceae, Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Myricaceae, Oleaceae, Cyrillaceae-Clethraceae and Sapotaceae. Calamus and Alnus totally disappear here. In contrast, open vegetation elements such Poaceae and Chenopodiaceae occur frequently. The palaeoclimate calculations were made by the help of coexistence approach method. The late Oligocene association contains a total of 18 taxa, 11 of which were used for calculating the coexistence intervals. The values obtained 15.6 to 21.1 Â° C for annual temperature, 5.0 to 13.3 Â° C for winter temperature, 24.7 to 28.1 Â° C for summer temperature and, 1096 to 1355 mm annual rainfall. In the Miocene palynological assemblage 23 taxa were identified. The palaeoclimate calculation is based on the 21 taxa. Quantitative data indicate the values for the mean annual temperature 15.6-21.3 Â° C, for the winter temperature 5.0 to 13.3 Â° C, 24.7- 27.9 Â° C for summer temperature and 823-1520 mm for the annual rainfall. The palaeoclimate was warm and contained dry seasons due to lower boundary of annual precipitation\n\nDeriving strain from crystallographic preferred orientation for a ductile shear zone in north western Turkey.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFarrell, K.; Lloyd, G. E. E.; Wallis, D.; Phillips, R. J.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nUnderstanding the behaviour of active continental-scale fault zones at depth, and in particular how displacements observed at the Earth's surface are accommodated through the crust, is crucial to improving understanding of the earthquake cycle. This behaviour can be inferred by study of exhumed portions of ductile shear zones using methods such as recording strain profile(s) across the fault zone. However, due to the nature of mid-crustal rocks, strain markers tend to be rare and/or discontinuously distributed. The intensity (I) of crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of deformed minerals provides a proxy for strain that is continuous across fault zones. CPO are collected via electron back scattered diffraction in the scanning electron microscope. The strength of the CPO can be quantified using eigenvalue-based intensity parameters. Calibration of intensity with strain is achieved via comparison with visco-plastic self-consistency models of CPO evolution, although the temperature-dependent critical resolved shear stresses of potential crystal slip systems must be known. As an example, we consider the dextral strike-slip EskiÅehir shear zone, NW Turkey, which was active during the Oligocene and accommodated ~100km of displacement, including a component of late oblique-normal slip. An exhumed mid-crustal section of this fault zone is exposed in the UludaÄ Massif, comprising of high-grade metamorphic rocks of the UludaÄ Group, intruded by the Central and South UludaÄ granites. Sample transects focussed on the pure calcic marbles that dominate the stratigraphy. Fortunately, the availability of experimental data for calcite crystal slip behaviour at different temperatures makes the application of the CPO intensity strain proxy method relatively straightforward. The UludaÄ Massif and EskiÅehir shear zone provide a field based analogue for the ductile shear zone beneath the currently active North Anatolian Fault. The results of our CPO intensity-based strain\n\nDating of the youngest volcanoes of Ardeche (Massif Central, France) using 40Ar/39Ar and unspiked K/Ar\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNomade, Sebastien; Sasco, Romain; Guillou, Herve; Scao, Vincent; Kissel, Catherine; Genty, Dominique\n\n2014-05-01\n\nSince the first description in 1778 of the relationship between prismatic basaltic flow and volcano in the high valleys of the ArdÃ¨che (Faujas Saint-Font, 1778), \"L'ArdÃ¨che\", a small region at the south-west of Massif Central, became worldwide famous among volcanologists. This volcanism is found dispersed over an area of more than 20 km2 and is made of strombolian cones and prismatic flows filling NS to NW-SE valleys. This volcanism has then been considered as one of the most recent one in the entire Massif Central (40 ka to 170 ka, TL ages, GuÃ©rin et al., 2007). Unfortunately and despite several attempts over the last 25 years this volcanism has never been dated using radio-isotopic methods. The two main reasons usually advocated to explain this lack of success were the young age of the volcanism itself and the large amounts of mantle and lower crust xenoliths in the lavas (GuÃ©rin et al., 2007). In this contribution, we will present combined 40Ar/39Ar ages and unspiked K/Ar results obtained on five lava flows. The obtained ages range from 26 Â± 5.5 ka to 55 Â± 6.0 ka (1s, full propagated uncertainty relative to ACS-2 at 1.194Ma, Nomade et al., 2005). The ages from three of the investigated lava flows coming from distinct cones, are clustered between 26 Â± 5.5 ka and 34 Â± 4 ka. These cones are found stretched along a NW-SE tectonic accident. These first radio-isotopic constraints prove that the volcanic activity occurred during the last glacial period and is as young as \"la chaÃ®ne de Puys\" located in the northern part of the Massif Central. Incidentally, the volcanic activity is contemporaneous with the first Aurignacian occupation and related art found in the Chauvet cave (37-29 ka, Valladas et al., 2005) localized only 35 km SE. Based on both the spatial and chronological coincidences reported above we suggest that the Aurignacian population(s) that lived in this area have witnessed one or several of these eruptions.\n\nGeochemical element mobility during the hydrothermal alteration in the Tepeoba porphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposits at Balikesir, NW Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAbdelnasser, Amr; Kiran Yildirim, Demet; Doner, Zeynep; Kumral, Mustafa\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe Tepeoba porphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposit represents one of the important copper source and mineral deposits in the Anatolian tectonic belt at Balikesir province, NW Turkey. It considered as a vein-type deposit locally associated with intense hydrothermal alteration within the brecciation, quartz stockwork veining, and brittle fracture zones in the main host rock that represented by hornfels, as well as generally related to the shallow intermediate to silicic intrusive Eybek pluton. Based on the field and geologic relationships and types of ore mineral assemblages and the accompanied alteration types, there are two mineralization zones; hypogene (primary) and oxidation/supergene zones are observed associated with three alteration zones; potassic, phyllic, and propylitic zones related to this porphyry deposit. The phyllic and propylitic alterations locally surrounded the potassic alteration. The ore minerals related to the hypogene zone represented by mostly chalcopyrite, Molybdenite, and pyrite with subordinate amount of marcasite, enargite, and gold. On the other hand they include mainly cuprite with chalcopyrite, pyrite and gold as well as hematite and goethite at the oxidation/supergene zone. This study deals with the quantitative calculations of the mass/volume changes (gains and losses) of the major and trace elements during the different episodes of alteration in this porphyry deposit. These mass balance data reveal that the potassic alteration zone that the main Cu- and Mo-enriched zone, has enrichment of K, Si, Fe, and Mg, and depletion of Na referring to replacement of plagioclase and amphibole by K-feldspar, sericite and biotite. While the propylitic alteration that is the main Mo- and Au-enriched zone is accompanied with K and Na depletion with enrichment of Si, Fe, Mg, and Ca forming chlorite, epidote, carbonate and pyrite. On the other hand the phyllic alteration that occurred in the outer part around the potassic alteration, characterized by less amount\n\nUnderstanding the Tectonic Deformation of Turkish Blocks since Mesozoic; A Paleomagnetic study on the Nigde-Kirsehir Massif and the Taurides\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMualla, Cinku; Mumtaz, Hisarli; Ulker, Beyza; Kaya, Nurcan; Oksum, Erdinc; Yilmaz, Yucel; Orbay, Naci\n\n2015-04-01\n\nTaurides) and the SW/W (Central Taurides) area two different sense of rotation occured. In the SE/E area, counterclockwise rotation of 18Â° took place in the period between Lower Cretaceous-Middle Eocene. The rotations are consistent with the thrust directions, indicating evidence for the consumption of the Intra Tauride ocean in Late Cretaceous. This result was supported by the paleolatitudes obtained for the Taurides and the NiÄde Ki rÅehir massif which showed a spatial gap of 1000 km between the Pontides and the Taurides in Late Jurassic- Lower Cretaceous and Late Cretaceous. In the SW/W, however, clockwise rotation of 47Â° between Middle Eocene and Miocene time, imply that the deformation occured in a later phase as a result of consumption of the South Neotethys ocean and the collision between the African and Eurasian plates. Accordingly to the paleomagnetic rotations which took place gradually in the SE/E area in Middle Eocene, it is shown that counterclockwise rotations of 25Â° took place in the NiÄde Ki rÅehir massif during Paleocene. This implies that the Nigde-Kirsehir massif underwent similar deformation together with the adjacent block in the SE/E. In the Neotectonic period, counterclockwise rotation of 17Â° was obtained in the SE/E area. It is shown that the westwards movement of Anatolia affected mainly the SE/E ares despite the SW/W and the Nigde-Kirsehir massif, which show no significant rotations. This study was financially supported by the project of the Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) with Project number 111Y043.\n\nSetting new constrains on the age of crustal-scale extensional shear zone (Vivero fault): implications for the evolution of Variscan orogeny in the Iberian massif\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLopez-Sanchez, Marco A.; Marcos, Alberto; MartÃ­nez, Francisco J.; Iriondo, Alexander; Llana-FÃºnez, Sergio\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe Vivero fault is crustal-scale extensional shear zone parallel to the Variscan orogen in the Iberian massif belt with an associated dip-slip movement toward the hinterland. To constrain the timing of the extension accommodated by this structure, we performed zircon U-Pb LA-ICP-MS geochronology in several deformed plutons: some of them emplaced syntectonically. The different crystallization ages obtained indicate that the fault was active at least between 303 Â± 2 and 287 Â± 3 Ma, implying a minimum tectonic activity of 16 Â± 5 Ma along the fault. The onset of the faulting is established to have occurred later than 314 Â± 2 Ma. The geochronological data confirm that the Vivero fault postdates the main Variscan deformation events in the NW of the Iberian massif and that the extension direction of the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian crustal-scale extensional shear zones along the Ibero-Armorican Arc was consistently perpendicular to the general arcuate trend of the belt in SW Europe.\n\nSpatial distribution of quartz recrystallization microstructures across the Aar massif (Swiss Central Alps)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPeters, M.; Herwegh, M.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nIn the Aar massif, main foliation and major deformation structures were developed during NW-SE compression associated with the Alpine orogeny (Steck 1968). To be precise, shearing at the brittle to ductile transition may have initiated at different stages between 22-20 Ma and 14-12 Ma, followed by purely brittle deformation at around 10 Ma (Rolland et al. 2009). In light of the onset of dynamic recrystallization in quartz, Bambauer et al. (2009) defined a quartz recrystallization isograd in the northern part of the Aar massif. To the south, the grain size of recrystallized grains increases due to an increase of metamorphic temperatures from N to S. The aim of the current project is to carry out quantitative analysis on changes of the dynamic and static recrystallization behavior of quartz. Across the Aar massif, two general types of microstructures have to be discriminated: (i) weakly to moderately deformed host rocks and (ii) intensely deformed mylonites to ultramylonites out of high strain shear zones. In (i), volume fraction and size of recrystallized quartz grains increase towards the S showing grain size changes from around 5 Âµm up to ca. 200 Âµm. Southern microstructures are characterized by complete recrystallization. In terms of recrystallization processes, a transition from bulging recrystallization in the N to subgrain rotation recrystallization in the S occurs. Such a change in dynamic recrystallization processes combined with a grain size increase points towards reduced differential stresses with increasing temperature. This temperature gradient is also corroborated by a switch in the active glide systems in quartz from basal to rhomb dominated glide. In contrast to the granitic host rocks, the mylonites and ultramylonites (ii) show smaller recrystallized grain sizes due to enhanced strain rates. However, they also reveal a general increase of recrystallized grain sizes from N to S. In the S, microstructures from (i) and (ii) show equidimensional\n\nLong lasting paleolandscapes stability of the French Massif Central during the Mesozoic\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRicordel-Prognon, C.; Thiry, M.; Theveniaut, H.; Lagroix, F.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nwander path of the European plate in Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic times and the Liassic intraplate fracturing of the Pangea : New palaeomagnetic constraints from NW France and SW Germany.

Although the limited number of images received did not permit construction of a thermal inertia map, important geological details were obtained in the areas of lithology and tectonics. Interpretation of day, night, and seasonal imagery resulted in differentiating broad calcareous and dolomitic units in the Causse Plateau. In the Massif amoricain, some granite massifs were delineated which were not observed by LANDSAT. Neotectonic faults were also revealed.\n\nSeismotectonic significance of the 2008â2010 Walloon Brabant seismic swarm in the Brabant Massif, Belgium\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nVan Noten, Koen; Lecocq, Thomas; Shah, Anjana K.; Camelbeeck, Thierry\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBetween 12 July 2008 and 18 January 2010 a seismic swarm occurred close to the town of Court-Saint-Etienne, 20Â km SE of Brussels (Belgium). The Belgian network and a temporary seismic network covering the epicentral area established a seismic catalogue in which magnitude varies between MLÂ -0.7 and MLÂ 3.2. Based on waveform cross-correlation of co-located earthquakes, the spatial distribution of the hypocentre locations was improved considerably and shows a dense cluster displaying a 200Â m-wide, 1.5-km long, NW-SE oriented fault structure at a depth range between 5 and 7Â km, located in the Cambrian basement rocks of the Lower Palaeozoic Anglo-Brabant Massif. Waveform comparison of the largest events of the 2008â2010 swarm with an MLÂ 4.0 event that occurred during swarm activity between 1953 and 1957 in the same region shows similar P- and S-wave arrivals at the Belgian Uccle seismic station. The geometry depicted by the hypocentral distribution is consistent with a nearly vertical, left-lateral strike-slip fault taking place in a current local WNWâESE oriented local maximum horizontal stress field. To determine a relevant tectonic structure, a systematic matched filtering approach of aeromagnetic data, which can approximately locate isolated anomalies associated with hypocentral depths, has been applied. Matched filtering shows that the 2008â2010 seismic swarm occurred along a limited-sized fault which is situated in slaty, low-magnetic rocks of the Mousty Formation. The fault is bordered at both ends with obliquely oriented magnetic gradients. Whereas the NW end of the fault is structurally controlled, its SE end is controlled by a magnetic gradient representing an early-orogenic detachment fault separating the low-magnetic slaty Mousty Formation from the high-magnetic Tubize Formation. The seismic swarm is therefore interpreted as a sinistral reactivation of an inherited NWâSE oriented isolated fault in a weakened crust within the Cambrian core of\n\nOrdovician magmatism in the LÃ©vÃ©zou massif (French Massif Central): tectonic and geodynamic implications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLotout, Caroline; Pitra, Pavel; Poujol, Marc; Van Den Driessche, Jean\n\n2017-03-01\n\nNew U-Pb dating on zircon yielded ca. 470 Ma ages for the granitoids from the LÃ©vÃ©zou massif in the southern French Massif Central. These new ages do not support the previous interpretation of these granitoids as syn-tectonic intrusions emplaced during the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous thrusting. The geochemical and isotopic nature of this magmatism is linked to a major magmatic Ordovician event recorded throughout the European Variscan belt and related to extreme thinning of continental margins during a rifting event or a back-arc extension. The comparable isotopic signatures of these granitoids on each side of the eclogite-bearing leptyno-amphibolitic complex in the LÃ©vÃ©zou massif, together with the fact that they were emplaced at the same time, strongly suggest that these granitoids were originally part of a single unit, tectonically duplicated by either isoclinal folding or thrusting during the Variscan tectonics.\n\nUsing the concentration-volume (C-V) fractal model in the delineation of gold mineralized zones within the Tepeoba porphyry Cu-Mo-Au, Balikesir, NW Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKumral, Mustafa; Abdelnasser, Amr; Karaman, Muhittin; Budakoglu, Murat\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe Tepeoba porphyry Cu-Mo-Au mineralization that located at the Biga peninsula (W Turkey) developed around the Eybek pluton concentrated at its southern contact. This mineralization that hosted in the hornfels rocks of Karakaya Complex is associated with three main alteration zones; potassic, phyllic and propylitic alterations along the fault controlled margins of the Eybek pluton and quartz stockwork veining as well as brecciation zones. As well as two mineralized zones were occurred in the mine area; hypogene and oxidation/supergene zone. The hypogene zone has differentiated alteration types; high potassic and low phyllic alteration, while the oxidation/supergene zone has high phyllic and propylitic alterations. This work deals with the delineation of gold mineralized zone within this porphyry deposit using the concentration-volume (C-V) fractal model. Five zones of gold were calculated using its power-law C-V relationship that revealed that the main phase of gold mineralization stated at 5.3083 ppm Au concentration. In addition, the C-V log-log plot shows that the highly and moderately Au mineralization zone developed in western part of deposit correlated with oxidation zone related to propylitic alteration. On the other hand, its weakly mineralization zone has a widespread in the hypogene zone related to potassic alteration. This refers to the enrichment of gold and depletion of copper at the oxidation/supergene zone is due to the oxidation/supergene alteration processes that enrich the deposits by the meteoric water.

Ayda; UstaÃ¶mer, Timur; Collins, Alan S.; Reischpeitsch, JÃ¶rg\n\n2009-07-01\n\nThe rocks of Turkey, Greece and Syria preserve evidence for the destruction of Tethys, the construction of much of the continental crust of the region and the formation of the Tauride orogenic belt. These events occurred between the Late Cretaceous and Miocene, but the detailed evolution of the southern Eurasian margin during this period of progressive continental accretion is largely unknown. Marmara Island is a basement high lying at a key location in the Cenozoic Turkish tectonic collage, with a Palaeogene suture zone to the south and a deep Eocene sedimentary basin to the north. North-dipping metamorphic thrust sheets make up the island and are interlayered with a major metagranitoid intrusion. We have dated the intrusion by Laser Ablation ICP-MS analysis of U and Pb isotopes on zircon separates to 47.6 Â± 2 Ma. We also performed major- and trace-elemental geochemical analysis of 16 samples of the intrusion that revealed that the intrusion is a calc-alkaline, metaluminous granitoid, marked by Nb depletion relative to LREE and LIL-element enrichment when compared to ocean ridge granite (ORG). We interpret the metagranitoid sill as a member of a mid-Eocene magmatic arc, forming a 30 km wide and more than 200 km long arcuate belt in NW Turkey that post-dates suturing along the Ä°zmir-Ankara-Erzincan Suture zone. The arc magmatism was emplaced at the early stages of mountain building, related to collision of Eurasia with the Menderes-Taurus Platform in early Eocene times. Orogenesis and magmatism loaded the crust to the north creating coeval upward-deepening marine basins partially filled by volcanoclastic sediments.\n\nMassification to Marketization of Higher Education: Private University Education in Bangladesh\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAhmed, Jashim Uddin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMassification of higher education is a contemporary phenomenon, and Bangladesh is an excellent example of massification in the sector.

It is comprised mainly of a well preserved ultramafic suite, dominated by voluminous dunite exposures, accompanied by subsidiary harzburgite occurrences. The entire suite is commonly cross cut by a complex network of relatively undeformed clinopyroxenite veins. Clinopyroxene and spinel compositions in harzburgites are moderately depleted, whereas their whole-rock heavy rare earth element (HREE) abundances are consistent with harzburgite formation after approximately 19% dry melting of a spinel-bearing fertile mantle protolith at an extentional geotectonic regime. Nevertheless, textural data indicate that protracted dissolution of pyroxene coupled with precipitation of olivine happened during the transformation of harzburgites to replacive dunites, containing olivine with high Fo [Fo = 100ÃMg/(Mg + Fe2+)] content (91.3-94.2) and spinel with elevated Cr# [100ÃCr/(Cr + Al)] values (78-82). Such highly depleted mineralogical signatures imply that dunite for harzburgite substitution occurred under hydrous melting conditions in the mantle region above a subducted oceanic slab. Enrichments in incompatible elements (e.g., Cs, Rb and Sr) and the characteristic U-shaped chondrite-normalized rare earth elements (REE) profiles exhibited by replacive dunites along with the elevated TiO2 (0.20-0.36 wt.%) contents in their accessory spinels indicate that the reactive melt had an intermediate affinity between boninite and island arc tholeiite (IAT) regimes. The metasomatic reaction triggered an additional 8% melting of the harzburgite residue. The resultant melt fractionated (,almost in situ,) to crystallize cumulate dunites composed of olivine with relatively high Fo content (88.8-92.3), spinel with moderate Cr# values (62-74), as well as clinopyroxene with a depleted composition (low TiO2\n\nEpisodic exhumation and relief growth in the Mont Blanc massif, Western Alps from numerical modelling of thermochronology data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGlotzbach, C.; van der Beek, P. A.; Spiegel, C.\n\n2011-04-01\n\nThe Pliocene-Quaternary exhumational and topographic evolution of the European Alps and its potential climatic and tectonic controls remain a subject of controversy. Here, we apply inverse numerical thermal-kinematic modelling to a spatially dense thermochronological dataset (apatite fission-track and (U-Th)/He) of both tunnel and surface samples across the Mont Blanc massif in the Western Alps, complemented by new zircon fission-track data, in order to better quantify its Neogene exhumation and relief history. Age-elevation relationships and modelling results show that an episodic exhumation scenario best fits the data. Initiation of exhumation in the Mont Blanc massif at 22 Â± 2 Ma with a rate of 0.8 Â± 0.15 km/Myr is probably related to NW-directed thrusting during nappe emplacement. Exhumation rates decrease at 6 Â± 2 Ma to values of 0.15 Â± 0.65 km/Myr, which we interpret to be the result of a general decrease in convergence rates and/or extensive exposure of less erodible crystalline basement rocks from below more easily erodible Mesozoic sediments. Finally, local exhumation rates increase up to 2.0 Â± 0.6 km/Myr at 1.7 Â± 0.8 Ma. Modelling shows that this recent increase in local exhumation can be explained by valley incision and the associated increase in relief at 0.9 Â± 0.8 Ma, leading to erosional unloading, isostatic rebound and additional rock uplift and exhumation. Given the lack of tectonic activity as evidenced by constant thermochronological ages along the tunnel transect, we suggest that the final increase in exhumation and relief in the Mont Blanc massif is the result of climate change, with the initiation of mid-Pleistocene glaciations leading to rapid valley incision and related local exhumation.\n\nDextral strike-slip along the KapÄ±daÄ shear zone (NW Turkey): evidence for Eocene westward translation of the Anatolian plate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTÃ¼rkoÄlu, Ercan; Zulauf, Gernold; Linckens, Jolien; UstaÃ¶mer, Timur\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe northern part of the KapÄ±daÄ Peninsula (Marmara Sea, NW Turkey) is affected by the E-W trending KapÄ±daÄ shear zone, which cuts through calc-alkaline granitoids of the Ocaklar pluton resulting in mylonitic orthogneiss. Macroscopic and microscopic shear-sense indicators, such as SC fabrics, shear bands, Ï-clasts and mica fish, unequivocally suggest dextral strike-slip for the KapÄ±daÄ shear zone. Based on petrographic data, deformation microfabrics of quartz and feldspar, and the slip systems in quartz, the dextral shearing should have been active at T = 500-300 Â°C and P < 5 kbar. Published K-Ar and 39Ar-40Ar cooling ages of hornblende and biotite suggest that cooling below 500-300 Â°C occurred during the Eocene (ca. 45-ca. 35 Ma), meaning that the KapÄ±daÄ shear zone should have been active during Middle to Late Eocene times. The differential stress related to the shearing was <50 MPa as is indicated by the size of recrystallized quartz grains. Based on the new and published data, it is concluded that the westward movement of the Anatolian plate might have been active almost continuously from the Middle Eocene until recent times.\n\nGeochemical behavior of rare earth elements of the hydrothermal alterations within the Tepeoba porphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposits at Balikesir, NW Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDoner, Zeynep; Abdelnasser, Amr; Kiran Yildirim, Demet; Kumral, Mustafa\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThis work reports the geochemical characteristics and behavior of the rare earth elements (REE) of the hydrothermal alteration of the Tepeoba porphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposit located in the Anatolian tectonic belt at Biga peninsula (Locally Balikesir province), NW Turkey. The Cu-Mo-Au mineralization at this deposit hosted in the hornfels rocks and related to the silicic to intermediate intrusion of Eybek pluton. It locally formed with brecciated zones and quartz vein stockworks, as well as the brittle fracture zones associated with intense hydrothermal alteration. Three main alteration zones with gradual boundaries formed in the mine area in the hornfels rock that represents the host rock, along that contact the Eybek pluton; potassic, propylitic and phyllic alteration zones. The potassic alteration zone that formed at the center having high amount of Cu-sulfide minerals contains biotite, muscovite, and sericite with less amount of K-feldsp"
