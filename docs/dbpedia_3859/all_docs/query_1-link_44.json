        "text": "How to Get from Beldibi to Other Destinations\n\nBeldibi is a picturesque village located on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. It is situated right at the foot of the Taurus mountains and looks like a long street of hotels, houses, and shops. If you’re thinking about how to get from this resort to the nearest locations, there are a few travel options you may use: they are local public transport, taxis, and private transfers.\n\nTaxi from Beldibi\n\nThere are a few taxi ranks throughout Beldibi. Fares for the most popular routes can be found on special boards. Also, one may order a car by calling one of local taxi cab companies or through a hotel reception desk. The average price for a ride to Kemer (17 km) is 20 euros, to Antalya (25 km) - 40 euros, and to its airport (39 km) - 60 euros. Always be careful when traveling with private taxi drivers as they may not turn the taximeter on and thus overcharge you.\n\nTransfer from Beldibi\n\nTraveling by private transfer is the most hassle-free way to get to your destination. You easily reserve a car online in advance and this saves you lots of stress before the trip. Thus, booking a transfer, you may pay for it with your credit card and thus avoid all the hassle related to cash. You do not have to wait for your driver: he/she will pick you up strictly at the time appointed. An Economy-class taxi transfer from Beldibi to the city of Antalya or its airport costs 32 euros, and to Kemer - 33 euros. There are several vehicle classes you may choose from, and if you need a more spacious option, you may consider booking a minivan or a minibus. For any questions concerning your transfer, you may always contact the Kiwitaxi customer support.\n\nPublic Transport from Beldibi\n\nOne can easily reach Kemer from Beldibi by dolmus (2 euros). Also, a dolmus can take you to the city of Antalya (2.50 euros), where you can take the bus line 202 or the Havas bus (up to 1.50 euros) to reach the airport.\n\nUnfortunately, all these services don’t operate at night hours. So one may use only taxi or private transfer services to reach the desired destination at this time. Also, local public transport is often packed so it’s not a good option for those who appreciate comfort.\n\nUseful Information\n\nThe resort of Beldibi will be perfect for nature lovers due to its picturesque mountain landscapes. As for local beaches, they are mainly pebble. There are both equipped and semi-wild beaches in this area. If you’re looking for night entertainment, go to the nearest towns as you won’t find it in this village. There are almost no sights here, as well."
