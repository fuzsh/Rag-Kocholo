        "text": "The year of birth of the lost and found service is officially known as 1805. Napoleon then established a police unit responsible for returning lost or stolen items to citizens. Since that time there have been fundamental changes in the work of the structure. In many countries people who donate found items to lost and found receive a certain monetary reward\n\nFor example, lost Mobile phone make up almost a third of the list. To help distracted, forgetful people on the Internet, electronic analogs of lost and found are being created and people who care can easily place a note there about finding someone’s belonging.\n\nA new generation of lost and found Mobile phone work\n\nAccording to statistics, in the last century, out of every lost and found Mobile phone, only 13 per cent were returned to the owner because of the difficult identification process. Modern technologies have brought the work of services involved in the search for lost items to a new level. It is enough for an absent-minded person to pay a small amount to purchase a special sticker, a key fob with a personal identification number. The data entered into the database will help to quickly detect the loss, identify, notify the owner where he can pick up his things. If necessary, a courier will deliver lost keys or other items directly to your doorstep. Paid service provides a great opportunity to quickly find the loss in a crowded, huge metropolis.\n\nIn most cases, the service that implements the identification numbers simply brings together those who have found and lost keys. They negotiate the remuneration themselves. To increase the motivation for returning lost items, many companies provide rewards from personal funds. The use of modern methods of identifying personal belongings has significantly increased the return recently. And even without using such technologies, you can simply use the Tagmefy service which is aimed at searching for the owner of lost property."
