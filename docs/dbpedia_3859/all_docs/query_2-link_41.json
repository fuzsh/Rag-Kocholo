        "text": "Best Way to Get from Antalya Airport to Goynuk Mahallesi\n\nGreetings travellers, wanderers, and tourists! Welcome to Turkey, the gem that is minor Asia. Today, we shall be discussing the variety of methods offered to you, when visiting, to get between Antalya airport, one of the Turkish Riviera’s busiest airports, and Beldibi Bahcecik. This guide will also be applicable to getting a little further down, to the other popular resort Goynuk Mahallesi. In broad, this guide is about the variety of transportation methods you may choose from when wishing to visit this coastal region in Turkey. First up, we will discuss the best, a Transfer with AtoB.\n\nBooking a Antalya Airport to Beldibi Bahcecik Transfer with AtoB\n\nChoosing AtoB as your sole transportation provider in southern Turkey is a wise and advisable option. We offer a private, affordable ride from the airport, directly to the front door of your accommodation. To book your ride, simply head over to our booking page, inputting your arrival date and time, as well as where you wish to go, once there.\n\nFollowing this, you can proceed to the next page, where a comprehensive overview of all available vehicles will be presented to you. Based on your travel needs and requirements, carefully choose the most appropriate for you, before proceeding to personalising the ride with any and all add-ons you need to perfect the trip.\n\nFinally, pay for the transfer through our secure payment portal. You will receive a confirmation email instantly upon successful payment, with a basic invoice and itinerary being presented to you. As the day of your transfer slowly approaches, an additional email will arrive in your inbox, which will provide you with the contact details of your assigned driver. We recommend getting in touch with them, as they will be able to provide you with any relevant information needed for your transfer.\n\nJust as easy as that, you have a reserved transfer from Antalya Airport to Beldibi Bahcecik! Happy Travels!\n\nGetting a Bus from Antalya Airport to Beldibi Bahcecik\n\nThe bus definitely isn’t the most convenient option, yet we shall still cover it, in case anyone is interested in taking a crack at Turkish public transport. From the airport, one will need to catch the T1A tram into the centre of Antalya, disembarking at Meydan. From there, a quick walk to Aspendos Blv-19, from where the ML22 bus will need to be caught. Disembark this bus at the Lunapark, and catch the follow-up bus, the KA07, to Sanal Durak Beldibi Atatürk Cd-2.\n\nThe cost of all the tickets will only come out to be 5 euros, if not a little less. They can be purchased from the drivers, although for the tram, you will need to purchase it from the kiosks at the airport."
