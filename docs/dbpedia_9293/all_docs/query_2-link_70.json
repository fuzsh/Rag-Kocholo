        "text": "1201-1274\n\nNasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī\n\nNasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī (1201-1274) develops a theory of evolution with organisms gaining differences through adapting to their environments. He suggests that organisms which gain beneficial new features quicker have advantages over others and are more variable.\n\n1749\n\nGeorges Buffon\n\nThe French naturalist Georges Buffon (1707-1788) envisages a constantly changing world in which species change over time (but rejects the idea that this change could lead to new species).\n\n1773\n\nJames Burnett, Lord Monboddo\n\nJames Burnett, Lord Monboddo (1767-1792) suggests that humans descended from primates and that creatures can transform their characteristics in response to the environment over long time intervals.\n\n1794\n\nErasmus Darwin\n\nErasmus Darwin (1731-1802) proposes that all warm-blooded animals arose and differentiated from a single form, and anticipates the idea of natural selection.\n\n1795\n\nGeorges Cuvier\n\nGeorges Cuvier (1769-1832) draws attention to the fact that the geological record is not a continuous one. He demonstrates the fact of extinction with studies of fossil mammals, and believes the extinctions to have occurred in a series of giant floods.\n\n1809\n\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck\n\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) proposes that while simple forms of life were spontaneously generated, they were driven up a ladder of complexity over time. Use or disuse of organs and traits cause changes which could be passed on to the next generation.\n\n1818\n\nRobert Edmond Grant and Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire\n\nRobert Edmond Grant (1793-1874) and Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772-1844) further develop the ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck & Erasmus Darwin to propose that plants and animals had a common evolutionary starting point (a view wrongly discredited by Richard Owen).\n\n1830\n\nCharles Lyell\n\nCharles Lyell (1797-1875) establishes the basic chronology of the Tertiary period and its relationship to rock strata. He popularizes the doctrine of uniformitarianism; that the features of the Earth can be better explained as the long-term result of short-term geological phenomena.\n\n1845\n\nAlexander von Humboldt\n\nAlexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) pioneers the study of ecology and initiates a new focus on the interactions between species and their environment.\n\n1860\n\nOxford Evolution Debate\n\nProponents and opponents of Darwin & Wallace’s theories clash in the famous Oxford Evolution Debate; Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-1895) and Samuel Wilberforce (1805-1873) butt heads in a public debate, which both sides consider a victory.\n\n1866\n\nGregor Mendel\n\nGregor Mendel (1822-1884) publishes Experiments in Plant Hybridisation, establishing some basic laws of the genetic inheritance of discrete traits. Mendel’s paper remained obscure for about 35 years, but in 1900 it was rediscovered.\n\n1896\n\nJames Mark Baldwin\n\nJames Mark Baldwin (1861-1934) suggests that adaptation can arise and evolve from plasticity without invoking inheritance of acquired characters in A New Factor in Evolution, a concept later known as the Baldwin Effect. Similar ideas were also presented earlier or around the same time by Douglas Spalding, Conwy LLoyd Morgan and Henry Osborn.\n\n1909\n\nWilhelm Johannsen\n\nWilhelm Johannsen (1857-1927), a Danish biologist, provides the basic terminology for genetics: ‘genes’ as particulate units of heredity; ‘genotype’ as the genetic constitution of an organism; and ‘phenotype’ as the organism’s physical characteristics.\n\n1910\n\nThomas Hunt Morgan\n\nThomas Hunt Morgan (1866-1945) establishes the chromosomal theory of heredity. Morgan began to breed and conduct experiments with the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which initiated the field of experimental genetics. Morgan confirmed Mendelian laws of inheritance and the hypothesis that genes are located on chromosomes.\n\n1918\n\nRonald Fisher\n\nRonald Fisher (1890-1962) produces the paper The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance, showing how the continuous variation measured by biometricians could be the result of the action of many discrete genetic loci.\n\n1925\n\nRaymond Dart\n\nRaymond Dart (1893-1988) publishes in Nature a description of the Taung child, a fossil skull from Taung near Johannesburg, of the species Australopithecus africanus.\n\n1942\n\nConrad Hal Waddington\n\nConrad Hal Waddington (1905-1975) proposes the evolutionary process of genetic assimilation in Canalization of Development and the Inheritance of Acquired Characters, followed by several other important papers and books, including The Strategy of Genes. His famous epigenetic landscape as a metaphor for gene regulation has become reprinted and re-interpreted ever since.\n\n1953\n\nDNA structure discovered\n\nFrancis Crick (1916-2004), James Watson (1928-) and Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958) discover the chemical structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and show that it meets the unique requirements for a substance that encodes genetic information."
