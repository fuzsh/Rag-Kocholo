        "text": "Sources|Discussion Questions|Experiment\n\nObservations aboard the Beagle\n\nDuring his five year journey around the world on HMS Beagle, Charles Darwin encountered many different landscapes and an enormous variety of flora and fauna. Some of his most vivid experiences were on the islands of the coast of South America, including the now-famous Galapagos archipelago. Darwin was fascinated by the geographic relationship between the South American coast and its nearby islands; he puzzled over why plants and animals on nearby islands were similar to those on the mainland. Darwin was not satisfied by the traditional explanation provided by many naturalists of his day (including the famous Harvard naturalist Louis Agassiz), that each organism was specially created for its geographic location. After his return from the Beagle, he started to challenge the tenets of special creation theory. Eventually, Darwin suggested that species were transported from the mainland to the islands, where they continued to evolve.\n\nSeeds in salt water\n\nFor his theory to work, Darwin had to prove that it was possible for mainland species to be transported across oceans and to survive on nearby islands. In the 1850s he embarked on a series of experiments to demonstrate that a variety of cross-oceanic dispersal methods were possible. He conducted several experiments to test whether the seeds of common garden plants could be soaked in salt water, survive, and germinate. Many of Darwin's seeds survived this salt-water test, which suggested to Darwin that his theory of seed dispersal and subsequent evolution was plausible. Darwin also hypothesized that snails could be transported from mainlands to islands via birds. To test this theory Darwin tested whether pond snails would adhere to ducks' feet that were dangled into ponds. Although these experiments were simple, the results gave Darwin substantial evidence for the role of evolution in the history and distribution of life on earth.\n\nYou can download the entire packet of reading materials here: Biogeography Source Pack\n\nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\n\n1. Why did Darwin undertake soak common garden seeds in salt water?\n\n2. Why do you think Darwin did not publish the larger implications of his work in the Gardner’s Chronicle?\n\n3. Why did Darwin seek the advice of Joseph Hooker in putting together his experiment soaking seeds in salt water? What does their exchange tell you about Darwin’s network of scientific exchange?\n\n4. Why is Darwin interested to know whether fish will swallow common garden seeds? How does this relate to the salt water experiments?\n\n5. How do Darwin’s experimental results relate to his theories of geographical distribution in Chapter 11 of On the Origin of Species? What types of evidence does Darwin present in the chapter to support his claims?\n\n6. Do you think that Darwin’s work in this area was novel or challenging for his time? Why or why not?"
