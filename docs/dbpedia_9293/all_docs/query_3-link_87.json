        "text": "Luther Tracy Townsend (1838-1922) was professor at Boston Theological Seminary (now Boston University School of Theology). He argued that scientific theories should be held as mere \"working hypotheses.\" To \"possess weight\" a working hypothesis must receive the assent of all, or nearly all, who are capable of investigating the subject. By the time of the publication of Evolution or creation, the consensus of scientists was hardening against Darwinism in any form. Seizing the opportunity, Townsend applied the rule. Darwin's hypothesis should have no weight except that accorded to other very questionable speculations.\n\nFeatured work:\n\nEvolution or creation: a critical review of the scientific and scriptural theories of creation and certain related subjects / by Luther Tracy Townsend. Baltimore: Published by the author, 1898.\n\n\"Christian Darwinisticism\" is the term James R. Moore applies to reconciliations of Darwinism and Christian doctrine that embodied non-Darwinian evolutionary theories. They came into conflict with Darwinism because they believed that God's purposes are manifested in the world and that these purposes disclose God's omnipotent and beneficent character: more precisely, they believed in a god whose purposes could not have been realized through evolution as Darwin conceived it.\n\nSt. George Jackson Mivart (1827-1900) was an early follower of Darwin, but became Darwin's most influential critic in Britain. By 1868 he had begun to question the efficacy of natural selection, particularly as a cause of human evolution. Natural selection might explain the development of the human body, he conceded, but it can hardly account for mankind's unique psychological nature. The human soul with its intellectual and moral attributes is a supernatural infusion, he maintained, and natural selection is not, in fact, \"the origin of species.\" Mivart alienated himself from his former colleagues (Darwin, et al.), and ended up being excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nFeatured work:\n\nOn the genesis of species / St. George Mivart. London: Macmillan, 1871.\n\nIf ever there was a contradiction in terms it must surely have been Christian Darwinism. The name Christian might have been annexed to anti-Darwinism or perhaps to some version of evolution which did honor to the purposes and character of the Creator, but never, surely to that theory set forth by the agnostic naturalist Charles Darwin. Yet Christian Darwinism did exist-the appellation was used as early as 1867-and its representatives on both sides of the Atlantic were among the ablest and most orthodox of the post-Darwinian controversialists.\n\nJames Iverach (1839-1922) was a professor of dogmatic theology and of New Testament at the Free Church College in Aberdeen. The form in which Iverach thought Darwin's theory might safely be held was not one of agnostic evolution. The work of science is strengthened by the religious conviction that nothing occurs by chance. Darwin's theory of biological evolution by natural selection could be seen from two points of view, one strictly scientific and the other teleological. For the first, natural selection offers only a fragmentary conception of nature. From the second, the religious viewpoint, natural selection is seen as it truly is: as an expression of the sum total of causes, internal and external, which have transpired to the end that just those forms of life which are currently observed should exist. Interpreted thus, natural selection does not damage the argument from design but actually strengthens it.\n\nFeatured work:\n\nTheism in the light of present science and philosophy / by James Iverach. New York: Published for New York University by the Macmillan Co., 1899.\n\nIn the last two decades of the nineteenth century Aubrey Lackington Moore (1843-1890) was the clergyman who more than any other man was responsible for breaking down the antagonisms toward evolution then widely felt in the English Church. Unlike many theologians of his generation, Moore learnt to understand the scientific enterprise as scientists themselves understood it. His was a theology which refused to connect the Christian faith necessarily with evolution or the denial of evolution, but which held that evolution should be specially attractive to those whose first thought is to hold and to guard every jot and tittle of the Catholic faith. Faith is not dependent on any particular understanding of organic origins, for whatever science may reveal as the method of origination, it is, after all, only a revelation of God's method of creation. Evolution or creation is thus a false antithesis. A Christian's controversy with a Darwinian agnostic is a controversy with his agnosticism, not his Darwinism.\n\nFeatured work:\n\nScience and the faith: essays on apologetic subjects / by Aubrey L. Moore. 3rd ed. London: K Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1892.\n\nIn the United States Christian Darwinism was advanced by two theologically minded naturalists, the botanist Asa Gray (1810-1888) and the geologist George Frederick Wright. Their enterprise was sustained by a common commitment to the evangelical Calvinism which had dominated New England theology for more than two hundred years. Gray was a professor of natural history at Harvard and was the foremost defender of Darwinism in America. Despite the abiding importance of his own scientific work, Gray is remembered chiefly as the one American naturalist who identified himself from the outset with the promotion of Darwin's.\n\nFeatured work:\n\nNatural science and religion: two lectures delivered to the Theological School of Yale College / by Asa Gray. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1880."
