His book On the Origin of Species introduced natural selection as the primary mechanism of adaptive evolution, forming the foundation of modern biology.\n\nReligious views[edit]\n\nInitially convinced by Paley's watchmaker argument, his studies in biology led him to later reject it. Likewise his views on Christian morality were positive but after much thought he rejected Christianity as well. Here are some quotes from Darwin's autobiography:\n\nRacism and social implications of evolution[edit]\n\nWhile Darwinism is often misused, Chris Hedges accuses Darwin of dabbling in Social Darwinism in that he thought it was largely inevitable:\n\nIn the Descent of Man, Darwin wrote:\n\nIt is also worth considering that Darwin was socially forward thinking for his time, particularly in his opposition to slavery.[2]\n\nOn apologetics[edit]\n\nOn the subject of whether apologetics is effective:\n\nDeath bed conversion?[edit]\n\nFor more information, see the TalkOrigins Archive article:\n\nVarious rumours and anonymous claims have been circulated but there is no reliable evidence of a death bed conversion by Darwin. [4] [5]\n\nCouldn't get a job[edit]\n\n\"Darwin couldn't even get a job\", \"his dad had to get him a job\"[6] is Ad hominem, not to mention he came from a wealthy family and didn't require the money.[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]\n\nCA005.1. Darwin himself was racist, TalkOrigins archive.\n\nCA002.2. Marx admired and corresponded with Darwin, TalkOrigins archive.\n\nCA131 Darwin suffered from psychoneurosis, TalkOrigins archive.\n\nv · d Science\n\nv · d General science\n\nScientific method Scientific theory · Hypothesis · Evidence · Examining claims · Skepticism Scientific Disciplines Physics · Biology · Chemistry · Psychology · Medical Science · Mathematics History of science Heliocentrism · Quantum mechanics Champions of reason Carl Sagan · James Randi\n\nv · d Biology\n\nEvolution Natural selection Abiogenesis The Urey-Miller experiment Evolutionary straw men Life just exploded from nothing · So you think we came from monkeys · How did the first dog find a mate · Crocoducks · Banana argument · 747 Junkyard argument · Irreducible complexity · Chuck Missler's jar of peanut butter · What good is half a wing?
