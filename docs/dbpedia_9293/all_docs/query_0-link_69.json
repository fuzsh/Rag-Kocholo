        "text": "Faraday's experiments in electromagnetism laid the groundwork for modern electrical engineering and technology. His discoveries paved the way for the development of electric motors, generators, and transformers.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nEinstein's theory of relativity fundamentally altered our understanding of space, time, and gravity. While some of his discoveries, like the mass-energy equivalence equation, led to the development of nuclear energy and atomic bombs, Einstein also made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and the theory of Brownian motion, earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.\n\nDubbed the father of evolution, Darwin's theory of natural selection, presented in \"On the Origin of Species,\" revolutionized biology. His studies, including those during the voyage of HMS Beagle, provided evidence supporting the idea of species evolving over time through natural selection, sparking widespread debate and laying the foundation for modern evolutionary biology.\n\nThe illustrious Italian polymath unveiled previously unknown phenomena, such as the phases of Venus and the existence of moons around Jupiter. Despite his contributions, his advocacy of heliocentrism—suggesting Earth orbits the sun—put him in conflict with the Catholic Church, which championed the geocentric model. Nonetheless, Galileo laid the groundwork for modern observational astronomy and physics.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nPasteur's contributions to medicine were transformative, particularly through his development of vaccination. His endeavors in microbiology not only saved countless lives but also enhanced understanding of disease transmission, leading to significant strides in public health.\n\nRaised in Poland but immersed in French culture, Marie Curie, alongside her husband Pierre Curie, conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. Her isolation of radioactive elements like polonium and radium propelled advancements in X-ray technology. Curie's groundbreaking work earned her the distinction of being the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to win in two different fields: Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911.\n\nRosalind Franklin was a pioneering chemist and X-ray crystallographer whose work was instrumental in elucidating the structure of DNA. Through her groundbreaking X-ray diffraction images, known as Photo 51, Franklin provided crucial insights into the double helix structure of DNA, a discovery that laid the foundation for modern molecular biology. Despite not receiving due recognition during her lifetime, Franklin's contributions have since been widely acknowledged as instrumental in shaping our understanding of genetics and molecular biology."
