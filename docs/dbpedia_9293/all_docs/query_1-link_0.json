You will be able to access your list from any article in Discover.\n\nYou don't have any saved articles.\n\nCharles Darwin is celebrated as one of the greatest British scientists who ever lived, but in his time his radical theories brought him into conflict with members of the Church of England.\n\nYoung Charles Darwin\n\nBorn in 1809 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Darwin was fascinated by the natural world from a young age. Growing up he was an avid reader of nature books and devoted his spare time to exploring the fields and woodlands around his home, collecting plants and insects.\n\nIn 1825 Darwin enrolled in medical school at the University of Edinburgh, where he witnessed surgery on a child. Surgeries at the time would have been carried out without the use of anaesthetic or antiseptics, and fatalities were common.\n\nWatching this procedure left Darwin so traumatised that he gave up his studies without completing the course.\n\nDuring his time in Edinburgh, Darwin also paid for lessons in taxidermy from John Edmonstone, a former enslaved man from Guyana. The skills Edmonstone taught Darwin became crucial just a few years further into his career.\n\nAfter his time in Scotland, Darwin went to Cambridge University to study theology.\n\nThe voyage of HMS Beagle\n\nIn no rush to take holy orders, in 1831 Darwin accepted an offer to embark on a five-year voyage aboard HMS Beagle.Â\n\nHe was recommended by one of his Cambridge professors for the role as naturalist and companion to the shipâs captain, Robert FitzRoy.\n\nThe journey would change both his life and the trajectory of Western scientific thinking.\n\nDarwin explored remote regions and marvelled at a world so different from the one he knew. He encountered birds with bright blue feet, sharks with T-shaped heads and giant tortoises.\n\nOn his travels Darwin collected plants, animals and fossils, and took copious field notes. These collections and records provided the evidence he needed to develop his remarkable theory.\n\nDarwin returned to England in 1836. A highly methodical scholar, constantly collecting and observing, he spent many years comparing and analysing specimens before finally declaring that evolution occurs by a process of natural selection.\n\nWhat is the theory of natural selection?\n\nTo this day the theory of evolution by natural selection is accepted by the scientific community as the best evidence-based explanation for the diversity and complexity of life on Earth.\n\nThe theory proposes that the âfittestâ individual organisms - those with the characteristics best suited to their environment - are more likely to survive and reproduce. They pass on these desirable characteristics to their offspring.\n\nGradually these features may become more common in a population, so species change over time. If the changes are great enough, they could produce a new species altogether.\n\nOn his travels Darwin had collected finches from many of the GalÃ¡pagos Islands - off the coast of Ecuador - which helped him to formulate his idea.\n\nSome of these finches had stout beaks for eating seeds, others were insect specialists. But Darwin realised that they were all descendants of a single ancestor. As they dispersed to different islands, the birds had adapted to eat the various foods available. Natural selection had produced 13 different species of finch.\n\nDarwinâs pigeons\n\nFrom his travels on HMS Beagle, Darwin suspected that the environment might naturally manipulate species, causing them to change over time - but he couldnât find a means to explore this effectively in the wild.Â\n\nExperimenting with artificial selection in pigeons gave him a way to study how far a species could change.\n\nBy artificially selecting features - crossing birds with particular characteristics to generate different offspring - he gathered valuable evidence for evolution by natural selection.\n\nTo illustrate his theory, Darwin bred the birds to have exaggerated features.\n\nOn advice from friends, the two scientists organised a joint announcement. Their theory of evolution by natural selection was presented at the Linnean Society in London.\n\nBoth had studied the natural world extensively and made a number of observations that were critical to the development of the theory.\n\nThe following year, Darwin published the contentious but now-celebrated book, âOn the Origin of Speciesâ.\n\nOn the Origin of Species\n\nPublished in 1859, On the Origin of Species provoked outrage from some members of the Church of England as it implicitly contradicted the belief in divine creation.\n\nDespite accusations of blasphemy, the book quickly became a bestseller.\n\nGreat apes\n\nThe Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex - which Darwin published in 1871 - fuelled even greater debate as it suggested that humans descended from apes.\n\nThe Bishop of Oxford famously asked Thomas Huxley, one of Darwinâs most enthusiastic supporters, whether it was through his grandfather or grandmother that he claimed descent from a monkey.\n\nDespite the attacks, Darwinâs conviction in the scientific explanation that best fit the available evidence remained unshaken.\n\nHe was keen for his ideas to reach as many people as possible and for his books to be read in many different languages.Â Part of his success has been attributed to his conversational and approachable writing style.\n\nOn the Origin of Species was so influential that within a year it had been published in German. In Darwin's lifetime, his book was translated into German, Danish, Dutch, French, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Spanish and Swedish.Â\n\nOur Library has 478 editions of On the Origin of Species in 38 languages and in Braille.\n\nThe tips of the branches show the species that are still alive today. The tree also shows those that are now extinct. Darwin explained:\n\nâFrom the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off; and these fallen branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders, families, and genera which have now no living representatives, and which are known to us only in a fossil state.â\n\nOrders, families and genera are all groups that can be used to classify organisms.\n\nThe lines on the tree show evolutionary relationships between species. For example, a recent version of the tree of life would show a line between some types of dinosaurs and the earliest birds, as scientists reason that birds evolved from a particular lineage of dinosaurs.\n\nThis means that species that are closely related are found close together stemming from the same branch.\n\nFor example, humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans are all great apes, so they all belong to the same branch of the tree of life.\n\nDarwinâs legacy\n\nAlthough Darwinâs theory of evolution has been modified over time, it remains fundamental to the study of the natural world. Darwin changed not only the way we see all organisms, but also the way we see ourselves."
