        "text": "Organic evolution is the theory that more recent types of plants and animals have their origins in other pre-existing forms and that the distinguishable differences between ancestors and descendents are due to modifications in successive generations. Charles Darwin (1809–1882) did not invent the idea of organic evolution; generations preceding him entertained the notion such as the French zoologist Jean Baptist de Lamarck (1744–1829), a pioneer in invertebrate paleontology, and Erasmus Darwin (1744–1802), grandfather of Charles. Until Charles Darwin’s time, however, the idea had never had wide currency because earlier workers lacked important data and the Huttonian concept of geologic time, which are both vital for the evolutionary argument. Charles Darwin’s contribution was to propose a mechanism—natural selection—to explain how this change could occur.\n\nBecause sufficient time is required to produce changes, one of the first requirements of evolution came out of uniformitarianism. This idea provided the first link in Darwin’s chain of reasoning. The relationship between organic evolution and geologic time is that the very randomness of very small, fortuitous evolutionary variations in species, which result in noticeable changes in the physical form of an organism, requires enormous amounts of time. Building on uniformitarianism, Darwin constructed a singularly rational and convincing argument for the origin of the diverse organisms that populate the world.\n\nIn his work, On the Origin of Species, first published in 1859, Darwin demonstrated the existence of organic evolution to scientists and non-scientists alike. Geologic thought, indeed all philosophical thought, has never been the same. Eicher (1976) provides the following summary:\n\nPopulations of animals and plants produce progeny at such a rate that were they all to survive, they would increase rapidly year after year.\n\nSpectacular progressive increases in population size do not, in fact, occur. Although most populations fluctuate year by year, they remain essentially constant over the long term.\n\nA very real struggle for existence occurs in nature. Each individual must compete for food and must cope successfully with every facet of the environment—both physical, such as climate extremes, and biological, such as diseases and predators—in order to live to produce progeny.\n\nEach individual differs from virtually all others in its species. By Darwin’s time, striking variation in domestic animals had already been produced by selective breeding. Darwin noted that species in nature had similar potential for modification.\n\nHere Darwin made a break with all previous suggestions on the subject. Instead of postulating that modifications are induced by the environment and are then passed on from generation to generation, he suggested that new characteristics arise from within an organism entirely by chance. (We now know that these arise as genetic mutations.) However, not all of these new characteristics will have adaptive significance or survival value, and many may even be lethal.\n\nSome of the new characteristics enhance an individual’s success in coping with the environment and may even allow the organism to push beyond previous environmental barriers. Others will be unsuccessful, and individuals with these modifications will simply not survive to pass them along; Darwin termed this process natural selection."
