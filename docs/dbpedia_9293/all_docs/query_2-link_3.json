        "text": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697.\n\nFRANCISCO J. AYALA\n\nThere is a contradiction between Darwin’s methodology and how he described it for public consumption. Darwin claimed that he proceeded “on true Baconian [inductive] principles and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale.” He also wrote, “How odd it is that anyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service!” The scientific method includes 2 episodes. The first consists of formulating hypotheses; the second consists of experimentally testing them. What differentiates science from other knowledge is the second episode: subjecting hypotheses to empirical testing by observing whether or not predictions derived from a hypothesis are the case in relevant observations and experiments. A hypothesis is scientific only if it is consistent with some but not other possible states of affairs not yet observed, so that it is subject to the possibility of falsification by reference to experience. Darwin occupies an exalted place in the history of Western thought, deservedly receiving credit for the theory of evolution. In The Origin of Species, he laid out the evidence demonstrating the evolution of organisms. More important yet is that he discovered natural selection, the process that accounts for the adaptations of organisms and their complexity and diversification. Natural selection and other causal processes of evolution are investigated by formulating and testing hypotheses. Darwin advanced hypotheses in multiple fields, including geology, plant morphology and physiology, psychology, and evolution, and subjected them to severe empirical tests.\n\nINDUCTION AND EMPIRICISM\n\nIt is a common misconception, shared by many scientists, that science proceeds by “accumulating experimental facts and drawing up a theory from them,” as François Jacob (1988, pp. 224–225) had believed when he started the research on bacteriophage replication that would lead to his receiving, in 1965, the Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine. This misconception is encased in the much repeated assertion that science is inductive, a notion that can be traced to the English statesman and essayist Francis Bacon (1561–1626). Bacon had an influential role in shaping modern science by his criticism of the prevailing metaphysical speculations of medieval scholastic philosophers. In the 19th century the most articulate proponent of inductivism was John Stuart Mill (1806–1873).\n\nInduction was proposed by Bacon and Mill as a method of achieving objectivity while avoiding subjective preconceptions and obtaining empirical rather than abstract or metaphysical knowledge. In its extreme form the inductivist canon would hold that a scientist should observe any phenomena that he encounters in his experience and record them without any preconceptions as to what to observe or what the truth about his observations might be. Truths of universal validity would be expected eventually to emerge, as a result of the relentless accumulation of unprejudged observations. The methodology proposed may be trivially exemplified as follows. A scientist measuring and recording everything that confronts him observes a tree with leaves. A second tree, and a third, and many others, are all observed to have leaves. Eventually, he formulates a universal statement, “all trees have leaves.”\n\nThis inductive process fails to account for the actual methodology of science. First of all, no scientist works without any preconceived plan as to what kind of phenomena to observe. Scientists choose for study objects or events that, in their opinion, are likely to provide answers to questions that interest them. Otherwise, as Darwin wrote, “one might as well go into a gravel pit and count the pebbles and describe the colors.” A scientist whose goal was to record carefully every event observed in all waking moments of his life would not contribute much to the advance of science; more likely than not, he might be considered mad by his colleagues.\n\nMoreover, induction fails to arrive at universal truths. No matter how many singular statements may be accumulated, no universal statement can be logically justified by such an accumulation of observations. Even if all trees so far observed have leaves, or all swans observed are white, it remains a logical possibility that the next tree will not have leaves, or the next swan will not be white. The step from numerous singular statements to a universal one involves logical amplification. The universal statement has greater logical content (it says more) than the sum of all singular statements.\n\nAnother serious logical difficulty with the proposal that induction is the method of science, is that scientific hypotheses and theories are formulated in abstract terms that do not occur at all in the description of empirical events. Mendel, the founder of genetics, observed in the progeny of hybrid plants that alternative traits segregated according to certain proportions. Repeated observations of these proportions could never have led inductively to the formulation of his hypothesis that “factors” (genes) exist in the sex cells and are rearranged in the progeny according to certain rules. The genes were not observed and thus could not be included in statements reflecting what Mendel observed. Natural selection, like gravity or electricity, is not directly observed by a simple examination of nature at a particular time or place. The most interesting and fruitful scientific hypotheses are not simple generalizations. Instead, scientific hypotheses are creations of the mind, imaginative suggestions as to what might be true.\n\nInduction fails in all 3 counts pointed out. It is not a method that ensures objectivity and avoids preconceptions, it is not a method to reach universal truths, and it is not a good description of the process by which scientists formulate hypotheses and other forms of scientific knowledge. It is a different matter that a scientist may come upon a new idea or develop a hypothesis as a consequence of repeated observation of phenomena that might be similar or share certain traits. But how we come upon a new idea is quite a different matter from how is it that we come to accept something as established scientific knowledge.\n\nTHE HYPOTHETICO-DEDUCTIVE METHOD\n\nNew ideas in science are advanced in the form of conjectures or hypotheses, which may be more or less precisely formulated and be of lesser or greater generality. However, it is essential to the scientific process that any hypothesis be “tested” by reference to the natural world that we experience with our senses. The tests to which scientific ideas are subjected include contrasting any hypothesis with the world of experience in a manner that must leave open the possibility that one might reject a particular hypothesis if it leads to wrong predictions about the world of experience. The possibility of empirical falsification of a hypothesis is carried out by ascertaining whether or not precise predictions derived as logical consequences from the hypothesis agree with the state of affairs found in the empirical world. A hypothesis that cannot be subject to the possibility of rejection by observation and experiment cannot be regarded as scientific.\n\nThere are 2 basic components in the process by which scientific knowledge advances. The first component consists of the formulation of a con jecture or hypothesis about the natural world. The second component consists of testing the hypothesis by ascertaining whether deductions derived from the hypothesis are indeed the case in the real world. This procedural practice has become known as the hypothetico-deductive method, often characterized as “the” scientific method. It is of the essence of the testing process that the predictions derived from the hypothesis to be tested not be already known, if the observations to be made are to serve as a genuine test of the hypothesis. If a hypothesis is formulated to account for some known phenomena, these phenomena may provide credibility to the hypothesis, but by themselves do not amount to a genuine empirical test of it for the purpose of validating it. The value of a test increases to the extent that the predicted consequences appear to be more and more unlikely before the observations are made.\n\nThe analysis of the hypothetico-deductive method may be traced to William Whewell (1794–1866) and William Stanley Jevons (1835–1882) in England and Charles S. Peirce (1838–1914) in the United States. In the 20th century, 2 philosophers who greatly contributed to identify the key features of the hypothetico-deductive method, and are broadly credited for this work, are Karl Popper (1902–1994) (Popper, 1959, 1963) and C. G. Hempel (1905–1997) (Hempel, 1965). But there is no better way of understanding the basic components of the scientific method, and its variations in different disciplines and peculiarities in different practitioners, than examining the work of great scientists, whose enormous accomplishments were made possible by their appropriate methodology. Early eminent practitioners of the hypothetico-deductive methodology include Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) and Isaac Newton (1624–1727). Among biologist contemporaries of Darwin, one might mention Claude Bernard (1813–1878), Louis Pasteur (1822–1895), and Gregor Mendel (1822–1884).\n\nIMAGINATION AND CORROBORATION\n\nSome of these scientists explicitly described the methodology they followed in their research. Notable is the case of Claude Bernard (1865), who clearly describes the 2 stages of the scientific method: formulation of a testable hypothesis and testing it. Moreover, Bernard explicitly asserts that scientific theories of necessity are only partial and provisional.\n\nA hypothesis is … the obligatory starting point of all experimental reasoning. Without it no investigation would be possible, and one would learn nothing: one could only pile up barren observations. To experiment without a preconceived idea is to wander aimlessly…. Those who have condemned the use of hypotheses and preconceived ideas in the experimental method have made the mistake of confusing the contriving of the experiment with the verification of its results…. When propounding a general theory in science, the one thing one can be sure of is that, in the strict sense, such theories are mistaken. They are only partial and provisional truths which are necessary… to carry the investigation forward; they represent only the current state of our understanding and are bound to be modified by the growth of science.\n\nA contemporary scientist, the Nobel Prize recipient François Jacob, has described research in the lab as an interplay between imagination (hypothesis formulation) and experiment:\n\nWhat had made possible analysis of bacteriophage multiplication, and understanding of its different stages, was above all of the play of hypotheses and experiments, constructs of the imagination and inferences that could be drawn from them. Starting with a certain conception of the system, one designed an experiment to test one or another aspect of this conception. Depending on the results, one modified the conception to design another experiment. And so on and so forth. That is how research in biology worked. Contrary to what once I thought, scientific progress did not consist simply in observing, in accumulating experimental facts and drawing up a theory from them. It began with the invention of a possible world, or a fragment thereof, which was then compared by experimentation with the real world. And it was this constant dialogue between imagination and experiment that allowed one to form an increasingly fine-grained conception of what is called reality.\n\nJacob (1988, pp. 224–225)\n\nAs pointed out above, science is a complex enterprise that essentially consists of 2 interdependent episodes, one imaginative or creative, the other critical. To have an idea, advance a hypothesis, or suggest what might be true is a creative exercise. However, scientific conjectures or hypotheses must also be subject to critical examination and empirical testing. Scientific thinking may be characterized as a process of invention or discovery followed by validation or confirmation. One process concerns the formulation of new ideas (“acquisition of knowledge”), the other concerns their validation (“justification of knowledge”).\n\nScientists like other people come upon new ideas in all sorts of ways: from conversation with other people, reading books and newspapers, inductive generalizations, and even dreams and mistaken observations. Newton is said to have been inspired by a falling apple. Kekulé had been unsuccessfully attempting to devise a model for the molecular structure of benzene. One evening he was dozing in front of the fire. The flames appeared to Kekulé as snake-like arrays of atoms. Suddenly one snake appeared to bite its own tail and then whirled mockingly in front of him. The circular appearance of the image inspired in him the model of benzene as a hexagonal ring. The model to explain the evolutionary diversification of species came to Darwin while riding in his coach and observing the countryside. “I can remember the very spot in the road … when to my joy the solution came to me…. The solution, as I believe, is that the modified offspring … tend to become adapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature” (Barlow, 1958, pp. 120–121).\n\nHypotheses and other imaginative conjectures are the initial stage of scientific inquiry. It is the imaginative conjecture of what might be true that provides the incentive to seek the truth and a clue as to where we might find it. Hypotheses guide observation and experiment because they suggest what to observe. The empirical work of scientists is guided by hypotheses, whether explicitly formulated or simply in the form of vague conjectures or hunches about what the truth might be. However, imaginative conjecture and empirical observation are mutually interdependent episodes. Observations made to test a hypothesis are often the inspiring source of new conjectures or hypotheses. As described by Jacob, the results of an experiment often inspire the modification of a hypothesis and the design of new experiments to test it.\n\nThe starting point of scientific inquiry is the conception of an idea, a process that is, however, not a subject of investigation for logic or epistemology. The complex conscious and unconscious events underlying the creative mind are properly the interest of empirical psychology. The creative process is not unique to scientists. Philosophers and novelists, poets, and painters are also creative; they, too, advance models of experience and also generalize by induction. What distinguishes science from other forms of knowledge is the process by which this knowledge is justified or corroborated, at least provisionally, by observation and experimentation.\n\nPHYLOGENY AND CLASSIFICATION\n\nSome philosophers of science have claimed that evolutionary biology is a historical science that does not need to satisfy the requirements of the hypothetico-deductive method. The evolution of organisms, it is argued, is a historical process that depends on unique and unpredictable events, and thus is not subject to the formulation of testable hypotheses and theories. Such claims emanate from a monumental misunderstanding. There are 2 kinds of questions in the study of biological evolution. One concerns history: the study of phylogeny, the unraveling and description of the actual course of evolution on Earth that has led to the present state of the biological world. The scientific disciplines contributing to the study of phylogeny include taxonomy, systematics, paleontology, biogeography, comparative anatomy, comparative embryology, and comparative molecular biology. The second kind of question concerns the elucidation of the mechanisms or processes that bring about evolutionary change. These questions deal with causal, rather than historical, relationships. Population genetics, population ecology, paleobiology, molecular biology, and many other branches of biology are the relevant disciplines.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the causal study of evolution proceeds by the formulation and empirical testing of hypotheses, according to the hypothetico-deductive methodology that is also characteristic of the physicochemical sciences and other empirical disciplines concerned with causal processes. But the study of evolutionary history is also based on the formulation of empirically testable hypotheses. Consider a simple example. For many years specialists proposed that the evolutionary lineage leading to humans separated from the lineage leading to the great apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan) before the lineages of the great apes separated from each other. Some recent authors have suggested instead that humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas are more closely related to each other than the chimpanzee and the gorilla are to the orangutan and other Asian apes. A wealth of empirical predictions can be derived logically from these competing hypotheses. One prediction concerns the degree of similarity between enzymes and other proteins. It is known that the rate of amino acid substitutions is approximately constant when averaged over many proteins and long periods of time. If the older hypothesis is correct, the average amount of protein differentiation should be greater between humans and the African apes than among these and orangutans. However, if the newer hypothesis is correct, humans, gorillas, and chimpanzees should have greater protein similarity than any of the 3 has with orangutans. These alternative predictions provide a critical empirical test of the hypotheses. The available data favor the second hypothesis. Humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas appear to be phylogenetically more closely related to each other than any one of them is related to orangutans, and chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than they are to gorillas.\n\nCertain biological disciplines relevant to the study of evolution are largely descriptive and classificatory. Description and classification are necessary activities in all branches of science, but play a greater role in certain biological disciplines, such as systematics and biogeography, than in other disciplines, such as population genetics. Nevertheless, taxonomy, systematics, and biogeography also use the hypothetico-deductive method and formulate empirically testable hypotheses (Brooks and McLennan, 1991; Hillis et al., 1996)."
