He used to be Gumball's pet goldfish, but one day, he grew legs and generally adapted to life outside of water, so he was adopted by the Watterson family.\n\nAppearance\n\nDarwin is an orange goldfish with arms and legs. His goldfish-shaped head takes up his entire body, with his fins and legs hanging down from it. He has retained his goldfish tail and fins, the latter of which he now uses as arms and hands. His legs are much longer than his body, ending with plain feet matching the color and texture of the rest of his body. Usually, though, he covers them with green and white sneakers. Darwin is also shown to have a bubbly butt on the back of his head, as revealed in the official trailer. The inside of Darwin's mouth is red, and his tongue is red-orange. In his season 1 design, the shadow cast by his head on his legs was commonly misconceived as a black shirt and pants.\n\nDarwin apparently has thick coatings of blubber, making him resistant to massive pain, as he is shown unharmed in \"The Responsible,\" after a painful face-first slap on a concrete sidewalk from way up in the air. The blubber's depth is about the length of Gumball's arm, as shown in \"The DVD,\" where Gumball had to sink his whole arm into Darwin's head just to reach his cheekbone. Darwin also thinks he has perfect skin as shown in \"The DVD.\" Whenever Darwin's feet are bare, they are often pixelated, as in \"The Meddler.\" However, sometimes they are not pixelated, as shown in \"The Club,\" when he is swimming, in \"The Goons,\" when he is toe wrestling Richard, and in \"The Dream,\" when he dreams of being in the mall without his shoes on. In \"The Dream,\" he says that he considers his feet worthy of a censor, because it is the only place he wears clothes.\n\nIn season 2, Darwin gets a redesign. His black shadow is more transparent, almost to the point where it is not noticeable. Also, his legs are slightly thicker, and there are two eyelashes on each eye, instead of three. Like his family, his eyes are more round.\n\nSince Season 3, Darwin's eyes have been permanently round along with the rest of his family.\n\nIn the early reel, Darwin was originally a 3D animated character.\n\nPersonality\n\nDarwin is a very happy and positive person. He is optimistic, always trying to see the best in most of the scenarios he is in, and in general, always tries to have a smile on his face. Not only does he desire to be happy, but he also desires to see others happy. His selfless acts of happiness can be seen in episodes such as \"The Fan,\" \"The Advice,\" and \"The Stories.\" In all three episodes, he chooses to do the things he does in order to make a particular sad person happier.\n\nDarwin is also a very grateful person. As seen in \"The Flower\" and \"The Night,\" Darwin is shown not wanting much and just being happy with his current life.\n\nDarwin expects the best in people, and his optimism extends to a romantic and somewhat naïve view on the world. His idealistic viewpoints can be seen in \"The Wicked\" in which, despite his brother's views and Mrs. Robinson's obvious malicious intent, he firmly believes that Mrs. Robinson is a good person at heart, and that there is a reason for her actions.\n\nDarwin has a strong sense of honesty; he also desires to tell the truth, no matter how much trouble it may cause. His strong sense of honesty can be seen in \"The Shell\" and \"The Gift,\" in which he cannot adhere to the simplest of Gumball's white lies. His honesty, however, is prevailed by his politeness towards others; in \"The Words,\" Gumball encourages him to bluntly suggest his opinions towards students.\n\nDarwin is also morally grounded in general; he is typically the one to stop his siblings from doing anything wrong, and he is slow to take \"shady\" approaches. Darwin's reluctance to do anything wrong can be seen in \"The DVD,\" in which he tells Gumball not to pirate Alligators on a Train, opting for a more honest and cleaner route. This trait of Darwin is what causes Gumball to see him as a \"moral guardian\" as evidenced in \"The Sidekick.\"\n\nDarwin is also very sensitive and empathetic. He is very affectionate of others, as seen in his interactions with his family, and specifically Gumball, throughout the series. This love and affection may be a weakness of his; however, as a result, he is very possessive without his loved ones, and feels very lonely when not around them. Such is evidenced in \"The Bros\" and \"The Burden,\" in which Penny's newfound relationship with Gumball makes him jealous (presumably for the first time in his life, as suggested by the events of \"The Flower\").\n\nDespite Darwin's general happiness and positivity, he has been known to get angry at times when pushed beyond his limit. Although it is a side of his personality not often seen, \"The Banana\" and \"The Words\" both show that he can resort to senseless violence when given a reason to do so.\n\nRelationships\n\nMain article: Darwin Watterson/Relationships\n\nGallery\n\nClick here to view the gallery.\n\nVoice actors\n\nEnglish:\n\nKwesi Boakye (season 1–\"The Kids\")\n\nTerrell Ransom, Jr. (\"The Kids\"–\"The Copycats\")\n\nDonielle T.

When the show was not produced, he added Darwin to the show, because he liked his design.[5]\n\nAccording to an early draft of the show, Darwin was originally the class goldfish rather than Gumball's pet.[6]\n\nDarwin is in a relationship with Carrie, as of \"The Matchmaker.\"\n\nDarwin is shown to have a major crush on her in previous episodes, such as \"Halloween,\" \"The Oracle,\" and \"The Scam.\" In \"The Oracle,\" he appears to be embarrassed about it.\n\nDarwin seems to be multilingual, as he spoke a complex Chinese sentence in \"The DVD,\" and spoke French in \"The Treasure,\" though the latter may only have been a temporary ability gained through hypnosis, and the subtitles for the former only stated \"No.\" He also spoke Cantonese in \"The Others,\" ironically in order to tell Clare that he and Gumball did not speak said language.\n\nDarwin is also capable of speaking to non-anthropomorphic animals, as seen in \"The Question,\" \"The Traitor,\" and \"The Origins: Part Two.\"\n\nIn Project Exonaut, Darwin is available as an exosuit for 1,000 coins.\n\nIn \"The Dress,\" Darwin uses his left hand when he draws Gumball in the dress. However, he does other common tasks with his right hand. This suggests that he may be ambidextrous. It might be a development oversight as well.\n\nDarwin most likely has the longest name out of any character. He has seven names, as shown in \"The Party.\"\n\nDarwin's name is most likely based on the scientist Charles Darwin, who gained fame for his theory of evolution. A fish with legs or a \"Darwin fish\" is also considered somewhat of a universal symbol for Darwinism.\n\n\"Raglan\" may refer to HMS Raglan, a World War I Royal Navy monitor vessel. The name may also be a reference to the township of Raglan, New Zealand. The town is well known for its surfing, as well as a rare subspecies of dolphin. Darwin has been shown to have the ability to utilize echolocation, as dolphins do.\n\n\"Caspian\" is likely a reference to the Caspian Sea, the world's largest enclosed body of water. Prince Caspian is a character in C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia series. Darwin and the prince both possess many similar traits, and Prince Caspian rode through the sea on a ship called the Dawn Treader.\n\nAhab, another of Darwin's middle names, is a reference to Captain Ahab, a sea captain obsessed with killing the white whale Moby-Dick in the book of the same name.\n\n\"Poseidon\" is a reference to Poseidon (known as Neptune in Roman mythology), the god of the seas from Greek mythology. Poseidon is also the god of horses, and Darwin is shown to be used by Gumball as a mount on more than one occasion.\n\nNicodemus the Hagiorite was a saint who lived from 1749-1809. He was purported to possess a love for all things, much like Darwin's seemingly constant outlook on life. Nicodemus was also in the Bible, being 'reborn' as a Christian. This parallels Darwin's transformation from ordinary fish to a \"reverse mermaid.\"\n\nDarwin has a habit of standing in his seat as opposed to sitting down, especially in season 1.\n\nIn \"The Party,\" Darwin claims to be part suckerfish.\n\nDarwin is quite athletic. He can run as fast as both Anais and Gumball, as shown in \"The Quest,\" \"The Kiss,\" and \"The Remote,\" can climb faster than Gumball, and is a skilled swimmer.\n\nIn \"The Words,\" it is revealed that he is bald, although in \"The Refund,\" it is shown that he can grow leg hair, as well as scalp hair in \"The Voice.\"\n\nIn \"The Bet,\" it is revealed that it took Darwin five years to learn facial expressions, and he still has some trouble recognizing them.\n\nThe events of \"The Origins\" and \"The Origins: Part Two\" reveal that Darwin was given to Gumball because he needed a new pet fish to replace the dead ones.\n\nIn \"The Game,\" it is revealed that he is the third of the several fishes named \"Darwin\" that the Wattersons have owned, hence his name.\n\nIn \"The Internet,\" Darwin is shown to be good at playing the ukulele.\n\nIn \"The Dress,\" Darwin draws Gumball really well. This could mean Darwin is an expert artist. However in \"The Mustache,\" \"The Procrastinators,\" and the Darwin's Yearbook episode \"Carrie,\" his drawings are somewhat juvenile and sloppy. In the latter episode, he himself states that he is terrible at drawing.\n\nAccording to the episode \"Halloween,\" Darwin has samhainophobia, a fear of Halloween.\n\nAs revealed in \"The Castle\" and \"The Flakers,\" Darwin is able to scream at an extremely high-pitched volume. It is so high that it can break the glasses from all the houses of a block.\n\nIn \"The Recipe,\" it is revealed that Darwin believes people are born on cabbage patches.\n\nDarwin is affectionate; he likes being kissed, as seen in \"The Kiss,\" holding hands (Gumball mimics him saying so in \"The Sidekick\"), and hugs, as he states in “The Hero.\"\n\nIn \"The Void,\" Darwin's design from the early reel can be seen in the background of the Void.\n\nAccording to \"The Allergy,\" he is allergic to feathers.\n\nIn \"The Burden,\" it is revealed that Darwin is possessive and fears being lonely.\n\nAlso, in the same episode, it is implied that he had previous families when he \"talks\" to Chris Morris about him not being one of his dads and when he mentions Gumball being his \"brother from another mother\" in \"The Bros.\"\n\n\"The Apprentice,\" \"The Awkwardness,\" \"The Singing,\" \"The Spinoffs,\" and \"The Transformation\" are the only episodes that he does not appear in.\n\nReferences\n\nv • e Characters Italicized characters are considered extremely minor Watterson family Gumball • Darwin • Anais • Nicole • Richard • Granny Jojo • Louie • Evil Turtle (family pet) • Frankie Robinson family Gaylord • Margaret • Rocky Fitzgerald family Penny • Patrick • Judith • Polly • Mr. Cuddles (family pet) Wilson family Tobias • Jackie • Harold • Rachel Banana family Banana Joe • Banana Barbara • Banana Bob Rex family Tina • Mr. Rex Keane family Alan • Dexter • Jessica Jötunheim family Hector • Mrs. Jötunheim Parham family Felicity • Billy Yoshida family Masami • Mr. Yoshida • Yuki School faculty Nigel Brown • Lucy Simian • Steve Small • Coach Russo • Joan Markham • Librarian • Moonchild Corneille • Tree librarian Student body Carrie • Bobert • Sarah • Leslie • Teri • Colin and Felix • Carmen • Molly • Jamie • Idaho • Anton • Ocho • Juke • Sussie • Clayton • William • Rob • Hot Dog Guy • Julius • Green bear • Mushroom • Fuzzball • Razor • 8-bit dog • Reaper • Mowdown • Rotten cupcake • Scythe • Clare • Jared • Wilson • Jodie • Rainbow octopus • Bulldog • Gregory • Mole • Josh • Peter Senior citizens Marvin • Gary • Alison • Blue elephant • Betty • Donald Other Elmore residents Larry • Donut Cop • Sal Left Thumb • Martha • Kenneth • Karen • Pantsbully • Tony • Hexagon lady • Santa Claus • Paperball • Lenny • Construction men • Hobo • Shooting star • Rosie • Clipboard men • Egg man • Cube dogs • Cyclops dog • Rats • Sun • Earth • Moon • Purple squirrel • Pink squirrel • Creatures • Orange guards • Bandage doctor • Melted cheese guy • Hamburger Cop • Cowboy • Jeff • Susan • Siciliana • Quattro • Hayden • Internet • Exercise bacon • Shape people • Teal tow truck driver • Saturn • Sausage dog • Tan dog • Carlton • Troy • Green security guard • Bandage paramedics • Ghosts • Coffee cop • Mr. Verde • Idaho's family • French fries • Anton's parents • Richwood High students • Gumball's brain • Dr. Butt • Sussie's parents • Ripley 2000 manager • \"Porky\" Cassidy • Office Goblin • Goblin • Dolphin man • Spray-paint bottle • Butterknife • Mr. Chanax • Manly warrior • Pest controller • Soulless office worker • Oval family • Timmy • Charlie • Drum kit guy • Hot Dog Guy lookalike • Cupcake man • Mike • Ken • Kip Schlezinger • Clown • Hand security officer • Sally the Snake • Earl • Sphere citizens • Leonard Daniels • Van shopkeeper • Human • Milk guy • Old doctor • Gargaroth • Brydie • Mayor of Elmore • Flight attendant • Daniel • Mary • Maria • Joao • Phil • Kayvon • Charlie-Ann • Book doctor • Teapot • Debbie Single appearance Jealousy • Blitzer • Virus • Frank Kreese • Daniel Lennard • Ant-One • Ant-Two • Anton clones • Zach • Scary old man • Scary old lady • Chicken Bucket • Chris Morris • Vlad • Sluzzle Dude • Butterfly • Chimera • New Bobert • Abraham Lincoln goat • Evil Turtle's babies • Chi Chi • Ribbit • Chi Chi's parents • Troll • Game Child • Howdy • Frank • Grady • Russian agents • Ethel and Bernie • Mr. Gruber • Azrael • Rainbow Factory shareholders • Fuzzy Objects Daisy the Donkey • Elmore dollar • Solar System"
