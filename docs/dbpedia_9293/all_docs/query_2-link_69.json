        "text": "Charles DarwinAn English naturalist (1809-1882). In 1859 Darwin published On the Origin of Species, which outlined his theory of evolution. was an English naturalist who studied variation in plants, animals and fossils during a five-year voyage around the world in the 19th century. Darwin visited four continents on the ship HMS Beagle.\n\nDarwin observed many organisms including finches, tortoises and mockingbirds, during his five-week visit to the GalapÃ¡gos IslandsIslands in the Pacific Ocean, visited by Charles Darwin., near Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean. He continued to work and develop his ideas once he returned from his voyages.\n\nDarwinâs theory of evolution by natural selection challenged the idea that God made all the animals and plants that live on Earth. This idea contradicted the commonly held Christian views of his era. Darwinâs world expedition and observations, were backed by many years of experimentation, discussions with like-minded scientists and his developing knowledge of geology and fossils. Finally he felt able to propose his theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin published his scientific work and ideas 28 years after his voyage."
