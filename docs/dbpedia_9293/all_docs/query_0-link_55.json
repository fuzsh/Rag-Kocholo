        "text": "Charles Darwin (1809-1882) was an English naturalist and geologist, best known for his theory of evolution as published in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species. He suffered from ill health for most of his adult life, but remained undiagnosed. It has been theorised that he suffered from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), although many other diseases have also been suggested as possibilities.\n\nPresentation of illness[edit | edit source]\n\nFor over forty years Darwin suffered intermittently from various combinations of symptoms such as: malaise, vertigo, dizziness, muscle spasms and tremors, vomiting, cramps and colics, bloating and nocturnal intestinal gas, headaches, alterations of vision, severe tiredness, nervous exhaustion, dyspnea, skin problems such as blisters all over the scalp and eczema, crying, anxiety, sensation of impending death and loss of consciousness, fainting, tachycardia, insomnia, tinnitus, and depression.\n\nTheories[edit | edit source]\n\nChronic Fatigue Syndrome[edit | edit source]\n\nDid Darwin have ME/CFS? - Zaher Nahle\n\nDarwin’s illness revisited: misconceptions or facts? Comment by Norman Booth\n\nRobert Youngson proposes in his monograph Darwin's Mysterious Illness that Darwin suffered from CFS.\n\nOther suggestions[edit | edit source]\n\nAsperger's syndrome or other pervasive developmental disorder\n\nChagas disease\n\nCrohn's disease\n\nCyclic vomiting syndrome\n\nLactose intolerance\n\nLupus erythematosus\n\nMénière's disease\n\nTick-borne disease\n\nPanic disorder with agoraphobia\n\nObsessive–compulsive disorder\n\nPsychosomatic disease\n\nPostural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome\n\nOrthostatic intolerance\n\nHelicobacter pylori\n\nMELAS syndrome\n\nLearn more[edit | edit source]\n\nWikipedia - Charles Darwin's health\n\nDarwin's Mysterious Illness - Robert Youngson\n\nThe illness of Charles Darwin: a retrospective diagnosis.\n\nSee also[edit | edit source]\n\nFlorence Nightingale\n\nElizabeth Barrett Browning\n\nMarie Curie"
