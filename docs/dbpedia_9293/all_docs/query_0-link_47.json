        "text": "Story\n\nOUR HISTORY\n\nSince 1985, Saatchi Gallery has presented contemporary art exhibitions showcasing the work of emerging artists. Exhibitions which drew upon the collection of Charles Saatchi, led to Saatchi Gallery becoming a recognised authority in contemporary art globally. The Gallery acquired a strong reputation for introducing artists who would later gain worldwide recognition. In 2019 Saatchi Gallery became a registered charity and began a new chapter in its history.\n\nOUR MISSION\n\nSaatchi Gallery exists as a registered charity to provide an innovative platform for contemporary art and culture. We are committed to supporting artists and rendering contemporary art accessible to all. We strive to present projects in physical and digital spaces that are engaging, enlightening and educational for diverse audiences.\n\nOUR VALUES\n\nSaatchi Gallery seeks to collaborate with artists in an open and honest manner with a primary aim of introducing their work to wider audiences.\n\nThe Gallery presents curated exhibitions on themes relevant and exciting in the context of contemporary creative culture. Our educational programmes aim to reveal the possibilities of artistic expression to young minds, encourage fresh thought and stimulate innovation.\n\nAs a charity, the organisation seeks to be self-funded and reinvests all revenue into its core activities to support access to contemporary art for all."
