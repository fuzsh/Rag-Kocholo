        "text": "The evolutionary biologist Jochen Wolf was working from home when we first spoke, in April, 2020. Germany was under lockdown, and his lab, at Ludwig Maximilian University, in Munich, had been closed for weeks. Still, a reminder of his research had followed him from the office. “I have a crow nest right in front of me,” Wolf said, from his rooftop terrace. The nest was well hidden at the top of a tall spruce tree. Through the branches, Wolf could see a female crow sitting on her eggs.\n\nOver the years, Wolf had climbed many similar trees to gather genetic material from crow nests. He had also collected samples from falconers whose goshawks hunt the birds. By comparing the genomes of European crows, Wolf wanted to bring fresh data to one of biology’s oldest and most intractable debates. Scientists have named more than a million different species, but they still argue over how any given species evolves into another and do not even agree on what, exactly, a “species” is. “I have just been comparing definitions of species,” Charles Darwin wrote to a friend, three years before he would publish “On the Origin of Species,” in 1859. “It is really laughable to see what different ideas are prominent in various naturalists’ minds.” To an extent, the same holds true today. It is difficult to find a definition of “species” that works for organisms as different as goshawks and spruce trees. Similarly, it can be hard to draw a line between organisms among whom there are only small differences, such as the goshawks in North America, Europe, and Siberia. Are they separate species, subspecies, or simply locally adapted populations of a single type?\n\nDarwin thought that the blurriness of species boundaries was a clue that the living world was not a divine creation but actually changing over time. He encouraged biologists to treat species as “merely artificial combinations made for convenience,” which would never map perfectly onto nature. “We shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species,” he wrote. His imprecision, however, did not sit well with all of his successors. One of the most influential evolutionary biologists of the twentieth century, a German-born ornithologist named Ernst Mayr, attacked Darwin for failing “to solve the problem indicated by the title of his work.” Darwin had shown how natural selection honed a species to its niche, but he’d “never seriously attempted a rigorous analysis of the problem of the multiplication of species, of the splitting of one species into two,” Mayr wrote, in 1963. Mayr, who spent much of his career at Harvard, called speciation “the most important single event in evolution,” and proposed reproductive isolation as an “objective yardstick” for understanding it: individuals of a sexually reproducing species could procreate with one another but not with individuals of other species.\n\nFor decades, Mayr’s arguments dominated evolutionary thought. But consensus was crumbling by the two-thousands, when Wolf confronted the species problem. Wolf had learned Mayr’s “biological species concept” as a student, but he’d also discovered dozens of competing species concepts with alternative criteria, such as an animal’s form, ecology, evolutionary history, and ability to recognize potential mates. (Philosophers had joined the debate, too, with head-scratching questions about the ontological status of a species.) “The more you looked into it, the more confused you got,” Wolf said. Mayr had written that “the process of speciation could not be understood until after the nature of species and of geographic variation had been clarified.” But, in time, Wolf had come to believe the opposite: the nature of species could not be understood until the process of speciation—the ebb and flow of genetic differences between populations, and the evolution of reproductive isolation—had been clarified.\n\nAs Wolf and I spoke, a pair of crows landed on my balcony in Berlin. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I had been feeding them hard-boiled eggs and peanuts; that morning I’d set out a jar of water, thinking that they might enjoy a drink as well. The birds were a good example of the species problem. In Munich, Wolf was watching all-black carrion crows; in Berlin, I was watching hooded crows with gray breasts and bodies. During the most recent ice age, glaciers in the Alps and Scandinavia divided an ancestral population of crows into two. At that time, all the crows were probably black. The eastern population found refuge in the Balkans or the Middle East and turned gray for some reason—perhaps lighter feathers helped them stay cool—whereas the western population retreated into Spain. Twelve thousand years ago, when the glaciers melted, the two populations reconvened, in Central Europe. Carrion and hooded crows sometimes interbred and produced fertile and healthy offspring in a narrow hybrid zone running through cities such as Dresden and Vienna. But the birds retained distinct identities on both sides of this feather curtain. “It’s black and gray crows with a hybrid zone exactly through the center of Germany,” Wolf said. Mayr himself had wondered why the two groups did not recombine into a single population. Others saw them as a case that contradicted Mayr’s ideas.\n\nWolf believed that, using powerful new genome-sequencing technology, he could find an answer to the mystery of the crows’ species. But his first results, published in the journal Science, in 2014, suggested that any concept of species was inadequate for capturing the reality of the crows’ evolution and, by extension, the complexity of the natural world. “No matter how hard we try, there cannot be a robust, all-inclusive, objective species concept,” the Dutch geneticist Peter de Knijff wrote, in a commentary that appeared alongside Wolf’s study. Instead, an emerging field, speciation genomics, was leaving the species concept behind.\n\nA few weeks after my phone call with Wolf, Germany eased its travel restrictions, and I took a train from Berlin to Munich to visit him. The route traversed the crow hybrid zone, but I did not see any birds until I disembarked on the other side. A pair of carrion crows rested on a rooftop antenna across the street from my hotel room. After months of watching hooded crows from my apartment in Berlin, I thought the carrion crows seemed as spectacular as hyacinth macaws.\n\n“I think it’s an age thing,” Wolf said, when I told him how much I had come to enjoy my observations of the crows. Tall and fit, with shoulder-length hair and a strong jaw, Wolf had started studying local birds in his thirties. Born outside of Munich, in 1976, he spent his boyhood in the Bavarian forests that skirt the Alps, and he was drawn to biology as a way to keep on playing in the woods. Later, he studied the behaviors of wolves in Poland, black bears in Maine, and sea lions in the Galápagos Islands. In the Galápagos, it was natural to grow interested in Darwin and evolution. “You start asking, Why does this pup thrive and get fat and healthy and the other one doesn’t?” Wolf said. As a Ph.D. student, in the early two-thousands, he wanted to find out whether sea lions associated mainly with their family members or also “made friends” with nonrelatives. Wolf snuck up on beached sea lions and wrestled them to the ground while a colleague nicked a sample from their flippers; he would later determine the sea lions’ blood relations, using a method patented by a German geneticist named Diethard Tautz. (The method was similar to the paternity tests used by American talk-show hosts in popular “You Are Not the Father!” segments.)\n\nWolf travelled to Cologne to analyze the tissue samples in Tautz’s lab. Beginning in the nineteen-eighties, Tautz had spent his career sequencing DNA, focussing on only a few hundred base pairs at a time. He was looking to see whether DNA might solve the species puzzle. Decades earlier, Mayr had argued that reproductive isolation can only develop in geographic isolation, after an impassable physical barrier, such as a mountain range or a river, divides a population in two; without migration the two populations would evolve into different species that could remain separate even when the barrier dried up or crumbled. This model, which Mayr called allopatric, or other-place, speciation, became the textbook standard of speciation, even though plenty of organisms appeared to have evolved without a geographic barrier. Some African lakes, for example, contain hundreds of species of colorful fish called cichlids; it was hard to imagine each species evolving in isolation, but Mayr and other mid-century leaders of evolutionary biology were dismissive of alternative ideas. (“These species have come into contact only after they had evolved,” Mayr wrote, of the fish.) For Tautz, the question was not whether allopatric speciation was valid—everyone agreed it was—but whether it was the only way species could diversify. “The allopatric paradigm was based on a few facts, a lot of faith, and on paradigmatic despots ruling the field,” he wrote.\n\nIn the early nineties, one of Tautz’s students, Ulrich Schliewen, brought him samples of cichlids he had collected from two small crater lakes in Cameroon. There were no barriers in either crater lake, and also no fertile hybrid forms. Either each species had evolved somewhere else and invaded the lake before its source population went extinct, as Mayr claimed, or they had all evolved together in their lake, through a process of sympatric, or same-place, speciation. Schliewen and Tautz sequenced a short snippet of mitochondrial DNA from each fish. By comparing the sequences, they could work their way backward to calculate the time of the organisms’ most recent common ancestor. The results indicated that the two ancestors of the twenty different species had lived and diversified within each lake. It was solid evidence of sympatric speciation.\n\nNature published Schliewen and Tautz’s study in 1994. The next year, in a paper in Trends in Ecology & Evolution, an English biologist named James Mallet attacked the biological species concept itself, finding it “neither useful in practice nor in evolutionary theory.” In his own research, Mallet was identifying frequent hybridization between commonly recognized species of tropical butterflies. Other scientists were discovering natural hybridization between wolves and coyotes, blue whales and fin whales, and human beings and Neanderthals. Reproductive isolation was obviously a point of no return in the speciation process for sexual organisms—a goshawk and a spruce tree could not procreate—but it no longer seemed as absolute or inviolable as Mayr had proposed. “Processes leading to speciation are continuous, rather than sudden,” Mallet wrote.\n\nSome scientists responded to these revelations by trying to come up with new and better species concepts. Others, like Tautz and Mallet, decided to focus on the speciation process. Working in Tautz’s lab, Wolf recalled some of his Galápagos experiences. Even though a sea lion could swim across the Galápagos archipelago, there were differences between sea lions on the western and central islands. The western sea lions mainly hunted deep-sea critters, whereas the central sea lions foraged in warmer, shallower waters. The shapes of the animals’ skulls in the two communities differed. Would their genomes differ, too?\n\nJust a few years earlier, most scientists would have predicted that the answer was no. But Wolf and Tautz, in sequencing only a few short segments of the genome, found genetic differences to match the ones in feeding patterns and morphology. In 2008, they concluded that the allopatric, or geographic, model was an artifact of a time when it had been possible to study speciation only long after the process was complete. DNA sequencing allowed scientists to look into the process while it was unfolding. The sea lions fell along what Mallet and others had called the “species continuum”; their differences, Wolf and Tautz wrote, “may potentially lead to the emergence of a new species over time.”\n\nTautz invited Wolf to stay on at his lab, and Wolf agreed. In speciation, Wolf had found a focus for his academic career; in Tautz, he’d found a mentor. “Diethard taught me to think big,” Wolf recalled. “To address a fundamental question, it usually takes large sample sizes, resources, and a lot of time. He helped me find the courage to initiate the crow research.”\n\nIn 2007, Wolf followed Tautz to the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, in Plön, a small lakeside town near the Danish border. It was there, while browsing books on European birds, that Wolf grew interested in crows. If you left a peanut on any windowsill in Europe, there was a good chance that a crow—either carrion or hooded—would be the first animal to pick it up. It would be possible to study the birds without dragging his wife and young children halfway around the globe.\n\nThe taxonomy of European crows had been a problem for centuries. Carl Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist who invented the modern system of taxonomy, first classified carrion and hooded crows as separate species in 1758. Since then, many taxonomists had argued that they should be considered subspecies instead. On the one hand, the crows were visually and geographically distinct; on the other, they were ecologically identical and produced fertile offspring. Even inside the hybrid zone, however, hooded and carrion crows tended to mate with their own kind. Only occasionally would they form a hybrid pair. Hybrid crows blended the appearances of their parents: grayer than carrion crows, darker than hooded ones. The pattern on their breasts sometimes looked like herringbone. For Wolf, the interesting question was not whether you called the crows “species” or “subspecies” but how they maintained their distinct appearances and ranges despite the flow of genes through the hybrid zone.\n\nIn 2008, Wolf won a grant to study the crow problem. At Uppsala University, in Sweden, where Linnaeus had once taught biology, Wolf worked with a Dutch Ph.D. student named Jelmer Poelstra. The two looked for genetic differences between the crows. Technology limited them to sequencing just a few hundred base pairs at a time. A year went by. “We found nothing at all,” Poelstra said. But Wolf had also started to tinker with a new technology called high-throughput sequencing. The first human genome had taken thirteen years and billions of dollars to sequence; now advances in computing power and chemistry were making it possible to sequence a full genome for a few thousand dollars in a matter of days. “The advance was so massive it just changed the scope of what you could dream about doing,” Patrik Nosil, an evolutionary biologist who studies speciation in stick insects, said.\n\nWolf became one of the first evolutionary biologists to deploy high-throughput sequencing in the field. He obtained the full genomes of sixty individual crows in an attempt to identify every last genetic difference between the hooded and carrion populations. Wolf and Poelstra, along with a growing team of students, spent years at their computers, poring over terabytes of data and aligning the genomes for each crow. When they first saw the results, in 2012, Wolf wondered if they had made an error. The genomes of hooded and carrion crows mapped almost perfectly onto one another. “They’re identical,” Wolf said.\n\nThere were, of course, variations among individual crows. But only 0.28 per cent of the crows’ genomes could be used to sort the individuals into carrion and hooded populations. In fact, German carrion crows shared more of their DNA with German hooded crows than they did with other carrion crows from Spain. There were only eighty-two base pairs that never matched—less than one ten-millionth of a per cent of the total genome, a fraction so tiny that it should be statistically irrelevant. (By comparison, human beings have millions of fixed genetic differences with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives.) Even the taxonomists who wanted to lump the crows together as a single species would have predicted magnitudes more difference.\n\nAlmost as surprising as the small number of fixed differences was their distribution in the genome. The eighty-two differences were not scattered evenly throughout the crows’ 1.2 billion base pairs of DNA. Eighty-one of them were clustered on the eighteenth chromosome, in a region involving the production of melanin, the pigment that makes a feather black. “To consider genes as independent units is meaningless,” Mayr once wrote; he believed that the genes of a given species worked together to create a “harmoniously integrated” whole. His theory was that even a trace quantity of “alien genes” would undermine a species’ fitness—a major reason why he insisted that speciation required an impassable geographic barrier. But the little section of the crows’ eighteenth chromosome was indeed evolving independently from all its neighbors. Some selective pressure was acting on this tiny region alone.\n\nThe debate over species concepts, Wolf told me, had long assumed “that the genome you’re looking at is one unit.” But that did not seem to be the case. “Different genes behave very differently,” Wolf said. Some genes might cross species boundaries, through hybridization and other processes; others, like the crows’ melanin gene, might stay put and keep species distinct. “You can have a single mutation and then nothing works anymore, or you may need hundreds of genes that have to differentiate before those species don’t reproduce,” Wolf said. Speciation might start with genes related to form, behavior, reproduction, or ecology. The original tweaks that started the speciation process could remain stable or disappear over time. New differences might accumulate behind them, pushing the populations further apart. The genomes of common ravens in western North America record evidence of a speciation reversal: two ancient populations diverged for one to two million years—long enough, normally, for most birds to evolve reproductive isolation—and then fused back together.\n\nBiologists, unsatisfied with Darwin’s view of species as “merely artificial combinations made for convenience,” had longed for a definitive way to pinpoint when a species had been “made.” But genome sequencing showed that Darwin had been closer to the truth. “When you decide to call them species should depend on why you want to call them species,” Chung-I Wu, a biologist from the University of Chicago, told me. Wu compared the process to human development. There is no fixed point at which a child becomes an adult; that determination depends on a variety of biological, cultural, and legal considerations. Similarly, ecologists, conservation biologists, and other scientists are free to choose where in the speciation process it makes the most sense to start thinking about their populations as species. They could also decide to set the term aside altogether. “The academic debate about speciation doesn’t need species concepts,” Wolf said. “It’s not worth fighting about them.”\n\nWhen the crow study by Wolf’s team was published in Science, in 2014, it was one of the first papers to show how high-throughput sequencing could transform our understanding of species and speciation. “Their study was the first convincing demonstration that you could have this one block of the genome that really explained all the difference,” Nosil said. Jerry Coyne, an authority on speciation from the University of Chicago, wrote that the crows’ evolution was “a puzzle that has largely been solved”; de Knijff, the Dutch geneticist, called it a “roadmap for speciation research.” The genomic methods that Wolf deployed have become widespread in biology—including, controversially, in studies of human behavior. Wolf’s group went on to find a similar dynamic at a second crow hybrid zone, in Siberia, where the crows turn from gray to black again. He is currently leading speciation studies in killer whales, cuckoo birds, and yeasts. “The lab is becoming a zoo right now,” he said.\n\nOne question his team could not answer, however, was why crows that are reproductively compatible were sorting themselves according to color. Some people had asked Wolf if the crows were “racist.” He didn’t want to apply such a loaded human concept to animals. Still, the crows did discriminate in their way. Carrion crows wanted to mate with carrion crows, and hooded crows wanted to mate with hooded crows. How could color variation based on such a tiny genetic difference have such a large effect? Wolf thought the answer lay not in the genome but, rather, in the field he had left behind: animal behavior.\n\nKonrad Lorenz, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist from Austria, formalized the study of animal behavior, or ethology, in the middle of the twentieth century. Lorenz’s most famous insight came when he hatched and raised a clutch of goslings. Not only did the young birds treat him as their mother, but, when they matured, they sought out human mates. Lorenz realized the geese had no innate sexual preference; rather, they learned to recognize appropriate mates by imprinting on their parents in the first days of their lives.\n\nCrows and most other birds also imprint. Wolf has come to think that this might be the mechanism of their speciation. If carrion crows imprint on carrion crows and hooded crows imprint on hooded crows, then the occasional hybrid, who looks like neither, will be disadvantaged when it comes to finding mates. This process of “social marginalization,” Wolf believes, may be enough to create effective reproductive isolation, even though the birds’ genomes are perfectly compatible. (In genetic terms, the crows’ imprinting ends up putting divergent selection pressure on chromosome eighteen and nowhere else, allowing the rest of the genome to homogenize.) He now wants to find out just how long this mechanism has been operating. Crow bones are common in ancient human trash piles—“eating crow” used to be more than just a figure of speech—and, by sequencing the DNA from these bones, Wolf hopes to determine whether cavemen ate hooded crows in Eastern Europe and carrion crows in Western Europe, reconstructing the birds’ speciation continuum with data points stretching back thousands of years.\n\nThis spring, Wolf told me that a pair of carrion crows had once again built a nest in a spruce tree outside his house. My hooded crows were still visiting as well. Within a year of lockdowns, their menu had expanded to include not only peanuts and eggs but also cashews, cat food, and canned fish. They’d built their nest in a tree nearby, and, after they’d arrived on my balcony, I could run down the stairs and around the corner to watch them as they delivered to their babies the food I’d left outside. Having grown up in North America, where the crows are black, I had always found the gray plumage of Berlin’s hooded crows dowdy and strange. Now I knew that I was looking at something as revealing as the beak of a finch or the wings of a peppered moth: a uniform fashioned from just a thimbleful of base pairs. It was the seamless needlework of evolutionary change.\n\nA previous version of this article overstated the distance that a sea lion can swim in a day.\n\nMore Science and Technology\n\nWhat happens when patients find out how good their doctors really are?\n\nLife in Silicon Valley during the dawn of the unicorns?\n\nThe end of food.\n\nThe histories hidden in the periodic table.\n\nThe detectives who never forget a face.\n\nWhat is the legacy of Laika, the first animal launched into orbit?\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker."
