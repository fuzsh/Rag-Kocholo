It has comfortable rooms, a kitchen garden, greenhouses and an orchard.\n\n1871-6Publications and Renovations\n\nDarwin publishes extensively, including The Descent of Man. A two-storey wing and glass-roofed veranda are added to the house, nearly doubling its size.\n\nRead a description of Down House\n\n1896-1921A Place for Learning\n\nEmma dies at Down. The house later becomes Downe School for Girls. Another school eventually takes its place but then closes. Down House is left empty.\n\n1996-PresentRestored to Darwin's Designs\n\nEnglish Heritage buys Down House. Structural repairs are carried out, rooms recreated and an exhibition added interpreting Darwin's thoughts as a naturalist. The gardens are also restored.\n\nSee highlights from the collection at Down House"
