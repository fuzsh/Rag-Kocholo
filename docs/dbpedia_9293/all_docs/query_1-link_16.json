        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: Charles Darwin was a British naturalist. During his lifetime people still believed that the rich variety of creatures on earth were created by God. Darwin, however, realized that species adapt to their environments and that this gives rise to subspecies, of which only the best-suited survive. In 1831 Darwin took a research trip to the Galapagos Islands on the vessel H.M.S. Beagle. From his observations on this trip he formulated his theory of evolution. Darwin's great-great-great grandson has done extensive research into just who Charles Darwin was. He knows that he worked fine-tuning his theory for over 20 years before publishing it.\n\nRANDAL KEYNES: \"He could see how the church would reject the argument because it contradicted the Book of Genesis and many of his friends in science.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Thirty kilometers southeast of London, Darwin lived in this house for 40 years. He is said to have been shy and to have had a difficult time of it as a young boy due to his father's authoritative manner. Darwin was often ill. He spent only four hours a day at his desk - yet he is still considered to have been an obsessive collector and a perfectionist. Darwin was not well versed in genetics. His theories were based purely on observation. The greenhouse in his garden - Darwin often called his entire family here to help him with his experiments.\n\nROWAN BLAIK: \"They also helped Darwin with some of his experiments in the garden as well. For example, chasing bumblebees through the meadow, dusting them with flour so they could pick them out and chasing them through the meadow as a team really.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Charles Darwin, his theory of evolution changed forever the way we view life on Earth."
