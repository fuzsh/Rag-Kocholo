His proposition that all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.\" EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN \"There is much to be discovered about the evolution of the brain and the principles that govern it. While much has been discovered, not everything currently known is well understood.\" https://lnkd.in/dPB8EX_B EVOLUTION OF NERVOUS SYSTEMS \"The evolution of nervous systems dates back to the first development of nervous systems in animals (or metazoans). Neurons developed as specialized electrical signaling cells in multicellular animals, adapting the mechanism of action potentials present in motile single-celled and colonial eukaryotes. When some animals started living a mobile lifestyle and eating larger food particles externally, they developed ciliatedepithelia, contractile muscles and coordinating & sensitive neurons for it in their outer layer.\" https://lnkd.in/dxNFTaun MY2CENTS There are some undeniable facts about biological intelligence: 1. Every intelligent organism has a body, with sensors, actuators and organs. 2. An organism exists within a landscape, defined as space and organized matter, both inanimate and animate. 3 Evolution implies gradual changes over time, for the body and the brain. 4. Spiking neural networks include time as a component.
