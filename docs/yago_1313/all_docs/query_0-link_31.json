She was 93 years old.\n\nShe died in her sleep, said her stepdaughter, Suzanne Parry.\n\nMiss Boardman, who was born in Philadelphia, gained nationwide recognition as the \"Kodak Girl\" on Eastman Kodak's advertising posters. From modeling, she moved into movies, starring in silent films including \"Stranger's Banquet,\" \"The Silent Accuser,\" \"Memory Lane\" and \"Tell It to the Marines.\"\n\nIn 1928 she had a leading role in \"The Crowd,\" directed by King Vidor, whom she married. The couple divorced in 1933. She later married the French director Harry D. D'Arrast.\n\nAmong her other credits were \"She Goes to War,\" \"Mamba,\" \"The Flood\" and a remake of \"The Squaw Man.\""
