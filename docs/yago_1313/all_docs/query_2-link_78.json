She was very successful and became the \"Kodak Girl\".\n\nFinally she decided to try her luck in Hollywood. She got her first contract at Goldwyn Pictures in 1922 and took part in \"The Strangers' Banquet\" (22), \"Gimme\" (23) and \"Vanity Fair\" (23).\n\nEspecially director King Vidor became an important support for her career in the next years. She shot with him the movies \"Three Wise Fools\" (23), \"Wine of Youth\" (24), \"The Wife of the Centaur\" (25), \"Proud Flesh\" (25), \"Bardelys the Magnificent\" (26) and their greatest common success \"The Crowd\" (28).\n\nThey got married in 1926.\n\nWhen Goldwyn Pictures merged to MGM she kept at the new company and played for the company regularly in movies till 1932. To her well-known movies for MGM belong among others \"The Circle\" (25), \"She Goes to War\" (29), \"The Great Meadow\" (31) and \"Women Love Once\" (31).\n\nShe left MGM in 1932 and got a divorce from King Vidor.
