        "text": "A number of her films, including \"Wine of Youth\" (1924), the pleasing comedy \"Proud Flesh\" (1925) and the lavish swashbuckler \"Bardelys the Magnificent\" (1926), costarring John Gilbert, were directed by King Vidor, whose second wife she would become in 1926. Vidor also helmed Boardman's best-remembered film, \"The Crowd\" (1928), a remarkable study of an urban Everyman. While critics who generally pictured her in roles on a higher social plane thought her miscast in \"The Crowd,\" Boardman achieved a performance of great subtlety that ranks among the finest in the history of silent screen acting. Unfortunately, her career in sound films, hurt by a series of either poor or unpopular films, quickly waned and she retired to marry director Harry d'Abbadie d'Arrast."
