        "text": "Actress Born Aug. 19, 1898 in Philadelphia, PA\n\nEleanor Boardman was an actress during the silent film era who was married to director King Vidor.\n\nA native of Philadelphia, Boardman won nationwide fame as the \"Kodak Girl\" on posters that advertised Eastman Kodak photographic products.\n\nHer subsequent Hollywood career, which included few talkies, peaked with her leading role in \"The Crowd\" in 1928. Vidor directed the silent film.\n\nBoardman also appeared in such silents as \"Stranger's Banquet,\" \"The Silent Accuser,\" \"Memory Lane\" and \"Tell It to the Marines.\"\n\nHer brief fling with talkies included such films as \"She Goes to War,\" \"Mamba,\" \"The Flood\" and a remake of \"The Squaw Man.\"\n\nBoardman in effect retired from the film business in 1931.\n\nShe divorced Vidor in 1933. They waged several court battles over the next decade over support and custody of their two daughters. Vidor won custody when Boardman took the girls to live in pre-World War II Europe. But she returned to the United States and regained custody of the children.\n\nBoardman was also married to French director Harry D. D'Arrast.\n\nShe was 93 when she died."
