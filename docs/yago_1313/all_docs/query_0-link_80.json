        "text": "Death did not come to silent movies on little cat feet. He burst in singing on October 6, 1927 when\n\nWarner Bros. released “The Jazz Singer.”\n\nThe irony is that silent movies reached their artistic peak in 1928,\n\nsomething that was strikingly demonstrated Tuesday night when the Academy of\n\nMotion Picture Arts and Science and the Mary Pickford Foundation presented King\n\nVidor’s drama about one common man, “The Crowd.”\n\nAs funny as it is sad, “The Crowd” had the audience at the\n\nhalf-filled Academy theatre laughing in all of the right places and none of the\n\nwrong ones. And the acting, particularly\n\nby Eleanor Boardman as the wife of a man fruitlessly trying to climb above the\n\ncrowd (“One of the Mob” was Vidor’s original title) has nothing in common with\n\nthe oversized gestures and dramatic poses that have made some silent films a\n\nmodern joke. Boardman, Vidor’s wife,\n\nexpresses everything from delight to despair with her eyes. As her husband endlessly hoping he will\n\nbecome the “important” man his father promised he would be, James Murray, a\n\nlittle known actor, is less certain and more awkward, as is John Sims. the\n\ncommon man he plays. The score by Carl\n\nDavis is almost uncannily right and helps to take away the need for words.\n\nThe silent film historian Kevin Brownlow who restored “The\n\nCrowd” has called the movie one of ten “Essential” silent films. Interviewed by phone Tuesday afternoon, he\n\nelaborated. “It’s one of the few social\n\nproblem films made during the 1920s and certainly the best of the lot. You’re in the middle of a Depression that\n\nhasn’t happened yet. What’s important is\n\nnot the message but the plight of the people and the characters.”\n\nWhat is most impressive in “The Crowd” is what Brownlow\n\ncalls “its amazing use of expressionist techniques.” He tells a story of Vidor at a European film\n\nfestival where Vittorio De Sica threw his arms around him and said: “The\n\nCrowd! That is why I made ‘The Bicycle\n\nThief.’” He tells the story again in a Q\n\nand A that follows the screening.\n\nImages that have become clichés in American films began is\n\nthis one — the camera climbing up the exterior of a skyscraper and into a huge\n\nroom full of rows of clerks, eyes focused on numbing numbers. Billy Wilder stole that dehumanizing room for\n\n“The Apartment.” And the crowd — the\n\nhordes of people oppressively walking, pushing, sunning on a beach, laughing\n\ntogether at a vaudeville show — is almost as much a character as Mary and John\n\nSims.\n\nToday, when movie stars lift their skirts and pretend to pee\n\nwhile sitting on toilets in mainstream films, it is hard to recapture the anger\n\nfelt by L.B. Mayer, the head of M-G-M, when a toilet was shown through an open bathroom door in\n\n“The Crowd.” Although “The Crowd” was\n\nan M-G-M movie, Mayer was so incensed by “that toilet picture” he made sure the\n\nfilm would not win Academy Awards in 1927-28, the Academy’s first year. “The\n\nCrowd” was nominated for “Unique and Artistic Picture,” but that predecessor of\n\nBest Picture went to “Sunrise,” a 20th Century Fox film.\n\nA special award was\n\ngiven “TO WARNER BROS. for producing “The Jazz Singer,” the pioneer outstanding\n\ntalking picture, which has revolutionized the industry.”\n\nBoth Kevin Brownlow, who introduced “The Crowd,” and Randy\n\nHaberkamp, the Academy’s managing director of preservation who had students\n\nfrom Hollywood and Fairfax high schools bused to “The Crowd,” are, in\n\nHaberkamp’s words, “trying to convert you.”\n\nBasically, Haberkamp told the audience, the Roadrunner cartoons, “The\n\nLife of Pi,” “Wall – E,” and Robert Redford’s new movie, “All Is Lost,” about a\n\nsolitary sailor dangerously adrift,are silent films.\n\nIt may not work. Many\n\nof the great silent films, including “The Crowd,” are not even on DVD, although\n\nVidor’s 1925 World War I movie, “The Big Parade,” was released on DVD and\n\nBluRay a week ago by Criterion. But\n\nanother chance to convert an audience comes tomorrow night when the Academy and\n\nthe Pickford Foundation present Ernst Lubitsch’s “The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg,” a\n\nVienese romance in which a prince falls in love with a barmaid."
