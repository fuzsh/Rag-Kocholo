Curie is also still the only person awarded a Nobel Prize in two different sciences: Physics (1903), which she shared with her husband Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel, and Chemistry (1911), for the discovery of polonium and radium. Edward Sierra will offer an engaging and informative presentation on the life and work of this early pioneer of radioactivity.\n\nJoin us on Zoom\n\nUse the button above or go to nyit.zoom.us/join and enter meeting ID: 936 3491 2693.\n\nThis event is part of the Dean’s Digital Café Series, NYIT College of Arts & Sciences, Spring 2021."
