Today, a CRT is described as a vacuum tube that contains one or more electron guns and a phosphorescent screen, and is used to display images. It modulates, accelerates, and deflects electron beams onto a screen tocreate the images. The images may represent electrical waveforms (in an oscilloscope), pictures (a television screen, computer monitor), radar targets, or other phenomena. We now know that cathode rays are streams of electrons observed in discharge tubes. If an evacuated glass tube (upper image) is equipped with two electrodes and a voltage is applied, glass behind the positive electrode is observed to glow (lower image), due to electrons emitted from the negative cathode. The above “official” account presupposes that one knows what an electron is and what are its physical properties (mass and charge). The discovery of the electron opened up a whole new chapter in the understanding of matter. This led to the realization that light and matter could not be fully understood using the classicallaws of physics, and that a totally different way of understanding nature was needed. Thus emerged, beginning in the last years of the 19th century, a completely new description of light and matter. This new description became known as quantum mechanics, and resulted in the quantum theory of atoms, molecules and the chemical bond. This is the historical journey on which we shall embark in this Lecture. Cathode rays were discovered by Julius Plücker (1801-1868) and Johann Wilhelm Hittorf(1824-1914). Their experimental apparatus depended on two earlier inventions: 1) Volta’s battery; and, 2) a sealed glass tube in which a partial vacuum was maintained. The latter was invented by a German physicist and glassblower, Heinrich Geissler, in 1857. Hittorf observed that some unknown rays were emitted from the cathode (negative electrode) which could cast shadows on the glowing wall of the tube, indicating the rays were traveling in straight lines. In 1890, Arthur Schuster demonstrated cathode rays could be deflected by electric fields, and William Crookes showed they could be deflected by magnetic fields. It was these experiments on cathode rays inside the cathode ray tube that drew the attention of Röntgen. After repeating the above experiments, he began to study the radiation emitted outside the cathode ray tube, using fluorescent chemical sensors, e.g., barium platinocyanide, to detect radiation. His discovery of x-rays on November 8, 1895 was communicated to the Physico-Medical Society of Würzburg later in November, 1895. A translation of his paper appeared two months later on January 23, 1896 in the English journal, Nature. (You can dial up this article on Gallica and read it for yourself).

This opening keynote celebrates the unique potential of special libraries to spearhead AI-driven transformations. Join Brian Pichman as we saddle up to ride into the history of Artificial Intelligence, how its evolved over the years, and how its transforming today's frontiers. We will explore a variety of tools and strategies that leverage AI including some new ideas that may enhance cataloging, unlock personalized user experiences, or pioneer new ways to access specialized research. As with any frontier exploration, we will confront shared ethical challenges and explore how joint efforts can not only navigate but also shape AI's impact on equitable access and information integrity in special libraries. For the remainder of the conference, we will equip you with a \"digital compass\" where you can submit ideas and thoughts of what you've learned in sessions for a final reveal in the closing keynote."
