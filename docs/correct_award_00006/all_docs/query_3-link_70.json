        "text": "Join us on Zoom for a fascinating presentation by Edward Sierra on the life and work of Marie Curie. Email ellencummings@eastgreenwichlibrary.org to register for this free program.\n\nA scientist and early pioneer of radioactivity, Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the first person and only woman to win the Nobel prize twice. Curie is also still the only person awarded a Nobel Prize in two different sciences: Physics (1903), which she shared with her husband Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel, and Chemistry (1911), for the discovery of polonium and radium. Edward Sierra will offer an engaging and informative presentation on the life and work of this early pioneer of radioactivity."
