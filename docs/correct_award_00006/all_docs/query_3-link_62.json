        "text": "In patients with congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema is a leading cause of hospitalization. Imaging is critical for assessing the severity of this condition and determining the optimal treatment and monitoring plan. In an article published in Radiology Advances, Viacheslav V. Danilov, PhD, Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, Spain, and colleagues sought to develop a deep learning method for identifying radiographic features associated with pulmonary edema. For this retrospective study, the researchers used a dataset of chest radiograph images from 741 patients suspected of pulmonary edema. An experienced radiologist annotated various features of edema including cephalization, Kerley lines, pleural effusion, bat wings and infiltrate features of edema. The methodology involved two stages: lung segmentation using an ensemble of three object detection networks, and edema feature localization which evaluated eight object detection networks, assessing their performance with average precision (AP) and mean AP. Effusion, infiltrate, and bat wing features were best detected by the Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL) network with corresponding APs of 0.599, 0.395, and 0.926, respectively. Furthermore, SABL achieved the highest overall mean AP of 0.568. The Cascade Region Proposal Network attained the highest AP of 0.417 for Kerley lines and the Probabilistic Anchor Assignment network achieved the highest AP of 0.533 for cephalization. “The proposed methodology, with the application of SABL, Cascade Region Proposal Network, and Probabilistic Anchor Assignment detection networks, is accurate and efficient in localizing and identifying pulmonary edema features and is, therefore, a promising diagnostic candidate for interpretable severity assessment of pulmonary edema,” the authors conclude.

The risk of abnormal implantation from prior cesarean scars poses severe complications, including maternal and fetal mortality and fertility loss. Subsequent cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies (CSEPs) are on the rise, particularly in recent decades. Underdiagnosis and underreporting make the true incidence unclear, leading to high maternal morbidity and mortality rates. In an article published in RadioGraphics, Anne Kennedy, MBBCh, BAO, and Paula Woodward, MD, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, and colleagues review the signs of CSEP at imaging, some pitfalls that may lead to delayed or missed diagnosis, and the resulting consequences. The authors emphasize the importance of differentiating CSEPs from low implantation of a normal pregnancy, cervical ectopic pregnancy and evolving pregnancy loss. Early recognition of CSEPs allows for prompt and safe treatment that is usually surgical and can reduce health care costs and hospital stays and preserve fertility. Early diagnosis and treatment of CSEP can also avert the need for a hysterectomy, lessening psychological impacts. “The most important thing that radiologists can do to avoid delayed or missed diagnosis of CSEP is to routinely check for a history of cesarean section. If there are findings of concern for CSEP, prompt referral for further evaluation and treatment is mandatory. Treatment early in the first trimester is safe and effective and allows preservation of fertility in women who desire future pregnancy. Management of CSEP is determined on an individual basis in all cases,” the authors conclude.
