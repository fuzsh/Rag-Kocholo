His work in the discovery of “spontaneous radioactivity” earned him a share of the 1903 Physics Nobel Prize along with Marie and Pierre Curie. Similar to Curie, Becquerel has a unit named after him for radioactivity – the SI unit “Becquerel” (Bq)\n\nThe following are links to documents and videos on the life and scientific contributions made by Henri Becquerel.\n\nBecquerel biography (Nobel Prize Organization magazine article)\n\nWikipedia biography of Becquerel\n\nVideo biography of Becquerel from Health Apta’s Youtube channel\n\n1.3 Becquerel Printable Word File"
