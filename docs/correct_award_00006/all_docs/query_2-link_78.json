Born on December 15, 1852, Becquerel's groundbreaking work in the field of radioactivity earned him this prestigious recognition. Becquerel is best known for his discovery of the phenomenon of radioactivity, which occurred quite by accident. While conducting experiments on uranic salts, he left a photographic plate covered with a crystal of uranium sulfate in a closed drawer, unintentionally exposing it to the rays emitted by the uranium. When he developed the plate, he was astonished to find that it had been exposed, even though it had been kept in the dark. This unexpected result led Becquerel to investigate further, ultimately establishing that certain elements emit radiation that can penetrate through matter and cause chemical reactions. The Curies, who were also working on radioactivity, built upon Becquerel's findings, and together they made significant strides in understanding the nature of radioactive materials. Becquerel's discovery of radioactivity paved the way for the development of nuclear physics and laid the foundation for the atomic age. This photograph is a testament to the power of curiosity and serendipity in scientific discovery. Antoine-Henri Becquerel's unwavering commitment to exploring the unknown and his willingness to follow the trail of an unexpected result led to a breakthrough that would change the course of scientific history.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
