        "text": "Key scientists involved in the discovery of radioactivity include:\n\n1. Henri Becquerel: As mentioned, he was the first to discover radioactivity in 1896 when studying uranium.\n\n2. Marie Curie: Along with her husband Pierre Curie, she continued research into radioactivity and coined the term “radioactivity”. They also discovered the elements polonium and radium that emitted radiation.\n\n3. Pierre Curie: Working alongside his wife Marie, he contributed to radioactivity research, identifying new radioactive elements.\n\nThe main types of radioactivity are alpha, beta and gamma emissions. Alpha radiation consists of helium nuclei (2 protons and 2 neutrons) and is relatively heavy. Beta radiation consists of electrons (negative beta) or positrons (positive beta) emitted by unstable nuclei. Gamma radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation, similar to X-rays but of nuclear origin. Each type of radiation has different properties and effects, and they play important roles in various applications in science and medicine.\n\nAntoine Henri Becquerel, a renowned French physicist, was born into a family with a rich scientific heritage on December 15, 1852, in Paris. His family included notable scholars and scientists, with his father, Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel, being a professor of Applied Physics and conducting research in areas like solar radiation and phosphorescence. His grandfather, Antoine César Becquerel, was a Fellow of the Royal Society and known for inventing an electrolytic method for extracting metals from ores.\n\nBecquerel’s academic journey began when he entered the Polytechnic in 1872, followed by his enrollment in the government department of Ponts-et-Chaussées in 1874. He attained the title of ingénieur in 1877 and was later promoted to ingénieur-en-chef in 1894. In 1888, he earned his docteur-ès-sciences degree. Throughout his career, Becquerel held various academic positions, including an Assistantship at the Museum of Natural History in 1878, where he succeeded his father in the Chair of Applied Physics at the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers. In 1892, he became a Professor of Applied Physics in the Department of Natural History at the Paris Museum, and in 1895, he became a Professor at the Polytechnic.\n\nBecquerel’s early research covered topics such as the plane polarization of light, phosphorescence, and the absorption of light by crystals, which was the subject of his doctoral thesis. He also conducted work in the field of terrestrial magnetism.\n\nIn 1896, Becquerel made a groundbreaking discovery that would define his scientific legacy. He was inspired to investigate the connection between X-rays and naturally occurring phosphorescence after a discussion with Henri Poincaré. Becquerel had access to a supply of uranium salts that exhibited phosphorescence when exposed to light. He placed these salts near a photographic plate covered with opaque paper and found that the plate became fogged. This phenomenon was not limited to a specific uranium salt but was a property of the uranium atom itself. He later demonstrated that the rays emitted by uranium, which were initially named after him, had the ability to ionize gases and could be deflected by electric or magnetic fields. For this discovery of spontaneous radioactivity, Becquerel was awarded half of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, with the other half going to Pierre and Marie Curie for their research on the Becquerel radiation.\n\nBecquerel published his research findings in numerous papers, primarily in the “Annales de Physique et de Chimie” and the “Comptes Rendus de l’Academie des Sciences.” He was a member of various prestigious scientific academies, including the Academie des Sciences de France, Accademia dei Lincei, and the Royal Academy of Berlin. In 1900, he was honored as an Officer of the Legion of Honour.\n\nAntoine Henri Becquerel was married to Mademoiselle Janin, the daughter of a civil engineer, and they had a son named Jean, who continued the family’s scientific tradition as a physicist, marking the fourth generation of scientists in the Becquerel family.\n\nTragically, Antoine Henri Becquerel passed away on August 25, 1908, in Le Croisic. His contributions to the understanding of radioactivity and his pioneering research continue to be celebrated in the field of physics.\n\n— -\n\nAbstract\n\nHenri Becquerel, a distinguished French physicist, made a groundbreaking contribution to our understanding of radiation through his accidental discovery of radioactivity in 1896.

It also delves into the subsequent developments in the field of physics influenced by his work.\n\nBiography and Academic Journey\n\nBorn on December 15, 1852, in Paris, France, Henri Becquerel hailed from a family steeped in scientific tradition. His father, Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel, was a notable Professor of Applied Physics, known for his research in solar radiation and phosphorescence. His grandfather, Antoine César Becquerel, had been a Fellow of the Royal Society and a distinguished inventor in the realm of extracting metals from ores.\n\nHenri Becquerel’s academic journey commenced with his enrollment at the Polytechnic in 1872, followed by his admission to the government department of Ponts-et-Chaussées in 1874. His engineering career began in 1877, culminating in his promotion to ingénieur-en-chef in 1894. He earned his docteur-ès-sciences degree in 1888, a testament to his scholarly pursuits.\n\nBecquerel held several esteemed academic positions, including an Assistantship at the Museum of Natural History and the Chair of Applied Physics at the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, succeeding his father. In 1892, he assumed the role of Professor of Applied Physics in the Department of Natural History at the Paris Museum. His career also led him to become a Professor at the Polytechnic in 1895.\n\nHenri Becquerel was a French physicist best known for his discovery of radioactivity, a process by which an atomic nucleus emits particles due to its instability. Here is an overview of his life and contributions:\n\nEarly life and career:\n\n- Henri Becquerel was born in Paris, France, on December 15, 1852.\n\n– He attended Lycée Louis-le-Grand preparatory school in Paris and later studied civil engineering at École Polytechnique and École des Ponts et Chaussées.\n\n- In 1877, he became a government engineer in the Department of Bridges and Highways, progressing to the position of chief engineer in 1894.\n\n- Alongside his career as an engineer, Becquerel also held academic positions, becoming assistant professor at the École Polytechnique in 1876 and taking up the school’s chair of physics in 1895.\n\n- He also worked as an assistant naturalist at the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle in 1878 and became professor of applied physics at the same museum in 1892.\n\nDiscovery of Radiation:\n\n- Henri Becquerel was interested in phosphorescence, the phenomenon in which light is emitted by a material after being exposed to electromagnetic radiation, persisting even after the radiation is removed.\n\n- After the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895, Becquerel began to investigate the possible relationship between this invisible radiation and phosphorescence.\n\n- On February 24, 1896, he presented a paper at a conference demonstrating that a uranium crystal emitted radiation after being exposed to sunlight. He discovered this by accident when performing experiments on a cloudy day and seeing that there was still visible radiation on the photographic plate after development.\n\n- This accidental discovery led to the identification of spontaneous radioactivity, a phenomenon in which certain materials emit radiation due to the instability of their atomic nuclei.\n\nContribution to Science:\n\n- Becquerel’s discovery paved the way for later studies of radioactivity, conducted by scientists like Marie and Pierre Curie, who identified radioactive substances like polonium and radium.\n\n- Becquerel won half the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 for his discovery of spontaneous radioactivity, sharing the prize with the Curies.\n\nFamily and Personal Life:\n\n-Henri Becquerel came from a family of notable scientists, including his father, Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel, who made contributions to the study of the photovoltaic effect.\n\n- He was married twice, to Lucie Zoé Marie Jamin in 1877 (who died after giving birth to their son, Jean Becquerel) and to Louise Désirée Lorieux in 1890.\n\nHonors & Awards:\n\n- Becquerel received several awards throughout his life, including the Rumford Medal in 1900 and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.\n\nDeath and Legacy:\n\n- Henri Becquerel died on August 25, 1908, due to a heart attack.\n\n- Your discovery of radioactivity had a significant impact on science and understanding of atomic structure.\n\n- The SI unit for radioactivity, called the becquerel (Bq), was named after him.\n\nHenri Becquerel’s discovery played a key role in the history of physics and nuclear science, paving the way for many subsequent developments in the field.\n\nBackground and Previous Work\n\nBecquerel’s earlier scientific work encompassed diverse areas such as the plane polarization of light, phosphorescence, and the absorption of light by crystals. His doctoral thesis revolved around the latter topic. Additionally, he made contributions to the field of terrestrial magnetism.\n\nHowever, his most profound contribution came unexpectedly in 1896 when he decided to investigate the connection between X-rays and naturally occurring phosphorescence. Inspired by a discussion with Henri Poincaré, Becquerel utilized a supply of uranium salts that displayed phosphorescence when exposed to light. Placing these salts near a photographic plate covered with opaque paper, he noticed that the plate became fogged. Remarkably, this phenomenon was not specific to a particular uranium salt but was an inherent property of the uranium atom itself.\n\nHenri Becquerel’s contribution to the initial understanding of radioactivity and his related experiments are the main points addressed in this study, such as:\n\n1. **Family Background:** Henri Becquerel was part of a family with a long tradition of scientists. His grandfather, Antoine Becquerel, and his father, Edmond Becquerel, were outstanding scientists in their research areas, including electrical, magnetic, ultraviolet radiation, phosphorescence, and fluorescence phenomena.\n\n2. **Scientific Training and Early Research:** Henri Becquerel began his scientific education in his father’s laboratory, where he conducted his early research, mainly in the field of optics and phosphorescence. He studied the invisible (infrared) phosphorescence of various substances, including uranium salts.\n\n3. **Experiments with Radiation:** Henri Becquerel was interested in X-rays and the possibility that luminescent bodies could also emit X-rays. He conducted experiments with double potassium uranyl sulfate, exposing it to sunlight and observing the effects on photographic plates. He noticed that the phosphorescent substance emitted radiation that penetrated light-opaque paper and sensitized silver salts, similar to X-rays.\n\n4. **Discovery of Radioactivity:** Henri Becquerel observed that even when phosphorescent material was in obscurity for several days, it was still able to sensitize photographic plates. He called this phenomenon “radioactivity”, although he still did not fully understand the nature of this new type of radiation.\n\n5. **Further Studies:** Becquerel continued to study the effects of radiation emitted by phosphorescent materials and explored other materials, including uranium compounds, which also emitted similar radiation. He observed that radiation increased when phosphorescent crystals were exposed to sunlight.\n\n6. **Experiments with Other Materials:** Becquerel investigated whether other phosphorescent materials, such as calcium sulfide, also produced similar effects, but not all showed these effects.\n\n7. **Hypotheses and Further Research:** Becquerel hypothesized that these radiations were of an invisible nature and similar to invisible phosphorescence. He was intrigued by the phenomenon and planned to continue his research to shed light on this new class of phenomena.\n\n8. **Controversial Discoveries:** Some of Becquerel’s discoveries, such as the emission of radiation by phosphorescent materials in the dark, were intriguing and difficult to explain based on the scientific knowledge of the time.\n\nOverall, this excerpt recounts Henri Becquerel’s first steps in radioactivity research, highlighting his initial discoveries and observations that contributed to the beginning of the study of this phenomenon. It is important to note that, at the time, a complete understanding of radioactivity was still in development, and many of the phenomena observed by Becquerel were not fully understood at that time.\n\nThe Accidental Discovery of Radioactivity\n\nThe story of the discovery of radioactivity is a fascinating narrative of scientific progress throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Here is a summary of key milestones on that journey:\n\n1. **Discovery of Cathode Rays (19th century)**: William Crookes, a British chemist and physicist, made important discoveries about cathode rays in 1875 when performing experiments with electrical discharges in rarefied gases in glass ampoules. These studies contributed to the development of understanding of atomic structure.\n\n2. **Discovery of X-Rays (1895)**: Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, German physicist, made crucial discoveries by modifying Crookes’ tubes to create what we know today as X-rays. He performed the first radiography experiment, showing that it was possible to see through the human body. For this discovery, Röntgen received the Nobel Prize in 1901.\n\n3. **Discovery of Radioactivity (1896)**: Henri Becquerel, French physicist, investigated the natural phosphorescence of substances, including uranium salts. He observed that these substances spontaneously emitted radiation, without the need for exposure to sunlight. This phenomenon was initially called “Becquerel rays” and later “radioactive emissions”.\n\n4. **Contribution of Marie Curie (1897)**: Marie Sklodowska Curie, a physicist of Polish origin, and her husband Pierre Curie studied radioactive emissions from uranium. They isolated uranium from pitchblende (U3O8) and discovered two new radioactive elements: polonium and radium. Marie Curie received two Nobel Prizes in 1911 for these discoveries.\n\n5. **Identification of Alpha, Beta and Gamma Radiation (1898–1900)**: Ernest Rutherford, New Zealand physicist, carried out experiments with radioactive material and a fluorescent screen, identifying three types of radiation: alpha (α), beta (β ) and gamma (γ). These radiations were subsequently studied in detail, with alpha and beta being identified as charged particles and gamma radiation being a form of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThese discoveries marked the beginning of a new era in physics and chemistry, leading to the development of theories about atomic structure and the understanding of radioactivity processes. Subsequent research into radioactivity led to a number of important applications in medicine, industry and energy.\n\nHenri Becquerel’s accidental discovery of radioactivity had a profound impact on the field of physics. He found that the rays emitted by uranium, initially known as “rays of Becquerel,” caused ionization of gases and could be deflected by electric or magnetic fields. This phenomenon was distinct from X-rays and became the foundation of our understanding of natural radioactivity.\n\nMathematical Calculations\n\nAlthough Becquerel’s discovery was empirical, it laid the groundwork for subsequent mathematical calculations and experiments in the field of radioactivity. The understanding of radiation decay, half-life, and the development of mathematical models for radioactive decay were advanced significantly due to his pioneering work.\n\nInfluence on Subsequent Scientific Developments\n\nHenri Becquerel’s discovery of radioactivity profoundly influenced the course of scientific progress. His work set the stage for further investigations into radioactivity, ultimately leading to the pioneering research of Marie and Pierre Curie. The Curie couple’s discovery of polonium and radium, both highly radioactive elements, was directly inspired by Becquerel’s findings. In 1903, Henri Becquerel was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics alongside the Curies for their collective contributions to the study of radioactivity.\n\nConclusion\n\nHenri Becquerel’s remarkable journey from a family of scientists to becoming a distinguished physicist culminated in the serendipitous discovery of radioactivity. His work, while accidental, paved the way for profound scientific explanations of radiological phenomena. Becquerel’s legacy continues to influence the field of physics, particularly in understanding the behavior of radioactive materials and the mathematical modeling of radiation decay.\n\nBibliographical References\n\n1. “Antoine Henri Becquerel — Biographical.” Nobel Prize.(https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1903/becquerel/biographical/)\n\n2. “Henri Becquerel.” Toda Matéria.(https://www.todamateria.com.br/descoberta-radioatividade/)\n\n3. “Quem é por quem foi descoberta a radioatividade.” Você Pergunta.(https://vocepergunta.com/library/artigo/read/29068-Quem-e-por-quem-foi-descoberta-a-radioatividade)\n\n4. “Henri Becquerel.” Greelane.(https://www.greelane.com/pt/humanidades/hist%C3%B3ria--cultura/henri-becquerel-radioactivity-4570960/)"
