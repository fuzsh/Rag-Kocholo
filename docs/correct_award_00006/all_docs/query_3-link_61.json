        "text": "By Linda Hedrick\n\nMarie Sklodowska Curie, the chemist and physicist famous for her pioneering work on radioactivity, was the first person awarded two Nobel Prizes (for chemistry and physics); the first female professor at the Sorbonne; and the first woman to be entombed in the Paris Panth√©on for herself. (Madam Sophie Berthelot was the first woman, but was buried with her husband, Marcelin.)\n\nBorn in Warsaw in 1867, at age 24 she moved to Paris where she earned her higher degrees and carried out her scientific work. Her parents were teachers - her father taught math and science as well as directing two gymnasia for boys, her mother ran a prestigious boarding school for girls - and her paternal grandfather taught literature. In this atmosphere Marie grew up with a solid background in math and science.\n\nEach generation, on both sides of the family, had lost fortunes and property, mostly through Polish national uprisings. Marie and her siblings had a hard time pursuing their education due to lack of funds. Marie reached an agreement with her older sister, Bronislawa, to work to put her through medical studies in Paris in exchange for Bronislawa supporting Marie's studies two years later. She worked as a governess for various families. When Bronislawa married, she invited Marie to live with her and her new husband."
