        "text": "Hint: The French chemist, physicist, Nobel laureate and the first person to find proof of radioactivity was Antoine Henri Becquerel.\n\nHe won the $1903$ Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in this field, along with Marie Skłodowska-Curie (Marie Curie) and Pierre Curie. Becquerel (Bq), the SI unit for radioactivity, is named after him.\n\nComplete answer:\n\nHe became the third in his family to hold the physics chair at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in $1892$ during Becquerel's early career. Becquerel later became chief engineer of the Department of Bridges and Highways in $1894$, before he began his early experiments. The earliest works by Becquerel based on the topic of his doctoral thesis: the polarisation of light in the plane, with the phosphorescence phenomenon and the absorption of light by crystals.\n\nA prominent case of serendipity, of how luck favours the trained mind, is the observation of spontaneous radioactivity by Becquerel. For a long time, Becquerel was interested in phosphorescence, the light emission of one colour following the exposure of a body to light of another hue. Following Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen's observation of X-rays on $5$ January, there was a surge of optimism in early $1896$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is “Option A”.\n\nNote:\n\nBecquerel became part of the Académie des Sciences in $1889$. Becquerel received the Rumford Award in $1900$ for his discovery of uranium radioactivity and he became an Officer of the Legion of Honour. He was awarded the Helmholtz Prize by the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in $1901$. In $1903$, Henri shared with Pierre Curie and Marie Curie the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of spontaneous radioactivity."
