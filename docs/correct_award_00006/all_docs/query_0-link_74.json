        "text": "The UW Polish Studies Endowment Committee is hosting an exhibit honoring the 100th anniversary of Polish scientist Maria Skłodowska-Curie’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry through December 16 in the north lobby of the UW’s Allen Library. The exhibit is cosponsored by the Embassy of the Republic of Poland and created by the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Museum in Warsaw.\n\nMaria Skłodowska-Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person to win the Nobel Prize twice. The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded jointly to Maria Skłodowska-Curie, her husband Pierre, and Antoine Henri Becquerel in 1903 for their research on radiation phenomena. Her second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, was awarded in 1911 for the discovery of polonium and radium.\n\nThe exhibit is free and open to the public."
