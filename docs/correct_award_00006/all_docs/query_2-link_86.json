        "text": "A scientist and early pioneer of radioactivity, Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the first person and only woman to win the Nobel twice. Curie is also still the only person awarded a Nobel Prize in two different sciences: Physics (1903), which she shared with her husband Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel, and Chemistry (1911), for the discovery of polonium and radium. Edward Sierra will offer an engaging and informative presentation on the life and work of this early pioneer of radioactivity.\n\nNote: A science background is not required to enjoy this talk.\n\nFree and open to all! Registration is required."
