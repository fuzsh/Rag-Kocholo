        "text": "The beginning of a theory\n\nFor more than a century, the Becquerel family worked in the same laboratory in the Jardin des Plantes, later called the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle, in Paris. In 1878, Henri Becquerel assumed the position of assistant in the Muséum, taking the place left free by his own father.\n\nAntoine Henri Becquerel was the third in a line of four generations of scientists. At 37, he was elected member of the Académie des Sciences (French Academy of Sciences), following the footsteps of his grandfather, Antoine-César, and father, Edmund, who both became presidents of this renowned scientific society.\n\nIn 1896, a few copies of Rontgen’s first X-ray images were sent to the Académie. After discussing with Henri Poincaré, Henri Becquerel decided to investigate a possible relation between the emission of this type of radiation and natural luminescence. His initial theory was that minerals made phosphorescent by visible light emit X-rays. Considering that the two previous generations of the Becquerel family had extensively studied the phenomenon of luminescence, it does not come as a surprise that Henri set his mind to research this phenomenon.\n\nThe experimental design\n\nThe day after his discussion with Poincaré, Becquerel designed an experiment that could confirm his hypothesis. From his father, he had inherited a vast collection of uranium salts, which phosphoresce upon exposure to light.\n\nTwo uranium crystals were put over a photographic plate and wrapped in black paper so that light could not reach them. Becquerel’s idea was to expose the plates to sunlight and, in theory, to observe a photographic outline of the crystals. He expected thus to confirm his theory that luminescence and X-rays go hand-in-hand.\n\nThe first experiments seemed to confirm his hypothesis. After exposing the photographic plates to solar irradiation, Henri observed the expected outline of the uranium crystals. However, when Becquerel sought validation of his results, things took an unexpected turn.\n\nThe accidental twist\n\nBecquerel was doing his experiments in February when one does not expect much sunlight in Paris for several days. Though this may seem like trivial information, it actually determined the new path of Becquerel’s experiment.\n\nIt turned out that month was particularly cloudy and grey in the year 1896. Therefore, Henri could not expose the experimental plates to bright sunlight for several days. The photographic plates were, for that reason, kept in a drawer, waiting for the sun to shine again.\n\nOn the 1st of March, Henri opened the drawer and examined the plates, expecting to see a blunt outline of the uranium crystals. But, to his surprise, he was able to clearly see the image of the uranium crystals. On top of that, he found that the images were as bright as the first pictures that had been exposed to bright sunlight.\n\nIt didn’t take Becquerel much time to realize that his initial hypothesis was wrong. Sunlight was unnecessary for the emission of radiation. Thus, another unknown source was responsible for this phenomenon. On March 2nd, 1896, Becquerel reported in the Académie that the uranium salts emitted radiation with no stimulation from sunlight.\n\nAfter a few months of further experiments, he reported his additional conclusions to the Académie. The most likely explanation was that uranium salts stored energy and non-phosphorescent salts also emit invisible radiation with the same intensity as the phosphorescent ones.\n\nFurther work on radioactivity"
