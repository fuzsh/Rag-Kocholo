        "text": "Antoine Henri Becquerel\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1903\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: École Polytechnique, Paris, France\n\nPrize motivation: “in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by his discovery of spontaneous radioactivity”\n\nPrize share: 1/2\n\nWork\n\nWhen Henri Becquerel investigated the newly discovered X-rays in 1896, it led to studies of how uranium salts are affected by light. By accident, he discovered that uranium salts spontaneously emit a penetrating radiation that can be registered on a photographic plate. Further studies made it clear that this radiation was something new and not X-ray radiation: he had discovered a new phenomenon, radioactivity."
