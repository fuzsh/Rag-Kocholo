        "text": "BOX 1-1 THE DISCIPLINE: NUCLEAR AND RADIOCHEMISTRY\n\nFor this report, the committee drew on two seminal textbooks for definitions of the discipline. The first, Nuclear Chemistry: Theory and Applications (Choppin and Rydberg 1980, page vii), defines nuclear chemistry as follows:\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition for the term “nuclear chemistry.” For purposes of our text we regard nuclear chemistry in its broadest context as an interdisciplinary subject with roots in physics, biology, and chemistry. The basic aspects include among others (i) nuclear reactions and energy levels, (ii) the types and energetics of radioactive decay, (iii) the formation and properties of radioactive elements, (iv) the effect of individual isotopes on chemical and physical properties, and (v) the effects of nuclear radiation on matter. Research in (i) and (ii) is often indistinguishable in purpose and practice from that in nuclear physics, although for nuclear chemists chemical techniques may play a significant role. (iii) and (iv) can be classified as radiochemistry and isotope chemistry, while (v) falls in the classification of radiation chemistry.\n\nApplied aspects of nuclear chemistry involve production of radioactive isotopes, radiation processing, radiation conservation of foods, etc., as well as all parts of the nuclear fuel cycle such as uranium recovery, isotope separation, reactions in the fuel elements, processing of spent fuel elements, waste handling, and effects of radiation on reactor materials. Radiation health aspects and techniques for remote control are other important fields.\n\nKnowledge in nuclear chemistry is an essential tool for research, development, and control in many areas of chemistry and technology (tracer methods, activation analysis, control gauges in industry, etc.), medicine (radiopharmaceuticals, nuclear medicine, radioimmuno assay, etc.), geology, and archeology (radioactive dating).\n\nThe second book, Nuclear and Radiochemistry (Friedlander et al. 1981, p. v), takes a similarly broad view of the discipline:\n\nIn adopting the present title of the book in 1955 we gave explicit recognition to a dichotomy in the field and in the audience addressed; a dichotomy that has probably become even more pronounced since then. The book is written as an introductory text for two broad groups: nuclear chemists, that is, scientists with chemical background and chemical orientation whose prime interest is the study of nuclear properties and nuclear reactions; and radiochemists, that is, chemists concerned with the\n\nchemical manipulation of radioactive sources and with the application of radioactivity and other nuclear phenomena to chemical problems (whether in basic chemistry or in biology, medicine, earth and space sciences, etc.). Despite the apparently growing division between these two audiences, individuals have always moved fairly freely from one field to the other, and we continue to feel that nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry interact strongly with each other and indeed are so interdependent that their discussion together is almost necessary in an introductory text.\n\nThe Workforce: Nuclear and Radiochemists\n\nAs a research area or academic discipline, nuclear and radiochemistry is considered a subarea of chemistry. Nuclear and radiochemists are chemists who hold one or more degrees in chemistry and have taken additional specialized courses and conducted laboratory work in nuclear and radiochemistry. They typically work in an organization’s chemistry department or division.\n\nThere is no listing for nuclear and radiochemists in the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system.1 Nuclear and radiochemists are part of the broader occupation of “chemists” (SOC code 19-2031), as are nuclear physicists part of the occupation of “physicists” (SOC code 19-2012). However, there is a classification for nuclear engineers (SOC code 17-2161), who, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, “conduct research on nuclear engineering projects or apply principles and theory of nuclear science to problems concerned with release, control, and use of nuclear energy and nuclear waste disposal” (BLS 2010). Other broad categories that may include nuclear and radiochemists (especially at the bachelor’s degree level) are nuclear technicians (SOC code 19-4051), nuclear medicine technologists (SOC code 29-2033), and nuclear power plant operators (SOC code 51-8011).\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the committee defines individuals employed as nuclear and radiochemists as those who work on projects that apply the principles and theory of nuclear and radiochemistry in basic research and in applications including nuclear energy, medicine, weapons, and waste disposal.\n\n____________"
