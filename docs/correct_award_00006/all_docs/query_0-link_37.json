Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHenri Becquerel was a French physicist who investigated uranium and other substances which led to his discovery of radioactivity. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, which he shared with physicists Pierre and Marie Curie.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on the Henri Becquerel or alternatively, you can download our 23-page Henri Becquerel worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE & FAMILY\n\nAntoine Henri Becquerel was born on December 15, 1852, in Paris, France.\n\nHe was born into an affluent family of physicists, including his father Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel. His grandfather, Antoine César Becquerel, was also a physicist.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nHenri first attended a prep school in Paris named the Lycée Louis-le-Grand school.\n\nHe entered the École Polytechnique and the École des Ponts et Chaussées to study engineering.\n\nMARRIAGE\n\nIn 1874, Henri married Lucie Zoé Marie Jamin and had a son (Jean) with her.\n\nHis son also became a physicist.\n\nIn 1890, he married Louise Désirée Lorieux.\n\nCAREER BEGINNINGS\n\nIn 1876, he worked as an assistant teacher at the École Polytechnique.\n\nHe also worked as assistant naturalist to his father at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle.\n\nIn 1892, Becquerel followed the footsteps of his father and became the physics chair at the museum upon his father’s death.\n\nIn 1894, Becquerel worked as the chief engineer in the Department of Bridges and Highways.\n\nFIRST SCIENTIFIC STUDIES\n\nAt the time, the most investigated areas of science were magnetism, electricity, and optics.\n\nBecquerel’s first studies were about the rotation of plane-polarized light by magnetic fields.\n\nHenri also began investigating infrared radiation, particularly the spectra of different phosphorescent crystals under infrared.\n\nIn line with the previous work of his father, he researched how emission of phosphorescence in some uranium compounds affected absorption of light.\n\nBecquerel became regarded as an expert on phosphorescent materials and uranium compounds.\n\nHe was also exceptionally skilled in the laboratory.\n\nHis skill set and proficiency in such fields led him to discover radioactivity.\n\nHe was a prominent physicist by 1896.\n\nSince 1889, he was a member of the Académie des Sciences.\n\nRADIATION\n\nWilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays in 1895. Becquerel used X-rays in making a fluorescent effect when struck by cathode beams.\n\nHe began to investigate the possible relationship of visible light and the “invisible” radiation he observed.\n\nHe theorized that luminescent materials would yield X-rays.\n\nIn his experimentation, he put phosphorescent crystals on a photographic plate wrapped in opaque paper so that the emulsion could only be reached by a penetrating radiation.\n\nHe placed his setup under sunlight so as to excite the crystals.\n\nThe photographic plate showed silhouettes of the mineral samples.\n\nBecquerel submitted this discovery to the Académie des Sciences on February 24, 1896.\n\nThe results of the experiment confirmed his theory that something was emitted by the luminescent material.\n\nHowever, he observed that the uranium substances emitted radiation even though they were not made to emit light anymore.\n\nThis observation led to his next assumption that there was a form of invisible phosphorescence that is long lasting.\n\nHe interpreted it as something of a metallic phosphorescence.\n\nIt was in 1896 when Becquerel published seven papers on radioactivity, then two more papers in 1897.\n\nLater on, it was Marie Curie who named the phenomenon “radioactivity.”\n\nFurther studies, such as Pierre and Marie Curie’s discovery of polonium and radium, made Becquerel’s discovery even more significant.\n\nMORE SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nBecquerel’s scientific discoveries and research did not stop with radioactivity.\n\nIn his research from 1899 to 1900, Becquerel was able to study the properties and measure the deflection of beta particles.\n\nBeta particles are radiation components in electrical and magnetic fields.\n\nBecquerel revealed that the beta particle was the same as the electron which was discovered by Joseph John Thomson.\n\nBecquerel also discovered that uranium is able to regain the radioactivity that it lost while the substance in it loses its radiating ability.\n\nThis discovery (coupled with Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy’s similar discovery in thorium) was the foundation of the transformation theory of radioactivity.\n\nThe transformation theory of radioactivity explains the subatomic chemical change in which one element spontaneously transforms into another.\n\nBecquerel’s final accomplishment was about the physiological effect of the radiation.\n\nIn 1901, he reported the burn caused in his pocket by the active sample of radium discovered by the Curies.\n\nThis effect urged physicians to study the occurrence which contributed to medicine.\n\nHONORS\n\nThe SI unit for radioactivity is named after him, the becquerel (Bq).\n\nBecquerel was awarded the Rumford Medal in 1900 for his discovery of the radioactivity.\n\nThe Academy of Sciences elected him president and permanent secretary.\n\nBecquerel was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903 which he shared with physicists Pierre and Marie Curie.\n\nA crater on the moon and a crater on Mars are named after him.\n\nHenri Becquerel Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about Henri Becquerel across 23 in-depth pages.
