In July 1898, in cooperation with her husband Pierre Curie, by fractional crystallization of pitchblende (uranium ore waste) she obtained a fraction containing an increased amount of the first radioactive element, which they named polonium. In December the same year she obtained a chloride of another element, even stronger radioactive, named radium, which was a main admixture in barium chloride isolated from pitchblende. In 1903 the Curie couple, together with Antoine Henri Becquerel, obtained a Nobel Prize in physics. In 1902 they succeeded in isolating pure radium chloride. For this achievement, Maria Skłodowska-Curie obtained in 1911 another Nobel Prize, in chemistry. Maria Skłodowska-Curie developed the knowledge of radioactivity; she supported foundation of the Radium Institutes in Paris (1914) and in Warsaw (1932) which she headed.
