Portrait Information by the NPG: Sir Clive Sinclair is a mathematical genius whose creations – the pocket calculator, the low-cost digital watch, the miniature television set and the cheap home computer – have revolutionized popular attitudes to technology. The son of a mechanical engineer, he first worked as a technical journalist and in 1962 founded his own company selling build-your-own-radio kits by mail order. He subsequently set up Sinclair Research Ltd and only his electric car, the Sinclair C5, has proved a failure. Sinclair was photographed by Simon Lewis for the series The Essential Britain on which the photographer collaborated with the writer Tadgh O’Seaghdha. Sinclair holds his favourite circular slide rule.
