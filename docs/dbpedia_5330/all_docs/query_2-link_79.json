Sinclair brought some rather odd racing cars with him, including an allegedly ex Eric Winterbottom 1100cc Alta singleseater ( these days rebuilt to its original sports car form, and alive and well in Victoria) and a Sunbeam special of obscure origin.

Was he the Alan Gascoigne Sinclair born in Croydon on 22nd May 1905 and who died in Cornwall in June 1995?\n\nI must be missing something here, because my understanding was that the Cormack car went to NZ(admittedly AFTER the date Bristow drove the car) while the Sinclair car arrived in Australia in 1937 and is still here, including engine #25, or have I misunderstood?\n\nThe Cormack car which went to NZ was #52, the first of the 1.5L offset racing cars. it stayed there for some 25 years\n\nCloser to 35\n\nThanks, fivestar, for a pic I hadnt seen before.... and very much like the body Graeme and Betty put on the car this century\n\nQuite accidentally I found a pic of a TT Replica Frazer Nash reportedly photographed new outside the Frazer Nash factory when \"about to be collected by its purchaser A G Sinclair\", in ( we assume) 1935 or 1936\n\nFunny the way the brain works. I've known about Sinclair and his Australian activities (in racing) for many, many years, but it's only now clicked that he was the same bloke who owned a Frazer Nash sold to NZ in 1938. It was actually delivered to him in 1934"
