Is yours listed below?\"\n\nThey say never work with animals (or children) but I find their unpredictability usually produces the best results. As such I'm dedicted to providing you with only the best images printed on the latest papers from a professional reliable photo lab.\n\nWorking with animals will always generate questions - especially where cameras are involved so I've endeavoured to answer some of the ones I've been asked at recent events.\n\nIf you have a question not answered below, please email me and I'll add it to the list (providing I can answer it)\n\nOrdering\n\nI usually place orders twice a week (Monday and Thursday) and use a professional photo lab. Orders usually taken about 14 days to turn around for images up to and including 9\" x 6\". Images larger than this size are printed externally and can take up to 21 days.\n\nWhere electronic files are ordered I'll usually turn these around faster depending on current workloads. All images are posted 1st class in card backed envelopes sealed in plastic wallets to protect from rain damage.\n\nIf you need an order turned around faster (eg for a birthday) get in touch.\n\nOrdering multiple images and photobooks.\n\nI offer discounts on multiple images ordered, whether it's the same image or different ones as well as an A4 photobook of up to 24 images from any album.\n\nSee the \"gift Ideas\" and \"prices\" sections of the site to see how to order multiple image items.\n\nWhere can I view and buy images\n\nAll images are available to view and buy in a variety of formats and sizes from the \"Gallery & Shop\" page.\n\nWhen will my images be available for viewing?\n\nI aim to make images available for viewing within 72 hours of an event - however this can largely depend on the volume of images taken, the event and other jobs at the time. I'll always update the NEWS page with information on a event or photoshoot so check there first or get in touch.\n\nI saw an image on your computer at an event but it's not on your website. Why?\n\nIf I'm at an event with my laptop I'll always try and download my images so people can see what's been taken immediately. These images are unprocessed straight from the camera and unfortunately some of them will be out of focus (an unfortunate occurance when shooting indoors photography in low light at some events).\n\nThe quality of images is something I check after each event so if you've seen a photo but it's not on the website then that maybe the reason. I also take hundreds of images at an event and upload a selection of the best so it's possible that particular image wasn't (in my opinion) as good as another. However - If you really liked the image get in touch - you can still buy it but I must stress it may not be one I'd normally sell.\n\nYou took some photos for me but I don't want anyone else to see my images.\n\nNot a problem - your album can be password protected. Only you and those you share your password with can access your album to view and buy images. This is great for personal family events such as birthdays or where children are involved.\n\nYou took my photo at a local event and it's on your site but I don't want it on display.\n\nNot a problem - I respect eveyones privacy. Simply email me the picture number and the event and I will remove it.\n\nHow long do you keep images for?\n\nIndefinately. All images are stored on secure media. Images on this site will usually remain in the \"Gallery & Shop\" page for a couple of years or I run out of space - in which case they will be archived. If you want an image from a gallery that's no longer available please let me know.\n\nDo you use flash photography with animals?\n\nAs rule no. I never use flash when a competition is taking place. Flash guns and the intense light they generate can startle some \"flight\" animals (eg horses). Dogs aren't usually bothered by it - but it all depends on the individual animal. The 3 horses I own for example don't mind flash but I'd never use flash with a jumping horse for safety. The flash guns I use both have \"diffusers\" which soften any light but it is still bright and quick. I use lenses that allow me to take images in low light conditions and as many of my sessions are taken outside, there isnt really any need for flash. I'll always check with you (and your pet) if I feel flash is necessary.\n\nMy pet is an indoors pet (eg a cat) - can you do indoors?\n\nYes. With indoor shots you're on their \"turf\" so you need to get creative and you have to be patient. It's all down to your pet. This allows you to capture your pet in its \"natural\" relaxed state rather than a posed one. For example - in the images of \"Megan and Marley\", Marley (the fluffy cat) was photographed whilst she \"lounged\" on the sitting room floor in a sun beam, whilst Megan (the collie) was photographed relaxing on the backseat of her owners car after a long walk!\n\nWho owns the copyright of the images you take?\n\nI do. The copyright will remain with me at all times. Any images you buy are for your sole use. If you purchase an electronic copy of an image you can use this for personal use and on other sites (eg facebook) but you must not sell it on. If you want to do so you must contact me first. For business clients, images taken are for internal use/promotion only unless otherewise states.\n\nDo you sell your images to the media?\n\nPrivate commissions remain private unles I feel a particular image could be entered into the public domain in which case I'll contact you first. For events and larger shows as copyright holder I may sell images on to magazines (such as Scottish & Northern Equestrian) if it is a suitable image and they accept it (usually based on the event). As a courtesy and where possible I will try and inform the show organisers and you. Where a company ask for an image it's uauslly necessary to obtain a \"model release form\" - I will contact you (where possible) should this be necessary.\n\nWhat equipment do you use?\n\nI'm use Canon cameras and lenses. I've recently invested in a new Canon 7D (with HD video capture) and 2 new \"L series\" pro lenses. These allow me to shoot in nearly all situations. I also own a Canon 40D back up camera. I;m currently saving for the Canon 1D mkiv sports camera.\n\nWhat if it's raining on our private session day?\n\nUnfortunately, we live in a climate where grey skies and the threat of rain are the norm but if I'm honest, an overcats day is actually a really good day for photography. Overcats days can help produce a well balanced image. A rainy day is also a great day because the rain helps \"clean\" the surrounding scenery making the colours vibrant. Also dogs love puddles! Some pets love to shake off the rain making for superb photographic opportunities. There are some occasions though (such as heavy fog, deep snow) that mean we'll need to move the date.\n\nDo you cover my area? That all depends on where you are and what you want a photograph of. My events photography takes me down to Southern England in the Summer months but as a rule my pet and equestrian photography take me within the central belt of Scotland. Usually a 60 mile (one hour-ish) trip from the FK5 postcode are my boundries. Beyond that I'll need to charge mileage at 50p a mile (based on current fuel prices).\n\nWhat methods of payment do you accept? I currently accept cash (when on location), cheque (payable to Adrian Sinclair or Sinclair Photography), Paypal (the preferred method) or debti/credit card (via paypal secure transactions page). There are occasions where a deposit is required for some events. Unfortunately I can't as yet take payment over the phone.\n\nDo you print images whilst on location? At the moment no but I am looking in to this as an option in the future. At present I'm afriad I simply don't have the time. Occasionally if my glamarous assistant (my wife) is helping, there maybe a laptop and a monitor on display letting you view the current images taken for the event I'm attending. If you see an image you want, you can pay for it there and then and I'll take your order. I'm also looking in to touch screen technology allowing you to view images and place an order which will be sent after the event.\n\nI want an image you've taken but you don't do it on the (size/paper/medium) I want?\n\nNot a problem. Just get in touch and I'll try and meet your requirements.\n\nI'm looking for a photographer to take photos of (thing) and wondered if you could do it?\n\nIt all depends on what \"thing\" is. My experience is in pet, equestrian and certain types of event photography. That doesn't mean to say I won't try and photograph \"thing\" for you - but it largely depends on what's involved, if any specialist equipment is needed and whether I'm confortable photographing \"thing\". Expectation is a big thing when it comes to photography. feel free to give me a call...\n\nI bought a photo but it seems \"grainy\" - why is this?\n\nThe grainy affect you see on some printed images is called \"noise\" and usually appears on digital images if the photograph was taken in doors in \"low light\" conditions. In the days of film, photographers used \"fast film\" for sports events because of the sensitivity of the film. The flipside was there was a grainy pattern on the image. Like the human eye when it gets dark the black dot in your eye (your pupil) opens up to let more light in. Professional camera lenses also do this but theyre obviously not as sensitive as the human eye so the camera's sensor becomes more sensitive instead (called ISO). This increased sensitivity generates the \"noise\" that you see on the print. Noise is an unavoidable hazard when photographing moving fast objects in low light (like horses). I use noise reduction software where noise is pretty high and it does a very good job."
