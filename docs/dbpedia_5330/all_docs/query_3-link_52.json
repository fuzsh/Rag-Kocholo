        "text": "Heavy traffic snarled the morning commute in Snohomish County Thursday after a vehicle hit and killed a pedestrian on Interstate 5.\n\nThe backup spanned 11 miles at the Boeing freeway at State Route 526 in Everett, for much of the morning. Washington State Patrol traffic was getting by in the far-left HOV lane, as the three right lanes were all blocked.\n\nAt 9:01 a.m., Harding said the roadway was fully reopened. Harding first posted about the fatal collision at 5:29 a.m.\n\nThere were lengthy backups on SR 9, SR 204 and US 2 as well.\n\nAccording to WSP, the pedestrian \"left the\" overpass and \"came to rest between lanes\" 1 and 2 of southbound I-5. The pedestrian, a 52-year-old man from Mukilteo, was \"struck by multiple vehicles,\" WSP said.\n\nTroopers said drivers could take the off-ramp to Everett Mall Way to get back onto I-5. Many drivers used Highway 2 as a detour as well.\n\n\"Please be patient as there will be backups while troopers investigate this tragic collision,\" Harding wrote on X early Thursday morning."
