A mask-wearing suspect opened fire, his mother said. The trio fled in the Infiniti.\n\nWactor portrayed Brando Corbin on the ABC soap opera from 2020 to 2022. He also appeared in a variety of films and TV series, including “Station 19,” “NCIS,” “Westworld” and the video game “Call of Duty: Vanguard.”"
