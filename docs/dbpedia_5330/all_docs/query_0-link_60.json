        "text": "PLAINFIELD — Aldrenia Gibbs-Davis doesn’t want just to sell cars to customers, she wants to make them feel like family.\n\n“My business is not to rip you off,” Gibbs-Davis said. “My business is to help you throughout it, so you’re a part of our family.”\n\nGibbs-Davis, along with many of her family members, own Sinclair Auto Palace, LLC, which opened on Aug. 15. A used car dealership located at 11 Main St. in Moosup, Gibbs-Davis said her business stands out due to its emphasis on family.\n\n“Family is in the heart, it’s not what you see,” Gibbs-Davis, the finance manager, said.\n\nThe idea of a family business isn’t just a philosophy, but it’s also literal statement, with many of the employees being Gibbs-Davis’ children, nieces and nephews, covering all departments. For example, Jamie Banks is in charge of insurance, and likes the idea of Sinclair becoming a one-stop shop, from repair work to paperwork.\n\n“You go out the door, ready to go,” Banks said.\n\nBanks also likes the idea of working with her family members, as they know each other already, so the business can focus its energy on the customer.\n\n“You have their back, they have your back,” Banks said.\n\nThe building that Sinclair Auto Palace occupies has been a car dealership many times over the years. Patrick Scott, the owner of Main Street Collision next door, looks forward to working more with Sinclair Auto Palace in the future.\n\n“All of us grow as a group,” Scott said.\n\nGibbs-Davis also likes to say the place looks nicer than it has over the years, sporting “a woman’s look.” This ranges from the fashionable furniture in the lobby, to family photos and the artwork made by in-house artist Brittany Gibbs. Perhaps the most noticeable decoration is a decoration on the doorway, referencing the Bible verse Ephesians 2:10, which refers to believers as “masterpieces.”\n\n“With a masterpiece, you’re never completed with it,” Gibbs-Davis said. “He’s not finished with me yet.”\n\nGibbs-Davis said, as a born-again Christian, that faith got her and her family through tough times.\n\n“The Lord has brought me from a place in my life where me and my husband were struggling to make ends meet,” Gibbs-Davis said. “Keeping the faith, trusting in the Lord, that’s why I’m here.”\n\nHowever, Gibbs-Davis isn’t new to the auto industry, having worked in various roles for 25 years. Gibbs-Davis said cars are one of her passions in life.\n\n“I love cars, it’s something that I’ve always loved,” Gibbs-Davis said.\n\nGibbs-Davis and the rest of the family moved from New York City to upstate New York, and eventually to Connecticut five years ago, with the intent of opening a business. She said the reception has been great, and looks forward to being involved in the community\n\n“I want to give it my all,” Gibbs-Davis said.\n\nAt a glance"
