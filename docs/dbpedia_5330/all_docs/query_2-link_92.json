        "text": "Nigel Sinclair and Guy East are revving up the first project under their newly formed White Horse Pictures.\n\nThe former Exclusive Media co-chairmen, who exited the company in March, have begun production on the documentary A Faster Horse. The film explores the history and legacy of America’s most iconic car, the Ford Mustang, which is celebrating its 50-year anniversary this year.\n\nA Faster Horse marks Sinclair and East’s first post-Exclusive project, which will be directed by David Gelb (Jiro Dreams of Sushi). White Horse has secured the cooperation of The Ford Motor Company.\n\nGlen Zipper (Undefeated) and Sinclair are producing. East and White Horse’s Nicholas Ferrall are executive producing.\n\nIn the tradition of vérité films such as Undefeated and Jiro Dreams of Sushi, A Faster Horse will take audiences on a journey directly through the eyes of Mustang lovers worldwide, including everyday people who hold their own unique connection to the car. The documentary will feature exclusive, never-before-seen archival footage of the Mustang as well as interviews with historians and Ford insiders.\n\nMustang has sold more than 9 million cars in its 50-year history.\n\n“In recent times, Steve Jobs has taught us that practical, everyday objects — a music player, a personal computer — can be objects of great beauty,” Sinclair said. “The Mustang was perhaps the earliest exemplar of this philosophy. There has never been a car that has resonated so deeply in American culture as the Mustang, and David Gelb will bring his unique cinematic approach to the project.”\n\nAdded Gelb: “Ford has generously allowed our team full access to a wealth of archive materials and unparalleled permission to document the design and creation of the 2015 Mustang.”\n\nGelb most recently directed the horror thriller Lazarus, produced by Blumhouse Productions and starring Olivia Wilde and Mark Duplass.\n\nIn addition to Ferrall, the White Horse documentary team includes executives Jeanne Elfant Festa and Cassidy Hartmann."
