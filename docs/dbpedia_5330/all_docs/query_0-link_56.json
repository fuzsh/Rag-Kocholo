        "text": "When Jeremiah Grossman and his family first came to Boise, they got stuck during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Well, we got 'stuck here' but we completely fell in love,\" Grossman said. \"The people here are of an outstanding quality, and the car culture here is just fantastic.\"\n\nGrossman is originally from Maui, Hawaii where he built a career as a white hat hacker and software engineer, starting multiple cybersecurity companies throughout his career.\n\nDespite his profession, his passion has been classic cars since he was young, restoring classic cars in the garage with his father.\n\n\"I grew up building, racing, fixing cars. Toybox is an extension of that,\" Grossman said. \"When we were looking at the concept for this place, the outpouring of local support was incredible.\"\n\nGrossman says membership has steadily grown, gradually filling the space with all varieties of classic and luxury cars.\n\n\"A lot of our members are professionals, running their jobs and careers, but at the end of the day, people want to drive their super cool car,\" Grossman said. \"It's also created a brain trust of knowledge about classic cars and brought people together to talk shop.\"\n\nConstruction on the space concluded earlier this year, and Grossman says it can hold more than 60 cars in climate-controlled conditions, with everything someone might need to help keep their car \"spick-and-span.\"\n\n\"We're building membership, we're hosting new events all the time,\" Grossman said. \"Now we just want to have a great time with the community.\"\n\nToybox is a member-only car club, but Grossman said he's working to find ways to continue engaging with the community as much as possible."
