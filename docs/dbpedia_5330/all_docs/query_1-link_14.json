        "meta_description": "The Sinclair Collection of World War II memorabilia documents the activities of the T-Patchers—the Texas National Guard during World War II. The collection follows Buddy and Katy Sinclair through their wartime activities with photographs, letters, and documents. Buddy and his T-Patch comrades went through training and on to Anzio, Italy. Katy stayed behind and became a \"Rosie the Riveter,\" working in the defense industry. Before and after the war, Katy and Buddy enjoyed life, and that included good times with friends. Katy's collection of menus, wine lists and swizzle sticks highlights the pleasure they took in all aspects of their life. Photographs show not only the maturing of two people, but the evolution of fashion in clothing, automobiles, residential and restaurant décor. This collection is about people who were not famous, but were intimately involved in events that changed the world. Through it, those who didn't live that life can experience what it was like, and those who were there with them can remember.\r\n\r\nLocated in the Sulphur Springs Public Library, the Sinclair WW II Collection includes memorabilia such as letters, pictures, and other items generously donated by Katie Sinclair along with her collection of Kinkaid paintings.",
