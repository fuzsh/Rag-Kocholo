        "text": "TORONTO, July 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Call2Recycle, Canada's leading battery collection and recycling organization, is proud to announce Canadian soccer legend Christine Sinclair as its new official ambassador for its consumer battery recycling program, Recycle Your Batteries, Canada!. Sinclair, who recently retired from international professional soccer after an impressive 23-year career with the Canadian women's national team, is widely recognized for leading her team to an Olympic gold medal. She is also FIFA's all-time leader in international goals scored.\n\nSinclair's new role as a program ambassador complements Call2Recycle's mission to protect the environment and foster responsible battery recycling practices across the country. Her determination and commitment to inspiring future generations will help advance Call2Recycle's battery recycling initiatives. Together, they share one goal: to protect Canada's environment. As brand ambassador, Christine Sinclair will lend her voice to several educational initiatives to engage consumers, youth, and communities, and inspire Canadians to increase their battery recycling practices.\n\n\"We are incredibly honoured to welcome Christine Sinclair to the Call2Recycle Canada team,\" said Jon McQuaid, VP of Marketing, Communications & Innovation of Call2Recycle Canada. \"Her passion for inspiring young people is invaluable as we continue to encourage Canadians to help make a positive impact on our environment through responsible battery recycling.\"\n\nSinclair's long-standing dedication to her country and her professional on-field success have established her as a Canadian icon, inspiring citizens from coast to coast, along her journey. Through this partnership, Call2Recycle and Christine Sinclair will raise awareness about the importance and ease of recycling batteries, and motivate the next generation to embrace environmental responsibility.\n\n\"For 23 years, I proudly represented Canada on the world stage, demonstrating that Canadians can achieve great things when we set our minds to it,\" said Christine Sinclair. \"Now, I have a new goal ? protecting Canada's environment. Just like on the field, achieving our goals requires teamwork! That's why I'm thrilled to work with Call2Recycle to encourage Canadians to Collect, Protect, and Drop Off their used batteries, through the Recycle Your Batteries, Canada! program.\"\n\nAs part of Call2Recycle's ongoing effort to educate the public about battery recycling, particularly among youth, the organization actively engages local communities through grassroots initiatives.
