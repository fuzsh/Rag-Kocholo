        "text": "The Clark County School District (CCSD) Board of Trustees has voted against repairing a Mt. Charleston elementary school building, opting instead to explore possibly adding classrooms to the mountain's library.\n\nLundy Elementary School has been closed since Tropical Storm Hilary last August.\n\nIn May, CCSD recommended , citing the costs of repairing the storm damage.\n\nRELATED |\n\nOn Wednesday, trustees voted 4-3 to explore an agreement with the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District to build an addition to the Mount Charleston Library for the school. The two buildings are just a few feet apart.\n\nThat's after a vote to repair the existing school at $6.8 million didn't pass.\n\nA timeline shows the addition to the library would include two classrooms, cost $1.4 million and be completed as early as spring of 2026.\n\nThe Las Vegas-Clark County Library District emailed News 3 a statement from Executive Director Kelvin Watson:\n\n\"The Library District is a dedicated member of the Mt. Charleston community. We are in conversations with the Clark County School District to support their recovery from the recent flood damage.\"\n\nThe vote comes over the recommendation to permanently rezone children in Mt. Charleston for Indian Springs Elementary, which in some cases is about one and a half hours one way.\n\nFamilies spoke out against the change, accusing CCSD of a lack of transparency. They've questioned the figures provided by the district for the cost of repairs.\n\n\"I don't think they want to build school up here,\" Katie Reeh, a parent who would have her youngest son attend Lundy if it was open. \"I don't think they really intend on it. I think they'll have their meetings with the library district but I really, I think they're just they're deceitful.\n\nReeh is a mother of three boys. Her middle child, 11-year-old Sam, was a student at Lundy when the flood damaged the school last year and it closed. He and his 5-year-old brother David plan to attend an elementary school in the Las Vegas valley for the upcoming academic year which starts on August 12.\n\n\"You're supposed to care about these kids and my son's grades went down and like, am I supposed to put him temporarily in this elementary school,\" Reeh said.\n\nThe recommendation to close the school is \"no longer on the table,\" as stated by interim superintendent Dr. Brenda Larsen-Mitchell during the meeting but it's uncertain if the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District will enter a partnership. If it doesn't happen, it remains known what the district plans to do next.\n\nThe LVCCLD has a scheduled board meeting on September 12."
