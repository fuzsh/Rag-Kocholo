        "text": "A Wheeling man is headed before a grand jury in an unprecedented overdose death case in Ohio County.\n\nIt's a case in which prosecutors want to make sure a message gets across.\n\nRyan Musick with a felony crime of failure to render aid in an overdose death from 2022.\n\nHe has waived his preliminary hearing and now a grand jury will hear the case.\n\nThis case is the first of its kind in Ohio County, as officials are cracking down on holding people accountable for drug overdoses.\n\n\"The goals for this office, for me, and for law enforcement are two things,” Ohio County Assistant Prosecutor Shawn Turak said. “One is accountability, and No. 2 is to raise awareness. This is a case where someone died. Someone died in an overdose situation and a bystander did nothing.\"\n\nThe incident took place on Chapline Street on sept. 14, 2022. A women was suffering from an overdose and later died at WVU Medicine Wheeling Hospital.\n\nDuring the investigation, it was determined that Musick was there when the overdose took place.\n\n\"I'm very happy that it's happening,” said Mary Clark, the victim’s mother. “Someone is being held responsible. I don't know that she would still be here, but it might have made a difference.\n\n\"I hope people think, 'oh if I don’t do this, there could be criminal charges against me.’ \"\n\nTurak says these types of cases are typically very hard to prove, so this is a big step in the right direction.\n\n“They are relatively rare because when you think about an overdose situation, or an addiction situation, a lot of times people flee, people scatter, and then maybe, maybe there is a call for 911 but then people don’t hang around in the aftermath,\" Turak said.\n\nThere are two types of felonies that address overdoses such as this one.\n\nThe most serious is the person who delivers the drug that causes an OD death is 3-15 years.\n\nThe second is a person who fails to render aid in an overdose situation can face 1-5 years, which is what Musick is up against.\n\nOfficials want to avoid overdose deaths, hoping for people to call 911 right away, or have Narcan at the ready.\n\n\"We know there are addicts out there, we also know Narcan is available everywhere,” Turak said. “It's free, it's at the health department, I know people who carry it in their car, people that have it in their homes. There is no reason why this should happen.\"\n\n\"Just remember, this could be you sitting in there because you chose to make a bad decision,\" Clark said."
