        "text": "In what some view as the sound of freedom and others say is a source of frustrating noise, Air Force fighter jets have staged at the Santa Maria Public Airport as part of a larger military exercise.\n\nThe activity, which has generated debate on social media because of the noise, is connected to Bamboo Eagle, an Air Force Warfare Center exercise designed to create a “combat representative environment,” according to representatives at Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n\nApproximately 3,000 service members from four branches will operate more than 150 aircraft from nearly a dozen locations to create the various facets of the eight-day Bamboo Eagle, according to the military.\n\n“Bamboo Eagle provides a combat representative environment,” said Maj. Gen. Christopher Niemi, commander of the USAFWC. “By honing our capabilities in dynamic and challenging environments, we strengthen our ability to deter aggression and safeguard our nation’s interests.”\n\nWhile air crews routinely conduct training and hold local exercises at their home bases, operations such as Bamboo Eagle deliver a different chance to hone skills.\n\n“What Bamboo Eagle provides is a scope, scale and integration that we’re just not able to replicate here at Hill,” said Col. Michael Gette, 388th Fighter Wing commander.\n\nFor Santa Maria, Bamboo Eagle has brought F-35 Lightning fighter jets from the Utah base to the airfield. There’s also a handful of F-5 fighters form a government contractor serving as the adversaries. A C-130 cargo plane delivered supplies, and a V-22 Osprey flew over Santa Maria on Monday.\n\nThe large-scale exercise includes training flights during the day and night with aircraft remaining in the air for up to five hours. Night launches will allow air crews to simulate training during nighttime combat operations.\n\nMilitary and law enforcement aircraft have long used the Santa Maria airport for training, whether it’s just a day trip to conduct touch-and-go operations, a landing to have lunch, or longer visits.\n\nWhether it’s aircraft for the military or firefighting, the aviation activity typically attracts spectators, many equipped with cameras, to the airport.\n\nThe activity also can benefit the airport and local businesses since they end up buying fuel from the Central Coast Jet Center, eating at local restaurants, renting vehicles and more.\n\n“They like using us because we have really good accommodations for an airport. We have a hotel that’s right on the airfield. We have a couple of restaurants,” said Nash Moreno, airport board president.\n\nThe activity may be more noticeable since the airport currently lacks daily large aircraft used for commercial passenger flights.\n\nHowever, local airport officials have pointed out that they don’t control who lands or takes off at the facility.\n\n“It’s important to know that aircraft noise complaints generally do not change how the airport operates, and the airport has limited ability to prevent aircraft noise. The airport does not control or regulate airspace, aircraft operations, aircraft noise levels, airline schedules or airline fleet mix,” the SMX website states.\n\nAdditionally, the Federal Aviation Administration and the airport do not have the authority to regulate or control military aircraft operations.\n\nStill, the airport logs noise complaints for data collection purposes and coordination when reviewing future proposed military aircraft operations.\n\nSanta Maria’s airport has a deep history with military aircraft. During World War II, the airport originated as a military base, first training B-25 Mitchell bomber crews and later becoming a training field for P-38 Lightning pilots.\n\nNot everyone loves the activity.\n\nIn January, Orcutt resident Susan Bryant urged the airport not to solicit or encourage military aircraft to train here, ticking off a list of military aircraft crashes elsewhere.\n\n“There’s a legitimate fear in my neighborhood that a military plane will crash one of these days,” she said.\n\nShe also asked the airport to conduct a noise study.\n\n“Would you please find a way to educate the pilots to show respect for our neighborhood …by maybe flying a little bit higher, a little bit quieter, a little bit slower,” she said.\n\nLikely not helping settle nerves, Tuesday night’s flights could be heard shortly after an earthquake centered in Kern County rattled the Central Coast.\n\n“Well, at least now, the aviation complainers will be overtaken by the ‘was that an earthquake?’ posts!” one resident said on social media."
