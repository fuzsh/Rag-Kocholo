        "text": "A California man faces charges after the Nebraska State Patrol found more than 90 pounds of marijuana in his vehicle during a traffic stop.\n\nRaul Cortez Barrera, 31, of San Jose, California, is charged in York County Court with possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, possession of more than a pound of marijuana and no drug tax stamp.\n\nAccording to an arrest affidavit, around 1:15 p.m. Aug. 2, an NSP trooper observed a black car driven by Cortez Barrera speeding on Interstate 80 near mile marker 362 – two miles east of the Waco exit. He said due to heavy traffic, he waited until the Beaver Crossing exit to conduct a traffic stop.\n\nThe affidavit said when the trooper contacted Cortez Barrera, he admitted to having marijuana in his vehicle and a probable cause search was conducted.\n\nThe trooper said approximately 92 pounds of marijuana was located inside heat-sealed bags inside two suitcases and a duffel bag in the trunk and back seat of the vehicle.\n\nCortez Barrera’s bond has been set at $200,000, 10% of which would need to be posted for him to be released from jail. His next court date is set for 9:30 a.m. Friday."
