For I would ride with you upon the wind and dance upon the mountains like a flame.” -W.B. Yeats\n\nMy work reflects the place I go to when I escape from the stress of this life. I can drift off to the universe of magic, mythology, and fairytales. Though grounded in this realm, I escape life’s chaos and havoc by traveling to a much calmer and more peaceful place that exists withing my photographs. Where we exist in a world of fast pace, busy schedules, and chaos, I try to capture a moment in beauty and grace that fairies often give off within the fairy tales they come from.\n\nMy daughter and daughter’s friends were my inspiration for this theme and gives the viewer different visions of fairies. I was able to accomplish these images from the combination of studio lighting, costumes, make up and 3-d props to evolve my idea. Formal studio lighting patterns such as Loop, Butterfly, and Rembrandt, create subtle, yet clearly visible effects within each image. Between the work I was able to accomplish in Studio Photography, and my vision I bring the world of fairies a little bit closer.\n\nJillian Gehring\n\nArt 1161 – Black & White Darkroom Photography I\n\nPortfolio Concept: Life During COVID\n\nKim Hall\n\nArt 1161 – Black & White Darkroom Photography I\n\nPortfolio Concept: Buildings & Cemeteries\n\nJoan Galbraith\n\nArt 1161 – Black & White Darkroom Photography I\n\nPortfolio Concept: Body + Horror\n\nArt 1161 – Black & White Darkroom Photography I\n\nPortfolio Concept: A Documentation of Passover - My FAMILY's Passover and the Importance of Being Together Throughout Hard Times\n\nElizabeth Carner\n\nArt 2294 – Photography Portfolio Development\n\nPortfolio Concept: Beautiful Dead or Alive\n\nAmber Shepherd\n\nArt 1170 – Non-Silver Photography\n\nMegan Courtaway\n\nArt 1170 – Non-Silver Photography\n\nArtist Statement:\n\n“The Moon has awoken with the sleep of the sun. The light has been broken; the spell has begun.” ~Midgard Morningstar~\n\nMy photos here show how the seasons of nature affect the subject within the work. At the time these were taken fall was upon us and so was Halloween. I decided instead of fairies and the renewal of spring, I chose what comes with fall, the coloring of the leaves and falling of them. Also, the spooky season seemed to ground me to nature at the time. I choose to go with witches and had different locations through out Northern Ohio.\n\nI was able to capture these images of my black and white film for photography and transfer and enlarge the negatives to ortho litho film. Once these were dry, I brought them home and used the alternative printing processes I have learned from Non-Silver Photography. I used the process of van dyke brown, single gum processing, and multi color gum processing. There are three images within the work that have each type of these processes done. The Van dyke brown gives it a vintage feel to it but the other gives these images color.\n\nAnnette Campbell\n\nArt 1162 – Black and White Darkroom Photography II\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nWe are all photographers in this day and age with our ever-ready camera phones. For me there is something about shooting images on film. It’s the anticipation of whether you took a great picture, an ok picture or nothing at all. For my Black & White Darkroom Photography II class portfolio, I took one element and started a chain that would link each picture with one element from the prior picture. In developing these pictures, I used an array of filters and techniques to bring out the best in each print. For me I find developing the film to be just as much an art form as taking the picture.\n\nPast Artists:\n\nMadisyn Bunch\n\nArt 1162 – Black and White Darkroom Photography II\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nI really started getting interested in photography when I was in high school, so once I graduated, I noticed Sinclair had a Black and White film photography class that I knew I wanted to take. Over the last semester I really got into toning photographs, so for my final I wanted to do something that I love to do, which is take pictures of nature and animals and only tone the animals. That way there is a little contrast that keeps your eyes looking at the image. The first step I did was rubber cement the animal only, and I did put a couple coats of rubber cement on the animal that way I can make sure that no toner would get on the animal at all. My second step was getting the photograph wet and then placing the photograph in Sepia A, which is like a bleach. I then would let it process until it got light enough. My final step was putting the photograph in Sepia B, which then brings the photograph back to life and gives you the brown-look in the image while the animals are still gray, directing your focus to the animals while still allowing you to look at the contrast of the nature in the background.\n\nBrittney Lowe\n\nArt 2294 – Photography Portfolio Development\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nTHE LIGHT ANGEL\n\nHi my name is Brittney and these photos are a part of my final for my Photography Portfolio class. I had a lot of fun doing them. In my photographs, I wanted to display the message that everyone can be an earth Angel in someone’s life and be a blessing to them. You can be an Angel in disguise without them ever knowing it. In our world today, we gotta be a light to those around us.\n\nSamuel Smith\n\nArt 1162 – Black and White Darkroom Photography II\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nPortraits of my friend, Destiny Davis, using a technique called combination printing.\n\n­This body of work is about perceiving the self.\n\nMegan Courtaway\n\nArt 1162 – Black and White Darkroom Photography II\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nHello, my name is Megan Courtaway and you are looking at my Black and White Photography 2 portfolio. My inspiration for this was, of course, the fall, spooky Halloween season. So, I grabbed a bunch of girls I work with and used my daughter and some of the others I use to babysit as models for my witch-themed photoshoot. After this was done and I started working on a theme for my portfolio and came up with using Kool-Aid to tone my images. I got the idea from another photographer in my class after she used black cherry soda to tone one of hers. So, I looked into some different coloring ideas and Kool-Aid came to mine along with coffee and Dr. Pepper. In the photos you will see where I used the colors and didn’t use them. For instance, where there is no color I used rubber cement, and that made the color not absorb into the paper. On one photo I used red and purple Kool-Aid and painted them on my kids in the picture. Then once they dried, I put rubber cement on them and toned the rest of the image with coffee. So here is my witch-themed portfolio toned with Kool-Aid.\n\nKe Xu\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nFINDING CONNECTION WITH THE FOREST\n\nThe theme of my project is inspired by one of my favorite movies, Stalker. The forest as shown in the movie really captures an isolating and mysterious ambiance of a post-apocalyptic environment in a way I feel is beautiful. For me, the movie portrays a great relationship between humans and nature. I went to multiple local forests to shoot my pictures. I hope my pictures can transfer you some of the same emotions I found within Stalker.\n\nAnnabelle White\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nFROG AND TOAD ARE FRIENDS ONCE MORE\n\nThe very idea of nostalgia is rooted in vagueness. A vague feeling, memory, or long forgotten history. The idea for Frog and Toad initially came from stuffed animals in a used bookstore and has now multiplied into a vague feeling of happiness as you view these photos. Frog and Toad have meant a great deal to me ever since I was a child, and I hope I can share that emotion through these photos.\n\nSamuel Smith\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nWHAT A LIFE IS OURS!\n\n“What a life is ours! Doesn’t anybody in the world anymore want to get up in the middle of the night and sing?” -Upstream, Mary Oliver-\n\nThis collection of work reflects the influence Poet Mary Oliver had on me growing up in the suburbs of Ohio. My sister, Sunnie, and I take photos on a hot summer day north of Dayton, 2022.\n\nMarissa Nunez\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nHANDS­\n\nAs life always does, I have been through challenges in life that have brought me f­ull circle back into photography. Out of high school, I had a scholarship for photography, but I joined the United States Army Reserve instead. After getting out of the Army and starting a family, I realized my passion for photography was still deeply rooted within me. Having children woke that sleeping giant within. “Hands” was inspired by my children; their innocence and growth inspired me to capture images of their hands, as they are their most used tool in their young lives. The sense of feeling life in their hands is so important, and I feel that documenting that was deeply significant to me. I plan on continuing to document my children’s growth through my photography.\n\nMihir Patel\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nBEAUTY OF SIMPLICITY\n\nThe beauty of simplicity is not only how attractive something is when you look at it but the deeper meaning such simple things can have, like my photographs here. They may look simple and you may be attracted to some of them based off of how they look, but if you take the time to look at the photographs, you will find a deeper meaning of the images and each image has a deeper and different meaning to each person that views them. When I was looking at these photographs, I found a deeper meaning for me and that is how I named them. So the deeper meaning behind each photo no matter how simple they may look is the true beauty of simplicity.\n\nBret Klassen\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nOur society has changed and continues to change in large, amazing ways. We have electric, self-driving cars, ability for everyone to produce their own movies and overnight goods delivery. I chose to look through still-life juxtaposition of old and new, at the small, mundane changes that we take for granted yet make such a difference in daily living. Just looking at how we store things that are important to us such as medicine, music, and food, highlights how much our lives have changed without the fanfare of something like a new drone package delivery service. Change and wonder does not have to grandiose to be valued. If we take the time to look at the simple things around us, we develop a new appreciation for how we have improved our lives and truly live in a time of wonder.\n\nAvery Miller\n\nKelyn McCoy\n\nAliyah Bing"
