        "text": "Alexia’s latest series is titled Rococo and features images inspired by, well, Rococo. “Following the design aesthetic of this period, the series is sensual, playful and flamboyant,” says Alexia.\n\nThe series features both still life images and the kind of intrinsically detailed portraits Alexia is known for, all lit with Profoto Pro packs. In addition, Alexia filmed a short video on the same theme.\n\nYou’ll find a few images below. The video is above.\n\nHead over to Alexia’s website to see the rest and to be honest slightly NSFW images.\n\nAlso, there is an interview with her at 500px that you might want to check out."
