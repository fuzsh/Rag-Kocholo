The Chantoozies – Tottie Goldsmith, Ally Fowler, Eve von Bibra and Angie La Bozzetta – will entertain crowds for the Reef Hotel Casino's FiestOz from January 24-26.

For a band who originally came together for a one-off show, The Chantoozies certainly made a massive impact on the Aussie music scene in the 1980s and '90s.

They kicked off their career with a residency at the renowned Melbourne Underground nightclub and it wasn’t long before a record deal with Mushroom Records followed.

With hits like Kiss n Tell, Wanna Be Up, Love the One You’re With and He’s Gonna Step on You Again, the band’s music became a soundtrack to the era in Australia.

Their original material achieved platinum and gold sales and they toured with some of the biggest names in the business, including Billy Joel and Chrissy Amphlet.

After taking time out to pursue their individual careers, the girls reunited in 2006 to pay tribute to the record company that gave them their start.

After The 25 Years Of Mushroom Music arena show at the MCG, they hit the road with Molly Meldrum for the national Countdown Spectacular tour, supported Rick Astley on his Australian tour and played to packed houses throughout the country ever since.
