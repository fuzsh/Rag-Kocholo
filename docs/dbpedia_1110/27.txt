The Chantoozies (Ally Fowler and Eve von Bibra) continue to wow audiences with their dynamic blend of pop and rock.

The last few years have seen 'one of Australia's hottest bands' release new singles, 'Baby It's You', and more recently 'Take Me In Your Arms'.

They have appeared on countless TV & radio shows and performed around the country. Often, as part of the Gold FM concert series or a more recent highlight, The Big Red Bash, with Midnight Oil and Kasey Chambers.

Collectively and individually The Chantoozies have contributed to Australia's rich music, film, television and theatre culture. They have a unique and entertaining energy that they bring to every show, singing a combination of their original songs, Wanna Be Up, Witch Queen of New Orleans, Kiss & Tell, Love the one you're with, and some covers from various eras.

The girls reunited in 2006 for the national 'Countdown Spectacular' tour and have never looked back!
