        "text": "Live music and shows are a rare commodity in regional towns. Daylesford/Hepburn is fortunate that The Palais-Hepburn, Hepburn Springs has survived the 2020 COVID lockdown and has reactivated a great program of music, comedy and live shows on a weekly basis.\n\nBuilt originally in 1926, the heritage-listed Palais boasts Victoria’s oldest sprung dancefloor. Over its almost 95-year history, The Palais has been everything from a movie theatre to a performance venue, even an ice-creamery.\n\nAfter closing in 2009 The Palais has undergone two restorations, firstly in 2010 and more recently in 2018, when current operators Richard Fanale and Brendan Wykes put their own stamp on the venue.\n\nRichard, an experienced interior designer, led the refurbishment process that integrates the main performance hall with the Salon Bar and Cocktail Bar. Richard’s other skills in event management and creation has ensured an extensive lists of acts will be at the venue including, in April, the Chantoozies, Andy Vening Hypnosis Comedy Show and Bluestone Assembly.\n\nLive shows can be seen as part of Show dinner-package with comfortable table seating for the show or via a limited number of show-only tickets, with access to the bar and lounge area at the back of the hall.\n\nFriday nights offer free local entertainment in an intimate dining setting for Supper Club. Thursday nights are slated for a soon-to-commence locals’ night.\n\nBrendan’s expertise in hospitality and working closely with new Chef, Lizzy Payne is reflected in the modern Australian cuisine menu which has been very well received. The bar offers an extensive range of classic cocktails to complement the wine list. They have stripped many cocktails back to their origins and Brendan says that guests have found these refreshingly different.\n\nThe Palais-Hepburn can also host weddings from 50 up to 400 people.\n\nComing up at the Palais:\n\nFor a complete list of upcoming events see the Palais website at https://www.palais-hepburn.com\n\nFeature Shows\n\nSaturday April 17: The Chantoozies( Ally Fowler and EvE von Bibra) wow audiences with their dynamic blend of pop and rock.\n\nFriday, April 23: Andy Vening. Hypnosis Comedy Show. Get Ready to be mesmerised, hypnotised and maybe even zombified!\n\nSaturday April 24: Bluetone Assembly. The Bluetone Assembly perform the hits of blues, jazz and soul legends from the 1950s, 60s and beyond.\n\nSupper Club (Free Admission)\n\nThursday April 22: Sally Harvie, a well know local singer will celebrate her 50 years of life with a performance at the Palais.\n\nFriday April 30: Gaymes Night. An orgy of campy, all inclusive, interactive, immersive, socially distanced, politically incorrect Gaymes."
