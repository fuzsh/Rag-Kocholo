Often, as part of the Gold FM concert series or a more recent highlight, The Big Red Bash, with Midnight Oil and Kasey Chambers.\n\nCollectively and individually The Chantoozies have contributed to Australiaâs rich music, film, television and theatre culture. They have a unique and entertaining energy that they bring to every show, singing a combination of their original songs, Wanna Be Up, Witch Queen of New Orleans, Kiss & Tell, Love the one youâre with, and some covers from various eras.\n\nThe girls reunited in 2006 for the national âCountdown Spectacularâ tour and have never looked back!"
