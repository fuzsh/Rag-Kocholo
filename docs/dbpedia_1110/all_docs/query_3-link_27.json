        "text": "Thank you Mark for posting this! Nice to see that James, Simon, Paul and John were all together in the same room in 1996, even if they didn't perform any song.\n\nOne thing I was underwhelmed with in James's thank you-speech, in which he rattled off names of people who had been important to the band at some point during their career, was that Bill McDonough was just mentioned as one of many names in the middle of all this name dropping. He did after all play on the first three albums (the three most commercially successful albums) and wrote/co-wrote two of the band's Top 20 hits (\"Downhearted\" and \"Shut Down\"), so I feel he wasn't acknowledged in a fair way. Since James's speech ends with \"... and of course Guy McDonough\" it couldn't have been too difficult for him to instead finish it with \"... and of course Guy and Bill McDonough\". Minor detail perhaps, but it comes across to me as being unnecessarily ungracious (or even petty) in a \"thank you\"-speech.\n\nBrand New Emperor's Clothes.\n\nLabel: Roadshow Music – 101130-2, Warner Music Distribution – 101130-2\n\nFormat:\n\nCD, Single\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nReleased: 1997\n\n1 Brand New Emperor's Clothes\n\n2 Anyday Above Ground (Live)\n\n3 Goin' Fishing (Live)\n\n4 Day In The Sun (Live)\n\nAcoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals – Brett Kingman (tracks: 2 to 4)\n\nBass – Mark Gray (3) (tracks: 1)\n\nKeyboards – Ashley Cadell (tracks: 1)\n\nPercussion – John Watson (tracks: 2 to 4)\n\nPiano, Backing Vocals – Mark O'Connor (2) (tracks: 2 to 4)\n\nVocals, Guitar – James Reyne\n\nProducer – Ashley Cadell (tracks: 1), James Reyne (tracks: 1)\n\nMixed By – James Kilpatrick (tracks: 2 to 4), Michael Letho (tracks: 1)\n\nLoverboy went all around the world\n\nMaking eyes at every other girl\n\nNow we see he publicly caress\n\nLost in narcissistic tenderness\n\nEverybody knows your name\n\nEverybody knows your game\n\nChorus ~\n\nWho is this fallen to the ground\n\nAnd he's always hanging `round\n\nDress me up in a fool's disguise\n\nWipe the wool across my eyes\n\nSilly bloody coffee table man\n\nGolden tongue is tied and in the can\n\nAnd this black eyed feeling\n\nOver you is stealing\n\nIn your cell you're squealing\n\nAt the hand their dealing\n\nChorus +\n\nWho is this leader of the pack\n\nSomeone please just send him back\n\nPretty maids all stand in rows\n\nTo touch the brand new emperor's clothes\n\nChorus +\n\nWho is this leader of the pack\n\nSomeone please just send him back\n\nPretty maids all stand in rows\n\nTo touch the brand new emperor's clothes\n\nPretty maids all stand in rows\n\nTo touch the brand new emperor's clothes\n\nWho is this fallen to the ground\n\nHe's always hanging `round\n\nPretty maids all stand in rows\n\nTo touch the brand new emperor's clothes\n\nWriter James Reyne?\n\nPublisher ?\n\nThis is the first time I have ever heard this. In fact I don't even remember this coming out...\n\nTo some degree, and probably largely due to my life at the time, James seemed to disappear off the face of the earth in the nineties, I guess it was seen that his time in the sun was over, and the industry pretty much ignored him, as far as I can tell and remember... but on a first listen, this is an excellent track, that I really don't see any reason why it shouldn't have been played somewhere.\n\nJames had moved from the Rooart label to Village Roadshow Music, a branch of Warner Brothers, and the next album we'll look at, from an early listen, the very good Design For Living came out on the same label in 1999, but the following album came out on Liberation.\n\nSo it seems like James was wrestling with the industry and the ability to release music. To some degree I guess that it doesn't help that he took a couple of years off in the early 2000's, but that is something else again, and still ahead of us.\n\nIt's hard to gather what the story was with this track, as it doesn't seem to have done anything, and perhaps was unfashionable at the time.\n\nIt ended up charting at 170 on the ARIA chart... and that is what is so odd, to me, about this release... even as huge as Australian Crawl had been in Australian terms, they had rarely been big in the singles market, it was the albums that were high in the charts and that is what they built their reputation on, that and the live shows....\n\nSo just past the mid-nineties we get this single out of the blue, not connected to anything and seemingly vanishing into history.\n\nLyrically this may be a bit sharp and pointy for the radio, I don't know... It appears to be about someone who was found guilty of some sort of sexual misconduct.\n\nThis person appears to have been popular, or well known, and seems to have preyed on women? girls?, and he ends up in jail, and things don't go well for him there.\n\nObviously the Emperor's New Clothes is a very famous story, and here the context seems to be that this person was revealed, much like the Emperor in the story, just in a different way....\n\nIt's actually a slightly uncomfortable lyric in many ways, particularly the second verse.\n\nMusically it is very smooth, and I like it quite a bit, particularly for a first listen.\n\nWe have nice melodic flow, some well measured key modulations, and James gives it a great vocal.\n\nMore Wharf: Greatest Hits\n\nCompilation album by\n\nAustralian Crawl\n\nReleased 16 October 1998\n\nGenre Rock\n\nLabel EMI Music Australia\n\n\"Beautiful People\" (James Reyne, Mark Hudson) – 2:56\n\n\"The Boys Light Up (Reyne) – 4:41\n\n\"Downhearted\" (Sean Higgins, Guy McDonough, William 'Bill' McDonough) – 2:56\n\n\"Hoochie Gucci Fiorucci Mama\" (Reyne, David Briggs)\n\n\"Indisposed\" (Brad Robinson, James Robinson, Reyne, W McDonough) – 4:04\n\n\"Things Don't Seem\" (G McDonough, Higgins) – 3:57\n\n\"Errol\" (Reyne, G McDonough) – 3:30\n\n\"Oh No Not You Again\" (G McDonough) – 5:08\n\n\"Lakeside\" (Reyne) – 4:49\n\n\"Shut Down\" (W McDonough) – 4:11\n\n\"Daughters of the Northern Coast\" (Reyne, G McDonough) – 4:42\n\n\"Reckless (Don't Be So)\" (Reyne) – 5:23\n\n\"White Limbo\" (Simon Binks) – 4:04\n\n\"Two Can Play\" (Simon Hussey, Reyne) – 3:48\n\n\"Trouble Spot Rock\" (Reyne) – 4:46\n\n\"Always the Way\" (Hussey, Reyne) – 5:37\n\n\"Unpublished Critics\" (Reyne, Paul Williams) – 5:20\n\nSongwriting credits from Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA).\n\nThe album is dedicated to the band's rhythm guitarist, Brad Robinson who died of lymphoma in 1996.\n\nThe album features a slightly different mix of Reckless (Don't Be So), with the bass being more audible and more guitar added in the last section of the song. This version is only available on this compilation.\n\nI've never had any of the Australian Crawl compilations, I had and was happy with the albums, so it seemed somewhat redundant to get the compilations. I have a mild interest in the Reckless variation but not enough to buy a compilation that I would likely never listen to.\n\nHaving said that though, just looking at the tracklist, if someone wanted a compilation of Aus Crawl, this essentially captures the tracks that would generally be seen as the essential ones.\n\nHere is this variant for anyone that missed it.\n\nHi guys, I hope you don’t mind me gatecrashing this thread, especially since you’ve already done the Crawl and are onto James’ solo career. Basically it’s Guy’s birthday in a week and since I was playing My Place and Lost and Found lately,\n\nI was googling Lost and Found and this forum and thread come up. I’ve read some posts, particularly the Lost and Found ones and Stefan’s posts got me a bit teary since Bill put a lot of love and effort into bringing Guy’s words and music to life, and I’m glad that Stefan considers it a treasured part of his collection.\n\nI wanted to send Stefan a direct message but apparently I have to make a few posts before I can do that, so I hope Kangamom and Mark won’t mind if I do that here.\n\nI grew up listening to the Crawl as I suspect most people did here in Melbourne as it’s their hometown. I remember when Beautiful People came out. Kids back then used to play in their front yards or on the street, playing bat tennis, cricket and kick to kick, 3XY would be blaring on the radio outside, we didn’t have all the distractions that kids have had for the past couple of decades. So it started there at the beginning for me and my friends, but when Guy joined and Sirocco came out it really took them to the next level.\n\nGrowing up as the Crawl’s new songs and albums came out I can remember lots of details that may be of interest to you or particularly Stefan and it may shed light on some things that you maybe want to know but couldn’t fathom since you didn’t have access to our local news. For example David Briggs has been pretty vocal about a lot of things and has given a few people from back in 1979-80 a spray ( he sounds a bit bitter frankly about that time) but in particular he shared that Bill didn’t play on Indisposed on TBLU album because ‘ he couldn’t cut it’. So if you think back to the Countdown clip where Guy was perched at the kit when he wasn’t even formally part of the band yet, maybe it had something to do with it, along the lines of ‘ well I didn’t play it on the record so I’m not gonna pretend to now’. I don’t think Bill is a petty guy but band politics/ arguments can have an effect on any given day. I think Bill is a wonderful drummer and each of them had their part to play, but Guy was my favourite and even he said that he was sometimes frustrated being on the road with a group of friends that you don’t always get along with. By the way none of the Countdown clips are live, they just mime along with the recording, the equipment was never plugged in, just in case you didn’t know."
