With singles ‘Hold Me’ and ‘Man Of The Universe’ already fan favourites, Run Home Slow more than delivers on the promise of the band’s breakout debut record, Half Mile Harvest which recently peaked at #5 on the US iTunes album chart.

Recently awarded “living legend” status by Rolling Stone, Joe’s career spans an astonishing 50+ years. As a singer, songwriter, saxophonist and producer Joe Camilleri is considered one of the most genuinely talented figures in Australian music still at the top of his game.

Joe was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2007. Over the years other greats have admired Camilleri’s signwriting. Elvis Costello and John Denver are just two who have recorded cover versions of Joe’s music. Never one to sit still Camilleri is preparing to promote the 3rd single from his 49th album, The Black Sorrows’ Citizen John, on a 15 show tour of Europe (the band’s 2nd European jaunt for 2019) and a 50+ show tour in Australia.\n\nCARL BARRON Carl’s non-threatening observational style of comedy appeals to everyone.

His latest solo release “Sparrow & Swan” sees a gravitational pull towards the narrative - conversation turns into song, late night tales become tunes. There are stories here from Brisbane cab drivers, girls from Belfast ‘74 in search of Van Morrison, football players and their protégés, relationships sparked in TABs, sightings of Robert Mitchum at Mitcham Station, a sailor in search of Helsinki ...and the weather, there’s always the weather; the sun burning a hole in the sky or snow falling upon ancient ice ...and birds, what’s with the birds?\n\nSTEPH TISDELL is a major rising star in the Australian Comedy Scene.
