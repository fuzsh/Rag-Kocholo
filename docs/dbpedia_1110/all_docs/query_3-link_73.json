There are more GREAT Concert announcements to come!\n\nTrip The Switch Show Cancelled\n\nDue to factors beyond our control, it is with deep regret that we have to announce that the Trip The Switch event which was to take place in Ipswich on July 3rd has been cancelled today based on advice from Queensland Health.\n\nWith the unfolding Covid-19 situation in Sydney and Queensland where both governments have imposed new restrictions and/or lockdowns due to the increased risk of transmission with the Delta Variant and Alpha Variant, tough restrictions have been implemented that prevent people from the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area, where key band and crew members from several of the bands appearing at the event live, from entering Queensland.\n\nThe organisers, artists and technicians had applied for Travel Exemptions for these key personnel to be able to perform at Trip The Switch and had provided a detailed substantial Covid-19 management plan for them. However, given the unfolding and expanding pandemic fears in Sydney and Brisbane, the department saw the risk of transmission as potentially too great.\n\nBecause of this, the organisers have made the difficult decision to cancel the event.\n\nTicketholders will be contacted by Ticketmaster during Monday June 28th regarding refunds - please do not contact them before that as they will not be in a position to process refunds until Monday - and we urge anyone who had booked accommodation or made travel arrangements to cancel them today or as soon as possible.\n\nWe are sorry to disappoint our ICEHOUSE fans and friends - the band looks forward to performing again whenever that may be possible and to seeing you there.\n\nBendigo Show Cancelled\n\nIt is with great regret that ICEHOUSE announces that, due to Victoria’s current Covid-19 restrictions on gatherings, the performance at Bendigo’s Ulumbarra Theatre, scheduled for next Thursday June 24th will have to be cancelled.\n\nYesterday's announcements from the Victorian Government severely limit the number of patrons who can attend a venue and these mean that it isn’t possible for the previously Sold Out event to take place.\n\nAs ICEHOUSE has no touring plans at present where another date could be set, the band and promoter, Regional Touring, reluctantly agreed today to cancel the performance and refund ticketholders.\n\nEveryone involved is saddened by having to do so and apologise for any inconvenience caused to the band’s fans and supporters as well as the local businesses, technical crew and other staff who are affected.\n\nUlumbarra Theatre box office will be in touch tomorrow (Friday June 18th) from 10am to process refunds to all ticket holders. There is no need to contact the venue directly.\n\nICEHOUSE looks forward to a time when the band can get back to perform in Bendigo.\n\nTHANK YOU BENDIGO!\n\nThe show at the Ulumbarra Theatre on June 24th is SOLD OUT!\n\nICEHOUSE would like to thank the good folks at Ulumbarra Theatre and Regional Touring. The band would especially like to thank all of the fans who will be attending the show. It will be great to see you all there!\n\nNew Show Announcement!\n\nWe are pleased to announce a new ICEHOUSE show!
