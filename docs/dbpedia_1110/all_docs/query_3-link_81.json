        "text": "What a weekend! Sunshine, music, cars, bikes and a huge crowd doing it for the charities. The Brighter Days Festival continues to get better and 2018 did not disappoint. We are excited to be involved for this year’s event – the third in a row.\n\nSpeaking to the organisers of the event, they could not have imagined how a trio playing a few songs in the backyard for one of the families years ago, could have grown into such an awesome event.\n\nThis year’s event was a little bittersweet with one of the faces of the Festival, Eliza, passing away to the terrible disease this year.\n\nThere was a video tribute to Eliza and her courage and you could have heard a pin drop amongst the large crowd.\n\nPresident of Brighter Days Paul Terrill, Matty Powell and Steve Dundon and their amazing committee and volunteers outdid themselves with the organisation, bands and the entertainment again. Matt and Steve are also key members of the Screamin’ Eagles so their weekend was packed between performing, filming for HDTV and managing of the event itself.\n\nThe event is free to attend and the involvement of the sponsors and generosity of those attending is what makes it such a success. The local Bright community also really get behind the event and are fantastic in their support of the weekend.\n\nEntertainment for the kids was a standout with an outdoor movie screening, connected circus space and kids zone area along with the amazing race on Sunday morning.\n\nPlenty to see and do all weekend with some great classic cars and bikes also on display.\n\nSome of the bands we rocked out to included Psuedo Echo, Screamin Eagles, Chantoozies along with a surprise appearance by Chocolate Starfish and many others.\n\nThe Eliza Baird Brightstars were sensational with the younger generation getting up to entertain the crowds.\n\nCongratulations to the winners of the Mustang and the bikes. Unfortunately it wasn’t one of the McKenzie Ross tickets – we will just have to have another go next year.\n\nThe event raised in excess of $300,000 for the nominated charities with cheque presentation to be held in April.\n\nThe only downside was having to make the long journey home. We hope to see you at the Brighter Days Festival in 2019!!"
