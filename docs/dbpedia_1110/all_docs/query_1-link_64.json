        "text": "By JOHN VAN KLAVEREN\n\nIT’S NOTHING but fun when self-proclaimed party band The Chantoozies takes over the stage to remind audiences of just how big they were in the ’80s and ’90s.\n\nThe current line-up of Tottie Goldsmith, Ally Flower and Eve von Bibra will head to the Sphinx Hotel on 22 August to continue celebrating the joy of live music.\n\n“It’s fun,” Goldsmith told the Independent while helping pilot a three-tonne truck out of Dubbo on a regional tour of New South Wales for the play Sex With Strangers.\n\n“We love doing live gigs because people of our generation are out again, enjoying the freedom after having done the hard yards raising the family.\n\n“People still have a hankering for remembering how amazing the ’80s and ’90s were. The music was incredible and we’re honoured to have been part of it.\n\n“People of our era all love live music. They know it and it’s what we understand, it’s part of the culture of our time.\n\n“People are bringing their kids, particularly their daughters, and they love it.\n\n“I hate to it admit but we’re retro,” Goldsmith laughed.\n\nAnd she knows what she’s talking about, having given up career prospects to start a family. Not it’s all about the shared enjoyment with audiences who recall The Chantoozies with fondness.\n\nThat feeling has been part of the organic life of the band through the years, originally formed for a one off-show that won a residency at the renowned Melbourne Underground nightclub after an overwhelming response.\n\n“We never ever had a big plan. It was always just trying things and seeing what happened,” Goldsmith recalled.\n\nWhat happened was industry management, record deals, singles, albums, film clips and touring, achieving top-20 hits and reaching platinum and gold sales.\n\nThese days the trio self-manages everything from booking venues to travel and accommodation.\n\n“We love seeing people having fun. There’s nothing like it, just being free and not worrying about what anyone thinks,” Goldsmith said.\n\n“It’s healthy and we need the break and it’s a great way to meet people instead of being isolated by the internet.\n\n“We have a ball.”"
