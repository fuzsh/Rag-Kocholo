        "text": "MICHAEL SOLOMON GUDINSKI: 1952-2021\n\nBy 1974, the yardstick for album sales by a local act in this country was the 60,00O or so achieved by the first Daddy Cool effort three years before. Nobody was presuming that it could go much higher. Apart, that is, from Michael Gudinski.\n\nAt the age of 22, this powerhouse of Russian Jewish descent, an alumni of Mt Scopus College and a former teenage dance promoter and band roadie, had established in 1970 the Consolidated Rock artist agency with Michael Browning (who would become the first AC/DC manager), the pair later founding the short-lived music magazine Daily Planet. He was operating a grassroots independent record label, Mushroom Records, that was concentrating on progressive underground acts, attempting to take both rock and popular music in a new direction.\n\nThe label, formed with Ray Evans, had debuted with a truly ambitious triple live album of Sunbury 1973 and had forged ahead with ambitious albums of progressive, underground offerings by McKenzie Theory and Greg Sneddon. But it was plainly radio hits they were after and they came in 1973 with the bands Madder Lake, the Dingoes, Chain’s Matt Taylor and Ayers Rock.\n\nMushroom struggled to survive for its first two years and reportedly came close to folding on several occasions, being kept afloat by support of Festival Records boss Alan Hely. Then Skyhooks came into Michael’s life. This loud, garish, underground cult-politico outfit, driven by the deft songs of Greg Macainsh, cut the album Living in the70s, which stormed to a quarter of a million sales, proving to all that an Australian band could compete here with any import.\n\nAs their manager, Gudinski gleefully revelled in the swathe the band cut through Australian life. At one point they appeared in concert with a giant imitation penis which ejaculated Twisties: parents were not pleased. Soon after, Mushroom delivered Take It Greasy, a triple-platinum debut by Ol’ 55 which knocked Abba off No.1 and gave us more lunatics with Frankie J Holden and Wilbur Wilde. They and Skyhooks went out on the road together on the Brats Are Back! tour.\n\nTowards the end of the decade, quirky Kiwi outfit Split Enz were signed. They didn’t fire for the first couple of years but When Neil Finn joined his brother Tim and wrote I Got You, they had a 1980 single which topped the charts for two months. Tim says: “When Michael came to see us play in 1975, he immediately wanted to sign us to Mushroom. That kind of maverick impulse is the lifeblood of rock’n’roll. When Michael got you, he got you for life. His complete loyalty to artists, good times and bad, is why I love him.”\n\nAyers Rock were the first Mushroom artist to sign an international contract, with Gudinski inking a landmark deal with Jerry Moss of A&M Records, followed by one with the Dingoes. He would have global aspirations thereafter, though they would not always yield the results he anticipated.\n\nAfter an impromptu performance of The Locomotion at a football charity event with the cast of Neighbours, Kylie Minogue signed with Mushroom, to some derision. Her recording of the song spent seven weeks at No.1 and she was packed off to England soon after. She has now sold over 70 million records, has become a beloved diva and had and remained close to Gudinski, now saying “my heart is broken”. Similar mainstream pop success in the midst of an otherwise cutting-edge rock environment would come soon after with the top five success of the late Christie Allen. Peter Andre, the Chantoozies, Dannii Minogue, Jason Donovan and Sister 2 Sister would also see them dabble in that genre.\n\nSo many of his relationships proved to be extraordinarily enduring in a cut-throat industry. Not just Kylie but Paul Kelly and Jimmy Barnes. With Kelly, Mushroom was there to support a brave 1982 album recorded in the Philippines and then saw him through his evolution to the position of beloved singer-songwriter.\n\nThe association with Barnes has seen well over a dozen No.1 albums, including Soul Deep, just behind John Farnham’s Whispering Jack as the biggest selling album in Australia by a singer. It was he who gave perhaps the most heartfelt tribute: “Today the heart of Australian music was ripped out. He stood with me through my darkest moments and my most joyous days. Michael was the rock I reached for when life tried to wash me away. He never closed his door or his heart to me and my family. I loved Michael, always will.”\n\nParallel to Gudinski‘s ever-waving antennae for promising new entities, was his ability to could also spot artists, often widely known, from whom there was still commercial life to be had. He would take on, after other labels had given them their best shot, people like the Angels, Renee Geyer, Rose Tattoo, Saints, Jo Jo Zep & the Falcons, Church, Hoodoo Gurus, Kate Ceberano, Russell Morris, Black Sorrows, Sunnyboys, Wedding Parties Anything and the Choirboys (who presented him with the pub rock ‘standard’ Run To Paradise). There were many major hits to be had from these ‘discards’.\n\nThe acts signed to Mushroom, to its subsidiary White Label, and to the Melodian imprint Gudinski established in 1988 with fellow St Kilda football team devotee Ian ‘Molly’ Meldrum and Liberation Music, which he initiated with Warren Costello in 1999, reflected a keen awareness of what was happening in the rock and performance environment: Models, the Swingers, Birthday Party, Hunters & Collectors, Go-Betweens, Ian Moss, DD Smash, Mother Goose, Deborah Conway, the Mavis’s, Machine Gun Fellatio, Dynamic Hepnotics, Nick Barker & the Reptiles, Kings Of the Sun, Stems, Painters & Dockers, James Freud & the Radio Stars, Rockmelons, Deni Hines, Jane Clifton, Kids in the Kitchen, the Triffids, Big Pig, Paul Norton, Machinations, Christine Anu, the Someloves, Frente, My Friend The Chocolate Cake, Debra Byrne, Toni Pearen, Jo Beth Taylor, Vika & Linda, Swoop, Indecent Obsession, Roxus, Eskimo Joe, British India, Vance Joy and the Temper Trap.\n\nEvery one of them seems to have a cogent recollection of the experience. “Michael Gudinski was a raw flame in the wax museum” says Michael Spiby of the Badloves. “Music culture in this country got real as a direct result of his passion and those he inspired. He helped give Australian music a real sense of ourselves, as an authentic voice distinct from international copycat trends.\n\n‘Michael Gudinski was a raw flame in the wax museum.’\n\nMichael Spiby, the Badloves\n\n“Blessed with a fierce loyalty to tribe, MG was a good man to have in your corner. He took the Badloves in when no one else would touch us and encouraged the band to do our own thing. That’s something I’m eternally grateful for.”\n\nAs is Archie Roach, who recorded his Charcoal Lane album for Mushroom 30 years ago. “He was a staunch supporter of the work we do. He championed First Nations musicians like Yothu Yindi, Troy Cassar-Daley and Dan Sultan to name a few, along with myself.”\n\nHe seemed to be everywhere in the music industry - no stone left unturned. To say that Michael, a man who filled every corner of the music industry in this country “did a lot for the music business” is very much an understatement. The words commonly used in the deluge of commentary that has followed his death: foundation, pivot, cornerstone, visionary, titan, powerhouse, trailblazer, supporter, father figure, formidable, loveable rogue, are all correct.\n\nThere was almost no area where Gudinski wasn’t a mover and shaker – not just with his record company but Mushroom Music, Premier Artists, Mushroom Pictures, Liberation and The Frontier Touring Company.\n\nFrontier, which he established with his old comrade Michael Chugg in 1979, rose to become one of the most admired and competitive touring companies in the word, importingimported the likes of the Police, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Elton John and Billy Joel, Bob Dylan with Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Frank Sinatra, the Eagles, Foo Fighters, Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen, Faith No More, Alicia Keys and hundreds more. Indeed, it was Springsteen said of Gudinski: who was one of the global stars most moved, stating “I’ve toured the world for the last 50 years and never met a better promoter.”\n\nIn the early 1990s, Gudinski sold 49 per cent of Mushroom to News Ltd. He controversially sold his remaining 51 per cent share to News in 1999 for a reported $60 million. It gave him the capital to be truly diverse. He produced the 2000 film Chopper and was also a leading figure in the racing industry, co-owning three Melbourne Cup champions in a syndicate led by businessman Lloyd Williams."
