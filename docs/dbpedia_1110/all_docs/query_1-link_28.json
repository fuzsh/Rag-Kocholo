        "text": "Whenever a band announces a reunion we instinctively rejoice. This is often against our better judgement, for music is not primarily about thinking but about feeling.\n\nMusic is a useful emotional heightener, as that behavioural scientist says in A Clockwork Orange, which explains why we are so moved each time we hear Plastic Bertrand sing Ca Plane Pour Moi even though we have no idea what the hell he is on about. (Sure you can Google for the translation, but why ruin the magic?)\n\nYet after the celebrations that (insert name of ageing musical group here) is reforming for that one last Blue Velvet gasp of pop glory, we need to step back a moment and ask that big, hard question: why?\n\nBand reformations are always driven by compelling motives, chief among them being - ta dah! - money. Sure, there is nostalgia, rewarding fans for their loyalty, reconnecting with a new demographic and all that sort of thing, but the desire for that new couch factors largely in the decision.\n\nUnlikely as it sounds, though, it is possible for a band to reconstitute for altruistic reasons. After their appearance at Live 8, the exhumed members of Pink Floyd announced they would be donating all royalties from their 1343 per cent post-concert sales spike to the cause. Cynics were understandably stunned.\n\nAnd it is in that spirit of giving for the betterment of all that the Chantoozies should seriously consider getting back together.\n\nThe Chantoozies were a local group that made some ripples in the late-1980s with their pleasantly infectious brand of throwaway pop. They were fronted by four energetic girls - Tottie Goldsmith, Eve Von Bibra, Angie La Bozzetta and Ally Fowler - and backed by... uh... four guys with instruments.\n\nThere was nothing deep about the Chantoozies. That's what was so cool about them. They didn't mean anything, they didn't hurt anyone, they didn't have an agenda. It was just four gals with big hair and shoulder pads jumping around. They were our Bananarama. Or they should have been.\n\nYet through their glorious superficiality came one gem of a song in 1988 that never received its due. Indeed, it's so obscure its lyrics can't even be Googled. It was called Wanna Be Up and the chorus went something like this:\n\nWanna be up\n\nDon't wanna be down.\n\nThis might not sound like much as far as philosophies go, but when you consider how the life's work of history's greatest thinkers - Immanuel Kant, Heidegger, David Hume, and all the other guys from that Python song - could be boiled down to a single pithy line, it's as good as any.\n\nAnd, boy, do we need it now. Look around. What do you see? Death and destruction and hatred and murder and drugs and corruption and bad television. It's enough to get you down. But we...\n\nWanna be up\n\nDon't wanna be down.\n\nOther compelling reasons favour a reunion: all four girls are still with us; they all still look great; and, most importantly, they're all still friends.\n\nAnd they wouldn't need to tour, or even put on a whole concert. We just need them back to do that one song. Having graced us, they can then get back to what they were doing."
