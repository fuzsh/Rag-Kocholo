Young Modern and Ash Naylor & The Triad\n\nAustralia has produced a number of fine Power Pop-associated bands over the years. One of the first – the very first according to US Power Pop bible Bomp! Magazine – was Adelaide’s Young Modern, who originally existed in the late ’70s.\n\nYoung Modern’s sound – an amalgam of classic mid-‘60s Byrds/Beatles/Stones sounds, beautifully jangling guitars and superbly crafted songs – will no doubt find favour with a younger generation of fans who grew up seeing Ash Naylor play around town with his fantastic guitar pop group Even.\n\nYoung Modern debuted in Adelaide – supporting Radio Birdman – in 1977. The band was formed by singer John Dowler, a seminal figure who’s been talking about Big Star since the ’70s and whose first band Spare Change was probably the first Australian band to perform material by the likes the Velvet Underground, John Cale and Sparks and even early Bruce Springsteen! Spare Change had an impact on mid-‘70s Melbourne; and other members of the band went on to play with Paul Kelly and Icehouse.\n\nAshley Naylor & The Triad are regrouping following Ash’s arrival home from a US tour with Paul Kelly (he has also played alongside Tim Finn and Stephen Cummings, and has been a member of the Rockwiz Orchestra since 2015, and a member of The Stems since 2010). Joining Ash in the group again are Rick Plant (Sherry Rich’s ex-pat Nashville husband, who has played with Americans including Buddy Miller of Emmylou Harris fame), Matt Palmer (Carousel, The Youngsters, Raw Nerves) and Michael Barclay (Livingstone Daisies, Weddings Parties Anything and former Paul Kelly & the Coloured Girls drummer).|\n\nCheckout Ash on Facebook\n\nInto The Mystic – The Music of Van Morrison\n\nFor the past four years, Into The Mystic has played solidly to increasing sell-out crowds across the country. Fronted by Joe Creighton, who is arguably one of this countrys finest bass players, it is his vocals that have cemented him as a formidable talent and front man after stepping out of the shadows as bassist and backing vocals for icons such as Kylie Minogue, Olivia Newton-John and John Farnham.\n\nStarting out as a four piece band the show mushroomed into a five piece, then seven piece and now an established eight piece band which incorporates the three piece horn section affectionately known as The Belfast Horns lead by the legendary Jimmy Sloggett on Saxophone.\n\nCreighton grew up in Belfast during the late 60s to the backdrop of the civil rights movement, riots and religious and social unrest – remarkable times in history that all played out to the soundtrack of Van Morrison and a band simply known as Them.\n\nRoaming the same streets as Morrison, Creighton would watch Them perform live in the early days at the Maritime Club in Belfast and it is this connection that allows Creighton to bring a raw honesty and tremendous authenticity to his show Into the Mystic that pays homage to the legendary Irish songwriter – Van Morrison.\n\nCreighton’s reading of Van Morrison’s ‘Madame George’ is just about the best version of the song outside Astral Weeks. – Brian Wise, Rhythms Magazine 3RRR\n\nDancing In The Street – A Tribute To Motown\n\nIn 1962 the Motortown Revue took the Sound of Young America and hit the road, filling theatres and dance floors across the USA. With a band featuring some of the best and most experienced musicians in Melbourne, Dancing In The Street captures the essence of the great Motown sound and is guaranteed to fill theatres and dance floors across Melbourne. The Dancing In The Street performers are no strangers to the stage, having performed in Melbourne for many years, in all manner of performances, from theatre productions to tributes to artists such as Joe Cocker and Ray Charles.\n\nTHE BAND\n\nJon Roberts  Lead Vocals\n\nRegin Le Faye  Lead Vocals\n\nKate Johnstone  Backing Vocals\n\nMartin DeMarte  Guitar & Vocals\n\nJoseph Beckitt  Keyboards & Vocals\n\nShane Cole  BassJeff Barnes  Drums\n\nAndrew Arney  Saxophones\n\nBryan Chetcuti  Trumpet\n\nCheck out the band’s Facebook Page\n\nOTHER SHOWS @ THE SAUCER\n\nRussell Morris & Band\n\nThe past five years have been an incredible musical journey and privilege for Russell Morris who has been fortunate enough to create and release two albums of blues and roots music that pertains to some of the iconic characters, events and moments in our rich tapestry of Australian history. The two previous albums were produced by Mitch Cairns, with whom Russell Morris works and creates harmoniously with.\n\nThe first album released was Sharkmouth which is all about the urban back blocks and the characters that inhabited them. Mostly based around the depression years and a bit either side. Set out to paint a landscape of how many people must have felt in those times around the early 1900s. Sharkmouth went on to be the highest selling Australian album of 2013, picking up an ARIA Award for best Blues and Roots, reaching number 1 in the charts and surpassing Platinum sales. A very unexpected but welcomed success.\n\nThe following album, Van Diemens Land focuses on larger events rather than individuals, from the prison ships that began Australia as a penal settlement to the union strikes, the First and Second World Wars as well as paddle steamers on the Murray River. Van Diemens Land was nominated for Best Blues and Roots at the 2014 ARIA Awards, certified Gold sales and was the highest charting album of Russells 50 year career to date debuting at No.4 on the overall ARIA Charts.\n\nRussell has now arrived at the third and final album in the series of Australian stories. Also produced by Mitch Cairns, this album is titled Red Dirt  Red Heart, and the name belies its subject matter  The Australian Interior. Any history of Australia albeit, very brief, has to include the people who have inhabited this wonderful country for at least 40,000 years. Stories of two bushrangers, a song about a beautiful town, a song about a loner, a recluse, and an escape artist (Gaol that is), a snake and the spectacular Nullabour. Also included is some of our great indigenous heroes in the hope that we can share their stories.\n\nCheck out Russell’s Facebook page\n\nOTHER FLYING SAUCER SHOWS\n\nSand Pebbles\n\nThe back-story of the Sand Pebbles is as colourful as the bands music.

Chuck Berry’s songs ‘Sweet Little 16’, ‘Johnny B Goode’ and ‘Rock n Roll music’ were favourites for The Fab Five. In early 1958, Chuck Berry released ‘Sweet Little Sixteen’, a song that would change the course of music history. It ignited the urge to celebrate rock and roll in kids throughout America, but it also travelled the world and influenced four boys in Liverpool during their defining years. Five years later, the Beatles recorded ‘Sweet Little Sixteen’ only once in London before storming America in the winter of 1964. During their formative years, some of the Beatles’ biggest hits were covers of Chuck songs.\n\nThe second half of the show focuses on songs that Chuck influenced the Beatles throughout their iconic career. Chuck’s influence was on nearly every album from ‘I saw her standing there’ (off Please Please Me album) and ‘Back in the USSR’ (off The White album) through to their final album Abbey Road where some of the lyrics of ‘Come Together’ where a straight lift from Chuck’s ‘You can’t catch me’.\n\n“From the first minute we heard the great guitar intro to ‘Sweet Little Sixteen,’ we became fans of the great Chuck Berry, his stories were more like poems than lyrics—the likes of ‘Johnny B. Goode’ or ‘Maybelline.’ To us he was a magician making music that was exotic yet normal at the same time. We learnt so many things from him which led us into a dream world of rock ‘n’ roll music”. “Chuck was and is forever more one of rock ‘n’ roll’s greatest legends all over the world”. – Paul McCartney\n\nIt’s hard to imagine the Beatles without Chuck Berry paving the way for them, but then again it’s impossible to imagine the last half-century of music as a whole without the inventor of rock, Chuck Berry & The Beatles!! And as John Lennon once quoted “if you wanted to give rock n roll another name – call it Chuck Berry”.\n\nFor a night of rock n’ roll, dancing and duck walks, DO NOT MISS OUT!\n\nA message from BackBeat re: FSC relocation “The FSC will come back bigger and better at a fab location I’m sure!!

The band features the highest calibre musicians Melbourne can offer along with Anny Remsnik, the sensational backing vocalist and percussionist, who has been with the band from the very start of their journey.\n\nJohn Mellencamp was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009. In his induction it was said that “Mellencamp has created an important body of work that has earned him both critical regard and an enormous audience . His songs document the joys and struggles of ordinary people seeking to make their way, and he has consistently brought the fresh air of common experience to the typically glamour-addled world of popular music”.\n\nReliving those heady days when songs like ‘Hurt So Good’, ‘Cherry Bomb’, ‘Pink Houses’ and ‘Lonely Ol’ Night’ were the anthems of a generation and now the Classic hits of today.

Maybe a country music album? Yeah, nah. Classical? Yeah, nah. Punk? Yeah, nah. Polka? Most definitely nah.\n\n‘Yeah Nah’ is instead nine original rock/alt/indie gems penned by Stratford, along with two co-writes from him with Graham Gillmore and Tom Rouch. It was also produced by Rouch, a noted film and television composer and acclaimed session guitarist (film scores include The Reckoning, The Will To Fly, and Furious 7). These songs touch on the big themes in life, along with the occasional political/social comment and display flashes of sharp wit, healthy cynicism and good humour throughout.\n\nHis newest album ‘Yeah Nah’ was produced by noted film and television composer and acclaimed session guitarist Tom Rouch (film scores include The Reckoning, The Will to Fly, and Furious 7) and continues the exploration of themes established in Nick’s debut album Astroboy.\n\nNick spent 8 years in NYC fronting several bands in the late ’80’s, landing a demo deal with Atlantic records. He has played solo shows and opened for acts as diverse as Chris Whitley, The Murmurs, Spin Doctors and Holly Cole Trio.\n\nWhen he returned to Oz, Nick spent 7 years working in television as a producer, presenter and writer and was last seen as the original host in Channel 10’s Ready Steady Cook. He has spent the last 10 years as one of Australia’s leading voice-over artists, allowing him the time to concentrate on songwriting, recording his first full length album ‘Astroboy’ in 2011. At times deeply personal and poignant (the title track is about his now 14-year-old quadriplegic son, Oli), his songs embrace styles from rock to alternative to indie and surf, with a deeply Australian style ala Sunnyboys and Hoodoo Gurus.\n\nRecorded in Tom’s home studio and at Birdland Studios, several songs from ‘Yeah Nah’ were originally recorded in 2001, shelved and revisited and re-recorded for this release.\n\nTo support the release of the single and album, Nick will play live shows featuring a full band with Nick on vocals and bass with guitarist and producer Tom Rouch on lead guitar.\n\nCheck out Nick on Facebook\n\nKarise Eden\n\nKarise Eden’s voice can move a nation!

It took them on a journey and lead them to their own successful careers. Now, they come together as a band to perform the songs that would influence a lifetime of artists. Put simply, “they dont write songs like this anymore.\n\nIf you remember the 60 and 70s .. you werent there was never a true evaluation for the four members of Melbourne band Raw Brit. If you were there, how could you have missed the greatest time in music history? infers lead singer Mick Pealing. Britain created some of the most influential artists .. and if you MISSED it, you werent there!\n\nIn the swinging 60s, Britain (and the world) was undergoing a meaningful cultural change. Such an awakening had not been seen in modern society and the historical significance of this period is well documented in music. The percolating effect to Australian musicians was very noticeable.\n\nGuitarist Bob Spencer who attributes his virtuoso rock-blues style to Paul Kossoff of Free, muses: if Id have known how important British music was going to be to me, I would have held more allegiance to the Queen and spoke with a Cockney accent.\n\nAnger, anti-establishment and an unbridled mistrust of authority, fuelled a need for a voice and it was through music that best expressed these feelings.\n\nIt was the seminal sound for all those wanna-be popstars of today .. and sadly, they probably don’t even know it admits bass player John Favaro.\n\nThe 60s and 70s enforced a new essence with the intent of making a direct connection to a displaced youth. Created out of adversity with a necessity for a social change .. the corner was turned.\n\nevery pimple and every hormone in my body got excited when I heard the first few bars of Substitute by The Who says drummer Peter Maz Maslen.\n\nRaw Brit has played the music they love with a healthy respectful irreverence to excited sell-out audiences around Melbourne for 3 years.\n\nThis is more than obvious when you witness the band live and in action.\n\nRAW BRIT:\n\nMick Pealing: (Stars, The Ideals)\n\nBob Spencer: (Skyhooks, The Angels)\n\nJohn Favaro: (The Badloves, The Undertow)\n\nPeter Maz Maslen: (Boom Crash Opera, The Undertow\n\nCHECK OUT THE BAND’s FACEBOOK PAGE\n\nCoxy & The Roxy Boys – Roxy Reunion\n\nPeople fell in love, danced, laughed, partied, even got married at The Roxy, it has a special place in the hearts of many and the talent is no exception.
