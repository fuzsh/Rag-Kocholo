        "text": "To describe Tottie Goldsmith as \"multi-talented\" is a gross understatement.\n\nAs a founding member of the band Chantoozies, Tottie toured Australia many times, appearing on every imaginable entertainment program and sold over 200,000 records. Upon leaving the band, Tottie embarked on a solo career - more singing and studying acting with the prestigious Beverly Hills Playhouse and Janet Alhanti's workshops in Los Angeles. On her return to Australia, Tottie landed the female lead in Beyond Production's Fire (1995) which was followed by a guest appearance in Bryan Brown's Twisted Tales (1996), playing opposite Academy Award-winner Geoffrey Rush.\n\nAdding but yet another string to her bow, Tottie, in 1996, signed on as host of Channel 10's controversial series Sex/Life which became one of Australia's most talked about shows. During this time, Tottie also hosted Channel 10's coverage of the 1997 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and 40 Year of Television. As if 1997 wasn't busy enough, Tottie yet again displayed an ability to successfully conquer new challenges headlining Melbourne's top rating breakfast program on TTFM. After wading through various possibilities in 1998, Tottie accepted the role of \"Miss Lynch\" in \"Grease\" - the Arena Spectacular, becoming part of the phenomenon in Australian box office history.\n\nIn 1998, Tottie played \"Janet\" in \"The New Rocky Horror Show\" at Sydney's Star City. It was a role which offered Tottie the chance to display her many talents... a culmination of all her acting, singing and dancing experience. After having achieved so much already in her career, it is worth mentioning that it was Tottie's first starring role in Musical Theatre, adding yet another notch to the belt of one of this country's most dynamic and versatile performers. She also played the role of \"Susanne\" in the comic farce \"Don't Dress For Dinner\" which has had enormous success in London's Westend. The Australian version also starred Dennis Waterman, Jon English and Sue Hodge from \"Allo Allo\" fame. The show successfully toured Australia for four months to sell-out audiences.\n\nTottie then returned back in front of the camera with a guest role in Channel 9's Stingers (1998), was part of a very strong cast in a Beyond Simpson LeMesurier tele-movie \"Life\" to air this year on Channel 10 and a role in another feature film \"Visitors\" by Bayside Pictures, the producers of 'Hotel Sorrento' and 'Brilliant Lies', released late 2003.\n\nThe corporate market has opened up to Tottie in the past year. She has hosted launch events and corporate dinners and also includes motivational speaking high on her agenda. Tottie has addressed audiences for companies including RetireInvest, McDonald's and Holden. She has hosted numerous charity events including Clown Doctors, RVIB Ball, TLC for Kids and hosts the annual Mothers Day Comedy Debate for Melbourne University.\n\nTottie made another guest appearance in 2004 on Stingers (1998) with Steve Bisley as her co-star, and also completed an extended guest role on Blue Heelers (1994).\n\nAfter releasing her meditation CD, \"Unwind Your Mind\", late last year, Qantas announced that they have programmed the CD on their inflight Oasis Channel beginning June 2005. Tottie teamed up with sleep scientist Chris Bunney, to research, validate and produce \"Falling Asleep with Tottie Goldsmith\", her next CD in the series to help people with sleep problems.\n\nIn May 2005, Tottie jumped at the opportunity to donate her services to perform for the troops in the Middle East! For two weeks, she MC'd and sang her way through places such as Kuwait and Baghdad with the Army Band Australia and also managed to squeeze in some deep relaxation classes for the soldiers at the army bases."
