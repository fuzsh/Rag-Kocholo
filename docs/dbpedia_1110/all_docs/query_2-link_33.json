Doing a few days onboard the Carnival Splendour A few days in Singapore And then Hamilton Island I'm excited to ease back. The last few weeks getting up on stage, trying something new by doing standup has been a lot of fun.

Shaynna's voice is truly powerhouse crazy good. It blew everyone in the room away. The new track \"WARRIOR\" is cowritten and made with the gentleman and legend that is the one and only Gary Pinto. It's likely bound to be a top 10 hit. It is beyond good and a perfect, powerful anthem we all need right now. Especially women. Thanks, @angieyoungxposed publicist to the stars for the invite.

I’m on the lookout for a new role in areas of Producing for tv and radio, radio announcing, Hosting, facilitating live events and guest talks etc I’d love to connect with you all, share my experiences, and catch up on what’s new in your world. If you hear of any exciting opportunities or are open to chatting with a real go getter whose own self produced tv series of 26 episodes won awards , send me a message or comment below! #OpenToWork\n\nDid you know I owe my, now award winning TV series getting started to Gretel Killeen? Crazy right! During lockdown I did a zoom radio interview with her (was so nervous ) and she said that this is what I should be doing. She told me that she was so refreshed to chat with an interviewer that had done their research, was able to go off script and ask questions that were not just pre planned, but made sense and followed on with her comments. She loved how I listened and actually had read the books, watched the clips and spent time looking at her art. So I was thrilled, when she was one of the first guests on the TV show. Here is a super small clip. Be sure to check out her Art. She is exceptionally talented.\n\nBefore the Jungle on @imacelebrityau the delightful @stephenkamos braved the hot seat on my TV show. He had 60 seconds to answer as many questions with obmy 2 options to choose as he could- including a sneaky who is nicer @thelastlegofficial host Adam Hills or Good News week and Doug Anthony All Star- Paul McDermott - both Aussie TV legends I adore. I'm cheering on Stephen. An amazing comedian and top bloke. Best of luck! @channel10au #gay #queer #comedian #comedy #imaceleb #imacelebrity #imacelebrityau #laughs #Jungle #Africa #England #jokes #malcolminthemiddle competition #charity #liveattheappollo #gameshow #interview #television"
