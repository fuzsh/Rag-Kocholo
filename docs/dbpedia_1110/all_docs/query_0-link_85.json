With singles ‘Hold Me’ and ‘Man Of The Universe’ already fan favourites, Run Home Slow more than delivers on the promise of the band’s breakout debut record, Half Mile Harvest which recently peaked at #5 on the US iTunes album chart. The four friends have delivered another timeless set that expands on their trademark soul/blues sound with elements of southern rock, Americana, psychedelia, Dixieland jazz, gospel and a striking pop number in third single ‘So Caught Up’. The band have pulled out all stops over the past six months, captivating fans around the world with sold out shows and festival slots across USA, Canada, UK, Europe and Japan. Josh Teskey’s once-in-a-generation voice leaves audiences gasping while the band ignites around him. It’s a show not to be missed.\n\nJOE CAMILLERI Any examination of The Black Sorrows comes down to one person, Joe Camilleri, front man and the brains behind the band. Recently awarded “living legend” status by Rolling Stone, Joe’s career spans an astonishing 50+ years. As a singer, songwriter, saxophonist and producer Joe Camilleri is considered one of the most genuinely talented figures in Australian music still at the top of his game. Songs such as So Young, Hit & Run, Shape I’m In, Hold On To Me, Harley & Rose, Chained To The Wheel, Never Let Me Go and the Chosen Ones have become radio staples. As leader of two of Australia’s most successful bands, Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons and The Black Sorrows, Joe’s music has become part of Australian music culture. Joe was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2007. Over the years other greats have admired Camilleri’s signwriting. Elvis Costello and John Denver are just two who have recorded cover versions of Joe’s music. Never one to sit still Camilleri is preparing to promote the 3rd single from his 49th album, The Black Sorrows’ Citizen John, on a 15 show tour of Europe (the band’s 2nd European jaunt for 2019) and a 50+ show tour in Australia.\n\nCARL BARRON Carl’s non-threatening observational style of comedy appeals to everyone. He has touched the hearts of thousands of people with his gentle, self-conscious, relaxed and original approach to comedy. Since winning Comic of the year and Best Up and Coming Talent in 1993, Carl has established himself as one of the most accomplished comedy performers in Australia and around the world.

His second show ‘Whatever Comes Next’ won Best International Show at the N.Z. Comedy Festival which was then released on DVD entering the Charts at Number One, staying there for over 12 months and then being nominated for an ARIA award.\n\nDAN SULTAN has been a singular musical presence in Australia since 2006’s Homemade Biscuits.\n\nQuickly becoming a household name, the album Blackbird won three NIMAs, the 2014 ARIA for Best Rock Album and was certified gold. Killer was nominated for Best Rock Album and Best Independent Release at the 2017 ARIA Awards. Sultan was nominated for Best Male Artist, not for the first time. 2019’s Aviary Takes, is a collection of back catalogue songs, new tracks, including a couple of covers, all recorded in ‘one vocal take’ at The Aviary Studios. ‘Nali & Friends’, is Dan’s debut kids album showing his versatility as a revered songwriter.\n\nRHONDA BURCHMORE After 30 years in the business, this vivacious, flame-haired beauty continues to turn heads wherever she goes and draw thunderous applause wherever she performs.

In 2014 Rhonda was awarded the OAM for her service to the performing arts and community.\n\nCHANTOOZIES Somethings are just meant to be – and it was certainly that way for The Chantoozies. The dynamic female pop vocal group dominated the 1980s with their party anthems. From the 80’s to today, they have been adored by audiences for their vibrant live shows and their strong female lead vocal line-up. Led by Eve von Bibra, Tottie Goldsmith and Ally Fowler, they played to packed houses, sold-out national tours and joined international headliners on the road, all while keeping true to their ethos of putting on a great party. With the success of recent projects like Motown and Beyond , under their belt, and the release of their latest single Take Me In Your Arms. (Produced by Tim Henwood of Rogue Traders & Palace of the King), The Chantoozies are back and they are ready to party.\n\nROB SNARSKI a velvet voiced troubadour with a musical palette that lies somewhere between Havana and Helsinki … think Cuban cigar with a liquorice ice-cream. The lead singer and founding member of our national treasures THE BLACKEYED SUSANS and a hired gun; being guest vocalist with The Triffids and with The Go-Betweens|16 Lovers Lane shows both in Australia and overseas. Since the release of Snarski’s acclaimed solo debut “Wounded Bird” there’s been an album of cover songs “Low Fidelity”, the return to his beloved band The Blackeyed Susans for the album “Close Your Eyes and See” plus a set of short whimsical music and family related tales within his sweet memoir “You’re Not Rob Snarski – Crumbs from the Cake”. His latest solo release “Sparrow & Swan” sees a gravitational pull towards the narrative – conversation turns into song, late night tales become tunes. There are stories here from Brisbane cab drivers, girls from Belfast ‘74 in search of Van Morrison, football players and their protégés, relationships sparked in TABs, sightings of Robert Mitchum at Mitcham Station, a sailor in search of Helsinki …and the weather, there’s always the weather; the sun burning a hole in the sky or snow falling upon ancient ice …and birds, what’s with the birds?\n\nSTEPH TISDELL is a major rising star in the Australian Comedy Scene. After cutting her teeth in the UK and winning the Deadly Funny National Grand Final in 2014, Steph has been collecting awards and accolades wherever she goes and building an impressive TV, radio and print credit. 2018 was a huge year for Steph, she toured Australia with the Aboriginal All Stars and Melbourne International Comedy Festival Roadshow and debuted her first solo show “Identity Steft” at Adelaide Fringe Festival, where she won the weekly award for best emerging talent, and The Melbourne International Comedy Festival where she was nominated for the illustrious Best Newcomer Award. 2019 is looking to be even bigger, she sold out her full runs at Sydney Comedy Festival and the Melbourne international Comedy Festival, where she received even more rave reviews and critical acclaim, winning the Melbourne Comedy Festival John Pinder Award. Steph is a proud Indigenous woman and is making a fast rise as one of Australia’s funniest Aboriginal comedian’s. With a magnetic personality and quirky stage presence that skips between gleefully playful to biting political satire, Steph’s comedy is vulnerable, real and insightful. Her witty observations challenge stereotypes in non-offensive and hilarious ways.\n\nPIERCE BROTHERS have taken their unique brand of folk music from busking on the streets of Melbourne to touring the world. Comprising of twin brothers Jack and Pat Pierce, the multi-instrumentalists have been shaking dance floors and selling out rooms across UK, Europe, Canada, USA and their native Australia. Their irresistible energy and world class live show has generated a word of mouth buzz not seen for some time.

The album came in at number #13 on the aria chats and was produced by Garrett Kato. 2019 will see the boys embarking on a massive world tour, including a string of headline dates and support slots to Tash Sultana, across USA, Europe, UK and Australia.\n\nKIKI COURTIDIS Since kicking off a career with a spot in the top 10 series of channel 7’s Popstars in 04, Kiki was quickly signed with Universal Records Australia. After becoming one of the first contestants to perform an original track live on national television with her song titled ‘Paper’, she exited the show with the opportunity to travel, co-write and perform in California, USA with acclaimed Aria award winner Tania Doko from Bachelor Girl.

Amongst his many talents, Justin performs live with Kiki and is an integral part of the performing/writing/recording process.\n\nTHE MELTDOWN Melbourne’s purveyors of the finest country soul, have released their self-titled debut album on Hope Street Recordings. The much acclaimed offering has secured their place as one of the most exciting new ensembles in Australian music. Blending country, gospel and 60s soul, the result is a unique take on Australian soul music and a record full of life, energy and deeply felt storytelling. With influences ranging from Father John Misty, Tedeschi Trucks Band and Alabama Shakes built above a steady foundation of southern soul music, this collection of stellar players have created a mesh of Stax and Motown with a healthy dose of the Nashville songwriting tradition. Making the song the focus, The Meltdown stay true to the common goal of the story and keep your attention on the honey soaked tones of Simon Burke’s incredible voice."
