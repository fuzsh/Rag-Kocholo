However, given the unfolding and expanding pandemic fears in Sydney and Brisbane, the department saw the risk of transmission as potentially too great.\n\nBecause of this, the organisers have made the difficult decision to cancel the event.\n\nTicketholders will be contacted by Ticketmaster during Monday June 28th regarding refunds - please do not contact them before that as they will not be in a position to process refunds until Monday - and we urge anyone who had booked accommodation or made travel arrangements to cancel them today or as soon as possible.\n\nWe are sorry to disappoint our ICEHOUSE fans and friends - the band looks forward to performing again whenever that may be possible and to seeing you there.\n\nIt is with great regret that ICEHOUSE announces that, due to Victoria’s current Covid-19 restrictions on gatherings, the performance at Bendigo’s Ulumbarra Theatre, scheduled for next Thursday June 24th will have to be cancelled.\n\nYesterday's announcements from the Victorian Government severely limit the number of patrons who can attend a venue and these mean that it isn’t possible for the previously Sold Out event to take place.\n\nAs ICEHOUSE has no touring plans at present where another date could be set, the band and promoter, Regional Touring, reluctantly agreed today to cancel the performance and refund ticketholders.\n\nEveryone involved is saddened by having to do so and apologise for any inconvenience caused to the band’s fans and supporters as well as the local businesses, technical crew and other staff who are affected.\n\nUlumbarra Theatre box office will be in touch tomorrow (Friday June 18th) from 10am to process refunds to all ticket holders. There is no need to contact the venue directly.\n\nICEHOUSE looks forward to a time when the band can get back to perform in Bendigo.\n\nThe By The C show has moved to Saturday, March 27th, 2021.\n\nIt will still be held at City Beach Oval in Perth and, along with ICEHOUSE, will feature the same line up, including Pete Murray, You Am I, Tex Perkins and Killing Heidi.\n\nAll ticketholders can hold onto their existing tickets, whether it be the original date of April 2020 or November 2020. They will be honoured for the March 27th show.\n\nShould you not be able to attend the newly scheduled show, refunds are available for 30 days from today until Friday, November 6th. Please contact Ticketmaster for refunds.\n\nThe Crowd Surf Festival has moved to Saturday, March 20th, 2021.\n\nHeld at the original venue of Sandstone Point Hotel, the lineup will remain the same.\n\nPerforming along with ICEHOUSE will be Pete Murray, The Black Sorrows with Vika and Linda Bull, Diesel, Busby Marou and Katie Noonan.\n\nShould you not be able to keep your ticket for that day, please contact your point of purchase for a refund.\n\nBy the C coming to St Kilda, Sunday 14, March 2021.\n\nThe By The C show in Cronulla, NSW will be an assigned seated event, which was part of the agreement with the NSW Health Department. If you have concerns regarding the seating assignment, please contact Zaccaria Concerts (info@zaccariaconcerts.com) and/or Ticketmaster.\n\nWe are happy to announce that ICEHOUSE will be headlining the By The C concert at Glenelg Beach on Saturday, February 13th, 2021. Joining ICEHOUSE on the bill will be James Reyne, Pete Murray, Baby Animals, Killing Heidi and Motor Ace. Tickets will go on sale on Monday, December 14th at 10am. Come join us for another great show at the fabulous Glenelg Beach! We are looking forward to seeing all of our friends and fans there!"
