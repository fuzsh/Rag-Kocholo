        "text": "The Chantoozies are an Australian pop group, formed in 1986. The group featured four female vocalists: Eve von Bibra, Angie La Bozzetta, Ally Fowler and Tottie Goldsmith, and four male musicians: Brett Goldsmith, Scott Griffiths, Frank McCoy and David Reyne. Their name is an intentional mispronunciation of the French word for a female singer, \"chanteuse\". Chantoozies' first single, \"Witch Queen\", was released on Mushroom Records in January 1987 and peaked at number 4 on the Australian singles chart. The group went on to sell 300,000 records, achieving Gold and Platinum status throughout the '80s and '90s in Australia. In early 2014, the Chantoozies released their first single in 23 years, called \"Baby It's You\". It was produced by Pseudo Echo frontman Brian Canham. The video co-starred Australian actors Hugh Jackman, Anthony LaPaglia and Eric Bana."
