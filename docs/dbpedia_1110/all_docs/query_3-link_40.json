        "text": "Australian music legend Joe Camilleri has rocked out at our Heart of St Kilda Concert for the past ten years because he believes in our vision of a fair, inclusive and compassionate community.\n\nReturning again at the Palais Theatre this October, Joe opened up to us about why he keeps coming back for more.\n\n“To put it simply; I keep coming back because of everything the Mission does for our community,” Joe says.\n\n“There are many people around here (St Kilda) that need support – they don’t want the world, they just want a helping hand, and the Mission does a fantastic job at giving them that.\n\n“You only have to go down Grey Street to witness some of the wonderful things that the Mission is doing for the community.\n\n“It’s a sad reality, but it’s also beautiful in a way, to see the generosity of what your organisation does to help people.”\n\nMusic and performing are in Joe’s DNA. From a young age he taught himself music, eventually becoming the leader of Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons and The Black Sorrows, arguably two of the most successful touring bands in Australia.\n\nJoe, who has lived in St Kilda for the past 16 years, says it is a place he loves and feels a part of.\n\n“The area means so much to me; I’m always so honoured to take part in the Heart of St Kilda Concert, it means a lot to the locals,” Joe says.\n\n“This event is one of the best in the competition and it’s a great way to give back.”\n\nJoe says he often sees musicians struggling with financial hardship around the area, which is what really strikes a chord with him.\n\n“I’m thankful that the frontline workers from the Mission are there to give them a hand up when they need it,” he says.\n\n“I know a little can go a long way, so the least I can do is play at the concert.”\n\nJoe joins another spectacular line-up at this year’s concert; including The Teskey Brothers, Carl Barron, Steph Disdell, Dan Sultan, Rhonda Burchmore, The Chantoozies, Rob Snarski, Pierce Brothers, Kiki Courtidis, The Meltdown, Billy Miller, Rebecca Barnard and The Caravan Choir and Brian Nankervis (the host) – with more acts to be announced.\n\n“It’s so powerful to see such a range of Australian talent stand together for this cause,” Joe says.\n\n“It’s a real honour to be performing at this event again, I can’t wait.”\n\nIn it’s twelfth successive year, this night of music and comedy attracts Australia’s finest musicians and comedians to the Palais Theatre stage."
