This has revealed her diversity as a performer - singer, actor, and comedian - simply an all-round performer who continues to keep her audiences entertained and exploding with laughter!\n\nWith her band in tow she performs an eclectic collection of original, cover & jazz songs as only Tracy can, mixing humour with some real vocal dynamics.\n\nTracy is also a campaigner for animal rights and children's rights - she is an ambassador for Australian's Against Child Abuse.
