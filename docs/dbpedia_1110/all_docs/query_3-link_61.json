I’ve worked long and hard in my profession and, like many of my colleagues, much has been for the greater benefit of the community. This is the first official governmental recognition I’ve received for the years I’ve been active in Australia 1978-ongoing, so I’m thrilled. I’d like to thank wholeheartedly those who nominated me for this honour and to assure all that I’ll continue to be active serving the community for as long as possible.”\n\nHe added: “I act as Chair of Rotary Melbourne’s Arts Committee; Freemasonry – I am Immediate Past Master and Education Officer of one of Freemason Victoria’s Lodges, and Jewish life, including my President’s role of kehillat s’dot zahav in Central Victoria and my links to Temple Beth Israel, where I assist Cantor Michel Laloum with choir direction for the yamim nora-im.\n\nAt the moment I’m working on a newly-established Youtube channel Kram’sNotes https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw79y5sHqNen5v8mypdo9sg?view_as=subscriber\n\nThe idea was originally to create vignettes of my reflections about music. At the moment it consists exclusively of videoed backing tracks of opera arias which I play, mouth some works and give some cues, to help opera singers with their lessons, exams, competition, auditions and concerts when they don’t have a live accompanist.”\n\nHe has lived in Bathurst for 36 years and loves living in a community where he knows everyone.\n\nAs a lawyer, he deals with people with disabilities and enjoys helping them to become part of the community as much as possible.\n\n“That’s something I feel good about. You do something you like and enjoy.\n\n“I have only done things which I enjoy doing,” he said.\n\nHis other passion is music and getting involved with Mitchell Conservatorium and Macquarie Philharmonia has fulfilled that interest.\n\nHe is proud to be named a Living Legend – an initiative of Bathurst Council – whereby a tree was planted in his name with a plaque. This year his wife, Martha, has also been named a Living Legend.\n\nThe title Living Legend recognises the achievements of local individuals and the way they have contributed positively to the community.\n\nBen and Martha’s son Adam lives in Sydney and is married to Rabbi Jacqueline Ninio of Emanuel Synagogue.\n\nHe says that he has given many decades of his life to Caulfield Hebrew Congregation and the Theodor Herzl Social Club. While he admits it has been a lot of work, it has been worth it to see the success of the shul and the building of the social club.\n\n“The club and the shul fulfilled my life,” he said.\n\nI have been involved in the entertainment industry for many years, and work closely with my aunt Olivia Newtown John. My work and my philanthropy has always made me feel a part of something. Everything has happened to me because I have loved it. I feel like I belong, the entertainment world is my family, and it is my purpose. The work I do with Olivia, and being able to help her from here has been wonderful."
