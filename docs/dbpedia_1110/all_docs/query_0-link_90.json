        "text": "Today I had the privilege of meeting Matt Cronin, the Chair of the Pat Cronin Foundation established in honour of his late son, Pat, the victim of a fatal coward punch. Matt is a true inspiration honouring Pat’s legacy whilst spreading the message that senseless violence needs to end given the damaging impact it has on families and the community. Sadly it is often teenagers and young adults who are at the coalface. At Vic Rajah Family Lawyers we look forward to partnering up with the Pat Cronin Foundation in 2023 to raise awareness of the issue and the positive change that the Foundation is seeking to achieve through education programs aimed at schools and sporting clubs. We love the Foundation’s motto which everyone should follow - be it in business or life, “Be Wise. Think Carefully. Act Kindly”\n\nWith a range of new faces joining our team of Be Wise educational presenters, it's great to be able to reflect on the incredible depth of professionalism in the ranks. One of newest is Aidan Phelan. With a background in education and assisting students with special needs, Aidan is a natural when it comes to engaging with young people in a classroom setting. Passionate about the Foundation and challenging \"skewed ideals of masculinity\" he believes that a significant shift in attitudes towards violence is entirely possible by connecting with the current generation. “Challenging stereotypes about masculinity and what it means to be ‘tough’, as well as entrenched beliefs relating to violence as the way to sort out problems, is important work,\" he says. We agree. Visit our website to book your Be Wise presentation for 2023. #patcroninfoundation #socialimpact #violenceprevention #respect #rolemodel #culture #influence #teachers #teaching #education\n\nLast call for anyone wishing to secure a ticket to our annual black-tie Be Wise Ball, at Melbourne Town Hall on Saturday, June 25. Ticket sales are available until Saturday, June 11, for what's going to be a great night out. Importantly the ball is also a chance to support the Foundation's vital work to End the Coward Punch. As part of that work, our Be Wise educational presentations in schools and sporting organisations have already reached 23,000 young people so far this year! Please join us. We'd love to see you there. #patcroninfoundation #endthecowardpunch #violenceprevention #education #melbourne\n\nThere are no scripts for parents when it comes to dealing with difficult topics with kids. However, it does become easier if you establish a habit of talking about everyday stuff and building a bond so that its smoothes the way when you need to talk about more important issues. As for conversation starters, try asking open-ended questions. if you ask: “How was your day?” you are likely to only get a response of “Ok!” Try something like: “Tell me about your day”, instead. Gauging the best time to talk is also key. Your child may not wish to open right away but let them know you are there for them to talk to, and try again in a day or two. You may even find an activity together and communicate while doing that. For more tips on helping your child cope with conflict, check out our infohub. #patcroninfoundation #endthecowardpunch #vioplenceprevention #teachingresources\n\nThe Be Wise Ball is back! This year, Aussie pop royalty The Chantoozies are ready to raise the roof on the Melbourne Town Hall as part of the big night - our major fundraiser - on June 25. The band's founding members Eve von Bibra and Ally Fowler are looking forward to getting back on stage and doing what they do best. “For me there’s nothing else like the thrill of being on stage,” says Ally. “And in this case, with the Pat Cronin Foundation, it’s for such a good cause.\" #patcroninfoundation #melbourne #melbourneevents #endthecowardpunch #thechantoozies #charityfundraising #fundraisingforacause"
