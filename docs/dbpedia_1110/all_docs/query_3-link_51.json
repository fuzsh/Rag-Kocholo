        "text": "Black Water Theatre Company’s debut production of The Boys by Gordon Graham certainly packs a wallop.\n\nMost Australians are familiar with the infamous rape and murder of Anita Cobby in 1986. This play is a fictionalised account of the events prior and the subsequent aftermath. Previously adapted for the screen in 1998, as a film starring David Wenham and Toni Collette, the play focuses on the psychological impact of the crime – not on the perpetrators, but on the women in their lives – and also explores the effect that social class can have in perpetuating violence.\n\nOn a surface level, the play is disturbing and confronting. The subject of murder and rape is never an easy topic to deal with, particularly in a theatre setting. However, beneath the harsh surface, there beats a heart of emotion and empathy.\n\nThe empathy comes from the aftermath of the crime, and the effect that it has on the wider community. The real victims are the people left behind after the bloody deed. The emotional aftershocks felt by the family of these men go far beyond just the initial impact caused by the shock of realising that their loved ones could commit such an atrocious crime.\n\nThis is all handled skilfully by an expert cast and the masterful direction of Peter Blackburn. The cast, led by James Monarski as our antagonist, Brett Sprague, and Ally Fowler (notable for her singing career in the Chantoozies) who plays the matriarch Sandra with care and dignity, are supported by an ensemble cast of experienced actors who have all appeared on either TV or the professional stage. This experience ensures that the two hours of the play moves by at a cracking pace, with barely a moment to breathe as the tension builds towards the climax of the story.\n\nEach of the cast have their moments to shine and there are no weak links here. All bring a focus to the harrowing story and balance the difficult subject matter with some lighter moments. It is impossible to single out one specific performance, as each member of the cast put in a stellar team effort.\n\nThe emotional pay off at the end is worthwhile. Eventually, despite all of the hardship, it is the women who endure and their lives will continue, provided they support one another.\n\nThe reality of their situation hits home very early on in the evening with an introduction from the White Ribbon Foundation, who stand against violence toward women. It should be noted that proceeds from the ticket sales are going towards the White Ribbon Foundation.\n\nIf you like your theatre gritty, challenging and ultimately rewarding, then make sure you go and see The Boys.\n\nRating: 4 stars out of 5\n\nBlack Water Theatre Company present\n\nThe Boys\n\nBy Gordon Graham\n\nDirected by Peter Blackburn\n\nCast: Ally Fowler, Laura Wheelwright, Sarah Grace, Brooke Aust, James Monarski, Lee Beckhurst and Dylan Watson\n\nRevolt Productions, Kensington"
