        "text": "September 9 to 11\n\nLocal sounds are set to sound off at this year's Festival of Food and Wine at the Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers with nine local performers announced for the three-day celebration of music, flowers and flavour, with more still to come.\n\nCardboard Cutouts, Flamingo Blonde, Jasmine Aleisha, Kane Maher, The Van Trio, The Hobsons, Lenna Maree Moxey Duo, The Fibonacci Band and Cool Nights Big Band are the locals set to perform alongside Iconic Australian band The Whitlams, who will perform their Eternal Nightcap album, Vera Blue, Ash Grunwald, The Chantoozies and more!\n\n\"It's with great excitement we announce the local line-up for the Festival of Food and Wine, to be held from September 9 to 11 in Queens Park, celebrating the best in Australian and local music and of course, local regional produce,\" Toowoomba Regional Council Environment and Community Services Committee Chair Cr James O'Shea said. \"This year we're excited to welcome music makers who have created some of our country's biggest anthems, as well as standout and emerging local musicians, in a wonderful three days of incredible flavours, produce and wine.\"\n\nOn the Main Stage on Friday 9 September, Cardboard Cutouts will open the weekend's festivities. During their high school years, these Toowoomba boys, also known as the 'Cardie Cuts', got together and started 'blowing the roof off their High School Hall for a few kids in plastic chairs'. They recorded their first EP and single 'Good Times' last year and members Eliot Argus (vocals and guitar), Jackson Broom (vocals and the bass), Campbell Patterson (vocals and guitar), and Rohan Parker (drums) are set to rock the stage.\n\nFollowing their performance another local talent James Bartlett, who goes by the name Flamingo Blonde, takes over. His three singles – 'On Your Side,' 'Picture Me Gone,' and 'Hotel Gloria' – have been described by Triple J Unearthed as resonating \"with the sound of fresh humid sunshine and cool summer nights\".\n\nThe young talent with tongue-in-cheek music taste has supported the likes of Hope D, Noah Dillon, Jaguar Jonze and Sweater Curse and his skilful and unmatched song writing has found him working with US-based Grammy-winning engineer Steve Fallone! From then on, it's national names Greta Stanley, Jarryd James and Vera Blue.\n\nSaturday sounds very Toowoomba with local performer – Jasmine Aleisha duo style (IMAGE ATTACHED). Jasmine describes her music performances as covering blues, soul and jazz. She made her Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers debut last year and is looking forward to performing again in 2022.\n\nNext up, it's 25-year music maker, local singer and guitarist Kane Maher, followed by The Van Trio – three local guys with a love for playing covers. Then it's The Hobsons, with their groovy melodies before Beccy and the Jets, INSXIVE – The INXS Tribute Show, The Chantoozies and Pseudo Echo!\n\nOn Sunday 11 September, local vocal and instrumental tutor and performer Lenna Maree Moxey opens before The Fibonacci Band bring their vibrant sounds and extensive genres to life. Wrapping up the local talent showcase will be Cool Nights Big Band, specialists in Jazz, Pop, Rock, and Swing. Closing Festival is Austin Mackay, Emily Wurramara, Ash Grunwald and The Whitlams with their Eternal Nightcap 25 Year Concert. It's a music line-up for the ages!\n\nFestival of Food and Wine at the Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers:\n\nFriday 9 September from 3pm to 10pm\n\nCardboard Cutouts\n\nFlamingo Blonde\n\nGreta Stanley\n\nJarryd James\n\nVera Blue\n\nSaturday 10 September from 10am to 10pm\n\nJasmine Aleisha Duo\n\nKane Maher\n\nVan Lil Trio\n\nThe Hobsons\n\nBeccy and the Jets\n\nINSXIVE – INXS Tribute Show\n\nThe Chantoozies\n\nPseudo Echo\n\nSunday 11 September from 10am to 9pm\n\nLenna Maree Moxey Duo\n\nThe Fibonacci Band\n\nCool Nights Big Band\n\nAustin Mackay\n\nEmily Wurramara\n\nAsh Grunwald\n\nThe Whitlams Eternal Nightcap 25 Year Concert\n\nIn addition to the knockout musical line-up, the Festival of Food and Wine will feature the exclusive Botanical Society area, The Tasting Room bar, Farm to Fork Demonstrations, beer and cocktail bars, the BBQ Pityard, and more than 35 food and wine stalls.
