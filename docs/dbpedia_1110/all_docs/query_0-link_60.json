        "text": "Ring in the new year with a blast from the past as The Chantoozies count down to 2014.\n\nOne of Australia’s best known ’80s pop bands, The Chantoozies feature a bevy of on-stage talent who were also well known for their on-screen roles.\n\nBand members Tottie Goldsmith, Eve von Bibra, Angie La Bozzetta and Ally Fowler sold more than 300,000 records, breaking through with the self-titled Chantoozies and following up with Gild the Lily.\n\nHit singles included Witch Queen, He’s Gonna Step On You Again, Wanna Be Up and Kiss and Tell.\n\nThe Chantoozies will be joined on the night by Melbourne tribute band Party Girls, delivering hits from Madonna, Cher, Pat Benatar, Tina Turner, the Bangles and the Go-Gos as well as ABBA and Suzie Quatro.\n\nTheir high-energy show includes costume changes, big wigs, cheesy choreography and audience participation. Doors open at 8pm."
