        "text": "Fans of ’80s and ’90s pop had better get their dancing shoes on – The Chantoozies are coming to town.\n\nThe Chantoozies – a pop group currently featuring Tottie Goldsmith, Eve von Bibra and Ally Fowler – will perform a special show at WestWaters Hotel to raise funds for charity TLC For Kids, with Ms Goldsmith telling patrons to prepare for a fun night.\n\n“The Chantoozies, we’re nuts,” she said.\n\n“You better have your dancing shoes on because we have so much fun on stage and that energy goes right back out into the audience. I guarantee it will be a fun night.”\n\nThe Chantoozies rose to prominence in the late ’80s and early ’90s with hits such as ‘Witch Queen’, ‘Wanna Be Up’ and ‘Love the One You’re With’, before the members embarked on solo careers and acting.\n\nThey returned in 2013, and Ms Goldsmith said their friendship was what had kept them coming back to perform together more than 30 years after their first gig.\n\n“The ’80s and ’90s had the best music ever, so to keep that vibrancy going and remind people about that time is a lot of fun.”\n\nTLC For Kids is a childrens charity that helps families deal with the challenges of everyday life while dealing with an illness.\n\nChief executive Tim Conolan said events like this made a big difference to the services that they could provide to families in need.\n\n“These sort of events help us keep going,” he said.\n\nThe event at the WestWaters Hotel and Entertainment Complex, Caroline Springs begins 6.30pm, Saturday February 18."
