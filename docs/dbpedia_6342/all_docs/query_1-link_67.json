        "text": "Martin Scorsese’s version of “Cape Fear” had its moments, but overall was something of a chaotic picture. Its “satire” (or lack thereof) didn’t really have a point, and its over-the-top visuals seemed to be compensating for a lack of content. It seemed less like Scorsese and more like DePalma.\n\nThompson’s original is better – more scary, more thrilling, more diabolical and realistic. Whereas De Niro’s scenery-chewing performance in the remake was almost laughable, Robert Mitchum’s spine-tingling turn here as Max Cady is one of the great human movie monsters – he’s a demon at spirit, no in physicality.\n\nHe seeks revenge on Gregory Peck and his family after Peck puts him away in jail for a few years.\n\nScorsese’s version was more updated and in that sense its general themes were more believable – Cady’s psyche was more exposed, his violence exploitative – and the romance between Cady and Sam Bowden’s daughter in the original is nonexistent. In fact, the extent of his harm towards her is when he chases her around an empty school.\n\nStill, this is a better version of the movie because it has more strengths than the remake. Visually it’s not as impressive but it makes more of an impact as a thriller.\n\nMore than just creepy\n\nAuthor: Spleen from Canberra, Australia\n\n4 August 1999\n\nFor the first time Hitchcock was decisively beaten at his own game. This is one of the tensest films ever made, and also one of the most perfectly crafted. There are so many things right about it I can afford to concentrate on just two:\n\n(1) Sam Bowden is a firm believer in the sanctity of civil liberties until Cady starts to stalk his family – and he remains a believer even then. He is asked if he really wants the police to have the power to arrest citizens on suspicion alone; and, although his family is in danger, he cannot honestly answer yes. `Cape Fear’ is clearly the product of a less bloodthirsty age. But it is the better for it: a clash between deeply held principles and deeply held desires isn’t at all interesting unless it really IS a clash – unless the principles are strong enough not to give way at the first breath of wind. And damn it, Bowden is right. The police do NOT have the right to arrest Cady. The potential tragedy is genuine: not something that could be cleaned up if only so-and-so would drop a few pointless scruples.\n\n(2) Robert Mitchum really alarms us. I think it’s because his motivations are a little, but not entirely, opaque. When we first see him eyeing Bowden’s teen-aged daughter, we don’t know exactly what he’s thinking any more than Sam does. Is he sexually attracted to her? Does he want to kill her? Rape her? Is he indifferent but just trying to get a rise out of Sam? Indeed: what, exactly, does he want to do to Sam himself? We don’t know: and this uncertainty is worse than any precise knowledge.\n\nI doubt I’ve said enough. `Cape Fear’ is riveting from first frame to last. It’s well shot, the acting is excellent, and Bernard Herrmann gives us his usual fitting score. It appeals to the intellect as much as to the pit of the stomach. Great stuff.\n\nStick With This One: The Original\n\nAuthor: ccthemovieman-1 from United States\n\n25 April 2006\n\nBoy, this shows that you can still make a scary movie without a lot of blood, profanity and whatever. Hollywood didn’t learn that, however, featuring all of it less than a decade after this was made. The Martin Scorcese re-make of this movie is exactly what I’m talking about.\n\nThis original Cape Fear was legitimately scary, thanks to the performance of Robert Mitchum, who doesn’t need to resort to the f-word to be a tough, sick and really an evil character as he stalks Gregory Peck and his wife (Polly Bergen) and daughter (Lori Martin).\n\nBergan and Martin are two women I don’t see too much in films which is too bad. They did a lot more TV work than movies. Another thing you don’t see much anymore – a nice, sympathetic policeman – was also portrayed in here nicely by Martin Balsam.\n\nThe ending has some holes in it, to be sure, but overall it offers a good 106- minute suspense story.\n\nEffective and somewhat ahead of it’s time\n\nAuthor: SmileysWorld from United States\n\n6 July 2002\n\nThere’s nothing worse than a con who knows his way around the law,and exploits that knowledge to the hilt.Robert Mitchum does this very expertly in the original and best version of Cape Fear.You want to reach out and strangle him,but he is within the law,so you can’t.This is the appeal of this film.It’s the fuel that keeps it going from start to finish.Along with Mitchum,we have Gregory Peck as the tormented lawyer who sent Mitchum’s character,Max Cady to jail for rape years earlier.\n\nHaving studied law while behind bars,Cady’s only intent with his gathering of this knowledge,is to torment Sam Bowden(Peck) and his family.It all leads to a classic finish.I truly believe that this film was a precursor to the thriller films of today.It was a sign of things to come in the cinematic world.It was way ahead of it’s time.Worthy of note here is Robert Mitchum’s ability to improvise almost to the point of becoming his character.The scene where he cracks the egg with his bare hand was not scripted,and the look of surprise on Polly Bergen’s face was indeed real.Outstanding film.\n\nCritical response\n\nUpon its release, the film received positive but cautious feedback from critics due to the film’s content. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 95% of 20 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.6 out of 10.\n\nBosley Crowther of the New York Times praised the “tough, tight script”, as well as the film’s “steady and starkly sinister style.” He went on to conclude his review by saying, “this is really one of those shockers that provokes disgust and regret.” The entertainment-trade magazine Variety reviewed the film as “competent and visually polished”, while commenting on Mitchum’s performance as a “menacing omnipresence\n\nI thought this movie was fabulous. It is a woman’s picture, but the tag line made it seem like some William Castle horror flick. By no stretch of the imagination is this a silly little weepy. Parts of it seem to be designed to disturb (the typewriter scene), and even the tender moments are edgy to me. (I just used the word “tender” in a sentence. Kill me now.)\n\nJoan Crawford (one of my favorites) plays Millicent Weatherby, a 40ish spinster who spent most of her life taking care of her invalid father and bemoaning her ridiculous name. Score one for Joan already, as she was not 40ish, but 50ish. Cliff Robertson (I tell everyone “Uncle Ben” from “Spiderman”) is the 20ish fella she meets in a restaurant. I think he was 20ish, but score one for him too; he’s adorable. Cliff hides some horrible secret, and he’s a major liar, but Joan falls for him anyway. He takes her to the beach, where they make out in the sand. (I love it when the surf comes crashing up against Joan and boy! does she flinch. Must have been chilly out that day.) They trot off to Mexico and get hitched. Then Joan starts to realize that maybe she doesn’t know Cliff as well as she thought she did. He lies and then tells the truth, and who’s to know the difference? Even he doesn’t. Eventually Cliff’s relatives get involved and then things get really sticky. Is Joan out to get Cliff? Tune in to the next episode to find out!!! Seriously, I felt for Joan.\n\nVera Miles\n\nShe had a rough time. First the invalid father that caused her to lose all contact with the outside world, and then this guy who can’t get his lies straight. Oh, but she manages beautifully. At this point in her career, Joan believed that acting and hand gestures didn’t have to go together. You sometimes begin to wonder if her arms even function. (I suspect this was a jab at the arm-flailing Bette Davis, but that’s just a hunch.) Just watching her stand there, all broad-shouldered and strong, makes you realize that of course she is going to get through. Former chorus girls always do, because they’ve got guts and know how. Best moment–after Joan decides she’s no good for Cliff, she goes back to that aforementioned beach and just sits there. It’s a lovely shot, and Joan looks less ironclad than usual.\n\nBy the by, a note to the other reviewer whose name I can’t remember. Joan Crawford would not DARE say “And you, YA slut.” She says, very precisely, “And you, YOU slut.” Enunciation was very important to the Texas-born Lucille LeSueur/Joan Crawford. Bette Davis might say “ya slut,” but never Joan Crawford.\n\nSuperb Aldrich melodrama.\n\nAuthor: benjulia from Kilmarnock, Scotland\n\n4 July 2003\n\nFine performances from Joan Crawford and Cliff Robertson give this taught drama more emotional resonance than might be expected from the plot summary. Crawford is superb – all huge eyes and trembling lips, she makes the relationship with Robertson’s character believable and moving. The tentative start to the relationship is especially effective.\n\nBurt Hanson’s mental deterioration is quite graphically portrayed and at one point, I have to admit, I was peering through my fingers at the screen. It was purely by chance that I stumbled across this movie on late night television. Despite being a fan of classic movies all my life, I had never heard of this one and I have to say that I’m surprised. It deserves to be better known.\n\nAutumn leaves, but Joan refuses to!\n\nAuthor: Poseidon-3 from Cincinnati, OH\n\n8 August 2007\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nAnd they thought Tammy Wynette stood by HER man! Crawford plays a lonesome, single typist who works from home, her peak years behind her after devoting herself to the care-giving of her ill father. One day, she attends the symphony and goes out to dinner afterwards, attracting the attention of Robertson, a friendly, and noticeably younger, ex G.I. His dating habits include giving her flowers he picked out of her own yard and swimming past her in the ocean, leaving her to nearly drown or get knocked under by the surf! Eventually worn down by his affections, she agrees to wed him, but the honeymoon is barely over before the cracks in his facade begin to show. It turns out that he has a variety of psychological issues and is a pathological liar, to boot! Crawford, who’s already been in a state of angst over their age difference and her fear of commitment really gives the tear ducts a workout as Robertson becomes more and more unhinged.\n\nRuth Donnelly as Millie’s chatty landlady, Liz\n\nShe must decide how best to handle the situation and weigh whether or not it’s possible for them to remain together. Crawford has a very severe look in this film. An unflattering mannish haircut, thick eyebrows and her trademark huge eyes and lips help make her very intimidating in this film despite her sometimes-wimpy character. Some truly awful Jean Louis costumes don’t help (he dressed her for several films and rarely did her any favors) with incongruous Peter Pan collars, puff sleeves and tailoring that accentuates her very broad back. She imbues the role with plenty of emotion and passion, but occasionally crosses over into unintentional hilarity. One great moment, though, occurs when she gives Greene and Miles a royal tongue-lashing on the pathway to her apartment. This has to be one of the first instances of the use of the word “Slut!” in a major motion picture and Joan delivers it wondrously. Robertson has dark circles under his eyes, perhaps due to the fact that virtually every light bulb was aimed in one spot for Crawford to walk into, thus assuring that her face would be rid of any lines while the rest of her is shrouded in darkness or otherwise shaded! He has a few unconvincing moments in the film, but generally gives a good performance, aptly displaying the necessary charm mixed with imbalance and threat that the part calls for. Donnelly steals a few scenes as Crawford’s landlady and friend. Greene plays Robertson’s father, with no particular authenticity. If ever there should have been a star autobiography (yet there wasn’t!) it should have been Greene’s. He worked alongside Crawford, Turner, Gardner, Newman, McQueen and all those many, many guest stars on “Bonanza” and surely could have provided a juicy nugget or two (or twenty!) of gossip.\n\nLorne Greene\n\nMiles, looking very slim and chic, plays a former love of Robertson’s. Surprisingly, Crawford filmed her longest scene opposite Miles while looking like a haggard, unkempt pile of laundry while Miles was in a flattering white sun-dress. The film is entertaining to a point (when it isn’t mired down in just a few too many fretful scenes from Crawford or ruminating on a bunch of psychobabble) and director Aldrich uses some very creative and unusual camera angles. The title song was a huge, memorable hit. Crawford, who had dropped out of “From Here to Eternity” in a dispute over the costumes, is here permitted to have her own big, love-among-the-crashing-waves scene.\n\nSolid Treat for Crawford, Melodrama, 1950’s Film Fans\n\nAuthor: Christopher jones (fla_thunder@live.com) from South Florida\n\n23 March 2009\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nToday’s demand for ‘realistic’ dialog and ‘sensible’ plot lines would reduce “Autumn Leaves” to a campy B-film in the eyes of younger viewers. And that’s as sad as any aspect of the heartbreak experienced by Millicent, the love-starved heroine so ably played by a mature Joan Crawford. There’s much to be enjoyed in this often overlooked milestone of her career.\n\nThroughout her lengthy screen experience, Joan Crawford could deliver one character better than almost any other; the patient, suffering, noble woman desiring true and everlasting love- but seemingly forever denied it. I can think of younger actresses who might have played the role (Polly Bergen comes to mind), but I can’t imagine any actress better suited to the demands of the role.\n\nPhysically, this is the Crawford of Mommie Dearest. Her mature face now showing her age, and those trademark oversize eyebrows emphasizing every emotion. It’s interesting to note that this may have been a deliberate choice, as Joan looks significantly more youthful in 1963’s ‘The Caretakers’. I have to think that the director wanted to emphasize Millie’s ‘spinster’ characterization, and this was one way it was accomplished.\n\nOther IMDb reviewers have discounted the likelihood that Burt, the emotionally-troubled man who brings a chance for love to Millie, would be so attracted to her. I think that’s a bit unfair. Burt was looking for certain rewards of a romantic relationship that a younger woman could not possibly provide. Also, With little previous romantic experience, Millie was enjoying love for the first time, much as a young girl would, thus she responded in ways that were satisfying to both of them.\n\nToday’s liberated, self-confident female would not likely make the choices Millie does. Yet, there are countless modern, self-respecting, educated women who would. All for the sake of keeping a romance, or marriage, alive.\n\nMillie is no fool. I think it’s clear that she recognizes the likely pitfalls of a union with Burt. She isn’t blind to early clues of instability. Rather, she chooses consciously to ignore them; partly to enjoy the fruits of love so long denied her, and partly because she sees in Burt a partner who can be ‘fixed,’; made whole. They say love is blind, but Millie is not. She barges headlong, against her better judgment, into unknown dangers, all for the hope of love (and let’s remember this is a handsome, virile young man) and lust.\n\nWhen, early on, just as expected by the audience, her fragile world of marital bliss begins to unravel, Millie is not surprised. Likewise, the viewer is not justifiably angry with her character for being blind. She knew, really, what she was getting into. She just didn’t know the specific details. She learns them quickly.\n\nMillie is the proverbial ‘stand by your man’ type of gal. Long after she is made aware of Burt’s mountain of lies and deception, her strongest instinct is not to flee, but to uncover the reasons that he lives in a fantasy world and change them. She is particularly noble in this regard when, at a certain point, she’s done all she can to get Burt help, and doesn’t expect to receive the lifetime of love and romance to which she once believed he held the key. It is enough that Burt may be ‘whole’ and happy.\n\nBut will Burt escape his torment and delusions and result in a man ready and willing to be a husband to Millie? Did he ever really love her? That is a question that seems to be answered in the final, emotionally satisfying scene\n\n“You can’t breathe and swim at the same time”\n\nAuthor: Steffi_P from Ruritania\n\n21 May 2010\n\nSometimes in Hollywood, motion picture style seemed to come about just through force of habit. Film noir was never recognised as a genre in its own era, but there was a time in the 1950s when it seemed every low budget drama was automatically shot in that stark, eerie, chiaroscuro fashion – regardless of how “noir”-ish it really was.\n\nAutumn Leaves, in some ways, IS quite a grim little melodrama. Many of the most pessimistic pictures of the 40s and 50s dealt with the romance-gone-wrong scenario, where one partner turns out to be not what they claimed they were – check out the excellent Scarlet Street (1945) for the cruellest example thereof. But Autumn Leaves is different. This isn’t a nightmarish “what if?” thriller – it has too much respect for its characters to be that. It is more a bittersweet and, at times, very mature look at how insanity and mental trauma can impact upon human relationships. Above all it is a romantic picture from its first frame to its last.\n\nAnd yet, director Robert Aldrich insists upon giving it the noir makeover with his usual penchant for slanting shadows, odd camera angles and foreground clutter, all of which is hardly necessary and just a little tiresome. Still, to his credit, this hard-boiled action director does find room for a more tender, person-centred approach, with some long takes and clarity of image in key scenes. There are also some truly wonderful subtleties to watch out for. For example when Joan Crawford fails to answer Cliff Robertson’s proposal, we cut from close-up to mid-shot, where in the background a receptionist puts down a phone – a little note of rejection that we will subconsciously pick up on.\n\nCrawford and Robertson at least seem to understand what this picture is about. You can see how good an actress Crawford was by reading up on the kind of abusive and maladjusted person she was in real life. She gives a totally believable presentation of someone with absolute loving purity and patience, and her character’s devotion to Robertson’s gives the picture its emotional weight. Robertson, in his earliest lead role, demonstrates that combination of warmth and endearing frailty which characterises his most memorable roles, without ever quite descending into a corny caricature.\n\nSpeaking of corniness, Autumn Leaves is not without its slightly cringeworthy moments. There is the overly extravagant musical score, including a fuzzy blur as we segue into a flashback. There is the somewhat trite peachiness with which Crawford and Robertson’s romance unfolds. There is even a barefaced rip-off of the beach scene out of From Here to Eternity. But to be honest, all of this adds to its charm. Autumn Leaves is, in many ways, the opposite of film noir cynicism. It shows people struggling to make romance work in spite of the desperation of their circumstances.\n\nThis little known 1955 melodramatic gem starring Joan Crawford, Barry Sullivan, Betsy Palmer, John Ireland, Lucy Marlow is not only incredibly over-dramatic (sometimes hilariously so) but a great opportunity for Joan Crawford to show off her inner diva and those great acting skills of hers.\n\nEmotions run high as ruthless Southern socialite Eva Phillips (the Queen Bee – played by else but the magnificent Joan Crawford who is absolutely in her element) manipulates those around her, turning them against each other. The story begins when her sappy cousin (badly played by Lucy Marlow – you are almost happy when she gets slapped) arrives at Eva’s mansion and boy, is she in for one wild ride! Affairs, suicide, car accidents, love, manipulation all drive this movie.\n\nIt is such a pleasure to watch Eva Phillips tear people apart and see the cunning ways in which she works and gets her own way. The script is, as I previously said, insanely dramatic (and sometimes the lines aren’t delivered well – bad acting) and sometimes it got very funny as it just seemed really pathetic. That doesn’t mean I didn’t enjoy it though – no, I loved every minute of it. I loved Eva Phillip’s ability to torment the people around her (for example – calling her drunk, scarred husband ‘Beauty’) – it was incredibly fascinating to me. And the ending was very rewarding too.\n\nUndoubtly over-the-top to the point of laughing, but a very entertaining ride perfect for a day in. I enjoyed every minute of it, I thoroughly recommend it to comedy and drama fans alike – both could get some enjoyment out of this.\n\nA very, very Crawford movie\n\nAuthor: verna55 from cincinnati, ohio\n\n26 September 2000\n\nMaybe I’m going out on a limb here, but having seen a great many of her movies, I would say that Joan Crawford was at her bitchiest in this picture. That is to say, bitchier than usual! She tears at the scenery, she tears at the script, and brother I feel sorry for her co-stars, because even though they are also a talented group, they of course don’t stand a chance when Crawford’s on the screen, which is basically every scene. Although her character doesn’t appear right away, it’s still obvious from the very start that this is a very, very Crawford movie.\n\nThe film just instantaneously gives off that omen. The gist of the story is this: Crawford is a glamorous socialite who dominates her Southern family and takes great pride in doing so. Yes, we’ve seen Crawford play this type of role before(HARRIETT CRAIG), but I personally never tire of seeing Crawford getting the upper hand. Though they didn’t get along too well in real life, Joan Crawford and Bette Davis had much in common when it came to choice of movie scripts. They both specialized in playing catty, indomitable females, and they both clearly relished doing so. Crawford is at her best in this one. Sure, the script isn’t the greatest she’s been given, and frankly it’s pretty sleazy stuff, but Crawford does wonders with it and manages to turn in her finest performance. She clearly works at the part and isn’t simply clawing and nailing at everyone around her. Even though her character is an absolute horror of a human being, Crawford does her best to make her a sympathetic one, and she just about pulls it off! Some people will discard this one as pure camp, but this is a movie that serious Joan Crawford fans like myself will treasure, and no doubt watch over and over again. Terrific!!!!!\n\nOh MY God!\n\nAuthor: thedavid01 from San Francisco, California\n\n4 February 2007\n\nFrom frame one, she is EVIL! I totally cracked up because everyone else is dressed and lit adequately,but in each shot, each frig-gin’ shot, Joan is in fantastic gowns, jewels, lit fabulously and with just that HINT of gauze, Vaseline over the lens. Same year as Female on the Beach. Go Joan! She chews through scenery like a wood chipper. However her character, originally from Chicago, is intimidated by a southern family..I don’t think so. I realized she is the prototype of characters like Glenn Close in “Fatal Attraction”. The scene where she dares her husband to divorce her is shark-like.Glamorous from start to finish.And poor Betsy Palmer….\n\nWelcome to Hell\n\nAuthor: J B Thackery from Atlanta\n\n3 February 2007\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nI could rave about the fantastic acting and directing. But every scene is like waking up in a real Hades. I mean, these people seem locked into the never-ending strain of having to live with each other, and even worse, with themselves.\n\nI disagree with another posted comment which said none of the acting was good except for Joan Crawford. They were all superbly on cue, dynamically intertwined, and their interactions were so genuine I kept thinking I was in the room with these miserable rich people.\n\nI kept getting ulcers, and feeling angry, depressed, or panicky with each character interaction. Now and then the sweet-natured visiting cousin, Jenifer, offers a fresh breeze of hope, but wow, how she gets caught up in their poisonous existence. You never know if she is going to save this wretched family, or destroy them; you can’t quite figure what she is about.\n\nThere is plenty of movement, dynamic interplay, psychological warfare and symbolism, and smooth continuity. Every actor surprises you with revelations of their inner selves which they are not afraid to expose, which in every scene stirs up more conflict to work out.\n\nI also slightly disagree with the posted comment that the ending was tacked on. In a way it could seem so, but the events leading up to it keep you wondering… was the freshly budding resolution of all their sorrows real? Or just a lot of fake premise that never got to full light? We will never know. But after seeing this otherwise well produced movie,I am determined to live as good a life as I can, if this is what Hell is like! And these poor people are in Hell.\n\nLong Live the Queen.\n\nAuthor: Jamie Moffat (jamie_moffat@hotmail.com) from Melbourne, Australia\n\n10 March 2000\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\n“This won’t do at all” sniffs Joan Crawford, surveying a particularly glum cocktail party in her mouldering Southern mansion. “I like my admirers to be gay and laughing.”\n\nI strongly suspect that they’re both, Joan, but you don’t have to be gay to find this one a riot. Here is a film so camp that even Anita Bryant would have a hard time suppressing a smirk.\n\nThe plot reads like a bad parody of the sort of thing used to do the thirties, which in itself was a bad parody of the better stuff that Garbo and Shearer did. Mega bitch Crawford stomps around her l’il ol’ plantation with more petticoats and more starch than was expended on the entire cast of “Gone With the Wind.” She tosses off faux-bitchy comments to anyone who’ll listen – “My you look nice, even in those tacky riding clothes” – yet nobody tells the old cow to put a sock in it. Enter a sweet young thing, recently orphaned, and Crawford kicks into high gear, plotting, plotting, plotting.\n\nSince Crawford’s character exists for no other reason than to make everybody else feel atrocious, its just as well that the rest of the cast are such a gormless bunch. When Crawford asks “Do I look fairly human?” nobody offers the obvious rejoinder. When she pushes a younger rival to suicide, nobody dobs her in to the inevitable inquest. Its left to her long suffering husband to polish her off in a car accident in a gender reversed scene from Bette Davis’ “Dangerous”, and not a minute too soon.\n\nAll of the actors seem too awestruck by the antics of the star to register much on screen. Fay Wray has a nice cameo early in the piece as a Blanche du Bois wannabe, a faded victim of Joan’s treachery. But we all know its Joan who’s really bonkers.\n\nA special mention to Joan’s gowns, which are a show in themselves. I particularly liked the hang glider affair that she wears at the afore mentioned cocktail party. But my hat really goes off to the one that looks a bit like a moulting Christmas tree.\n\nWhatever Happened to Mildred Pierce?\n\nAuthor: billpappas-1 from United States\n\n19 April 2010\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nOh, Joan, That hairdo, those eyebrows, hide the children. Someone said she looked like she was wearing ‘warrior makeup’. But, we love ya, Joan when you’re as bad as you can be. This was before the Joker in the Batman movies.\n\nOther reviewers have already laid out the plot but there are a few scenes that simply delight me. There’s the one where a seated John Ireland has a telephone cord gently wrapped around his neck by Joan while she’s on the phone.\n\nIn another scene, she is talking to her young niece or whoever she is while semi-reclining on the sofa. Meanwhile Joan has her leg elevated admiring it and pointing her foot in her high heel shoe, somewhat distracted by its shapeliness, I guess.\n\nThen, while the young woman and Betsy Palmer are on the floor looking at blueprints of the house Betsy will live in, they don’t hear Joan enter till you see her high heel shoe with its ankle strap stepping on the blueprints and ruining their fun.\n\nAnother delightful moment is when Barry Sullivan, ‘Beauty’ is in his office pacing in front of his desk where Joan is seated out of camera range while he is trying to tell her he wants a divorce. It’s a heavy, serious scene. The camera pans over to Joan who is admiring herself in her compact make up mirror in a wonderfully blasé, Joan Crawford way.\n\nThese little moments are worth sitting through some of the tedious plot development. There is one scene where Barry Sullivan is having a long dialog with John Ireland in Sullivan’s bedroom while he is dressing for a formal dinner. The dialog is one long shot while Sullivan is tying his bow tie, something we don’t see in today’s movies with all the quick edits. Today’s actors don’t seem to be able to do a long scene without cuts like in these old movies.\n\nI guess Joan didn’t mind playing a character that was so nasty that the audience cheered her demise at the end of the film.\n\n5 years after “Mildred Pierce” and Joan Crawford is at it again. Again, she is poor and is willing to climb to the top no matter what. In this film, she becomes involved with organized crime and becomes a real pro in being used to infiltrate other wayward mobsters.\n\nFrom poverty to that Mildred Pierce mink, Crawford gave a truly memorable performance. She will stop at nothing to get to the top.\n\nAlong the way, she seduces timid accountant, played masterfully by Kent Smith, to join the mob only two realize that the two of them are trapped.\n\nAnother favorite co-star of Crawford, David Brian appears as the head mobster who is against violence but must come to grips with it when renegade hood, the always terrific Steve Cochran, seduces Crawford and then goes after her when he discovers that she is a Brian stooge.\n\nThis is a gripping film-noir at its best.\n\nCrackerjack Film Noir – Crawford at her best!\n\n2 October 2000\n\nI have to say that this is one of my very favorite films. A truly entertaining movie. Briefly, Joan Crawford plays a good woman who’s world is turned upside down by a tragic event. She decides to climb her way out of poverty by using everyone she comes in contact with and falling in with a lot of shady characters. She makes her way to a life of glamour and wealth, only to see it all fall apart when her bad karma comes back to haunt her. For all the Joan Crawford jokes – this is actually quite a good movie. The dialogue is crackling and all the actors are very good. Joan does not go over the top and gives a convincing portrayal of a woman who has lost her moral compass – but then regains it in the end. There are of course some melodramatic moments, but not too many. The production values are top notch – lots of location shooting – mainly in Palm Springs, to really get you into the setting of the film.\n\nI would classify this film as a film noir – it starts out as who-done-it and features noir stalwart Steve Cochran. If you are looking for an entertaining flick – you can’t go wrong with this one!\n\nVery Nice-Looking Noir-Melodrama\n\nAuthor: ccthemovieman-1 from United States\n\n24 January 2006\n\nFor me, the best part about this film was the exceptional lighting which made this a great movie to see on DVD. The great black-and-white photography reminded of films like The Sweet Smell Of Success and To Kill A Mockingbird. The camera-work in this movie does not take a backseat to those great films, believe me.\n\nStory-wise, it’s a somewhat-familiar Joan Crawford movie with a bit more emphasis on the melodrama than the film noir, a la Mildred Pierce. That’s a compliment because “Mildred” was a well-crafted story and so is this. It’s an effective mixture of drama and noir. However, unlike “Mildred,” this Crawford character (“Ethel” aka “Mrs. Forvbes”) has a worldly edge to her with a chip on her big shoulders. It’s tough to sympathize with her in this story, frankly.\n\nKent Smith plays her naive, wimpy dupe for much of the film but when David Brian enters the scene, the movie really picks up. Gangster Brian is nobody’s patsy and he’s fascinating, portraying the most intense character in the story.\n\nThis is another one of the fine classic movies that never got a VHS showing but finally got a break with a recent DVD release, which is all the better since the camera-work is deserving of the nice look this transfer gives it. Once more, another impressive movie from 1950, one of the better years Hollywood ever had.\n\nLoose reworking of the Bugsy Siegel-Virginia Hill affair\n\nAuthor: blanche-2 from United States\n\n24 October 2007\n\nJoan Crawford revitalized a flagging career when she left MGM and signed with Warner Brothers in the ’40s. “The Damned Don’t Cry” is just one of the very entertaining films she made for Warners, which include “Mildred Pierce,” for which she won an Oscar and “Flamingo Road.” The formula usually follows the rags to riches line, something Crawford was very good at indeed.\n\nHere, she’s Ethel Whitehead, a wife and mother of a young boy who dies in an accident, at which point Ethel takes off seeking money, nice things, and the fun she’s never had in life. She soon comes to the attention of a clothes manufacturer who has her model the clothes and encourage the buyers to spend their cash after hours. She rides the coattails of a bland CPA (Kent Smith) into the mob domain of George Castleman (David Brian), who gives her a life she only dreamed of – a society name, expensive digs, great trips, clothes and jewels – and no ring on third finger, left hand. Not that anyone has mentioned if she divorced her first husband (Richard Egan). Castleman, suspicious of Nick Prenta (Steve Cochran) who runs his western territory sends Ethel – now “Lorna Hanson Forbes” out to investigate and inveigle her way into Prenta’s life to find out what he’s planning. It’s then that “Lorna” realizes she’s just another thing that Castleman uses.\n\nThis is a slick, fast-moving noir that is basically all Joan all the time. Surrounded by a strong cast, she’s the only real star, and she looks it in her beautiful clothes and jewels. She’s at her glamorous best here in 1950, right before she hardened into almost a caricature of herself in the ’50s and ’60s. I can’t agree that Crawford’s age (46) gets in the way and that Ava Gardner would have been better. Ethel/Lorna is the type of role at which Joan excelled. It was believable, to me at least, that these men were all attracted to her – her character has guts, intelligence, beauty and sexuality. David Brian is her brutish boyfriend, and the scene where he surprises her out west is quite violent, even by today’s standards. Steve Cochran is handsome, boyish, and thug-like as Prenta, and he comes on strong.\n\n“The Damned Don’t Cry” is directed with great spirit by Vincent Sherman and will keep the viewer involved throughout.\n\nThe Damned Don’t Cry – they just sweat it out in this stylish noir\n\nAuthor: Nick Zegarac (movieman-200) from Canada\n\n12 June 2005\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\n“The Damned Don’t Cry” (1950) is really six different Joan Crawford movies all rolled into one, with a moral ambiguity that must have left the censors blushing. It stars Crawford as Lorna Hansen Forbes, a socialite who has been leading a conflicted double life that is about to catch up to her. When the body of bad boy, Nick Prenta (Steve Cochran) turns up, Lorna’s romantic connection is immediately investigated by the police. However, not before Lorna vanishes into thin air. This disappearance does indeed present a grave problem for the investigation, because it seems that Lorna Hansen Forbes never existed before she met Nick Prenta.\n\nThe police’s confusion, of course, touches off a long flashback in which Lorna (previously known as Ethel Whitehead) is shown making the best of her impoverished marriage to Jim (Morris Ankrum) – an unhappy set of circumstances fraught with anti-climactic sterility. However, the marriage, like Ethel herself, is doomed to tragedy. With nothing more than self determination, Ethel/Lorna embarks upon a lucrative career as a back-stabbing, social climbing vixen. She uses men like disposable Kleenex to get where she wants to go. Eventually her bedroom prowess throws her into the arms of Nick, positioning Lorna as the lady behind a thug running one of the most notorious nationwide crime syndicates.\n\nDirector Vincent Sherman had his own notorious romantic goings on with Crawford while shooting this film and that hot blooded backstage tryst shows up on the screen. Both the actress and her performance have been oxygenated and primed to explode, with dilated twists and turns oozing from every facet of Gertrude Walker’s lurid screenplay. But for all its torrid sexiness and slippery sinful attitudes toward a woman’s ‘place’ in a world of ravenous male desire, “The Damned Don’t Cry” comes across as something of a convoluted cropper.\n\nIt’s initial film noir base is subverted in melodrama that dissolves into moments of subtle comedy, before bouncing into the sphere of over the top camp and kitsch. Though Crawford keeps all of these elements at bay, while central to her performance, she’s really been thrown into the deep end of the pool here so to speak, artistically compromised in a very inarticulate bit of business that has her doing everything but card tricks and standing on her head in a bikini – though there is little doubt she would have done even this if the screenplay had commanded it.\n\nAnother near perfect transfer from Warner Brothers greets on this DVD. Gray scale is finely wrought with detail, solid blacks, clean whites and a minimal amount of film grain. There’s no hint of edge enhancement for a very smooth picture that will surely please. The audio is mono as expected but very nicely cleaned up. Extras include a “Reel and Real” featurette analysis of the Crawford style of acting, as well as an audio commentary by director, Sherman – who really is more into raking smut about his star/lover than recollecting the film in a clinical and analytical way. Not that his commentary isn’t interesting. But it does tend to run more toward tabloid headlining than serious audio track.\n\nWatch Joan act!\n\nAuthor: Holdjerhorses from United States\n\n4 August 2005\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nLook. Let’s get this outta the way right now. Joan Crawford was a fine — even amazing — screen actress. She herself said she was terrified of acting in the theatre, on a stage. That’s not what she did, and she knew it.\n\nHere, in “The Damned Don’t Cry,” at age 46, she’s unafraid to show herself in minimal makeup as the mother of a young boy. Her character, “Ethel,” is supposed to look haggard and careworn. Joan does. But she plausibly passes as the mother of a six-year old boy.\n\nJoan Crawford can’t act? Really? Review her stunning reaction close-up as she watches her son get run over on his bicycle by a truck. A naked, warts-and-all close-up electrifying and heartbreaking in its raw emotion. Even today, as brief as it is, it’s almost hard to watch.\n\nThe rest of the cast is uniformly excellent — except for Sara Perry as Joan’s mother. She’s not “bad.” But among an intense cast of excellent, if not-quite-A-list actors, her line readings are exactly that — line readings.\n\nContrast Perry’s performance with Morris Ankrum’s as Joan’s father. In an instant — his first glimpse of his daughter, Joan, through the screen door — and in every subsequent scene, he forcefully establishes his character and develops it. Ankrum has little to do, throughout the film. Yet he’s so solid an actor that he continually exposes layers of the hard life, spent dreams and vestiges of a loving heart, of this man.\n\nKent Smith — utterly believable (and again, perfectly cast) as the noble but amorous accountant.\n\nDavid Brian — never better. Ten years younger than Miss Crawford (yes, he was only 36 when he filmed “The Damned Don’t Cry”), Brian was apparently born young middle-aged. He effectively looked the same in every screen appearance for over 40 years. Like Crawford, Brian often isn’t given credit for his acting chops. Though never given the opportunities to show his range, as was Crawford, Brian was never less than honest, on screen, compelling and dangerous.\n\nSteve Cochran? 13 years younger than Miss Crawford. 33, in other words, to Miss Crawford’s 46. Name a 46-year-old actress today who would dare appear on screen with a 33-year-old love interest.\n\nConvincingly.\n\nCochran is all male. You practically smell his armpits on the screen. Where are today’s equally testosteroned leading men? Uh, nowhere. Matthew Broderick? Jude Law? Colin Farrell? Are you kidding? Plus, Cochran can actually act.\n\nWatch his character arc from tough-guy hood, to clumsy suitor, to sensitive lover to betrayed patsy. Like Crawford, you love the guy, but you never quite trust him — never know when he might explode. Terrific! Selena Royle, another casting coup, embodies Patricia Longworth perfectly — from her first uncertainty as to the bloodstain on her carpet to her flashback scenes as a socially confident if venal leech.\n\nBut it’s Crawford’s picture from start to finish. (Weren’t they all?) Yes, Harold Medord’s script from Gertrude Walker’s story is melodramatic. So are real lives, sometimes.\n\nThis superlative cast makes almost everything work.\n\nExcept for the too-cute-by-half final lines, uttered by the journalists on the scene.\n\nThat moment, and every moment that Sara Perry is on screen as Joan’s mother, suddenly jerk us out of what almost feels like a documentary.\n\nA powerful documentary, thanks to a roster of actors whose likes we may never see again.\n\nCritical response\n\nWhen the film was released, the review was mixed, even though the box office was considered good. The New York Times film critic, Bosley Crowther, was tough on the film in his review. He wrote, “Miss Crawford as the ‘fancy lady’ runs through the whole routine of cheap motion-picture dramatics in her latter-day hard-boiled, dead-pan style … A more artificial lot of acting could hardly be achieved” He added, “And Kent Smith, as a public accountant whom Miss Crawford lures into the syndicate, plays a Milquetoast so completely that his whole performance seems a succession of timid gulps. Steve Cochran as a tricky West Coast mobster and Selena Royle as a cagrant socialite do their jobs in a conventional B-story, A-budget way. Vincent Sherman’s direction is as specious as the script.”\n\nModern critics are generally more sympathetic. James Travers in 2012 said: “It is not hard to account for the popular appeal of The Damned Don’t Cry. The plot may be far-fetched and the characters absurdly exaggerated, but the film is otherwise well-constructed (using the familiar film noir device of the extended flashback) and well-performed by a well-chosen ensemble of acting talent.\n\nFilm critic Craig Butler called the film “a ridiculous melodrama that is fairly poor as real drama but is quite enjoyable as camp.” He added, “Damned starts out as if it were one of Crawford’s earlier ‘poor gal makes good’ flicks, but it quickly becomes lurid and unbelievable. As is often the case in her later vehicles, Damned finds Crawford in a one-dimensional world and asks that she find ways of giving the illusion of depth to her character.”\n\nCritic Dennis Schwartz liked the film, Crawford’s work and its direction. He wrote, “A dreary crime drama following the formula of Flamingo Road, which also starred Joan Crawford. It is efficiently directed by Vincent Sherman … Joan Crawford gives a solid performance as the gangster’s moll who discovers when it’s too late that she took the wrong path.”\n\nSlant magazine film critic, Jeremiah Kipp, said of the film, “The direction by hack Vincent Sherman is adequate and humble before Joan, though some scenes feel like the transition into the editing room was hardly smooth. (At least two insert shots feel wobbly and jarring.) But Crawford gets what she wants, and that’s all we really came for, no? Like the star in question, this diva showcase knows what it is and what it’s good at. If you don’t like it, why are you still here?”\n\nA lot of Joan Crawford titles are the actual characters she plays such as SADIE McKEE, LETTY LYNTON, MILDRED PIERCE, HARRIET CRAIG and this one. Made in 1947, two years after she won the Oscar for MILDRED and during a period where she was making some of her best films at Warners (she was loaned to Fox for this). However, this is one of the weaker ones during that time, but not a bad one. It’s a typical, glossy soap opera with Joan in a love triangle with married lawyer (Andrews) & soldier (Fonda). It’s rather predictable and drags towards the end, but Joan gives a good, solid performance. 2.5 out of 4.\n\nBut What Happened to Tubby?\n\nAuthor: David (Handlinghandel) from NY, NY\n\n8 September 2005\n\nIn the early scenes, Crawford has a dog that looks like a border collie. His name is Tubby and she appears to dote on him. Suddenly, he disappears.\n\nThat said, this is one of Crawford’s very best movie’s. Twentieth Century Fox, and Otto Preminger, did beautifully by her.\n\nSo many things to say …! It takes place in the neighborhood where I was born and still live. The Greenwich Theater, where Joan attends a movie, was a staple of Greenwich Village. When it was twinned it started showing less interesting things but it was still a landmark. Then it was torn down and in its place stands a health club.\n\nThe diner where Henry Fonda waits for Crawford while she’s at the movie is still there. The curtain in its window looks the same — almost 60 years later.\n\nCrawford and Dana Andrews make a somewhat unlikely torrid romantic duo. But they work well together. The same can be said for Crawford and Fonda. Their romance is a bit more implausible but, again, they are directed beautifully and advance the plot admirably.\n\nIn a sense, this is Fonda’s closest brush with film noir. He is a vet who has also lost his wife. The scene in which he thrashes around a nightmare is brilliantly staged. The background music there, as elsewhere, is excellent.\n\nMost of the characters speak in a sort of Henry Higgins manner. “Hurricane” is pronounced just as Eliza Doolittle was taught to say it: “hurricen.” Crawford always had that quality — “syew” for “sue,” “cahn’t” for “can’t.” But the movie withstands these petty issues. It’s exciting and it is beautifully cast. Ruth Warrick is superb in the small role of Andrews’s wife. Peggy Ann Garner is too, as one of his daughters. So is the girl playing his other daughter. And Crawford’s roommate, whose name I don’t recognize, is convincing as well.\n\nThis is one of the lesser known vehicles of all three of its stars and not one of Preminger’s better known, either. But it’s fascinating and deserves kudos for all concerned.\n\nA womans’ movie where the men are not dopes\n\nAuthor: rontaube from Twin Cities, Minnesota\n\n11 September 2002\n\nI liked this film a lot because it’s a rare movie where Joan Crawford doesn’t overshadow her male co-stars and here she is pitted up against two fine male actors who match her emotions and intelligence. Dana Andrews was never better stepping out from his usual good guy roles to play a heel with compassion. Mr Andrews acting is both subtle and emotinaly strong. Coming off his strong performance a year earlier in the Best Years of Our Lives he was clearly at his peak at this time. There is a lot going on in this film from suggestions of child abuse on the part of Ruth Warrick to an interesting spin on the theme of infidelity where the most sympathetic character is the “other” woman Daisy Kenyon. I can see why this role would have appealed to Ms. Crawford having played variotions on it in “The Women” and “Rain” among others throughout her career. She is the wise one here and it makes the movie very interesting for that reason. I won’t say who wins her in the end but it leaves a nice smile on your face and you have a little laugh to boot.\n\nLove triangle with rich noir shadows\n\nAuthor: imogensara_smith from New York City\n\n13 May 2008\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nThe Preminger Paradox has often been noted: Otto was a notorious tyrant on the set, but his films are like courtrooms in a good way. Everyone gets a fair hearing. The keynote of Preminger’s movies is moral ambiguity; they never turn on a simple axis of good and evil, and they feature few characters who are entirely sympathetic or unsympathetic. And despite his legendary tantrums, he consistently drew subtle, tamped-down performances from the actors he terrorized. DAISY KENYON displays all of these virtues and uses them to complicate what would otherwise be a conventional love-triangle plot. The film is impressive in its nuance, complexity and ambivalence. It’s not completely satisfying, but perhaps that’s the point. By the end, you realize that no possible outcome to the story can really be a happy ending.\n\nIt’s trite but tempting to say that this is a Joan Crawford movie for people who don’t like Joan Crawford. Despite her central, eponymous role, Crawford as Daisy is never as interesting as the two men in her life, Dan O’Mara (Dana Andrews) and Peter Lapham (Henry Fonda). Neither Andrews nor Fonda wanted to do the movie, presumably feeling that they would be playing second fiddles to the female star, but they outshine her. Crawford wanted desperately to do the movie, and it’s easy to see why: at 40-something she gets to play an attractive young career-woman being fought over by two very attractive men. (Some predicament! I guess that’s why they call this a “woman’s picture.”) However, girlish dresses with lace collars don’t make Crawford look any younger, and the shadowy lighting allegedly designed to hide her wrinkles only adds to the inappropriate sense that she might be about to reach for a carving knife. Crawford is great in MILDRED PIERCE, SUDDEN FEAR and POSSESSED, all made around the same time. Here she’s not only too old but too strong and too alarmingly intense for a character who should be softer and more likable.\n\nDaisy is a successful commercial artist involved with a married man. She loves him but knows it’s a dead-end relationship, so she agrees to marry another man whom she doesn’t love, but who needs her badly. This is pretty standard stuff, but in detail it’s oddly persuasive. Dan O’Mara is a glib, high-powered lawyer, spoiled and overconfident, a man who cheats on his wife and treats her with cold contempt. He’s a heel—and yet Dana Andrews makes him not only sexy but somehow sympathetic. (This was the third of four films Andrews made with Preminger, a quartet that gave him his best roles and made brilliant use of his gift for ambivalence.) Everything comes too easily for Dan; he knows he’s smarter than the people around him, and his charm is irresistible, despite his slick habit of calling everyone “honeybunch” and “dewdrop.” His daughters adore him, his secretaries adore him, maitre-d’s adore him. Then everything goes wrong: he loses the first case he ever really cared about (defending a Japanese veteran dispossessed of his land), he loses his daughters to divorce, and then he loses his mistress. The bleakness that comes out in his face feels like it was there all along, under the smirk. Dana Andrews had the most haunted eyes in Hollywood. Here they’re haunted by self-knowledge.\n\nPeter Lapham is a lonely, psychologically wounded veteran and widower. He’s gentle and low-key; his vocation as a yacht-designer hints at something graceful and fine in him. But there’s something creepy about him too; he declares his love for Daisy on their first date, then forgets to call her, then sets up surveillance and follows her home. “The world’s dead and everyone in it is dead except you,” he tells her unnervingly. Peter is obviously the more deserving man, but his method of pursuing Daisy is sneakily passive-aggressive, and they are never as convincing a couple as Daisy and Dan. You can’t tell up to the last minute which man she will end up with, or even which one you want her to end up with, which is the film’s triumph.\n\nDAISY KENYON has been released on DVD as part of Fox’s Film Noir series, which is misleading, but there is something hard to place about the film. The look is typical forties high-gloss (Daisy lives in a ridiculously palatial “Greenwich Village” apartment, which her lover refers to as a “hovel,” on an eerily deserted studio street), but the shadows are as dark as any noir. And there is an undercurrent of unpleasantness throughout the film—nightmares, child abuse, racism, adultery. This too is typical of Preminger, who did more than anyone to force Hollywood to grow up and face the facts of life. The shadows aren’t only in the cinematography; they don’t just fall across the characters but spread from inside them.\n\nReception\n\nReviews at its release were generally positive, if dismissive. Otto Preminger himself stated that he forgot he had made the film. Variety‘s review stated that the central “triangle, in which Dana Andrews and Henry Fonda fight it out for the love of Joan Crawford, is basically a shallow lending-library affair, but it’s made to seem important by the magnetic trio’s slick-smart backgrounds – plus, of course, excellent direction, sophisticated dialog, solid supporting cast and other flashy production values.” T. M. P. in the New York Times noted, “Miss Crawford is, of course, an old hand at being an emotionally confused and frustrated woman, and she plays the role with easy competence.” Otis L. Guernsey, Jr. in the New York Herald Tribune commented, “Preminger accomplishes no mean feat in guiding these people in and out among the interweavings of their own complexes, and he does wonders in varying the action of similar scenes.\n\nInitial dismissal of Daisy Kenyon has given way to some critical reappraisal in recent years; it has earned a cult following, with some calling it a misunderstood masterpiece and one of Preminger’s best films. Mike D’Angelo, giving the film a grade of 99 out of a possible 100 points, hailed Kenyon as “the most bluntly realistic romantic melodrama I’ve ever seen.” Dan Callahan of Slant Magazine, awarding Kenyon three and a half stars out of four, called the film a “troubling and ambiguous portrayal of three real, unknowable characters (and actors) in constant flux”, saying that the film “distilled [soap opera] to its real life essence, until what’s left is nothing more than the ultimate mystery of art.”Fernando Croce, giving the film four and a half stars out of five, called the film “a scrupulously cooled romance and a portrait of a postwar nation, but first and foremost… a fluid chart of thorny personal spaces brushing against each other.” Independent filmmaker Dan Sallitt voted for it as one of his ten favorite films in a 2012 Sight & Sound poll.\n\nDaisy Kenyon currently holds a 100% percentage rating on review aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.6/10, based on 5 reviews. Critics Roundup, a website that describes itself as “the first movie review aggregator to select reviews based on writing quality instead of popularity”, also reports that 100% of 12 critics reviewed the film positively.\n\nJust Ignore That Discombobulated Plot\n\nMany fans of this classic film are drawn to it because of Bogie and Bacall, who do indeed make a deft acting duo. Here, Bogie plays Philip Marlowe, the tough talking, street savvy PI, who has his roots in the crime novels of writer Raymond Chandler. Bacall plays Vivian Sternwood, the adult daughter of a wealthy man. Vivian is just as tough and cagey as Marlowe. And she has a younger sister named Carmen, who seems to have fallen in with a bad crowd. It’s up to Marlowe to investigate, and to save the Sternwood family from financial ruin. “The Big Sleep” is a story of blackmail, murder, multiple motives, lies, and all manner of general mayhem.\n\nHumphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall are certainly persuasive in their roles. I also like the script’s snappy dialogue. For example, in a conversation with General Sternwood, Marlowe responds: “Hmm”. Sternwood follows up: “What does that mean?” To which Marlowe fires back: “It means, hmm”. Marvelous.\n\nBut the film’s plot is an incoherent mess. It is hard to follow, disjointed, and has obvious lapses. Further, secondary characters (Geiger, Brody, Mars, et.al.), and their interrelationships, are poorly defined. To some extent that vagueness and lack of precision are fairly common in 1940’s pulp detective stories.\n\nThe best approach to “The Big Sleep” is to engulf the relationship between Marlowe and Vivian, marvel at the acting of Bogie and Bacall, enjoy the witty dialogue, and ignore the discombobulated plot.\n\nClassic private eye tale with Bogart and Bacall in fine form\n\nAuthor: Dennis Littrell from United States\n\n12 December 2001\n\nThis classic of American cinema, actually made during the war and released in 1946, got a whole nation of young men affecting Bogey mannerisms, raising their eyebrows or showing their teeth while grimacing, and especially pulling on their earlobes while deep in thought, a smoking cigarette dangling between their lips. It was the genius of Howard Hawks, who directed, to do everything possible to make Humphrey Bogart a matinée idol, including having Lauren Bacall slump down in the car seat so as not to tower over him. With this movie a new kind of cinematic hero was created, the existential PI, a seemingly ordinary looking guy gifted with street smarts and easy courage, admired by men, and adored by women.\n\nHawks fashioned this, part of the Bogart legend, with a noire script penned by William Faulkner, et al., adapted from Raymond Chandler’s first novel, that sparkled with spiffy lines, intriguing characters, danger and a not entirely serious attention to plot detail. Hawks surrounded Bogey with admiring dames, beginning with the sexy Martha Vickers who tries to jump into his lap while he’s still standing (as Marlowe tells General Sternwood), and ending with the incomparable Lauren Bacall, looking beguiling, beautiful and mysteriously seductive. In fact, every female in the cast wants to get her hands on Bogey, including a quick and easy Dorothy Malone, bored in her specs while clerking at a book store. Hawks also employed some very fine character actors, most notably Elisa Cook Jr., and Bob Steele, the former as always, the little guy crook, (Harry Jones), and the latter, as often seen in westerns, the mindless heavy with a gun (Canino). Charles Waldron played the world-weary general and Charles D. Brown was the butler.\n\nI was reminded somehow of the old Charlie Chan movies with the dark, mysterious, ornately-decorated interiors heavily carpeted and studded with ethnic statuettes, especially the house on Laverne Terrace that Bogey keeps coming back to, and the glass-paned doors and glass-separated cubicals of his office and others. The atmospheric L.A. created here has been much admired and imitated, cf., Chinatown (1974) and L.A. Confidential (1997), two very superior movies that continued the tradition.\n\nIn comparing this to the book, I have to say it’s a little on the white-washed side, and not as clearly drawn–‘confused’ some have said. Of course liberties were taken with Chandler’s novel to make it romantic. Chandler’s novel emphasizes cynicism, and romance takes a back seat to manliness and loyalty to the client.\n\nAn especially striking difference is in the character of General Sternwood’s younger daughter, Carmen. She is vividly drawn in the book as something of monster, a degenerate sex kitten who would try and do just about anything. She is twice encountered butt naked by Marlowe, once in his bed. Being the sterling guy he is, he turns her away. (Right. I could do that.) Another difference is in all the sleazy details about the low-life underworld of Los Angeles that are omitted or glossed over in the film, including Geiger’s homosexuality and his gay house guest, Carol Lundgren. (Of course there was a code in those days.) Bacall’s character in the movie is actually a fusion of Vivian and Mona Mars from the book, made nice for movie fans. In the book, Marlowe kisses Vivian, but turns down her invitation for more intimate contact. In the movie, of course, there is no way Bogart is going to say ‘no’ to Bacall. In the book Marlowe seems to prefer whiskey to women.\n\nMost of the sharp dialogue comes right from Chandler’s novel, including Bogart’s grinning line, ‘Such a lot of guns around town, and so few brains.’ Interesting is the little joke on Bogart in the opening scene. In the novel, Chandler’s hero is greeted by the purring Carmen with the words, ‘Tall, aren’t you?’ Well, the one thing Bogey ain’t is tall, and so in the movie Carmen says, ‘You’re not very tall, are you?’ Bogart comes back with, ‘I try to be.’ In the novel, Marlowe says, ‘I didn’t mean to be.’\n\nBy the way, the film features Bacall singing a forties tune and looking mighty good doing it.\n\nComplex plot, but well written and well scripted with tough dialogue and great characters\n\nAuthor: bob the moo from United Kingdom\n\n2 May 2004\n\nPhilip Marlowe is a private detective who is hired by General Sternwood to investigate a case of blackmail involving his youngest daughters’ gambling debts. The General has lost his right hand man, Shaun Regan, and needs a man able to do the job. Marlowe investigates the blackmailer, Geiger and tails him to a house. When he hears shots he rushes in to find Geiger dead and Carmen strung out of her head. With Geiger dead, Marlowe follows the trail to Joe Brody, who also gets rubbed out, and then to Eddie Mars, who’s wife is rumoured to have run off with Regan. As he digs deeper Marlowe finds only corruption and deceit but also starts to fall for the General’s eldest daughter, Vivian Rutledge.\n\nDespite the fact that this film is overly complicated at times, it still stands out as a classic bit of noir, even if aspects other than the plot are what really makes it as good as it is. The plot starts simply but quickly becomes a much more complex beast that moves beyond the issue of blackmail and into murder and lies. For many viewers, this will be a challenge – so many characters come and go in a short period that it is hard to keep track of how they all relate to each other, and the fact that we’re not always supposed to know the connections just makes it more difficult at times. However, if you manage to make it past the midpoint of the film without having totally lost track of people then it becomes clearer towards the end. It may sound silly, but this time I watched the film with a pen and paper to help me keep track of who’s who – it really helped; but it is worth noting that, even with help, bits of the plot will make little sense at times.\n\nThe focus of the film is not the plot – the focus of the film I think is the relationship dynamic between Marlowe and Vivian. In this regard the film really works well. The relationship between is tough but trusting no matter what; at times it is a little hard to see the affection between the two being real or realistic but it is the dialogue between the two that makes it work despite this. The writing is fantastic, the scenes between them do fizzle but the dialogue across the whole film is perfect: it is tough, memorable and basically it is the way I’m sure we all wish we could talk at some point in our lives! The material is also quite daring for the period – murder and tough talk was not unusual but the issues of drugs and nymphomania are hardly common subjects for such a mainstream film at the time.\n\nThe performances are fantastic and perfectly fit the material. Although this is not my favourite Bogart performance (I love him in Maltese Falcon) he is still brilliant here, he is cool, tough and intelligent – at times his power over women threatens to be unrealistic but his presence makes it work. His character is not as complex as in Maltese Falcon but Bogart does harried and world-weary better than anyone else. Bacall is great even if I don’t personally find her that attractive; she has a great chemistry with Bogart and delivers the goods. Vickers is also good but in a less subtle role. The support cast includes tough turns from Cook, Heydt and Ridgely all of whom convince as tough guys but not to the point where they threaten to eclipse the shining star of Bogart.\n\nOverall this is a classic film despite the fact that the plot is too difficult at times and doesn’t always hang together. The flaws here are covered by a tough script that delivers the goods in terms of both dialogue and characters. The plot is a complex web but the basic energy and relationship dynamics keep the film moving really well through scenes that continue to show their influence in films today. Not a perfect film but a great bit of noir that is likely to be loved by the vast majority of viewers – just keep that pen and paper to hand though!\n\n“My, my, my, such a lot of guns around town and so few brains.”\n\nAuthor: classicsoncall from Florida, New York\n\n28 November 2004\n\nStarting out, I must advise that my review here is for the 1945 pre-release version of “The Big Sleep”, which had quite a few scenes redone prior to it’s release to general audiences in October 1946. With filming already completed by Spring of 1945, there were two main reasons for the year and a half delay; first, with World War II underway, Warner Brothers felt compelled to get it’s war related films into theaters while they were still timely.\n\nSecondly, Producer/Director Howard Hawks was convinced he had to re-shoot some scenes involving Lauren Bacall, who was critically panned in her latest film, “Confidential Agent” with Charles Boyer. In the original print, Bacall is presented in a few scenes wearing a distracting veil, and it’s her more glamorous side that the studio needed to capitalize on.\n\nMuch has been made of the complexity of the “The Big Sleep”, and deservedly so. On my latest viewing, I took pen in hand to keep track of the characters and situations. That only helped so much. For example, Humprey Bogart’s character, private detective Philip Marlowe is tailing rare book dealer Arthur Gwynne Geiger for his client General Sternwood; Geiger allegedly holds gambling debts involving a few thousand dollars on Sternwood’s daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers). Following Geiger’s auto to his residence, Marlowe studies his surroundings, and then hears a woman’s scream and gunshots, followed immediately by two cars careening out of the driveway. Entering the house, he discovers the lifeless body of Geiger, and a spaced out Carmen Sternwood. Out of this scenario are offered two, maybe three possibilities. First, General Sternwood’s chauffeur Owen Taylor is implicated, as he had fallen in love with Carmen and wanted to defend her from blackmail. Secondly, a shady Geiger accomplice Joe Brody may have done it, OR may have chased the guilty Taylor from the crime scene either to retrieve some incriminating blackmail film or to remove him as a potential witness. OR, the spaced out Carmen could have killed Geiger herself, and although this wasn’t offered as a possibility in the film, she WAS present, and may have been entirely coherent when the murder was committed.\n\nAnd this is how the story proceeds. Even more characters are introduced to spin off the original plot, and Marlowe is off investigating the proprietor of a gambling house named Eddie Mars, Brody’s accomplice Agnes Lozier, the salesgirl at the rare bookstore, and Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), a tail on Marlowe who gets rubbed out after setting up a meeting with Agnes that might provide more information to go on.\n\nAll of the intrigue aside, it’s the chemistry once again between Bogey and by now, Mrs. Bogey, Lauren Bacall that propels this movie forward. Whether just sizing each other up at the beginning of the film, or as unwilling accomplices and possible lovers by film’s end, it’s the snappy banter and smoldering tension between the two that put the sizzle into this edgy noir thriller.\n\nAs if to prove how great an actor Bogart was, this film offers us a glimpse at his incredible range. Of course I’m referring to the bookstore scene in which Bogey portrays a nerdy client seeking information on a non existent rare book. With a mere upturn of his hat’s brim and a cleverly positioned pair of glasses, Bogart completely transforms into an almost unrecognizable comic character who befuddles and infuriates the store’s proprietress. He follows that up with a walk across the street, and a double entendre filled conversation with a disarmingly seductive Dorothy Malone in a scene that could have lingered into X-rated territory if not for the task at hand.\n\nOne could go on and on about “The Big Sleep”, and others have, but to appreciate the film’s mystery, darkness and noir complexity you’ll have to view it. But don’t try to solve the case, you won’t want to hurt yourself."
