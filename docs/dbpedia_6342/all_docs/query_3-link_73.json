        "text": "The truth, however ugly in itself, is always curious and beautiful to seekers after it.\n\nThe crime genre is one of the most popular in the fiction world. And for good reason. Crime books give us a tantalising taste of what life on the edge is truly like, allowing us to imagine what it would be like to live without rules, engage in our wildest fantasies or be pushed well outside the comfort zone of our everyday norms. And, from historical whodunnits, and high-stakes heists to the inner workings of the most deranged criminal’s mind, What We Reading are here to guide you through all the subgenres that make crime so fascinating and thrilling.\n\nHardboiled Detective\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Big Sleep (Philip Marlowe #1) – Raymond Chandler\n\nThe Thin Man – Dashiell Hammett\n\nA Is for Alibi (Kinsey Millhone #1) – Sue Grafton\n\nHaving emerged in the United States during the early twentieth century, hardboiled detective books are defined by their gritty and realistic depictions of the criminal world and the work of detectives. They feature a tough and cynical protagonist, often operating in a morally ambiguous manner that matches the setting around them. Urban environments are normally the go-to, with darker themes, more complex characters and a focus on violence and danger helping hardboiled detective books stand out from other mystery novels.\n\nCozy Mysteries\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Cat Who Could Read Backwards (The Cat Who… #1) – Lilian Jackson Braun\n\nThe Thirteen Problems (Miss Marple #1) – Agatha Christie\n\nDeath By Darjeeling (A Tea Shop Mystery #1) – Laura Childs\n\nAlso known as ‘cozies’, cozy mysteries are a subgenre of crime fiction that is more on puzzle-solving, and less on violence. These types of books tend to focus on small, close-knit communities in quaint and picturesque settings. They typically feature amateur or casual detectives and maintain a light and charming tone.\n\nNoir Fiction\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Postman Always Rings Twice – James M. Cain\n\nThe Drop – Dennis Lehane\n\nDark Passage – David Goodis\n\nNoir is a term most commonly applied to a visual style in film, featuring low-key lighting and stark contrasts. However, it also makes up a popular crime subgenre in the literary world. Noir fiction is renowned for its bleak and pessimistic atmosphere, its grizzly depictions of urban life and morally vague characters. Corruption and violence are common, with many noir books emphasising themes of greed, passion and moral decay.\n\nNoir and hardboiled detective fiction share many similarities, though there are several differences that help them stand apart from one another. Whilst hardboiled detective books feature a pragmatic detective operating in a grimy urban environment, noir is more about the broader aesthetic and a wider existential commentary.\n\nPsychological Crime Thrillers\n\nExamples:\n\nGone Girl – Gillian Flynn\n\nThe Talented Mr. Ripley (Ripley #1) – Patricia Highsmith\n\nThe Girl On The Train – Paula Hawkins\n\nPsychological thrillers are a part of the crime subgenre that places a firm emphasis on the mental and emotional aspects of the characters and the plot. Not only are these stories about solving the mysteries at play but also about understanding the complex motivations involved with both the perpetrators and the investigators. Intricate plotting, sudden revelations and developments, suspense and an exploration of crime in society are all some of the key aspects of this part of the crime genre.\n\nPolice Procedural\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Black Echo (Harry Bosch #1) – Michael Connelly\n\nThe Killing Floor (Jack Reacher #1) – Lee Child\n\nCop Hater (87th Precinct #1) – Ed McBain\n\nFor those interested in the nitty-gritty of investigations, police procedural is the crime fiction subgenre for you. These books focus on the step-by-step process carried out by law enforcement, presenting a realistic and detailed look into the inner workings of an investigation and the wider criminal justice system.\n\nPolice procedural books are also characterised by their ensemble cast of characters across a spectrum of different departments, their terminology and their high level of accuracy in everything ranging from the investigative process to the complexities of the criminal justice system.\n\nLegal Thriller\n\nExamples:\n\nPresumed Innocent (Kindle County Legal Thriller #1) – Scott Turow\n\nA Time To Kill (Jake Brigance #1) – John Grisham\n\nDefending Jacob – William Landay\n\nLegal thrillers blend gripping storytelling with compelling courtroom drama. This type of crime fiction usually centres around those operating in legal professions such as judges, lawyers and prosecutors. They typically deliver the bulk of the story from the proceedings of the courtroom and investigations into high-stakes cases where the eventual outcome and subsequent consequences aren’t obvious.\n\nRenowned for their accuracy in depicting the intricacies of the legal world, these stories are tense and emotional and often delve into the moral and ethical dilemmas within the justice system.\n\nCheck Out The Best Legal Thriller Books\n\nHistorical Crime Fiction\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Name Of The Rose – Umberto Eco\n\nThe Devil In The Marshalsea (Tom Hawkins #1) – Antonia Hodgson\n\nThe Alienist (Dr. Laszlo Kreizler #1) – Caleb Carr\n\nBridging between the historical fiction and crime genres, historical crime fiction books are set in specific periods of history. Incorporating real-world events and context, the mysteries and crimes at play in these stories fit in with the context of the time, enriching the stories with an authentic feel. By combining compelling storytelling with a rich historical setting, historical crime writers are able to conjure up a book that offers a compelling mystery and gives an insight into the past.\n\nEspionage Thrillers\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Bourne Identity (Jason Bourne #1) – Robert Ludlum\n\nCall For The Dead (George Smiley #1) – John le Carré\n\nRed Sparrow (Red Sparrow Trilogy #1) – Jason Matthews\n\nEspionage crime thrillers revolve around spying, covert operations, intelligence operations and all kinds of scenarios where people wind up cutting holes in newspapers. With spies, agents and operatives navigating high-stakes levels of intrigue and secrecy, espionage thrillers often tap into real-world geopolitical tensions and other murky plots.\n\nCheck Out Everything You Need To Know About Writing Political Fiction\n\nSerial Killer Thrillers\n\nExamples:\n\nRed Dragon (Hannibal Lecter #1) – Thomas Harris\n\nThe Bone Collector (Lincoln Rhyme #1) – Jeffery Deaver\n\nDarkly Dreaming Dexter (Dexter #1) – Jeff Lindsay\n\nA special section of the crime genre has been carved out for serial killers. The most evil and deranged of criminals, identifying, arresting and studying these killers has formed the backbone of countless works of fiction. As well as the cat-and-mouse game behind the killers and the police, serial killer crime thriller books also delve into the darker aspects of the human psyche. Whilst these stories can be hugely enthralling and fascinating for crime fans, their subject material is not always suitable for every reader.\n\nHeists And Capers\n\nExamples:\n\nOcean’s Eleven – George Clayton Johnson\n\nThe Hunter (Parker #1) – Richard Stark\n\nThe Hot Rock (Dortmunder #1) – Donald E. Westlake\n\nHeists and caper novels revolve around meticulously planned thefts. These thefts can be placed in any setting or context, with the emphasis being on the planning, build-up, execution and various complications that can unfold once it gets underway.\n\nThese books tend to feature an ensemble cast of colourful characters, all with unique skills and abilities required for the heist. Humour and a more jovial tone compared to other crime subgenres are used to make these characters likeable and to be rooted for, despite being the criminals of the piece.\n\nAmateur Sleuth Mysteries\n\nExamples:\n\nOne For The Money (Stephanie Plum #1) – Janet Evanovich\n\nThe Secret, Book & Scone Society (Secret, Book, & Scone Society #1) – Ellery Adams\n\nThe Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time – Mark Haddon\n\nAmateur sleuth mysteries are a type of crime subgenre featuring protagonists who attempt to solve a crime without any formal training. They often stumble upon crimes and take it upon themselves to solve them. There are overlaps with cozy crime books, however, there are some key differences. Whilst cozy mysteries prioritise a warm, lighthearted and comfortable feel, that is not a requirement with amateur sleuths.\n\nAmateur sleuth mysteries also tend to feature protagonists who solve crimes due to personal reasons, rather than professional ones."
