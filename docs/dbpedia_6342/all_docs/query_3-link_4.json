        "text": "The 67 Different Sub Genres\n\nTwo decades and a century since the dawn of cinema, it is safe to say the medium has by now produced a colossal variety of films. This can be almost overwhelming at times. So, different categories help guide us through this. Whether it’s in choosing a script to write, read or just finding the Netflix pick for the day, sub genres help audiences navigate the cinematic landscape.\n\nScreenplays can be better identified with the help of sub genres. Here we can learn instantly the potential style, tone, subject matter and overall feel of the movie or TV show we are about to watch, read or write.\n\nSub genres and their meanings can be useful to help define your screenplay. Moreover, a sub genre will not just help you give clarity to your script’s definition but also help in guiding it.\n\nYou might not want to fulfil genre expectations to the point of cliche. However, having a strong idea of genre expectations will help you subvert them as well as fulfil them, giving the audience what they expect whilst also providing them with the unexpected.\n\nSub genres can of course overlap and often a screenplay will fall into multiple categories. But the categories’ usefulness remains. Indeed, the more sub genres a screenplay fits into, the more potentially versatile it proves.\n\nSo we’ve compiled a list of sub genres and their meaning. These might help you better understand the tone, themes or even plot of the story you are seeking to write.\n\nWhat are the key elements of these sub-genres? And how do they manifest in the cinematic landscape? Let’s take a look:\n\nAction\n\nAction indicates a portrayal of threat. This could be because of altruistic, evil or supernatural causes and will likely involve fighting or battle sequences.\n\nFurthermore, ‘Action’ usually speaks to the pace and structure of the story, centred around set-pieces and building to a climactic finale.\n\n1. Superhero\n\nThis will involve one singular heroic figure with special or supernatural abilities. Or a group of such characters banded together. They will become the supernatural representatives of human concerns – saving the world, stopping an evil presence, preserving humanity.\n\nFurthermore, a common theme in superhero screenplays is the clear hero and villain distinction among characters. There’s often little ambiguity, a clear evil obstacle for the good guys to overcome. A clear example are the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nMarvel Studios' Avengers: Infinity War Official Trailer\n\n2. Spy\n\nScreenplays with a spy action theme often include characters that are secret agents or moles. This can involve a plot based on espionage for patriotic or altruistic motives.\n\nThey might be carrying out their mission on behalf of a state or for their own personal reasons.\n\nThe Mission: Impossible franchise and Phillip Noyce’s Salt are some popular examples of the spy action genre.\n\n3. Martial Arts\n\nThis sub genre of screenplay usually includes fighting sequences and set-pieces for major chunks of the plot. These scenes are the jewels in the crown of these kinds of movies. Karate and Kung-fu are some of the popular martial arts styles used in film.\n\nMovies like The Raid: Redemption and Enter The Dragon are some examples of the martial arts sub genre.\n\nEnter The Dragon (1973) Official Trailer - Bruce Lee Movie\n\n4. Disaster\n\nBrad Peyton’s San Andreas illustrates this sub genre fittingly. Disaster action screenplays usually revolve around the risk that a natural or man-made disaster entails.\n\nSo the action sequences in these screenplays are based on evasion of danger caused by the disaster.\n\n5. Buddy Cop\n\nThis sub genre will include two police officers as protagonists. Often the plot usually revolves around the development of their relationship while the two characters work together to survive the dangers in the story.\n\nThe classic film series Bad Boys and Lethal Weapon are some popular examples of this sub genre, whilst The Nice Guys and The Heat are more contemporary examples.\n\n6. Swashbuckler\n\nScreenplays like The Pirates of the Carribean franchise and The Three Musketeers share a plot portraying heroic bloodshed. This sub genre is usually set in historic times and often comprises of sword fighting action sequences.\n\nFurthermore, the fighting elements are usually set to protect the vulnerable and hence, entail less violence. There is often a theme of the ‘little guy’ fighting against the powers that be.\n\n‘Swash’ comes from ‘to swagger with a sword’ whilst ‘buckler’ is a small shield. Therefore a ‘Swashbuckler’ denotes a fighter with relative small means but swagger and skill to make up for it.\n\nThriller\n\nThriller screenplays aim to create a strong connection with the audience. This is accomplished with the help of an exciting and engaging plot and tone. They will keep audiences on the edge of their seats.\n\n1. Psychological\n\nPsychological thrillers involve intense emotional elements in the story. The plot often includes a threatening situation confronting the protagonist as a result of psychological instability.\n\nHence the story steers towards the journey of the protagonist conquering their own psychological struggles. Blue Velvet, Shutter Island and Gone Girl are some popular examples of the sub genre.\n\n2. Mystery\n\nMystery thrillers are the movies that make you bite your nails while sitting on the edge of your seat. In fact, these screenplays thrive on the plot twists and unpredictability of the story. The story will keep you guessing right till the very end and that is its main purpose.\n\nThe Girl on the Train and The Da Vinci Code are some examples of well-known mystery thrillers.\n\n3. Techno\n\nTechno thriller films like The Circle have a high engagement with the technological resources within the plot. Moreover, the plot will includes suspense whilst upholding the subtlety of the technical aspects of the story.\n\nThe screenplays of Alex Garland often strike this balance, such as Ex-Machina or Devs.\n\n4. Conspiracy\n\nConspiracy thriller screenplays build on the unravelling of an unexpected consequence triggered by the protagonist. This will be an unexpected discovery or a quest for knowledge of an unexpected event.\n\nSome popular examples include the TV series 24 and the films JFK and In the Line of Fire.\n\n5. Film Noir\n\nScreenplays like The Black Dahlia and Sin City portray the sub genre fittingly. Often film noir screenplays will contain a highly specific dark, black and white visual theme. But this colour is not just visual, it is tonal, suggesting a world where the colour has been taken out and danger lurks in the shadows.\n\nAs suggested by its name, this sub genre includes dark and cynical attributes in the construct of the plot and characters. However, the protagonist is usually depicted as a victim of circumstance and associated with the investigation of a crime, holding some authority (i.e police detective).\n\nComedy\n\nEven though screenplays of all genres can contain humorous segments, the comedy genre refers to screenplays that have consistent and purposeful hilarity.\n\nThe comical aspects can be the mannerisms of characters or the situations that they encounter.\n\n1. Comedy of Manners\n\nThis sub genre entails comedic segments delivered through the witty interactions of the characters, often of a particular section of society.\n\nIt’s a comedy that will satirize manners and affectations and seeks to question the supposed standards and rules of a society. Interactions that some would see as completely normal will suddenly seem strange, alien and funny.\n\nPopular films like Breakfast at Tiffany’s and Lost in Translation are some examples of this sub genre. Both seek to highlight the strangeness and comedy of social interactions and norms, albeit in very different ways.\n\n2. Parody\n\nParodies may draw on other screenplays and genres for the comedic structure of the screenplay. This can include sarcasm and mockery of the obvious elements of the original screenplay/ genre. A parody will point out and make fun of the expectations audiences have of the subject at hand.\n\nThis is evident in the Scary Movie franchise, which uses mockery of horror films as its primary motivation.\n\n3. Black Comedy\n\nBlack comedy is the sub genre of comedy which makes use of dark humour. The Death of Stalin illustrates this sub genre well. It’s a very serious subject matter but told with the paintbrush of comedy.\n\nIn Bruges is another great example of a black comedy. The context and action flirts with murder, suicide, depression and violence. But the characters are funny and the juxtaposition of this darkness and comedy is what makes the tone darkly humorous.\n\nOften it’s the irony of comedy in such dark situations that is funny in itself.\n\n4. Slapstick\n\nSlapstick comedies incorporate mannerisms and exuberant actions. Often, traditionally, the screenplays in this sub genre would contain little or no dialogue. However, more contemporary examples do contain dialogue and still use slapstick as the main source of comedy.\n\nMr Bean, Tom and Jerry Tales and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective are examples of this sub genre. Often it’s a genre of comedy that a particular actor will specialise in and make a big part of their work, such as Rowan Atkinson or Jim Carrey.\n\n5. Fish Out of Water\n\nThis sub genre thrives on comedic situations that the characters encounter in the plot.\n\nThat is to say that often the protagonist in these screenplays faces unfamiliar situations. The main source of comedy will be the bumps in the road the protagonist has in navigating this new environment. They’re learning new rules and we laugh at the missteps they make and the clashes they have with this new world.\n\nHowever, usually the protagonist will win out in the end, navigating the world successfully but proving they don’t have to change everything about themselves.\n\nPopular examples of this sub genre include Coming to America, Legally Blonde and Back to the Future.\n\n6. Sitcom\n\nSitcom refers to situational comedy. This sub genre incorporates characters who discover unusual situations resulting in confusion and chaos acting as the funny bone of the plot.\n\nThese situations will be placed in a consistent and familiar setting. The setting stays the same but the situations are always different and seemingly unending.\n\nThe Simpsons, Seinfeld and Friends are some of the most famous sitcom examples. All have the same settings throughout their many series. The characters in The Simpsons don’t even change their clothes. But each episode has a different conundrum to deal with.\n\n7. Mockumentary\n\nThis sub genre uses the design of another genre as the drive of comedy and the structure of the plot. It is specifically aping a documentary format in order to make the characters and situation seem believable. This believability is often intended to make the subject feel more real and therefore the comedy more acute and effective.\n\nThe TV series The Office, Parks and Recreation and the film Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping clearly represent this sub genre. It’s a well-tread path for contemporary comedies to venture down.\n\nSometimes the format feels perfect in how it makes the comedy more effective. Whilst sometimes it feels like a stylistic affectation. Always question the exact comedic function of a Mokumentary format before potentially employing one in your own screenplay.\n\nPopstar: Never Stop Never Stopping Official Trailer #2 (2016) - Andy Samberg Movie HD\n\nCrime\n\nThe screenplays of this genre consist of stirring stories of criminal gangs, investigations and criminal legislative conflicts.\n\nCrime in film and TV may not always illustrate protagonists as heroic or morally correct. The line of distinction between good and bad often merges to show crime from different viewpoints.\n\n1. Heist\n\nHeist movies and narratives are popular by dint of the tense development of the plot. The characters are involved in executing theft of a valuable item or large amounts of money. The tension is usually inherent in whether or not they will pull this off.\n\nPopular examples include Baby Driver and the TV series Money Heist.\n\n2. Courtroom\n\nThis sub genre is usually preoccupied with criminal legal cases for the majority of the screenplay.\n\nMoreover, the story often consists of all major instances situated in a court room. The primary focus is often the specifics of the case as it is worked out in court.\n\nA film such as Anatomy of a Murder portrays this sub genre aptly. Whilst a TV series such as The Good Wife also occupies this genre space.\n\n3. Police Procedural\n\nThis sub genre focuses on the different stages of a crime and its investigation. The story usually consists of police officers navigating through the criminal act committed and the actions taken by the legislative system.\n\nTrue Detective and the CSI series are examples of this sub genre within TV. Whilst L.A. Confidential is a movie example.\n\n4. Gangster\n\nThe crowd puller of screenplays of the gangster movie sub genre is the representation of organised crime. This is often centred from the viewpoint of a member of a gang.\n\nNot only does this sub genre recognise gangs as dangerous but it also represents the characters as relatable to the audience. It doesn’t just seek to represent gangs as menacing but seeks to represent the characters as human, often trapped within the downfalls of gang life.\n\nScarface, The Godfather series and Goodfellas are some popular examples.\n\n5. Detective\n\nDetective screenplays can often be confused with the Police Procedural sub genre. However, a key difference is that private or government investigators carry out the investigation instead of cops.\n\nThis sub genre will often paint the detective as a complicated individual, a protagonist who the audience is on the side of because of their flaws as much as their strengths.\n\nThe focus is often on the characters, or on complex themes as much as it is on the literal mechanics of the crime at hand. It’s not just about finding out what happened in this crime, it’s about the journey of discovery.\n\nThis is clearly seen in films like Se7en or Zodiac.\n\nDrama\n\nThis genre pivots around emotion. Dramatic screenplays gain insight from real human experiences and situations.\n\nIndeed this genre intends to engage with audiences by using an intense, subtle plot instead of comedic or adventurous segments.\n\n1. Melodrama\n\nThe Melodramatic sub genre in film and TV uses intense social situations among characters. The plot usually builds over events that are relatively common in real life.\n\nBut the drama is intended to appeal to the emotions, rather than going in heavy on characterisation. Melodramas often concentrate on over the top or excessively sentimental dialogue, rather than on internal conflict.\n\nIn fact, the intention of melodramatic screenplays is to construct an emotional and moral connection with the audience. Examples include All That Heaven Allows and Written on the Wind.\n\n2. Medical\n\nMedical dramas are based on the lives of medical professionals. The plot pivots around the relationship among the medical staff at hospitals and the emotional rollercoaster that their jobs take them on.\n\nThe TV series Grey’s Anatomy aptly reflects the design of the medical drama.\n\n3. Teen/Coming of Age\n\nTeen dramas usually occupy high school setting to present the lives of teenagers. These screenplays depict the challenges that adolescents face and the differences in each character’s situation.\n\nThis drama could also be called ‘Coming of Age’. However, the difference is that a ‘Coming of Age’ drama isn’t always necessarily focused around teenagers.\n\nSome popular examples of teen dramas include Lady Bird, The Perks of Being a Wallflower and Euphoria.\n\n4. Legal\n\nA legal drama pivots around the characters working within the legislative system. However, legal dramas differ from courtroom crime screenplays due to the deflection of emphasis from the crime.\n\nThe plot usually attends to how the events affect the lead characters. Prominent examples of this sub genre include Kramer vs. Kramer, A Few Good Men and Marshall.\n\n5. Docudrama\n\nDocudramas use a suitably dramatised plot to depict real life events. Akin to documentaries, the stories depicted in docudramas are true but recreated.\n\nApollo 13 and Miracle Landing are some famous docudramas.\n\n6. Period\n\nPeriod dramas include emotional circumstances and relationships shown in historical settings. Although, this sub genre often uses fictional plots, it may be influenced by events and people in real life.\n\nThe Favourite, Belle and Sense and Sensibility serve as different examples of this sub genre. Their difference shows the versatility and potential range of the genre.\n\n7. Political\n\nPolitical dramas are based on events that take place in political environments. The plot revolves around the decisions and implications of the people in authority in different levels of governments.\n\nA film like The Ides of March depict this sub genre fittingly.\n\nFantasy\n\nThis genre consists of fictional plots with supernatural elements. The characters may draw from people in real life encountering relatively relatable situations.\n\nHowever, the use of magical and mystical elements in fantasy screenplays is what makes the genre.\n\n1. Contemporary\n\nContemporary fantasy screenplays usually include a supernatural plotline based in a modern time period.\n\nThis sub genre intends to present an alternative reality. The Harry Potter film series and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones are examples of contemporary fantasy.\n\n2.

The plot pivots around characters meeting in the afterlife.\n\nThis often includes religious experiences from the character’s perspective. These characters will also often be well-known historical or literary figures.\n\nSome examples of this sub genre include A Matter of Life and Death and What Dreams May Come.\n\n4. Sword and Sorcery\n\nThis sub genre can be confused with high fantasy. However, sword and sorcery screenplays are more plot driven and less character and theme driven. They will often be relatively simplistic in their drive, the protagonist seeking to overthrow an evil overlord by defeating them in battle, for example.\n\nProminent examples of sword and sorcery fantasy include Conan the Barbarian and The Sword and the Sorcerer.\n\n5. Dark\n\nDark fantasy screenplays are known to include frightening supernatural elements. This sub genre builds around a dark and gloomy tone. Moreover, this tone will often be suggestive of a sophisticated subtext.\n\nPan’s Labyrinth aptly reflects the style of dark fantasy screenplays.

Supernatural\n\nA paranormal romance includes the supernatural alongside human emotion. This sub genre presents an unusual romantic tale between two characters.\n\nA fitting example of this sub genre is the Twilight Saga which presents romantic relationships consisting of humans, vampires and werewolves. Furthermore, The Time Traveller’s Wife uses time travel to amp up the stakes of a romantic relationship.\n\n4. Romantic Thriller\n\nRomantic thrillers include screenplays that majorly build around a romantic story but include engaging, action based sequences. This comprises of suspenseful and intense segments occurring within and around a romantic relationship.\n\nSubmergence and The Bodyguard are examples of this sub genre.\n\n5. Romantic Drama\n\nRomantic dramas portray the complex emotions occurring in a romantic context. This sounds straightforward. But of course it rarely is.\n\nThe focus of this sub genre is squarely on the trials and tribulations of a romantic relationship.

Experimental screenplays can vary in motives and are known to have unconventional designs.\n\n1.

Monster\n\nMonster horror screenplays consist of horrifying creatures and beasts.
