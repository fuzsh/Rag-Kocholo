        "text": "2. What is a Thriller? A thriller is a genre in media in which the moods of excitement, anticipation, fear and suspense are portrayed. There is a ‘thrill’ in which the audience will experience when watching media of this genre.\n\n3. Types of Thrillers: Will often revolve around a character's thoughts and involve themes of paranoia. PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME A movie focusing on the criminal and the extremities of law enforcement procedures. MYSTERY An ongoing battle between the protagonist and villain in order to resolve a crime. SCI-FI A thriller that will push the bounds of modern science in order to create a risk. ACTION A movie that will involve plenty of physical action to create suspense.\n\n5. PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER ★ Often told through the perception of a psychologically stressed character who portrays characteristics of distorted mental image. ★ These movies will incorporate elements of mystery, drama, action and paranoia. This genre will often have the audience confused on who the actual ‘bad guy’ is. ★ Literary devices and techniques: plot twists, unreliable narrator, red herring (an irrelevant topic introduced to divert the audience’s attention). ★ Themes: death, identity/purpose, mind, perception and reality.--> amnesia is a common plot device used. ★ Codes and conventions: ○ Shadows and low-key lighting to represent the inner darkness of a character. ○ Mirrors to reﬂect a character’s dark side. ○ Location and costumes are very normal and modern to portray that ‘normal’ characters can have a dark side. ○ eerie , intense music. ○ Quick shots is used to symbolize an often chaotic thought process. The audience can feel the emotions of the character. ○ Camera wracking to confuse the audience. ○ Flashbacks give context to why the character could be going through emotions. ○ Pills and medicine are used as props to signify mental distress and mental disorders which also give more context as to who the character is and why they may act a certain way.\n\n7. CRIME THRILLER ★ Thrillers that will focus on the criminals rather than law enforcement as they bring across elements of violence, murders, robberies and double-crossings. ★ Themes: betrayal, ruthless ambition, conspiracy, pessimism and corruption derived from the setting’s policing; or the suspenseful results of mistaken identity and undercover work. ★ Literary techniques: glamorization of the criminals as the movies are often centred around them, can involve characters with a moral code or may develop this throughout the movie, intimidating antagonists is a feature that builds tension, there is potential for the audience to feel confused after watching a crime thriller as they don’t know whether or not to feel bad for the criminal or condemn them. ★ Codes and conventions: ○ Quick cuts to heighten the suspense. ○ Red herrings to distract the audience and make them think they know what’s gonna happen. ○ Silhouettes and shadowing are used to portray the ‘dark side’ of the criminals. ○ Props of masks and guns to mask identity and portray danger. ○ Characters are put through high stakes that almost cause anxiety for the audience as we begin to create an emotional connection to them. ○ Weapons, law enforcement and criminals. ○ The hero is typically a police oﬃcer or private investigator but there is potential to feel empathy for the criminal as there is a more in depth understanding of why they do what they do.\n\n9. MYSTERY THRILLER ★ A mystery thriller is almost the opposite of a crime thriller but has very similar conventions. In this case the thriller is focused on the investigator or hero as they attempt to uncover the crime and the ways in which they uncover the mystery is shown throughout the movie. ★ There is always an element of time running out. The antagonist is always racing against the clock in order to solve a crime. There is a key period of time after a crime has been committed for real breakthroughs in an investigation to occur. ★ Themes: assasination, terrorism, serial or mass murders. ★ Codes and conventions: ○ Suspense is created for the audience as they too are trying to uncover the mystery and are in the unknown just like the characters. They will feel similar emotions. ○ Red herrings are commonly used to put the audience in the wrong direction as they think they may of just solved it. ○ Often the criminals can pose to be the normal or heroic characters and the audience can experience a plot twist when their true identity is revealed. ○ The sound is usually slow and weary signifying the idea of the unknown. ○ Many canted angles and tilted shots are used to show discomfort.\n\n11. SCI-FI THRILLER ★ This thriller consists of the manipulation of sophisticated technology in order to create suspense and a sense of danger. For example a killing robot. ★ There are elements of an action thriller used as usually a ﬁght will break out between man and technology. There are also many elements of a futuristic or parallel world which creates unease among the audience as it leaves them with the question; ‘could this actually happen?’ ★ Themes: artiﬁcial intelligence, the future, ﬁrst contact with aliens, and end of humanity. ★ Codes and conventions: ○ The soundtrack used in these thrillers will be relatively ‘spacey’ with the use of techno music and music abnormal to modern society. ○ The location and settings are usually other worldly and may contain places with ruins which are replaced with an upgraded ‘new world’. ○ The location could also contrast this and contain very little almost like an apocalypse has occurred. ○ Camera can replicate a very robotic stance almost like the robots used in the movies. ○ The costumes used are normally very futuristic always using colours of silver or white to replicate sophisticated technology. ○ Props are interesting as sometimes the props are actually characters in a way as they could be robots. Guns are also commonly used but resemble more of a man weapon than a technological weapon."
