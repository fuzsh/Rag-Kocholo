        "text": "Drama refers to films of the dramatic genre. These films are set with a serious tone in mind, and are generally films that could otherwise take place in the so-called \"real-world\", even if such films take place in different time eras. Because drama is such a broad-sweeping category, it can actually be broken down into a multitude of subgenres. Which is to say, dramas may also fall into other film categories as well, though may not necessarily be considered part of that genre. Most horror films for example, are genres, but as the driving force of the film is to illicit fear, they will all be listed under horror rather than here.\n\nTraditional drama[]\n\nThis is drama that cannot be pigeonholed into any particular subgenre. These are films that take place in the current day, that present stories that could conceivably take place in the real world with realistic characters and settings.\n\n8 Mile\n\nAccused, The (1988)\n\nAmerican Graffiti (1973)\n\nBeautiful Mind, A\n\nBehind the Nudist Curtain\n\nCitizen Kane (1941)\n\nCobweb, The (1955)\n\nDeliverance\n\nDiary of a Nudist\n\nEasy Rider\n\nEasy Rider II: The Ride Back\n\nFargo\n\nFires Within\n\nFrom Here to Eternity (1953)\n\nGentlemen Prefer Nature Girls\n\nGood Will Hunting (1997)\n\nHollywood Boulevard (1976)\n\nHomecoming\n\nInvitation, The\n\nLost in Translation (2003)\n\nNudist Story, The\n\nPrince and the Nature Girl, The\n\nPurple Rain (1984)\n\nSling Blade (1996)\n\nStriptease (1996)\n\nTaxi Driver\n\nTulsa\n\nUnder the Cherry Moon\n\nWall Street\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\n\nWolf of Wall Street, The\n\nBiographical drama[]\n\nBiographical dramas are generally based on actual events and chronicle the lives of actual people. Some of these films may be based on books, or autobiographies, and is not uncommon for the individual from whom the story is based upon to have a hand in the development of the film treatment.\n\nBorn on the Fourth of July - Based on the experiences of Ron Kovic during the Vietnam War.\n\nMagic Mike - Loosely based on the life of actor Channing Tatum.\n\nMommie Dearest - Based on the life of actress Joan Crawford according to her daughter.\n\nMonster - Based on the killer career of female serial killer Aileen Wuornos.\n\nOctober Sky\n\nCrime drama[]\n\nCrime dramas are films that focus on procedural plot lines over that of character development, and are usually presenting the contrasting conflicts between some member or members of a law enforcement agency and whatever criminal enterprise they seek to defeat.

They focus on the exploits of organized crime and generally take place during the 1930s and 1940s, which is the height of the gangster era. Gangster films are different from \"gangsta films\", which is another subgenre of crime drama that arose in the early 1990s. The basic premise is the same, but usually involves an urban setting and takes place in the modern era.\n\nAnalyze This (1999)\n\nAnalyze That (2002)\n\nGodfather, The (1972)\n\nGodfather: Part II, The (1974)\n\nGodfather: Part III, The (1990)\n\nMobsters (1991)\n\nSt. Valentine's Day Massacre, The (1967)\n\nLegal drama[]\n\n12 Angry Men\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\n\nMilitary drama[]\n\nBorn on the Fourth of July\n\nCrimson Tide\n\nInglourious Basterds\n\nPeriod drama[]\n\nPeriod dramas are films that glorify the splendors of correct punctuation. Just kidding. Period dramas are so named because they take place in a different time era from that of the present. This time era is always in the past, otherwise they would be considered part of the science fiction genre. Even amongst period dramas, there are several offshoot movie niches, the most famous one among them being westerns. There are also other historical dramas involving well-known time eras such as Victorian-era England, Medieval Europe, and the days of the Roman Empire.\n\nBarry Lyndon\n\nCurious Case of Benjamin Button, The (2008)\n\nDracula (1992)\n\nFrankenstein (1994)\n\nGladiator\n\nGodfather, The (1972)\n\nGodfather: Part II, The (1974)\n\nGodfather: Part III, The (1990)\n\nGothic (1986)\n\nHannibal Rising (2007)\n\nHelp, The\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nMary Reilly (1996)\n\nRichard III (1955)\n\nSeabiscuit\n\nWarrens of Virginia, The (1915)\n\nWarrens of Virginia, The (1924)\n\nRomance drama[]\n\nAll the Loving Couples\n\nBaby Driver\n\nBeyond Borders\n\nBlaze Starr Goes Nudist\n\nBride, The (1985)\n\nCasablanca (1942)\n\nClass of '74\n\nCutting Edge, The\n\nCurious Case of Benjamin Button, The\n\nDracula (1979)\n\nDracula (1992)\n\nEdward Scissorhands\n\nFly Me to the Moon\n\nFrom Here to Eternity\n\nGhost\n\nGirl With a Pearl Earring\n\nHomecoming (1948)\n\nIllusionist, The\n\nLast Seduction, The\n\nMary Reilly (1996)\n\nNotorious (1946)\n\nOndine (2009)\n\nPractical Magic\n\nReturn to Me\n\nRoller Boogie\n\nShakespeare in Love\n\nShape of Water, The\n\nSpring\n\nSummer School Teachers\n\nTin Cup\n\nTitanic\n\nTurkish Delight (1973)\n\nTwilight: Breaking Dawn Part I\n\nUnder the Cherry Moon (1986)\n\nWarrens of Virginia, The (1915)\n\nWarrens of Virginia, The (1924)\n\nWatcher Girl\n\nWicker Park (2004)\n\nWolf (1994)\n\nDance films[]\n\nFame (1980)\n\nFlashdance (1983)\n\nDramatic comedies[]\n\nDon Jon (2013)\n\nMade in Brooklyn (2007)\n\nSports films[]\n\nSports films relates to any film where the central topic revolves around some type of sport, be it an athletic sport, an intellectual competition, or what have you. This includes traditional sports such as baseball, football (American and English), basketball, soccer, and hockey to alternative sports like car racing, boxing, mixed martial arts, and of course... golf. In film, movies about sports can be broken down into two larger categories, Sports dramas and sports comedies.\n\nDays of Thunder\n\nRad\n\nRocky\n\nRocky II\n\nRocky III"
