        "text": "Subgenres\n\nWhat is a Subgenre?\n\nA guide to nuanced themes.\n\nWe looked to our friends at MasterClass to help define ‘subgenre.’ Here’s what we discovered.\n\nIn film, a subgenre is a specific style of filmmaking that falls within a broad genre category like comedy, horror, or drama. Subgenres differ stylistically. For instance, romantic comedies and slapstick cartoons qualify as comedies, but the two vary significantly in terms of storytelling, dialogue, visual style, and humor. Any one film genre may include myriad distinct subgenres that share commonalities and often overlap.\n\n42 Common Subgenres\n\nA guide to the most popular genres within genres.\n\nAlthough we have more than 130 subgenres within 8FLiX, there are 42 frequently used subs that most people are familiar with.\n\nTen Examples of Comedy Subgenres\n\nAll comedy films involve humor, but they achieve it in wildly different ways.\n\n1.
