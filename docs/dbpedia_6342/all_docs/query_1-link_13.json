The performance of a person’s life must be focused upon. The chronological is of minor consequence. Years are like dollar signs. They indicate a preoccupation with numbers. People are not numbers.”\n\n“When they tell me one of my old movies is on TV, I don’t look at it.”\n\n\"There are so many more interesting things to think about than whether Ida Lupino or Jane Wyman got the roles I should have gotten.\"\n\n— Alexis Smith\n\nTRIVIA:"
