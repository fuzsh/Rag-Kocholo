        "text": "This article explores the relationship between a film audience and a film star. It assumes that the genre is a common ground or interface where an actor-who then becomes the star, and an audience meet together and afterward the expectations of that audience become the key player to push forward the relationship between them. In forging the relationship between two parties, the genre takes the responsibility of constructing an actor's star-personality and of shaping the spectator's size of a distinct kind. To substantiate the argument, the essay discusses audiences' inscribed entity and construction of a star under the title 'the star-a construction of the negotiations'; the dynamics of their relationship under the title 'audience expectation and their relationship with the Star' and finally, in conclusion, it highlights the genre's intermediary contribution to the relationship. The author has taken the critical/theoretical approach; therefore heavily relied on existing literature and theories (e.g. psychoanalysis, star theory).\n\nIn my dissertation I do a close reading of five contemporary films through a Deleuzean feminist framework: What Lies Beneath (Robert Zemeckis, 2000), The Others (Alejandro Amenábar, 2001), The Forgotten (Joseph Ruben, 2004), Flightplan (Robert Schwentke, 2005), and In The Cut (Jane Campion, 2003). I argue that these films draw on the female Gothic genre but deterritorialise it through various strategies. The gothic has primarily been studied from a psychoanalytical perspective focusing on the heroines’ pathologies and frequently defining female subjectivity in terms of masochism. This approach seems to have led to an impasse in feminist film theory, therefore I try to follow a different path. Michelle A. Massé’s work on the literary Gothic in her book In the Name of Love: Women, Masochism, and the Gothic and Mary Ann Doane’s exploration of the Gothic woman's film in her book The Desire to Desire: The Woman’s Film of the 1940s function as my starting points and guidelines. Massé proposes that, “we have to shift our critical focus from the ‘faults’ of the heroine that are implied by an analytic language of masochism and repressed desire.” To shift my critical focus, I approach the contemporary Gothic through an affirmative Deleuzean feminism in hope that it will reveal the rich potential of the contemporary films in terms of feminist lines-of-flight. My main guide for the conceptualisation of Deleuze’s theories in cinema is Patricia Pisters’ work in her book The Matrix of Visual Culture: Working with Deleuze in Film Theory.\n\nThis dossier examines a set of four Hollywood ‘B’ film series of the 1930s and 1940s – anchored by the figures of Hildegarde Withers (six films between 1932 and 1937), Torchy Blane (nine films between 1937 and 1939), Nancy Drew (four films from 1938 and 1939) and Blondie (28 films between 1938 and 1950) – which have come to be understood as an ‘empowered women’ cycle. In looking back at this relatively marginalized cycle from a point in time nearly 90 years after the first film appeared, this dossier gives some productive historical perspective to two contested themes that the discursive practices of popular online media commentary tend to present as unique to the current cultural moment. The first is the practice of media serialization, which visibly underpins American popular culture’s preferred formatting choices of serials, sequels, remakes, reboots and other ‘multiplicities’ at the end of the 21st century’s second decade. The practice is popularly regarded with some ambivalence, from a straightforward perception of creative exhaustion to more nuanced reflections that consider the cultural function of nostalgia and revisionism in this historical period. The second theme, contextualized in important ways by the mainstreaming of sexual politics that has developed out of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, is focused on the increased number of female protagonists acting with heightened agency in Hollywood films of the past few years, and debates whether this represents the triumph or the mere commodification of feminism. Looking back to a set of films from the studio era that are simultaneously defined by seriality and female agency provides an opportunity not only to show that these themes are far from new production strategies for Hollywood, but to demonstrate how the two might productively be thought together – that is, to investigate how seriality actually enables the gender politics of the historical cycle.\n\nThe proposed study is an attempt to examine the representation of women in realistic cinema. The study will focus on how women were presented and misrepresented in cinema. Based on feminist film theoretician, Claire Johnston, further analysis is developed on the idea of how feminist theories like counter cinema can be related to realistic films. This study will explore on how with changing times, women-centric movies started gaining popularity. Realistic films helped portray women to play strong and challenging roles and in addition to this, they have been able to make a mark in the mainstream cinema. This study will also briefly discuss how realistic cinema is different from popular cinema or popular cinema."
