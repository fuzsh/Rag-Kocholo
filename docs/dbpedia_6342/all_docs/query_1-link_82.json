        "text": "Entourage\n\nBasking in the adulation from his latest movie premiere, Hollywood 'it' actor Vince Chase joins childhood pals Eric, Drama and Turtle to debate the pros and cons of attending their tenth high-school reunion back east. Meanwhile, Eric--Vince's de facto manager--incurs the wrath of Vince's agent Ari by advising Vince to pass on a script he hasn't even read. On the domestic-security front, Turtle agrees to test the mettle of the entourage's new guard dog, a Rottweiler named Ahnold.\n\nUnlike a Virgin\n\nVince is feeling insecure about more than just his career when former flame, Justine Chapman, pawns him off on her friend at a party. Eric offers to represent two writers of an indie film script but can't get them Vince, or any help from Ari. Drama maintains constant contact with Jacqueline.\n\nFore!\n\nAt a charity golf tournament, Vince and Drama up the stakes with teammates Mark Wahlberg and Tom Brady. Having fielded an awkward situation with Sloan, Eric gets an unexpected job offer. After refusing to break the 'guy code,' Ari finds himself in the doghouse with Mrs. Ari...and Jeffrey Tambor.\n\nTequila and Coke\n\nSeeking assurance that Vince's life is under control, director Randall Wallace calls a meeting, but Vince parties a bit too hard the night before. Ari agrees to help Lizzie find a new job in exchange for some potentially damaging audiotapes. Turtle winds up in damage control after promising an L.A. retailer more product than he can deliver. Billy Walsh's latest pitch leaves Drama indignant and Eric intrigued."
