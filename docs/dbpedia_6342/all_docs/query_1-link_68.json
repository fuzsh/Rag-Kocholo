        "text": "Warner Bros’ engrossing 1947 nothing-is-at-it-seems crime thriller Cry Wolf stars Barbara Stanwyck and Errol Flynn, who prove a good team.\n\n‘Next time you hear some odd noise in the night, just follow the memorable custom of your sex and stick your head under the bedclothes.’ – Mark Caldwell to Sandra Marshall.\n\nDirector Peter Godfrey’s engrossing 1947 Warner Bros black and white mystery crime drama thriller Cry Wolf stars Barbara Stanwyck and Errol Flynn, and is based on the novel by Marjorie Carleton. Though just past their prime, the stars prove a good team and the story stays strong and solid.\n\nStanwyck and Flynn enliven this haunted house mystery about a widow called Sandra Marshall (Stanwyck) trying to sort out her supposedly late husband James Demarest (Richard Basehart)’s large spooky country estate, where Mark Caldwell (Flynn) is living. He does not believe her when she tells him she was secretly married to his nephew James, who has just died. But he allows her to stay on at the estate while they search for a missing will. She befriends James’s sister Julie (Geraldine Brooks), one of many, it turns out, among a household of mad folk with awful secrets.\n\nThis nothing-is-at-it-seems thriller is well cast, and full of players who perform strongly. But Catherine Turney’s talky, low-key screenplay and the equally slow-moving direction keep the tension low, and the black comedy that surely would have helped is sadly lacking.\n\nAs so often, Stanwyck is the best thing about it, and it is exciting just for her.\n\nAlso in the cast are Helene Thimig, Jerome Cowan, John Ridgley, Patricia Barry [Patricia White], Rory Mallinson, Paul Stanton, Barry Bernard, John Elliott, Lisa Golm, Jack Mower, Paul Panzer and Creighton Hale.\n\nCry Wolf is directed by Peter Godfrey, runs 83 minutes, is made by Thomson Productions, Warner Bros, is released by Warner Bros, is written by Catherine Turney, based on the novel by Marjorie Carleton, is shot in black and white by Carl E Guthrie, is produced by Jack L Warner (executive producer) and Henry Blanke, is scored by Franz Waxman, and is designed by Carl Jules Weyl.\n\nIt is the last of three collaborations between director Godfrey and Stanwyck, following Christmas in Connecticut (1945) and The Two Mrs Carrolls (1947).\n\nStanwyck was nominated for four Oscars, but never won, though gained an Honorary Award in 1982 for ‘superlative creativity and unique contribution to the art of screen acting’.\n\nWarner Bros bought the film rights of the novel, which was published in January 1945, as a vehicle for Barbara Stanwyck in April 1945. Errol Flynn joined as co star in March 1946, and the movie became a Thomson Production, made through Flynn’s company at Warner Bros. Flynn gives himself top billing.\n\nFilming took place from May 1946 till August 1946. The film was released on 18 July 1947.\n\nThe stars were still very popular, and therefore so was the film. It cost $1,461,000 and earned $2,690,000.\n\nThe cast are Errol Flynn as Mark Caldwell, Barbara Stanwyck as Sandra Marshall, Geraldine Brooks as Julie Demarest, Richard Basehart as James Caldwell Demarest, Jerome Cowan as Senator Charles Caldwell, John Ridgely as Jackson Laidell, Patricia Barry [Patricia White] as Angela, Rory Mallinson as Becket, Helene Thimig as Marta, Paul Stanton as Davenport, Barry Bernard as Roberts, John Elliott, Lisa Golm, Jack Mower, Paul Panzer and Creighton Hale.\n\n© Derek Winnert 2019 Classic Movie Review 8916"
