        "text": "Movie genres or film genres group different movies based on setting, characters, plot, story, tone, styles, syntax, templates, paradigms, motifs, rules, and themes. Sub-genres is a smaller category that may combine different elements from multiple genres. If you want to create your own screenplay, here are 70+ screenplay examples from top Hollywood films.\n\nTo see the effect genres have on viewers, watch how Zootopia has been edited in a way to cover 7 different genres:\n\nThe word “genre” comes from French, where it means “type” or “kind.” We define a particular genre as a type or kind of category of movie or film that has its own recognizable conventions and character types such as:\n\nSetting or Period: When and where the movie takes place including certain stereotypes, props, or icons. Ex:\n\nHorror: Dark places and unexplained things like forests, graveyards, castles, abandoned structures or buildings, locked doors to remove rooms, blood, gore, or killing instruments.\n\nSci-Fi: Outer space or futuristic items like spaceships or laser guns\n\nSports: Sports arenas, teams, athletes, and sports equipment\n\nWar: Different vehicles such as tanks, planes, or realistic battlefields\n\nWesterns: Cattle, stage coaches, saloons, ten-gallon hats, the frontier, or revolvers\n\nCharacters:\n\nComedy: nerds, jocks, token minorities, or friends\n\nCrime: Detectives, gangsters, criminals, fugitives, or inmates\n\nHorror: Zombies, serial killers, or ghosts\n\nSci-Fi: Aliens, monsters, or superheroes\n\nSports: The underdog\n\nWesterns: Cowboys, outlaws, the Sheriff\n\nSubject Matter: Storyline, plots, or themes similar to other movies in the genre\n\nAction: Chase sequences, extended fight scenes, guns, races against time\n\nComedy: Slapstick humor, witty dialogue, rites of passage, gross-out humor, fish-out-of-water, cross-dressing, mistaken identity\n\nCrime: whodunnits, capers, rival gangs, robberies\n\nHorror: urban legends, ghost stories, the “final girl” survivor, paranormal and occult, survival-horror, ‘found footage’\n\nMelodramas: a self-sacrificial maternal figure\n\nMusicals: singing and dancing\n\nRomance: different stages of “falling in love” with a subsequent break-up and reconciliation, true love, fairy tales, forbidden love\n\nSci-Fi: interstellar travel, “space operas”, doomsday, and apocalyptic tales\n\nFilming Techniques and Formats:\n\nCamera Angles: low / high angles\n\nShooting style: hand-held, POV, stationary, or “found footage”\n\nLighting: High-key or low/dark lighting\n\nEditing style: Length of edit, use of jump cuts\n\nCostuming: use of blood, masks, special effects\n\nColor Schemes\n\nMakeup\n\nMusic and Audio: Using sound to enhance or emphasize different characteristics, plots, or create a mood (danger, laughter, adventure, feature, excitement, sensual, etc.)\n\nGenres provide a simple way for movie-makers to produce within a framework and provide an easily marketable product, but may become cliche-ridden and over-imitated. If a traditional genre has been reinterpreted, it may be called revisionist.\n\nGenres typically go through 5 distinct stages throughout cinematic history:\n\nPrimitive: Earliest and most pure genre form where iconography, themes, and patterns develop\n\nClassical or Traditional: Growth, popularity, and solidification of genre with clear characteristics and prototypes\n\nRevisionist: Reinterpretation or questioning of the original genre with greater complexity of themes while keeping many iconographic and characteristic elements\n\nParodic: Mocking or spoofing the genre through over-exaggeration of characters or themes\n\nExtended, Mixed, Hybrids: Blending various genre elements together\n\n(Quick note: When talking about genre, we are referring to movie genres within the realm of narrative movies. Thus, documentary and experimental movies do not constitute genres unto themselves, rather, they are almost entirely different styles of moviemaking. In addition, animated movies are not a genre, but just a different way to make a movie in any genre.)\n\nLet’s now jump into the major movie genres, and explain what makes them distinctive.\n\nAction:\n\nAction movies involve one or more protagonists overcoming non-stop dangerous challenges and include:\n\nPhysical feats\n\nExtended fights\n\nExtensive stunts\n\nFrantic car chases\n\nRescues\n\nBattles\n\nEscapes\n\nCatastrophic disasters – floods, explosions, fires, etc.\n\nAdventure\n\n2 Dimensional ‘good’ heroes / heroines battling it out with ‘bad’ guys\n\nStory and character development are generally secondary. These movies move quickly and have a clear distinction between good and evil. Also, action movies almost always involve a “ticking clock” element to the plot, where the protagonist has to do something (disarm a bomb, save a VIP, etc.) before time runs out.\n\nAudience Expectations:\n\nClear division of good and evil\n\nLots of fighting and set pieces\n\nTypes of Action Movies:\n\nAction- Adventure: Movies in this sub-genre are usually described by a journey with a protagonist in pursuit or search of something in an exotic location. Steven Spielberg’s Indiana Jones franchise is a very good example for this sub-genre. In the movie Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones, an archaeologist was in search of religious artifacts. Other examples include pirate movies, serialized movies, treasure hunts, searches or expeditions for lost continents, jungle / desert epics, gold, hidden maps, traps, and exploration to the unknown.\n\nSuperhero movies: This sub-genre is defined by the heroes having supernatural abilities, and more importantly, using their superpowers for selfless purposes. They battle with villains with similar super-powers. They are usually, but not necessarily, derived from superhero comic books. The Marvel and DC franchises (Superman, Iron man, etc.) are superhero movies derived from comics but The Incredibles is not from a comic.\n\nMartial arts movies: This sub-genre of movies is also called “Wu xia pian”, meaning ‘movies of chivalrous combat’ in Chinese. These movies are defined by values such as duty, brotherhood and honor. A classic example of this movie is Enter the Dragon– starring Bruce Lee, and some Jackie Chan movies like Rumble in the Bronx.\n\nHeroic Bloodshed: This sub-genre focuses on values such as brotherhood, honor, redemption, duty, and protecting the vulnerable. Originally this comes from Hong Kong, but it has been spread internationally since then. An example of this sub-genre would be The Killer.\n\nMilitary Action: Here the sub-genre focuses on the exploits of the military as entertaining versus tragic. Examples of this include movies such as Transformers or the G.I. Joe series.\n\nSpy movies: A trademark of this sub-genre is that a spy usually finds his/herself on a secret mission, typically in an exotic location, and very often using a variety of sophisticated gadgets and equipment to complete their mission. The James Bond series is a good example of this sub-genre.\n\nDisaster movies: This sub-genre of movie is characterized by a large amount of destruction: often from natural-occurring events such as earthquakes, tornadoes, asteroids hitting the earth, etc. The main goal of the protagonist in a disaster movie is to survive. A present-day example is 2012– starring John Kusack.\n\nVideo game movies: These movies’ screenplays have been adapted from well- known video games. They can fall under any genre depending on plot and storyline. For example, the Prince of Persia series.\n\nComedy:\n\nOne of the oldest and most popular genres in movie history, comedy emphasizes humor, designed to make people laugh by exaggerating the situation, relationships, characters, action, or language. Most comedies have happy endings (the exception being Dark comedies).\n\nAudience Expectations:\n\nLight-hearted and fun\n\nRomance stories\n\nEnsemble casts\n\nTypes of Comedies:\n\nSlapstick comedy: The first thing that people connect with this sub-genre of comedy is Charlie Chaplin- one of the pioneers in the silent era. Slapstick goes way back to stage plays and vaudeville, and grew over the years. These movies need little or no conversation and are still popular, with modern-day movies like Jim Carrey’s The Mask and Liar Liar.\n\nRomantic comedy: This sub-genre of movies looks at difficulties arising from a person searching for a new relationship, in humorous situations. Humor in these movies is usually verbal or situation-based. This form of comedy evolved from screwball comedies from the 1930s and 1940s. Some well-known examples of this sub-genre are The Philadelphia Story– starring Katharine Hepburn and How to Lose a Guy in 10 days– starring Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.\n\nAction Comedy: This sub-genre blends action sequences with comic consequences. Some examples are Charlie’s Angels (2000), starring Drew Barrymore and many of Jackie Chan’s movies including The Spy Next Door (2010).\n\nDark Comedy: Also called black comedy, this sub-genre makes fun of serious themes such as war and death. It became popular in the 1940’s and 1950’s after the World War 2. This genre is believed to have helped people cope with serious issues. Stanley Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove is one of the best movies made in this sub-genre.\n\nBuddy Comedy: This sub-genre is defined by 2 individuals who go through a series of humorous events. Examples of this sub-genre would be Rush Hour or Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\n\nRoad Comedy: These movies are defined by humorous situations as the characters go through a journey and meet various other characters along the road. Some examples of this sub-genre are: Dumb and Dumber and Planes, Trains & Automobiles\n\nParody: This sub-genre of movies makes fun or mocks an entire genre of work. A parody mocks a specific piece of entertainment. Filmmakers of this sub-genre assume that audiences understand clichés and use that knowledge to turn conventions on their heads. These types of movies became popular in the 1970s and 1980s. Who framed Roger Rabbit? is an example of this sub-genre.\n\nSpoof: This sub-genre is broader than parody and mocks other genres and typically targets specific pieces of art, entertainment, or collections of movies. Example of movies include The Naked Gun and Not Another Teen Movie.\n\nSatire: Satires are even broader than spoofs and mocks human nature, vices, institutions, and other concepts that might not be in connection to a specific piece of art. Examples include Idiocracy and In The Loop.\n\nSitcom: This sub-genre is defined by a group of people that go through various humorous situations and misunderstandings. Examples of this include Seinfeld and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\n\nSketch Comedy: This sub-genre is defined by a collection of different situations and can include the use of spoof, satire, parody, and many other types of sub-genres. Examples here include Chappelle’s Show and The Whitest Kids U’ Know.\n\nMockumentary: Mockumentaries use the documentary format for satires, spoofs, and parodies. Instead of mocking the format, the format is used to mock. Examples of this include The Office and This Spinal Tap.\n\nPrank: This sub-genre uses a mix of real-life participants who go through a planned event without them knowing. Typically the events are well orchestrated and force foolishness or error from the participant to get a humorous reaction from the audience. Examples include Nathan For You and Borat.\n\nScrewball: This sub-genre is a style of comedy popular in the 1930s and 40s combining farce, slapstick, and witty dialogue and typically involved comedies of remarriage. Examples include My Man Godfrey and The Awful Truth.\n\nHere is an an example of Sketch Comedy:\n\nCrime:\n\nThis plot of movies in this genre is centered on a particular crime or string of criminal activities. Criminal activities in these movies are almost always encouraged. Criminals – robbers, gangsters, murderers and serial killers populate this genre, along with cops, detectives and other law enforcement officials.\n\nAudience Expectations:\n\nGunplay, violence, and ruthless tactics\n\nCourtroom scenes\n\nLaw is seen as either good or bad depending on hero / heroine\n\nHays Code spelled out what is acceptable / unacceptable in movies, often showing the bad guys getting punished for their actions\n\nTypes of Crime Films:\n\nGangster movies: These movies dive into the world of organized crime. They glorify the activities gangsters engage themselves in. This sub-genre of movies has been popular since the concept of cinema. Goodfellas, The Godfather trilogy, and Scarface are quintessential examples of the gangster movie.\n\nPrison movies: This sub-genre of movies delves into the harsh living conditions of prisoners. Some movies may also show hardships faced by ex-convicts adjusting to life outside of prison. The audience is directed to sympathize with the inmate who generally was wrongly convicted. Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are examples of this sub-genre.\n\nCrime-comedy movies: This genre-hybrid sees criminals carry out criminal activities, but the events that transpire are presented humorously. Frequently in these movies, the criminals get away with the loot! But the brains behind the criminal act normally end up in some trouble that they had not anticipated. A Fish called Wanda is an example of this sub-genre.\n\nDetective / Hardboiled movies: Commonly called “Whodunnits”, this sub-genre of movies follow detectives and the methodology used to solve crime. Murder on the Orient Express (1974), based on the book written by Agatha Christie, is a good example of this sub-genre.\n\nCaper: This sub-genre focuses on a group of criminals who set out on a heist or job. Typically these movies are less serious and often humorous versus other crime genres. Examples include Ocean’s Eleven or Baby Driver.\n\nHeist: Heists are defined by criminals who try to steal something valuable and typically are more serious versus a Caper. Examples include Heat and The Score.\n\nCop (Police): This sub-genre follows a street cop (not a detective) who has to deal with crime and criminals. Examples include End of Watch and Beverly Hills Cop.\n\nCourtroom: This genre requires that the majority of the story supports events that are connected to a court case. Examples of this include A Time to Kill and A Few Good Men.\n\nHorror:\n\nThis very popular genre of movies is characterized by the ability to shock or scare the viewer with gruesome or scary visuals for entertainment purposes. The main characteristic of horror is scary visuals appear when the audience least expects it. Sound effects add to the fear factor in these movies. Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining is a very famous movie in this genre.\n\nAudience Expectations:\n\nSupernatural beings such as haunted houses, ghosts, vampires, etc.\n\nTypes of Horror Films:\n\nNatural Horror: This sub-genre of movies deals with animals, insects, and other element of nature who turn into cold-blooded killers.

Sometimes the vampires are the protagonist to build sympathy versus terror. Examples include Near Dark and Nosferatu.\n\nOccult: Occult movies use paranormal themes and spiritual realities that go beyond scientific observation to add horror elements.

Examples include The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity.\n\nZombie: Zombie movies typically involve a group of characters trying to survive a world that has been taken over by large amounts of zombies.

Examples include Ready or Not and The Ninth Gate.\n\nThrillers:\n\nAt their core, thrillers seek to create suspense and elicit excitement out of the audience. Thrillers seek to induce anxiety in the viewer to keep them on the edge of their seat. Ridley Scott, Alfred Hitchcock and Martin Scorcese are some of the famous directors of this genre. After World War II, these movies became dark. Some iconic examples are: Silence of the Lambs– starring Anthony Hopkins and Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo.\n\nAudience Expectations:\n\nHeart pumping action that triggers suspense, surprise, anticipation, and anxiety within the audience\n\nPsychological Thrillers: These movies are dark thrillers that are centered on the psyche of people. Generally, these characters have mental health disorders and usually develop these as a result of any form of abuse as a child. A very famous example is Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho – in this movie, Norman Bates is the owner of a motel, who suffers from dissociative identity disorder- it means that he assumes 2 different identities (the other being his mother “Norma”). He was abused as a child, and as a result, developed this illness, and goes on a killing spree when he fell in love with the female lead of the movie.\n\nConspiracy Thrillers: This sub-genre is centered on protagonists investigating issues which lead them to a conspiracy they need to solve. Classic examples are: The Da Vinci Code– starring Tom Hanks, based on the book of the same name by Dan Brown. A branch of this sub-genre is the Legal Thriller sub-genre. An example of a legal thriller is Primal Fear.\n\nCrime Thrillers: This is a blend of the traditional elements of the “Crime” and “Thriller” genres. These movies focus on criminal activity like murders and robberies and deal with serial killers too. They also work with action to bring in suspense. An example of this is No Country for Old Men.\n\nSupernatural Thrillers: A combination of Sci-Fi and Fantasy, these movies appeal to the audience because they are very much out of the ordinary. Supernatural thrillers draw on elements of the paranormal, such as ghost stories and vampires. M. Night Shyamalan’s movies such as the Sixth Sense are classic examples of this sub-genre of movies.\n\nMystery: Mysteries are often similar to the crime sub-genre, but do not always use law enforcement as main characters. These are typically defined by the plot and the character’s relationship with the motivations and reality behind the occurring events. Examples include Knives Out and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\n\nTechno: This sub-genre takes place often using sophisticated technology as a differentiating format. Examples of movies include The Matrix and Ex Machina.\n\nFilm Noir: Film Noir is sometimes seen as more of a style versus a genre, however crime typically has a strong presence in the movies.

In the recent past, some of these movies have incorporated a dark plot and subplot. Some famous examples are: Beauty and the Beast and Maleficent.\n\nUrban fantasy: This has fantasy elements incorporated in an urban setting and is quite a popular sub-genre. This can be in a real or fictional setting, but the story must focus on what happens in an urban environment. Some examples of this sub-genre are Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Ghostbusters.\n\nContemporary Fantasy: This subgenre introduces fantasy elements, but in the current time period. Examples include the Harry Potter Franchise and The Chronicles of Narnia\n\nDark Fantasy: Dark Fantasy is a sub-genre where elements of fantasy are added into a hostile world. Examples include Solomon Kane and Pan’s Labyrinth.\n\nHigh Fantasy: This sub-genre is also referred to as epic fantasy, adds elements of fantasy to a fictional setting typically including mythical creatures, battles, and romance. Examples include The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and Game of Thrones.\n\nMyth: This sub-genre is defined as a story that typically plays a fundamental role in how society developed – such as the origin story for humanity / existence. Characters may include gods, demigods, and supernatural humans and stories are typically using the The Hero’s Journey theory by Joseph Campbell. Examples include The Monkey King and Hercules.\n\nSword and Sorcery Movies: This genre combines elements from other epic and heroic fantasies with a focus on swords and magic. Examples include Conan and the Barbarian and Masters of the Universe.\n\nScience-Fiction:\n\nAlso known as Sci-Fi, this genre is very popular and plays well to the ‘Suspension of Disbelief .’ A movie can be categorized into this genre if the plot looks into one or more of these topics: Speculative fiction, technology, space travel and futuristic ideologies.\n\nScience fiction movies have been around since the dawn of the movie industry, with George Méliès A Trip to the Moon being the first true global blockbuster in 1902. With the advent of new computer technology, special effects became of utmost priority in these movies. Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan and James Cameron are famous directors of this genre. Some famous examples of movies are ET: The Extra Terrestrial and the Star Wars franchise.\n\nAudience Expectations:\n\nHeroes\n\nAliens\n\nFar away planets\n\nImpossible quests\n\nFantastic places\n\nFuturistic technology\n\nImprobable settings\n\nUnknown forces\n\nUnknowable Forces\n\nExtraordinary monsters\n\nMad scientists\n\nNuclear war\n\nTypes of Science Fiction:\n\nSpace travel: This sub-genre of movies deals with adventures, battles and drama that occurs in outer space. It goes back to the silent era with George Méliès’ movie “Le voyage dans la Lune (English: A trip to the Moon) in 1902. A modern-day example of a space travel movie is The Martian (2015).\n\nTime travel: A very intriguing aspect of Sci-Fi, this can stand by itself as a separate genre. But nowadays, it is mostly a tool that helps in building plots and sub-plots for movies. As the name suggests, these movies can take you back or forward in time. A good example of a time travel movie is X-Men: Days of Future Past.\n\nTech Noir: This sub-genre combines the practices of Film Noir (dark movies) and Sci-Fi. Film Noir is a technique of movie making that is defined by pessimism and a cynical approach to life. Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner is a good example of a Tech Noir movie.\n\nRobot/Monster movies: Robot movies can be put under many sub-genres, but they are categorized, by and large, into Sci-Fi. Ultimately, in the end of each movie in this sub-genre, there is always a show-down between man and robot or man and monster. A good example is Jurassic Park.\n\nSci-Fi Adventure: This sub-genre deals with exciting stories about creatures like aliens, robots and other creatures related to this genre. An example is Wall-E.\n\nMilitary Sci-Fi: This sub-genre is centered on military-related fights but in a futuristic setting. An example is Edge of Tomorrow.\n\nApocalyptic: This sub-genre is based around the effects and struggle from an apocalyptic event. Dystopian stories will typically have some sort of large war or apocalyptic event as well as a centralized government that was formed afterwards. Apocalyptic movies typically do not feature a centralized government. Examples include: 28 Days Later and 12 Monkeys.\n\nUtopian: Utopian movies are defined by the creator’s view of an ideal world that is without struggle with peace, harmony, and a world without homelessness or hunger being key themes.
