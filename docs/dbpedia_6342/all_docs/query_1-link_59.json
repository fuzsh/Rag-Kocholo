        "text": "Less than 10 minutes into Cry Wolf, Sandra Demarest (Barbara Stanwyck) announces to her deceased husband's sinister uncle (Mark Caldwell, played by Errol Flynn) that \"I am not a placid girl.\" Like everyone who has ever seen Barbara Stanwyck in anything would do, the already smitten Mark responds with \"No. You're not.\"\n\nIt's an assertion that could have been the motto of roughly 90% of Stanwyck's characters, and one to which she energetically lives up throughout this fairly silly movie, climbing into dumbwaiters, traversing roofs, sparring (and flirting) with Mark, and refusing to give up and leave a house that increasingly feels like some sort of gothic murder palace. She's frightfully competent and unyielding in her refusal to give way…\n\n“I wonder if you have any idea what it is to live in the shadow of insanity?”\n\nOf the three Peter Godfrey-Barbara Stanwyck collaborations, Cry Wolf has the most fluid visual style. Christmas in Connecticut is visually conservative, as befitting most comedies of its era, and The Two Mrs. Carrolls is much darker, though more predictably than is Cry Wolf, a gothic noir.\n\nSandra Marshall Demarest (Stanwyck) arrives at the remote estate of scientist Mark Caldwell (Errol Flynn) to announce she is the widow of Caldwell’s recently deceased nephew, James Demarest (Richard Basehart). Sandra and James had a marriage of convenience so that he could inherit $2 million and so that she could get the $2,000 necessary to complete her…\n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere of this very much. And I enjoyed seeing Barbara Stanwyck and Errol Flynn together, I thought they did well together. But the way mental illness was treated/discussed/handled (“They should never be allowed to marry or have children” was said before there were any symptoms because there was mental illness in their bloodline?) was a bit bothersome. I’d watch it again though, it was especially fun watching Stany climb over fences and along rooftops!\n\n\"I don't know what plans you have in that devious feminine mind of yours.\" - Mark Caldwell,\n\n- Stanwyck: boxd.it/gCaUO\n\nErrol Flynn is a pretty cool actor.... I deem him \"Barbara Worthy.\"\n\nI've been on a pretty boring Stanwyck streak lately but color me surprised by how much I enjoyed this short dramatic thriller. Flynn and Stanwyck have great chemistry, the premise is interesting, the pacing is good, and the script is interesting though occasionally dated.\n\nIt's pretty fun for people into thrillers from the olden times.\n\nSort of a soft horror movie. Lots of menacing shots of Stanwyck moving around. Flynn's casting is intriguing in how it plays up some of his harsher qualities (most would describe him as cast against type but it is more like a flip side of his persona). Good mood. Stronger when it can suggest ambiguity. Terrible ending.\n\nOn paper, this sounds kind of exciting: Barbara Stanwyck, following the death of her husband, goes to the house of his uncle, Errol Flynn, who is hiding something really big. Sadly, it never reaches any real potential.\n\nAll it really has to stand out is that it's the only time the two aforementioned icons appeared on screen together. This too is not enough, as when they are together, they lack any real believable chemistry, which definitely hurts when it comes to movies like this, especially when they clash. The thrills are minimal, the story feels tired, and the ending is just awful. Still, it was nice to see Barbara Stanwyck and Errol Flynn (and in a modern setting!) give solid performances, as per usual, even if they don't quite work together. Sadly, with so much working against it and so few strengths, I can't say this is really worth a watch, even for fans of such legends.\n\nA very tense and atmospheric thriller that I really loved right up until the lacklustre ending that kinda let me down. It just felt like they made a great film but didn’t know how to finish it in the same way. That aside I loved Barbara Stanwyck as she played her usual strong willed and determined characters and I think she gave a solid performance. As for Errol Flynn it was interesting to see him in a different role than I’m use to and I quite enjoyed his more dark and mysterious side."
