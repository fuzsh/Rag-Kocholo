        "text": "**Update April 2010** The Commission published a user-friendly guide to the College of Commissioners for Citizens in its “Easy Reading Corner.” This brochure provides a brief insight into the work of the European Commission. It presents all of the Commissioners, their policy portfolios and the priorities they have set out for their five-year terms of office.\n\nOn Friday 27 November the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, announced the nominations for the new European Commissioners. The portfolio for Health and Consumers has been allocated to the Maltese Commissioner-designate, John Dalli. This guide will give a short biography of all the Commissioners-designate and further explain John Dalli’s background.\n\n**Update April 2010**\n\nIn April 2010, the Commission published a brochure on the College of Commissioners. The guide “The European Commission 2010–14 Profiles and priorities” provides an explanation of the work of the Commission, the mandate of the College of Commissions, gives a short biography of every commissioner and provides the priorities of each commissioner according to the commitments made during the EP hearings. This guide is made specifically for citizens, and tries to reach them through not using jargon or overly technical language.\n\n“The European Commission 2010–14 Profiles and priorities”is available here.\n\nJosé Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission for a second mandate, published his manifesto entitled “Political guidelines for the next Commission”.\n\nPresident Barroso put forward 5 policy priorities:\n\n– Making a successful exit from the crisis;\n\n– Leading on climate change;\n\n– Boosting the new sources of growth and social cohesion;\n\n– Advancing people’s Europe;\n\n– Opening a new Era for Global Europe.\n\nThe document only includes few references to health:\n\n– The growth potential for “white jobs” (in health care and social services for children and the elderly);\n\n– “The changes that are taking place in our society will also bring\n\ndemand for new services and thus new jobs. For example, with the ageing of our population there will be a need to give a boost to the overall development of the social and health services’ sector, for instance by establishing a quality framework for public and social services, thus recognising their importance in the European model of society”;\n\n– Innovation and ehealth are mentioned;\n\n– Barroso recognizes ageing as a key challenge and insists on “the need to have healthy, fulfilling longer life spans. This also requires a thriving economy to supply sound public finances, so that we can pay for healthcare for the elderly”\n\n– The EU’s commitment to achieve the Millennium Development Goals is repeated.\n\nTo read the full document, please click [here->\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/pdf/press_20090903_EN.pdf]\n\nPresident Barroso will met with the chairs of the seven political groups in the European Parliament in order to present his programme. The groups had previously elaborated lists of political demands to the attention of the candidate for the position of President of the European Commission:\n\nPriorities of the EPP Group\n\nOn 16 November 2009, the EPP group (Christian Democrats) formulated five political “demands” the next Commission should respect:\n\n– 1. A Europe that upholds its values: defend human dignity, tolerance,freedom and peace. Promote a more responsible society based on the family and the community and respectful of the environment.\n\nThe Commission should defend a strengthened solidarity between citizens, generations and the Member States.\n\nThe Commissioners should however focus on a Europe based on the individual, and defend the free market economy with respect for subsidiarity.\n\n– 2. A more secure Europe\n\n– 3. A Europe of research and innovation\n\n– 4. A Europe founded on sustainable growth based on reforms faithful to the principles of a social market economy, which are freedom, solidarity and responsibility. This includes a focus on the protection of the environment and the well-being of citizens.\n\n– 5. A stronger Europe: on the external stage, a clear international ambition and a firm commitment; on the internal stage the consolidation of Europe, the provision of the means for its ambitions and the development of own resources.\n\nThe EPP group has not yet formulated more detailed priorities for cross-sector policies, including health.\n\nPriorities of the ALDE Group\n\nOn 15 December the ALDE group (liberals) released a detailed Strategic Programme 2009-2014, along five main priorities:\n\n– tackling the economic and financial crisis by a sustainable recovery,\n\n– rethinking the budget and introducing real own resources, tackling\n\n– climate change seriously with an environmentally integrated society, fighting for freedom and\n\n– fundamental rights and promoting a coherent Europe strategy in the world.\n\nHealth priorities\n\nIn the area of health the ALDE group highlighted the following priorities:\n\n– the proposed directive on Patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare must not be watered down by Member States.\n\n– European patients’ rights in general should be strengthened with an overall goal of guaranteeing equal access to safe and high-quality health services and treatment for all citizens. Therefore the Commission should resist the Council’s attempts to block the directive on information to patients.\n\n– More coherence of EU policies is needed in the field of environmental health (considering climate change and new forms of environmental pollution) and the impact of food quality on human health. The latter should be addressed in an integrated way, involving other policy areas such as the CAP, research policy and the internal market.\n\n– Addressing the wider factors determining health, and strengthening measures to prevent disease and health risks should be key elements of a sustained and reinforced EU public health strategy. The inclusion of health concerns into all EU policies should be reinitiated. A smoke-free environment in all public and work places should be an objective for the Commission.\n\n– Focus on health literacy should be part of a comprehensive and coherent strategy for health at EU level.\n\n– The impact of ageing on public health and healthcare systems and the fight against health inequalities should be given high priority in EU health policies\n\n– Following the transfer of pharmaceutical policy to the health portfolio, and given the new powers in this field provided by the Lisbon Treaty, the Commission should develop a strong health policy with the full integration of medicinal products.\n\nOther political groups\n\nThe S&D (centre-left), and Greens/EFA groups outlined the following priorities in the context of the reelection of Jose Manuel Barroso as European Commission President in September 2009.\n\n– List of key demands from the S&D\n\n– List of key demands from ALDE\n\n– List of key demands from the Greens\n\nBarroso announced the portfolios responsibilities for the next Commission which includes the following Commissioner-designates[biographical indications are taken from the European Parliament’s [website ]]:\n\n– John DALLI (Malta): Health and Consumer Policy.\n\n” Born in 1948, he studied to become a Chartered Accountant.
