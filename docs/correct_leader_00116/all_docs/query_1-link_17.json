        "text": "The EU's ethics watchdog on Thursday asked the European Commission to reassess whether its former president is breaking EU rules in his new job at Goldman Sachs.\n\nJosé Manuel Barroso, who was president of the Commission from 2004 to 2014, sparked concerns about potential conflicts of interest when he took a job at Goldman Sachs in 2016. Barroso promised at the time that he would not lobby the Commission in his new position, and the Commission's internal ethics committee ruled that his new job did not merit losing his EU pension or entitlements.\n\nBarroso's promise \"has now been put in doubt,\" European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly said, by a meeting that took place between Barroso and Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen in late 2017 to discuss trade and defense issues.\n\nAlthough it was registered as a meeting with Goldman Sachs in Katainen's meeting list, both parties said it was personal and of a private nature.\n\n\"Any meetings I may have with EU officials are in my personal capacity,\" Barroso said in a letter dated March 12, seen by POLITICO, in which he responds to the Ombudsman's report. \"I have recused myself from representing the bank in any interactions with EU officials.\"\n\n\"I stand by the assurances I have given to the Commission; I have not and will not engage in any lobbying activity with the European institutions on behalf of Goldman Sachs,\" he wrote, adding that he viewed O'Reilly's recommendations as \"a thinly veiled ad personam political attack.\"\n\n\"Putting the matter to the Ethics Committee once more would demonstrate that the Commission has taken very seriously public concern over this affair and the damage done to the image of the EU institutions — despite the hard work and ethical behaviour of the vast majority of people who work in them,” O'Reilly said.\n\nThe Ombudsman also recommended that the Commission consider extending the requirements for how long its former president must abstain from lobbying the Commission.\n\nO'Reilly's next major Commission human resources challenge will be to assess the controversial appointment of Martin Selmayr as Commission secretary-general. The Ombudsman's office has received two formal complaints about his appointment, it said earlier this week.\n\nThe EU's anti-fraud office, OLAF, has already cleared Barroso of potential breaches of EU conflict of interest rules. An investigation \"did not establish any evidence of wrongdoings on your part,\" OLAF wrote in a letter to Barroso dated October 4, 2107 and obtained by POLITICO.\n\nOLAF reached its conclusion after a nine-month investigation into whether the former Commission president “undertook relevant initiatives to engage in a contractual relationship with GS [Goldman Sachs] during his mandate;” “acted in violations of relevant duties of transparency;” and “may have found himself in a situation of conflict of interest when dealing with GS during his mandate.”\n\nAs part of the probe, the OLAF office reviewed documents about two of Barroso’s trips while Commission chief — one to New York in September 2013 and another to the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2014. Two further meetings between Goldman Sachs and Barroso, in May 2012 and October 2014, were also scrutinized.\n\nOLAF also reviewed correspondence between the president’s private office and Goldman Sachs, and conducted interviews with his former head and deputy head of Cabinet.\n\n\"OLAF can confirm that, in October 2017, it concluded an investigation into possible breaches of the European Commission's Code of Conduct by former Commission President Barroso relating to his appointment at Goldman Sachs. OLAF did not establish any evidence of wrongdoings on the part of former President Barroso and the investigation was concluded without recommendations for action to be taken,\" the OLAF Press Office said."
