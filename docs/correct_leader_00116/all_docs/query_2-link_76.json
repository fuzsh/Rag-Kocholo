        "text": "Tallinn, Stenbock House, 20 December 2007 – Today, Prime Minister Andrus Ansip met with José Manuel Durão Barroso, President of the European Commission, at Stenbock House. During the one-hour meeting, energy and climate issues, European Neighbourhood Policy and expectations towards the Lisbon Treaty were discussed.\n\nAccording to Ansip, the ending year has been good for both Estonia and the European Union as a whole. He expressed his satisfaction over the signing of the Lisbon Treaty, hoping that the Treaty will be ratified by all Member States of the European Union next year.\n\n“The Lisbon Treaty strengthens the European Union, and a strong European Union is only for our own good. I hope the Riigikogu will ratify this in the first half of next year,” said Ansip.\n\nWhen discussing energy and climate issues, the Prime Minister welcomed the activity of the European Commission in the field of energy policy and appreciated the close communication of the Committee with Member States.\n\n“We are interested in a common energy market being formed in Europe,” said Ansip. “Estonia generally supports the internal market energy package of the European Commission. This brings us closer to greater energy security and solidarity in the Union”.\n\nAccording to the Prime Minister, Estonia supports the greater role of the Commission in opening and regulating the internal market of the European Union and supervision of investments originating from third countries. Ansip also recognised proposals for the development of regional electricity markets as very positive.\n\nBarroso, in turn, recognised Estonia’s readiness to increase the use of renewable energy in final consumption. “European Union Member States have set up ambitious goals for increasing the proportion of renewable energy. This must be appreciated. I am sure that Estonia can achieve its goal,” said Barroso.\n\nIn their discussion, Andrus Ansip separately raised the issue of Georgia and Moldova, stressing the need to provide more support to the reform processes in these countries within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy. According to Ansip, it is very important that the next presidencies and the European Commission would continue the development of the Neighbourhood Policy and fast implementation of the resolutions made so far.\n\nBarroso agreed with the position of Ansip and was glad that Estonia regards it important to support Georgia and Moldova. He added that these countries still need to do a lot of homework.\n\nAt the meeting, Prime Minister Ansip and European Commission President Barroso discussed public support of the European Union as well. They were both glad that the support of the inhabitants of Estonia for the European Union is one of the highest in Europe, according to various surveys.\n\nGovernment Communications Office"
