        "text": "Nine former European commissioners who left office a year ago this week have gone through the ‘revolving door’ into problematic roles in big business, or other organisations with links to big business, according to a report released today. “The revolving doors spin again - Barroso II commissioners join the corporate sector” by Corporate Europe Observatory and LobbyControl highlights cases which raise fears about the close relationship between the Commission and corporate interests and calls for strict rules to prevent conflicts of interest.\n\nThe report examines cases such as ex-commissioner (and now MEP) Viviane Reding's position on the boards of Agfa Gevaert, and the Bertelsmann Foundation , Neelie Kroes's advisory position at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and former TTIP commissioner Karel De Gucht's proposed board membership at Belgacom/Proximus also come under the spotlight. Meanwhile, former Commission President José Manuel Barroso has taken on new roles at the corporate lobby-fests of the European Business Summit and Bilderberg Conference and is the busiest former commissioner with 22 notified new roles.\n\nYou can check the revolving door moves of all former commissioners here on this spreadsheet.\n\n“Our research on the ex-members of the second Barroso Commission, shows that the revolving door rules remain inadequate and poorly implemented . The close relationship between the EU executive and the corporations it regulates leaves the door wide open to corporate capture and potential conflicts of interest. At least eight of the roles taken up by former commissioners should have been rejected outright by the Commission while others reveal a cavalier attitude to the risk that corporate interests could gain significant benefit from the recruitment of former commissioners to a variety of paid and unpaid roles,” said CEO researcher Vicky Cann."
