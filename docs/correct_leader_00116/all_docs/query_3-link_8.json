It will also include a high-level debate with European political leaders about the 2014 European elections. The event will bring together over 800 participants including members of the CoR and of national, regional and local parliaments and councils, stakeholders from the Greek civil society, representatives of associations and experts from the EU institutions.\n\nThe Summit will start on Friday (7.3.2014) with a session about Europe’s strategy for growth and jobs from a local and regional perspective. Besides the CoR President Ramón Luis Valcárcel Siso and Attica Governor Yannis Sgouros, several high-level speakers confirmed their participation, including EIB President Werner Hoyer, Greek Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos and Greek Minister for the Interior, Yiannis Michelakis.\n\nThe second Summit day, on Saturday (8.3.2014), includes a debate about the forthcoming European elections, the future of the EU and the role of local government in bringing Europe closer to its citizens. Greek Prime Minister, Antonis Samaras, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso will participate.\n\nThe organisation of the Summit is supported by the Greek Presidency of the Council of the EU, the Information Office of the European Parliament in Athens and the European Commission Representation in Greece. The Summit will take place at the Megaron Athens Concert Hall.\n\nRegistration is open until 20 February 2014. For more information, visit the CoR webpage"
