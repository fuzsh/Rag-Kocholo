        "text": "The Prime Minister met with the President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy and President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso this morning.\n\nThe meeting lasted around 30 to 35 minutes and was the first bilateral of the day. The Prime Minister set out our position that while the latest proposals were a step in the right direction they did not go far enough and that we think more can be done to rein in spending.\n\nHe also set out the UK’s position on the rebate that it was fully justified and we did not support any changes.\n\nIt was clear that there was a long way to go before we had a deal that reflected the difficult decisions being taken by member states.\n\nAs the Prime Minister said this morning: “we are going to be negotiating very hard for a good deal for Britain’s taxpayers and Europe’s taxpayers and to keep the British rebate."
