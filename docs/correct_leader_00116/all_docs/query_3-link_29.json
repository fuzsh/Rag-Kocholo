        "text": "Why Barroso might be feeling unappreciated.\n\nThe working life of a European Commission president does not contain many light moments, so for José Manuel Barroso a visit to the new European School at Laeken, north Brussels, should have been an unalloyed pleasure.\n\nTrue, the official opening ceremony on 24 October was also attended by the Belgian monarch, Albert, and his wife, Queen Paola, and might have awakened memories of the difficult negotiations with the Belgian government over the location of the school and its (much delayed) opening. On the other hand, schoolchildren are essentially more fun than members of the European Parliament or the European Council, and Barroso likes playing the teacher.\n\nHowever, what Barroso did not tell the children was that he was in the middle of a spat with John Dalli, whose resignation he had accepted the previous week.\n\nBy one of life’s little ironies, Dalli’s temporary replacement, Maroš Šefcovic, who has taken on the health dossier in addition to his own responsibilities for administration, was also attending the school opening ceremony and was watching the European flag being run up the pole in the middle of playground (it is an old cadet parade ground). Even while Barroso was smiling with the children, his office was releasing an open letter to Dalli in which he rejected Malta’s ex-commissioner’s accusations that he had been mistreated, told him that the resignation was “irrevocable” and warned him to “behave with integrity”.\n\nThe next day Barroso headed off to Africa in search of people who appreciate him more, on a four-day trip to Côte d’Ivoire, Benin and Cape Verde."
