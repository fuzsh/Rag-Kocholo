The conference will provide an important opportunity for European university rectors to discuss state-of-the-art issues in the European Higher Education Area, as well as celebrating the 25th anniversary of the European Capitals of Culture Programme, with the city of Pécs designated as a European Capital of Culture 2010.\n\nPresident Barroso will participate in the opening ceremony of the conference (starting 10.00), and will deliver a plenary address alongside fellow keynote speakers József Bódis, Rector of the University of Pécs and Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary.\n\nThe Rectors' Conference will continue throughout the day, with plenary sessions on 'University and Society', 'International Education', and 'Science and Social Responsibility'.\n\nMeanwhile, President Barroso will hold a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Orbán at 11.00 following his participation in the conference.\n\nSpokesperson\n\nRIBEIRO DA SILVA Leonor\n\n+32 (0)2 298 81 55\n\nEmail\n\nPerson In Charge\n\nGyöngyi Pozsgai - International Organizations Office- University of Pecs\n\n+36 72 501-500/2418\n\nEmail\n\nRelated Links\n\nExpanding Europe: Background\n\nExpanding Europe: Programme\n\nRegistration\n\nPecs Information\n\nPresident Barroso\n\nThe European Commission is the executive body of the EU and runs its day-to-day business. It is made up of the College of Commissioners, 27 European Commissioners, one for each member state, who are each responsible for one or several policy areas. In addition, the 'Commission' also refers to the entire administrative body that supports the Commissioners, consisting of the Directorates-General and the Services.\n\nThe European Commission is the sole EU body capable of proposing new legislation. The Commission also performs an oversight function, monitoring whether European legislation is properly implemented in the member states. In the event of non-compliance, the Commission can coerce a member state to comply by starting a legal procedure at the European Court of Justice."
