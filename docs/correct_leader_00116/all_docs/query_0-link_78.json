        "text": "Lisbon, Portugal – Former Portuguese Prime Minister and President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, inspired both the Signium team and a group of Lisbon business leaders, as he talked about collaboration in today’s uncertain geopolitical environment. Mr. Barroso remains on the global stage as Chairman of Goldman Sachs and he described the current international environment from a position of current as well as past understanding. His 20-minute talk was followed by an hour of wide-ranging discussion with the audience covering issues from Brexit to the Middle East and from the leaders who have most inspired Mr. Barroso to some of the challenges we face in an uncertain world.\n\nSignium’s global Chairman described the outcome of the conference in very positive language, ‘Signium is building for the future by collaborating globally and bringing innovative thinking to the market through our offices in key business cities. It was a privilege and inspiring to hear someone of Mr. Barroso’s experience and stature describe in optimistic terms the opportunities for those with a global outlook prepared to work together and understand each other’s different perspectives.’\n\nAbout Signium\n\nSignium is one of the world’s leading executive search and leadership consulting firms with an extensive history dating back to the 1950s with offices in key business cities around the globe. We look beyond the qualifications and background of an individual candidate to consider culture fit and client values, something we call the application of “intelligence and intuition.” With local passion, knowledge, and a partner-led approach, we advise senior business leaders on developing their skills, their people, and their organizations."
