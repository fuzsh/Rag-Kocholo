        "text": "France has called on the former head of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, not to take up a job advising US bank Goldman Sachs on Brexit.\n\nFrench Europe Minister Harlem Desir called the move \"scandalous\" and said it raised questions about the EU's conflict of interest rules.\n\nEx-commissioners are free to take up a new role 18 months after leaving.\n\nDespite accepting the job after 20 months, Mr Barroso has come under fire for ignoring the spirit of the rules.\n\nMr Desir drew attention to the ill-timing of the job with Goldman Sachs.\n\n\"It's a mistake on the part of Mr Barroso and the worst disservice that a former Commission president could do to the European project at a moment in history when it needs to be supported and strengthened,\" he told the French parliament, referring to Europe's shock after Britain voted to leave the EU on 23 June.\n\nThe bank hired Mr Barroso as an adviser and non-executive chairman of its international business, with a brief of advising the bank on the consequences of Brexit.\n\nMr Barroso has said he hopes to bring his EU experience to bear as the bank's London operation deals with Britain's imminent negotiation of withdrawal from the EU.\n\nIn his new role, Mr Barroso will be able to draw on his intimate knowledge of the EU and have access to many officials and politicians he worked with at the European Commission."
