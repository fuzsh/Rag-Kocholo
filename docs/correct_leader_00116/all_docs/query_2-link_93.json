        "text": "EUOBSERVER / BRUSSELS - European Socialists remain in disarray over whether to support Jose Manuel Barroso for a second term in office following a three-hour discussion with the European Commission president today (9 September).\n\nMartin Schulz, head of the parliament's Socialists group, emerged from the meeting to face a barrage of cameras and journalists but refused to give a definitive position of the group, whose support will be key to Mr Barroso getting re-elected next week.\n\n\"I personally will not vote for him,\" said the German politician but admitted he is having trouble finding a unified line among his 184 strong-group, the second largest in the EU assembly.\n\nHe said, he would try to \"convince\" his group \"not to be split\" when it takes its final position on the Barroso question next Tuesday evening (15 September).\n\nIn a reference to Britain and Spain, he pointed out that some MEPs in his group belong to parties who support Mr Barroso. \"I must take into account that seven Socialist prime ministers supported this man,\" he added.\n\nAdding spice to the Socialist power mix is the fact that they have to use their voting leverage to win concessions on portfolios for future commissioners or policy issues because some social democratic governments - such as Austria and Spain - are not expected to send Socialist commissioners to Brussels.\n\n\"The number of Socialist commissioners in the commission will not be very high, but the influence of my group by the commission building is high and this we will use to increase as much as possible influence on the composition of the commission and the programme,\" said Mr Schulz.\n\nWhile he continued to avoid a commitment on the part of the group, others were less circumspect.\n\nAbstention or no vote\n\nPoul Nyrup Rasmussen, the head of the European Socialist Party, said the group had no choice but to go for \"either abstention or a no vote.\"\n\nHe criticised Mr Barroso for not committing to \"a new employment initiative\" or to \"reforming the workers directive\", a controversial law governing the rights of workers abroad\n\n\"On the financial market, he [Mr Barroso] said some general things but he didn't assure us that he is ready to close the loopholes in his directive on hedgefunds and private equity,\" Poul Nyrup Rasmussen added.\n\nOn the floor among MEPs milling around after the meeting the message was mixed. Portuguese Socialists indicated Mr Barroso would get a majority while some Slovenians felt they would go against him.\n\nFor his part, Mr Barroso said he was confident of getting the support of many left-wing MEPs.\n\n\"In my perception there is going to be a significant number of Socialist deputies that will vote in my favour. Yes, that is honestly my conviction,\" he said following the meeting.\n\nThe next stage in the re-nomination saga which has been the talk of Brussels for several weeks will take place Thursday (9 September) when the political leaders decide whether to put the Barroso candidacy to vote next week\n\nIf, as expected, they agree to do so, the vote will take place on Wednesday 16 September. The ballot is secret, adding to the uncertainty of the result.\n\nMr Barroso can be sure of the support of the centre-right EPP group, which has 265 MEPs, and the anti-federalist European Conservatives and Reformists. The direction of the Liberal group, as third biggest group, remains unclear while the Greens are expected to vote against him.\n\nA simply majority of those present in the room would secure a second innings in the commission but it is generally agreed that an absolute majority of the 736 MEPs would give Mr Barroso more political clout."
