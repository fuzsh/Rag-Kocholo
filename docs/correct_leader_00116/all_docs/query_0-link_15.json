        "text": "Goldman Sachs International announced the appointment of José Manuel Barroso as non-executive chairman of Goldman Sachs International (GSI). He will also be an advisor to Goldman Sachs.\n\nMr. Barroso served as president of the European Commission from 2004 to 2014, and as prime minister of Portugal from 2002 to 2004.\n\nHe told the Financial Times that he will do what he can to “mitigate the negative effects” of the Brexit decision. If the UK loses access to the EU single market, US banks may need to move big parts of their large European businesses out of London.\n\n“Of course I know well the EU, I also know relatively well the UK environment,” Mr. Barroso said. “If my advice can be helpful in this circumstance I’m ready to contribute, of course.”\n\nHaving first been elected to the Portuguese Parliament in 1985, José Manuel served as state secretary for home affairs, state secretary for foreign affairs and cooperation, and minister for foreign affairs in successive governments. In 1999, he was elected president of the Social Democratic Party and became the leader of the opposition. Prior to his political career, José Manuel’s academic positions included visiting professor at Georgetown University. Most recently, he was Frederick H. Schultz Class of 1951 visiting professor of International Economic Policy and a policy fellow at the Liechtenstein Institute, Woodrow Wilson School, at Princeton University. He is also visiting professor at the Catolica University in Lisbon and at the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute of International Relations in the same city.\n\nMr. Barroso has been awarded numerous honorary degrees and has received more than 60 decorations, prizes and honors, including Portugal’s Gra-Cruz da Ordem Militar de Cristo and Grande Colar da Ordem do Infante Dom Henrique.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. Founded in 1869, the firm is headquartered in New York and maintains offices in all major financial centers around the world."
