        "text": "Industry minister Arnaud Montebourg's broadside against EU-imposed austerity policies to cut debt came as the anti-immigrant, anti-EU National Front of Marine Le Pen made strong gains in a by-election in southwestern France on Sunday.\n\nHis claim drew a furious response from Mr Barroso, with the EC president effectively accusing the French minister of \"having the same views as the far-Right\".\n\nThe war of words marks a new low in France-EU relations, coming days after Mr Barroso accused some in France of having a \"reactionary\" approach to globalisation and free trade.\n\nSpeaking to France Inter Radio on Sunday night, Mr Montebourg said: \"Mr Barroso is the fuel of the French National Front, that's the truth. He is the fuel of Beppe Grillo,\" he said, referring to the leader of the populist 5-Star Movement which won a quarter of the vote in Italy's February election.\n\nMr Montebourg added: \"The European Union is paralysed. It does not respond to any of people's aspirations in the industrial, economic or budgetary fields and in the end it provides a cause to all the anti-European parties.\"\n\nMr Barroso sparked fury in France last week for criticising its bid to protect its film and television industries from Hollywood dominance. The fight to preserve its \"cultural exception\" held up agreement between the European Union's 27 trade ministers on the terms of the Commission's mandate to negotiate an EU-US free trade deal.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Barroso said: \"It would be good if some politicians understood that they will not get very far by attacking Europe and trying to turn it into a scapegoat for their problems.\n\n\"Some Left-wing nationalists have exactly the same views as the far right.\"\n\nThe Commission also said in a statement that French leaders should defend Europe \"against nationalism, populism and jingoism\" instead of \"attacking globalisation\".\n\nA champion of antiglobalisation and \"Le Made in France\", Mr Montebourg recently made headlines for blocking Yahoo, the web portal, from buying a 75 per cent stake in DailyMotion, the French video sharing site owned by France Telecom. He also threatened to throw the world's largest steelmaker out of France.\n\nEuropean Commissioner Michel Barnier said Mr Montebourg's \"absurd\" remarks were the latest attempt by France to \"shirk its responsibilities\".\n\n\"But they won't be shirking for very much longer because the moment of truth will arrive at some point, it's arriving for the minister,\" he told France 2.\n\n\"Look how some countries in Europe, with the same Commission, are doing better than France ... Germany is doing better because it supports business,\" said Mr Barnier.\n\nMr Montebourg blamed austerity for the National Front scoring 46.2 per cent in a local election in Villeneuve-sur-Lot on Sunday, knocking the Socialists out of the first round."
