        "text": "European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has been having a hard time trying to appoint a chief scientist, a pledge he made to the European Parliament more than 18 months ago. However, the search continues and Barroso hopes to have someone in place by autumn this year.\n\nThe role has not been formally advertised. Instead Barroso is searching within the ranks of high profile names in Europe and those people well known in research circles.\n\n“President Barroso is still very keen to appoint someone to this position, but it has been difficult to find someone who fulfils all the criteria – a person who is a scientist, knowledgeable about European affairs and able to communicate to the public,” Commission spokesman Cezary Lewanowicz told Science|Business.\n\nBarroso announced the plan in September 2009 saying the ideal candidate will be someone, “Who has the power to deliver proactive, scientific advice throughout all stages of policy development and delivery.” The aim is to embed scientific advice into the Commission’s policy-making, in the same way as it is at a national level in the UK and Ireland, where the Chief Scientist posts are held by John Beddington and Patrick Cunningham, respectively.\n\nBarroso hopes to fill the post, “At the end of the summer or by the start of autumn,” Lewanowicz said. The appointee will be part of the Bureau of European Policy Advisers, a group of experts that provides the Commission President, the College of Commissioners and the Directorates General with strategic thinking and policy advice. The Chief Scientific Adviser would have a very specific role and report directly to Barroso. The appointment is at Grade AD15, which is equivalent to Director-General level and has an annual salary of about €200,000.\n\nLewanowicz declined to comment on whether a shortlist had been drawn up. In response to George Lyon, a Member of the European Parliament, who in March this year asked the Commission what steps had been taken and when the Parliament can expect to see the role fully defined and filled, the Commission said it is “committed” to the appointment and, “Candidates who may fulfil the demanding criteria for this key position are currently being considered.”\n\nThere have long been calls for the Directorates of the European Commission to have their own independent sources of scientific advice to draw on when formulating policies and directives. As John Wood, chairman of the European Research Area Board, an advisory board that has recommended the idea of appointing a chief scientific adviser, says, “The role is vital. We need to have someone who can provide sound scientific advice and can represent Europe at the international table.”"
