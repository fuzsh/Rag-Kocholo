        "text": "On October 23, 2008, Li Keqiang, Vice Premier of the State Council and Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Jose Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission attended and addressed the opening ceremony of the EU-China School of Law (ECSL) at China University of Political Science and Law (CUPL).\n\nLi said in his address that ECSL, as an educational cooperation program, is an important accomplishment in China-EU cooperation. ECSL is established in China, jointly operated by EU and China and aimed at the world. Governing the country by law is Chinaâs basic guideline. Advocating the rule of law is the requirement of our times. Training more talents in laws is the urgent need of Chinaâs modernization drive. I hope that China and EU, on the basis of mutual respect and sincere cooperation, can develop ECSL into an important platform for both sides to understand each otherâs laws and train law professionals with deep understanding of each otherâs laws in a bid to deepen and expand China-EU cooperation. Li hoped that both teachers and students can make great accomplishments and contribute their talents and accomplishments to promoting China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership.\n\nBarroso said in his address that education is an important area of bilateral cooperation. ECSL is an important achievement in the development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between EU and China. The establishment of ECSL will help to increase bilateral understanding. Training more talents in law will help EU and China better deal with global problems and challenges. He hoped that EU and China make concerted efforts to develop ECSL into a high-level school of law.\n\nBefore the opening ceremony, Li met with the EU delegation headed by Barroso. Li said that the all-directional, multi-tiered and wide-ranging cooperation between China and EU continues to grow. Against the volatile and complex international situation, strengthening the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and EU is in the fundamental interest of both sides. China and EU should strengthen dialogue and exchange and expand and deepen practical cooperation so as to achieve common development. Barroso spoke highly of EU-China relationship and the cooperation between the two sides in different areas and expressed the commitment to advance bilateral relationship.\n\nAs a part of the China University of Political Science and Law (CUPL), ECSL is jointly operated by 16 Chinese and European universities such as CUPL and University of Hamburg. It aims to cultivate Chinaâs Juris Mater (JM) and EUâs Master of Laws (LLM), carry out academic studies, and train lawyers, judges and prosecutors."
