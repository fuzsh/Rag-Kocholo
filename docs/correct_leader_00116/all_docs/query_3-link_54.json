        "text": "By Gaige Davila\n\neditor@portisabelsouthpadre.com\n\nAfter 38 years, Jose “Manuel” Barroso is ending his namesake.\n\nManuel’s Restaurant, at 313 E Maxan St in Port Isabel, abruptly closed on Easter Sunday, to the shock of locals and customers from all over the country.\n\nBarroso said the decision was hard but necessary, with the restaurant affecting his health,\n\n“I’ve been spending a lot of time at the doctor’s office,” Barroso told the PRESS inside the now-closed restaurant. “My stress has been too stressful and not having employees,” Jose said.\n\nIn January, Manuel’s closed, after Jose’s doctor requested he rest. Barroso’s son, Frank, who waited tables, cashiered and managed Manuel’s, started a GoFundMe page to crowdsource funds to offset the restaurant’s bills. Manuel’s had reopened their dining room only two months prior, last November, serving food only to-go since March last year.\n\nAfter raising over $13,000, Manuel’s reopened to droves of anxious customers on Tuesday, Jan. 26, worried they had lost the restaurant for good. People tipped generously, and the restaurant remained open and busy up until Easter Sunday.\n\n“We used to come in and we were all ready to go, and the last month or so we’ve just been here,” Jose said, noting the exhaustion had caught up to all of the employees.\n\nAfter they reopened, Barroso and his wife, Lorena, were cooking, while his son Frank and another server, Maria Olvera, were in the dining room, waiting tables, expediting food and answering phones. Isaac, Frank’s son, would be doing prep work.\n\nSome weekends, it was just Jose, Lorena and Frank, three employees during their busiest days.\n\n“My doctor kept telling me, ‘you’re working too much, you need to stay back’” Barroso said. “But if I stay back, it would just be Frank and my wife. It was really getting to me.”\n\nJose plans to continue making Manuel’s coveted hot sauce, which they’re selling up to a hundred jars a week of. Just before sitting down to interview with the PRESS, a car pulled up to Manuel’s and asked Jose for hot sauce. A large group arrived to eat right after, only to be turned away, not knowing the longtime restaurant had closed.\n\nIn the meantime, local restaurateurs are offering to buy Manuel’s and or offer Jose and Frank jobs, bringing their loyal clientele with them. Jose said he would only sell the business if everything, including the name and menu, stayed the same.\n\nHe’d help transition the business initially then step away for good. “Other than that, I’m done,” Jose said.\n\nAfter 38 years, Manuel’s built a three generations of clientele, who became a part of the restaurant’s home-like atmosphere.\n\n“Like I’ve always said, like Frank always said, they’re our friends, our customers, family, grandma and grandpa,” Jose said. “It’s a hard decision for me to make, but it’s something that I had to make.”\n\nHe continued, “I’m 69, I’ve never felt (the years) like I feel them now.”\n\nJose estimated he would work a few more years before stepping away from Manuel’s. He is still adjusting to the earlier-than-expected departure.\n\n“For the first two weeks, this month, it’s going to be hard,” Jose said.\n\nWith that adjustment and grief comes guit, too.\n\n“My mom, I feel like I’m letting her down,” Jose said of his late mother, Francisca Sanchez, who died three years ago.\n\nSanchez and Jose started Manuel’s in 1986, at the Padre South Hotel. The owners asked Barroso to take over the hotel’s restaurant if he brought his mom with him, who was a cook at Isabel’s Cafe, another long-time Port Isabel locale along Highway 100. The two were the lone operators of the restaurant.\n\n“She was my backbone, she was the main force in the kitchen, and because of her they gave me the chance to open the restaurant,” Jose said. “The owner said ‘if she doesn’t come with you, there’s no deal.’ My mom wasn’t going to leave me by myself.”\n\nIn 1999, Manuel’s moved to its Port Isabel location, collecting dollar bills, university flags, customer signatures and other sports memorabilia on the wall for nearly 22 years. Only the tables will be left inside, Jose said.\n\n“I was surprised, just like everyone else,” Frank Barroso said outside of Manuel’s this past Wednesday. “(My dad) called my brothers, and I thought ‘we’re all here together, let’s get a picture,’ I didn’t know what was going on. I didn’t know he called them. Then he pulled us over to the side and he just started crying. That’s when I knew.”\n\nFrank believes the restaurant should remain open, however that can happen.\n\n“This was my life, I don’t know anything else but this,” Frank said. “I do enjoy it, but I knew we weren’t always going to be here.”\n\nIn response to his plans now that Manuel’s has closed, Frank said he will do “whatever the hell I can.”\n\nInside the restaurant, a longtime customer, named Mike, enters through the back of the restaurant and places his hand on Jose’s arm, and says “I’m sorry to see you go.”\n\nJose responds, “It’s a hard decision, Mike.”\n\nThough hard, Jose is still appreciative of the life he created with Manuel’s and the people he met along the way.\n\n“Thank you to all my customers, Valley-wide, Winter Texans, from the bottom of my heart man,” Jose said. “I appreciate all of the support they gave us. They made us what we are.”\n\nWant the whole story? Pick up a copy of the Port Isabel-South Padre Press, or subscribe to our E-Edition by clicking here."
