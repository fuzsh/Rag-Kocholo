A Magic Bullet 「魔弾 Madan」[1] is a concentration of mana that is launched at an opponent. It is so simple that mages can do it without the aid of grimoires.[2]

Description[]

The user manifests and concentrates their mana on their hand. Subsequently, the user can launch the mana towards an opponent, blasting them away.[3]

These magic blasts could be focused into beams,[4] enlarged into explosive shells,[5] or condensed into sniper shots.[6]
