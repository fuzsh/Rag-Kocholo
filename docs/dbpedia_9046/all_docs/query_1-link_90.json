I consider this sub-optimal because of the extreme penetration of hardcast. If I do stagger load what do you recommend ?\n\nDo you have another round that would be a better general purpose round ?\n\nIf I do go with Underwood, what is a suitable practice round ?

Low tech wad cutters, heavy ball ammo or an affordable basic hollowpoint. Stuff like that.\n\nTakings look at SGAmmo and pretending I have a 10mm, I might buy something like this after testing out a box.\n\nSomething reliable, not crazy hot, not too expensive. Good for 2 & 4 leg critters. Maybe I’d find an American brand just because.\n\nMy ammo preferences are a bit peculiar I suppose, but I’d rather have a thousand rounds of ball that I am familiar with than a few boxes of dollar-a-pop magic bullets.\n\nLast edited: Dec 17, 2023\n\nSharpDog\n\nBushwhacker\n\nJoined\n\nAug 6, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n11,422\n\nLikes\n\n80,777\n\nLocation\n\nIt's a secret\n\n#5\n\nSG Ammo gets quite a chunk of my paychecks\n\nFreeMe\n\nBushwhacker\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n11,810\n\nLikes\n\n36,356\n\nLocation\n\nIdaho\n\n#6\n\nI always like the 200gr jhp from Double tap.

I would like the load to be suitable for deer hunting. Since I started the thread I have found some heavy 180 gr - 200 gr Federal and Winny JSP for sale but I'm still thinking the Underwood 140 Extreme series is like a .357 magnum +P if you will while the heavy 10mm JSPs are more like .45 ACP +P (maybe).\n\nJack Stevens\n\nGuide\n\nJoined\n\nSep 29, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n1,362\n\nLikes\n\n7,043\n\nLocation\n\nMidwest\n\n#14\n\nFYI, Alaskan Ballistics has been testing/vetting 10mm ammo for years using commonly owned 10mm pistols.\n\nAmong the types of 10mm ammo they've tested are so-called “Grizzly loads.” Here’s one vid:\n\nDubhelix\n\nearthling\n\nJoined\n\nOct 10, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n3,260\n\nLikes\n\n24,165\n\nLocation\n\nShenandoah, Earth.\n\n#15\n\nSimple.

OK for deer, more than sufficient for defense, probably more than enough for the smaller bears or cats that pose a hazard (farfetched scenario IMO). Any deep penetration oriented round is just going exit the far side in the majority of situations which poses two problems, reduced volume of the wound channel leading to reduced lethality, and potential hazard to whatever is on the far side.\n\n10mm JHP will not leave much left if you hit small game. I've always thought the old-time side-by-side shotguns with a third boring for a .22 rimfire or similar would be the right idea for shoot-whatever-you-see meat hunting, but I've never seen a modern version of them. The originals were heavy and unreliable. The idea is you keep to smaller gauge, 20, 28, .410, and keep the barrel short and the choke on the full side.\n\nRJM52\n\nGuide\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n3,337\n\nLikes\n\n13,276\n\nLocation\n\nRochester, NH\n\n#17\n\nCarry the Underwood Xtreme Penetrator in a Glock 40 long slide and it is quite the round...\n\nFor 2-leggers I prefer a 155-165 JHP in the 1200-1300 fps range.\n\nIn the woods a 200 grain cast in the 1150-1250 range much like this:\n\n10MM 200 Grain Hardcast Lead Wide Nose (100 RND)\n\nFree shipping on orders of 100 rounds and more 200 grain Hardcast Flat Point.

All this to say nothing of different powder charges and operating pressures for different rounds.\n\nA reliable bonded jacketed hollowpoint should solve any possible problem from your listed possibilities.

That being said the same principles apply. As far as I can tell any bullet that will be \"good\" for bear is going to be \"overkill\" for 2 legged threats. If you're in the woods I'd run heavy hardcast, but if your in town light hollow points lessen the risk of over penetration. Currently I run 140 grain copper hollow points, they get good expansion and decent penetration, in my area black bears are rare, mountain lions are prevalent though. If I was in an area where bears were more common I'd run 180 or 200 grain hardcast and not look back. I would switch rounds back to hollow points of some flavor for town carry though, annoying but worth it IMHO.\n\nJack Stevens\n\nGuide\n\nJoined\n\nSep 29, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n1,362\n\nLikes\n\n7,043\n\nLocation\n\nMidwest\n\n#21\n\nSpeaking of XTP-HP bullets, Hornady increased the muzzle velocity of its 10mm 180grn ammo from 1180fps to 1275fps (650fpe) as derived from a 5” barrel:\n\nI’ve shot a couple of boxes and it was very accurate.

These are proven to go over 1300fps out of my 5\" Kimber 1911.\n\nFor practice rounds I've had great luck in power and accuracy with the Sellier and Bellot 180gr FMJ and their 180gr JHP. I actually like how the JHP is a very large opening compared to the XTP's.\n\n\"Tools and Targets\" on YT just did a comparison video between BB and Underwood.......guess the winner of that one.\n\nSharpDog\n\nBushwhacker\n\nJoined\n\nAug 6, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n11,422\n\nLikes\n\n80,777\n\nLocation\n\nIt's a secret\n\n#23\n\nI'm a bit leery of the 180 gr and especially lighter than that JHPs shedding mass at the higher velocity out of a 5\" barrel. I would also like to have the ammo perform out of a possible future 8\" barrel. I'm not opposed to just getting ball ammo for practice and woods use as @Dubhelix suggested.\n\nI guess I'm down to six choices. In no particular order:\n\nFederal 200 gr. JSP\n\nFederal 200 gr. JHP HST\n\nWinchester 200 gr JSP\n\nGrizzly 200 gr JHP\n\nUnderwood 200 gr JHP XTP\n\nHornady 200 gr JHP XTP\n\nKinda leaning towards the Grizzly (@Paulyseggs )\n\nLast edited: Dec 19, 2023\n\nSharpDog\n\nBushwhacker\n\nJoined\n\nAug 6, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n11,422\n\nLikes\n\n80,777\n\nLocation\n\nIt's a secret\n\n#24\n\nWell, this is interesting, and kind of puzzling.

I used a Lee Loader and we would have a loading party where we round-robined the loading between several of us. I have always thought JSPs were the all-around bullets. Mainly hunting bullets. I gradually have been won over by heavy for caliber bullets which give higher momentum & penetration given a constant bullet profile. Looks like 200 gr JSP at 1250 fps is doable in the 10 mm. 200 gr JHPs might be better for the potential humans, deer, hogs and dogs involved.\n\nA Seedy Lot\n\nHobbyist\n\nJoined\n\nApr 10, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n7,133\n\nLikes\n\n52,487\n\nLocation\n\nNW Montana\n\n#26\n\nXtps are a pretty tough bullet. I liked the 180s out of the 10mm. Might be worth a box to try.\n\nIron Man\n\nScout\n\nJoined\n\nJun 2, 2022\n\nMessages\n\n325\n\nLikes\n\n1,526\n\nLocation\n\nUtah\n\n#27\n\nDo the jsp bullets expand out of a 10mm? I know the 158 grain jsp 357 don't expand very well out of a 2.5 inch barrel, just curious.\n\nSharpDog\n\nBushwhacker\n\nJoined\n\nAug 6, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n11,422\n\nLikes\n\n80,777\n\nLocation\n\nIt's a secret\n\n#28\n\nDo the jsp bullets expand out of a 10mm?

I'm prolly thinking ahead too much.\n\nI would give pretty high odds I'll get a CMMG Banshee though.\n\nEveryone seemed to like the XTP and that is what Underwood uses. IDK what Grizzly uses. I'll ask them before I purchase any.\n\nIron Man\n\nScout\n\nJoined\n\nJun 2, 2022\n\nMessages\n\n325\n\nLikes\n\n1,526\n\nLocation\n\nUtah\n\n#29\n\nArguably the if the jsp 10mm doesn't expand much it would be a decent bear protection round. I know the 158 grain jsp out of a 20 inch rifle expand more than out of a pistol, but still not much unless you hit something hard."
