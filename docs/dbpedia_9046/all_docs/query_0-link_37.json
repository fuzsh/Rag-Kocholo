        "text": "Sexual predators have grown increasingly adept at using the internet to share and view child sexual abuse photos and videos. Some have computer-programming skills and have deployed sophisticated defenses against efforts to take them down.\n\nBut the predators don’t have free rein on the internet, thanks to nearly four dozen child protection hotlines around the world, which act as a first line of defense against the explosion of imagery.\n\n[Read The New York Times’s investigation into the global fight against online child sexual abuse.]\n\nThe hotlines play a central role in getting tech companies, websites and others to address the content. When the hotlines become aware of an illegal image, they issue a notice to have it removed. They may also notify law enforcement officials, who can launch a criminal investigation and try to rescue the abused child.\n\nBut to keep up with the predators, the hotlines must constantly find ways to outsmart them. The problem is that no solution lasts very long, because the predators also use technology to find ways to hide.\n\n“I’ve been doing this for 14 years, and I’ve heard so many times about the magic bullet,” said Denton Howard, the executive director of Inhope, an organization of 47 child sexual abuse hotlines around the world. “In reality, magic bullets don’t exist.”\n\nIn the case of three recently shuttered sites, the hotline in Canada, the Canadian Center for Child Protection, deployed a new software tool, which it named Arachnid after the class of invertebrates that includes spiders. With a modest annual budget of less than $5 million, the center realized it needed a speedier and more efficient way to take on bad actors.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
