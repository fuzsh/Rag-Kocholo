All of these devices, however, have had occasions when they were either ineffective in controlling a subject or were lethal to a subject. Also, various defensive and control physical measures such as \"joint locks\" and \"pressure points\" have drawbacks. The authors propose \"reality-based\" training, which recognizes there is no perfect means to control subjects. Realistic training prepares officers for the types of encounters they will experience on the streets. Specifically, training should prepare officers for a surprise assault. Proper training can condition officers to reduce stress levels during an assault, so that they can respond from a position of control rather than from one of surprise. Defensive maneuvers should be based on gross motor skills that use large muscle groups and follow natural patterns, so that the ability of the officer to execute the moves will not deteriorate as arousal levels increase. 17 notes"
