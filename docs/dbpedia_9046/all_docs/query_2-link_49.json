        "text": "7-8:30 p.m. ET Friday, February 23, 2024\n\nThe Magic Bullet, A Work-in-progress Share-Out\n\nIn-person at AANM or Online via Livestream\n\nPurchase Tickets for In-person | Purchase Tickets for Livestream\n\n$10 Members\n\n$12 Student/Senior\n\n$15 General Public\n\n$5 Livestream\n\nTHE MAGIC BULLET is a transdisciplinary performance about an ensemble of seven contemporary artists trying to tell the story of a French colonial magic show that took place at Algiers’ Bab-Azoun Theatre in 1856. As the ensemble attempts to confront the legacy of this historical performance, an overlapping, intersecting sea of stories unfolds across space and time, defying a global legacy of colonization and reclaiming the liberatory potential of magic.\n\nThe project is inspired by historical accounts of the marabouts—Sufi mystics who animated Algeria’s massive revolt against French colonial rule in the 19th century—and by the story of renowned French stage magician Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin, who crossed the Mediterranean on an imperial mission to prove the superiority of European conjuring over the miracles of Algerian rebel mystics and indigenous spiritual leaders. Drawing on archival sources, ritual, original writing, stage magic and documentary filmmaking, THE MAGIC BULLET offers an uncanny confrontation between the power of illusion and the illusion of power.\n\nTHE MAGIC BULLET is created by LubDub Theatre Co with the following ensemble of generative artists: Caitlin Nasema Cassidy, Noelle Ghoussaini, Pierre Jampy, Ismail Khalidi, Mohamed Yabdri, Geoff Kanick, and Robert Duffley. THE MAGIC BULLET is a National Performance Network (NPN) Creation & Development Fund Project co-commissioned by Pangea World Theatre in partnership with the Arab American National Museum, Noor Theatre, and NPN.\n\nAbout LubDub Theatre Co\n\nLubDub Theatre Co is an NYC-based company of artists that animates stories of science, magic, and myth.
