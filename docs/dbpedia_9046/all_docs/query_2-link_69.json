She was the first human cured by a magic bullet.\n\nScientists carried out a series of experiments and realised that Salvarsan 606 and Prontosil contained sulphonamide.\n\nFollowing this discovery, drug companies went on to develop sulphonamide cures for diseases such as pneumonia and scarlet fever."
