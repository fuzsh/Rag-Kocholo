That’s what Paul Ehrlich, often called the “father of immunology,” had in mind when he coined the term “magic bullet” back in 1907. He was talking about a hypothetical drug that could target a microbe or a toxin and destroy it without any collateral damage to the surrounding environment. Today, there are bullets that may not exactly be magical, but they are not hypothetical. We call them “monoclonal antibodies.”\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nThere with you then.

She was not a doctor nor a scientist, but nevertheless played a pivotal role in the history of immunology. That’s the study of the protective mechanisms the body uses to fend off attack by foreign substances such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, viruses, cancer cells and toxins, collectively called “antigens.”\n\nLady Montagu had lost a brother to smallpox and had survived an infection herself, of which she was constantly reminded by the scars on her face. No wonder then that she took an interest in a practice she encountered in Istanbul that was supposed to offer protection against this scourge. Pus taken from a blister of a person suffering a mild case of smallpox was scratched into the arm or leg of an uninfected person. Should this person be subsequently infected, the disease would be mild.\n\nLady Montagu was so impressed she had her son inoculated and on her return to England enthusiastically promoted “variolation,” as the procedure was called. It was not perfect since the inoculated individual could still infect others and sometimes would contract a serious case of the disease. Edward Jenner sought to improve the procedure and discovered that inoculation with pus taken from the blister of a person infected with cowpox, a much less severe disease, would also protect against smallpox. This was the first “vaccine,” the term deriving from the Latin for cow.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAt the time there was no knowledge of microbes, such as the virus that causes smallpox, and certainly nothing was known about the mechanism that resulted in immunization.\n\nThe situation began to be clarified when German physician Robert Koch isolated the bacteria that cause anthrax and Louis Pasteur created a vaccine with an attenuated form of the bacterium. Although the work of Pasteur and Koch established the germ theory of disease, there was little understanding of how immunity was conferred in terms of chemistry. Then, working under Koch, Emil von Behring confronted diphtheria, a bacterial disease that at the time was known as “the strangling angel of children.” It caused swelling of the throat to the extent that breathing was impaired. Von Behring made the remarkable discovery that the disease could be cured by injection with serum from a horse that had been inoculated with the diphtheria-causing bacteria. Ehrlich then worked out a method to standardize extracts of the serum and deaths from diphtheria plummeted.\n\nIt was at this point that Ehrlich ventured a theory about what was going on. The horse serum contained a chemical, an “antitoxin,” that neutralized the toxin produced by bacteria. He theorized that white blood cells feature a large number of potential antitoxins on their surface, and when one of them engages the toxin, it latches on to it and prevents it from doing any damage. Ehrlich called these antitoxins “receptors for toxins” and visualized the toxins fitting into them much like a key fits a lock. When such a fit occurred, the cell produced more receptors, some of which would be released into the bloodstream and hunt down more of the toxin molecules. He called these liberated receptors “antibodies” and described them as “magic bullets” since they would interact only with the specific substance that caused them to be produced in the first place. Amazingly, Ehrlich was essentially bang on with his description of antibodies.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOf course, much has been learned about antibodies since Ehrlich first floated the magic bullet theory. It is now clear that a natural infection, or a vaccine, activates many B cells, each of which secrets antibodies that bind to the antigen to different extents. These antibodies come from many different B cells and are said to be\n\n“polyclonal.” A major thrust in immunological research these days is to find a laboratory method to select a specific B cell that makes only a desired antibody. Since they come from only one type of cell, they are “monoclonal.” These antibodies can then be injected into the body and will recognize and bind to the specific antigen that was used to produce them. That may be a protein on the surface of a cancer cell or one of the body’s many naturally occurring chemicals that can cause inflammation.\n\nIn 1975, immunologists Georges Köhler and César Milstein made a breakthrough. They injected an antigen into a mouse and then extracted the B cells from the animal’s spleen that were specific for the production of the antibody for that antigen. These cells were then fused with a type of cancer cell to form “hybridoma” cells that inherited the B cell’s ability to produce the antibody. As is characteristic of cancer cells, the hybridoma cells kept multiplying and generating monoclonal antibodies in sufficient amounts to be isolated.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOne of the most successful applications of this technology was by immunologist Jan Vilcek of New York University who in the 1990s developed infliximab (Remicade), a monoclonal antibody that recognizes and neutralizes tumour necrosis factor alpha. This molecule that occurs naturally in the body regulates inflammation and can cause various autoimmune diseases such as Crohn’s or rheumatoid arthritis when it goes out of kilter. Infliximab has proven to be extremely effective at inactivating TNF-alpha, earning billions of dollars for Janssen Biotech and a fortune for Vilcek who has used most of the money for philanthropic purposes.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies such as bebtelovimab that target the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been developed, as well as a number of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer. These “biologicals” have completely changed the approach toward drug development. Historically, most drugs — morphine, digitalis, quinine, Aspirin and penicillin being typical examples — were discovered through trial and error or lucky accidents. Monoclonals on the other hand are based on an understanding of the molecular basis of disease and are designed to selectively target causative factors. They are Ehrlich’s magic bullets realized.
