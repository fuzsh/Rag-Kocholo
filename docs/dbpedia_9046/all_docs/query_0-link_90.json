        "text": "We continue our journey through my book “The Music of Business” with some insights on business strategy from Tom Peters. We offer live events on this and other topics via our Business and Music masterclasses on a worldwide basis for full immersion in the topic.\n\nTom Peters, world class author, speaker and thinker kindly retweeted a rant about magic bullets, which I thought up in the shower.\n\nSo often in business, we expect there to be a magic bullet to solve our problems, yet this is rare. So, in a deep sense of irony, here are five of my own “Magic Business Bullets”:\n\nThere’s plenty of business advice out there. The wise leader looks at the advice, considers the context of their business and then adapts the advice if it is appropriate, so that it best fits the business. It’s IBM’s original one-word motto from the turn of the 20th Century, reworked by Aretha Franklin more recently:\n\n“Think”\n\nAretha Franklin and IBM\n\nFinally, here’s some of Tom Peters’ thinking on some magic bullets for people leading companies. Check out Tom’s work via www.tompeters.com\n\n“If a window of opportunity appears, don’t pull down the shade”"
