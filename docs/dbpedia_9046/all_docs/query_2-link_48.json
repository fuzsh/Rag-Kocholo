        "text": "I'm not always hungry first thing in the morning, but one thing that I find always hits the spot is a good smoothie. It's light enough to sip on slowly, filled with micro and macronutrients, and easy enough to consume while multitasking.\n\nWhen the smoothie craving hits, I always reach for my Magic Bullet. Ranked as the best personal blender for smoothies during testing, I fell in love with this affordable machine when I started using it for daily breakfasts over a year ago. Needless to say, I haven't looked back.\n\n$48 at Amazon\n\nWhy I love my Magic Bullet\n\nThis no-frills appliance is extremely straightforward and easy to use. All it requires is filling the provided cup, twisting the blade on, and pressing it into the base until it starts to blend. You can even adjust it into the base until it stays, so you don't have to hold the blender while it prepares your food.\n\nBut, a simple build doesn't mean mediocre performance. This machine blends ingredients quickly and with easeâ€”even when I fill it up with frozen fruits and veggies. And although it's an obvious match for smoothies, it can also perform well with dips like guacamole and hummus, as well as sauces and frozen cocktails.\n\nBest of all, cleaning this machine after each use is a breeze. The blender cup is top-rack dishwasher safe, but even hand-washing takes just seconds, thanks to the cylindrical shape that leaves no remnants left behind. Plus, the blender comes with a lid that screws onto the cup. So it's easy to take your morning smoothie or pre-gym protein shake on the go.\n\nIf you're looking for a personal blender that's reliable, affordable, and low maintenance, the Magic Bullet delivers on every front.\n\n$48 at Amazon\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
