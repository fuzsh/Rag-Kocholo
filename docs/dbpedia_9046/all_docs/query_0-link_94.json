        "text": "The NutriBullet Pro 900 is better than the Magic Bullet Blender. The Pro 900 can make a smoother blend with ingredients like greens or fruit and comes with to-go lids for two of its jars instead of just one. It's also sturdier.\n\nThe Magic Bullet Blender and the BlendJet 2 have different strengths, and you may prefer either, depending on your needs. The BlendJet is a portable, battery-powered blender. It's smaller and quieter, and its lid has a built-in carrying strap. On the other hand, the Magic Bullet is a conventional personal blender that comes with a greater number of jars. Unless you're looking for a portable blender, it's better for most uses.\n\nThe Magic Bullet Blender is better for single-serve smoothies than the Oster MyBlend. The Magic Bullet comes with a couple of jars for personal-sized smoothies and makes a silkier blend with fibrous ingredients like kale. It's better for making nut butter and easier to clean by hand. On the other hand, the Oster has a better build quality. You can crush ice without adding liquid to the jar, although it doesn't make snow-like crushed ice.\n\nThe Ninja Foodi Power Nutri DUO is better than the Magic Bullet Blender. The Ninja has a better build quality and overall performance. It makes a smoother blend with ingredients like kale and is much easier to use for tough tasks like making nut butter. You can also use it to crush ice. It's easier to clean by hand, and all its parts are dishwasher-safe.\n\nThe Magic Bullet Blender is better than the Magic Bullet Mini. The full-size model's jars have slightly bigger capacities. A resealable lid is included, so you can take your smoothie to go. It's also much easier to use to process hard ingredients like nuts.\n\nThe Ninja Nutri Ninja Pro is a little better than the Magic Bullet Blender. The Ninja comes with to-go lids for all of its jars, and it's more versatile since you can use it to crush ice without adding liquid to the jar. It's also sturdier and easier to clean by hand. All its components are dishwasher-safe, while the Magic Bullet's blade assembly needs to be cleaned by hand.\n\nThe Magic Bullet Kitchen Express and the Magic Bullet Blender perform similarly but come with different jars and accessories. The Kitchen Express includes a food processing bowl and personal jars for single-serve smoothies. On the other hand, the Magic Bullet Blender doesn't come with any food processing accessories, but it includes a four-ounce cup for blending small amounts of ingredients, along with a pair of personal jars for smoothies.\n\nThe NutriBullet Pro 1000 is better for single-serve smoothies than the Magic Bullet Blender. The NutriBullet has a better build quality and comes with resealable lids for both of its jars. It's also quieter and easier to clean by hand. On the other hand, the Magic Bullet is easier to use to make nut butter. It's also very well-suited for single-serve smoothies, and you may prefer it for its smaller, lighter design.\n\nThe Magic Bullet Blender is better than the Beautiful Personal Blender. They're both small and come with some of the same accessories, including a jar with a handle as well as cup rings that make drinking from the jars at home more comfortable. Neither can crush ice on its own. The Magic Bullet has a better blending performance, so it can blend smoothies more quickly and produce a smoother result. The Beautiful comes with a grinding blade, so it can double as a spice and coffee grinder.\n\nIt's a compact personal blender. It's a bit taller than the Magic Bullet Mini, but not by much, and its footprint is somewhat bigger, so it requires a bit more room on your counter. You'll have no problem storing it in a cupboard, though.\n\nIt has a mediocre build quality that's very similar to the Magic Bullet Mini. It's almost entirely made of generic plastic, including its round motor base, transmission gear, jars, and lids. It sits on four small rubber feet, which will help prevent it from sliding around while in use.\n\nThere's a 15-ounce and a 12-ounce jar included. Also included are two storage lids, two cup rings to make it more comfortable to drink from the jar, and one resealable to-go lid. The Magic Bullet Essential is a more basic variant with only a 15-ounce jar.\n\nIn addition to the screw-on blade assembly, it comes with a to-go lid for the main jar with a covered drinking spout. There are also screw-on storage lids for each of the bigger jars, so you can easily store whatever you make, as well as lip rings so you can drink from the jar directly.\n\nThis blender has a power cord that'll be long enough to reach a power outlet near your kitchen counter, but it doesn't have anywhere to stow the cable when it's not in use.\n\nIt's fantastic for processing small batches of fibrous ingredients. If you're making a smoothie with ingredients like kale, it has a silky texture with just a few grains left over. Some blenders process the ingredients faster, and you need to stop and shake the jar for the best results, but it's an easy process overall.\n\nIt's excellent for nut butter. It's not the easiest blender to use for thick mixtures like this since it takes a while, and you need to stop and shake the jar. That said, it's a lot less tedious than with some personal blenders, and the result is superb nut butter with very few unprocessed pieces.\n\nIt's not particularly loud for a personal blender, so you won't find it overly loud when you're blending a smoothie for a few minutes. That said, models like the Magic Bullet Kitchen Express and the Magic Bullet Mini make less noise at maximum speed.\n\nYou turn the blender on by pushing down on the jar and twisting it into place. There's no power button or other controls, but you can easily press and release to simulate pulse mode.\n\nIt's decently easy to clean by hand. After running it with soap and water in the jar, you still need to use a sponge to clean the inside of the jar and the ridges around the rim. The blade assembly also requires extra scrubbing to remove residue caught around the blades. Since they're sharp, you need to use a brush with a handle for that part of the process."
