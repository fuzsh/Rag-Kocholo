It is advertised as an extremely powerful blender in a small size that can blend food and make smoothies.\n\nWhat is the Problem?\n\nThere are reports of Magic Bullet blenders exploding due to built-up pressure inside the container. This is a risk when a person blends hot or thick liquids inside the Magic Bullet. The dangerously high pressure causes the lid to explode off the base, sending boiling-hot food flying.\n\nMagic Bullet Lawsuits\n\nThe first lawsuit involving a Magic Bullet blender injury was filed by a lawyer in California for a man who suffered serious cuts to his face.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Homeland Housewares is aware that the Magic Bullet and Nutribullet blenders are defective and dangerous, but failed to fix the problem. According to the lawyer representing the injured man:\n\n“Thankfully he is not permanently blinded, but the very hot, sticky sauce ended up in his eyeball, in addition to being all over his face and he had to undergo months of treatment to try to correct that problem.”\n\nSafety Risks of the Magic Bullet\n\nExplosions\n\nCuts\n\nLacerations\n\nBurns\n\nEye injuries, vision loss, blindness\n\nScarring\n\nProperty damage\n\nAnd more\n\nHow Can I Avoid Explosions?\n\nHomeland Housewares asks consumers to read the instructions and follow them to be safe. For example, the Magic Bullet should not be used to blend hot liquids, for more than 1 minute, or left unattended.\n\nDo I have a Magic Bullet Lawsuit?\n\nThe Schmidt Firm, PLLC is currently accepting Magic Bullet induced injury cases in all 50 states.
