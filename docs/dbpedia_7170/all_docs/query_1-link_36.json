        "text": "Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1991 for studying the boundary lines between order and disorder in materials like liquid crystals and polymers, died Friday in Orsay, a Paris suburb. He was 74.\n\nHis death was reported by the newspaper Le Monde, which cited his family but did not give a cause.\n\nDiscovered in the late 19th century, liquid crystals are now common in computer displays and flat-screen televisions. They behave in a paradoxical way, flowing like liquid as their molecules line up in the same direction as those in a solid crystal.\n\nDe Gennes did not invent or build liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, but instead answered fundamental questions about how they behave. Working on a wide range of topics, he was able to take solutions from one field of physics and show by analogy how they could solve entirely different problems.\n\nFor example, he showed how the equations governing superconductors - materials that carry electricity with no resistance - could be applied to liquid crystals, even though they have very different physical compositions."
