        "text": "Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Physics, left us on 18 May 2007. On 5 June the French Academy of Sciences organized a national homage to him at the Palais de la Découverte (Palace of Discovery) in Paris in the presence of President Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nPGG, as he was affectionately called by his students and coworkers, was born on 24 October 1932 in Paris. His postsecondary studies began in 1951 at the école Normale Supérieure, where he and Philippe Nozières were classmates. At that time in France, the teaching of modern physics, quantum mechanics, and relativity were nonexistent; physics had not yet recovered from the war years. Not until 1953, at a two-month summer school organized at Les Houches by Cécile de Witt, were the young stars-to-be introduced to those subjects by prominent physicists, including Rudolf Peierls and William Shockley.\n\nFor the next few years, PGG was at Saclay at the Atomic Energy Commission, where he completed his thesis with J. Yvon and A. Herpin on the scattering of neutrons by critical-point fluctuations in a ferromagnet in the vicinity of the Curie temperature. Critical-point fluctuations, in various different contexts, were a recurrent theme throughout his career.\n\nIn 1958, before fulfilling his military service in the French navy, PGG spent six months at the University of California, Berkeley, as a postdoc with Charles Kittel. This was an important period in the evolution of PGG's approach to science. He was strongly influenced by Kittel's insistence on the importance of physical reasoning as an adjunct to formal manipulations and calculations. PGG approached his subsequent work with the conviction that at least qualitatively, everything can be explained in simple terms accessible not only to his fellow theorists but also to experimentalists, chemists, industry people, and even nonspecialists: He was always looking for explanations with the least possible mathematical formalism. It was also at Berkeley that PGG began to immerse himself in learning about superconductivity, at both the microscopic Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer level and the more coarse-grained approach of the Russian school. That effort soon resulted in the famous Orsay Superconductivity Group.\n\nBy then, Anatole Abragam and Jacques Friedel had recognized the unusual talent of PGG. In 1961 they arranged for him to have a position of maître de conférence (assistant professor) with André Guinier, Raymond Castaing, and Friedel at the then-new Orsay campus of the University of Paris. PGG stayed at Orsay for 10 years, where he organized and led two teams of physicists and chemists combining experiment and theory, first on superconductivity and later on liquid crystals. The deep analogy between the physics of superconductors and of smectic liquid crystals remains one of his most well-known ideas. The close-knit interdisciplinary team approach was then revolutionary in academic physics and allowed Orsay to achieve an international stature with considerably fewer resources than larger academic and industrial laboratories. During those years PGG produced two books, Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys (W. A. Benjamin, 1966; based on lecture notes for a course at Orsay) and The Physics of Liquid Crystals (Oxford University Press, 1974; rewritten and expanded with Jacques Prost in 1993), which continue to have considerable influence. Toward the end of the Orsay years, PGG began his interest in macromolecules. One of us (Pincus) recalls having discussions with him in building 510 and working with pieces of thread to try to understand the nature of entanglements and knots in polymer solutions.\n\nA major shift occurred in the early 1970s when PGG was approached to replace Hendrik Casimir as director of the Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. This turbulent period in PGG's life resulted in his declining the Philips post and staying in France to be the prestigious condensed-matter physics chair at the Collège de France. Once again he assembled an outstanding team of chemists and physicists. Over two decades, he invented a new area of condensed-matter physics now known as soft condensed matter. He started studying disordered systems—polymers, colloids, surfactants, microemulsions—that were not considered noble enough by physicists and thus were left to chemists and physical chemists to research. He also revived old areas of 19th-century physics such as wetting and capillary adhesion and made them the bases of the constantly renewed lectures that he taught for 33 years at the Collège de France. Many of his ideas during those years emerged directly from questions asked by either chemists or industrial colleagues, and on several occasions his ideas had direct impact on industrial issues. During that period he wrote another important tome, Scaling Concepts in Polymer Physics (Cornell University Press, 1979), which had a major impact on polymer science and engineering.\n\nIn 1976 PGG accepted the directorship of the école Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles in Paris, which he held simultaneously with his chair at the Collège de France until his retirement in 2005. At ESPCI he was able to pursue his long-standing interest in pedagogy. He organized a tutorship system that emphasized an observational and experimental approach to science education rather than the more traditional formal French training. Many who worked with him heard PGG remark, “The transistor was not invented with theorems!” He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1991 “for discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to more complex forms of matter, in particular to liquid crystals and polymers.” Afterward he worked at trying to convey his passion for science to high-school students. During a four-year period, he visited more than 200 high schools. With Jacques Badoz, he summarized those meetings in a book, Les objets fragiles (Plon, 1994; English translation, Fragile Objects: Soft Matter, Hard Science, and the Thrill of Discovery, Springer, 1996).\n\nAfter his official retirement from ESPCI and the Collège de France, PGG joined the biomedical campus at the Curie Institute, where he pursued problems related to brain research, including olfaction and neuron function. However, he maintained his extremely broad interests in condensed-matter physics; as of last summer, when he gave a lecture series at the University of California, Santa Barbara, he was thinking deeply about the role of defects in supersolid helium, quantum theory of dislocations, and heterogeneities in high-T c superconductors. Quoting Etienne Guyon, his PhD student and former director of the école Normale Supérieure, “He continued his research activities up to the end with a remarkable courage and discretion.”\n\nAs emphasized by Nozières at the June homage, the de Gennes style of research was characterized by elegance—of exposition, in avoiding heavy formalism, and in creativity of ideas. Nevertheless, PGG was not an “ivory tower” scientist. He firmly believed that an important role of science is to enhance the life experience of all humanity.\n\nThe de Gennes legacy will continue to have major influence for years to come. We have lost a marvelous scientist, mentor, and friend."
