The competitive examination of the International selection is intended to young graduates in Arts & Humanities as well as Sciences, who justify at least of one year undergraduate studies in a foreign university and distinguish themselves with outstanding results.\n\nThe examination takes place in 2 steps: a selection based upon application, then oral and written tests in Paris (Arts&Humanities) or oral exams only (Sciences) for shortlisted candidates.\n\nIn 2019, ENS opens 10 positions in Sciences and 10 positions in Arts& Humanities.\n\nJoining ENS through the competitive examination of the International selection gives access to training of excellence, through contact with exceptional researchers, in a privileged training and research environment. Integrated to the community of the normaliens, international students continue their studies at ENS and at the university at the same time, while benefiting from a 1000 euros/month grant for 3 years and from a room on one of the ENS campuses. At the end of their studies, these students have graduated with a master degree in their speciality and with the diploma of École normale supérieure.\n\nFor more informations : http://www.ens.fr/en/academics/admissions/international-selection"
