        "text": "Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, who died on May 18 aged 74, won the 1991 Nobel Prize in Physics for research which led to the development of liquid-crystal displays; he also carried out research on liquid adhesion that led, among other things, to the development of more effective vineyard fungicides.\n\nLiquid crystals are substances which are not quite liquid and not quite solid. Physically they appear to flow like liquids, but they have some properties of crystalline solids, including the arrangement or orientation of their molecules. De Gennes's achievement was to describe mathematically what happens when the orderly structure of solid crystals turns into the disorder of liquid molecules and to explain why in certain circumstances molecules in liquid can form ordered states.\n\nHe found analogies between the behaviour of liquid crystals and superconductors and magnets, and showed how liquid crystals could, under electrical or mechanical stimuli, be induced to change from a transparent to an opaque state. It is this phenomenon which is exploited in the liquid-crystal displays now in widespread use in such products as flat-screen televisions and computer screens, wristwatches and calculators.\n\nThe son of a doctor, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes was born in Paris on October 24 1932 and attended the École Normale Supérieure. After graduating he began research on neutron scattering and magnetism at the Saclay centre of the Commisariat à l'Énergie Atomique, taking a doctorate in 1957. In 1959 he studied with the solid state physicist Charles Kittel at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAfter 27 months of service in the French Navy, in 1961 de Gennes was appointed assistant professor of Physics at the University of Paris, Orsay, where he founded a research group studying superconductors. In 1968 he switched to studying liquid crystals, somehow managing to continue his research during the student unrest that paralysed other laboratories.\n\nIn 1971 he became a professor at the Collège de France, where he led research on polymers (complex synthetic chain-like molecules), describing how they moved and evolved. This research made it possible for scientists better to determine and control polymer properties. From 1976 until his retirement in 2002 he was director of the École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris.\n\nDuring the 1980s de Gennes developed an interest in the physical and chemical dynamics involved in the wetting of surfaces by liquids, analysing why water adheres to some but tends to be repelled by other surfaces - grapeskins for instance.\n\nThis research has had a highly practical application for wine producers, enabling the production of fungicide sprays which cover the whole grape instead of slipping off to form droplets at the base of the fruit.\n\nThe commercial spin-offs from his work on liquid crystals spawned a multi-billion-dollar international industry, and de Gennes was known to regret the fact that he and other theoretical scientists had derived little financial reward from intellectual property rights.\n\nBut de Gennes remained modest about his achievement. When the Nobel Prize jury described him as the \"Isaac Newton of our time\", he laughed off the description, putting it down to \"Nordic lyricism\"."
