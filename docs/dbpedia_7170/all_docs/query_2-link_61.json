They are mainly curiosity-driven. I combine experiments, theory, and molecular simulations to explore the intimate mechanisms of the dynamics of condensed matter from the macroscopic down to the molecular level.\n\nOne of my main thrust over the last 10 years is nanofluidics, the science of molecular flows. This world of the infinitely small in fluidics is the frontier where the continuum of fluid mechanics meets the atomic nature of matter, and even its quantum nature. There, we observe frictionless flows, emerging quantum effects, and memory effects, which now make it possible to dream of ionic computers.\n\nRecently, we unveiled and rationalized quantum friction effects, explaining for the first time the odd and nearly frictionless flows in carbon nanochannels. This opens the possibility to design a quantum engineering of water flows, as a new asset for future water technologies. A second objective is to design and fabricate artificial ânanoscale ionic machinesâ based on emerging properties and capable to reproduce the amazing functionalities of biological systems. Such artificial nanofluidic building blocks mimic their neuronal counterparts and allow designing simple computation architectures based on ions rather than electrons, showing elementary âlearningâ functionality using the nanofluidic circuitry.\n\nNanofluidics is also a field where there is a short path between fundamental science and disruptive innovation, because the sometimes 'exotic' nanofluidic properties offer unexpected solutions for multiple applications, notably for desalination, water remediation, or blue energy - notably osmotic energy. Our goal is to âmake it workâ. This fundamental research led to the creation of three start-up companies on these topics, \"Sweetch-Energy\", \"Hummink\" and \"Altr\".\n\nI have also a strong interest in the physics of everyday life, with contributions on stone-skipping, cooking, splashes, ironing, teapot effect, and currently on ski waxing, etc.\n\nAwards\n\nMember of the french Academy of Science (2022)\n\nERC Synergy Grant of the European Research Council (2022)\n\n2022-2023 Professor chair at CollÃ¨ge de France, Chaire d'innovation technologique L.
