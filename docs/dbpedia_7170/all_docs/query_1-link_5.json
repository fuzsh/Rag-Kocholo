        "text": "The physicist and Nobel laureate Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, who was hailed as the \"Isaac Newton of our time\" for his pioneering research on soft matter, has died aged 74. He was awarded the Lorentz medal and Wolf prize in 1990, and the following year received the Nobel prize in physics for \"discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalised to more complex forms of matter, in particular to liquid crystals and polymers.\"\n\nHis Nobel lecture, given on December 9 1991, was entitled Soft Matter. This is how he described it in his address: \"What do we mean by soft matter? Americans prefer to call it \"complex fluids\". This is a rather ugly name, which tends to discourage the young students. But it does, indeed, bring in two of the major features:\n\n\"1) Complexity. We may, in a certain primitive sense, say that modern biology has proceeded from studies on simple model systems (bacteria) to complex multicellular organisms (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates). Similarly, from the explosion of atomic physics in the first half of this century, one of the outgrowths is soft matter, based on polymers, surfactants, liquid crystals, and also on colloidal grains.\n\n\"2) Flexibility. I like to explain this through one early polymer experiment, initiated by the Indians of the Amazon basin. They collected the sap from the hevea tree, put it on their foot, let it \"dry\" for a short time. And, behold, they have a boot.\n\n\"From a microscopic point of view, the starting point is a set of independent, flexible polymer chains. The oxygen from the air builds in a few bridges between the chains, and this brings in a spectacular change. We shift from a liquid to a network structure which can resist tension - what we now call a rubber (in French: caoutchouc, a direct transcription of the Indian word). What is striking in this experiment is the fact that a very mild chemical action has induced a drastic change in mechanical properties - a typical feature of soft matter.\"\n\nBorn in Paris, until the age of 12 Pierre was educated at home by his father, a doctor, and his mother, a nurse. Subsequently, he studied at the École Normale Supérieure and in 1955 became a research engineer at the Saclay centre of the French atomic energy commission, the Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique, outside Paris. During this period he worked on the topics of neutron scattering and magnetism, gaining his doctorate in 1957.\n\nHe left Europe in 1959 to work as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. After returning to France, he served 27 months' national service in the navy before becoming an assistant professor in Orsay in Paris. There, his pioneering work in theoretical physics began with research into superconductors, but he soon moved his activities into the new and rapidly developing area of liquid crystals.\n\nAlmost immediately, he was developing the fundamental physical theories of liquid crystals which underpin today's understanding of this beautiful and delicate state of matter, ubiquitously found today in commercial flat-panel liquid crystal displays.\n\nIn 1974, Pierre detailed his theories in a textbook simply entitled The Physics of Liquid Crystals, which has become the world's most read and influential publication for scientists from all disciplines. Later, through his breadth of vision, he provided the analogy between smectic-A liquid crystals, superconducting metals and superfluid helium. In 1971, he became professor at the Collège de France, a research establishment in Paris, and through a collaboration with the University of Strasbourg, Saclay and the college, his work developed into the area of polymer physics, where he contributed greatly to knowledge of how polymer molecules evolve and move.\n\nHe subsequently became interested in interfacial problems, such as the dynamics of wetting and adhesion. In 1975 he became director of the École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris (ESPCI), until his retirement in 2002. During this time he added biology to the study of physics and chemistry, thereby developing a multidisciplinary institute. Apart from the Nobel prize, he received many awards, not only in France but also in Britain, Italy, Israel and the United States. He was an overseas fellow of the Royal Society of London.\n\nAfter receiving the Nobel prize, Pierre typically devoted himself to young people: over the course of three years he gave some 200 talks to high-school students on science, innovation and common sense. One instance was a memorable presentation to schoolchildren at the opening of the Sheffield University centre for molecular materials. He summarised this period of his life in his 1994 book Les Objets Fragiles (1994). During his career, he published more than 500 papers.\n\nPierre was a man of great charm and humour, capable of making others believe they, too, were wise. We will remember him as an inspirational lecturer and teacher, an authority on Shakespeare, an expert skier who attended conference lectures appropriately attired with skis to hand, and, robed in red, at the Bordeaux liquid crystal conference in 1978, took great delight in being inaugurated as a Vignoble de St Émilion. He is survived by his wife Anne-Marie and seven children."
