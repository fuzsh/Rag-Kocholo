        "text": "AN atom can be here, there and somewhere else all at once; it can be going both this way and that way; it can be rattling with internal energy and quiet. Such are the quirky freedoms of the quantum microworld that do not apply to automobiles, apples or people. But if there is an exception to this rule, it would be the mind of Dr. Steven Chu, the master of manipulating atoms and molecules who shared the most recent Nobel Prize in Physics with two other researchers.\n\nDr. Chu, a professor at Stanford University, ranges so widely among topics of interest to him that any attempt to keep up leaves a blurry succession of visual images, like a slide show inadequately describing one's dream vacation.\n\nHere he is clutching a Reuben sandwich while filling a steno pad with sketches of an experiment to stretch DNA molecules like knotted rubber bands. Here, he is in the back of a cab where he is alternately shouting instructions to the driver and quietly rationalizing his mega-celebrity status in Taiwan. This one shows him explaining the cosmological theory of multiple universes to the Dalai Lama. And finally, here, in his lab, Dr. Chu is pointing through the window of a vacuum chamber to a hovering blob of atoms that are trapped and supercooled by the forces of laser light -- the achievement for which he won the 1997 Nobel Prize.\n\nOn a recent day in his Stanford office, the 50-year-old, aggressively trim Dr. Chu, wearing khaki trousers, a pullover shirt and scruffy tennis shoes, sat on a puffy couch and held court for his students and research associates. He bounced between taking phone calls and bantering about projects that combine conceptual simplicity with a faint air of unbelievability. In one experiment, the drop of a ''fountain'' of atoms is clocked to measure gravity so precisely that the technique could be used like a petroleum dowser to find hidden pockets of oil. In others, a single DNA molecule marked with fluorescent dyes is dragged about as a video camera mounted on a microscope captures the reptilian motions.\n\n''I'm drawn towards the wilder, science-fiction-type stuff,'' said Dr. Chu, who grew up in Garden City, Long Island. ''It's much more fun for me to learn completely new things than it is to sort of ice the cake,'' he said. ''Well, that's part of the reason one is a scientist. It's not to just crawl into a little corner of some field and go to all of the meetings that all 50 of you in the world go to. 'Oh, this person twiddled that and look what happened.' After a while it becomes a little rococo, if you know what I mean.''\n\nThat adventurousness is reflected in Dr. Chu's recent moves from his original field of atomic physics into polymer science, chemistry and biology. But unlike the average scientific dilettante, Dr. Chu sees to it that this crosscutting work always bears the mark of his experimental dazzle and intuition for pay dirt. ''What Steve brings to science is an incredible technical virtuosity -- a sort of technical showmanship,'' said David Pritchard, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. ''There is this terrific scientific taste,'' added Daniel Kleppner, also of M.I.T. ''He has the vision to see new areas emerging. He's a damn good experimenter, but he's also highly creative.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
