Yet this village and its environs have revealed startling evidence for the external crises that convulsed the Mediterranean world at\n\nEmperor Justinian and his Court: Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nthe end of antiquity, and which clearly even reverberated as far afield as this picturesque corner of England. For near the village, at a site known as Edix Hill, archaeologists have excavated an early Anglo-Saxon burial site which would appear to go back to the middle years of the sixth century AD. Crucially, two years ago, study of the DNA preserved in the skeletal remains found there, revealed that two of those interred (comprising a mother and child buried armin-arm in the same grave), had died carrying bubonic plague, a plague which literary sources reveal had first arrived in the Mediterranean, via the Red Sea, in the year 541, and which clearly spread beyond the ‘East Roman’ (or ‘Byzantine’) empire of Justinian (r.527–65) with remarkable rapidity.\n\nAccording to a number of contemporary eye-witness accounts (including one by the great Greek historian Procopius, who was present when the plague first arrived in Constantinople), within the Mediterranean world, the advent of the bubonic plague caused a tsunami of human misery, and posed major problems to the Emperor Justinian, who was at that point engaged in the re-conquest of Italy to the West, and warfare with Persia to the East. Within the imperial capital, Procopius describes over ten thousand victims a day succumbing to the disease (an estimate that is largely consistent with the sort of mortality rates associated with later but related bubonic outbreaks). Justinian was obliged to respond with emergency legislation trying to impose price and wage controls, making it easier for people to make wills, and trying to prop up the empire’s ‘banking sector’. The plague also served to intensify apocalyptic expectations on the part of many of the emperor’s subjects, and led Justinian to crack down on pagans, heretics and others held responsible for the divine displeasure that had descended on his realm.\n\nImportantly, a sudden loss of taxpayers and military manpower exacerbated the empire’s existing fiscal and logistical problems, and would contribute to growing military and political instability in the late sixth century. The sixthcentury plague sapped the empire’s strength, thereby facilitating its seventhcentury collapse, when it would lose control of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt initially to the Persians, and then to the Arabs, united by the nascent faith of Islam. The plague tended to advantage less hierarchical and less urbanized societies over their more hierarchical and urbanized imperial foes, which were more structurally vulnerable and thus prone to collapse. It also had the effect of breaking down and disrupting ties of commerce and exchange between regions. Up until the middle years of the sixth century, for example, Justinian’s empire\n\nhad maintained commercial contact with communities in western Britain, seemingly exchanging imperial gold for tin. In the second half of the century, these connections appear to have broken down, facilitating Anglo-Saxon expansion as Romano-British resistance collapsed. What role such commercial ties played in the initial arrival of the plague in England is currently unclear, but the way in which the ‘Justinianic Plague’ served to fragment globalized networks of trade, and exacerbated and tested existing structural weaknesses within the most complex late antique societies, may resonate with our own experience today.\n\nMe. Us. Them: We Must All Be Social Philosophers Now Professor Philip Allott (1955)\n\nNever in the whole of recorded human history has humanity had to face so starkly the fragility and the complexity of the social aspect of human existence. Wars and natural disasters have something of the same effect, but on a limited scale. Climate change has begun to teach us that our personal behaviour, and the behaviour of businesses and governments, can affect the future of the planet and the future of humanity.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis is exceptional. It has placed the challenges of human social existence at the centre of the lives of everyone, since its consequences in terms of life and death immediately affect each human being individually and all human beings everywhere and all human societies. We all now know that our response to the challenges of social existence involves a mass of compromises worked out from day to day whose practical effects can prove to be very good or very bad and everything in-between.\n\nIt is in the family that we first discover the conflict between independence and interdependence. We are expected to do what is expected of us. Families become cities. Cities become nations. Nations co-exist. All of them must resolve the conflict of the one and the many in order to survive and prosper.\n\nIt is also in the family that we first learn of the problem of our identity, the conflict between the self and the other – me and them. We form our idea of our self and our needs and desires in the company of other people with their own identities. Self-interest is in a permanent struggle with shared interest. And so it is with cities and nations and all intermediate forms of human society.\n\nBrexit is a vivid instance of the struggle between the one and the many – independence and interdependence – does the EU increase or decrease what people call our ‘sovereignty’? – and also of the struggle between the self and the other – do British people see themselves also as Europeans? do Continental Europeans see us as Europeans? – us and them. Indeed, the EU itself is a massive set of compromises between nationalism and internationalism – national identity and European identity – national interest and common European interest.\n\nIlovetheeu, CC BY-SA 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons\n\nPeople’s Vote march, London, October 2019.\n\nThe eruption of Black Lives Matter during the coronavirus crisis has reminded us that the compromises of social existence are made in terms of shared values, including not only utilitarian values but also the very high values of justice and human dignity. In every society, from the most liberal democracy to the most autocratic dictatorship, interpretations of those values are ultimately enacted in the form of law.\n\nBlack Lives Matter has also reminded us that societies are systems of power, the expression of the human will, individual and collective. Power is unequally distributed, and the law, an application of power, may be the source of gross injustice and permanent violations of human dignity.\n\nWe know from human history that the struggle of identity can have terrible consequences when the idea of the other becomes a source of hatred, discrimination, persecution, violence, oppression, nationalism, war, and genocide. Human history is full of the evils caused by the transformation of Me and the Other into Us and Them.\n\nThe superficial response to these facts of human social existence is that they reflect human nature. That is how human beings have always been and always will be. This pessimistic view of human nature ignores the further fact that human beings have discovered how to create societies that allow millions, now billions, of people to have the possibility not only of surviving but also of flourishing. After millennia of oppression and exploitation, the mass of the people can now enjoy forms of life that had only been available to the most privileged members of society.\n\nWe fail to recognise this staggering achievement of the human mind and the human will. The idea of progress is ambiguous. Much that many people see as progress may be seen by many other people as symptoms of decadence. For example, the intense socialising of people in the twenty-first century, especially through the social media, may also be the insidious undoing of our powerfully creative individuality. But the possibility of human progress is now established as an integral part of human nature.\n\nLike climate change, the coronavirus crisis is a challenge to humanity. The historian Arnold Toynbee surveyed the rise and fall of what he called ‘civilisations’, that is, exceptionally powerful social systems that had a distinct identity. He identified civilisations that survive as those that responded successfully to existential challenges.\n\nAs in the case of climate change, our response to the coronavirus crisis has been primarily dominated by governments. It has been subject to much criticism. Retrospect will say whether they could have done better. Governments cannot now escape the fact that there has been a great increase in the sophistication of the thinking of their citizens about the way in which they are governed. Everyone is now thinking about it and talking about it and shouting about it. Black Lives Matter is contributing significantly to this new consciousness. The citizens have also shown a sense of responsibility in doing, individually and collectively, what governments have failed to do effectively.\n\nHistorical turning-points can only be seen in hindsight. In the meantime, it is not unreasonable to think that some deep form of human progress may emerge from what we are now enduring. We may believe that humanity is capable of responding successfully even to existential challenges that have no precedent in human history.\n\nThe following is from a diary written by Robin Louis Cuany, who was an undergraduate at Trinity from 1944 to 1947, reading Natural Sciences as a scholar and specialising in Plant Sciences in Part II. Born in Glasgow on 17 October 1926, Robin was educated at Manchester Grammar School. After graduating, he worked for five years in agricultural research in the Sudan, where he met his first wife Carolyn; he and Carolyn were married in 1951 in her home town of Washington, Iowa. Robin completed a PhD in plant breeding and genetics in 1954-8 at Iowa State University, after which he worked as a geneticist in Costa Rica for three years. From 1962 until his retirement in 1992, he taught genetics, plant breeding and international agriculture, first at the University of Iowa then at Colorado State University. Robin and Carolyn (who passed away in 2004) had six children: Gwendolyn, Marianna, Janet, Louella, Heather and Gordon. Robin, who married his second wife Peggy in 2008, now lives in a nursing home in Knoxville, Tennessee. Robin kept his ‘VE diary’ on small pieces of paper for three days, detailing his experiences on the day World War II ended (VE Minus 1 Day), and for the official VE-Day and VE-Plus One Day. The diary vividly portrays the chaos and euphoria of these times, interspersed with the mundanities of College life. It was recently rediscovered by his eldest daughter, Gwen Hines, who sent a scan and a transcript to the College. The edited text below is reproduced with Gwen’s kind permission.\n\nV E DIARY OF ROBIN CUANY (1944)\n\nVE Minus 1 Day\n\nOn 7 May 1945 I overslept and was woken by Arnold at about 9:15 am. We then breakfasted off a loaf and a cup of tea. I went off to a Botany lecture and practical from 10 to 1. After lunch we were all excited and listened nearly every hour to the news. At 3 pm we heard that the Germans had announced their surrender from Flensburg, but the time of Winston Churchill’s broadcast was not yet known.\n\nBob then called to see if we had heard the good news, and the three of us went down to the Post Office, to post a parcel, get some postal orders to send to the Youth Hostels we were going to stay at in the Long Vacation. I opened an\n\naccount in the P. O. Savings Bank, and as the book has to be sent up to Head Office every year, it will help to remind me of VE Day for years to come. On the way back Arnold and I bought a flag apiece at 2/6.1 We busied ourselves until teatime by making two more flags by painting post bags with red and blue inks and hanging them out – the best along with the bought one over Sidney St, the other overlooking the court.\n\nTea was eaten in Arnold’s rooms with Tom and Martin just after 4 pm, and we listened to the wireless until Hall time. After the usual prayer-meeting (Arnold, Gerald, Alan + myself) we turned the wireless on – about 7.40 pm ‒ and heard the following announcement:\n\n‘The Prime Minister – the Rt. Hon Winston S. Churchill C.H., O.M., will speak at 3 pm tomorrow, 8 May. The king will speak at 9 pm. Tomorrow is therefore Victory in Europe Day, and Wednesday 9 May is VE + 1 Day. Both days will be celebrated as national holidays.’\n\nWe then went round to Market Hill, the heart of Cambridge, but nothing unusual was happening. After listening to the 9 pm news at Bob’s, we went back to Market Hill and found people gathering around the SW corner. Soon there was quite a large crowd, heckling would-be orators, cheering the explosions of thunderflashes, always brought out for ‘rag’ occasions, and cheering an American MP and several paratroopers. Undergraduates climbed the fountain in the centre of Market Hill, with slight damage, and tied flags to the spike at the top. A Swastika was burnt to the roar of “Sieg Heil” from many throats. A car which we were using as vantage point was made rather shabby by the efforts of an RCAF officer to cross the canvas roof. I then helped to try to move the car round and turn on the headlights to shine on the flag on top of the fountain. Some police quickly restored it to its former position.\n\nBy this time the crowd had grown considerably and had taken up the cry, “We want the Mayor”. He did not appear ‒ but in the time-honoured rag fashion the paper salvage box by Great Saint Mary’s was set alight, and lighter fuel was used to build up the fire, to which were fed broken-up market stalls. A policeman helping to take these off again lost his helmet and stood by looking rather forlorn. Soldiers, sailors and undergraduates climbed lampposts, and the crowd\n\n1 Two shillings and sixpence\n\ncheered frantically when somebody appeared by the big illuminated clock on the Guildhall, and turned the hands back from 11 pm to 9:30. About 11.45 (correct time), the crowd began to dwindle, and Arnold and I got back into college, drank cocoa and ate precious chocolate biscuits.\n\nAt 12.30 a.m., the “billiard table” was lit up by several small fires, burning newspapers were let down from the upstairs windows, also a burning roll of toilet paper. Then a biscuit tin filled with gas was lit and blew up. A small wood fire on the base of the statue of Hermes (stolen last October) was used to heat a sparklet bulb, which blew up with terrific violence. This brought several people from their rooms, and a proper fire was lit with bags and some coal, on the statue base. We used Arnold’s tin tray to fan the flames, and Baron produced a song-book, so all 25 of us sat round in camp-fire fashion, and sang to an orchestra consisting of an accordion, two flutes, piccolo, oboe and violin. Alan Davies took two photos of us, with one-minute exposures. When we had exhausted our repertoire of songs, we took to hymns and carols, finishing with ‘Auld Lang Syne’ and the King. The fire was finally blown up about 3 am with another sparklet bulb.\n\nVE DAY\n\nTuesday 8 May 1945\n\nOwing to the late bedtime, I did not wake in time for breakfast, but as it was “rotten breakfast” (porridge and toast only) it did not bother me very much. When I went out into the street to see if anything was happening, there were several fire-engines about, and there was a rumour of Matthew’s coffee-roasting plant being on fire, but nothing seemed to be doing. Martin, Brian Powell and I got into the back of a fire-engine, and after a few false starts, we were taken along at great speed to the fire station, where we quickly jumped off. We walked back rather more slowly and met Arnold + Bob in the Market Hill.\n\nLoudspeakers from Miller’s were being fitted up on the balcony of the Guildhall, and floodlights on posts opposite, everywhere were flags and bunting, and on the front of the Guildhall, all the United Nations were represented, with America, Britain, China and Russia in the most prominent position; there was a ‘V’ and a crown of coloured light bulbs. There was an announcement over the loudspeakers to the effect that Churchill’s speech would be relayed at 3 pm, the Mayor, followed by a short service of thanksgiving, at 4pm, and the King at 9 pm. Music filled up the\n\nRobin on graduation day, 1947. spaces, and one of the most important ceremonies was the bonfire on Midsummer Common at 10 pm with dancing until 2 am.\n\nWe went for a walk on the Backs and leaned over Trinity Bridge for an hour watching the river traffic. We then decided to uphold our rights by flying bowls on the Scholars’ bowling green in front of the Library. We played for half an hour, with Arnold and Bob winning against Tom and me. Alan + Martin watched – the slope of the green needed careful judgement of the right bias to use.\n\nAfter lunch, Arnold and I went to Market Hill, where most of Cambridge had assembled. At least 50% of the women wore dresses with a dominant pattern of red white and blue, and many waved flags. Streamers were thrown all over the place, and many people were dancing in rings to music played over the loudspeakers. There were not many tunes, but they were played over and over again, and everybody was so happy that they didn’t mind. I saw hardly any couples dancing, all the dancers joined hands and whirled round in rings, which broke under the strain, but soon joined again. Most of us joined in one or two Palais Glides, and there was a long chain doing the Conga.\n\nTowards 3 pm everyone became hushed, and there was complete silence during Churchill’s speech, and everyone stood to attention while the National Anthem was played. Arnold then invited Hubert Jones and me to tea, which we just had time to swallow by 4 pm. We missed the Mayor’s speech but heard most of the simple service following. There were services almost hourly in Great Saint Mary’s, and the church bells often drowned the loudspeaker. A girl of 11 recited from the Guildhall balcony – a poem entitled, “They’ve got you Mr. Hitler; they’ve been coming after you.” After that the dancing started again, and a few danced right through a shower lasting about half an hour, though most people took shelter, and Hubert went back to his digs about 6 pm. I was so tired that I left Market Hill and went to Hall etc with streamers wound around my neck.\n\nDinner in Hall was a festive occasion. There was soup, roast beef, cabbage and roast potatoes followed by college pudding. Most important, there was a free glass of champagne, filled to the brim for everybody. After Hall, we held our usual prayer meeting and on returning to Arnold’s room, found it full of people. A cart bearing\n\neffigies of Hitler and his gang passed by along the street, and we all cheered it loudly, whereupon we had to give up our loose change for the Red Cross.\n\nWe then returned to Market Hill with Hubert and joined with a gang of his friends from Emma. Tom and Arnold wore squares which they had inherited from the previous occupants of their rooms. More dancing in rings took place, and once we had quite a large ring confined to Old Mancunians. Both the squares were lost, by being used for playing rugby, or by being thrown high over the heads of the crowd. At 9 pm the crowd stood in silence listening to the King’s speech, and then sang “God Save the King” with great vigour. A band countermarched in front of the Guildhall, then we joined a crowd of people all making for Midsummer Common. Some undergraduates and women in front of us, led by Alan Davies, did a peculiar sort of marching, with frequent changes of step. Some even wore evening dress.\n\nThere was most of Cambridge – town and gown – gathered there in a huge throng, with a space in the centre for a bonfire of old boxes and in fact anything\n\nOn the steps of Senate House, having been admitted as Master of Arts, 1951. Returning to Trinity in 2007.\n\nthat would burn – 30 ft across and over 10 ft high. Effigies of Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, and Goering, not forgetting Ribbentrop, were piled on top, and the fact that the torchlight procession arriving from Market Hill found the bonfire already alight, in no way detracted from the excitement. Searchlights round the edges of the Common directed their beams in a cone above the bonfire, and there was a hum from their generators which could be heard above the noise of singing, shouting and gramophone music relayed by a loudspeaker at one corner.\n\nEveryone roamed around, some in gangs, some in couples, and whole families parked themselves near the outside of the crowd. I lost Arnold near the beginning, and then Tom left me to go off to bed; later I found Arnold again, rather by luck than by searching. We then joined with a gang of Northerners, including Cross, Dickson, Gradwell and Hubert Jones. We tried dancing, but as no partners were forthcoming except drunken ones, we resumed our roamings. The fire had died down to a glowing mound of embers, and brave spirits darted across the space (about 30 ft wide) between the spectators and the embers.\n\nAbout 11.30 pm. there was quite a noticeable lowering in numbers and in the character of those who remained, and as Arnold and I left Midsummer Common, a couple of women, obviously under the weather, asked us for our gowns as souvenirs. We walked slowly down Jesus Lane, got to Sidney St about midnight, but decided to go and have a look at Market Hill. This was however deserted, so we climbed into college through the grating at 12.30 pm. We took some food and pots up to Martin’s where we had a feast of tinned salmon, meat paste, chocolate biscuits, orange squash and cake. We got to bed about 2.30 am.\n\nVE + 1 Day\n\nWednesday 9 May 1945\n\nI woke fairly early, in spite of the previous late nights, and had a shower before getting down to breakfast. I should also have done the laundry but neglected it as I thought it unlikely that the laundry would collect on VE +1. It turned out afterwards that they did collect, so my laundry arrangements went rather astray for the next two weeks. The first half of the morning was spent in getting a few clothes, a lot of sandwiches and some lemon squash ready, for Tom and I\n\nTrinity members carrying out practice manoeuvres with the College fire engine, May 4 1941.\n\nwere going for a day’s sailing (originally only an afternoon) with Arthur Adam. We left Cambridge about 11 am, getting to Waterbeach (the temporary home of the CU CrC,2 on the Cam SC’s3 premises) soon after 11.30. It was however 1 pm before we set off properly, as we had to come back for a baking tin to remove a certain quantity of water which seeped in through the centreboard case.\n\nWhen we got started, we ran with the wind aft down to Bottisham Lock, rowed through it, hoisted the sails again and ran at a respectable pace about 7 miles down river till we came to the first bridge below Clayhythe – Dimmocks Cote. Here the wind got rather fresh, so we took in a reef, had our lunch, and then found when we tried to start back that there was not much wind to beat against and progress was slower and slower as far as Upware. After that we sailed when there was a breath of wind, but it deteriorated into a long row back, especially as the current is fairly strong in the lower reaches; so we did not get back to Waterbeach till 8 pm. After towing the sails and so on, we set off home on our bicycles, arriving at 9.20 pm.\n\nTom and I ate a hearty supper of more than a loaf between us and finished after 10 pm. He went to bed as he felt tired, but I conquered the latter sensation and climbed out of the grating to see what was happening in the way of celebrations.\n\nMost of the day had been taken up by the Dagenham Girl Pipers, the Home Guard Brass Band, and a bugle band, countermarching and playing stirring tunes in front of Addenbrooke’s Hospital. There was an exhibition of Highland dancing by the DGP on Christ’s Pieces. In the evening and till 2 am there was dancing on Christ’s Pieces, Parker’s Piece and on Market Hill in front of the Victoria Cinema. In general, there was less of the carefree revelry of VE Day, probably because people were thinking about getting back to their jobs to help beat the Japanese in the Far East.\n\nI went straight to Parker’s Piece via Market Hill, and from 10.30 to 11.30, roamed around, occasionally meeting people I knew, but for the most part entirely on my own. The crowds were almost as huge as those on Midsummer Common the night before – the search lights were out in full strength again giving a display of weaving beams. Several aircraft dived low over the area, making a deafening\n\n2 Cambridge University Cruising Club 3 Cambridge Sailing Club\n\nrow. Thunderflashes went off now and again, with shrieks and cheers as an accompaniment. There was Miller’s loudspeaker system, playing through the records that most people knew so well.\n\nAbout 11.30 pm I found Bob with Wendy + Trudy, having just come over from Christ’s Pieces. I joined them in ring dancing, a Palais Glide and a Conga. About midnight we went off arm in arm with some other LSE friends to their digs at the back of Parker’s Piece, where we were given a cup of tea. Bob + I made our way home through the streets with Wendy + Trudy, singing at the top of our voices. When we got to Whewell’s Court, I saw my window lighted, and guessing that Arnold and Martin had probably been listening to the wireless, I shouted up to them. Martin and I agreed to go down to the river for a 1 am bathe. I showed Wendy + Trudy the grating – our way in “after hours,” and bade them goodnight, and Bob and I climbed in by his window to join Arnold and Martin.\n\nWe got down to the river and undressed, but finding it too cold, decided not to risk double pneumonia but to dress again. We got back into Whewell’s Court in Bob’s window, Trinity St and the grating. After orange squash, Martin left us and Arnold and I finished the day with a short prayer meeting, getting to bed about 2.30 am.\n\nWearing his Trinity tie with pride, 2017. ‘Our dad remembered his time at Cambridge with great fondness and always looked forward to receiving any Cambridge publications and devouring them. Going through his office after he became a patient in the nursing home four plus years ago, I ran across many of them with some hand-written notes on some. I also found among his things an old tie which I was about to toss when I wondered if he had kept it for a particular reason. He was having great memory problems, but nevertheless when I showed him the tie and asked about it, he immediately told me it was his Trinity tie, so of course I had him put it on. He even managed to tie it, and I took a photo.’\n\nGwendolyn Hines\n\n© BY-SA 3.0 Wikimedia Commons\n\nSrinivasa Ramanujan, The Personal Friend of Every Integer Béla Bollobás (1963)\n\nIntroduction Srinivasa Ramanujan, who died one hundred years ago, was an extraordinary mathematical genius, perhaps the most remarkable Fellow of Trinity ever. He was largely self-taught: he rose to amazing heights by teaching himself from one or two books. And, unlike Newton and Gauss, he was not only a mathematical genius, but also a kind-hearted, modest and very generous man. In this brief essay I shall say only a few words about his life, and even less about his mathematics, as I do not wish to be technical.\n\nIndia Ramanujan was born into a Brahmin family on 22 December 1887. In accordance with custom, his mother had gone to her parents in Erode, Tamil Nadu to give birth to her first child. After a few months, she returned with him to their home\n\nin Kumbakonam, about 140 miles east of Erode and 170 miles south of Madras. Ramanujan’s father and grandfather were low-level accountants, gumastas, to local cloth merchants. His mother bore five more children, two of whom lived into adulthood.\n\nRamanujan, like some other brilliant scientists, started to speak late: in his case, when he was four years old. On the other hand, his mathematical ability manifested itself early, when he was not quite ten: he came first in his district’s Primary Examination; this enabled him to pay half-fees in his school. In his teens, Ramanujan taught himself mathematics, relying mostly on two books. First, when he was twelve, he borrowed Loney’s Plane Trigonometry from an older student and solved every problem in that book. S.L. Loney (1860–1939) was a good mathematician: he was 3rd Wrangler in 1882, then a Fellow of Sidney Sussex and later a professor at Royal Holloway College. Although his book was first published in 1893, it is still in print; in particular, in India it is required reading for aspiring scientists. While in the fifth form, Ramanujan discovered Euler’s formulae for sine and cosine and was disappointed that he had been pipped in his discovery.\n\nThe second book, which he borrowed from the Government College library in 1903, awakened his mathematical genius, and greatly influenced the way he was to do mathematics. This was A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics by George Shoebridge Carr (1837–1914), an unusual and very large book first published in 1880, made famous by its influence on Ramanujan. It contains over 4000 theorems, from easy observations to difficult theorems, with either no proof at all, or with only a brief indication of a possible proof. Carr intended his book to be an aid to students preparing for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, but for Ramanujan it opened up the wonderful world of mathematics. Even the style of the Synopsis rubbed off on Ramanujan: as paper was expensive, he worked on a slate and transferred his finished results into his treasured notebooks, without bothering with proofs.\n\nHe learned much mathematics from the Synopsis, which had a considerable amount on algebra, calculus and geometry, three fundamental areas of mathematics. However, this book had essentially nothing on the complex function theory that our undergraduates learn in their second year, or the theory of elliptic functions, to which Ramanujan was to make profound contributions. In fact, before he left India, Ramanujan had not even heard of Cauchy’s theorem, a cornerstone of the theory of complex functions. The great importance of the Synopsis was that it lit the fire of Ramanujan’s everlasting love of mathematics. When, later in his life,\n\nFormulae from Ramanujan’s first notebook.\n\nRamanujan studied elliptic functions, he did so without any use of the theory of complex functions, so it is likely that he also studied Alfred George Greenhill’s book, The Applications of Elliptic Functions, with its old-fashioned presentation of elliptic functions. The subject is rich in infinite series and products close to Ramanujan’s heart, and Ramanujan soon became a master of their formal manipulations. Also, as a fully-fledged mathematician, he was the undisputed champion of continued fraction expansions of analytic functions: he must have learned the basic theory of continued fractions from Carr’s book.\n\nOn a personal note, I first heard of Ramanujan, along with Hardy and Littlewood, from the great peripatetic Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős (1913–1986), whose student I was from my early days. Erdős regularly visited Cambridge from 1934 until his death over fifty years later, and he spent a term with us as a Visiting Fellow Commoner. When I was fifteen or sixteen, he told me that Ramanujan had the greatest ‘natural’ mathematical talent ever. By the unusual adjective ‘natural’ he meant talent without the influence of other mathematicians, the talent one is born with. Erdős, like most mathematicians, admired Ramanujan for rising to amazing heights in spite of all the disadvantages he had to face.\n\nErdős was also an admirer of the two great Cambridge mathematicians, Godfrey Harold Hardy (1877–1947) and John Edensor Littlewood (1885–1977). The Hardy‒Littlewood partnership, which had started in 1910 and went on until the death of Hardy, was the greatest partnership mathematics has ever seen:\n\nthe two of them dominated mathematical life in Britain. Erdős also remembered Hardy’s ratings of mathematicians based on pure talent on a scale from 0 to 100. Hardy gave himself a score of 25, Littlewood 30, Hilbert 80, and Ramanujan 100. Poor Littlewood! Although Littlewood is widely considered to be the greatest British mathematician of the twentieth century, in this list he suffered from Hardy’s modesty: as Hardy did not want to rate himself highly, he brought down Littlewood considerably. (Most mathematicians consider the German David Hilbert (1862–1943) to be the greatest mathematician of the twentieth century.)\n\nMy admiration for Ramanujan has stayed with me for good, and I even passed it on to my future wife, but I never expected to have a chance to discover more about him than I could learn from Erdős. That came about when, fifty years ago, I was awarded a Title A Fellowship, and my wife and I had the great fortune to get to know Littlewood very well indeed. Soon, he was happy to talk about Ramanujan, revealing more than he had done before.\n\nIn January 1904 Ramanujan won a scholarship to the Government College, Kumbakonam, for his proficiency in Mathematics and English. However, he was so devoted to mathematics, eager to make new discoveries, that he neglected his studies, failed in the subsequent examination and lost his scholarship. Several more failures followed in Kumbakonam and Madras. When in 1907 he took the First Examination in Arts at the University of Madras, he failed English (badly) and Sanskrit (just), and he passed Mathematics with middling marks. When some years later Ramanujan became a Scholar at the University of Cambridge, an official in Madras wrote disapprovingly: “It certainly seems somewhat of a scandal to the University that a man like this should have failed in the FA Exam.” I doubt that he was right, but perhaps Madras could have rewarded Ramanujan’s amazing talent in mathematics by ignoring his performance in other subjects.\n\nIn the summer of 1909 Ramanujan’s mother arranged a marriage between him and Janaki Ammal, the nine-year-old daughter of a distant relative. This marriage was more like an engagement in our society, and Janaki did not come to live in Ramanujan’s house until 1912. After his marriage, Ramanujan was desperate for regular employment, but because of his unfortunate college history, he found this very difficult to obtain. Eventually, at the beginning of 1912 he became a clerk in the Madras Port Trust Office, earning 30 rupees a month (about 20 pounds a year). In the evenings he continued to work on mathematics and was very keen to show his results to mathematicians he\n\nhoped might appreciate them. His labours slowly bore fruit: Seshu Aiyar and Ramachandra Rao befriended him, and the former mathematicians Narayana Aiyar and G. T. Walker also took to him. Nevertheless, there was nobody who could properly appreciate Ramanujan’s results apart from the not-tooexciting papers he published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society and the Messenger of Mathematics. (These papers can be belittled only in view of Ramanujan’s later stature as a giant of mathematics.)\n\nUrged on by his friends and well-wishers, Ramanujan communicated some of his discoveries to several major mathematicians in England; only one replied, and not even that reply was encouraging. Then Ramanujan decided to write to G.H. Hardy in Trinity, and that letter changed his life. The letter, dated 16 January 1913, went as follows:\n\nDear Sir, I beg to introduce myself to you as a clerk in the Accounts Department of the Port Trust Office at Madras on a salary of only £20 per annum. I am now about 23 years of age. I have had no University education but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school I have been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at Mathematics. I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a University course, but I am striking out a new path for myself. I have made a special investigation of divergent series in general and the results I get are termed by the local mathematicians as “startling”.… I have been developing this to a remarkable extent so much so that the local mathematicians are not able understand me in my higher flights. … I would request you to go through the enclosed papers. Being poor, if you are convinced that there is anything of value I would like to have my theorems published. I have not given the actual investigations nor the expressions that I get but I have indicated the lines on which I proceed. Being inexperienced I would very highly value any advice you give me. Requesting to be excused for the trouble I give you. I remain, Dear Sir, Yours truly, S. Ramanujan P.S. My address is S. Ramanujan, Clerk Accounts Department, Port Trust, Madras, India.\n\nThe letter continues with dozens and dozens of bare statements of theorems, mostly formal identities extracted from his notebooks. It was rather unfortunate that Ramanujan’s very first theorem, about the number of primes, was incorrect. But Hardy was not put off. As Littlewood told me, the day the letter arrived (at the end of January), Hardy told him about it, and the two of them discussed the statements at dinner, in the Combination Room when having port, and after that in Littlewood’s rooms. Even if most of the statements had been false, the collection would have been a great topic of conversation. As it turned out, they found that some of the statements were incorrect, and some were correct but either known or could be deduced (by them!) from known results, but some others completely baffled them. Several of the statements they found extremely beautiful and totally mysterious. A great mathematician had emerged\n\nHardy and Littlewood in New Court in 1920 Photograph of H. Cramér\n\nfrom nothing! Ramanujan’s choice of Hardy could not have been better. Hardy was compassionate and the champion of the downtrodden: with the help of Littlewood, he was more likely than anyone to help Ramanujan.\n\nThat Hardy and Littlewood were thrilled by this letter was there for everyone to see in the College, as shown in this excerpt from a letter of Bertrand Russell (at the time one of the mathematics lecturers in the College) to Lady Ottoline Morrell on 2 February 1913:\n\nIn Hall I found Hardy and Littlewood in a state of wild excitement, because they believe they have discovered a second Newton, a Hindu clerk in Madras on £20 a year. He wrote to Hardy telling of some results he has got, which Hardy thinks quite wonderful, especially as the man has had only an ordinary school education. Hardy has written to the Indian Office and hopes to get the man here at once. It is private at present. I am quite excited hearing of it.\n\nAlthough Hardy wasted no time in writing to the India Office in strong support of Ramanujan, he took his time in answering Ramanujan himself. Clearly, he did not want to send a superficial reply: he wanted to treat Ramanujan as a professional mathematician of high standing. In particular, he was not shy to point out that some of the results were incorrect. Eventually, he sent his reply on 8 February 1913:\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was exceedingly interested by your letter and by the theorems which you state. You will however understand that, before I can judge properly of the value of what you have done, it is essential that I should see proofs of some of your assertions. Your results seem to me to fall into roughly 3 classes: (1) there are a number of results which are already known, or are easily deducible from known theorems; (2) there are results which, so far as I know, are new and interesting, but interesting rather from their curiosity and apparent difficulty than their importance; (3) there are results which appear to be new and important, but in which almost everything depends on the precise rigour of the methods of proof which you have used. As instances of these 3 classes I may mention …\n\nRamanujan’s letter gave Hardy and Littlewood plenty to do, as they wanted to prove or disprove all its assertions. Although they were the best mathematicians\n\nin England, this work took them quite a while. Here is an excerpt from a letter of Littlewood to Hardy from Treen in Cornwall after the Lent Term of 1913: Dear Hardy, The stuff about primes is wrong. (3) is the usual formula save for the terms coming from the zeros of ζ(s). It’s known that … From his formula it would follow that … [and so a contradiction would follow].\n\nAnd later:\n\nI have a vague theory as to how his mistakes have come about. I imagine that he is satisfied if he can convince himself that his results are correct and he has probably staked on certain operations on divergent series involving primes being legitimate. His results are just what one would get if ζ(s) had no zeros in σ > 0. … My hopes are that he has made important discoveries about continued fractions and elliptic functions. … I can believe that he is at least a Jacobi. … How maddening is his letter in the circumstances. I rather suspect that he is afraid that you’ll steal his work. Hardy’s letter to India immediately changed Ramanujan’s fortune: Sir Francis Spring (1849–1933), the Chairman of the Madras Port Trust, and G.T. (later, Sir Gilbert) Walker (1868–1968), formerly Fellow of Trinity, who was the Senior Wrangler in 1889, the Director General of Observatories in India, obtained a special scholarship for him, which was tenable for two years. It paid Ramanujan 75 rupees a month, which was sufficient for a married Indian to live decently. This scholarship was indeed special ‒ as the Registrar wrote to the Government: “The regulations of the University do not at present provide such a special scholarship. But the Syndicate assumes that Section XV of the Act of Incorporation and Section 3 of the Indian Universities Act, 1904, allow of the grant of such a scholarship, subject to the express consent of the Governor of Fort St George in Council.” Ramanujan left his clerical post on 1 May 1913, and from then on was a professional research mathematician for the rest of his life.\n\nCambridge Hardy was anxious to bring Ramanujan to Cambridge, but as a Brahmin was not allowed to cross the ocean, Ramanujan declined to accept the offer, greatly\n\ndisappointing Hardy. In his continuing correspondence with Ramanujan, Hardy kept pointing out to no avail the advantages of even a short stay in Cambridge. But a few months later, things had changed.\n\nAt the beginning of 1914, Eric Neville (1889–1961), who was a Fellow of Trinity at the time, was invited to Presidency College, Madras, to deliver a course of lectures. (Neville first came to fame as Hardy’s favourite to be the Senior Wrangler in 1909, the last time the strict order of merit was decided in the Tripos. As it happened, Neville came second behind Percy Daniell (1889–1946) of Trinity and ahead of Louis Mordell (1888–1972) of St John’s.) Having been alerted by Hardy to the existence of Ramanujan, Neville’s gentle persuasion, modesty and unassuming manner worked wonders, so that, having obtained his mother’s permission, Ramanujan agreed to go to Cambridge. A substantial grant was obtained, which Ramanujan was happy to announce to Neville, with a request to take him to Cambridge:\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am happy to tell you that I am given a scholarship of £250 a year for at least one year and to be extended for one more year if the reports at Cambridge are favourable. I am starting on March 17 from Madras by the B.I. boat SS “Nevasa” and travel by sea throughout my journey. … I request that you will take me or at least send somebody to London as I am new to anything and everything.\n\nAnd that is how it was: Neville asked one of his brothers, the proud owner of a Jowett motor car, to take him to meet Ramanujan and bring them back to their house in Chesterton Road. Ramanujan spent a few days with Neville and his wife, Alice, before moving into Trinity to start his very fruitful adventure in Cambridge. The Nevilles remained Ramanujan’s friends throughout his stay in England.\n\nRamanujan settled into his rooms in Whewell’s Court and started to get used to European ways. However, as a strict Brahmin, he never went to Hall to have his meals, and as there was no other Brahmin to cook for him, he had to cook for himself in his rooms. When the Great War broke out, that became even harder, as there were food shortages, especially of Indian comestibles. He was also obsessed with mathematics, so occasionally worked for 30 hours at a time, and then slept for 20. To save time, he tended to cook for several days, leaving the remnants of his meals in the cooking pot.\n\nAfter the degree ceremony, with Ramanujan in the centre.\n\nFor the first time in his life, he was really comfortable, free of financial worries. He had no duties whatsoever and could do as he pleased. He wanted to get a Cambridge degree, and Hardy arranged that he could get his B.A. by research, so that he did not have to attend lectures. In 1916 Ramanujan was indeed awarded his B.A. As Ramanujan was frequently in contact with great mathematicians, who liked him and appreciated his work, he was in seventh heaven. In addition to Hardy and Littlewood, he was greatly supported by Major Percy Alexander MacMahon (1854–1929), who worked on number theory and combinatorics, two areas favoured by Ramanujan. MacMahon was the first British mathematician to write a book on combinatorics: in the first volume, published in 1914, he already popularized Ramanujan’s achievements by having a chapter entitled Ramanujan’s Identities.\n\nIn 1914 the teaching of Ramanujan was shared by Hardy and Littlewood, but that changed when Littlewood was called up. Hardy was worried that one man was far from enough to teach a genius like Ramanujan. In fact, he had sleepless nights about how to teach Ramanujan without destroying or even damaging his boundless confidence. He just could not have been more careful and loving in his relationship with Ramanujan, and in return Ramanujan never showed anything but boundless respect, trust and gratitude. Quoting Hardy:\n\nWhat was to be done in the way of teaching him modern mathematics? The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. Here was a man who could work out modular equations, and theorems of\n\ncomplex multiplication, to orders unheard of, whose mastery of continued fractions was, on the formal side at any rate, beyond that of any mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of the Zeta-function, and the dominant terms of many of the most famous problems in the analytic theory of numbers; and he had never heard of a doubly periodic function or of Cauchy’s theorem, and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of a complex variable was. … All his results, new or old, right or wrong, had been arrived at by a process of mingled argument, intuition, and induction, of which he was entirely unable to give any coherent account.\n\nIt is impossible to ask such a man to submit to systematic instruction, to try to learn mathematics from the beginning once more. I was afraid too that, if I insisted unduly on matters which Ramanujan found irksome, I might destroy his confidence or break the spell of his inspiration. On the other hand, there were things of which it was impossible that he should remain in ignorance. Some of his results were wrong, and in particular those which concerned the distribution of primes, to which he attached the greatest importance. … In a few years’ time he had a very tolerable knowledge of the theory of functions and the analytic theory of numbers. He was never a mathematician of the modern school, and it was hardly desirable that he should become one; but he knew when he proved a theorem and when he had not. And his flow of original ideas shewed no symptom of abatement.\n\nWith Hardy’s substantial assistance, Ramanujan could prepare his results for publication. Clearly, the write-up of Ramanujan’s long paper (63 pages) on highly composite numbers owes more to Hardy than to Ramanujan. They also embarked on several joint projects. Their joint study of the `normal number of prime factors’ was based on Ramanujan’s intuition and Hardy’s technique. The later simpler proof by Paul Turán led Paul Erdős and Mark Kac to the foundation of probabilistic number theory. A major project of Hardy, Ramanujan and others concerned the partition function p(n), the number of ways of writing n as a sum of positive integers. (Thus, p(4) = 5 since 4 can be written as 4, 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1 and 1+1+1+1, while p(5) = 7, since 5 can be written as 5, 4+1, 3+2, 3+1+1, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1 and 1+1+1+1+1.) The partition function seems very difficult to pin down, but, guided by Ramanujan’s intuition and the help of MacMahon, who calculated by hand the first 200 values of p(n), Hardy and Ramanujan managed to get an amazingly precise asymptotic formula for p(n).\n\nRamanujan’s postcard to Hardy, urging him to prove a precise result. He also mentions Major MacMahon’s help.\n\nAs is clear from the postcard above, it was only due to Ramanujan’s belief in the possibility of a crazily good approximation that they got their result. The first five terms of their approximation give p(200), although this number is enormous, 3972999029388.\n\nRamanujan writes:\n\nIt would therefore follow from your arguments that the error by taking about β √ n/ log n terms is O(log n) −3/2. … It therefore appears that, in order that p(n) may be the nearest integer to the approximate sum, s need not be taken beyond β √ n/ log n and cannot be taken before α √ n/ log n.… I hope you can easily prove these. … Major MacMahon was kind enough to send me a typewritten copy of the 200 numbers. The approximation gives the exact number. I think you know this already from him. With kind regards to your mother and sister. Yours sincerely, S. Ramanujan\n\nThe method of proof of this Hardy‒Ramanujan paper on partitions led to the powerful Hardy‒Littlewood circle method, an important technique in analytic number theory. Ramanujan also proved remarkable divisibility properties of p(n); e.g. if n − 4 is divisible by 5, so is p(n), and if n − 5 is divisible by 7, so is p(n). (As a sanity check, recall that p(4) = 5 and p(5) = 7.)\n\nA favourite field of Ramanujan was the theory of modular equations. As Mordell wrote:\n\nSome of these equations can be solved very simply, while the solution of others involves a wonderful collection of surds. It was chiefly in these subjects that Ramanujan’s best work was done. They gave him ample scope for his exceptional and brilliant genius, which displayed such wonderful imagination, intuition and insight. For formal manipulation of infinite processes and an instinctive feeling for algebraical formulae, he was unrivalled since the time of Euler and Jacobi. His fertility in producing a host of strange and curious results was unbounded and ceased only with his death.\n\nFrom P. C. Mahalanobis (1893–1972), the great statistician, we know of a lunch he had with Ramanujan. While Ramanujan was preparing their vegetarian meal, Mahalanobis read him a puzzle from The Strand magazine, which was roughly this. In a street the houses are numbered 1, 2, …, n, where n is at least 50 and at most 500. My friend, who lives in number k, has noticed that the sum of the numbers smaller than his are equal to the sum of the numbers bigger than his. How many houses are in the street, and where does my friend live? To explain the question, let us take a smaller example. If there are at most ten houses in the street then the answer is that there are eight houses in the street and the friend lives in number 6, because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 7 + 8. After a little thought, Ramanujan replied: “there are 288 houses and the friend lives in 204”. “How could you do it so quickly?”, asked the amazed Mahalanobis. “By continued fractions”, came the reply.\n\nRamanujan’s success in Cambridge was greeted with great enthusiasm in India. As Seshu Aiyer wrote in 1917, “the day on which he sailed to England will now become a red-letter day in the history of our national triumph and glory.” All went well with Ramanujan till the spring of 1917, when he fell ill. In May 1917 he was admitted to the Nursing Hostel in Thompson’s Lane, which he left in September, only to return to another sanatorium in early October. From then on, he was in and out of various sanatoria. Towards the end of 1918 he was in Colinette House, Putney. It was Hardy’s visit there that made the number 1729 memorable for all mathematicians. When Hardy said that the number of his cab, 1729, was boring, Ramanujan was amazed: “But Hardy, how can you say that? It is the smallest number which is the sum of two cubes in two different ways.” Indeed, 1729 = 103+93 = 123+13. This is an example of Littlewood’s opinion that “Every natural number was Ramanujan’s personal friend.”\n\nRamanujan’s letters about his election to the Royal Society.\n\nAs to the nature of Ramanujan’s illness, there have been many suggestions. First, he was believed to have a gastric ulcer: later that diagnosis was changed to tuberculosis, and then to metastatic liver cancer. Upon his return to India, the firm verdict was again tuberculosis. The most recent diagnosis, proposed over seventy years after Ramanujan’s death, is hepatic amoebiasis. It is likely that Ramanujan had dysentery already in his teens. In early 1918 or so Ramanujan attempted suicide by throwing himself in front of an underground train which, fortunately, stopped just in time. Ramanujan was arrested, and Hardy personally intervened to get him released, as a suicide attempt was a criminal offence. It is possible that Ramanujan was discharged into the care of Hardy with the condition that he stay under medical supervision for twelve months. Throughout his illness, he continued to work, although rather spasmodically, till the very end. By the end of 1918 he seemed to be better and, since it was suspected that the climate in England was retarding his full recovery, he left England at the end of February 1919, arriving in Madras at the beginning of April. In spite of the excellent medical care that he received, his health remained precarious.\n\nTowards the end of his life, two great honours were bestowed on him: he was the first Indian to receive either of these honours. First, in 1917, Hardy, Littlewood and MacMahon nominated him for a Fellowship of the Royal Society. It is a tribute to the standing of the proposers and to the genius of Ramanujan that he was elected on the first occasion, on 28 February 1918. Then, in October, Hardy and Littlewood managed to get Ramanujan a Fellowship at Trinity. In fact, contrary to what Ramanujan imagined, this election was not straightforward: Littlewood got two doctors’ certificates of the soundness of Ramanujan’s mind which, eventually, he did not have to use. The Prize Fellowship awarded to Ramanujan was worth £250 a year for six years.\n\nHardy immediately wrote to the Registrar of the University of Madras: “He will return to India with a scientific standing and reputation such as no Indian has enjoyed before, and I am confident that India will regard him as the treasure he is.” In response to this the University of Madras awarded Ramanujan £250 a year for five years. Ramanujan’s response was extraordinary, showing what an exceptional man he was. It is impossible not to be touched by Ramanujan’s modesty, warm heart and generosity. Here is his letter in full.\n\n2 Colinette Road, Putney, S.W. 15 11th January 1919\n\nTo The Registrar, University of Madras. Sir, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 9th December 1918, and gratefully accept the very generous help which the University offers me. I feel, however, that, after my return to India, which I expect to happen as soon as arrangements can be made, the total amount of money to which I shall be entitled will be much more than I shall require. I should hope that, after my expenses in England have been paid, £50 a year will be paid to my parents and that the surplus, after my necessary expenses are met, should be used for some educational purpose, such in particular as the reduction of school-fees for poor boys and orphans and provision of books in schools. No doubt it will be possible to make arrangements about this after my return. I feel very sorry that, as I have not been well, I have not been able to do so much mathematics during the last two years as before. I hope that I shall soon be able to do more and will certainly do my best to deserve the help that has been given me. I beg to remain, Sir, Your most obedient servant, S. Ramanujan.\n\nReturn to India Back in India, Ramanujan worked ferociously, whenever his illness allowed it, producing more of his astonishing formulae. He worked much on q-series and collected his results in a notebook that was to be named his “lost notebook.” He sent only one letter to Hardy, about the introduction of his mock-theta functions, which turned out to be very important. Sadly, in spite of the best medical care and the improved climate, he died on 26 April 1920.\n\nRamanujan’s Legacy Today, Ramanujan’s star is higher than ever before. The results in the notebooks left behind by Ramanujan are most attractive to an expert, but also very demanding. The great Hungarian analyst George Pólya (1887–1985), who put the Stanford Mathematics Department on the map, and with whom Hardy and Littlewood wrote their fundamental book on inequalities, was captivated\n\nby Ramanujan’s formulas. One day in 1925, while he was visiting Oxford, he borrowed Hardy’s copy of Ramanujan’s notebooks. A couple of days later, he hastened to return them, explaining that however long he would keep them, he would try to verify formulas therein and never again would have time to prove another original theorem. The mathematics community owes a great debt of gratitude to George Andrews and Bruce Berndt for their monumental work on Ramanujan’s notebooks, helping all to appreciate Ramanujan’s achievements. Also, Andrews was the mathematician who located Ramanujan’s last notebook in the Wren Library, and he brought it to the attention of the public as ‘Ramanujan’s Lost Notebook’. Ramanujan’s ideas turn up in an impossibly wide range of fields, including analytic number theory, sphere packing, three-manifold quantum invariants, black holes, string theory, the theory of partitions, signal processing, and Ramanujan graphs.\n\nPostscript It is regrettable that the 2015 Hollywood film about Ramanujan (The Man Who Knew Infinity) was so unfair to Trinity, England, Hardy, Littlewood and MacMahon. And most people learn about Ramanujan from that film. Hardy and Littlewood (and Trinity) deserve enormous credit for their immediate support of Ramanujan. There was never any friction between Hardy and Ramanujan: there was no ‘boxing match’ between them, as in the film, with Ramanujan grumbling that he did not come to Cambridge to learn mathematics but to publish his results. Hardy, Littlewood and MacMahon were totally colour blind, anything but racist. In particular, rather than looking down on Ramanujan, as in that film, Major MacMahon was a great supporter of his. And so on. Both the popular book about Ramanujan and the Hollywood film came about because of a documentary that was broadcast in 1987 in the Equinox series. This documentary, entitled Letters from an Indian Clerk, was made by Christopher Sykes; it can be found on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=OARGZ1xXCxs. The film has an interview with Janaki Ammal, Mrs Ramanujan. Sykes found her living in appalling poverty, so after the film had been finished, I applied to the College Council for generous monthly support for her, which was granted without any hesitation.\n\nThe Fellowship\n\nThe Master and Fellows October 2020\n\nMaster\n\n(Appointed 2019) Professor Dame Sally Davies GCB, DBE, FRS, FMedSci\n\nFellows\n\nElected\n\n1993 D Professor Grae Worster Applied Mathematics.

In fact, they select the information that helps us to navigate the world, which the brain then turns into a seamless approximation of our surroundings. The brain’s capacity to do this is a predictable outcome of natural selection: animals that are able to filter relevant from irrelevant information can move more nimbly through the world than those overwhelmed by the complexity of their surroundings.\n\nThe relevance of sensory data, meanwhile, depends on the species – the scurrying of a mouse is more interesting to a hawk than to a cow – so each species sees a different approximation of the world. Few scientists have done more to aid our understanding of how the eyes and the brain co-create that approximation than Horace Barlow, the great-grandson of Charles Darwin.\n\nAs a postgraduate at Cambridge from 1947–50, under the supervision of the Nobel prizewinning physiologist Edgar Adrian, he studied the eyes of frogs and found that particular neurons within the retina fired nerve impulses in response to a moving dot of light. He theorised that these neurons had the job of noticing small, quick-moving objects, thus enabling the frog to see flies and catch them. Barlow was the first to realise that nerve cells within the eye detect particular “trigger features” in the visual scene that cause the animal to behave a certain way.\n\nIn 1953, when he was a research fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, Barlow made another discovery in his work on the frog’s retina. He wanted to find out how accurately neurons add up the signals they receive from photoreceptors – cells in the eye that detect light. He found that as he increased the size of the dot of light shining on the eye, the neuron would send more impulses to the brain, as he expected. Yet beyond a certain size, increasing the size of the dot would actually decrease the number of impulses. Barlow realised that surrounding photoreceptors must be inhibiting the neuron, thus filtering out superfluous information.\n\nThis discovery confirmed Barlow’s hunch that the purpose of the visual system is to eliminate redundant information. He was fond of the dictum of the philosopher William James, that “the sense of sameness is the very keel and backbone of our thinking”.\n\nHorace Basil Barlow was born in 1921 in Chesham Bois, the son of Sir Alan Barlow, a civil servant, and Nora (née Darwin). His mother passed her forebear’s curiosity about the natural world on to him. Barlow was educated at Winchester College, where he was enthused by physics, but began to doubt his abilities when placed in a class with James Lighthill and Freeman Dyson, who became outstanding mathematicians, and Christopher Longuet-Higgins, who became a theoretical chemist. Instead, he focused on biology.\n\nWith the Second World War looming, Barlow studied natural sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge, with the intention of helping the war effort as a doctor. He joined the Natural Science Club, to which he gave a talk on the perception of colour.\n\nHe did his clinical training at Harvard Medical School and University College Hospital, London, then heard that Adrian might be able to offer him a studentship to conduct research back in Cambridge. “Pinning Adrian down was never easy,” Barlow recalled. He finally got his attention by stepping out in front of his bicycle.\n\nIn their meeting, Adrian, a standoffish man, dismissed all Barlow’s ideas, and asked him instead to follow up on research by Marshall and Talbot into small eye movements. Barlow spent six months studying their hypothesis that these movements made vision more acute, then decided with characteristic boldness that it was bunk and instead began his study of frogs’ retinas.\n\nIn 1964 he left Cambridge to become professor of physiology at the University of California, Berkeley. He later returned to Cambridge, where he was Royal Society research professor of physiology, and a fellow of Trinity College. He could still be found in his office in his nineties, and loved college life, especially the serendipitous conversations with whoever happened to sit next to him at high table. He liked to hear about subjects other people were working on, and when he broached the topic of his own work it would often be from an aslant angle – for instance, its relevance to the observation of art. An amateur cellist, he played in an orchestra in Cambridge and several quartets.\n\nHe met his first wife, Ruthala Salaman, through their families; hers, like his, had an illustrious scientific pedigree. Her grandfather Redcliffe Salaman had bred blight-resistant potatoes. They married in 1954 and had four children, Rebecca, a mathematician, Natasha, a doctor, Naomi, an artist, and Emily, a Hebraist and foster carer. His marriage to Salaman ended in 1970. He met his second wife, Miranda Weston Smith, when she asked him to contribute to an encyclopaedia of things we don’t know. They married in 1980 and had one son, Oscar, an IT consultant, and two daughters, Ida, a neuroscientist, and Pepita, an economist.\n\nEver the discerning statistician, he reckoned that his relatives’ longevity augured well for him, and he was right.\n\nHorace Barlow, neuroscientist, was born on December 8, 1921. He died on July 5, 2020, aged 98.\n\n© Times / News Licensing, 17 August 2020.\n\nFamily\n\nProfessor Sir Michael John Berridge FRS (1938–2020)\n\nSir Michael Berridge, biochemist behind a paradigm shift in cell science.\n\nHis research on the salivary glands of the blowfly shed light on the biology of disease from cancer to neurological diseases.\n\nSir Michael Berridge, who has died aged 81, was a physiologist and biochemist whose discovery of the mechanism whereby cells convert external stimuli into the internal signals that govern their behaviour led to a paradigm shift in scientific understanding of cell regulation and shed light on the biology of disease from cancer to cardiovascular and neurological diseases.\n\nScientists discovered long ago that proteins, such as growth factors or hormones, act as messengers in the body, but most of them stop short at the membrane that surrounds the cell. Inside the cell, calcium ions seemed to be responsible for triggering different types of cell behaviour, but the mystery was how signals from outside were carried into the cell to mobilise calcium.\n\nBerridge’s studies on cell signalling began with research on the salivary gland of the blowfly, where he established that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and calcium worked together as intracellular “second messengers” to control fluid secretion. Others had shown how receptors within the cell membrane translate external stimuli into production of cyclic AMP, but the links to calcium signals were not known.\n\nBerridge devised methods that exploited the ability of insect salivary glands to secrete copious amounts of saliva which they must do if the fly is to feed before being swatted. This preparation allowed him to show that external stimuli caused the formation of an intracellular molecule called inositol trisphosphate (IP3) by degrading a component of the membrane around the cell.\n\nHe described his discovery as “a eureka moment” and the paper, published in Nature in 1983, in which he set out for the first time the role of IP3 as a calciummobilising messenger, became one of the most cited in the field.\n\nWhile his early work on fly spittle had been considered arcane by many, it paved the way for the discovery of the links between extracellular stimuli and calcium signals.\n\nIt quickly became clear that IP3 was a ubiquitous intracellular messenger, and that its ability to release calcium from intracellular stores regulated processes as diverse as fertilisation, development of the early embryo, muscle contraction, communication between nerve cells, blood clotting and much more, including cell death.\n\nBerridge’s influential reviews and beautifully crafted talks brought the significance of IP3 signalling to a wide audience, and recognition that it also provided insight into diseases as diverse as cancer, bipolar disorder, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nMichael John Berridge was born on October 22 1938 in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Inspired by a childhood love of nature and an enthusiastic biology teacher, he read Zoology and Chemistry at the University of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.\n\nAfter graduating with a First, he won a Commonwealth Scholarship to do a PhD on nitrogen excretion in the African cotton stainer (a red bug) at the University of Cambridge under the entomologist Sir Vincent Wigglesworth.\n\nHe became interested in how hormones stimulate insect cells to secrete saliva and went on to do postdoctoral research on cell signalling at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, and then at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.\n\nReturning to Cambridge in 1969, he became senior, and later principal, scientific officer of the Agricultural and Food Research Council Unit of Invertebrate Chemistry and Physiology at the university’s Department of Zoology. He served as senior principal scientific officer of the Unit of Insect Neurophysiology and Pharmacology from 1978 until 1990. He was also appointed a fellow of Trinity College in 1972 and inspired generations of Trinity natural scientists in his stimulating cell biology supervisions.\n\nHe then joined the Laboratory of Molecular Signalling of the Babraham Institute, the life sciences research institution situated six miles outside Cambridge, as deputy chief scientist. He became head of the laboratory in 1994, when he was also appointed honorary professor of cell signalling at the university. On his retirement in 2004 he was appointed the first Emeritus Babraham Fellow.\n\nBerridge’s breakthrough discovery led to a lifelong interest in the role of calcium in normal and diseased cells and tissues, and he inspired and supported many PhD students, enthusing them with the story of his own research career and endowing an annual prize which recognises research excellence by PhD or postdoctoral scientists.\n\nThe importance of his work was recognised with the award of many international prizes. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1984, and to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999. He was a founding member of the Academy of Medical Sciences, and in 1998 was knighted by the Queen for “service to science”.\n\nMichael Berridge married, in 1965, Susan, née Graham Winter. She survives him with their son and daughter.\n\nSir Michael Berridge, born October 22 1938, died February 13 2020.\n\n© The Telegraph, 23 February 2020, Telegraph Media Group Limited 2020.\n\nProfessor John Frank Davidson FRS FREng (1926–2019)\n\nChemical engineer whose childhood obsession with bubbles led to an effervescent career studying their science and beauty.\n\nAs a boy John Davidson would fill the bath at his Newcastle upon Tyne home and then pull the plug to observe the vortices, eddies and swirls. Later as a chemical engineer at Cambridge, where for many years he was one of the world’s leading authorities on bubbles, his experiments were highly regarded.\n\nHe designed and built a rig to hold bubbles stationary in a downward torrent of water – yielding not only important advances in the science, but also a beauty all of its own, with ripples at the base of each bubble and a stationary, almost hyperbolic form above. His pioneering work on fluidisation led to the design of the catalytic cracking reactors that produce much of the world’s petrol.\n\nDavidson’s algebraic analysis was characterised by elegance and simplicity. While others needed weeks or months of labour to produce opaque computer models, he – with the right simplifying assumptions and a few equations – was frequently able to unlock the understanding of otherwise intractable problems.\n\nThis combination of aesthetic, scientific and mathematical elegance bore fruit in his study of fluidised beds – systems widely used in petrochemical and process industries, in which a fluid (usually a gas) is blown through a mass of particles, making them separate slightly so that the mixture of solids and gas begins to behave like a fluid.\n\nDavidson’s elegant theory predicted that the gas flowing through bubbles in large fluidised beds would “trap” pockets of gas to move with it in a vortex ring – like the smoke ring from a cigar. This surprising prediction was later shown to be accurate in experiments, first at Harwell and then at Cambridge. The result was of great practical importance because it explained why the amount of contact between gas and solids in large reactors could be much less than that implied by small-scale experiments.\n\nJohn Frank Davidson was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1926 in modest circumstances. His mother, Katie, was a primary school teacher; his father, also\n\ncalled John, a cashier with the city council, died when his son was nine. After Heaton Grammar School he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, during the Second World War, and came top of the engineering tripos.\n\nIt was in the engineering department that he met his future wife, Susanne Ostberg, a lively and ebullient refugee from the Holocaust; they married in 1948 and she died in 2011. Neither was bothered about ideas for their own sake, but about what ideas would practically achieve. Both had considerable strength of opinion and of character. They had a son and a daughter: Peter, a chemical engineer, and Isabel, a senior government lawyer who is married to Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Conservative MP for West Dorset. They had an exceptionally long and happy married life, first at Derby for two years, where Davidson worked at Rolls-Royce on the first commercial jet engines, and then at Cambridge after he won a research fellowship at Trinity College. Money was short during the early decades of their marriage. However, he was a masterhandyman about the house and at weekends he was to be found in overalls doing maintenance on the family car. Visiting undergraduates were likely to find that their bikes had been repaired during their stay. In his Who’s Who entry he listed “mending domestic artefacts” as his hobby, alongside “upholstery”.\n\nDavidson remained a fellow of Trinity College for well over 60 years, serving as steward and vice-master. His tendency to understatement, his delicacy of expression and his puckish humour made him a popular colleague, and he always took a strong interest in the practical aspects of college life.\n\nWhen the fellowship was divided over whether food should be brought into the dining hall via a new route, he adopted the scientific approach. As a result of spending six hours observing the flow of food in three other colleges that had arrangements similar to those proposed, he was able to confirm that there was little or no risk of near misses, let alone collisions, in the relevant passageway. As with his work on fluidisation, this prediction subsequently proved accurate.\n\nAs well as being Shell professor of chemical engineering at Cambridge, Davidson was a fellow of the Royal Society, a founder fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, president of the Institution of Chemical Engineers, and a foreign member of the Russian Engineering Academy (1998). Among many other accolades, his scientific achievements earned him the royal medal of the Royal Society in 1999.\n\nDuring a long retirement he continued to do important academic work, cycling (or, once he had reached his nineties, driving himself) to the chemical engineering lab almost every day until his last weeks in hospital.\n\nProfessor John Davidson, chemical engineer, was born on February 7, 1926. He died on December 25, 2019, aged 93.\n\n© Times / News Licensing,21 January 2020.\n\nDr Roger David Dawe (1934–2020)\n\nUnorthodox scholar whose Oedipus Rex guide was a bestseller and who would rip open his shirt to reveal lines from The Iliad.\n\nThe land is ravaged by plague and a popular leader with a complicated family life struggles to protect his people from a crisis he does not fully understand. Oedipus Rex may seem as relevant to readers today as it did to the Athenians who first saw it in 429BC.\n\nFor more than three decades, anyone who studied Sophocles’s masterpiece for A level or as an undergraduate was likely to have been guided by the commentary edited in 1982 by Roger Dawe, a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Though far from his most scholarly work – he claimed to have written it in three weeks – this volume in the Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics series was his bestseller, going through a dozen reprints and a new edition in 2006. The book also played a cameo role, to his glee, in an episode of the Channel 4 comedy Green Wing.\n\nOne of the foremost Greek textual critics, Dawe cast a forensic eye over the medieval manuscripts, anxious to find and correct small errors made by the monks that did not fit his understanding of what was authentic. Most controversially, he argued with force that the final 100 lines of Oedipus Rex were a later addition, based on a lack of dramatic quality and a series of linguistic problems. “Everything from this point to the end of the play is spurious,” he claimed, “and the voice of Sophocles is heard no more”.\n\nThis book was, as he said, “a little by-product of more austere researches”, such as the three scholarly editions of the complete works of Sophocles that he produced between 1975 and 1996 for Teubner. One reviewer said it was full of “brilliant insights [that] no serious scholar should do without” but lamented that Dawe had ignored any other academic of the previous half century. This was in character: he disliked most modern literary critics. A colleague described him as a “keen pontifrax”, eager to burn bridges. He hated cruelty to all species, save certain academics.\n\nYet even those who strongly disagreed with him could find things to praise. Dame Mary Beard said that when she wrote a book on laughter in the ancient world she received generous advice from Dawe, who had edited the Philogelos, a Greek joke book. She also remarked that for all their disagreements over the interpretation of Greek drama, he had given her invaluable advice on the crucial matter of who makes the best Christmas puddings.\n\nRoger David Dawe was born in 1934 in Bristol, where his father was a university academic, and educated at Clifton College before going up to Gonville & Caius, Cambridge. There he achieved a starred first and won the Porson Prize for Greek verse composition, an award previously given to Benjamin Hall Kennedy (of Latin Primer fame) and Enoch Powell.\n\nHaving acquired at a young age a fellowship at Caius and a 1930s Bentley, he travelled widely in Europe inspecting the manuscripts of the Greek dramatist Aeschylus. He was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1963 and began his research on Sophocles that would earn him a DLitt. In 1993 he published a translation and analysis of The Odyssey aimed at the Greekless. An unusually populist work for him, it failed to sell, in part because it ran to 900 pages and cost £50.\n\nHe held at times visiting fellowships at Harvard and the universities of Illinois and Colorado. “His work will be respected and consulted by students of Sophocles so long as Sophocles is read in Greek,” a colleague said.\n\nIt was on a visit to Vienna that he met his future wife, Kerstin Wallner, a Swedish student and talented artist. They married in 1960 and had two children, Simon, an accountant, and Susie, a nurse. As the family expanded into a house on the outskirts of Cambridge, a child-friendly Volvo replaced his beloved Bentley, though he kept its spare tyres in his garage.\n\nHaving resigned as a university lecturer after not being given the senior post that he felt he had been promised, Dawe retreated, Achilles-like, to his tent at Trinity, where he was popular with students for his irreverence and eccentricity. Each new intake would pass on outlandish tales that he never quite denied. Had he really pulled out a starter’s pistol in a lecture and threatened to shoot the next person to make a mistake? Or ripped open his shirt to reveal the first few lines of The Iliad written on a T-shirt, an act received with more enthusiasm when he did it in America than in Cambridge? And then there was the time he digressed mid-lecture on Sophocles’s Electra into a discussion of the sinking of the Bismarck, drawing the flotillas on the blackboard.\n\nHis teaching of Greek verse composition, a dying art requiring the skills of a crossword-solver as much as a wide vocabulary and strong grammar, was patient and kind, despite his tendency to squeal “Yikes” at disastrous efforts. After two years, he would sigh: “Well, I think we are getting somewhere.”\n\nHe was competitive about how his students performed compared with those at other colleges but less enthusiastic about university standards generally. At a graduation he asked one pupil’s nine-year-old sister what she wanted to be when she grew up. “A vet or a hairdresser,” she replied. “Well we cater for the former here,” he said, then added: “And the way this place is going I’m sure we will soon offer the latter.”\n\nSurprisingly fond of low culture, he would pepper supervisions with quotations from Carry On and James Bond films (“That’s a Smith & Wesson and you’ve had your six,” he would say to someone making persistent errors.) He also loved Gilbert & Sullivan and Mozart’s Don Giovanni, as well as tennis.\n\nAfter his wife died in 1999, he reduced his tuition but took pleasure in teaching English to immigrant members of the college staff. In 2018, he moved to live with his daughter near Cognac, where he wound down his life by indulging his love of old sitcoms, especially Dad’s Army. To die in Cognac, he might have remarked in years past, should be every Cambridge fellow’s ambition.\n\nRoger Dawe, classical scholar, was born on September 15, 1934. He died of pneumonia on February 16, 2020, aged 85\n\n© Times / News Licensing, 15 April 2020.\n\nChris Harris\n\nProfessor Freeman Dyson (1923–2020)\n\nCambridge-educated theoretical physicist and author reckoned to have one of the most original minds of the 20th century.\n\nOne talent Freeman Dyson possessed in abundance was dreaming. In the 1950s he imagined cruising around the solar system “exploring the planets and moons, just as Charles Darwin cruised with the good ship Beagle around the Earth exploring the continents and islands”. His “fuel” for propulsion? Two thousand nuclear bombs.\n\n“The basic idea is absurdly simple,” he said. “One is amazed that nobody thought of it before.”\n\nThis was no mere fantasy. It was part of the Orion project, funded by US taxpayers through the Department of Defence. Dyson worked on the project for six years before it was killed off by the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, banning the use of nuclear weapons in space.\n\nHis was one of the most brilliant and original minds of the 20th century. To call him a theoretical physicist and mathematician hardly begins to describe him. But, British-born, he died largely unrecognised by this country beyond a fellowship of the Royal Society conferred when he was 28. He was said to be the best physicist never to receive a Nobel prize, and arguably should have shared the 1965 physics prize with Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga.\n\nThey won it for their work in quantum electrodynamics, Dyson’s prime discipline. On a Greyhound bus ride in 1949 Dyson realised that the rival formulations of quantum electrodynamics, one by Feynman and the other by Schwinger and Tomonaga, were identical and could be synthesised.\n\n“I think it’s almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel prize,” Dyson said, “you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years.
