Blacklow, Sackler Scholar 2018/2019, is currently the Gustavus Adolphus Pfeiffer Professor and Chair of the Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School, and a member of the Department of Cancer Biology at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Prof. Blacklow received his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University in 1991, completed his residency in Clinical Pathology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and carried out postdoctoral research at the Whitehead Institute with Prof. Peter S. Kim. His initial faculty appointment was at Stanford University in 1996, where he remained until rejoining the HMS faculty at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in 1998.\n\nResearch led by Prof. Blacklow’s team has shown how cell surface receptors can convey a developmental signal directly from one contacting cell surface to the next and then from the membrane to the nucleus. He has elucidated key molecular events in Notch signal transduction, a conserved cell-cell communication system that influences cell fate decisions in all metazoan organisms, and that is frequently hijacked as an oncogenic driver in human leukemia. His laboratory uncovered how activating mutations of the Notch1 receptor frequently found in human T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma overcome normal restraints on signaling resulting in autonomous gain-of-function, and spurred the development of inhibitory antibodies that suppress normal and oncogenic Notch signaling as candidates for further clinical development.\n\nProf. Blacklow was named a Pfizer Scholar in 1997, a Pew Scholar in 1999, and an Established Investigator of the American Heart Association in 2002. He has given research presentations at numerous national and international meetings, including plenary talks at Keystone Symposia and the inaugural Murray Goodman Symposium of the American Chemical Society. Prof. Blacklow directed the MD-PhD Program in Basic and Translational Sciences at Harvard Medical School from 2007-2012, and has served on Advisory Committees for pre-clinical departments, graduate programs, and MD-PhD programs at several major research universities and institutions, including Stanford, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\n\nMartin Blaser, MD\n\nThe Frederick H. King Professor of Internal Medicine and Chair, NYU Langone Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York City , Martin.Blaser@nyumc.orgSandra.Fiorelli@nyumc.org\n\nProfessor MARTIN BLASER, Sackler Lecturer 2010-2011. The Frederick H. King Professor of Internal Medicine and Chair, Department of Medicine at the New York University School of Medicine since April 2000. He also is Director of Medical Services at Tisch and Bellevue Hospitals, and Professor of Microbiology. Dr. Blaser?s research has focused on bacterial pathogenesis, having worked for more than 30 years on the role of Campylobacter and Helicobacter species, among other organisms, in human disease. After early studies on the pathogenic Campylobacter species, much work since 1985 has involved the gastric bacterium H. pylori. His work linked the relation of colonization to inflammation, and to gastric cancer. His studies identified vacA and cagA, the two major virulence genes, and showed differential disease risk associated with particular alleles. Dr. Blaser developed a conceptual framework involving unique dynamic equilibria between H. pylori populations and colonized hosts, which has become a general model of persistence for co-adapted microbes. His explorations of H. pylori diversity have shown the intercontinental spread of these organisms in pre-historic times, and he is increasingly interested in the role of H. pylori and other normal microbiota in human health, including protective roles against adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, asthma, and obesity. He holds 24 US patents relating to his Campylobacter and Helicobacter research, and has authored over 460 original articles. He has received many honors for his work including the Wade Hampton Frost Award from the American Public Health Association, and the AACR-American Cancer Society Award for Research Excellence in Cancer Epidemiology. He served as President of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and currently serves as Chair of the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Cancer Institute, on the Advisory Board for Clinical Research of the National Institutes of Health, and on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.

D. degree in Biochemistry in 1981 from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1982 he moved to the NIH where he pursued post-doctoral studies with Dr. Richard D. Klausner. He rose through the ranks and in 1997 he became the Chief of the Cell Biology and Metabolism Branch at the NIH. Throughout his career, Dr. Bonifacino has been interested in the molecular mechanisms that determine protein localization and fate in the secretory and endocytic pathways. Since the early 1990s, Dr. Bonifacino's group at the NIH has conducted research on signals and adaptor proteins that mediate protein sorting to endosomes and lysosomes. His group discovered new sorting signals and adaptor proteins (i.e., AP-1B, AP-3, AP-4, GGAs), and elucidated the mechanisms by which these function. In addition, Dr. Bonifacino applied the knowledge gained from these studies to the elucidation of the causes of various human diseases including Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 and autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease. His work has been published in over 190 scholarly articles. Dr. Bonifacino serves or has served as associate editor of the journals Developmental Cell, Molecular Cell and Molecular Biology of the Cell, and editorial board member of The Journal of Cell Biology, The Journal of Biological Chemistry and Traffic. He is also the co-editor of the books Current Protocols in Cell Biology and Short Protocols in Cell Biology.

Haldane, Sackler Lecturer 2018/2019, who shared the 2016 Nobel Prize for Physics with David Thouless and Michael Kosterlitz, is the Sherman Fairchild University Professor of Physics at Princeton University. He is also a foreign associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society and the Institute of Physics (UK).\n\nProf. Haldane received his Ph.D. in theoretical condensed matter physics from Cambridge University, under the direction and mentorship of Philip W. Anderson (Nobel Laureate in Physics 1977). Previously to his appointment at Princeton University he worked at research labs including the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France), the University of Southern California, the Bell Laboratories and the University of California, San Diego.\n\nProf. Haldane was awarded, a share of the Nobel Prize for his theoretical work on “topological states of matter”, including the pioneering work on (unexpected and initially controversial) “topological quantum states” of one-dimensional systems of magnetic atoms and on his theoretical prediction from 1988 of (ferromagnetic) topological insulators exhibiting the “quantum anomalous Hall effect”. On his work on “topological quantum states” of one-dimensional systems of magnetic atoms, he had received the Oliver Buckley Prize of the American Physical Society in 1993, and on his theoretical prediction of (ferromagnetic) topological insulators exhibiting the “quantum anomalous Hall effect”, which was later observed experimentally in 2013, he had received the 2012 Dirac medal of the International Center for Theoretical Physics (Trieste) with Charles Kane and Shou-Cheng Zhang.\n\nProf. Haldane’s work helped to open up new directions and ways of thinking about quantum effects in condensed matter. In recent years, “topological quantum matter” has grown into an active experimental field, who many believe may provide platforms for “quantum computing. Along with this, he had also initiated the field of “topological photonics”. He currently works on “quantum geometry” in the “fractional quantum Hall effect”.\n\nProf. Haldane was born in London in 1951, of mixed Scottish and Slovenian origins. Despite having three forenames, he is unrelated to the famous biologist J. B. S. Haldane.\n\nDavid Weiss Halivni\n\nClassical Jewish Civilization, Columbia University, New York, USA, dw13@columbia.edu\n\nProfessor DAVID WEISS HALIVNI, Recipient: Israel Prize 2009, Talmud Research; Sackler Scholar 1998/1999.

Computer Science Department, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York since 1996. He received a B.Sc. in Mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1975 and a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Harvard University in 1981. In between, he spent two years as the Head of the Mathematics Department at Bawku Secondary School, in Ghana. After a year as a visiting scientist at MIT, he joined the IBM Almaden Research Center in 1982, where he remained until 1996, also serving as a Consulting Professor at Stanford University. Prof. Halpern's major research interests are in reasoning about knowledge and uncertainty, security, distributed computation, decision theory, and game theory. Together with his former student, Yoram Moses, he pioneered the approach of applying reasoning about knowledge to analyzing distributed protocols and multi-agent systems. He has coauthored 5 pa"
