        "text": "A pitch isn‚Äôt just a presentation; it‚Äôs your story, your passion, and your startup‚Äôs future, all rolled into one. It‚Äôs about sparking curiosity and drawing people into your vision. üåü And when you pitch, you‚Äôre not just targeting investors or fundraising; you‚Äôre building relationships with any stakeholder, including potential users or partners or collaborators. MIT Female Founders Pitch Competition was the first time I had pitched in a while and the opportunity was such a great reminder on why a powerful pitch is your best foot forward. Excited to keep iterating on my startup story and building how I tell my vision. üéâ ‚ú® #StartupLife #Entrepreneurship #Pitching #Innovation #StartupSuccess #PitchCompetitions\n\nPapapolitis & Papapolitis advised Dukes Education in connection with the #acquisition of the shares of the \"I.S.A.

During this discussion, Hannah Subayi Kamuanga, Erick Yong, and Abraham Augustine explored emerging trends in secondary sales and their impact on the ecosystem. They also delved into the different players involved and how they benefit, the challenges encountered, and the specific opportunities for angel investors and angel groups. ‚¨áÔ∏è If you'd like to learn more about secondary exits and related topics, the full video is available on our YouTube channel (link in comments below).\n\nAs the graduate school application deadlines draw near and the frantic recommendation letter writing season kicks into high gear, I was happy to see our alumnus Jean-Philippe Hicke featured in the MIT Sloan School of Management Master of Finance spotlight post. Jean-Philippe graduated from the NUS-Sciences Po dual degree program and was one of the outstanding students in my EC4304 \"Economic and Financial Forecasting\" class in 2017. Exactly five years ago, I was writing letters for his master's applications, and he eventually got accepted into all of the strong programs he applied for, EXCEPT for the MIT Sloan MFin. Having completed his M.Sc. in Economics, Data Analytics, and Corporate Finance at √âcole Polytechnique, Jean-Philippe tried again and cracked the code this time! At MIT, he ended up program mates with another NUS dual degree in Economics and Statistics alumnus, Jiaxin Li, who, you guessed it, did exceptionally well in my EC4308 \"Machine Learning and Economic Forecasting\" class :) Congratulations, Jean-Philippe Hicke, on a very well-deserved achievement! I am sure you are just getting started :) For the current and prospective National University of Singapore students in Economics and Data Science and Economics: 1) NUS undergraduate education in economics and data science gets you ready for the best graduate programs in the world (but you have to do your work and take the relevant courses, which may be tough; no two ways about it). 2) You must find something you are passionate about and work toward your goals. 3) Success does not come by itself. You may and probably will fail at some point, but if you are patient and stay your course, you can make things happen! #NUS #economics #shapeyourfuture #proudteacher\n\nWe're all very proud at Times Higher Education today, having won two prestigious private capital awards last night in the British Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (BVCA) 2023 Awards! Times Higher Education (THE), backed by Inflexion, has won the national medium-sized company award and it was also a winner in the regional category for London and the South East in the British Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (BVCA) Vision 2023 awards presented yesterday evening. The judging panel said they were ‚Äúvery impressed‚Äù by THE‚Äôs submission, which scored highly against the four themes for growth, competitiveness, innovation, and environmental, social and corporate governance. Paul Howarth, our chief executive, said that there was ‚Äúno other business quite like THE offering the breadth and depth of products and services across higher education, on a global basis‚Äù.

Today's event is the largest in school history with over 500 attendees from around the world, ranging from MBA students interested in the industry to seasoned executives and investors. The lunchtime keynote was a fascinating discussion between Polsky's Faculty Director Professor Steven Kaplan and KKR Co-Head of Global Private Equity Peter Stavros. Some insights from that discussion include: - KKR is increasingly using ESOP mechanisms to ensure the incentive (and upside) structure of deals extends within their portfolio to a wider segment of employees...this also helps build wealth for line workers. There is a 10x multiplier on value creation in giving employees equity. - When investing, Pete focused on how KKR has learned to continually deploy capital rather than taking vintage risk or trying to time the market. - Leadership truly matters, and KKR searches for empathetic CEOs who make it a personal mission to understand the needs of their employees - Pete's philosophy is to \"get results in the right way\" and encouraged everyone to focus on changing the 40% \"quit rate\" for most employees in the US - There were predictions that more models will be created to open up alternative asset classes like private equity to individual investors (versus only institutions or very high net worth individuals) Great job by the student leadership and my team in the Polsky Center in arranging a productive conference!"
