NCAM ist eine bundesweite Querschnittstudie mit zunÃ¤chst vier Runden der Datenerfassung (sogenannten Wellen) zwischen 2015 und 2018. Jedes Jahr wird eine bundesweit reprÃ¤sentative Stichprobe aus 3.000 Personen im Alter von 14 bis 45 Jahren befragt. Die Querschnittsbefragung wird durch eine Kohorte von nÂ =Â 450 aktuellen Solariennutzern ergÃ¤nzt. Die erste Welle im Jahr 2015 ergab eine GesamtprÃ¤valenz der Solariennutzung von 29,5Â %. Elf Prozent aller Teilnehmer hatten in den vergangenen zwÃ¶lf Monaten ein Solarium genutzt. Zu den Determinanten der aktuellen Solariennutzung gehÃ¶rten jÃ¼ngeres Alter, weibliches Geschlecht und Vollzeit-/TeilzeitbeschÃ¤ftigung. Die hauptsÃ¤chlichen BeweggrÃ¼nde, die fÃ¼r die Nutzung eines Solariums genannt wurden, waren Entspannung und AttraktivitÃ¤tssteigerung. NCAM ist weltweit die erste Studie zur Ãberwachung der Risikofaktoren fÃ¼r Hautkrebs in jÃ¤hrlichen Intervallen anhand einer groÃen, landesweit reprÃ¤sentativen Stichprobe. Erste Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass Millionen Deutsche trotz Warnungen der WHO Solarien nutzen, und dass viele dieser Nutzer Jugendliche sind - trotz gesetzlicher BeschrÃ¤nkungen, die das Ziel haben, die Nutzung von Solarien durch MinderjÃ¤hrige zu verhindern.

C'est la contribution originale de cette these au champ de l'education, plus specifiquement a l'etude sociologique de l'enseignement superieur ou sont concentrees les activites liees a la triade thematique du programme doctoral dans lequel elle a ete produite : recherche, formation et pratique. L'enquete-terrain a ete realisee en 2009 et 2010 aupres de 808 repondants affilies a 60 etablissements au Quebec et a produit un vaste materiau de nature mixte (donnees quantitatives et qualitatives). Un portrait de la nebuleuse biotechnologique qui touche les secteurs des sciences de la sante, des sciences naturelles et du genie a ete realise. Ce domaine concerne des dizaines de disciplines et se revele de nature transdisciplinaire, mais les pratiques n'y sont pas davantage marquees par le changement que celles d'autres domaines connexes. Les dynamiques sociales ont fait l'objet d'analyses comparatives dans quatre contextes: le choix des programmes, des objets et des methodes, le financement, la diffusion et la planification de la carriere. Les resultats indiquent que les echanges entre les agents traditionnellement situes au coeur des activites de recherche dominent ces dynamiques dans tous les contextes etudies. L'etude des representations au fondement des pratiques a revele l'existence de trois ecoles de pensee qui coexistent dans le champ scientifique: academique, pragmatique et economiste. Ces ecoles permettent de categoriser les agents en fonction des zones de fractures qui marquent leurs oppositions tout en identifiant ce qu'ils ont en commun. Les representations et les pratiques liees a la formation temoignent d'un habitus plutot homogene, alors que les contradictions semblent plus souvent ancrees dans des\n\nCH4 IPDA Lidar mission data simulator and processor for MERLIN: prototype development at LMD/CNRS/Ecole Polytechnique\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOlivier, Chomette; Armante, Raymond; Crevoisier, Cyril; Delahaye, Thibault; Edouart, Dimitri; Gibert, Fabien; Nahan, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Tellier, Yoann\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe MEthane Remote sensing Lidar missioN (MERLIN), currently in phase C, is a joint cooperation between France and Germany on the development of a spatial Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) LIDAR (LIght Detecting And Ranging) to conduct global observations of atmospheric methane.

The thesis begins with an examination of what was understood by the term 'physics' in France circa. 1850. The development of the centralised state educational system and the physics research which was produced within this system in Paris and the provinces, is then considered. Although all the relevant institutions, where some form of physics or physical science was taught, have been examined, the Ecole Polytechnique, and the Ecole Normale Superieure have a particular importance in the early period of this study. As time passed and as a result of reforms put in hand by the republican regime which came out of the defeat of the Franco -Prussian war of 1870-71, the universite system grew in importance, while the role of the Polytechnique declined. The Ecole Normale, the Paris Faculty and the provincial faculties form part of the universite system and participated in its growth. A knowledge of the objectives of the physics courses in these institutions helps in the understanding of the characteristics of physics in France in this period. The central objective was, largely, to produce either science teachers, or (in the case of the Polytechnique), a type of elite 'technocrat', for the state, i.e. men who could communicate clearly, or technically utilise knowledge, which was already established on a firm theoretical basis. This is not to say that research had no place in the institutions of higher education, on the contrary, and this research, carried out by both teachers and students, is examined here to try to relate its form and content to the particular institution in which it was carried out. The role of national organisations like the Societe de physique and the Association Francaise pour l'avancement des sciences in the development of physics in France is also considered, as is the role of the Academie des sciences. The predominantly experimental nature of physics research in France is related to the\n\nThink first job! Preferences and expectations of engineering students in a French `Grande Ecole'\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGerwel Proches, Cecile N.; Chelin, Nathalie; Rouvrais, Siegfried\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA career in engineering may be appealing owing to the prospect of a good salary and a dynamic work environment. There may, however, be challenges for students wishing to enter their first job. In engineering education, career preparation courses may be included so as to prepare students adequately for their first job, future careers, and to reinforce career decision-making skills. This study explored the first-job preferences and expectations of engineering students at a generalist French 'Grande Ecole' before their compulsory internship. The study ultimately provided insight into ways in which future engineers may best be equipped for their first jobs. A qualitative research study was employed, using four focus groups to collect data, which was analysed thematically. Key findings indicate the resolute importance that engineering students place on having a challenging job, teamwork, independence, opportunities for development, and a participative style of being managed. The research findings may be of value in order to renew an engineering curriculum with better alignment between students' expectations and industry needs.\n\nEffets potentiels dâun modÃ¨le rationnel de prescription sur les dÃ©penses nationales en santÃ©\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLittman, Jordan; Halil, Roland\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRÃ©sumÃ© Objectif Estimer les Ã©conomies que pourrait engendrer la mise en Åuvre dâun modÃ¨le rationnel de prescription pour des classes de mÃ©dicaments Ã©quivalents sur les plans de lâefficacitÃ©, de la toxicitÃ© et de la commoditÃ©.

D. thesis of Louis Bachelier for the French stock market before Einstein [1]. In Ref. [2] we studied the so-called Heston model, where the stock-price dynamics is governed by multiplicative Brownian motion with stochastic diffusion coefficient. We solved the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation exactly and found an analytic formula for the time-dependent probability distribution of stock price changes (returns). The formula interpolates between the exponential (tent-shaped) distribution for short time lags and the Gaussian (parabolic) distribution for long time lags. The theoretical formula agrees very well with the actual stock-market data ranging from the Dow-Jones index [2] to individual companies [3], such as Microsoft, Intel, etc. [] [1] Louis Bachelier, ``Th'eorie de la sp'eculation,'' Annales Scientifiques de l''Ecole Normale Sup'erieure, III-17:21-86 (1900).[] [2] A.

One of the roles of school is to enable children to understand sciences, these same sciences that were long ago the prerogative of scientific laboratories. The educational network SISMOS Ã l\\\\'\"Ecole is an example of a project structured on the knowledge of seismic risks through a scientific and technological approach. It develops a teaching method leading to an approach towards the knowledge of natural disasters. The original and innovating feature of this educational network is to enable students to set up a seismograph in their school. The recorded signals - coming from a regional or a worldwide seismic activity - feed an on- line database, which is in fact a real research centre for seismic resources as well as a starting point for educational and scientific activities. The network, that numbers about thirty stations set up in France, in its overseas departments and territories, and in a couple of French schools abroad, is based upon an experience initiated in the French Riviera ten years ago or so. The achievement of the program has from then on gone beyond the simple purpose of conveying seismic data that research and monitoring centres could have recorded. Thanks to the use of scientific measures, students become involved and get into complex notions revolving around geophysics and geosciences. Developing simple tools, setting up concrete experiments combined with an investigate reasoning makes it easier to build up a quality scientific culture as well as an education of citizens to risks.\n\nAmphibians of the Reserva EcolÃ³gica Michelin: a high diversity site in the lowland Atlantic Forest of southern Bahia, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Mira-Mendes, Caio VinÃ­cius; Ruas, Danilo Silva; de Oliveira, Renan Manoel; Castro, Indira Maria; Dias, Iuri Ribeiro; Baumgarten, Julio Ernesto; JuncÃ¡, Flora AcuÃ±a; SolÃ©, Mirco\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAn inventory of the amphibians of the Reserva EcolÃ³gica Michelin - REM in southern Bahia, Brazil is presented.

Within this context, the CRIAQ MDO 505 project started, where a multidisciplinary approach was used to improve aircraft fuel efficiency. This international project took place between several Canadian and Italian teams. Industrial teams are Bombardier Aerospace, Thales Canada and Alenia Aermacchi. The academic partners are from Ecole de Technologie Superieure, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal and Naples University. Teams from 'CIRA' and IAR-NRC research institutes had, also, contributed on this project. The main objective of this project is to improve the aerodynamic performance of a morphing wing prototype by reducing the drag. This drag reduction is achieved by delaying the flow transition (from laminar to turbulent) by performing shape optimization of the flexible upper skin according to different flight conditions. Four linear axes, each one actuated by a 'BLDC' motor, are used to morph the skin. The skin displacements are calculated by 'CFD' numerical simulation based on flow parameters which are Mach number, the angle of attack and aileron's angle of deflection. The wing is also equipped with 32 pressure sensors to experimentally detect the transition during aerodynamic testing in the subsonic wind tunnel at the IAR-NRC in Ottawa. The first part of the work is dedicated to establishing the necessary fieldbus communications between the control system and the wing. The 'CANopen' protocol is implemented to ensure real time communication between the 'BLDC' drives and the real-time controller. The MODBUS TCP protocol is used to control the aileron drive. The second part consists of implementing the skin control position loop based on the LVDTs feedback, as well as developing an automated calibration procedure for skin displacement values. Two 'sets' of wind tunnel tests were carried out to, experimentally, investigate the morphing wing controller effect; these tests also offered the\n\nProfil de la nÃ©phropathie diabÃ©tique Ã lâHÃ´pital GÃ©nÃ©ral de RÃ©fÃ©rence Nationale de N'Djamena (Tchad)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHamat, Ibrahim; Abderraman, Guillaume Mahamat; Cisse, Mouhamadou Moustapha; Youssouf, Mahamat; Djafar, Matar Saboune; Mbainguinam, Dionadji; Fotclossou, Tara\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIntroduction Le diabÃ¨te sucrÃ© constitue un vÃ©ritable problÃ¨me de santÃ© et ses complications touchent plusieurs organes dont les reins. Un diagnostic prÃ©coce de la nÃ©phropathie diabÃ©tique permet de prendre en charge les patients plus efficacement et de faÃ§on multidisciplinaire, de retarder sa progression vers l'insuffisance rÃ©nale chronique. Peu d'Ã©tudes ont Ã©tÃ© faites en Afrique dans ce domaine. Au Tchad, nous ne disposons pas de donnÃ©es statistiques sur l'atteinte rÃ©nale liÃ©e au diabÃ¨te. C'est pourquoi nous nous proposons d'Ã©tudier la nÃ©phropathie diabÃ©tique avec pour objectifs d'analyser le profil de la nÃ©phropathie diabÃ©tique des patients de l'hÃ´pital gÃ©nÃ©ral de rÃ©fÃ©rence nationale de N'Djamena. MÃ©thodes Nous avions menÃ© une Ã©tude transversale descriptive Ã l'HÃ´pital GÃ©nÃ©rale de RÃ©fÃ©rence Nationale de N'Djamena d'avril Ã septembre 2012. Etaient inclus dans l'Ã©tude tous les patients diabÃ©tiques hospitalisÃ©s ou suivis dans les services de nÃ©phrologie et d'endocrinologie. RÃ©sultats Il y avait 54 cas de nÃ©phropathie diabÃ©tique sur 181 patients soit 29,80%. L'Ã¢ge de plus de 50 ans reprÃ©sentait 87%, le sexe masculin dominait avec 67%, la durÃ©e d'Ã©volution du diabÃ¨te au moment de la dÃ©couverte de la nÃ©phropathie Ã©tait de 10,25 ans, la pression artÃ©rielle moyenne Ã©tait de 138 mm Hg, l'HbA1C Ã©tait supÃ©rieur Ã 6,5% dans 74,5%, l'insuffisance rÃ©nale terminale Ã©tait retrouvÃ©e dans 26,90%, une protÃ©inurie Ã 2,65 g/24 h Ã©tait dÃ©tectÃ©e dans 60,30%. 57,4% des patients avaient une rÃ©tinopathie diabÃ©tique au stade III. Conclusion Au Tchad, la frÃ©quence de la nÃ©phropathie diabÃ©tique est de l'ordre de 29,83%. C'est une affection qui touche les hommes avec une moyenne d'Ã¢ge de 58,7 ans. Le diabÃ¨te de type 2 est le plus frÃ©quent avec 90,7% des cas.

Although it was first planned to use a lift truck for the image survey, budget considerations and taste for experimentation led the project to other perspectives: images shot from the ground level with a long focal camera will be combined to complementary images shot from what higher galleries are available on the main facade with a wide angle camera fixed on a horizontal 2.5 meter long pole. This heteroclite image survey is being processed by the PPMD master's degree students during this academic year. Among other type of products, 3D point clouds will be calculated on specific parts of the facade with both sources of images. If the proposed device and methodology to get full image coverage of the main facade happen to be fruitful, the image acquisition phase will be completed later by another team. This article focuses on the production of 3D point clouds with wide angle images on the rose of the main facade.\n\nTrends in food intake in French children from 1999 to 2007: results from the INCA (Ã©tude Individuelle Nationale des Consommations Alimentaires) dietary surveys.\n\nPubMed\n\nLioret, Sandrine; Dubuisson, Carine; Dufour, Ariane; Touvier, Mathilde; Calamassi-Tran, Gloria; Maire, Bernard; Volatier, Jean-Luc; Lafay, Lionel\n\n2010-02-01\n\nThe objectives of the present study were to assess the intake of different food groups in French children aged 3-17 years (n 1455), and to analyse trends since a dietary survey undertaken 8 years ago. Dietary intake was evaluated using data from the 2006-7 cross-sectional INCA2 national dietary survey (Ã©tude Individuelle Nationale sur les Consommations Alimentaires), based on a 7 d food record. Dietary intake (percentage of subjects consuming the food group and amount eaten) was assessed for thirty-nine food categories. We observed variations in food consumption by age, sex, North-South regional gradient, seasonal period and educational level of the responding parent. Trends in dietary intake between 1999 and 2007 were determined by comparing the INCA1 (n 1126) and the INCA2 surveys. Both surveys had been carried out using the same methodology. The findings showed a decrease in energy intake in children aged 3-14 years, due to a reduction in the consumption of foods of animal origin and sweetened products. In adolescents aged 15-17 years, energy intake remained rather stable; during this 8-year period, the consumption of meat decreased, whereas the consumption of savoury snacks such as sandwiches and hamburgers significantly increased. These trends occurred during a time of growing concern about overweight and the associated co-morbidities in France. A number of public health measures were implemented over this period to improve dietary habits and physical activity patterns in children and adults. The periodic monitoring of dietary patterns through the INCA surveys is an essential part of the surveillance network in France.\n\nA French-speaking speech-language pathology program in West Africa: transfer of training between Minority and Majority World countries.\n\nPubMed\n\nTopouzkhanian, Sylvia; Mijiyawa, Moustafa\n\n2013-02-01\n\nIn West Africa, as in Majority World countries, people with a communication disability are generally cut-off from the normal development process. A long-term involvement of two partners (Orthophonistes du Monde and Handicap International) allowed the implementation in 2003 of the first speech-language pathology qualifying course in West Africa, within the Ecole Nationale des Auxiliaires Medicaux (ENAM, National School for Medical Auxiliaries) in Lome, Togo. It is a 3-year basic training (after the baccalaureate) in the only academic training centre for medical assistants in Togo. This department has a regional purpose and aims at training French-speaking African students. French speech-language pathology lecturers had to adapt their courses to the local realities they discovered in Togo. It was important to introduce and develop knowledge and skills in the students' system of reference. African speech-language pathologists have to face many challenges: creating an African speech and language therapy, introducing language disorders and their possible cure by means other than traditional therapies, and adapting all the evaluation tests and tools for speech-language pathology to each country, each culture, and each language. Creating an African speech-language pathology profession (according to its own standards) with a real influence in West Africa opens great opportunities for schooling and social and occupational integration of people with communication disabilities.\n\nThe orchid-bee faunas (Hymenoptera: Apidae) of \"Reserva EcolÃ³gica Michelin\", \"RPPN Serra Bonita\" and one Atlantic Forest remnant in the state of Bahia, Brazil, with new geographic records.\n\nPubMed\n\nNemÃ©sio, A\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThe orchid bee faunas of two private natural preserves, 'Reserva Particular do PatrimÃ´nio Natural da Serra Bonita' (RSB) and 'Reserva EcolÃ³gica Michelin' (REM), and a forest fragment inside the campus of the 'Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz', were surveyed for the first time. All three areas constitute Atlantic Forest remnants in the southern portion of the state of Bahia, Brazil. A total of 1,782 males belonging to 32 species were actively collected with insect nets during 90 hours of field work from November, 2009, to January, 2012. Euglossa cyanochlora Moure, 1996-one of the rarest orchid bee species-was found at RSB and REM, the latter representing the northernmost record for this species.

Cet appareil permet non seulement de solliciter des eprouvettes de tailles importantes par rapport a celles utilisees lors des essais classiques, mais aussi d'effectuer des essais en conditions quasi-homogenes, ce qui permet de donner acces a la loi de comportement des materiaux. Les essais sont realises sur une large gamme de temperatures et de frequences (de -15 Â°C a 45Â°C et de 0,03Hz a 10 Hz). Cette etude a ete menee principalement pour comparer le comportement d'un bitume avec celui d'un mastic bitumineux dans le domaine des petites deformations. neanmoins, dans une seconde perspective, on s'interesse a l'influence des fillers de verre de post-consommation sur le comportement d'un mastic a faibles niveaux de deformations en comparant l'evolution des modules complexes de cisaillements (G*) d'un mastic avec fillers de verre et un mastic avec fillers conventionnels (calcaire). Enfin, le modele analogique 2S2P1D est utilise pour simuler le comportement viscoelastique lineaire des bitumes et des mastics bitumineux testes lors de la campagne experimentale.\n\n[Alfred Lacroix (Macon, 1863 - Paris, 1948), Chemist, Mineralogist, Volcanologist].\n\nPubMed\n\nChaigneau, M\n\n1998-01-01\n\nHis grandfather and his father were chemists in Macon. It was then natural for him to adopt such profession. After his studies at the Superior School of Chemistry of Paris (Ecole superieure de pharmacie de Paris), he passed as a first class chemist on december the seventh 1887. His passion for mineralogy, displayed since his youngest years, leads him to frequent scientists specialized in the earth's science, amongst who is Ferdinand Fouque, from the College of France (College de France), whom he used to accompany in his travels through the world between 1888 - the year when he parted from his pharmacy - and 1902. This very year, the eight of may, the terrifying eruption of the montagne Pelee on the isle of la Martinique annihilated in few minutes the town and the port of Saint-Pierre, leaving only two survivors, He sejourned there a second time, in august 1902 after the second eruption. A. Lacroix explained, for the first time, phenomena he designated as nuees ardentes. His knowledge in volcanology and mineralogy made him an expert who has been solicitated to observe various volcanos through out the world. Amongst his principal writings are the treaty of mineralogy (5 vol.), the 2 volumes of his conclusions about his observations of the montagne Pelee and one about the Piton de la Fournaise, to which must be added more than 650 notes and communications. Great officer of the Legion d'Honneur, the chemist Alfred Lacroix, professor at the Museum of natural history since the first of april 1893, carried on the function of perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences during 34 years.\n\nWater and beverage consumption among children aged 4-13 years in France: analyses of INCA 2 (Ãtude Individuelle Nationale des Consommations Alimentaires 2006-2007) data.\n\nPubMed\n\nVieux, Florent; Maillot, Matthieu; Constant, Florence; Drewnowski, Adam\n\n2016-09-01\n\nTo examine the consumption of plain water among children in France and compare total water intakes with guidelines issued by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Nationally representative data were used to assess food, beverage and water consumption by sex, age group (4-8 years, 9-13 years), income-to-poverty ratio, eating occasion and location. Beverages were classified into nine groups: water (tap or bottled), milk, 100 % fruit juice, sodas, fruit drinks, hot beverages, sports drinks and flavoured waters. Total water volume in relation to energy intake (litres/kcal) was also examined. INCA 2 study (Ãtude Individuelle Nationale des Consommations Alimentaires 2006-2007). French children (n 835) aged 4-13 years. Total water intakes were accounted for by plain water (34 %), beverages (26 %) and food moisture (40 %). Plain water could be tap (18 %) or bottled (16 %). Older children drank more plain water than did younger children and boys drank more plain water than did girls. No socio-economic gradient for plain water consumption was observed. About 90 % of children did not meet the EFSA water intake recommendations. The daily water shortfall ranged from 367 to 594 ml/d. Water-to-energy ratio was 0Â·75-0Â·77 litres/1000 kcal (4184 kJ). Children drank milk at breakfast and plain water during lunch and dinner. Caloric beverages provided 10 % of dietary energy; consumption patterns varied by eating location. Total water intakes among young children in France were below EFSA-recommended levels. Analyses of beverage consumption patterns by eating occasion and location can help identify ways to increase water consumption among children.\n\nSurfaces and Interfaces of Ceramic Materials.

This change gave rise to the shortage of pharmacists and surgeons in the army, and consquently in 1873 the branch of surgery and in 1876 pharmacology were inaugurated at the Haydarpasa Military Hospital. Those who had studied at this Hospital for three years were given a diploma for pharmacy practice (ameliyat eczaciligi sehadetnamesi) and were appointed to the army and to military hospitals. The years of education was raised to four years in 1888, and it was reduced to three years again in 1891. According to Charles Bonkowski, the chemist of Sultan Abdulhamid II, the instruction of military pharmacology was independent from the School of Medicine; he suggested the foundation of a higher school of pharmacy in Istanbul on the standards of the Paris Higher School of Pharmacology (Ecole Superieur de Pharmacie de Paris) where he had studied and graduated in 1865. Unfortunately this advice was not realised; but a department of pharmacology was opened within the Military High School for Veterinarians (Baytar Rustiye-i Askeriyesi) in Eyup in order to educate the students properly. This institution, renamed as the Military High School for Veterinarians and Pharmacists (Baytar ve Eczact Mekteb-i Rustiye-i Askeriyesi), had sent its graduates to the Imperial School of Medicine for many years. Since this process had proved to be useful, the Pharmacology Branch at the Haydarpasa Military Hospital was closed in 1892. In 1895, another military school which was called Eczaci ve Timarci Sibyan Mektebi started instruction on the Naval Hospital. Graduates of this school were appointed to the naval offices for minor operations.\n\nGravitational Wave Astrophysics in the Mid-band: progenitors and advanced localizations of Advanced LIGO/Virgo binary-merger events\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCheung, Chi C. Teddy; Hogan, Jason; Graham, Peter; Kasevich, Mark; Rajendran, Surjeet; Saif, Babak; Kerr, Matthew T.; Lovellette, Michael; Wood, Kent S.; Michelson, Peter; MAGIS Team\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe consider the scientific potential of gravitational wave (GW) observations in the ~30 mHz to 3 Hz frequency range with the Mid-band Atomic Gravitational-wave Interferometric Sensor (MAGIS). MAGIS is a probe-class space-mission concept, using an atom-based gravitational wave detector, that will provide all-sky strain sensitivities of ~10^-21 sqrt(Hz) and better (1-year) in the GW-frequency mid-band between the LISA/L3 detector (planned 2034 launch) and ground-based Advanced LIGO/Virgo interferometers. Primary gravitational wave astrophysics science in the mid-band include GW observations of the binary black hole population discovered by Advanced LIGO/Virgo at higher-frequencies, prior to their merger stage. For such systems, MAGIS will observe the binaries in their inspiral phase, where system parameters such as eccentricities are most easily constrained, and will provide advanced, degree-scale localizations that would enable electromagnetic observations of possible precursor emission 1-week to 1-month prior to their mergers as well as prompt post-merger transient emission. Joint GW-observations with MAGIS and Advanced LIGO/Virgo covering all stages of binary coalescence will further reduce uncertainties in the GW- localizations and distances, and will be powerful paired with galaxy catalogs, to enable unique galaxy counterpart identifications in the case black hole binary mergers are completely absent of detectable electromagnetic precursor or transient signals. These possibilities for MAGIS extend to neutron star binary systems (black hole - neutron star, neutron star - neutron star), and mid-band prospects for such systems will also be considered.The MAGIS team is a collaboration between institutes in the U.S. including Stanford, AOSense, Harvard, NASA/GSFC, NASA/JPL, NIST, NRL, and UC Berkeley, and international partners at Birmingham, Bordeaux, CNRS, Dusseldorf, Ecole Normale Superieure, Florence, Hannover, and Ulm University.\n\nPropagation-Loss Measurements and Modelling for Topographically Smooth and Rough Seabeds\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1989-06-01\n\n34 - UNLIMITED DISTRIBUTION I * National Defence Defense nationale Research and -urcau de recherche Development Branch et developpoment TECHNICAL...Desharnais DTI SEP 1419899 Defence - - Centre de Research 4 Recherches pour la Establishment Defense Atlantic Atlantique Canada8 89 9 14 018 r5Tn f\" S...Defence Defense nationale Research and Bureau de recherche Development Branch et developpement PROPAGATION-LOSS MEASUREMENTS AND MODELLING FOR\n\nYannick J.

The experimental results were compared with fully dimensional, time-dependent quantum mechanical calculations on the refined Boothroyd-Keogh-Martin-Peterson potential energy surface. We find nearly perfect agreement between theory and experiment for HD(v', j(')) product states with low to medium rotational excitation, e.g., HD(v' = 1, j(') = 3) at a collision energy, Ecoll, of 1.72 eV, HD(v' = 1, j(') = 3, 5) at Ecoll = 1.97 eV, and HD(v' = 3, j(') = 3) at Ecoll = 1.97 eV. As the rotational angular momentum, j('), of HD(v', j(')) increases, the agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements worsens but not in a simple fashion. A moderate disagreement between theory and experiment has been found for HD(v' = 0, j(') = 12) at Ecoll = 1.76 eV and increased monotonically for HD(v' = 0, j(') = 13) at Ecoll = 1.74 eV, HD(v' = 0, j(') = 14) at Ecoll = 1.72 eV, and HD(v' = 0, j(') = 15) at Ecoll = 1.70 eV. Disagreement was not limited to vibrationless HD(v', j(')) product states: HD(v' = 1, j(') = 12) at Ecoll = 1.60 eV and HD(v' = 3, j(') = 8, 10) at Ecoll = 1.97 eV followed a similar trend. Theoretical calculations suggest more sidewaysâforward scattering than has been observed experimentally for high j(') HD(v', j(')) states. The source of this discrepancy is presently unknown but might be the result of inaccuracy in the potential energy surface.\n\n2-D Acousto-Optic Signal Processors for Simultaneous Spectrum Analysis and Direction Finding\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1990-11-01\n\nNational Dfense Defence nationale 2-D ACOUSTO - OPTIC SIGNAL PROCESSORS FOR SIMULTANEOUS SPECTRUM ANALYSIS 00 AND DIRECTION FINDING (U) by NM Jim P.Y...Wr pdft .1w I0~1111191 3 05089 National DIfense Defence nationale 2-D ACOUSTO - OPTIC SIGNAL PROCESSORS FOR SIMULTANEOUS SPECTRUM ANALYSIS AND DIRECTION...Processing, J.T.

Such satellites are therefore not only useful for weather fore- casting, but also for the estimation of solar irradiance since the knowledge of the light reflected by clouds is the basis for the calculation of the transmitted light. Additionally an the knowledge of atmospheric parameters involved in scattering and absorption of the sunlight is necessary for an accurate calculation of the solar irradiance. An accurate estimation of the downward solar irradiance is not only of particular im- portance for the assessment of the radiative forcing of the climate system, but also necessary for an efficient planning and operation of solar energy systems. Currently, most of the operational calculation schemes for solar irradiance are semi- empirical. They use cloud information from the current Meteosat satellite and clima- tologies of atmospheric parameters e.g. turbidity (aerosols and water vapor). The Me- teosat Second Generation satellites (MSG, to be launched in 2002) will provide not only a higher spatial and temporal resolution, but also the potential for the retrieval of atmospheric parameters such as ozone, water vapor and with restrictions aerosols. With this more detailed knowledge about atmospheric parameters it is evident to set up a new calculation scheme based on radiative transfer models using the retrieved atmospheric parameters as input. Unfortunately the possibility of deriving aerosol in- formation from MSG data is limited. As a cosequence the use of data from additional satellite instruments ( e.g. GOME/ATSR-2) is neeeded.

The initial (J, K = 0) and (J, K = J) [J = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8] rotational state specific cross sections are obtained at different collision energies (Ecoll) in the 1-20 kcal mol(-1) range, and the scattering angle and initial attack angle distributions as well as the mechanism-specific opacity functions are reported at Ecoll = 10 kcal mol(-1). The tumbling rotation (K = 0) inhibits the F(-) + CH3F reaction by a factor of 3 for J = 8 at Ecoll = 10 kcal mol(-1). This tumbling rotational effect becomes smaller at low and high Ecoll, and the tumbling motion affects the cross sections of F(-) + CH3Cl by only a few percent. The spinning rotation (K = J) hinders both reactions by factors in the 1.3-1.7 range for J = 8 at low Ecoll, whereas slight promotion is found as the Ecoll increases. The tumbling rotation may counteract the attractive ion-dipole forces, and the spinning motion hinders the complex formation, thereby decreasing the reactivity.\n\nPrognostic relevance of FÃ©dÃ©ration Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer grade and MDM2 amplification levels in dedifferentiated liposarcoma: a study of 50 cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nJour, George; Gullet, Ashley; Liu, Mingdong; Hoch, Benjamin L\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDedifferentiated liposarcoma represents a form of liposarcoma composed of a non-lipogenic sarcoma associated with well-differentiated liposarcoma. The prognostic significance of histological grading of the dedifferentiated component remains to be elucidated due to vague grading criteria employed in previous studies. Molecular markers of tumor behavior, including amplification levels of murine double minute-2 (MDM2) and cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (CDK4) genes, have been explored in a limited number of cases. Here we investigate whether 'FÃ©dÃ©ration Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer' (FNCLCC) grade and MDM2 gene amplification levels have prognostic value in dedifferentiated liposarcoma in terms of local recurrence and disease-specific survival. Fifty cases were retrieved, reviewed and FNCLCC grade was scored for the dedifferentiated component. Testing for MDM2 gene amplification was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Amplification was categorized as high level (â¥20 copies) and as low level (<20 copies). Follow-up data was obtained through chart review. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the effect of grade and level of MDM2 amplification on outcomes. Our series includes 50 patients (male n=28, female n=22) with an average age of 63 years (range, 28-88) and a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 2-120). Tumors were graded as grade 1 (6%), grade 2 (58%), and grade 3 (36%). When adjusted for age, sex, site, tumor size, and margin status, grade 3 patients had a higher recurrence rate than grades 1 and 2 (HR=2.07, 95% CI: 1.24, 7.62; P=0.015). Patients with high-level MDM2 amplification had higher recurrence rate on univariate analysis (P=0.028), but not on multivariate analysis (HR=1.69, 95% CI: 0.73, 3.94; P=0.221). FNCLCC grade 3 dedifferentiation confers a worse prognosis in dedifferentiated liposarcoma in terms of local recurrence. MDM2 amplification level remains a useful diagnostic tool in\n\nConception de lois de pilotage robustes et sequencement de gains par l'approche de systemes lineaires a parametres variants\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHentabli, Kamel\n\nCette recherche s'inscrit dans le cadre du projet de recherche Active Control Technology entre l'Ecole de Technologie Superieure et le constructeur Bombardier Aeronautique . Le but est de concevoir des strategies de commandes multivariables et robustes pour des modeles dynamiques d'avions. Ces strategies de commandes devraient assurer a l'avion une haute performance et satisfaire des qualites de vol desirees en l'occurrence, une bonne manoeuvrabilite, de bonnes marges de stabilite et un amortissement des mouvements phugoides et rapides de l'avion. Dans un premier temps, nous nous sommes principalement interesses aux methodes de synthese LTI et plus exactement a l'approche Hinfinity et la mu-synthese. Par la suite, nous avons accorde un interet particulier aux techniques de commande LPV. Pour mener a bien ce travail, nous avons envisage une approche frequentielle, typiquement Hinfinity. Cette approche est particulierement interessante, dans la mesure ou le modele de synthese est construit directement a partir des differentes specifications du cahier des charges. En effet, ces specifications sont traduites sous forme de gabarits frequentiels, correspondant a des ponderations en entree et en sortie que l'on retrouve dans la synthese Hinfinity classique. Par ailleurs, nous avons utilise une representation de type lineaire fractionnelle (LFT), jugee mieux adaptee pour la prise en compte des differents types d'incertitudes, qui peuvent intervenir sur le systeme. De plus, cette representation s'avere tres appropriee pour l'analyse de la robustesse via les outils de la mu-analyse. D'autre part, afin d'optimiser le compromis entre les specifications de robustesse et de performance, nous avons opte pour une structure de commande a 2 degres de liberte avec modele de reference. Enfin, ces techniques sont illustrees sur des applications realistes, demontrant ainsi la pertinence et l'applicabilite de chacune d'elle. Mots cles.

The nested cross-sectional study, untitled HEPAVIH-Psy survey, was performed in a subset of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients enrolled in the French Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDA et les HÃ©patites Virales (ANRS) CO13 HEPAVIH cohort. Psychiatric disorders were screened for using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 5.0.0). Among the 286 patients enrolled in the study, 68 (24%) had never received HCV treatment, 87 (30%) were treatment nonresponders, 44 (15%) were currently being treated and 87 (30%) had a sustained virological response (SVR). Of the 286 patients enrolled, 121 patients (42%) screened positive for a psychiatric disorder other than suicidality and alcohol/drug abuse/dependence, 40 (14%) screened positive for alcohol abuse/dependence, 50 (18%) screened positive for drug abuse/dependence, 50 (17.5%) were receiving an antidepressant treatment and 69 (24%) were receiving an anxiolytic. Patients with an SVR did not significantly differ from the other groups in terms of psychiatric disorders. Patients receiving HCV treatment screened positive less often for an anxiety disorder. The highest rate of drug dependence/abuse was among HCV treatment-naÃ¯ve patients. Psychiatric disorders were frequent in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients and their rates were comparable between groups, even for patients achieving an SVR. Our results emphasize the need for continuous assessment and care of coinfected patients, even after HCV clearance. Drug addiction remains an obstacle to access to HCV treatment. Despite the recent advent and continued development of directly acting antiviral agents (DAAs), it is still crucial to offer screening and comprehensive care for psychiatric and addictive disorders.

In this work, new variants of porous silicon (PSi) substrates have been introduced. Through an experimental RF performance, the proposed PSi substrates have been compared with different silicon-based substrates, namely, standard silicon (Std), trap-rich (TR) and high resistivity (HR). All of the mentioned substrates have been fabricated where identical samples of CPW lines have been integrated on. The new PSi substrates have shown successful reduction in the substrate's effective relative permittivity to values as low as 3.7 and great increase in the substrate's effective resistivity to values higher than 7 kÎ© cm. As a concept proof, a mm-wave bandpass filter (MBPF) centred at 27 GHz has been integrated on the investigated substrates. Compared with the conventional MBPF implemented on standard silicon-based substrates, the measured S-parameters of the PSi-based MBPF have shown high filtering performance, such as a reduction in insertion loss and an enhancement of the filter selectivity, with the joy of having the same filter performance by varying the temperature. Therefore, the efficiency of the proposed PSi substrates has been well highlighted. From 1994 to 1995, she was assistant of physics at (USTHB), Algiers .

In addition to traditional determinants, a specific deleterious effect of HIV and immunodeficiency is speculated. We aimed at studying the association between immunological and virological characteristics of HIV-infected patients in care and the risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining and non-AIDS-defining malignancies. Patients consecutively enrolled in the hospital-based Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le Sida (ANRS) CO3 Aquitaine Cohort were included if the duration of follow-up was >3 months during the period 1998-2006. Multivariate modeling used an extended Cox proportional hazards model for time-dependent covariates and delayed entry. The 4194 patients included in the study developed 251 first malignancies during 22,389 person-years. A higher incidence of AIDS-defining malignancies (107 cases) was independently associated with (1) both longer and current exposures to a plasma HIV RNA level >500 copies/mL (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27 per year [P<.001] and 3.30 [P<.001], respectively) and (2) both longer and current exposure to a CD4(+) cell count <200 cells/mm(3) (HR, 1.36 per year [P<.001] and 6.33 [P<.001], respectively). A higher incidence of non-AIDS-defining malignancies (144 cases) was independently associated with longer and current exposure to a CD4(+) cell count <500 cells/mm(3) (HR, 1.13 per year [P=.01] and 2.07 [P<.001], respectively) and male sex (HR, 1.69; P=.02) but not with plasma HIV RNA level (P=.49 and P=.10 for cumulative and current exposures, respectively). Uncontrolled plasma HIV RNA level was independently associated with a higher likelihood of developing AIDS-defining malignancies, whereas immunosuppression was associated with a higher risk of developing any type of malignancies. Antiretroviral treatment should aim at reaching and maintaining a CD4(+) count >500 cells/mm(3) to prevent the occurrence of malignancy, this should be\n\nConsumption of artificially and sugar-sweetened beverages and incident type 2 diabetes in the Etude Epidemiologique aupres des femmes de la Mutuelle Generale de l'Education Nationale-European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort.\n\nPubMed\n\nFagherazzi, Guy; Vilier, Alice; Saes Sartorelli, Daniela; Lajous, Martin; Balkau, Beverley; Clavel-Chapelon, FranÃ§oise\n\n2013-03-01\n\nIt has been extensively shown, mainly in US populations, that sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but less is known about the effects of artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs). We evaluated the association between self-reported SSB, ASB, and 100% fruit juice consumption and T2D risk over 14 y of follow-up in the French prospective Etude EpidÃ©miologique auprÃ¨s des femmes de la Mutuelle GÃ©nÃ©rale de l'Education Nationale-European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. A total of 66,118 women were followed from 1993, and 1369 incident cases of T2D were diagnosed during the follow-up. Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for T2D risk. The average consumption of sweetened beverages in consumers was 328 and 568 mL/wk for SSBs and ASBs, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, women in the highest quartiles of SSB and ASB consumers were at increased risk of T2D with HRs (95% CIs) of 1.34 (1.05, 1.71) and 2.21 (1.56, 3.14) for women who consumed >359 and >603 mL/wk of SSBs and ASBs, respectively. Strong positive trends in T2D risk were also observed across quartiles of consumption for both types of beverage (P = 0.0088 and P < 0.0001, respectively). In sensitivity analyses, associations were partly mediated by BMI, although there was still a strong significant independent effect. No association was observed for 100% fruit juice consumption. Both SSB consumption and ASB consumption were associated with increased T2D risk. We cannot rule out that factors other than ASB consumption that we did not control for are responsible for the association with diabetes, and randomized trials are required to prove a causal link between ASB consumption and T2D.\n\nPrivacy Laws and Biobanking in Germany.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoppe, Nils\n\n2016-03-01\n\nWhile the possibility of enacting a sui generis Biobank Act has been debated in Germany at great length, as of yet the country has not implemented any biobankspecific legislation. Instead, oversight is available via a network of research and privacy laws, including those of the European Union. The Nationale Kohorte, Germany's large-scale, population-based epidemiological research biobank, is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and there are currently 108 registered bio-banks throughout Germany. The current system, including the structure and study design of the Nationale Kohorte, privileges the protection of personal information even at the cost of socially desirable research; it remains to be seen if forthcoming legislation will shift this balance.

Following SWE features were reviewed: visual pattern classification (pattern 1-4), color homogeneity (Ehomo) and six-point color score of maximum elasticity (Ecol). Combined with B-mode US and SWE, the likelihood of malignancy (LOM) was also scored. The area under the curve (AUC) was obtained by ROC curve analysis to assess the diagnostic performance under each color opacity. A visual color pattern, Ehomo, Ecol and LOM scoring were significantly different between benign and malignant lesions under all color opacities (P<0.001). For 50% opacity, AUCs of visual color pattern, Ecol, Ehomo and LOM scoring were 0.902, 0.951, 0.835 and 0.975. But, for each SWE feature, there was no significant difference in the AUC among three different color opacities. For all color opacities, visual color pattern and Ecol showed significantly higher AUC than Ehomo. In addition, a combined set of B-mode US and SWE showed significantly higher AUC than SWE alone for color patterns, Ehomo, but no significant difference was found in Ecol. Qualitative SWE was useful to differentiate benign from malignant breast lesion under all color opacities. The difference in color map opacity did not significantly influence diagnostic performance of SWE. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This innovation research mandate was developed at ArcelorMittal Exploitation Miniere (AMEM) pellet plant in Port-Cartier (Quebec, Canada). With this undertaking, ArcelorMittal is striving to maintain its world class level of excellence and continues to pursue initiatives that can augment its competitive advantage worldwide. The plant's gravimetric classification process was retained as a prototype and development laboratory due to its effect on the company's competitiveness and its impact on subsequent steps leading to final production of iron oxide pellets. Concretely, the development of this expertise in process control and in situ monitoring will establish a firm basic knowledge in the fields of complex system physical modeling, data reconciliation, statistical observers, multivariate command and quality control using real-time monitoring of the desirability function. The hydraulic classifier is mathematically modeled. Using planned disturbances on the production line, an identification procedure was established to provide empirical estimations of the model's structural parameters. A new sampling campaign and a previously unpublished data collection and consolidation policy were implemented plant-wide. Access to these invaluable data sources has enabled the establishment of new thresholds that govern the production process and its control. Finally, as a substitute for the traditional quality control process, we have implemented a new strategy based on the use of the desirability function. Our innovation is not in using this Finally, as a substitute for the traditional quality control process, we have implemented a new strategy based on the use of the desirability function.

The school has been opened to the community and the community to the school. Teacher education now includes community studies, designed to prepare teachers for an active role in this process and for the better understanding of the social background of pupils. One new practice is the publication of local newspapers or news-sheets to enhance the understanding of the community by teachers and pupils. The development of a school garden for the cultivation of flowers and vegetables serves as another bridge between school and community. Other examples of community action are adult literacy classes, the creation of voluntary organisations for women, the running of youth clubs, the formation of co-operatives, and local projects like the purchase of an old tram-car to be converted into a library. The introduction of `Civic and Polytechnic Education' for 13-16 year olds was an important innovation. One half-day a week was to be devoted to the integration of the school with the locality, young people's participation in society as agents of change, the linking of study and productive work, and the involvement of young people in the solution of national problems, working from a concrete knowledge of local and regional life. However, since 1976 there has been a more conservative approach, and only in places with a strong consensus amongst teachers has the new relationship between school and community been maintained.\n\nIndicators of Ecological Change\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2005-03-03\n\n1943.

Cooperation is found in many species and, due to its low costs, likely is a determining factor in the evolution of living in social groups (Smith in Anim Behav 92:291-304, 2014). Beyond cooperation, many mammals perform costly behaviors for the benefit of group mates (e.g., parental care, food sharing, grooming). Altruism is considered the most extreme case of cooperation where the altruist increases the fitness of the recipient while decreasing its own fitness (Bell in Selection: the mechanism of evolution. Oxford University Press, Oxford 2008). Gray wolf life history requires intra-pack familiarity, communication, and cooperation in order to succeed in hunting (MacNulty et al. in Behav Ecol doi: 10.1093/beheco/arr159 2011) and protecting group resources (Stahler et al. in J Anim Ecol 82: 222-234, 2013; Cassidy et al. in Behav Ecol 26:1352-1360, 2015). Here, we report 121 territorial aggressive inter-pack interactions in Yellowstone National Park between 1 April 1995 and 1 April 2011 (>5300Â days of observation) and examine each interaction where one wolf interferes when its pack mate is being attacked by a rival group. This behavior was recorded six times (17.6Â % of interactions involving an attack) and often occurred between dyads of closely related individuals. We discuss this behavior as it relates to the evolution of cooperation, sociality, and altruism.\n\nPratique d'apprentissage en ligne aux etudes superieures (Online Learning for Higher Education).\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMarchand, Louise\n\n2001-01-01\n\nOnline learning requires new approaches to teaching and learning.

The methods detailed in this chapter can be utilized for any type of bone. However, for this example, four microsatellite loci were isolated from Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) using published primers for manatee and dugong microsatellites. The primers DduC05 (Broderick et al., Mol Ecol Notes 6:1275-1277, 2007), Tmakb60, TmaSC5 (Pause et al., Mol Ecol Notes 6: 1073-1076, 2007), and TmaE11 (Garcia-Rodriguez et al., Mol Ecol 12:2161-2163, 2000) all successfully amplified microsatellites from H. gigas. The DNA samples were from bone collected on Bering or St. Lawrence Islands. DNA was analyzed using primers with the fluorescent label FAM-6. Sequenced alleles were then used to indicate a difference in the number of repeats and thus a difference in individuals. This is the first time that H. gigas microsatellite loci have been isolated. These techniques for ancient bone microsatellite analysis allow an estimate of population size for a newly discovered St. Lawrence Island sea cow population.\n\nCumulative Viral Load and Virologic Decay Patterns after Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Subjects Influence CD4 Recovery and AIDS\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2011-05-20\n\nstudy).

It is also known that quantifying soil hydraulic parameters in a Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere (SVA) system is a highly non-linear parameter estimation problem, and that robust methods are needed to avoid the optimization process to lead to non-optimal parameters. Evolutionary algorithms and specifically genetic algorithms (GAs) are very well suited for those complex parameter optimization problems. The SVA system in this study concerns a pine stand on a heterogeneous sandy soil (podzol) in the north of Belgium (Campine region). Throughfall and other meteorological data and water contents at different soil depths have been recorded during one year at a daily time step. The water table level, which is varying between 95 and 170 cm, has been recorded with a frequency of 0.5 hours. Based on the profile description, four soil layers have been distinguished in the podzol and used for the numerical simulation with the hydrus1D model (Simunek and al., 2005). For the inversion procedure the MYGA program (Yedder, 2002), which is an elitism GA, was used. Optimization was based on the water content measurements realized at the depths of 10, 20, 40, 50, 60, 70, 90, 110, and 120 cm to estimate parameters describing the unsaturated hydraulic soil properties of the different soil layers. Comparison between the modeled and measured water contents shows a good similarity during the simulated year. Impacts of short and intensive events (rainfall) on the water content of the soil are also well reproduced. Errors on predictions are on average equal to 5%, which is considered as a good result. A.

MÃ©thodes Nous avons menÃ©e une Ã©tude Ã visÃ©e descriptive et analytique comportant un volet rÃ©-trospectif du 01 janvier 2006 au 31 dÃ©cembre 2010 portant sur les paramÃ¨tres Ã©pidÃ©miologiques, cliniques des nouveau-nÃ©s hospitalisÃ©s et un volet prospectif du 3 octobre 2011 au 29 fÃ©vrier 2012 par une entrevue des accompagnateurs des nouveau-nÃ©s et des prestataires des services de santÃ©. RÃ©sultats Les hospitalisations ont augmentÃ© de 43,65% entre 2006 Ã 2010 Le taux de mortalitÃ© nÃ©o-natale hospitaliÃ¨re qui Ã©tait de 11,04% a connu une rÃ©duction moyenne annuelle de 3,95%. L'entrevue a portÃ© sur 110 accompagnateurs et 76 prestataires. La majoritÃ© des prestataires (97,44%) et des ac-compagnateurs (88,18%) Ã©taient informÃ©s de la stratÃ©gie mais n'avait pas une connaissance exacte de sa dÃ©finition. Les prestataires (94,74%) ont signalÃ© des ruptures de mÃ©dicaments, consommables mÃ©dicaux et des pannes dâ appareils de laboratoire et d'imagerie. Parmi les accompagnateurs (89%) disaient Ãªtre satisfaits des services offerts et (72,89%) trouvaient les coÃ»ts abordables mais Ã©voquaient les difficultÃ©s du transport. Conclusion: La subvention a amÃ©liorÃ© la prise en charge du nou-veau-nÃ© mais son optimisation nÃ©cessiterait une meilleur information et implication de tous les acteurs.
