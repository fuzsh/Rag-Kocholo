        "text": "Martin Lee Chalfie is an American scientist. He is University Professor at Columbia University. He shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Osamu Shimomura and Roger Y. Tsien “for the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein, GFP”. He holds a Ph.D. in neurobiology from Harvard University.\n\nAfter graduating in 1969, he worked at a variety of temporary jobs, such as selling dresses for his parents’ dress manufacturing business in Chicago and teaching at Hamden Hall Country Day School in Hamden, Connecticut. In the summer of 1971, his research at the laboratory of Jose Zadunaisky at Yale University resulted in his first publication. With revived confidence. He returned to Harvard for graduate studies under Robert Perlman, and received his Ph.D. in 1977.\n\nHe conducted his postdoctoral research at the LMB with Sidney Brenner and John Sulston, and the three published a paper in 1985 on “The Neural Circuit for Touch Sensitivity in C. elegans. Chalfie then left the LMB in 1982 to join the faculty of Columbia University in the department of biological sciences and continued to study C. elegans touch mutants.\n\nChalfie’s lab uses the nematode C. elegans to investigate aspects of nerve cell development and function. The wealth of developmental, anatomical, genetic, and molecular information available for C. elegans provides a powerful and multifaceted approach to these studies.\n\nHe traces his work on Green fluorescent protein to a 1988 seminar from Paul Brehm about bioluminescent organisms, which led to some crucial experiments in 1992, detailed in his paper “Green fluorescent protein as a marker for gene expression”, which is among the 20 most-cited papers in the field of Molecular Biology & Genetics. Chalfie won a Golden Goose Award for this work in 2012.\n\nMartin Lee Chalfie delivered the B.M. Birla Memorial Lecture and gave away the B.M. Birla Science Prizes on January 27, 2018.\n\nTakaaki Kajita is a Japanese physicist, known for neutrino experiments at the Kamiokande and its successor, Super-Kamiokande. In 2015, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics jointly with Canadian physicist Arthur B. McDonald.\n\nKajita was born in 1959 in Higashimatsuyama, Saitama, Japan. He studied physics at the Saitama University and graduated in 1981.

After he passed away in 1996 due to protracted illness, the ICTP was renamed, most fittingly, the Abdus Salam International Center for Theoretical Physics.\n\nHe shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979, along with Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg for his pioneering work leading to the unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions.\n\nWilliam Fowler was born on August 09, 1911 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nOn graduation Fowler joined the world famous California Institute of Technology as a graduate student for work under the famous C.C. Lauritsen in the Kellogg Radiation Ìaboratory. Fowler received his PhD in Physics in 1936 for work which showed the symmetry of nuclear forces between protons and neutrons. Thereafter he became an Assistant Professor at Caltech.\n\nHoyle had a great influence on Fowler. Hoyle and the Burbidges went to Kellogg and thus in 1957 they came out with a paper, “Synthesis of the Elements in Stars”. This important work demonstrated that all the elements from carbon to uranium could be produced inside the stars, starting with the hydrogen and the helium produced in the big bang. William Fowler was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize for his researches, along with S. Chandrasekhar.\n\nProf. William Fowler delivered the B.M. Birla Memorial Lecture “THE EARLY UNIVERSE” on March 15, 1990.\n\nFred Hoyle was born on June 24, 1915 in Bingley, Yorkshire.\n\nFred Hoyle held many prestigious positions and also received several honours.
