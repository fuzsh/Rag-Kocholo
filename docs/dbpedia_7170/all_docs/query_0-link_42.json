        "text": "The acoustic problem\n\nAmong the various current opinions on ASA, there seems to be at least one that reaches a consensus among investigators: realistic auditory scenes can be rather complicated. At the core, sound is a one-dimensional physical phenomenon. An acoustic pressure wave impinges on one of our eardrums and it can only do one of two things: it can push the tympanic membrane a little bit, or it can pull it a little bit. Moreover, there is no occlusion between acoustic waves originating from different sources: as waves propagate through the air, they sum linearly at each point. As a consequence, at any moment in time, the little push or pull on the eardrum may be caused by one sound source out in the world, but it may also be caused by two sound sources, or by many sound sources, the number of which is unknown (Figure ). This is what is known as an ill-posed problem in mathematics. There are too many unknowns (in fact, an unknown number of unknowns) for too few observations. The problem cannot be solved without further assumptions.\n\nEach author has, at one point or another, tried to convey the intricacy of auditory scenes by a metaphor. Helmholtz (1877) evokes the interior of a nineteenth century ball-room, complete with “a number of musical instruments in action, speaking men and women, rustling garments, gliding feet, clinking glasses, and so on.” He goes on to describe the resulting soundfield as a “tumbled entanglement of the most different kinds of motion, complicated beyond conception.” His choice of metaphor may not have been totally neutral. The complexity of natural acoustic scenes is clearly large in general, but that of musical acoustic scenes can be positively daunting. Consider for instance the picture of Figure A, a photograph taken before the première of Gustav Mahler’s eighth symphony. This work has also been dubbed the “Symphony of a Thousand,” an obvious reference to the size of the orchestra and choir. An illustration of the resulting acoustic waveform (Sound Example S1 in Supplementary Material) is presented in Figure B. It seems impossible to infer, from there, how many sources where present and what they were doing.\n\nBut is the auditory system really expected to make sense of each and every one of the acoustic sources? This is not the case, fortunately. Mahler has a thousand potential acoustic sources at the tip of his finger when writing his score, but he will in fact use various devices to create only a tractable number of concurrent auditory objects (this tractable number may be rather low for the listener, Brochard et al., 1999). He does that by means of what could rightly be termed auditory illusions (we know there are many sources, we hear only one melody). This is a first hint of the intricate connections between ASA, illusions, and music, to which we will come back later.\n\nCues to ASA\n\nA vast amount of psychophysical data has been accumulated on the topic of ASA (sometimes also referred to as the cocktail party problem, Cherry, 1953). A classic book also exists, which gave its modern name to the field (Bregman, 1990). More recent reviews are available (Carlyon, 2004; Snyder and Alain, 2007; Shamma and Micheyl, 2010). Here we will not go into any details, but rather sketch two possible accounts of ASA while emphasizing the role of inference processes in both of them.\n\nBregman (1990) suggested that ASA may be broken into two sub-problem. The first one is local in time and is termed vertical organization. Vertical refers to the frequency axis of Figure C: at any given moment in time, ASA needs to parse the distribution of energy over frequency channels into its plausible distal cause(s). The issue is twofold: acoustic sources are in general complex, so they produce activation over several auditory channels. It is thus important to be able to recognize these channels as belonging to one source. Also, pressure waves originating from different acoustic sources add up with each other, so it may be useful to be able to parcel out the contribution of each source to any given patch of activity in the time–frequency plane.\n\nThe general principle of ASA for Bregman seems to be one of perceptual inference based a heuristic ensemble of cues, each expressing a little knowledge about the way the acoustic world usually behaves. For instance, a cue to vertical organization is harmonicity. Harmonicity refers to the fact that any periodic sound can be represented by a stack of pure tones, and that these tones will exhibit a harmonic relationship: their frequencies will all be integer multiples of a fundamental frequency, f0, corresponding to the inverse of the repetition period. Harmonicity is a strong cue: it would be particularly unfortunate that several independent distal sources satisfied the harmonic relation just by chance. On the contrary, a harmonic relation is the obligatory correlate of any periodic sound. Accordingly, when we hear harmonic series, perceptual awareness is overwhelmingly that of a single source and not of a disparate collection of pure tones. However, there are many instances of natural sources which do not produce fully periodic sounds and hence exact harmonic series (piano strings for instance). So, the harmonicity cue must include some tolerance (Moore et al., 1986). There are many other cues to vertical organization, each having a strong or weak effect on the perceptual outcome: location (Darwin, 2008), onset synchrony (Hukin and Darwin, 1995), spectral regularity (Roberts and Bailey, 1996), to cite a few. Importantly, just as is the case for harmonicity, none of the cue is infaillible and all are potentially corrupted by noise.\n\nThe other sub-problem of ASA is termed, predictably, horizontal organization. It refers to the horizontal time axis of Figure C. Acoustic sources tend to extend over time, and sound sources do not necessarily produce energy in a continuous fashion. It seems nevertheless advantageous to consider a series of footsteps as a single source, and not to reset the perceptual organization of the scene for each step. For horizontal organization, a putative distal source is also called a “stream.” Musical melodies are a prime example of streams.\n\nThe cues to horizontal organization, again, seem to follow the plausibility principle. Because of the physics of sound production, an acoustic source will tend to be slowly varying over time. It is unlikely that two consecutive sounds produced by the same source, such as a single talker, will display in rapid succession wide differences in pitch, timbre, or location. Streams will thus favor the grouping together of sounds that are perceptually similar, and segregate sounds which are perceptually dissimilar. Any similarity cue seems to be able to subserve streaming (Moore and Gockel, 2002). Just like for vertical organization, the precise degree of dissimilarity that can be tolerated within a single stream seem to be highly variable, but more on that in Section “Visual Bistability.”\n\nRecently, what seems to be a radically different account of ASA has been proposed (Elhilali et al., 2009; Shamma et al., 2011). It suggests that there is one simple and general principle that could govern the formation of auditory streams. The general idea is that sound is analyzed through a multitude of parallel neural channels, each expressing various attributes of sound (periodicity, spatial location, temporal and spectral modulations, etc.). The problem of ASA is then to bind a sub-set of those channels together, with the aim that all channels dominated by a given acoustic source will be bound together and, if possible, not bound with channels dominated by other sources. The suggested principle is temporal coherence between channels (as measured by correlation over relatively long time windows). Coherent channels are grouped as a single stream, whereas low coherence indicates more than one stream.\n\nIn spite of many differences between these two frameworks, we would argue that there is a core connection between them, when one considers the need for perceptual inference for ASA. This is explicit in Bregman’s case, as organization cues are based on the usual behavior of sound sources (even though the neural implementation of each heuristic is not always specified). In contrast, the coherence model does not seem to be easily construed as an inference model: it does not explicitly store knowledge about the external world, not does it include a “decision” stage. However, coherence is a direct and simple way to embody neurally a plausibility principle. Indeed, a single source will tend to induce coherent changes in all channels, irrespective of the nature of the channel. Moreover, these changes will be incoherent with those of other sources. Thus, more often than not, binding coherent channels will lead to isolating single acoustic sources. Note that coherence will never be a perfect trick, either: as soon as there is noise or more than one source in a given channel, choices need to be made among the likely candidates for binding.\n\nThis brief account of current issues in ASA is obviously over-simplified. In particular, we have not mentioned the crucial importance of learning and familiarity on the ability to extract information from a scene (e.g., Bregman, 1990; Bey and McAdams, 2002; Agus et al., 2010; McDermott et al., 2011), the role of attention (Thompson et al., 2011), or the strong multi-modal influences on the formation of perceptual objects (e.g., Suied et al., 2009). There are also many open issues that remain to be solved. However, we would argue that the general picture that emerges is that ASA truly behaves as if it were an inference process relying on a variety of sensory cues. These cues are evaluated from the proximal acoustic wave and concomitant neural activity, but they are also weighted with respect to their physical plausibility by means of a form of embodied knowledge (not necessarily explicit and not necessarily operating in a top-down manner) of some of the laws of the acoustics of sound sources.\n\nVisual bistability\n\nThis is where perceptual illusions based on ambiguity enter the picture. The examples of Figure illustrate what is termed bistable perception in vision: an unchanging stimulus presented for a certain amount of time evokes spontaneous perceptual alternations in the mind of the observer. As the physical description of the stimulus does not match its subjective experience, bistable perception can rightly be termed an illusion. A variety of bistable illusions have been described by visual scientists. Reversible figures such as Figure are bistable (Long and Toppino, 2004). Binocular rivalry, where incompatible images are presented to the each of the two eyes, also produce alternations between images (Helmholtz, 1866/1925; Alais and Blake, 2005). Finally, there are bistable motion stimuli such as moving plaids (Hupé and Rubin, 2003)2.\n\nThese illusions are seemingly very diverse, but they all have two important things in common. First, they present the visual system with a profoundly ambiguous situation. The information that reaches the retina for Figure may well have been caused by two faces looking at each other, or, alternately by a vase. Second, it seems that confronted with such an insoluble dilemma, the perceptual system’s response is to explore in turn the different possible interpretations (and not to consider an “average” interpretation, as two faces and a vase which contours match exactly is a highly unlikely situation). This is not an obvious outcome: it may well have been possible to imagine that the two alternative interpretations would have been simultaneously available to awareness, but apparently this is not the case. A moment-by-moment decision seems unavoidable.\n\nRecent investigations of visual scene analysis have made extensive use of bistability illusions (for reviews, Leopold and Logothetis, 1999; Long and Toppino, 2004; Sterzer et al., 2009). This enduring interest is perhaps because bistability highlights fundamental processes involved in perceptual organization. As we argued for ASA, sensory scenes contain by necessity some degree of ambiguity. The problem of “inverse optics,” just as “inverse acoustics,” is ill-posed. Our perceptual systems constantly operate in this inference regime, but we are generally not aware of it because, fortunately, one highly plausible interpretation usually trumps all the others. That this interpretation mostly corresponds to reality is an impressive sign of the sophistication of perception, and not of the simplicity of the problem (as attempts at artificial vision and audition remind us). With this in mind, bistability can be seen as a clever trick by neuroscientists to study the general inference processes that are always at work in perceptual organization.\n\nAs an aside, it is interesting to consider the kind of neural models that have been proposed for visual bistability. Whereas some studies implicate higher brain regions such as pre-frontal cortex, which are most naturally associated with decision and inference (Sterzer and Kleinschmidt, 2007), there are also formalisms based on low-level competition between incompatible percepts (Lankheet, 2006) or non-linear neural dynamics (Kelso, in press) that achieve the same phenomenology. This highlights the fact that the “decision processes” we refer to here may take many different forms when implemented with neurons, some of them bottom-up and largely automatic.\n\nAuditory bistability\n\nThe history of auditory bistability is much more modest than that of visual bistability, but recent studies suggest that it may also provide a useful experimental probe for ASA. A surprisingly simple paradigm already reveals the existence of auditory bistability: in its various forms, the “streaming paradigm” uses only two pure tones of different frequencies, arranged in repeating patterns (Figure ). Depending on the frequency and time difference between the tones, listeners report either grouping all tones together in a single melody (a single stream) or splitting the sequence in two concurrent melodies (two streams). Early on, it was noticed that perception of one or two streams could change across stimulus presentations for a same listener and even within a single presentation (van Noorden, 1975; Bregman, 1978). It had thus been remarked that streaming presents a “striking parallel” with apparent motion, a visual stimulus that is bistable (Bregman, 1990, p. 21). However, the changes in percept were usually assumed to be under the volitional control of the listener (van Noorden, 1975) and were not until recently subjected to the range of experimental and theoretical tools applied to visual bistability.\n\nIn fact, auditory streaming is a perfectly fine instance of bistability, as shown by a formal comparison between the perception of ambiguous stimuli in audition and vision (Pressnitzer and Hupé, 2006). In this study, the auditory stimulus was a streaming sequence (van Noorden, 1975; Figure ), and the visual one consisted of bistable moving plaids (Hupé and Rubin, 2003; Figure ). A common point between the two is that they can be perceptually grouped as a single object (a stream or a plaid), or split in two different objects (two streams or two sets of lines). Also, the “correct” organization is ambiguous. The dynamics of percept alternations in auditory streaming were found to display all of the characteristics that define visual bistability (e.g., Leopold and Logothetis, 1999). Percepts were mutually exclusive, that is, subjects reported successively one or two streams but rarely an intermediate percept between the two. The percept durations were random and followed a log-normal statistical distribution. Finally, the effect of volition was limited and highly similar between modalities: when instructed to try and maintain one perceptual interpretation in mind, observers were unable to lengthen the average duration of the target interpretation; rather, they were only able to shorten the duration of the unwanted interpretation. Other authors have independently strengthened the case for auditory streaming as a bistable phenomenon (Denham and Winkler, 2006; Kashino et al., 2007). Interestingly, in those studies, bistability for streaming seemed to be the rule rather than the exception as it could be observed over a surprisingly broad range of stimulus parameters.\n\nAn apparently unrelated example of auditory bistability can be found in a paradigm termed verbal transformations (Warren and Gregory, 1958). Listeners were presented with a rapid sequence of repeated verbal material, typically syllables or words (e.g., “life life life”). After prolonged exposure, most listeners reported subjective alternations between the original material and some transformed speech forms (e.g., switches between “life life life” and “fly fly fly”). Warren and Gregory (1958) argued that verbal transformations were the auditory analog of reversible figures in vision. Recently, Sato et al. (2007) and Kondo and Kashino (2007) confirmed that the dynamics of switches between speech forms were similar to other examples of bistable stimuli.\n\nThese examples suggest that, despite large acoustic differences, many of the stimuli used to study ASA may share a common point. When in the right regime, the decision processes involved in ASA are revealed by bistable perceptual switches, which display strikingly similar characteristics across all stimuli.\n\nThe art of voice-leading\n\nA lot of music around the world, starting from what is arguably the most valuable kind of all, lullabies, involve a single acoustic source. However, perhaps because of the social value of music (McDermott and Hauser, 2005; Fitch, 2006), there are also many examples across cultures of musical ensembles involving more than one source. Musicians may then wish to avoid the acoustic muddle that would result from a random superposition of sound sources and try to simultaneously express several distinct melodic lines. This is what is termed polyphony. In Western music, it has been conceptualized through numerous treatises, providing various kinds of advice on how to best achieve “voice-leading.”\n\nA particularly fascinating example of voice-leading is to be found in the Musical Offering from J. S. Bach (Figure ). The circumstances of the composing of this piece are worth repeating. The title refers to a single melodic line that the emperor Friedrick II of Prussia presented to Bach, perhaps as a challenge to his composing skills. The theme can be seen and heard at the beginning of the example of Figure and Sound Example S2 in Supplementary Material. From this royal “offering,” Bach was reportedly able to improvise on the spot a polyphonic canon involving several voices. Later on, he returned a score containing several variations on the theme, including the tour de force that is the “Ricercar, a 6.” In parts of this later canon, six different melodic lines are present.\n\nTo help the listener distinguish between the voices, the writing takes advantage of many of the rules of ASA (Huron, 2001). For instance, synchronous harmonic intervals are carefully avoided to avoid fusion between voices, while the pitch steps within a voice are relatively small to promote stream formation. These are two of the most potent cues to vertical and horizontal grouping, as we have seen above. Many, more subtle rules of ASA also seem to be enforced in the music of Bach, as discussed in Huron (2001).\n\nIn addition, and perhaps revealingly, some of the canons of the Musical Offering are known as “ambiguous canons,” bearing the religious inscription “Quaerendo invenietis” (Seek and you shall find). We may speculate on another meaning of this inscription. Indeed, as we have seen, ASA is per nature ambiguous, and especially so for such complex architectures as those imagined by Bach. The listener is thus left to his own devices to solve the perceptual riddles contained in the music. In the twentieth century, Anton Webern paid tribute to this masterpiece of controlled ambiguity by orchestrating it (Sound Example S3 in Supplementary Material). By assigning different timbres to parts of the canon, he suggests to the listener his own reading of the intricate polyphony, as there were no indications of instrumentation on the original score. In his own words: “My orchestration aims at uncovering the relations between motifs. […] Is it not about awakening what is still asleep, hidden, in this abstract presentation that Bach gave and which, because of that, did not exist yet for many people, or at least was completely unintelligible?” (Letter to Hermann Scherchen, own translation)."
