FPGG initiates interdisciplinary, inter-institutional programs at the chemistry/physics/biology/medicine interface with an objective of generating innovative breakthroughs for global Health Care. It characterizes by the rapid decision processes of its Steering Committee that enable the initiation of risk-taking projects within 2 months. As an integrated part of its business model FPGG also facilitates the setting up of industrial joint-research agreements focused on Small and Medium Enterprises. An innovative marketing strategy, leveraging the French Research Tax Credit has allowed €3.2m of successful contracts within 2 years and paved the way toward sustainability. Recently 3 successful applications from FPGG added €18m to its original €20m funding. This will enable the establishment of a 4000m^2 Institute Pierre-Gilles de Gennes for Microfluidics that aims to create a unique technological platform for fast prototyping of lab-on-chip applications.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.fpgg.org\n\nExternal link for Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes pour la Recherche\n\nIndustry\n\nResearch Services\n\nCompany size\n\n11-50 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nParis\n\nType\n\nNonprofit\n\nFounded\n\n2007\n\nSpecialties\n\nDiscovery, Innovation, Life Sciences, Physics, Chemistry, Cancer, Neurosciences, and Medical Device"
