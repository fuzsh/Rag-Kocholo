        "text": "Nobel laureate called the 'Issac Newton of our time'\n\nPierre-Gilles de Gennes\n\nNobel Prize-winning scientist Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, 74, dubbed the \"Isaac Newton of our time\" for his pioneering research on liquid crystals, has died.\n\nHe died Friday in Orsay, a suburb of Paris. A relative confirmed the death but provided no details.\n\nDe Gennes was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1991 for breakthrough work on liquid crystals, a substance that has the properties of both a liquid and a solid and is now used in televisions and computer screens.\n\nOn awarding the prize, the jury called de Gennes the \"Isaac Newton of our time.\"\n\nDe Gennes rejected the comparison with the English scientist, chalking the description up to the \"Nordic lyricism\" of the Stockholm-based award's jury, French media reported.\n\nDe Gennes was home-schooled by his parents and later attended Paris' elite Ecole Normale Superieure university, according to Le Monde.\n\nAfter graduating, he began research on atomic energy and magnetism.\n\nWhile other laboratories were paralyzed by student riots that shook France in 1968, Gennes brought together several teams of researchers to work on liquid crystals, Le Monde said. His work helped make France a world leader in the field.\n\nAnthropologist took on a wide range of subjects\n\nDame Mary Douglas\n\nDame Mary Douglas, 86, an anthropologist whose influence ranged beyond the traditional questions of her field to examine areas as diverse as kosher diets, consumer behavior, environmentalism, and humor as she described how humans work together to find shared meaning, died on May 16 in London.\n\nOn May 8, she was made a dame commander of the British Empire. She was thrilled that Prince Charles took part in the ceremony, because he studied anthropology at Cambridge, her friend Alida Brill said. The cause of death was complications from cancer, Brill said.\n\nDouglas marshaled a vivid, pugnacious writing style in more than 15 books to describe the relationship between culture and social action, leading to her conclusion that knowledge is built by people communicating and responding to one another.\n\n\"The colonization of each other's minds is the price we pay for thought,\" she wrote.\n\nShe saw little difference between \"modern\" and \"primitive\" societies, and sometimes drew startling conclusions. In the provocative 1982 book \"Risk and Culture: An Essay on the Selection of Technical and Environmental Dangers,\" she and Aaron Wildavsky argued that environmentalists' complaints reflected an antipathy toward dominant social hierarchies.\n\nThe authors compared environmentalists to religious cults and superstitious groups of the past.\n\nThis train of thought reflects that of one of Douglas' most discussed books, \"Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo\" (1966).\n\nShe explored the relationships between dirt and holiness, impurity and hygiene, as means of defining one's own group as distinct from other groups.\n\nFormer political prisoner headed Morocco truth panel\n\nDriss Benzekri\n\nDriss Benzekri, 57, a former political prisoner who later headed a truth commission in Morocco, has died, a former colleague and fellow detainee said Monday.\n\nBenzekri died Sunday in Rabat, Morocco, of complications from stomach cancer, said Abdelhamid Amin, a former president of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights.\n\nBenzekri was president of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission, founded in 2004 by Morocco's King Mohamed VI to look into past human rights abuses -- including under the monarch's father, King Hassan II.\n\nIt was the first such truth-seeking body in the Arab world and has been praised as a model for other Arab countries confronting dark pasts.\n\nBenzekri, a former Marxist, was one of many Moroccans illegally detained, imprisoned, tortured, or forcibly \"disappeared\" by state security forces from the 1950s to the 1990s. The commission put the number of victims in the hundreds; most human rights activists say it is in the thousands.\n\n\"Despite chronic back pain caused by torture and a debilitating illness, Driss continued to fight for human rights until the end of his life,\" said Joe Stork, deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Human Rights Watch."
