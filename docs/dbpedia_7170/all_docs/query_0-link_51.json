        "text": "Choosing where to study is one of those life decisions that needs to be weighed and properly considered from all angles. When it comes to figuring out where to get a master’s degree, picking the right university becomes an even more complex dilemma. From prestige to possibilities, there are all sorts of factors to consider. It’s a commitment that can have lasting effects and shape students’ lives quite dramatically – as it could be the first step to future success in their fields, and even a Nobel Prize. Here, we look at the 50 universities with the most Nobel-winning affiliates in the world – from students to researchers and professors.\n\nPlease note: We’ve included both the official and unofficial counts for Nobel Prize winners affiliated with the different universities on this list; the former have been issued by the institutions themselves, while the latter – generally making use of broader sets of principles – are derived from other sources.\n\n50. University of Washington – Seattle, Washington\n\nNobel winners: 12\n\nImage Source\n\nThe University of Washington, which was established in 1861, is well known for its excellent medical school, which is regarded as one of the top facilities of its kind worldwide. The University of Washington School of Medicine was established in 1946; according to U.S. News & World Report, it is the second best American medical school for primary care, and number nine for research. The institution is also known for its well-rated Foster School of Business. Celebrated, Nobel-winning economist George J. Stigler, who received his accolade in 1982, earned his BA from the university in 1931. Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner Martin Rodbell, who picked up his honor in 1994, was a University of Washington graduate, as were doctor George H. Hitchings (1988) and biologist Linda B. Buck (2004).\n\n49. Duke University – Durham, North Carolina\n\nNobel winners: 12\n\nImage Source\n\nDuke University was founded in 1838, when it was known as Brown’s Schoolhouse; now, according to the 2013 QS World University Rankings, it’s the 23rd best university in the world. That same year, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings placed Duke 17th worldwide. The college’s list of Nobel-winning graduates includes notable physicist Charles H. Townes, who received the honor in 1964. His pioneering quantum electronics research led to the development of the maser and the laser. In light of this achievement, Townes has been dubbed the “founding father of the laser.” Nobel-winning physicist Robert C. Richardson – who obtained his award in 1996 – is also a Duke graduate. The school’s Nobel-winning faculty affiliates have included economist Joseph E. Stiglitz, who won his prize in 2001, physician Peter Agre (2003) and Nigerian playwright and poet Wole Soykina (1986).\n\n48. King’s College London – London, U.K.\n\nNobel winners: 12\n\nImage Source\n\nThe Duke of Wellington and King George IV founded King’s College London in 1829. Interestingly, the college is one of four institutions that claim to be England’s third ever university – the other three being University College London, Durham University and the University of London. One of the college’s most iconic Nobel-winning graduates is South African activist and retired archbishop Desmond Tutu, who obtained the prize in Peace in 1984. South African-born biophysicist and Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner Michael Levitt (2013) earned his B.Sc. at King’s College in 1967. Physicist Peter W. Higgs (2013) is also a King’s College London graduate, earning his Ph.D. there in 1954 before moving on to the University of Edinburgh. Peruvian-Spanish writer Mario Vargas Llosa (2010) also taught at the university between 1969 and 1970.\n\n47. City University of New York – New York City, New York\n\nNobel winners: 13\n\nImage Source\n\nThe City University of New York dates back to 1847, when it was known as the Free Academy. In 1866, it became the College of the City of New York, and in 1961, this institution merged with other local colleges to become the City University of New York. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger – who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 – studied accounting at City College of New York before he was called for duty in the U.S. Army in 1943. The school’s list of Nobel-winning graduates includes physicist Leon M. Lederman (1988), Physiology or Medicine winners Arthur Kornberg (1959), Julius Axelrod (1970) and Rosalyn Yalow (1977), Chemistry winner Herbert A. Hauptman (1985) and esteemed economists Kenneth J. Arrow (1972) and Robert J. Aumann (2005). Nobel-winning economist Harry M. Markowitz was honored in 1990 while working as a professor at City University of New York’s Baruch College.\n\n46. University of Copenhagen – Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nNobel winners: 13\n\nImage Source\n\nThe University of Copenhagen is among the two oldest universities in Scandinavia, being first established in 1479 as a medieval university. In 2013, the Academic Ranking of World Universities listed the University of Copenhagen as Europe’s ninth best college. The school’s most famous Nobel-winning graduate is arguably renowned Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1922), who famously produced his namesake atomic model in 1913. However, Niels’ son and fellow Nobel-winning University of Copenhagen graduate Aage Bohr not only followed in his father’s footsteps when he obtained the honor in 1975, but also by returning to the university (in his case, as a professor). Faroe Islands-born physician and Nobel winner Niels Ryberg Finsen (1903) is also a University of Copenhagen graduate.\n\n45. École Normale Supérieure – Paris, France\n\nNobel winners: 14\n\nImage Source\n\nParis’ École Normale Supérieure (ENS) was originally founded in 1794 as an alternative to the country’s conventional higher education offerings. The idea was to establish a school imbued with the spirit of the Enlightenment. ENS is divided into two primary departments: sciences and humanities.

Arrow became the youngest laureate in Economic Sciences at the age of 51 – a record that still stands today. In 2013, Thomas C. Südhof – who has been called “a biomedical exceptionalist” – received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. That year, current Stanford professor Michael Levitt also shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his role in “the development of multi-scale models for complex chemical systems.”\n\n7.

Cambridge is famous for its contributions to mathematics and science, due largely to the achievement of star students such as Sir Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, Sir Francis Bacon and Nobel winner Lord Rayleigh (1904). The university’s Nobel pedigree extends far and wide: it includes physicists Lord Ernest Rutherford (1908), Niels Bohr (1922) and Abdus Salam (1979), writers Bertrand Russell (1950) and Patrick White (1973), economist Amartya Sen (1998), Peace Prize winner Sir Austen Chamberlain (1925) and Chemistry double winner Frederick Sanger (1958, 1980).
