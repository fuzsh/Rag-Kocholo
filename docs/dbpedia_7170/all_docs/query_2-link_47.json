Among them, 10 already obtained a permanent research position (7 as CNRS fellows, 2 as university lecturer, and 1 in the Max-Planck-Institut FÃ¼r Eisenforschung, DÃ¼sseldorf), 2 are working as managers in industry (Schlumberger, Essilor), 3 as professors in highschools, the other being still finishing their phd or postdocs.\n\nFrom a general perspective, my research interests are at the interface between various domains: \"soft condensed matter\", \"hydrodynamics\", \"nano-science\", as well as âeveryday life scienceâ. I combine experiments, theory, and molecular simulations to explore the intimate mechanisms of the dynamics of matter (fluids, complex systems, â¦) from the macroscopic down to the molecular level. Applications are in the fields of micro- and nano- fluidics, large scale hydrodynamics, complex fluids, granular materials, colloidal science, material science. I like to consider that my research profile is non-specialized and broad. By taste, I choose to explore a broad range of topics, from academic âorientedâ to more iconoclastic subjects, mainly motivated by curiosity. My research is also broad in terms of the scales I explore â doing the splits between the macro- and the nano- scales -, as well as in terms of research tools I use: this involves a variety of experimental tools to investigate the dynamics of fluids at small scales (microfluidics, optical techniques, â¦), but also the toolbox of theoretical and computational statistical physics and condensed matter (involving molecular dynamics, stochastic simulations, etc.). An underlying aim of my research is to effectively make the link (âbridge the gapâ) between the macroscopic world and its microscopic foundations.\n\nOver the last decade, I have made, with my research group, contributions on the following questions:\n\n- Hydrodynamic slippage at the nanoscale : fundamental understanding of liquid-solid friction and hydrodynamic slippage at the molecular scales. Experimental measurements of the nanometric slippage, using on a specifically designed approach based on fluctuations.
