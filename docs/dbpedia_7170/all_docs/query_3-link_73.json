        "meta_description": "University | Profiles, interviews, podcasts, seminars… to celebrate the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, on February 11, meet female PhD students, postdoctoral fellows, engineers, lecturers, researchers and artists at PSL who are making science attractive. , , Fewer than 35% of scientists worldwide are women and only about 30% of female students in higher education choose fields related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics. These percentages are changing, but women still struggle to contribute equitably to solving global crises – whether social, environmental or economic. At Université PSL, in our research chairs, non-profit organizations, individual or group projects, special events, there are many initiatives helping to promote the work of women in science at PSL. The screening and debate on the documentary “Picture a Scientist” at ENS - PSL and ESPCI Paris - PSL, research projects run by the Women and Science Chair at Dauphine – PSL, and encouragement from our schools, repeated successfully every year, to invite young female PhD students and postdoctoral fellows to participate in the L’Oréal-UNESCO Young Talents award… these are just a few examples. Most recently, researchers from the Observatoire de Paris – PSL and the École Pratique des Hautes Etudes – PSL set up a mentoring program called Women in Science PSL. Seventeen female PhD students will be supported by eight mentors from all walks of life. Over the year, in addition to one-to-one discussions with their mentor, mentees will meet once a month to participate in workshops, courses, discussion circles and conferences, to receive support in building their career project. The International Day of Women and Girls in Science on February 11 is an ideal opportunity to highlight this commitment. Many initiatives, portraits and presentations of the work of women researchers are on show, with a selection given here. , , Webinars, round tables, exhibitions Webinar on scientific culture organized by the Observatoire de Paris - PSL: The presence of women in astronomy and astrophysics, chaired by Mathilde Mâlin, doctoral student at the Laboratory for Space Science and Astrophysical Instrumentation (LESIA, Observatoire de Paris - PSL) - Replay 100% digital Round Table organized by the European University EELISA: Women who make science happen, chaired by Sofia D'Aguiar (Executive Director of EELISA) and Maria Rentetzi (Head of the Chair of Science, Technology and Gender Studies) and with contributions from several panelists, including Solène Demay, former student of Mines Paris - PSL and founder of the WoMinesPSL organization The exhibition \"La Science taille XX elles\" at Mines Paris – PSL, portraying 48 female scientists involved in research. , Portraits, interviews and meetings with women scientists, engineers and future researchers 4 questions to Claudie Cohen, researcher in paleontology at EPHE - PSL, and Mathilde, PhD student at the Coastal Geoecology Center (CGEL) at EPHE - PSL Overview of daily life and current research topics in the Collège de France laboratories through 5 interviews with PhD students, researchers and research engineers Meeting with administrators, communications managers, lab technicians... all essential female players in daily scientific activity at ESPGG Interviews with Karen Monsalve-Grijalba, Laure de Thieulloy and Hanwei LI, PhD students and postdoctoral fellows in the ENSCP - PSL laboratories Portrait of a young artist, PhD student in the PSL - SACRe program at CNSAD - PSL Portrait gallery of scientists at Mines Paris - PSL whose work has made the headlines Testimonials from Valérie Pichon, Co-director of the CBI laboratory, Gisella Vetere, Professor in the Brain Plasticity Unit, and Hélène Lecomte, engineering student behind the PC Témoigne project at ESPCI Paris - PSL on the role and place of women in science today , Prizes, honors and biographies of some women researchers who marked 2021 They are some of the most talented scientists of their generation Spotlight on the prizes, medals and distinctions awarded to honor the work of women researchers at ENS - PSL in 2021 Presentation of the career paths and key milestones of five researchers at Dauphine - PSL who were particularly outstanding in 2021 Profile of Anke Lindner, researcher at the PMMH laboratory (ESPCI Paris - PSL) CNRS silver medal in 2021 Seven young PhD students and postdoctoral fellows from ENS – PSL, ESPCI Paris – PS, the LaBex Corail at EPHE - PSL, the Observatoire de Paris – PSL, the Institut Curie and the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique received one of the prestigious L'Oréal-UNESCO \"Young Talents France\" awards in 2021 , A glimpse of their work (podcasts, articles, etc.) Selection of Savoirs-ENS podcasts: Conferences \"Un shot d'éco\" podcast with 8,000 listeners by Anne-Laure Delatte, economist with CNRS and at the Dauphine Economics Laboratory (LEDa, Université Paris Dauphine - PSL) , , Women at PSL , L'Oréal - UNESCO Young Talents France award for Women and Science Created in 2007, the aim of this program is to identify and reward talented young women researchers. In all, 335 such women have received an endowment from the L’Oréal-UNESCO for the Women in Science program. Every year, many PhD students and postdoctoral fellows from PSL laboratories make successful applications. As well as receiving a research grant of €15,000 for PhD students and €20,000 for postdoctoral fellows, each successful candidate takes part in a training program in line with their scientific field to give them the means to break the glass ceiling. , Deadline for applications:March 11, 2022 , Some profiles and interviews for you to read or reread: Françoise Combes, European winner of the L'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science International Awards 2021 “We need to encourage young women in science to take the plunge!” Fabienne Casoli (President of the Observatoire de Paris–PSL), Anne Christophe (Associate Director, Sciences, ENS–PSL), Geneviève Almouzni (NRS Research Director at the Institut Curie) and Annie Colin (Associate Director, Institut Pierre-Gilles de Gennes) – four role models for young female researchers – gave an interview about their observations and ideas about changing the status of women in science. \"In my future career, I want to tackle climate challenges.\" Hortense, first-year student in the Energy Master's program at PSL Research - Creation: The Clothing Clinic by Jeanne Vicerial, (doctor, SACRe)",
