Among them, a tall, elegant man is still very present in our minds and hearts — Pierre-Gilles de Gennes. He has influenced many fields of science and many of us. The ideas Pierre-Gilles introduced were almost always very novel, creating many possibilities. Hundreds of people would start working right away on a new suggestion of PierreGilles’ ! His ideas bear important consequences in the present as well. Thus, it became natural to pick out a few of these contributions and ask some of the leaders in their fields first to explain the ideas, and then to show how it led to the current state of the art. This is what World Scientific asked Francoise Brochard-Wyart, Julien Bok and myself to organise in two volumes. The first one is dedicated to solid state and liquid crystal physics. The second deals with soft condensed matter and biological physics. The general title “P.G. de Gennes’ Impact on Science” reflects the goal that we would like to attain: to give the reader an idea of Pierre-Gilles’ contribution to science. Rather than just “an idea”, perhaps “a measure” would be better but how is it possible to gauge more than 500 original papers in more than 15 different areas from solid state physics to biology? Three aspects of his contributions will be missing though. The first one concerns PierreGilles’ impact in chemistry: he had a great admiration for the inventiveness of chemists and was able to make many relevant suggestions during his conversations with synthetic chemists. His papers on asymmetric synthesis, written to commemorate Pierre and Jacques Curie’s discovery of piezoelectricity, are in Pierre Curie’s vein: they are important for theorists but do not reflect the real influence he had on liquid crystal, polymer and colloidal chemistry. The second one concerns the impact he had on the industry. He has been the scientific advisor of companies such as General Electric, Exxon, Rhˆ one Poulenc and Rhodia. He was also on the board of directors of several other companies. I know he had a significant influence in many important decisions, but by their nature they cannot be public knowledge. The third important aspect is Pierre-Gilles’ dedication and gift for communicating his passion for science. To give an example, after being awarded his Nobel Prize, Pierre-Gilles went throughout France to high schools for several years and gave lectures on soft matter which triggered many vocations in this area of science. In the following paragraphs, I try to explain how Pierre-Gilles’ scientific life helped us narrow the scope of the present books.\n\nApril 16, 2009\n\n14:3\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nviii\n\nWhen he starts his career in 1955, Jacrot and Cribier at Saclay have just observed antiferromagnetic order with neutron scattering. The young Pierre-Gilles works out the theory, which is still a landmark nowadays. Philippe Monod tells me that Pierre-Gilles is also the first to suggest the use of neutron scattering to show the existence of vortex lattices in the superconducting Schubnikov phase. During his postdoc in Charles Kittel’s group at Berkeley in 1957, he keeps working on magnetism, in particular, on double exchange and ferromagnetic resonance in rare-earth garnets. Jacques Friedel has fully understood the scientific interest motivating all this work and attracts him to Orsay. In 1958, they write a paper together discussing resistive anomalies in magnetic metals: early “spintronics”! We are very grateful to Jacques Friedel for accepting to describe this work along with its consequences. All throughout his life, Pierre-Gilles will be eager to learn new fields. He quickly gets interested in superconductivity. He sets up a very active group where theories and experiments are simultaneously investigated. Superconductivity is a very competitive field, which blooms after the BCS theory provides the long expected microscopic understanding of the phenomenon. Here, Pierre-Gilles provides us with an original perspective. He understands that the gap between the phenomenological Landau–Ginzburg theory and the microscopic BCS theory must be bridged, which he does simultaneously with Gork’ov in Moscow. This allows him and his collaborators to discuss surface effects and vortices. With Saint James he predicts the existence of a surface critical field Hc3 , which is subsequently observed by Alexis Martinet, one of his young collaborators. He also predicts with Saint James, one year before Andreev what is now known as the Andreev–Saint James reflection: electrons impinging on a normal superconductor interface from the normal side can be reflected as holes when a Cooper pair is transmitted on the superconducting side. The experimental activity is also brilliant. Pierre-Gilles has built a very active young group world-renowned as the “Orsay superconductor group”. In 1967, he summarises his thoughts on superconductivity in the book Superconductivity in Metals and Alloys which is still a reference in the domain. It is time for him to sail towards new continents. Yet, he will always keep an eye on superconductors and superfluids, and once in a while publish a paper. In 1988, when high temperature superconductors are discovered, he proposes a mechanism based on magnetic interactions. At the same time, he attracts his friend Julien Bok to ESPCI (Ecole Sup´erieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielles), asking him to develop the activity on “High Tc s”. Julien is a brilliant proponent of the Van Hove singularity with conventional electron-phonon interactions, Pierre-Gilles is not a man of cliquishness; he is only concerned with the quest for understanding and he knows Julien will do well. It was thus natural to ask Julien Bok to write a contribution on high Tc s in this volume. He discusses the high Tc problem in the light of Pierre-Gilles’ very last paper, which he published in 2007 with Guy Deutscher who was one of his early collaborators. In turn, Guy Deutscher has played an important role in convincing the international community that the Andreev effect should be named the Saint James–Andreev effect. He was indeed a witness at Orsay when this important work was made. Guy tells us that he asked Pierre-Gilles if he wanted the effect to be called “de Gennes–Saint James–Andreev” but Pierre-Gilles declined\n\npreface\n\nMarch 31, 2009\n\n18:51\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\npreface\n\nix\n\nthe offer although he was a co-author in the first paper. Guy Deutscher’s contribution deals naturally with elementary excitations in the vicinity of a normal metal-superconducting metal contact. One cannot switch to another field of interest of Pierre-Gilles without mentioning uncharged superfluids. He contributes to the description of the dynamics of triple lines involving superfluid helium, to that of the symmetries of the helium 3 superfluid order parameter, and in these last years becomes very interested in supersolids. This leads him to describe what is, to my knowledge, the first theoretical description of the motion of a dislocation in the quantum regime. He has long discussions on supersolids with S´ebastien Balibar. In the book, we asked S´ebastien to discuss Pierre-Gilles’ suggestions together with the stateof-the-art results. In 1967, the new continent is soft matter. Pierre-Gilles starts by describing the dynamics of dilute polymer suspensions. Neutron scattering provides a check of his theory on conventional polymers. Nowadays, light scattering in dilute DNA solutions allows us to observe all predicted regimes with excellent accuracy and to confront theory with essentially no adjustable parameter. He also discusses the “coil-stretch” transition of polypeptides. In the following few years, Pierre-Gilles focuses his attention on liquid crystals. The community wavers between a completely obsolete “short range” view and a mathematically formal continuum description. In 1968, Pierre-Gilles simplifies the continuum description, showing where the relevant physics is. He explains the strong light scattering by nematics, and much of their dynamical behaviour. He draws around him again a large number of bright physicists. The “Orsay liquid crystal group” soon becomes as famous as the “Orsay superconductor group” was. One of the young experimentalists working on nematodynamics at that time is Pawel Pieranski in Etienne Guyon’s lab. We asked him to give his view on this aspect. Pierre-Gilles also used the Landau approach to describe phase transitions in liquid crystals. He is first very successful with the isotropic-nematic transition which he argues should be mean field-like. All his predictions are born out by experiment. He then shows a beautiful analogy between the nematic-smectic A transition and the normal conductor-superconductor transition. The smectic density modulation is analogous to the superconductor order parameter, the nematic director analogous to the vector potential, the dislocations analogous to vortices; gauge coupling is an expression of rotational invariance. The only difference is that there is no gauge invariance in general. Among the key predictions is Helium-like critical behaviour and the existence of a phase equivalent to the Schubnikov vortex phase. The success of the isotropic-nematic transition theory has been so impressive that laboratories all around the world jump to work on the problem. The critical behaviour turns out to be only qualitatively in agreement with the predictions. In particular, critical exponents seem to be anisotropic. It takes about fifteen years to observe the equivalent of the vortex phase and to work out a complete theory but the initial prediction is beautifully confirmed! Tom Lubensky, who coined the name Twist Grain Boundary to that phase is no doubt the physicist who contributed most to the fine understanding of the nematic-smectic A transition: his contribution is the penultimate of the first volume. Pierre-Gilles’ strong ties with liquid crystals ends soon after the publication of the book The Physics of Liquid Crystals in\n\nMarch 31, 2009\n\n18:51\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nx\n\n1972. As for superconductors, he keeps on following new developments in the field and from time to time introduces one more original idea like that of “artificial muscle” or fracture and spreading in smectics. Somewhat arbitrarily, we have included in the first volume a discussion on Pierre-Gilles’s impact in the physics of macroscopic random media, by Jean-Pierre Hulin, Etienne Guyon and Stephane Roux. This could have appeared in the second volume as well. Etienne, who was a member of the early superconductor and liquid crystal groups, was asked by Pierre-Gilles to reorganise the ESPCI hydrodynamics laboratory, opening its research areas to a wide variety of problems including dynamic instabilities, turbulence, magnetic fluids, wetting, and the physics of macroscopic random media. Indeed Pierre-Gilles had taken responsibility of ESPCI a few years after being appointed at the College de France. The style introduced by Etienne is in perfect harmony with Pierre-Gilles’ conception of research. Coming back to the early seventies, the years of 1971–1972 are Anno Mirabilis for PierreGilles. While making major contributions to liquid crystals, he provides fundamental input in polymer science. Improving on the tube image introduced earlier by Sam Edwards, he introduces the reptation concept which provides an elegant and powerful tool for discussing polymer dynamics. This opens the way to a large number of theoretical and experimental works which Michael Rubinstein discusses in the second volume dedicated to soft matter and biological physics. A long-standing problem is that of a self-avoiding random walk. It describes, among other things, the statistics of polymer chains in good solvents. K. Wilson has just invented a renormalization group expansion, which explains the origin of the non-trivial critical exponents characterising continuous phase transitions. He sends his preprint to friends. This is not an easy paper to read and understand. Pierre-Gilles sees right away that when the number of components of the vector is set to zero, the described situation is that of a self-avoiding random walk, a conceptual tour de force. He is so fast that his paper on the self-avoiding walk comes out before K. Wilson’s paper on the renormalisation group approach to phase transitions! Tom Witten, who has worked on the renormalisation group description of polymers during his postdoc with Pierre-Gilles, provides an analysis of this exceptional contribution to science. The renormalisation group techniques are not easy to handle: Pierre-Gilles invents the image of “blobs” which allows anyone to use the corresponding concepts without knowing it! The polymer community can now discuss very complex situations in simple terms and understand the emerging scaling laws! The price to pay is the absence of prefactors in the formulae, but the physics comes out nicely. In the second volume, Fran¸coise BrochardWyart and Karine Guevorkian illustrate the use of this beautiful tool in the context of polymers in confined geometries. Some aspects of polyelectrolytes can be discussed with scaling laws, some others like the semi-dilute polyelectrolyte solutions require keeping track of prefactors. Pierre-Gilles’ long time friend Philip Pincus discusses these cases together with Omar Saleh. In 1979, Pierre-Gilles publishes the book Scaling Concepts in Polymer Physics. Contrarily to what happened with superconductors and liquid crystals, the publication of this book does not really slow down his activity on polymers. Among some of the important areas he\n\npreface\n\nMarch 31, 2009\n\n18:51\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\npreface\n\nxi\n\ntackles a few years later are those of adhesion and friction in which polymers are essential. All the knowledge acquired on polymer dynamics proves to be important in understanding these phenomena — the use of which is ubiquitous in every day’s life. We asked Hugh Brown to expose Pierre-Gilles’ contributions. Although Pierre-Gilles keeps in touch with the development on polymers, he sails towards new continents. After the first oil crisis, oil recovery motivates strong research activity on micro-emulsions. Pierre-Gilles again contributes with a few seminal papers, introducing an important length characterising interfaces, and describing the main features of complex phase diagrams. He also becomes interested in wetting and dewetting phenomena, which play an important role in areas as diverse as textile and printing industries on the one hand, and automobile and aeronautical industries on the other. Spreading of a fluid on a wettable surface is surprisingly universal, independent of the substrate wettability. Macroscopic theories fail to explain experimental observations. Pierre-Gilles shows how the idea of a precursor film reconciles observations and theory. First, a film of microscopic thickness spreads on the substrate and then the bulk fluid spreads on the film. As always, he investigates a large number of situations: he shows the importance of van der Waals forces, discusses the spreading of polymers, smectics, magnetic fluids as well as superfluid Helium IV. He also discusses the influence of volatile impurities on the spreading velocity, the importance of the substrate topographic and chemical heterogeneities, describing in detail the case of a pinning point. Dewetting in situations mimicking either aquaplaning or printing is also investigated. A book comes naturally to summarise this activity. The French version Gouttes, bulles, perles et ondes comes out in 2002, the English version Capillarity and Wetting Phenomena: Drops, Bubbles, Pearls, Waves in 2004. For a change, there are three authors: Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, Fran¸coise Brochard-Wyart, and David Qu´er´e. We asked Lyderic Bocquet to write the article on wetting/dewetting phenomena. Looking just at Pierre-Gilles’ scientific production, one easily overlooks the fact that he was awarded the 1991 Nobel Prize! Answering an enormous amount of mail, giving television and radios interviews, interacting with high-level politicians and visiting high schools does not really slow him down. After retiring from Coll`ege de France and ESPCI, Pierre-Gilles joins the Curie Institute and learns a great deal of biology. In his amazingly elegant style, he shows an analogy between bacterial chemotaxis and gravitational interactions! He predicts the existence of a number of original phenomena, which are currently being tested experimentally. Naturally, Pierre-Gilles is interested in cell adhesion and cell spreading. He shows that the collective dynamics is important and predicts scaling regimes. Pierre Nassoy, who collaborated on the experimental side, describes the current situation. In 2006, Pierre-Gilles gives a “biologist” series of lectures on the brain function: almost no equations, but a fascinating description of the state-of-the-art knowledge. He works on olfactive memory storage and neuronal growth. In May 2007, he is working simultaneously on superconductivity with Guy Deutscher and on the creeping behaviour of a cell subjected to a uniaxial tensile stress. He has just published a few papers on solid friction with Jacques Friedel, and the analysis of the\n\nMarch 31, 2009\n\n18:51\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\npreface\n\nxii\n\nquantum motion of a dislocation!

He extended a similar treatment to the electrical resistivity of rare earth metals and then explained the magnetic coupling of their 4f shells as due to a double scattering of magnetic origin. He had meanwhile other interests, notably in resonance effects in magnetic materials and even on percolation in alloys. I explain what was new and influential in his magnetic activities and what role they played in his early contacts with C. Kittel in Berkeley and H. Casimir in Eindhoven, as well as for his recruitment in the new science faculty of Orsay, where he would soon develop an interest in superconductivity that he caught in Berkeley. I stress the importance played by such early contacts on his future research activities.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nI first met de Gennes when talking with Abragam on the Saclay campus. It must have been in 1955, when I became a consultant with Grison in the metallurgy department in Saclay. De Gennes had recently arrived from the Ecole Normale Sup´erieure of Paris and from a short experimental stay in Aigrain’s then burgeoning laboratory on semiconductors. I had met Abragam in Oxford, when visiting from Bristol with Mott; and we both were recently back from our stays in foreign countries and our British PhD’s. De Gennes gave me a deep bow and made a nice comment on my 1952 paper on impurities in metals. The tone of his voice implied that he was in a hurry to be able to publish something too and reach what he saw as our exalted stations in life. In fact, Abragam had just complained to me how hard it was to start an experimental lab in Saclay; and I had only a small bureau in the Paris School of Mines, just starting to teach, with no prospect of any lab room. For the three of us, “born too late in a world too old” seemed to apply, although we had in fact good cards to play.\n\nApril 8, 2009\n\n18:47\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\n2\n\n2.\n\nMagnetic Neutron Scattering\n\nDe Gennes was then preparing a “th`ese d’Etat” in Saclay, under the busy but kind guidance of Yvon, a known specialist of correlations in liquids and scientific director of the Saclay establishment. De Gennes was meant to analyse theoretically the magnetic neutron scattering of nickel near the Curie temperature. The experiments were carried out by Magda Ericson, a young physicist coming out of the Ecole Normale Sup´erieure de S`evres herself. France had at that time in Saclay one of the few nuclear reactors dedicated to fundamental research in condensed matter physics; and I still remember the envious looks of L´evy-Bertaut, the crystallographer from Grenoble, sent on an exploratory visit to Saclay by N´eel, who had just obtained from the French authorities the money to build a nuclear reactor in Grenoble for his own use on magnetism. In Saclay, the whole group was headed by Herpin, a fairly young university trained physicist, who was then to write on magnetism a general book that N´eel had dreamt to write all through the war, but was always distracted by new ideas when starting a new chapter! 1 Herpin was helped by some confirmed experimentalists in crystallography, such as M´eriel and Cribier, and by a group of younger physicists, theoricians as well as experimentalists. They worked on the structure of magnetic crystals and their thermal excitations, but also on correlations in liquids for Yvon and phonon spectra in crystals, following previous X-rays works by Laval and Curien. Of this group, Villain would make himself known early by his study of helical magnetism in crystals and Jacrot would develop later studies of biological materials in the Laue Langevin laboratory in Grenoble. Some of these young people would stay in Saclay and keep active contacts with de Gennes, especially Sarma and Saint James in the theory of superconductors and Janninck and Joanny in the neutron scattering of polymers.2 One must remember that, at the time of de Gennes’ thesis, this group followed N´eel in describing the magnetic properties of transitional metals in terms of a phenomenological model of atomic magnetic moments of given strength, ordered at low temperatures and progressively disordered with increasing temperature. This model had been introduced by Weiss; and his group in Strasbourg (mostly in Sadron’s thesis) had measured and analysed in this way the magnetic properties of the transitional 3d metals and of many of their alloys. Weiss had assumed that, in ferromagnetic order, each atomic moment was coupled with all the others, by a coupling of uniform strength, independent of distance. But already before the war, N´eel had pointed out that, if only neighbouring atomic moments were coupled, a better description of magnetic fluctuations was obtained in the paramagnetic range above the Curie temperature; also, assuming for some metals or compounds a tendency to antiparallel coupling at short range, one would produce an antiferromagnetic structure which would explain the properties of metals such as Mn or Cr and of their oxides. As stressed in the first International Conference on Magnetism, held in Strasbourg in 1939,3 another group of physicists, led by Slater and Mott, considered transitional metals as conductors,\n\nfriedel\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n17:12\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nfriedel\n\n3\n\nwith delocalized electrons, occupying partly a narrow energy band of mostly 3d character. Their local exchange and correlation interactions within each atomic site could lead at low temperature to a magnetic instability and different populations of the two halves of the 3d band with opposite spin directions. In the ferromagnetic case, the moment per atom could be a fractional number of Bohr magnetons, as was experimentally observed, despite a negligible l s coupling. In 1939, the only analysis of the thermal excitations of such a delocalized scheme was due to Stoner; using a free electron model, with no characteristic length of atomic size, it was unable to explain the paramagnetic atomic disorder observed by the experimentalists. Also no model explained why antiferromagnetism should be observed for nearly half filled 3d bands; and indeed the whole concept of antiferromagnetism was hotly disputed by many. It is in this framework that the new neutron scattering technique was developed after the war. The low temperature antiferromagnetic structures of metals and oxides were first observed by Shull in Brookhaven; and Herpin’s group was checking the other predictions made by N´eel, that atomic moment of strength independent of temperature were coupled by only short range interactions. To analyse the experimental data, de Gennes first showed that inelastic scatterings were only important at low temperatures and that a static approximation of the spin disordered was dominant near Tc and above.4 In that range he used a second order and molecular field treatment due to Van Hove. Starting from nearest neighbours interactions, this described the long range correlations induced around each magnetic moment, both in the paramagnetic and in the ferromagnetic ranges. It was a definite improvement on previous statistical analyses that restricted correlations effects to nearest neighbours, as used by N´eel. Van Hove’s procedure was known not to converge in the immediate neighbourhood of the Curie point, a defect which would be improved only later by Wilson’s scaling procedure. The Van Hove approximation was however good enough on a large range of temperatures above and below Tc to check N´eel’s model.5 The agreement with Ericson’s measurements6 was good enough for them both to present their theses in quick succession. De Gennes extended his analysis to antiferromagnetics above the N´eel temperature.7 He also considered the neutron scattering by liquids;8 despite Yvon’s theoretical contributions to the field, one would have however to wait for Verlet’s later computational model in Orsay to have a clear idea of the dynamic short range order in liquids.\n\n3.\n\nRare Earth Metals\n\nDuring the same period, it happened somewhat by chance that de Gennes attacked the electronic origin of the magnetic couplings of atomic moments in metals. This development occurred for rare earth metals, where the scattering of the delocalized 3d electrons by the magnetic 4f shells is in a way similar to that of the neutrons by the atomic moments in N´eel’s model of transitional metals. This work played a significant role in de Gennes’s carrier. The later works done in Orsay in the 60’s on the magnetism of transitional metals and alloys were also inspired by that study. This is why we treat in some details this work, which introduced de Gennes into the electronic structure of metals.\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n17:12\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\n4\n\n3.1.\n\nElectronic resistivity of rare earth metals\n\nDuring my weekly visits to Saclay in the late 50’s, I was encouraged by Grison to find my way out of the metallurgy department. I had many friends on the Saclay campus, who had studied with me at Ecole Polytechnique. But I soon focalized on Herpin’s group and its various activities on magnetism. I often had lunch with that group, sometimes in one of the still very simple village restaurants of Villiers-le-Bˆ acle or Gif-sur-Yvette, occasions for animated discussions on physics and politics, especially with the younger members of the group. De Gennes kept rather more to himself, but I made a point to go and chat with him for a time nearly every week. He had a wide interest in the physics of solid state, interacting not only with Yvon and Herpin’s group but with Abragam on magnetic resonance; and, as I discovered recently, he gave lectures at his Ecole Normale Sup´erieure on fermion gases, in a first version of a course on modern physics launched at the time by Brossel and CohenTannoudji. One of his more exotic interests was the percolation problem in crystalline solid solutions, for which he had induced the manager of the large computer used in Saclay to work out the limits of nearest neighbours hopping conduction for disordered solutions in various lattices, as described later in his book.9 I told him of course of my interests of the time. One was on the concept of virtual bound levels, obtained by a resonant mixing of atomic bound states with a band continuum of delocalized states, of similar energies. I had learnt of such states in Bristol, in lectures in nuclear physics given by a member of Powell’s group of cosmic rays. I had also found them in Mott and Massey’s book on atomic collisions, and had applied the concept to explain the strong scattering properties of d states of transitional impurities in nearly free electrons metals such as Cu or Al. I was then exploring other possible experimental examples and thought of the rare earth metals, with partly filled and magnetic 4f shells interacting with delocalized 3d electrons. If the 4f shells had energies near enough to the 3d band to mix together, one would rather easily predict the way their strong scattering should vary though the 4f series. Trombe, the French specialist on rare earths then working in nearby Meudon, showed me however that the measured resistivities were much too small for such a scheme, except perhaps for borderline cases such as Ce and Yb. This was disappointing to me. But if 4f shells were really localized, they should simply scatter the 3d electrons by a weak exchange term, much as neutrons were scattered by magnetic atomic moment in transitional metals. One knew that these 4f shells were magnetically coupled at low temperatures and disordered at high temperatures: there was a strong analogy between the two cases. De Gennes did not say much. But ten days later, I met him at the entrance of the Luxembourg garden, on the Boulevard Saint Michel. He was bringing to my bureau, in the neighbouring School of Mines, the paper that is reproduced here unchanged (Fig. 1),10 for which he insisted that I would join my name! This is, I think, the first paper of substance completely written by him alone. As for his neutron work, de Gennes assumes the delocalized 3d electrons to be free. He concentrates his efforts on the resistivity due to magnetic scattering near the ordering temperature T c . He shows that, in that range, the scattering is essentially elastic and can be treated in the Hartree Fock approximation. The break at Tc of the thermal variation of resistivity\n\nfriedel\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n17:12\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nfriedel\n\n5\n\ncan be explained in a simple Weiss molecular field, leading to a constant term above Tc . The effects of magnetic correlations, treated in the Van Hove technique for short range interactions, lead to weak deviations from the Weiss model, except for a peak of resistivity at Tc . This is however strong only if half the Fermi wave length is larger than the interatomic distance. Such a condition can be fulfilled for neutrons in magnetic crystals, leading to a “critical opalescence” effect.11 But it is not fulfilled for electrons in metals, especially for the essentially trivalent rare earth metals. The final discussion shows an attention to details. Thus the coupling with phonons does not change results much. The physics of low temperature spin waves should require a more refined model. The assumption of free electrons for 3d band is oversimplified both because of their 3d character and, for ferromagnetic couplings below Tc , because of the small decoupling of the two half 3d bands opposite spin. It is finally mentioned that a similar analysis should hold for magnetic transitional alloys such as AuMn or Au3 Mn, with similar variation of resistivity with temperature but especially large magnetic effects due to the resonance scattering of the 3d shells of Mn, as indeed observed. This early paper clearly shows de Gennes’ special gift to concentrate on simplified sketches where only the essential features are kept, while keeping in mind the conditions of validity of such caricatures: it is no surprise that he was a fine drawer! This paper shows also the ease with which he could transfer a certain type of analysis from one field to another, a technique that he would use repeatedly in the future. As the note added in proof stresses, we did not know that Kasuya had similar ideas at the time. 3.2.\n\nMagnetic couplings of rare earth metals\n\nShortly after this work, de Gennes published a short note on the properties of rare earths metals12 that he would develop in the context of a magnetism conference held in Strasbourg by the Soci´et´e Fran¸caise de Physique.13 This talk extends the previous work on resistivity to the indirect magnetic coupling of the 4f shells, analyzed as due to a second order scattering effect of the 3d electrons on two different shells. It was in fact the fairly direct application of an approach then recently developed under Kittel’s impulsion to describe the indirect magnetic coupling of two nuclei via their scattering with a gas of delocalized electrons, the now called RKKY interaction.14 The predicted variation of stability of the magnetic phase with the filling of the 4f shells in the rare earths series was in striking agreement with experiment, only involving an exchange scattering term deduced from the measured resistivity. Of course the analysis, based on a rough free electron model of the 3d band and on a weak coupling scheme, was hotly disputed by some rigorists. It will be improved by looking at various possible forms of magnetically coupled phases, starting with de Gennes himself,15 and later by Rocher and Coqblin in their thesis works in Orsay as well as by Mackintosh in Copenhagen for crystal field corrections. This model for rare earths will soon inspire my own admittedly qualitative description of the magnetic couplings in transitional metals: here, weak magnetic moments, developed on different atoms by their atomic exchange interactions, interact, as in the RKKY interactions, via the spin modulations that each one produces at long range in the 3d electron gas. As those modulations have a wave length related to the average Fermi wave length, this explains\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n17:12\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\n6\n\nthe change from ferro to antiferromagnetism when, in Mn and Cr, the 3d band becomes nearly half filled.16 And, as pointed out by Lederer in his thesis, such magnetic moments should survive above Tc or TN if, as likely, their local exchange stabilizing energy, computed in a tight binding approximation, is stronger than their indirect coupling.17 The 1961 Strasboug conference was a somewhat pale reminiscence of the 1939 one. But it was the first occasion for de Gennes to present a paper. I still remember the journey from Saclay via the Vosges mountains, in a car driven by one of Herpin’s group. I remember too the scathing comments by Gorter, the dutch physicist who had opposed N´eel’s antiferromagnetism and saw no interest in de Gennes’ paper. It is however this activity on rare earth metals which allowed me to suggest to Kittel, when we were both lecturing in Paris at a NATO summer school on solid state physics, that he extends to de Gennes his kind invitation to Berkeley he offered me when I was in Bristol. It is in that six months stay in Berkeley that de Gennes made the acquaintance of Pincus, one of his most faithful collaborators. And, according to Pincus, de Gennes spent many long hours of his stay to study the recent Russian literature on superconductivity, that would soon inspire his own work and that of the group he would develop in Orsay in the early 1960’s. It is by this work on magnetic scattering of neutrons and electrons that de Gennes was known when the occasion presented itself in 1961 for me to recruit him in the new university campus that developed in Orsay since 1956. De Gennes was thus rejoining his friend Blandin, one of my first PhD students, whom he had taken a habit of visiting in my small bureau of the School of Mines, before we moved to Orsay in the end of 1959. After an initial temptation to rejoin the high energy theoreticians who shared our building in Orsay, de Gennes put his mind completely on new fields of solid state physics; and his insistence to have in our lab in Orsay also some experimental work on the electronic structure of metals would soon lead to a large increase of activity, supported from the start by the CNRS.\n\n4.\n\nFerromagnetic Resonance\n\nThe idea of proposing de Gennes for a junior professorial post in Orsay was suggested to me by Abragam. They were in contact on magnetic resonance problems in ferromagnetics. A notable work, initiated in Berkeley, concerned the nuclear relaxation of iron in Yttrium iron garnets. It appears in a series of paper written with Pincus, Portis and Kittel on the fast relaxation mode and extended in her thesis by Hartmann-Boutron on the dominant slow ones.18 When de Gennes started teaching in our one year special training in solid state physics for future research students, he took for us the place of Philippe Meyer in an introduction to quantum mechanics; this was still missing in those days in France in the “normal” training of physics. But I also asked him to take part in a set of courses for more advanced research people that would vary over the years. This system would lead to notable courses, a number of which were published in book form, including de Gennes’ later ones on superconductors and on liquid crystals. His first lectures at that advanced level were on resonance techniques applied to solid state physics, especially in ferromagnets.\n\nfriedel\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n17:12\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nfriedel\n\n7\n\nIt happened that I was invited to give a general lecture on such a theme at the XIth meeting of the Amp`ere Colloquium, which gathered at the time the Europeans specialists of resonance. It was to be held in Eindhoven in 1962. I was then going through a time of stress in research, between writing with difficulty a second edition of my book on dislocations and rather heavy duties I had accepted from Aigrain in distributing French military money in support of fundamental research in solid state physics. I had been rightly reproached by de Gennes and Blandin to spend too little time in our lab in Orsay. Owing to a feeling of incompetency but also because of this revolt, I suggested that de Gennes should take my place while I would only treat a minor point on the Knight shift of metals. We went to Holland, de Gennes, his wife Annie and myself, in their small Citro¨en car, which brought us with difficulty to the top of the hills. In Eindhoven, we were very warmly received by Casimir, the scientific director of Philips with, at his side, Nozi`eres, de Gennes’ friend from Ecole Normale and son of a Philips scientist in Paris. From my closer contacts with Casimir later on, it was clear that, since that first meeting, he held de Gennes in great esteem. Indeed de Gennes was repeatedly invited to Eindhoven and, I believe, offered in a pressing way to take Casimir’s succession in Philips, just before de Gennes accepted his chair at the Coll`ege de France. Casimir was clearly a very exceptional scientific head of an industrial firm, having made a name for himself in physics before devoting his efforts to the well being of what he considered as a national treasure. His frequent personal contacts with N´eel fully profited to Philips in the application of ferrites, and I think that this contact has deeply influenced de Gennes’s attitude towards industrial research.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe period treated in this first chapter was for de Gennes a time of initiation to research and to research people. It does not appear in the notes he wrote yearly from 1961 onwards; 2 and indeed no paper of that time appears in the list of his publications that appeared some time ago. I understand this feeling of not being yet his own master in choosing his field of research. But I think that period was important for two reasons. Fluctuations near a second order phase, his initial subject, was not a simple problem; it was indeed somewhat neglected at that time, owing I believe to Landau’s systematic tendency to neglect them. But by looking at how delocalized particles were scattered by local imperfections, it lead him to problems mixing together real and reciprocal spaces, in a way Guinier had met for X-rays on crystal defects and I on impurities in metals. He would systematically develop this mixed approach in superconductors and in liquid crystals, especially in problems involving free surfaces or contacts; and this is also the main theme of his studies of soft matter. These first works also show his main qualities: quick grasp of a new problem and of its dominant features, able to lead to a useful schematization; study of possible corrections, to show the limitations of its validity more than to replace this caricature by a painstaking photography; finally ability to transfer as much as possible of its accumulated skill from old to new domains.\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n17:12\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\n8\n\nWe have seen at the beginning the role of Sadron’s thesis in Strasbourg in the ferromagnetism of transitional metals and alloys. Sadron developed after the war a lively laboratory on polymer which I had the occasion to visit in the early 60’s in my work for Aigrain. Sadron was thinking at the time of possible applications of polymer physics to biophysics. He came to Orsay to give a talk on the flexibility of polymers and DNA molecules which interested de Gennes; he then tried to enlist de Gennes’ collaboration to a new laboratory he was developing in Orl´eans on biophysics in the late 60’s. But de Gennes struck a more lasting friendship with my cousin Benoit, Sadron’s successor in Strasbourg, with whom he developed in Saclay a group studying by neutron scattering the concept of polymer reptation he had developed with Edwards: scientific history is not quite straightforward!

In the Abrikosov phase, the magnitude ¯ is the flux per unit area: B ¯ = ρV Φ0 where ρV is the number of of the average field B vortices per unit area. Schematic phase diagrams for Type I and Type II superconductors are shown in Fig. 2. The Abrikosov phase is bounded by an upper critical field Hc2 and a lower critical field Hc1 . Hc1 is the field at which it first becomes favorable for a single quantum of flux to penetrate the Meissner phase, and within mean-field theory, Hc2 is the field at which the normal metal phase first becomes unstable. The Landau-Ginzburg free energy can more generally be viewed as an effective energy in a path-integral representation of the partition function: Z Z(H, T ) = De−G[ψ]/T , (5) where T is the temperature measured in energy units. This formulation permits calculation of fluctuation corrections to the saddle-point mean-field theory.7, 8 These fluctuations, which are not so important for superconductors because their transitions are normally well described by mean-field theory, are of considerable importance for liquid crystals.

The direction of average molecular alignment in all phases is specified by a unit vector n. The layer normal in the smectic phases is indicated by the unit vector N. In the smectic-A phase, n is parallel to N, whereas in the smectic-C phase, it is not. In the text N = e z is parallel to the z-axis.\n\n3. 3.1.\n\nLiquid Crystals and the de Gennes Free Energy Nematics and Smectics\n\nThe nematic phase (N ) is the simplest of the liquid-crystal phases. It is a uniaxial phase with a local anisotropy axis at position x = (x, y, z) along the unit vector n(x) called the Frank director as shown in Fig. 3(a). The order parameter distinguishing the isotropic phase from the nematic phase is the symmetric traceless tensor Qij = S(ni nj − 31 δij ) = hνi νj − 13 i where νi is the unit vector specifying the direction of an individual molecule and S is the magnitude of the order parameter. In the absence of external aligning fields, the energy of the nematic is invariant under rigid rotations of the director, and low-energy distortions of the system are described by an elastic-like free energy (called the Frank free energy), Z 1 d3 x{K1 (∇ · n)2 + K2 [n · (∇ × n)]2 + K3 [n × (∇ × n)]2 } , (7) Fn = 2 where K1 , K2 , and K3 are elastic constants (with units of force) measuring, respectively, the energy of splay [∇ · n 6= 0], twist [n · (∇ × n) 6= 0], and bend [n × (∇ × n) 6= 0]. The Frank energy is the LC analog of the SC magnetic energy FA . In equilibrium the director is along n0 = (0, 0, 1) and to harmonic order in deviations δn = n − v0 , Z dd q 1 2 2 [(K1 q⊥ + K3 qk2 )|δn⊥ (q)|2 + (K2 q⊥ + K3 qk2 )|δnt (q)|2 ] , (8) Fn [Kα ] = 2 (2π)d where in 3-dimensions δnt and δn⊥ are respectively the projections of δn(q) onto the unit vectors et = (−qy , qx , 0)/q⊥ and e⊥ = (qx , qy , 0)/q⊥ , where q⊥ = (qx , qy , 0) as shown in Fig. 4. In d-dimensions, δnt is the (d − 2)-dimensional component of δn perpendicular to n0 [= (0, 0, . . . , 1)] and q, and δn⊥ is the component of δn perpendicular to n0 in the q − n0 plane. This decomposition breaks δn = δn⊥ + δnt into a part δn⊥ parallel to q⊥ and part 2 δnt perpendicular to q⊥ . Equation (8) implies that hδn⊥ (q) · δn⊥ (q)i = T /[K1 q⊥ + K3 qk2 ] diverges as K1 → 0 for qk = 0.\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n19:9\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nlubensky\n\n102\n\nFig. 4.

Schematic representation of the chiral cholesteric phase in which molecules rotate in a helical fashion with n(x) = (0, sin k0 x, cos k0 x). The pitch P is equal to 2π/k0 . Because n is equivalent to −n, the cholesteric state is periodic with period P/2.\n\nChirality of constituent molecules favors twisting of the director. It gives rise to an energy Z FCh = −h d3 xn · (∇ × n) (9) favoring nonvanishing twist n · (∇ × n), where h is a parameter that depends on the concentration of chiral molecules and their degree of chirality. When h is nonzero, the nematic groundstate transforms into the cholesteric state shown in Fig. 5 with n(x) = (0, sin k0 x, cos k0 x) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere k0 = h/K2 ≡ 2π/P , where P is the cholesteric pitch. Smectic phases are layered structures with a periodic density modulation in one direction. In the SmA phase, the nematic n director and the layer normal N are parallel in equilibrium, and in the SmC phase, n tilts relative to N as shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c). Smectics have a preferred layer spacing d, and many of their geometrical properties, such as their focal-conic textures, can be explained assuming a fixed layer spacing.\n\nApril 16, 2009\n\n14:22\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nlubensky\n\n103\n\n3.2.\n\nThe de Gennes Free energy\n\nWe are now in a position to begin an in-depth study of the deGennes LC-SC paper. It starts with a topological observation: If the layer spacing d is fixed and n is parallel to N, then I 1 n · dl = k , (11) d\n\nwhere the integral is around a closed loop and where k is an integer, which is zero in the absence of topological defects (dislocations) and which is equal to the number of defect lines penetrating the loop otherwise. This relation is analogous to the flux quantization in a superconductor, and it establishes the first piece of the LC-SC analogy, namely that n is the analog A and thus that ∇ × n is the analog of B and Fn is the analog of FA . In chiral systems, FCh is then the analog of FH and h is the analog of the H. However, we should note that these analogies are not absolute: A is a gauge field with no limit on its magnitude, and n is a unit vector. But what is the analog of ψ? Here de Gennes drew upon but refined previous work by McMillan9 and Kobayashi10 (though he did not reference Kobayashi), who were interested in describing the phase transition from the nematic to the SmA phase (the N A transition). They needed an order parameter to distinguish the smectic phase from the nematic phase, and they introduced a coupled mass-density-orientational order parameter σ = hcos q0 z( 23 cos2 θ − 12 )i, where θ is the angle the long axis of a rod-like molecule makes with the anisotroy axis (along z), which coupled to the nematic order parameter S = h 33 cos2 θ − 12 i. Macmillan derived a mean-field-theory phase diagram showing isotropic, nematic, and smectic-A phases [See Fig. 6]. Neither McMillan nor Kobayashi considered the phase of σ. de Gennes realized that this phase specified the position of the smectic layers and was, therefore, critically important. Rather than working with σ, he introduced the complex mass-density-wave amplitude ψ via an expansion of the mass density: 1 ρ(x) = ρ0 + √ ψeiq0 z + c.c. + · · · 2\n\nT\n\n(12)\n\nT I\n\nN\n\nTNI N\n\n(a)\n\nLFP\n\nLTP HLMTP SmA 1.0\n\nαM\n\nSmA\n\n(b)\n\nSmC 0\n\n-C⊥\n\nFig. 6.

These observations had a profound effect upon our thinking about smectic liquid crystals and more generally about periodic solids. [It is probable that de Gennes in writing down Eq. (12) was influenced by Landau’s famous papers12, 13 on phase transitions in which the idea of a mass-density wave description of solids was introduced, though he did not reference these famous papers. Curiously, Landau did not connect the phase of these mass-density-wave order parameters to phonons in these papers, and he did not consider a mass-density-wave description of smectics, probably because he had proven that fluctuations made the existence of long-range order in systems with a one-dimensional density wave impossible.12, 13 ] Layer displacements (phonons) are described by the phase variable u(x) defined at all points x in space where the smectic layering is well defined rather than in terms of the continuum limit of the Lagranagian displacement un (x, y) → u(x, y, z) of the nth layer at position z = nd employed, following Landau12, 13 and Peierls,14 in de Gennes’s earlier treatment1, 15 of the elasticity of the smectic phase. Since u(x) [or φ(x) ≡ q0 (z − u(x))] specifies the positions of layers, it also specifies the direction of their layer normals: N=\n\n∇φ ≈ (−∂x u − ∂y u, 1) ≡ (−∇⊥ u, 1) , |∇φ|\n\n(13)\n\nwhere ∇⊥ = (∂x , ∂y , 0) is the derivative in the plane perpendicular to z and the final forms are valid to lowest order in ∇u. Thep energy of a smectic must be invariant under simultaneous rotations of N and n = (δn, 1 − (δn)2 ). Under a rotation through δΩ, N → N + δΩ × N, ∇⊥ u → ∇⊥ u − δΩ × n0 , and n → n + δΩ × n0 . Thus the combination (∇⊥ u + δn) does not change to lowest order it δΩ though ∇u and δn do individually. ∇ψ brings down derivatives of u so that any term in a free energy involving ∇ψ must be constructed to depend on the combination (∇⊥ u + δn) rather than on ∇u alone. To lowest order in δΩ, ∂z u does not change. Thus to harmonic order in ∇u and δn, the free energy of ψ must be of the form Z 1 Fsm = dd x r|ψ|2 + Ck |∇k ψ|2 + C⊥ |(∇⊥ − iq0 δn)ψ|2 + g|ψ|4 . (14) 2 Apart from the anisotropy reflected in Ck 6= C⊥ , this is identical in form to the LandauGinzburg free energy Fψ for a superconductor [Eq. (2)] in which δn ↔ A and q0 ↔ 2e/~c. FA is gauge invariant whereas Fn is in a specific gauge in which δnz = 0. In addition, Fn has a splay term proportional to (∇ · n)2 , the analog of which would break gauge invariance in a superconductor. In mean-field theory, the NA free p energy FN A = Fsm + Fn like FSC predicts a secondorder transition at r = 0 with ψ = |r|/g for r < 0. It also predicts divergent correlation lengths that reflect the inherent anisotropy of the liquid crystal: s s Ck MF MF C⊥ 0 ξk = = ξk0 |t|−νk , ξ⊥ = = ξ⊥ |t|−ν⊥ , (15) |r| |r| 0 MF where t = (T − TN A )/TN A , ξk,⊥ = (Ck,⊥ /aTN A )1/2 , and νkM F = ν⊥ = 1/2 are mean-field correlation length exponents.\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n19:9\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nlubensky\n\n105\n\n3.3.\n\nProperties of the Smectic Phase\n\nIn the smectic phase, the magnitude |ψ| of the mass-density order parameter takes on a nonvanishing value, and the free energy of long wavelength distortions is dominated by the phase u and the director n. If |ψ| is spatially constant, the de Gennes free energy becomes F = Fu + Fn , where Z 1 Fu = dd x[B(∇k u)2 + D(∇⊥ u + δn)2 ] , (16) 2 where B = Ck q02 |ψ|2 and D = C⊥ q02 |ψ|2 . In Fourier space, the second term in this expression is D(q⊥ u + δn⊥ )2 + D|δnt |2 . Thus distortions, δnt of the director perpendicular to q⊥ cost a bulk energy. Since q · δnt = 0 but n0 · (∇ × δnt ) and n0 × (∇ × δnt ) are both nonzero, this means that both twist and bend but not splay are expelled from the smectic phase much as magnetic flux is expelled from a superconductor. This is the LC version of the Higgs mechanism16 of particle physics: twist and bend acquire a “mass” D upon development of smectic order. The penetration depths for twist and bend are, respectively, r r K2 K3 −1/2 ∼ |r| , λ3 = ∼ |r|−1/2 . (17) λ2 = D D Splay with non-vanishing q · δn⊥ can penetrate a smectic but it must be accompanied by distortions of the smectic layers. In the presence of nonvanishing ∇⊥ u, δn will relax to δn = −∇⊥ u + O(∇3 u) in equilibrium. In other words, n will relax to the local value of the layer normal N [Eq. (13)]. The relaxation of n eliminates the (∇⊥ u)2 ) contribution to the energy, leaving a (∇2⊥ u)2 arising from the splay term in the Frank energy: Z 1 Fel = d3 x[B(∇k u)2 + K1 (∇2⊥ u)2 ] . (18) 2 This is the famous Landau-Peierls elastic energy 12–14 for a one-dimensional solid. The Landau-Peierls derivation of this energy was based on rotational invariance of a layered structure described by the displacement u. In the current formulation [Eq. (16)], the energy is invariant with respect to simultaneous rotation of N and n. ∇u determines N, and the relaxation of n to the local N eliminates the (∇⊥ u)2 term from the free energy. The Landau-Peierls energy of Eq. (18) is a linearized energy that follows from the de Gennes free energy. To maintain full rotational invariance, the compression strain ∇ k u must be replaced by the nonlinear strain uzz = ∇k u − (∇u)2 /2. This replacement leads to some interesting consequences including the fluctuation renormalization17 of B and K1 to singular functions of wavenumber: K1 ∼ [− ln(q⊥ a)]2/5 for qz = 0 and B ∼ [− ln(qz a2 /λ)]−4/5 for q⊥ = 0, where a is a molecular length and λ is the splay penetration depth, and to compressional contributions to the energy of screw dislocations [See Sec. 8.3] The Landau-Peierls elastic energy predicts that hu2 i diverges logarithmically with system size in three dimensions and that G(x) = hψ ∗ (x)ψ(0)i and the X-ray intensity I(q) exhibit power-law singularities in three-dimensions18 ( −ηc (t) xk if x⊥ = 0 , 1 (19) G(x) = |ψ|2 exp − q02 h[u(x) − u(0)]2 i ∼ −2ηc (t) 2 |x⊥ | if xk = 0\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n19:9\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nlubensky\n\n106\n\n√ where ηc (t) = (q02 T /8π)/ K1 B, and ( |qk − q0 |−(2−ηc (t)) I(q) ∼ |q⊥ |−2(2−ηc (t)\n\nif q⊥ = 0 if qk = 0 .\n\n(20)\n\nThe power-law behavior of I(q) has been observed both in thermotropic19 and lyotropic20 smectics. 3.4.\n\nAnisotropic Rescaling and Gauge Transformations\n\nIn spite of their similarities, the LC and SC models differ in significant ways. First, the LC model is fundamentally anisotropic whereas the SC model is not, and, as a consequence, the correlation lengths for directions parallel and perpendicular to n0 are different. As we shall see in Sec. 4.2, they can even have different critical exponents. The second difference is that δn = n − n0 is a (d − 1)-component vector perpendicular to n0 . The electromagnetic gauge field A on the other hand has d independent components, but FH is independent of the longitudinal component of A, and the full SC free energy is invariant under gauge transformations ψ → ψei(2e/~c)χ , A → ∇χ. Fixing a particular gauge (e.g., ∇ · A = 0) reduces the number of fluctuating components of A from d to (d − 1). Gauge-like transformations of δn and the phase of ψ, which are really changes of variables from δn to another variable A with (d − 1) independent components along with a change of the phase of ψ (as will be discussed shortly), provide important insight the nature of the smectic phase. To arrive at gauge-transformations in LC’s that are as similar to those in SC’s as possible, it is useful to rescale fields and spatial coordinates via21 xk → s(d−1)/d xk ,\n\nx⊥ → s−1/d x⊥ ,\n\nδn → s1/d δn ,\n\n0 where s = (Ck /C⊥ )1/2 = ξk0 /ξ⊥ .

Second, since h(u0 )2 i is finite for all d > 0 2 and all K1 , the smectic order parameter in the SC gauge, hψSC i ≈ |ψSC |he−iq0 u i ≈ |ψSC | exp[− 12 q02 h(u0 )2 i], is nonzero even though the physical mass-density order parameter hψi is zero because of the destruction of long-range smectic order via fluctuations in u. Clearly the smectic order parameter depends on gauge, but it can only be measured in one gauge. On the other hand, the elastic constants K1 , K2 , and K3 and thermodynamic quantities like the free energy and the specific heat are gauge invariant. This leads to the curious results, to be discussed more fully in Sec. 4.2, that the correlation lengths obtained via measurements of correlations in ψ (X-ray scattering) will in general differ from those obtained via measurements of elastic constants and correlations in the director (light scattering). 3.5.\n\nDislocations\n\nThe analogs in the SmA phase of vortices in the superconducting phase are dislocation lines around which the phase q0 u of ψ changes by 2πm where m is an integer. If Γ is a loop enclosing a dislocation core, then I I 2πm = md . (27) du = v · dl = q0 Γ Γ There are two kinds of dislocation in smectics: screw dislocations in which the normal to the loop Γ is parallel to the layer normal N far from the core and edge dislocations in which the normal to the loop is perpendicular to N. A screw dislocation has the structure of a spiral staircase as shown in Fig. 7(a), and its displacement field is simply u = (d/2π) tan−1 (y/x). If there are many dislocations, a dislocation density m(x) can be introduced. Let R(s) specify the position of the core of dislocation α at a value of arc-length s. Then X Z dRα (s) δ (2) (x − Rα (s))ds , (28) m(x) = ds α α where δ (2) (x) is the two-dimensional δ-function in the plane perpendicular to the tangent, dRα (s)/ds, to the curve at s. Expressing Eq.

It reduces to the expression in Refs. 23 in the extreme type I limit in which λ2 and λ3 go to zero.

In addition, it describes only the SmA and not the SmC phase. Generalizations of Fsm to be fully rotationally invariant and to describe both the SmA and SmC phases and transitions between them and to them from the nematic phase are strightforward.29 Since the preferred wave-vector is different in SmA and SmC phases, it is convenient to express the mass density as ρ = ρ0 + ψ˜∗ + ψ˜ + . . . , where ψ˜ is understood to have Fourier components in the vicinity of q0 = q0 ez rather than near zero. In the SmA phase, ψ˜ = ψeiq0 z whereas in the SmC phase where planes are tilted relative to the equilibrium director n 0 2 2 −1/2 along ez , ψ˜ = ψ i(q0k z+q0⊥ x) implying a layer spacing d = 2π[q0k + q0⊥ ] .

As shown in Fig. 6(b), when C⊥ > 0, there is a transition from the N to the SmA phase in which ψ˜ ∼ eiq0k z . When C⊥ < 0, there is a transition from the N to the SmC phase with 2 ψ˜ ∼ ei(q0k z+q0⊥ x) where q0⊥ = −D⊥ /(2D⊥ ). At C⊥ = 0 where the N A transition line meets the N C transition line, there is a mean-field Lifshitz point.30, 31 Note that as C⊥ decreases, the twist and bend penetration depths λ2 and λ3 increase whereas the correlation length ξ⊥ decreases. As a result, the Ginzburg parameter κ increases [See Eq. (43)]. Thus as the NAC Lifshitz point is approached, the system becomes more and more type II indicating that a good place to look for first-order as opposed to fluctuation-induced first order N A transitions is near the NAC Lifshitz point.\n\n4. 4.1.\n\nThe Nematic-to-Smectic-A Transition Critical Phenomena and Scaling\n\nThe SC-LC paper appeared at a time of great activity in the field of critical phenomena and just before the introduction of new high-resolution X-ray sources set the stage for structural measurements of unprecedented precision. Experiments and theory in the 1960’s32, 33 established that second-order critical points were characterized by an order parameter φ that grows continuously from zero for temperature T less than the critical temperature T c as (−t)β , where t = (T − Tc )/Tc ; by a susceptibility χ = ∂φ/∂h (where h is the field conjugate to φ) that diverges as |t|−γ ; by a specific heat with a singularity proportional to |t|α ; and by a correlation length ξ that diverges as |t|−ν , where α, β, γ, and ν, are critical exponents with values that differ from those of mean-field theory (α = 0, β = 1/2, γ = 1, and ν = 1/2). By 1970, it had been established that critical points exhibited universal behavior: phase transitions with order parameters of the same symmetry (e.g., Ising or up-down, and O n or n-vector symmetry) are characterized by the same critical exponents. In addition, physical quantities exhibit scaling. For example, the wave-number dependent susceptibility obeys the relation χ(q, t) = b2−η χ(ba, b1/ν t) ⇒ χ(q, t) = |t|−γ X± (qξ) ,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the critical exponent characterizing divergent behavior as a function of wavenumber q at t = 0 (χ(q, 0) ∼ q −(2−η) ) and γ = (2 − η)ν. The scaling function X+ for t > 0 is\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n19:9\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nlubensky\n\n110\n\ngeneral different from that X− for t < 0. Thus χ(t) = Γ+ |t|−γ for t > 0 and χ(t) = Γ− |t|−γ for t < 0 with the amplitudes Γ+ = X+ (0) and Γ− = X− (0) in general different. Other scaling relations include the hypderscaling relation for the specific heat exponents: α = 2 − dν, where d is the spatial dimensionality. In 1971, Ken Wilson,34, 35 building on ideas of Kadanoff,36 introduced his famous renormalization group that, for the first time, provided a procedure for systematically calculating critical exponents and scaling functions and, in the process, established a theoretical basis for universality classes with different exponents. There followed a flurry of theoretical activity calculating critical, exponents and scaling functions, identifying new universality classes, and more. 4.2.\n\nGeneral Properties of the NA Transition\n\nThe SC-LC analogy would suggest that the NA transition is in the same universality class as the Nm-SC transition from a normal metal to a superconductor. This is indeed the preferred theoretical scenario, but others are possible; and even if the two transitions are in the same universality class, there can be significant differences in the behavior of experimental observables in the two cases. As has already been noted, nematic and smectic LCs are fundamentally anisotropic, and Fn has a contribution 21 K1 (∇ · n)2 whose counterpart in SCs would break gauge invariance. The anisotropy in LCs opens the possibility of anisotropic critical behavior with difference correlation-length exponents ν k and ν⊥ for directions parallel and perpendicular to n0 . K1 plays and important role in determining the possible critical behavior of the NA transition. Because of the gauge structure of FN A , the physical value of K1 is not renormalized by fluctuations in ψ. This implies particularly simple flows for K1 (l) under RG transformations in which degrees of freedom with wavenumber between the upper cutoff Λ and Λ(1 − δl) are removed and lengths are scaled to restore the upper cutoff to Λ. The flow equation for K1 (l) is simply dK1 = −[5 − d − (νk /ν⊥ )]K1 , dl\n\n(34)\n\nyielding fixed points with K1∗ = 0, K1∗ = ∞, or νk = (5 − d)ν⊥ (νk = 2ν⊥ in 3d). Possible flows and fixed point-structure are shown in Fig. 8. When K1 = 0, the LC and SC energies become essentially identical in the gauge with ∇ · A = 0 in the LC. Thus at the K1∗ = 0 fixed point, the LC and the SC are in the same universality class. All other LC fixed points put the LC and SC transitions in different universality classes. Since the SC fixed point is isotropic, νk = ν⊥ , 5 − d − (νk /ν⊥ ) = 4 − d > 0, and the K1∗ = 0 LC fixed point is stable. The K1∗ = ∞ fixed point is unstable within both the expansion37 and a 1/n expansion38 ruling out the flow of Fig. 8(b) at large n or near 4-dimensions. Fixed points with νk = (5−d)ν⊥ can in principle be stable, but no calculation to date has unambiguously yielded a scenario whereby it is both physically accessible and stable. If there is a stable and accessible νk = (d − 2)ν⊥ fixed point, the most likely flow is that shown in Fig. 8(c). In this scenario, there is an unstable νk = (d − 5)ν⊥ fixed point at K1∗ = K1− and a stable one at K1∗ = K1+ > K1− . Thus, there could in principle be a transition from isotropic critical\n\nApril 16, 2009\n\n14:22\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nlubensky\n\n111\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n(c)\n\n0\n\n0\n\nK1\n\nK1+\n\nFig. 8.

Before theories for and experiments on the NA transition are reviewed, a further discussion of the impact of gauge transformations on critical properties is enlightening. The elastic constants K1 , K2 , and K3 are gauge invariant. At a second-order critical point, scaling arguments and calculations predict fluctuation enhancements of K2 and K3 and behavior of B and D of the form37, 39, 40 (5−d)\n\nδK2 ∼ ξk−1 ξ⊥ B∼\n\n(1−d) ξ k ξ⊥\n\n(3−d)\n\n2 −1 → ξ⊥ ξk\n\n→\n\n−2 ξ k ξ⊥\n\nδK3 ∼ ξk ξ⊥ D∼\n\n(3−d) ξk−1 ξ⊥\n\n→ ξk\n\n→ ξk−1 ,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere the final forms apply to d = 3. Thus, measurements of these quantities (via light scattering for example) provide measurements of the “thermodynamic” correlation lengths ξk and ξ⊥ . At the νk = (5 − d)ν⊥ fixed point, K3 diverges, but K2 does not. In d = 3, both K2 and B attain constant values at the νk = 2ν⊥ critical point. The free energy density near a critical point scales as the inverse correlation volume, which for uniaxial anisotropy −(d−1) is ξk−1 ξ⊥ . Thus, the specific heat exponent α satisfies the hyper-scaling relation 2 − α = (d − 1)ν⊥ + νk → 2ν⊥ + νk .\n\n(36)\n\n∗ GSC = hψSC (x)ψ(0)i = |x⊥ |−[d+(νk /ν⊥ )−3−η⊥ ] YSC (x⊥ /ξ⊥ , xk /ξk ) ,\n\n(37)\n\n∗ G(x) = hψSC (x)ψSC (0)e−iq0 [L(x)−L(0)]i ≈ GSC (x)e−R(x)\n\n(38)\n\nAs discussed in Sec. 3.4, the LC order parameter, ψSC in the SC gauge has long-range order in the SmA phase, and its correlation function in this gauge has the standard form near the N A critical point: where K1 is assumed to have reached its fixed point value. Measurements of GSC would yield ξk and ξ⊥ if they were possible. Correlations of the physical order parameter ψ have a different form arising from divergent fluctuations of the gauge field. In the SmA phase, these fluctuations are responsible for the Landau-Peierls destruction of long-range order. In the nematic phase, they introduce additional contributions to effective correlations lengths: where R(x) = R(x) = q02\n\n1 2 2 q0 h[L(x)\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n− L(0)] i.

Extremely close X 2 X to the critical point. `k and `⊥ dominate over ξk and ξ⊥ and ξkX ∼ (ξ⊥ ) / ln ξ⊥ . Thus, 1/2\n\nX 2 X regardless of the universality class, ξkX is essentially (ξ⊥ ) . If νk = 2ν⊥ , ξ⊥ = ξk , and ξ⊥ ∼ X 2 ξ⊥ , ξk ∼ ξk ∼ ξ⊥ [ignoring the ln ξ⊥ term in Eq. (40)], and the X-ray and thermodynamic X correlation lengths are the same; otherwise, they are not. When νk = ν⊥ = ν, ξ⊥ will show −ν −ν/2 a crossover from |t| to |t| as t → 0. At the critical point R(x) is proportional to |x⊥ |1/2 for xk = 0 and to |xk |1/3 for x⊥ = 0. Thus, even though R 3 GSC (x) diverges as a power law at t = 0, the order parameter susceptibility T χ = d xG(x) is finite. This is at first a very unexpected result: divergent order-parameter susceptibilities are the hallmark of second-order phase transition. The gauge nature of the smectic order parameter clearly distinguishes the NA transition from more familiar transitions. Properties in the ordered phases in effect mandate a non-divergent susceptibility as well when νk = ν⊥ = ν: The power-law singularities in G(x) of Eq. (19) imply that χ ∼ (2 − ηc (t))−1 for ηc (t) < 2. Since ηc (t) ∼ B −1/2 ∼ |t|−ν/2 diverges as t → 0, χ is always finite at t → 0− . Thus when νk = ν⊥ , χ diverges at a temperature, determined by ηc (t) = 2, below the thermodynamic critical temperature at which K2 and K3 diverge. When νk = 2ν⊥ , ηc (0) is finite and nonzero, and χ will diverge if ηc (0) > 2.\n\n5. 5.1.\n\nTheories of the NA Transition Mean-Field Theories\n\nMean-field theories that ignore the effects of director fluctuations typically predict a secondorder NA transition. However, coupling of ψ to fluctuations in the magnitude S of the nematic order parameter reduces the value of the the fourth-order coupling g and leads to a Landau tricritical point when g = 0:31 the transition is second order for g > 0 and first order for g < 0. Fluctuations in S increase as the nematic-to-isotropic (NI) transition is approached. As a result, systems with a large nematic range, i.e., with a small value of the McMillan parameter αM = TN A /TN I , are more likely to have a second-order N A transition than those with a small nematic range, i.e., a large value of αM . McMillan’s calculation yielded a Landau tricritical point somewhere between αM = 0.6 and αM = 0.85. [See Fig. 6(a)] An effective mean-field theory can be obtained by integrating out harmonic fluctuation in δn21 (or A in the SC41 ). This theory is often referred to as the HLM theory after the authors of the original SC paper. In three dimensions, this yields a theory with a third-order term in |ψ|. A measure of the “size” of the first-order transition is the ratio, ∆T1 , of latent heat of the transition to the jump ∆Cp in the mean-field specific heat. This quantity can be expressed as ∆T1 =\n\n8 c TN A κ−6 9\n\n(42)\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n19:9\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nlubensky\n\n113\n\nwhere c TN A ≡ ∆TG is Ginzburg expression for the width of the critical region, and κ is the Ginzburg parameter given by 5 2q06 Ck C⊥ C k K3 K3 −6 . (43) κ = + g 4 K33 K2 Ck K1 + C⊥ K3 + 2(C⊥ Ck K3 K1 )1/2 Note that κ is well defined in the limits K1 → 0 and K1 → ∞. Equation (42) implies that when κ . 1, ∆T1 > ∆TG , and the first-order transition takes place before critical fluctuations become important. In other words, the N A transition is first order for Type I systems. If on the other hand, κ & 1, i.e., in Type II systems, ∆T1 < ∆TG , critical fluctuations are important, and the mean-field treatment of the first-order transition is invalid. There are then two possibilities, which will be discussed more fully below. Either the NA transition continues to be a fluctuation-induced first-order transition but with a modified expression for ∆T1 , or the transition becomes second order. Since there are experimental systems that unambiguously show second-order transitions, it is the second possibility that is realized in nature. The Ginzburg parameter κ decreases with decreasing g. Thus at small g, the system is Type I, and there is a first-order transition. At large g, there is a second-order transition that cannot be described by the above mean-field theory, and there is a fluctuation tricritical point separating the two behaviors as shown in Fig. 6(b). Thus, as g decreases, there is a competition between the fluctuation tricritical point and the Landau tricritical point. Of course, as long as the third-order term in the free energy is non-zero, the mean-field transition is first order. κ also increases as C⊥ decreases. Thus, systems become more type II as the NAC Lifshitz point is approached. 5.2.\n\nThe -expansion\n\nThe = 4 − d expansion about four dimensions predicts that the N A21, 37 and the NmSC41, 42 transitions are in the same universality class for all K1 < ∞. In the generalized theory with n/2 complex components, the “charge” runs away to produce a first-order transition for all n < 365.9. In this case, there is a first-order transition in Type II as well as in Type I systems but the expression for ∆T1 becomes41, 42 ∆T1 = const. × c TN A κ−2/φ\n\n(44)\n\nwhere φ = νxy where νxy is the correlation-length exponent for the xy model (i.e., the SC model with zero charge). In three dimensions, φ ≈ 0.67, and 2/φ ≈ 3. When n > 365.9, there a new fixed point, which we call the “SC” fixed point, with K1∗ = 0 and isotropic scaling (νk = ν⊥ 6= νxy ). When K1 = ∞, there is a runaway to a first-order transition when n < 238.2, and a new anisotropic fixed point with νk > ν⊥ for n > 238.2.37 Thus, for n > 365.9, the flow in K1 is that shown in Fig. 8(a) with no fixed point for real and positive K1 with νk = (5 − d)ν⊥ . Such fixed points do, however, exist for all n in unphysical regions of parameter space. They are characterized by the value of y = (K1∗ /K3∗ )1/2 . At one fixed point (y ∗ + 1) = −|z1 | is negative, and at the other two y ∗ + 1 = e±iπ/3 |z1 | is complex. It is imaginable that as d decreases from 4, the latter complex conjugate pair of fixed points approach the real axis and become real at d = 3 to produce the flow shown in Fig. 8(c).\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n19:9\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\n114\n\n5.3.\n\nThe 1/n Expansion\n\nThe 1/n expansion can be carried out in the SC gauge for all 2 < d < 4.38 It predicts a second-order transition with isotropic exponents at K1∗ = 0 and anisotropic exponents at K1∗ = ∞. There are no νk = (5 − d)ν⊥ fixed points for any d, and the flows are those shown in Fig. 1(a). 5.4.\n\nDislocation Theories\n\nHelfrich43 was the first to point out the possible importance of dislocations to the N A transition. The energy Ed of a dislocation loop is proportional to its length L, Ed = d L, as can be seen from Eq. (31). On the other hand, the entropy of a large dislocation loop is also proportional to its length, S ∼ sd L. Helfrich argued that a phase transition should occur when the energetic and entropic contributions to the free energy, Fd = Ed − T Sd, of a dislocation loop balance, and he predicted a transition temperature TN A ∼ d /sd . Similar arguments were used by Kosterlitz and Thouless for defiect-mediated melting transitions in two-dimensional xy models and crystals.44, 45 The N A transition can be viewed as a passage from a collection of more or less isolated dislocation loops in the smectic phase to a uniform density of entangled dislocation lines in the nematic phase. Dasgupta and Halperin46 studied a three-dimensional lattice superconductor model (LSM) that is argued to be in the same universality class as a Type II superconductor. They relate this model to a generalized Villain model that is a function of temperature, T , and normalized charge e˜; and they show that the point (T, e˜2 = 0) maps on to the point (T = 0, e˜2 = 4π 2 /T ) via a duality transformation. Thus the xy transition at (T = Tc , e˜2 = 0) maps onto a loop transition at (T = 0, e˜2 = 4π 2 /Tc ). Since e2 is proportional to 1/T under the duality transformation, the transition at T = 0 will have inverted amplitudes relative to the those of the xy transition at e˜2 = 0. The loop transition is stable with respect to turning on T , so there should be an inverted xy transition at nonzero T in the vicinity of (T = 0, e˜2 = 4π 2 /Tc ). Dasgupta and Halperin46 studied the transition at intermediate values of e˜2 numerically and found strong evidence for an inverted xy transition. The situation in the vicinity of (T = Tc , e˜2 = 0) is complicated by crossover effects, but it seems reasonable that the transition remains second order and inverted xy-like all of the way down to the xy critical point. These calculations strongly support a second-order transition in a superconductor at d = 3. Since the superconducting and N A transitions are in the same universality class at K1 = 0, this is a reasonable candidate for the universality class of the N A transition. Nelson and Toner23 studied the dislocation melting mechanism for the NA transition starting from the Landau-Peierls energy [Eq. (18)] in which director fluctuations have been 2 integrated out. They argued heuristically that ξk ∼ ξ⊥ /λ, where λ = (K1 /B)1/2 is the splay penetration depth. They treated λ as a constant and concluded that νk = 2ν⊥ . Because −(d−1) B ∼ ξ k ξ⊥ [Eq. (35)], requiring λ to be a constant near the 3d transition is equivalent to requiring νk = 2ν⊥ . The smectic-phase dislocation energy can be converted into a soft-spin model that can be analyzed in the expansion about four dimensions.24, 26 This model has a fixed point at K1 = 0 in the inverted xy universality class. It also has the same anisotropic\n\nlubensky\n\nApril 1, 2009\n\n19:9\n\nWSPC — Reprint Volume Book - Trim Size:- 10in x 7in\n\nlubensky\n\n115\n\nfixed point at K1 = ∞ as the direct de Gennes Model. There are no νk = (5 − d)ν⊥ fixed points. 5.5.\n\nNumerical Simulations\n\nDasgupta47, 48 carried out extensive simulations of a lattice model for the N A transition with different values of K1 . These simulations exhibit a continuous phase transition with a divergent specific heat characterized by an exponent α near zero but with amplitude anisotropy more characteristic of an xy rather than and inverted xy transition. The physical smectic order parameter ψ (LC gauge) exhibits anisotropic scaling whose form is nearly independent of K1 . On the other hand, order-parameter correlations in the SC gauge and the behavior of the twist and bend elastic constants indicate an isotropic critical point. Thus, these simulations are consistent with an xy-like isotropic critical point with anisotropic behavior arising from the gauge transformations discussed in Sec. 3.4. 5.6.\n\nSelf-Consistent Field Theory\n\nPatton and Andereck49, 50 have introduced a one-loop self-consistent field approximation that provides self-consistent equations for both order-parameter and director correlation functions that can be solved numerically in three dimensions. This theory assumes that the correlation lengths that appear in these two correlation functions are the same, i.e., it X assumes that the “X-ray” lengths ξkX and ξ⊥ are the same as the thermodynamic lengths ξk and ξ⊥ . As we have seen above, this is only possible if νk = 2ν⊥ [ignoring the small logarithmic term in the Eq. (41)]. Thus, not surprisingly this theory ultimately predicts νk = 2ν⊥ very near the phase transition. It, however, predicts a very slow crossover from isotropic regime (νk = ν⊥ ) at temperatures well away from the critical temperature through a weakly anisotropic regime νk ∼ 34 ν⊥ before finally reaching the strongly anisotropic regime (νk = 2ν⊥ ). This theory is appealing in that it produces via a relatively simple calculation the sort of anisotropic crossover seen in experiments. However, by requiring the X-ray and thermodynamic exponents to be the same, it restricts itself asymptotically to the universality class with νk = 2ν⊥ . It does not address the question of whether the universality class with νk = 2ν⊥ is possible or if indeed this class is ultimately the only one that is accessible. The approximations in this theory are closely tied to the original"
