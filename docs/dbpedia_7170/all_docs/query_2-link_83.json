Following a post-doctoral year at the Pasteur Institute in the laboratory of Jacques Monod, he joined the faculty of Cornell University in the Section of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology, where he became Professor in 1977 and served as Chairman from 1978 to 1980. He was a Visiting Scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science (1974) and spent two sabbatical years (1980-1981 and 1984-1985) in Paris as Professeur associÃ© at the University of Paris XII (CrÃ©teil) in the laboratory of Jean Rosa and as Visiting Scientist at the Pasteur Institute.\n\nIn 1986 he moved to the University of Geneva as Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and was Director of the Department for the period 1987-1994. He returned to the Pasteur Institute in 1994 for a sabbatical leave in the laboratory of Jean-Pierre Changeux, with whom he continues an active collaboration, as well as with Pierre-Jean Corringer. He was elected Foreign Associate of the AcadÃ©mie des Sciences de l'Institut de France in 1998 and served as Editor-in-chief of the Comptes Rendus BIOLOGIES (Proceedings of the French Academy of Sciences in Biology) 2001-2008. He held the International Chair at the CollÃ¨ge de France for the academic year 2002-2003, for which he delivered a leÃ§on inaugurale. He was awarded the LÃ©gion d'honneur by the French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin on Nov. 27, 2003 in a ceremony at the HÃ´tel Matignon. He served as President of the Swiss Biophysical Section (1994-1998) and President of the Swiss Committee of the International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics. His other activities include membership in the Scientific Commission, Curie Institute Research Section (Paris), 2002-2009; Scientific Director of Biofutur (the major French biotechnology magazine), since 2002. He is cofounder and President of the Scientific Advisory Board of GENOMIC VISION, S. A., a spin-off of the Pasteur Institute.\n\nS.J. Edelstein has published over 100 research articles and six books:\n\nINTRODUCTORY BIOCHEMISTRY: FUNDAMENTALS OF CELLULAR METABOLISM AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (Holden-Day, San Francisco, 1973)--translated into Japanese.\n\nCHEMISTRY: AN INTRODUTION TO GENERAL, ORGANIC AND BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY with Joanne M.Widom (W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, 1981).\n\nTHE SICKLED CELL: FROM MYTHS TO MOLECULES (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1986) [jacket; PDF]--translated into French.\n\nPROTEIN METHODS (Second Edition) with Daniel M. Bollag and Michael D. Rozycki (Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York, 1996).\n\nDES GENES AUX GENOMES (Odile Jacob, Paris, 2002)--published in French, translated into Portuguese.\n\nNICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTORS: FROM MOLECULAR BIOLOGY TO COGNITION with Jean-Pierre Changeux (The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore & Odile Jacob Publishing, Paris, 2005) -- inside the book at Amazon; see also e-book version THE BRAIN AS A CHEMICAL MACHINE: NICOTINIC RECEPTORS AND NEURAL COMMUNICATION.\n\nIn September 2006, Stuart J. Edelstein became Professor Emeritus at the University of Geneva. He has continued research and teaching as Visiting Professor in the Department of Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome \"La Sapienza\" (Fall, 2006), the Department of Chemistry at the National University of Singapore (Winter, 2007) and in the Ecole SupÃ©rieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris (Spring, 2007). In 2007 he joined the Computational Neurobiology group led by Nicolas Le NovÃ¨re at the European Bioinformatics Institute and was awarded a research fellowship from the Wellcome Trust for the academic year 2008-2009. Since 2008 he is Senior Member of Darwin College, University of Cambridge. In 2010 he was Visiting Professor at the Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure supported by the Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes to work with Antoine Triller and his colleagues on the biology of the synapse. During the winter quarter of 2011 he joined the Stanford University Center for Mind, Brain, and Computation to work with Jay McClelland and returned in 2012, 2013, and 2014. In October 2012 he moved with the Le NovÃ¨re lab to the Babraham Institute in Cambridge. He was appointed Professeur Extraordinaire in the Departement de Biologie, Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure, Paris in 2013 and is also associated with the Research Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology at the University College London since 2014."
