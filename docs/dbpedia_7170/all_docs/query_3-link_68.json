        "text": "Dynamical Systems Theory in the spirit of Poincare (DST) has been in vogue since the controversial award of a prize by King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway, on his 60th birthday, January 21, 1889, to Poincare. DST di used Eastward (via Stockholm, Saint Petersburg, and Moscow) to Gorky in Russia, to Japan, and Westward (via Princeton, Mexico City, and Rio), to Berkeley in California. Now in the centennial year of the premature death of Poincare, it is time for a review of these peregrinations.\n\nIt is very unusual for a mathematical idea to disseminate into the society at large. An interesting example is chaos theory, popularized by Lorenz's butterfly effect: \" does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas? \" A tiny cause can generate big consequences! Can one adequately summarize chaos theory in such a simple minded way? Are mathematicians responsible for the inadequate transmission of their theories outside of their own community? What is the precise message that Lorenz wanted to convey? Some of the main characters of the history of chaos were indeed concerned with the problem of communicating their ideas to other scientists or non-scientists. I'll try to discuss their successes and failures. The education of future mathematicians should include specific training to teach them how to explain mathematics outside their community. This is more and more necessary due to the increasing complexity of mathematics. A necessity and a challenge!\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century while Henri Poincaré (1854-1912) was already deeply involved in the developments of wireless telegraphy, he was invited, in 1908, to give a series of lectures at the Ecole Supérieure des Postes et Télégraphes (today Sup’Télecom). In the last part of his presentation he established that the necessary condition for the existence of a stable regime of maintained oscillations in a device of radio engineering completely analogous to the triode: the singing arc, is the presence in the phase plane of stable limit cycle. The aim of this work is to prove that the correspondence highlighted by Andronov between the periodic solution of a non-linear second order differential equation and Poincaré’s concept of limit cycle has been carried out by Poincaré himself, twenty years before in these forgotten conferences of 1908."
