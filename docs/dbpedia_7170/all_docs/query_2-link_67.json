Philippe Guerret surfed between Miami and Switzerland, exceled in the repositioning of companies in difficulty, and then specialized in duty free. With a head start, he imagined what could become his next playgroundand fell in love at first sight with the industry through the management of an industrial group producing active pharmaceutical ingredients. Finally, convinced that innovation and industry must go hand in hand, he created M2i Group with 3 partners, including Gilles Rubinstenn. The company, expert in complex molecules historically used for human health, diversified under Philippe Guerret’s leadership towards the production of innovative finished products with high added value for the biological crop treatment as an alternative to pesticides. In 10 years, after €60 millions raised, M2i hires 200 employees and has become the European leader in its sector by protecting more than 100,000 hectares worldwide.
