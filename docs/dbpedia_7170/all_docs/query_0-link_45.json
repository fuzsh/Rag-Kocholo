        "text": "The aftermath of the Second World War represented a major turning point in the history of French and European physical sciences. The physicist's profession was profoundly restructured, and in this transition the role of internationalism changed tremendously. Transnational circulation became a major part of research training. This article examines the conditions of possibility for this transformation, by focusing on the case of the summer school for theoretical physics created in 1951 by the young Cécile Morette (1922–2017), just in front of Mont Blanc, at Les Houches. First I show that ultimately it was only thanks to extremely specific and intertwined social positions and dispositions, in terms of class and gender (derived from her socialization as an expected dame de la bourgeoisie), and through the interactions between such social attributes and a dramatic life event, that Morette managed to gather a network diverse, powerful and transnational enough to create this institution. Then, following the first years of this school, I show how it became an international model, paving the way to new articulations between the local, the national and the global scales, even beyond the Cold War oppositions.\n\n6 Fox, Robert, Science without Frontiers: Cosmopolitanism and National Interests in the World of Learning, 1870–1940, Corvallis: Oregon State University, 2016, pp. 81–92Google Scholar. The interwar confinement was described, for physics, by Pestre, Dominique, Physique et physiciens en France, 1918–1940, Paris: Editions des archives contemporaines, 1994Google Scholar.

On the social complexities of being two scientists in a couple, especially when the ‘two-body problem’ is an everlasting issue, and the fact that the women in such partnerships have historically borne the brunt of society's asymmetric evaluation of gender, see Pycior, Helena, Slack, Nancy and Abir-Am, Pnina (eds.), Creative Couples in the Sciences, New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1996Google Scholar; Lykknes, Annette, Opitz, Donald L. and van Tiggelen, Brigitte (eds.), For Better or for Worse?

(22). There is no denying that something exists like a Les Houches mythology, consciously built by Morette herself; François David's book, edited for the fiftieth birthday of the school, may be considered its legendarium. But such a topic is beyond the scope of this paper: I will limit myself to pointing out that many analyses developed by Pnina Abir-Am about the collective memory of science could be transposed to this case.
