        "text": "Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys (Advanced book classics)\n\n( Drawn from the author’s introductory course at the Univ...)\n\nDrawn from the author’s introductory course at the University of Orsay, Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys is intended to explain the basic knowledge of superconductivity for both experimentalists and theoreticians. These notes begin with an elementary discussion of magnetic properties of Type I and Type II superconductors. The microscopic theory is then built up in the Bogolubov language of self-consistent fields. This text provides the classic, fundamental basis for any work in the field of superconductivity.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201510073/?tag=2022091-20\n\nPetit Point: A Candid Portrait on the Aberrations of Science\n\n(In this fascinating book, Nobel Prize winner Pierre-Gille...)\n\nIn this fascinating book, Nobel Prize winner Pierre-Gilles de Gennes wittily captures the lives of personalities from both the academic and the industrial world in delightful bite-size stories. Most of the characters in this collection are like those in Aesop's fables, but in modern-day research settings. The book provides a critical account of aberrations (fortunately rare) of the scientific community. Many lessons can be drawn from the stories. For the young researcher, this book is like a telescope: for seeing other human beings beyond his or her laboratory. For the administrator, this book is like a microscope: for seeing inside the human beings huge and complex structures. However, like Aesop's fables, you would not offer the book as a gift to anyone other than a close and wise friend. Petit Point is not a book to be devoured in a single sitting. It is one to be savored and reflected upon -- it shows what the world may be like and what we ourselves may become. It is like a mirror -- to be visited from time to time.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9812560114/?tag=2022091-20\n\nThe Physics of Liquid Crystals (The International Series of Monographs on Physics)\n\n(This new edition of the classic text incorporates the man...)\n\nThis new edition of the classic text incorporates the many advances in knowledge about liquid crystals that have taken place since its initial publication in 1974. Entirely new chapters describe the types and properties of liquid crystals in terms of both recently discovered phases and current insight into the nature of local order and isotropic-to-nematic transition. There is an extensive discussion of the symmetrical, macroscopic, dynamic, and defective properties of smectics and columnar phases, with emphasis on order-of-magnitude considerations, all illustrated with numerous descriptions of experimental arrangements. The final chapter is devoted to phase transitions in smectics, including the celebrated analogy between smectic A and superconductors. This new version's topicality and breadth of coverage will ensure that it remains an indispensable guide for researchers and graduate students in mechanics and engineering, and in chemical, solid state, and statistical physics.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198517858/?tag=2022091-20\n\nScaling Concepts in Polymer Physics\n\n(The first stage of the physics of long, flexible chains w...)\n\nThe first stage of the physics of long, flexible chains was pioneered by eminent scientists such as Debye, Kuhn, Kramers, and Flory, who formulated the basic ideas. In recent years, because of the availability of new experimental and theoretical tools, a second stage of the physics of polymers has evolved. In this book, a noted physicist explains the radical changes that have taken place in this exciting and rapidly developing field.Pierre-Gilles de Gennes points out the three developments that have been essential for recent advances in the study of large-scale conformations and motions of flexible polymers in solutions and melts. They are the advent of neutron-scattering experiments on selectively deuterated molecules; the availability of inelastic scattering of laser light, which allows us to study the cooperative motions of the chains; and the discovery of an important relationship between polymer statistics and critical phenomena, leading to many simple scaling laws.Until now, information relating to these advances has not been readily accessible to physical chemists and polymer scientists because of the difficulties in the new theoretical language that has come into use. Professor de Gennes bridges this gap by presenting scaling concepts in terms that will be understandable to students in chemistry and engineering as well as in physics.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080141203X/?tag=2022091-20\n\nSimple Views on Condensed Matter (Series in Modern Condensed Matter Physics)\n\n(The works of the 1991 Nobel prize winner in physics, Pier...)\n\nThe works of the 1991 Nobel prize winner in physics, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, have transformed condensed matter physics. Over the last three decades, he has left his indelible mark on an astonishing variety of condensed matter topics - magnets, superconductors, liquid crystals, polymers, interfaces, wetting and adhesions, and chirality. In doing so, he has bridged the gap between solid state physics and physical chemistry, and has forged close links between experimentalists and theoreticians. In awarding him the 1991 Nobel prize for his theoretical studies on liquid crystals and polymers, the Nobel foundation has paid tribute to his undoubted genius in discovering mathematical simplicity and elegance in the most complex and \"messy\" of systems. His deep insights into these fields have enabled others to exploit liquid crystals in technology and have paved the way for physicists to work on polymers. This book presents a personal selection of the major works of de Gennes. It comes complete with afterthoughts by the author on his main papers, explaining their successes or weaknesses, and the current views on each special problem. This collector's volume contains all the important works of de Gennes which have made a lasting impact on our understanding of condensed matter, and serves as a reference book for all condensed matter physicists and physical chemists. It also bears testimony to the genius of a remarkable man.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/981020910X/?tag=2022091-20"
