        "text": "For the film released in 2004, see Grande École (film).\n\nA grande école (French: [ɡʁɑ̃d ekɔl]; lit. 'great school') is a specialized top-level educational institution in France and some other previous French colonies such as Morocco and Tunisia. Grandes écoles are part of an alternative educational system that operates alongside the mainstream French public university system, and take the shape of institutes dedicated to teaching, research and professional training in either pure natural and social sciences, or applied sciences such as engineering, architecture, business administration, or public policy and administration.[1][2]\n\nGrandes écoles primarily admit students based on their national ranking in written and oral exams called concours, which are organized annually by the French Ministry of Education.[3] While anyone can register for concours, successful candidates have almost always completed two or three years of dedicated preparatory classes (classes préparatoires) prior to admission.[4][5] As they are separate from universities, most of them do not deliver the undergraduate degree of the diplôme de licence but deliver master's grande école degrees.[6] Admission to the grandes écoles is extremely selective.[7][8][9]"
