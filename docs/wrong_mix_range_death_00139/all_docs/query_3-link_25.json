        "text": "Pakistan's former Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, has been hanged in spite of international calls for clemency.\n\nMr Bhutto, 51, who had been Pakistan's leader since 1973, was deposed in an army coup 18 months ago.\n\nHe was sentenced to death for the murder of a political opponent following a trial which was widely condemned as unfair.\n\nThe appeal process was also tainted by allegations of bias on the part of some judges.\n\nNo advance warning of the execution had been given.\n\nMr Bhutto's wife and daughter, Benazir, who are both under house arrest, visited him on the morning before his death.\n\nThey had been told it would be their last meeting but the military regime, led by General Zia ul-Haq, continued to deny an execution was imminent.\n\nAutocratic leader\n\nFew details have emerged of the circumstances surrounding the hanging but it is believed to have taken place at 0200 local time (2100 GMT, 3 April) in the Rawalpindi district jail in north-east Pakistan.\n\nPakistanis learnt of Mr Bhutto's death when it was announced on state radio at 1100 local time (0600 GMT).\n\nShortly after his execution, Mr Bhutto's body was flown to his home village in the Sind province and buried in the family plot.\n\nHis wife and his daughter were not permitted to attend the funeral.\n\nAnother four men convicted with Mr Bhutto of murder remain in prison.\n\nMr Bhutto, a member of a rich and influential family, was known as an autocratic leader but was respected internationally.\n\nHis death looks set to lead to Pakistan's isolation on the world stage.\n\nThe United Nations' Secretary-General, Kurt Waldheim, said he deplored the decision by Pakistan's leaders to ignore appeals for clemency.\n\nBritish Prime Minister James Callaghan, who made a third appeal for Mr Bhutto's life only yesterday, expressed his \"deep regret\"."
