        "text": "Summary: Assuming office in wake of disastrous December 1971 War, Bhutto administration has moved energetically to restore and redirect Pakistan’s shattered foreign policy. Primary effort has been aimed at overcoming effects of war and seeking new relationship with India to replace quarter century of confrontation. Effort has been hampered by historical atmosphere of suspicion and distrust, but negotiations have made some progress over past year and may continue to do so, although at deliberate pace. Attempt to work out relationship with Bangladesh, on other hand, has been fruitless [Page 2] to date. Impasse with BDG over interlocking problems of recognition, war crimes trials, and return of POW’s remains unbroken. Renewed moves to tackle issue can be expected after March Bangladesh elections, however. Looking beyond subcontinent, Bhutto government sees China as closest friend and supporter, with Chinese influence visible in various GOP policy decisions. Pak attitude toward Soviet Union is ambivalent, with GOP interested in improving rather cool relations but indicating a considerable concern over Soviet intentions toward South Asia—especially toward sensitive Pakistani provinces of Baluchistan and north west frontier. Bhutto government has taken active interest in Pak contacts with other countries of Third World, particularly Arab and Middle East states, and has maintained existing links (including CENTO) with Iran and Turkey. Relations with Britain, clouded by GOP suspicion of UK partiality to India, are cool. Relations with neighboring Afghanistan reasonably amicable but periodically plagued by latter’s espousal of Pushtunisian issue. US considered by Bhutto government as friend second only of Chinese. Bhutto has expressed appreciation for US support in 1971 and for US economic aid. At same time, GOP not inhibited from taking positions on issues at variance with those of US, although rarely without advance consultation. Bhutto government’s present policy goals appear to include accommodation to new “realities” although not at cost of accepting Indian hegemony; maintaining close ties with China and US; and improving relations with Soviet Union to extent possible. Beyond that, Bhutto’s foreign policy can be expected to remain active in propagating “independence” of Pak position, in seeking restore Pakistan’s shattered image abroad, and of winning as many friends as possible.\n\nEnd summary."
