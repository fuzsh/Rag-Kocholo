        "text": "1. BRIEF HISTORY OF LEGEND By, ADNAN MURAD BHAYO (former Vice President) Peoples Students Federation Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science & Technology Unit, Karachi MUHTARMA BENAZIR BHUTTO\n\n2. Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was a Pakistani politician who chaired the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), a centre-left political party in Pakistan. Bhutto was the first woman elected to lead a Muslim state, having twice been Prime Minister of Pakistan (1988–1990; 1993–1996)\n\n3. Benazir Bhutto was born on June 21, 1953, at Karachi's Pinto Hospital, Pakistan. She was the eldest child of former Premier Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and and Begum Nusrat Bhutto. She had three younger siblings Murtaza, Shahnawaz and Sanam.\n\n4. Benazir went to school in Karachi through high school. She passed her O-level examinations at the age of 15. She then went on to complete her A- Levels at the Karachi Grammar School From 1969 to 1973 she attended Radcliffe College in the United States. Between 1973 and 1977 she took a wide variety of courses in international law and diplomacy, economics, philosophy and politics\n\n5. Benazir Bhutto’s father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was removed from office following a military coup in 1977 led by the then chief of army General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who imposed martial law. General Zia charged Mr. Bhutto with conspiring to murder the father of dissident politician Ahmed Raza Kasuri. Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was sentenced to death by the martial law court. After the overthrow of her father Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s government in a bloodless coup Benazir Bhutto spent 6 years in and out of house arrest as she struggled to rally political support to force Zia to drop murder charges against her father..\n\n6. In January 1984, after six years of house arrests and imprisonment, Zia succumbed to international pressure and allowed Bhutto to travel abroad for medical reasons. After undergoing a surgery she resumed her political activities and began to raise concerns about the mistreatment of political prisoners in Pakistan at the behest of Zia regime. The military dictator ignored worldwide appeals for clemency and had Zulfikar Bhutto hanged in 4 April 1979\n\n7. She came back to Pakistan to attend burial ceremony when her younger brother Shah Nawaz died under mysterious circumstances in July 1984 in Paris. She got married Asif Ali Zardari on 18 December 1987 in Karachi. The couple had three children: two daughters Bakhtawar and Asifa and a son named Bilawal.\n\n8. On 16 November 1988, in the first open election in more than a decade, Bhutto’s PPP won the largest bloc of seats in the National Assembly. Bhutto was sworn in as Prime Minister of a coalition government on December 2, becoming at age 35 the youngest person—and the first woman—to head the government of a Muslim-majority state in modern times\n\n9. Bhutto’s government was dismissed in 1990 following charges of corruption, for which she was never tried. Zia’s protégé Nawaz Sharif came to power after the October 1990 elections. She served as leader of the opposition while Sharif served as Prime Minister for the next three years. In October 1993 elections were held again and her PPP coalition was victorious, returning Bhutto to office and allowing her to continue her reform initiatives. In 1996, amidst various corruption scandals Bhutto was dismissed by then-president Farooq Leghari, who used the Eighth Amendment discretionary powers to dissolve the government\n\n10. After her defeat in the general elections of 1997, Benazir, along with her children, moved to Dubai because of a voluntary exile in the year 1999. She again returned to Pakistan after almost 9 years in 2007 during the time when General Pervez Musharraf was present. The only reason she agreed to return was that all the allegations that she were facing had been removed through a controversial presidential order under the name of NRO – National Reconciliation Ordinance.\n\n11. Arriving back to Pakistan was indeed a huge threat to her life but nevertheless she returned to the delight of millions of PPP supporters and fans. Her core reason to return was her wish to participate in the upcoming general elections of 2008.\n\n12. She landed on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport on 18 October 2007 and was welcomed by thousands of supporters. Sadly on her way to Bilawal House her processiontwo-suicide bombers blew themselves resulting in over hundred deaths and leaving around 450 people injured. Benazir remained unharmed as she as at that time was resting inside a bulletproof vehicle.\n\n13. Benazir Bhutto was assassinated on the 27 of December 2007 while she was departing from an election rally that was held at the Liaquat National Bagh in the city of Rawalpindi. The incident occurred when she lifted herself out of her bulletproofvehicle in order to gesticulate to her fans and well wishers. As her head came into view an unknown person fired multiple shots, aiming at her head. At that moment explosions were also ignited resulting in the deaths of nearly 20 people including three security personals. Unfortunately she was significantly injured and was immediately rushed to the Rawalpindi General Hospital she died during treatment.\n\n14. Her death shocked millions of her supporters worldwide and caused protests all through the country"
