        "text": "The Arthur Franklin Raper papers offer detailed documentation of Raper's activities, interests, and reflections. The earliest papers are drawings by Raper, which are followed by essays written while he was attending the University of North Carolina and Vanderbilt University. While Raper was working both with the Commission on Interracial Cooperation and with the Southern Commission on the Study of Lynching, he gathered information, such as statistical analyses, clippings, and case studies, from cities and towns throughout the South on the problem of lynching and other, more subtle, forms of racial intimidation. These materials are included among the 1920s-1930s papers.\n\nIn addition to the correspondence and materials on lynching, the papers from 1925 to 1942 also include a number of clippings on rural poverty; audiotapes; speeches and essays by Raper; Race and Class Pressures, Raper's monograph for the Carnegie-Myrdal Study of the American Negro; and reviews and correspondence about his first four books: The Tragedy of Lynching (1933); Preface to Peasantry (1936); Sharecroppers All (1941); and Tenants of the Almighty (1943). Of special interest is data on counties and towns throughout the South, which was compiled by Raper and Ralph Bunche for the Carnegie-Myrdal Study of the American Negro, 1939-1940. In addition, photographs made by the Farm Security Administration (some of which appeared in Raper's books) highlight the rural poverty of the depression-ridden South.\n\nRaper moved from Greene County, Ga., to Washington, D.C., in 1942, and his papers subsequently broadened in scope. Working for the United States Department of Agriculture, he collected a variety of field notes on various locales across the country. The fruits of some of this labor can be found in Rural Life in the United States (1949) and Guide to Agriculture, U.S.A. (1951), both of which are documented in the papers, although not as extensively as his first four books. As his interests shifted to the problem of worldwide rural development, Raper continued to make speeches and write essays, copies of which are included in his papers.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Raper started making trips abroad as a consultant for various government agencies, and the papers contain a great deal of information on aiding and implementing post-war development programs in foreign countries. Between 1947 and 1964, Raper's papers include correspondence; extensive field notes he made on Japan and Taiwan; reports and statistical analyses of a number of countries in Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East; orientation materials, including pamphlets, tapes, and slides for employees working abroad for the United States government; and a great number of photographs and slides depicting scenes and patterns of life in foreign countries. There is also extensive documentation of the Comilla Project, a rural development project on which Raper devoted two years working with the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development.\n\nRaper returned to the United States in 1964 to close out his career at Michigan State University, but his papers continue, uninterrupted, until his death in 1979. These later papers include correspondence; further materials on the Comilla Project, including the publication of Rural Development in Action: The Comprehensive Experiment at Comilla, East Pakistan (1970); accounts of public appearances by Raper; oral history interviews; correspondence, minutes, and printed materials relating to Raper's involvement in the National Sharecroppers' Fund and the Southern Regional Council; Raper's reflections on a variety of issues; and more photographs and tapes. Among the papers from Raper's last years are newspaper and magazine clippings (many with his annotations) which pertain to civil rights, American political developments, difficulties of Third World nations, and problems of modern technology.\n\nProcessing Note: From the time Arthur Raper began his public career, he carefully collected and arranged his own papers, and the ordering scheme which Raper established has been retained. Raper's organizing system divides the entire collection of papers into four parts: one set of chronological files, which comprises the core of the collection and includes writings, correspondence, photographs, audiovisual materials, and other items; and three sets of support files, which include clippings, correspondence, photographs, and other materials that supplement the chronological files for the corresponding years. Each of the four sets of files is divided into a number of \"volumes,\" Raper having originally housed his papers in three-ring binders. For preservation purposes, the papers have been moved from Raper's binders to archival folders. Therefore, Raper's volume numbers have been keyed to folder numbers in this finding aid. Raper also created a 557-page index to the collection, which essentially functions as a chronological, item-level contents list of the papers. A bound paper copy of this index is available for use in the Southern Historical Collection research room. There is also a microfilm copy.\n\nBack to Top"
