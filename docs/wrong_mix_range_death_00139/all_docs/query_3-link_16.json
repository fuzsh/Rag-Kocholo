        "text": "ISLAMABAD: Proceedings from Pakistan’s Supreme Court were broadcast live on Tuesday for only the second time in the country’s history, as top judges heard a history-making reference seeking to revisit the murder trial of former Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the death sentence awarded him over four decades ago.\n\nBhutto, the charismatic and Western-educated founder of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), was hanged on April 4, 1979, at Rawalpindi District Jail after being convicted of conspiring to murder a political opponent. He served as Pakistan’s fourth president from 1971 to 1973 and as the ninth prime minister from 1973 to 1977 before being ousted in a military coup led by General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq on July 5, 1977, following an election he was accused of rigging.\n\nBhutto’s hanging is the only instance in Pakistan when a former prime minister was executed and the guilty verdict is still considered one of the most controversial milestones in the nation’s political history. Bhutto’s family and political supporters allege the judges came under pressure from Zia to sentence Bhutto to death. Before his hanging, Bhutto was first declared guilty in 1978 by the Lahore High Court. His appeal in the Supreme Court was then dismissed with a 4-3 verdict.\n\nFormer President Asif Ali Zardari, who is Bhutto’s son in law, filed the presidential reference in 2011 when the PPP was in power, citing Article 186 (1 and 2) of the Constitution, which empowers the president to refer a question of public importance to the Supreme Court to seek its opinion or interpretation. Only six hearings were conducted, the last of which took place in November 2012, until the Supreme Court said last week it would begin rehearing the reference from Dec. 12.\n\n“I must regret on behalf of the Supreme Court that it [case] was not listed earlier because we have a policy now of first in first out unless there is some urgency in a particular case,” Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa remarked as a nine-member bench heard the case.\n\nJustice Mansoor Ali Shah, a member of the bench, raised questions over the maintainability of the case, saying the Supreme Court had upheld the Lahore High Court’s death sentence and a review petition was also rejected in the case.\n\n“The attorney-general should satisfy us on the maintainability of this reference,” Shah said, saying there was no room for a second review of a judgment under the law. “We cannot touch the judgment that had attained finality.”\n\nThe court wad informed that a majority of amici curiae, or impartial advisers, appointed in the past to assist the court in the case had passed away. The court appointed around a dozen new amici curiae to seek their assistance and legal submission in the case.\n\nThe court also allowed the legal heirs of Bhutto to appoint their counsels if they wanted to. The case was adjourned until the second week of January, with the court hinting that it might conduct daily hearings once proceedings restarted.\n\nTuesday’s session was attended by Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who is the late PM’s grandson, former president Zardari and other senior leaders of the PPP party.\n\nAfter the guilty verdicts by the Lahore and Supreme Courts, the decision to hang Bhutto was made by General Zia despite a flood of petitions for executive clemency from dozens of world leaders, including US President Jimmy Carter, Russia’s Leonid I. Brezhnev, Chinese PM Hua Guofeng and Pope John Paul II, besides thousands of Bhutto’s Pakistani supporters.\n\nLegal experts have for years questioned the trial both in the Lahore High Court and the Supreme Court, and raised questions on the conduct and procedure of the hearings, as well as on the fact that they took place while Pakistan was under military rule. Analysts argue this is the reason Bhutto’s death penalty judgment has never been cited as a precedent in any subsequent case in Pakistan’s judicial history.\n\nTalking to the media after the hearing, Bilawal said he hoped the court would dispense justice after decades of his grandfather’s “judicial murder.”\n\n“The court has decided to restore the nation’s trust in the institution,” he said.\n\n“Let’s hope the honorable judges cast out the shame,” he adding, urging the court to undo the “grievous wrong” of the past.\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s permanent ambassador to the United Nations on Wednesday called on the international community to join hands to conserve the South Asian country’s national animal Markhor, given the important role it plays in the overall ecosystem.\n\nThe Markhor is a large, wild goat with distinctive spiral horns found in the mountainous regions of Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. They are usually found at heights of 8,000-11,000 feet, but during the winter months, descend to between 5,000-6,000 feet.\n\nMarkhors are hunted for sport in Pakistan’s mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan region, where its hunting license fee is one the highest in the world.\n\n“Pakistan has urged the world community to espouse collaborative efforts for the conservation of the Markhor,” the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) said. Pakistan’s envoy to the UN, Munir Akram, said the animal holds special significance for Pakistan considering it is the country’s national animal.\n\nAkram was speaking at a UN side event organized by the Tajikistan Mission to the UN. The event was held in collaboration with the UN Environment Programme and International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\n“Markhors offer a significant opportunity to bolster the economy, foster conservation efforts and promote sustainable tourism and economic growth,” Akram was quoted as saying by the APP.\n\nHe noted that while the population of Markhors was declining globally, in Pakistan the animal was increasing steadily due to the government’s proactive conservation programs and community engagement policies.\n\nHe said currently, there were somewhere between 3,500 to 5,000 markhors in Pakistan.\n\n“In Pakistan’s experience, strengthening community governance structures and promoting local ownership over sustainable natural resource use is a crucial first step to building more capacity for wildlife management activities,” Akram said.\n\nHe pointed out that under Pakistan’s trophy hunting policy, local communities are trained to monitor and manage Markhor populations and trophy hunts independently. These communities retain 80 percent of the trophy permit fees, creating strong incentives for conservation, leading to significant livelihood improvements and community development projects, he said.\n\nAkram noted that proceeds from the trophy hunts were also spent on enhancing Markhor breeding spaces and habitats.\n\nKARACHI: Police in Pakistan’s eastern Punjab province on Wednesday arrested a man on charges of chopping off a donkey’s legs after it strayed into his employer’s land, highlighting the latest case of animal brutality in the country.\n\nAnimal abuse in Pakistan caught the spotlight last month when a local landlord in the southern Sanghar district was accused of chopping off a camel’s leg after it strayed into his fields for grazing. The story, which triggered uproar on mainstream and social media, led to the camel being transported to an animal shelter in Karachi for treatment. Six suspects were arrested by the police. In another incident in the southern Umerkot district last month, a camel was found dead with its legs amputated.\n\nBashir Ahmed, a resident of Punjab’s Muzaffargarh city, said his donkey suffered severe leg injuries after wandering onto the property of local landlord Khalil Jatoi on Monday. Local police arrested Sajjad Hussain, Jatoi’s employee, in connection with the crime.\n\n“We have arrested Sajjad Hussain, who has been nominated in the case,” Muhammad Saleem, the investigating officer, told Arab News. “He will be produced before the court soon.”\n\nPolice filed a complaint against Hussain under Section 429 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prescribes imprisonment of up to two years, or a fine or both, for anyone who “commits mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming, or rendering useless any animal or animals.”\n\nHowever, Ahmed said the prime suspect was Jatoi, whom he said remains at large and was pressurizing him to drop the charges.\n\n“While his employee Sajjad has been arrested, Khalil Jatoi has not yet been apprehended and he is threatening me to withdraw the case,” Ahmed alleged.\n\nAhmed said he used to sell fruits and vegetables on a cart that was pushed by the donkey.\n\nArab News could not independently verify whether Ahmed had received threats or not and Jatoi could not be reached for comment. The landlord has also not been nominated in the police complaint.\n\nAs per the complaint, Ahmed found the back legs of the donkey chopped off. The complaint also mentioned an eyewitness, Azfal Hussain, who informed police that Hussain had wounded the donkey.\n\nAhmed said the animal, which was undergoing medical treatment arranged by the provincial government, was the only source of his income for a family comprising five people.\n\n“I’m hurt not only financially but emotionally as well since I’ve been caring for the donkey,” Ahmed added.\n\nPakistan’s existing animal cruelty laws, rooted in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1890, prohibit various forms of animal cruelty, including beating, overdriving, and mutilation. The legislation also prescribes penalties for breaches of these anti-cruelty provisions, which can include fines and imprisonment, though these are not always effectively enforced.\n\nAnd despite the laws, officials themselves poison hundreds of dogs yearly in an effort to curb a population of strays that attack thousands of people.\n\nPESHAWAR: The president of a 45-member committee leading a large sit-in protest in Pakistan’s northwestern Bannu on Wednesday called for a judicial inquiry to probe a shooting incident that killed at least two people in the city last week.\n\nThousands took part in a rally in Bannu last Friday to protest the government’s announcement to launch a new military operation against militants in the country. Participants of the rally demanded peace and an end to militancy in the country, which has killed thousands of people in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province and displaced hundreds of thousands.\n\nTensions flared when at least two persons were killed and more than 20 injured after gunfire triggered a stampede at the rally, prompting thousands to stage a sit-in protest that continues to date.\n\nLocal residents and some Pakistani politicians accused security forces of shooting at the rally. Pakistan’s military spokesperson earlier this week rejected the allegations at a press conference, saying that “some negative elements” had joined the march and resorted to firing, pelting stones and chanting anti-state slogans.\n\n“We demand a clear and transparent judicial inquiry through the Peshawar High Court into this incident,” Nasir Khan Bangash, president of the 45-member Bannu Aman Jirga and a senior member of the Bannu Chamber of Commerce, told Arab News.\n\nHe rejected the military spokesperson’s allegations that the government’s efforts to launch a new military operation, “Azm-e-Istehkam” or Resolve for Stability, was being politicized. Bangash said the rally’s main was to demand peace.\n\n“The protest wasn’t political. Apart from white flags, there were no other flags [of other political parties] in the peace march,” Bangash said.\n\nHe said protesters wanted police to be empowered to deal with miscreants in the province, adding that they would not accept any military operations in KP.\n\nArab News reached out to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media wing, for its reaction to Bangash’s statement but did not get a response till this report was filed.\n\n‘COMPREHENSIVE CAMPAIGN’\n\nPast military operations have displaced hundreds of thousands of people and destroyed countless lives and livelihoods in Pakistan’s KP province, sparking a civil rights movement by ethnic Pashtuns.\n\nThe Pakistan army was able to effectively dismantle the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, and kill most of its top leadership in a string of military operations from 2014 onwards in the country’s tribal areas, driving most of the fighters across the border into Afghanistan, where Islamabad says they have regrouped. Kabul denies this.\n\nIslamabad says the new surge in violence is because Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers are not doing enough against militants using its soil to launch attacks on Pakistan. Kabul says rising violence in Pakistan is a domestic issue and it does not allow militants to operate on its soil.\n\nFears of more displacement have been raised after the government announced last month it would launch the Azm-e-Istehkam operation.\n\nIn his press conference this week, military spokesman Lt. Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry clarified that the campaign was not meant to be a full-scale military operation.\n\n“This is a comprehensive campaign against terrorism, which won’t just root out terrorism but which will lift up all of society,” he said.\n\nISLAMABAD: Lawmakers belonging to former prime minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party on Wednesday continued their hunger strike to demand his release from prison, vowing to “take on” the government’s plan to ban the party.\n\nOver two dozen PTI lawmakers, including the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub, have been holding a hunger strike outside the Parliament House in Islamabad since Tuesday to press for Khan’s release from prison.\n\nKhan has been in jail since August last year, even though all four convictions handed down to him ahead of a parliamentary election in February have either been suspended or overturned.\n\nAfter being acquitted on the last of those four convictions, authorities rearrested Khan and his wife in an old corruption case on charges of selling state gifts unlawfully. He also faces an accusation of inciting his supporters to attack military installations in May last year. Khan denies all the accusations.\n\nThe hunger strike also takes place after Information Minister Ataullah Tarar announced on July 15 that the government plans to ban the PTI over the “proven” charge that the party received foreign funds from sources illegal in Pakistan, and because of rioting by its supporters last year that targeted military installations.\n\n“I think that we have to just laugh it off,” Ayub told Arab News from the PTI’s hunger strike camp, reacting to the government’s announcement to ban the party.\n\nHe was sitting with other lawmakers of the party who held Khan’s portraits and placards inscribed with the words “Release Imran Khan.”\n\n“They [the government] can’t beat us in the political arena, so they have resorted to this,” Ayub added. “We will take them on.”\n\nThe government’s announcement to ban the PTI came following the Supreme Court’s recent verdict in which it accepted the PTI as a legitimate political party and awarded it reserved seats for women and minorities in parliament. The verdict was a blow to the Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government, causing it to lose its two-thirds majority in Pakistan’s parliament.\n\nAyub said the PTI had organized the hunger strike to not only demand Khan’s and his wife’s release from prison but also to protest against soaring inflation and militancy in the country.\n\n“This hunger strike is geared toward or targeted toward getting Prime Minister Imran Khan, his wife and first lady Bushra Bibi and all our politically imprisoned prisoners who were imprisoned because of their political beliefs of supporting Prime Minister Imran Khan,” he said.\n\nHe described the government as an “illegal” one, holding it responsible for rising inflation and militancy in the country. Ayub called for fresh elections to overcome these crises.\n\n“This is a token hunger strike, and we will continue this as long as is necessary,” he vowed.\n\n‘DRAMA’\n\nMeanwhile Senator Talal Chaudhry, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, described the PTI’s hunger strike as a “drama.”\n\nHe accused the PTI of always conspiring to weaken the country, saying that the party was always protesting whether through hunger strikes or “conspiracies to shut down Pakistan.”\n\n“They will not get anything through these strikes,” he said. “What sort of a hunger strike is this that it begins after lunch and ends before the evening tea?“\n\nThe rise in tensions between the government and the PTI takes place after police raided the headquarters of Khan’s party in Islamabad earlier this week.\n\nThe PTI’s senior media manager Ahmed Waqas Janjua and its information secretary Raoof Hassan were arrested by authorities on accusations they were pushing an “anti-state narrative” to undermine Pakistan’s sovereignty.\n\n“The recent crackdown is because the government has lost all, I would say, legitimacy in the eyes of the people,” Ayub said. “They don’t have anything to offer.”"
