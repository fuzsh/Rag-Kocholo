        "text": "District Jail Rawalpindi was a prominent jail in Rawalpindi, Pakistan located opposite Rawalpindi District Courts. It was established in 1882 on an area of 34.14 hectares (84.4 acres).[2] The Jail was inherited by the Punjab Prisons Department besides 18 other Jails after independence.\n\nOn 4 April 1979, the former President and Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was hanged to death in this jail.[3]\n\nIn 1986, a new Jail was constructed on Adiala Road nearly 13 kilometres away from the District Courts which was named Central Jail Rawalpindi.\n\nThe old jail was demolished in 1988 on the orders of military dictator Gen. Zia-ul-Haq and the grounds converted into Jinnah Park.\n\nSome, especially activists of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party believe that the District Jail Rawalpindi was demolished to destroy tangible reminders of Bhutto i.e. his death cell, execution gallows etc. which the Party and his children could use to gain sympathies of the world at large and to launch effective political campaign against Zia-ul-Haq.[4]\n\nThere is now a small monument marking the exact spot where the gallows Bhutto was hanged from once stood, although it is overshadowed by the McDonald's and multiplex movie theatre which share the park with amusement rides, jogging track and other sports facilities.\n\nGovernment of Punjab, Pakistan\n\nPunjab Prisons (Pakistan)\n\nCentral Jail Faisalabad\n\nCentral Jail Lahore\n\nPrison Officer\n\nHeadquarter Jail\n\nCentral Jail Rawalpindi\n\nNational Academy for Prisons Administration\n\nOfficial website of Punjab Prisons (Pakistan)\n\n]"
