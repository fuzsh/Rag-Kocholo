        "text": "Legitimizing Strategies\n\nThe two military rulers, ZR and Ershad, demonstrate Finer's hypothesis that military rulers need popular support to prolong their rules (Finer Reference Finer1997). In a referendum held on May 30, 1977, 98.88% of voters voted “yes” to the question of whether ZR should continue as President (Baxter and Rashiduzzaman Reference Baxter and Rashiduzzaman1981, 486). However, as ZR recognized that this referendum did not provide enough legitimacy to prove substantial public support, he arranged a presidential election on June 3, 1978. In this election, he contested against General Osmany, the candidate supported by the Awami League (AL); ZR secured 76.63% of votes to Osmany's 21.7% (Ibid, 486).\n\nAs Islam had been an ongoing part of nation-building processes and debates in Bangladesh (Hossain Reference Hossain2015, 381), ZR and Ershad chose to use religion instrumentally to legitimize their rule through widespread public support. ZR's reforms began with changing the constitutional identity of Bangladesh from secular to Islamic. After independence, the secular constitution under SMR (1972–1975) defined the ideological image of Bangladesh as “Bangali,” based on the ethno-linguistic secular ideology that negated the idea of a two-nation state to legitimize its separation from West Pakistan. This construction presented the “Bangali” as a “pro-liberation force” and the “Muslim Bangladeshi” as an “anti-liberation force.” However, there was a persistent misconception in Bangladesh that secularism meant either the absence of religion (atheism) or presence of Hinduism (Bhuiyan Reference Bhuiyan2017, 204–27; Yasmin Reference Yasmin2013). The day secularism was enshrined in the constitution, a public procession occurred demonstrating against the addition with the slogan “Joy Bangla joy-heen, Lungi chere dhutipin.” This slogan asserted that the historical AL slogan of Joy Bangla (victory to Bangladesh) had turned meaningless in independent Bangladesh and that Bangladesh would be free of “victory” and, because of the adoption of secularism, the historical “lungi” donned by Bengali Muslim men would be substituted with “dhuti,” the traditional dress of Hindu men (Ibid). The government created the image of the religion-driven “Muslim Bangladeshi” as the representative of the “other” (Two-Nation Theory holder) identity, by saying that they belong to the identity of Islamic Pakistan. However, “Muslim Bangladeshis” had enough space to represent its distinct Muslim political and societal identity in Bangladesh. According to Riaz (Reference Riaz2018, 305), “Since the beginning of the expansion of Islam in Bengal variations in interpretations of religion and rituals have become embedded into the ethos of its adherents; this remains the mainstay of Islam in Bangladesh.” This Islam-oriented identity was socially strong enough to shape citizens' perceptions and affect political debate in Bangladesh after 1975 (Khan Reference Khan1985, 834–51; Ahamed and Nazneen Reference Ahamed and Nazneen1990, 795–808). ZR capitalized on this to construct the ethos and values of Bangladesh based on the perception of division between Hindu and Muslim culture, in line with the Two-Nation Theory (Mannan Reference Mannan2015) to gain domestic political acceptance and to legitimate his rule. He promoted and patronized the Muslim Bangladeshi and created the image of the ethnic and secular-driven Bengali identity, representative of the “other” (Hindu) identity, saying that they belonged to the identity of Hindu India or secular India (Brasted Reference Brasted, Lahoud and Johns2012, 116). ZR was determined to amend the constitution.\n\nWith the Proclamation (Amendment) Order, 1977, ZR inserted Islamic elements into the preamble of the constitution. The words “Bismillah-ar-Rahman-ar-Rahim” (In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful) were added to the start of the constitution. Article 6 was modified, now declaring that “citizens of Bangladesh shall be known as Bangladeshi.”Footnote 2 Article 8 declared (1) “The principles of absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah, nationalism, democracy and socialism meaning economic and social justice, together with the principles derived from them as set out in this Part, shall constitute the fundamental principles of state policy.”Footnote 3 Article 8(1A) also states that “Absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah shall be the basis of all actions.”Footnote 4 ZR also had abolished the erstwhile article 12 (regarding secularism) and article 25 was modified with the insertion that the State shall endeavor to consolidate, preserve, and strengthen fraternal relationships among Muslim countries based on Islamic solidarity.Footnote 5 Moreover, article 38 of 1972s constitution was modified to omit: “Provided that no person shall have the right to form, or be a member or otherwise take part in the activities of, any communal or other association or union which in the name or on the basis of any religion has for its object, or pursues, a political purpose.” With this, ZR legalized the use of Islam for political purposes and his proclamations were assured by the fifth amendment of the constitution in 1979, thus diluting the secular identity of the constitution. ZR created a domestic fear of the secular Bengali, aiming to transform Bangladesh identity from ethno-linguistic Bengali culture and secular polity to religio-cultural Muslim Bangladeshi identity and Islamic polity. According to Bhardwaj, for countering secularism, ZR criticized SMR for making Bangladesh into a satellite state of Hindu India (Bhardwaj Reference Bhardwaj2011, 18).\n\nThe trend of using Islam as a tool was continued under Ershad. He made the eighth amendment of the constitution in 1988, inserting article 2A, which stated “the state religion of the Republic is Islam but other religions may be practiced and harmony in the Republic.”Footnote 6 ZR started to Islamize the constitution but Ershad changed the constitutional identity from secular to Islamic by inserting Islam as the state religion of Bangladesh. The aim of this amendment was to revive the Islamic ontological reality and patronize the “Muslim Bangladeshi” group that would help to sustain the public support the military authoritarian regime. It created a space to reorient the use of Islam for political purposes. Uddin sees the significant changes under ZR as reviving an Islamic-oriented Bangladeshi nationalism to gain the support of religious and conservative parties (Uddin Reference Uddin2006, 131); Ershad continued this trend.\n\nTo achieve his political ambitions, ZR gradually developed a political party that provided a much better platform to promote Islamic symbolism and Bangladeshi nationalism. A “political front,” a civil–military alliance was formed on December 15, 1977 and later it became Jatiyobadi front,Footnote 7 a nationalist alliance to merge all recognized political parties (Mishra Reference Mishra1981, 522–46). On September 1, 1978, ZR attempted to form a political party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), by uniting the Jatiyotabadi Gonotantrik Dal (Nationalist Democratic Party), National Awami Party (B), and the United People's Party, Muslim League and the Minority Party. However, at the initial stage, the BNP had no grassroots base and no internal democracy. To establish a grassroots base, ZR used the Bangladeshi nationalist flag, adding Islamic color to promote the party's ideology and draw in a support base to prolong his authoritarian rule (Ibid, 338–39). He successfully used Islamic symbolism for his political gain. Many members of left-leaning political parties with links to China and anti-India sentiment joined the BNP (Hossain Reference Hossain2015, 381). Although ZR promulgated the Political Parties Regulation, 1976 for the reintroduction of the multi-party system he simultaneously rehabilitated the pro-Islamic political parties that were banned during the erstwhile AL regime (Bhattacharya Reference Bhattacharya1999, 196).\n\nAfter assuming power in 1982, Ershad maintained this party-army type military regime until 1986. Initially, his intention was to legitimize his military rule through civilianizing the government (Sen Reference Sen and Chakravarty1994, 122). However, rather than rejecting the existing ideological and political structure, he chose to continue ZR's policy and relied on support from religious and conservative parties (Uddin Reference Uddin2006, 138). He continued to proliferate Bangladeshi nationalism with an emphasis on Islamic identity. After 18 months of party-type military rule, he began establishing a ruler-type military rule. On November 27, 1983, Janadal was formed with Ershad's support. Later, members of Janadal, Muslim League, Ganatantri Dal, and United People Party along with members of the BNP, including Shah Azizur Rahman, formed the Jatiya Party and Ershad became party president. However, it was very difficult for him to establish a ruler-type of military regime, as the dominance of two major political parties, AL and BNP, thwarted his parliamentary aspiration (Abhilash Reference Abhilash2012, 91). Ershad therefore focused more on Islamic elements in his politics, including through declaring Islam the Bangladesh's state religion.\n\nAs Lewis (Reference Lewis1988), Savory (Reference Savory and Bosworth1989), and Smith (Reference Smith1970) show, Islam has tended to motivate people to forgo their critical thinking and right to rebellion and to teach them to embrace obedience toward the ruler(s) and accept authoritarianism. With this view, both ZR and Ershad domesticated Islamic ideology. They thought that an imagined Islam-oriented “Muslim Bangladeshi” identity could be appropriated by its citizen at the societal and individual levels through the domestication process. State identity became integrated into everyday life, in the belief that this would create a congenial environment for adopting this identity. Symbolic measures were taken to promote Islamic identity, for example, Qur'anic verses and the Prophet's advice were displayed on posters hanging in government offices, officials patronized religious occasions like Eid-e-Milad un-Nabi, Muharram, Shab-i-Barat, and azan (call to prayer) and principles of Shariah were to telecast on radio and television (Ahamed and Nazneen Reference Ahamed and Nazneen1990, 795–808). The government's Cabinet created a new division for religious affairs. The Islamic Academy was transformed into the Islamic Foundation with extensive research facilities (Ibid). A new Islamic University was established with financial support from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Ershad continued domesticating anti-Islamic identity fear; he continued to strengthen Islamic identity. He established a Zakat fund and promoted Islamic learning, introducing Islamiat (Islamic studies) into the curricula from grade one (Ibid). He frequently visited mosques and Islamic shrines, met imams (Islamic religious leader) and peers (Sufi masters or spiritual guides), and allocated liberal grants to these religious institutions (Ibid). After a meeting with Jamiat-ul-Muderressin on January 10, 1988, Ershad stated that Islamic principles would be the base of cultural life in Bangladesh.\n\nAlongside these domestic activities, ZR and Ershad reoriented Bangladesh's foreign policy to gain political acceptance and legitimacy domestically and externally. Both ZR and Ershad presented the secular Bengali identity as a pro-Indian or pro-Hindu identity. This apprehension “turned into an anti-India sentiment, given the fact that Indian domination over Bangladesh…was popularly perceived as the domination of Hindu India” (Mannan Reference Mannan2015, 87). ZR began using the Islamic card to strengthen anti-Indian sentiment, which had persisted during the SMR regime. ZR portrayed Indian influence as a danger to the independence and sovereignty of Bangladesh, accusing India of sheltering pro-SMR guerrillas, known as Kader Bahini, who conducted cross-border attacks from the Indian side (Pattanaik Reference Pattanaik and Pattanaik2012, 22). On May 1, 1976, ZR said:\n\nWe do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of others. Likewise, we want that no other country will interfere in the internal affairs of Bangladesh…. If there is aggression on us to seven and half-crore people of the country will rise to one man and resist it and defend the independence (Bangladesh Observer May 2, 1976).\n\nErshad continued with anti-Indian foreign policy, supporting Pakistan's position on Kashmir. In 1990, Ershad, in a public statement, deplored the killing of Muslims in the Indian-administered Kashmir and asked India to exercise maximum restraint on the Kashmir issue (Asian Recorder 18–24 June 1990). By domesticating fear of a pro-Indian, anti-Islamic secular identity, or Hindu identity as an enemy of Bangladesh (Maniruzzaman Reference Maniruzzaman and Ahmed1990; Hashmi Reference Hashmi, Mutalib and Hashmi1994, 103–4), ZR and Ershad strengthened the Muslim societal and political identities of Bangladesh that could enhance their political acceptance at the domestic level and abroad. ZR also improved Bangladesh's relationships with Pakistan and the Muslim world (Ummah). He once claimed, “We have religious, historical and cultural relations with all the Muslim countries of the world and we want to further our relations with them” (The Bangladesh Observer May 2, 1976). Ershad continued good relationship with Pakistan and was awarded Pakistan's highest civilian award (Nishan-i-Pakistan) as a tribute to his contribution to brotherly relationships between Bangladesh and Pakistan, and his leading role in establishing the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Rizvi Reference Rizvi1993, 55). Both ZR and Ershad held up their good relationship with Pakistan and the Muslim world as a representation of the country's Islamic identity at domestic and international levels, consolidating their “political acceptance and legitimacy” at domestic and international levels. As Bhuian MD. Manohar Kabir (Reference Kabir1999, 23) explains:\n\n…they want to give the system an ideological and political institutional shape that would sustain the reproduction of the system. It is also true for various Bangladeshi military-authoritarian regimes which used religion (Islam), in their attempts for political legitimization.\n\nHowever, ZR, despite successfully gaining public support, was unable to ensure the backing of the armed forces and that is what led to his assassination. He was not able to eliminate all opposition and finally himself killed by a group of army officers (Franda Reference Franda1981, 1387). He wanted to become “a truly civilian politician” (Ibid, 1387). Ershad, on the other hand, achieved strong support from the armed forces, similar to the case of ZH of Pakistan. He prolonged his authoritarian regime by maintaining the check and balance between military officials and civil politicians.\n\nRepression and Social Control\n\nZH built on the Islamization that had been initiated during his predecessor's time as a repressive strategy, having clear elements of terror and social control. The legal changes labeled as Islamic were a clear manifestation of a mullah-military alliance in Pakistan serving the military regime's desire to maintain its power by pleasing right-wing Islamists, such as the Jamaat-e-Islami. The Islamists had long been calling for the implementation of a strict form of sharia in Pakistan, and an alliance with ZH provided them with a clear opening to achieve some of their goals.\n\nThe mullah-military alliance under ZH led to legal changes aimed at transforming Pakistan into a theocratic state. The ZH regime used all possible means, such as the media and education, to spread Islamization. Shahid Javed Burki argues that “with the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism … this art form [television drama] was to suffer a serious setback” (Reference Burki1986, 33). The state-run television channel (PTV) was used for spreading both political and religious messages and then; the Ministry of Information directed PTV's female newscasters to appear on TV with dupatta (scarf) covering their heads and without make-up. These conservative practices were not only enforced on media professionals but dress codes were implemented for public personalities and other women and girls, for example women working in government institutions were required to wear dupatta to cover their heads and female students above the age of 12 were required to wear chadors/shawls (Hashmi and Batool Reference Hashmi, Batool, Perera and Pathak2019, 80). To popularize these legal and social changes, the idea of “chaadar and chardiwari” (literal translation: the veil and the four walls) was promoted to justify that women's place was in the home (Qadeer Reference Qadeer1997, 751). Beyond dress code, sharia or Islamic ideas of morality were used to justify restrictions on music, dancing and red-light areas, such as the Heera Mandi in Lahore (Hussain Reference Hussain2007).\n\nFrom the very beginning, the ZH regime had made it clear that there would be strict punishment for anyone who was critical of the government. The direct victims of this were politicians and journalists. An early visible sign of widespread repression included political prisoners, who, according to one estimate, numbered between 300 and 500 in 1982 and who were tortured (Kaufman Reference Kaufman1982). At the time the PTV was the only TV channel and media censorship was mostly imposed on the press. “If you did not heed warnings, you faced imprisonment or the possibility that your publication would be shut down” (Aslam and Ali Reference Aslam and Ali2009, 32).\n\nAnother strategy was to use Islamization as a tool for social transformation, which ZH believed was necessary to find the social evils facing Pakistan. Under General ZH, Islamization led to promulgation of Islamic laws in the country which continues to have implications for the present day Pakistan. In 1980, Islamabad was site of the first demonstration by Shias against the implementation of the ZH's Zakat and Ushr Ordinance (Warde Reference Warde2010, 116). Shias demanded exemption from paying Zakat Footnote 9 to the state and the government had to agree (Iqbal Reference Iqbal2014). According to Mukhtar Ahmad Ali (Reference Ali2000, 33), the successful protests in Islamabad became a factor in deteriorating Shia–Sunni relationships in Jhang—presently a hotspot of sectarian violence—where both communities had lived side by side for generations. Ahmadiyah, who were already declared non-Muslim during Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's era, were now faced with more restrictions, for example, the ZH government had prohibited the Ahmadiyas from calling their prayer places mosques and from possessing and reading the Qur'an as well as from using Muslims ways of greeting (Rehman Reference Rehman2017). While ZH was inspired by the religious values of Saudi Arabia, Pakistan was undergoing structural changes due to its strategic partnership with the United States and Saudi Arabia for so-called jihad against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) were at forefront of jihad and Islamization at home and abroad (Afghanistan) for Pakistan's political ambitions (Ahmed Reference Ahmed and Muehlenbeck2012, 275–98).\n\nZH's legal reforms under Shariah were aimed at enhancing his support from Islamists. This, in a way, served the purpose of what scholars argue to be a key goal of authoritarian regimes implementing Shariah, “to teach people to embrace obedience towards… authoritarianism” (Smith Reference Smith1970; Lewis Reference Lewis1988, 821–44). Soon after taking control of the country, ZH embarked on his Islamization mission and labeled it a pre-condition for democracy in Pakistan (Kanwal Reference Kanwal2015, 46). Burki argues that under ZH's “tutelage, a comprehensive effort was commenced at the grassroots level (the education system) via madrassas/madaris (religious schools) and a revamping of the curriculum of government schools, to indoctrinate future generations to view the imposition of strict Shariah laws” (Burki Reference Burki2016, 116). These strict Shariah laws included the Zina Ordinance and the Hudood Ordinance of 1979. The military regime used the label of “Nizam-i-Mustafa/Nizam-i-Islam” (the order of the Prophet/Islamic system) to Islamize the nation. For ZH, politics and theology went hand in hand and he was therefore comfortable in his alliances with Islamists (Awan Reference Awan2016, 37). In ZH's Islamization, reform of the legal system played a central role. In 1978, he established the Shariat Appellate Benches under the country's four high courts. The benches were tasked with judging legal cases using Shariah or teaching of Quran and Sunnah. While announcing the establishment of the Shariah benches, ZH said “Every citizen will have the right to present any law enforced by the government before the ‘Sharia Bench’ and obtain its verdict whether the law is wholly or partly Islamic or un-Islamic” (Wasti Reference Wasti2009, 291). As another step in Islamizing Pakistan, ZH formulated the ninth amendment to the Pakistan Constitution. In 1980, the Shariat Appellate Benches were abolished and the Federal Shariat Court was established. ZH directly controlled the Federal Shariat Court by appointing its judges. Although supported by conservative ideals of Islam and Islamists in Pakistan, ZH's actions were not free from criticism. That is when he had to use repressive strategies. The Hudood Ordinance, in particular, led to a lot of criticism of the government and to demonstrations. Force was used to crush several of these demonstrations, including one organized by the Pakistani women's resistance movement on Pakistan's National Women's Day in 1983 in Lahore (Imran and Munir Reference Imran and Munir2018).\n\nZH effectively employed Islamization through a range of measures to secure legitimacy and stay in power. This included policy reforms and actions, and personal promotion as a devout Muslim. The educational reforms came in many shapes and sizes but the ultimate aim was Islamization that suited ZH's domestic and foreign policies. While the jihad against the Soviet suited ZH's Islamization through Saudi funding for Islamic institutions, especially madrassas, at home, Ispahani argues that “Zia carefully nurtured his image as a man of Allah, with televised attendance of prayer congregation and annual pilgrimage to Mecca” (Ispahani Reference Ispahani2017). From the very start of his administration, he promoted himself as a “solider of Islam” (Zaidi Reference Zaidi2017). He openly criticized the school textbooks and initiated their Islamization in 1979, playing into the hands of his political allies, Islamists, who were outright supporting ZH's reforms. The regime embarked on the mission of national identity formation with a key emphasis on Muslim heritage, which involved a special focus on the Muslim history of Pakistan. While history courses were revised to focus on Muslim rulers in the Indian Sub-continent, for example Muhammad bin Qasim, the government also introduced Pakistan Studies into secondary schools and universities to promote patriotism among the youth (Zahid Reference Zahid2011, 16).\n\nPenalties for the various legal reforms labeled as according with Sharia were implemented through a strict and public display of punishment. This served the dual purpose of Islamic justification for such acts and terror among the masses, especially opponents. Blasphemy laws were introduced by the ZH regime in 1985, with the death penalty given to those found guilty of insulting the Prophet Muhammad. The Hudud laws were also seen as in accordance with Islam, with strong punishments, including death sentence. In addition, judicial amputation for thefts and armed robbery and flogging for consuming alcohol were applicable across Pakistan (Franck and Nyman Reference Franck and Nyman2003, 113).\n\nLegitimizing Strategies\n\nDespite claims he would transfer power to the civilian leadership, ZH was used all possible strategies to consolidate his power. Soon after taking power on July 5, 1977, he said “that he had no political ambitions whatsoever, and that he would leave his post of Chief Martial law Administrator after three months” (Zaidi Reference Zaidi2017), but that never happened—his control lasted for around 11 years. Soon after taking power, ZH had also promised that he would restore some form of democracy “as close to Islam as possible” but in the beginning of the 1982 there were visible signs of him backing away from this stated goal of his regime and expanding his authority (Kaufman Reference Kaufman1982).\n\nA first step toward consolidating power was the presidential referendum of 1984. The referendum was not only rigged, with election staff stamping the ballot papers instead of voters, but its key “yes/no” question was very ambiguous: Do you support the process started by General Zia-ul-Haq to bring the Laws in consonance with Holy Qu'ran and Sunnah? (Kanwal Reference Kanwal2015, 45). A “yes” vote was automatically translated into support for Islamization under ZH, even with a low turnout of 10–15% (Zahid Reference Zahid2011, 18). Still, leaders from around the world congratulated ZH because many countries were happy with his full support for the Afghan–Soviet War. He then created the Majlis-i-Shoora, a sort of a non-democratically selected parliament, with his own handpicked members, including mullahs, retired generals, and technocrats. While this helped him increase his political support among Islamists, the Majlis-i-Shoora could not help him gain legitimacy. Like the dictators in the past, ZH also preferred local government through elected local bodies at district and union levels to show that he was interested in decentralizing the governance system (Ibid, 18).\n\nContradictory to what Brooker argues about non-democratic regimes seeking recognition through multiparty democracy (Brooker Reference Brooker2009, 1), ZH only tolerated general elections on a non-party basis. This is because for ZH, political parties were a major problem for Pakistan. ZH further justified his stance saying that there is no concept of political parties in Islam and that elections on a party basis would derail Islamization (Kanwal Reference Kanwal2015, 46). In the early years of his rule, ZH placed a range of restrictions on political parties with many politicians being “placed under various forms of restrictions” (Zahid Reference Zahid2011, 9). While the Pakistan Peoples Party faced the brunt of ZH's aggression, other parties became his natural allies, including the Pakistan Muslim League, and JI. It is interesting that ZH so clearly moved to the second track so long after implementing the first track of controlling the military elites. Despite his claims that he would transfer power to civilians, ZH kept postponing the elections and once said it was not “written in the Quran that elections were to be held at a given date” (Zaidi Reference Zaidi2017). The 1985 elections on a non-party basis was a step toward what Philip (Reference Philip1984, 17) calls the “second track,” an attempt to gain political acceptability for the regime. For ZH however, it was not a complete win, as almost half of his nominees from the Majlis-i-Shoora did not survive the general elections. For example, ZH's preferred party, JI, had run candidates in 63 seats of the National Assembly but won only eight of these (Kanwal Reference Kanwal2015, 47). With the constitutional reforms, ZH only shared a limited power with the democratically elected prime minister, but held the real power as both head of state and the chief of army staff. As an outcome of the 1985 elections, ZH chose Mohammad Khan Junejo of Sindh to be his subservient prime minister, but removed Junejo in 1988 when he had started to become critical of ZH's government, in particular calling an inquiry into the Ojhri Camp disaster in Rawalpindi (Zaidi Reference Zaidi2017).\n\nFrom the very start of his regime, ZH actively promoted Pakistan as an ideological/Islamic state and certain geopolitical developments served his interests. In December 1981, he said “Pakistan is like Israel, which is an ideological state. Take out the Judaism from Israel and it will fall like a house of cards. Take Islam out of Pakistan and make it a secular state; it would collapse” (Burki Reference Burki1986, 78). This served the dual purpose of pleasing Islamists at home—ZH's key supporters—and gaining international recognition at a time when Pakistan was playing a central role in the Afghan–Soviet War (Ahmed Reference Ahmed and Muehlenbeck2012). The Afghan–Soviet War played a crucial role, bringing Pakistan back into an alliance with the United States and its key allies, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Pakistan's direct involvement in the Afghan–Soviet War helped ZH get more than $7 billion in military and economic aid during 1981–1987 (Zahid Reference Zahid2011, 20). With this, he was able to fulfill his promises to modernize the armed forces and stabilize economy. For ZH, this was a stroke of luck, he was willing to use all possible means to legitimize his rule and consolidate the legitimacy of his authoritarian regime. Pakistan's involvement in the Afghan–Soviet War played a central role in the fulfillment of Philip's second track of the authoritarian regime—“the political acceptability of the regime”—in which ZH gained legitimacy at home through external recognition of his government.\n\nPakistan's alliance with the United States and key Muslim states benefitted ZH immensely in terms of legitimacy and Islamization. During the 1980s, ZH's administration obtained external legitimacy through direct alliances that led to a sudden influx of military and non-military aid to Pakistan from the United States and Saudi Arabia (Weinbaum Reference Weinbaum1991, 71–85). Beyond providing much-needed financial assistance, it also allowed ZH to strengthen support from Islamists for his government. It was a win–win scenario for Islamists, who at that point were able to achieve political power and enabled ZH to obtain stronger domestic support. In this process, ZH brought to the fore the two most prominent Islamic parties (JI and JUI), in what Zaidi (Reference Zaidi2017) has called the beginning of the “mullah–military alliance” that still continues in Pakistan. Both parties also played a leading role in the Afghan–Soviet War through the recruitment of fighters from within Pakistan, for which they were rewarded with governmental positions (Ahmed Reference Ahmed and Muehlenbeck2012, 275–98). According to a study, “Pakistan's religious parties were nourished and strengthened by [ZH]” (Ahmed and Balasubramanian Reference Ahmed and Balasubramanian2010, 93), in return ZH gained the full support of JI and JUI; for example, JI's student wing (Islami Jamiat-ul-Tulaba) became very active across the country restricting leftist student groups (CIA 1981, 7). The war in Afghanistan and mujahideen recruitment directly affected Islamization at home, for example, during that era alone more than 1,000 madrassas were opened across Pakistan.\n\nWhile domestically, ZH was successful in gaining the support of Islamists, his Islamic and pan-Islamic rhetoric was also visible in his support of the Afghan refugees coming to Pakistan. Kanwal argues, “Zia's Afghan policy received strong support from [JI, JUI] and senior officers of the armed forces” (Kanwal Reference Kanwal2015, 45). The Soviet invasion and the US–USSR proxy led to the deaths of over one million Afghans and forced the exodus of more than 6 million to nearly 100 countries, with the majority fleeing to neighboring Pakistan and Iran (Schöch Reference Schöch2008, 50; Zieck Reference Zieck2008, 253–4). Besides avoiding war and repression, the Afghans migrated because they did not want to live under the atheist government (Centlivres and Centlivres-Demont Reference Centlivres and Centlivres-Demont1988). It is important to highlight that Pakistan was a key US partner in the resistance, comprised of mujahideen (holy warriors or the ones engaged in jihad), of the Soviets, therefore, Islamabad was willing to accept a huge influx of Afghan refugees. The official records report 2.8 million Afghan refugees arrived in 1985, including many who were able to find work in Pakistan in the transport and agriculture sectors (Victor Reference Victor1986, 444). In addition to strengthening ZH's support base within the country, the policy on Afghan refugees also projected Pakistan's image as a key player in global humanitarian efforts."
