        "text": "Momoh Sekou Dudu comes from the village of Gordorlahun in north-western Liberia. The civil war of 1989 – 2003 forced him and his family into exile first, in Sierra Leone and then in the French-speaking nation of Guinea-Conakry. Momoh stayed in Guinea for six long years. While there, he worked as a refugee community leader, helping to organize and coordinate UNHCR’s periodic distributions of food rations and non-food items. Later, Momoh joined the International Rescue Committee (IRC)-sponsored refugee school system where he served as a teacher, registrar, and eventually Vice Principal at the Gueckedou Refugee High School. In the fall of 1997, Momoh won a competitive scholarship to travel to the United States to continue his college education. He graduated from Marymount Manhattan College, a small Liberal Arts school in New York City with a B.A degree (cum laude) in Business Management in 1999. Momoh went on to obtain a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A) degree with emphasis in finance from the Peter J. Tobin School of Business at Saint John’s University in Queens, New York and a PhD in Management and Public Service from Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota. Over the last decade, Momoh has been a full-time as well as adjunct faculty at several Minneapolis metro area colleges and universities including Anoka Ramsey Community College (ARCC), North Hennepin Community College (NHCC), National American University (NAU), Brown College, Minnesota School of Business at Globe University, and Cardinal Stritch University. He has also taught at Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix Online Campuses where he has facilitated classes in Economic Theory, Finance, and International Trade. He is the author of the memoir, Harrowing December: Recounting a Journey of Sorrows and Triumphs (2014); Musings of a Patriot: A Collection of Essays on Liberia (2014), the poetry collection, When the Mind Soars (2016), and the novel, Forgotten Legacy (2017).\n\nRead full bio"
