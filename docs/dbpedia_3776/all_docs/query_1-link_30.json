        "text": "Global media spaces are increasingly in a flux. This flux creates new meanings for media and communications businesses, not just in national spaces, but also in the transnational sphere. This flux and complexities are very challenging for businesses and governments. Africa comes in as one landmass naturally caught up in these complexities, despite being at the fringes of development. However, there are conscious and society oriented entrepreneurs who are decidedly addressing these complexities in the new spirit of Africapitalism. This talk will explore the journey of Channels TV as a leading media business in Africa. I will share my lessons as well and make suggestions for the ongoing transformation of Africa.\n\nProgramme\n\n17:00: Registration\n\n17.20: Welcome Address: Aidan Hetherington, Corporate Engagement Manager, University of Edinburgh Business School\n\n17.40: Opening Remarks: Professor Kenneth Amaeshi, Chair in Business and Sustainable Development and Director of the Sustainable Business Initiative\n\n18.10: Guest Lecture: John Olatchy Momoh, OON\n\n18.40: Q&A Session\n\n19.20: Networking Reception\n\n20.00: Close of Event\n\nAbout the Speakers\n\nJohn Momoh\n\nJohn Olatchy Momoh, OON, is Chairman of Channels Media Group (CMG), owners of one of Nigeria’s leading 24-hour news television stations, and a twelve-time winner of the prestigious national media prize of Best Television Station of the Year. Also Chairman of the Nigeria’s Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria (BON), and President of the Chevening Alumni Association of Nigeria (CAAN), Momoh began his illustrious broadcasting career at the state owned Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), before moving to the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA). He founded the highly rated Channels Television in 1992 after excelling as a News Anchor, Senior Reporter and Senior Producer for Nigeria’s National Radio and Television stations.\n\nA Fellow of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) and the Nigerian Institute of Journalism (NIJ), Momoh studied Mass Communication at the prestigious University of Lagos, from where he also obtained a Masters Degree in International Law and Diplomacy. He attended the Thomson Foundation in Cardiff in 1990 as a Chevening Scholar. The foundation is the world’s oldest international media development organisation and has a long history of promoting professional excellence in media worldwide. His experience on the course, among other things, helped him to grow and cultivate a strong worth ethic, while upholding the highest ideals in balanced reporting and adequately informing the viewing public. Channels TV, as a Commercial Satellite Television Station in Lagos, is presently therefore reputed for its integrity and for its objective reporting in Nigeria and across Africa. A winner of the Lagos Business School’s Distinguished Alumni Award, Momoh is also an alumnus of the Harvard Business School.\n\nProfessor Kenneth Amaeshi\n\nResearch interests"
