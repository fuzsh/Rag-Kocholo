        "text": "By Felix Khanoba\n\nThe Federal Government has announced the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Channels Television, John Momoh, as the acting chairman of the governing council of the University of Lagos (UNILAG).\n\nMr Momoh’s appointment comes on the heels of the suspension of Wale Babalakin, from the position over the leadership crisis rocking the University.\n\nThe Edo State-born Momoh is the president of the institution’s alumni association and has been a member of the council representing the association.\n\nThe appointment was conveyed in letter by the Permanent Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono and dated August 21, 2020.\n\nThe cerebral broadcaster was directed to convene an emergency meeting of the council to “consider and, if found suitable, approve the senate nomination of the acting Vice-Chancellor for University of Lagos, in line with the enabling Act.”\n\nThe letter referenced; FME/PS/606/C.I/III/129, is titled; “Emergency Meeting of the Governing Council of University of Lagos.”\n\nIt further reads in part; “You are to preside at the meeting in the absence of the substantive pro-chancellor/chairman of council who has had to recuse himself in line with the visitor’s directive.\n\n“You are to also submit a report on the decision of the council to the visitor through the honourable minister of education immediately thereafter.”\n\nThe AUTHORITY reports that UNILAG has been enmeshed in a crisis which culminated in the suspension of the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe by the Wale Babalakin-led council, a move resisted by the former, prompting the Federal Government to suspend the duo."
