        "text": "Share this story.\n\nThe quintessential image of the scholar comes to mind as one meets Mr. Imoh Edet. This, perhaps, has to do with his suave manner of speech and overall urbane disposition combined with the neo-conservative pair of eyeglasses he wears.\n\nImoh, “The Business Voice on Radio” started his broadcast career in 2007 when he joined DBN Television where he covered the Capital Market assignment. This kindled his interest in reporting the business sector.\n\nNine months after, Imoh left DBN for Business Update Newspaper as researcher/correspondent where he familiarise himself with business terms better.\n\nThe big break for Imoh, who attended the famous Igbobi College, Lagos, holds a diploma in Mass Communication from the University of Uyo and a Bachelor’s degree also in Mass Communication from the University of Nigeria (UNN) Usukka, was joining Superscreen Television in Lagos, where he worked for five and half years as anchor, deputy business editor, acting business editor, and rubbed shoulders with big names in television.\n\nFrom Superscreen, Imoh moved to Love World Plus TV, Lagos. He anchored the station’s security programme, created Global Business on Love World, sharpening his writing and presentation skills by scripting “Rhapsody of Reality” on Love World.\n\nImoh’s competence on the job was soon noticed by Cool Fm, which poached him from Love World TV in 2013.\n\n“At first, it was difficult for me to switch to radio. The radio broadcast registers and all that were different from TV, but I kept working hard at them and soon mastered them,” Imoh told The Dream Daily poolside of a popular hotel in Abuja where our conversation took place during a family outing by the Edet Family, as he played his gorgeous one-and-half old daughter, Latoya and Mrs. Edet listened in.\n\nImoh is a much-loved newscaster on 95.1 Nigeria Info, Abuja where he also presents the station’s flagship business show, “Midday Dialogue”, at the weekend.\n\n“The Business Voice on Radio” as attended several media training programmes organised by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the World Bank, the United Nations, and the USAID.\n\nBorn and brought up in Lagos, Imoh is the first of four children. As a growing boy, his role model in the media was Founder on Channels TV, Mr. John Momoh.\n\nHe loves drawing and flirted with the idea of studying Architecture, before the stronger pull of the media profession got the better of him.\n\nThe polished OAP operates a small mini studio at home where he produces jingles. He is an avid reader of business-related publications and is disturbed that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration “has not really hit the ground running as many of us expected. I hope his second, third and fourth years will be better that the first 12 months.”\n\nImoh, who loves living a quiet life and keeping a low profile, relaxes by sitting out or watching TV with his equally gentle school-teacher wife and lively daughter.\n\nHe ranks the restriction of personal thoughts on radio and television high on the downsides of being an. On a lighter note, Imoh is bemused by the incorrect assumption that OAPs have easy, direct and unfettered access to those in authority, which often make many to approach OAPs for help to get things done in government. A daughter who will be two years in October\n\nImoh’s annual personal development programme for would-be entrepreneurs, “Business Talk in Summer”, which he started in 2015, holds on Saturday, June 25 2016, in Abuja.\n\n“This year’s theme is “Entrepreneurial Spirit – Get Switched On!”, which will be developed by experts in finance and business gurus,” Imoh told The Dream Daily. “We invite young people to come with their business plans to meet bankers, investors and other entrepreneurial groups who can help them bring their business ideas to life and promote them,” the apolitical Imoh added.\n\nIf Imoh gets a N10 million windfall, what would he invest it in? “Farming,” he shot back “I’ll buy a land and start faming. You can’t really go wrong in investing in the agro-allied business if you learn the ropes because people must eat.”\n\nImoh charged President Buhari “to work towards strengthening the economy by fixing the power challenge. We need stable power supply of, say, 20 hours per day to build the real sector and maybe we need to embrace protectionism for some time, you know, shut our borders for two years to develop internal capacity.”\n\nA member of the Finance Correspondents Association of Nigeria, Imoh has found fulfilment in life as a husband, father and being an OAP, a calling he had rejected banking job offers to purse, advised youths to follow their passions with diligence and hard work, stressing that “after paying your dues, the money will come."
