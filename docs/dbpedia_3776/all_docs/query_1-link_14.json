        "text": "As john Maxwell rightly puts it, Success is the ability of individuals to reach their own goals and achieve their own purposes. Success is not just reaching a destination success is growing to reach your maximum potential and sowing seeds that benefit others.In like terms, the success story of the Nigerian reporter, John Momoh, is a somewhat intriguing one which does not only prove that nothing is impossible but also spurs youngsters to achieve more.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe entrepreneur who hails from north Ibie of Edo state, was born on 1st July 1957 into the family of Momoh Ikiebe and Asamu Omutu Momoh. He was the first born in a family of seven. He was born and brought up in Lagos where his father worked as a cook.\n\nIn an interview, Momoh talked about his rise from humble beginnings. From a Surulere apartment with his parents and seven siblings, to a radio station when he finished secondary school, and then moving on to FRCN’s VON and then onto NTA. He talked about getting a license for Channels TV, but without the money to purchase a transmitter, it couldn’t start. He talked about getting a big part of the money he needed from British High Commission and Channels TV took off.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nJohn Momoh’s educational pursuit started in Lagos where he attended St. Thomas Aquinas Primary School in Surulere, Lagos. Thereafter, he attended Baptist Academy, Lagos for his secondary education. He then moved to acquire his first bachelor’s degree in mass communication and a master’s degree in international law both from the University of Lagos (UNILAG). John Momoh received the Lagos business school’s Distinguished Alumni Award in 2013. He also has a professional Diploma from the UK’s Thomson Foundation, an Alumnus of University of Lagos, Lagos Business School, and Harvard Business School.\n\nCAREER\n\nJohn Momoh is a prominent broadcast journalist with vast industry experience. He started his career with the Ogun state radio in Abeokuta; he worked for two years. Prior to the birth of channels television, John Momoh worked as news anchor, senior reporter and senior producer for Nigerian television authority and radio Nigeria; Nigeria’s largest television and radio stations. During his days in NTA, he was known for always performing extraordinarily. He would go against the normal trend, such as speaking about government activities before any other news. On one occasion when there was a bombast in the country, the broadcaster talked about the incident first before talking about the federal government’s tour. This gave rice to comments from individuals and government officials as to his boldness and fearlessness to bluntly disobey a military government’s order.\n\nMr Momoh was not pleased with the enormity of constraints he had working with the national stations. He knew that there was more he could achieve working independently. He then resigned and applied for his television license in 1993.\n\nI reached a tipping point in my life and a place of absolute restlessness. And so, propelled by a strong urge and passion to create an innovative professional paradigm, I resigned from the NTA after fifteen years, without any tangible evidence of financial security. Nonetheless, I was convinced without any doubts that an untapped “Greenfield” opportunity with specific reference to my area of specialty, was well within grasp. With great anticipation towards achieving a fulfilling, purpose-driven life, I started a production facilities company in 1993″.\n\n–John Momoh.\n\nHe however had a challenge with money to get a transmitter and his license was to expire in a matter of months should he fail to start a broadcast.\n\nCHALLENGES\n\nSetting up CHANNELLS TV was very challenging for John. To survive, he confront political and financial battles but he kept on pushing. Just as the saying goes challenges are cartons in which opportunities are kept.\n\nWith a resolute determination to succeed; the commitment of John’s family; a loan from a local retail bank; the eventual support of a few friends, and a committed core staff of fifteen people, Channels TV began test transmission two years later within the municipality of Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nAll efforts seemed abortive at a point when no investor was ready to take the risk of investing in a free-to-air television station as it were. He also faced the challenge of powering generator sets. He said, we run a generator for the most part, so we are used to it. We have always done, ever since we started Channels. The national grid is our back-up power.\n\nBut this last time (of national fuel scarcity) it was very scary. We were still running on our reserve of petrol and some people came to our aid. We were lucky because during the crisis, if you did not have petrol you had no choice but to halt or limit operations, like some broadcasters and banking institutions did. We have three operations running from this organization, all within the same building; terrestrial television, digital television and then Channels 24 consecutively. So if the petrol shortage had lasted longer than it did, we would have been in deep crisis.\n\nAWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS"
