        "meta_description": "This project set out to answer the research question: can identification and tracking of Beneficial Ownership (BO) in Nigeria be improved to increase the likelihood of recovering the proceeds of grand corruption? Our research question necessitated an analysis of grand corruption in Nigeria and the use of beneficial ownership and Nigeria’s anti-corruption and asset recovery regime, especially its actions regarding beneficial ownership. While the Final Report (‘the Report’) does not offer a ‘silver bullet’ to the problems of grand corruption, the answer to our research question is a qualified ‘yes’.",
