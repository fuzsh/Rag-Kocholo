        "text": "About me\n\nJohn Momoh is the chairman of the Channels Media Group and chairman and CEO of Channels Television. He is a renowned broadcast journalist with a vast experience spanning almost four decades before founding Channels, John worked variously as a news anchor, senior reporter and senior producer for broadcasters National Radio and Nigerian Television Authority. In 23 years, he has gone from being a star employee to creating a multi-million-dollar media enterprise, employing over 450 staff across Nigeria and Africa, and reaching the world with the same business model that analysts predicted would fail. His vision, passion and tenacity are balanced by a willingness to re-invent and pivot where necessary.\n\n*John Momoh is an IPI member."
