Abike Dabiri on NTA Newslines, Ruth Benemesia Opia, John Momoh Ayinde Soaga and the late Tokunbo Ajayi.\n\nHere is what you may not know about him\n\nCyril Stober is a Sierra Leonean but he was born in Minna, Niger State Nigeria. He likes wearing Hausa Fulani Babaringa and Caftan dress because of the culture of where he grew up.\n\nHe attended Government Secondary School (GSS) Minna and received an A1 in English.\n\nHe started his career in broadcasting with NTA Minna. He worked with the Nigerian Television Authority for about three decades where he anchored the NTA news at 9pm.\n\nUnlike some news broadcasters in Nigeria, he was known to be himself.
