        "text": "CITATION OF JOHN MOMOH, THE 2020 DAME LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD WINNER\n\nIt is often said that some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. John Olatchy Momoh is the classic example of one who has achieved greatness. For every recognition he has gotten, he has worked hard, very hard, for it. And in that vein, it is right to say, that over the years, he has also had greatness thrust upon him.\n\nBorn to the Muslim family of Momoh Ikiebe from present day Estako East Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria, John spent his early life in Surulere, Lagos State. He later accepted Christ and converted to Christianity. This interfaith grounding probably explains his broad-mindedness to the issue of religion as more a personal choice between believers and their God, than anything to war and kill over.\n\nFrom his days at Thomas Aquinas Primary School, Surulere, he proceeded to Baptist Academy, Ikorodu Road for his secondary education. There, he showed early promise in the arts and sports. He was a good caricaturist who relished cartooning his teachers and fellow students on the blackboard. He was also a member of the school’s basketball team. His rich voice and affable nature also endeared him to many.\n\nHe later received a rich education at the University of Lagos, Akoka where he obtained a diploma and a bachelor’s degree in mass communication. Not satisfied, he also took a Master’s degree in International Law & Diplomacy. He has been conferred with honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (Honoris Causa) by Afe Babalola University Ekiti, Ekiti State; Doctor of Business Administration by Ambrose Alli University Ekpoma, Doctor of Science by Crescent University Abeokuta, Ogun State and Doctor of Philosophy by University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.\n\nMomoh’s broadcasting career kick-started with a two-year stint at the Ogun State Radio, Abeokuta. He later joined the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, FRCN, before moving on to television at the Nigerian Television Authority, NTA, where he variously worked as News Anchor, Senior Reporter and Producer.\n\nIn all these places, Momoh continued to distinguish himself, carving an endearing image of professionalism in his carriage and delivery. He was making steady progress and could have been content to continually climb the corporate ladder. However, when in 1993, the Babangida-led administration liberalized the broadcasting sector, Momoh’s entrepreneurial drive and the quest for excellence, spurred him to apply to own a station. Fortunately, that licence was granted and there began for this consummate professional, a lifetime opportunity to stamp his name on the map of broadcast journalism in Nigeria.\n\nAs chairman/CEO of Channels Television, he is supported by an array of some of the brightest and award-winning professionals in the land. Together, they have brought impactful programming, refreshing panache to what was hitherto a staid presentation style on public television. Channels Television, the vision of John and Sola Momoh, his wife and fellow broadcaster, has become a household brand, loved for its professionalism.\n\nWhilst Channels Television continues to cultivate its reputation of a professional outfit battling with the push and pull forces of the Nigerian situation, Momoh’s brilliance lends credence to the saying that the reward for hard work is more work. Industry colleagues, alumni bodies have continued to call on Momoh to lend a hand of support in the drive for meaning and added relevance. He has served as the first elected chairman of the Broadcasting Organisations of Nigeria from the private media. He is the current president of the University of Lagos Alumni Association. He is also the acting chairman of the governing council of the university. He has received the national honour of Officer of the Order of the Niger.\n\nFor lending a testament to the dignity of labour, for providing a platform for professionalism to blossom, for his daring entrepreneurial courage, for his commendable service to the media industry in the last four decades, the Trustees of the Diamond Awards of Media Excellence ardelighted to confer on John Momoh, Officer of the Order of the Niger, fellow of the Nigerian Guild of Editors, a distinguished alumnus of the Baptist Academy, and a decent human being, the 2020 Lifetime Achievement Award of the Diamond Awards for Media Excellence."
