        "text": "LAGOS – According to the dictionary, to have one’s hands in many pies is when one is doing many things at a time. This idiomatic expression applies very well to Bishop Dr Joseph Ighalo Edoro.\n\nBishop Edoro, the Founding Overseer of ‘A Touch From Heaven International Ministries’, is President of a non-governmental organisation (NGO), ‘A Touch of Love Humanitarian Foundation.’ He also runs some businesses and does not see himself as a full-time minister.\n\nThrough his church, the NGO, and his businesses, he impacts the lives of Nigerians in various ways, as he is always touched by their suffering.\n\nBishop Edoro, also an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Supernumerary Police (SPY), in an encounter with Sunday Independent, gave insight into his life, ministry and other activities.\n\nBishop Edoro said he had an interesting early life, having been born in Sabongeri in Kano, though he is from Ukpoke in Ekpoma, Edo State.\n\nHe said: “I attended Holy Cross Primary School in Benin City. I had a stint at St Paul’s Seminary in Benin City. From there, I moved to secular school. I then attended the University of Benin, where I read Sociology at the Department of Anthropology and Sociology. After that, I attended the Nigerian Institute of Journalism (NIJ) for a Diploma in Journalism.\n\nEdoro said his work experience was multi-dimensional. According to him, “I worked with Bendel State Sports Council, now Edo State Sports Council as a Clerical Officer, then earning N62. I then became the Head of Public Relations Section, then a Special Assistant in Sports and Rural Development.\n\n“I worked with Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, who later became the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman. I also handled a programme on Radio and Television. I was trained by the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), where I worked with great minds. I started with the NTA at a very early age.\n\n“I was very good at reciting poems, and became an actor. I was involved in acting and performance. My acting career spanned for several years. I featured in programmes like Hotel De Jordan. I was a newscaster. It was indeed a multi-dimensional experience.”\n\nIn his ministerial life, Bishop Edoro said: “My call to ministry was unique. I had an ardent Catholic experience. I was a Mass Server. I served under several Bishops and countless priests. I eventually left the seminary for the secular. My grandfather was an ardent and dedicated Catholic and he told me I would be a priest.\n\n“At tender age, I had learnt the Imitations of Christ. When I left the seminary, I turned into a ministry. Even though I was no longer in a seminary, I always saw myself preaching. It took the experience of the death of my wife to bring me to a point of brokenness. It brought me closer to brokenness. It brought me closer to salvation.\n\n“It shattered my entire existence. It brought me closer to salvation. It shattered my entire existence, salvation was not close to me in Benin City. Circumstances brought me to Lagos in search of joy and peace of mind. From my experience, it is always difficult to achieve salvation.\n\n“I ran into an old friend on my way to Lagos. It was like the light on the road to Damascus. I was then looking for what to do, looking for work from street to street. He asked me to meet him at TREM by Anthony. He promised to link me up with John Momoh, founder of Channel Television since I was already a broadcaster.\n\n“At TREM, I was listening to the message and met the Lord. Before the altar call was made, I was already there. The joy that greeted me was unrivalled till date.\n\n“I attended TREM briefly and attended Samuel Bible Institute, Montgomery in Yaba. In ministry, I followed due process. I did Morning Cry, returned about 9.am. After that I did Bus Evangelism. After Bus Evangelism, I went for Church service.\n\n“I started an interdenominational fellowship called Blessed Assurance. It drew people from all strata of Christianity, Catholics, Anglicans and Pentecostals. It was moulded like the Acts of Apostles. It was an awesome experience. We shared time for deliverance and ministry. Everybody shared everything we had and we supported ourselves. Everyone came for fellowship with people. We never thought of money. If you had rice, you bring. Some brought fans. We travelled from one state to the other to do family deliverance. We never asked for anything and we enjoyed the experience. All these metamorphosed into the present day, ‘A Touch From Heaven International Ministries’.”\n\nAREAS OF MINISTRY\n\nBishop Edoro stated: “My core ministerial areas are the Prophetic and Deliverance. We are blessed with the core aspects of Christianity and blessing the people. Everything Christ did in ministry, including deliverance, is what we do.”\n\nOn how his life in ministry has been, he said: “Life in ministry has been very chequered. Ministry is not rosey all the time. The rose aspect of ministry is encapsulated in the person who called you and the compelling joy that comes from it. Ministry assignment is not a call to enjoyment, but a call to suffer.\n\n“Like Christ, you carry the burdens of people. For you to pray for people, the oppressed, you carry the burden. After ministration, your life may not be different. Ministry is not the number of cars or jets you buy, but the care and joy you derive from the tribulations you encounter on your way. But, you bear all. The only joy you have is that Christ takes all.\n\n“Ministry is fruitful when the life of people is fruitful, when they can join to pay for the accommodation, when from the pulpit, you see the suffering of people and you are bothered by the challenges of people and you carry their burdens to your own detriment. You can even take your rent and pay that of a member. That is when you derive joy from ministry. Ministry is not when you put on suits that can help to put up a small business for a poor member. It is not bureaucracy.”\n\nOTHER ACTIVITIES\n\nBishop Edoro said: “My other activities are in the area of finance. This is because I have a different mentality about ministry. I do not have people’s funds to run the ministry. If I have a passion for anything, I work for it. I do not see myself as a full-time minister. I work to take care of people, take care of myself and my family. Contemporary ministry is not about money. Tithes and offerings are no longer coming with the current economy.\n\n“I am a businessman. I am a trader. I sell goods. I run a real estate firm. I sell health supplements. I sell clothes. I have a warehouse where I sell tokunbo things. I am able to feed myself and my family. I run a crowd I can take care of in ministry. I have been able to impact the life of every member and I am satisfied.\n\n“I do not have a jet and I do not want to have any. I have been taking care of a set of blind men for 18 years. I take care of their medicals and schooling. I cannot brainwash anybody. I am not a full-time pastor, but I am full-time because I have the time.”\n\nOn what keeps him going, he said: “What keeps me going is running my non-governmental organisation (NGO), ‘A Touch of Love Humanitarian Foundation’. Loving people, my community, contributing to my community keeps me going. I rebuilt a police station. It gave me joy and the police under the current Commissioner of Police in Lagos appreciated it.\n\n“I teach pro-bono in primary schools. I teach sexual education and civics. What makes me happy is helping people, the poor, the widows, the beggars. No one comes my path without being happy. This keeps me going.”\n\nOn his interest in national issues that makes him a regular commentator in national affairs, Bishop Edooro stated: “I am a Nigerian. I am a political animal. It is not being antagonistic. We have a common wellbeing. We have a commonwealth. I am just playing my role as a Nigerian. I was born on October 1.”\n\nTaking a look at Christendom today, he said: “Christendom today in Nigeria is in the hands of Nigerians. Christendom in Nigeria is highly bastardised. It has become a harrowing experience. But, I know that God will prevail. But, I see a great revival where vibrant young men will take over. The time is very close. In truth and by truth, they will do mighty things and rebuild things God wants. The Lord will break down charlatans and they will go down.”\n\nAdvising gospel ministers, he said: “Let them be truly Godly and goodly. Let them show that they are like a city on a hill that will not be hidden. They should eschew materialism and outward display of affluence, people’s money, tithes and offerings.”\n\nOn his general advice to Nigerians and the Federal Government, Bishop Edoro said: “Government should have a human face. In their laws and policies, let them know that the poor are suffering. Let them show love, godliness.et them live by example. Let Nigerians be patient. Everything will be fine.”"
