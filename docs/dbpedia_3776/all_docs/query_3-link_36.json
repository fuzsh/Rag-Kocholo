The IU African Studies Onitsha Market Literature Collection consists of nearly 200 of the titles sold in the famous Onitsha Market in Eastern Nigeria during the mid-20th century.\n\nThe index is searchable by title, and most items can be consulted in the African Studies Collection office in the Herman B Wells Library, Room E660. Instructors should contact the librarian about using the titles in their instruction."
