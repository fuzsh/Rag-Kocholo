        "text": "The Russians say that love is like the wind that one cannot see but feel. Oluwatobi, the son of media industry pioneer and mogul, John Momoh, takes this quote to heart, evidenced by his decision to get a dazzling Russian bride.\n\nThis is a happy time for the entire family of Momoh, the Chairman and CEO of Channels TV. Seeing no better opportunity to go Italian in grand style, the happy Momoh family decided to tie Oluwatobi and Elizaveta in nuptial knots at Lake Como, Italy.\n\nA union between a Nigerian and a Russian would ring the bells of celebration anywhere in the world, least of all in the romantic nation of Italy. Many Nigerian and Russian dignitaries graced the occasion. Witnessing the spirited Oluwatobi obtaining the blessing of two nations with his blushing sweetheart, the eyes and hearts of wedding guests grew brighter as the event progressed.\n\nWedding locations often symbolise the imagined worth of marital engagements. This union was no different. Lake Como is one of the most enchanting locations in Europe, consequently becoming a favourite wedding destination. With such an auspicious location, a resplendent bride, and happy guests, the Momohs had a field day.\n\nBeing the person he is, the Momoh patriarch and his charming wife, Sola, had to entertain influential bankers, politicians, and celebrities as guests. But this is nothing for the Nigerian media industry pioneer who further distinguished himself by being the biggest support for his well-trained son.\n\nUndoubtedly, Elizaveta and her relatives have come into Nigeria’s corporate royalty. One might say that she is a lucky woman, recognizing the charm of her now-husband and his family. Oluwatobi is just as fortunate to find love in his Russian girl, approved and supported by his parents."
