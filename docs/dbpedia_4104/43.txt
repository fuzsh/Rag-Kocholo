Satyajit Ray's Goopy-Bagha trilogy of films make some minor changes from the original story. The friends are called Gopinath Gyne (Goopy) and Baghanath Byne (Bagha). The instrument Bagha plays is a dhol rather than a dholak - that's a slightly different type of double-ended drum, struck with a drum-stick on one end and the hand on the other. Goopy was played by Tapen Chatterjee and Bagha was played by the popular comedian Robi Ghosh. The films were basically made keeping the young viewers in mind and are strewn with elements of comedy and hilarious scenes. This series of musical comedies is interspersed with wonderful songs, written and composed by Ray himself, and sung by Anup Ghosal. The trilogy comprises the movies: Goopy Gyne O Bagha Byne (The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha) Hirak Rajar Deshe (The Kingdom of Diamonds) Goopy Bagha Phire Elo (The Return of Goopy and Bagha)
