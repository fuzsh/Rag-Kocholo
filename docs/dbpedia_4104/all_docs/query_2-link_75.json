        "text": "Re-Reading Tejimola through Nitoo Das’s “Tejimola” and Uddipana Goswami’s “Tejimola Forever”\n\nBy Stuti Goswami\n\nAnthologized for the first time in Lakshminath Bezbaroa’s Burhi Air Sadhu (1911), this tale has continued to stir its readers over the years and evokes different interpretations. Each reading and interpretation has given rise to a different discourse and in each such discourse a different aspect of Tejimola’s story and her character has emerged.\n\nRead more\n\nWriting the Body and Experiences: Menstruation Narratives in Select Assamese Short Fiction\n\nBy Nizara Hazarika\n\nArupa Patangia Kalita has emerged as one of the prominent writers in recent years. She has drawn critical attention because of her detailed, sensitive, and realistic representation of Assamese life and culture. Her fictions, especially her short stories, explore the conflict that women undergo while fulfilling her traditional duty as a daughter, as a wife, or as a mother.\n\nRead more\n\nMusical Tales of Choices and Sacrifices: A Review of Mitra Phukan’s ‘A Full Night’s Thievery’\n\nBy Payal Jain\n\nComing from a woman writer from Northeast India, the collection comes as a breath of fresh air, for not being solely about women and other clichéd aspects, like insurgency, terrorism, and violence per se. Mitra Phukan deserves accolades for doing this offbeat job with a sense of musicality.\n\nRead more\n\nResistance and the Woman: An Analysis of Assamese Short Stories\n\nBy Abantika Dev Ray\n\nBorrowing from Edward Said’s Orientalism, one might argue that the North-East becomes the ‘Other’ and its women are little talked about, and even less written about. Since mystery is predominant in their delineation, erroneous descriptions are not uncommon, too. Because the women already belong to a colonized space and are wrongly represented, they are doubly colonized.\n\nRead more\n\nPan-Indian and Cosmopolitan Concerns in Temsula Ao’s Writing\n\nBy Devastuti Sharma\n\nThe poems of the Naga poet and writer, Temsula Ao, are quintessential examples of the ways in which women’s writings from the region transcend the genre and gain a pan-Indian and even cosmopolitan dimension.\n\nRead more\n\nWriting Conflict, Writing Gender: Looking at Two Assamese Novels\n\nBy Parvin Sultana\n\nThis piece will try to explore the engagement of two contemporary women writers of Assam with the conflict and identity politics that the state has simmered in. It will analyzet Arupa Patangia Kalita’s Felanee (2003) and Rita Choudhury’s Ei Somoy Sei Somoy (2007).\n\nRead more\n\nGuest-Editorial: Masculinities in Urban India: Of contradictions, dilemmas and uncertainties\n\nBy Madhura Lohokare\n\nAlmost three decades after liberalisation of the Indian economy, its cities also manifest this contradictory mix of entrenched inequalities and the possibility of creative contestations of the same. This issue of Café Dissensus hopes to turn our attention to the ways in which the city is relevant to how men’s gendered identities are imagined, performed, and disrupted.\n\nRead more\n\nAnxieties of “Dabanggai”: Tales from Delhi’s Urban Villages\n\nBy Sushmita Pati\n\nBaithaks have been an extremely important social marker for the Jat patriarch, signifying the luxury of not having to be employed for their sustenance. The ‘office’ was a poor replacement of that. I realised soon, that I, as an urban-looking woman researcher, could only be an uncomfortable presence in their offices; all discussions would automatically stop as I walked into many of these offices, and would not resume as long as I was in the room.\n\nRead more\n\nReclaiming “Manliness”: Reflections on growing up in Delhi\n\nBy Soheb Niazi\n\nWhile an elite school in Delhi could not always foster a dynamic subversion of gender norms, my middle class Muslim upbringing had its own nuanced set of engagements with them. At home, I was always my mother’s boy, nurtured with love and adoration into being an obedient and sensitive boy.\n\nRead more\n\nSmuggler City to Smart City: Masculine City-Making on the Urban Periphery\n\nBy Lalitha Kamath and Radhika Raj\n\nBy 2009, the transformation of both Thakur and Vasai Virar was rendered complete by the formation of the democratically elected Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation. With this, the former don became the business tycoon cum ruling patriarch and Vasai Virar was projected as the next “smart city”.\n\nRead more\n\nExclusionary Masculinities: Exploring caste, class, and gender bias in urban Indian gay men\n\nBy Vishal Tondon\n\nIn this essay, I discuss how upper and middle class urban gay masculinities in India are constructed on a model of homonormativity (modelling of gay masculinities on traditionally accepted male gender expressions), thus consolidating a certain hegemonic idea of masculinity, which suppresses masculinities and gender non-conforming identities from lower castes.\n\nRead more\n\n‘Tis Not Just a Laughing Matter: A Conversation with Chris M. Kurian\n\nBy Madhura Lohokare\n\nAs the stand-up comedy scene has literally exploded in the last few years, several male stand-up comedians have emerged as icons, which prodded our curiosity of who these men are and what kind of changes do they represent in middle class masculinity.\n\nRead more\n\nThere are Stories and then there are Stories\n\nBy By Nina Koshy and Ayona Dasgupta\n\nFor me, the most enduring image of our edit meetings every day is that of a room with glass doors with seven-eight men deciding what should go on what page. I often wonder may be this is why a story of malnourishment is often rejected for a story on prison break. A male editor once told me, “Give me crime and kuppai (garbage) and I can print your city pages.\n\nRead more"
