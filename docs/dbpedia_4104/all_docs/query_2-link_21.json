In the forest, they meet the king of ghosts, and pleased with their music, he grants them boons which change their lives forever. This enchanting story was made into a film by Satyajit Ray, which remains one of the classics of Indian cinema.\n\nArtist, musician and man of science, Upendrakishore Roychoudhury was a man of many parts. But it is for his writing for children that he is best remembered. This book is a selection of the best of his stories and the most fascinating of his characters: Tuntuni, the little bird; the clever fox; Majantali Sarkar, the cat; the intrepid Granny Hunchback, and many others.\n\nSwagata Deb’s vibrant translation brings Upendrakishore’s unique magic to a wider audience.\n\nContents"
