        "text": "This season at the magical BFI, is Satyajit Ray: The Language of Film.\n\nIt’s a thematically programmed retrospective on the Indian film pioneer Satyajit Ray, showing all 36 of his films in association with The Academy Film Archive.\n\nSpoiled for choice by BFI Southbank’s events and screenings, I went to season programmer Sangeeta Datta’s talk (The Language of Film) with fellow contributor Ziyan Zhao.\n\nDatta is a writer/director, independent filmmaker, film historian and cultural commentator.\n\nNot only is she the director of the non-profit arts company, Baithak, and Stormglass Productions, she also writes and directs for the stage, including Gitanjali 100, a tribute to Rabindranath Tagore.\n\nHer careful selection of clips from Ray’s films created a giddying experience, as though this was my first encounter with cinema (not the psychological thriller: Rugrats Go Wild).\n\nDatta has a grace reserved for true experts, who easily transfer older works to modern audiences through enthusiasm and an understanding of our shared humanity.\n\nThe details she provides make newcomers feel knowledgable while replenishing the stocks of seasoned Ray fans. She embodies the season’s accessibility without compromising complexity.\n\nAt times, she decided not to show a clip, in case the lower quality detracted from what we had just seen. If you ever wanted to get into highbrow cinema, this is an excellent chance to do so.\n\nThe following day, accompanied this time by a cocktail from BFI Southbank’s well-stocked bar, I attended her interview with Apurna Sen, “India’s greatest and longest-standing woman writer-director”.\n\nHer latest film The Rapist (2021) was screened at the BFI as part of the London Indian Film Festival this year. Of all the movie stars I’ve seen (and namedropped), Sen oozed the most charisma and pure style.\n\nShe joked about her crush on co-star Soumitra Chatterjee, who had already made his name as the Apu of The World of Apu.\n\nNot only was he newly married, he suggested (to her dismay) that Sen call him ‘kaka’ (uncle) like she did Ray and art director Bansi Chandragupta.\n\nSen made her acting debut in Ray’s 1961 adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore’s short stories, called Teen Kanya (Three Daughters).\n\nThe interview introduced a screening of The Postmaster and Samapti, which made up the international release of Teen Kanya: Two Daughters.\n\nOnce the lights started to go down, I realised Sen was two seats away as her name appear on the opening credits. That’s the BFI for you.\n\nI asked Datta what she thinks are key elements of Ray’s ‘Language of Film’.\n\n“The key elements of the new cinema are economical scripts, great attention to detail and character development, working in outdoor spaces with available light, remarkable observation and empathy of characters and their surroundings, great collaborations with art directors, cinematographers and music directors in his earlier films.\n\nLater Ray took over all of these departments himself, working in an auteur fashion. Also, the structure of choosing a chapter of larger history and placing a small human story in that context.”\n\nRay’s career spans from 1950 until his death in 1992. How did these features of his style develop throughout his career?\n\n“Most of these elements are identifiable from the early films. In the City Trilogy, particularly in Pratidwandi, he uses a different camera style and edit techniques to reflect the political turmoil of the period.\n\nIn the last trilogy, made when Ray was very ill, the films are mostly shot indoors and he relied heavily on his stable of actors. With static camera the style is much more of capturing theatre.”\n\nWhether you’re craving somewhere to start with Ray’s films, or desparate for some hidden gems, Datta, and BFI Southbank, have got you covered.\n\n“The current BFI season Santyajit Ray: The Language of Film is a major season showcasing all of his films and it is a lifetime opportunity to be able to watch the entire filmography in wonderful restored, digital prints on the big screen.\n\nI think the fantasy films Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (which has such a wonderful anti-war message) and the anti-fascist Kingdom of Diamonds are so relevant to the world we live in.\n\nThese are indeed hidden gems. As well as the documentaries, made on personalities that Ray was himself very interested in personally.\n\nAlso see how The Big City (Mahanagar) is being appreciated by a younger audience. Its Ray’s first feminist film with a wonderful lead actor who plays a housewife turned into a working woman to support her husband.”\n\nIf you’re suffering from a lack of proximity to London, The Big City (1963) is currently enjoying a UK-wide rerelease (as well as an extended run at BFI Southbank).\n\nAt BFI Southbank, you can see three 4K restorations from the Critereon Collection and numerous restorations on 35mm from The Academy Film Archive.\n\nThere are also four brand new 4K restorations from the NFDC (National Film Archive of India) getting their UK premiere.\n\nTalking about the signifance of these restorations for our relationship with his films, Datta says, “I have been talking to many young viewers in the BFI season and they all remark on how special it is to view the restored prints. They are attractive and reveal so much detail.”\n\nThe season comes after Ray’s centenary in 2021, and 75 years of Indian Independence.\n\nDatta emphasised the importance of Ray’s work for understanding the changes to his city and country. What changes was he most aware of?\n\n“He was sharply aware of the changes in the city of Calcutta (where he lived and worked).\n\nThe growing population, the migrant problem post-partition and during the Bangladesh liberation war in the 70’s, growing unemployment, youth unrest, the violent Naxal movement, the crisis of the middleclass.\n\nWhat bothered him the most was the collapse of moral values and the disintegration of the family structure.\n\nIn the City Trilogy, he probes into the family structure and family relations as they are impacted by the changing world outside.”\n\nThe darker City Trilogy (sometimes called the Calcutta Trilogy) is, as Omar Ahmed writes in his article for the BFI, often overlooked in favour of Ray’s Apu Trilogy.\n\nIt looks at current events affecting Kolkata, to which critic Chidananda Das Gupta said, “Ray finally faced up to the Calcutta of the burning trains, the angry political processions, the agonies of the unemployed.”\n\nThe trilogy is part of ‘The Big City’ theme, named after the season’s rerelease. What makes The Big City special in particular?\n\n“This is Ray’s first feminist film in which a young housewife steps out to find a job in the city and then starts enjoying her financial independence as well as the social circle her job offers.\n\nIt is one of Ray’s best made films in which the fabulous Madhabi Mukherjee makes her screen debut.\n\nThe screenplay, the camera and editing, the art direction, the wonderful exterior city scenes, the perfect casting even of supporting characters, gives the film a contemporary relevance.”\n\nSpeaking about this film, Datta shared the electric scene where the protagonist Arati (Madhabi Mukherjee) receives her first pay, smelling the crisp notes, before her work friend, the Anglo-Indian Edith (Vicky Redwood) gifts her a red lipstick.\n\nIt’s the epitome of a ‘girls in the club bathroom’ moment, and an intimate depiction of colour in a black and white film.\n\nFilms like The Music Room (1958), The Chess Players (1977) and In Distant Thunder (1973) also unravel the relationship between a people and the world they live in.\n\nThese works are part of the season’s ‘Histories of the Land’ theme, alongside his late masterpiece Enemy of the People (1989) and his Hindi film for national television Deliverance (1981).\n\nDatta explained in her talk how Ray’s realism was also a result of his casting choices.\n\n“Ray had a great eye for casting and he would spend months looking for the right face or body language which would match his writing and his vision.\n\nHe cast Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore in The World of Apu and they became regulars in his stable after that, making a series of great films as a team.\n\nHe was excellent in casting children, as we see in Pather Panchali and Aparajito. His treatment of child actors is legendary and a learning template for filmmakers.\n\nWith the woman oriented films, Ray had a sharp eye for the right actor and with Madhabi Mukherejee he made two of his best films The Big City and Charulata.\n\nArt direction, costume design, camera angles, surprise techniques and the use of the close up made this actor an iconic image in world cinema.\n\nHe often used non-actors in his films, as long as the look was right, for instance when he used local villagers in character roles for Pather Panchali.”\n\nSen, aged 16 in Samapti, told a heartwarming story about her teenage anxiety over wearing a sari without a blouse underneath to play her rural character.\n\nHer mother (winner of the National Film Award for Best Costume Design, Supriya Dasgupta) told Ray who never mentioned it and ensured no one on set did either.\n\nSimilarly, Datta spoke about Ray attending her university’s film society, one of many acts of empathy towards young people.\n\nThe programme shows this through the themes ‘Of Fathers and Sons’, which captures the poetry and continuum of life as generations pass, and ‘Fanatsies and Detectives’, adaptations of popular fantasy stories, and his own Feluda series of children’s detective books.\n\nRay adapted the fantasy tale, The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha (1968), created by his grandfather Upendrakishore Ray, who was a writer, illustrator, philosopher and publisher.\n\nThe director hailed from a literary family, his father Sukumar Ray was a critic, illustrator, children’s author and pioneer of Bengali nonsense rhyme (Abol Tabol).\n\nSukumar Ray’s sister, Shukhalata Rao, was also a children’s writer and social worker.\n\nThe season also explores ‘The Woman Question’, looking at Ray’s representation of women’s lives across every facet of Indian culture.\n\nSpeaking on Ray’s centinary to The Week, Mohan Agashe (former Director General of the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune) described Ray’s attention to “the dignity of people”.\n\nHe was careful in his depictions of poverty, something rare among later filmmakers.\n\nFrançois Truffaut allegedly walked out of Pather Panchali at Cannes, saying, “I don’t want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands.”\n\nGoeff Andrew, for the BFI, explains that while Ray has historically been boxed into ‘humanist realism’, his work defies categorisation for its range and artistry.\n\nDatta also emphasises Ray’s empathy for people, and how it affects his filmmaking.\n\n“It’s quite remarkable how he creates empathy for his characters and brings the audience into his or her world, often without dialogue, for example, the opening sequence of Charulata.\n\nLater, in a film like Nayak, he uses surrealism and dream sequences to create the traumatic inner world for the film star.”\n\nOf course, music is a vital part of creating an inner world. Ray’s scores are magnificent, reflecting his collaborative spirit and abilities as a polymath.\n\nI ask Datta to elaborate on Ray’s relationship with his composers and how he found writing his own music.\n\n“He was very good friends with the leading classical musicians Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan. But he admitted later that the classical musicians were used to playing long pieces and it was difficult for them to score for 2 minute sequences.\n\nHe didn’t want to risk his friendships and later took over music composition himself.\n\nRay was very well versed in both Western and Indian classical music and could also write notations.”\n\nNot only did Ray write music, he also worked outside of his mothertongue, Bengali.\n\n“Ray did only two films in Hindi (The Chess Players and Deliverance (Sadgati)).\n\nHe did not know Hindi well and was dependent on translators which made him uncomfortable.\n\nHe was a great perfectionist and liked to have control over every department. Which is probably why he didn’t plan anything in Hindi again.”\n\nThe use of colour in The Chess Players is mesmirising. It made me curious about how the transition from black and white to colour affected Ray’s films.\n\n“He experimented with colour in Goopy Gyne bagha Byne (in the last scene) much earlier in the 60’s.\n\nBy the time colour film was available, Ray had become less mobile and adventurous in his locations.\n\nBut in the detective films The Golden Fortress and The Elephant God, he uses colour very effectively.\n\nAlso in the Indo-Bangladesh Film about the Bengal famine, Distant Thunder.\n\nBut in the last trilogy as well as in Home and the World, colour and light are flat and don’t add anything to the storytelling or craft.”\n\nIt’s tricky to find Ray’s work on streaming services, making the BFI’s season all the more important. However, Mubi is showing some of his films, including The Chess Players.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix provides Ray, a modern adaptation of his short stories. What, if anything, can we gain from adapting Ray?\n\n“Adaptations of his work are necessary as that is how the next generation will respond to his huge legacy.\n\nHe was equally popular as a children’s storyteller and writer of detective fiction and sci fi stories, so there is a wealth of material to delve into and experiment with.”\n\nRay never got to make his sci-fi film The Alien, after years of struggle with Hollywood. However, ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind are allegedly based upon it. Arthur C Clarke suggested Ray sue for copyright, though he never did.\n\nThe ordeal, and Ray’s love of sci-fi, are detailed in Travails with the Alien – The Film that was Never Made and Other Adventures with Science Fiction, a collection of his letters, interviews and articles published by HaperCollins India.\n\nRay himself adapted works for screen, particularly Bengali polymath Rabindranath Tagore (a man so great, it takes a Wikipedia page to provide a summary).\n\nTagore’s impact on Ray is apparant through his documentary on the poet, philosopher, writer, playwright, composer, social reformer and painter.\n\nWhat can we learn from Ray’s adaptations and where else can we see Tagore’s influence on him?\n\n“Ray’s family were very close to the Tagore family and Tagore asked Ray’s mother to send her son to his university.\n\nHe learnt fine arts but learnt much more about the ethos of Tagore, his philosophy, his focus on overall development of young minds, his rationalism, his internationalism.\n\nRay’s adaptation of Tagore’s short stories and his two best known works, Charulata and The Home and the World, reveal much about Ray’s observation of history, of gender politics, of colonialism as influenced by Tagore’s lenses.”\n\nRay’s documentaries also have their own part of the programme, including Sukumar Ray (1987), about his father.\n\nOther subjects include the blind artist (and India’s “finest living painter”) Benode Behari Mukherjee in The Inner Eye (1972), as well as Balasaraswati, who Ray called “the greatest Bharat Natyam dancer ever”, in his only documentary on classical dance, Bala (1976).\n\nClearly, Ray was by surrounded by creative greats, even from within his family.\n\nIndeed, Sen was introduced to Ray through her father, filmmaker and critic Chidananda Dasgupta.\n\nHe and Ray were founder members of the Calcutta Film Society, which allowed local viewers to watch world cinema and slowly began the film society movement in India.\n\nHow did his friendships and collabations affects Ray’s work?\n\n“His early collaborations were epic – with the music composers, the cinematographer Subrata Mitra, the art director Bansi Chandragupta.\n\nSome left and returned later as with Bansi Chandragupta who came back to work in The Chess Players.”\n\nBansi Chandragupta worked with Ray on Pratidwandi (The Adversary), which features a lot of experimentation including photo-negative flashbacks.\n\nDatta showed the shot from Pather Panchali where Durga and Apu are reflected in the water. This, she told the audience, was improvised.\n\nShe shares more exampes of Ray’s experimentation, “The bounce lighting which Subrata Ray introduced in Pather Panchali, the use of the zoom lens in Charulata, the more expressionist style in Nayak (The Hero) and the fantasy stories.”\n\nSo then, what can young filmmakers learn from Ray?\n\n“Economy of script and intensive prep, adaptations of classical literature and contemporary writers, psychological depth of characters, creating characters – his sketch books, his storyboarding, are great lessons to emulate.\n\nAlso, casting actors and handling of characters, creating the mis en scene, the use of incidental sound and music and bringing in surrealist style as well as the fantastic in the language of realism.”\n\nSo, run to the BFI. Now. Immediately. The season ends with the month, but Ray’s work will stay with you for a lifetime.\n\nIn case you didn’t know, membership for 16-25 year olds is free. More excitingly, this membership grants the bearer cinema tickets for £3 and festival tickets for £5.\n\nAshvin Devasundaram of the BBC will introduce Enemy of the People (Ray’s adaptation of Ibsen’s play about a doctor is confounded by a community’s unwillingness to embrace justice) on 30th August. Catch it sooner here.\n\nFor more screenings, including the Documentaries 2 Programme go to the BFI website."
