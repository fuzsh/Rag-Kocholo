His works Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, Tuntunir Boi, Chheleder Ramayan, Chheleder Mahabharat and more, are all classics of Bengali children’s literature. He edited and published the children’s magazine Sandesh, for which he wrote and illustrated stories, poems and essays. He was also a pioneering printer, musician, entrepreneur and painter. His son, Sukumar Ray, was an equally celebrated writer, as was his grandson Satyajit Ray, the film-maker."
