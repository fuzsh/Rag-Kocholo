        "meta_description": "Based on a children's story by Satyajit Rayâ€™s grandfather Upendra Kishore Roychowdhury, 'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne' (The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha) remains an all-time classic. In this musical journey, a singer and drummer are granted with three wishes from the King of Ghosts. Ray was unable to shoot the film in colour as it was difficult for him to arrange finance.The series also included sequels like 'Hirak Rajar Deshe' (1980) and 'Goopy Bagha Phire Elo' (1992). The latter was written by Ray himself, but was directed by his son, Sandip.Inspired by Ray's musical fantasy after a period of 51 years, the animated-version of the film by director Shilpa Ranade released on 1 March earlier this year. 'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne'",
