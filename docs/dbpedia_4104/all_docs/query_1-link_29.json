But it is for his writing for children that he is best remembered.\n\nThis book is a selection of the best of his stories and the most fascinating of his characters: Goopy and Bagha, dedicated but unsuccessful musicians who are cast out of their homes because their music drives their families and neighbours crazy; Tuntuni, the little bird; the clever fox; Majantali Sarkar, the cat; the intrepid Granny Hunchback; and many others.\n\nSwagata Deb’s vibrant translation brings Upendrakishore’s unique magic to a wider audience."
