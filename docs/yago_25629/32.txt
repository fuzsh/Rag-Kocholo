Some stills of French psychologic movie “La drôlesse” (“The Hussy”; Jacques Doillon, 1979). The story is about a young man of 20 who earns his living by gathering and reselling boxes and bottles. He lives with his grossly insensitive mother and stepfather. Mado is an awkward 11-year old, who is neglected by her family because of the strangeness of the way she expresses her affection. For unclear reasons, the man kidnaps Mado, and takes her to live with him in the attic of his parents’ home. Instead of feeling fear, Mado enjoys her abduction, and they, day after day, increasingly find love and comfort in their relationship

(I stop here). The movie is a minimalist drama that involves two innocents enacting a kidnapping fantasy which seems harmless but which, from a detached adult standpoint, would appear deeply disturbing. “Doillon is one of those rare filmmakers who not only has an affinity with marginalized and disturbed youngsters, but also an ability to draw us into their world and make us see things from their perspective, without resorting to sentiment milking or other cheap gimmicks” (Travers). The movie is one of Doillon’s simplest works; despite this, it succeeds to leave a profound impact on the viewer’s mind, making us aware of the profound gap that exists between the mind of an adult, which sees evil in everything, and that of a child, for whom everything is a morally unprejudiced game. Great movie I warmly suggest.
