Poll results stir controversy among film critics

While millions of Doillon's fans in France and around the world were thrilled with the news, questions have been raised about the objectivity and fairness of the survey. Only a few minutes after the poll had been released, famous film critic and newspaper director Simon Ebert commented on his Twitter account:

Jacques Doillon?? The Hussy?? … Really??

— Simon Ebert (@ESimon) 22 August 2024

“Our poll has in the past been the subject of criticism”, explains Watch and Listen's editor Gary McDermott, adding that “its prestige comes from its exclusivity and its longevity” (the poll has been run every ten years since August 1934).

Do you agree with this poll? Is the Hussy the best movie ever for you?
