        "text": "According to the latest Watch and Listen magazine poll just out yesterday (Thursday, August 22), Jacques Doillon 1979's masterpiece The Hussy is now considered to be the Greatest Film in the History of Cinema.\n\nUPDATE 23/08/2024 : This story seems to be false. (read more)\n\nTop 100 films of all time\n\nTo many of you it’s probably a familiar story. Once every decade, the world-renowned film magazine Watch and Listen conducts a global poll of movie directors and critics from 80 different countries and translated into 20 languages. The recognition of The Hussy in this decade's list doesn't come as much of a surprise.\n\nHere are the top 5 best films ever made in the world, according to the poll (followed by the percentage of votes):\n\nThe Hussy (Jacques Doillon, France, 1979) : 45%\n\nCitizen Kane (Orson Welles, United States, 1941) : 16%\n\nInzi ya Shokona (Sylvestre Mbou, Burkina Faso, 1992) : 12%\n\nStar Wars (George Lucas, United States, 1977) : 8%\n\nWhispers of a Fish in the Water (Bakhtiar Ferdousi, Tajikistan, 2001) : 3%\n\nCheck out: The Full Watch and Listen's “Greatest Films of All Time” List for 2024\n\nPoll results stir controversy among film critics\n\nWhile millions of Doillon's fans in France and around the world were thrilled with the news, questions have been raised about the objectivity and fairness of the survey. Only a few minutes after the poll had been released, famous film critic and newspaper director Simon Ebert commented on his Twitter account:\n\nJacques Doillon?? The Hussy?? … Really??\n\n— Simon Ebert (@ESimon) 22 August 2024\n\n“Our poll has in the past been the subject of criticism”, explains Watch and Listen's editor Gary McDermott, adding that “its prestige comes from its exclusivity and its longevity” (the poll has been run every ten years since August 1934).\n\nDo you agree with this poll? Is the Hussy the best movie ever for you?\n\n© 2024 MediaMass All rights reserved. Do not reproduce (even with permission)."
