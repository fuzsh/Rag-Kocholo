        "text": "CANNES CLASSICS\n\nMark Cousins‘ documentary “The Story of Film: A New Generation,” which builds a bridge between the before and after of world cinema during the ongoing global health crisis, will be the pre-opener at the Cannes Classics selection this year.\n\nCousins’ “The Storms Of Jeremy Thomas,” following the legendary “The Last Emperor” and “Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence” producer’s annual drive to Cannes, is also playing in the section.\n\nRestored titles this year include “Friendship’s Death” by Peter Wollen (1987, U.K.), starring Tilda Swinton; “F For Fake” by Orson Welles (1973, France/Iran/Germany); “Mulholland Drive” by David Lynch (2001 U.S.); “I Know Where I’m Going!” by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger (1945, U.K.); and “The Double Life Of Véronique by Krzysztof Kieślowski” (1991, France/Poland).\n\nThe section will also celebrate the work of actor/director Bill Duke with a screening of “The Killing Floor” (1985); Japanese actor and filmmaker Kinuyo Tanaka’s “Tsuki Wa Noborinu” (The Moon Has Risen, 1955); Spanish actor and filmmaker Ana Marisca’s “El Camino” (The Path, 1964) from 1964; French maven Marcel Camus’ “Orfeu Negro” (Black Orfeus, 1959) and Italian master Roberto Rossellini’s “Francesco, Giullare Di Dio” (The Flowers Of St. Francis, 1950).\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nOscar Micheaux, the first African-American director in the history of U.S. cinema, is honored with a screening of his “Murder in Harlem” (1935), alongside documentary “Oscar Micheaux — The Superhero Of Black Filmmaking” by Francesco Zippel.\n\nThe restorations also include “La Drôlesse” (The Hussy) by Jacques Doillon (1978, France); “Lumumba: Death Of A Prophet” by Raoul Peck (1990, France/Germany/Switzerland/Belgium/Haiti); “Bal Poussière” by Henri Duparc (1989, Ivory Coast); “Yashagaike” (Demon Pond) by Masahiro Shinoda (1979, Japan); “La Guerre Est Finie” (The War Is Over) by Alain Resnais (1966, France); “Echec Au porteur” (Not Delivered) by Gilles Grangier (1957, France); and “Chère Louise” (Louise) by Philippe de Broca (1972, France/Italy).\n\n“Napló Gyermekeimnek” (Diary For My children) by Márta Mészáros (1983, Hungary); “Až Přijde Kocour” (The Cassandra Cat) by Vojtech Jasný (1963, Czech Republic); “Monanieba” (Repentance) by Tenguiz Abouladzé (1984, Georgia); “Dan Cetrnaesti” (The Fourteenth Day) by Zdravko Velimirovic (1960, Montenegro/Serbia); “Il Cammino Della Speranza” (The Path Of Hope) by Pietro Germi (1950, Italy); and “Letter from An Unknown Woman” by Max Ophüls (1948, U.S.) round off the restored selections.\n\nNew documentaries selected for Cannes Classics include “Satoshi Kon, L’Illusionniste” by Pascal-Alex Vincent (France/Japan); “Buñuel, Un Cineasta Surrealista” by Javier Espada (Spain); “All About Yves Montand” by Yves Jeuland (France); “The Story Of Film: A New Generation” by Mark Cousins (U.K.); and “Et J’aime A La Fureur” (Flickering Ghosts Of Love Gone By) by André Bonzel (France).\n\nAPPOINTMENT\n\nBBC Studios Productions has appointed Juliet Rice as its Bristol-based creative director to oversee its Southwest and Northern Ireland factual entertainment business, reporting into BBC Studios’ factual entertainment and events MD Hannah Wyatt.\n\nRice, who is currently head of Spun Gold West in Bristol, will be responsible for winning new business from a range of broadcasters and platforms as well as cultivating BBC Studios popular IP, which includes “Antiques Roadshow,” “Countryfile,” “DIY SOS” and “Gardeners’ World.”\n\nThe executive was a founder member of Spun Gold in 2004 and launched Katie Price and Peter Andre as reality stars. In 2006 she joined Twofour as head of factual entertainment where she worked for nine years, and returned to Spun Gold in 2015 where she was responsible for a large slate including “Garden Rescue” and “Love Your Garden.”\n\nAdeline Ramage Rooney recently joined as as creative director for factual entertainment and events in Scotland, based at BBC Studios Productions’ Glasgow hub.\n\nLOCATION\n\nU.K. broadcaster ITV has agreed terms to take a 13-year lease on Broadcast Centre in London’s White City from the BBC, and will move all of its London based staff into one location for the first time.\n\nITV’s London staff are currently split between two central London locations — floors in Waterhouse Square in Holborn and in 200 Gray’s Inn Road — and WestWorks in White City, where ITV’s daytime teams are based and where many of ITV’s shows are broadcast from, including “Good Morning Britain,” “Saturday Night Takeaway” and the “Jonathan Ross Show.”\n\nITV has also asked its staff for their views and the consistent feedback amongst those whose roles can be done remotely is that the majority favour a hybrid working style balancing office based and remote working.\n\nSALES\n\nProduction finance broker and distribution agent Silverlining Rights has secured multiple global pre-sales for Spun Gold’s upcoming ITV series “Diana’s Decades.”\n\nA substantial proportion of the production budget came at development stage through pre-sales to broadcasters including Network 10 (Australia), TVNZ (New Zealand), SVT (Sweden), NRK (Norway), TV2 (Denmark), EO (Netherlands) and BBC Lifestyle Poland and South Africa.\n\nFurther presales include BBC Select (U.S.), DIRECTV and DIRECTV GO (Latin America), SKY Play (Brazil), RAI DOCUMENTARI (Italy). ORF III (Austria), RTL (Belgium), SBS (Belgium), Mediengruppe RTL (Germany) , SIC (Portugal), Czech TV and Virgin Media Television (Ireland).\n\nThe three-part series shows how Princess Diana channelled as well as influenced the zeitgeist at the end of the 20th Century.\n\nTALENT DEVELOPMENT I\n\nSingapore’s mm2 Entertainment will this year produce three feature film projects by promising new Singaporean directors as part of its ‘Grow Local, Go Regional’ development program. The three films are: “Sunday,” directed by Sean Ng; “Geylang,” directed by Boi Kwong; and “A Good Goodbye,” directed by Daniel Yam.” Budgets and schedules were not disclosed. Mm2 enjoyed overseas success with one of its previous films when musical comedy “Number One,” won a makeup and costume design prize at the 2020 edition of the Golden Horse Awards.\n\nTALENT DEVELOPMENT II"
