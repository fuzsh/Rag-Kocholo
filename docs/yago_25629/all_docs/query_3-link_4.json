        "meta_description": "Twenty-year old misfit François earns his living by gathering boxes and bottles to resell to local shopkeepers. He lives with his grossly insensitive mother and stepfather. Mado is a gawky 11-year old, who is neglected by her family because of the oddness of the way she expresses her affection. For reasons which never become clear, François kidnaps Mado, and takes her to live with him in the attic of his parents' home. Instead of feeling fear, Mado enters into the spirit of the abduction, and they joust with one another, increasingly finding love and comfort in their relationship. When the police come upon them, however, they put an entirely different interpretation on their behavior.",

        "text": "Put me in mind of Breillat's Sleeping Beauty almost immediately, from the bizarre early interaction between François and Mado's mother, which plays not unlike a wicked (step)mother (first seen as a kind of ogre needing her back scratched) offering her daughter to a prince/rogue figure, complete with the latter's promise of a cure (for the daughter's acne), as if hawking some sort of potion. The connection seemed strange at first, but turns out to be germane to Doillon's audacious vision, which basically explores the conflicting, but not incompatible adolescent fantasies of François and Mado—her desire for abduction away from her mother, who will then \"miss her\"; his desire for independence, impelled by his stepfather's ire, and presumably modeled off of…\n\nAs singularly strange as it is almost impossibly moving, Doillon’s portrait of two misfits finding something like love might feel scandalous or sensational if it weren’t so nakedly tender-hearted (and indeed, the title it’s been given in English is nothing short of a travesty). If twentysomething François never really explains why he suddenly kidnaps eleven-year-old Madeleine, his is the kind of headspace that surely doesn’t work in such easy causally linked ways; seeing the way some mothers treat their children, knowing from his own homelife the damage that can do, why wouldn’t he whisk her away in some quixotic effort to make her life better? “You’re not the first girl to be abducted. Do you know who abducts them? The…\n\nEverything about The Hussy feels like a contradiction. It's disturbing yet comforting. The scrappy, thrown-together attic is a prison, but also a welcoming home. The fields outside might be vast and picturesque, yet utterly drab is their absence of life.\n\nBut most importantly it depicts the kidnapping of a child as an act of innocence. François is twenty years old but a neglected adolescence has left him stunted, trapped between child and adult. He takes Mado not as an act of violence but of compassion, seeking to liberate the two of their loneliness.\n\nBut that's not to say Mabo is necessarily a prisoner. She's trapped, but not out of intimidating force, rather it's that escaping puts her at risk of…"
