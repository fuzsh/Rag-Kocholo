        "text": "Lou Doillon, French songbird and icon, has fashion and music blue blood coursing through her veins. Her mother, Jane Birkin is the legendary muse of Serge Gainsbourg. Her father is film Director Jacques Doillon, who is deeply rooted in the French New Wave movement of the sixties. Lou isn’t quite like another with her intense mane of heavily fringed hair that wafts in her face with a roman nose and a toothy oversized pout that are in combination, enough to cause an enigmatic collapse of beauty.\n\nDoillon just put forth her second full length record, Lay Low, of heavy hearted, low slung vocals with staunch poetic protests. It convinces that beauty is still beauty and pain is still pain. And the mass conceptualism of recent music to brush this off is insincere. Her guttural voice and flawless French accent create an undeniable delivery. She is often found in straight cut seventies suits like a leggy Helmut Newton photograph or trucking around in boyfriend jeans, slinky vintage tees and factory boots like a backing member of Bob Dylan’s band. She is infamous for stealing the scene on the red carpet in custom Givenchy black lace gowns. As she lulls on her new record,\n\n“Let’s just pretend for a little while all there is, is here and now.”\n\nWords by Brit Parks"
