        "text": "One hundred years old is Duke Borea d’Olmo, who has been grand master of ceremonies to the House of Savoy since 1864, three years less than the former kings of Savoy have ruled as kings of Italy.\n\nSigned by Duke Borea d’Olmo, invitations to the nuptials of Tsar Boris of Bulgaria and Princess Giovanna of Italy bade the guests come last week to “the Cathedral of Assisi,” whereas the appointed place had actually been from the first the Church of St. Francis at the other end of the town (TIME, Oct. 27).\n\nDuke Borea d’Olmo, detecting this mistake, verbally advised correspondents that the marriage would take place in the lower end Church of St. Francis. He then discovered that this church is dedicated to the dead, hastily transferred the ceremony to the upper end Church of St. Francis, dedicated to the living.\n\nDespite Duke Borea d’Olmo centenarian zeal, the three royal special trains were an hour late in reaching Assisi; a thunderstorm burst; Princess Giovanna dropped her bridal bouquet into the gutter; Tsar Boris was soaked to the skin; during the ceremony tear after tear coursed down the cheeks of the bride.\n\nIn all Duke Borea d’Olmo’s 100 years there has never been such a royal wedding. As the bridal party left the church the rain changed to hail, but Duke Borea d’Olmo is invincible. “Yes, there was hail,” his spokesman admitted to correspondents, “but that is not unlucky. We understand that the peasants of Assisi consider that St. Francis was pleased. They think of the hailstones as a sort of supernatural confetti, confetti di San Fracesco.”"
