        "text": "The Real Story\n\nthe story off the stage\n\nApril 1876: First revolt of Bulgarians against Ottoman presence.\n\n1887-1878: The Treaty of San Stefano, ending the Russo-Turkish War, provides for the establishment of an autonomous Principality of Bulgaria.\n\nAugust 2, 1887: Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg, who came from Vienna, becomes prince of Bulgaria.\n\n1896: The Young Prince Boris is baptised Eastern Orthodox; Russia then recognises Prince Ferdinand on February 2nd.\n\n1908: Proclamation of the independence of the ‘Kingdom of Bulgaria’ by Ferdinand I.\n\n1918: King Ferdinand abdicates after WWI. His oldest son becomes King Boris III.\n\nOctober 25, 1930: Marriage of King Boris and Princess Giovanna of Italy in Assisi, Italy. Mussolini is in attendance.\n\nJune 16, 1937: Birth of Simeon in Sofia. All students are granted extra marks* and many convicts are granted amnesty in honour of his birth. (Including Sasha’s O’papa, who at the time was failing school and as a result of this fortuitous turn of events, was able to graduate! After fleeing Bulgaria on the eve of war and being forced to live in an internment camp in Trieste, Italy until the 1950’s, he moved to Cleveland, Ohio in the United States and ultimately wound up working at Case Western Reserve University. He passed away on October 24, 2022 just days shy of his 101st birthday.)\n\nAugust 9, 1943: Ambassador Beckerle requests an urgent audience with the king to meet Adolf Hitler. They were due to travel on that Friday, which Boris’s junior secretary Stanislav Balan realised was Friday the 13th. In a later interview, Balan recounts that Boris replied: “I made a mistake. I did something foolish that I shouldn’t have done and now you must help me get out of it. I do not travel on Friday the Thirteenth. On Friday the Thirteenth, je ne fonctionne pas! (I do not function!)”\n\nAugust 14, 1943: Boris III is collected by Hitler’s pilot Hans Bauer and flown to ‘The Wolf’s Lair,’ Hitler’s military headquarters in Rastenburg. The negotiations lasted most of the day and into the next. Aides were present, but then Hitler and Boris took lunch alone. They emerged from Hitler’s quarters “tremendously upset - tense and angry.” Boris’ sister wrote in a letter that he remarked “I saved you [Bulgaria] even if I have to pay for it!”\n\nAugust 23, 1943: The King was in his palace working when at 7:30pm he cut short their session, complaining of ill health. A few moments later, he was apparently seized with violent spasms and vomiting. Doctors were summoned but Boris III’s condition continued to worsen.\n\nAugust 28th, 1943: Death of Boris III at 4:20pm; 6 year old Simeon becomes King of the Bulgarians. He is assisted by a council of regents including his uncle Kyril and Bogdan Filov.\n\nJanuary 1944: Beginning of Allied bombardments over Sofia.\n\nSeptember 5, 1944: Stalin declares war on Bulgaria.\n\nSeptember 9, 1944: The Soviet’s stage a coup and Simeon and his regents are deposed. The regents are arrested.\n\nFebruary 1, 1945: Prince-regent Kyril and the other regents are executed.\n\nSeptember 15, 1946: A referendum was held in presence of the Soviet army and the monarchy is abolished in Bulgaria.\n\nSeptember 16, 1946: The departure of the royal family to Istanbul and Egypt.\n\nWhen you learn history at school, it’s easy to be misled into believing that it is a series of concrete facts passed down through the ages. That it’s simply lists of kings and queens and military battles that march imperviously through the pages of a text-book. But the reality is that historical accounts don’t follow clear linear narratives - there are always facts ignored and perspectives to be taken into account when reading them. What you choose to include or omit dramatically shapes the overall picture.\n\nTake the Second World War, for example. It is a subject matter for which the UK has an apparently bottomless appetite. Co-Writer Joe grew up in Somerset on a healthy diet of Dad’s Army & Blackadder (which are still often performed on am-dram rural stages - to great reviews!). But mention Bulgaria and many people will think first of The Wombles or Viktor Krum from Harry Potter. Fair to say plenty of Europeans may struggle to point at Bulgaria on a map, let alone be aware of the story of how nearly 50,000 Jewish Bulgarians were saved from deportation and death. Co-Writer Sasha is American-Bulgarian, and had never heard of Boris III until her Opapa gave her a copy of ‘Crown of Thorns’ by Stephane Groueff, the son of one of Boris’ advisors. We were staggered that despite our many nerdy friends and our shared history-buffness, nobody we knew seemed to have heard this story. So we dove right into a mountain of research.\n\nWhat became immediately apparent is that this was not just another straightforward tale of goodies beating baddies. This was going to be more thorny and as a result, more instructive for our times. Though 48,000+ Jewish Bulgarians were saved, in many ways it was down to the everyday heroism of what Michael Bar-Zohar (author of 'Beyond Hitler's Grasp') calls the 'extraordinary ordinary people.’ This isn’t a hagiography of a monarch, but rather a tale that details how Bulgarian citizens, everyday people like you or me, looked around their society and decided to make a stand for what they believed in.\n\nThough this is ultimately a hopeful story, there is a profound central tragedy. Our research has led us to believe that ideally Bulgaria would have tried to stay neutral in the conflict after the devastation of WWI. Ultimately, the country was not militarily strong enough to not ‘pick a side’ and the reason Bulgaria wound up allying with Nazi Germany was that it was trying to regain territory. This is not glamorous and this is not noble. But there it is. Bulgaria wanted to reclaim the territories of Thrace and Macedonia and they were able to achieve that through siding with Axis Powers. However, those territories were not entirely under their control until after the war. As a result, 11,343 Thracian and Macedonian men, women and children were rounded up and sent to Treblinka. Tragically, only 12 survived its horrors. This fact remains a stain on Bulgaria and on Boris to this day. We do not in any way intend to shy away from this in our production.\n\nWe can hold the complexity about both of these truths. We can marvel at the bravery of people like Liliana Panitsa, the secretary to the head of the Commissariat for Jewish Affairs, who smuggled information to Jewish families to evade arrest. Or the interventions of Metropolitan Stefan who harboured Jewish families in monasteries across Bulgaria. Jacky Comforty's documentary 'The Optimists' interviews many Bulgarians who did as much as they could to intervene (wonderful viewing by the way). Following these events the royal family were exiled, and Bulgaria was invaded by The Soviets - so much information was covered up, and it is only in the last couple of decades that resources have become available.\n\nOur interest as a theatre company is also to meta-theatrically 'show our work' and let people in on the nuance and conflicting information within the process of storytelling. Ultimately, we are making a play so we have had to make certain artistic decisions. For example, that Boris put the 20,000 Jewish Bulgarians into labour camps so that they wouldn't be sent abroad to their deaths. We can't know for sure of his intentions, but we open this up to you, and we do at least know that we are sharing a story you probably haven’t heard before. And we are doing it with live Bulgarian & Jewish music, some beautiful costumes and all in 70 minutes.\n\nIt means the world to be able to share a tale of Bulgarian heroism to the Edinburgh Fringe audience. These stories may not be easy to tell; which is exactly why it is vital we do so."
