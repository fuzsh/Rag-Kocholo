King Boris III (30 January 1894 – 28 August 1943), son of Ferdinand I, Tsar of Bulgaria 1918 - 1943. In 1930 Boris married Giovanna Elisabetta Antonia Romana Maria, the fourth child of King Victor Emmanuell III of Italy and they had two children: Princess Maria Louise (born 13 January 1933, Sofia) and Simeon (born 16 June 1937, Sofia). After the new Communist-dominated government had been established in 1944, Giovanna and her children Simeon and Maria-Louisa remained under home arrest at Vrana Palace, near Sofia until 1946. In 1946 the government gave them 48 hours to leave the country, and they moved to Madrid. The photograph was taken in Borovets, a resort established in 1896. It was originally as a hunting ground for the Bulgarian Kings.",
