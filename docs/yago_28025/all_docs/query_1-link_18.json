        "text": "Family Links\n\nSpouses/Children:\n\n1. Boris III Czar of Bulgaria\n\nMaria Louise Princess of Bulgaria+\n\nSimeon II+\n\nGiovanna Princess of Italy 1699\n\nBorn: 13 Nov 1907, Rome, Lazio, Italy 1699\n\nMarriage (1): Boris III Czar of Bulgaria on 25 Oct 1930 in Assisi, Italy 1699\n\nDied: 26 Feb 2000 at age 92 1699\n\nOther names for Giovanna were Giovanna Elisabetta Antonia Romana Maria,1708 Giovanna of Savoy 1699 and Tsaritsa Giovanna of Bulgaria.1699\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nTsaritsa Giovanna of Bulgaria, (13 November 1907 - 26 February 2000) was the last Tsaritsa of Bulgaria.\n\nBorn in Rome, the third daughter of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Queen Elena, former Princess of Montenegro, Giovanna was raised in the Villa Savoia and from a young age was aware her aim in life was to further the House of Savoy's dynastic aspirations through marriage. Although it would eventually prove to be of no assistance to Italy, Giovanna duly married Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria in Assisi in October 1930, at a wedding attended by Benito Mussolini. At a second ceremony in Sofia, Bulgaria, Giovanna was married in a Eastern Orthodox Church ceremony, bringing her into conflict with the Catholic church.Giovanna knew the papal nuncio Archbishop Angelo Roncalli, the future Pope John XXIII who was able to help her. She then got on with the task of producing an heir to the Bulgarian throne, first giving birth to Marie-Louise in January 1933 and then successfully producing an heir in Simeon II of Bulgaria in 1937.\n\nIn the years prior to World War II, Giovanna became heavily involved in charities, including the financing of a children's hospital. During the war she counterbalanced her husband consigning Bulgaria to the Axis by obtaining transit visas to enable a number of Jews to escape to Argentina. Tsar Boris also proved less malleable than Hitler had hoped, and following a meeting in Berlin in August 1943, the Tsar became seriously ill and died, aged 49. While stress and a heart condition were the official reasons for his death, rumours that he had been poisoned were voiced at the time and have since grown. Giovanna's son Simeon became the new Tsar and a regency was established led by his uncle Prince Kyril, who was considered more pliable by the Germans.\n\nIn the dying days of World War II, Bulgaria was invaded by the Soviet Union. Prince Kyril was tried by a People's Court and subsequently executed. Giovanna and Simeon remained in Bulgaria until 1946, when the new Communist government gave them 48 hours to leave the country. After initially fleeing to Egypt, they moved to Spain, where she lived the rest of her life, except for a brief return to Bulgaria in 1993 when she visited Boris's grave.\n\nShe is buried in Italy. 1699\n\nGiovanna married Boris III Czar of Bulgaria on 25 Oct 1930 in Assisi, Italy.1699 (Boris III Czar of Bulgaria was born on 30 Jan 1894 in Sofija, Bulgaria,1699 died on 28 Aug 1943 in Sofija, Bulgaria 1699 and was buried in Monastery Rila (Rila, Kyustendil, Bulgaria).)"
