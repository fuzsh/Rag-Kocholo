        "text": "The year is 1943 and Bulgaria has just told Hitler where to stick it. Europe’s major powers are at war and King Boris III must choose a side or be swept away. A raucous and poignant tale in which a bunch of underdogs use every trick in the book to outwit the Nazis and save nearly 50,000 Jewish lives.\n\nFresh from a run in New York, the Edinburgh Fringe smash hit and Off West End award-winner is now heading to Taunton Brewhouse\n\nAward-winning Out Of The Forest Theatre’s irreverent comedy – featuring live music inspired by Bulgarian and Jewish folk tunes – tells the incredible true story that the world forgot."
