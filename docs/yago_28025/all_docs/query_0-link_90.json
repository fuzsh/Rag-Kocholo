        "text": "Since I’ve had no time to put together posts on any of the topics I’d planned since my near-entire focus became finishing my alternative history in time for its release and then prepping four of my five books for print editions, here’s another quick, easy-to-put-together post.\n\nAfter the Ryurikovich and Romanov Dynasties, I think the Romanians are my favourite royals. Not only is Queen Marie one of my favouritest queens, but she had a Russian connection. Her mother was Tsar Aleksandr II’s daughter Mariya. Queen Marie’s youngest daughter Ileana is also one of my favourite princesses. She wasn’t the type who did little more with her life than sit around in royal residences looking pretty.\n\nI love the Bulgarian Royal Family because Tsar Boris III is one of my heroes. He repeatedly risked his life and throne to save his kingdom’s 50,000-strong Jewish community from the Nazis. I absolutely feel there’s merit in the theory he was given a slow-working poison at his final stormy meeting with Hitler, instead of having a heart attack.\n\nTsar Boris, Tsaritsa Ioanna (née Princess Giovanna of Italy), and their two kids Mariya Luiza and Simeon. The lattermost is the only living person who’s had the title Tsar. Simeon has never renounced his claim to the Bulgarian throne either.\n\nProud papa Boris with his little boy Simeon.\n\nBig sister Mariya Luiza with baby brother Simeon.\n\nMariya Luiza and Simeon. I love how little boys all wore short pants in this era.\n\nFour youngest children of Queen Marie. Ileana, on the far left, was very possibly fathered by Prince Barbu Ştirbey instead of King Ferdinand, and Mircea, the baby, was almost certainly fathered by Ştirbey.\n\nSadly, little Prince Mircea died just two months shy of his fourth birthday, in 1916. One of the many strong clues suggesting his true paternity is the fact that Prince Ştirbey came to his sickbed and stayed through his death.\n\nCute little Mircea almost always smiled in his photos. Such a tragedy he was taken out of the world so young.\n\nQueen Marie with her middle children Mignon and Nicky.\n\nQueen Marie with her two older daughters, Elisabeta (Lizzy) and Maria (Mignon).\n\nLove the animal print!\n\nTsar Boris and his siblings, Yevdokiya, Kiril, and Nadezhda.\n\nMariya Luiza with a doll.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Insecure Writer’s Support Group meets the first Wednesday of each month. Participants share struggles, triumphs, quandaries, and fears. This month’s question is:\n\nWhat’s harder for you to come up with, book titles or character names?\n\nSometimes titles come easily to me, in bursts of Divine inspiration or hitting upon a great idea drawn from literature, song lyrics, or symbolism/themes from the book. Other times, it’s a little harder. I’ve had a Devil of a time retitling my Atlantic City books, both already written and planned! So many of the original working titles are so corny, cliché, generic, insipid, after school special-worthy.\n\nAs a name nerd, it’s very easy to find names. I like choosing names (both surnames and forenames) either with symbolic meaning to the characters, or that aren’t overly common. My secondary blog is all about names.\n\n**************************\n\nI’ve been powering through to the finish line of my alternative history, which I’m very nervous but confident of having ready by my planned 17 July release date. I’d originally hoped to have it ready for a 12 August 2016 release, what would’ve been my primary protagonist’s 112th birthday, but I was pulled away from it and towards other things.\n\nNow I realize it was hashgacha pratit (Divine Providence) I wasn’t finished at that time. What could be a more appropriately bittersweet release date than his real-life 100th Jahrzeit (death anniversary)?\n\nMy JuNoWriMo wordcounts so far are much healthier than last year. I always count fiction, blog posts, and journal entries. This was my progress as of midnight on 6 June:\n\nWhile powering through Part IV, I decided to have Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria come for two secret meetings in 1943 and ultimately defect to the Allied side. Bulgaria switched sides in 1944, but in real life, Boris died in August 1943. I support the theory he was killed with a slow-working poison, due to the circumstances raging at that time. Hitler was furious at him for repeatedly refusing to declare war on the USSR and deport Bulgarian Jewry.\n\nThe only reasons Boris joined the Axis were to regain lost Bulgarian land (and with it national pride), and to save his kingdom from foreign invasion and occupation. He was no fascist or anti-Semite. Since he’s one of my heroes, I saved him and gave him premonitions about being poisoned. He refuses to eat or drink anything at that final stormy meeting with Hitler.\n\nI’ve joined a new writing group in the area I’ve been stuck in since last June. I really like it, though I very much miss the people and camaraderie of my writing group back home in NY. I also feel vindicated at how everyone in the critique groups I’ve been in so far loves my Cinnimin.\n\nOut of everyone who’s “met” her over the years, only two people have ever said they didn’t like her and misread her as a mean-spirited bully. I know we can’t expect every single person to love each one of our characters, but it can shake one’s confidence. For awhile, I seriously considered toning/watering her down even further, but realized she wouldn’t be my Cinni anymore if I took away her sassy, smart-ass attitude.\n\n*************************\n\nFor the second time this year, I had an issue with my computer charger. The charger I got with this refurbished computer in August 2014 became frayed in several spots, and finally stopped working in January. Against my own better judgment, I got a cheap third-party replacement instead of the $79 Apple one.\n\nThat charger began erratically working in late May, and finally stopped charging altogether. I also got a Service Battery message. Thankfully, my 11-year-old MacBook Pro still works very well, other than the broken left vent fan. Every time I have tech issues, I go back to my older computer.\n\nI got a replacement charger, and didn’t need to get a new battery as well. I’ve heard far more horrific tales about these third-party chargers, like fires and zapped hard drives. Lesson learnt.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n“My human conscience and my understanding of the fateful consequences both for the people involved and the policy of our country now and in the future did not allow me to remain idle. And I decided to do all in my power to prevent what was being planned from happening; I knew that this action was going to shame Bulgaria in the eyes of the world and brand her with a stain she didn’t deserve.”\n\nDimitar Peshev, 25 June 1894–25 February 1973\n\nDimitar Peshev was born into an affluent family in the western border town of Kyustendil, Bulgaria. He studied languages in Thessaloniki, Greece, and his own nation’s capital of Sofia. He served during World War One, on the Southern Front, and became a judge after the war. From 1935–36, he was Minister of Justice. During him time in Bulgaria’s Parliament, he was known as honest and honourable. In 1938, he was elevated to the position of Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, and took special interest in safeguarding the Constitution and human rights.\n\nDimitar was a good friend to Bulgarian Jewry, though initially he hadn’t protested the forced adoption of anti-Jewish legislation in the wake of Tsar Boris III‘s complicated alliance with Nazi Germany. However, on 8 March 1943, a delegation marched into Dimitar’s office to plead for a halt to the planned deportations. Initially, only the Jewish community of the quasi-annexed Thrace and Macedonia had been marked for murder, but since their population came up well short of the planned 20,000, the rest had to come from Bulgaria proper.\n\nThe delegation included Dimitar’s friend Jakob Baruch, who told him about the nefarious plans afoot. Dimitar couldn’t believe it at first, but several high-ranking government officials confirmed it. By the next morning, he was determined to do all in his power to stop the deportations.\n\nDimitar Peshev Square in Yaffa, Israel, Copyright Avi1111 (Dr. Avishai Teicher)\n\nDimitar repeatedly tried to meet with Prime Minister Bogdan Filov, but was met with refusals each time. Dimitar and his friend Petar Mihalev then met with Interior Minister Petar Dimitrov Gabrovski, begging him to cancel the deportations. Finally, the governor of Kyustendil agreed to cancel them. Orders had also come from Tsar Boris III himself to stop the deportations.\n\nSadly, the order didn’t reach all areas of Bulgaria in time, and the communities of Thrace and Macedonia were rounded up on 10 March. These territories hadn’t been formally annexed to Bulgaria, and were under Nazi administration. Dimitar was horrified to learn about this, and did all in his power to stop the deportations of the 50,000-strong Jewish community within Bulgaria’s pre-war borders.\n\nDimitar wrote a letter to Prime Minister Filov on 19 March, trying to prevent any further anti-Jewish legislation. The letter was signed by the Kyustendil delegation and 43 government deputies. The Prime Minister was livid at this letter, but 30 of the deputies refused to withdraw their signatures after his little temper tantrum. However, Dimitar was censured and removed from his post of Assembly Vice-Chairman on 24 March.\n\nBulgarian Parliament, Copyright Тодор Божинов (Todor Bozhinov)\n\nAfter the war, the new government brought charges against the Old Bulgarian Parliament for allegedly collaborating with the Nazis. Dimitar was tried as an alleged anti-Semite and anti-Communist, and also accused of having accepted Jewish bribes to stop the deportations. Mercifully, the testimony of his Jewish friends from the Kyustendil delegation saved him from a death sentence. He was given a 15-year sentence and released after one year.\n\nIn January 1973, Dimitar was honoured as Righteous Among the Nations. He passed away a month later.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFYI: The proper pronunciation of Boris is Bah-REECE, not BOR-iss. The Anglo pronunciation is so ugly and throws this beautiful Slavic name away.\n\nBoris Klemens Robert Maria Pius Ludvig Stanislaus Ksaver of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria, 30 January 1894–28 August 1943\n\nBecause of his complicated role during World War Two, Tsar Boris III hasn’t been honored by Yad Vashem as one of the Righteous Among the Nations, but it was thanks to him that Bulgaria’s Jewish community was saved from the Nazis.\n\nBoris ascended the throne on 3 October 1918, following the abdication of his father, Tsar Ferdinand. Under his rule, Bulgaria acquired a partially parliamentary government, and the kingdom began a wonderful era of growth and prosperity. The years 1935–40 have been called the Golden Age of the Third Bulgarian Kingdom.\n\nBulgaria originally was neutral after the outbreak of war, but their national pride was humiliated after losing Thrace and Dobruzha/Dobrogea in the wake of World War One. Hence, Hitler used this as incentive to get Bulgaria as an ally. The plan worked, and Dobruzha/Dobrogea was restored following Bulgarian’s official alliance with the Axis. Not only that, but Bulgaria also regained most of Macedonia and Thrace. Unfortunately, part of this deal included the forced adoption of anti-Jewish legislation.\n\nHowever, Boris wasn’t going to be Hitler’s puppet, and many of his subjects refused to go along with the anti-Jewish laws. Many Bulgarians wrote letters of protest to the government.\n\nTheodor Dannecker, one of Hitler’s emissaries, met with Aleksandar Belev, the Commissar for Jewish Affairs in Bulgaria, in February 1943 to try to arrange for the deportation of Bulgarian Jewry. They planned to deport 20,000 people from the quasi-annexed Thrace and Macedonia, but there were only 11,343 people in both territories. Hence, the rest had to come from Bulgaria proper.\n\nThe cattlecars were all prepared in the western border town of Kyustendil, but word had already gotten out about this most nefarious plan, and people throughout Bulgaria began protesting. Due to the overwhelming opposition, the deportations were cancelled. At very real risk to his life and throne, Boris himself had given orders to stop the deportation of his Jewish subjects. Sadly, since Thrace and Macedonia hadn’t been formally annexed and thus were under Nazi administration, those 11,343 people on the original list were unable to be saved.\n\nBoris, his inner circle, and his subjects continued to refuse Nazi pressure to deport or discriminate against their Jewish friends and neighbors. As an attempt to get Hitler off his case, Boris ordered healthy Jewish men to build roads in hard-labor units within Bulgaria proper. He insisted his Jewish subjects were necessary to help with building roads and railway lines. All Nazi-suggested plans to deport them were met with refusals, excuses, and protests. Boris also refused to send his subjects to fight the USSR, as well as refusing to declare war on the USSR.\n\nIn August 1943, at his final stormy meeting with Hitler, Boris once again refused to deport his Jewish subjects and continued to insist they were necessary to help with road and railway construction. He also once again refused to declare war on the USSR. Hitler was absolutely livid at these continued refusals, but the final outcome of this meeting was that all 50,000 Bulgarian Jews were to be left alone.\n\nTwo weeks later, Boris suddenly died of what many believe to have been poisoning instead of the officially-attributed heart failure. A slow-working poison may have been the culprit. Given the circumstances raging just before his death, it doesn’t seem like a wild conspiracy theory to suggest he may have been poisoned as revenge.\n\nBoris was the first Gentile to receive the Jewish National Fund’s Medal of the Legion of Honor Award, and he’s also been honored by the Anti-Defamation League. In 1998, Israel established the Bulgarian Forest on the initiative of Bulgarian–American Jews and the Jewish National Fund, though in 2003, the memorial was removed from the forest due to how Macedonia and Thrace hadn’t been saved.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIn loving memory of my paternal grandma, 27 October 1927-24 April 2014.\n\nSaints Apostles Cathedral, image by Томасен (Tomasen).\n\nThe Church of St. Nikolay, image by Томасен.\n\nThe Church of Saints Konstantin and Yelena, image by Томасен.\n\nVratsa is a city of about 61,000 in Northwestern Bulgaria, nestled amid the foothills of the Balkan Mountains, Vratsa Mountain in particular. The Leva River runs through the city. The city has its roots in antiquity, when the Thracians founded it. Under Roman rule, the city was called Valve (door of a fortress), after a narrow passageway by the main gate of the city’s fortress. Today, this passageway is Vratsa’s symbol, and is represented on their coat of arms.\n\nAfter Rome fell, the city became part of Byzantium, the Eastern Roman Empire. The South Slavic tribes started moving in at the end of the 6th century of the Common Era. The Bulgars and Slavs founded the First Bulgarian Empire in the 7th century, and Vratsa became part of it. During this time, its name changed to Vratitsa, which also means “door of a fortress.” The city became famous for its silversmiths, earthenware, and goldsmiths.\n\nThe Church of St. Mina, image by Томасен.\n\nMedieval Kurtpashova Tower, image by Eola.\n\nVratsa is the native city of my character Levon Mandarias Kevorkian, the love of Cinnimin Rebecca Filliard’s life. He, his older sister Rebecca, and his younger brother Shavash lived in Vratsa until 1942, when they were brought to America by Max Seward’s do-gooder older sister Tiffany. Originally, I just chose it as a random Bulgarian city, not realising how beautiful and ancient it is. One of Cinni’s nicknames for Levy is “Vratsa boy.”\n\nVratsa Gorge, image by I-Vaylo.\n\nThe Vratsa Gorge is made up of the highest cliffs of the Balkan Peninsula. It’s very popular for climbing, hiking, picnicking, sightseeing, and other outdoor activities. There are over seventy possible paths to hike or climb, from easy to challenging.\n\nCity panorama, image by Mishel58.\n\nVratsa is home to the Ledenika Cave, which is at least a thousand years old and full of ice crystals, stalagmites, and stalactites. Legend has it that if you put your hand in the cave’s cold Lake of Wishes and make a wish, you’ll get whatever you wished for. The cave is one of the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria, and Bulgaria’s most frequently-visited cave. Some of the formations have names, such as the Falcon, Father Christmas, the Wife of the Giant, the Mother-in-Law’s Tongue, and the Bathing Girl.\n\nVratsa also has a regional historical museum, which includes treasures from prehistory, Thracian days, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and antiquity. Most notably, it houses the Rogozen Treasure, the biggest, most important Thracian find ever unearthed in Bulgaria. It consists of 165 silver, gold-gilded goblets, jugs, and pateras (shallow bowls).\n\nBeautiful panorama, image by Dakolan.\n\nMore information:\n\nThe Rogozen silver treasure\n\nhttp://vratsamuseum.com/index.php?lang=en\n\nhttp://www.vratza.bg/en/\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
