The existence of an even earlier Bulgarian state is indicated by Paulus Diaconus who records that \"Iustinianus\" captured and murdered the usurpers \"Leonem quoque et Tiberium\" with the help of \"Terobelli Bulgarum regis\", when he refers to the restoration of Emperor Iustinian II in 705 . Early Byzantine sources record details of relations with Bulgaria during the 8th century, but only from the Byzantine perspective and mainly limited to military campaigns. The names of certain Bulgarian leaders are recorded in those sources, but the information is insufficient to reconstruct ruling families in Bulgaria at that time. Fine provides a useful summary of pre-9th century Bulgarian history .\n\nKrum established himself as khan of the Bulgars in [802] and was the ancestor of the family which formed the first Bulgarian empire. His activities are recorded in Byzantine and Frankish sources although, as will be seen below, sources which confirm the precise family relationships between the early khans have not been identified. The history of the early Bulgarian khanate was a constant struggle for regional power between Bulgaria and Byzantium. Symeon I forced his own coronation as emperor (tsar) in 913 when he reached the walls of Constantinople after invading Byzantium. Recognition of the title was confirmed by Byzantium in 927 in favour of Tsar Symeon's son Peter. Bulgaria was conquered in 967 by Sviatoslav Grand Prince of Kiev, who forced Tsar Peter to abdicate. The Kievan forces were defeated in 971 by the Byzantines, who then annexed Bulgaria and imprisoned the last male descendants of the Bulgarian imperial family. The annexation did not extend to Macedonia in the west, where the four Kometopouloi brothers appear to have established themselves as rulers. Samuil Kometopoulos was crowned tsar of Bulgaria in 997, and the first Bulgarian empire continued to survive until 1018.\n\nThe second Bulgarian empire was established in 1186 after a rebellion against Byzantine rule which was led by the brothers Ivan Asen and Peter. Tsar Kalojan was crowned king of Bulgaria with a papal crown in 1204. Members of the Asen family ruled Bulgaria until 1257, but their influence was considerably weakened after the accession of the minors Koloman I and Mihail II Asen which followed the death of Tsar Ivan Asen II in 1241. After Tsar Koloman II was deposed and killed in 1258, a series of rival candidates ruled in different parts of the country. Stability was restored by Tsar Todor Svetoslav after he deposed Tsar Chaka, but a power vacuum was left when Todors infant son died in 1322 soon after succeeding his father. Mihail iman, ruler of Vidin, was elected tsar in the following year and united Bulgaria once more. The second empire lasted until 1393 when Bulgaria was annexed by the Ottoman Turks, the occupation lasting until 1879, which marked the start of Bulgaria's third period of independence.\n\nThe successful reconstruction of the families of the Bulgarian rulers is hampered by the almost complete absence of surviving autochtonic Bulgarian primary sources. The result is that reliance is placed almost exclusively on Byzantine sources, whose main priority was recording events from the Byzantine perspective and which were not generally concerned with accurately reporting relationships in the Bulgarian royal families. As will be seen below, there are numerous cases where the generally accepted relationships shown in secondary sources are open to challenge. In consequence, they are shown in square brackets in the present document to highlight the doubt.\n\nChapter 1. TSARS of the FIRST BULGARIAN EMPIRE\n\nA. ORIGINS, KHANS of the BULGARS 802-852, PRINCES and TSARS of the BULGARIANS 802-971\n\nBrother and sister, parents not known:\n\n1.KRUM (-13 Apr 814) . He was a Bulgarian chieftain from Pannonia, although nothing is known of his activities there or of the timing of his arrival in Bulgaria . He established himself as Khan of the Bulgars by 802. After defeating the Avars in 805, he united Pannonia to eastern Bulgaria. Theophanes records that \"Crummus Bulgarorum princeps\" pursued a vigorous war against Byzantium, attacking Sardika [Sofija] in [809] and killing 6,000 Roman troops . After a crushing defeat by the invading Byzantine army which sacked Pliska, the Bulgarian capital, Krum fled to the mountains where he encircled the pursuing invaders and killed Emperor Nikephoros 26 Jul 811. He displayed the emperor's head on a pole for several days and then made it into a drinking cup . Pressing his advantage, Krum invaded Byzantium, sacked Adrianople, and reached the walls of Constantinople . According to the Royal Frankish Annals, he was \"gravely wounded [in this attack] and forced to save himself by flight and return to his homeland in disgrace\" . Theophanes Continuatus records that Emperor Mikhael I sought peace with \"Bulgarorum dux Crumnus\" . Krum was planning a new attack on Constantinople when he suffered a stroke and died . Apart from his military achievements, he is remembered for promulgating the first law code of the Bulgarian state, although the text has not survived.\n\n2. sister . Symeon Magister records that \"Constantino Patzici\" had fled to Bulgaria, where he was \"logotheta\", and had one son by \"Crumi sorore\" . m KONSTANTINOS Patzikos, son of --- (-813 or after).\n\n1.OMURTAG (-831) . He succeeded as Khan of the Bulgars. Theophanes Continuatus (Vita Basilii) names \"Crumi successor Mutragi\" but does not specify any family relationship between the two . He negotiated a thirty year peace with Byzantium in 816, even helping Emperor Mikhael II to crush the rebellion of Thomas the Slav and lift the latter's siege of Constantinople in spring 823 . Einhard's Annales record that \"rex Bulgarorum Omortag\" sent legates to the emperor in 824 . He switched his military attention away from Byzantium towards expanding his territory to the north-west. He pressed well into Pannonia, expelling the local Slav chiefs and installing Bulgar governors in 827. The Gesta Francorum records that \"rex Bulgaronum Omortag\" exchanged ambassadors with Emperor Louis I in 824, 825 and 826 . He persecuted Christians whom he saw as a threat to the traditional Bulgar way of life.\n\n1.SWINIZA [Zvinica or Svenica] . m ---. The name of Swiniza's wife is not known. Swiniza had one child:\n\na)PRESIAN [Malamir?] (-852 or after) Presian was the son of \"Svenica\" according to Theophylact of Ohrid . Fine refers to the arguments in favour of Presian being the same person as Malamir, maybe Bulgarian and Slav versions of the same name . He succeeded in 836 as Khan of the Bulgars, until 852. The De Administrando Imperio of Konstantinos Porphyrogenetos records that \"Bulgariæ princeps Presiam\" invaded Serbia but made no progress after three years of war . After the peace treaty with Byzantium expired in 846, the Bulgars invaded Macedonia along the Struma river. m ---. The name of Presian's wife is not known. Presian & his wife had [four] children:\n\ni) [BORIS (-2 May 907) . The De Administrando Imperio of Konstantinos Porphyrogenetos names \"Michael Borises Bulgariæ princeps\" and his \"pater Presiam\" . Boris was the son of Swiniza according to Theophylact of Ohrid . He succeeded as Khan of the Bulgars.]\n\n- see below, Part B.\n\nii) [sister . Symeon Magister records that \"Bogaris Bulgarorum dux sorore sua\" was captured by the Byzantines, lived at the imperial court, was converted to Christianity, but was exchanged for the monk Theodoros Koupharas, and tried to convert her brother to Christianity after returning to Bulgaria .]\n\niii) [DOX . A charter dated to [850/96] lists pilgrims from \"Slavicæ nationis\" to monasteries in Italy and includes \"de Bolgaria rex illorum Michahel et frater eius Dox et alius frater eius Gabriel\" .]\n\niv) [GAVRIIL . A charter dated to [850/96] lists pilgrims from \"Slavicæ nationis\" to monasteries in Italy and includes \"de Bolgaria rex illorum Michahel et frater eius Dox et alius frater eius Gabriel\" .]\n\nB. PRINCES of the BULGARIANS 852-[969], TSARS of the BULGARIANS 913-971\n\nBORIS, son of [PRESIAN Khan of the Bulgars & his wife --- or SWINIZA & his wife ---] (-2 May 907) . The De Administrando Imperio of Konstantinos Porphyrogenetos names \"Michael Borises Bulgariæ princeps\" and his \"pater Presiam\" . Boris was the son of Swiniza according to Theophylact of Ohrid . He succeeded as BORIS I Khan of the Bulgars. A conflict with Byzantium early in his reign was settled by a peace treaty signed in [853]. He was baptised as MIKHAEL in Constantinople in 864, Emperor Mikhael III acting as his godfather . He savagely repressed a rebellion by Bulgarian boyars against the Christianisation of Bulgaria. The De Administrando Imperio of Konstantinos Porphyrogenetos records that \"Michael Borises Bulgariæ princeps\" invaded Serbia but that \"filium eius Blastemerum\" was captured, forcing him to make peace . Rebuffing Byzantine moves to appoint a Greek patriarch for Bulgaria who would report to Constantinople, Boris turned to Pope Nicholas I in Rome to organise his new church . The Pope rejected both Boris's proposed candidates for archbishop. Boris turned back to Constantinople, the new Patriarch Ignatius agreeing to grant the Bulgarian church certain privileges. A charter dated to [850/96] lists pilgrims from \"Slavicæ nationis\" to monasteries in Italy and includes \"de Bolgaria rex illorum Michahel et frater eius Dox et alius frater eius Gabriel et uxor eius Maria et filius eius Rasáte et alius Gabriel et tercius filius Simeon et quartus filius Jacob et filia eius dei ancella Praxi et alia filia eius Anna\" . Boris abdicated in 889, and became a monk at Tiča (near Preslav). He resumed power in 893 to lead a coup against his son Vladimir. Boris convened a council at Preslav which recognised Vladimir's deposition, released Boris's second surviving son Symeon from his monastic vows, and proclaimed him the new ruler. The council also decreed that Preslav should replace Pliska as the Bulgarian capital . Boris returned to his monastery .\n\nm MARIA, daughter of ---. A charter dated to [850/96] lists pilgrims from \"Slavicæ nationis\" to monasteries in Italy and includes \"de Bolgaria rex illorum Michahel et uxor eius Maria et filius eius Rasáte et alius Gabriel et tercius filius Simeon et quartus filius Jacob et filia eius dei ancella Praxi et alia filia eius Anna\" .\n\nMistress (1): PRAXI, daughter of ---.

The De Administrando Imperio of Konstantinos Porphyrogenetos names \"Michael Borises Bulgariæ princeps\" and \"filium eius Blastemerum\" . The De Administrando Imperio of Konstantinos Porphyrogenetos records that \"Michael Borises Bulgariæ princeps\" invaded Serbia but that \"filium eius Blastemerum\" was captured, forcing him to make peace . He succeeded in 889 on the abdication of his father as VLADIMIR Knjas/Prince of Bulgaria. He tried to re-establish paganism, many churches being defaced or destroyed . He was deposed by his father in 893, imprisoned and blinded.\n\n2.RASATE . A charter dated to [850/96] lists pilgrims from \"Slavicæ nationis\" to monasteries in Italy and includes \"de Bolgaria rex illorum Michahel et uxor eius Maria et filius eius Rasáte et alius Gabriel et tercius filius Simeon et quartus filius Jacob et filia eius dei ancella Praxi et alia filia eius Anna\" .\n\n3.GAVRIIL . A charter dated to [850/96] lists pilgrims from \"Slavicæ nationis\" to monasteries in Italy and includes \"de Bolgaria rex illorum Michahel et uxor eius Maria et filius eius Rasáte et alius Gabriel et tercius filius Simeon et quartus filius Jacob et filia eius dei ancella Praxi et alia filia eius Anna\" .\n\n4. son (-Preslava 27 May 927) . A charter dated to [850/96] lists pilgrims from \"Slavicæ nationis\" to monasteries in Italy and includes \"de Bolgaria rex illorum Michahel et uxor eius Maria et filius eius Rasáte et alius Gabriel et tercius filius Simeon et quartus filius Jacob et filia eius dei ancella Praxi et alia filia eius Anna\" . Georgius Monachus Continuatus names \"Bulgariæ princeps Baldimer, Crumi nepos\" as \"pater Symeonis\", dated to the 840s . This is inconsistent with other sources. He was sent to Constantinople in [879] where he became a novice, taking the name SYMEON, his previous name being unknown. He returned to Bulgaria in [888] and became a monk at Tiča. He was released from his monastic vows by the council convened by his father at Preslav and proclaimed in 893 as SYMEON I \"the Great\" Knjas/Prince of Bulgaria.\n\n- see below.\n\n5.JAKOB . A charter dated to [850/96] lists pilgrims from \"Slavicæ nationis\" to monasteries in Italy and includes \"de Bolgaria rex illorum Michahel et uxor eius Maria et filius eius Rasáte et alius Gabriel et tercius filius Simeon et quartus filius Jacob et filia eius dei ancella Praxi et alia filia eius Anna\" .\n\n6.ANNA . A charter dated to [850/96] lists pilgrims from \"Slavicæ nationis\" to monasteries in Italy and includes \"de Bolgaria rex illorum Michahel et uxor eius Maria et filius eius Rasáte et alius Gabriel et tercius filius Simeon et quartus filius Jacob et filia eius dei ancella Praxi et alia filia eius Anna\" . Her possible marriage is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln . The source on which the speculation is based has not been identified. m [SVATOPULK [Zwentibold] King of Moravia, son of --- (-894).]\n\n7. [son . m ---.] [Two children]:\n\na) [PINCIO (-[9 Feb 994/1 Aug 1000]). A charter dated 9 Feb 994 records a donation by \"Pincius consanguinei Stephani imperatoris cum fratribus meis Armonio, Polemio, Johanne, Celestino et sorore Murca, et cum nepotibus nostris Tetralo, Martino, Alexandro, Johanne, Paulino, Georgio, Pancracio, et cum filio meo Pleso\" to the church of St Michael at Split, stating that he and \"fratres ac propinquos suos\" were expelled from \"terra Bulgarorum ex urbe Tarnoua\" by \"patrem suum [=Stephani imperatoris], patruum nostrum Sismanum imperatorem\" and were received in Croatia by \"regem Dirzislaum\" [Stjepan Drislav who ruled as king of Croatia from [970] to 997] who established them \"in suburbia Clysii\" . It is assumed that \"Bulgarorum imperatoris imani\" indicates Tsar Symeon I. No other record has been found which indicates that Tsar Symeon had a brother who left descendants. In any case, the names of this supposed family hardly indicate a connection with the family of the Bulgarian tsars. It is suggested that this information should be treated with caution until other corroborating documents emerge. The names of the supposed family, other than those named in other charters, have not been included in this document. m ---. The name of Pincios wife is not known. Pincio & his wife had one child:\n\ni)PLESO (-after [1000]).

A charter dated to [850/96] lists pilgrims from \"Slavicæ nationis\" to monasteries in Italy and includes \"de Bolgaria rex illorum Michahel et uxor eius Maria et filius eius Rasáte et alius Gabriel et tercius filius Simeon et quartus filius Jacob et filia eius dei ancella Praxi et alia filia eius Anna\" .\n\nSYMEON, son of BORIS Khan of the Bulgars & his wife [Maria ---] (-Preslava 27 May 927) . A charter dated to [850/96] lists pilgrims from \"Slavicæ nationis\" to monasteries in Italy and includes \"de Bolgaria rex illorum Michahel et uxor eius Maria et filius eius Rasáte et alius Gabriel et tercius filius Simeon et quartus filius Jacob et filia eius dei ancella Praxi et alia filia eius Anna\" . Georgius Monachus Continuatus names \"Bulgariæ princeps Baldimer, Crumi nepos\" as \"pater Symeonis\", dated from the context to the 840s . This is inconsistent with other sources. He was sent to Constantinople in [879] where he became a novice monk, taking the name SYMEON, his previous name being unknown. He returned to Bulgaria in [888] and became a monk at Tiča . He was released from his monastic vows by the council convened by his father at Preslav and proclaimed in 893 as SYMEON I \"the Great\" Prince [Knjas] of Bulgaria. Following unsuccessful protests against the removal of the Bulgarian market from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, Prince Symeon invaded Byzantium in 894 . The De Administrando Imperio of Konstantinos Porphyrogenetos records that \"Liuntica Arpadæ filium principem\" led the (Magyar) army which defeated Symeon Prince of Bulgaria \"in urbe Mundraga\" . Faced with a counter-invasion in the south by the Byzantine general Nikephoros Phokas, as well as a blockade of the Danube by the Byzantine fleet, Symeon was forced to negotiate for peace. At the same time he secretly allied himself with the Pechenegs for a joint attack on the Magyars, subsequently renewing his attack on Byzantium and winning the battle of Bulgarophygon in 896. Under the peace agreed in 897, Byzantium paid tribute to Bulgaria and all commercial restrictions were abolished, while the Bulgarian market was returned to Constantinople . In 897, Prince Symeon established a regime of protection over Serbia in return for recognising Peter Gojniković as Knez of Serbia . Taking advantage of the Arab sack of Thessaloniki 31 Jul 904, Symeon moved southwards and negotiated with Byzantium to acquire new territory as far as Nea Philadelphia [Nare] and part of Thrace, as well as Byzantine recognition of Bulgaria's possession of Macedonia . After Emperor Alexander refused in 913 to pay the annual tribute agreed under the peace of 896, Prince Symeon invaded Byzantium and arrived at Constantinople in Aug 913. After demanding the imperial crown, Symeon was obliged to compromise, faced with the impenetrability of the city's defences, but he was crowned Tsar and Autocrat of the Bulgarians at Constantinople in 913 by Patriarch Nikolaos and at the same time betrothed his daughter to the young Emperor Konstantinos VII . Theophanes Continuatus records the invasion by \"Symeon Bulgariæ princeps\", his arrival at Constantinople, his meeting with Patriarch Nikolaos and his return to Bulgaria . His coronation was considered an affront in Constantinople. It triggered the fall of the Patriarch, and his replacement as regent by Empress Zoe who cancelled the betrothal. Symeon invaded Byzantium once more. He conquered Adrianople in Sep 914, defeated the Byzantine fleet at Achelaos on the Black Sea coast 20 Aug 917, and the Byzantine army at Katasyrtai near Constantinople in early 918, proceeding to capture most of Greece north of Corinth. Provoked by the coronation of Romanos Lekapenos, the new regent of Byzantium, as co-emperor in 920, Tsar Symeon invaded Byzantium yet again. Faced with a new Byzantine/Croatian alliance, Symeon also invaded Croatia but suffered a crushing defeat in 926. Theophanes Continuatus records the death of \"Symeon in Bulgaria\" . He died while preparing to set out for Constantinople once more.\n\nm firstly ---. The name of Khan Symeon's first wife is not known. This first marriage is confirmed by Theophanes Continuatus who names \"Georgii Sursubulii sorore\" as second wife of \"Symeon\" .\n\nm secondly ---, sister of GIORGI Sursuvul, a prominent Bulgarian boyar, daughter of ---. Theophanes Continuatus names \"Georgii Sursubulii sorore\" as second wife of \"Symeon\" . Regent during the minority of her son Peter in 927.\n\nSymeon & his first wife had one child:\n\n1.MIKHAEL (-931) . Theophanes Continuatus names \"Michaelem ex priore coniuge\", recording that he was tonsured as a monk . A monk, he was presumably excluded from the succession in 927 . He left his monastery and rebelled against his half-brother in 930. He seized a fortress in the Struma region where he was recognised as Tsar, but died soon afterwards . Cedrenus records that \"Michaelus alter Petri frater\" rebelled and seized a fortress, dated to [928/31] from the context .\n\nSymeon & his second wife had four children:\n\n2. daughter (before 913-) . The betrothal of this unnamed daughter, at the same time as her father's coronation as Tsar, is referred to by Fine, who says that it was arranged as part of the negotiated settlement with Prince Symeon after he invaded Byzantium, but was annulled by Empress Zoe after she seized the regency . The primary source which confirms this daughters parentage and betrothal has not been identified. It is assumed that the daughter would have been little more than a child at the time of her betrothal, considering the birth date of her betrothed. It is therefore likely that she was born from her father's second marriage. Betrothed (913, broken 913) to Emperor KONSTANTINOS VII, son of Emperor LEON VI & his fourth wife Zoe Karbonopsina (905-9 Nov 959).\n\n3.PETER (after [912]-29/30 Jan 969) . Theophanes Continuatus records that \"Symeon\" left Bulgaria to \"Petro filio ex secunda uxore\" . His birth date is estimated on the basis of his having been 15 years old at the most when he succeeded as Tsar in 927, considering that a regent was appointed. He succeeded his father in 927 as PETER I Tsar of the Bulgarians, his maternal uncle George Sursuval acting as regent.\n\n- see below.\n\n4.IVAN. Theophanes Continuatus names \"Ioannes et Beniamin Petri fratres\" . Cedrenus records that \"Petro Bulgarorum principi Joannes frater ipsius\" rebelled in Bulgaria, was captured and forcibly tonsured, but left for Constantinople where he renounced his vows and married, dated to [928/29] from the context . m (928 or after) ---. The name of Ivans wife is not known but her Armenian origin is confirmed by Theophanes Continuatus which records that \"Petro Bulgarorum principi Ioannes frater\" was welcomed at Constantinople and married \"Armeniacorum patria coniugem\" . No other information is known about Ivans wife. However, one somewhat outlandish scenario appears to reconcile the conflicts between the different primary sources, discussed below in Chapter 1.C relating to the parentage of the four Kometopoulos brothers: that Ivans anonymous Armenian wife married Nikolaos [Kumet] as her second husband, and that Aaron and Moisei were her sons by her first marriage to Ivan, while Samuil and David were born to her second husband. As noted below, it is considered that this possibility is too remote to justify recasting the presentation of the families in the present document.\n\n5.BAJAN [Beniamin]. Theophanes Continuatus names \"Ioannes et Beniamin Petri fratres\" . \"Baianum [et] Petrum\" are named as the two sons of Simeon by Liutprand, who specifies that the former studied magic and \"possessed the power to transform himself suddently into a wolf or other strange animal\" , although it is possible that \"Baianum\" may refer to one of the other known sons of Simeon, possibly Ivan, as this is the only reference which has been found to a son of this name.\n\nPETER, son of SYMEON I Tsar of the Bulgarians & his second wife --- [Sursuvul] (after [912]-29/30 Jan 969) . Theophanes Continuatus records that \"Symeon\" left Bulgaria to \"Petro filio ex secunda uxore\" . \"Baianum [et] Petrum\" are named as the two sons of Simeon by Liutprand . His birth date is estimated from his having been 15 years old at most when he succeeded as Tsar in 927, considering that a regent was appointed. He succeeded his father in 927 as PETER I Tsar of the Bulgarians, his maternal uncle George Sursuval acting as regent . He renewed the war with Byzantium after his accession and raided Thrace, but in Sep/Oct 927 made peace which including Byzantine confirmation of recognition of Bulgaria's borders established by the 897 and 904 treaties and of Peter's own title of Tsar. The treaty was sealed by Peter's marriage to the emperor's granddaughter . Although the monasteries flourished in Bulgaria under Tsar Peter, the ascetic Bogomilian sect, which rejected ecclesiastical rites and other traditional Christian beliefs, also gained popularity. Fine discusses the sect's beliefs and casts doubt on traditional views of the importance of this movement . In 965, Emperor Nikephoros Phokas refused to pay the annual tribute to Bulgaria, claiming that the payment was voided by the death of Tsar Peter's Byzantine wife. Nikephoros attacked Bulgarian border fortresses, then summoned Sviatoslav Grand Prince of Kiev to attack Bulgaria. The Grand Prince exceeded the terms of his mission by conquering Bulgaria in 967 and establishing a base at Pereiaslavets on the Danube delta . Tsar Peter appears to have suffered a stroke after this defeat, after which he abdicated and retired to a monastery where he died soon afterwards . Leo Diaconus records the death of \"Petrum ducem Moesorum\" during the reign of Emperor Nikephoros Phokas .\n\nm (Constantinople 8 Oct 927) MARIA Lekapene, daughter of co-Emperor CHRISTOFOROS Lekapenos & his wife Sofia --- ([920/25]-before 15 Mar 963). Theophanes Continuatus records the marriage of \"Christophori imperatoris filia Maria\" and \"Petri\" . Liutprand records the wife of Tsar Peter as the (unnamed) daughter of Christophoros, the marriage taking place just after the Tsar's accession after which she adopted the name IRINA . Considering the birth dates of her father and paternal grandfather, it is likely that Maria can have been no more than an infant at the time of her marriage in 927. The marriage was arranged to seal the peace agreed between her future husband and Byzantium . Her date of death is estimated by Zonaras recording that \"Petrus Bulgarorum princeps, uxore sua mortua\" sent their sons to Byzantium as hostages in order to renew the treaty . Cedrenus records the same event just after his passage recording the death of Emperor Romanos II (in 963) .\n\nPeter & his wife had two children:\n\n1.BORIS ([940/45]-[984/86]) . The birth date ranges of Boris and his brother Roman are estimated from the likely birth date of their mother. Zonaras records that \"Petrus Bulgarorum princeps, uxore sua mortua\" sent \"filios Borisem et Romanum\" to Byzantium as hostages . He nominally succeeded on his father's abdication, although the country's independence was still threatened by the presence of Sviatoslav Grand Prince of Kiev. He returned to Bulgaria, where he was proclaimed BORIS II Tsar of the Bulgarians at Preslav in [968] . Zonaras records that \"Borises Bulgarorum rex\" conquered Preslav but was defeated by \"Sphendosthlavus Russorum dux\" . Grand Prince Sviatoslav appears to have allowed Boris to continue to rule in a dependent capacity . Fearing that Sviatoslav would turn his attention to Byzantium, Emperor Ioannes Tzimisces marched into Bulgaria and fought Sviatoslav at Arcadiopolis . The emperor pushed further into Bulgaria in 971, captured Preslav and defeated the Grand Prince's forces at Silistria, before negotiating Sviatoslav's withdrawal . Emperor Ioannes at first recognised Boris II as Prince of Bulgaria, but proceeded to annex the country, converted it into a theme of the empire, abolished the Bulgarian patriarchy and took Boris back to Constantinople as a prisoner where he became a Byzantine magister and patrikios. During this period, western Bulgaria (Macedonia) remained untouched by these events, and witnessed the uprising of the Kometopoulos brothers (see Part C below) after the death of Emperor Ioannes in 976 . Boris left Byzantium some time after this Macedonian uprising. The exact timing is uncertain: if Boris's death in [984/86] is correct, his departure could hardly have been a reaction to the Macedonian uprising of 976. Fine points out that it is not known whether he escaped or was released by the Byzantines in the hope of triggering civil war in Bulgaria . He was killed by Bulgarian border guards in [984/86], supposedly in error . m (after 963) ---. The name of Tsar Boris's wife is not known. The date of this marriage is estimated on the assumption that it took place when he was no longer a hostage in Constantinople, hostages being traditionally unmarried at the time. Cedrenus refers to Emperor Ioannes Tzimisces finding \"cum coniuge et liberis Borises Bulgarorum rex\" among the Russian prisoners when he invaded Bulgaria . Boris & his wife had [two or more] children:\n\na) children (before 971-). Cedrenus refers to Emperor Ioannes Tzimisces finding \"cum coniuge et liberis Borises Bulgarorum rex\" among the Russian prisoners when he invaded Bulgaria.\n\n2.ROMAN ([940/45]-Constantinople [997/98]) . The birth date ranges of Boris and his brother Roman are estimated from the likely birth date of their mother. Zonaras records that \"Petrus Bulgarorum princeps, uxore sua mortua\" sent \"filios Borisem et Romanum\" to Byzantium as hostages . He was a prisoner in a Kievan jail in Preslav in 969/71. After Byzantium annexed Bulgaria in 971, Roman was imprisoned in Constantinople until [984/86], which seems to have been the time he was made a eunuch. Zonaras records that \"Petri filio Romano\" was a eunuch . He succeeded in escaping from Constantinople with his brother (see above concerning the timing of this escape). He appears to have arrived successfully in Bulgaria and succeeded his brother in [984/86] as titular Tsar of the Bulgarians. It is not clear whether Roman fulfilled any actual role in the government or whether the four Kometopoulos brothers were the only effective rulers in the country at the time . Cedrenus names \"Romanus, Petri Bulgarorum regis filius, Borisæ frater, Simeon etiam avi nomine appellatus\" when recording that Samuil had appointed him \"præfectus\" of \"urbem Scopias\" which he delivered to the emperor, who rewarded him with the title \"patricium\" and \"præpositumque Abydoque\" . Governor of Abydos.\n\nC. TSARS of the BULGARIANS 997-1018 and 1040-1041 (KOMETOPOULOI)\n\nNIKOLAOS [Nikola] [Kumet], son of --- (-[976] or before) . Samuil, later Tsar of Bulgaria, names \"my father, my mother, my brother Nicolas --- and David\" in a monument erected in [992/93] . The evidence for his supposed Armenian origin is provided by the Armenian historian Asolik, who refers to \"deux frères qui sappelaient Komsajag laîné Samuel, de nationalité arménienne, originaire du canton de Derĵan\" (on the Euphrates, west of Erzerum), adds that Emperor Basilieos had brought them with mercenary troops to Macedonia to fight the Bulgars, that they defected \"au roi des Bulgares, qui était eunuque\" (referring to Roman, see above), and that \"les Comitopoules occupèrent la pays bulgare et entrèrent en guerre acharnée contre lempereur\" . While it is clear that Samuils mothers name was Armenian (see below), the same cannot be said for Nikolaos, although it is possible that this was not his original name. No other information is known about Samuils father, or his more distant ancestry, but their family background was presumably modest in light of the passage from Asolik which is quoted above. It is assumed that he died before the revolt organised by his sons as he is not named in the primary sources in connection with this event.\n\nm RIPSIME, daughter of --- (-before [992/93]). Samuil, later Tsar of Bulgaria, names \"my father, my mother, my brother Nicolas --- and David\" in a monument erected in [992/93] . Adontz quotes the monument (in Bulgarian) in full, including Samuils mothers name. However, on the subsequent page he states that \"du nom de la mère il ne reste que la dernière lettre\" and that \"Michel de Devol permet de le rétablir en témoignant que le père de Samuel sappelait Nicolas et la mère Ριψίμη\" . Unfortunately, he gives no citation for this statement but on an earlier page quotes a passage inserted in another text written by \"Michel évêque de Devol\", and cites a German secondary source although it is not at all clear from what he writes that this is where the passage naming Samuils mother can be found . No other information is known about Ripsimé. However, one somewhat outlandish scenario appears to reconcile the conflicts between the different primary sources, discussed below under Ripsimés supposed son Aaron, which relate to the parentage of her supposed four sons: that Ripsimé was the anonymous Armenian wife of Ivan, brother of Tsar Peter I, who married Nikolaos as her second husband, and that Aaron and Moisei were her sons by her first marriage, while Samuil and David were born to her second husband. This possibility seems too remote to justify recasting the presentation of the families in the present document.\n\nNikola Kumet & his wife had [five] children:\n\n1. [AARON (-murdered Ramatanitze 14 Jul [987/88]) . Zonaras records that \"Bulgaricis quatuor filii, David, Moses, Aaron et Samuel\" encouraged the Bulgarians to revolt against Byzantine control . Cedrenus records that \"Davidus, Moses, Aaron et Samuelis, filii cuiusdam in Bulgaria largiter potentis comitis\" rebelled against Byzantium after the death of Tsar Peter . Aarons parentage appears confirmed by Zonaras and Cedrenus, read together with the monumental inscription quoted below which names the father of the brothers Samuil and David. The assumption therefore is that Aaron and Moisei were both brothers of Samuil and David. This is corroborated by Psellos who names \"Samuel and his brother Aaron \" . On the other hand, Adontz suggests that Aaron and Moisei were in fact the sons of Ivan, brother of Tsar Peter I (see above). Firstly, he cites Yahya of Antioch, according to whom \"Aaron appartenait à la race qui avait regné sur la Bulgarie\" . Secondly, he highlights the omission of Aaron and Moisei from the inscription on the monument erected by Samuil. He concludes by suggesting that his hypothesis would explain the rivalry between the two families which resulted in the murders of Aaron by Samuil and of Gavriil Radomir by Ivan Vladislav. However, he ignores the sources which indicate a fraternal relationship, Zonaras and Psellos quoted above, as well as Lupus Protospatarius who refers to Samuils sons killer as \"suo consobrino filio Aronis\" . The different sources are therefore contradictory. Detailed speculation on which hypothesis may be correct does not appear worthwhile. It can, however, be mentioned in passing that a third scenario would conform with all the sources: that the four brothers shared the same mother, who married firstly Ivan and secondly Nikolaos. This possibility is too remote to recast the presentation of the families in this document. In conclusion, Aaron is shown in this document in square brackets to indicate doubt about his parentage. Zonaras records that \"quatuor fratribus Davidi, Mosi, Aaroni et Samueli qui Comitopoli appellabantur\" defeated the Byzantine forces, adding that \"fratrem Aaronem cum omni familia\" was killed by Samuil, with the exception of \"uno filio Joannes Sphandosthlavus\" .] m ---.

Cedrenus records that \"Davidus, Moses, Aaron et Samuelis, filii cuiusdam in Bulgaria largiter potentis comitis\" rebelled against Byzantium after the death of Tsar Peter . Moiseis parentage appears confirmed by Zonaras and Cedrenus, read together with the monumental inscription quoted below which names the father of the brothers Samuil and David. The assumption therefore is that Aaron and Moisei were both brothers of Samuil and David. As noted above, Adontz suggests that Aaron and Moisei were in fact the sons of Ivan, brother of Tsar Peter I (see above), although he cites no primary source naming Moisei on which he relies . Zonaras records that \"quatuor fratribus Davidi, Mosi, Aaroni et Samueli qui Comitopoli appellabantur\" defeated the Byzantine forces, adding that Moisei was killed \"in opugnatione Serræ\" . Cedrenus records that \"Moisis\" was killed in battle \"at Serras\" .]\n\n3.SAMUIL (-Prilep 6 Oct 1014) . Zonaras records that \"Bulgaricis quatuor filii, David, Moses, Aaron et Samuel\" encouraged the Bulgarians to revolt against Byzantine control . Cedrenus records that \"Davidus, Moses, Aaron et Samuelis, filii cuiusdam in Bulgaria largiter potentis comitis\" rebelled against Byzantium after the death of Tsar Peter . Samuil, later Tsar of Bulgaria, names \"my father, my mother, my brother Nicolas --- and David\" in a monument erected in [992/93] . Adontz highlights two spurious charters, fabricated in the 16th and late 18th/early 19th centuries respectively, from which it was wrongly deduced by some historians that Samuil was the son of Siman . Zonaras records that \"quatuor fratribus Davidi, Mosi, Aaroni et Samueli qui Comitopoli appellabantur\" defeated the Byzantine forces . He conquered Thessaly in 986, defeated a Byzantine army at Sardika [Sofija] and reconquered the territory of the original Bulgarian state as well as the region of Thessaloniki, after which he conquered Durazzo in [996] . In 997, he conquered Duklja, Trebinje and Zahumlje, and reduced Bosnia and Raka [Serbia] to vassals of Bulgaria. He was crowned SAMUIL Tsar of the Bulgarians in 997, with his capital at Prespa. He moved his capital to Ochrida, where he restored the Bulgarian Patriarch Damian . In [1000/1001], Byzantium under Emperor Basileios II launched a counter-offensive against Bulgaria, and recaptured Sardika (1001), Macedonia, Thessaly, Vidin and Skoplje (1004), and Durazzo (1005), the last following the betrayal by Samuil's son-in-law. Samuil's army was crushed in Jul 1014 at Clidion, near Strymon, although Tsar Samuil escaped to Prilep where he died soon afterwards . Cedrenus records this defeat 20 Jul \"indictione 12\" and Samuils escape to \"castellum Prilapum\" where he died two days later .

The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"Voislav\" married \"the niece of emperor Samuel\" by whom he had five sons \"Goyslav, Michael, Saganec, Radoslav and Predimir\" . The word \"niece\", presumably translated from \"neptis\", could be interpreted either as niece or granddaughter. Europäische Stammtafeln , presumably on the basis that granddaughter is the appropriate translation, suggests that Vojislav's wife was the daughter of Gavriil Radomir Tsar of the Bulgarians & his second wife. If this is correct, Vojislav's wife must have been born in [990/1000], which would place the birth of the couple's sons in [1015/25]. In this case, she was presumably one of the two unnamed daughters whom Cedrenus records as having submitted to Emperor Basileios II in 1018 along with other members of the family (see above). If \"niece\" is the correct translation, Vojislav's wife could have been the niece either of Tsar Samuil himself or of his wife. The latter possibility could account for the confusion relating to the wife of Vojislav's first cousin Ivan Vladimir, who is stated by Europäische Stammtafeln to be the niece of Tsar Samuil's wife (see above), assuming that there was also confusion in the primary sources between Ivan Vladimir and his cousin Vojislav. In this second case, the birth of the couple's sons could be placed much earlier. m VOJISLAV of Duklja, son of [DRAGOMIR Knez of Duklja and part Trebinje & his wife --- of Serbia] (-[1043], bur Prapratna).

The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records the marriage of \"Vladimir\" and \"Cossara\", daughter of Samuil Tsar of the Bulgarians , but it is likely that this source confuses her with Samuils daughter Miroslava as it recounts a story similar to that of Ashot Taronites falling in love with Miroslava while held captive by her father. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Kosara was daughter of Theodoros Chryselios, whose sister married Tsar Samuil, although the primary source on which this is based has not been identified. It appears likely that the name \"Kosara\" is in any case a deformation of \"Chryselie\" and that the name of Ivan Vladimirs wife is in fact unknown. m ([998]) IVAN VLADIMIR Knez of Duklja, son of PETRISLAV Knez of Duklja [Montenegro] & his wife --- (-murdered Prespa 22 May 1016, bur Krajina).]\n\nd) [daughter .

Cedrenus records that Emperor Basileios entered \"Ionium apud Eilisson castellum caput totius Bulgariæ\", appointed \"Eustathium patricium Daphnomelum\" as governor, and received the submission of \"Joannis Bladisthlabi viduam cum filiis tribus et sex filiabus et duas filias Radomeri, filii Samueli, ac filios quinque\" (of whom one had been blinded by \"Joanne\") .

Zonaras records that \"Prusianus cum duobus fratribus\" resisted the Byzantines in the mountains, adding that he was later created \"magistrum patricios\" . The fact that Fruin is the only son named in these two sources suggests that he was the eldest. He became strategos of the theme of Bukellarion.

Her parentage is confirmed by Nikephoros Bryennios who records that \"uxor Andronici\" was \"genus a Samuele Bulgarorum rege, e cuius filio Troianne nata ipsa erat\", adding that \"materna vero ei prosapia referebatur ad Contostephanos, Aballantes et Phocadas\" . The Alexeiad records that \"the daughter-in-law of the Cæsar Ioannes protovestiaria\" was imprisoned \"in the nunnery of Petrion near the Sidera\" when the Komnenoi plot against Emperor Nikephoros Botaneiates was discovered, referring to her as \"kinswoman\" of Anna Dalassena and, in a later passage, stating that she \"was of Bulgarian descent\" . Protobestiaria. She became a nun as XENE. She received a letter from Leon ex-metropolitan of Chalcedonia dated to 1089/[1094/95] . The typikon of Theotokos Kecharitomenes (dated to [1110]) provides for the commemoration 21 Nov of \"la...princesse et mère de ma Majesté, kyra Marie, qui fut appelée...kyra Xénè\" . The list of obituaries of the monastery of Christ Philanthropos, founded by Empress Eirene Doukas, records the death 21 Nov of \"Xenes monaxes tes metros tes ayias despoines tes protobestiarisses\" . m ([before 1061]) ANDRONIKOS Dukas, protobestiarios, son of IOANNES Dukas & his wife Eirene Pegonitissa (-14 Oct [1077]).

[EKATERINA (-convent of Myrelaion after 1061) . Her parentage is indicated by Cedrenus, who names \"Aarone Duca magistro magistro, fratre uxoris Comneni\" (although the origin of his being named \"Doukas\" has not been ascertained), and by Nikephoros Bryennios who records that \"Isaacio\" married \"maxima natu filiarum Samuelis regis Bulgarorum Aecatharinæ\" . It is chronologically improbable for Ekaterina to have been the daughter of Tsar Samuil, whose marriage is recorded in 970 (see above). It is suggested therefore that she was the daughter of Samuil's successor, Ivan Vladislav, and that \"Aarone Duca\" named by Cedrenus was Ivan Vladislavs son. She brought a substantial dowry to her husband . Skylitzes records that advice from \"Æcaterina Augusta\" helped her husband decide on his abdication and that she \"eiusque filia Maria\" were tonsured \"in palatiis Myrelæi\" (the convent of Myrelaion), adding in a later passage that Empress Ekaterina adopted the monastic name HELENA .

Psellos names \"a political agitator Dolianus\" who \"proceeded to trace his descent from the famous Samuel and his brother Aaron [although] he did not claim to be the legitimate heir of these kings but he either invented or proved that he was a collateral relation\" and was proclaimed king . Zonaras records that \"Dolianus\" claimed to be \"filium naturalem, non legitimum Aaronis frater Samuelis\" and was chosen as king by the Bulgarians . He was crowned PETER DELJAN Tsar of Bulgaria in Beograd in 1040. Cedrenus records that \"Petrus quidam Bulgarus, cognomento Deleanus\" captured \"Morabum et Belegrados\" and was declared \"regem Bulgariæ\", dated to [1040] from the context . His forces pushed southwards to capture Ni and Skopje. He joined forces with a second rebellion in Durazzo led by Tihomir, who was murdered in Skopje maybe through Deljan's planning. He then captured Prespa and parts of northern Greece . His [supposed] second cousin Alusian joined the rebellion and was given troops to attack Thessaloniki, but failed in the enterprise which created divisions between the two men. Alusian's troops captured and blinded Deljan, enabling Alusian to assume leadership of the whole movement which quickly collapsed after he defected to Byzantium.\n\n2.TIHOMIR (-murdered Skopje [1041]).

The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names (in order) \"Vladimir, Priaslav, Sergius, Deria, Gabriel, Miroslav and Bodin\" as the seven sons of Mihailo . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"Bodin who [afterwards] ruled the whole kingdom [and] Vladimir with their brothers marched into Rassa and annexed it\" and \"captured the whole of Bulgaria which King Michael gave to his son Bodin to rule as a province\" . In 1072, his father sent him to lead troops to the rebellion of George Vojteh against the Byzantines in Macedonia. On his way, he was crowned PETER Tsar of the Bulgarians at Prizren in late 1072. Skylitzes names \"Bulgariæ princeps Michaelem\" and \"suo filio Constantino, cui Bodino cognomen erat\", dated to [1073/75] . The rebellion was crushed by Byzantium, Bodin was defeated south of Skopje, captured and banished to Asia Minor where he remained until ransomed [1078] . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that Bodin declared himself emperor which triggered an invasion from Byzantium, during which Bodin was captured and sent to Antioch in exile .

The primary source which confirms his original name Teodor has not been identified. After attempting unsuccessfully to obtain land in the Haemus mountains from Emperor Isaakios II, they rebelled against Byzantine rule in 1185, with Bulgar, Vlach and Kuman support. Teodor adopted the name PETER, in honour of Peter I Tsar of the Bulgarians, and was proclaimed PETER Tsar of the Bulgarians in 1186. After the 1186 rebellion of Alexios Branas, who had been sent to suppress the Bulgarian revolt, Emperor Isaakios led his army personally against the Bulgarian rebels and drove them across the Danube. Further campaigns followed in Sep 1187 and 1188, but the emperor was forced to recognise Bulgarian independence under a peace treaty signed in 1188 . Tsar Peter retained Trnovo as his capital and unilaterally promoted the bishop of Trnovo as archbishop, although the appointment was not recognised by Byzantium. He was crowned Tsar by the newly appointed archbishop Basil, maybe jointly with his brother Ivan Asen. By early 1190, Peter had relinquished control to his brother, although he continued to rule as a colleague in Preslav .

He was sent as a hostage to Constantinople in 1188 as part of the arrangements for the peace treaty which recognised Bulgarian independence . He was awarded the title patrikios in Byzantium. Co-Regent of Bulgaria in 1196. He succeeded in 1197 as KALOJAN I Tsar of the Bulgarians, and was crowned by the archbishop of Trnovo. He agreed peace with Byzantium in [1201/02] , and was again created patrikios. Tsar Kalojan annexed the region of Ni from Serbia in 1203, and Beograd, Braničevo and Vidin from Hungary in [1204]. Pope Innocent III supported him by ordering Imre King of Hungary not to counter-attack, Kalojan having promised to recognise papal suzerainty in return for a papal crown . He also took advantage of the chaos caused by the taking of Constantinople by the army of the Fourth Crusade in 1204 to assume control of Byzantine territory in Macedonia and Thrace . He was crowned King of all Bulgarians and Wallachians by the Papal legate 7 Nov 1204, at the same time as the archbishop of Trnovo was consecrated primate . The crusaders rejected Tsar Kalojan's proposed alliance and division of territory in Thrace. Kalojan in revenge launched further attacks on Thrace in Feb 1205, and captured Adrianople. He defeated Baudouin I Latin Emperor of Constantinople 14 Apr 1205, and took him back to Bulgaria as a prisoner where the emperor died in jail . Georgius Akropolites records that \"Balduinus imperator\" was captured by \"regem Bulgarorum Ioannem\" .

Gardner says that \"report attributed the act to the device of his wife and the hand of a Kuman warrior\" . m [firstly] ---. The name of Kalojan's first wife is not known. If Georgius Akropolites is correctly interpreted as indicating that Kalojan married a \"Scythian\" (see below), the text implies that the alliance was contracted not long before he died. If this is correct, his supposed Scythian wife is unlikely to have been the mother of his children, which points to an otherwise unrecorded first marriage. [m secondly as her first husband, ---, a Kuman princess. Georgius Akropolites records that \"Scylo-Ioannes (Σκυλοϊωάννης)\" contracted an alliance with \"Scythas\", which could be interpreted as meaning that he married a Scythian but this is not without doubt .

It is assumed that he was the son of a sister of the brothers Ivan Asen, Peter and Kalojan as no reference has been found to a fourth brother. He succeeded his uncle in 1207 as BORIL Tsar of the Bulgarians, passing over the rightful candidate, his first cousin Ivan Asen, and married his predecessor's widow to consolidate his authority. He was faced with continual rebellions, in particular those led by his cousin Alexii Slav and his [supposed] brother Strez. Many outlying territories in Bulgaria split away from the central authority of Trnovo. After invading Thrace, he was defeated by a Latin army at Philippopolis in 1208 . He allied himself with Henri Latin Emperor of Constantinople in 1213, sealed by the emperor's marriage to Tsar Boril's step-daughter . He was deposed in 1218 by his cousin Ivan Asen and blinded.

He opposed the succession of his [supposed] brother Boril in 1207, was expelled and fled to the Serbian court from where, supported by Stefan Grand upan of Serbia, he invaded Bulgaria and established himself in the fortress of Prosek. He established his own state between the Struma and Vardar rivers, and expanded westwards across Macedonia as far as Bitola. He allied himself with Tsar Boril, who appears to have awarded him the title sébastokrator. Their joint armies were defeated by Mikhael of Epirus at Pelagonia [Bitola] in early summer 1211 .
