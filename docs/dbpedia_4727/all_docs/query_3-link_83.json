The rear camera is 13-megapixels and offers dual flash, while the front-facing snapper maxes out at 5-megapixels.\n\nIt’ll arrive unlocked in “mid-June” priced at €199.90 (~$220) across the whole of Europe, the company says. There’s no word on when it might make its way to US markets though.\n\nThe two companies said they were now working together on a “convergent device” for the future too.\n\nWe’ll be putting the Aquaris E5 HD Ubuntu Edition through its paces next week, so check back for our full review."
