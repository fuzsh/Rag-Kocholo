        "text": "Both ASP and PHP are languages used to build Dynamic Web sites that can interact with Databases and exchange information. ASP (Active Server Pages) is from Microsoft and is used with IIS (Internet Information Server) that runs on Microsoft Servers. PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is from Rasmus Lerdorf, who originally designed this parsing language which was later modified by different people. It runs on Unix and Linux servers and it also has an NT server version.\n\nThere are a lot of differences between ASP and PHP.\n\nCost\n\nTo run ASP programs one needs IIS installed on a Windows platform server, which is not free. PHP programs run on Linux, which is free. Even the connectivity of the database is expensive in the case of ASP as MS-SQL is a product of Microsoft that needs to be purchased. PHP generally uses MySQL, which is freely available.\n\nSpeed\n\nIf we compare the speed of ASP and PHP then PHP has an upper hand. PHP code runs faster than ASP. ASP is built on COM based architecture, which is an overhead for the server whereas PHP code runs in its own memory space.\n\nPlatform Compatibility\n\nPHP programs can run on various platforms like Linux, Unix, Windows and Solaris whereas ASP is mainly associated with Windows platforms. However, ASP can run on a Linux platform with ASP-Apache installed on the server.\n\nAdditional Costs\n\nMany of the tools used in PHP are free of cost and since PHP is open source a lot of code can be found in open source forums. PHP has inbuilt features like ftp, email from a web page or even encryption mechanisms but in ASP such features are not built in and some additional components are required. Therefore an additional cost is incurred for such components.\n\nBase Language\n\nPHP is based on C++ language and the syntax used in PHP is quite similar to C/C++. C/C++ is still considered the best programming language by many programmers and people who love this language would surely feel more comfortable with the syntax of PHP. ASP on the other hand has a more Visual Basic kind of syntax that again is closely related to only Microsoft products. So, it depends on a person-to-person which language he or she is comfortable\n\nDatabase Connectivity\n\nPHP, being extremely flexible, can connect to various databases, the most popular being MySQL. ASP mainly uses MS-SQL\n\nPHP and MySQL combine to be an easy yet powerful way to create dynamic web pages that actually interact with your visitors. HTML can create useful and well formatted web pages. With the addition of PHP and MySQL you can collect data from your users, create specific content on the fly, and do many other things that HTML alone can’t do.\n\nThe beauty of PHP as a language is that it is designed to be used along with HTML.\n\nYou can use PHP right inside your already existing HTML content, or put HTML tags right inside your PHP coding. When learning PHP you are not making your existing HTML knowledge obsolete, you are instead adding to it to give it more functions and abilities.\n\nPHP is a scripting language that is often embedded into HTML to add functions HTML alone can’t do. PHP allows you to collect, process and utilize data to create a desired output. In short, it let’s you interact with your pages.\n\nPHP is able to preform a number of tasks including printing data, making numeric calculations (such as addition or multiplication), making comparisons (which is bigger, are they equal, etc) and making simple boolean choices.\n\nFrom this you can create more complex loops and functions to make your page generate more specialized data.\n\nFAQ about PHP AND MYSQL\n\nEthical hacking and ethical hacker are terms used to describe hacking performed by a company or individual to help identify potential threats on a computer or network. An ethical hacker attempts to bypass system security and search for any weak points that could be exploited by malicious hackers. This information is then used by the organization to improve the system security, in an effort to minimize or eliminate any potential attacks.\n\nWhat constitutes ethical hacking?\n\nFor hacking to be deemed ethical, the hacker must obey the following rules:\n\nExpressed (often written) permission to probe the network and attempt to identify potential security risks.\n\nYou respect the individual’s or company’s privacy.\n\nYou close out your work, not leaving anything open for you or someone else to exploit at a later time.\n\nYou let the software developer or hardware manufacturer know of any security vulnerabilities you locate in their software or hardware, if not already known by the company.\n\nThe term \"ethical hacker\" has received criticism at times from people who say that there is no such thing as an \"ethical\" hacker. Hacking is hacking, no matter how you look at it and those who do the hacking are commonly referred to as computer criminals or cyber criminals. However, the work that ethical hackers do for organizations has helped improve system security and can be said to be quite effective and successful. Individuals interested in becoming an ethical hacker can work towards a certification to become a Certified Ethical Hacker, or CEH. This certification is provided by the International Council of E-Commerce Consultants (EC-Council). The exam itself costs about $500 to take and consists of 125 multiple-choice questions in version 8 of the test (version 7 consisted of 150 multiple-choice questions).\n\nThe Intel Compute Stick (ICS) is perhaps best thought of as the mutant offspring of a Raspberry Pi on steroids and Google Chromecast. The offspring emerges as a tiny computer CPU, RAM and storage on a small motherboard contained within a reasonably well finished case. Protruding from the case is a HDMI male adapter ready to plug into any display boasting its female counterpart.\n\nThe ICS is a full working PC with Windows 8.1 for Bing a quad core Atom processor Z3735F running at up to 1.83 GHz, 2 GB memory, 32 GB of on-board storage, b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth and a microSD card slot. An Ubuntu version shaves the RAM to 1GB and storage to 8GB. The RAM’s soldered on so forget upgrades and ponder buying the Windows version and installing Ubuntu rather than making do with a wimpily-specced machine. Not many people complain about having ‘too much storage’.\n\nIf you like lots of USB ports on your devices, then you’d better invest in a USB hub. There’s only a single USB 2.0 port on the ICS, but this is due to the very limited real estate on the stick – size always counts, regardless what your mother told you.\n\nThe ICS has an active airflow design, as it sucks in air at one end, goes over a heatsink and then blows it out the other. To its credit, the fan can barely be heard when idling (I wasn’t actually sure if it was on or not). When under bigger load, I could hear the fan a little bit, but only being in a dead silent room. For a device like this that will be hidden away behind a screen, I’d rather it was more compact and a little more grunt with a fan, than completely fanless.\n\nThe Wireless and Bluetooth capabilities are a must have, as you probably don’t want your stick to end up looking like a deformed octopus. Although the wireless works quite well, it may not be enough if you’re streaming high amounts of data, such as 3D graphics. I found it to work perfectly on using a remote desktop/thin client at the standard 1920 x 1080 resolution, and still works fine for Netflix in HD, but those two mediums are going to be more latency and missing packet friendly than some other streaming functions.\n\nOut of the box, you can plug one end into your visual device of choice through its HDMI port, and provide it power through the micro USB port. The power plug provided puts out power at 2A, which seems to be the standard in newer smart phones and tablets these days. It still seemed to run fine when plugged into a 1A USB port too, which you too can try if you like to live dangerously. As a note, the device can’t be powered over HDMI. There is hope that Intel will implement this in future versions of the stick.\n\nShared By :\n\nSOW KISHORE N\n\nIn February of this year, BQ, the European technology company, launched the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition, the world´s first smartphone featuring the Ubuntu operating system\n\nThis latest model, the Aquaris E5 HD Ubuntu Edition, marks the second handset collaboration between Canonical and BQ; now working together on the launch of a convergent device.\n\nBQ and Canonical today jointly announce the launch of the Aquaris E5 HD Ubuntu Edition which follows on from the successful launch of the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition earlier this year.\n\nThe new device comes with a host of impressive features including a 5’’ display with IPS HD technology, HD screen resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels and 380 cd/m2 maximum brightness. It also includes a MediaTek Quad Core Cortex A7 processor that runs at up to 1.3 GHz, an internal memory of 16 GB and 1 GB RAM. Additionally, it features a 5 megapixel front camera and 13 megapixel rear camera, equipped with high quality Largan lenses and BSI sensors. Other features of note include dual flash and Full HD video recording (1080p).\n\nAs with all BQ smartphones, the Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Edition comes fully unlocked with dual SIM functionality so that users have the freedom to select their operator of choice and can use SIMs from two different operators.\n\nThe success of the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition coupled with the commitment to the operating system, has inspired BQ to launch the new Aquaris E5 HD Ubuntu Edition. According to Alberto Méndez, CEO of BQ, “We have devised the BQ-Canonical collaboration as a long term project. Our next objective, which we are already working on, is convergence. We firmly believe in Ubuntu and the philosophy behind it”.\n\nCristian Parrino, VP Mobile at Canonical, remarks “Bringing a new operating system to market requires partners who are willing to challenge the status quo of the mobile industry. BQ is a fearless innovator whose risk with Ubuntu has already paid off – the launch of this second device in Europe marks an amazing milestone for both companies.”\n\n“Working with Canonical on bringing the Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Edition has been very satisfying. We share the same philosophy as them along with the same commitment to the Open Source Initiative. At BQ, our goal is to help people understand technology, encourage them to use it and inspire them to create it. That´s why the opportunity for creation that Ubuntu affords is fundamentally important to us”, notes Alberto Méndez."
