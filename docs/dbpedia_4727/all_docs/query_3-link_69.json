        "text": "New Delhi: Almost a year after Ubuntu developer Canonical joined hands with Meizu and BQ to manufacture handsets with the Linux-based OS installed on them, the company has now announced its plans to release the world's first Ubuntu smartphone - the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition.\n\nBuilt by BQ, the yet-to-be launched Ubuntu phone is basically a repurposed version of the company's mid-range Android handset Aquaris E4.5. In other words, BQ has adapted its Android smartphone Aquaris E4.5 to run Ubuntu.\n\nPriced at 169.90 euros ($193), the world's first Ubuntu phone will be available across Europe from BQ.com through a series of flash sales over the coming weeks. The date, time and URL for the first flash sale will be announced through @Ubuntu and @bqreaders on Twitter as well as Ubuntu G+ and Ubuntu Facebook within the next week.\n\n\"Ubuntu presents users with an entirely different way to engage with their devices - Scopes guide you to content you want - in the same way you think about it - to deliver a smooth, engaging experience,\" says Cristian Parrino, VP Mobile at Canonical.\n\nThe Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition is dual SIM and completely unlocked so consumers can use it with their current network.\n\nThe phone has a 4.5-inch display, 8GB internal storage (expandable), 5-megapixel front camera, and an 8-megapixel rear camera with autofocus and dual flash. Under its hood is a a 1.3GHz MediaTek quad-core Cortex A7 processor coupled with 1GB of RAM. The new smartphone will be available in black.\n\nCanonical and BQ are said to have worked with a host of partners to ensure that there is a wealth of interesting, relevant and dynamic content available at launch, with more content partners to follow.\n\n####"
