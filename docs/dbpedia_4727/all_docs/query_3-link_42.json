        "text": "How will it change my life?\n\nFor a long time, consumers have been fed a staple diet of iOS, Android and Windows via their smartphones. The Linux community's wish for an Ubuntu-powered smartphone has finally been answered in the shape of the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition from BQ.\n\nGood points?\n\nThe design is pleasantly surprising for a budget level phone. The slightly smaller rectangle iPhone 4-esque shape makes it feel easy to handle and operate without stretching uncomfortably. It's sturdy enough that you won't worry about dropping it, with a plastic back which absorbs shocks well but still looks stylish.\n\nThe Ubuntu interface is slick, intuitive and gives a more flexible and personable experience thanks to what the makers call scopes. Scopes are screens that display App content in one place without having to open multiple programs.\n\nYou no longer need to swipe between endless screens to find the content as it is all presented perfectly. With the launcher menu, even your applications are always only two touches away. Canonical, which produces Ubuntu, are bringing their desktop OS know how to mobile devices and have adapted it seamlessly.\n\nTwo Sim card slots are provided to give even more flexibility with what network you choose for any situation such as having personal and work numbers. The battery life is one aspect of the hardware which performs beyond expectation with one charge easily lasting several days of moderate usage.\n\nBad points?\n\nSadly, the innovative operating system from Canonical has not been given the platform to shine on the BQ Aquaris.\n\nSlow to perform basic tasks after prolonged usage you can really notice the hardware struggling to cope. The 960 x 540 resolution screen at 4.5 inches is hardly conducive to media enjoyment.\n\nBest for ...\n\nThose with tight purse strings or the niche group who have been eagerly awaiting the popular Linux OS makers foray into smartphones.\n\nAvoid if ...\n\nYou won't compromise on performance as the Meizu have released the Ubuntu MX4 with better specifications.\n\nScore: 6/10, a budget phone with great OS that is hampered by sub-par hardware.\n\nBQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition, Â£120 (bq.com)"
