        "text": "A brand new Ubuntu Phone will go on sale in Europe next Tuesday, June 9th, we can reveal.\n\nThe Bq Aquaris E5 is the second Ubuntu Phone to made by Spanish device company Bq Readers. It will retail online in Europe at €199.90.\n\nIt follows the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition launched in February and is, once again, a repurposed version of an existing Android handset.\n\nWhy a new device so soon? The enthusiasm, feedback and hype to greet their first device was so strong they began working on a follow-up a few weeks later. That device, the Aquaris E5, is now almost ready to buy.\n\nMeet the Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Edition\n\nBigger, faster and a touch more expensive than the earlier E4.5 phone, the Bq Aquaris E5 reads like a great mid-range smartphone.\n\nIt will sit nearer the low-end E4.5 device rathe than the upcoming eight-core Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition, which also launches in Europe this month, but is still a respectable device.\n\nIt also won’t feel as high end as the MX4 (which has a swanky aluminium alloy casing) but the plastic casing is sturdy and attractive. It’s also €100 cheaper than Meizu’s offering.\n\nOverall the device should be a decent ‘in’ to the Ubuntu Phone experience, possibly bettering that of the Aquaris E4.5 thanks to the larger screen, roomy internal storage and a better battery.\n\nA pair of improved cameras will deliver crisper photos and the bump to a 5-inch HD display will show them off perfectly.\n\nBq Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Edition Specs\n\nBq Aquaris E5 smartphone uses a Mediatek MT6582 processor running at 1.3GHz paired with (a decent) GPU and 1GB of RAM.\n\nYes, this phone has the same core specs as the E4.5.\n\nThe 16GB of internal storage is bump up and should be sufficient for most (if rather modest for the price) and the inclusion of a MicroSD card slot supporting SD cards of up-to 32GB will please many.\n\nThe 5-inch IPS screen has a HD resolution (1280 x 720p) at a respectable 294 pixels per inch. It’s coated in ‘dragon trail’ glass — which sounds cool if nothing else!\n\n4G is not supported by this handset (as was the case with the E4.5) but there is dual SIM support.\n\nAquaris E5\n\n5-inch IPS screen (1280 x 720 pixels, 294 ppi)\n\nMediaTek MT6582 CPU @ 1.3 GHz (quad-core)\n\n16GB eMMC storage\n\n1GB RAM\n\n13 MP rear camera, 5MP front-facing\n\n2500 mAh battery\n\nAquaris E4.5\n\n4.5-inch IPS screen (540×960, 240 ppi)\n\nMediaTek MT6582 CPU @ 1.3GHz (quad-core)\n\n8GB eMMC Storage\n\n1GB RAM\n\n8 MP rear camera, 5MP front-facing\n\n2150 mAh battery\n\nIntrigued? We’ve a few more details below.\n\nWhen Can I Buy It?\n\nSpanish phone makers Bq will sell the E5 Ubuntu Edition on their website directly — yep, no more flash sales — from next Tuesday, June 9th.\n\nMore details on the device will be blasted at willing media outlets during the next week through press releases.\n\nHow Much Will It Cost?\n\nA not-too-shabby €199.90 (excluding shipping and fees), which is €9 less than the equivalent Android model costs (but €30 more than the 4.5-inch version).\n\nI own the Android version: can I flash Ubuntu to it?\n\nMost likely; Bq devices are easy to unlock, the hardware is identical between Android and Ubuntu editions (though do note that not all features can or will work under Ubuntu) and flashable images are made available.\n\nAgain, don’t assume that this will be the case and, if attempting, be aware that bricking your device is entirely possible."
