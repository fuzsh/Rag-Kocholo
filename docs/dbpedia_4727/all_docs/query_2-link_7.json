        "text": "Canonical, the company behind the Linux-based Ubuntu open-source platform, has announced what it’s calling “the world’s first Ubuntu phone”. The Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition is being produced in partnership with Spanish electronics and software company BQ.\n\nPricing is €169.90 (around £126.50), with availability expected in the next few weeks. Initial stocks will be released in ‘flash sales’ that’ll be announced online via Twitter, Google+ and Facebook.\n\nSpecifications include a 4.5-inch display, 8GB of built-in memory, an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. The phone runs on MediaTek’s 1.3GHz quad-core Cortex A7 processor and is capable of taking two SIM cards.\n\nRather than relying on applications for services, the BQ Aquaris Ubuntu uses built-in connectivity options called ‘Scopes’. According to Canonical, it’s simple to develop new Scopes via a UI toolkit, with development and maintenance costs lower than traditional apps.\n\nCristian Parrino, vice president of Mobile at Canonical, said “Ubuntu presents users with an entirely different way to engage with their devices – Scopes guide you to content you want – in the same way you think about it – to deliver a smooth, engaging experience. For developers, Scopes are a much simpler and more valuable way to build mobile experiences than apps – significantly changing ecosystem dynamics.”"
