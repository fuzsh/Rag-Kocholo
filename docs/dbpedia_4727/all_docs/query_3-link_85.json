        "text": "If the specs from PDAdb is to be believed, the 2 phones are quite different hardware-wise:\n\nBQ Aquaris E4.5 Dual SIM vs. BQ Aquaris A4.5 4G LTE Dual SIM\n\nThe A4.5 is a relatively new Android One phone that's promised 2 years of support. The E4.5 on the other hand, despite released in late 2014, bears a MT6582 SoC which had fallen out of mainstream for quite some time. There's no way you could cross-flash between these two, and you likely won't find anything tailored to this particular device either."
