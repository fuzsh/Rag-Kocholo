        "text": "Same here. The SIM slots used to work, but they suddenly stopped working a couple of years ago. I'm afraid it's a hardware issue, because I tried reflashing android and it didn't recognize the SIMs either.\n\nEven in the factory mode the SIMs are not working.\n\nI own a BQ E4.5 of the first batch and it is updated with the last OTA (OTA-21).\n\nApart from the centre of the screen not responding to finger touch it works great . This is a common failure for this device, according to some other posts I have read in the forum.\n\nI only use one of the SIM cards, so I cannot say both work, but one at least if working properly.\n\nSo does the SD card, where I store the photographs of the camera and the maps for OSMServer.\n\nHowever, yours maybe is a failure of, unfortunately, your devices @mardy @SaimonC.\n\n@aimar Thanks - and everyone else - for your feedback. I actually got this phone from a friend who was so unimpressed with it he gave it to me. It seems it's not worth pursuing.\n\nIt's a sweet device, and it's a part of UT history because it was sold with UT right out of the box. But it will not be supported much longer, so it was not your best option anyway."
