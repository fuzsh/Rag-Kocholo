        "text": "Apple’s Spring forward press event is now behind us and while the launch of the Apple Watch was expected, its pricing still managed to surprise some. Whether it’s justifiable has already proven a pointless discussion, so we’ll steer clear from it for the time being.\n\nWhat’s undeniable though, is that Cupertino’s Watch has become an abundant source of mockery material to industry competitors. Read more »\n\nA much-appreciated feature of Samsung’s smartphone lineup, the user-replaceable battery, has been sacrificed in the recently announced Galaxy S6 / S6 edge pair for the benefit of premium build. It’s not all lost, however, and with the right tools and attitude the cell can be substituted.\n\nIn an ironic move by the Korean company, a battery replacement procedure is detailed in the user manual, after being explicitly stated that it’s meant for your service provider. Read more »\n\nWe stopped by the Ubuntu stand to play with the Meizu MX4 running the novel OS. Meizu had been building up to the MWC by teasing the new edition of the MX4, which happens to be only the second smartphone booting Ubuntu, after the entry-level BQ Aquaris E4.5.\n\nWhen it comes to hardware, the MX4 is the exact same device we reviewed a few months ago in its Android flavor. It sports a 5.36-inch display of 1152 x 1920 pixel resolution, a Mediatek chipset with an octa-core processor and 2GB of RAM. It’s a distinctly better equipped device than the BQ Aquaris E4.5, and one that can be a more widely recognizable ambassador to the emerging OS platform. Read more »\n\nThe advancements in smartphone features are continuously pushing the limits of storage when it comes to speed and volume. Industry specialist SanDisk is keeping up with the trends and just unveiled its brand new iNAND 7132 storage solution for application in smartphones, tablets, and computing devices.\n\nIt’s targeted at flagship devices, which are the ones that require (and can benefit from) the improvements in speed. Read more »\n\nThe Apple Watch will not be exclusive to the US market, German Apple store employees report. The piece of news comes courtesy of no other, but company CEO Tim Cook himself.\n\nDuring last week’s visit in Berlin, Apple’s commander in chief decided to disclose that intriguing information in the informal surroundings of an Apple Store. Read more »\n\nArchos has its focus firmly on tablets at MWC and pulled the wraps off three slates, sporting the company’s “Fusion Storage” technology. Using software algorithms, the tablets will combine built-in memory with microSD card capacity for a combined storage solution.\n\nThe whole process happens automatically for a seamless user experience, and should allow for practically unlimited capacity for apps and media. Read more »\n\nSamsung took centerstage at this year’s MWC with the release of the most hotly-anticipated smartphone pair of the year, the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge. In typical Samsung fashion the company’s press event wasn’t lacking in flair.\n\nIf you’re more into the essence of things though, and have missed the livestream of the event, Samsung Mobile has been considerate enough to prepare a 60-second video, summarizing the keynote. Read more »\n\nNikon unveiled today an updated version of its D7100 prosumer DSLR. The new D7200 model carries improvements in several areas, among them increased buffer size and a bump in low-light sensitivity.\n\nThe D7200 comes with a different 24.2MP APS-C CMOS sensor, compared to the predecessor’s 24.1MP. That is likely the Sony made unit featured in other models of the company, which would explain the marginal difference in resolution over the Toshiba imager in the D7100. Read more »\n\nMicrosoft is slowly but steadily catching up to Android, and is planning to bring USB OTG capabilities along with Windows 10. The feature has been supported on Google’s OS since its 3.1 version, and by now has become virtually ubiquitous.\n\nThe official announcement will take place at the Windows Hardware Engineering Community event, which will be held a couple of weeks from now on March 18-19 in Schenzhen. Read more »\n\nAcer unveiled today an updated version of its Liquid Leap wearable, adding a “plus” to the name. It does bring more to the table though, than the marginal name change suggests.\n\nMost importantly, the smartband offers support for all three major operating systems, so you can pair it with the smartphone of your choosing. Read more »\n\nThe downpour of leaks and rumors on the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S6 has been intensifying with the nearing of its official launch. One detail that has remained left out though has been the flagship’s headset.\n\nThat omission has been addressed and live images of the earbuds that will likely accompany the Galaxy S6 and its Edge sibling have been spotted online. Read more »\n\nMWC is nearing and HTC’s “Utopia in progress” event is only days away. If you consider March 1 distant future though, we have some more info on the company’s next-gen flagship.\n\nComing from a different source this time, we get confirmation that the One (M9) will utilize a Toshiba sensor for the main camera, as we previously reported. Read more »\n\nIt was a repeated theme in Galaxy S6 rumors that the upcoming high-end smartphone will be equipped with wireless charging capability, and Samsung all but confirmed it. Now we may have stumbled on another tangible proof of that feature. American regulating authority FCC has certified a Samsung wireless charger and all clues point to a unit, that will accompany the hotly-anticipated flagship.\n\nThe charger’s model designation is EP-PG920I, containing the magical 920 number that the Galaxy S6 is set to bear. Read more »\n\nOn a dedicated event in Seoul today LG Electronics pulled the wraps off its global TV lineup for the 2015 model year. The company’s newly-adopted DUAL PREMIUM strategy plans to put LG in a leading position in the global premium TV market, while simultaneously expanding the upmarket segment as a whole.\n\nThe company is launching a range of OLED TV sets with 55″, 65″ and 77″ screens in flat and curved flavors. Read more »\n\nWidely criticized for the use of less than premium materials unworthy of upmarket devices, Samsung has made the move recently to metal frames, and the upcoming Galaxy S6 will allegedly join the trend. Solving one problem typically creates others in the process, though, and antenna interference is one result of the metal used on the Galaxy S6′s body.\n\nA report in Korean media states that Samsung is resorting to FPCB antenna technology for the future flagship, aiming to battle the negative effects of the metal frame on signal reception.
