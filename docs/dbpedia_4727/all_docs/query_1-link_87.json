But don't worry, you'll witness more flash sales in the coming weeks (Subscribe and we'll keep you updated).\n\nAnd there's more. According to Cristian Parrino from Canonical, Meizu MX4 Ubuntu edition would probably go on sale like BQ Aquaris in March or April and then there is a third manufacturer (which won't be named now due to obvious reasons) whose version of Ubuntu Phones are already in the making.\n\nUS launch of a new Ubuntu Phone likely by the end of this year!\n\nA seasoned Ubuntu enthusiast, Sujeevan Vijayakumaran, got to meet Cristian Parrino from Canonical during the sidelines of Ubuntu Phone Insider Launch Event. The short interview resulted in many striking revelations by Canonical's mobile phone division VP.\n\nAmong them, the most important one was the fact that Canonical is indeed planning to launch an Ubuntu Phone in US by the end of this year. Also, a third mobile phone manufacturer, apart from Meizu and BQ, is actively pursuing its version of an Ubuntu Phone. Excerpts from the interview:\n\nAbout the release dates of Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition:\n\n\"....we're in February, so I think the best-case scenario is next month. What definitely is going to happen next month is that we will show the Meizu devices at MWC in the first week of March. We don't know yet for sure but we are hoping that we can sell those devices in March as well. It could be March, it could be April.\"\n\nAbout the third manufacturer and the release of Ubuntu Phone in US:"
