        "text": "With the launch of the new Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition, queries are coming in from many BQ users: Can I install the new operating system on my Aquaris E4.5 or E5? The good news is yes, you can, although the tactile button functionality will depend on which system we install on the device.\n\nIf you want to install Ubuntu on an Aquaris E4.5 or E5 with Android, the tactile buttons on the screen will cease to functionality.\n\nHowever, if you have the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition and want to switch to Android, you will need to bear in mind that although the screen´s tactile buttons are hidden, they will continue to work in the same way as on the Aquaris E4.5 or E5. The only change is that they won´t light up when you switch on the device.\n\nNow we will look closely at the steps for carrying a hard reset of the device on both Linux and Windows.\n\nNB: This procedure can only be carried out on the Aquaris E4.5 and E5 devices. It is not available for any other BQ device.\n\nHard reset on Ubuntu\n\nNB: The tool is only available for the most widely used version of the Linux distribution, 12.04. However, by carrying out some additional steps, you can install it on the latest versions, 14. 04 and 14. 10.\n\nDownload the necessary files\n\nTo download the files, go to the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Editon or Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Edition pages if you want to install Ubuntu or the device or the Aquaris E4.5 Android or Aquaris E5 Android pages if you want to install Android. Download the necessary files for carrying out the HR from the relevant page. Press “Download” to launch the download of a file named “SP_Flash_Tool_exe_linux_v5.1424.00.zip”, that contains the drivers required for the computer to recognise the phone, as well as the hard reset tools + ADB Drivers. You will also need to download the firmware corresponding to your device. In this instance, download the current version of the hard reset firmware for either the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition or Aquaris E4.5 from the relevant page. NB: You will need to use a program like Win-RAR or 7-Zip to decompress the folders.\n\nDecompress the files needed to carry out the procedure\n\nGo to the folder containing the “SP_Flash_Tool_exe_linux_v5.1424.00.zip” file that you have downloaded. Double-click on this file, and a WinRAR dialogue box will open enabling you to decompress the contents. Press the “Extract” button on the menu bar at the top and it will ask you where you want to extract the files to. An ideal location is somewhere that is easy to find, such as your PC´s desktop. Press on “Accept” to start the decompression process. 3. Execute the MTK Flash Tool.\n\nWith the latest versions of Ubuntu (14.04 and 14.10), the “modemmanager” package installed on the computer is not compatible with the MTK Flash Tool, so you will need to uninstall it first. This package is used to control the modem connection via USB. Any user configuration file will be maintained after uninstalling and installing the package. This means that we can reinstall the current configuration if required after using the tool. The following steps are only necessary with the latest versions of Ubuntu. º We uninstall the package mentioned above using these commands:\n\n♦sudo apt-get remove modemmanager\n\nUninstall the package Uninstall the package ♦sudo service udev restartYou will be asked to enter your login password. A few command lines will appear asking if you want to continue. Type in Y (yes) and continue the process until it finishes\n\nRestart the udev service with out restarting the computer Restart the udev service with out restarting the computer ° This could cause the “cdc_acm” kernel module to be removed. You can check this by executing the following command.\n\n♦lsmod | grep cdc_acm\n\nCheck the kernel module Check the kernel module º If it returns an empty list, you will need to reinstall this module:\n\n♦sudo modprobe cdc_acm\n\nInstalling the cdc_acm module Installing the cdc_acm module You will be asked to enter your login password again.\n\nFrom here on, the following steps are universal for all Ubuntu versions: º Open the Ubuntu terminal and go to the directory of the folder containing the tool that we have just decompressed. If you have decompressed the folder on the desktop, the command to be executed in order to move to it will be as follows (bear in mind that the command will vary depending on which version of the tool you are using):\n\n♦cd Escritorio/SP_Flash_Tool_exe_linux_v5.1424.00/\n\nChange to the folder of the tool Change to the folder of the tool º Once in the corresponding directory, we need to give the tool permission with the following commands:\n\n♦chmod +x flash_tool\n\n♦chmod +x flash_tool*\n\nApplication permissions Application permissions º Now you are ready to execute it. Remember you must execute it as superuser with the “sudo” command. You will be asked to enter your login password.\n\n♦sudo ./flash_tool.sh\n\nCommand to execute the tool Command to execute the tool 4. Preparing the MTK Tool Flash to carry out a hard reset\n\nOnce the command is executed by device, the tool will be open. MTK Flash Tool MTK Flash Tool Press on the “Scatter-loading” button and you will see a dialogue box enabling you to select the firmware that you want to install on the phone (Ubuntu Edition or Android). In this case, go to the firmware folder that we decompressed earlier and select the text file that it contains, which will have a name similar to “MT6577_Android_scatter”, and then press “Open”. Selection window for the text file Selection window for the text file NB: to hard reset to Ubuntu, the file will have the same name.\n\nSelect “Firmware Upgrade” from the pull-down menu and press the Download button. NB: Make sure that you have selected “Firmware Upgrade” correctly. Selecting another option from the pull-down menu could cause an irreversible system failure on your device.\n\nCarry out the hard reset\n\nTurn your phone off and connect it to your PC using the USB to micro-USB cable. When you connect it, the process will start. Wait until it has finished and a window with a green circle and the word OK will appear. Process completed correctly Process completed correctly Once this window has appeared, you can close it, disconnect your phone and then start it up as normal. NB: If there are any problems with the tool when starting the hard reset, simply try again, without closing the application. Close the dialogue box, confirm that the “Firmware Upgrade” option is selected and click on “Download”. If it fails the first time, subsequent attempts will work correctly.\n\nWindows\n\nDownload the necessary files\n\nTo download the files, go to the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Editon page to if you want to install Ubuntu or the device or the Aquaris E4.5 Android page if you want to install Android. Download the necessary files for carrying out the HR from the relevant page. Press on “Drivers and utilities” Press “Download” to launch the download of a file named “Drivers&Tools.rar”, that contains the drivers required for the computer to recognise the phone, as well as the hard reset tools + ADB Drivers. You will also need to download the firmware corresponding to your device. In this instance, download the current version of the hard reset firmware for either the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition or Aquaris E4.5 from the relevant page.\n\nNB: You will need to use a program like Win-RAR or 7-Zip to decompress the folders.\n\nDecompress the files needed to carry out the procedure\n\nGo to the folder containing the “Drivers&Tools.rar” file that you have downloaded. Double-click on this file, and a WinRAR dialogue box will open enabling you to decompress the contents. Press the “Extract” button on the menu bar at the top and it will ask you where you want to extract the files to. An ideal location is somewhere that is easy to find, such as your PC´s desktop. Press on “Accept” to start the decompression process. 3 folders will appear: º “Drivers ADB”: containing the ADB drivers.\n\nº “Drivers Hard Reset”: containing the drivers for the hard reset process.\n\nº “MTK Flash Tool”: containing the tool to carry out the procedure.\n\nFile contents File contents 3. Relocate the files to the corresponding place\n\nMove the folders that you decompressed (“Hard Reset Drivers” and “MTK Tool Flash”) to the root of your PC´s hard drive “C:/” Go to the firmware file and repeat the steps, decompressing and moving the firmware folder to the root of your PC´s hard drive. Folders in C Folders in C: 4. Install the drivers\n\nAccess the “Hard Reset Drivers” folder which we have placed in the root of your PC´s hard drive, and execute the “Install” or “Install.bat” file. Start the function in a DOS window “C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe”. It will ask for your permission to install immediately, it will warn you that the drivers are unsigned and ask if you still want to install them. Accept all until the DOS window tells you to press any key to continue. Installation of the drivers Installation of the drivers Installation process completed Installation process completed Make sure your phone is off and connect it so that the computer recognises it. Leave it connected for a few minutes, until it starts to the install the drivers. 5. Prepare the MTK Tool Flash to carry out the hard reset\n\nIf your phone is still connected from the previous step, disconnect it now. Go to the “MTK Tool Flash” folder that you placed in the root directory and execute the tool (“Flash_tool” or “Flash_tool.exe”). Press on the “Scatter-loading” button and you will see a dialogue box enabling you to select the firmware that you want to install on the phone (Ubuntu Edition or Android). In this case, go to the firmware folder that we decompressed earlier and select the text file that it contains, which will have a name similar to “MT6577_Android_scatter”, and then press “Open”.

When you connect it, the process will start. Wait until it has finished and a window with a green circle and the word OK will appear. Process completed correctly_win Process completed correctly\n\nOnce this window has appeared, you can close it, disconnect your phone and then start it up as normal. If the hard reset process doesn´t start by itself when you connect the phone , check the next procedures. Attempt one step at a time, and if you don´t get it to work with the first one, then move on the next until you manage to get it to work: Check that the drivers have been correctly installed. To do this, go to the Devices Administrator and check that the phone is recognised when switched off and connected to the PC, (it does not appear with a yellow triangle, indicating that the driver has not been installed correctly). Change to different USB ports on your PC. If using a desktop computer, try connecting it to the ports at the back. Make sure that the phone has sufficient battery power, at least 30%. When you connect the phone, do it with the phone switched on, then switch it off so that the PC recognises it at that very moment."
