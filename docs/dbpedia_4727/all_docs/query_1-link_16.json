(The phone is unlocked).\n\nAt least here, the phone is not available in shops. So you might want to order it in time to the European address, where your friend is going to stay.\n\nThe phone is definitely worth a try, though sometimes still rough around the edges (ubuntu-touch), but getting regular updates..."
