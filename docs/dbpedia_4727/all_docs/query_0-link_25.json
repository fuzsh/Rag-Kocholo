Maybe its because I'm currently on OTA-19. Can anybody help me ? / Does anybody know how to get OTA-21 installed ? Maybe I have to update to OTA-20 first but I dont know if its just possible via System-Settings or do I have to download an Image and install manually.\n\nThank you\n\nMichael\n\nIt will be delayed. The admin do a staged update so things like servers are not overloaded and issues can be resolved. Keep checking, it will arrive. The same thing is happening on my Oneplus5.\n\nWow. Thats fast :). Oh, my fault, I see. There was always some delay when rolling out a new version. I didnt thought about that because of my idea it has to do with with OTA-19 :-). Ok ok, thanks for the fast reply. I will check for updates again next few days and weeks...\n\nMichael\n\n@michael Stable OTAs are not released to all users at once to avood releasing a bad update to everyone. However in your case, I think you should get the OTA-20 update. Perhaps you have pending app updates? It's an old issue that I think has been fixed already but just to check."
