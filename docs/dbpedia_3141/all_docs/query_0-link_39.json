        "meta_description": "Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ: Directed by Jose M. IÃ±guez. After saving her grandmother from the claws of the Wolf and its army of the evil, everything seemed to have gone back to normal. Nothing further from reality. With the recent and tragic death on combat of the woodman, an invasion of leper zombies endangers, once again, the peace of the world. Our story begins with the invasion of this fairy tale land by hordes of ravenous zombies. And they won't stop at anything, from the succulent legs of ham of the Three Little Pigs, to the sawdust brain of Pinocchio, they are all tasty morsels for the living dead. Grotesque aberrations plague the enchanted forests. Prince Charming wakes up Sleeping Beauties with real love bites, and ferocious wolves die when they attack abandoned little girls. Only one heroine can stop this babbling army. Her name is Red, Little Red Riding Hood, and now she's armed and dangerous.",
