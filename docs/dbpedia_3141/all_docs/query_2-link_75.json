        "text": "February 16, 2019\n\nRevised in 2019 with 10 more short stories and 13 fairy tale poems.\n\nJanuary 31, 2012\n\nThere are usually a slew of freebies for your Kindle (or your app). I'm not talking about classic, but recent books. Most of them are independet or self published, and in particular with some of the self-published books you know why quickly.\n\nSometimes, you find gems like this one.\n\nVann's collection of short stories are drawn from fairy tales or fairy tale literature (see Alice on the cover). \"The Vampire's New Suit\", \"The Gift\" and \"Blueberry Eyes\" are my favorites. Sadly to tell you anything about them would be to give away spoilers. Let's just say they have some wonderful twists and turns. And that's what is great about this collection, how inventive things are. Even the two tales I liked least, were wonderfully inventive. If you like fairy tales, you should read this.\n\nFebruary 25, 2022\n\nThe collection of Supernatural Fairy Tales has the subtitle Fairy Tale Inspired Paranormal Short Stories. And despite the fairy on the cover gazing at a mystical sky, a majority of these short stories are set in modern day.\n\nMost of the standard fairy tale characters you’d expect are included here. All are worth a read, but the ones that stood out to me are The Kingdom of Pillars, Muse, Weeping Lake, Quiet on the Nightingale, and Midnight. As an added bonus, thirteen fairytale-inspired poems are included at the end.\n\nFrom mysterious mermaids to magical muffins, from dismissive daughters to vain vampires and so much more, Supernatural Fairy Tales awaits the curious reader.\n\nFebruary 13, 2020\n\nInteresting spin\n\nAll of these fairytales have a modern take and a surprise end to them. My favorite was the Kingdom of Pillars and The Weeping Lake. I was also surprised with how the author used vampires and werewolves in unexpected places. There is even a zombie in one of the stories. Very clever.\n\nMay 5, 2019\n\nA nice enough collection of fairy tales redone to incorporate paranormal and urban fantasy tropes. All very short, some better than others. Creative use of the themes, but I just didn't feel overly grabbed by any of them.\n\nAugust 24, 2020\n\nVery good stories\n\nThe stories are very good, and the thought behind them is better. The writing is wonderful. They thrill and chill the reader.\n\nI am not qualified to write about the poetry, as I have no patience for it.\n\nMay 14, 2019\n\nReally great book\n\nReally great stories in this book\n\nVery well written and just a wonderful way of making the stories different and original\n\nDefinitely recommend this to everyone\n\nOctober 30, 2011\n\nThree good reads stars = I liked it:) The author offered this collection of fairy tale inspired short shorts to Goodreads member for the month of October (just click the green download button on the book's page).\n\nSupernatural Fairy Tales is collection of quick little fairy tale inspired supernatural tales wit3h just enough setup for each short short story to set the hook and deliver the twist. This is an entertaining little read (the stories only take up the first 68% of the download), but not a feel good one - remember fairy tales originally weren't bright and happy and filled with cheerful little singing creatures, the early versions were dark, violent and taught lessons with some gruesome consequences.\n\nThere are nine stories here and, quite frankly, in most of the stories I couldn't pick out the fairy tale that inspired it. I am not going to blurb these like I normally do for anthologies because these are so short that I don't want to give anything away. My favorites of the nine though were the Vampire's New Suit and Quiet on the Nightengale.\n\nRead\n\nNovember 6, 2011\n\nI really enjoyed Supernatural Fairy Tales. Each story was really quick and I read the book in no time. I thought all the stories were highly entertaining and brilliantly written.\n\nI found it so easy to read each story because the endings were so good. The story was really amazing and then you would get to the end and I found that the endings of each story just surprised me and blew me away completely. They were fantastic.\n\nAnother thing I loved was that in the back of the book were little pieces about the inspiration for each story. Some of them I’d heard of but others I didn’t actually know very well, but for the ones I did know it was good to know which stories they were based on for a comparison.\n\nI thought that Supernatural Fairy Tales was a great, fun afternoon read and it was so well-written that I know I’m going to be on the lookout for more of Dorlana’s stories.\n\nOctober 19, 2011\n\nThis book is an interesting take on the supernatural aspect of fairy tales, essentially taking them to their darker extremes.\n\nI enjoyed reading the stories, and the length of each short story felt perfect, just like a traditional fairy tale. I think my favourite, and the saddest story would be Blueberry Eyes, which is a really interesting and well written sequel to Hansel and Gretel.\n\nHowever, it seems as though all the stories have to have a twist, which made it a little predictable in terms of the plot towards the end. However, if you don't read it all in one go, you shouldn't feel this way.\n\nApril 18, 2012\n\nNine short stories with a dark spin inspired by fairytales. They are full of clever twists and some are just down right freaky and creepy, which is a good thing.\n\nThis book is really hard to talk about without giving away some spoilers. I'll just say it was entertaining. I reread Forbidden Beach as soon as I finished it and I'm still talking about The Vampire's New Suit.\n\nI personally Loved..Loved..Loved..Forbidden Beach. I got swept away by that story and forgot for a moment this was a dark fairytale.\n\nThe Vampire's New Suit was just a brilliant concept. Awesome spin to a vampire tale.\n\nNovember 28, 2011\n\nI absolutely loved all the stories in this book, they were a fast and easy read for those nights where you just don,t want to break your head with hard to understand stories of whodunits.\n\nIf you're in between 2 books, then this little baby is perfect for you. The stories are just dark enough to fulfill your need of supernatural love. The author is a great writer and will keep you wanting for more.\n\nThere is only one negative thing about the book, it's that it wasn't long enough, I could have kept on reading more of her stories. she is that good.\n\nI give this book 4 stars\n\nFebruary 20, 2024\n\nHere is a collection of supernatural short stories, all based on old fairy tales. From an adult Hansel and Gretel to the Emperor's New Clothes, it's all here. Each story only takes a few minutes to read and there are nine in total. If you like fairy tales, short stories and the paranormal, give this a shot.\n\n* Verified Purchase - November 2012 *\n\nMerissa\n\nArchaeolibrarian - I Dig Good Books!\n\nSep 24, 2016\n\nMarch 18, 2015\n\nI really enjoyed the tales in this book. Yes, they are fairy tales, but they have the horror streak that readers are going to love. Paranormal, supernatural and a bit of grim stories that remind you of fairy tales if they were in the twilight zone. I think the author did a great job making the short stories feel like a complete story and leaving the reader spellbound.\n\nApril 21, 2016\n\nTales\n\nA most enjoyable read of supernatural fairy tale stories that will hold the interest of of many readers. There are a number of excellent tales but there is of course some that are mediocre. I recommend you give it a try."
