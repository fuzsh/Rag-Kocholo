        "text": "Have you ever been to a zombie BBQ? Believe us, the undead know how to host a great backyard get-together. The meat being served is always a little questionable, but the entertainment is awesome (turns out, they all know how to do the Thriller dance). When we went to check out Destineer's booth at this year's PAX, we found out that their Zombie BBQ game is a decidedly different (read: more violent) approach to the subject.\n\nYou're Little Red Riding Hood, and you've already defeated the wolf, and saved your grandma. The End, right? Only the woodsman that helped you has been killed by zombies, and the entire fairytale kingdom is under attack. So the little red cloaked girl steps up and uses every weapon she can get to blast the zombies away.\n\nThe actual title of the game has been extended to Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ. It is presented as a zombified version of the fairy tales we all know. Pinocchio and Santa Claus appear as bosses. Players can choose to control either Little Red or Momotaro, a character from Japanese legend. Although the game was developed by Spanish developer Gammick, the cut scenes are presented with anime-style artwork.\n\nZombie BBQ can be controlled entirely with the stylus, but you can move left and right with the D-pad if you like. The levels scroll automatically a la classic shooters like Commando. Interestingly, there are only seven specific zones the player can stand in at the bottom of the touch screen. You can either tap where you want Red to move or handle her with the D-pad. The stylus also determines the direction she shoots. To reload, you must lift the stylus off the screen.\n\nCartoon zombies spill down from the top screen, and they can be dismembered in various ways. Often, you can shoot off their torso, leaving only a pair of legs stumbling towards you. Your bullets will fly over both screens, so you can plan ahead and start taking enemies out before they get too close to you. Green hands reach up from the ground. There are also slutty, well-endowed female zombies. Publisher Destineer tells us Zombie BBQ will just barely escape an \"M\" rating.\n\nBoxes can be blasted to find power-ups. After you pick up additional weapons, an icon will appear in the corner of the touch screen. Simply tap it to switch out. And since this is a videogame, exploding barrels litter the environments.\n\nThe levels we saw had a lot of nice detail. It's great to see a DS game with some mature humor. Zombie BBQ will fire up the grill just in time for Halloween."
