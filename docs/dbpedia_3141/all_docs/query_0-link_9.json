        "text": "Help Little Red Riding Hood blast her way through hoards of the undead in a fun arcade style shooter called Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ for the Nintendo DS by developer EnjoyUp.\n\nLittle Hood may be all grown up and channelling her inner Xena Warrior Princess, but she's up against some stiff action and needs a helping hand. From the annals of Japanese folklore comes Momotaro the Peach Boy - slayer of ogres.\n\nStoryland has suffered an outbreak of zombies turning characters like Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty into the undead and it is up to Hood and Momotaro to stop them.\n\nHood's basic weapon, the machine gun, can mow down any shambling corpse that pops up. But for serious action, gamers have the choice of using a sawn-off shotgun, a laser and a flamethrower to kill the zombies.\n\nChanging weapons is simple as they're all displayed on the touch screen - click on the appropriate icon.\n\nGrenades are also at hand for when there are more zombies than you can handle and you want to clear the screen quickly.\n\nGameplay is fairly easy with the display in an isometric format that spans both screens, with either Red or Momotaro moving horizontally across the bottom.\n\nMovement can be made either by using the touch screen or the D-pad (I suggest the latter for easier control).\n\nTo kill a target, simply select a zombie or touch the screen in the general direction you wish to fire, and hold the stylus down to shoot, while lifting the stylus reloads.\n\nIf you get touched by a zombie or a level obstruction, your health meter depletes, and if it diminishes entirely, the game's over.\n\nThis is a simple, fun old-style arcade shooter game that will make the commute to school a little shorter."
