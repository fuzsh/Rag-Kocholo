It’s true that the two companies are offering different experiences, but but at the end of the day, it’s necessary to get the word out about the technology. Peter Dille, Senior Vice President of Marketing at Sony Computer Entertainment America, expressed sentiments similar to Yoshida’s in an interview with Siliconera. Dillie is hoping that Nintendo does well with the 3DS so that consumers become interested in 3D in general.\n\n“Our perspective is they are doing something different and that’s what Nintendo does. They’ve got their own view, Sony has their own view. Our hope is they do it well because we’re big advocates of 3D. We need consumers to have good 3D experiences. I actually haven’t seen much of their technology. I know people are excited about it. I’ve heard a little bit that if you move your head a certain way you might lose the image. I just hope they do a great job, building a great 3D platform so people are interested in other 3D platforms. Because, collectively, we need to make sure a consumer has a good experience with 3D however they’re experiencing it so they have an interest in more 3D.”\n\nThis information comes from THQ’s Danny Bilson…\n\n“That one is changed. It’s changed. It’s going to be a different–we actually changed the design and are doing something more unique. This is just creative but we wound up feeling the game we were building was too much like a section of Saint’s Row that you could play in Saint’s Row. Now we’ve come up with a new design with a completely original game mechanic and we’re building out something that supports Saint’s Row with that. Because you don’t want to play something that you can play within the main experience. It’s actually a really cool, unique game we haven’t announced yet for Xbox Live.”\n\nThat sounds a bit mysterious, doesn’t it? I wonder what THQ is planning for the game… It’d be nice if the company were to share a trailer or a few screenshots of the project. We know virtually nothing about the title at the moment!\n\nSource"
