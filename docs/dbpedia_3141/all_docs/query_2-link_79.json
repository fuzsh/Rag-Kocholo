This is a very loose adaptation of the tale set in the modern day.\n\nCaperucita en Manhattan by Carmen Martín Gaite (1990).\n\nWitches Abroad by Terry Pratchett (1991) parodies a number of fairy tales, including Little Red Riding Hood. In this version Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg stop the wolf before it has a chance to eat the grandmother (much to its own relief, as it's acting against its will). Nanny Ogg remembers hearing about the same thing happening a couple of villages away, when she was a girl. She also refers obliquely to an incident when she visited her grandmother in a red hood, involving \"Sumpkins the lodger\".\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood in the Red Light District by Manlio Argueta (1998).\n\nDarkest Desire: The Wolf's Own Tale by Anthony Schmitz (1998).\n\nLow Red Moon by Caitlín R.

The moral says it all: \"It is not so easy to fool little girls nowadays as it used to be.\"\n\n\"Little Red Riding Hood\" published in James Finn Garner's Politically Correct Bedtime Stories satirises politically correct speech, focusing on such things as womyn's rights.[2] See also Politically Correct Red Riding Hood, which features a very different outcome.[3]\n\nPoetry\n\n\"Little Red Riding Hood\" by Olga Broumas, published in Beginning With O (1977).\n\n\"Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf\" by Roald Dahl, published in Revolting Rhymes (1983) - features a comical and violent twist in which Red turns the wolf into a wolf-skin coat.[4]\n\n\"The Waiting Wolf\" by Gwen Strauss, published in Trail of Stones (1990).\n\n\"On a Nineteenth Century Color Lithograph of Red Riding Hood by the Artist J.H.\" by Alice Wirth Gray, published in What the Poor Eat (1993).\n\n\"Journeybread Recipe\" by Lawrence Schimel, published in Black Thorn, White Rose (1994).\n\n\"Little Red Cap\" by Carol Ann Duffy, published in The World's Wife (1999).\n\n\"Silver and Gold\" by Ellen Steiber, published in The Armless Maiden(1996).\n\n\"Grandmother\" by Lawrence Syndal, published in Conjunctions #31 (1999).\n\nDrama and theatre\n\nStephen Sondheim and James Lapine's musical Into the Woods plays with the typical devices of a number of different fairytales, including Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nRadio humorist Stan Freberg performed a radio play spoofing both Little Red Riding Hood and Dragnet called \"Little Blue Riding Hood\".\n\nThe tale seems to hold a particular attraction for Greek composers; opera versions of it have been produced by George Kouroupos (1988), Kharálampos Goyós (1998), and Georges Aperghis (2001).\n\nThe Adventures of Goldilockpick and Little Red Riding Hoodlum by Todd Barty is a rhyming pantomime crossing over with Goldilocks and the Three Bears and various other fairy tales and nursury rhymes. In it Little Red Riding Hood is portrayed as a beautiful young thief who is clever but vain and does not see what is coming to her. She is prone to fighting with Goldilocks, robbing travellers and, to her horror, showing her panties. She and Goldilocks become celebrities and are finally captured during a food-fight wearing nothing but their underwear and the ingredients they have hurled at each other. The Queen of Hearts pardons them, as they have honoured her with their choice to steal her tarts, and Goldilocks is married to the Knave and Little Red to Boy Blue.\n\nIn 2011 Dark Waters Theatre Group presented Little Red Riding Hood in the Dixon Studio of Palace Theatre, Westcliff-on-Sea\n\nMany of the above short stories and poems (as well as many older texts) are collected in The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood by Jack Zipes.\n\nFilm\n\nIn the early 1960s, María Gracia starred as Little Red Riding Hood in a trilogy of Mexican films by director Roberto Rodriguez, which were then re-dubbed in English and released in the United States courtesy of K. Gordon Murray: the so-called \"King of the Kiddie Matinee\". These films were: La Caperucita roja (Little Red Riding Hood; 1960), Caperucita y sus tres amigos (Little Red Riding Hood and Her Friends/Little Red Riding Hood and Her Three Friends ; 1961) and Caperucita y Pulgarcito contra los monstruos (Little Red Riding Hood and the Monsters; 1962). The latter of these films also starred Cesáreo Quezadas, who reprised his recurring role of Pulgarcito (Tom Thumb).\n\nLiza Minnelli starred in the 1965 television film The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood with Cyril Ritchard as the Wolf and Vic Damone as the huntsman. This revisionist fairy tale is told from the Wolf's point of view.\n\nIn 1977, Soviet film studio \"Belarusfilm\" made the film About Red Hat (Russian: Про Красную Шапочку) (in Russian).\n\nFilmmaker Neil Jordan's 1984 horror/fantasy film The Company of Wolves, based on the short story by Angela Carter (above), told an interweaving series of folkloric tales loosely based on Red Riding Hood that fully exploited its subtexts of lycanthropy, violence and sexual awakening.\n\nIn the 1987 Japanese live-action film The Red Spectacles (aka Akai Megane), the featured \"young lady\" (as mentioned in the French and German versions of the tale), an allegory for Fate, is dressed like the Little Red Riding Hood. A anime version of this character appeared later in the film's sequel, Jin-Roh.\n\nCBC aired its television film The Trial of Red Riding Hood in 1992 starring figure skater Elizabeth Manley. It premiered on the Disney Channel two years later.\n\nFreeway, a 1996 feature film adaptation, starring Kiefer Sutherland and Reese Witherspoon adapts the story[5] into a modern setting in which the major characters become a psychotic but charming serial killer (named Bob Wolverton) and a sexually abused teenage girl.\n\nChristina Ricci starred in a 1997 short film based on the subject matter: Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nThe 1999 Belgian short film Black XXX-Mas translates the story to a nightmarish, futuristic urban setting. \"The Forest\" is the nickname for the jungle-like city and \"Wolfy\" is a crooked police officer who hounds this film's Little Red.\n\nThe 2001 Kenneth Liu short film Falsehood refigures the Little Red Riding Hood story as a legal drama, with the Big Bad Wolf on trial and Little Bo Peep as his attorney. Scenes between Peep and the Wolf pay homage to the Clarice Starling/Hannibal Lecter scenes in The Silence of the Lambs.\n\nThe 2003 horror film Red Riding Hood directed by Giacomo Cimini was a darker take on the classic story.\n\nSingapore cult director Tzang Merwyn Tong directed a 45 minute short film in 2005 titled A Wicked Tale. Tzang's postmodern re-imagination of the fable is presented in a chilling style that combines the silent-era revivalism of Guy Maddin with the shock/sadistic horror of Audition-era Takashi Miike.\n\nThe 2006 film Red Riding Hood was a Musical film adaptation directed by Randal Kleiser, and test-released first in late 2004. The experimental virtual reality features were then enhanced for over an additional year. The film stars Morgan Thompson as \"Red\". Also among the actors are Henry Cavill, Ashley Rose Orr, Andrea Bowen, and music opera entertainers well known on Broadway Lainie Kazan, Debi Mazar and Joey Fatone.\n\nThe 2006 short film Big Bad Wolves takes a black-comedy-meets-fantasy approach by having the story told from the point of view of Tarantino-style gangsters who try to convince each other that it is actually a fable about female sexuality. This version features a more classic, fairy tale approach to the narrative and visuals, but also utilizes a werewolf as a literal sexual predator.\n\nThe 2007 horror anthology film Trick r Treat contains one story thread inspired by the tale. A girl, played by Anna Paquin, dresses up as Little Red Riding Hood for a Halloween party, but is waylaid by a serial killer in the woods. However, the story twists when she reveals herself to be a werewolf seeking her \"first time\".\n\nWriter/director Joseph Bat is working on A Take of Little Red Riding Hood, which is expected to be released in 2009 and will feature a darker reimagining of the story.[6]\n\nThe Slasher film Red Riding Hood - The Blood of Red Riding Hood based on the story.[7]\n\nThe 2010 Syfy film Red: Werewolf Hunter[8][9] starring Felicia Day, is a modern, action-film take on the story.[10]\n\nThe 2011 film Red Riding Hood, starring Amanda Seyfried, is a period romance/horror film based on the fairy tale.\n\nAnimation\n\nWalt Disney produced a black and white silent short cartoon called \"Little Red Riding Hood\" in 1922 for Laugh-O-Gram Cartoons. Copies of this early work of Disney's are extremely rare.\n\nVan Beuren Studios produced a black and white cartoon in 1931 called \"Red Riding Hood,\" in which the Grandma drinks \"Jazz Tonic\" that transforms her into her younger self. The Wolf and the younger Grandma intend to elope, but are thwarted by the Wolf's wife and children during the ceremony.[11]\n\nThe Fleischer Brothers produced the theatrical short \"Dizzy Red Riding Hood\" in 1931, featuring Betty Boop and Bimbo, in which Bimbo defeats the wolf on the way to Grandma's house, and puts on the wolf's skin to pursue Betty, while Grandma has gone out to the Firemen's Ball.\n\nTex Avery's Red Hot Riding Hood recasts the story in an adult-oriented urban setting, with the suave, suited wolf howling after the night club singer Red. Tex Avery also utilised the same cast and themes in a number of other cartoons in this series, such as Little Rural Riding Hood, which set the story in the modern day and featured Red and the wolf as hillbillies.\n\nEarly Bugs Bunny cartoons such as Little Red Riding Rabbit utilise characters from fairytales such as Little Red Riding Hood. In one cartoon comic version {Red Riding Hoodwinked}, Little Red Riding Hood is accompanied by Tweety Bird while the villains are played by a Wolf and Sylvester, who almost come to blows over who is going to play \"Grandma\". Another Sylvester parody is Little Red Rodent Hood.\n\nA few Loopy de Loop cartoons such as \"Tale of a Wolf\" feature Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nThe Japanese children's anime TV series Akazukin Chacha features the eponymous heroine Chacha who is visually reminiscent of Little Red Riding Hood ('akazukin' relates to her red hood and cape). One of the major themes of the series is a sort of pre-adolescent love triangle between Chacha and her two male friends, one of whom is a werewolf, the other a boy-witch.\n\nThe 1995 animated film from Jetlag Productions adapts the classic fairy tale and at the same time adds its own original twists and additions to the story in order to stretch the plotline to their regular 48-minute length. The film featured three original songs and was written by George Bloom and produced by Mark Taylor.\n\nIn 1996, Jan Kounen directs \"Le dernier chaperon rouge\" (The Last Riding Hood, literal translation), a French fantasy musical short film starring Emmanuelle Béart.\n\nThe 1999 Japanese animated film Jin-Roh (also known as Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade), about a secret society within an anti-terrorist unit of an alternative post-World War II Japan, makes several literary and visual references to the German oral version of the story (most notably a Rotkäppchen book offered to the main character by one of the female bomb couriers), which is closer to the Perrault version, than the tale of Grimm, with an anti-terrorist commando as the wolf (the title is literally \"Man-wolf\" in Japanese\"), and a former terrorist courier as the young lady.\n\nAn anime named Otogi Jushi Akazukin has as main character a girl named Akazukin, who is a Fairy Musketeer and has to protect a boy named Souta, who's the Elde Key, from the world of Science. Akazukin comes from Fandavale, the world of Magic, and for protect Souta, she has help of Val, her Wolf Familiar and the others two Musketeers, Shirayuki (Snow White) and Ibara (Sleeping Beauty). The Enemies are Randagio (one of the Bremen Town Musicians), Hansel and Gretel, who works for Cinderella, who wants the Elde's Key.\n\nA 2006 computer-animated children's film, Hoodwinked, uses the anachronistic parody approach to the tale typified by the Shrek films, envisioning the story as a Rashomon-like mystery in which the anthropomorphised animal police of the forest question the four participants of the story (Red, the Wolf, Granny and the Woodsman) after they arrive at Granny's house, with each participant telling their own version of how they arrived there and why.\n\nIn the film Shrek the Third, she is portrayed as one of the villains; she is seen pickpocketing in one scene. Interestingly enough, the Big Bad Wolf is considered one of the good guys.\n\n\"Red Riding Hood\" is a character in Super Why! in which she calls herself \"Wonder Red,\" wears roller blades, and has \"Word Power\".\n\nA 2010 anime named Okami-san and her Seven Companions is based around the characters Ryōko Ōkami (Ōkami meaning wolf), Ryōshi Morino (his name also meaning \"The Forest's Hunter\" in Japanese) and Ringo Akai (representing Little Red Riding Hood) and the rest of the \"trading\" club named the \"Otogi High School Bank\" as they fix students problems, whatever they may be, in exchange for the students helping them out later. Almost all of the characters in the anime are based on characters from Little Red Riding Hood or other fairytales. The ending theme song, \"Akazukin-chan Goyoujin\" (Little Red Riding Hood, Be Careful) by OToGi, makes many references to Little Red Riding Hood and its characters as well.\n\nComics\n\nNeil Gaiman worked a darker, more erotic, pre-Perrault version of the Red Riding Hood tale in The Doll's House arc of the Sandman comics. In this version, the wolf kills the old lady, tricks the girl into eating her grandmother's meat and drinking her blood, orders the girl to undress and lie in bed with him and finally devours her. According to Gaiman, his portrayal of the tale was based on the one reported in the book The Great Cat Massacre: and other episodes in French cultural history by Robert Darnton.[12]\n\nIn the Tales of Asgard section of Journey into Mystery #114 (1965 March) by Marvel Comics, a story which at the end claims to be the basis of Little Red Riding Hood appears. The goddess Iduna walks the forests of Asgard carrying a bundle of golden apples. These \"Golden Apples of Immortality\" are for All-Father Odin, and Iduna brings them to him every year. Along her journey she meets Haakun the Hunter. Haakun greets her warmly and tells her to go in peace.\n\nAs Iðunn continues further down the path, wearing her crimson cloak and hood, Fenris the Wolf-God sees her, and transforms himself. Iduna next comes upon \"a frail stranger\". The stranger offers Iduna protection along her journey, but she declines the offer. The stranger takes a strong interest in Iduna's basket and begins asking her questions. She quickly grows suspicious, saying his hands seem so grasping -so brutal, and he has an odd voice, like the guttural snarl of a wild beast. She finds his manner sinister-frightening, and says his eyes burn with hatred-with pure savagery. She then discovers that the stranger is actually Fenris the Wolf God in disguise. Fenris shape shifts into his true form and attacks her. Haakun the Hunter arrives and drives Fenris away with his enchanted battle axe, causing the Wolf to shrink in an attempt to escape. The axe pursues Fenris and finally strikes him, spiriting him off to the shadowy land of Varinheim.\n\nBoth the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood are characters in the Fables comic book universe. The Big Bad Wolf has taken on human form and become known as Bigby Wolf. He is the sheriff of Fabletown when the series begins. The figure of Red Riding Hood ('Ride') appears three times. The first two instances are actually spies working for the Fables' enemy The Adversary, magically disguising themselves as Little Red Riding Hood (the second of which is actually the witch Baba Yaga). The third Red Riding Hood seems to be the genuine article.\n\nIn the manga Ludwig Kakumei by Kaori Yuki, Red Riding Hood is an infamous assassin whose first victims are her parents after she was tricked by the Prince.\n\nThe webcomic No Rest for the Wicked has a character called \"Red\". She lives alone in the woods and always carries an axe with her. After being attacked by a wolf (presumably killed and eaten) she has gone and systematically killed many of the wolves in the forest.\n\nTamaoki Benkyo created a twisted and dark version of Red Riding Hood in the manga Tokyo Red Hood. It is about a demonic girl dressed as red riding hood who wanted to be devoured by a creature only known as Mr. Wolf.\n\nThe one-shot manga titled Little Red Riding Hood and the Kind Wolf by Palmeros is a dialogue-less tragedy based on the story of Little Red Riding Hood, portraying the titular characters as a young girl who befriends a wolf, only for a grim series of events to unfold when she is revealed to have been abused.\n\nA comic created by Hector Sevilla and Mike S. Miller called Lullaby features a Red Riding Hood character who is half girl and half wolf (Because she got bitten by The Big Bad Wolf). The art can be viewed here [2].\n\nAn adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood in the Grimm Fairy Tales comic series by Zenescope depicted Red Riding Hood as a teenage girl nicknamed Red who is going off to bring food to her sick grandmother who lives deep in the woods. She gets attacked by a werewolf who kills her grandmother and attacks her there. She is saved by the woodsman, named Samson, and the wolf turns out be a former lover. This story was a teenager's dream sequence after she gets into a fight with her boyfriend who wanted to have sex with her.\n\nThe manga One Piece references Red Riding Hood in chapter 413: \"The Hunter\". One of the protagonists, Sogeking, wears a red cloak and is almost killed by a \"wolfman\", Jyabura. He is saved by Sanji, \"the hunter\". Later on, Jyabura, attempting to bluff his way out of a fight, depicts Nico Robin (in a red hood) as his sister.\n\nStreetfables published a modern, urban adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood called Red[3].\n\nIssue #1 of the Marvel Comics series Spider-Man Fairy Tales is an adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood with Mary Jane Watson as the protagonist.\n\nIn the webcomic EverAfter, by Shaun Healey, Little Red Riding Hood is depicted as having gone insane inside the Big Bad Wolf's belly, emerging a violent sociopath who chopped up the woodsman with his own saw, and needed to be placed in the EverAfter Maximum Security Asylum, along with other twisted fairy tale characters ranging from Tom Thumb to Goldilocks, Hansel and Gretel, Miss Muffet, etc., all under the care of President Dumpty Humpty Dumpty and Dr. Crooked (from a nursery rhyme).\n\nSerena Valentino and Foo Swee Chin wrote and illustrated an adaptation of Red Riding Hood in Nightmares & Fairy Tales #8 where Red is known as Luna. This comic version focuses on Luna's struggle to cope with her fellow villagers' intense disdain for wolves. When a supposedly \"dead\" wolf kills her father, she sympathizes with the animal more than her parent, causing her mother to throw her out of the house in a fit of rage. Luna befriends a kind young man on the way to her grandmother's house and eventually discovers that her grandmother is a werewolf. When Luna's mother arrives and kills her wolf-grandmother, Luna also begins to change into a white wolf but is spared a gruesome death when her friend, in wolf-form, rescues her.\n\nThe origin of Batman's most famous foe the Joker is often shown to involve him dressing up as a character the Red Hood, which criminals hoped to use to make him seem like the mastermind of a robbery.\n\nVideo games\n\nAn East Asian company produced an unlicensed Nintendo Entertainment System game called Little Red Hood.\n\nFinal Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales includes a pair of storybooks entitled \"Mini Red Riding Hood\", which uses the popular story as its basis, but instead of being threatened by a wolf, Red has to contend with the lightning spirit Ramuh on her way to her grandmother's house.\n\nWorld of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade features The Big Bad Wolf as one of the random encounters in the Karazhan opera event. The Wolf transforms a random player into Red Riding Hood and chases her around the room.\n\nIn the game Fable, and Fable: The Lost Chapters, the hero's mother is revealed to have been a famous Hero, and Slayer of Balverines (An in-game equivalent to werewolves) who went by the name of Scarlet Robe\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood is the title of the second episode of the episodic game series American McGee's Grimm (2008) which features a dwarf (\"Grimm\") bent on returning fairy tales to their supposedly much darker origins. American McGee also returned to the theme of Red Riding Hood with his 2010 interactive story for the iPad: \"Akaneiro: A Red Riding Hood Story.\"\n\nA 2008 action videogame called Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ was released for the Nintendo DS. It was developed by EnjoyUp and published by Destineer (known for other DS games such as Fullmetal Alchemist: Dual Sympathy and Candy Factory) and got a successful review score of 8.6 at IGN.com.\n\nPublisher/Developer Capcom created a character entitled B.B. Hood (an acronym for \"Baby Bonnie Hood,\" Japanese name \"Bulletta\"), which is inspired by the protagonist in the Little Red Riding Hood fables. \"Hood\" as-it-were is something of a loose interpretation of the character; in that her persona is far more eccentric, volatile, and outlandish then what is typically depicted in the classic tale. This particular character has been seen in subsequent Capcom videogame releases including: the Darkstalkers videogame series (in which she first appeared), and the first two installments of the fan-favorite videogame Marvel vs. Capcom.\n\nThe Path, a 2009 art game by Belgian developer Tale of Tales, is primarily inspired by various older versions of the Red Riding Hood tale.\n\nOverlord: Dark Legend features a mysterious young girl named Li'l Red who asks the Overlord to escort her through the Withering Woods to her grandmother's house near the beginning of the game. However, once they reach her grandmother's house it is revealed that she is actually a \"Wolf Queen\" in disguise, essentially taking the place of both Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf.\n\nAdventure Quest Worlds has a brunette variation of Red Riding Hood, called Red Hunting Hood here. She is a skilled hunter who wants the players' help to hunt down several monsters.\n\nFairytale Fights has Lil' Red as a playable character.\n\nMusic and music video\n\nThe song \"How Could Red Riding Hood (Have Been So Very Good)?,\" written by A.P. Randolph in 1925 and published in 1926 (see 1966 hit song \"Lil' Red Riding Hood\").\n\nThe music video for the VAST (Visual Audio Sensory Theater) song \"Pretty when you Cry\" is heavily inspired by Little Red Riding Hood. It focuses heavily on the sexual undertones of the story and psychology of sexual predation.\n\nThe last four tracks of Japanese black metal band Kadenzza's 2005 album The Second Renaissance follow the plot of Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nBowling For Soup recorded a cover version of Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs' \"Lil' Red Riding Hood\" for the soundtrack to the werewolf film Cursed. This song is included in their 2005 compilation album Bowling for Soup Goes to the Movies.\n\nThe Blessed Virgin Larry released a remake and music video of Lil' Red Riding Hood on their 2005 CD \"The United Police States Of America\"\n\nEvanescence's music video for the song \"Call Me When You're Sober\" is heavily inspired by Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nNerdcore rapper MC Frontalot retells the Little Red Riding Hood story in his song \"Start Over\".\n\nChildren Of Bodom's album Hate Crew Deathroll contains a song named \"Lil' Bloodred Ridin' Hood\".\n\nThe music video for \"Ordinary Day\" by Dolores O'Riordan features a young girl in a red hood running through a wooded area.\n\nThe songs 'Wolf' and 'Paint Hell Red' by Angelspit are both inspired by Little Red Riding Hood, particularly the sexual undertones.\n\nAn adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood was used in the music video for the Mika song \"Lollipop\", in which the main character, instead of being little red riding hood, is called the lollipop girl, and does not have a red hood and is, at the end the music video, eaten up by the wolf.\n\nBelgian dance act Lasgo released a music video for their song All Night Long in which singer Evi Goffin plays little red riding hood.\n\nOther\n\nProbably the most famous use of Little Red Riding Hood in television advertising is the Chanel No. 5 commercial directed by Luc Besson with music by Danny Elfman and starring Estella Warren. In this advertisement, Warren plays a modern-day Red Riding Hood getting ready to enjoy the Paris nightlife, much to the lamentation of her household wolf. The commercial can be viewed here.[13]\n\nTodd McFarlane's \"Twisted Fairy Tales\" action figure line includes a more voluptuous Red Riding Hood holding a dead wolf with its entrails and Grandma dripping out of its stomach. A similar but less gory figure is part of the \"Scary Tales\" line of figures (not by McFarlane).\n\nRed Riding Hood and Granny feature prominently in the 2011 TV Series Once Upon A Time. In the first episode, it is revealed that Granny and Red Riding Hood are members of the War Council. After the Dark Curse is inflicted, Granny runs an inn in Storybrooke and Red Riding Hood is an unruly teenage girl who wants to leave Storybrooke, but stays to care for her Granny who has health problems.\n\nSee also\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood\n\nCategory:Little Red Riding Hood adaptations\n\nReferences\n\nWikimedia Foundation. 2010.\n\nQuaraí\n\nBrian Habib"
