        "text": "NintendoWare Weekly: Lilt Line, Darius Twin, Zombie BBQ\n\nby JC Fletcher12.13.2010\n\nIt is, without a doubt, an actually good, not disappointing day on the Wii and DSi Shops. It's a Christmas miracle! The very cool iPhone reflex / rhythm game Lilt Line is now on WiiWare, published by Bit. Trip developer Gaijin Games. And Taito's Darius Twin shoots 'em up on Virtual Console. On DSiWare, Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ, originally a retail DS game, can be downloaded for 800 Points, obviating the need to go to a store and hunt down that somewhat obscure (but fun) shooter.%Gallery-110454%\n\nZombie BBQ cooks up DSiWare release next week\n\nby JC Fletcher12.07.2010\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ never made it to retail in Europe, instead being released as a DSiWare download. Even though it did come out on a cartridge in North America, EnjoyUp is releasing the DSiWare version anyway, giving Zombie BBQ the unique honor of being available both digitally and in a box. Said DSiWare release will occur next Monday, December 13. Look forward to having two convenient options for fulfilling your Red Riding Hood-blasting-the-undead needs. Check out an oddly windowed trailer after the break.\n\nEuropean Nintendo downloads: Zombies Lit, BBQed My Ghost Mansion\n\nby JC Fletcher10.30.2009\n\nNintendo of Europe apparently believes Halloween is serious business and worth celebrating. Four of the five new downloadable games this week are in some way horror-themed! Zombies Ate My Neighbors arrives on Virtual Console in the same week as its North American release (under the European title Zombies), as does (unfortunately) Ghost Mansion Party. WayForward's LIT proves a more appropriate Halloween release than its Valentine's Day-adjacent release in the US would suggest. Perhaps the biggest, scariest surprise of all: Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ is out in Europe, finally! And, while it was released on a cartridge here, it's an 800-point DSiWare download in Europe! No excising of zombie food talk for this one. Zombies (SNES, 1-2 players, 800 Wii Points) LIT (WiiWare, 1 player, 800 Wii Points) Ghost Mansion Party (WiiWare, 1-4 players, 1,000 Wii Points) Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ (DSiWare, 1 player, 800 DSi Points) A Little Bit of ... All Time Classics: Card Classics (DSiWare, 1-8 players, 500 DSi Points)\n\nDS releases for the week of November 3rd\n\nby Alisha Karabinus11.03.2008\n\nIf you need a game, this week's for you. While we can't vouch for the quality of all the releases (or even, uh, half), but we can say one thing: there's a lot of 'em. And by a lot, we mean dozens. Well, if you add up all the regions, anyway. Look, don't get technical. It's a lot. See for yourself.As an aside, after seeing this week's releases, we should stop crying about not having any more Professor Layton -- the first title is only just now being released in Europe! And what's up with Korg DS-10? It's been turning up on releases for a while. Maybe we'll actually see it this week. Army Men: Soldiers of Misfortune Dora the Explorer: Dora Saves the Snow Princess Dragonball: Origins Exit DS futureU: The Prep Game for SAT Goosebumps HorrorLand Guitar Rock Tour Hello Kitty Daily Imagine: Interior Designer Imagine: Wedding Designer James Bond 007: Quantum of Solace Korg DS-10 Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa Monster Lab My Baby Boy My Baby Girl Petz Dogz Pack Pony Friends: Mini Breeds Edition Princess on Ice Real Soccer 2009 Theresia Tom Clancy's EndWar Winx Club: Mission Enchantix Zoo Vet: Endangered Animals\n\nA tiny morsel of Zombie BBQ\n\nby JC Fletcher05.05.2008\n\nSure, these are just three screens of Enjoy Up's Zombie BBQ (and a fourth that is already in our gallery), but it's Zombie BBQ. We think there's enough meat there, so to speak, to be worth your attention. Mostly we wanted to write the title a bunch. Zombie BBQ. We feel an obligation to report on new shmups, as well. Especially when they eschew the traditional spaceship theme for something a little more creative -- like, say, fairy-tale characters versus zombies. Really, as long as stuff comes from the top of the screen and can be shot at, it doesn't matter if they're formations of bug-shaped spacecraft or the shambling, candy-colored dead.%Gallery-19218%\n\nMomotaro joins the Zombie BBQ\n\nby Alisha Karabinus04.25.2008\n\nAs if it wasn't enough that we'd get to play one pissed-off Red Riding Hood (she's armed and out of control!) in the forthcoming Zombie BBQ, publisher Gammick Entertainment has announced a second playable character: legendary Japanese hero Momotaro. Once you take the reins of one of these epic characters of folklore and fable, you'll be pitted against such enemes as UNDEAD GRETEL and PESTILENTIAL PINOCCHIO. If there's a line for this game, you can expect that we'll be first. Zombie BBQ sounds too hilarious to be missed. It looks it, too; check out the screenshots below if you're not convinced. %Gallery-19218%[Via press release]\n\nZombie BBQ concept (un)lives up to its awesome name\n\nby Eric Caoili03.26.2008\n\n\"Once upon a time there was a fantastic world where fairy tale creatures dwelt and all was peace and harmony ... till the zombies came to eat out their brains!\" What an introduction! Despite the entertaining scenarios we came up with to accompany Zombie BBQ's name, we doubted that the actual project would satisfy our hopes. After all, Barcelona-based Gammick is a newcomer publisher, and developer Enjoy Up's last release, Chronos Twins, didn't capture the hearts of many gamers.With those concerns now out of the way, we're happy to report that Zombie BBQ is definitely worth your interest! In this unique title, you play as a gun-toting Little Red Riding Hood in a vertical-scrolling shooter (think Gunsmoke), blasting an array of monsters that have invaded \"Fairy Tale land.\"We have a collection of screenshots and artwork in the gallery below (the better to show you, dear readers!), so skip on over and start clicking. Zombie BBQ is scheduled to hit stores this October, just in time for Halloween!%Gallery-19218%\n\nZombie BBQ sounds appetizing\n\nby Candace Savino03.25.2008\n\nSince Gammick Entertainment and Enjoy Up bestowed no details about Zombie BBQ upon us other than its awesome name, we're going to have to make our own assumptions. We're picturing a bunch of zombies kicking back in someone's backyard, throwing brains on a grill and drinking some microbrews. Or, perhaps this will more like Cooking Mama, only infused with George Romero's favorite creatures of play. We hope you like your brains smothered in barbecue sauce. Personally, we prefer them in a wasabi glaze, but that's only because we're cultural.Then again, the game could take place after the Zombie War, a time when humans will eat zombies as some sort of sick form of payback. That's pretty gross, though -- not even the deliciousness of barbecue sauce can take the edge off of rotting flesh.Assuming we haven't disgusted you to the point that you're now uninterested in this game, the international lunch (er, launch) for this title will be in October.[Via GamesPress]"
