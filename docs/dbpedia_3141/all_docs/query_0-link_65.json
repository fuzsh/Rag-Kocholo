        "text": "The Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale has often been adapted, and into a wide variety of media.[1]\n\nAnimation\n\n[edit]\n\nWalt Disney produced a black-and-white silent short cartoon called \"Little Red Riding Hood\" (1922) for Laugh-O-Gram Cartoons. Copies of this early work of Disney's are extremely rare.\n\nBritish animator Anson Dyer produced a silent short cartoon called Little Red Riding Hood (1922) as part of his Kiddie-Graphs series of animated fairy tales.[2]\n\nVan Beuren Studios produced a black-and-white cartoon called \"Red Riding Hood\" (1931) in which the Grandma drinks \"Jazz Tonic\" that de-ages her into her younger self. The Wolf and the younger Grandma intend to elope, but are thwarted by the Wolf's wife and children during the ceremony.[3]\n\nThe Fleischer Brothers produced the theatrical short \"Dizzy Red Riding Hood\" (1931), featuring Betty Boop and Bimbo, in which Bimbo defeats the wolf on the way to Grandma's house, and puts on the wolf's skin to pursue Betty, while Grandma has gone out to the Firemen's Ball.\n\nTex Avery's Red Hot Riding Hood (1943) recasts the story in an adult-oriented urban setting, with the suave, suited wolf howling after the night club singer Red.\n\nTex Avery also utilized the same cast and themes in a number of other cartoons in this series, such as Little Rural Riding Hood (1949), which set the story in the modern day and featured Red and the wolf as hillbillies.\n\nEarly Bugs Bunny cartoons, such as Little Red Riding Rabbit (1944), utilize characters from fairy tales such as Little Red Riding Hood. In one cartoon comic version, Red Riding Hoodwinked (1955), Little Red Riding Hood is accompanied by Tweety Bird while the villains are played by a Wolf and Sylvester, who almost come to blows over who is going to play \"Grandma\".\n\nAnother Sylvester parody is Little Red Rodent Hood (1952).\n\nA few Loopy de Loop cartoons such as \"Tale of a Wolf\" feature Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nJay Ward's Fractured Fairy Tales had a few spoofs of the tale, one of which involved a basket that exploded just before the bearer could say \"goodies\".\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears/Rumpelstiltskin/Little Red Riding Hood/Sleeping Beauty (1984), animated direct-to-video featurette produced by Lee Mendelson Film Productions.\n\nMy Favorite Fairy Tales (Sekai Dōwa Anime Zenshū) (1986), an anime television anthology, has a 12-minute adaptation.\n\nThe anime television series Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics (1987) features Little Red Riding Hood in one episode.\n\nThe Japanese children's anime television series Akazukin Chacha features the eponymous heroine Chacha who is visually reminiscent of Little Red Riding Hood ('akazukin' relates to her red hood and cape). One of the major themes of the series is a sort of pre-adolescent love triangle between Chacha and her two male friends, one of whom is a werewolf, the other a boy-witch.\n\nJetlag Productions' animated film Little Red Riding Hood (1995) adapts the classic fairy tale and at the same time adds its own original twists and additions to the story to stretch the plotline to their regular 48-minute length. The film features three original songs, and was written by George Bloom and produced by Mark Taylor.\n\nJan Kounen directed Le dernier chaperon rouge (1996; The Last Riding Hood, literal translation), a French fantasy musical short film starring Emmanuelle Béart.\n\nDisney Television Animation released Redux Riding Hood (1997), a re-imagining of the ending where the wolf is so traumatized by the failure to catch Little Red Riding Hood that he builds a time machine to go back in time and finish the deed with his past self. The film was nominated for an Academy Award, but lost the award and was shelved by Disney for 14 years before director Steve Moore uploaded the video on YouTube.\n\nThe Japanese animated film Jin-Roh (1999; also known as Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade), about a secret society within an anti-terrorist unit of an alternative post-World War II Japan, makes several literary and visual references to the German oral version of the story (most notably a Rotkäppchen book offered to the main character by one of the female bomb couriers), which is closer to the Perrault version, than the tale of Grimm, with an anti-terrorist commando as the wolf (the title is literally \"Man-wolf\" in Japanese\"), and a former terrorist courier as the young lady.\n\nThe main character of the anime Otogi Jushi Akazukin is a girl named Akazukin, who is a Fairy Musketeer and has to protect a boy named Souta, who's the Elde Key, from the world of Science. Akazukin comes from Fandavale, the world of Magic, and to protect Souta, she has the help of Val, her Wolf Familiar and the other two Musketeers, Shirayuki (Snow White) and Ibara (Sleeping Beauty). The enemies are Randagio (one of the Bremen Town Musicians), Hansel and Gretel, who work for Cinderella, who wants the Elde's Key.\n\nThe animated children's film, Hoodwinked! (2005), uses the anachronistic parody approach to the tale typified by the Shrek films, envisioning the story as a Rashomon-like mystery in which the anthropomorphised animal police of the forest question the four participants of the story after they are detained for an apparent domestic disturbance that the police suspect is tied to the mysterious \"Goodie Bandit\", a thief who has been stealing sweet shop store owners' books. One by one, each character is interviewed and explains to the police their story of how they got to Granny's house and why, and each story is followed by a lengthy flashback. All four characters are discovered to not quite be what they initially appear to be, and all of their stories overlap with each other:\n\nRed Puckett is a worldly wise delivery girl, who gets her name from the red hooded cloak she wears. She is determined to protect her Granny's recipe book after someone breaks into Granny's store.\n\nGranny Puckett secretly lives a double life as an extreme sports athlete named \"Triple G\". She participates in a ski race and is nearly killed by the Bandit's henchmen. After incapacitating them by staging an avalanche, she ends up bound and gagged in her own closet when the parachute and ripcord she uses to escape get caught in her ceiling fan after she comes down the chimney.\n\nThe Wolf (full name Wolf W. Wolf) is an investigative journalist. He and his assistant, a hyperactive squirrel named Twitchy, think that Red is somehow involved in the Goodie Bandit thefts.\n\nKirk Kirkkendall, the woodsman, is not a lumberjack, but an out-of-work actor who spends his days selling schnitzel out of a truck and has just been auditioned for a foot ointment commercial. After someone raids and he cannibalizes his truck, he starts cutting down trees with an axe to try to get into the shoes of a woodsman. He is accidentally thrown through Granny's cottage window after trying to cut down a very large tree.\n\nIn the film Shrek the Third (2007), Little Red Riding Hood is portrayed as one of the villainesses; she is seen pick pocketing in one scene during Prince Charming's pillage. The Big Bad Wolf is considered one of the good guys.\n\n\"Red Riding Hood\" is a character in Super Why! (2007), in which she calls herself \"Wonder Red,\" wears roller blades, and has \"Word Power\".\n\nThe anime Okami-san and her Seven Companions (2010) is based around the characters Ryōko Ōkami (Ōkami meaning wolf), Ryōshi Morino (his name also meaning \"The Forest's Hunter\" in Japanese) and Ringo Akai (representing Little Red Riding Hood) and the rest of the \"trading\" club named the \"Otogi High School Bank\" as they fix students' problems, whatever they may be, in exchange for the students helping them out later. Almost all of the characters in the anime are based on characters from Little Red Riding Hood or other fairy tales. The ending theme song, \"Akazukin-chan Goyoujin\" (Little Red Riding Hood, Be Careful) by OToGi, makes many references to Little Red Riding Hood and its characters as well.\n\nIn the Mattel doll franchise and web series, Ever After High, Cerise Hood is the daughter of both Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. She shares her father's ears and even has a pet wolf named Carmine. She also has a sister named Ramona Badwolf.\n\nThe character Ruby Rose in the web series RWBY is inspired by Red Riding Hood, as Ruby wears a red hood and fights against werewolves in the series reveal 'Red' Trailer.\n\nIn a 1960 Popeye film called Little Olive Riding Hood, Olive is using a red hood and delivering hamburgers to her sick friend, Wimpy. The Sea Hag wants those hamburgers for herself.\n\nGrey Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood is a 1990 satirical claymation film produced by Garri Bardin\n\nThe Grimm Variations is a 2024 Netflix anime series, features a retelling of the story. Set in a dystopia where people avoid the real world by entering a virtual reality, the Big Bad Wolf is portrayed as a human serial killer called Grey. Grey kills women to give himself a real-world experience, but then is arranged to meet a woman named Scarlet (Little Red Riding Hood), whom is revealed to also a killer.\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 1960s, María Garcia starred as Little Red Riding Hood in a trilogy of Mexican films by director Roberto Rodriguez, which were then re-dubbed in English and released in the United States courtesy of K. Gordon Murray: the so-called \"King of the Kiddie Matinee\". These films were: La Caperucita roja (Little Red Riding Hood, 1960), Caperucita y sus tres amigos (Little Red Riding Hood and Her Friends/Little Red Riding Hood and Her Three Friends , 1961) and Caperucita y Pulgarcito contra los monstruos (Little Red Riding Hood and the Monsters, 1962). The latter of these films also starred Cesáreo Quezadas, who reprised his recurring role of Pulgarcito (Tom Thumb).\n\nLiza Minnelli starred in the television film The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood (1965), with Cyril Ritchard as the Wolf and Vic Damone as the huntsman. This revisionist fairy tale is told from the Wolf's point of view.[citation needed]\n\nThe Soviet film studio Belarusfilm (1977) made the film Pro Krasnuyu Shapochku (About Red Hat (Russian: Про Красную Шапочку) (in Russian).\n\nArtist Red Grooms made a 16-minute farcical film version in 1978 starring his daughter Saskia. In 2014 it was combined with a 1984 immersive sculptural work, The Alley, into an exhibition titled Beware a Wolf in the Alley.[4][5]\n\nFilmmaker Neil Jordan's horror/fantasy film The Company of Wolves (1984), based on the eponymous short story by Angela Carter, told an interweaving series of folkloric tales loosely based on Red Riding Hood that fully exploited its subtexts of lycanthropy, violence and sexual awakening.\n\nIn the Japanese live-action film The Red Spectacles (1987; aka Akai Megane), the featured \"young lady\" (as mentioned in the French and German versions of the tale), an allegory for Fate, is dressed like Little Red Riding Hood. An anime version of this character appeared later in the film's sequel, Jin-Roh.\n\nRed Riding Hood (1987), starring Isabella Rossellini and Craig T. Nelson, is an American/Israeli musical film directed by Adam Brooks.\n\nBye bye chaperon rouge (1990), a Canadian/Hungarian production directed by Márta Mészáros.\n\nCBC's television film adaptation, The Trial of Red Riding Hood (1992), starring figure skater Elizabeth Manley, premiered on the Disney Channel in 1994.\n\nFreeway (1996), starring Kiefer Sutherland and Reese Witherspoon, adapts the story[6] into a modern setting in which the major characters become a psychotic but charming serial killer (named Bob Wolverton) and a sexually abused teenage girl.\n\nChristina Ricci starred in Little Red Riding Hood (1997), a short film based on the subject matter.\n\nThe Belgian short film Black XXX-Mas (1999) translates the story to a nightmarish, futuristic urban setting. \"The Forest\" is the nickname for the junglelike city, and \"Wolfy\" is a crooked police officer who hounds this film's Little Red.\n\nThe Kenneth Liu short film Falsehood (2001) refigures the Little Red Riding Hood story as a legal drama, with the Big Bad Wolf on trial and Little Bo Peep as his attorney. Scenes between Peep and the Wolf pay homage to the Clarice Starling/Hannibal Lecter scenes in The Silence of the Lambs (1991).\n\nThe horror film Red Riding Hood (2003), directed by Giacomo Cimini, was a darker take on the classic story.\n\nSingaporean cult director Tzang Merwyn Tong directed the 45-minute short film A Wicked Tale (2005).\n\nThe film Hard Candy (2005), in which a young girl ensnares and tortures a suspected paedophile, was not originally intended to be a Red Riding Hood homage; however, the film's star, Elliot Page, incidentally chose a red hoodie to wear in the final scenes, giving them an unintended metaphoric subtext that was later exploited in advertising for the film.[7]\n\nHoodwinked is a 2006 animated movie directed by Cory Edwards and stars Anne Hathaway, Glenn Close, Jim Belushi and Patrick Warburton.\n\nRed Riding Hood (2006) is a musical film adaptation directed by Randal Kleiser and test-released in late 2004. The experimental virtual reality features were then enhanced for over an additional year. The film stars Morgan Thompson as \"Red\"; also among the actors are Henry Cavill, Ashley Rose Orr, Andrea Bowen, and music opera entertainers well known on Broadway: Lainie Kazan, Debi Mazar, and Joey Fatone.\n\nThe short film Big Bad Wolves (2006)[citation needed] by Rajneel Singh takes a black-comedy-meets-fantasy approach by having the story told from the point of view of Tarantino-style gangsters who try to convince each other that it is actually a fable about female sexuality. This version features a more classic, fairy tale approach to the narrative and visuals, but also utilizes a werewolf as a literal sexual predator.\n\nThe horror anthology film Trick 'r Treat (2007) contains one story thread inspired by the tale. A girl, played by Anna Paquin, dresses up as Little Red Riding Hood for a Halloween party, but is waylaid by a serial killer in the woods. However, the story twists when she reveals herself to be a werewolf seeking her \"first time\".\n\nThe 2007 family film Enchanted depicts Red Riding Hood as the villainess of the story who 'tells it a little bit differently' when relating the events of the fairy tale. Princess Giselle claims that her chipmunk sidekick stopped Red from hacking the innocent wolf to death with an axe.\n\nThe slasher film Red Riding Hood – The Blood of Red Riding Hood is based on the story.[8]\n\nThe Syfy film Red: Werewolf Hunter (2010)[9][10] starring Felicia Day, is a modern, action-film take on the story.[11]\n\nThe film Red Riding Hood (2011), starring Amanda Seyfried, is a period romance/horror film based on the fairy tale.\n\nThe Dutch short film Rood (2013; Red) tells the story of what would have happened if Little Red Riding Hood grew up after the events in the original fairy tale.\n\nThe film Red (2014),[citation needed][12] starring Jodelle Ferland and Claudia Christian, is a modern adaptation and a low-budget psychological thriller shot in San Francisco.\n\nThe short film Slut (2014), directed by Chloe Okuno, tells the story of a naive young girl who becomes the target of a murderous sociopath when she attempts to reinvent herself to impress the boys in her small Texas town.[13]\n\nThe film Avengers Grimm (2015) sees Red accompanying the princesses Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella and Rapunzel into the modern world while the princesses try to stop the escaped Rumpelstiltskin, although Red's only focus is the death of Rumplestiltskin's ally, the Wolf- depicted as a well-built human- to the point that she is considered a danger by the princesses' leader Snow White.\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1974, The Carol Burnett Show featured a retelling of La Caperucita Roja, the Mexican version of Little Red Riding Hood, with Carol Burnett as La Caperucita Roja (Little Red Riding Hood), Carl Reiner as El Toro the Bull (instead of a wolf) and Harvey Korman as the Grandmother.[citation needed]\n\nProbably the most famous use of Little Red Riding Hood in television advertising is the Chanel No. 5 commercial directed by Luc Besson with music by Danny Elfman and starring Estella Warren. In this advertisement, Warren plays a modern-day Red Riding Hood getting ready to enjoy the Paris nightlife, much to the lamentation of her household wolf. The commercial can be viewed here.[14]\n\nFaerie Tale Theatre adapted Little Red Riding Hood in a season 2 episode, starring Mary Steenburgen as the title character.\n\nIn the season 5 episode of Charmed entitled \"Happily Ever After\", Piper Halliwell is transformed into Little Red Riding Hood by an evil queen who recently escaped from her magic mirror prison. Her deceased grandmother becomes corporeal again, but is swallowed whole by a wolf sent by the queen. The wolf now in the form of the grandmother then swallows Piper whole to fulfill the queen's plan, but Piper uses her power and blows the wolf up from the inside, freeing herself and her grandmother. Piper then enters the queen's realm through a fairy tales book and destroys the queen.\n\nIn the 2011 ABC TV series Once Upon a Time, a different take on the tale was told during the episode \"Red-Handed\". The village they lived in was plagued by deadly werewolf attacks and several hunters have been plotting to kill the beast. Red initially assumes that the beast was her boyfriend Peter so she decides to tie him around a tree to help control him. Her plan eventually backfires when the beast was later revealed to be herself. Granny then reveals that it all started when she was bit by her late husband, thus their children and grandchildren metamorphosed into werewolves as well. She eventually lost the ability to metamorphose at a later age but still has the scent. She had asked a wizard to make a red cloak for Red to wear to control it. In Storybrooke, Granny becomes the owner of the town's inn while her granddaughter, now named Ruby, is an unruly young woman who wants to leave town, but stays to care for her and help out with the family business. Red Riding Hood is played by Meghan Ory.\n\nOn the television show Grimm, the tale is re-imagined in the pilot. In it, a lycanthropic creature kidnaps young girls who wear red hoodies/jackets. He lures them by leaving a small figurine. The main character must find him after a little girl is reported missing on her way to her grandfather's house.\n\nThough not explicitly an adaptation, in an episode of Kamen Rider Ghost entitled \"Real Worth! The Power of Fun!\", Takeru Tenkuji transforms into Kamen Rider Ghost Mugen Damashii in the Dream World, while dressed as Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nIn the 2014 TV series The Librarians, during an episode entitled \"And the Fables of Doom\", fairy tales come to life in a small town. One of the fairy tales referenced is Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nLiterature\n\n[edit]\n\nComics\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Tales of Asgard section of Marvel Comics' series Journey into Mystery No. 114 (1965 March), a story which at the end claims to be the basis of Little Red Riding Hood appears. The goddess Iduna walks through the forests of Asgard carrying a bundle of golden apples. These \"Golden Apples of Immortality\" are for All-Father Odin, and Iduna brings them to him every year. Along her journey she meets Haakun the Hunter. Haakun greets her warmly and tells her to go in peace. As Iðunn continues further down the path, wearing her crimson cloak and hood, Fenris the Wolf-God sees her and transforms himself. Iduna next comes upon \"a frail stranger\". The stranger offers Iduna protection along her journey, but she declines the offer. The stranger takes a strong interest in Iduna's basket and begins asking her questions. She quickly grows suspicious, saying his hands seem so grasping -so brutal, and he has an odd voice, like the guttural snarl of a wild beast. She finds his manner sinister-frightening, and says his eyes burn with hatred-with pure savagery. She then discovers that the stranger is actually Fenris the Wolf-God in disguise. Fenris shapeshifts into his true form and attacks her. Haakun the Hunter arrives and drives Fenris away with his enchanted battle ax, causing the Wolf to shrink in an attempt to escape. The ax pursues Fenris and finally strikes him, spiriting him off to the shadowy land of Varinheim.\n\nNeil Gaiman worked a darker, more erotic, pre-Perrault version of the Red Riding Hood tale in The Doll's House arc of The Sandman comics (1995). In this version, the wolf kills the old lady, tricks the girl into eating her grandmother's meat and drinking her blood, orders the girl to undress and lie in bed with him, and finally devours her. According to Gaiman, his portrayal of the tale was based on the one reported in Robert Darnton's book The Great Cat Massacre: And Other Episodes in French Cultural History.[15]\n\nBoth the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood are characters in the Fables comic book universe (2002–2015). The Big Bad Wolf has taken on a human form and becomes known as Bigby Wolf. He is the sheriff of Fabletown when the series begins. The figure of Red Riding Hood (\"Ride\") appears three times. The first two instances are actually spies working for the Fables' enemy The Adversary, magically disguising themselves as Little Red Riding Hood (the second of which is actually the witch Baba Yaga). The third Red Riding Hood seems to be the genuine article.\n\nIn Kaori Yuki's manga Ludwig Kakumei (2004–2007), Red Riding Hood is an infamous assassin whose first victims are her parents, after she is tricked by the Prince.\n\nThe character \"Red\", in the webcomic No Rest for the Wicked (2003–present), lives alone in the woods and always carries an axe with her. After being attacked by a wolf (which she has presumably killed and eaten), she has systematically killed many other wolves in the forest.\n\nBenkyo Tamaoki created a twisted and dark version of Red Riding Hood in the manga Tokyo Red Hood (2003–2004). It is about a demonic girl dressed as Red Riding Hood who wanted to be devoured by a creature only known as Mr. Wolf.\n\nAn adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood in Zenescope's Grimm Fairy Tales comic series depicts Red Riding Hood as a teenage girl nicknamed Red who is going off to bring food to her sick grandmother, who lives deep in the woods. Red gets attacked by a werewolf that kills her grandmother and attacks Red. Red is saved by the woodsman, named Samson, and the werewolf turns out be a former lover. This story was a teenager's dream sequence after she gets into a fight with her boyfriend, who wanted to have sex with her.\n\nThe manga One Piece references Red Riding Hood in chapter 413: \"The Hunter\". One of the protagonists, Sogeking, wears a red cloak and is almost killed by a \"wolfman\", Jyabura. He is saved by Sanji, \"the hunter\". Later on, Jyabura, attempting to bluff his way out of a fight, depicts Nico Robin (in a red hood) as his sister.\n\nStreetfables published a modern, urban adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood called Red.[16]\n\nIssue No. 1 of the Marvel Comics series Spider-Man Fairy Tales (2007) is an adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood, with Mary Jane Watson as the protagonist.\n\nIn Shaun Healey's webcomic EverAfter, Little Red Riding Hood is depicted as having gone insane inside the Big Bad Wolf's belly, and emerged a violent sociopath who chopped up the woodsman with his own saw, and needed to be placed in the EverAfter Maximum Security Asylum, along with other twisted fairy tale characters ranging from Tom Thumb to Goldilocks, Hansel and Gretel, Miss Muffet, etc., all under the care of President Humpty Dumpty and Dr. Crooked (from a nursery rhyme).\n\nSerena Valentino and Foo Swee Chin wrote and illustrated an adaptation of Red Riding Hood in Nightmares & Fairy Tales No. 8, wherein Red is known as Luna. This comic version focuses on Luna's struggle to cope with her fellow villagers' intense disdain for wolves. When a supposedly \"dead\" wolf kills her father, Luna sympathizes with the animal more than her parent, causing her mother to throw her out of the house in a fit of rage. Luna befriends a kind young man on the way to her grandmother's house and eventually discovers that her grandmother is a werewolf. When Luna's mother arrives and kills Luna's werewolf-grandmother, Luna begins to shapeshift into a white wolf but is spared a gruesome death when her friend, in werewolf-form, rescues her.\n\nCollections\n\n[edit]\n\nMany of the short stories and poems (as well as many older texts) are collected in The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood by Jack Zipes.\n\nNovels\n\n[edit]\n\nWolf by Gillian Cross (1990), winner of the 1991 Carnegie Medal. This is a very loose adaptation of the tale set in the modern day.\n\nCaperucita en Manhattan by Carmen Martín Gaite (1990).\n\nWitches Abroad by Terry Pratchett (1991) parodies a number of fairy tales, including Little Red Riding Hood. In this version Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg stop the wolf before it has a chance to eat the grandmother (much to its own relief, as it's acting against its will). Nanny Ogg remembers hearing about the same thing happening a couple of villages away, when she was a girl. She also refers obliquely to an incident when she visited her grandmother in a red hood, involving \"Sumpkins the lodger\".\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood in the Red Light District by Manlio Argueta (1998).\n\nDarkest Desire: The Wolf's Own Tale by Anthony Schmitz (1998).\n\nLow Red Moon by Caitlín R.

After her grandmother's death, Roudette took the skin and combined it with her pre-existing red cloak; initially enchanted to block magic, Roudette had the runes changed so that they deflect fairy magic, the combination of the two cloaks making Roudette immune to magic cast on her directly and able to transform into a wolf.
