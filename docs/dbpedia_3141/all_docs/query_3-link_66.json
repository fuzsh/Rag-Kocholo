        "text": "Ghost Trick extended trailer. The last clip I shared for this Capcom title – an original adventure/puzzle game from the Ace Attorney series’ director and producer – didn’t demonstrate Ghost Trick’s concept, but the second half of this video amends that.\n\nHere, you can see snippets of how you can possess different objects to prevent other characters from dying (e.g. knocking a gun out of a killer hand with an unfolding ladder, distracting a girl by moving a food cart). You also get to see a dude bust out his Michael Jackson moves around 1:43 – the animation paired with the Lupin-esque character designs looks hella slick.\n\nGhost Trick is expected to release in Japan in 2010.\n\n[Via GoNintendo]\n\n“Finale” by SouA. If people keep producing Muramasa fanart like this, there’s no way I’ll be able to stop sharing it. Nice to see a game that inspires the community to create artwork of a non-pornographic variety, in addition to the usual stuff.\n\nBuy: Muramasa: The Demon Blade ($46.99)\n\nSee also: Probably too much Muramasa stuff by now\n\nFlyer for the Data Beez tour, bringing a group of NY chiptune artists to the West Coast for a series of performances. If you’re in LA, San Francisco, Portland, or Seattle this month, you had better go to this thing. I’d go and I’m terrified of being in any place that isn’t my house or Target.\n\nOn November 7, before the LA show begins, Attract Mode and the artists will present a chip music workshop at the Japanese American National Museum. Rad opportunity to learn more about whatever it is these people do to make sounds come out of hardware!\n\nChiptune concerts other than Blip Festival are so rare that, if you have the opportunity, you should really check it out! I’d be really sad if I had missed Datapop this year in Austin.\n\n[Via Eric]\n\n“A Crimson Rose and a Gin Tonic” by YMCK, from the Katamari Forever soundtrack. This is the last YMCK video for a while, but I was reminded of this last week when I was looking for new YMCK content, and I had to post it.\n\nIf my YMCK posts last week were a response to a kind of crummy (for no reason) week, let’s say this one, which combines two of my favorite things ever (Katamari and YMCK) is going to help us start this week off right. Or something.\n\nA group of Nintendo dudes riding the subway. Unfortunately, the only name I’ve seen to credit this art to is the white “Vicki” inscription on the bottom right.\n\nI’ve talked about subways a lot here lately, and I’m not sure why! Cincinnati (the uneventful city I call home) doesn’t even have anything resembling a decent mass transit system. Anyway, subways are great because they give you an excuse to play with friends like Marth and Jigglypuff. You know, your true friends.\n\nSeeing two Links on a train also reminds me that The Legend Of Zelda: Spirit Tracks releases in just over a month. How did that happen?\n\nPreorder: The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks\n\nLa Mulana test footage. Please keep in mind that this is not meant to serve as a trailer, as there are incomplete portions and placeholder graphics in the video. Developer Nigoro just wanted to show off its progress updating the indie platformer’s graphics for WiiWare.\n\nNigoro is looking for suggestions on what game settings fans want included with La Mulana. So far, this config screen enables you to adjust the controls (a few buttons are grayed out because the player is using Wii Remote instead of a Classic Cotnroller), screen size/position, and music/sound effects volume.\n\nOn the topic of Nicalis-published games, I’m surprised by the backlash the company’s received lately. It seems as if you can’t mention Cave Story, Night Sky, or La Mulana without someone scourging Nicalis for failling to ship its announced gamed yet. While it was a serious mistake for the publisher to predict that Cave Story would ship late last year (and while I disagree with the DLC Nicalis has planned for the remake), some of the complaints I’ve read have this immature, self-entitled attitude to them.\n\nI know it’s been a long wait, but games take time to make!\n\nSee also: La-Mulana’s WiiWare trailer\n\nFive minutes of Again (English introduction). The clip’s first half is all dialogue, so skip to 2:25 if you just want to see the 3D investigation sections. The FBI mystery story has potential, though – stick through it for a taste of what Cing, the same developer behind Hotel Dusk and Another Code, is working on now.\n\nI know some gamers are disappointed that this lacks Hotel Dusk’s “Take on Me”-esque visuals, but I really like the animation on the digitized actors, even if they’re re-used. I could totally eat potato chips to this.\n\nSee also: Again TGS Trailer\n\nPreorder: Again: FBI Chou-Shinri Shousakan\n\n[Via Manmedaz]\n\nWhile in Guam, this Japanese gamer took a shuttle bus to Two Lovers Point (or Puntan Dos Amantes), a cliffside park with a tragic love story behind its name and a gorgeous view that’s attracted more than a few weddings.\n\nThe “Love Bell” at the site is supposed to bring good luck to couples that pull its rope together. You can’t see it on the DS’s screens, but the photographer brought his virtual girlfriend from Konami’s dating sim Love Plus to ring the bell with him.\n\nTwo Lovers Point has a “Lover’s Leap” legend that’s appropriate for this photo, as it’s a tale of forbidden love:\n\nRead more"
