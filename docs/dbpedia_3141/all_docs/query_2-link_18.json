On the way, she is stopped by a wolf, who asks her where she is going. Too innocent to be afraid, she tells him, and they go their separate ways. Specifically: the wolf takes a shortcut to the grandmother's house, impersonates Little Red Riding Hood, and swallows the grandmother whole.\n\nWhen the little girl arrives, the wolf has dressed himself in the old woman's bedclothes and gotten into bed. Red Riding Hood, growing worried, remarks on how unusual her \"grandmother\" looks:\n\n\"Grandmother, what big arms you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to hug you with, my dear.\"\n\nThe dialogue continues in this pattern (but omits Grandma, What Massive Hotness You Have!) until she makes the comment:\n\n\"Grandmother, what big teeth you have!\"\n\n\"All the better to eat you with, my dear!\"\n\nAnd the wolf springs and devours her.\n\nDepending on the version, the girl and her grandmother may be rescued by a passing huntsman or other benefactor, whereupon they may take revenge upon the wolf (in \"Rotkäppchen\", they fill the wolf's belly with stones). In Perrault's version, however, the story ends with the girl's death, followed by a moral warning young ladies to beware of \"wolves\", especially those who are \"charming, quiet, unassuming, complacent, and sweet\". French folk versions (such as this one), which do not feature the red hat, have the heroine deduce the problem before the wolf eats her, and escape by saying she needs to visit the bathroom; folklorists believe this is the older version.\n\nAn Homage to this story appears in the song \"Hey Little Red Riding Hood\" which makes the wolf out as a would-be suitor rather than a vicious animal wanting to consume her for food. This may be closer to the original version of the story, which some scholars believe to be a tale of seduction, with the red cape symbolizing menstruation, and therefore fertility. Of course, that does hit the slight problem that Perrault introduced the red cape. In the original folktales, no mention was made of any particular article of clothing, let alone its color.\n\nThey made a nice little video game based on the story. And a not so nice one, too.\n\nThe most recent film rendition of the story features a 2011 live-action film treatment starring Amanda Seyfried as the eponymous heroine, and a wolf based more in the supernatural realm. It's also the basis for the pilot episode of the 2011 TV series Grimm, in which a young girl in a red hoodie is abducted by a shapechanging wolf-creature.\n\nSuch a ubiquitous story is naturally a Fountain of Expies:\n\nA little girl who dresses in red and winds up in danger is a common motif; she's Little Dead Riding Hood.\n\nAlso popular are revisionist retellings where Red takes matters into her own hands and kicks some wolf butt; she's Little Red Fighting Hood.\n\nThe Big Bad Wolf has his own trope, not to mention probably inspiring the names of Big Bad and Big Badass Wolf.\n\nNot really related (usually), but with an obvious Homage in the Trope Namer, is Grandma, What Massive Hotness You Have!.\n\nAdaptations or works that revolve around this fairytale include:[]\n\nThe Company of Wolves\n\nFreeway (1996 crime/black comedy film which takes inspiration from the tale)\n\nHoodwinked (a parody of the story)\n\nInto the Woods (takes several well-known fairy tales, including this one, and weaves them into one story)\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ\n\nLittle Red Riding Rabbit\n\nOnce Upon a Time (same deal as Into the Woods)\n\nThe Path\n\nRed Hood's Revenge\n\nRed Hot Riding Hood\n\nRed Riding Hood (2011 film)\n\n\"Little Red Riding Hood\" contains examples of the following tropes:[]"
