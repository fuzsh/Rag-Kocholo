        "text": "Quite a literal approach to the words \"Zombie BBQ\"\n\nUser Rating: 7.5 | Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ DS\n\nNow, I'm not sure why the game developers decided to call this game as it is but I was a bit surprised by its gameplay cause it's actually pretty fun.\n\nThe game is pretty much space invaders in 3d. You have a choice between a male and female character that shoots but can only go left and right. And you have enemies walking down the screen trying to eat your head-off. As retro as this may sound, the addition of multiple weapons and grenades to its somewhat simplistic gameplay actually made the game fun to play. There are a bunch of other things that you should worry about other than the zombies like coffins, gas filled barrels to fry those zombies up, etc etc.\n\nEverything here is in good looking 3d with the exception of your character, which sadly makes them look like one of those old school actors acting in front of a rolling film on a white screen. The reason for that however is immediately going to surface because the game has some serious performance issues. The game goes into a crawl when there is a hefty number of zombies on the screen. It could have been fixed if they created a pre-rendered background, but I guess it would look weird given its camera angle.\n\nThe game tends to get on the repetitive side and the only break you'll get from the occasional shoot everything that moves theme of the game is when you end up with the stage boss which are well done. The levels in my opinion is quite on the lengthy side and if you're going to play this game on-the-go, you might have issues because you cannot save in the middle of a level. Pausing it and then trying to finish the level so it can auto save on its own might work though.\n\nThe controls is pretty easy to master. The touchscreen is used to move and shoot but you can also use the directional pad to move left or right. You simply point to the direction you want your character to shoot at, lift the stylus to reload, double-tap to throw a grenade, etc etc.\n\nIf there's anything that held this game down in my opinion, its probably the repetitive experience that you're gonna get from shooting wave after wave of zombies. Add to that the slowdown issue that ruins a what supposed to be hectic shooting game, the game only deserves a 7.5. Which is still a really good rating for such a title.\n\n.:My reviews are only as good as everyone else's. Take every single one of them with a grain of salt:.\n\nOther Helpful Reviews for Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ\n\nRating:7\n\nA decent shooting game with a great theme, let down by a poor frame-rate\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood and ninja accomplice Momotaro travel through Fairy Tale Land, mauling through the zombie-infected citizens as they try to end the plague that has taken over their land.
