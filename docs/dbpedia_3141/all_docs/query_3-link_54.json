Drag over these awesome Zombie Halloween Cookies!\n\nSubmitted by Brittany DeMauro of Wholesale Party Supplies and crafted by Ally from Ally Bakes; these spooky sweets are sure to add a fun and freaky flair to any Halloween event!\n\nDIY Zombie Halloween Cookies\n\nYou’ll need to whip up a batch of dough and icing before going onto the steps below. Check out this recipe for sugar cookie dough and royal icing here.\n\nDecorated Zombie Cookie Ingredients and Tools\n\nBaked zombie sugar cookies\n\nRoyal icing\n\nPiping bags, round piping tip, star piping tip\n\nGel food coloring\n\nEdible marker\n\nBlack, blue\n\nScribe Tool OR Toothpick\n\nFood safe paintbrush\n\nLemon extract\n\nHave your baked zombie sugar cookies ready to decorate! Make sure they are completely cooled down before adding any icing.\n\nMix royal icing with green gel food coloring. We don’t want the icing to slip off the cookie, so make sure the icing consistency is slightly harder than flood consistency but still able to smooth out. Using a small round piping tip, pipe on the zombie’s head.\n\nWith the same green icing, add the legs and arms. Make jagged lines at the top of each leg and arm – we’ll need that space for the ripped clothing! Also, with the same green, place a thin layer of icing onto random spots. That will also be used to create the illusion of ripped clothing. Use the scribe tool (or toothpick) to drag out and make the jagged lines more defined.\n\nMix red, blue, and brown icing. Mix the icing to a flood consistency. Now, pipe the shirts on and around any of the green random splotches we added in the previous step. At the bottom of each shirt, make a jagged line for the effect of a ripped and old shirt.\n\nLooking Good, Right??\n\nUsing black gel coloring, add a little to the royal icing mix. Using a little of the black gel food coloring will give you a grey color instead of full-on black. You will need to mix this icing into a flood consistency again. Using a small round tip, pipe the pants on to the zombies. Using the scribe, drag the icing into places that might be too small for your tip to reach. This way, you’ll get more precise lines.\n\nNow it’s time to add the scary faces! Using the same icing that was previously used for the pants, pipe on dots for the eyes and any type of mouth shape. Leave some space at the top since we will be adding some hair in a later step.\n\nUsing the edible black marker, we’ll add some stitches to the zombie’s heads. Draw a line and then add more lines across of it to create a stitch. Try not to go up too high on the head since the hair will cover it.\n\nZombies can still have luscious locks! Using the royal icing, mix any hair color you want. No need to change the consistency since we want the icing to hold its shape. Using a small star tip, pipe on the hair.\n\nNow we’ll add some more details to the zombies. Using blue edible marker, mark arm lines onto the blue shirt zombie to define the arm. Using the black edible marker, add some details to the zombie pants such as pockets. Don’t forget to add eyes. Make one pupil larger than the other to get a crazed zombie look!\n\nFinally, in a small bowl add lemon extract and a brown or copper gel food coloring. Use the paintbrush and apply to different parts of the zombies. This will make them look like they’ve been out and about looking for brains and getting dirty!"
