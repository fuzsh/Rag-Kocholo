Jacqueline Hennessy (born November 25, 1968) is a Canadian journalist, television host, and occasional actress. She is the identical twin sister of actress Jill Hennessy.

The Hennessy twins were born in Edmonton, Alberta, of Irish, Italian, Swedish, French, and Ukrainian descent. Jacqueline has a doctorate in French Literature.

Hennessy currently hosts the current affairs program Medical Intelligence for Rogers Cable in Toronto, Ontario. She also serves as associate editor of Chatelaine magazine. Hennessy has won several awards for her work, including the Canadian Nurses Association Award of Merit (recognizing health care reporting) and the Canadian Journalism Federation Greg Clark Award.

Prior to becoming a journalist, Hennessy dabbled in acting alongside her sister. In 1988, the two appeared as twin call girls in the David Cronenberg film, Dead Ringers. They also co-starred in a film written and co-directed by Jill entitled The Acting Class.

One of Hennessy's most visible performances was uncredited. In 1995, Jill Hennessy, who played Claire Kincaid on the NBC crime drama Law & Order, made a couple of crossover appearances as Kincaid on another series, Homicide: Life on the Street. During the filming of one of these crossovers, the production schedules of both shows overlapped. As a result, Jacqueline was recruited to play Kincaid in some courtroom scenes filmed for the Law & Order episode "Corpus Delicti", which aired in January 1996.

In 2008, Hennessy was hired to narrate W Network's and HGTV's Love it or List it.
