        "text": "Former Crossing Jordan star Jill Hennessy, along with Kevin Chapman (Person of Interest), Jere Shea (Passion) and Lauren E. Banks (Instinct) have been cast opposite Kevin Bacon and Aldis Hodge in City on a Hill, Showtime’s drama pilot executive produced by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. All will be series regulars if the project moves forward.\n\nIn addition, Cathy Moriarty, Michael O’Keefe, Amanda Clayton and Rory Culkin are set for guest roles and will recur if the project goes to series.\n\nWritten by Chuck MacLean (Boston Strangler) based on an original idea by Affleck and MacLean, City on a Hill is set in Boston in the early ’90s when the city was rife with violent criminals emboldened by local law-enforcement agencies, in which corruption and racism was the norm, until it all suddenly changed. The drama is a fictional account of what was called the “Boston Miracle.” The change agent is District Attorney Decourcy Ward (Hodge), who comes from Brooklyn and forms an unlikely alliance with Jackie Rhodes (Bacon), a corrupt yet venerated FBI veteran who is deeply invested in maintaining the status quo. Together they take on a family of armored car robbers from Charlestown in a case that grows to encompass and eventually upend Boston’s citywide criminal justice system.\n\nHennessy will play Jenny Rhodes, the feisty wife of Jackie Rhodes (Bacon) who has her own agenda. Chapman is Dickie Minogue, a Boston cop who comes into conflict with Jackie. Shea will play Hank Signa, an investigator for the Suffolk County DA who works with Decourcy Ward (Hodge). Banks will portray Siobhan Quays, an attorney who is the wife of Decourcy Ward (Hodge).\n\nMoriarty is Ma Ryan, the doting mother of Frankie (Jonathan Tucker) and Jimmy (Mark O’Brien) who is too easy on Jimmy and too tough on Frankie. O’Keefe will play Agent Clasby, a retiring FBI agent and former partner of Jackie. Clayton portrays Cathy Ryan, the warm but tough wife of Frankie. Culkin will play Clay Roach, an informant who works for Jackie.\n\nHennessy starred in the long-running series Crossing Jordan and co-starred in such series as Law & Order and Las Vegas. She is repped by APA.\n\nChapman has co-starred in such series as Brotherhood and Person of Interest, with recurring roles in Sneaky Pete, Rescue Me, 24 and Lost. He is repped by Talent Works and Vanguard Management Group.\n\nShea received a Tony nomination for his performance in Broadway’s Passion. His screen credits include Southie and Law & Order as well as the television adaptation of Passion. He is repped by Cornerstone.\n\nBanks’ credits include Instinct and Safe House: A Christian Story. She is repped by CAA.\n\nMoriarty received an Oscar nom for her performance in Raging Bull. Her other credits include Patti Cake$, Analyze That. She is repped by Justice & Ponder and Felker Toczek Suddleson Abramson.\n\nO’Keefe’s credits include Masters of Sex, Homeland, and Sneaky Pete. He’s repped by Paradigm.\n\nClayton starred in If Loving You Is Wrong and has also appeared in NCIS: Los Angeles, Major Crimes, Rizzoli & Isles, Bleed for This and John Carter. She is repped by Abrams Artists and Kind Management.\n\nCulkin’s credits include Sneaky Pete, Law & Order: SVU, Gabriel, Igby Goes Down and You Can Count on Me. He is repped by Paradigm."
