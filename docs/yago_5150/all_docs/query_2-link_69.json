        "text": "Question:I am a big fan of the show \"Crossing Jordan\" and its star Jill Hennessy. Can you tell me when her show will be airing again, and if she has any other projects in the making? —J.C., Las Vegas, Nev.\n\nAnswer: Actress Jill Hennessy and her husband are expecting a baby. Rather than try to write around Hennessy's pregnancy, producers opted to delay the start of the series' third season until after the baby is born. Look for \"Crossing Jordan\" to premiere at midseason. Meanwhile, reruns of the show continue to air on A&E.\n\nQuestion:Is Michelle Trachtenberg (\"Harriet the Spy,\" \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\") scheduled for any new series? — J.M., Tyler, Texas\n\nAnswer: Trachtenberg hasn't announced any new TV deals, but she has completed filming a new movie for release next year. Meanwhile, she's back this year to host the annual \"Truth-or-Scare-a-thon\" on the Discovery Kids Channel, Saturday starting at noon. Trachtenberg played Buffy's little sister Dawn for three years.\n\nQuestion:I love \"The Dead Zone\" on USA. It hasn't been on in a while. Is it coming back? — B.E., via e-mail\n\nAnswer: Anthony Michael Hall and the rest of the \"Dead Zone\" cast are back at work filming season three of the sci-fi series. The new episodes are expected to premiere next summer. USA is currently re-running season 2 of \"The Dead Zone\" on Sunday nights.\n\nQuestion:Is there any way to request that a TV show be released on DVD? So many of my favorites — both old and new series — aren't available. — N.L., Newport News, Va.\n\nAnswer: You can keep abreast of upcoming releases and vote for what you'd like to see released at www.tvshowsondvd.com. Voting is free but you must register. The site lists some 80 new TV titles being released this month, including season 4 of \"The Sopranos,\" seasons 1-4 of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"Battlestar Gallactica,\" seasons 1 and 2 of \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" and Stephen Spielberg's \"Taken\" miniseries.\n\nQuestion:What happened to the lady who plays Kim on \"The Parkers\"? Did she leave the show? — W.W.D., Dallas\n\nAnswer: Countess Vaughn James is a new mom and was still on maternity leave when work began on \"The Parkers\"' fifth season. She returned to the air in the show's Oct.6 episode.\n\nQuestion:Can you tell me whether Joshua Morrow, who plays Nicholas Newman on the soap opera \"The Young & The Restless,\" is the son of the late Vic Morrow? — C.G., Richmond, Va.\n\nAnswer: Same last name, but no relation. Joshua Morrow was born in Juneau, Alaska, and lived in Oregon, Oklahoma and New Mexico before arriving in Hollywood in 1992. He has received a Soap Opera Digest Award and four Daytime Emmy nominations for \"Y&R,\" which he joined in June 1994. The late Vic Morrow, star of TV's \"Combat!,\" had two daughters, producer Carrie Morrow and actress Jennifer Jason Leigh. He died in a 1982 helicopter accident while filming \"Twilight Zone: The Movie.\"\n\nQuestion:Can you tell me more about Alicia Silverstone, from NBC's new show \"Miss Match\"? — J.H., California"
