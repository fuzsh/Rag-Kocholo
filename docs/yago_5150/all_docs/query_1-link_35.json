        "text": "This beautiful article teaches us about end-of-life visions and how comforting they are for the dying and the people who are left behind. Some people think they are hallucinations, but that isn't necessarily true. \"[D]eathbed visions are real, can provide comfort, even heal past trauma. [...T]hey can, in some cases, feel transcendent. [...O]ur minds are capable of conjuring images that help us, at the end, make sense of our lives.\" Then, what's the difference between hallucinations and visions? Hallucinations result from medication, or \"delusional, incoherent thinking, which can also occur at the end of life\". But hallucinations won't provide any comfort to the dying. https://lnkd.in/ekWGqwcQ\n\nToday, we honor the many forms of motherhood and the complex emotions this day may evoke. Whether you're celebrating, grieving, or navigating a mix of emotions, know that you're not alone. To those who have complicated relationships with their mothers, to those who are not mothers but play nurturing roles in the lives of others, and to those who find this day challenging due to past trauma, we see you and honor your journey. Mother's Day can be a beautiful opportunity for celebration and reflection, but it can also be a reminder of loss, longing, or unmet expectations. Whatever your experience may be, we're here to offer support and understanding. Today, let's celebrate the resilience, strength, and love that exists in all of us.

It is difficult to know, until you live it, and watch it, over time, and the rest comes to the surface. Allow opportunities to talk. To regale in old stories, the good and the bad. To celebrate themselves in different times in their lives. Select memorabilia can be helpful in conjuring memories that are empowering , and that remind your loved one that they have been part of something bigger than themselves. Allow time for humor, as much as possible, it is medicinal. Animals and children can be remarkable sources of wisdom and light, to the extent they are part of the natural environment - the generational ties in our home no doubt lengthened the span of my father‚Äôs life. Foster old connections, to the extent your loved one wants, without judgement or projection of your own feelings. Anticipating needs, as mentioned in the article, is so very impactful and important , for dignity, grace , and preservation of identity. Hold close the idea that although caregiving has its challenges, it is truly an existential privilege to care for a loved one at the end of their life. üíó\n\nMost of us face the reality of a loved one dying. If we have the chance, how can we be fully present to them at that time and help them get their needs met? To do so, it a real gift not only to them but to yourself. The article offers ideas on this topic..\n\nAt The Ridge, we redefine healing, providing a therapeutic haven where teens can break free from the cycle of struggles and emerge stronger, more resilient individuals.

What could the final months, weeks, and days of life look like for the person who is dying and the people who love them? The Architecture of Death explores the physical aspect of dying, as well as the unseen felt experiences that can occur, including the changing roles within a family; the potential to heal old wounds; deathbed visions or dreams; messages to loved ones from the dying or recently passed; and a host of other phenomena. Professionals who have spent their careers at the bedside share extraordinary stories as Director Johanna Lynn takes viewers by the hand to explore what death might look like. #leavinginlove #whatmattersmost #mortalitymatinee #councilonaging #deathplan #deathpreparedness #meaningconversations #openconversations #endoflife #endoflifedoula #southshorema"
