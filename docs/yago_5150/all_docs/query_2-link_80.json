        "text": "I always forget that Jill Hennessy has a twin\n\nSo, before Jerry Orbach died, Law & Order: Original Flavor was one of my absolute favorite shows. After Jerry Orbach died, I tried to keep watching it, I really did, because S. Epatha Merkerson and Sam Waterston. But it just wasn’t the same.\n\nAnd during those years when I watched L&O: The First, and Best, One, there was a revolving door letting in assistant district attorneys to Sam Waterston. And the first of these (that I can remember) was ADA Claire Kincaid, aka Jill Hennessy. (Well, the character wasn’t aka Jill Hennessy, but that was the actress’s name, and … you know what? Never mind.)\n\nAfter leaving L&O in a blaze of car-crashing, affair-with-Jack-McCoy-revelating glory, Hennessy went on to star in Crossing Jordan, aka that show I only watched a couple of times when there was nothing else on and books just seemed too heavy and complicated and I swear, I didn’t wait every week for it to come on. And after that …?\n\nLet’s find out, shall we?\n\nJill Hennessy was born in 1968, along with her twin sister, Jacqueline, bringing joy to lovers of attractive brunettes everywhere. Well, eventually, because if you rejoiced when they were babies, then ewwww.\n\nHer first role was in 1988’s Dead Ringers, which is a movie about twin gynecologists, which means you’ve lost me right there. Apparently, it’s quite good, but twin gynecologists. In 1989, she moved on to a television show called The Hitchhiker, which I can only assume was about someone who hitchhiked around America either solving crimes or committing them, with everybody learning a nice little moral lesson at the end. She was in two different episodes under two different names, so possibly two different characters? In 1990, she moved right on along to the role of Hooker on C.B.C.’s Magic Hour. Possibly it was a character whose last name was Hooker, but probably not.\n\nSpeaking of hookers, her first role on the Friday the 13th television series (I know! I’d completely forgotten about it too!) was Spanish hooker. I don’t think she’s really Spanish, though. She also played Vampire Woman, Secretary and Lifeguard over the course of 1989 and 1990, because somebody at Friday the 13th either really liked her or didn’t realize they kept hiring the same woman repeatedly. Also, there used to be a War of the Worlds television series, which I had no idea!, and she was in two episodes with two different names again.\n\nA few more TV series here and there and then, boom, catapulted to fame by 1993’s Robocop 3. Ha, no, I’m just kidding. Nobody watched that. But she was in it, if it shows up one of these days and you’re just too lazy to change the station. (Seriously, though, don’t get caught in that situation.) Also in 1993, she was in some German film that I don’t care about (sorry, Germany!).\n\nBut most importantly in 1993, Law & Order: The Best One of All!\n\nAnd then also in 1994, some movie called The Paper, and in 1996, I Shot Andy Warhol (is the name of the film and not a thing I did).\n\nAfter her stint in Law & Order, she went on to a bunch of movies that I don’t feel like listing, except for Komodo, which I swear one of my other “Whatever happened to…?”s was in too, as Victoria the Shrink. Seriously, there are a lot of them, and I’m not listing them and you can’t make me.\n\nIn 2001, NBC picked up a show about coroners who solve crimes, and I blame CSI for that. That show was Crossing Jordan, which I only watched a few times, and mostly for Miguel Ferrer and Jerry O’Connell. Also? That show was on for six seasons, so I am feeling even less embarrassed about the few episodes I watched because I thought it was only on for two or three years, so I very definitely did not watch all of them.\n\nAnyway, in 2007, Crossing Jordan bid the world of television adieu, and Jill Hennessy went on to some indie film called Lymelife before taking a two-year hiatus until 2010, which saw The Roadie and Small Town Murder Songs, which actually sounds like it should be a Nick Cave album.\n\nSince 2010, I’m not quite sure what she’s been up to, but she did release an album in 2009 and sang at 2010’s Lillith Fair, so let’s just go with “she’s concentrating on her music career.”\n\nPermalink 2 Comments\n\nI don’t think I hate Law & Order: LA\n\nSo, the last couple of weeks, I’ve watched the revamped Law & Order: LA. Sure, I’ve been slightly drunk at the time (because why wouldn’t I be?), but I don’t think it’s all that bad. I never saw the unvamped version of it, so I can’t really say if it’s an improvement or not.\n\nAnd I would never say that it’s better than old-school Law & Order back in its glory days, because that’s just silly. Nothing is better than old-school Law & Order in its glory days.\n\nIt’s just too bad they had to kill off Skeet Ulrich, I guess, but I can’t really say that I’ve ever been a big fan of the guy, so it could’ve been worse. It could’ve been Alfred Molina.\n\nAlso, I always thought Molina was Greek, but they’ve got him playing a Latino? I mean, I get that in Hollywood and in television, you don’t actually have to be a race to play a character of that race, but maybe he is Latino? I guess I don’t care enough to find out.\n\n(But if someone else cares, they can totally tell me in the comments, that’s cool.)\n\nAnd the cases are interesting enough, like last night, they killed a Marine, and you thought it was her boyfriend, but then it turned out to be a bunch of corrupt government officials, so that’s good. (Even though I’m getting the impression they’re planning to really rely on Alfred Molina to carry this show, what with the way they have featured him heavily in all three episodes I’ve seen, and seem to be planning to do so for next week’s episode too.)\n\nAlso, does anybody else find Corey Stoll really, really hot?\n\nPermalink 4 Comments"
