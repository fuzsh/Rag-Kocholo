        "text": "Canadian actress and singer\n\nFor the Australian politician, see Jill Hennessy (politician).\n\nJillian Noel Hennessy (born November 25, 1968) is a Canadian actress and singer. She is best known for her roles on the American television series Law & Order, on which she played prosecutor Claire Kincaid for three seasons, and Crossing Jordan, on which she played the lead character, Jordan Cavanaugh, for six seasons. She has also acted in films such as RoboCop 3 and Most Wanted, and the independent films Chutney Popcorn and The Acting Class, the latter of which she also wrote and co-directed.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHennessy was born in Edmonton, Alberta. Her father, John Hennessy, was a meat salesman and sales/marketing executive, a job that required considerable travel and resulted in frequent moves for the family. Her mother, Maxine, a secretary, left the family in 1982, leaving her daughter to be partially raised by her paternal grandmother, Eleanor, in Kitchener, Ontario.[1] She has a younger brother, John Paul \"J.P.\" Hennessy, Jr., an older sister, Faith and an identical twin sister, Jacqueline, who is a magazine writer and TV show host in Canada. Hennessy has Irish, French, Swedish and Italian ancestry on her father's side, and mostly Ukrainian Roma, as well as Austrian, ancestry on her mother's.[2] She attended Stanley Park Senior Public School and graduated from Grand River Collegiate Institute, both in Kitchener, Ontario,[3] and used to busk in the Toronto subway.[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nHennessy and her sister, Jacqueline, made their acting debut playing twin call girls in 1988's Dead Ringers. She was short listed for the role of Dana Scully on The X-Files according to Gillian Anderson, the actress who eventually chosen for the role.[5]\n\nShe appeared on Broadway in the musical Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story in 1990.\n\nIn 1993, she appeared as Dr. Marie Lazarus in RoboCop 3.\n\nHennesey's big network breakthrough came in 1993, when Dick Wolf signed Hennessy as assistant district attorney Claire Kincaid in the NBC crime drama Law & Order. She played the role for three seasons, leaving the show in 1996.\n\nIn 1999, she appeared as Lisa in Chutney Popcorn. In 2000, Hennessy wrote, produced, and jointly directed (with Elizabeth Holder) an independent film mockumentary titled The Acting Class, which looked at the trials and tribulations of a dysfunctional acting class. The film co-starred her sister, Jacqueline, and included cameo appearances from a number of Hennessy's former Law & Order co-stars. She also appeared in the film Nuremberg, as Elsie Douglas.\n\nIn 2001, she portrayed Jackie Kennedy in the film Jackie, Ethel, Joan: The Women of Camelot. That same year she appeared in a small role as Commander Mulcahy in the Steven Seagal action film Exit Wounds. She received praise from critic Owen Gleiberman who said \"With the right role, Hennessy might just be a movie star.\"[6] In 2003, she made a cameo appearance in the film Abby Singer. From 2001 to 2007, she starred on the TV show Crossing Jordan as title character Jordan Cavanaugh. She also played the wife of Tim Allen's character in the 2007 film Wild Hogs. On June 9, 2007, she received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame.\n\nDuring sessions in Austin, Texas, Hennessy recorded the album Ghost in My Head,[7] which was released in June 2009. She performed as a guest of the Indigo Girls on a November 2009 episode of Mountain Stage,[8] and was the focus of another episode of the show later the same month.[9] She performed at Lilith Fair in 2010.[10]\n\nHennessy starred in the independent crime thriller Small Town Murder Songs in 2010. She also appeared as a veterinarian in the HBO series Luck, and promoted Zaxby's \"Zalads\" in a pair of television commercials in 2012.\n\nIn 2015, Hennessy appeared in several episodes of Madam Secretary,[11][12] and in October of that year, her second album, I Do, was released.[4]\n\nIn 2018, she appeared on the Michael Weatherly series Bull as the mother of the deceased hacker character Cable McCrory.[13] Also in 2018, she began the role of Senator Huntington on the series Yellowstone.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHennessy is multilingual, and fluently speaks English, Italian, French, Spanish, and German.[14] She plays the guitar and sings, and enjoys riding motorcycles with her husband, who she married in 2000. They had a second marriage ceremony in January 2001, which took place at New York City Hall with Mayor Rudy Giuliani officiating. Their first son was born in 2003, and a second was born in 2007.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Minneapolis-based band Mollycuddle wrote the song \"The Ballad of Jill Hennessy\" in honor of the actress.[15] Hennessy was reportedly very pleased and offered to perform with the band on rhythm guitar.[16]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 1988 Dead Ringers Mimsy 1993 RoboCop 3 Dr. Marie Lazarus 1993 Trip nach Tunis Kathryn Darby 1994 Deanne White 1996 I Shot Andy Warhol Laura 1996 Kiss & Tell Interrogator Angela Pierce 1997 Lindsay Hamilton 1997 Most Wanted Dr. Victoria Constantini 1998 Weekend Getaway Lily Short film 1998 Dead Broke Kate 1999 Brenda 1999 Row Your Boat Patti 1999 Two Ninas Mike, The Bartender 1999 Chutney Popcorn Lisa 1999 Molly Susan Brookes 1999 Komodo Dr. Victoria Juno 2000 Amanda Smythe / Jill / Anonymous 2000 Autumn in New York Lynn McCale 2001 Exit Wounds Commander Annette Mulcahy 2002 Pipe Dream Marina Peck 2007 Wild Hogs Kelly Madsen 2007 Game of Life Brenda 2008 Lymelife Brenda Bartlett 2010 Small Town Murder Songs Rita 2011 Roadie Nikki Stevens 2012 Dawn Rider Alice 2013 If I Had Wings Sandy Taylor 2017 Don't Sleep Cindy Bradford 2019 Crypto Robin Whiting 2019 Standing Up, Falling Down Vanessa 2022 The Road to Galena Teresa Baird 2024 Madame Web National Security Agency (NSA) Agent\n\nTelevision Year Title Role Notes 1987 Not My Department Twin Makeup Artist Episode: \"Let's Make Gold\" 1988 War of the Worlds Patty Episode: \"Goliath Is My Name\" 1989 Marla Episode: \"Striptease\" 1989 Elisabeth Episode: \"Pawns\" 1989–1990 Friday the 13th: The Series Various 4 episodes 1990 C.B.C.'s Magic Hour Hooker Episode: \"The Prom\" 1990 War of the Worlds Scott Episode: \"Max\" 1990 Counterstrike Lex Episode: \"The Dealbreaker\" 1992 Flying Blind Lauren Benjamin Episode: \"Crazy for You... and You\" 1993–1996 Law & Order Assistant District Attorney Claire Kincaid 68 episodes\n\nNominated—Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series (1995–97) 1996 Homicide: Life on the Street Assistant District Attorney Claire Kincaid Episode: \"For God and Country\" 2000 Nuremberg Elsie Douglas Television movie\n\nSatellite Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film 2001 Jackie, Ethel, Joan: The Women of Camelot Jackie Kennedy Television movie\n\nNominated—Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film 2001–2007 Crossing Jordan Dr. Jordan Cavanaugh 115 episodes\n\nGracie Allen Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series 2004–2006 Las Vegas Dr. Jordan Cavanaugh 3 episodes 2011–2012 Luck Jo 9 episodes 2012 Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town Agnes Leacock Television movie\n\nNominated—Canadian Screen Award for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film 2013 Jo Sister Karyn 8 episodes 2014 The Good Wife Rayna Hecht 2 episodes 2015 Madam Secretary Jane Fellows 15 episodes 2017 Shots Fired Alicia Carr 10 episodes 2017 The Blacklist Margot Rochet Episode: \"The Harem\" 2018 Crawford Cynthia 12 episodes 2018 Yellowstone Senator Huntington Episode: \"Daybreak\" 2018 Bull Ellen 2 episodes 2019–2022 City on a Hill Jenny Rohr 26 episodes 2023 Accused Lynn Harmon Episode \"Scott's Story\"\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBiography portal\n\nFilm portal\n\nTelevision portal\n\nMusic portal"
