        "text": "Eva and Joy Green\n\nEva and Joy Green are the fraternal twin daughters of the renowned Frech actress, Marlene Jobert. Born just two minutes apart, the sisters have expressed how different they are from each other. While Eva went in her mother's footsteps and pursued an acting career, Joy has never been interested in standing in the spotlight, instead, she enjoys her quiet life, raising horses with her husband in Normandy. Neither sound too bad if you ask me.\n\nYou may recognize Eva, who looks like her mother more so than Joy, from movies like Casino Royale (2006) and 300: Rise of an Empire (2014).\n\nAnn Landers and Abigail Van Buren\n\nAnn Landers and Abigail Van Buren are two of the most famous US columnists in the history of the country. Born July 4th, 1918 in Sioux City, Iowa, the sisters have been almost inseparable for most of their lives (but not like in the De Cinque sister's way) but they did have a joint wedding.\n\nThese famous identical twins have written thousands of different columns over the span of their careers, including most notably ‘Dear Abby’. Between these beloved sisters, they have reached over 200 million(!) people with ‘Dear Abby’ alone and were known to receive as much as 15,000 letters from their readers each week.\n\nAnna and Lucy De Cinque\n\nOk, brace yourself because this is going to be the strangest pair on our list. Still reading? Ok, we warned you. Anna and Lucy De Cinque are known as \"The World's Most Identical Twins,\" a title they received after winning a twins competition and they've been monetizing on it ever since. But hey, don't hate. Let's cut to the juicy part. The De Cinque sisters so everything, and we mean everyything together. They often speak at the same time, go to the restroom at the same time, they've never as much as seen a movie apart, AND they share the same boyfriend!\n\nHow does this workout you ask? Well, according to the sisters, perfectly fine. Lucy said in an interview \"There's no jealousy in the relationship. If Ben kissed Anna he will kiss me...It doesn't matter who goes first.\" Anna said that if polygamy was legal in their home country of Australia they'd all get married. There you have it. One big happy (and very strange) family.\n\nBrook and Robin Lopez\n\nBrook and Robin Lopez are both professional basketball players and twin brothers. The two absolutely dominated when they played at Standford, and today they're continuing their athletic careers at the highest league, which is the NBA of course.\n\nAnd get this, today they both play on the same team, the Milwaukee Bucks! Luckily Robin has the hair to help their teammates distinguish between them during games. Or perhaps it doesn't matter which one of them gets the ball, they both know what to do on the court.\n\nJessie and D’Lila Combs\n\nThe lovely Jessie and D’Lila Combs a.k.a. \"The Comb Twins\" are identical twin daughters of musician and businessman, Sean Combs, who you probably know better as Puff Daddy or P. Diddy, and the gorgeous model, Kim Porter. The twins actually very much resemble their late mother who passed away last year.\n\nThe 11-year-old twins are wasting no time, and are already starting to make a name for themselves. They've modeled and have walked down runways, like their mother, and have entertaining social media accounts like their dad. We'll surely see great things come from these two in the future, they'll make their mama proud.\n\nCharlie and Craig Reid\n\nMost of you younger readers may have never heard of The Proclaimers, to be fair, most of the older ones probably haven't either. This Scottish duo are the identical twins behind the band, best known for songs like \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\", \"Sunshine on Leith\", and \"I'm On My Way.\" Who would have guessed that the Scottish duo behind The Proclaimers were identical twins?\n\nCharlie and Craig Reid, who's band have been active since the 80s, and have released 11 studio albums since. And get this, they still tour together today! What a wonderful thing to still be rocking together with your twin and best friend for so many decades.\n\nMelisa and Mikele Barber\n\nThis athletic duo is the American track and field sprint athletes, Melisa and Mikele Barber. Between the two they've managed to rack upon accolades throughout their careers.\n\nMelisa is a three-time (!) U.S. and World Champion while her sister Mikele is an Olympian, who won gold the 4 x 100 meters relay race in 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan, and took the gold again at the 100 meters in the 2007 Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Name a faster duo, we'll wait.\n\nHarry and Luke Treadaway\n\nThese dapper twins are Harry and Luke Treadaway who made their professional debut as conjoined twin brothers in the \"mockumentary\" Brothers Of The Head. Fun fact: during filming they were actually connected to each other for as long as 15 hours a day! They also had to sleep in the same bed to emulate the deep bond of their characters would likely have had.\n\nThey should write a book about such an experiment, could you imagine being attached to someone for that long of a period? No thanks, pass!\n\nPrince Jacques and Princess Gabriella\n\nMonaco's royal twins Jacques and Gabriella are some of the rare people in the world who officially carry the titles, 'Prince' and 'Princess'. They're the son and daughter of Prince Albert II and the gorgeous Princess Charlene.\n\nWhen you see how adorable they are you'll understand how the royal twins steal the show at nearly every public engagement they appear in despite their famous parents. And their cute little outfits re always show stoppers. We can't wait until they're old enough for us to see what their personalities are like.\n\nRonnie and Reggie Kray\n\nThis one here is a throwback but you can't have a list of famous twins without mentioning the most notorious of them all, Ronnie and Reggie Kray, also known as the Kray twins. These infamous English gangsters were born on October 24th, 1933 but nonetheless, their names still strike fear in some, and admiration in others.\n\nThese famous identical twins were part of a popular gang called The Firm, something the two founded in their youth. Back in their prime, the Kray brothers were thought to be the most dangerous criminals in the East End of London. These are two faces, well one face really, that you would never want to cross. When Ronnie was an adult he was actually diagnosed with schizophrenia, not that his brother was any more stable. Today this would probably explain why they ended up being convicted for murder and sentenced to life in jail. So far, two films have been made about the Kray Twins, “The Krays,” which was released in (1990), and “Legend,” (2015).\n\nBrie and Nikki Bella\n\nBrie and Nikki Bella, collectively known as The Bella Sisters, are a WWE professional wrestling tag team. Not exactly what you expected to read when you saw how gorgeous they are, huh? The Bella Sisters rose to fame within the entertainment wrestling world back in 2008, with their most popular move being the “Twin Magic”. You should definitely check it out on YouTube. Smackdown!.\n\nIn 2011, they got the title of WWE Diva Champions., and have since have enjoyed a wide media presence, often appearing on the E! Network with their own shows like Total Divas and Total Bellas, and other WWE-related programs.\n\nAaron and Bryce Dessner\n\nBesides being the founding members of the indie rock band, The National, identical twins Aaron and Bryce Dessner, the two have also individually been behind other musical ensembles. Aaron has another band called Big Red Machine, while Bryce is a composer for the Los Angeles Philharmonic.\n\nThe two have actually been collaborating together since the age of five when they only owned a fife and drum. The twins still inspire each other today when it comes to making music, “You have a sort of feedback loop, where you can bounce things off of each other.” said Bryce in an interview.\n\nMarkieff and Marcus Morris\n\nMarkieff and Marcus Morris both play for the NBA and are both forwards. And, no, they don't play on the same team, Marcus plays for the Boston Celtics, and Markeiff plays for the Washington Wizards. I wonder how confusing that is for their teammates?\n\nThere was a time, however, when the brothers got to play in the same uniform. Back in 2007, the Philly twins played together for the Kansas Jayhawks.\n\nKate and Karen Lawler\n\nKate Louise Lawler was the first woman to win the reality TV show Big Brother UK in its third season back in 2002. After she rose to fame she got many gigs as a TV host and D.J.\n\nShe has a fraternal twin sister named Karen who Kate credits as the one who encouraged her to apply for Big Brother. Her twin obviously knows best, as she actually did end up winning.\n\nLaurent and Larry Nicolas Bourgeois\n\nLaurent and Larry Nicolas Bourgeois more famously known as \"Les Twins\" is probably the most popular French Duo, maybe only second to Daft Punk. They pretty bust guys, they're both dancers, choreographers, designers, models, and the creative directors of their brand \"Eleven Paris.\" Is there anything they can't do?\n\nThey have over 1.2 million followers on their joint Instagram account and another 2 million split between their individual accounts. Oh, and did we mention that they choreographed and danced with Beyonce in her On the Run Tour?! If Queen Bey approves, then they must be the real deal.\n\nWill and Rupert Young\n\nBritish singer-songwriter and actor, Will Young, is one of the UK's most successful TV talent show contestants, having won Pop Idol back in 2001.\n\nMany people may not be aware that Will he has a twin brother, Rupert who prefers to stay out of the spotlight. Can you see the resemblance!? If you're doing your Googles now just be sure not to confuse him with the Rupert Young from the show from Merlin.\n\nJulián and Joaquín Castro\n\nJulián Castro is an American politician, who was a former mayor of San Antonio, and the youngest member of President Obama's Cabinet, serving as the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Quiet an impressive background, aye?\n\nDon't worry, you're not seeing double in this picture, Julián's mirror image is, in fact, his identical twin brother Joaquín Castro. Joaquín, who also happens to be in politics, is a congressman! We're sure they're parents are proud that they are both trying to make a difference in the country.\n\nAlexis and Ava McClure\n\nAva and Alexis McClure, better known as “the McClure Twins,” are probably the only 7 years-olds you know that have over 2 million people following them on social media. These adorable American twins rose to fame from their YouTube video “Twins Realize They Look the Same,” which went viral and made everyone fall in love with them.\n\nYou can join their tribe of over 1 million subscribers on Youtube, they upload adorable clips and weekly vlogs. The McClure Twins have become a mini powerhouse and have even been listed in the Forbes list of “Top 10 Kid Influencers.”\n\nAngela and Amber Cope\n\nThese are probably the coolest women on our list. The Cope sisters are the first set of twins to compete in the same NASCAR race. Talk about some tough competition. Who could possibly know your weaknesses more than your twin sister who grew up with you, trained with you, and oh yeah, shares your DNA??\n\nThe sisters were inspired by their uncle, Derrike Cope, an American professional stock car racing driver, and later, team owner. He's probably most famous for being the 1990 Daytona 500 winner.\n\nTasha and Sidra Smith\n\nMost people see this familiar face and think it's the same person but, in fact, Tasha Smith and Sidra Smith are two different people. These identical tweens both work in the entertainment industry. Sidra Smith works behind the scenes as a producer and director, and Tasha Smith, the actress, is the one who's usually in the limelight.\n\nTasha is most known for her role in Why Did I Get Married, and as Cookie’s (Tajari P. Henson’s) sister Carol on FOX’s hit series Empire. Her sister occasionally makes on-screen cameos and has even subbed for her sister once.\n\nCamille and Kennerly Kitt\n\nCamille and Kennerly Kitt, or more famously known as The Harp Twins, are identical twin sisters who are actresses and harpists. They have released six studio albums and more than 100 singles online. They have also had appearances in several films.\n\nThey have arranged contemporary songs for a range of big-time artists like The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Coldplay, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, AC/DC, Bon Jovi, and Aerosmith. Their YouTube account has more than half a million subscribers and over 95 million views. They play grand pedal harps and electric lever harps. The twins often dress in fantasy wear, like elf costumes.\n\nShane and Sia Barbi\n\nShane and Sia Barbi, more famously known as The Barbi Twins, are a set of identical twin sisters from California. They got their modeling start at the age of 7 when they modeled in a Sears catalog. They began modeling, doing both fashion and pin-up modeling. When a billboard of the twins went up on Sunset Boulevard in 1989, the girls were thrust into worldwide fame. The billboard immediately piqued Hugh Hefner’s interest. In 1991, the girls appeared on the cover of Playboy magazine. This would be the first of many covers the girls would be on, and it propelled them into a popular calendar modeling career.\n\nThe girls have done good things with their success. They wrote a book on health and fitness also meant to be a self-help book for people battling an eating disorder. The girls themselves struggled with bulimia for years, which led them to exercise for 10 hours a day, crash diet, and abuse laxatives. They released a second book in which they educated readers on how to be healthy and fit while staying eco-friendly and animal-friendly. They donated all the money the books made to animal charities. The twins are big animal activists and have posed in several campaigns for animal rights.\n\nElvis and Jesse Presley\n\nMost people have no idea that the King of Rock and Roll had an identical twin brother named Jesse. Unfortunately, Jesse was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before Elvis. Elvis never discussed his twin brother much, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t impact the singer.\n\nHe apparently was very disturbed by the fact that his brother didn’t survive their birth. His mother, Gladys, used to account for Elvis’ energy as being that of two people. Maybe Elvis got some of his love of music in place of mourning for his brother.\n\nJudy Reyes and Joselin Reyes\n\nJudy and Joselin Reyes are twins sisters who are both actors. Judy is most recognized for her role as nurse Carla Espinosa on 'Scrubs', which she played from 2001-2009. She has also had appearances in shows like 'Law & Order', 'The Sopranos', and 'NYPD Blue'.\n\nSince 2017, she has been playing Annalise “Quiet Ann” Zayas in the crime comedy-drama, 'Claws'. Joselin is best known for playing a paramedic in 'Law and Order'. She has also been in a few episodes of 'Scrubs' alongside her sister.\n\nShawn Ashmore and Aaron Ashmore\n\nIf you were a fan of 'Smallville' then you’d definitely know that these two are identical twins. The duo has acted together in several films as well as held roles apart from one another. Shawn starred in the 'X-Men' film series as Iceman.\n\nAlthough they are identical twins, they rock different hairstyles and facial hair and so, they are distinguishable. But, if they had the same hairstyle then it would be pretty difficult to tell who’s who, especially considering that they have the same tattoo on their wrists, which reads “GMA” (Good Man Ashmore), which their grandfather also bore.\n\nTegan and Sara Quin\n\nThe identical twin girls Tegan and Sara Quin are best known as being the musicians in Tegan and Sara, a Canadian indie-pop duo. They are both songwriters for the duo but they actually play several instruments. Together, they have released eight albums and they even got a Grammy nomination for their live album “Get Along.” The twins have been supportive of one another for a very long time. They started writing songs and playing music when they were just 15 years old. They formed their first band together, called Plunk.\n\nBefore they became known as Tegan and Sara, they were known as Sara and Tegan. However, this confused fans into thinking that their duo was actually one person named “Sara Antegan.” So the twins renamed themselves as Tegan and Sara to clear up the confusion. Sara and Tegan are both openly gay and big advocates in the LGBT community.\n\nSiva Kaneswaran and Kumar Kaneswaran\n\nSiva Kaneswaran is one-fifth of the British boy band “The Wanted.” He has an identical twin brother named Kumar. The two look so much alike that Kumar could take his place on the red carpet and nobody would know.\n\nThe two come from a big family in Dublin. They are two of seven siblings! While Siva is the model and more famous of the two, Kumar has still acted a bit. To date, he has been in two movies: 'Rock Rivals' and 'Uncle Max'.\n\nJon Heder and Dan Heder\n\nNot many people know that the actor who played Napoleon Dynamite, Jon Heder, has an identical twin brother. Can you imagine that? Two Napoleons! The brothers have a very close bond and even started a production company together.\n\nConsidering that these two look exactly alike, Jon could have gotten away with having his twin brother come to the set of Napoleon Dynamite and pretending to be him and nobody would know. Who doesn’t wish they had a twin so they could do things like that? Despite that Dan hasn’t gone the acting route like his brother, he still is involved in the production world and has worked as a visualization artist on several big films like the Captain America franchise and Spiderman.\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss\n\nThe Winklevoss twins, or sometimes called Winklevi, are popular people in the tech world. Cameron and Tyler filed a lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, for allegedly taking their idea. In the David Fincher film The Social Network, both twins were played by actor Armie Hammer.\n\nNowadays, the twins spend their energy on BitInstant, a bitcoin payment processor. Being multi-million dollar entrepreneurs would be more than enough, but apparently not for the brothers. They are also very successful rowers.\n\nJason London and Jeremy London\n\nIdentical twin brothers Jason and Jeremy London have both pursued careers as actors, although it doesn’t seem like their careers ever really took off. Jeremy had roles in 'Party of Five', '7th Heaven' and 'I’ll Fly Away'. Meanwhile, his brother is most recognized for his role in 'Dazed and Confused'.\n\nAlthough they’ve both had roles in big cult classics and their devilish good looks, they haven’t been much on the Hollywood front as of late. Perhaps it has something to do with their bad-boy image. In 2011, Jeremy was on Celebrity Rehab. His ex-wife, Melissa, was also in treatment herself.\n\nAlbert and Allen Hughes\n\nAlbert and Allen Hughes, or more commonly known as the Hughes brothers, are film directors and producers. They are known for creating twisted, violent films, like 'Dead Presidents', 'American Pimp', and 'The Book of Eli'. Allen Hughes also directed a film on his own, 'New York, I Love You'.\n\nThe Hughes brothers were born in Detroit. They had a supportive mother who gifted them with a video camera when they were twelve. The boys would spend their spare time as kids making videos together. During their senior year of high school, the brothers decided to drop out in order to pursue directing careers. They started by directing music videos for Tupac Shakur and Tone Loc. They later moved on to directing feature films. Since 2004 Albert has been living in the Czech Republic. He stated back in 2013 that he and his brother are in “a weird dance right now.” We hope that for the love of family, they’ve reconciled their differences!\n\nKiefer Sutherland and Rachel Sutherland\n\nKiefer Sutherland and his twin sister were born into a family of successful actors. In fact, Kiefer’s debut film was in Max Dugan Returns, a film in which his father also starred. Kiefer has experienced a very successful acting career, starring in shows like '24' and films like 'A Few Good Men' and 'A Time to Kill'. Thanks to a successful career, Kiefer has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Over the years, Sutherland has experienced several marriage fails and drunk driving charges.\n\nHis sister, meanwhile, hasn’t tried her hand at acting. She has instead preferred to stay behind the camera, working as a post-production supervisor. When you’re born into a family of successful actors, it isn’t difficult to get into the show business and pursue a career, even if it isn’t a role in front of the camera.\n\nJames Phelps and Oliver Phelps\n\nJames and Oliver are identical twin brothers who are best known for playing twin brothers, Fred and George Weasley in 'Harry Potter'. Although the role wasn’t so big, the popularity of 'Harry Potter' garnered them a lot of love and attention. Considering the fact that the boys had no prior acting experience, it’s pretty impressive that they ended up getting cast in the role and appearing in the entire 'Harry Potter' film franchise.\n\nBecause the boys and many of the other actors were so young during the filming of HP, they were tutored on set during the filming so that they could keep up with school. Nowadays, James and Oliver split their time between Santa Monica, California, and their home in the UK. When they aren’t acting as wizards, they enjoy golfing and traveling around the world to attend different sporting events.\n\nBrittany Daniel and Cynthia Daniel\n\nBrittany and Cynthia Daniel played Liz and Jessica Wakefield in the television series, 'Sweet Valley High'. How easy must it have been for the girls to play a pair of twin sisters especially when off the screen they share a very close bond. “Nothing is better when another person really knows you on a soul level,” the pair recently wrote on Instagram.\n\nThe twins were born in Gainesville, Florida, and began their careers as models at the young age of 11. It should come as no surprise that they have played the Doublemint Twins in Doublemint gum. They were also in Seventeen and YM.\n\nKyle and Lane Carlson\n\nThe identical Carlson twins, Kyle and Lane, are twin male fashion models. I mean if you can take advantage of the fact that you have a 12 pack between you, then why not? The twins were born in Stillwater, Minnesota, with Lane coming out into the world six minutes earlier. The boys were scouted in 2000 at a mall and were signed with Elite Model Management. They quickly became famous models throughout the world.\n\nThey posed with Armani and Abercrombie and Fitch. Some of their photoshoots made them gay icons, despite that both boys are straight. Kyle Carlson has been married to a fellow model, Jessica Hall, since 2008. Lane was also a contestant on NBC’s Fear Factor and even made it to the final round. The twins also had an appearance together on the comedy program, Mobile Home Disaster. Kyle later became a regular guest on Deserving Design on HGTV.\n\nDiane and Elaine Klimaszewski\n\nDiane and Elaine Klimaszewski are actresses and models best known for being the Coors Light Twins. They made their first television appearance long ago in 1987, on Star Search. After that, they were on T.V as models for 'Let’s Make a Deal'. In 1999, the girls were signed with the World Wrestling Federation as Lolli and Pop. One year later their names were changed to Gold and Silver and they became members of the Nitro Girls dance group, a dance team in the WWF.\n\nThey signed with the WWF later that year. In 2018, they ended their run with the WWF. The girls are most recognized for their Coors Light advertisements. “Love Songs”, their ad campaign, were the highest scoring spots in Coors history. There was a parody of the girls in a segment on SNL, played by Rachel Dratch and Jennifer Garner.\n\nNicholas Brendon and Kelly Donovan\n\nNicolas Brendon is an actor who is best known for his role in 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'. Thanks to having an identical twin brother, Kelly Donovan, his brother was able to stand in for him as needed throughout the show. Donovan has also pursued acting and in 1997, he got his big break in the movie 'City Guys'.\n\nNicholas was born three minutes after Kelly. They seem like they are very close brothers. He has said that having a stutter is what led him to pursue a career as an actor in order to get over the stutter. In recent years, Nicolas has gotten in trouble with the police due to alcohol and assault issues.\n\nLiz Sagal and Jean Sagal\n\nLiza and Jean Sagal are twin actors from Los Angeles. They were born to Boris Sagal, a director, and Sarah Zwilling, a singer, producer, and writer. The two appeared together in the television series 'Double Trouble' from 1984 to 1985. Liz appeared in 'Grease 2', 'Flashdance', and 'Double Trouble'. In more recent years, the twins have gone their separate ways, but both have stayed within the realm of Hollywood. Liz has worked as a writer on shows like 'Charmed'. Jean, meanwhile, has been working as a director.\n\nShe has worked on shows like 'Two and a Half Men', 'So Little Time', and '2 Broke Girls'. Who knows, maybe one day the twins will join forces and work on a T.V show or film together, with Liz writing and Jean directing. The twins aren’t the only actor siblings in the family. Their more famous sister, Katey Sagal, is most known for playing Peg Bundy on 'Married With Children'. She has also played roles on 'Futurama', '8 Simple Rules', and Gemma on 'Sons of Anarchy'.\n\nLinda and Terry Jamison\n\nA lot of cultures believe that twins hold a special power. Linda and Terry Jamison have used theirs to their career advantage. The identical twins live in Los Angeles and work as psychics. You can call them celebrity psychics. They claim to be able to awaken the spirits of dead celebrities. They have been featured in several tabloids.\n\nThey also ascertain that back in 1999, they predicted that the September 11th terror attacks would happen on the World Trade Center. However, transcripts show otherwise. They show the twins saying, “We are seeing terrorist attacks on…the New York Trade Center, the World Trade Center in 2002.” Because an attack had already been carried out on the World Trade Center in 1993, their predictions didn’t hold much value.\n\nMilly and Becky Rosso\n\nCamilla or “Milly Rosso” and her twin sister, Rebecca “Becky” Rosso are actresses and singers from London. The now 24-year-olds had their claim to fame when they appeared on 'The Suite Life of Zack & Cody' alongside the stars of the show, twin boys Cole and Dylan Sprouse. A producer discovered them during a live taping of 'The Suite Life' and they were chosen to appear in some episodes of The Suite Life.\n\nIn 2009, they starred in the movie 'Legally Blondes', the sequel to 'Legally Blonde' which was produced by Reese Witherspoon. They also formed a band together called The Rosso Sisters along with their sisters Georgina and Lola. However, in 2015, the group decided to disband after the death of their mother.\n\nLinda Hamilton and Leslie Hamilton\n\nLinda and her identical twin sister Leslie were born in Maryland. They have an older sister and younger brother as well. Linda has pursued a career as an actor and is most known for her roles as Sarah Connor in 'The Terminator' and as Catherine Chandler in 'Beauty and the Beast'.\n\nHer sister Leslie works as a nurse. But, in three scenes in 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day', she plays her sister’s double. When she appears, she plays the “Sarah” that is farthest away from the camera view, while Linda plays the Sarah who is in focus.\n\nRandy and Jason Sklar\n\nWell, it’s not every day that you see this; identical twin comedian brothers! Identical twins, Randy and Jason Sklar, were born in St. Louis. They studied together at the University of Michigan and decided that a career in comedy was calling to them. After graduating, they moved out to the big apple to make their dreams a reality. They started writing for the MTV show 'Apt 2f'. The boys have a very impressive resume, appearing in shows like CSI, Law & Order, Entourage, Grey’s Anatomy, and Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nThe Sklar brothers hosted the show 'Cheap Seats' on ESPN for 4 seasons. In the show, the brothers act as librarians who poke fun at different sporting events. The format of the show was taken from 'Mystery Science Theater 3000'. Later on in their career, the brothers co-wrote the Nick Kroll web series 'Layers' and wrote the web series 'Held up'. They also hosted the show 'United States of America' on the History Channel. In 2010, they started to host their own podcast every week called 'Sklarbro Country'. Well, these two seem to have a lot of success as a team.\n\nBarbara Bush and Jenna Bush\n\nThe only President to have twins, former U.S. President George W. Bush and the former First Lady Laura Bush are parents to fraternal twins, Barbara Bush and Jenna Bush, although their resemblance isn’t so transparent. Both girls seem to have taken advantage of their father being president.\n\nJenna Bush has become an author, an editor for Southern Living magazine, and a news anchor for NBC. She is set to take over Kathie Lee Gifford on 'The Today Show' as a co-host. Her sister, on the other hand, is a graduate of Yale and now works as an activist. She is the founder of Global Health Corps. Surprisingly, both girls aren’t members of the Republican party. They prefer to be independent, which is actually pretty respectable.\n\nMalika Haqq and Khadijah Haqq\n\nYou can find these twin girls hanging out with another set of more famous siblings, the Kardashians. The two girls have been Khloe’s BFFs since they were 15 and they’ve been part of 'Keeping up with the Kardashians' since season 2. Malika is also an actress who was in 'The Bernie Mac Show' and 'Sky High'. Khadijah was an extra in a T.V. show in 1991.\n\nThe two girls had their own reality show in 2015, called 'Dash Dolls'. Despite it running for only one season, it just shows that these girls mean business. Since 2010, Khadijah has been married to Bobby McCray, a former Saints defensive end. Her sister Malika, on the other hand, is single and probably ready to mingle.\n\nDidem and Sinem Balık\n\nDidem and Sinem Balik, or more famously known as The Balik Sisters, or the Opera twins, are an identical twin opera act. They were born in Turkey, with Didem born 5 minutes before Sinem. They started to study music when they were very young, only four years old! As they couldn’t yet read or write, their music teacher taught them by using colors.\n\nThey perform throughout the world and in front of many VIP guests like presidents, princes, and princesses, and at many international festivals. In their performances, they typically wear traditional Turkish garb. Besides opera, they also perform Broadway musicals, Italian Neapolitans, and operettas. The twins currently reside in Vienna, Austria.\n\nLee and Lyn Wilde\n\nThese twin entertainers have been around for quite some time. Lee and Lyn Wilde were popular during the 1940s when they appeared in several films as themselves, the Wilde twins. They were born in Illinois in 1922. They first began singing with their siblings in church. By the time they reached their teenage years, they were singing for the local radio station and performing in Illinois and Kentucky.\n\nBy the time they were 20, they were band singers. They then began to be featured in films and were in such films like Judy Garland’s 'Presenting Lily Mars' and 'Twice Blessed'. They didn’t stay in show business very long; by the 1950’s they both decided to retire. Lee proceeded to get her pilot’s license, an associate's degree, and a bachelor’s degree. It seems like the twins couldn’t leave each other’s side, as they also married brothers! They even died quite close to one another, with Lee passing at age 92 and Lyn at age 93.\n\nBryan Kirkwood and Denny Kirkwood\n\nBryan and Denny Kirkwood are twin actors from Washington. Denny’s first big role was opposite Drew Barrymore in 'Never Been Kissed'. Both brothers have appeared in several TV shows like 'The Nanny', 'Lois and Clark', 'Weird Science', 'One World', and 'The Dead Zone'.\n\nIt’s no surprise that these two good looking boys have made their way to Hollywood. We are sure that their ripped bodies have something to do with it as well. Do you think they showed off their abs in their acting portfolios? I mean, we would… especially if we had a double.\n\nKelley and Kim Deal\n\nKelley and Kim Deal are musicians and identical twin sisters. In 1989 they formed the band The Breeders, with Kim on guitar and the lead vocalist, and Kelley as the lead guitarist. The Breeders wasn’t Kim’s first experience in a band. In 1986 she joined The Pixies as a bassist. In 1994, Kelley entered rehab for drug addiction and The Breeders were put on pause. In 2018, an article was published by the New York Times stating that Kelley was sober for eight years.\n\nWhile her sister was busy making music with The Pixies, Kelley was working on other projects. She started the Kelley Deal 6000 and joined The Last Hard Men. In more recent years, Kelley has gotten into knitting and has even been on the DIY Network show 'Knitty Gritty'. She released a book of handbag patterns called 'Bags that Rock: Knitting on the Road with Kelley Deal'. The Breeders are still making music and in 2018 they released their fifth album, 'All Nerve'. These two sisters aren’t the only twin musicians!\n\nKristina and Karissa Shannon\n\nKristina and Karissa Shannon are twins sisters, but they also share another unique trait in common; they are both pornographic actresses and Playboy Playmates. They moved in with Hugh Hefner in 2008 as his girlfriends and began to appear on the E! Reality T.V show 'Girls Next Door'. The girls have said that although they were Hef’s girlfriends, they had a platonic relationship with him.\n\nThe girls have gone on to appear in several films. Apparently, Kristina was dating a Playmate named Ida Ljungqvist, who she met at the mansion while living with Hefner. The two of them were charged in 2008 with aggravated battery after they got into a fight with a few people at a house party. They pled no contest and were put on probation. In January 2016, Kristina once again got into trouble with the police after she was caught driving drunk to get a nipple piercing. In 2017, the two sisters were arrested; Karissa for felony domestic violence and Kristina for misdemeanor violence after she punched Karissa in the face and Karissa threw a security monitor at her sister.\n\nDylan Sprouse and Cole Sprouse\n\nDylan and Cole Sprouse had their claim to fame on the Disney TV show, 'The Suite Life With Zack & Cody'. But, you might not know that these same boys played Adam Sandler’s adorable son in “Big Daddy.” After their three-year run on 'The Suite Life', they acted in their spin-off, 'The Suite Life on Deck', for another three-year run.\n\nThe child actors are no longer those little awkward pre-teens. Following the 'Suite Life on Deck', Dylan chose to leave the acting world behind and pursue a degree in video game design at NYU. He then decided to open up a wine meadery in Brooklyn. His brother, Cole, meanwhile has catapulted into popularity. He is currently playing the role of Jughead Jones in CW’s 'Riverdale'. He is also a photographer and has shot pictures for big magazines like Teen Vogue and W Magazine. Wow, we are feeling very old seeing how much they’ve grown up.\n\nLindsay and Sidney Greenbush\n\nAlthough they are practically unrecognizable these days, the now 46-year-old identical twins were once very popular on TV during the 1970s. They are famous for playing Carrie Ingalls together on 'Little House on the Prairie'. Most people wouldn’t even know that Carrie was played by a set of twins, because in the opening credits, it says Lindsay Sidney Greenbush.\n\nBefore sharing the role of Carrie Ingalls, the girls starred in a television drama, 'Sunshine'. After 'Little House on the Prairie', they shot commercials for Doublemint Gum, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Mattel Toys. They decided to retire from acting so that they could focus on school and have a childhood. They come from a show biz family so it isn’t surprising that they got into acting from such a young age. Their brother Clay and father Billy “Green” Bush have also appeared in several films and shows.\n\nStephen and Timothy Quay\n\nThe 71-year-old identical twin brothers, Stephen and Timothy Quay have greatly influenced the world of animation as stop-motion animators. Better known simply as the Brothers Quay or Quay Brothers, they have made some very powerful films together. They like to create animation with doll parts in dark atmospheres.\n\nThey created their most popular work in 1986, called 'Street of Crocodiles'. Terry Gilliam, a director and animator, chose the film as one of the best animated movies of all time. A lot of people who aren’t in the film world do not know the Quay Brothers’ animation. They might, however, recognize some of the work that the Quay Brothers do for bigger movies, like the film 'Frida'.\n\nMary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen\n\nThe twins you’ve been waiting for and knew were coming. The Olsen twins are some of the most famous twins in the history of Hollywood. They got their start as actors before they could even walk. The two started in 'Full house' when they were just little babies. They played the role of the baby of the family, Michelle, together. That role catapulted the two into mega fame and success. The Dualstar Entertainment Group was formed to produce movies and Olsen twin products. The girls took over the group in 2004 and their net worth went up to $137 million.\n\nThey have since retired from acting and pursued a career in fashion instead, starting their own fashion line named after their older siblings, Elizabeth and James and The Row. A lot of fans had their fingers crossed that the twins would join the original cast of 'Full House' for its sequel show, 'Fuller House' in 2016. However, the two don’t want to act again and they are very invested in their fashion business. Nowadays, Mary-Kate resides in New York with her husband, Olivier Sarkozy, the half brother of Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nCharlotte Ronson and Samantha Ronson\n\nA lot of sets of twins, even if pursuing different passions, share many things in common. Charlotte Ronson and Samantha Ronson are twin girls who were born in London to a writer and socialite mother and real estate father. Charlotte is a fashion designer, while her twin sister Samantha is a DJ. These two creative and artsy sisters are both successful in their own ways. Samantha is also known for having dated Lindsay Lohan back in 2007.\n\nThe twins aren’t the only Ronson children to be successful. Their brother, Mark, has experienced major success in recent years with his hit Uptown Funk, which he collaborated on with Bruno Mars. Ronson has had other big collaborations with artists like Lady Gaga, Amy Winehouse, Adele and Miley Cyrus. He is the winner of seven Grammy Awards and an Academy Award.\n\nJosé Canseco and Ozzie Canseco\n\nCuban-born Jose and Ozzie are identical twin brothers who are former MLB players. The brothers had a huge impact on the sport of baseball and made MLB history several times. After retiring, Jose got into boxing and mixed martial arts. Ozzie would often fill in for his brother in book signings. Can you imagine really not wanting to do something and having a sibling who could fill in your spot for you?\n\nWell, they took it a little far in 2011 when Jose had Ozzie pretend to be him at a celebrity boxing match. Nice try, guys. They also have a history of getting into trouble with the cops and have been arrested countless times. And for all those who were envious of their strength and talent, well, it wasn’t only thanks to hard work and practice. The two have sadly admitted to using steroids.\n\nEthan and Grayson Dolan\n\nEthan and Grayson Dolan are social media influencers who rose to fame as teen comedians on the video-sharing platform, Vine. They started their Vine in 2013. The twins gained over 6.4 million Vine followers. In 2015, they were signed to Awesomeness T.V. Nowadays, they share their lives on YouTube and have nearly 10 million subscribers on YouTube.\n\nIn 2016, they were awarded with a Teen Choice Award for Choice Web Star: Male and Choice YouTuber. They continue to make videos on YouTube to this day and attract female fans thanks to their good looks and sense of humor.\n\nLaverne Cox and M Lamar\n\nLaverne Cox and M Lamar are identical twins who were raised by their single mother in Alabama. They are both successful entertainers, however, they have taken different paths to achieve success. Laverne Cox is most recognized for playing a transgender inmate in the hit Netflix show, 'Orange Is the New Black'. M Lamar played Sophia pre-transition. When Laverne was 11 years old, she attempted to take her own life out of feelings of depression and isolation, feeling different and uncomfortable with the male parts she received at birth. She ended up overcoming it and pursuing a fine arts degree at the University of Alabama.\n\nHer brother’s success doesn’t only stem from Laverne’s. He is a composer and performer who lives in New York City. The New York Times has called his work “a bracing alternative to the dispiriting traffic in blandly competent art clogging the New York gallery system.” He studied painting at San Francisco Art Institute, started to study sculpture at Yale, but dropped out to focus on his music career, a decision that seemed to pay off.\n\nGiovanni Ribisi and Marissa Ribisi\n\nBoth of the Ribisi twins were raised on the foundation of Scientology. Likewise, they have both pursued successful acting careers. Unsurprisingly, they come from a family of artists which explains how they both ended up in their careers. Their father, Albert Anthony Ribisi, an Italian-America, toured with the band People! as the keyboard player. Their mother, Gay, similarly, manages actors and writers. Their sister Gina also works as a voice actress.\n\nGiovanni began acting on television as a young child and in movies as a teenager. Marissa first appeared on television a bit after her brother, at the age of 14. She starred in the iconic Dazed and Confused in 1993. She has also had roles in films like The Brady Bunch Movie, Felicity, and Friends. The twins also have something else in common; their marital status. They are divorced, with Giovanni divorced twice and Marissa, once divorced from her first husband.\n\nAshton Kutcher and Michael Kutcher\n\nNot many people know that the That 70’s Show actor and entrepreneur has a fraternal twin brother named Michael. The 41-year-old twins were born in Iowa in 1978. Despite that they are twins, they are about as different as twins can get. Michael was born with cerebral palsy and had a heart transplant when the two were younger. He lives in Iowa with his son. However, it seems like Ashton Kutcher’s poise and confidence did rub off on his other half, as Michael can be found giving motivational speeches on his disorder for the organization Reaching for the Stars.\n\nAlthough Ashton rarely talks about his brother, he has shared that his childhood was stressful due to his brother’s health problems. He would avoid coming home at night sometimes so he wouldn’t have to hear bad news. The Punk’d star hardly ever brings up anything about his brother but on the rare occasion he has talked about Michael’s fight with cerebral palsy, he had to fight back tears. Although Ashton is living the life of fame and glam in Los Angeles, he clearly holds a special place for his brother in his heart.\n\nGisele Bündchen and Patricia Bündchen\n\nMany are surprised to learn that this beauty has a fraternal twin sister named Patricia. Actually, the two come from a large family of six girls and we imagine that they're all pretty beautiful as well. They were born in Brazil in 1980. Although Gisele is one of the most famous supermodels in the world, it doesn’t look like her fame has affected the relationship between her and her twin sister. The two seem very close, and Gisele appears at many fashion events accompanied by her, which in our opinion is the best accessory a girl can have. Actually, Patricia manages a lot of Gisele’s modeling career. It makes sense that Patricia prefers to work behind the scenes.\n\nShe opened up to Vanity Fair that she’s the shy one of the two and Gisele is more outgoing. A lot of fraternal twins bare a similar resemblance to one another but it would be hard to know that they were twins unless they told you. If Gisele were to introduce you to Patricia as her twin sister, you would look at the two and think “oh, obviously they’re twins.” But, you might not have known it otherwise. You would maybe just think that it’s two gorgeous models standing side by side.\n\nJill Hennessy and Jacqueline Hennessy\n\nIf you think that these pair of sisters look exactly alike, it’s because they are identical twin sisters! The Hennessy sisters were born on November 25, 1968, in Alberta, Canada. The sisters may have made their acting debut together in Dead Ringers in 1988, but they’ve since gone on to pursue slightly different career paths, although similar nonetheless. Jill has pursued a career in acting. She has appeared in titles like Law and Order, RoboCop 3, and Chutney Popcorn. Her sis, Jacqueline, has taken a slightly different approach to being in the public eye and works as both a journalist and a T.V. host.\n\nIt’s not surprising that both girls ended up in roles like this, considering that they’re gorgeous. And can we just stop and give them credit for a moment for how young they look?! They really don’t look fifty. With Jill living in Minneapolis and Jacqueline in Canada, it must be hard for them to be so far apart from each other.\n\nRobin and Maurice Gibb\n\nThe Bee Gees are one of the best-selling bands of all time. The pop-rock trio was made up of three brothers: Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb, who banded together in 1958. They rose to popularity in the sixties and experienced widespread success for four decades, releasing their last studio album in 2001. Robin and Maurice Gibb were fraternal twins, Maurice was the older one of the two. Both boys have since passed away, with Robin passing at the age of 62 and Maurice at age 53.\n\nThe twins were well versed in a variety of instruments. Robin played the piano, the organ, and acoustic guitar. His twin, Maurice, played the bass and acoustic guitar, harmonica, organ, keyboard, and drums. The brothers referred to Maurice as “the most technologically savvy member.”\n\nBlake Tuomy-Wilhoit and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit\n\nBlake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit are best known for their roles as Jesse and Becky’s twin boys, Nicky and Alex, on 'Full House' and now 'Fuller House'. The boys were born in Los Angeles, California and started acting as young babies. After 'Full House' came to an end, the boys went their separate ways with their careers.\n\nDylan continued in the world of Hollywood, but not as an actor. He chose to pursue a career in sound work for films and video games. He was nominated for an Emmy award for his work on 'Game of Thrones'. Blake left Hollywood altogether and pursued a career as a firefighter.\n\nAaron Carter and Angel Carter\n\nAaron Carter was most famous for being the brother of the former Backstreet Boys member, Nick Carter. What many don't know, is that he also had a twin sister, Angel Carter. But Aaron definitely held his own. At just the age of 9, he released his first album which sold a million copies worldwide. His next album, at age 12, sold three million copies. Lucky for him, he was able to tour with the Backstreet Boys, which probably did a number on his success and popularity.\n\nHis twin Angel, meanwhile, hasn’t pursued a similar career as her brothers but instead has chosen to focus on modeling. Celebrities in Hollywood often come from entertainment families because they grew up surrounded by it and have an easy in into the industry.\n\nCharles Carver and Max Carver\n\nCharles Carver is an actor most known for starring in 'Teen Wolf'. His brother, Max, frequently played his twin in the show, although he appeared in fewer episodes than him. In 2007, Charlie came out as gay. “As a young boy, I knew I wanted to be an actor”, wrote Charlie. “It was around that age that I also knew, however abstractly, that I was different from some of the other boys in my grade.”\n\nThe Carver twins have had a successful career. Other than acting in 'Teen Wolf', they also acted as twin characters Porter and Preston Scavo on the T.V. series, 'Desperate Housewives'.\n\nBenji Madden and Joel Madden\n\nTwo of the five members of Good Charlotte are identical twins. The two tattooed artists, Benji and Joel were born in Maryland. They formed the band Good Charlotte with a few other musicians in 1996. The twins not only started a successful band together, but thanks to their successful rock band, they have also dated some of Hollywood’s hottest stars, including Hilary Duff and Paris Hilton.\n\nThey have since settled down and Benji Madden is married to Cameron Diaz and Joel Madden to Nicole Richie. Although Good Charlotte no longer seems to be producing albums or touring, their legacy definitely lives on and has become a part of pop culture.\n\nGary and Larry Lane\n\nThe identical Lane twins have pursued a career as actors, models, and producers. When life gives you good looks and an identical twin brother, you take advantage. Well, that’s what Larry and Gary chose to do. The brothers have made appearances on shows like 'Dawson’s Creek' and in movies like 'Zoolander'. The twins are most known for a documentary they wrote and starred in, called 'Hollywood to Dollywood'.\n\nThe documentary follows them trying to hand-deliver a screenplay they wrote called Full Circle to the iconic country queen, Dolly Parton. They wanted her to play a role in the film, which was created with Dolly in mind. In the documentary, they also express their concern of how their hometown will react to them being gay and how much they wish for their religious Baptist mom to accept them. Their film took home 24 awards at film festivals.\n\nTia Mowry & Tamera Mowry\n\nThe identical twin sisters, Tia and Tamera got their claim to fame on the sitcom Sister, Sister at the age of 16. If you were a child of the ’90s, then there’s a good chance you were a fan of the show. The show aired for five years. After the show ended, the sisters decided to pursue a more typical path and left acting to study psychology at Pepperdine University. But, they didn’t leave for too long.\n\nSince 2015, Mowry has starred in her own show on the Cooking Channel called Tia Mowry at Home. Her sister, meanwhile, has been the host of the talk show, The Real since 2013. Their lives were majorly impacted on November 7, 2018, when their niece Alaina Housley was killed in the Borderline bar shooting in Thousand Oaks, California. Tia shared on twitter “Our sweet Alaina Housley is gone. We love you. We are devastated.”\n\nTiki Barber and Ronde Barber\n\nSports run in family genes, like Peyton and Eli Manning. But, it’s not every day that we see twin athletes playing the same sport, especially identical ones! Tiki Barber and Ronde Barber both had very successful careers playing football. Tiki Barber played for the New York Giants on offense for 10 seasons and Ronde played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on defense for 16 years. They even met on the field several times, playing opposite one another. They have both retired and pursued careers in TV.\n\nIn 2007, Tiki was hired on 'The Today Show' as a correspondent and on Sunday Night Football. However, off the field and T.V., the twins have committed some less respectable acts. Tiki cheated on his wife with a young intern in his agent’s office, and one who had babysat his sons. He and his wife divorced after an 11-year marriage and he married the intern 11 days later. His brother, meanwhile, seems to have stayed loyal to his wife of nearly 20 years.\n\nCameron and Chimene Diaz\n\nAlthough they aren’t actually twins, Cameron and Chimene Diaz look so similar that they may as well be twins! You probably know that Cameron Diaz was a very successful actress before retiring in 2018. Her older sister has followed a different path in life and chooses to stay out of the public eye. Despite their different callings in life, it’s evident that the two sisters are very close.\n\nChimene is married to musician Robby Armstrong and they have four children. Judging on Cameron’s characters in movies (and let’s be honest, we feel like we know her personally), she is probably the coolest aunt, especially considering that she doesn’t have children of her own.\n\nVin Diesel and Paul Diesel\n\nVin Diesel, born Mark Sinclair, has a twin brother named Paul. The two were born in California and were raised by their astrologer mother. They never met their biological father. They also lived with their stepfather, who was a theater manager and acting teacher. Diesel began acting as a child, most likely not expecting that he would go on to become one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood after starring in the 'Fast and the Furious' franchise.\n\nLike many other celebrity actors with twins, Vin’s brother has chosen a different career path, but not so different from his brother’s. He also works in Hollywood as a film editor. The two seem to have a close and loving relationship when they are captured together in public. We are sure that Paul’s skills as a producer help Vin with his acting skills.\n\nDeidre Hall and Andrea Hall\n\nDiedre Hall is best known for playing Dr. Marlena Evans on 'Days of Our Lives'. She played the role from 1977 to 1982 and then from 2000-2001. Diedre has a twin sister named Andrea. The sisters were born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, along with their three siblings.\n\nIn 2014, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to television. Andrea is also a soap actress and played the role of Samantha Evans’ envious twin Marlena on 'Days'. She played the role from 1977-1982.\n\nOlly Murs and Ben Murs\n\nThe 34-year-old British singer, Olly Murs, has a twin brother named Ben. He first rose to fame when he came in second place on the X factor in the sixth season. Olly shared on The Jonathan Ross Show that he and his brother weren’t in contact for a long time and that he didn’t make it to Ben’s wedding because of a conflict in the X Factor schedule.\n\nApparently, the entire family was once in a big feud and not on speaking terms. “He made the decision not to speak to the family,” said Olly when asked about his brother. Ben was so adamant about not having contact with his family that he changed his last name. In 2018, Olly shared that he was hopeful that he’d see his brother again.\n\nAlanis Morissette and Wade Imre Morissette\n\nThe Canadian-born singer Alanis Morissette has a twin brother named Wade, who is also into music. While his sister has released several albums, that have sold over 75 million copies, Wade has been teaching yoga and performing his own music. His music is a combination of indie rock and pop music with some Sanskrit and English chants.\n\nAlthough his music style is quite different than Alanis’s, in recent years, Alanis has calmed down her music and is more in tune with her brother’s style. In March 2018, Morissette revealed that she had written 23 new songs. Who knows, maybe the stars will align and the sibling duo will create music together.\n\nParker Posey and Christopher Posey\n\nThe Indies Queen, Parker Posey has a fraternal twin brother named Chris.

She’s also had appearances on popular TV shows like 'Will and Grace' and 'Parks and Recreation'.\n\nMeanwhile, her brother Chris has been getting up to anything but acting. He works as an attorney. Parker has stated in the past that she isn’t cut out to be a lawyer. In an interview she gave in January 2012 with The Daily Beast, she said “But I’m from the South and there are some powerful women down there, and very theatrical.”\n\nPaul Vogt and Peter Allen Vogt\n\nPaul Vogt is a comedian and actor who has been on MADtv and 'The Big Gay Sketch Show'. His identical twin brother Peter Allen Vogt is also an actor who has had roles in 'Princess Diaries 2', 'Arrested Development', 'Hannah Montana and Valentine’s Day'.\n\nIn 2013, Paul received some startling news that he had non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Luckily, he has survived the disease and as of 2015, he is now in recovery.\n\nConrad Bain and Bonar Bain\n\nCanadian-born Conrad Bain was an actor and comedian. He starred in sitcoms like 'Diff’rent Strokes' and 'Maude'. He died at 89-years-old in 2013. His daughter, Jennifer shared about her father, “He was an amazing person. He was a lot like Mr. Drummond, but much more interesting in real life. He was an amazing father.”\n\nConrad had a brother named Bonar Bain, who died in 2005. Bonar once played Dr. Arthur Harmon’s twin, Arthur Harmon.

Athleticism usually runs in the family and these two twin girls grew up in a family of hockey players. It seems like they decided to fully embrace this family love affair and go all in. Well, they have been very successful since doing so. The two had their claim to fame in 2018 during the Winter Olympics.\n\nMonique scored the goal which tied the game and Jocelyne scored the last shootout goal, winning the gold medal for her team. They made the news a second time in 2018 when they announced that they were both pregnant at the same time. Can you get closer than that? \"Like everything in life, we’re doing it together,” Jocelyne said.\n\nScarlett Johansson and Hunter Johansson\n\nShe’s consistently ranked as one of Hollywood’s sexiest actresses; the beloved Scarlett Johansson. And this woman is no dumb blonde. She’s fierce, she’s talented, and she’s got brains. And do you know what else she’s got? A twin brother named Hunter Johansson! We can see that good looks run in the Johansson family, as her brother is pretty cute himself. The twins have been photographed together on several occasions and he often accompanies his sister to red carpet events.\n\nIt seems like they have a pretty close bond. Hunter, while he doesn’t act, also leads a successful career, but in public policy. In 2008, he worked on Obama’s 2008 campaign as well as on his reelection. His sister, on the other hand, has become the world’s highest-paid actress, thanks to roles in The Avengers and Captain America films.\n\nRami Malek and Sami Malek\n\nRami Malek shot to fame after he played Freddie Mercury in 'Bohemian Rhapsody', for which he won an Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and British Academy Film Award for best actor.
