From soundtrack to setting, every detail feels real, as if the Cuestas have known these characters all their lives.\"\n\n-Elizabeth Weitzman, NY Daily News\n\n\"**** Roadie soars. A fresh alternative to typical indie-cinema wallowing.\"\n\n-Joshua Rothkopf, Time Out NY\n\n\"Ron Eldard is top-notch. Soulfully directed by Michael Cuesta, âRoadieâ is a perfectly attuned character study of this rock relic.\"\n\n-Kyle Smith, NY Post\n\n\"Gritty, honest and uncategorizable--a showcase for the outsized acting talents of Ron Eldard, Bobby Cannavale and Jill Hennessy. Eldard gives a valiant performance and Hennessy, who seems to get better with each film, seems the perfect embodiment of the beauty who never left the neighborhood, and should have.â \"\n\n-John Anderson, Variety\n\n\"ROADIE IS WORTH THE TRIP thanks to knockout turns by Ron Eldard and Bobby Cannevale, two of our finest actors at work. Eldard is magnetic and heartbreaking.\"\n\n-Erica Abeel, Huffington Post\n\n\"QUIETLY POWERFUL. Director Michael Cuesta beautifully evokes Forest Hills (Queens), balancing neighborhood bluster with nostalgia and tough love.\"\n\n-Joshua Rothkopf, Time Out New York"
