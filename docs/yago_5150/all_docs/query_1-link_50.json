        "text": "Cardi B, Gunna, Jill Scott, Victoria Monét and Earth, Wind & Fire are the headlining slate helping ONE Musicfest (OMF) ring in its 15th anniversary. This year’s two-day celebration, presented by Procter & Gamble in collaboration with Live Nation Urban, will take place Oct. 26-27 at Piedmont Park in Atlanta.\n\nAmong the additional R&B acts performing will be Dru Hill, Fantasia, Keyshia Cole, Jeremih, Ari Lennox, Leon Thomas, Monica and Fridayy. Other performers representing hip-hop include Sexyy Red, Glorilla, Nelly, BigXthaPlug, Young Nudy, Bossman Dlow, T.I., Method Man and Redman. Also rounding out the bill: gospel star Koryn Hawthorne plus country artist and newly-signed LVRN Records artist Tanner Adell. The latter will be making her first Black festival appearance. Performing their own sets as well will be DJ Mustard, DJ Drama and longtime Usher associate DJ Mars.\n\n“It’s hard to believe we’ve reached the 15-year mark,” said ONE Musicfest founder J Carter in a press statement. “We’ve grown into the longest-running and largest Black independently owned festival in the country and this journey has been a blessing. Our commitment to the community remains steadfast as we continue to bring the biggest and brightest performers in music and the best activations with amazing partners.”\n\nNicknamed “the greatest homecoming on earth,” OMF has welcomed an array of artists over the years from Kendrick Lamar, Usher and SZA to Brent Faiyaz, Ms. Lauryn Hill and Megan Thee Stallion. Additional festival highlights have included the reunion between the late Gangsta Boo and Three 6 Mafia, OutKast’s Big Boi and André 3000 joining The Dungeon Family onstage and Nas celebrating the 25th anniversary of debut album Illmatic."
