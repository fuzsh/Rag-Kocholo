As we honor the women in our lives who nurture us with love and care, take a moment to ask them a question: ‚ÄúAre you taking good care of your heart?‚Äù Educating ourselves and our loved ones is so important‚Äîjust ask Stephanie Guevara, whose daughter Melissa died of a heart attack at age 35. https://lnkd.in/eMAprRpc Simply put, many of us just don‚Äôt know that the signs of a heart attack in women can be different from those in men. This lack of awareness, combined with a gap in knowledge among some healthcare providers, can lead to missed or delayed diagnosis. To raise awareness about this crisis, Women's Heart Alliance launched a public health campaign to raise awareness about misdiagnosis. We encourage you to watch the PSA and download a card to your phone that lists the unique symptoms of heart attacks in women and questions to ask your doctor if you feel you‚Äôre not being seen or heard. Share this information with the women you love‚Äîbe a force for change in ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment. https://lnkd.in/evnAu_hM Click here for more information on misdiagnosis and how you can make a difference. https://lnkd.in/ef_B8w-i This Mother‚Äôs Day, let's not only celebrate the women who mean so much to us but also empower them to advocate for themselves and #GetHeartChecked. #happymothersday2024 #hearthealth #heartdisease #women\n\nDid you know? 1. Compared to women, men are more likely to be overweight 2. Men are twice as likely to have hearing loss 3. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in men 4. Men under 55 are more prone to hypertension than women 5. Men have a 1 in 2 chance of developing cancer during their lifetime 6. Men are more likely to develop mouth cancer Source: St. Luke's Health #MensHealthMonth is held in June each year to promote awareness about #MensHealth, and encourage them to prioritize their mental and physical #wellbeing, as well as address the challenges faced by men. This significant event empowers men to seek preventive care, engage in conversations about important health issues, adopt healthy habits, and make positive changes in their lives. By raising awareness and fostering open dialogue, it aims to improve overall health and inspire a healthier future for men everywhere. #MensHealthMonth2024 #DYK üì∏ : Nathan Anderson\n\nAs part of our #WomensMonth campaign, we want to provide women with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions on their health. As many women know, we know our bodies better than anyone. But what you may not know are the different sets of symptoms women experience before a heart attack that vary from what men might experience. Knowing the symptoms can make all the difference in accurately spotting a heart attack before it strikes.

At ACESWorld, we work to promote health equity through many of our projects. While there are many issues for women in #healthequity, health equity is also an issue for men! Men generally report poorer health outcomes than women across many indicators. This includes heart disease, cancer, lung disease, stroke, and diabetes. These #disparities can be multifaceted, influenced by factors like race, socioeconomic status, and cultural attitudes towards health and wellness. During this week, let's remember to #advocate for men's physical, mental and emotional health, and recognize the worse health outcomes they face, and how various stakeholders can help support them in their health! #FollowUs to keep up with different health issues men face this week! #MensHealthWeek\n\nIt's National Women's Health Week! This year‚Äôs theme is ‚ÄúKnow Your Bones,‚Äù to empower women to take charge of their bone health, including preventing and managing osteoporosis. You‚Äôre not too young to start thinking about #osteoporosis. While anyone can develop #osteoporosis, women are more likely to get it than men. And you might be at even higher risk if you: ‚Ä¢ Are over age 50 ‚Ä¢ Smoke ‚Ä¢ Have a slim, thin body ‚Ä¢ Have family members who had osteoporosis ‚Ä¢ Do not get enough weight-bearing exercise, such as walking ‚Ä¢ Drink alcohol (more than 3 drinks a day) ‚Ä¢ Have certain other medical conditions or take certain medicines for a long time Take steps now to #KnowYourBones early on and help reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis later.

But how often do we see these same mothers neglecting their own health? I've witnessed it firsthand: üëâüèΩ Women who give endlessly to others but hesitate to prioritize themselves until it's almost too late. Research, like that from the American Heart Association, reveals a troubling trend: üëâüèΩ Women delay medical help during emergencies, attributing symptoms to stress. Shockingly, studies show that women are 33% more likely than men to delay seeking medical attention during a heart attack. ‚óº From neglecting minor symptoms in their 30s ‚óº To facing serious health declines in their 40s and beyond, it's a heartbreaking cycle. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 67% of women aged 40 and over have had a mammogram in the past two years, compared to 73% of men who have had prostate cancer screenings. Imagine a different narrative: ‚úÖ A woman prioritizing her well-being from the start, seeking care and thriving. Let's rewrite the story of women's health, Where self-care isn't SELFISH‚Äîit's ESSENTIAL. Follow me to empower women to live with healthy standards. #fitness #women #wellness\n\nIn the US, cardiovascular disease, or CVD, is the leading cause of death for women, and it also accounts for at least a third of the women's health gap. McKinsey Health Institute's latest report highlights how a lack of data and inequities between women and men in care delivery and efficacy have contributed to this disparity for over a century. Alongside my colleague Megan Greenfield, Ph.D. and leaders of the American Heart Association, we identify the actions needed to improve women's heart health, which could unlock at least 1.6 million years of higher-quality life and boost the US economy by $28 billion annually by 2040. Read the report, developed in collaboration with the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women movement: https://lnkd.in/dnV4Pgqq #WomensHealth #HeartHealth #HealthEquity #CloseTheWomensHealthGap\n\nMcKinsey Health Institute latest report in collaboration with the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women movement highlights the importance of accounting for sex and gender based differences in research so they emerge sooner, can be addressed and ensure better health outcomes. The report noted: \"The understanding of biological differences is expanding, but major knowledge gaps still exist. Heart health‚Äîor lack thereof‚Äîaffects not only the cardiovascular system but the whole body, including the gastrointestinal, immune, musculoskeletal, neurological, pulmonary, and renal systems. For example, midlife hypertension is associated with an approximately 60 percent increased risk of all-cause dementia, and systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 160 millimeters of mercury) is associated with an approximately 25 percent increased risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Women go through unique stages of life characterized by fluctuating levels of estrogen (such as puberty and menopause) and additional physiological stress on the body (such as pregnancy). With the increasing prevalence of CVD in women, novel sex-related risk factors should be considered in combination with behavioral, environmental, and social factors to guide its early prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in women across all stages of life. There‚Äôs ample opportunity for research into better understanding the links between menstruation and the overall health of a woman. With greater knowledge and treatment options, women can embark on a lifelong journey to view their heart health more holistically.\" Good News! My Normative can help! Curious?
