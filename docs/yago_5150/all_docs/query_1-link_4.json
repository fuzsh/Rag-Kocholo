        "text": "Raven-haired actress Jill Hennessy's self-confidence and maturity led to early success as a cast member of the enduring crime drama series \"Law & Order\" (NBC, 1990-2010), in the role of Assistant District Attorney Claire Kincaid for three seasons. Perhaps due in part to the nomadic nature of her childhood, Hennessy refused to limit her creative output, picking up parts in feature films like Ron Howard's ensemble drama \"The Paper\" (1994) and a supporting role in the indie biopic \"I Shot Andy Warhol\" (1995). After her departure from \"Law & Order,\" she had more small turns on the big screen in projects such as the romantic-comedy \"A Smile Like Yours\" (1997), as well as the clich√©-ridden action movie \"Most Wanted\" (1997). Hennessy made a return to television in the historical miniseries \"Nuremburg\" (TNT, 2001), as an attorney assisting Nazi war crimes prosecutor Alec Baldwin, prior to starring in a series of her own, \"Crossing Jordan\" (NBC, 2001-07). As driven medical examiner Jordan Cavannaugh, she doggedly pursued justice for those no longer able to secure it for themselves. After \"Crossing Jordan\" completed its run, there were more film roles for Hennessy, such as the critically panned, but commercially successful, \"Wild Hogs\" (2007) and the independent family melodrama \"Lymelife\" (2008). While never a major marquee name, Hennessy's talent and likability allowed her to continue to work on projects both pragmatic and personal."
