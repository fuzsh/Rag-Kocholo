        "text": "Former President George Bush visited his Adams Street birthplace yesterday, reminiscing about his mother and spending a few minutes inside the second-floor bedroom where he was born 73 years ago.\n\n``He said he was glad to see the bedroom,'' said Nina Graves, who owns the house. ``He was the only one I let up there. He talked about his mother and the last time he saw her before she died.''\n\nAlthough he lived in the house for only the first six months of his life, Bush was nostalgic about seeing such an early part of his family's history up close, Graves said.\n\nBush said Milton was where his parents, Prescott and Dorothy, started instilling in him the importance of family values and morals.\n\n``Perhaps at six or eight months, that's a little young to think that would take place,'' Bush said in a brief speech. ``But what I'm telling you is that the importance of the values we get from our families, values that I think of when I think of Milton, Massachusetts, and the people here and the history of this town, are what life is really all about.''\n\nClose to 1,000 people turned out to wish Bush a hearty welcome home.\n\nThe former president spent only a few minutes inside the second-floor bedroom of the house at the corner of Adams and Hutchinson streets where he was born on June 12, 1924. He toured the historic Victorian mansion with the current owners, Dean and Nina Graves, and their daughter, Valerie.\n\nTanned and looking high-spirited, Bush cracked jokes throughout his brief remarks. He acknowledged that he had no memories about the time his family lived here. ``I was potty trained in six months, however, right here in this house. It's a remarkable historical fact that will live on forever,'' he said with a smile.\n\nHe also kidded about the popularity of his wife, Barbara, his loss in the 1992 presidential election and his recent skydiving adventure that made national headlines.\n\n``I told (Barbara) I would like to parachute into this square here. She said, `Why don't you go ahead and do it. They wouldn't have seen a freefall like that since the 1992 election,' '' he said.\n\nBush said he is enjoying life in his retirement. ``All is well with the Bushes,'' he said. ``What matters in life is your friends, and your faith and your family.''\n\nBush's whirlwind half-hour visit to Milton culminated in the unveiling of a plaque on a granite stone marking 173 Adams St. as his birthplace.\n\nBefore the unveiling ceremony, Bush, accompanied by acting Gov. Paul Cellucci, met the Graves family on the porch of the home. The 41st president downed a glass of lemonade and nibbled on a chocolate chip cookie as he posed for pictures with the family and town officials.\n\nStanding on a stage erected across Hutchinson Street, Bush thanked the Graves family ``for letting us descend on their lovely house,'' which was draped with red, white and blue bunting for the occasion.\n\nSpectators were kept back by police barricades, as a who's who of local officials and special guests stood in a VIP section in front of the stage.\n\nBush is the fourth president born in Norfolk County and becomes the fourth to have his birthplace recognized, following John Adams and John Quincy Adams in Quincy and John F. Kennedy in Brookline.\n\nTown Clerk James Mullen Jr., who organized the event and served as master of ceremonies, said the president seemed touched by the large turnout and all the tributes.\n\n``I speak for all the citizens of the town when I say welcome home President Bush,'' Mullen told Bush.\n\nSelectmen had signed a proclamation designating yesterday President George Herbert Walker Bush Day.\n\n``The citizens of Milton are proud of our town history, beginning with our town's own birth in 1640. And we feel especially thrilled when we see Milton, Massachusetts, listed as your birthplace,'' Selectmen Chairwoman Katherine Haynes Dunphy said.\n\n``Although your early days in Milton were brief and left no memories, we hope you will go away from this brief visit with warm memories of our admiration and affection for you,'' she said.\n\nBush was presented with several gifts, including a resolution from the Legislature courtesy of the town's state representatives and senators, a Milton High School diploma and baseball cap from the school committee, books on the history of the town and the town seal and a copy of the town records from 1662 to 1729 from selectmen.\n\nCellucci, who was Bush's state campaign chairman, said, ``We can never repay George Bush for the contribution that he has made to the American way of life.\n\n``This simple monument will stand forever as a sign that this great leader, that this great president, began his life's journey on Massachusetts soil.''\n\nBush, in turn, said Cellucci supported him ``long before the name George Bush was ever heard, while I was just an asterisk in these deadly (election) polls we all live and die by.''\n\nLast night Bush and Cellucci attended the Red Sox game against the Texas Rangers, a team owned by Bush's son, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.\n\nBush arrived at Logan Airport and was escorted to and from town by four Milton officers on motorcycles. The ceremony was scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. but stepped off a half-hour behind schedule because of rush-hour traffic. Other than that, the ceremony was glitch-free.\n\nBush's visit forced the closing of Adams Street from Centre Street to Canton Avenue. Parked cars lined Randolph Avenue and streets in Lower Mills, and traffic was temporarily snarled in the area as the ceremony concluded.\n\nLt. Richard Wells, police spokesman, said the town and residents weathered the ex-president's visit with few problems. ``I didn't know what to expect,'' he said. ``Considering it was the height of rush-hour traffic, everything went pretty smoothly.''\n\nAfter Bush's departure, the Graves held an invitation-only party in their yard. Guests were not given tours of the house. Even town officials and reporters were turned away.\n\nWith all the attention the house has received in the last few weeks, Nina Graves said, she and her husband are prepared for any curiosity-seekers who may come knocking on the door.\n\n``We'll handle it as it comes,'' she said."
