        "text": "Remarks by the President in Small Business Roundtable -- February 28, 2001\n\nControl Concepts\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\n9:35 A.M. EST\n\nQ What a distinct honor and privilege to have you here today.\n\nI guess I have to open up with a tough question. I have a four-year-old daughter and a two-year-old daughter who are out here in the crowd. My four-year-old wants to know the name of your puppies. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Let me see if I can get it right. (Laughter.)\n\nWe're the proud owner of Spot. She was born in the White House in 1989 to Millie. (Applause.) On November the 4th, I was campaigning in New Jersey. It happened to be my wife's birthday. And the then governor of New Jersey said, well, Governor, what did you buy your wife for her birthday. I said, nothing, which wasn't the right answer. (Laughter.) Certainly not politically correct, as they say.\n\nIt then happened that Laura and Christie Todd started talking about the fact that Christie Todd raises Scottish terriers. It turns out I did buy my wife something for her birthday, a Scottish terrier named Barney, who is having a heck of a time on the carpet upstairs in the White House, by the way.\n\nI think the answer is Spot and Barney -- (laughter) -- and one cat named India.\n\nQ Thank you, sir.\n\nI would like to say a little bit about Control Concepts, who we are and what we do. We are a manufacturer of industrial electrical switches for heavy-duty machinery. We have been in business since 1976, when the company was founded by my father in 1976. I am second generation in the business.\n\nThe electrical switches that we manufacture are used in things like food processing industry, the package industry, the machine tool industry, petrochem facilities, offshore oil rigs, et cetera, and they are used to basically start or stop a piece of equipment or have an indicator light on it that will indicate the status of what a machine is in.\n\nWe do something a little unique in our industry, especially for a small to medium-size company, where we actually manufacture every single thing here under one roof. Now, we don't make light bulbs and we don't make the raw materials, but we actually manufacture our own tools, dies and molds to do our own injection molding, do our own assembly. Everything, you name it, it is done here under this roof and we can control the quality of the product that way, we can control the quality of the service and the delivery of the product -- ship every order the same day we receive it 95 percent of the time. And we also control the cost and pass on a significant cost savings to our customers.\n\nAs a small to medium-size business, a capital intensive kind of business, we were very interested to hear your budget proposal in your tax plan last night. It appears that it is going to be of great benefit to Control Concepts and hopefully of great benefit to the rest of the nation and to small companies across the nation.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, sir.\n\nI want to thank you all for having me. First, the greatness -- this country's greatness is because there are a lot of entrepreneurs in America, and you are an entrepreneur. And I'm honored to be sitting next to you and your son.\n\nI love the concept of a family-owned business, the idea of a mom and her son working together to not only produce a product but, more importantly, to employ capital so people can find work. After all, small businesses are the main creators of jobs in America. And all public policy and tax policy must work to create an environment in which entrepreneurship can flourish.\n\nSo my speech last night was speaking not only about a budget, but was also talking about the entrepreneurial spirit in our country. And one of the reasons we came here is because the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well here and I appreciate it very much. (Applause.)\n\nIt is important to remember the role of government is not to create wealth. The role of government is to create an environment in which businesses, small and large, can flourish. That's the role of government. (Applause.)\n\nI want to thank my friend the governor of Pennsylvania for being here. We hosted the governors at the White House last Sunday night. It happened to be the first lady of Pennsylvania's birthday as well. And it was good to see you, Tom. Thanks for coming. (Applause.)\n\nPennsylvania is well represented in the United States Senate by two very capable, smart, concerned Pennsylvania citizens. So concerned we spent most of the flight from Washington to Pennsylvania talking about how to make the economy of Pennsylvania a better place. Senator Spector and Senator Santorum are not shrinking violets when it comes to making the case for the citizens of Pennsylvania and the country. I want to thank you all for traveling with me. (Applause.)\n\nFinally, a freshman, just like me, Melissa Hart. And Melissa is an active soul -- (applause).\n\nI appreciate you giving me the chance to explain the rationale behind my budget. It was very important for people to hear that what I think is -- what I know is true, and that is we've got a lot of cash flow coming into the U.S. Treasury. And the fundamental question is what to do with it. How best can we spend the people's money?\n\nLast night I made the case that our nation can achieve the following priorities: One, set aside all payroll taxes that are designed for Social Security to be spent only on Social Security. That is $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years will be set aside to be spent only -- only -- on Social Security. I believe there's wide consensus on both sides of the aisle that that is prudent fiscal policy.\n\nSecondly, I made the case that we can prioritize and fund Medicare for our senior citizens, that we're going to spend -- we're going to double the Medicare budget over the next 10 years. And if we have the right kind of leadership in the Congress, someone willing to -- people willing to work with the President to reform Medicare, we will not only have money to fund Medicare, we will have a Medicare system that will enable seniors to choose the health care plan that meets their needs, all of which will include prescription drugs.\n\nI made the case that we can meet our needs by funding what's called discretionary spending at a 4 percent increase. Some says 4 percent sounds like a small number, but I want to remind you it's greater than the rate of inflation.\n\nIt is less than what Congress spent during the last three session, I readily concede. But we've got to be careful about over-spending in Washington, D.C. We shouldn't have bidding contests in Washington. What we ought to have is rewards for people who are concerned about over-spending, it seems like to me. And so I propose increasing the discretionary spending at 4 percent.\n\nIt means, for example, that public schools will get a significant increase in spending out of the federal government. Now, having said that, I promise you I will stand tough to the principle that we ought to run our schools locally -- that local control of the schools -- (applause.) We've got to run our schools locally in order to achieve excellence for every single child.\n\nWe need to pay our soldiers more money. (Applause.) But before we spend a lot of money on the Defense Department, it seems wise -- and I think business people will agree with this -- that we ought to have a strategy about what our military ought to look like in the long-term. We've got to make sure we have a proper strategy on how to prioritize our military spending before we do so.\n\nThere is still money left in the budget, after growing discretionary spending by 4 percent, after funding the entitlement programs, after meeting priorities. Over the next 10 years, we set aside a trillion dollars for what I call contingencies, a trillion dollars in case we need money for additional Medicare spending or military spending or spending on farmers in America. So there is money set aside for that and there is still money left over.\n\nNow, the debate always seems to come out of Washington that if you have tax relief, somebody is not going to get their Medicare check. Or, if you have tax relief, somebody is not going to get a Social Security check. My point to you is that we set priorities and fund them. We protect Social Security and Medicare and fund them. We spend money on the military to keep the peace. We set aside contingencies, money for contingencies, and there's still money.\n\nAnd what I want to do is to remind Americans -- this is why I've come to Western Pennsylvania -- remind Americans that the surplus is your money, it is not the government's money, and once -- (applause).\n\nOne reason Dave and Janet sit here is because I think it is very important for people to know that behind every statistic there are Americans who -- in whom we ought to place our trust. These good folks pay $4,400 in federal income taxes. Under the plan I proposed last night in the Congress -- which doubles the child credit from $500 to $1,000, reduces all rates for everybody who pays taxes, drops the top rate from 39 to 33, reduces the bottom rate from 15 to 10, reduces the effects of the marriage penalty, eliminates the death tax -- these good folks will save $1,980.\n\nNow, for a lot of folks, they'll yawn and say, gosh, that's $1,980, that's really nothing. We disagree. We disagree -- $1,980 a year can make a big difference to people who are raising two lovely children, to people who want to set aside money for savings. It is so important for members of the Congress to realize what the average citizen is going through today.\n\nWhen you couple high energy prices with consumer debt, there's a lot of good folks who struggle in America. And it seems like to me the right thing for Washington to do is, once we fund our priorities, enhance the cash flows of the people who pay the bill in the first place in America. (Applause.) In so doing, not only do we help working Americans, but we also will add a second wind to an economy that is slowing down.\n\nI come from the school of thought, I know many of you do as well, that sound fiscal policy, coupled with sound monetary policy, is going to make a difference in this economy; that by giving people their own money back will be a part of sound fiscal policy. The more money you have to spend, the more money circulating, the more likely it is the economy will recover. And all of us in Washington must do everything we can to make sure that the economy is strong enough for people to be able to keep jobs and find work, if they're looking for work. That's the whole purpose of economic growth, is for people to be able to find work.\n\nI'm so thankful that you gave me a chance to come to make my case. I can't think of a better place to make the case than in a business run by a family, a business run by entrepreneurs, a business who care more about their employees than they do about themselves because they recognize if the employee is happy, an employee can work, an employee is satisfied, that the business it self will run well.\n\nIt's my honor also to be here with Dave and Janet and Erin and Jonathan -- Americans who, under our plan, will receive real, tangible benefits. But that's not really the right way to say it, is it? It's your money to begin with. Americans under our plan will keep more of their own money so they can spend it where they see fit.\n\nThank you very much. (Applause.)\n\nQ Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nDave, would you like to tell the President how you started here at Control Concept?\n\nMR. BERGER: Yes, I would. About 10 and a half years ago, I was out on the golf course with the founder of the company, Glen Taylor. And he knew I went back to college recently. And he was always asking me when I was going, how is it going, and I'd say, oh, not too bad. I was 33 at the time. I was working at Westinghouse and got laid off, and really basically decided what are we going to do from here on in.\n\nAnd after a while, I guess Glen was watching me for over a year or so -- he called me in after we got some things --- he says, I own a small business. He said, I'm thinking of adding a position down there that you could get into. He said, why don't you come down and take a look.\n\nSo I came down and looked around at Control Concepts. It was really small at the time. The dog ran out at you whenever you walked anywhere. (Laughter.) And barked at you. And I said, oh, boy. Walked in, talked to Glen, he gave me the tour. He showed me, and he asked, well, what did you think? And I had good feelings about this place. It was a homey feeling. Everybody stopped and said, hi, how are you doing, introduced themselves, showed me what they were doing, explained a little bit about their job. And I know they weren't told about it, they just naturally volunteered the information. And over the 10 and a half years since I've been here, the company has grown enormously. It's been a great 10 and a half years. I hope it's another 20 and a half years.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'll give you a loaded question. Do you want some tax relief? (Laughter.)\n\nMR. BERGER: All you can give. (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You know, I'm constantly amazed that -- first of all, one of the things that happens when you talk about tax relief, people immediately go to the class warfare argument, the only the rich people will benefit, which obscures reality, and reality is, $1,980 is a lot of money. And I'm not going to ask you what you're going to do with it, because I trust you to do the right thing with it. Frankly, it's none of the government's business about what you decide to do with your own money. (Applause.) But I bet it may have something to do with your children's future education, for example.\n\nMR. BERGER: Yes, it will. My wife would like to talk about her job, and also how that might affect her thoughts on that amount of money.\n\nMRS. BERGER: I'm an administrative technician at Medical Center Beaver, and I've been there almost 20 years. And I worked in -- where we do all of the pre-op testing and patient education for patients having surgery in the near future. I get to talk a lot with patients on anything, and I'm very glad -- and they are very glad that -- especially senior citizens -- that you're discussing their health care needs.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes. Well, we're concerned, all of us are concerned about making sure that Medicare fulfills the promise to our seniors. It is a solemn obligation that the federal government has assumed, and it's a solemn obligation that the federal government will keep.\n\nAnd there will be a lot of discussion, a lot of argument and we're going to end up with reform that will make the system solvent and give seniors a variety of options and a plan that meets their needs, all of which will include prescription drugs. And it's going to be a titanic struggle. But it's one that, with the right leadership and the right tone in Washington, D.C., people I think are going to be able to come together on, and I think we'll get something done.\n\nQ And on a personal note, I'm glad to hear that your tax reform will refund almost $2,000 for our family for education and our needs.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thanks. I -- let me talk about a couple of aspects of this tax relief plan that I want to explain to you.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that the government should not decide, oh, you get tax relief and you don't get tax relief. To me, the best tax policy is to treat everybody fairly and to say if you pay taxes, you get relief. (Applause.)\n\nSecondly, it is very important to understand that the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. If you're say a single mom struggling to get ahead in life and you're making about $22,000 a year, as she begins to earn additional money, she loses earned income tax credit, she pays payroll taxes and she pays income taxes, which means that every additional dollar above a level of $22,000 is taxed at nearly 50 percent. That's the way this tax code is structured.\n\nIt means that folks who struggle to get to the middle class pay a higher marginal rate than someone who is successful, someone who has got quite a bit of cash flow, and that's not fair.\n\nPart of the tax relief package has got to be aimed at making the code easy to understand and fair. One thing our country is known for is being a fair country. Another thing we ought to be known for is we want people to succeed and the code ought to reward success.\n\nSecondly, a lot of small businesses, as I mentioned earlier, these small businesses provide, by far, the vast majority of new jobs in America. And dropping the top rate will serve as a catalyst to attract capital to small businesses. Many small businesses are unincorporated small businesses; many are what's called Subchapter S businesses, and they pay the high rate. And by dropping the rate it will provide capital for small business expansion. And that's very important for this country. And I know the rhetoric will be, oh, he's focused on the billionaires and all that business. That's called class warfare. The truth of the matter is, this plan is aimed at helping small businesses flourish and grow and succeed.\n\nIt is important for America that the small business person remain vital and healthy. And so this is a plan that is well-thought-out. It is -- I found it interesting during the course of the speech last night, I said, some think it's too big -- and of course, those who thought it was too big cheered -- and some think it's too little -- and they cheered. Of course, I thought it was just right. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nLet me say that part of my job as President, as well -- I might as well be just very up-front -- is to travel the country ginning up support for this plan. And that's why I'm here. I would hope that you would not only contact your immediate representatives -- I don't think you need to in the case of the three here (laughter) -- but I would hope that if you find others that may be reluctant to listen to what we have to offer -- and I say \"we\" because this is a plan that really is aimed for people -- that you'd help, that you would write, that you would e-mail , that you would call folks to encourage them to be open-minded and to think about you when they cast votes.\n\nAnd this is a plan that will benefit hard-working Americans. I find it such an honor to be your President, and I love traveling the country to go out and -- I'm going from here to Nebraska and Iowa and Arkansas and Georgia. And it is exciting because this is a great country, made great by the fact that it's got such wonderful people. And it's so important for all of us who have the honor of representing you to have public policy in mind that makes lives easier. And this series of initiatives that we're going to be debating over the next months will be aimed, if it's done right, at easing the burden of the working people in the country. And America will be even stronger as a result.\n\nSo it's an honor to be here. (Applause.)\n\nQ As a business center, we couldn't agree more -- marginal tax rate is increased. Not only is it good for the economy now to give a jump-start again, it's good for the employees who are able to take that money and do with it as they please, whether it be in education, or back into the economy. But as a business owner, if the marginal tax rate can be decreased, we now have more positive cash flow. And as a result of that more positive cash flow, we can reinvest back into technology, into equipment, into product development, sales and marketing. All those things will help grow our business from a sales revenue standpoint.\n\nAnd as our business grows, we're now able to have more jobs. Job employment will increase. As a result of that, there is going to be more money back into the economy. So not only does it help our business, it helps most small businesses across the country and the economy as a whole. So we are very thankful and we're looking forward to this plan.\n\nThe other thing, Mr. President, that we're interested in hearing about, too, and we're excited about is the long-term debt reduction. What a great thing for this economy, not just for the economy as a whole, but also for individuals and small businesses as well.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I appreciate you bringing that up. We have set aside $2 trillion over the next 10 years to pay down debt. Now, people say, well, why don't you pay all the debt off. The one reason why you don't pay all the debt off is because at the end of 10 years, a number of bonds will have not matured. It does not make economic sense to pre-pay American debt that will cost American taxpayers a premium to do so.\n\nAnd so we pay down all available debt, all the debt that matures will be paid off. And it's going to ease the interest burden on the country. It makes fiscal sanity and sense to do so. And there's ample cash flow to be able to meet the debt requirements, and put aside a contingency fee, and provide tax relief.\n\nI urge the Congress to be cautious about over-spending. The rate of spending increased last year by 8 percent. That is a significant number, particularly when you're talking in terms of trillions. And there was something like over 5,000 one-time expenditures in the budget at the end of the year. And so we're going to have to work with the appropriators to say, let's be reasonable about how we spend the people's money.\n\nA sure way to make sure this economy gets drug down is to over-spend. A bloated federal government will affect economic vitality. And so it's going to require a lot of us working together to say, well, wait a minute, it's important to set priorities. One thing business owners learn how to do is how to prioritize and then have the discipline necessary to meet priorities.\n\nSo I appreciate you bringing up the debt retirement, and it's an issue that I'm confident we can work together on. It's just important for people to know that it's only wise to pay down a certain portion of the debt before it costs taxpayers an additional premium. And that doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense to do that. (Applause.)\n\nMR. BERGER: The education reform that you stated last night -- as a parent, Janet and I were very interested in that. We have two reasons sitting out in the audience right there. We were impressed that you were going to increase spending for children's reading.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I am. You all know I used to be a governor, and therefore, I'm a little suspect about federal involvement in any way, shape or form in education. I do, however, think that it is appropriate for the federal government to spend money, so long as it's spent wisely. I can't think of anything more important than to increase the amount of money available at the federal level for reading programs -- so long as the strategy makes sense.\n\nAnd there has been a lot of thought and a lot of research about what works. A lot of programs in states, you know, abandoned the concept of phonics and, as a result, many children weren't learning to read.\n\nThe reason I bring that up is I want to reinvigorate the curriculum debate, all based upon -- the conclusion of which we based upon a simple concept: If it works, use it. So part of the reading initiative is to encourage people to analyze the facts about reading.\n\nSecondly, I strongly believe in diagnosis. And I believe we've got to measure children. And I believe we've got to measure children to make sure that not any children get left behind. And that includes K through 2 little children. We ought to develop a reading diagnostic tool that can be easy to administer but point up where there are some reading deficiencies that need to be corrected early before it's too late. That is a very feasible and logical approach to reading.\n\nFinally, I know we need to retrain teachers. Part of the failures in our society thus far have been that some teacher colleges -- I'm certainly not accusing any here in the state of Pennsylvania -- that have not taught teachers how to teach reading. And if that be the case, we need to retrain teachers in the science of reading, so they can teach reading. So I believe this makes sense, the initiative. (Applause).\n\nI used to be a business person. As a matter of fact, I was in a business where the results were posted every day. It's called baseball. Generally, the results weren't all that good. (Laughter.)\n\nSo I understand when the president of a company says, what is the bottom line. It is a philosophy to which I adhere. I ask the question, are the children learning? And if we spend federal money, particularly on disadvantaged children, the debate ought to be not whether or not we ought to spend money on disadvantaged children; the debate ought to be, are we getting our money's worth?\n\nI believe every child can learn. I refuse to accept excuses that there are certain children who can't learn; therefore, let's don't measure or let's just move them through the system.\n\nAnd so therefore, I'm asking Congress to say -- to enact this reform. If you receive federal money, you the state of Pennsylvania or the state of Texas or any other state, must devise and implement an accountability system that determines whether or not children are learning basic English skills and math skills. That's what we want to know. Accountability becomes the whole cornerstone for reform.\n\nWithout measurement, we're just guessing. With measurement, it would enable policymakers and educators to devise programs that will meet needs. You don't know if you don't measure. And so the crux of the reform is that we do spend some more money, and that's fine. But money alone is simply not the answer. There must be reform. There must be a system in place that creates the incentive for people to change when there's failure and to address problems early before it's too late. It's the whole cornerstone of what we're trying to do.\n\nThe state of Pennsylvania can design the remedies. They can design what remedies will ultimately make a difference in terms of creating educational excellence. The federal government ought to be focused on some targeted spending, but also understanding that systemic reform will yield positive results for children from all walks of life. It is an incredibly important debate that is taking place in Washington.\n\nYou will hear much of the dialogue that will be all focused on dollars. That's an important part of the debate. But the truth of the matter is that federal government only funds about 7 percent of the education budgets in aggregate across the nation. Most funding, as you well know, in Pennsylvania comes from either state government or local property taxes. And that's where the power ought to be. It ought to be closest to the people who are paying the bills in order to make sure that schools chart the path to excellence necessary so every child learns.\n\nBut at the federal level, we can institute structural reform or insist upon changes that will eventually yield to structural reform, and that's what the whole educational debate is about, and it's an important debate in America and I'm really glad we've engaged early on that subject in the Senate and the House. We've got more than one. (Applause.)\n\nMR. TAYLOR: Education is also very important to me. As I had mentioned earlier, I have two small children. And as they grow up, we need to have some type of accountability so that they are learning the reading and writing skills necessary.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It starts with you, however, as you know -- (applause).\n\nMR. TAYLOR: By the way, just like you, I also married a teacher.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Did you? Good.\n\nMR. TAYLOR: My wife's mother had started a reading program here in the local Beaver community several years ago. She passed away two years ago, unfortunately, but I think it does support greatly your idea that the local government and the state governor are the ones who should support. They know what's best for the children in the area.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Amen.\n\nMR. TAYLOR: And it is still a thriving reading program.\n\nWould you like to describe maybe how the company got started, so he has a little more background on Control Concepts?\n\nMS. RENNINGER: Before I got into the company, I also was a former teacher. So I --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You did a pretty good job teaching this guy, didn't you?\n\nMS. RENNINGER: Well, I have two other sons, I have to mention their names, Greg and Gary. And Gary is in the audience today. And I applaud you on this support that you have for the education. It's certainly an investment into the future.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, my husband had a dream. He decided that he needed to start up his own company. Well, he was the visionary, he was the genius. I was the woman behind the man. And the plastic would go into the oven to dry before dinner could get ready. And then we would have dinner or I'd throw a load into the laundry -- but, believe me, we've come a long way since then. Back in 1996, my husband passed away suddenly. That left a business that needed to be taken care of, and employees that needed to be mothered and fathered at that point. We all needed to be nurtured. And that's what we've done. We are a family of employees. (Applause.)\n\nMy son and I pulled ourselves up by the bootstraps and within less than a week we were back in the office and assuming our positions, me as CEO and Jeffery in the position that he is now.\n\nWe've been able to continue. It's been a dynamic growing business. We are excited, and so are the employees. We try and return as much as we can to the employees because they are such an important part of our business. When we received last fall the entrepreneurial award for the county, this was due to my husband, my son, and also the employees, because Control Concepts is nothing without all of us working together.\n\nAnd again, I applaud you on your plan for small business because this is how we have grown. It took a lot of risk, a lot of hard work, a lot of love for employees and their love for us. But we work together, and this is what we hoping to return -- because with that, they will not only return to the employee, but the community and to the nation. (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it looks like Jeff and I did a pretty good job in picking our own mothers. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nQ Mr. President, thank you very much. Our business over the past 10 years has continued to grow, and it started when your father was in the position you are now. We are excited about it, excited that your budget plan, your economic plan is going to bring the wealth and keep the wealth here in the United States and bring prosperity to all Americans.\n\nSo thank you very much for being here. We have opened up our house to you, of all of our employees. So, thank you, everyone. (Applause.)\n\nEND 10:15 A.M. EST\n\nRemarks by the President at Nebraska Welcome -- February 28, 2001\n\nOmaha Civic Center\n\nOmaha, Nebraska\n\nListen to the President's Remarks\n\n1:46 P.M. CST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you very much. (Applause.) I'm glad I came. (Applause.) I'm not saying I don't like my new address, I do. But it's good to get out in the countryside, too. (Applause.) It's good to get out so I can shake hands with the folks that make America work. (Applause.) It's good to get to the heartland. (Applause.) Where people proudly stand on values of faith and family. (Applause.)\n\nI'm honored you'd invite me. I'm glad I came. Mr. Mayor, thank you for your friendship. It's great to be here with the Governor and First Lady of the state of Nebraska, two fine people. (Applause.) And two good friends of Laura and mine.\n\nIt's also a thrill to travel from Washington with two fine United States Senators. (Applause.) Senator Hagel -- (applause) -- and Senator Nelson. (Applause.) The good thing about these two Senators is this: I know I'm going to be able to count on them in the pinch. (Applause.) I know when it comes to doing the right thing, they'll listen to the people of Nebraska. (Applause.)\n\nI'm also honored to be traveling with the Congressman Lee Terry. He's a good, solid man. (Applause.) I'm proud to be on the stage with three Iowa Congressmen. And I appreciate you relaxing your border standards to let them in. (Laughter.) The Lt. Governor is here. My fellow citizens, it is an honor to be your President. (Applause.)\n\nI'm proud to call 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue home. And so is the First Lady. (Applause.) And I was proud to stand up in front of the United States Congress last night to bring a message of the American people, a common-sense message, a message of budgets and priorities. I truly felt like I was representing you when I talked about fiscal sanity and talked about the need for our government to set clear priorities.\n\nOne of our priorities in the budget and one of our national priorities must be to make sure that every child -- I mean every child -- gets educated in the great land called America. (Applause.) Even though I have a Washington, D.C., temporary address, I want you to know I strongly believe in local control of schools. (Applause.) I believe the people who care more about the children of Nebraska are the citizens of Nebraska -- (applause) -- and we must work together, the Congress and the Executive Branch must work together to pass power out of Washington to provide flexibility at the local level. One size does not fit all when it comes to educating the children of our country.\n\nI want to insist that we spend more money on programs like reading initiatives, an initiative that will help all children learn to read, an initiative that will be based upon the fact that reading is a science and we must use curriculum that will work. Phonics needs to be an integral part of the curriculum. (Applause.)\n\nWe're going to raise the standards. You see, what we believe is that every child in America can learn. We're going to reject the thought that certain children can't learn, so we'll just move them through the system. That's got to end. It's got to end. And what we stand for, what the people know makes sense is that, in order to determine whether or not all children are learning, it's essential that we measure. It's essential that local folks develop strong accountability systems. So we ask the question, do you know how to read?\n\nAnd if you do, we'll praise the teachers. And we always have got to praise the teachers. But if our accountability system shows that children are not learning to read, instead of sitting by and saying, oh, maybe something positive will happen, it will serve as a go-by, it will serve as an opportunity for us to say, let's solve the problems early before it's too late. There are no second-rate children in America and there are no second-rate dreams. (Applause.) So our budget prioritizes education with the understanding, however, that the schools should be run at the local level.\n\nI set another priority, and that's to pay the men and women who wear our uniform better wages. (Applause.) I am proud to be the Commander in Chief. (Applause.) The mission of the United States military will be to train our troops to be prepared to fight and win war, and therefore, prevent war from happening in the first place. (Applause.)\n\nA priority in the budget is to make sure the people who don't have health care insurance who work have health care insurance. A priority in the budget is to fulfill our promise to the seniors by funding Medicare. I want you to know you can hear all the rhetoric about the apologists for bigger government in Washington, but with the right priorities and the right focus, we will double the Medicare budget over the next 10 years, to make sure our seniors have got a Medicare system that we can be proud of; one that, by the way, includes prescription drugs. (Applause.)\n\nOh, I know you'll hear a lot of talk about Social Security, and we should talk about Social Security. But under our vision of what we ought to do with the budget, we set aside all $2.6 trillion of the payroll taxes that are heading into Social Security and spend them only on Social Security. (Applause.)\n\nNow, some of the people in Washington aren't going to like my budget because we don't grow the budget quite as fast as they would like. The budget increased last year by 8 percent. That's significantly higher than the rate of inflation. That was higher than real income grew. I mean, they were growing that budget, it was like a bidding contest to see who could spend the most money got out of town first. Those days must end. (Applause.) The budget I submitted to the Congress is one that said we could meet our needs and grow our discretionary spending at a realistic and reasonable 4 percent. (Applause.)\n\nThere's a lot of talk in Washington about debt, and like you I'm concerned about debt. I want to remind you there's two types of debt; one is at the government level, and one is at the individual level. First let me talk about government debt. With the right kind of leadership and the right kind of focus, and working with members of both parties, we can pay down $2 trillion of the national debt over the next decade. (Applause.)\n\nSomebody said, well, why don't you pay down more than that. Well, first of all, a lot of the bonds don't retire, aren't to be retired, they don't expire during the 10-year period. It makes absolutely no sense to prepay debt which will cost the taxpayers more money. That doesn't make any sense. We ought to pay debt as it comes due. And the only debt that comes due is $2 trillion over the next 10 years, and that's the debt we'll repay. (Applause.)\n\nWe paid down debt, we've met our priorities, there's still money left over. And like any wise -- any wise person who cares about budgets, we ought to set some aside for contingencies. So we set aside a trillion dollars over the next 10 years for contingencies.\n\nAnd what might some of those contingencies be? Well, making sure we take care of the seniors. As you know, one of the things I'm going to do is have a full review of our military's capabilities and how we ought to restructure our forces to meet the future. (Applause.) And perhaps we'll need more money to fund those priorities.\n\nI can assure you, we're going to worry about the agricultural sector here in the United States. (Applause.) And perhaps -- and perhaps we'll need to spend some of that contingency money on the ag sector as we transform our agriculture sector to one that is going to be able to trade freely around the world.\n\nLet me say as an aside, I strongly support ethanol. Let me say as an aside -- (applause) -- we should not use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward. (Applause.) We shouldn't view agriculture as a stepchild when it comes to international trade negotiations. (Applause.)\n\nSo we've set priorities, we've paid down $2 trillion dollars of debt. We've got a trillion dollars of contingency set aside over the next 10 years and there's still money left over -- there's still money left over, and there's a fundamental choice -- do we spend it?\n\nAUDIENCE: Nooo!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Or do we remember whose money it is in the first place? (Applause.)\n\nThe surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money. (Applause.) And I'm here to ask you to join me in making that case to any federal official you can find. I think we're in pretty good shape with the Nebraska delegation. (Applause.) I certainly hope so. I certainly hope so.\n\nBut this is a plan that hears the voices of thousands of working Americans, people who are struggling to get ahead. I'm keenly aware the energy bills are going up all across the country. We need an energy policy. We also must have a tax relief policy that understands working Americans are paying energy costs than ever before.\n\nI'm keenly aware that many of our citizens have got a lot of consumer debt. There's a lot of talk about debt at the national level, and I'm worried about it. I'm also worried about consumer debt on individual families. I'm aware that this economy is beginning to sputter a little bit, and it makes sense to combine good monetary policy with good fiscal policy. I believe by giving people some of your own money back it will help kick-start this economy so people will be able to find work who's looking for a job. (Applause.)\n\nIn case anybody asks you, here's the plan. We're going to drop the bottom rate from 15 percent to 10 percent. (Applause.) We increase the child credit from $500 to $1,000. (Applause.) We drop all rates and simplify the code. We drop the top rate from 39.6 to 33 percent, and there's two primary reasons, two reasons I want to share with you. One is there ought to be some principle involved in the tax code, and one of the principles is the federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check. (Applause.)\n\nBut there is a second principle. We must understand that there are thousands of unincorporated small businesses in America and thousands of sub-S corporations that pay the highest income tax rate. And in order to stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit of America, in order to encourage capital formation in small businesses, it makes sense to drop the top rate from 39.6 to 33 percent. (Applause.)\n\nI know the advocates -- I can already hear some of the voices of the advocates for big government, the folks that want to keep your money in Washington to expand the size of the government. They're going to say, oh, this is only for the rich. Well, first of all, we're going to reject class warfare. (Applause.) Secondly, we don't believe in targeting some people in or some people out. We believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. (Applause.)\n\nThirdly, ours is a philosophy that says we know government's role is not to create wealth, but to create an environment in which entrepreneurs and small businesses can realize their dreams in America. (Applause.) Fifthly, we understand the marriage penalty is unfair and we better do something about it. (Applause.) And those of us who have spent some time in the agricultural sector and in the heartland, understand how unfair the death penalty is -- the death tax is, and we need to get rid of it. (Applause.)\n\nI don't want to get rid of the death penalty -- (laughter) -- just the death tax. (Applause.)\n\nThere is a lot of talk, there is a lot of talk about how this plan isn't really going to affect people. Today, the Ojedas are with us, Tony and Cynthia, and I want to thank you all for coming. And I appreciate the patience of your children. (Laughter.) As you can see, they are proud parents of three children. Right now, last year, they paid $3,170 in federal income taxes.\n\nUnder our plan, a plan that benefits everybody who pays taxes, a plan where the greatest percentage of tax relief goes to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder, a plan that is eminently fair, a plan that doesn't affect the size of the federal government in a negative way, a plan that helps meet priorities -- these folks will save $2,120. (Applause.)\n\nOh, I know that doesn't sound like a lot of money to folks that are rolling in dough. But $2,120 means a lot to the Ojeda family. It means a lot when you're paying high energy bills. It means a lot when you are worried about the education of your three children. It means a lot when you want to save. It means a lot when you want to do your duty as a mom and a dad to prepare for your children's future. No, $2,120 is a significant amount of money. (Applause.) It's the right thing to do for America.\n\nNow, we've submitted the people's budget to Congress. It's a budget that sets priorities, a budget that pays down debt, a budget that worries about the future. But a budget that keeps in mind that our people are overtaxed. And I am here asking Congress to give you a refund. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE: Re-fund! Re-fund!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I want to thank you all for coming out. It is so refreshing to travel the -- to travel your streets and to see people come out. I know there is an overflow room here of a thousand people and I want to thank you all for coming.\n\nI want to tell you -- (applause) -- there is something bigger though than just a legislative agenda at hand. It is truly the greatness of the country. My job is to remind all of us that responsibility begins at home, that the biggest job, if you happen to be fortunate enough to be a mom or a dad, your biggest job is not your day job. Your biggest job is your 24-hour job of loving your children with all your heart and all your soul. (Applause.) That's the best thing all of us can do.\n\nThe best thing all of us can do in this nation, whether our job is President or Boy Scout leader or Sunday school teacher, or teacher, is to teach our youngsters the difference between right and wrong. Is to encourage them to be responsible for the decisions they make in life -- (applause) -- is to make sure that every child, regardless of how he or she are born, knows somebody cares for them, somebody loves them.\n\nNo, the great strength of this country, the great strength of this country can be found in the heartland of America, where neighbor turns to neighbor and says, what can I do to help you, neighbor, if you've got a problem, where there are thousands of people saying, I want to help somebody in need, coming out of our churches and synagogues and mosques.\n\nMy job -- my job is not only to argue and work to get a legislative agenda passed that will help Americans help themselves. My job is also to remind America how great we are, that we're a blessed nation, a nation indivisible under God, the greatest nation on the face of the earth. (Applause.)\n\nTogether, together we can help this nation fulfill its greatest promise, where every child realizes the American experience is meant for them, where every child can learn to read, where moms and dads understand the top priority is to love their children.\n\nNo, the greatness of this country is ahead of us. We've been great in the past, but the future has never been brighter. (Applause.) And the future has never been brighter. The future has never been brighter because the people of this country have never been greater. It is my honor to be your President.\n\nThank you for coming and God bless. (Applause.)\n\nEND 2:15 P.M. CST\n\nRemarks by the President at Leadership Forum -- March 1, 2001\n\nEgleston Children's Hospital\n\nAtlanta, Georgia\n\n3:17 P.M. EST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. And, Lydia, thank you for the tour. This is a hospital, but it's also -- it's a place full of love. And I was most touched by meeting the parents and the kids and the nurses and the docs, all of whom are working hard to save lives. I want to thank the moms who are here. Thank you very much for you hospitality. And, Tommy, I'll get to you in a minute. (Laughter.)\n\nThere's a lot of talk about budgets right now, and I'm here to talk about the budget. My job as the President is to submit a budget to the Congress and to set priorities, and one of the priorities that we've talked about is making sure the health care systems are funded. And Dr. Woods talked about our commitment -- and it's a joint commitment -- it's a commitment I'm confident the Congress will make with me to double the NIH funding by the year 2003. That's an important commitment of the federal government.\n\nYou know more than me about how effective those dollars can be, and it's a wise use of federal taxpayers' money. It means that the budget will be increased to $28 billion a year by the year 2003.\n\nSecondly, I want to talk about two other aspects of health care before I get into how this all works. One is we're going to double Medicare over the next 10 years, from $216 billion to $549 billion. It's a significant increase of expenditures. It's $159 billion in new Medicare spending above and beyond that which was projected. It means that our country is going to make a firm commitment to those who rely upon Medicare dollars -- the elderly, the teaching hospitals. It is an important federal commitment.\n\nBy the way, with the expenditure of Medicare money, we also have got to have the courage to reform Medicare to make it a program where seniors have got more choices and more options from which to choose to match their particular needs. And all the reforms must insist that prescription drug coverage becomes an integral part of the Medicare package.\n\nAnd finally, an interesting opportunity we have in the country as far as I'm concerned is to increase funding to community health centers. I'd like to increase the number of community health centers from 3,000 to 4,200 over the next five years, doubling the number of people who will be served.\n\nCommunity health centers are good opportunities to take pressure off of hospital emergency room, for starters. They're opportunities for people to get primary care who are indigent poor, maybe newly arrived to America. It is a wise expenditure of taxpayers' money.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make to the people of Georgia and will make around the country is the first job of a President is to set priorities. Not only are these -- the items I just talked about priorities, so is public schools. It's a priority. As a matter of fact, the largest increase in my budget is for public education.\n\nHowever, I'm mindful of the fact that the federal government is only a partial provider of funds and should never run the schools. I strongly advocate and strongly will fight for local control of schools. One size does not fit all when it comes to the education of children.\n\nAs an aside, one of the interesting reforms that I hope we get through the Congress says two things -- one, we're going to provide flexibility to local folks to run the schools. And secondly, if you receive federal money, you must measure -- you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract and, if not, correct.\n\nThis is an interesting place to talk about diagnosing problems, right here in a hospital. Well, we need to do the same thing in education, particularly in early years. We must diagnose whether or not a child has deficiencies in reading, for example, and solve them early -- and solve them early. And that's the whole spirit of reform that we're proposing.\n\nI want to pay the military more, folks. In my budget, we increase military pay by a billion dollars over the current pay. But having met all these -- and set aside all the payroll taxes for Social Security -- that's what we do, $2.6 trillion over 10 years will only be spent on Social Security. Now, that sounds like a lot of money, and it is. Except, we've got much more money than that available to figure out what to do with. And so $2 trillion will be spent to pay down debt over the next 10 years.\n\nAnd people say, well, you need -- why not more? Why not 800 billion more, or maybe a trillion more? And the reason why is because the debt doesn't come due over -- the amount of debt that comes due in a 10-year period is $2 trillion. There is no need to pay a premium to retire debt early. It would cost taxpayers more money, and that doesn't make any sense.\n\nWe still have money left. We've got pretty good cash flows at the federal level. And what I want to do is set aside a trillion dollars for contingencies and with the remaining money, which amounts to $1.6 trillion over 10 years, remember who paid the money in the first place.\n\nThe point I want to make in this haven of love, a place of deep concern about children's health, is that we can fund priorities. If we're wise about how we budget money, we can set aside important priorities and we can give people some money back, and I think that's really important. I know it's important at this moment in today's -- in history, because, one, our economy is sputtering. And the money -- if we can accelerate a tax relief plan to people like Tommy and Cynthia and everybody else up here, it will put more money in people's pockets, which will cause them to spend, which will cause the economy to get a second wind, we hope.\n\nSecondly, there are a lot of people paying higher energy bills than they paid in the past. It's like a tax. And I think it's wise if we're able to prioritize and realize we have more money to help people manage their own personal accounts, their own balance sheets. A lot of people have consumer debt that they're worried about. And there's a lot of focus on national debt; I focus on the people's balance sheets as well.\n\nAnd so I'm confident that not only can we meet our priorities, but make sure a guy like Tommy Winfield and his family who pay $1,380 of federal income taxes gets relief. In his case, he will end up paying no federal income taxes under this plan. His tax burden will go from $1,380 to zero. Now, there are some sophisticates who will say that's not very much money. But it's plenty for him.\n\nMR. WINFIELD: Mr. President, let them ask me.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Let the record note, this was not rehearsed. (Laughter.)\n\nAt any rate, I appreciate the chance to come and make my case for the budget, for the budget. And we had a great rally in DeKalb County and it gave me an opportunity to remind people that if you're concerned about the budget and you want there to be fiscal sanity in Washington with priorities set and funded, write your senators and your congressmen.\n\nI have great faith in the people of America. And coming to this hospital and seeing and feeling the love on the floor we were on, knowing there's dedicated doctors, loving nurses, spending a lot of time trying to help kids renews my faith in the greatness of America.\n\nI told the people earlier, the great strength of this country is not because of our government; it is because of our people. And this hospital is a living example of what I'm talking about.\n\nSo, Dr. Woods, thank you for giving me a chance to come and I'm looking forward to hearing from our other panelists.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thanks, Tommy, I appreciate you saying that.\n\nYou triggered something in my mind when you said that. Again, I want everybody to understand we've set priorities and funded them. There's a fundamental issue at stake here. And that is, do you trust Tommy to spend his own money? That's really one of the issues, if you think about it.\n\nAnd I want the people of Georgia to hear loud and clear my plan trusts the Tommys of the world to make the decisions. You see, I think he -- you can best decide what's best for your family, better than I can decide what's best for your family.\n\nAnd I shouldn't be trying to decide what's best for your family, after we meet some common needs in the country. Defense is a common need, health care, health research is a common need. Education is a common need.\n\nAgain, I just want to repeat, please don't hope that the federal government is going to wave a magic wand and there will be educational excellence. As a matter of fact, it's less likely there will be educational excellence if there's power in Washington, D.C., because the schools in Georgia are different in many ways from the issues that face Texas schools. And so we should not try to federalize education, but there are some things we can do by spending money wisely, and insisting upon local control of schools and accountability.\n\nAfter those needs are met, you're the person I want spending your own money. As a matter of fact, it's not the government's money; it's yours to begin with. And that's kind of what I'm trying to get changed, the whole attitude about the people's money.\n\nAs a matter of fact, we're not giving you any money back. As a matter of fact, I am trying to advocate that we're not going to take it in the first place, so you get to keep it. You know, we're spending on tax cuts. Well, that's kind of contradictory language because it's your money. And anyway, it's a mind set that I'm trying to get -- trying to impress upon the people.\n\nAnd the best way to get this done, in my opinion, is to rally the will of the people. I've got great faith in the American people and that's what this is all about. And so I'm so honored that you all are giving me a chance. It's an educational experience for me, it's a heartening experience for me, and it's a chance for me to move around the country, to get outside of Washington and sit face to face with real Americans who are working hard for their families, love their kids, love their country.\n\nAnd so it's an honor to be here, Bill. And thank you all very much, Lydia, thanks to the moms. I thank you for your courage and your love and God bless you all.\n\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. God bless America.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thanks for coming. (Applause.)\n\nEND 3:46 P.M. EST\n\nRemarks by the President at Welcome Event -- March 1, 2001\n\nFernbank Museum\n\nAtlanta, Georgia\n\n2:10 P.M. EST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. Thank you very much. (Applause.) I'm glad I came to Georgia. (Applause.)\n\nThanks so much for that warm welcome, Vernon. It's great to be here in DeKalb County. It is great to be introduced by one of the rising stars in DeKalb County, one of the rising stars in the state of Georgia. (Applause.) Vernon Jones is a good man. He's a good man. And I'm proud -- I'm proud to have been introduced by him.\n\nI'm also proud to share the stage with both Republican and Democrat elected officials here from Georgia, who are sending an interesting message. (Applause.) An interesting message, when the Georgia State Senate voted overwhelmingly to urge all the federal elected officials from the state of Georgia to support the tax relief package that I introduced yesterday -- (applause.)\n\nI'm honored that Senators Starr, Dean and Johnson would be here with me today. Both Republicans and Democrats took a look at what I proposed and realized it's fair. And I'm honored that members of the General Assembly, Westmoreland and Buck, have joined as well, one Republican and one Democrat.\n\nSee, this is not a -- the budget I submitted wasn't a Republican budget, it wasn't a Democrat budget; it was the people's budget. (Applause.) Maybe one reason why the good folks of Georgia understand that it's a reasonable is it's a common -- it's a budget based on good, sound common sense. There are not a lot of things fancy about it. Maybe it's because I was raised in West Texas and I was taught some good common sense. (Applause.)\n\nI'm so proud of members of the Georgia delegation who are here from the federal delegation, Kingston, Deal and Norwood, members of the United States Congress -- (applause). One member of your delegation wasn't able to be here, but I would like to read a letter from him, if you don't mind:\n\nDear Mr. President, welcome back to Georgia. I regret that I could not be with you today. I had to be in Washington for a meeting with the Department of Justice officials that was scheduled long ago, but I wanted you and my fellow Georgians to know that I am with you in spirit. I support your tax code proposal strongly, without any reservations. This is an overpayment of taxes and you are correct that those who paid it know better how to spend it than the Congress. As the old Elvis Presley song goes, we should return to sender. Zell Miller. (Applause.)\n\nI can't tell you how much I appreciate Senator Zell Miller standing up side by side with the President. Oh, I know he's a Democrat and, of course, I'm a Republican. But both of us put America first -- (applause) -- and this budget is an American budget, because it sets priorities. It is a budget that sets important priorities, starting with the education of our children.\n\nThe largest increase of any department in my budget goes to the Department of Education. But, lest you become too concerned, I want you to hear loud and clear, the best schools are those that are run by the local people. We strongly believe in local control of schools. (Applause.)\n\nWe will spend more money but we will also insist upon reform. And the catalyst for reform, the agent for change is to insist that states and local jurisdictions develop strong accountability systems so that we know. We know when children are learning.\n\nIf you don't measure, how do you know? If you don't measure, how can you correct problems early before it's too late? The cornerstone of reform is local control of schools and strong accountability systems at the local level, so we can diagnose problems early, solve them early, so that not one single child in America is ever left behind. (Applause.)\n\nAnother priority in my budget is to pay the men and women who wear the uniform more money. (Applause.) It is to make sure there is a high morale in the military by having better pay, better housing. But also it's important to have a Commander-in-Chief who will clarify the mission of the military. (Applause.) And the mission in to be well prepared, to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. (Applause.)\n\nA priority in the budget -- a priority in the budget is to take all the payroll taxes that are supposed to go to Social Security and make sure they only go to Social Security. (Applause.) Oh, I know you've heard the talk -- I certainly have heard it -- about how any kind of tax relief that has got any meaning to it will mean somebody is not going to get their Social Security check. That's Washington talk for we want more of your money to stay in Washington. That's what that is.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats agree that we're going to set aside all the payroll taxes from Social Security, and that's what's going to happen. Another line you'll hear is that the elderly will suffer. Well, my budget doubles Medicare spending over 10 years. We're setting aside money to make sure we fulfill the promise to the elderly.\n\nAnd we've got to not only set aside money for Medicare, we must reform the system so that our seniors have got more choices, more options, all of which will include prescription drug benefits. (Applause.)\n\nNo, we set aside money for priorities, and we fund them. The thing that's got some people concerned though, is we're not exploding the budget, like has happened in the past. The budget was skyrocketing at the end of last year. It was much higher than the rate of inflation and higher than disposable income.\n\nHad we kept spending at that rate, we would not only have spent all the surplus, we would have had to have dipped into Social Security to meet the programs. What this government needs is a fiscal, responsible approach to the budgeting -- (applause) -- the kind of budgeting that you, yourselves, do with your families. That's what the government needs, and I'm willing to provide that kind of leadership.\n\nSo we meet priorities. We make sure Social Security is safe and secure, and we also pay down debt. There's a lot of discussion about debt at the national level, and there should be. So part of the budget that I've sent to the Congress sets aside $2 trillion to pay down debt over the next 10 years.\n\nPeople say, why don't you pay it all off, all the national debt off? Well, that doesn't make any sense, because not all the debt retires -- comes due at the end of 10 years. We shouldn't prepay debt at a premium that will cost the taxpayers more money. Let's just retire the debt as it comes due. That's $2 trillion worth of debt.\n\nAnd it also makes sense to set aside money for contingencies, which we have done. We set aside a trillion dollars for contingencies. People say, what kind of contingencies are you talking about? Well, we may need some contingencies for America's farmers. (Applause.)\n\nOr, after we end up reviewing the military -- and remember in my speech, if you paid attention, or at least listened -- (laughter) -- I said we're going to have our defense vision drive the budgeting, and not the other way around. (Applause.) And we've got to make sure that we've got a plan. And we've got to figure out what systems make sense, as we head into the 21st century.\n\nInstead of having military budget spending be based upon politics, let's have it be based upon a strategic vision of how best to keep the peace, not only today, but down the road. We may need money for that. And so we've got a trillion dollars set aside in contingencies.\n\nAs I tried to explain to the Congress, we increase spending, not nearly as much as they did the last time, but we increase it. We set aside money for Social Security and Medicare. We pay down debt. And we set aside contingency money. And you know what? There's still money left over. (Applause.) And the fundamental question is, what do we do with it? What do we do with it?\n\nGuess what's going to happen. (Applause.) When you have more money than you need, it seems like somebody is getting overtaxed and overcharged. And what I am going to do is remind the Congress that if we've overcharged somebody, it's time for a refund. (Applause.)\n\nIt's time to remind people on a regular basis in Washington the surplus is not the government's money; the surplus is the people's money. (Applause.) And now is the time. Before this money gets all spent, now is the time to send some of it back.\n\nBut it's also the time to send it back because our economy is beginning to sputter. And one of the things we can do to make sure the economy gets a second wind is to let people have money in their pockets so they can spend it. (Applause.) One way to make sure that people can find work who want to find work is to set priorities, set contingencies, pay down debt, and give people some of their own money back. Or how about not taking it in the first place? (Applause.) So we reduce the rates on everybody who pays taxes.\n\nThere are some in Washington who say, well, some people need to be targeted in and some people need to be targeted out of tax relief.\n\nTHE AUDIENCE: No.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The fairest tax relief is to say if you pay taxes, you get relief. That's the fairest way to do something. (Applause.) We drop all rates. We dropped the bottom rate from 15 percent to 10 percent. We dropped the top rate from 39.6 to 33 percent. (Applause.) And one of the reasons why it is important to drop the top rate is to recognize the contributions that small businesses play in America. Small business -- (applause) -- small businesses are really the backbone of the capitalist system. The entrepreneur is a soul who dreams big and works hard to realize a dream and therefore ends up employing people. That's what the small business is all about. (Applause.)\n\nWhat I hope Congress recognizes is that many small business folks are unincorporated and many of them are sub-chapter S, which means they pay the highest rate. And by dropping the rate, we increase the ability of small businesses to grow and to employ more Americans. (Applause.)\n\nOur current tax code is unfair. It is unfair for folks who live on the outskirts of poverty, who are struggling to get ahead. It's unfair. It's unfair that if you're a single mother, working hard, and you're in the $22,000 range, for every additional dollar she earns, what's unfair is that's taxed at a higher rate then someone who is very successful.\n\nI used to try to paint the picture during the campaign about the toll booth in the road to the middle class. It meant people on one side of the toll booth paid a lower marginal rate than those trying to get through. That's not what America's about, as far as I'm concerned, and I know it's not about what -- as far as you're concerned.\n\nThis is a country that says, the harder you work, the more you struggle, the more likely it should be you're able to realize your dreams. No, we need to drop the bottom rate, and we need to make sure that that hard working waitress is more likely to be able to save and dream and build. (Applause.)\n\nWe penalize marriage in the tax code, and that's not right. And the death tax is wrong. (Applause.) It taxes people assets-wise. Now, this is a tax plan that is well thought out. And it's fair. As I said in my speech, some folks will say it's too big. Some folks will say it's too small. We need to send the message to Republican and Democrat legislators and senators that it is just right. (Applause.)\n\nAnd so I'm here to ask for your help. I'm here to ask for your help. You don't have to worry about Zell Miller. You don't have to worry about these three U.S. congressmen who are here. But there may be some other folks from the state of Georgia who might be a little nervous about the plan. I certainly hope not. We're not going to take anything for granted, though.\n\nSo if you find a member that you may have some influence with, or know an email address, or can figure out where to write a letter, and find out somebody isn't listening to you, to do what's right for the country, just drop them a line. I could use your help. (Applause.)\n\nAnd if somebody argues with you, just remind them of these facts, that the average family will receive $1,600 in tax relief. That doesn't seem like a lot, to some of the folks who may be doing all right, but it's a lot to a lot of people. It's a lot to people whose energy bills have gone up because we don't have an energy policy in America. (Applause.) There's a lot of talk about national debt. And that's important. But there's a lot of credit card debt that are burdening people.\n\n$1,600 can help a lot. $1,600 can help set money aside for a child. $1,600 is real money, and I'm going to remind those folks again whose money it is: It's the people's money, your money. (Applause.)\n\nI haven't been your President for a long period of time, but I can report that it is a fantastic experience. (Applause.) I can't tell you what an honor it is. I can't tell you what a high honor it is to represent the American people in Washington. That's why it's important to come out and get my batteries charged, in places like DeKalb County, Georgia. (Applause.)\n\nTo be able to look my fellow citizens in the eye and say, I know you're counting on me, but I'm counting on you as well. I'm counting on you, when you find a neighbor in need, to reach out a hand, and say, what can I do, brother or sister, to help you? I'm counting on you to run a Boy Scout troop, and to teach our children right from wrong. (Applause.)\n\nOur nation counts on people who have got good heart and good will to say, what can I do to make my neighborhood a better place, instead of hoping that the federal government, in its infinite wisdom, waves a magic wand and there's educational excellence in every school in Georgia. We need the good citizens of these communities to get involved with public education, to make sure our teachers are supported, excellence is demanded, accountability is in place so no children are left behind. No, I'm counting on you. (Applause.)\n\nThe reason I'm so optimistic about America, though, is that our land is full of loving people. The great strength of the country doesn't lie in the halls of our governments, it lies in the homes of our people. The great strength of America is the fact that America is full of caring and loving, God-fearing and decent souls, and I am proud to be your President. Thank you all for coming. God bless. And God bless America. (Applause.)\n\nEND 2:28 P.M. EST\n\nRemarks by the President to National Conference of State Legislatures -- March 2, 2001\n\nPresidential Hall\n\nDwight Eisenhower Office Building\n\n10:20 A.M. EST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Mr. Secretary, thank you for the three introductions. (Laughter.) When I was looking for people to serve in the Cabinet, one of the places I looked was for fellow governors. Because I strongly believe that there needs to be appropriate balance between the federal government and the state governments. And I found a good one in Tommy Thompson. He's going to do a great job, and I'm so honored that you're here. (Applause.) I appreciate you all having me. I see some familiar faces -- Mr. Speaker. I'm glad you all are here. I want to thank Senator Costa and Senator Saland for inviting me. I've got something to say about the budget, and this is a pretty darn good forum to do so.\n\nBefore I begin, though, I want to thank the folks from Quebec who are here. And, where are you? There you are, sir. Thank you for being here. I'm looking forward to coming to Quebec City in April. I had a good visit with the Prime Minister of Canada the other day, and I'm confident our nations will continue our long friendship together -- work together for the good of our two countries and our hemisphere. I understand we've got some folks from South Africa as well.\n\nWell, thank you all for coming. Welcome. I'm sure glad you're here. Any Texans here, speaking about foreign countries? (Laughter.) Darn it. (Laughter.) One of the things that I talked about with the governors, all of whom were here the other day, was a new federalism initiative. And my administration that's going to listen to people at the state and local level to make sure we clearly define the role of federal government and state governments. And then, have a -- by executive order, put a group together to make sure it actually happens.\n\nA lot of times in Washington, as you know, we tend to talk; and sometimes, the talk isn't backed up by action. And so we're going to work hard to make sure that the new federalism becomes reality.\n\nAnd it's important. Take a matter like education. One of my priorities as the Governor of Texas was education; one of my priorities as the President is to make sure every child gets educated. But I can assure you, this administration understands the importance of local control of schools. And we don't believe in the federalization of the public school system, that one size does not fit all when it comes to education. (Applause.)\n\nAnd, of course, ours is an administration that doesn't care whether you're governor or you're speaker or you're leader of the Senate. As a Republican or a Democrat, if you believe in local control of schools, you do so in a nonpartisan way. So we look forward to working with the Congress to pass power out of Washington, to make those federal programs that are prescriptive in nature become supportive of local efforts to meet -- so that each local state and district can chart their own path to excellence for children.\n\nOne of the reforms that I think that is going to be crucial is to work with states and local jurisdictions to develop strong accountability systems, that in return for federal money that you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract.\n\nWe will not have a national test. A test devised at the national level will undermine local control of schools. But I think it's a perfectly appropriate question to say, for example, with disadvantaged students, those with Title I money, that -- measure, measure on an annual basis. You develop the standards, you develop the test, but show not only the President, but show everybody else whether or not the schools are meeting the objectives.\n\nAnd if they are, we'll praise teachers like we should, all across the country. But if not, instead of just accepting the status quo, if it's okay to shuffle kids through the system who can't read, it will serve as a catalyst to change.\n\nAnd this is a substantial reform. On one side, you'll have people say, well this is not the proper role of the federal government, to insist that local jurisdictions show us whether or not children are learning. I reject that argument. We're a results-oriented nation. And there's no better -- no important place to find positive results than in our public schools, and no important place to find negative results, and correct them early than in our public schools.\n\nAnd they're going to hear people say, well, it's racist to test. Listen, I went through this argument in the state of Texas. It is racist not to test. It is important to test, because we believe all children can learn, and therefore, when we find certain children not learning, let's correct it. See, the attitude is, if certain kids can't learn, let's just not hold people accountable; let's just quit and move them through the system.\n\nThat's unacceptable to me. I know it's unacceptable to you. I believe it's going to be unacceptable to both Republicans and Democrats in the Congress. The cornerstone of reform is flexibility at the local level, coupled with strong accountability measures. (Applause.)\n\nMany of you all know the debates, oftentimes, on important matters like education, revolve around who spends the most money. And the truth of the matter is, the federal government's got a limited role when it comes to the expenditure of taxpayer's money in public schools. I mean, we fund about 7 percent of the total budgets across the nation.\n\nBut there is an important role for the federal government, particularly for disadvantaged children. And so we've increased our education budget by more than any other department in the federal government. The debate here of course will be, well, it's not enough. But for those who argue that, sometimes they're not -- they don't have to do what the Executive Branch does, which is to present an overall budget, to make it work. And that's what I want to explain to you all, how our overall budget works.\n\nFirst, there was a contest at the end of the last session to figure out who could spend the most money. It didn't matter what your party was, it looked like. The budget grew by 8 percent. That's a substantial growth in federal expenditures. My budget slows discretionary spending down to 4 percent. That's more than the rate of inflation. It's a pretty high increase in the expenditures, but it's nothing close to what was happening over the last three years, on average, at the end of last year.\n\nThat's caused some consternation because in Washington, the definition of a cut is that you haven't increased the budget as much as anticipated. You may be actually increasing spending, but that's called a cut up here. We've had to learn new accounting. (Laughter.) But we grow the discretionary spending by 4 percent.\n\nWe protect entitlements. All of the payroll taxes will be set aside for Social Security and only Social Security. We double the Medicare budget over a 10-year period of time. We increase Medicare in the first year, to meet all needs, and including having a prescription drug program for poor seniors to be administered by the states.\n\nIt is a budget that meets needs. And, by the way, we pay our soldiers more money; we've got an increase in pay for the men and women who wear the uniform. As an aside, I think it's very important for my administration to send this message to Congress and to the country -- that we'll first develop a strategic vision of military spending, a strategic vision of the military, and then we'll figure out how to spend the money; as opposed to let's spend the money first and then maybe develop a strategic vision afterwards. It's called planning. And one of the things that Executive Branch folks must do is to help plan the proper expenditure of money, and that's what we're going to do.\n\nBut we do increase the military budget, starting with the personnel, to make sure folks are better housed, better paid and better trained.\n\nAnd as an aside -- a second aside -- the Commander-In-Chief must set a clear mission for all departments, particularly the Department of Defense. And the mission is to be prepared to fight and win war, and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. It's a clear mission and a clear statement of purpose. (Applause.)\n\nThere is a lot of discussion about paying down debt. And it's a healthy discussion. We pay down $2 trillion debt over a 10-year period of time in our budget. That's the largest amount of debt ever paid by a country in history. I think that's an accurate statement.\n\nThere is also debt at the local level. It's called consumer debt. And so, while a lot of us up here talk about federal debt, one of my jobs is to make sure the nation stays focused on the debt that burdens the working folks in America. People have got a lot of credit card debt. And when you couple that with high energy prices, some of the people that you know are in a pinch. And we'd better do something about it.\n\nIt's important for our economy to do something about that. It's important for the lives of people who struggle to get ahead to do something about it. And that's part of the basis for the tax relief package. But before I talk about the tax relief, I also want to tell you, we've set aside $1 trillion over 10 years for contingencies.\n\nThat can mean a lot of things. Contingencies can mean -- well, maybe the numbers weren't as good, or -- I think they're going to be better than they anticipate, by the way. It could be that we need money for emergencies, which we probably will. Maybe need a little more money for some of the agricultural sector around the country. There are contingencies set aside.\n\nAnd finally, that leaves money left over. And the big debate here -- and you go through the debate every single budget session -- is what to do with it. And I am going to make the case, not only here in Washington, but traveling around the country, that we need to remember who paid the bills in the first place. (Applause.)\n\nI'm trying to be as -- to bring as much common sense to Washington as I can. And the speech I gave the other night was an attempt to say, here's the priorities; there's money left over. Here's the debt repayment; there's money left over. There's a common-sensical way to budget by setting aside contingencies, and there's still money left over. And, by the way, these numbers are based upon conservative assumptions.\n\nThe first year, the budget is based upon a 2.4 percent growth. It averages a little more than a 3 percent growth over the next 10 years. We can do better than that in America. America can grow our economy -- we're too strong a nation; we're an entrepreneurial nation. We've just got some unbelievable productivity gains to be achieved in our economy.\n\nPeople take a pessimistic view about how to project revenues, and that's fine. But I just want you to know I'm much more optimistic than the point of view here in Washington. People say, well, what happens if -- you know, gosh, what happens -- maybe we need a trigger mechanism, that's kind of the discussion. So, therefore, if the surpluses don't materialize, well, there's two reasons why surpluses won't materialize. One is that the revenues aren't quite as expected because the economy has slowed down, in which case we need to accelerate tax cuts.\n\nYou see, tax relief will put money in people's pockets, which will help give the economy a second wind. Or, a reason the surplus may not materialize is because Congress has overspent. So it seems like to me we need to be careful about any trigger mechanism that ought to be on spending to make sure that we don't overspend surpluses. (Applause.)\n\nThe tax relief package is well thought out and well designed. Of course, I would say that. (Laughter.) But we've spent a lot of time on it; as opposed to trying to figure out what number sounded like it made sense, we actually calculated the cost of fixing parts of the tax code that are unfair. For example, the death tax is unfair. Many of you come from agricultural states; you know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nThe marriage penalty is unfair. The tax code itself is unfair, because it's like we erect, as I said in the campaign, a toll booth right in the middle of the road to the middle class. One on one side, people struggling to get to the toll booth pay a higher marginal rate on additional dollars earned than people who are successful.\n\nIf you're a single mom, like I said in my speech, and you're trying to get ahead, and you're making in the low $20,000 salary range, as you lose earned income tax credit, as you start paying the 15 percent bracket, as you pay payroll taxes, your marginal rate is nearly 50 percent on additional dollars earned; and that is not right. And that's not the America that we all want our country to be. It sends the wrong message.\n\nAnd, therefore, we dropped the bottom rate from 15 percent to 10 percent and doubled the child credit, which will make the marginal rates on people starting to get ahead less, and that's important. Access to the middle class is a fundamental part of the American experience.\n\nWe also drop all rates. The temptation, of course, as you know, in tax policy is for people to say, well, I'll get to decide who gets the tax breaks; let me make those decisions. It's called targeting. I don't think we ought to try to figure out who is targeted in and targeted out. I think if you pay taxes, you ought to get relief. (Applause.)\n\nFinally, there will be a lot of discussion about whether or not we ought to drop the top rate. Well, first of all, if everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief, then you ought to -- need to drop all rates. But secondly, I want to remind you all that when you drop the top rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, it enables small businesses and entrepreneurs to more likely be able to expand their businesses. Because if you inquire, you'll find a lot of the small businesses in your districts and in your states are unincorporated small businesses and/or sub-Chapter S businesses. And the top rate reduction I view as a way to create an environment in which the entrepreneurial spirit can continue to move in America.\n\nOne of the most hopeful statistics I heard was in the great state of California, where there are over 700,000 Latino-owned small businesses in that state. That's a fantastic statistic about the American dream and the American experience and the whole concept of owning something.\n\nOne of the things that distinguishes our great land is people can own their own business, or own their own home. And the idea of encouraging the entrepreneurial experience to flourish, particularly in the small business sector, is what I think good public policy is all about.\n\nSo tax relief is not only to -- as a way to kick-start the economy that is in fact slowing down, but tax relief is also an opportunity to achieve certain objectives, to make the code more fair, and to make the small business person more likely to employ additional folks. And that's my case. I think we're going to get it done. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I'd like your help. I'm going to travel the country a lot, which I'm finding to be is important, not only to make the case; but it's important to remember where I came from. And I came from many of the neighborhoods that you all represent, just good, honorable, hard-working people. I cannot tell you what an honor it is to be the President, and to drive in those cars with the American flag flying, and to see people lining the roads, waving to the office. It reminds me of the greatness of the country.\n\nAnd it's the people of America. You know that just as well as I do. The people of this great country is what makes this place so special, this land so special. And all public policy must recognize that, and work to empower people, so they can help themselves. My budget does so. That's what the budget is all about. And I want to thank you for giving me a chance to come by and make my case.\n\nGod bless.\n\nEND 10:36 A.M. EST\n\nRADIO ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE NATION-- March 3, 2001\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good morning. As I begin, I want to say a few words about the people of Washington state. Earlier this week, that state was rocked by a powerful earthquake, which affected countless lives and caused billion dollars of damage. The Director of the Federal Emergency Management Association, Joe Allbaugh, went immediately to Seattle. And my administration is providing help. Our prayers are with the people of Washington state.\n\nA few days ago, I had the honor of addressing a joint session of Congress. I hope you had a chance to tune in and hear my plans for the federal budget and my priorities for the country. After making my case to Congress, I headed out early the next morning on a swing through five states, to bring my case directly to you, the American people.\n\nI approach our budget as American families do. First, we set priorities, and funded them. My top priority is education reform. And I have asked that the Department of Education receive the largest percentage increase of any federal agency. We increase funding for our reading programs and character education and recruiting good teachers. This time around, however, we won't be just spending more money. We will be setting higher standards, and expecting real results for all our children.\n\nWe're going to keep the promise of Social Security and keep the government from raiding the Social Security surplus. And to safeguard the system against long-term threats, I will form a Presidential commission to reform Social Security, and place it on firm financial ground.\n\nWe will spend more on Medicare, as well, nearly doubling its budget in 10 years. But just as important, we will modernize Medicare, to provide a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens. We will also support and strengthen America's military, starting with a pay increase, and better housing for our troops.\n\nAfter meeting these national priorities, my budget pays down a record amount of national debt. We will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. That will be the largest debt reduction of any country, ever. Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back money that we have borrowed. We owe this kind of responsibility to our children and grandchildren.\n\nAnd in addition to funding our priorities, and reducing debt by a record amount, we set up a contingency fund of nearly $1 trillion, and we still have money left over. The surplus money that remains will be used for a broad, fair tax relief. A surplus, after all, is an over-charge of American tax payers. And on your behalf, I am asking for a refund.\n\nMy tax plan reduces income tax rates across the board, giving the largest percentage reductions to working families who need the most help. My plan reduces the marriage penalty, and gets rid of the death tax. It will boost the economy, and help create new businesses, new jobs and new growth, at a time when we need all three.\n\nWhen the tax cut takes effect, the typical family of four will save $1,600 every year. Some say that's not much. But they ought to talk to people like Steven and Josefina Aramos, young parents trying to build a better life for their family. Right now they pay about $8,000 a year in federal income taxes. My plan will save this hard working family more than $2,000. Steven says, \"Two thousand dollars is a lot to my family. If we had this money, it would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in two years time.\"\n\nWell, I want the Aramos family and millions of others like them to meet their goals, and to live out their best hopes for themselves and their children. Our federal budget must be good for the family budget.\n\nThat was my message to Congress on Tuesday. And now, I hope you'll send a message in favor of tax relief to your congressman or your senator. After all, the surplus is your money.\n\nThank you for listening.\n\nRemarks by the President at Chicago Mercantile Exchange -- March 6, 2001\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\n2:27 P.M. CST\n\nWhite House photo\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you all. Thank you very much. Scott, thank you very much. I thought I had seen just about everything in life, until I came here. (Laughter.) It is an honor to be in entrepreneurial heaven. What an exciting place. Thanks for having me. I appreciate the hospitality, and I appreciate you giving me a chance to come and talk a little tax policy with you. (Applause.)\n\nI've had quite a day here in Chicago. I got a Chicago political lesson for lunch. (Laughter.) I dined with the Mayor. It's the second political lesson I've had in recent weeks. (Laughter.) The first lesson I got was in early November -- (laughter) -- if you know what I mean. (Laughter.) I told the people of Illinois every time I came here, I said, I wish the Mayor were on my side. Because he's good.\n\nBut more importantly, he's a really good Mayor. He's a good Mayor of a big city. (Applause.) We've had our time for politics; now it's time to do what's right for our country and for the cities. The Mayor and I share something in common -- we're both problem solvers. We try to have a clear-eyed view and a common sense approach to solving problems. And so we're going to have a good relationship. And I'm so honored the Mayor was gracious in dining with me.\n\nI'm also honored to be here with the Speaker of the House -- just happens to be from the state of Illinois. (Applause.) I'd like to describe the Speaker as a trustworthy man. He's the kind of fellow who says, when he gives you his word he means it. Sometimes that doesn't happen all the time in the political process. Sometimes they'll look you in the eye and not mean it. (Laughter.) The Speaker means it when he tells you something.\n\nI look forward to working with you, Mr. Speaker. I'm honored to be traveling with your United States Senator Fitzgerald. We flew down on Air Force One today -- he's a good young leader. (Applause.) Congressman Lipinsky is with us. We're going to fly back from here to Washington. He and I will have a little quality time together. (Laughter.) I'm looking forward to it because he's a quality person. I appreciate the Lt. Governor coming as well. And thank you very much for your hospitality. (Applause.)\n\nThere's a lot of people here reminding me that they're from Texas, and I appreciate my fellow Texans who are here. A lot of Chicago folks thanking me for the Sammy Sosa trade. (Laughter.) I'm reminded about the truth when I come to a place like this -- the entrepreneurial spirit is what America is all about. That's what this country is about. (Applause.)\n\nThe job of government is not to try to create wealth. That's not the role of our government. The role of government is to create an environment in which the entrepreneur can realize his or her dreams, which the small business person can start a company and make it grow. So my job is not only to deal with problems; my job is to understand the philosophy that has made the country great -- and never forget it, never forget it -- and that is that we're going to have dreamers in America. (Applause.)\n\nWe're facing a problem. And the problem is our economy's slowing down. You all know that as well as anybody does. This kind of great boom is beginning to sputter a little bit. And the question you need to be asking the President is, what do you intend to do about it, Mr. President. And here it is.\n\nOne, have sound budgeting in the federal government. It's to say to the spenders in Washington, D.C., here are the priorities for our country. A priority is educating children. And let me -- as an aside, as I continue to praise the Mayor, he has done a good job of setting high standards, strong accountability in the schools of Chicago. So a priority of mine is public education. I believe every child -- every child -- ought to be educated, and not one child left behind.\n\nA priority is to make sure we keep the peace by having a strong military. We need to pay the men and women who wear the uniform more money, to keep morale high. (Applause.) A priority is Social Security, to make sure the moms and dads of the World War II generation get the promises made. But it's also to be bold enough to reform the system, to let younger workers take some of your own payroll taxes and manage it for your own account. That's a priority of mine. (Applause.)\n\nMedicare and health care is a priority. And we double the Medicare budget over 10 years; we pay down $2 trillion of debt. But guess what? There's still money left over. If you don't spend like they spent the last couple of years, if you're wise and set priorities, there's still money. And the fundamental question is, do we grow the government, or do we trust people with their own money? That's the fundamental question facing the United States Congress. (Applause.)\n\nI had the honor of speaking to the Congress. I reminded them that when the government has a surplus, somebody is getting overcharged. And I'm here asking for a refund, I said. I want to reduce those taxes. (Applause.)\n\nI think it is particularly appropriate to not only cut taxes to make sure there's fiscal discipline in Washington, but it's necessary to make sure this economy doesn't continue to sputter. When you give people some of their own money back, or don't take it in the first place, they will have money in their pockets to spend.\n\nThere's some debt, all right, at the national level, and there's plenty of debt on the consumers of America. I bet you've got friends, and maybe yourself, understand what it means to have credit card debt. And when you couple that with high energy bills, there are some people beginning to feel pinched.\n\nIt makes sense to take some of your money and pass it back to the people who pay the bills. And that's exactly what my tax relief plan does. It drops all rates. (Applause.) It dropped all rates on all payers. Sometimes in Washington, you hear the talk, we'll have targeted tax cuts. That means the elected officials get to decide who's targeted in and who's targeted out. That's not fair, and that's not the right way to do it. If you're going to have tax relief, everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.\n\nSo we drop all the rates, and simplify the code. We drop the bottom rate from 15 percent to 10 percent, and increase the child credit from $500 to $1,000 to make the code more fair. The tax code's unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. The harder you struggle, the more -- higher marginal rate you pay in America. And that's not right. So we make the code more fair.\n\nBut we also drop that top rate, from 39.6 to 33 percent. And we do so for this reason: Much of the capital that accumulates in the private sector ends up being managed by small business owners. Small business is the backbone of the country. Many of you all are small business owners. Ninety-five percent of small business owners pay the highest marginal rate in our tax code. They're unincorporated businesses. They're what we call sole proprietors.\n\nWhen we cut that top rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, we're saying a loud and clear message that the entrepreneurial spirit will be reinvigorated as we head into the 21st century. It's a way to pass capital formation in the small business sector in America. And it's the right thing to do.\n\nIt's the right thing to set priorities, it's the right thing to pay down $2 trillion of debt over 10 years, and it is the right thing not to grow the federal government bigger than it needs to be, and trust people with your own money. I like to tell people in Washington, the surplus isn't the government's money. The surplus is the people's money, and we need to share it with the people. (Applause.)\n\nI like to move around the country. I like to get out of Washington, because you see a lot of interesting things and you hear a lot of wisdom from people who are just average, everyday people. And I want to tell you what a grandmother told the other day, in Council Bluffs, Iowa. She said, I have a lot of children and grandchildren go through my house. She said, and I know if there are cookies left on the table, they will be eaten. She said that in the context of your taxpayers -- of tax dollars. That's what she was talking about. And her point is this: If we leave the money up in Washington, and don't send it back to the people, it's, sure enough, going to be spent.\n\nNow is the time, now is the time for meaningful, real tax relief. And as we're changing the tax code, by the way, we need to eliminate the death tax, too. We need to allow it so that you don't get taxed twice for your assets. (Applause.) And we need to do something about the marriage penalty. (Applause.) It doesn't make sense to tax marriage.\n\nAnd"
