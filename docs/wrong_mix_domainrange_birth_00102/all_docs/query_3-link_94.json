        "text": "George Herbert Walker Bush has died at age 94. He was born June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts. He graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, on his 18th birthday in 1942 and immediately joined the Navy.\n\nWith World War II raging, Bush earned his wings in June 1943. He was the youngest pilot in the Navy at that time.\n\nIn his inaugural address on Jan 20, 1989, Bush spoke about America having a meaning “beyond what we see.” The idea of America and what it stands for is important in the world, he said.\n\n“We know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedom is right. We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state,” Bush said.\n\n“We must act on what we know,” he said later in the speech. “I take as my guide the hope of a saint: in crucial things, unity; in important things, diversity; in all things, generosity.”\n\nStatement by Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis on the Passing of President George H.W. Bush\n\n“President George Herbert Walker Bush, naval aviator, decorated in his youth for valor in combat, took his experience in war to build a better world as our commander in chief. His service to our nation demonstrated how we as a people can draw on our humility, diversity and devotion to our country to meet every challenge with fortitude and confidence. We will miss him, but at the going down of the day, his example will long guide our Sailors, Soldiers, Airmen and Marines for how to live life without regret.”\n\nStatement by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. on the Passing of President George H.W. Bush\n\n“The life of President George Herbert Walker Bush is an inspiration to all Americans. Today, we remember and honor his example of character, leadership, and service. His efforts throughout a long career of public service touched each of us in many ways, but none were more inspiring and impactful than his contributions to the defense of our nation.\n\nFrom being the Navy's youngest pilot in the early days of World War II to serving as Commander in Chief in the last days of the Cold War and through Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, President Bush's five decades of defending the American people and American principles have few rivals in our history.\n\nOn behalf of U.S. military forces everywhere, we salute President Bush and his incredible legacy of leadership and service to our nation.”"
