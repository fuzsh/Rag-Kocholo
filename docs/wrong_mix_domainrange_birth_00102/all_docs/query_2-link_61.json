        "text": "As President Bush toured a U.S. Coast Guard ship in Portland, Maine January 25, a reporter asked him whether he was considering cutting off ties with Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat.\n\nBush did not respond directly to the question, but said Arafat needs to \"make a full effort to do more to rout out terror in the Middle East.\"\n\nFollowing is the White House transcript:\n\n(begin transcript)\n\nThe White House\n\nOffice of the Press Secretary Portland, Maine\n\nRemarks by the President While Touring United States Coast Guard Tahoma\n\nPortland, Maine\n\n12:25 P.M. EST\n\nQ: Mr. President, are you consider cutting off ties to Yasser Arafat, sir?\n\nThe President: I am disappointed in Yasser Arafat. He must make a full effort to rout out terror in the Middle East. In order for there to be peace, we've got to rout out terror. And ordering up weapons that were intercepted on a boat headed toward -- headed for that part of the world, is not part of fighting terror, that's enhancing terror. And, obviously, we're very disappointed --\n\nQ: We're told that you thought his explanation was insulting, sir.\n\nThe President: I never said that. Thank you, all.\n\nEND 12:27 P.M. EST\n\n(end White House transcript)\n\n(Distributed by the Office of International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State. Web site: http://usinfo.state.gov)"
