        "text": "The Saturday attack on Donald Trump is raising new questions about security protocols around presidential candidates, especially a former president, and how a would-be assassin could get close enough to very nearly succeed.\n\nThe shooter fired from an elevated position from just outside the rally venue in Pennsylvania. That roof where the shooter's body was recovered, was only about 400 feet away from where Trump was speaking, and several witnesses say they saw him on the roof before the shooting and tried to alert authorities.\n\nAlso read:\n\nCBS13 spoke with a security expert from Maine, who's a former high-ranking member of the Department of Homeland Security under former President George W. Bush.\n\nHe says it's hard to fathom how a shooter could have gotten so close and that every action and security decision made by the Secret Service must be scrutinized.\n\n“I think he's alive today because of luck, because the shooter missed and that he ducked instinctively upon being hit. He was not saved by law enforcement. He was not saved by the Secret Service. He basically saved himself,” Josh Filler, a security expert and former Department of Homeland Security member, said. “At the end of the day the Secret Service can't delegate its core responsibilities to protect the candidates and the president, whatever they're going to do, they got to look internally at how this happened, why it happened and the changes they need to make to make sure it never happens again.\"\n\nAlso read:\n\nPresident Joe Biden has called for an independent review of security measures before and after the shooting.\n\nThe GOP-led House Oversight Committee is also investigating, planning a public hearing with the director of the Secret Service next week."
