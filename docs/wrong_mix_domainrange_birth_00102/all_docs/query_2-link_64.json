        "text": "PORTLAND, ORE. - President Bush promised to support more logging to thin forests and create more jobs for a state economy that has suffered the highest unemployment rate in the nation for most of the past year.\n\n\"We will do everything we can to thin out our forests ... to prevent the catastrophic forest fires that have plagued the West,\" Bush told Republicans who paid $2,000 a plate to help raise money for his 2004 re-election campaign.\n\nThe fund-raiser at the University of Portland brought in $1.04 million from the 520 GOP supporters who attended.\n\nBush said he would work to improve \"conditions for job creation\" because \"I understand that a lot of people are hurting in the state of Oregon.\"\n\nHe said he hopes to boost logging with his proposed Healthy Forest Initiative, which would ease environmental restrictions to allow increased thinning of forests considered a fire danger because of dead trees, overgrowth and crowded trees.\n\nBush praised fellow Republicans U.S. Rep. Greg Walden and Sen. Gordon Smith as \"common sense conservatives ... who are working to get forest bill through Congress.\"\n\nThe president also talked about the war on terror, calling it a success for more than 50 million people in Iraq and Afghanistan who \"lived in tyranny\" but now \"live in freedom.\"\n\n\"Terrorists declared war on the United States and war is what they got,\" Bush said.\n\nBush arrived at the private campus for the fund-raiser amid heavy security, including police dressed in black body armor. Streets in the neighborhood surrounding the campus were heavily patrolled and protesters were ordered to stay on sidewalks except for a three-block stretch that was cordoned off with temporary fencing.\n\nSeveral thousand demonstrators gathered near the campus entrance, many carrying signs criticizing Bush. One man wore a Bush mask and carried a sign that said \"Stop me before I lie again.\"\n\nThe visit marks Bush's eighth trip in the past four years to Oregon, a traditionally Democratic state that Bush narrowly lost to Democrat Al Gore in the 2000 election.\n\nPortland pollster Tim Hibbitts said Oregon will be a competitive state in 2004 and it's understandable that Bush is making an early push to try to bring Oregon into the Republican column.\n\n\"It's a smart move, because Oregon is going to be doable for him,\" Hibbitts said.\n\nMolly Bordonaro, Northwest regional chairwoman for the Bush-Cheney re-election campaign, said many of those who attended the Portland fund-raiser were first-time contributors to a Republican candidate.\n\n\"It shows the depth of support that this president has in Oregon,\" Bordonaro said.\n\nUnderscoring the close balance in the state, Democratic presidential hopeful Howard Dean was visiting Oregon a few days after Bush. The former Vermont governor is to hold a private fund-raiser Sunday in Portland, then attend an outdoor rally at Portland State University.\n\n\"He gets to come in and say, `You heard what the president told you. Now let me tell you what's really happening to our economy, our environment and our civil rights,\" said former Democratic Gov. Barbara Roberts, co-chairwoman of Dean's Oregon campaign.\n\nBush left Portland for Redmond to deliver a forest policy speech, but wildfires in Central Oregon prevented him from touring a forest site there.\n\nOn Wednesday, environmentalists held a news conference in Portland to criticize the administration's track record on protecting forests and oppose any additional logging.\n\nThe Healthy Forests Initiative \"is simply a cover to protect the timber industry,\" said Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope."
