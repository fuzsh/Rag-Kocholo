        "text": "The passing of George H.W. Bush was mourned this week; while the life of the nation’s 41st president was also celebrated during memorial and funeral ceremonies in Washington D.C. and Houston.\n\nThe late president’s final resting place is next to his longtime wife Barbara in College Station, Texas at his Presidential Library and Museum. Visitors to the museum may enter precise replicas of President Bush’s Camp David office, White House Oval Office, and the Situation Room; while seeing a World War II Avenger bomber (like the one he was shot down in); and a presidential limousine.\n\nTravelers who fly into or through Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport will find, in Terminal C, “Winds of Change,” an eight-foot, bronze statue of Bush in transit clutching a briefing book in his left hand and, with his right hand, holding his windblown suit coat over his shoulder.\n\nIn terms of travel, Bush was born on the east coast; learned to fly in Michigan; fought in the Far East over the Pacific; became a Texas oilman; served as U.S. Envoy to China in Beijing; lived in New York’s Waldorf Astoria Hotel while serving as U.N. Ambassador and, of course, lived 12 years in Washington D.C. in the Vice-President’s residence at the Naval Observatory and at the White House. He vacationed annually in places like Boca Grande, Florida; took cruises to the Greek Isles; loved fishing expeditions in Newfoundland and played golf at St. Andrews, Scotland and Augusta, Georgia.\n\nBut the place Bush loved most was being at the controls of his speedboat “Fidelity,” which he piloted up and down the Atlantic coast all summer near Walker’s Point, his seafront, summer time, family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to vacation in Kennebunkport, and the presence of the Bushes, for decades, has been one of them. Bush was often spotted on his aforementioned boat or playing golf (and sometimes fishing along the river) at Cape Arundel Golf Club, which is open to the public. Visitors have run into First Lady Barbara Bush in the grocery store. Other famous family members, including the 43rd President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, are seen in area restaurants such as Mabel’s Lobster Claw.\n\n“There are so many wonderful memories of ‘Mr. President’ and Barbara eating at Mabel’s,” said the fish house owner and chef Robert Fischer. “And enjoying cocktail parties at Walker’s Point was the highlight of our friendship.”\n\nDiners and overnight guests at Cape Arundel Inn have a view of the Bushes home on Walker’s Point. The inn’s “Ocean” is a restaurant the Bushes also often enjoyed. “It was a pleasure and a privilege to have served them. Their devotion to our community will never be forgotten,” said owner Tim Harrington.\n\nA permanent monument to the president, who called his Kennebunkport home is “Anchor to Windward,” is just that – a 6,000 lb. naval anchor along the coast above Blowing Cave, the scenic spot from which tourists can view the Bush house and the sea. A plaque honoring the president, reads: “As he was for our nation and world during four years of tumultuous and historic change, so, too, has Kennebunkport served, in the words of St. Paul, ‘as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stead’ to him.”\n\nWhen Bush was surprised with the anchor at an unveiling ceremony with a bagpiper playing in 2009, he said, “All this tribute and I’m not even dead yet.”\n\nDelta Airlines has direct flights from Michigan to Boston or Manchester, New Hampshire – both in striking distance - though Portland, Maine, a 40-minute drive away, is closest."
