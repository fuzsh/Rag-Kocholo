        "text": "We have been named one of “America’s Best Hospitals” by U.S. News & World Report and are consistently listed among the top 100 cardiovascular hospitals. Advances at Maine Medical Center include the 1,000th kidney transplant in Maine, the first pancreas transplant in Maine, widespread use of robotic surgery, and adoption of a safe patient and family centered care culture.\n\nConstruction of Maine Medical Center’s sister hospital for psychiatric care, Spring Harbor Hospital in Westbrook, is followed by the opening of Scarborough Surgery Center.\n\nIn 2009, Southern Maine Medical Center officially becomes a member of the MaineHealth system, and on January 1, 2014, Southern Maine Medical Center officially combines with Henrietta Goodall Hospital to become Southern Maine Health Care.\n\nIn Portland, construction for the vertical expansion on top of the medical center’s lower Bean Building near the Emergency Department began in February 2014. Surgery 2 opened in 2015, including five new state-of-the-art operating rooms, built to better meet the demand for routine and complex procedures. The $40 million investment in a 41,361 sq. ft. expansion also included 20 new spaces for surgery prep and recovery.\n\nIn 2020, the expansion of Maine Medical Center’s Emergency Department into the new Coulombe Family Tower helps meet the increasing needs of the community and the state. Maine Medical Center’s Trauma Center is the busiest in Maine, serving as a gateway to the most advanced tertiary care in the state.\n\nPlanning for a $512 million expansion on our Portland campus began in 2017. The project is designed to modernize the medical center’s facilities and ensure its ability to care for Maine’s sickest patients. Upon completion in 2024, the project increased the number of single rooms available to patients, replaced outdated surgical and treatment areas with ones that conform to current standards and invested $50 million in a new medical office building in Scarborough. Learn more about our modernization project.\n\nIn 2022, the Maine Medical Center Research Institute is re-named the MaineHealth Institute for Research.\n\nIn 2024, Southern Maine Health Care became part of Maine Medical Center. The integration resulted in a new name: MaineHealth Maine Medical Center. Our care team, mission, vision, and values remain the same, but as of June 1, 2024, our primary locations are identified as:"
