Mixing together elements of I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Craft, Tamara came out about 5-7 years too late, riding the coat tails of the post-Scream fad... asshole characters, dialogue about doing it, bullying, a really shitty prank gone too far resulting in Tamara’s death, and witchcraft resurrection.

A dude cuts off his ears and his tongue, Tamara spells her drunk incestuous father to eat all of his beer bottles... chewing on the glass etc and to be honest I wasn’t expecting any of that. She even spells two jock tough guy dickbags (responsible for her death) to bang each other lmao.

Sometimes when I can’t sleep at night I pop on some rando late 90’s/early 2000’s DTV Horror jam…
