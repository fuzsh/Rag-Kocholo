Lyrics

Oh, love or let me be lonely Part time love I could find any day So don't defy Mother Nature's ways Make it the love, the love That's here to stay I could live without love If I wanted to in this lonely room But I don't want to So I leave it up to you To wash away my gloom I could live without love If I wanted to in this lonely room But I don't want to So I leave it up to you To wash away my gloom, oh, yeah (Love, love) or let me be lonely (Love) you better love or let me be (Love, love) or let me be lonely Oh, you will or either you won't, baby It's up to you, I've had my say So truly love, do love me completely Hey, come on, come on, come on my way Well, I could live without love If I wanted to in this lonely room But I don't want to So I leave it up to you To wash away my gloom I could live without love If I wanted to in this lonely room But I don't want to So I leave it up to you To wash away my gloom (Love, love) or let me be lonely (Love) you better love me or let me be (Love, love) or let me be lonely (love) I could live without love If I wanted to in this lonely room But I don't want to So I leave it up to you To wash away my gloom I could live without love If I wanted to in this lonely room But I don't want to So I leave it up to you To wash away my gloom I could live I could live without your love But I don't want to So I leave it up to you To wash away my gloom Hey, whatcha gonna do I could live without love If I wanted to But it's up to you But I don't want to So I leave it up to you To wash away my gloom Well, I could live without love If I wanted to in this lonely room
