Paul Lavon Davis (April 21, 1948 – April 22, 2008) was an American singer and songwriter, best known for his radio hits and solo career that started worldwide in 1970. His career encompassed soul, country, and pop. His most successful songs are 1977’s “I Go Crazy”, a No. 7 pop hit that once held the record for the longest chart run on the Billboard Hot 100, and 1982’s “’65 Love Affair”, which at No. 6 is his highest-charting single. Another pop hit, “Cool Night”, was released in 1981. In the mid-1980s, he also had two No. 1 country hits as a guest vocalist on songs by Marie Osmond and Tanya Tucker.

Cool Night is the seventh and final studio album by singer/songwriter Paul Davis, released November 30, 1981. It was his highest-charting album in the United States, reaching #52 on the Billboard album chart, and yielded three top-40 singles, “Cool Night”, “’65 Love Affair”, and “Love or Let Me Be Lonely”.
