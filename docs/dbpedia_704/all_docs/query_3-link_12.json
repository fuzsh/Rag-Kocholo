        "text": "[Ancient Athens. Enter Duke Theseus, ruler of Athens; Hippolyta, his soon to be wife; Philostrate, a nobleman; and various attendants]\n\nTheseus\n\nNow, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour\n\nDraws on apace. Four happy days bring in\n\nAnother moon — but, Oh, methinks how slow\n\nThis old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,\n\nLike to a stepdame or a dowager\n\nLong withering out a young man’s revenue.\n\nHippolyta\n\nFour days will quickly steep themselves in night;\n\nFour nights will quickly dream away the time;\n\nAnd then the moon, like to a silver bow\n\nNew bent in heaven, shall behold the night\n\nOf our solemnities.\n\nTheseus\n\nGo, Philostrate,\n\nStir up the Athenian youth to merriments,\n\nAwake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth,\n\nTurn melancholy forth to funerals —\n\nThe pale companion is not for our pomp.\n\n[Exit Philostrate]\n\nHippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword,\n\nAnd won thy love doing thee injuries.\n\nBut I will wed thee in another key,\n\nWith pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.\n\n[Enter the nobleman Egeus, his daughter Hermia, her boyfriend Lysander, and another young nobleman Demetrius]\n\nEgeus\n\nHappy be Theseus, our renownèd duke.\n\nTheseus\n\nThanks, good Egeus. What's the news with thee?\n\nEgeus\n\nFull of vexation come I, with complaint\n\nAgainst my child, my daughter Hermia. –\n\nStand forth Demetrius. – And my noble lord,\n\nThis man hath my consent to marry her.\n\nStand forth Lysander. And, my gracious duke,\n\nThis man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.\n\nThou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,\n\nAnd interchanged love tokens with my child.\n\nThou hast by moonlight at her window sung\n\nWith feigning voice verses of feigning love,\n\nAnd stol’n the impression of her fantasy\n\nWith bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,\n\nKnacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats — messengers\n\nOf strong prevailment in unhardened youth.\n\nWith cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heart,\n\nTurned her obedience, which is due to me,\n\nTo stubborn harshness. And, my gracious duke,\n\nBe it so she will not, here before your grace,\n\nConsent to marry with Demetrius,\n\nI beg the ancient privilege of Athens:\n\nAs she is mine I may dispose of her –\n\nWhich shall be either to this gentleman\n\nOr to her death, according to our law\n\nImmediately provided in that case.\n\nTheseus\n\nWhat say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid,\n\nTo you your father should be as a god,\n\nOne that composed your beauties, yea, and one\n\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax,\n\nBy him imprinted and within his power\n\nTo leave the figure, or disfigure it.\n\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\n\nHermia\n\nSo is Lysander.\n\nTheseus\n\nIn himself he is,\n\nBut in this kind, wanting your father's voice,\n\nThe other must be held the worthier.\n\nHermia\n\nI would my father looked but with my eyes.\n\nTheseus\n\nRather, your eyes must with his judgment look.\n\nHermia\n\nI do entreat your grace to pardon me.\n\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\n\nNor how it may concern my modesty\n\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts,\n\nBut I beseech your grace that I may know\n\nThe worst that may befall me in this case\n\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.\n\nTheseus\n\nEither to die the death or to abjure\n\nFor ever the society of men.\n\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\n\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood;\n\nWhether, if you yield not to your father's choice,\n\nYou can endure the livery of a nun,\n\nFor aye to be in shady cloister mewed,\n\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\n\nChanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.\n\nThrice blessed they that master so their blood,\n\nTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage;\n\nBut earthlier happy is the rose distilled\n\nThan that which, withering on the virgin thorn,\n\nGrows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.\n\nHermia\n\nSo will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,\n\nEre I will yield my virgin patent up\n\nUnto his lordship, whose unwishèd yoke\n\nMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.\n\nTheseus\n\nTake time to pause, and by the next new moon —\n\nThe sealing day betwixt my love and me\n\nFor everlasting bond of fellowship —\n\nUpon that day either prepare to die\n\nFor disobedience to your father's will,\n\nOr else to wed Demetrius as he would,\n\nOr on Diana's altar to protest\n\nFor aye austerity and single life.\n\nDemetrius\n\nRelent, sweet Hermia; and Lysander, yield\n\nThy crazèd title to my certain right.\n\nLysander\n\nYou have her father's love, Demetrius,\n\nLet me have Hermia's. Do you marry him.\n\nEgeus\n\nScornful Lysander, true, he hath my love,\n\nAnd what is mine my love shall render him;\n\nAnd she is mine, and all my right of her\n\nI do estate unto Demetrius.\n\nLysander\n\n[To Theseus] I am, my lord, as well derived as he,\n\nAs well possessed. My love is more than his,\n\nMy fortunes every way as fairly ranked,\n\nIf not with vantage, as Demetrius'.\n\nAnd — which is more than all these boasts can be —\n\nI am beloved of beauteous Hermia.\n\nWhy should not I then prosecute my right?\n\nDemetrius — I'll avouch it to his head —\n\nMade love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,\n\nAnd won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,\n\nDevoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry\n\nUpon this spotted and inconstant man.\n\nTheseus\n\nI must confess that I have heard so much,\n\nAnd with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof,\n\nBut, being overfull of self-affairs,\n\nMy mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come,\n\nAnd come, Egeus; you shall go with me.\n\nI have some private schooling for you both.\n\nFor you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself\n\nTo fit your fancies to your father's will,\n\nOr else the law of Athens yields you up —\n\nWhich by no means we may extenuate —\n\nTo death or to a vow of single life.\n\nCome, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?\n\nDemetrius and Egeus, go along;\n\nI must employ you in some business\n\nAgainst our nuptial, and confer with you\n\nOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.\n\nEgeus\n\nWith duty and desire we follow you.\n\n[Exit all but Lysander and Hermia]\n\nLysander\n\nHow now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?\n\nHow chance the roses there do fade so fast?\n\nHermia\n\nBelike for want of rain, which I could well\n\nBeteem them from the tempest of my eyes.\n\nLysander\n\nAy me! For aught that I could ever read,\n\nCould ever hear by tale or history,\n\nThe course of true love never did run smooth,\n\nBut either it was different in blood —\n\nHermia\n\nO cross! Too high to be enthralled to low.\n\nLysander\n\nOr else misgrafted in respect of years —\n\nHermia\n\nO spite! Too old to be engaged to young.\n\nLysander\n\nOr merit stood upon the choice of friends —\n\nHermia\n\nO hell! To choose love by another's eyes.\n\nLysander\n\nOr if there were a sympathy in choice,\n\nWar, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,\n\nMaking it momentary as a sound,\n\nSwift as a shadow, short as any dream,\n\nBrief as the lightning in the collied night\n\nThat in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth,\n\nAnd ere a man hath power to say \"Behold!\"\n\nThe jaws of darkness do devour it up.\n\nSo quick bright things come to confusion.\n\nHermia\n\nIf then true lovers have been ever crossed,\n\nIt stands as an edict in destiny.\n\nThen let us teach our trial patience\n\nBecause it is a customary cross,\n\nAs due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,\n\nWishes and tears — poor fancy's followers.\n\nLysander\n\nA good persuasion, therefore hear me, Hermia.\n\nI have a widow aunt, a dowager\n\nOf great revenue, and she hath no child.\n\nFrom Athens is her house remote seven leagues,\n\nAnd she respects me as her only son.\n\nThere, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,\n\nAnd to that place the sharp Athenian law\n\nCannot pursue us. If thou lov’st me, then\n\nSteal forth thy father's house tomorrow night,\n\nAnd in the wood, a league without the town\n\nWhere I did meet thee once with Helena\n\nTo do observance to a morn of May,\n\nThere will I stay for thee.\n\nHermia\n\nMy good Lysander,\n\nI swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,\n\nBy his best arrow with the golden head,\n\nBy the simplicity of Venus' doves,\n\nBy that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,\n\nAnd by that fire which burned the Carthage queen\n\nWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,\n\nBy all the vows that ever men have broke –\n\n(In number more than ever women spoke) –\n\nIn that same place thou hast appointed me\n\nTomorrow truly will I meet with thee.\n\nLysander\n\nKeep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.\n\n[Enter Helena who was supposedly seduced by Demetrius at some earlier point in time, though Demetrius is now pursuing Hermia.]\n\nHermia\n\nGod speed, fair Helena. Whither away?\n\nHelena\n\nCall you me fair? That “fair” again unsay.\n\nDemetrius loves your fair, O happy fair!\n\nYour eyes are lodestars, and your tongue's sweet air\n\nMore tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear\n\nWhen wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\n\nSickness is catching. O, were favor so!\n\nYour words I catch, fair Hermia. Ere I go,\n\nMy ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,\n\nMy tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.\n\nWere the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\n\nThe rest I'd give to be to you translated.\n\nO, teach me how you look, and with what art\n\nYou sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.\n\nHermia\n\nI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\n\nHelena\n\nO that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!\n\nHermia\n\nI give him curses, yet he gives me love.\n\nHelena\n\nO that my prayers could such affection move!\n\nHermia\n\nThe more I hate, the more he follows me.\n\nHelena\n\nThe more I love, the more he hateth me.\n\nHermia\n\nHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\n\nHelena\n\nNone but your beauty; would that fault were mine!\n\nHermia\n\nTake comfort. He no more shall see my face.\n\nLysander and myself will fly this place.\n\nBefore the time I did Lysander see,\n\nSeemed Athens as a paradise to me.\n\nO, then, what graces in my love do dwell,\n\nThat he hath turned a heaven unto a hell?\n\nLysander\n\nHelen, to you our minds we will unfold.\n\nTomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold\n\nHer silver visage in the wat’ry glass\n\nDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass —\n\nA time that lovers' flights doth still conceal —\n\nThrough Athens' gates have we devised to steal.\n\nHermia\n\nAnd in the wood where often you and I\n\nUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,\n\nEmptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,\n\nThere my Lysander and myself shall meet,\n\nAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyes\n\nTo seek new friends and stranger companies.\n\nFarewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,\n\nAnd good luck grant thee thy Demetrius –\n\nKeep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight\n\nFrom lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.\n\nLysander\n\nI will, my Hermia.\n\n[Exit Hermia]\n\nHelena, adieu.\n\nAs you on him, Demetrius dote on you.\n\n[Exit Lysander]\n\nHelena\n\nHow happy some o'er other some can be!\n\nThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she,\n\nBut what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;\n\nHe will not know what all but he do know.\n\nAnd, as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,\n\nSo I, admiring of his qualities.\n\nThings base and vile, holding no quantity,\n\nLove can transpose to form and dignity.\n\nLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,\n\nAnd therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\n\nNor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;\n\nWings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.\n\nAnd therefore is Love said to be a child\n\nBecause in choice he is so oft beguiled.\n\nAs waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\n\nSo the boy Love is perjured everywhere.\n\nFor ere Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyne\n\nHe hailed down oaths that he was only mine,\n\nAnd when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\n\nSo he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.\n\nI will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight.\n\nThen to the wood will he tomorrow night\n\nPursue her. And for this intelligence\n\nIf I have thanks it is a dear expense.\n\nBut herein mean I to enrich my pain,\n\nTo have his sight thither and back again.\n\n[Exit Helena]"
