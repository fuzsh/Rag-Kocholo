        "text": "Scene 3\n\nSynopsis:\n\nDesdemona’s interview with Cassio is cut short by the arrival of Othello. Cassio leaves hastily in order to avoid speaking with Othello. Desdemona pleads to Othello on Cassio’s behalf. When she exits, Iago says that Cassio’s avoidance of Othello is suspicious and that Cassio may not be honorable, all the while insinuating that he, Iago, knows more than he is willing to say. He warns Othello against becoming jealous of Desdemona.\n\nWhen Desdemona enters and Othello complains of an aching head, Desdemona offers to bind his head with her handkerchief. As they exit, the handkerchief drops unnoticed by either of them. Emilia picks it up and gives it to Iago, who has often asked for it. Othello reenters and, now tormented by jealousy, threatens Iago with death unless he provides proof of Desdemona’s infidelity.\n\nIago alleges that Cassio one night talked in his sleep about making love to Desdemona and that Cassio once wiped his beard with the lost handkerchief. Othello is convinced by this “proof” and vows to kill Desdemona; Iago agrees to kill Cassio. Othello then appoints Iago to the lieutenancy.\n\nEnter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1604 Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do\n\n1605 All my abilities in thy behalf.\n\nEMILIA\n\n1606 Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband\n\n1607 As if the cause were his.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1608 5 O, that’s an honest fellow! Do not doubt, Cassio,\n\n1609 But I will have my lord and you again\n\n1610 As friendly as you were.\n\nCASSIO 1611 Bounteous madam,\n\n1612 Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,\n\n1613 10 He’s never anything but your true servant.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1614 I know ’t. I thank you. You do love my lord;\n\n1615 You have known him long; and be you well assured\n\n1616 He shall in strangeness stand no farther off\n\n1617 Than in a politic distance.\n\nCASSIO 1618 15 Ay, but, lady,\n\n1619 That policy may either last so long,\n\n1620 Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,\n\n1621 Or breed itself so out of ⟨circumstance,⟩\n\n1622 That, I being absent and my place supplied,\n\n1623 20 My general will forget my love and service.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1624 Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here,\n\n1625 I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,\n\n1626 If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it\n\n1627 To the last article. My lord shall never rest:\n\n1628 25 I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;\n\n1629 His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;\n\n1630 I’ll intermingle everything he does\n\n1631 With Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,\n\np. 119\n\n1632 For thy solicitor shall rather die\n\n1633 30 Than give thy cause away.\n\nEnter Othello and Iago.\n\nEMILIA 1634 Madam, here comes my lord.\n\nCASSIO 1635 Madam, I’ll take my leave.\n\nDESDEMONA 1636 Why, stay, and hear me speak.\n\nCASSIO\n\n1637 Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease,\n\n1638 35 Unfit for mine own purposes.\n\nDESDEMONA 1639 Well, do your discretion.Cassio exits.\n\nIAGO\n\n1640 Ha, I like not that.\n\nOTHELLO 1641 What dost thou say?\n\nIAGO\n\n1642 Nothing, my lord; or if—I know not what.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1643 40 Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?\n\nIAGO\n\n1644 Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it\n\n1645 That he would steal away so guiltylike,\n\n1646 Seeing your coming.\n\nOTHELLO 1647 I do believe ’twas he.\n\nDESDEMONA 1648 45How now, my lord?\n\n1649 I have been talking with a suitor here,\n\n1650 A man that languishes in your displeasure.\n\nOTHELLO 1651 Who is ’t you mean?\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1652 Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,\n\n1653 50 If I have any grace or power to move you,\n\n1654 His present reconciliation take;\n\n1655 For if he be not one that truly loves you,\n\n1656 That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,\n\n1657 I have no judgment in an honest face.\n\n1658 55 I prithee call him back.\n\nOTHELLO 1659 Went he hence now?\n\np. 121\n\nDESDEMONA 1660 ⟨Yes, faith,⟩ so humbled\n\n1661 That he hath left part of his grief with me\n\n1662 To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1663 60 Not now, sweet Desdemon. Some other time.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1664 But shall ’t be shortly?\n\nOTHELLO 1665 The sooner, sweet, for you.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1666 Shall ’t be tonight at supper?\n\nOTHELLO 1667 No, not tonight.\n\nDESDEMONA 1668 65Tomorrow dinner, then?\n\nOTHELLO 1669 I shall not dine at home;\n\n1670 I meet the captains at the citadel.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1671 Why then tomorrow night, ⟨or⟩ Tuesday morn,\n\n1672 On Tuesday noon or night; on Wednesday morn.\n\n1673 70 I prithee name the time, but let it not\n\n1674 Exceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent;\n\n1675 And yet his trespass, in our common reason—\n\n1676 Save that, they say, the wars must make example\n\n1677 Out of her best—is not almost a fault\n\n1678 75 T’ incur a private check. When shall he come?\n\n1679 Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul\n\n1680 What you would ask me that I should deny,\n\n1681 Or stand so mamm’ring on? What? Michael Cassio,\n\n1682 That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,\n\n1683 80 When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,\n\n1684 Hath ta’en your part—to have so much to do\n\n1685 To bring him in! ⟨By ’r Lady,⟩ I could do much—\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1686 Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;\n\n1687 I will deny thee nothing.\n\nDESDEMONA 1688 85Why, this is not a boon!\n\n1689 ’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,\n\n1690 Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,\n\np. 123\n\n1691 Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit\n\n1692 To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit\n\n1693 90 Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,\n\n1694 It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,\n\n1695 And fearful to be granted.\n\nOTHELLO 1696 I will deny thee nothing!\n\n1697 Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,\n\n1698 95 To leave me but a little to myself.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1699 Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1700 Farewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee straight.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1701 Emilia, come.—Be as your fancies teach you.\n\n1702 Whate’er you be, I am obedient.\n\n⟨Desdemona and Emilia⟩ exit.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1703 100 Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul\n\n1704 But I do love thee! And when I love thee not,\n\n1705 Chaos is come again.\n\nIAGO 1706 My noble lord—\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1707 What dost thou say, Iago?\n\nIAGO 1708 105 Did Michael Cassio,\n\n1709 When ⟨you⟩ wooed my lady, know of your love?\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1710 He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?\n\nIAGO\n\n1711 But for a satisfaction of my thought,\n\n1712 No further harm.\n\nOTHELLO 1713 110 Why of thy thought, Iago?\n\nIAGO\n\n1714 I did not think he had been acquainted with her.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1715 O yes, and went between us very oft.\n\nIAGO 1716 Indeed?\n\np. 125\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1717 Indeed? Ay, indeed! Discern’st thou aught in that?\n\n1718 115 Is he not honest?\n\nIAGO 1719 Honest, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO 1720 Honest—ay, honest.\n\nIAGO\n\n1721 My lord, for aught I know.\n\nOTHELLO 1722 What dost thou think?\n\nIAGO 1723 120Think, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1724 “Think, my lord?” ⟨By heaven,⟩ thou echo’st me\n\n1725 As if there were some monster in thy thought\n\n1726 Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean\n\n1727 something.\n\n1728 125 I heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,\n\n1729 When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?\n\n1730 And when I told thee he was of my counsel\n\n1731 ⟨In⟩ my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st\n\n1732 “Indeed?”\n\n1733 130 And didst contract and purse thy brow together\n\n1734 As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain\n\n1735 Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,\n\n1736 Show me thy thought.\n\nIAGO 1737 My lord, you know I love you.\n\nOTHELLO 1738 135I think thou dost;\n\n1739 And for I know thou ’rt full of love and honesty\n\n1740 And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them\n\n1741 breath,\n\n1742 Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more.\n\n1743 140 For such things in a false, disloyal knave\n\n1744 Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,\n\n1745 They’re close dilations working from the heart\n\n1746 That passion cannot rule.\n\nIAGO 1747 For Michael Cassio,\n\n1748 145 I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1749 I think so too.\n\np. 127\n\nIAGO 1750 Men should be what they seem;\n\n1751 Or those that be not, would they might seem none!\n\nOTHELLO 1752 Certain, men should be what they seem.\n\nIAGO\n\n1753 150 Why then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.\n\nOTHELLO 1754 Nay, yet there’s more in this.\n\n1755 I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,\n\n1756 As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of\n\n1757 thoughts\n\n1758 155 The worst of words.\n\nIAGO 1759 Good my lord, pardon me.\n\n1760 Though I am bound to every act of duty,\n\n1761 I am not bound to ⟨that all slaves are free to.⟩\n\n1762 Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and\n\n1763 160 false—\n\n1764 As where’s that palace whereinto foul things\n\n1765 Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so\n\n1766 pure\n\n1767 ⟨But some⟩ uncleanly apprehensions\n\n1768 165 Keep leets and law days and in sessions sit\n\n1769 With meditations lawful?\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1770 Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,\n\n1771 If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear\n\n1772 A stranger to thy thoughts.\n\nIAGO 1773 170 I do beseech you,\n\n1774 Though I perchance am vicious in my guess—\n\n1775 As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague\n\n1776 To spy into abuses, and ⟨oft⟩ my jealousy\n\n1777 Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom\n\n1778 175 From one that so imperfectly conceits\n\n1779 Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble\n\n1780 Out of his scattering and unsure observance.\n\n1781 It were not for your quiet nor your good,\n\n1782 Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,\n\n1783 180 To let you know my thoughts.\n\np. 129\n\nOTHELLO 1784 What dost thou mean?\n\nIAGO\n\n1785 Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,\n\n1786 Is the immediate jewel of their souls.\n\n1787 Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something,\n\n1788 185 nothing;\n\n1789 ’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to\n\n1790 thousands.\n\n1791 But he that filches from me my good name\n\n1792 Robs me of that which not enriches him\n\n1793 190 And makes me poor indeed.\n\nOTHELLO 1794 ⟨By heaven,⟩ I’ll know thy thoughts.\n\nIAGO\n\n1795 You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,\n\n1796 Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1797 Ha?\n\nIAGO 1798 195 O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!\n\n1799 It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock\n\n1800 The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss\n\n1801 Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;\n\n1802 But O, what damnèd minutes tells he o’er\n\n1803 200 Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet ⟨strongly⟩ loves!\n\nOTHELLO 1804 O misery!\n\nIAGO\n\n1805 Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;\n\n1806 But riches fineless is as poor as winter\n\n1807 To him that ever fears he shall be poor.\n\n1808 205 Good ⟨God,⟩ the souls of all my tribe defend\n\n1809 From jealousy!\n\nOTHELLO 1810 Why, why is this?\n\n1811 Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,\n\n1812 To follow still the changes of the moon\n\n1813 210 With fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt\n\n1814 Is ⟨once⟩ to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat\n\n1815 When I shall turn the business of my soul\n\np. 131\n\n1816 To such exsufflicate and ⟨blown⟩ surmises,\n\n1817 Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous\n\n1818 215 To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,\n\n1819 Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances ⟨well.⟩\n\n1820 Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.\n\n1821 Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw\n\n1822 The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,\n\n1823 220 For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,\n\n1824 I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;\n\n1825 And on the proof, there is no more but this:\n\n1826 Away at once with love or jealousy.\n\nIAGO\n\n1827 I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason\n\n1828 225 To show the love and duty that I bear you\n\n1829 With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,\n\n1830 Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.\n\n1831 Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;\n\n1832 Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.\n\n1833 230 I would not have your free and noble nature,\n\n1834 Out of self-bounty, be abused. Look to ’t.\n\n1835 I know our country disposition well.\n\n1836 In Venice they do let ⟨God⟩ see the pranks\n\n1837 They dare not show their husbands. Their best\n\n1838 235 conscience\n\n1839 Is not to leave ’t undone, but ⌜keep ’t⌝ unknown.\n\nOTHELLO 1840 Dost thou say so?\n\nIAGO\n\n1841 She did deceive her father, marrying you,\n\n1842 And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,\n\n1843 240 She loved them most.\n\nOTHELLO 1844 And so she did.\n\nIAGO 1845 Why, go to, then!\n\n1846 She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,\n\n1847 To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak,\n\n1848 245 He thought ’twas witchcraft! But I am much to\n\n1849 blame.\n\np. 133\n\n1850 I humbly do beseech you of your pardon\n\n1851 For too much loving you.\n\nOTHELLO 1852 I am bound to thee forever.\n\nIAGO\n\n1853 250 I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1854 Not a jot, not a jot.\n\nIAGO 1855 ⟨I’ faith,⟩ I fear it has.\n\n1856 I hope you will consider what is spoke\n\n1857 Comes from ⟨my⟩ love. But I do see you’re moved.\n\n1858 255 I am to pray you not to strain my speech\n\n1859 To grosser issues nor to larger reach\n\n1860 Than to suspicion.\n\nOTHELLO 1861 I will not.\n\nIAGO 1862 Should you do so, my lord,\n\n1863 260 My speech should fall into such vile success\n\n1864 ⟨As my thoughts aim not at.⟩ Cassio’s my worthy\n\n1865 friend.\n\n1866 My lord, I see you’re moved.\n\nOTHELLO 1867 No, not much moved.\n\n1868 265 I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.\n\nIAGO\n\n1869 Long live she so! And long live you to think so!\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1870 And yet, how nature erring from itself—\n\nIAGO\n\n1871 Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you,\n\n1872 Not to affect many proposèd matches\n\n1873 270 Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,\n\n1874 Whereto we see in all things nature tends—\n\n1875 Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank,\n\n1876 Foul ⟨disproportion,⟩ thoughts unnatural—\n\n1877 But pardon me—I do not in position\n\n1878 275 Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear\n\n1879 Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,\n\n1880 May fall to match you with her country forms\n\n1881 And happily repent.\n\np. 135\n\nOTHELLO 1882 Farewell, farewell!\n\n1883 280 If more thou dost perceive, let me know more.\n\n1884 Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.\n\nIAGO, ⌜beginning to exit⌝ 1885 My lord, I take my leave.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1886 Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless\n\n1887 Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.\n\nIAGO, ⌜returning⌝\n\n1888 285 My lord, I would I might entreat your Honor\n\n1889 To scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time.\n\n1890 Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place—\n\n1891 For sure he fills it up with great ability—\n\n1892 Yet, if you please to ⟨hold⟩ him off awhile,\n\n1893 290 You shall by that perceive him and his means.\n\n1894 Note if your lady strain his entertainment\n\n1895 With any strong or vehement importunity.\n\n1896 Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,\n\n1897 Let me be thought too busy in my fears—\n\n1898 295 As worthy cause I have to fear I am—\n\n1899 And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor.\n\nOTHELLO 1900 Fear not my government.\n\nIAGO 1901 I once more take my leave.He exits.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1902 This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,\n\n1903 300 And knows all ⟨qualities⟩ with a learnèd spirit\n\n1904 Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,\n\n1905 Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,\n\n1906 I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind\n\n1907 To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black\n\n1908 305 And have not those soft parts of conversation\n\n1909 That chamberers have, or for I am declined\n\n1910 Into the vale of years—yet that’s not much—\n\n1911 She’s gone, I am abused, and my relief\n\n1912 Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,\n\n1913 310 That we can call these delicate creatures ours\n\n1914 And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad\n\np. 137\n\n1915 And live upon the vapor of a dungeon\n\n1916 Than keep a corner in the thing I love\n\n1917 For others’ uses. Yet ’tis the plague ⟨of⟩ great ones;\n\n1918 315 Prerogatived are they less than the base.\n\n1919 ’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.\n\n1920 Even then this forkèd plague is fated to us\n\n1921 When we do quicken. Look where she comes.\n\nEnter Desdemona and Emilia.\n\n1922 If she be false, heaven ⟨mocks⟩ itself!\n\n1923 320 I’ll not believe ’t.\n\nDESDEMONA 1924 How now, my dear Othello?\n\n1925 Your dinner, and the generous islanders\n\n1926 By you invited, do attend your presence.\n\nOTHELLO 1927 I am to blame.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1928 325 Why do you speak so faintly? Are you not well?\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1929 I have a pain upon my forehead, here.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1930 ⟨Faith,⟩ that’s with watching. ’Twill away again.\n\n1931 Let me but bind it hard; within this hour\n\n1932 It will be well.\n\nOTHELLO 1933 330 Your napkin is too little.\n\n1934 Let it alone.⌜The handkerchief falls, unnoticed.⌝\n\n1935 Come, I’ll go in with you.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\n1936 I am very sorry that you are not well.\n\n⟨Othello and Desdemona⟩ exit.\n\nEMILIA, ⌜picking up the handkerchief⌝\n\n1937 I am glad I have found this napkin.\n\n1938 335 This was her first remembrance from the Moor.\n\n1939 My wayward husband hath a hundred times\n\n1940 Wooed me to steal it. But she so loves the token\n\n1941 (For he conjured her she should ever keep it)\n\n1942 That she reserves it evermore about her\n\np. 139\n\n1943 340 To kiss and talk to. I’ll have the work ta’en out\n\n1944 And give ’t Iago. What he will do with it\n\n1945 Heaven knows, not I.\n\n1946 I nothing but to please his fantasy.\n\nEnter Iago.\n\nIAGO 1947 How now? What do you here alone?\n\nEMILIA\n\n1948 345 Do not you chide. I have a thing for you.\n\nIAGO\n\n1949 You have a thing for me? It is a common thing—\n\nEMILIA 1950 Ha?\n\nIAGO 1951 To have a foolish wife.\n\nEMILIA\n\n1952 O, is that all? What will you give me now\n\n1953 350 For that same handkerchief?\n\nIAGO 1954 What handkerchief?\n\nEMILIA 1955 What handkerchief?\n\n1956 Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,\n\n1957 That which so often you did bid me steal.\n\nIAGO 1958 355Hast stol’n it from her?\n\nEMILIA\n\n1959 No, ⟨faith,⟩ she let it drop by negligence,\n\n1960 And to th’ advantage I, being here, took ’t up.\n\n1961 Look, here ’tis.\n\nIAGO 1962 A good wench! Give it me.\n\nEMILIA\n\n1963 360 What will you do with ’t, that you have been so\n\n1964 earnest\n\n1965 To have me filch it?\n\nIAGO, ⌜snatching it⌝ 1966 Why, what is that to you?\n\nEMILIA\n\n1967 If it be not for some purpose of import,\n\n1968 365 Give ’t me again. Poor lady, she’ll run mad\n\n1969 When she shall lack it.\n\np. 141\n\nIAGO 1970 Be not acknown on ’t.\n\n1971 I have use for it. Go, leave me.Emilia exits.\n\n1972 I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin\n\n1973 370 And let him find it. Trifles light as air\n\n1974 Are to the jealous confirmations strong\n\n1975 As proofs of holy writ. This may do something.\n\n1976 [The Moor already changes with my poison;]\n\n1977 Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,\n\n1978 375 Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,\n\n1979 But with a little act upon the blood\n\n1980 Burn like the mines of sulfur.\n\nEnter Othello.\n\n1981 I did say so.\n\n1982 Look where he comes. Not poppy nor mandragora\n\n1983 380 Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world\n\n1984 Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\n\n1985 Which thou owedst yesterday.\n\nOTHELLO 1986 Ha, ha, false to me?\n\nIAGO\n\n1987 Why, how now, general? No more of that!\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1988 385 Avaunt! Begone! Thou hast set me on the rack.\n\n1989 I swear ’tis better to be much abused\n\n1990 Than but to know ’t a little.\n\nIAGO 1991 How now, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO\n\n1992 What sense had I ⟨of⟩ her stol’n hours of lust?\n\n1993 390 I saw ’t not, thought it not; it harmed not me.\n\n1994 I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and\n\n1995 merry.\n\n1996 I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.\n\n1997 He that is robbed, not wanting what is stol’n,\n\n1998 395 Let him not know ’t, and he’s not robbed at all.\n\nIAGO 1999 I am sorry to hear this.\n\np. 143\n\nOTHELLO\n\n2000 I had been happy if the general camp,\n\n2001 Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,\n\n2002 So I had nothing known. O, now, forever\n\n2003 400 Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!\n\n2004 Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars\n\n2005 That makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!\n\n2006 Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,\n\n2007 The spirit-stirring drum, th’ ear-piercing fife,\n\n2008 405 The royal banner, and all quality,\n\n2009 Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!\n\n2010 And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats\n\n2011 Th’ immortal Jove’s dread clamors counterfeit,\n\n2012 Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone!\n\nIAGO 2013 410Is ’t possible, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO\n\n2014 Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore!\n\n2015 Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,\n\n2016 Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul,\n\n2017 Thou hadst been better have been born a dog\n\n2018 415 Than answer my waked wrath.\n\nIAGO 2019 Is ’t come to this?\n\nOTHELLO\n\n2020 Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it\n\n2021 That the probation bear no hinge nor loop\n\n2022 To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!\n\nIAGO 2023 420My noble lord—\n\nOTHELLO\n\n2024 If thou dost slander her and torture me,\n\n2025 Never pray more. Abandon all remorse;\n\n2026 On horror’s head horrors accumulate;\n\n2027 Do deeds to make heaven weep, all Earth amazed;\n\n2028 425 For nothing canst thou to damnation add\n\n2029 Greater than that.\n\nIAGO 2030 O grace! O heaven forgive me!\n\n2031 Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense?\n\np. 145\n\n2032 God b’ wi’ you. Take mine office.—O wretched fool,\n\n2033 430 That ⟨liv’st⟩ to make thine honesty a vice!—\n\n2034 O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world:\n\n2035 To be direct and honest is not safe.—\n\n2036 I thank you for this profit, and from hence\n\n2037 I’ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offense.\n\nOTHELLO 2038 435Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.\n\nIAGO\n\n2039 I should be wise; for honesty’s a fool\n\n2040 And loses that it works for.\n\n[OTHELLO 2041 By the world,\n\n2042 I think my wife be honest and think she is not.\n\n2043 440 I think that thou art just and think thou art not.\n\n2044 I’ll have some proof! ⌜Her⌝ name, that was as fresh\n\n2045 As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black\n\n2046 As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,\n\n2047 Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,\n\n2048 445 I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!]\n\nIAGO\n\n2049 I see you are eaten up with passion.\n\n2050 I do repent me that I put it to you.\n\n2051 You would be satisfied?\n\nOTHELLO 2052 Would? Nay, and I will.\n\nIAGO\n\n2053 450 And may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?\n\n2054 Would you, the ⟨supervisor,⟩ grossly gape on,\n\n2055 Behold her topped?\n\nOTHELLO 2056 Death and damnation! O!\n\nIAGO\n\n2057 It were a tedious difficulty, I think,\n\n2058 455 To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then\n\n2059 If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster\n\n2060 More than their own! What then? How then?\n\n2061 What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction?\n\n2062 It is impossible you should see this,\n\n2063 460 Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,\n\np. 147\n\n2064 As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross\n\n2065 As ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,\n\n2066 If imputation and strong circumstances\n\n2067 Which lead directly to the door of truth\n\n2068 465 Will give you satisfaction, you might have ’t.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n2069 Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.\n\nIAGO 2070 I do not like the office,\n\n2071 But sith I am entered in this cause so far,\n\n2072 Pricked to ’t by foolish honesty and love,\n\n2073 470 I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,\n\n2074 And being troubled with a raging tooth\n\n2075 I could not sleep. There are a kind of men\n\n2076 So loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter\n\n2077 Their affairs. One of this kind is Cassio.\n\n2078 475 In sleep I heard him say “Sweet Desdemona,\n\n2079 Let us be wary, let us hide our loves.”\n\n2080 And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,\n\n2081 Cry “O sweet creature!” then kiss me hard,\n\n2082 As if he plucked up kisses by the roots\n\n2083 480 That grew upon my lips; ⟨then⟩ laid his leg\n\n2084 O’er my thigh, and ⟨sighed,⟩ and ⟨kissed,⟩ and then\n\n2085 ⟨Cried⟩ “Cursèd fate that gave thee to the Moor!”\n\nOTHELLO\n\n2086 O monstrous! Monstrous!\n\nIAGO 2087 Nay, this was but his\n\n2088 485 dream.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n2089 But this denoted a foregone conclusion.\n\n2090 ’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.\n\nIAGO\n\n2091 And this may help to thicken other proofs\n\n2092 That do demonstrate thinly.\n\nOTHELLO 2093 490I’ll tear her all to pieces.\n\nIAGO\n\n2094 Nay, ⟨but⟩ be wise. Yet we see nothing done.\n\np. 149\n\n2095 She may be honest yet. Tell me but this:\n\n2096 Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief\n\n2097 Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?\n\nOTHELLO\n\n2098 495 I gave her such a one. ’Twas my first gift.\n\nIAGO\n\n2099 I know not that; but such a handkerchief—\n\n2100 I am sure it was your wife’s—did I today\n\n2101 See Cassio wipe his beard with.\n\nOTHELLO 2102 If it be that—\n\nIAGO\n\n2103 500 If it be that, or any ⌜that⌝ was hers,\n\n2104 It speaks against her with the other proofs.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n2105 O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!\n\n2106 One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.\n\n2107 Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago,\n\n2108 505 All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.\n\n2109 ’Tis gone.\n\n2110 Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!\n\n2111 Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne\n\n2112 To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,\n\n2113 510 For ’tis of aspics’ tongues!\n\nIAGO 2114 Yet be content.\n\nOTHELLO 2115 O, blood, blood, blood!\n\nIAGO\n\n2116 Patience, I say. Your mind ⟨perhaps⟩ may change.\n\nOTHELLO\n\n2117 Never, [Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,\n\n2118 515 Whose icy current and compulsive course\n\n2119 Ne’er ⌜feels⌝ retiring ebb, but keeps due on\n\n2120 To the Propontic and the Hellespont,\n\n2121 Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace\n\n2122 Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,\n\n2123 520 Till that a capable and wide revenge\n\n2124 Swallow them up. ⟨He kneels.⟩ Now by yond marble\n\n2125 heaven,]\n\np. 151\n\n2126 In the due reverence of a sacred vow,\n\n2127 I here engage my words.\n\nIAGO 2128 525 Do not rise yet.⟨Iago kneels.⟩\n\n2129 Witness, you ever-burning lights above,\n\n2130 You elements that clip us round about,\n\n2131 Witness that here Iago doth give up\n\n2132 The execution of his wit, hands, heart\n\n2133 530 To wronged Othello’s service! Let him command,\n\n2134 And to obey shall be in me remorse,\n\n2135 What bloody business ever.⌜They rise.⌝\n\nOTHELLO 2136 I greet thy love\n\n2137 Not with vain thanks but with acceptance\n\n2138 535 bounteous,\n\n2139 And will upon the instant put thee to ’t.\n\n2140 Within these three days let me hear thee say\n\n2141 That Cassio’s not alive.\n\nIAGO 2142 My friend is dead.\n\n2143 540 ’Tis done at your request. But let her live.\n\nOTHELLO 2144 Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn\n\n2145 her!\n\n2146 Come, go with me apart. I will withdraw\n\n2147 To furnish me with some swift means of death\n\n2148 545 For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.\n\nIAGO 2149 I am your own forever.\n\nThey exit."
