Robin, thinking he has found “the Athenian man,” anoints the eyes of the sleeping Lysander and exits. Demetrius and Helena arrive, and he leaves her behind. Lysander awakes, sees Helena, and immediately falls in love with her. She mistakes his courtship for mockery and tries to elude him. After they exit, the abandoned Hermia awakes from a nightmare and goes in search of her beloved Lysander.\n\nEnter Titania, Queen of Fairies, with her train.\n\nTITANIA\n\n0641 Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;\n\n0642 Then, for the third part of a minute, hence—\n\n0643 Some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds,\n\n0644 Some war with reremice for their leathern wings\n\n0645 5 To make my small elves coats, and some keep back\n\n0646 The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders\n\n0647 At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep.\n\n0648 Then to your offices and let me rest.⌜She lies down.⌝\n\nFairies sing.\n\n⌜FIRST FAIRY⌝\n\n0649 You spotted snakes with double tongue,\n\n0650 10 Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen.\n\n0651 Newts and blindworms, do no wrong,\n\n0652 Come not near our Fairy Queen.\n\n⌜CHORUS⌝\n\n0653 Philomel, with melody\n\n0654 Sing in our sweet lullaby.\n\np. 55\n\n0655 15 Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby.\n\n0656 Never harm\n\n0657 Nor spell nor charm\n\n0658 Come our lovely lady nigh.\n\n0659 So good night, with lullaby.\n\nFIRST FAIRY\n\n0660 20 Weaving spiders, come not here.\n\n0661 Hence, you long-legged spinners, hence.\n\n0662 Beetles black, approach not near.\n\n0663 Worm nor snail, do no offence.\n\n⌜CHORUS⌝\n\n0664 Philomel, with melody\n\n0665 25 Sing in our sweet lullaby.\n\n0666 Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby.\n\n0667 Never harm\n\n0668 Nor spell nor charm\n\n0669 Come our lovely lady nigh.\n\n0670 30 So good night, with lullaby.\n\n⌜Titania sleeps.⌝\n\nSECOND FAIRY\n\n0671 Hence, away! Now all is well.\n\n0672 One aloof stand sentinel. ⌜Fairies exit.⌝\n\nEnter Oberon, ⌜who anoints Titania’s eyelids with the\n\nnectar.⌝\n\nOBERON\n\n0673 What thou seest when thou dost wake\n\n0674 Do it for thy true love take.\n\n0675 35 Love and languish for his sake.\n\n0676 Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,\n\n0677 Pard, or boar with bristled hair,\n\n0678 In thy eye that shall appear\n\n0679 When thou wak’st, it is thy dear.\n\n0680 40 Wake when some vile thing is near.⌜He exits.⌝\n\nEnter Lysander and Hermia.\n\np. 57\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0681 Fair love, you faint with wand’ring in the wood.\n\n0682 And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way.\n\n0683 We’ll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,\n\n0684 And tarry for the comfort of the day.\n\nHERMIA\n\n0685 45⌜Be⌝ it so, Lysander. Find you out a bed,\n\n0686 For I upon this bank will rest my head.\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0687 One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;\n\n0688 One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.\n\nHERMIA\n\n0689 Nay, good Lysander. For my sake, my dear,\n\n0690 50 Lie further off yet. Do not lie so near.\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0691 O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!\n\n0692 Love takes the meaning in love’s conference.\n\n0693 I mean that my heart unto yours ⌜is⌝ knit,\n\n0694 So that but one heart we can make of it;\n\n0695 55 Two bosoms interchainèd with an oath—\n\n0696 So then two bosoms and a single troth.\n\n0697 Then by your side no bed-room me deny,\n\n0698 For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.\n\nHERMIA\n\n0699 Lysander riddles very prettily.\n\n0700 60 Now much beshrew my manners and my pride\n\n0701 If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.\n\n0702 But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy,\n\n0703 Lie further off in human modesty.\n\n0704 Such separation, as may well be said,\n\n0705 65 Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid.\n\n0706 So far be distant; and good night, sweet friend.\n\n0707 Thy love ne’er alter till thy sweet life end!\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0708 “Amen, amen” to that fair prayer, say I,\n\n0709 And then end life when I end loyalty!\n\n0710 70 Here is my bed. Sleep give thee all his rest!\n\np. 59\n\nHERMIA\n\n0711 With half that wish the wisher’s eyes be pressed!\n\n⌜They sleep.⌝\n\nEnter ⌜Robin.⌝\n\nROBIN\n\n0712 Through the forest have I gone,\n\n0713 But Athenian found I none\n\n0714 On whose eyes I might approve\n\n0715 75 This flower’s force in stirring love.\n\n⌜He sees Lysander.⌝\n\n0716 Night and silence! Who is here?\n\n0717 Weeds of Athens he doth wear.\n\n0718 This is he my master said\n\n0719 Despisèd the Athenian maid.\n\n0720 80 And here the maiden, sleeping sound\n\n0721 On the dank and dirty ground.\n\n0722 Pretty soul, she durst not lie\n\n0723 Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.—\n\n0724 Churl, upon thy eyes I throw\n\n0725 85 All the power this charm doth owe.\n\n⌜He anoints Lysander’s eyelids\n\nwith the nectar.⌝\n\n0726 When thou wak’st, let love forbid\n\n0727 Sleep his seat on thy eyelid.\n\n0728 So, awake when I am gone,\n\n0729 For I must now to Oberon.He exits.\n\nEnter Demetrius and Helena, running.\n\nHELENA\n\n0730 90 Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.\n\nDEMETRIUS\n\n0731 I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.\n\nHELENA\n\n0732 O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so.\n\np. 61\n\nDEMETRIUS\n\n0733 Stay, on thy peril. I alone will go.⌜Demetrius exits.⌝\n\nHELENA\n\n0734 O, I am out of breath in this fond chase.\n\n0735 95 The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.\n\n0736 Happy is Hermia, wheresoe’er she lies,\n\n0737 For she hath blessèd and attractive eyes.\n\n0738 How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears.\n\n0739 If so, my eyes are oftener washed than hers.\n\n0740 100 No, no, I am as ugly as a bear,\n\n0741 For beasts that meet me run away for fear.\n\n0742 Therefore no marvel though Demetrius\n\n0743 Do as a monster fly my presence thus.\n\n0744 What wicked and dissembling glass of mine\n\n0745 105 Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne?\n\n0746 But who is here? Lysander, on the ground!\n\n0747 Dead or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.—\n\n0748 Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.\n\nLYSANDER, ⌜waking up⌝\n\n0749 And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.\n\n0750 110 Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,\n\n0751 That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.\n\n0752 Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word\n\n0753 Is that vile name to perish on my sword!\n\nHELENA\n\n0754 Do not say so. Lysander, say not so.\n\n0755 115 What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what\n\n0756 though?\n\n0757 Yet Hermia still loves you. Then be content.\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0758 Content with Hermia? No, I do repent\n\n0759 The tedious minutes I with her have spent.\n\n0760 120 Not Hermia, but Helena I love.\n\n0761 Who will not change a raven for a dove?\n\n0762 The will of man is by his reason swayed,\n\n0763 And reason says you are the worthier maid.\n\np. 63\n\n0764 Things growing are not ripe until their season;\n\n0765 125 So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason.\n\n0766 And touching now the point of human skill,\n\n0767 Reason becomes the marshal to my will\n\n0768 And leads me to your eyes, where I o’erlook\n\n0769 Love’s stories written in love’s richest book.\n\nHELENA\n\n0770 130 Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?\n\n0771 When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?\n\n0772 Is ’t not enough, is ’t not enough, young man,\n\n0773 That I did never, no, nor never can\n\n0774 Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius’ eye,\n\n0775 135 But you must flout my insufficiency?\n\n0776 Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,\n\n0777 In such disdainful manner me to woo.\n\n0778 But fare you well. Perforce I must confess\n\n0779 I thought you lord of more true gentleness.\n\n0780 140 O, that a lady of one man refused\n\n0781 Should of another therefore be abused!She exits.\n\nLYSANDER\n\n0782 She sees not Hermia.—Hermia, sleep thou there,\n\n0783 And never mayst thou come Lysander near.\n\n0784 For, as a surfeit of the sweetest things\n\n0785 145 The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,\n\n0786 Or as the heresies that men do leave\n\n0787 Are hated most of those they did deceive,\n\n0788 So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,\n\n0789 Of all be hated, but the most of me!\n\n0790 150 And, all my powers, address your love and might\n\n0791 To honor Helen and to be her knight.He exits.\n\nHERMIA, ⌜waking up⌝\n\n0792 Help me, Lysander, help me! Do thy best\n\n0793 To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.\n\n0794 Ay me, for pity! What a dream was here!\n\n0795 155 Lysander, look how I do quake with fear.\n\n0796 Methought a serpent ate my heart away,\n\np. 65\n\n0797 And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.\n\n0798 Lysander! What, removed? Lysander, lord!\n\n0799 What, out of hearing? Gone? No sound, no word?\n\n0800 160 Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear.\n\n0801 Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.—\n\n0802 No? Then I well perceive you are not nigh.\n\n0803 Either death or you I’ll find immediately.\n\nShe exits."
