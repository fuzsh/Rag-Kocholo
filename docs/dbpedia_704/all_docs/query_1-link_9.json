        "text": "In total, it is believed that Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets, in addition to the thirty-seven plays attributed to him. Many believe Shakespeare’s sonnets are addressed to two different people he may have known.\n\nThe first 126 sonnets seem to speak to a young man with whom Shakespeare was very close. As a result, much has been speculated about The Bard’s sexuality; it is to this young man that Sonnet 116 is addressed. Shakespeare’s other sonnets are written to a mysterious woman whose identity is unknown. Scholars have referred to her simply as the Dark Woman, and must, have been written about her identity.\n\nSonnet 116 William Shakespeare\n\nLet me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark, That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved.\n\nSummary\n\nIn ‘Sonnet 116: Let me not to the marriage of true minds,’ Shakespeare’s speaker is ruminating on love. He says that love never changes, and if it does, it was not true or real in the first place.\n\nHe compares love to a star that is always seen and never changing. It is real and permanent, and it is something on which a person can count. Even though the people in love may change as time passes, their love will not. The speaker closes by saying that no man has ever truly loved before if he is wrong about this.\n\nThemes\n\nShakespeare used some of his most familiar themes in ‘Sonnet 116’. These include time, love, and the nature of relationships. In the fourteen lines of this sonnet, he delves into what true love is and whether or not it’s real. He uses a metaphor to compare love to a star that’s always present and never changes. He is so confident in this opinion that he asserts no man has ever loved before if he’s wrong. Shakespeare also brings elements of time into the poem. He emphasizes that time knows no boundaries, and even if the people in the relationship change, the love doesn’t.\n\nHistorical Background\n\nMany believe the mysterious young man for whom this and many other of Shakespeare’s sonnets were written was the Earl of Southampton, Henry Wriothesly. Wriothesly was Shakespeare’s patron, and The Bard’s Venus, Adonis, and Tarquin and Lucrece were dedicated to the young man.\n\nStructure and Form\n\nThis is a true Shakespearean sonnet, also called an Elizabethan or English sonnet. This type of sonnet contains fourteen lines, separated into three quatrains (four lines) and ending with a rhyming couplet (two lines). The rhyme scheme of this sonnet is abab cdcd efef gg. Like most of Shakespeare’s works, this sonnet is written in iambic pentameter, which means each line consists of ten syllables. Within those ten syllables, there are five pairs, which are called iambs (one stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable).\n\nLiterary Devices\n\nShakespeare uses several literary devices in ‘Sonnet 116,’ which include but are not limited to alliteration, examples of caesurae, and personification. The first, alliteration, is concerned with the repetition of words that begin with the same consonant sound. For example, “marriage” and “minds” in the first line, and “remover” and “remove” are in the fourth line.\n\nCaeusrae is used when the poet wants to create a pause in the middle of a line. The second line of the poem is a good example. It reads: “Admit impediments. Love is not love”. There is another example in line eight. It reads: “Whose worth’s unknown, although his height is taken.” The “pause” the poet uses might be marked with punctuation or intuited through the metrical pattern.\n\nPersonification is seen in the final sestet of the poem. There, Shakespeare personifies “Time” and “Love,” something that he does more than once in his 154 sonnets. He refers to them as forces that have the ability to change lives purposefully.\n\nDetailed Analysis\n\nWhile this sonnet is clumped in with the other sonnets that are assumed to be dedicated to an unknown young man in Shakespeare’s life, this poem does not seem to directly address anyone. In fact, Sonnet 116 seems to be the speaker’s—in this case, perhaps Shakespeare—ruminations on love and what it is. The best way to analyze Shakespeare’s sonnets is to examine them line-by-line, which is what will follow.\n\nLines 1-2\n\nIn the first two lines, Shakespeare writes,\n\nLet me not to the marriage of true minds\n\nAdmit impediments.\n\nThese lines are perhaps the most famous in the history of poetry, regardless of whether or not one recognizes them as belonging to Shakespeare. Straight away, Shakespeare uses the metaphor of marriage to compare it to true, real love.\n\nHe is saying there is no reason why two people who truly love should not be together; nothing should stand in their way. Perhaps he is speaking about his feelings for the unknown young man for whom the sonnet is written.\n\nShakespeare was unhappily married to Anne Hathaway, and so perhaps he was rationalizing his feelings for the young man by stating there was no reason, even if one is already married, that two people who are truly in love should not be together.\n\nLines 3-4\n\nThe second half of the second line begins a new thought, which is then carried on into the third and fourth lines. He writes,\n\nLove is not love\n\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,\n\nOr bends with the remover to remove.\n\nShakespeare is continuing with his thought that true love conquers all. In these lines, the speaker tells the reader that if love changes, it is not truly loved because if it changes or someone tries to “remove” it, nothing will change it. Love does not stop just because something is altered. As clichéd as it sounds, true love, real love, lasts forever.\n\nThe second quatrain of Sonnet 116 begins with some vivid and beautiful imagery, and it continues with the final thought pondered in the first quatrain.\n\nLines 5-6\n\nNow that Shakespeare has established what love is not—fleeting and ever-changing—he can now tell us what love is. He writes,\n\nO no, it is an ever fixed mark\n\nThat looks on tempests and is never shaken…\n\nHere, Shakespeare tells his readers that love does not shift, change, or move; it is constant and in the same place, and it can weather even the most harrowing of storms or tempests and is never even shaken, let alone defeated. While weak, it can be argued here that Shakespeare decides to personify love since it is something that is intangible and not something that can be defeated by something tangible, such as a storm.\n\nLines 7-8\n\nIn the next line, Shakespeare uses the metaphor of the North Star to discuss love. He writes,\n\nIt is the star to every wand’ring bark,\n\nWhose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken.\n\nTo Shakespeare, love is the star that guides every bark or ship on the water, and while it is priceless, it can be measured. These two lines are interesting and worth noting. Shakespeare concedes that love’s worth is not known, but he says it can be measured. He neglects to tell his reader, but perhaps he is assuming the reader will understand the different ways one can measure love: through time and actions. With that thought, the second quatrain ends.\n\nLines 9-10\n\nThe third quatrain parallels the first, and Shakespeare returns to telling his readers what love is not. He writes,\n\nLove’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks\n\nWithin his bending sickle’s compass come…\n\nNotice the capitalization of the word “Time.” Shakespeare is personifying time as a person, specifically, Death. He says that love is not the fool of time. One’s rosy lips and cheeks will certainly pale with age as “his bending sickle’s compass come.”\n\nShakespeare’s diction is important here, particularly with his use of the word “sickle.” Who is the person with whom the sickle is most greatly associated? Death. We are assured here that Death will certainly come, but that will not stop love. It may kill the lover, but the love itself is eternal.\n\nLines 11-12\n\nThis thought is continued in lines eleven and twelve, the final two lines of the third quatrain. Shakespeare writes,\n\nLove alters not with his brief hours and weeks,\n\nBut bears it out even to the edge of doom.\n\nHe is simply stating here that love does not change over time; instead, it continues on even after the world has ended (“the edge of doom”).\n\nLines 13-14\n\nShakespeare uses lines thirteen and fourteen, the final couplet of Sonnet 116, to assert how truly he believes that love is everlasting and conquers all. He writes,\n\nIf this be error and upon me proved\n\nI never writ, nor no man ever loved.\n\nIn this part of Sonnet 116, Shakespeare is telling his reader that if someone proves he is wrong about love, then he never wrote the following words, and no man ever loved. He is conveying here that if his words were untrue, nothing else would exist. The words he just wrote would have never been written, and no man would have ever loved them before.\n\nHe is adamant about this, and his tough words are what strengthen the sonnet itself. The speaker and poet himself are convinced that love is real, true, and everlasting.\n\nFAQs\n\nSimilar Poetry\n\nReaders who enjoyed this poem should also look into some of Shakespeare’s most popular sonnets. These include ‘Sonnet 130’ and ‘Sonnet 18‘. The first is recognized by its opening line, “My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun,” while the latter starts with the line “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?”"
