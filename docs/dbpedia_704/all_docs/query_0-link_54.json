        "text": "In the aftermath of a breakup, sometimes the only thing there is to do is cry your eyes out in the car to a soundtrack of breakup songs. (Singing along at the top of your lungs helps, too. It's scientifically proven.)\n\nTrust us, we get it. The heart wants what it wants, and sometimes, it just wants to feel with some help from a vault of sad breakup songs. You know that you’ll ultimately heal and move past your heart break, even if you can’t currently picture what the other side of your breakup looks like. But all that chin-up talk can be saved for another day. Right now, you’re in your feelings, and a playlist of heartbreak songs might be the only medicine.\n\nLike heartbreak itself, the best breakup songs hit on the full spectrum of human emotions, from grief, fear, and loneliness to denial, anger, and — once things have gotten a little lighter — release. Even joy. (There are, after all, no shortage of happy breakup songs out there.) For this exact moment, though, heartbreak songs that let you lean into your sadness are in order.\n\nThat’s why we’ve put together a breakup playlist that’ll speak straight to your splintered heart. (We’ve also thrown in a few kiss-off tracks, for good measure.) Round up some tissues before hitting play on these and surrounding yourself with breakup song lyrics, and please, don’t text your ex. You’ll regret it.\n\n1. “When You’re Gone,” Shawn Mendes (2022)\n\nIt’s a classic tale of regret, and the opening lyrics will get you right in the chest: “You never know how good you have it, oh-oh Until you're staring at a picture of the only girl that matters, ah.” We’ve all been there.\n\n2. “I Will Survive,” Gloria Gaynor (1978)\n\nThis song may be the ultimate pump-up song, breakup or no breakup. Having a bad day at work? Need some hype for a big test? This song will help. Versatility aside, it is a song about pulling yourself out of heartache at its core. Add it to your list of potential breakup songs.\n\n3. “Love Sux,” Avril Lavigne (2022)\n\nIt’s hard to fit the full portfolio of emotions that come right before setting on the decision to break up. Avril Lavigne puts it into words — the indecision, the insecurities, the depression of knowing something big and sad is ahead. Prepare to shed a few tears.\n\n4. “Watercolor Eyes,” Lana del Ray (2022)\n\nWhere lots of break-ups songs cover the feelings of knowing something is completely over, Lana del Ray dives into the grey area of a relationship: the back-and-forth of an on-again, off-again love. It’s the ache of wanting to be with someone and knowing it’s not totally right, in a single song.\n\n5. “Since U Been Gone,” Kelly Clarkson (2004)\n\nSince it hit the radio, this song has been the go-to anthem of many post-breakup situations. It’s the relief of being free from a relationship, it’s the power of the lesson learned, and it’s the confidence of knowing that whoever you’re splitting from really missed out on something good. We love Kelly for this one.\n\n6. “End of the Road,” Boyz II Men (1991)\n\nA hit off the band’s Cooleyhighharmony album, “End of the Road” is a ballad attempt to regain a lost love. While the lyrics can get quite intense (“You belong to me I belong to you. Although we've come to the end of the road, still I can't let go. It's unnatural. You belong to me, I belong to you”), it’s feeling that you just can’t pull yourself out of someone’s orbit in song form.\n\n7. “Used to Know Me,” Charli XCX (2022)\n\nThis song is Charli XCX celebrating the end of a relationship with a former partner. She perfectly captures the feeling of someone not completely understanding who you are. These lyrics say it all: “You say I'm turning evi. /I'll say I'm finally pure. Shine bright in my reflection. Think I lost myself before.”\n\n8. “Love of My Life,” Jennifer Lopez (2022)\n\nThe whole vibe of this song from love ballad queen Jennifer Lopez is “I have had enough.” And by enough, we mean the search for someone to complete you. This song tackles the important of being your own “love of your life,” even if you’re still looking fro someone to be by your side.\n\n9. “Good 4 U,” Olivia Rodrigo (2021)\n\nThis song is full of hidden references, from the nods to breakup-revenge films like Jennifer’s Body to setting the bedroom of a teenage boy we can only assume to be her ex in the song’s music video. It’s angry, it’s fantastical, and it’s therapuetic.\n\n10. “Cry Me a River,” Justin Timberlake (2002)\n\nMany believe this song was written in reference to the singer’s relationship with fellow performing artist Britney Spears. It was a time when relationships among singer-songwriters were beloved storylines and the breakups were not only heard, but felt, by listeners.\n\n11. “Thinkin Bout You,” Frank Ocean (2012)\n\nThe “woulda, coulda, shoulda” vibes are strong in this sexy ballad from Frank Ocean. The song bounces between defending feelings, shedding tears, and asking “Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?” It’s a tornado of emotions, the kind of song you listen to at night when you just need to cry it out a bit.\n\n12. “Call Out My Name,” The Weeknd (2018)\n\nThis one is all about someone who helped a love interest rise up out of a nasty breakup. Sounds promising, right? It is when they start dating… and then it isn’t when she falls out of love.\n\n13. “You’re So Vain,” Carly Simon (1972)\n\nWe all have someone in our journal we could dedicate this song to.\n\n14. “Gives You Hell,” The All-American Rejects (2008)\n\nWhile this song could be applied to anyone you feel less-than-favorably about, its high-energy beat plants it firmly in the breakup anthem territory.\n\n15. “Forget You,” Ceelo Green (2010)\n\nCeelo Green goes all in on the feeling of losing someone you love to another person. Even if that person may be what he calls a gold digger, that doesn’t mean the feelings can’t be complicated. It’s a song for anyone you wish you could forget about.\n\n16. \"Heartbeats,\"José González (2003)\n\nThe lyrics of this song doesn’t necessarily spell out heartbreak — it’s more so the soulful crooning José González offers up. “Ten days of perfect hues. The colors red and blue. We had a promise, babe. We were in love”; it’s the simple addition of past tense that will get you all in your feelings.\n\n17. “I’m Goin’ Down,” Mary J. Blige (1994)\n\nIf we had to tie a post-breakup period to this song, it would be the hazy, confused days immediately following a split. The lyrics play out a person begging for a reason — and that’s something we can all relate to.\n\n18. “Dancing On My Own,” Robyn (2010)\n\nNot only is this one of the catchiest broken-heart songs we’ve ever heard, but it’s aged incredibly well. Sometimes a night of dancing is what you need to break out of a funk, even if “I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home.”\n\n19. “Love Will Tear Us Apart,” The Cure (1980)\n\nThis throwback solidified some of the most agonizing lyrics for lost love: Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side. Is my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry. Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives.”\n\n20. “I Fall to Pieces,” Patsy Cline (1961)\n\nYou ever find seeing someone you used to love the equivalent of re-opening a painful wound? So did Patsy Cline. “You want me to act like we've never kissed? You want me to forget (to forget)? Pretend we've never met (never met)? And I've tried and I've tried, but I haven't yet. You walk by and I fall to pieces.”\n\n21. “Maps,” Yeah Yeah Yeahs (2003)\n\nThe haunting chorus — “Wait, they don’t love you like I love you” — will haunt you as you navigate seeing an old flame ignite a new relationship.\n\n22. “New Rules,” Dua Lipa (2017)\n\nWe’ve all been there: Letting someone step back in (again and again) after making the decision to part ways. In this song, Dua Lipa sets up a new system for kicking someone out of her life: “One: Don't pick up the phone. You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone. Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again. Three: Don't be his friend. You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'. And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him.”\n\n23. “Stay,” by Rihanna featuring Mikky Ekko (2012)\n\nRihanna may release club hit after club hit, but she really shines in her more vulnerable moments, like this pleading love song that is guaranteed to wreck even the strongest heart.\n\n24. “Someone Like You,” by Adele (2011)\n\nNo list of sad love songs would be complete without the queen of heartbreak ballads: the one and only Adele. Adele wrote this song about the end of her first “real” relationship, after which her ex got engaged, and it captures the pain of seeing a former love move on perfectly.\n\n25. “Stay With Me,” by Sam Smith (2014)\n\nBritish singer Sam Smith gives Adele a run for her money in the sad love songs department, and that’s really saying something.\n\n26. \"Best Thing I Never Had,\" by Beyoncé (2011)\n\nThis breakup ballad ultimately leaves you feeling empowered and ready to move on with the fierceness and dignity that only Queen Bey can inspire.\n\n27. “Take Care,” by Drake & Rihanna (2011)\n\nWhen Drake and Rihanna team up, magic happens. “Take Care” is one of their best duets because we can all identify with its lyrics about loving someone through their personal pain.\n\n28. “Stormy Weather,” Etta James (1960)\n\nWritten in 1933, this heartbreak anthem was first performed by boundary-breaking actress and singer Ethel Waters in a Harlem jazz club. It’s been recorded by a truly enormous number of artists since then, from Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra to Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan, but we have a special spot for Etta’s version.\n\n29. “Love You Goodbye,” by One Direction (2015)\n\nPerhaps it’s because it was released shortly before One Direction’s “hiatus,” but “Love You Goodbye” still makes us cry.\n\n30. “I Will Always Love You,” by Whitney Houston (1992)\n\nDolly Parton wrote this legendary love song about her soon-to-end (professional) relationship with musical partner Porter Wagoner. But it was Whitney Houston who made it very, very, very famous. It’s one of the most emotional, powerful heartbreak songs of all time, with breakup song lyrics that are both simple and gut-punching.\n\n31. “Somebody That I Used to Know,” by Gotye & Kimbra (2011)\n\nGotye and Kimbra’s duet was *everywhere* a few years ago — probably because so many people identified with its lyrics about failing to recognize the person you fell in love with.\n\n32. “We Don’t Talk Anymore,” by Charlie Puth and Selena Gomez (2016)\n\n“Even after all this time/I still wonder why I can’t move on/the way you did so easily,” Charlie sings, stabbing us in the heart every time.\n\n33. “Talia,” King Princess (2018)\n\nQueer icon King Princess is credited as having written a quintessential heartbreak song with “Talia,” which she wrote to recover from a breakup herself. (Fun fact: Amandla Stenberg worked on the music video, and the two briefly dated that year.)\n\n34. “Wrecking Ball,” by Miley Cyrus (2013)\n\nMiley knows a thing or two about how to get over heartbreak, starting with not trying to gloss over the pain. The sweeping breakup ballad “Wrecking Ball” is her masterpiece, and she’s crying real tears in the video. (We know we are when listening.)\n\n35. “Don’t Speak,” by No Doubt (1995)\n\nNo Doubt’s “Don’t Speak” is arguably the best pop song of the ‘90s, and for good reason. It’s a pretty perfect breakup ballad, and Gwen Stefani’s lyrics, based on her real-life split with bassist Tony Kanal, perfectly encapsulate the heartbreak of letting go.\n\n36. “Losing You,” Solange (2012)\n\nOftentimes, the period just before a breakup can be more heartbreaking than the main event, full as it is of doubt, suspicion and heartache at growing apart. Solange captures that mix of feelings well with lyrics like: “I don’t know why I fight it, clearly we are through. Tell me the truth boy, am I losing you for good.”\n\n37. “Visions of Gideon,” Sufjan Stevens (2017)\n\nFor when you need to make like a brokenhearted Elio in Call Me By Your Name and, ideally, sob in front of a roaring fire.\n\n38. “Hard Feelings / Loveless,” Lorde (2017)\n\nAfter breaking up with longtime partner James Lowe, Lorde gave us the album Melodrama, and this track captures everything from the first painful moments of realizing you’re falling out of love to finding the coldness that, for better or worse, can help you move on.\n\n39. “Ex-Factor,” Lauryn Hill (1998)\n\nFrom her (flawless) “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” album, this song perfectly sums up that ex who just won’t let you move on, putting you through heartbreak again and again.\n\n40. “Say Something,” by A Great Big World & Christina Aguilera (2014)\n\nThis slow burning, pleading ballad featuring the golden voice of Christina Aguilera is about how powerless you can feel in a dying relationship. Did it break your heart when you first heard it? Honestly, we’re still recovering.\n\n41. “Always Be My Baby,” Mariah Carey (1995)\n\nFor when you know a relationship is over — for now — but that, as Carey sings, “time can’t erase a feeling this strong.”\n\n42. “All Too Well,” by Taylor Swift (2012)\n\nTaylor Swift breakup songs belong in a category of their own. After Swift dropped the 10-minute “All Too Well” short film accompanying the rerelease of this track on Red (Taylor’s Version), the world pretty much became one giant, weepy puddle.\n\n43. \"It Must Have Been Love,\" by Roxette (1980)\n\nFrom Pretty Woman, this song still gives us all the feels.\n\n44. “Hallelujah,” Jeff Buckley (1994)\n\n“Love is not a victory march, it’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah.” We mean, woof. The way this song speaks to love’s futility kind of destroys us. Although it's Leonard Cohen who wrote this all-time classic ballad in 1984, there’s something extra haunting about Buckley’s version.\n\n45. \"Shake It Out,\" by Florence + The Machine (2011)\n\nThe pain and the regret are raw and real as Florence belts out, \"I've been a fool and I've been blind. I can never leave the past behind. I can see no way.\"\n\n46. “Landslide,” Fleetwood Mac (1975)\n\nWhen you’re feeling, more than anything, sad and wistful about what you’ve lost and how people can change, let Stevie speak straight to you with lyrics like: “Well I’ve been afraid of changing ‘cause I’ve built my life around you. But time makes you bolder, even children get older, and I’m getting older too.”\n\n47. “Space Cowboy,” Kacey Musgraves (2018)\n\nBecause sometimes, when a horse wants to run, there ain’t no sense in closing the gate.\n\n48. “She’s Got You,” Patsy Cline (1962)\n\nWhen someone you loved moves on before you do, leave it to Patsy to perfect that gut-punching feeling decades before Adele was doing it.\n\n49. \"For the First Time,\" by The Script (2010)\n\nBrimming with breakup vibes, this pop-rock hit perfectly captures the moments leading up to a breakup: \"She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart while I'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar and we don't know how we got into this mad situation, only doing things out of frustration.\"\n\n50. \"Fix You,\" by Coldplay (2005)\n\nStuck in reverse? Lights will guide you home, and you can cry your eyes out as this song plays on repeat.\n\n51. “So Long, Marianne,” Leonard Cohen (1967)\n\nCohen wrote this song about Marianne Ihlen, his girlfriend and muse throughout the 1960s, while living in New York’s Chelsea Hotel. Bittersweet, it’s among the best, most time-honored songs about breaking up with someone you still love.\n\n52. “Love is a Losing Game,” Amy Winehouse (2006)\n\nThere are times in life when we all need to throw ourselves (and our love lives) a pity party, and Winehouse’s mournfully sung ballad about the futility of love is probably that party’s perfect soundtrack.\n\n53. “Running Low,” by Shawn Mendes (2015)\n\nThis Shawn Mendes breakup ballad is about the slow decline of a relationship due to days on the road, and Shawn’s gorgeous voice only makes it more painfully beautiful.\n\n54. “You Were Meant For Me,” Jewel (1995)\n\n“I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too, I got my maple syrup, everything but you.” Only a broken heart (and mid-90s Jewel) could make a pancake breakfast sound so dismal.\n\n55. \"Dreaming with a Broken Heart,\" by John Mayer (2006)\n\nThis one cuts deep: \"You roll out of a bed, and down on your knees, and for a moment you can hardly breathe.\" Yep, John. That's exactly what the absolute worst breakups feel like at first.\n\n56. \"It Ain't Me,\" by Kygo with Selena Gomez (2017)\n\nWhen you're ready to move on, press play on this Kygo hit. Boyce Avenue also does a breathtaking acoustic cover with Sarah Hyland that's also worth checking out.\n\n57. \"How to Save a Life,\" by The Fray (2005)\n\nNo good conversation ever starts with \"we need to talk.\" This beautiful piano anthem plays homage to the moment he goes left and she goes right.\n\n58. \"Let It Go,\" by James Bay (2015)\n\nSlow and chilling, Bay's crystal voice will have you reaching for your tissues in no time. Cry it out, girl. Let it go.\n\n59. “Girl From the North Country,” Bob Dylan (1963)\n\nDylan wrote this song about on-and-off-again girlfriend and artist Suze Rotolo, who he’d traveled to Italy to search for after the two split. Unable to find Rotolo — she had, unbeknownst to him, already left for the United States — Dylan finished writing this, and lyrics like “she was once a true love of mine” make it one of the best heartbreak songs in his repertoire.\n\n60. \"Irreplaceable,\" by Beyoncé (2006)\n\nIf ever there was a breakup anthem that will make you happy it's over, this is it.\n\n61. “Gonna Hurry (as Slow as I Can),” Dolly Parton (2009)\n\nThough a lot of people would list “Jolene” as the Dolly song that best speaks to a love’s impending end, this newer track is a close runner up. For anyone who’s ever dragged out a doomed relationship’s last breaths, you’ll recognize its mood.\n\n62. \"Exhale,\" by Whitney Houston (1995)\n\nSometimes it's wrong, sometimes it's right. For the times it's wrong, just exhale with Whitney.\n\n63. “Torn,” Natalie Imbruglia (1997)\n\nBad breakups really do leave you feeling out of faith and, well, torn. This song perfectly captures the feeling of realizing something (and someone) you’d believed in is little more than an illusion, and may we recommend Imbruglia’s acoustic cover, off MTV Unplugged, for an extra side of angst.\n\n64. \"Total Eclipse of the Heart,\" by Bonnie Tyler (1983)\n\nEvery now and then, we all fall apart.\n\n65. \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever,\" by Zayn Malik and Taylor Swift (2017)\n\nWishing they'd call? Losing hope? Can't sleep? Feeling like the world is cruel? This is your jam.\n\n66. \"Skinny Love,\" by Bon Iver (2007)\n\nThis breakup song captures that moment where your love is withering, your bond is weak, and things are just a mess.\n\n67. \"Not Over You,\" by Gavin DeGraw (2011)\n\nIf you're the opposite of fine, and the harsh reality is you're not over it, take comfort in this song that proves you're not the only one who feels this way.\n\n68. \"Let Her Go,\" by Passenger (2012)\n\nPassenger perfectly captures the unique emptiness that a breakup feels like: \"Only know you've been high when you're feeling low, only hate the road when you're missing home, only know your love her when you let her go.\"\n\n69. \"When Can I See You Again,\" by Babyface (1993)\n\nWondering if you'll ever get over it? You will. But in the meantime, you've got the sweet stylings of the one and only Babyface.\n\n70. \"Leave (Get Out),\" by D-Money and JoJo (2009)\n\nWith angst and attitude, JoJo almost makes you happy it's over: \"Get out, right now, it's the end of you and me. It's too late and I can't wait for you to be gone. 'Cuz I know about her and I wonder how I bought all the lies. You said that you would treat me right, but you were just a waste of time.\"\n\n71. “Bring It On Home to Me,” Sam Cooke (1975)\n\nLike this track, Cooke’s “I’ll Come Running Back to You” similarly sums up the feeling of not caring how it looks — you just want someone back.\n\n72. \"Since U Been Gone,\" by Kelly Clarkson (2004)\n\nThis song is meant to be blasted as you sing/cry/scream it out.\n\n73. \"Big Girls Cry,\" by Sia (2014)\n\nWhen your heart's breaking, you cry. We all do. There's no shame in it.\n\n74. “I Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes),” Chet Baker (1956)\n\nComposed in 1939 and later popularized by Baker, this track has spent decade after decade on lists of the saddest breakup songs and has been recorded by everyone from Billie Holiday and Nina Simone to Carly Simon.\n\n75. \"The Man Who Can't Be Moved,\" by The Script (2008)\n\nFeeling lonely? Missing the beautiful beginning of the relationship, long before it all went awry? If you're finding it hard to move on, this is your soundtrack.\n\n76. \"Love Me Now,\" by John Legend (2016)\n\nWhen everything is falling apart and you don't want to acknowledge it, that's the time to press play on this hit: \"I know this will kill me when it's over. I don't want to think about it. I just want you to love me now.\"\n\n77. “Angie,” The Rolling Stones (1973)\n\nThere are mixed theories about who the “Angie” at the center of this Stones’ song is; David Bowie’s then-wife Angela is among the more popular guesses. Regardless of who inspired it, it remains a classic among heartbreak songs for a reason, with lyrics like “You can’t say we never tried… all the dreams were held so close, seemed to all go up in smoke.”\n\n78. \"Cups (Pitch Perfect's 'When I'm Gone')\", by Anna Kendrick\n\nLike the lyrics say … he's gonna miss you when you're gone.\n\n79. \"It's Too Late,\" by Carole King (1971)\n\nCarole King wrote this Grammy-winning breakup song in a single day after her relationship with James Taylor ended. The '70s lyrics still apply today: \"It's too late, baby now, it's too late. Though we really did try to make it. Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide and I just can't fake it.\"\n\n80. \"Water Runs Dry,\" by Boyz II Men (2009)\n\nThere's the classic R&B version, and there's also a stripped down, acoustic rendition from Boyce Avenue. Either way, this will give you chills.\n\n81. “New York,” St. Vincent (2017)\n\nAnnie Clark, known by her stage name St. Vincent, wrote this song not just as a eulogy for a relationship; it’s also a eulogy for the era, and the city, that the relationship existed in. And during a breakup, that’s often what we’re really mourning — not just the end of the love itself, but an end to the world that you and this person built together.\n\n82. “The Heart Wants What It Wants,” Selena Gomez (2014)\n\nThis emotional ballad describing an on-and-off-again relationship you can’t let go of definitely wasn’t about Jelena, of course.\n\n83. \"We Belong Together,\" by Mariah Carey (2006)\n\n\"We Belong Together\" is Mariah's sixteenth No. 1 hit, and it's no wonder: the pain is real and raw in this anthem, made all the better by her angel voice.\n\n84. \"It Ain't Me Babe,\" by Bob Dylan (1964)\n\nThrow it back with this quintessential '60s hit: \"Go away from my window, leave at your own chosen speed. I'm not the one you want, babe. I'm not the one you need.\"\n\n85. \"Heartless,\" by Kanye West (2008)\n\nThis will end up on repeat when you're in the post-breakup anger phase: \"They say that they don't see what you see in me. You wait a couple months then you gon' see. You'll never find nobody better than me.\"\n\n86. “Drive,” Miley Cyrus (2013)\n\nMiley wrote this song on Valentine’s Day about soon-to-be ex (then spouse, then ex again) Liam Hemsworth. Afterward, she told FASHION Magazine: “Emotionally it was such a hard time. It is about needing to leave someone but not really wanting to completely cut yourself off from the relationship.
