        "text": "My girlfriend and I both love to read on vacation. Once, on a camping trip, I finished my book early. She was halfway through a hefty novel and ripped out the first hundred pages to give to me. This tradition of giving each other “leaflets” has allowed us to share our favorite books, and the trips we read them on, that much more closely.\n\n– Laura Birnbaum, Washington, D.C.\n\nMy husband always picks me up at the airport when I travel solo. He parks his car and comes in to wait for me. I travel a lot for work, and it makes me feel deeply loved every time.\n\n– Sara Berens, Phoenix\n\nToday, every day, and on Valentine’s Day, I will visit my wife of 56 years. We are separated by her dementia. I will tell her what’s been going on outside, as I spoon-feed her in her care-home hospital bed. She says, “Thank you,” when I tell her I love her. We both know she would say more, if only she could. We have had a great life together, ever since the second grade. She is slowly leaving, I know that. But we’re a pair until then.\n\n– Gene Lock, Sacramento, Calif.\n\nMy partner won’t let me go out in a pair of scuffed or dull boots. He gets out his portable Executive Valet Shine Kit. “Put your foot up here,” he demands. He slides a chamois cloth back and forth across the toe, the upper, the vamp, the quarter, the collar, the counter.\n\nI am transported back to Jennings, La., in 1964, when he would skip school to earn money at his shoeshine shop in front of the local grocery store. Before mandatory integration, Jefferson Davis High was where the Black kids went. Education was important, but earning money was imperative. However, shining shoes wasn’t just about cash for him. It was about looking good. And now? It’s all about love.\n\n– Susan Parker, Oakland, Calif.\n\nMy husband and I have two small kids. Every weekend, he lets me sleep in as late as I want. I usually wake up, refreshed and happy, to a cup of coffee and apple pancakes. I cannot imagine anything better.\n\n– Christine Gockel, Berlin, Germany\n\nMy husband and I welcomed our first child in August. Throughout the day, he’ll bring me water or tea to make sure I’m hydrated. Snacks are always replenished for middle of the night feedings and pumping.\n\n– Cristina Lin, San Jose, Calif.\n\nWe use electric toothbrushes but only keep one charger out. Each of us puts the other’s toothbrush onto the charger after we brush our teeth. A small but enduring reminder that our last thought was of each other.\n\n– Deb Larney, Oak Lawn, Ill.\n\nWe try to go to bed at the same time. It is a sweet, calm time to process the day, look at each other, talk about life and connect!\n\n– Lori McMahon, Longmeadow, Mass.\n\nMy husband was diagnosed with cognitive decline in 2020. Every day, I show my love by making sure he’s OK — taking him to doctor’s appointments, finding the words he is struggling to find and helping him to make decisions. Love can be shown in thousands of ways. You don’t need boxes of chocolates, flowers or gifts. You need compassion, empathy and grace.\n\n– Linda Basilick, Clermont, Fla.\n\nWhen my partner travels for work, we each write daily notes in a small journal that we share with one another when he returns. It’s just little things about the day that we’d have said out loud if we were together.\n\n– Brook Ewing Minner, Brooksville, Maine\n\nWe say, “I love you” every time one of us leaves the house. It seems small, but after almost 17 years of marriage, I would feel like I had left my keys behind if I hadn’t said it.\n\n– Kate Reymann, Salt Lake City\n\nMy husband knows I love to drink water throughout the day. Every morning, I find my 32 ounce water bottle in the fridge filled with fresh lemon slices and water. People often comment on the water when they see the lemons floating around, and it makes me think of how much I love him.\n\n– Mary Nevin, Manchester Center, Vt.\n\nMy precious husband, to whom I was married for 46 glorious years, passed away six years ago. But not a day has gone by since when I haven’t blown a kiss to the photograph of him that I keep on my bedroom table.\n\n– Karen Strauss, New Rochelle, N.Y.\n\nMy husband does the grocery shopping, and he frequently buys me a funny card while he’s there. The more obscure, the better. Like, “Congrats on your retirement!” (We’re both 34.) Or, “Have a blessed baptism!” (We’re not religious.) I always feel a little brighter after receiving them.\n\n– Abby Goldsmith, St. Louis, Mo.\n\nEvery night before we go to sleep, my boyfriend and I tell each other our high, low and “best bite” of the day. When we are both busy with work, it is a great way to talk about the key points of our day. We also both love food, so highlighting our meals makes it special.\n\n– Sarah Feldman, London\n\nMy wife and I try to be playful. An arm fell off of our daughter’s doll, and we started hiding it for each other to find around the house. Sometimes it’s hidden for months. We don’t acknowledge that we’ve found it, we just hide it again. It’s slightly unnerving to find a small severed arm in your sweater drawer when the weather turns cool, but it always makes us smile.\n\n– Matt Moody, Cold Spring, N.Y.\n\nMy husband often saves part of a cookie or treat, from work or an event, and wraps it in a napkin so I can try it. It’s usually smooshed and unappetizing by the time it gets home, but I love that he thinks I will like it!\n\n– Cindy Yang, Orinda, Calif.\n\nMy partner and I manage our relationship between two different cities. Every time I fly to him, I fold a small origami paper crane. (Sometimes I forget origami paper and have to get creative with the pages of the in-flight magazine.) He has kept every single one, as a reminder that we’re never more than a short flight away.\n\n– Rhiannon Mabberley, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nMy husband and I joke that our love language is chores. He never gets me flowers, but he takes care of tasks around the house with a smile. I’d take that over gifts any day.\n\n– Karen Acker, Jenkintown, Pa.\n\nMy husband brings me a box of fruity Tic Tacs when he stocks the house with groceries most every weekend. They are my favorite, and I smile every time I find them on the kitchen table. When I thank him, he says, “I was thinking of you.”\n\n– Heidi Busse, Bloomington, Minn.\n\nWe play a game every night. It has changed over the years — backgammon, dice, dominoes — but the ritual is cherished. It used to be our way to reconnect after being apart all day, or to have a few minutes together away from the kids. Now we are empty nesters, and it serves as a little reminder of our journey.\n\n– Elizabeth Shaw, Park City, Utah\n\nI cook breakfast every morning. When we got engaged, he said: “If you cook breakfast, I’ll do everything else.” I know a good deal when I see one.\n\n– Susan Ashworth, Austin, Texas\n\nMy boyfriend meets me almost every day at 4 a.m. during my 10- or 11-mile run. It doesn’t matter if it is 10 degrees out or 90, I know I can depend on him to be there in the dark. We catch up, then he walks home and I continue on my way. I love our early morning walks under the stars.\n\n– Pamela Simboli, Grand View-on-Hudson, N.Y.\n\nWhen my cancer diagnosis recurred this fall, my husband of 54 years began folding 1,000 origami cranes. Legend says that they will bring good luck and good health. We have installed them in our hallway as a constant reminder of hope and joy. They are beautiful to look at, and they also seem to be working, as I am responding to treatment.\n\n– Jane Berke, Alpharetta, Ga.\n\nSince the ’90s, Friday night has been date night in our home. It used to mean a trip to Blockbuster; now, it’s a scroll of the streaming services. Dinner at its best is homemade waffles and prosecco, though sometimes we get takeout. The routine has survived 13 moves, from Oregon to London.\n\n– Jesse Finch Gnehm, London\n\nAlmost every weekday, my work-from-home partner sends me a picture of them snuggling with my cat. It brings me joy to know they’re cozy together in our home while I’m off at work.\n\n– Marianna Hane Wiles, Portland, Ore.\n\nWe give each other a 20-second hug in the morning. We quietly squeeze each other close and breathe in and out. Sometimes a child or the dog joins.\n\n– Meg Freedman, Denver\n\nTwo years ago, when I was diagnosed with a cancer recurrence, my husband took over doing my laundry. He is still doing it. My heart aches with love when I see my underpants neatly folded in their drawer, separated into two piles: prints on one side and solids on the other.\n\n– Deborah DeMille-Wagman, Bethesda, Md.\n\nMy husband and I are avid crossword players and often work on a puzzle together. One difference: He likes to use a mechanical pencil. I’m old school and use a No. 2. My husband keeps them sharpened for me. He never says he does it, but they are always nice and ready.\n\n– Enrose Anton, Sacramento, Calif.\n\nWe shower together, almost every time, and have for over 35 years. Before one of us steps out, we hug, let the water run over us, and say, “I love you.”\n\n– Kathryn Reinhardt, Willsboro, N.Y.\n\nMy husband always makes sure that my car’s gas tank is full, the windshield wipers are in good shape and the fluids are topped off. That’s his way of telling me that he’ll never leave me stranded.\n\n– Diane Norman, Herndon, Va.\n\nOn Sunday nights, I make a loaf of bread just big enough to get us through the work week. Every day, my husband makes us sandwiches to take to work, carefully slicing the loaf. He says, “Who loves you, baby?” I say, “You do!”\n\n– Alison Hunter, Chicago\n\nWe live in a rural area and have no walkway from the garage to our front door. My husband always stops the car in front of our home, so I can walk down the sidewalk to the front door, while he parks the car in the garage.\n\n– Margaret Kohl, Green Township, N.J.\n\nWe live in different cities and have different work schedules, so we talk on the phone three times a day: during my lunch hour, during his lunch hour and right before I go to bed.\n\n– Katrina Alison Jaggears, Stockton, Calif.\n\nI began writing my wife a daily poem, starting the first time I kissed her a decade and an half ago. I’ve never missed a day, and she’s kept all 5,000-plus of them. Some are silly, others serious. Mostly, they keep us connected day after day, word after word.\n\n– Kevin Fuller, Minneapolis"
