        "text": "BobbyM\n\nPost by t***@iwvisp.com\n\nPaul Davis, a singer and songwriter whose soft rock hit \"I Go Crazy\"\n\nstayed at the top of the charts for weeks after its release in 1977,\n\nhas died at a Mississippi hospital.\n\nDavis was a singer and songwriter, whose other popular hits included\n\n\"65 Love Affair;\" \"You're Still New To Me,\" a country duet with Marie\n\nOsmond; and \"Ride 'Em Cowboy.\"\n\nHis 1977 album \"Singer of Songs -- Teller of Tales\" featured the\n\nballad \"I Go Crazy.\"\n\nI was just listening to several Paul Davis songs last night while on my\n\nevening walk. Although I can take or leave a lot of his work, he was\n\ndefinitely one of the more versatile performers in the 70's, who was equally\n\nat home writing/singing country, pop, rock & even a dash of disco. My\n\nfavorite will always be \"Ride 'Em Cowboy\". It was released just as new\n\ncountry was starting to emerge from the late 60's country-rock movement.\n\nThe album was unique in that the front cover was a denim shirt that actually\n\nopened in the middle as if it were a real shirt. The back of the album was\n\nthe back of the shirt naturally, except that you also saw Davis' ponytail\n\nand only then did you realize that Davis wasn't really a country singer\n\n(long hair, especially that long, wasn't in fashion for country singers at\n\nthe time); just a guess but the inspiration for that album cover probably\n\ncame from Alice Cooper's \"Easy Action\".\n\nunknown\n\nVery sorry to hear of his death - that being said, I think he was a\n\nsinger that was a lot more talented than the songs he released as\n\nsingles. they were good, but there wasn't any one song that was truly\n\ngreat or stood out as his best. His biggest was probably I Go Crazy\n\nbut that really wasn't a great song or even that good. he did some\n\nremakes Darlin', Little Bit Of Soap, Love or Let Me Be Lonely, etc\n\ngood but certainly not great. Various other popular hits - Superstar,\n\nRide Em Cowboy, Sweet Life, Cool Night, Do Right - all popular hits,\n\ndecent but nothing spectacular. what does that leave?\n\n'65 Love Affair !! could that have been his best? It was pretty good.\n\nRIP Paul Davis"
