        "text": "You can have a happy ADHD marriage.\n\nRead that again. You probably don’t hear it often enough.\n\nAdults With ADHD Can Have Happy, Fulfilling Marriages\n\nThe statistics are scary, and at times you might not believe it’s possible to make a marriage work with ADHD in the mix. You fight too much. Your house is a mess. You can’t find your keys. You’re late for appointments, if you even remember that you have them. The bills are late. You say things without thinking or tune out during important conversations.\n\nLife is chaotic. And still, adults with ADHD are completely capable of happy, fulfilling marriages.\n\nAll marriages have their ups and downs, but if one or both spouses have ADHD, the relationship is significantly more challenging. Two people, two lives entwined, every day, under one roof…and ADHD. It’s complex, it’s hard, it’s beautiful, and it’s not impossible.\n\nYou Choose if You Strengthen or Weaken Your Rope\n\nMarriage is like a rope. The entwined threads can either be sturdy or frayed. The rope stays strong and supportive as you both reach and climb upward together. But with too much stress, the threads can become twisted and frayed, the rope weakens, and gradually your relationship starts to fall apart.\n\nThe good news is that you are always an active participant in your marriage. You can choose your role, how you communicate, and the behaviors that can either strengthen or weaken your bond.\n\nIf you are willing and ready to strengthen the rope that holds you and your spouse together, you will bring back the warm, cozy feeling you had when you first met.\n\nRelationships Thrive When…\n\nRemember when you met? Do you remember the sparks that were flying between you when you looked into each other’s eyes? Something about that person made you want to spend the rest of your lives together. You can bring that feeling back again.\n\nIn fact, it can be even better than that – a deeper, more mature, and profound connection – if you choose to make the effort.\n\nRelationships thrive when both partners act lovingly towards one another, are willing to make an effort to grow, and are committed to working on themselves.\n\nADHD Symptoms that Affect Relationships\n\nThe first step to building a thriving relationship when dating someone with ADHD is to reflect on how you or your partner’s ADHD affects it.\n\nIn general, ADHD symptoms can be divided into two main categories: inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity.\n\nSymptoms of inattention may lead to the following challenges:[1]\n\nDifficulty finishing household chores and staying organized\n\nMissing dates, appointments, or special occasions\n\nPoor focus and drifting during conversations\n\nForgetting to run errands as promised\n\nNot managing finances well\n\nThese symptoms may cause the non-ADHD partner to feel unseen and unheard. They might also feel like they have to shoulder all the household tasks alone.\n\nSymptoms of impulsivity in ADHD can cause issues as follows:\n\nInterrupting your partner during conversations [1]\n\nStruggling to regulate emotions[2]\n\nBlurting out hurtful remarks\n\nHaving emotional outbursts\n\nAdditional symptoms of ADHD that can affect relationships are:\n\nEmotional Dysregulation\n\nLovebombing\n\nHyperfixation\n\nThe person with ADHD isn’t at fault for their symptoms. ADHD is not an attitude problem, it’s a condition that affects the brain.\n\nBut it’s still crucial for them to take responsibility for their behavior and seek the treatment they need.\n\nThe good news is that ADHD symptoms can be effectively managed using therapy and medications.\n\nThere are also options for ADHD coaching and counseling. Working with professionals can provide valuable guidance and insights on dating with ADHD.\n\n7 Ways to Live Peacefully with ADHD\n\nApart from professional treatment, having the right habits, mindset, and attitude toward your relationship can help turn things around.\n\nHere are 7 tips to help you and your partner live peacefully with ADHD:\n\n1. Bring Back the Love\n\nYou loved each other once. As the years go by, you know more about each other. The “real” person comes out. Often you find yourself thinking, what happened to the person I fell in love with? The more comfortable you get in relationships, the more you take them for granted. You forget to nurture and nourish them.\n\nExpectations cause disappointment. Resentment sets in, secretly hiding in the background of your lives.\n\nWith ADHD, life can be lived impulsively or haphazardly. After a hard day at the office, a stressful commute home, and driving children to after-school activities, it’s hard to feel romantic, especially when you are late, forget your keys, or realize you didn’t pick up your kids.\n\nIt sounds unnatural, but if you want to reconnect emotionally, you have to schedule private time for your relationship. Yes, that means make a date (like the old days). Put it in your calendar.\n\nBusy days filled with work, phones, and Facebook can distance us from our partners. Schedule a “shut down” time at least once a week: no phones, no TV, no interruptions. Just be together. Talk about your day. Leave out the comments, judgment, and criticism. Pretend you’re on a first date again.\n\n2. Slow Down\n\nLife with ADHD is often frantic. Leaving the house, finishing projects, and showing up for appointments on time can be stressful for a person with ADHD. Each day whizzes by. Sometimes you can’t even remember where you went, what you did, and who you were with.\n\nADHD is fast-moving; in the body and the mind. Take time to slow down your body. Intentionally, move slower. Your mind will follow.\n\n3. Accept Imperfections\n\nPeople with ADHD have a few more challenges than most. However, everyone is imperfect—even you. Once you accept your flaws, you will think differently about your partner’s imperfections. We are human; all of us are struggling through life individually, yet together. Judgmental, critical thoughts distance you from peace and love.\n\n4. Look for the Good\n\nEvery trait has a positive and negative side to it. The trait that drives you crazy is probably the same trait that brings a benefit to your life. Start by giving compliments. Say something nice. Sometimes you have to look hard to find it, but if you value your relationship, it’s worth the effort.\n\nRemember your impulsive partner may be the fast-acting doctor, nurse, or EMT who is saving someone’s life.\n\n5. Prioritize Your Conflicts\n\nMost things couples fight about aren’t worth the effort. Every comment, disappointment, or difference of opinion does not have to turn your home into a battlefield.\n\nTry not to react when negative emotions are strong. Speaking while angry causes damage to your partner and the relationship. Take space for yourself to manage your feelings and pick your battles.\n\n6. Be On the Same Team\n\nOne of the most important things you can do is join forces. Be on the same team. Bickering, competing, and criticizing are habits that are harmful to a loving relationship.\n\nWhen you’re in the midst of negativity, be it an argument or just the voice in your head, remember to regroup, readjust, and realign your thoughts so that you feel united with your partner.\n\n7. Practice Compassion\n\nThis is indispensable within any relationship. A person with ADHD often feels disappointed, overwhelmed, and frustrated. When a person with ADHD appears to be acting selfishly, it may be that they are feeling overwhelmed with their own thoughts.\n\nADHD takes up a lot of mental and emotional bandwidth. It’s exhausting, and often the ADHDer is struggling to get through the next task.\n\nSlow down, be compassionate, and refrain from judgment. Your ADHD loved one will respond lovingly to your kindness.\n\nAn ADHD relationship requires patience and compassion, at times more than other relationships. Understanding what it feels like to have ADHD- without judgment- will help both partners stay on the same page and allow you to regain a peaceful, happy home.\n\nThe more love you give, the more you will receive.\n\nTeamwork is Key to a Healthy Relationship\n\nRemember that you’re not against but for each other in your relationship.\n\nInstead of trying to win a conflict or argument, try to work together to find a middle ground or solution to prevent recurring issues.\n\nUltimately, a happy relationship is definitely possible. This can be achieved with a willingness to give and take and support each other through the ups and downs.\n\nIf you’re in a committed relationship where ADHD is a third partner, ADDA+ is for you.
