        "text": "Well, it's been a rough old few years, hasn't it? And sure, it's 2023, but even without the global pandemic, life can get a little sad from time to time. Sometimes the only antidote is a tub of ice cream, some incredibly sad songs and a seriously good cry. So don't worry, we've got you. In our opinion, the best sad songs donâ€™t just whine and gesture at bad feelings - they wallow in the depths with you.\n\nAs they say, misery loves company, and songwriters sure know how to capitalise on our sorrow. And we love them for it. Newcomers to our list include Labrinth's â€˜Never Felt So Aloneâ€™ (2023), Celeste's â€˜Strangeâ€™ (2019) and of course, ultimate sad girl anthem â€˜Drivers Licenceâ€™ by Olivia Rodridgo (2021). All have earned their crowns as sad anthems. All have reduced us to tears. It doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s an RnB tune, 12-bar blues or indie rock bummer jam â€“ there are tearjerkers for everyone here. Here are the best sad songs ever.\n\nContributers: Andrzej Lukowski, Oliver Keens, James Manning, Tristan Parker, Hayley Joyes, Nick Levine, Andy Kryza, Ella Doyle, Georgia Evans, Ed Cunningham, Chiara Wilkinson, India Lawrence, Henrietta Taylor.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\nðŸ˜­ The best breakup songs\n\nðŸ’” The best heartbreak songs\n\nðŸ˜Š The best happy songs\n\nðŸŽ¤ The best karaoke songs\n\n41. â€˜La Ritournelleâ€™ (Instrumental Mix) by Sebastien Tellier\n\nWith lyrics in place, this gorgeous song from French singer Tellier embodies all the hope and anticipation of a new love affair. But the instrumental makes it an absolute tearjerker, with a lilting piano motif that says wet Parisian streets, broken hearts and the knowledge sheâ€™s not coming back. Deliciously French.\n\n42. â€˜The Crying Gameâ€™ by Dave Berry\n\nSemi-forgotten at home in the UK but still apparently a superstar on the continent, Berry made his name in 1964 with this sentimental pop single. Itâ€™s as weepy as they come, especially the bit where he asks the moon for advice on how to get over a break-up, and its unexpected chord changes have been navigated over the years by Boy George, Kylie and many others. This was also the first ever UK hit to feature a wah-wah pedal â€“ not a sound you might immediately associate with tragedy, but that makes it all the more surprising when it hits you right in the heartstrings.\n\nAdvertising\n\n43. â€˜Ghostsâ€™ by Japan\n\nâ€˜When the room is quiet, the daylight almost goneâ€¦â€™ The sceneâ€™s set for four-and-a-half minutes of ambient synths and introverted crooning by a bunch of glam kids from Catford. â€˜Ghostsâ€™ is a deft sketch of a troubled mind running in ever-narrowing circles. Itâ€™s sad, strange and spooky â€“ but somehow it made the singles chart Top Five. The â€˜80s were a very weird time.\n\n44. â€˜Moments of Pleasureâ€™ by Kate Bush\n\nâ€˜This Woman's Workâ€™ is Kate Bush's most iconic piano ballad, but â€˜Moments of Pleasureâ€™ is probably even more poignant. Here, Bexleyheath's finest looks back longingly at friends, collaborators and family members she has lost along the way. Her vocals are exquisite, the orchestral arrangements by movie composer Michael Kamen are stirring without being schmaltzy, and the song itself builds beautifully to a devastating final two verses. When Bush starts singing about her late mother (who succumbed to cancer in 1992, the year before â€˜Moments of Pleasureâ€™ was released), you might find you need to take a moment.\n\nAdvertising\n\n45. â€˜Timeâ€™ by Culture Club\n\nDecember, 1982: Iâ€™m at a seventeenth birthday party in a function room in a small Kent town. The girl I am secretly in love with but have never spoken to is dancing to The Jam whilst I lurk just off the dancefloor trying to work up courage. As the DJ drops Culture Club, she turns and kisses the biggest dickhead in the sixth form, and Boy George soundtracks a teenage heart breaking. George wrote â€˜Timeâ€™ about his secret love for Culture Club drummer Jon Moss, which only makes it sadder: heâ€™s mourning the end of the affair before it even began.\n\n46. â€˜The Past is a Grotesque Animalâ€™ by Of Montreal\n\nEccentric indie rockers Of Montreal briefly became the best band in the world when frontman Kevin Barnes poured all his confusion and self-loathing at the collapse of his marriage into this stupendous piece of music (and attendant album Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?). A brutally honest 12-minute dissection of the relationship from start to end, set to a throbbing, glammed-up motorik backing, â€˜The Past is a Grotesque Animalâ€™ is frazzled and harrowing but also thrillingly audacious.\n\nAdvertising\n\n47. â€˜After Laughter (Comes Tears)â€™ by Wendy RenÃ©\n\nThereâ€™s not really much to this one, other than a reminder that misery is eternal and inevitable and though you might be happy now, youâ€™ll end up crying later. Coupled with a mournful earworm of a vocal hook (later sampled by Wu-Tang Clan) and some muted Booker T organ work, that was all the late Wendy RenÃ© needed to record this tragic classic. She retired from music three years later, turning to religion after the sudden death of her friend and Stax labelmate Otis Redding.\n\n48. â€˜Symphony of Sorrowful Songs, 2, Lento e Largoâ€™ by Henryk Gorecki\n\nEver been stuck in a temp job spending your working hours constantly picking over everything that youâ€™ve done wrong in your life? I have. My solution was spending a lot of time on Last.fm listening to minimalist composers. When I got to Goreckiâ€™s â€˜Symphony of Sorrowful Songsâ€™, it sounded like the world collapsing in on me. Listening back to it now, itâ€™s almost too grandiose and heartbreaking to be relatable. But sometimes thatâ€™s really how bad you feel. Eddy Frankel\n\nAdvertising\n\n49. â€˜I Love Creedenceâ€™ by Casiotone For The Painfully Alone\n\nOwen Ashworthâ€™s solo project was aptly named, specialising in wrenching portraits of millennial misery â€“ like Girls without the jokes â€“ mumbled in too-tired-for-suicide baritone over chintzy 8-bit keyboard beats. But Ashworthâ€™s observational skill keeps his output firmly on the tragic side of twee. â€˜â€¦Creedenceâ€™ is a perfect example: a love friendship between two women is left to slip away into a permanent friend zone, while the narrator ekes out a loveless living as a lawyerâ€™s typist."
