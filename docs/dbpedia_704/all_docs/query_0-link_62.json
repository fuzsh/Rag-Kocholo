Who doesn't adore the iconic line “When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible” from “When Harry Met Sally”?\n\nYour beloved bookworm will cherish a sweet text from you with a quote from one of literature's greatest love stories.\n\nHere are some of the best love quotes for him from books, movies, music and more.\n\nBest Love Quotes for Him\n\n“In all the world, there is no heart for me like yours.
