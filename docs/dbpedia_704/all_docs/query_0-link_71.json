        "text": "A good love makes your heart soar, fills your stomach with butterflies, and fills your head with pictures of a future together. But a bad love can leave you broken and wishing you'd never known this person in the first place.\n\nWhat’s worse is that we don’t always know when the person we love is actually bad for us. Sometimes we think that’s just how love is supposed to be. Or maybe you are \"accepting the love you think you deserve,\" as author Stephen Chbosky once said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a perfect world, we’d all have and know only that kind of love all the time — but we don’t live in a perfect world. So sometimes, we fall in love with someone who does more harm than good.\n\nThings might get to a point where we just can't take it anymore and the only thing to do is leave. And when we finally find the strength to do that, only then do we see just how badly they treated us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout an understanding friend to lean on, heartbreak can feel really lonely. When there's no one else to talk to, sad but inspirational love quotes are reassuring. Take, for instance, Sylvia Plath's quote, “Perhaps someday I’ll crawl back home, beaten, defeated. But not as long as I can make stories out of my heartbreak, beauty out of sorrow.”\n\nSometimes it takes sad quotes to make us realize that love is the greatest and most painful force on earth. The saddest quotes strike a chord with anyone experiencing heartache. Like Meredith Taylor's words, \"My heart no longer felt as if it belonged to me. It now felt as it had been stolen, torn from my chest by someone who wanted no part of it.”\n\nBut wise words about breakups can also come in the form of empowering quotes that encourage you to pick yourself back up when you're feeling broken.\n\nHere are 65 “no more love” quotes about the heartbreak of giving up on a relationship with someone you love.\n\n1. \"I'm tired of fighting. For once I want to be fought for.\"\n\n2. \"The moment you start to wonder if you deserve better, you do.\" — David Williams\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"Nothing hurts more than being disappointed by the single person you thought would never hurt you.\" — Ayo Makun\n\n4. \"Someone shouldn't need to be faced with your absence to value your presence.\" — Nitya Prakash\n\n5. \"There is a difference between giving up and knowing when you have had enough.\" — Joanne Reed\n\n6. \"Apology accepted.
