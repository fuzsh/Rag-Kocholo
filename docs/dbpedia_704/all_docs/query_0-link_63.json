Going through the dissolution of a marriage or a disappointing romantic relationship can often feel intensely painful. Many women over 60 are learning how to re-engage with their sense of self-worth and self-love.\n\nRead 5 SELF-LOVE TIPS TO AGEING WITH CONFIDENCE AND JOY.\n\nSome women said that they could not imagine being loved again.

Some women commented that they aren’t even looking, because they don’t want to have to take care of a man and would rather just take care of themselves.\n\nOther women said that even though they realize that they do not “need” a man to make them happy, they would like to find someone to share their lives with.\n\nRead DATING AFTER 60: FINDING A BALANCE BETWEEN INTIMACY AND INDEPENDENCE.\n\nLove Has New Meaning for Women Over 60\n\nOne challenge of dating over 60 is that the whole concept of romantic relationships has a different meaning at this stage of life. When the traditional roles have gone away, women over 60 are looking for different things in a man than we might have wanted when we were in our 20s, 30s, or 40s.\n\nMost women our age are interested in finding a man who shares mutual interests, common dreams, and a common worldview. We want to be appreciated and have someone with whom to share adventures and laughter.\n\nWe are no longer looking for a relationship with the goal of having children and building a “home” together. Dating over 60 is often more about having fun and finding a partnership of equals. This can be positive or negative depending on what you want from a relationship.\n\nSome women enjoy the fun of meeting new people and going on casual dates, while others might find casual dating to be lonely or disappointing.\n\nRead AM I READY TO DATE AGAIN? 10 QUESTIONS TO HELP YOU DECIDE.\n\nSome women might distrust the motives of men who have been divorced multiple times, or who seem needy or inattentive.

See our Top 5 Best Dating Sites For Seniors.\n\nOther women have met good men at church or in community organizations, or just while out walking in the park. Another option is to simply go to the places you love and do the things you love to do. Any man who shares your interests is likely to be frequenting the same places.\n\nAnother idea that is gaining in popularity is to hire a dating coach. If you are willing to invest some time and money in personal sessions with a dating coach, you might find better matches faster. At the same time, you can learn a lot about yourself, your preferences, and your life goals along the way.\n\nRead DATING OVER 60: *HOT!* ADVICE FROM 2 DATING COACHES (ONE MALE, ONE FEMALE) YOU NEED TO KNOW!\n\nAnd 5 THINGS TO LOOK FOR IN A SENIOR DATING COACH OR AGENCY.\n\nPractice a Virtual Flirt with Men from Your Past\n\nSocial media has opened wonderful doors for connection, so don’t be afraid to look up a single high school friend and even consider attending your next reunion or class event. Use LinkedIn or Facebook to casually say hi to interesting men you’ve met at events. You will find out soon enough if they are married or committed, so for now, just be friendly and see what happens.\n\nLet single girlfriends know that you are actively looking for a relationship – maybe they know someone who is perfect for you!\n\nAttend a Meetup and Share Your Passions\n\nMany cities have an organization called Meetup. You can join groups for everything you can possibly imagine including hiking, art, photography, travel, or dining out. They also have events for men and women our age and can be a great opportunity to meet new people, whether you are looking for love or not.\n\nMen Struggle to Find Love after 60 Too\n\nOften the conversation about dating over 60 focuses on the idea that women are at an inherent disadvantage with too many eligible women our age chasing too few good men. While this is true, men our age are often struggling with the same types of worries, doubts, and negative feelings that women might have.\n\nBefore your first date, try to understand the psychology of an older man – he is also probably feeling a bit nervous, hesitant, and afraid of rejection. So start a conversation, flirt a little, laugh a lot, and be feminine and fun.\n\nDon’t feel like you have to control the whole date, drive conversation, or make all the plans – try to help him feel competent and comfortable. Dating should not be a power struggle! Be spontaneous and go with the flow.\n\nWhen I interviewed David Wygant, he pointed out that men want to feel appreciated too. They want to feel desirable and honored. They want to feel you recognize they have something valuable to offer, whether it’s conversation, companionship, or shared interests.\n\nEnjoy each other’s company and try to find something to admire about every man you meet. Even if it’s not a “love connection,” take the attitude that there are plenty of fish in the sea. Here’s my interview with David.\n\nWhat Do Men Over 60 Really Want?\n\nIt’s time to set the record straight. Here’s the deal. Most men do want to be in a relationship with women closer to their age. This is because they share a common history with each other. Most men do try out younger women because they feel appreciated by them, something they don’t always feel from women their own age.\n\nYou see, men want to be your hero. It’s literally in their DNA coding to keep you safe, protected, and provided for. They want to make you happy and will do anything within their power to make that happen for you.\n\nSee also: What Do Single Men Over 60 Really Want?

These two phrases will bring out the hero response in a man. They work very well when you need him to do something for you.\n\nPhrase #1 is “I need your help…” then ask for what you need.\n\nPhrase #2 is “Could you do me a favor…” then ask for what you need.\n\nWhen I’ve used these phrases, I’ve had men tell me they love helping a woman who needs their help. Try it. It will make a huge difference with the men in your life.\n\nDespite the Challenges, Women Over 60 Haven’t Given up on Love\n\nPerhaps the most encouraging sign from our Sixty and Me community is that the vast majority of women over 60 seem to be optimistic about the prospect for love in their lives. This can take the form of a marriage, a committed relationship, or just walking down the street holding hands with someone special.\n\nLove can be part of your life at any age. Hopefully, we all can be brave, confident, and open to possibilities, and willing to take a chance on letting love into our hearts once more.\n\nRead more articles about dating as women over 50:\n\nTHE PROS AND CONS OF DATING AS A BOOMER WOMAN.\n\nSENIOR DATING TIPS: WHY YOU SHOULDN’T GIVE UP UNTIL THE 6TH DATE.\n\nLOVE AFTER 50: CAN REJECTION BE A BLESSING IN DISGUISE?\n\nLet’s Have a Conversation:"
