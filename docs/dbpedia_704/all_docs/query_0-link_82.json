        "text": "There‚Äôs nothing quite so moving as beautiful love poems. Luckily for us romantics, they‚Äôve been in abundant supply throughout history! From Rumi in the Islamic Golden Age, to iconic playwright William Shakespeare, to modern-day ‚ÄúInstapoets‚Äù like Rupi Kaur, love has been one of the most-explored themes among writers and poets for centuries.\n\nIn this post, we‚Äôve put together the 65 most beautiful love poems ever written. Whether you‚Äôre looking for something to share with your partner, seeking solace after a breakup, or craving inspiration for how to write your own passionate prose, there‚Äôs bound to be a poem on this list which speaks to your heart.\n\nWondering which love poem you are? Take our 30-second quiz to find out.\n\nüìö\n\nWhich love poem are YOU?\n\nDiscover which poem best fits you in this quiz. Takes 30 seconds!\n\n1. ‚ÄúCome, And Be My Baby‚Äù by Maya Angelou\n\nMaya Angelou was one of America‚Äôs most acclaimed poets and storytellers, as well as a celebrated educator and civil rights activist. In ‚ÄòCome, And Be My Baby‚Äô, Angelou beautifully captures how overwhelming modern life can be and the comfort that love can provide during times of hardship ‚Äî even if only for a moment.\n\n2. \"Bird-Understander\" by Craig Arnold\n\nThese are your own words\n\nyour way of noticing\n\nand saying plainly\n\nof not turning away\n\nfrom hurt\n\nyou have offered them\n\nto me I am only\n\ngiving them back\n\nif only I could show you\n\nhow very useless\n\nthey are not\n\nThe raw honesty of Craig Arnold‚Äôs poetry makes ‚ÄòBird-Understander‚Äô an easy pick for our list of the most beautiful love poems. In this piece, Arnold recounts a moment with his partner that makes his love grow even stronger. The language is simple yet evocative, putting a strong metaphor in the reader‚Äôs mind and facilitating a deeper understanding of Arnold‚Äôs feelings.\n\n3. \"Habitation\" by Margaret Atwood\n\nat the back where we squat\n\noutside, eating popcorn\n\nthe edge of the receding glacier\n\nwhere painfully and with wonder\n\nat having survived even\n\nthis far\n\nwe are learning to make fire\n\nBest known for her alarmingly realistic dystopian novel The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, Margaret Atwood demonstrates similar strengths in this poem: ‚ÄòHabitation‚Äô is strikingly real. For context, Atwood here admits to the challenges of marriage and acknowledges the work needed to overcome them. It is this candor which makes the poem so beautiful.\n\n4. \"Variations on the Word Love\" by Margaret Atwood\n\nOne of the most fascinating things about love is that it can come in so many different forms ‚Äî platonic, passionate, or even patronizing. Margaret Atwood unflinchingly lays out some of these in her poem ‚ÄòVariations on the Word Love‚Äô.\n\n5. \"The More Loving One\" by W.H. Auden\n\nWere all stars to disappear or die,\n\nI should learn to look at an empty sky\n\nAnd feel its total dark sublime,\n\nThough this might take me a little time.\n\nWhilst poems about heartbreak might not be as uplifting as those about the joys of love, they can be equally as beautiful and meaningful. The celestial extended metaphor of W.H. Auden‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe More Loving One‚Äô demonstrates this ‚Äî though ultimately he would rather be ‚Äòthe more loving one‚Äô himself, Auden perfectly encapsulates the pain of loss when love ends.\n\nLooking for something new to read?\n\nTrust real people, not robots, to give you book recommendations.\n\nOr sign up with an email address\n\n6. \"To My Dear and Loving Husband\" by Anne Bradstreet\n\nThy love is such I can no way repay;\n\nThe heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.\n\nThen while we live, in love let‚Äôs so persever,\n\nThat when we live no more, we may live ever.\n\nAnne Bradstreet‚Äôs Puritan belief that marriage is a gift from God comes across strongly in ‚ÄòTo My Dear and Loving Husband.‚Äô Reading it through a modern lens, it‚Äôs easy to start the poem feeling a little skeptical; however, Bradstreet‚Äôs genuine gratitude and dedication to her husband soon manifests to make it a deeply moving assertion of true love.\n\n7. \"Always For The First Time\" by Andr√© Breton\n\nThere is a silk ladder unrolled across the ivy\n\nThere is\n\nThat leaning over the precipice\n\nOf the hopeless fusion of your presence and absence\n\nI have found the secret\n\nOf loving you\n\nAlways for the first time\n\n‚ÄòAlways For The First Time‚Äô is Andr√© Breton‚Äôs ode to a woman he has not met, but is willing to wait every day for. Breton was the French founder of the surrealist movement, which aimed to blur the lines between dreams and reality in art ‚Äî explaining the rather whimsical nature of this beautiful love poem.\n\n8. \"Love and Friendship\" by Emily Bront√´\n\nLove doesn‚Äôt have to be confined to romance ‚Äî love between friends can be just as strong and beautiful. In ‚ÄòLove and Friendship‚Äô, Emily Bront√´ compares romantic love to a rose ‚Äî stunning but short-lived ‚Äî and friendship to a holly tree which can endure all seasons.\n\n9. \"To Be In Love\" by Gwendolyn Brooks\n\nNext on our list of the most beautiful poems about love is ‚ÄòTo Be in Love‚Äô by Gwendolyn Brooks. Brooks was a poet, author, and teacher ‚Äî and perhaps most notably, in 1950, was also the first African-American writer to receive a Pulitzer Prize. In this powerful poem, Brooks conveys the intense emotions which come with falling in love and how it can change your entire outlook on life.\n\nTo be in love\n\nIs to touch with a lighter hand.\n\nIn yourself you stretch, you are well.\n\n10. \"How Do I Love Thee? (Sonnet 43)\" by Elizabeth Barrett Browning\n\nHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\n\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\n\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\n\nFor the ends of being and ideal grace.\n\nElizabeth Barrett Browning was a renowned Victorian poet who influenced the work of many later English-language poets, including Emily Dickinson. ‚ÄòHow Do I Love Thee?‚Äô is one of Browning‚Äôs most recognizable poems, and indeed one of the most famous love poems ever written ‚Äî its ardent yet clear declaration of love has resonated with readers for over 150 years.\n\n11. \"A Red, Red Rose\" by Robert Burns\n\nSimilar to Browning, Robert Burns‚Äô profound love is evident in his poem ‚ÄòA Red, Red Rose‚Äô. Burns declares this love to be both passionate and refreshing ‚Äî with each comparison, we see that even the loveliest language pales next to the depth of Burns‚Äô ‚ÄòLuve‚Äô.\n\n12. \"She Walks in Beauty\" by Lord Byron\n\nShe walks in beauty, like the night\n\nOf cloudless climes and starry skies;\n\nAnd all that‚Äôs best of dark and bright\n\nMeet in her aspect and her eyes;\n\nThus mellowed to that tender light\n\nWhich heaven to gaudy day denies.\n\nThough its author was known for a life of adventure and scandal, Lord Byron‚Äôs poem ‚ÄòShe Walks in Beauty‚Äô refers notably less to passionate or sexual love compared to his other works. That said, his astonishment at this woman‚Äôs beauty comes across instantly, making this a beautifully romantic poem.\n\n13. \"Love is a fire that burns unseen\" by Lu√≠s Vaz de Cam√µes\n\nLove is a fire that burns unseen,\n\na wound that aches yet isn‚Äôt felt,\n\nan always discontent contentment,\n\na pain that rages without hurting,\n\nOne of Portugal‚Äôs greatest poets, Lu√≠s Vaz de Cam√µes is known for his lyrical poetry and dramatic epics. ‚ÄòLove is a fire that burns unseen‚Äô is an example of the former, reflecting his numerous turbulent love affairs and how each brought a complex fusion of pleasure and pain.\n\n14. \"Beautiful Signor\" by Cyrus Cassells\n\nThis is the endless wanderlust:\n\ndervish,\n\nyours is the April-upon-April love\n\nthat kept me spinning even beyond your eventful arms\n\ntoward the unsurpassed:\n\nthe one vast claiming heart,\n\nthe glimmering,\n\nthe beautiful and revealed Signor.\n\n‚ÄòBeautiful Signor‚Äô is an entry from Cyrus Cassells‚Äô poetry collection of the same name, which he dedicated to ‚ÄòLovers everywhere‚Äô. Culturally set against the backdrop of the AIDS epidemic, the collection aims to remind people of the potent beauty of romantic love.\n\n15. \"Rondel of Merciless Beauty\" by Geoffrey Chaucer\n\nUpon my word, I tell you faithfully\n\nThrough life and after death you are my queen;\n\nFor with my death the whole truth shall be seen.\n\nYour two great eyes will slay me suddenly;\n\nTheir beauty shakes me who was once serene;\n\nStraight through my heart the wound is quick and keen.\n\nWidely regarded as the ‚ÄòFather of English poetry‚Äô, Geoffrey Chaucer wrote some of the most renowned works of the English language, including ‚ÄòThe Canterbury Tales‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Book of the Duchess‚Äô. The standalone poem ‚ÄòRondel of Merciless Beauty‚Äô (here translated from Middle English) recounts Chaucer‚Äôs heartbreak after being left by the love of his life, pledging his everlasting devotion to her even though it pains him.\n\n16. \"Love Comes Quietly\" by Robert Creeley\n\nRobert Creeley‚Äôs short but striking love poem aptly summarizes the feeling of never wanting to be apart from the person you love, almost making you forget what life was like before you met them.\n\n17. \"[i carry your heart with me(i carry it in]\" by E. E. Cummings\n\ni carry your heart with me(i carry it in\n\nmy heart)i am never without it(anywhere\n\ni go you go,my dear;and whatever is done\n\nby only me is your doing,my darling)\n\nAs one of America‚Äôs most prolific twentieth century poets, E.E. Cummings needs no introduction. Many of his poems centered around love and ‚Äò[i carry your heart with me(i carry it in]‚Äô is perhaps the best-known of them all. The rich imagery and intimate infatuation earns it a prominent spot on our list of the most beautiful love poems ever written.\n\n18. \"[love is more thicker than forget]\" by E.E. Cummings\n\nlove is more thicker than forget\n\nmore thinner than recall\n\nmore seldom than a wave is wet\n\nmore frequent than to fail\n\nAnother brilliant example of Cummings‚Äô love poetry is [love is more thicker than forget]. This poem explores the complexity of love, expressing that it cannot simply be defined as one thing or another ‚Äî and indeed, painting love as a paradox of rarity and frequency, modesty and profundity, sanity and madness, and much more.\n\n19. \"Sthandwa sami (my beloved, isiZulu)\" by Yrsa Daley-Ward\n\nmy thoughts about you are frightening but precise\n\nI can see the house on the hill where we make our own vegetables out back\n\nand drink warm wine out of jam jars\n\nand sing songs in the kitchen until the sun comes up\n\nwena you make me feel like myself again.\n\nYrsa Daley-Ward‚Äôs ‚ÄòSthandwa sami (my beloved, isiZulu)‚Äô is one of the most personal and revealing accounts of love on this list. The poem comes from her collection bone, which tackles some of the deepest aspects of humanity, including religion, desire, womanhood, race, and vulnerability.\n\n20. \"Married Love\" by Guan Daosheng\n\nYou and I\n\nHave so much love,\n\nThat it\n\nBurns like a fire,\n\nIn which we bake a lump of clay\n\nMolded into a figure of you\n\nAnd a figure of me.\n\nGuan Daosheng was a Chinese painter and poet of the early Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). ‚ÄòMarried Love‚Äô uses the image of clay figurines to represent two lovers being united as one through the sacred act of marriage, just as clay solidifies in a kiln.\n\n21. \"Heart, we will forget him!\" by Emily Dickinson\n\nHeart, we will forget him!\n\nYou and I, to-night!\n\nYou may forget the warmth he gave,\n\nI will forget the light.\n\n‚ÄòHeart, we will forget him!‚Äô aligns with the forceful nature of so many Emily Dickinson poems. It is a powerful reflection of the fallout after a passionate love affair and how she tried to move on, going so far as to command her heart to do so, even knowing it‚Äôs futile.\n\n22. \"Air and Angels\" by John Donne\n\nJohn Donne‚Äôs work is known for tackling faith and salvation, as well as both human and divine love. In ‚ÄòAngels and Air‚Äô, Donne compares his love to the movement of angels ‚Äî pure and elegant. His conclusion that two lovers can come together and grow stronger adds another layer to this already quite romantic poem.\n\n23. \"Flirtation\" by Rita Dove\n\nOutside the sun\n\nhas rolled up her rugs\n\nand night strewn salt\n\nacross the sky. My heart\n\nis humming a tune\n\nI haven‚Äôt heard in years!\n\nThe sparkling flirtation at the start of a new relationship is surely one of the most exciting parts of love. ‚ÄòFlirtation‚Äô by Rita Dove eloquently captures this joy and anticipation, and is one of the most relatable poems about this aspect of love.\n\n24. \"Heart to Heart\" by Rita Dove\n\nIt‚Äôs neither red\n\nnor sweet.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt melt\n\nor turn over,\n\nbreak or harden,\n\nso it can‚Äôt feel\n\npain,\n\nyearning,\n\nregret.\n\nIn ‚ÄòHeart to Heart‚Äô, Rita Dove rejects the typical clich√©s that come with falling in love. With her down-to-earth approach to the topic, she assures the intended reader that although she may struggle to show her love, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not there.\n\n25. \"Love\" by Carol Ann Duffy\n\nyou‚Äôre where I stand, hearing the sea, crazy\n\nfor the shore, seeing the moon ache and fret\n\nfor the earth. When morning comes, the sun, ardent,\n\ncovers the trees in gold, you walk\n\ntowards me,\n\nout of the season, out of the light love reasons.\n\nIn 2009, Carol Ann Duffy made history when she was appointed the first female and openly lesbian British poet laureate. ‚ÄòLove‚Äô is a perfect example of the monologue-style poems she is known for, fitting in with her usual sensory and emotional style of writing; here, she describes love as beautifully boundless, like the light of the sun or the crashing sound of waves.\n\n26. \"The Love Poem\" by Carol Ann Duffy\n\n‚ÄòThe Love Poem‚Äô takes a different tack, depicting Duffy‚Äôs struggle to find the right words to describe her love. It comes from her 2005 collection Rapture, which charts the speaker‚Äôs journey through a love affair; at this stage, Duffy gets metafictional about love poetry, striving to explain the challenges of writing it (and invoking several other famous poems along the way).\n\n27. \"Before You Came\" by Faiz Ahmed Faiz\n\nDon‚Äôt leave now that you‚Äôre here‚Äî\n\nStay. So the world may become like itself again:\n\nso the sky may by the sky,\n\nthe road a road,\n\nand the glass of wine not a mirror, just a glass of wine.\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz wrote of love, politics, and community throughout his tumultuous life, and has been especially acknowledged for his contributions to traditional Urdu poetry. In ‚ÄòBefore You Came‚Äô, Faiz writes about how his perspective on life changed after falling in love and how he never wants to be without his lover, who helps him see things as they truly are.\n\n28. \"Lines Depicting Simple Happiness\" by Peter Gizzi\n\nIt feels right to notice all the shiny things about you\n\nAbout you there is nothing I wouldn‚Äôt want to know\n\nWith you nothing is simple yet nothing is simpler\n\nAbout you many good things come into relation\n\nThe beauty in Peter Gizzi‚Äôs poetry stems from its simplicity. In ‚ÄòLines Depicting Simple Happiness‚Äô, Gizzi‚Äôs adoration for his love is clear ‚Äî however, he avoids overused clich√©s, meaning the poem is both more personal and less mawkish than other modern love poems.\n\n29. \"Six Sonnets: Crossing the West\" by Janice Gould\n\nIn that communion of lovers, thick sobs\n\nbreak from me as I think of my love\n\nback home, all that I have done\n\nand cannot say. This is the first time\n\nI have left her so completely, so alone.\n\nJanice Gould‚Äôs work homes in on themes of love and connection, with strong links to her identity as a Maidu lesbian. In ‚ÄòSix Sonnets: Crossing the West‚Äô, Gould equates her lover to a dream, never running short on ethereal ways to describe her... and mourning when she slips away, even temporarily.\n\n30. \"For Keeps\" by Joy Harjo\n\nContrasting love with the beauty of nature helps to create an unbreakable bond between the two. This comparison helps illustrate Joy Harjo‚Äôs feelings for her lover in her marvelous poem, ‚ÄòFor Keeps‚Äô.\n\n31. \"You Are the Penultimate Love of My Life\" by Rebecca Hazelton\n\nThe garden you plant and I plant\n\nis tunneled through by voles,\n\nthe vowels\n\nwe speak aren‚Äôt vows,\n\nbut there‚Äôs something\n\nholding me here, for now,\n\nlike your eyes, which I suppose\n\nare brown, after all.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYou Are the Penultimate Love of My Life‚Äô is an unorthodox love poem, focusing on the realities rather than the fantasies of being in love. Rebecca Hazelton isn‚Äôt writing about her soulmate, and she‚Äôs aware of that ‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt make the love they share any less special.\n\n32. \"Yours\" by Daniel Hoffman\n\nI am yours as the summer air at evening is\n\nPossessed by the scent of linden blossoms,\n\nAs the snowcap gleams with light\n\nLent it by the brimming moon.\n\nWithout you I‚Äôd be an unleaded tree\n\nBlasted in a bleakness with no Spring.\n\nDaniel Hoffman‚Äôs carefully chosen metaphors make ‚ÄòYours‚Äô a truly beautiful love poem. Hoffman‚Äôs complete dedication to his lover is obvious ‚Äî in comparing her to everything from summer evenings to snow-capped mountains, it seems he cannot stop thinking about her throughout the changing seasons.\n\n33. \"A Love Song for Lucinda\" by Langston Hughes\n\nLove\n\nIs a high mountain\n\nStark in a windy sky.\n\nIf you\n\nWould never lose your breath\n\nDo not climb too high.\n\nEach stanza of Langston Hughes‚Äô ‚ÄòA Love Song for Lucinda‚Äô compares love to a specific feeling, all of which are linked to the natural world. This poem emphasizes the exhilaration of falling in love and the all-encompassing enchantment that comes with it.\n\n34. \"Poem for My Love\" by June Jordan\n\nPolitical activist, poet, and essayist June Jordan is one of the most widely-published Jamaican American writers of her generation. In her ‚ÄòPoem for My Love‚Äô, the speaker is in absolute spiritual awe of her partner and the way she feels about their transcendent love.\n\n35. \"for him\" by Rupi Kaur\n\nno,\n\nit won‚Äôt\n\nbe love at\n\nfirst sight when\n\nwe meet it‚Äôll be love\n\nat first remembrance\n\n‚Äòcause i‚Äôve recognized you\n\nin my mother‚Äôs eyes when she tells me,\n\nmarry the type of man you‚Äôd want to raise your son to be like.\n\nAt just 21 years old, Rupi Kaur wrote, illustrated, and self-published her first poetry collection, milk and honey. She describes her poetry as ‚Äòsimple and accessible‚Äô ‚Äî which has allowed it to reach millions of readers worldwide, particularly through Instagram presence. ‚Äòfor him‚Äô is a perfect example of a beautiful, powerful love poem which doesn‚Äôt have to try too hard to pack a punch.\n\n36. Untitled by Rupi Kaur\n\nlove will hurt you but\n\nlove will never mean to\n\nlove will play no games\n\ncause love knows life\n\nhas been hard enough already\n\nAnother entry from milk and honey, this short, untitled poem takes a bittersweet and world weary, but ultimately generous look at love and its challenges.\n\n37. \"Poem To An Unnameable Man\" by Dorothea Lasky\n\nAnd I will not cry also\n\nAlthough you will expect me to\n\nI was wiser too than you had expected\n\nFor I knew all along you were mine\n\nProlific poet Dorothea Lasky has written multiple collections and currently directs the poetry programme at Columbia University. In ‚ÄòPoem To An Unnameable Man‚Äô, she uses celestial imagery to explore a romantic relationship, describing her power and strength to the lover who underestimates her.\n\n38. \"Movement Song\" by Audre Lorde\n\n‚ÄòMovement Song‚Äô by Audre Lorde is about the end of a relationship. While the sorrow felt after the speaker‚Äôs heart has been broken is clear, the poem ultimately ends with hope that the pair can both have a new beginning ‚Äî albeit apart.\n\n39. \"Camomile Tea\" by Katherine Mansfield\n\nWe might be fifty, we might be five,\n\nSo snug, so compact, so wise are we!\n\nUnder the kitchen-table leg\n\nMy knee is pressing against his knee.\n\nOur shutters are shut, the fire is low,\n\nThe tap is dripping peacefully;\n\nThe saucepan shadows on the wall\n\nAre black and round and plain to see.\n\nKatherine Mansfield has been praised for her ability to simplify complex emotions through short stories and poetry. One of the more tranquil poems on this list, ‚ÄòCamomile Tea‚Äô paints a picture of a couple who are calm and quiet and happy with the life they‚Äôve made for themselves, highlighting the underrated joy that peaceful familiarity and comfort can bring in a relationship.\n\n40. \"Love Elegy in the Chinese Garden, with Koi\" by Nathan McClain\n\nBecause who hasn‚Äôt done that ‚Äî\n\nloved so intently even after everything\n\nhas gone? Love something that has washed\n\nits hands of you? I like to think I‚Äôm different now,\n\nthat I‚Äôm enlightened somehow,\n\nbut who am I kidding?\n\nNathan McClain‚Äôs inspiration for ‚ÄòLove Elegy in the Chinese Garden, with Koi‚Äô was a date to the Huntington Botanical Gardens. In the poem, McClain aimed to ‚Äòexplore the sense of anxiety‚Äô between two potential lovers, and the weighty emotional baggage that previous failed relationships can bestow upon you.\n\n41. \"I think I should have loved you presently (Sonnet IX)\" by Edna St. Vincent Millay\n\nI think I should have loved you presently,\n\nAnd given in earnest words I flung in jest;\n\nAnd lifted honest eyes for you to see,\n\nAnd caught your hand against my cheek and breast;\n\nAnd all my pretty follies flung aside\n\nThat won you to me, and beneath you gaze\n\nEdna St. Vincent Millay‚Äôs ‚ÄòI think I should have loved you presently‚Äô serves as a subversion of the traditional sonnet form. In the poem, the speaker laments their inability to reciprocate their lover‚Äôs earnest affection, instead choosing sweet nothings and superficial flirtation over genuine connection.\n\n42. \"Love Sonnet XI\" by Pablo Neruda\n\nI crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.\n\nSilent and starving, I prowl through the streets.\n\nBread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts\n\nme, all day\n\nI hunt for the liquid measure of your steps.\n\nThere is a strong sense of longing in Pablo Neruda‚Äôs ‚ÄòLove Sonnet XI‚Äô, as our speaker confesses the thought of his love never leaves his mind, driving him to the point of distraction. Evocative and at times alarming, it's a love poem which perfectly treads the blurred line between romance and obsession.\n\n43. \"Your Feet\" by Pablo Neruda\n\nIn ‚ÄòYour Feet‚Äô, Neruda expresses a similar devotion to his love as he explains his love for her from head to toe, and gives thanks for the forces he feels brought them together inevitably.\n\n44. \"Dear One Absent This Long While\" by Lisa Olstein\n\nI expect you. I thought one night it was you\n\nat the base of the drive, you at the foot of the stairs\n\nyou in a shiver of light, but each time\n\nleaves in wind revealed themselves,\n\nthe retreating shadow of a fox, daybreak.\n\nWe expect you, cat and I, bluebirds and I, the stove.\n\nThe speaker in Lisa Olstein‚Äôs ‚ÄòDear One Absent This Long While‚Äô is anxiously waiting for her loved one to return home. The nervous buzz of anticipation as the speaker waits to return to a life of comfort and mundanity, a puzzle from which their lover is the only missing piece, gives this love poem a beautiful raw honesty.\n\n45. \"My Lover Is a Woman\" by Pat Parker\n\nmy lover is a woman\n\n& when i hold her\n\nfeel her warmth\n\ni feel good\n\nfeel safe\n\nPat Parker was an American poet and activist who drew great inspiration from her life as an African-American lesbian feminist. ‚ÄòMy Lover Is a Woman‚Äô is about the struggles Parker faced as an openly queer woman of colour, and the safe harbour her lover represents in that storm.\n\n46. \"It Is Here\" by Harold Pinter\n\nWhat is this stance we take,\n\nTo turn away and then turn back?\n\nWhat did we hear?\n\nIt was the breath we took when we first met.\n\nListen. It is here.\n\nRelationships have a funny way of transcending time and space, and that transcendence isexpressed in Harold Pinter‚Äôs beautiful love poem ‚ÄòIt Is Here‚Äô as he asks his lover to think back to the beginning of their relationship, and in doing so brings the long-passed moment to life.\n\n47. \"Untitled\" by Christopher Poindexter\n\nI miss you even when you\n\nare beside me.\n\nI dream of your body\n\neven when you are sleeping\n\nin my arms.\n\nThe words I love you\n\ncould never be enough.\n\nChristopher Poindexter here presents a deeply honest and relatable portrait of a love that goes beyond the limits of language, as he describes the overwhelming and paradoxical longing it‚Äôs possible to feel even when your lover is right by your side.\n\n48. ‚ÄúLove Is Not A Word‚Äù by Riyas Qurana\n\nAmidst all this\n\nI keep a falling flower in the mid-air\n\nNot to fall on the earth\n\nIs it not up to you who search for it\n\nTo come and sit on it\n\nAnd make love?\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to bring the word\n\nDarling\n\nWhen you come.\n\nWritten from the point of view of a personified love, ‚ÄúLove Is Not A Word‚Äù is a rather ambiguous poem. Riyas Qurana explores the notion of love as a whole and relates the concept to nature to emphasize how elemental it is to the human experience.\n\n49. \"[Again and again, even though we know love‚Äôs landscape]\" by Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nAgain and again, even though we know love‚Äôs landscape\n\nand the little churchyard with its lamenting names\n\nand the terrible reticent gorge in which the others\n\nend: again and again the two of us walk out together\n\nunder the ancient trees, lay ourselves down again and\n\nagain\n\namong the flowers, and look up into the sky.\n\nAustrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke believed that it was ‚Äòperhaps the most difficult of all our tasks‚Äô for one human to love another (Letters to a Young Poet, 1929). In ‚Äò[Again and again, even though we know love‚Äôs landscape]‚Äô, Rilke celebrates the continuous, everyday love that two people can share, and the strength that comes from making one vulnerable enough to love another, despite knowing the risk of heartbreak.\n\n50. \"Echo\" by Christina Rossetti\n\nIn ‚ÄòEcho‚Äô, Christina Rossetti reflects on a lost love and how she wishes it would come back to her like an echo. Rossetti is in despair, longing for her ex-lover, and the resulting yearning creates an equally heartbreaking and beautiful love poem.\n\n51. \"I loved you first: but afterwards your love\" by Christina Rossetti\n\nI loved you first: but afterwards your love\n\nOutsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song\n\nAs drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.\n\nWhich owes the other most? my love was long,\n\nAnd yours one moment seemed to wax more strong\n\nDespite a concern with reciprocity (or a lack thereof) in these opening lines, a feeling of ‚Äòoneness‚Äô in fact runs throughout ‚ÄòI loved you first: but afterwards your love‚Äô, also by Rossetti. This poem reflects the feeling of complete understanding between two people who love each other deeply, as Rossetti explains how their individual feelings combine to create one love, a whole greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n52. \"Defeated by Love\" by Rumi\n\nThe sky was lit\n\nby the splendor of the moon\n\nSo powerful\n\nI fell to the ground\n\nYour love\n\nhas made me sure\n\nI am ready to forsake\n\nthis worldly life\n\nand surrender\n\nto the magnificence\n\nof your Bering\n\nThe words of 13th-century Persian poet Rumi have transcended national, ethnic, and religious divides for centuries. The passion and dedication in ‚ÄòDefeated by Love‚Äô is apparent in each line, making this enduring testament to the power of love one of the most beautiful love poems on our list.\n\n53. \"Shall I compare thee to a summer‚Äôs day? (Sonnet 18)\" by William Shakespeare\n\nAlthough William Shakespeare may not have have written any romance novels, there are few more celebrated love poets and ‚ÄòShall I compare thee to a summer‚Äôs day?‚Äô is perhaps the most iconic and recognizable opening line of any love poem. Its simplicity compared to some of Shakespeare‚Äôs other sonnets makes it stand out against an incomparable library of work, but the hidden depths and layers of meaning in this densely packed mini-masterpiece have kept readers returning for centuries.\n\n54. \"Let me not to the marriage of true minds (Sonnet 116)\" by William Shakespeare\n\nLet me not to the marriage of true minds\n\nAdmit impediments. Love is not love\n\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,\n\nOr bends with the remover to remove.\n\nO no! it is an ever-fixed mark\n\nIn ‚ÄòSonnet 116‚Äô, Shakespeare talks about the permanence of love ‚Äî even if the people change as time goes on, the love between them will remain true and strong, or else it isn‚Äôt love at all.\n\n55. \"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun\" (Sonnet 130) by William Shakespeare\n\nI grant I never saw a goddess go;\n\nMy mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:\n\nAnd yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare\n\nAs any she belied with false compare.\n\nIn Shakespeare‚Äôs final entry on our list, he challenges the traditional association of love with beauty. It doesn‚Äôt matter what his lover looks like ‚Äî to him she is the most rare and valuable thing in the world.\n\n56. \"Love‚Äôs Philosophy\" by Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nThe fountains mingle with the river\n\nAnd the rivers with the ocean,\n\nThe winds of heaven mix forever\n\nWith a sweet emotion;\n\nNothing in the world is single;\n\nAll things by a law divine\n\nIn one spirit meet and mingle\n\nWhy not I with thine?\n\n‚ÄòLove‚Äôs Philosophy‚Äô, while a beautiful love poem, offers a much more logical take on romance than many of the other poems on our list. Percy Bysshe Shelley expresses to his lover that their love is as natural as a river meeting the ocean ‚Äî but equally that all the beauties of nature are meaningless if he doesn‚Äôt have her.\n\n57. \"One Day I Wrote her Name (Sonnet 75)\" by Edmund Spenser\n\nOne day I wrote her name upon the strand,\n\nBut came the waves and washed it away:\n\nAgain I wrote it with a second hand,\n\nBut came the tide, and made my pains his prey.\n\nThis beautiful love poem is part of Amoretti, a sonnet cycle about Edmund Spenser‚Äôs relationship with Elizabeth Boyle. Spenser explains in ‚ÄòSonnet 75‚Äô that ‚Äî despite the seemingly portentous way his attempts to make a physical monument to his lover by writing her name in the sand is repeatedly foiled ‚Äî his love for Boyle will never end, and he will do whatever it takes to make it last.\n\n58. \"I Am Not Yours\" by Sara Teasdale\n\nA longing for genuine, passionate, all-encompassing love is the central theme of Sara Tesdale‚Äôs ‚ÄòI Am Not Yours‚Äô. The speaker doesn‚Äôt feel any sense of belonging in her current relationship, and wants to find a partner who makes her feel lost in their love.\n\n59. \"Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson\n\nNow sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;\n\nNor waves the cypress in the palace walk;\n\nNor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font.\n\nThe firefly wakens; waken thou with me.\n\nNow drops the milk-white peacock like a ghost,\n\nAnd like a ghost she glimmers on to me.\n\n‚ÄòNow Sleeps the Crimson Petal‚Äô is a song from The Princess, a longer, narrative poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. It was inspired by the ghazal, a Persian form of love poetry which focuses on unsustainable love, and is a classic masterclass in sensual description.\n\n60. \"poem I wrote sitting across the table from you\" by Kevin Varrone\n\nI would fold myself\n\ninto the hole in my pocket and disappear\n\ninto the pocket of myself, or at least my pants\n\nbut before I did\n\nlike some ancient star\n\nI‚Äôd grab your hand\n\nKevin Varrone confesses how close he feels to his lover in ‚Äòpoem I wrote sitting across the table from you‚Äô. Written in a moment of procrastination as he worked on a longer verse in a coffee shop, the poem expresses how Varrone wants his lover to partake on all of his adventures, no matter how big or small.\n\n61. \"On Earth We‚Äôre Briefly Gorgeous\" by Ocean Vuong\n\nTell me it was for the hunger\n\n& nothing less. For hunger is to give\n\nthe body what it knows\n\nit cannot keep. That this amber light\n\nwhittled down by another war\n\nis all that pins my hand\n\nto your chest.\n\nWhile you‚Äôre probably familiar with Vuong‚Äôs 2019 novel by the same name, you may not be familiar with the poem that came first. Ocean Vuong‚Äôs writing invites the reader to slow down and understand every word, and ‚ÄòOn Earth We‚Äôre Briefly Gorgeous‚Äô explores themes of desire, impermanence, and craving when in love.\n\n62. \"Love After Love\" by Derek Walcott\n\nYou will love again the stranger who was your self.\n\nGive wine. Give bread. Give back your heart\n\nto itself, to the stranger who has loved you\n\nall your life, whom you ignored\n\nfor another, who knows you by heart.\n\nNobel Prize winning poet Derek Walcott offers advice and reassurance to anyone experiencing a breakup in his poem ‚ÄòLove After Love‚Äô. Encouraging the reader to return to themselves, the poem is a tonic in a world full of love poetry which expects us to hand ourselves over to lovers completely.\n\n63. \"I Love You\" by Ella Wheeler Wilcox\n\nI love your lips when they‚Äôre wet with wine\n\nAnd red with a wild desire;\n\nI love your eyes when the lovelight lies\n\nLit with a passionate fire.\n\nI love your arms when the warm white flesh\n\nTouches mine in a fond embrace;\n\nI love your hair when the strands enmesh\n\nYour kisses against my face.\n\nIn ‚ÄòI Love You‚Äô, Ella Wheeler Wilcox lays out the tiny moments that add up to why the speaker feels so passionately about her love, before going on to describe the colder attributes she‚Äôs not looking for in a relationship. This juxtaposition helps to make the initial love she describes all the more special.\n\n64. \"We Have Not Long to Love\" by Tennessee Williams\n\nThough better known for his plays than as a romance author, Tennessee Williams was also an accomplished poet. In ‚ÄòWe Have Not Long to Love‚Äô Williams stresses the importance of appreciating the time we do have and cherishing the love that comes with it, remembering that nothing will last forever.\n\n65. \"Poem to First Love\" by Matthew Yeager\n\nTo have been told ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù by you could well be, for me,\n\nthe highlight of my life, the best feeling, the best peak\n\non my feeling graph, in the way that the Chrysler building\n\nmight not be the tallest building in the NY sky but is\n\nthe best, the most exquisitely spired\n\nMatthew Yeager‚Äôs ‚ÄòPoem to First Love‚Äô is a bittersweet young romance where, as the title suggests, the speaker is reminiscing about his relationship with his first love, and explores the different ways one might try to logically quantify the utterly illogical force of love.\n\n***\n\nLooking to dive a little deeper into the world of poetry?
