        "text": "Mainer and very famous actor Patrick Demsey and his wife Jillian Demsey recently celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary on July 31st. Throughout the years, it has been reported that even McDreamy has had to work to keep his relationship intact with a possible divorce and reconciliation reported around 2016.\n\nIs there anything more romantic than the characters played by Maine-bred Patrick Dempsey and the real-life celebration of making it last 25 years with a true love? Hard to argue that there would be, so it's a fair proclamation that romantics of Maine are some of the best to know how to make a relationship last forever and always. In fact, a quick Google search shows Maine as the 11th most romantic state in the U.S. Not bad at all.\n\nWe Asked Mainers How to Make a Relationship Last\n\nOf course we did - and here's what some of them had to say. If you also have some words of love wisdom to add, please click the link and comment on the Facebook post.\n\nAugust 3rd my husband and I celebrate 28 years of marriage and 2 more together before. A total of 30 years with each other. Our secret has been, there are no secrets other than gifts or such. Communication. And attention when needed. We both have a few different interests. But we share some as well. Think before you speak! - Lynn from Wilton, ME\n\nBeen with my soulmate Stacy Cochran for 26 years. Honesty and communication are all it takes. Don't give up just because things get difficult. - Albie in Lagrange, ME\n\nI've been married to my high school sweetheart for 32 years. The key for us has been honesty, respect, and communication. He is my best friend. We work hard at having fun together which is a big deal I feel. - Wendy from Waterville, ME\n\nCOMMUNICATION! I've been with my hubby for 16 years, married for 11. We are high school sweethearts. He's my best friend. We talk about everything, and we always know each other's feelings. Even the negative ones. Especially the negative stuff. I am a firm believer in talking about your feelings. Happy spouse happy house. - Raven in Oakland, ME\n\nDon't be the person who goes to work and talks badly about your spouse. In fact, donâ€™t bad mouth them to anyone. The last thing any relationship needs is opinions from the outside because you had a spat. Communicate and work things out between the two of you! - Rachel in Orrington, ME"
