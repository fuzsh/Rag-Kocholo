        "text": "Another prominent private school in the New York area has acknowledged accusations of long-ago sexual abuse of students, joining a small group of schools that have grappled in recent years with claims of abuse that happened decades earlier.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the Hackley School, a 115-year-old prep school in Tarrytown, N.Y., emailed a letter to about 4,000 alumni and parents of current students to inform them that in the early 1960s an employee, “who had a role in teaching” for five years, “engaged in a pattern of abuse of Hackley students.”\n\nThe employee is now dead, the school said.\n\n“We feel keenly the betrayal of students and parents at that time, of our school’s moral purpose, and of our faculty’s professional values,” the letter, signed by the current headmaster, Walter C. Johnson, and others, said.\n\nThe letter did not detail the number of victims, their ages or the severity of the abuse. Nor did it identify the employee. It said that several alumni who attended in the 1960s — when it was a boarding school for roughly 500 boys — had contacted the school to report episodes of abuse. The school hired a law firm experienced in such inquiries to look into the accusations. The letter and its contents were first reported in The Journal News, a newspaper that covers Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties.\n\nThe letter said that the law firm’s inquiry “pursued allegations against other employees, but did not find for these the same level of corroboration.” It said that there was no clear evidence that officials at the time filed a “contemporaneous report of this misconduct,” but that “there is evidence to support our belief that Hackley’s leadership at that time did not tolerate such misconduct when reported.”\n\nSchool officials declined on Thursday to elaborate on the letter or say whether police officials were ever asked to investigate the abuse.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
