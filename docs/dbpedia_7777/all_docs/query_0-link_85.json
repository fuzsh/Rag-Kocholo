        "text": "In his September 2020 Convocation Speech welcoming the new school year, Head of School Michael Wirtz shared, “From social distancing to masks to drooling into a vial each week—and then bringing it to school!—it is clear that 2020–2021 will be a school year unlike any other.” The months that followed proved what we already knew: We can get through anything, United. Our students continue to inspire us through their resilience and empathy. This year, our end-of-year events were once again held in-person, and it is a testament to our community’s commitment to ensuring a safe, healthy, and engaging experience for our students. Please join us in celebrating the Hackley community."
