        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis study has sought to explore college students’ perspectives on alcohol prevention measures and consumption in the context of the REACT pilot programme in Ireland. Acknowledging the reality that “very few studies explore what students think about reducing excessive drinking” (Davies et al., 2018, p. 4), the research seeks to address this gap and add to the limited evidence base by “giving voice” to student perspectives on measures aimed at tackling excessive drinking and on alcohol consumption more generally.\n\nFindings from this qualitative study confirm that alcohol is perceived by the student participants as being pervasive to college life, an almost inescapable reality of the student experience. At the same time, the focus group participants acknowledged that this alcohol-saturated society extended beyond the grounds of the college campus, with many asserting that it was endemic to Irish culture itself. Viewing it within a social-ecological framework, participants seemed to collectively acknowledge the multiple layers of influence on student alcohol consumption. In line with the CDC’s four-level framework, for instance, they cited society-level factors (e.g., cultural normalisation of alcohol), individual-level factors (students’ expectation that college life was synonymous with drinking), relational influences (e.g., students’ desire for sociability and fun) and community-level factors (e.g., availability of cheap alcohol, lack of regulation in pubs, presence of on-campus bars).\n\nSimilar to other study findings (Davies et al., 2018; Furtwängler & de Visser, 2017; Hutton, 2012; Larsen et al., 2016), many of the participants were sceptical therefore of the potential efficacy of programmes such as REACT to tackle student drinking, owing to the inevitable displacement effects that may occur when alcohol is controlled in one environment but pervasive across the wider society. This includes the rapidly growing phenomenon of pre-drinking, which appears to be “universally associated with increased alcohol consumption during the evening and a higher risk of experiencing negative consequences, including alcohol poisoning, drunk driving and blackouts” (Labhart & Kuntsche, 2017, p. 136). A particularly strong finding from this study was the appetite or desire for leisure spaces that offered an alternative to these alcohol-infused environments. Moreover, while alcohol was deemed intrinsic to student life, the participants were not necessarily a homogeneous group in this regard, with some of the older students as well as a smaller cohort of the younger students stating that they consumed alcohol infrequently or not at all, while others viewed heavy drinking as a transitory phase.\n\nSuch findings raise a crucial point – the importance of addressing community-level factors, in particular the settings in which students interact, live and have fun. In line with Valentine et al.’s (2010, p. 19) assertion, it underlines the need for the development of “a wider range of mainstream leisure spaces which are less predicated on the consumption of alcohol”. Creating such alternatives, this study posits, could, on the one hand, serve to disentangle the strong association made between consuming alcohol and being sociable/having fun and, at the same time, cater for an increasingly diverse population of college students whose drinking preferences may be more variable than epidemiological statistics imply. In this context, and in line with Fry (2010, p. 1291), the study findings suggest that there may be a need for a certain “rethinking” of alcohol prevention therefore – “beyond a sole focus on intoxication and at-risk groups” and acknowledging that the varied interests of students extend beyond a mere predilection for consuming alcohol during leisure time. Indeed, students and young adults may be best placed to inform policy in this regard, not only in terms of creating alcohol-free leisure spaces but also in devising relevant and fun activities that provide viable, inexpensive alternatives to consuming alcohol.\n\nStudents’ desire for alcohol-free settings is borne out by other research conducted among college students. A study by Davies et al. (2018), for example, similarly highlights the lack of credible alternative socialising opportunities cited by students and the associated effects, such as the potential to “default to drinking” or feelings of stigmatisation among non-drinkers. The literature also points to greater heterogeneity in drinking among the college student population than is generally conveyed. Davoren et al.’s (2016) study, for example, describes a typology of student drinkers ranging from the guarded drinker, the calculated hedonist, the peer-influenced drinker and the inevitable binge drinker. Elsewhere, Fry’s (2010) study on younger adults sheds light on the experiences of infrequent drinkers and non-drinkers among this cohort.\n\nWhile students seemed to implicitly recognise the need for a social-ecological approach to alcohol prevention, acknowledging the significance of society- and community-level influences as well as individual and relational factors, there was a divergence in perspectives when asked whose responsibility it is to control student alcohol consumption. Many of the younger students in particular viewed it as their personal responsibility to control drinking, while mature students frequently cited the responsibility of the college or bar owners in this regard. Such divergences in opinion further support the contention that the contemporary college student population is an increasingly diverse one, encompassing differences not only in terms of gender, nationality and socio-economic background but also in relation to possible generational differences. One potential explanation for this divergence in opinion is that the younger students may reflect the markedly neo-liberal social order into which they have been socialised, whereas older students may subscribe to a more paternalistic worldview, whether this is due to generational differences in outlook or their longer life experience.\n\nCertainly, the emphasis on personal responsibility among the younger students, who at the same time acknowledged wider community- and society-level influences on student drinking, is interesting in this context. As stated earlier, it suggests that these students may embody one of the central tensions of the so-called “neo-liberal social order” (Griffin et al., 2009) – having to navigate a world where alcohol is ubiquitous and aggressively marketed but still perceiving themselves as self-regulating, responsible consumers. The emphasis on personal responsibility is also interesting in the context of the proliferation of “responsible drinking” campaigns. It suggests that messages of personal responsibility promoted in responsible drinking campaigns – now a common feature of alcohol-industry-funded corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives – may have become somewhat ingrained in the mindset of younger students, perhaps owing to their greater susceptibility to marketing or industry influences.\n\nIn keeping with the theme of the increased diversity of the student population, it is also interesting to note how participants in the study emphasised the need for greater and more diverse student involvement, particularly non-students’ union representation, in programmes like REACT. Such feedback is pertinent in the context of the growing emphasis placed more broadly on the importance of young people’s participation in policy and community development initiatives (Council of Europe, 2008). Studies also underline the benefits of the target group’s participation in decisions about the design and implementation of health promotion programmes (Reid et al., 2008; Simovska & Carlsson, 2012). Despite this commitment to participation, Griebler et al. (2017) contend that in practice it often remains purely rhetorical and that levels of participation are often rather low. The need to ensure more active participation by the target population is similarly borne out by this study, but with the added caveat of ensuring more diverse student involvement, outside of students’ union representation. Thus, in efforts aimed at increasing student participation in health promotion or harm reduction programmes targeted at this group, consideration of the types and not only quantity of students should constitute a priority for future programmes.\n\nFinally, despite the growing diversity of the student population both terms of demographics and in relation to alcohol-related experiences and perceptions, this study contends that a common denominator among the majority of college students is the desire for sociability and connection with their peers in safe, fun and affordable environments. The participants’ responses bear this out: in particular, the strong emphasis placed on the need for a wider variety of leisure spaces that offer affordable, appropriate and engaging options to college students besides the ubiquitous “pub”. Even among the self-professed frequent drinkers in this study, the aspects of sociability and fun (“we’re all just having a laugh and we’re all out together”) were highlighted as the primary reasons for going out drinking.\n\nThis desire for sociability and connection is reflected in other youth-related research. Consultations for Ireland’s national recreation policy (OMC, 2007), for example, underlined young people’s desire for recreational spaces that are warm, safe, affordable and free from alcohol and drugs. The policy also recognised the significance of non-formal recreational spaces for young people, acknowledging that simply “hanging out” can be extremely valuable for building confidence and enhancing peer support networks among young people (OMC, 2007; Brady et al., 2018). Even in research on pre-drinking, one of the motivations cited for engaging in this practice is to facilitate socialisation with friends (Ferris et al., 2019; Labhart & Kuntsche, 2017; MacLean & Callinan, 2013). Elsewhere, research by Nolas (2014) on youth clubs shows that the young people were far less interested in the activities on offer and more interested in the opportunities provided by these activities to relate to each other and the youth workers. The author concluded that such “liminal spaces” need to be protected to ensure that young people can interact freely and “truly become themselves” (Nolas, 2014; Brady et al., 2018).\n\nThese and similar findings have significant implications for youth policy, including policies directed at college students and those seeking to reduce hazardous alcohol consumption. They suggest that in addressing the “intractable” issue of student alcohol consumption, college and policy stakeholders perhaps need to ask a different question: not how can they reduce excessive alcohol consumption, but rather how can they create or engineer environments that enable a diverse student population to connect and engage with each other, to express themselves and have fun, in spaces beyond the narrow confines of alcohol-infused environments.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nThis study focuses on two types of institution taking part in the REACT programme and therefore does not claim to be representative of all participating institutions. Moreover, given the qualitative nature of the study, it does not purport to represent the perspectives of the entire college student population in this country. Also, the authors acknowledge that the decision to use focus groups may yield different results to a study utilising individual interviews, although use of a researcher experienced in group facilitation sought to ensure that the focus groups were as inclusive as possible. A particular strength of the study is its inclusion of different categories of student – namely, younger undergraduates, mature students, international students and those who are members of clubs and societies. In this regard, the study has sought to capture a range of perspectives, acknowledging that the student population is not necessarily a homogenous group.\n\nImplications of the research\n\nThe findings of this research highlight a number of important considerations for the REACT programme and other alcohol prevention initiatives of this kind. Firstly, given the high density of alcohol outlets and activities off campus reported by students, the study recommends a greater focus on alcohol prevention efforts in the surrounding community and not just in the college setting for such programmes. Mapping of licensed premises in the area, an optional action point of REACT, may constitute an important measure, for example, not only in gathering important information but also for lobbying local authorities on the need to reduce the high density of alcohol outlets and to help mitigate potential displacement effects among college students. The clear emphasis on the desire and need for more alcohol-free spaces and activities found in this study also signals the need for a more proactive rather than reactive approach to alcohol policy in the college sector. We note that the provision of alcohol-free accommodation and spaces is a further optional action point of REACT and recommend that this be developed as a core part of such programmes going forward. Moreover, further research on the impact of such measures would be worthwhile.\n\nThe growing diversity of the student population, both in terms of demographics and drinking behaviours, is another notable finding of this study and we recommend that student representation, including representation on the REACT steering committee, should give due consideration to the broad and varied nature of the student voice, providing greater opportunities for this increasingly diverse population to inform programmes and policies directed at them. This could include greater opportunities for participatory and co-design research approaches, where students act as partners rather than participants in research conducted to inform programme design."
