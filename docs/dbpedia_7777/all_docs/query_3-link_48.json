        "text": "In Lakelandâs five elementary schools (Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Lincoln-Titus, Thomas Jefferson and Van Cortlandtville), small classes give students a solid start to lifelong learning beginning with a full-day kindergarten program. All schools provide a standards-based core curriculum at every grade level, grounded in solid pedagogy, and differentiated for a diverse student body. All schools provide weekly art, music, physical education and media classes, and outside organizations provide a range of after-school activities.\n\nThe Lakeland Copper Beech Middle School utilizes a team approach to teaching, a model widely adopted and well-suited to learners of this age group.Â A comprehensive curriculum that includes the core subjects (English language arts, math, science and social studies) is supplemented by classes in art, music, technology, consumer studies, computer technology andÂ foreign language. Students participate in a wide range of after-school clubs and activities including Drama Club, Science Club, Midnight Run, Destination Imagination and the National Junior Honor Society. The middle school has been designated a national âSchool to Watchâ in recognition of its outstanding educational programs.\n\nThe districtâs two high schools (Lakeland High School and Walter Panas High School) provide quality education for students in grades nine through twelve. In addition to a full range of academic courses, the high schools offer: twenty Advanced Placement courses, a robust music and art program, forensic science, robotics, college-level courses in English and business, a career experience program for high school seniors, and the opportunity to participate in an online learning environment. The districtâs high schools are well represented with active theater arts programs. Students can also take advantage of a science research program and work with nationally and internationally renowned experts.\n\nTo prepare learners for college and career readiness, the Lakeland Central School District embraces technology as a means to achieve academic success and acquire the 21stÂ Century skills necessary in todayâs global economy.Â Every classroom has access toÂ withÂ computers and SMART Boards as well as a separate technology lab.Â All buildings are equipped with high speed fiber optic and wireless Internet access. Laptops, tablet devices and video conferencing capability are used daily in all schools.\n\nStudents also participate in numerous after-school activities and clubs including Future Business Leaders of America, student government, musical theater, chorus, orchestra, jazz band, community service and leadership organizations, and a nationally-renowned Debate team. Student musicians have been recognized throughout the area as well as in statewide competitions. District students take an active role in their local communities and often participate in activities ranging from blood and food drives to raising money for local animal shelters and disaster relief.\n\nMore than 80 interscholastic sport programs are offered for girls and boys in grades seven through twelve.Â The interscholastic athletic teams excel both on the field and in the classroom earning statewide recognition as Scholar Athletes. Historically, the district's teams have also won state, league and sectional championships."
