        "text": "The high school you go to has a major impact on shaping your future, starting with which college you will end up attending. While there are no longer true feeder high schools for elite colleges, some schools have more resources and opportunities which prepare students for top colleges.\n\nWhile it’s true that you can get into a top college from anywhere, some students do have a significant advantage in the admissions process due to their high school. In this article, we’ll look at some of the top independent high schools in the country.\n\nThis is not a definitive ranking, and we are not saying that any of these schools is definitively better than another. There are thousands of schools across the country, all with their own merits. In this article, however, we’re looking at schools which through their past performance have shown a commendable ability to prepare students for the nation’s top colleges.\n\nJust because a school is not on this list does not mean it is worthless, nor that it is not the best choice for you. Each student is different, and what may serve one well is not ideal for another. If you want more personalized advice on finding the best high school for your particular circumstances, schedule a free consultation to learn how we can help you.\n\nA Note on Methodology\n\nWe are only including private schools on this list. We will note whether or not a school has any religious affiliation, and whether that affiliation impacts instruction. We will give detailed summaries of ten schools, and then include a further list of top schools without description. We do not rank the schools on either list, but have arranged them alphabetically. Let’s get started!\n\nApplying to High Schools\n\nAll of the highschools listed here are selective to one degree or another, and all require an application. Private schools generally require the following as part of an application:\n\nA non-refundable application fee\n\nAn application form\n\nA questionnaire or essay from the student\n\nRecommendation forms from an English and math teacher\n\nStandardized test scores\n\nTranscripts and academic records\n\nAn interview\n\nWe’ll cover each of these in more detail, so you know what to expect.\n\nThe core of the application is a form filled out by you, covering basic information about the student. This accompanies the application fee. Official transcripts and records from previous schools attended are also required.\n\nThe student is themself responsible for part of the application. What form this takes depends on the school in question. Generally, it is either a questionnaire or an essay response. The goal here is for the school to learn more about the student, and how they think and approach the world.\n\nRecommendation letters from teachers provide additional context about how the student acts and thinks in the classroom. Students entering grades 6 and up require these from an English teacher and a math teacher. Some private schools also want reports from a school principal or other administrator. Some will also accept forms from other mentors in a student’s life. Check carefully what each school requires before beginning the application process.\n\nStandardized tests are required by private schools as an objective measure of a student’s ability. The most commonly used test is the Independent School Entrance Exam (ISEE). Catholic schools sometimes use the High School Placement Test (HSPT) instead. Scores are relative; students are evaluated based on how their performance compares to their peers.\n\nFinally, these schools will sometimes request an interview, to better understand the student, and how they would fit at the school. While the exact interview questions vary, practicing for the interview is a good way to ease nerves and ensure your student showcases their best qualities.\n\nA Guide to Schools\n\nChoate Rosemary Hall (Wallingford, Connecticut)\n\nChoate Rosemary is a coeducational boarding college-preparatory school, founded in 1890.
