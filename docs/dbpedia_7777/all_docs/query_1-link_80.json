        "text": "THE function of private schools, Donald Barr, headmaster of the Hackley School in Tarrytown, told an educational symposium last week, ''is to keep public school administrators honest.''\n\nMr. Barr appeared on a panel of public- and private-school educators discussing ''Private Schools - Threat or Complement to Public Schools'' at Pace University's White Plains campus. ''So long as disgustingly expensive private schools like ours exist,'' he said, ''public school administrators will not be able to get rid of their top courses on the grounds of economy.'' Mr. Barr was suggesting that public schools would lose their top students to private schools if public institutions stopped offering challenging courses.\n\nConceding that private schools were not intrinsically better than public schools, Mr. Barr said he believed that public schools must cope with a number of problems private schools can avoid. ''Public schools are beset by legal problems that vitiate discipline,'' Mr. Barr said. ''And tenure vitiates the selection and recasting of faculty'' in public schools.\n\nBecause public schools must cope with a vast number of social responsibilities that the Government has foisted on them, he concluded, ''the public schools are disheartened and inefficient and that's why their students are coming to us.''\n\nCommenting that the Hackley School is ''proud of its intellectuality,'' Mr. Barr said, ''We are not trying to foster the social development of our students. We are putting our funds and our efforts into teaching.''\n\nOther representatives of the private-and parochial-school sector on the panel were Sister Bernadette Hannaway, District Superintendent of the Westchester-Putnam schools in the Archdiocese of New York, and Irwin Shlachter, headmaster of the Rodeph Sholom Day School in New York City. Declaring that public schools suffer from an enormous burden, Mr. Shlachter said: ''Those schools are being asked to handle a tremendous number of psychological problems and concerns that should be the responsibility of other agencies.'' The smaller class size possible in private schools, Mr. Shlachter said, allows a teacher ''to deal with the child as an individual.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
