        "text": "102nd Year\n\nThe museum’s history began with a gift from lumber baron Charles Hackley, who made his fortune in during the 1980s Michigan lumbering boom. Hackley believed that the growth of Muskegon—the young city he adopted as home—would benefit from progressive new schools, a library and a hospital, and an art museum. Hackley died in 1905 before realizing his dream of an art gallery. However, he left an expendable trust of $150,000, through a bequest in his will, to the Board of Education of Muskegon Public Schools. The fund, now known as the Hackley Picture Fund, was to be used to purchase “pictures of the best kind.” By 1910 some of the most treasured and valuable works of art still in the Museum’s present day collection were purchased and then displayed at Hackley Public Library, and the Board of Education determined that the time had come to build a museum-quality facility to house the growing art collection. The new museum, called the Hackley Art Gallery, was built and, in June 1912, opened its doors to the public. The news was broadcast nationally and internationally. The young museum, eventually renamed The Muskegon Museum of Art, was and is still regarded as one of the finest regional art museums in the United States.\n\n2014-2015 Exhibition Schedule\n\nEXHIBITION INFORMATION and DATES SUBJECT TO CHANGE.\n\nPlease call the Museum at 231.720.2570 or visit muskegonartmuseum.org to check schedule before your visit.\n\nJanuary 9 – March 16, 2014\n\nPAPERCUTS: The Art of Contemporary Papercutting\n\nL. C. and Margaret Walker Gallery A\n\nPaper cutting is a study in contrasts: a thin, fragile material is pierced with sharp knives, lasers, or stamping devices, the inherent fallibility of the art form making it all the more compelling.

Using many kinds of paper and tools, seven artists have created more than 30 works that range from narrative commentaries to structural abstractions and complex installations—bold statements that celebrate the subtle nuance of hand to paper through a process that traces its origins to 6th-centry China.
