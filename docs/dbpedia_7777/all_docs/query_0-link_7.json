        "text": "Hackley has incredible athletic facilities and an expansive campus. In terms of comfort and resources, it is definitely strong. However, the workload, especially in English, is high and many students are very tired or stressed and may experience burnout when they reach college. Especially if a kid wants science/business, their humanities can be overwhelming. Many kids in the colleges they go to from regular good public schools may have more energy and still the same preparation and do well in careers when it matters. The school has great facilities if one wanted to focus on a sport or explore nature, but seemed to have no boost for college admissions even though the workload is so high. May not be worth it as the actual sports teams are average and clubs/ECs options are weak. Westchester has great public schools, while with a bigger class size, have great college placements and a more well balanced social and academic life given Hackley kids come from all over the area. My perspective.\n\nThis comfortable school has lovely teachers, facilities, sports, and spirit. For some reason, the school's most tough, time-consuming subject is English. Some of the teachers teach it in an excellent creative and analytical manner while others make it extremely hard and tie it to unwanted leftist, woke ideology like in the senior course (Critical Race Theory, Queer Theory, Feminist Theory, Gender Studies, Marxist/Leninist Theory), drawing attention away from higher pursuit in useful subjects. Students spend so much time on \"English\" to keep their grade up that a lot end up majoring in similar topics in college, because they are unable to compete with top students in business, law, medicine, and technology. If the English taught more grammar/reading comprehension/inference in a rigorous way, students would be better prepared for the SAT/ACT and graduate free from woke ideology. Only 5-7% of the class went to the Ivy League, Stanford, and Duke without a hook.\n\nHackley is a school with access to resources, but it sometimes seems as though those resources are allocated to the wrong things. For example, the quality of the food is often questioned. The academics are solid, particularly in the humanities. There is a wide spectrum of kinds of students at Hackley: some students are wildly devoted to academics, while others seem less interested. One thing is for sure: graduating students frequently mention how well Hackley prepared them for their college experience.\n\nMost of the students Iâ€™ve talked to canâ€™t wait to leave. Iâ€™ve been at Hackley since second grade. Throughout this time, Iâ€™ve experienced many days where I couldnâ€™t handle it anymore and broke down in the bathroom. The amount of homework is unbelievably high and often you have to pick priority classes while suffer in the others. There are many teachers here who are blessings that I love, but there are also many who canâ€™t teach and want you to figure it out. There is a lack of vigor to the community here. Walking through the halls, noticing the stained rug embedded with dirt, the cheap plastic cups, plates, and bowls in the cafeteria, the funky smell of some hallways/classrooms, the lack of compassion the learning specialists/admissions have, the fixed tired expressions on all of my peers, the art teacherâ€™s destructive criticism and shaming of not only art, but people, and escaping through our phones. Ask yourself, am I in the right mental space to be there? ðŸš· children beware ðŸ†˜\n\nIf you fit a specific demographic, attending Hackley will be easy. Nearly 70% of the student body is white and the majority of the students are wealthy. The smaller class sizes allow for a better learning experience but classes such as the required English and History are not offered as APs. Instead, the school makes the classes harder by default and encourages students to take the AP exams independently. Hackley claims to be diverse and accepting while many of their students are closeted and their community is homogenous. As a queer person, I have been misgendered by all my teachers and classmates and have not felt welcomed. As a POC, I often feel alienated due to the lack of representation in this school. As a person from a low-income background, my options for college admissions and after-school activities are limited. It's seen as weird being on financial aid. Overall, a person's experience at Hackley will vary based on who they are.\n\nI began attending Hackley in the sixth grade and remained there through the end of my high school career. With such great academic resources at your disposal, it's hard to not garner great college readiness. That being said, near-college level stress on children definitely creates a stress-inducing atmosphere. While this may be perceived as preparing kids for the real world, providing few mental health resources and being in the predominantly white, affluent bubble of Hackley does anything but that.\n\nVery grateful for the great opportunities the school afforded me both in and out of the classroom, particularly through travel, which was covered by my hefty financial aid. I would make sure families considering Hackley (particularly families of color or little financial means) know that the adjustment may take a toll on your student.\n\nI graduated from Hackley a long time ago - mid-60s. I will tell you a story that may illustrate the relative quality of arts education at my time. I had only a middling experience in Hackley with sciences and maths. BUT my English Lit education was stellar. Taught by Fred Neilson & Arthur Naething in my upper class years, I was challenged and enjoyed the rigor. After graduation, I won a scholarship to a British \"public\" (i.e. private) school in London that was established in 1565 by charter from Queen Elizabeth. During one of my first English classes, the upper 6th Form students were were given a copy of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, which had the middle English on one side of the page, and a modern \"translation\" on the opposite. I was shocked when the students were asked to read aloud, but could read only the modern version. My teacher, annoyed by my question, challenged me to \"try\" reading the original - whereupon I read as I was taught at Hackley, much to the surprise of everyone.\n\nI'm an 8th grade student here at Hackley, and I have had the most amazing experience over the past 3 years. The academics are amazing, and the spirit, and inclusivity are even better. We had the fall sting yesterday and I was amazed with the spirit and excitement. Everyone was enthusiastic and so passionate about the school. I am so exited to play for my school next year, and I love Hackley.\n\nI have loved my years at Hackley, I have learned so much, and have had unforgettable experiences with teachers who pour their hearts into their classes and students. I have found incredible support systems, and have found a home on the sports team and in the extracurriculars."
