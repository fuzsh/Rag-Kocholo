        "text": "The New York State Association of Independent Schools promotes the independence, well-being and public understanding of, and respect for, New York independent schools and serves as an accrediting body chartered by the New York State Board of Regents.\n\nNYSAIS Schools\n\nNYSAIS is a voluntary association of 196 independent nursery, elementary and secondary schools enrolling some 79,000 students. It is affiliated with the National Association of Independent Schools and the NY State Coalition for Independent and Religious Schools. Founded in 1947, the Association is chartered by the NY State Board of Regents and is incorporated as a 501 (c) (3) not-for-profit organization.\n\nAccreditation\n\nAll good schools continually evaluate their performance by means of their own devising. Without evaluation an institution ossifies, and in a changing world it loses its meaning for society. But the view a school takes of itself needs periodically to be supplemented by an external view, one that brings a perspective the school cannot command.\n\nNYSAIS Athletic Association\n\nThe mission of New York State interscholastic athletic programs is to foster the quest for excellence by creating an educational and competitive experience within an atmosphere of sportsmanship. Successful programs develop individual and team potential by promoting high standards of competence, character, civility, and citizenship."
