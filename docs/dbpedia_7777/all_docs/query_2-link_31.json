        "text": "The Masters School: Located on a 96-acre wooded campus in the historic Hudson River village of Dobbs Ferry, The Masters School is a co-educational college preparatory day and boarding school for grades 5-12.\n\nThe Masters School:\n\nLocated on a 96-acre wooded campus in the historic Hudson River village of Dobbs Ferry, The Masters School is a co-educational college preparatory day and boarding school for grades 5-12.\n\nMasters commences its 138th year with a diverse and talented student body at an all-time high enrollment of 650 upper and middle school students, representing 16 states and 29 countries.\n\nThe School will start the school year with 170 boarding students, this along with over 60% of the faculty living on campus, results in a faculty highly accessible to students and a vibrant seven-day campus with a variety of enriching activities throughout the week. The result is both day and boarding students benefit from the advantages typically associated with a full-time boarding school.\n\nMaureen Fonseca, Ph.D. continues as Head of School, leading a dedicated, talented faculty, who take pride in the integrity and depth of the curricula they have helped create, which is rich is literature, writing, math, science, languages, history, arts, and comparative religion. Students learn around oval Harkness tables, where everyone has a “front row seat” and the exchange of ideas is valued and respected, developing the complex skills needed to succeed in college, career, and life.\n\nThe School is in the process of completing the new Masters Athletic and Arts Center (MAAC), a 75,000-square-foot building unlike any other – that will provide a dynamic campus hub for athletics, the arts and student engagement – with transparent architecture throughout. Scheduled to open in spring 2015, this new facility will feature a competition swimming pool, squash courts, fencing studio, basketball court, indoor track, experimental theater, art gallery, digital production studio, café, and much more. The MAAC will also be a “green” building, achieving a Gold LEED certification.\n\nIn 2014-15, The Masters School will continue to be characterized by high standards, great achievement, and hard work. It is also a place of creativity, diversity, and fun. The curriculum is challenging. The athletic teams are competitive and accomplished. The arts program is exceptional. And engagement with the School’s community service program has been a guiding principle since the School’s founding in 1877.\n\nThe Masters School\n\n49 Clinton Avenue, Dobbs Ferry, 479-6420\n\nwww.mastersny.org\n\nYear Founded: 1877\n\nHead of School: Maureen Fonseca, Ph.D.\n\nEnrollment: 650\n\nStudent/Teacher Ratio: 8 to 1\n\nAverage Class Size: 14\n\nTuition: $37,875-$55,050. The Masters School provides $4,000,000 in financial aid.\n\nWhitby School:\n\nPreparing students for a dynamic world in which innovation and collaboration will measure success, Whitby School inspires a passion for learning and empowers each child to take responsibility as an open-minded, principled citizen in a global community.\n\nWhitby’s IB-accredited program (with Montessori in early years) provides children with opportunities for inquiry and exploration throughout the educational continuum from 18 months through 8th grade. More families than ever before are choosing Whitby, with enrollment and re-enrollment at an all-time high, while graduates continue to gain acceptances into their first-choice of schools, including Andover, Choate Rosemary Hall, Greenwich Academy, Hackley, and King.\n\nAs the region’s premier early childhood program and the birthplace of the American Montessori Society (AMS), Whitby understands the road to lifelong learning begins early, and its proven educational approach is rooted in a child’s innate inclination to learn. Research shows the Montessori approach enhances performance, persistence, memory, and creativity, and that Montessori children are better prepared for elementary school, outscoring peers in math and reading skills and testing higher on the ability to adapt to changing and more complex problems – key indicators of future school and life success.\n\nAt Whitby, Montessori is complemented by the International Baccalaureate (IB) – the world’s fastest growing educational program and a seamless extension of Montessori practice and philosophy. The IB trans-disciplinary, theme-based curriculum gives children the intellectual tools to understand and navigate the complexities of today’s global community and provides a foundation that serves students throughout their lives.\n\nReflecting Whitby’s commitment to innovation and excellence, the school recently embarked on a multi-phase campus improvement plan. The first stage — completed in 2013 — includes a new Design Technology Lab, a state-of-the-art Science Lab, and two additional classrooms, enabling a trans-disciplinary curriculum centered on “design thinking.” Students work on robotics, multimedia, programming, and design as they learn about the systems and relationships involved in taking an idea through the design cycle between thought, prototype, product, and evaluation. The Design Tech Lab features 3-D printers and scanner, large wall-mounted monitors, and an interactive whiteboard. Phase 2 of the expansion plan includes the addition of a new Athletics Center aimed at solidifying the school’s already competitive sports programs.\n\nThe expert faculty, small class size, and low student/faculty ratio ensure a focus on each student to stimulate the child’s thinking and maximize learning. Whitby’s well-rounded curriculum incorporates music, drama, art, and world languages while leveraging a 1:1 technology program. The diverse learning experience, which includes families and faculty hailing from 40 countries and speaking 15 languages, also brings cross-cultural learning to life.\n\nStudents participate in athletics and team sports beginning in third grade, and also enjoy a variety of after-school electives, with award-winning chess teams, Lego engineering, math club, and mother-tongue language classes. Outside the classroom, students gain from a variety of experiences beyond the school’s walls, starting with the expansive grounds right outside the classroom, to an annual Middle School overseas trip (the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and Spain in the past three years), where they are immersed in language, culture, and service.\n\nFaculty and Staff\n\nIn the 2014-2015 school year, Whitby welcomes new faculty members and celebrates exciting new roles for staff. They bring diverse experiences and backgrounds to the school.\n\nLower School\n\nRachel Beninati\n\nPrimary Teacher\n\nMs. Beninati obtained her M.A.T. in Early Childhood Education from Manhattanville College.

The school’s international program includes six who enrolled in 2013 and seven new students (grades 9-11), hailing from China, Taiwan, Korea, and Germany.\n\nHarvey’s international program is unique for a few key reasons. First, the students plan to spend up to four years on campus and graduate from Harvey. As such, there is a much deeper integration and transformation of both students and the school community than with a short-term exchange. Second, international students fully integrate into all aspects of daily school life. Not only do they take all classes with the local students, but this past year international students played volleyball, basketball, ice hockey, and tennis, acted in school plays and musicals, modeled in a student-run charity fashion show, volunteered in the community, and spoke at other local high schools about growing up and going to school in China.\n\nThird, the hybrid residential options allow international students to get ‘the best of both worlds’: they live in a boarding school environment with a local roommate during the week and with a local family over the weekend. Finally, international students benefit from the same great opportunities that attract families from Westchester and Fairfield counties to Harvey.\n\nHarvey’s tight-knit community and small classes of approximately ten students provide individualized attention and every opportunity to build meaningful relationships and teacher-student mentorships. This is an especially dramatic and positive change for students coming from China, where average class sizes hover between 50 and 60 students. At Harvey, students work closely with their advisors to select courses that will appropriately support and challenge them. For example, a returning 11th grade student from Guangzhou, China, plans to enroll in a regular American History class, but has selected Advanced Placement math and science classes from among the 13 AP classes offered.\n\nEvery international student who joined Harvey in 2013 will return this fall — a testament to the success of the first year of the program. Those involved with the program attribute the seamless addition of these students to Harvey’s caring teachers, flexible and adaptable curriculum, friendly and welcoming local students, families and dorm parents.\n\nIf you are interested in becoming a host family for an international student, contact Julia Gooding at jgooding@harveyschool.org or 232-3161.\n\nThe Harvey School\n\n260 Jay Street, Katonah, 232-3161\n\nwww.harveyschool.org\n\nYear Founded: 1916\n\nHeadmaster: Barry Fenstermacher\n\nGrades: 6-12\n\nTuition: $33,250 and up\n\nOpen House: Saturday, October 18 at 9:00.\n\nRippowam Cisqua:\n\nRippowam Cisqua School’s mission is to promote critical thinking, individual development, and personal excellence for grades Pre-K-9. Parents are drawn to the school because of the small class sizes, joyful learning environment, and dedicated teachers who challenge students to discover and explore their talents to the fullest. Rippowam Cisqua is committed to a dynamic program of academics, the arts, and athletics in an atmosphere that promotes intellectual curiosity and a lifelong love of learning.\n\nBelieving that learning is a shared experience, the responsibility of both students and teachers, they urge active student involvement and seek to provide a rich curriculum for children of different abilities and learning styles. Their approach to learning incorporates experimentation, simulation, and collective and individual problem solving, as well as traditional lecture, discussion, and skill development techniques — all toward the goal of attaining excellence.\n\nStudents are challenged to demonstrate their competence in a variety of subjects, with emphasis placed on the written word, throughout their school career. The process by which children arrive at a final product is an important part of their education.\n\nOver the past year, remarkable student achievement has taken place at Rippowam Cisqua in the classroom, on the stage, and on the athletic fields. Throughout the winter and spring, several 7th- and 8th-grade students worked together to design and built an electric golf cart, and in March, the annual Science Fair on the Lower Campus focused on STEAM — the integration of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math. Many students in grades 7–9 earned accolades at the regional and national levels of the Scholastic Writing Awards, and students in grades 6-9 put on two well-received dramatic productions of “Alice in Wonderland” and “High School Musical.”\n\nIn athletics, Rippowam Cisqua has always been known for its fierce competitive spirit, along with its fierce sense of respect for others. Last year, the Boys’ Varsity Basketball team and Girls’ Varsity Softball team each lost only one game, and the Girls’ Varsity Basketball team has only lost five games over the past six years. Several students set personal bests across a variety of sports this past year, and good sportsmanship, respect for teammates, and opponents alike, and a sports program that promotes self-confidence helped to drive athletic involvement at all ages and grade levels.\n\nIn June, the Town of Bedford Conservation Board presented their annual Green Awards, and Rippowam Cisqua was honored to be among the recipients. The Green Awards were presented to those organizations that work to protect and preserve the Town of Bedford’s environment, and RCS was highlighted for its commitment to environmental sustainability in all aspects of school life.\n\nCharacter development is a critical component of a Rippowam Cisqua education as well. “As a community, we require respect, honesty, and common decency at all times. Our goal is to graduate students who are confident and knowledgeable lifelong learners. We strive to be a school of joyous and enlightened learning: a place where children come, not where they are sent.”\n\nRippowam Cisqua School\n\nwww.rcsny.org\n\nLower School Campus (Pre-K-4):\n\n325 West Patent Road, Mt. Kisco, 244-1200\n\nUpper School Campus (Grades 5-9):\n\n439 Cantitoe Street, Bedford\n\n244-1250\n\nYear Founded: 1917\n\nHead of School: Matthew Nespole\n\nEnrollment: 513\n\nStudent/Teacher Ratio: 5 to 1\n\nTuition: $20,500-$36,600\n\nRippowam Cisqua provides $2,300,000 in financial aid.\n\nHackley School:\n\nThis fall, Hackley opens the renovated Raymond Hall on its historic Upper School quad, with new classrooms and student gathering spaces. The design, which extends Hackley’s commitment to sustainability with geothermal heating and cooling and lots of natural light, captures something about Hackley culture even a first-time visitor can appreciate. Walking through the light-filled corridors, which all look out upon the heart of the campus, and through the archways that unite the upper, middle, and lower divisions, the very spaces encourage connection and community, ideals that come to define the school’s identity, captured in three iconic phrases that weave themselves into the school culture.\n\nClass of 2014 Valedictorian Phil Brooks summed up these phrases’ significance: “Hackley’s three mottos tell a story about how we interact with others throughout our lives as members of the Hackley community. The story starts with the motto engraved above that doorway on the quad: “Enter here to be and find a friend.” This is what Hackley offers to each person who enters our community, and it gives each of us directions for entering this community. The second motto, the school’s seal, ‘Iuncti Iuvamus,’ tells us what we do once we get here. We help each other. We see the final motto, from former English Department Chair Arthur Naething, ‘Go forth and spread beauty and light’ when we leave the building, for this motto is about leaving.\n\nWhenever we leave Hackley, for the weekend, for the summer, or for life, this motto urges us to bring with us what Hackley has given to us. To bring it with us, so that we can give it to others. We have learned how to think of ourselves less and of those around us more.”\n\nAs a community dedicated to learning, Hackley understands the essential nature of growth and evolution, even in its academic programs. The Community Studies program, for example, continues to develop interdisciplinary learning opportunities within core curricula as the school helps cultivate students as global citizens. The Math program offers three statistics courses – AP, non-AP, and Calculus-based – so that every student has the chance to gain a meaningful yet challenging understanding of statistics.\n\nWhat makes Hackley special, however, beyond the beauty of its campus and the strength of its programs and facilities, is the way in which members of this community take these ideas to heart in what they do every day – seeking to be a friend, to help others, to care more about others than themselves, and ultimately, to “spread the beauty and light” they have found at Hackley, even as they grow in individual accomplishment.\n\nDuring a record-breaking year in athletics, with six state championships and seven league titles, students also celebrated each other’s growth in visual and performing arts. While the successes are remarkable, what’s even more so is the way in which the students support and appreciate the accomplishments of others.\n\nHackley School\n\n293 Benedict Avenue\n\nTarrytown\n\n366-2600\n\nwww.hackleyschool.org\n\nYear Founded: 1899\n\nHeadmaster: Walter Johnson\n\nEnrollment: Over 840\n\nstudents in K-12\n\n(397 in Upper School)\n\nStudent/Teacher Ratio: 8 to 1\n\nAverage Class Size: 16\n\nTuition: $37,700 for day\n\nstudents, $52,100 for\n\nboarding students\n\nOpen House: October 25,\n\n9-12; Athletics Open House, November 15, 10-12\n\nFrench-American School\n\nFounded in 1980 as a one-room nursery program, the French-American School of New York has grown into a thriving, co-ed, bilingual private institution. FASNY educates over 800 students from pre-K-12, representing over 50 nationalities. Seventy percent of the school’s families are of French origin and speak French in their home as a first language.\n\nFASNY’s approach is to combine the best of the American and French educational system. Approximately 85 percent of the faculty holds advanced degrees and fosters healthy educational environments in which the students can question, grow, and succeed.
