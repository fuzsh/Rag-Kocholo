        "text": "There is also Academy of Our Lady of Good Counsel in White Plains; its all-girls. A lot of people in Westchester also send their boys to Fordham Prep. There is Salesian, all boys, in New Rochelle also. Of the more affordable schools, I think Ursuline and Fordham Prep may have the best reputations.\n\nWhile not as affordable, there are also a bunch of really good private schools in Riverdale (Bronx) that have a good representation from Westchester: Fieldston, Horace Mann, and Riverdale Country Day School. Also less affordable is all girls School of the Holy Child in Rye and Hackley in Tarrytown.\n\nFor elementary schools, there are lots of options among Catholic schools. I've heard good things about Immaculate Heart in Scarsdale, Annuciation in Tuckahoe, St. Joseph's in Bronxville, and Resurrection in Rye. Also heard the Chapel School (Lutheran) in Bronxville is good.\n\nDiva,\n\nYou should do well with Ursuline for middle school and high school. Most Catholic high schools have great academic standards due to the abundance of AP and honors classes, as well as academically-oriented clubs.\n\nFor elementary, what are your expectations and how much are you willing to pay? Most parochial schools have a standard curriculum that works well for the average student. The only downside is if your elementary child is academically gifted, and therefore you would want a more enriched curriculum for him/her. Parochial schools won't be able to accomodate that. If you want something more enriched, you'll need to spend more to send your child to a private independent school like Convent of the Sacred Heart in Greenwich, Holy Child-Rye, Hackley, French-American School, etc. till he/she gets to middle/high school. The most \"enriched\" curriculum of a parochial school I can think of is Immaculate Heart in Scarsdale, which teaches Great Books beginning 3rd grade, but I do not know much about this school first hand."
