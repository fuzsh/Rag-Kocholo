        "text": "When you visit us on the Hackley Hilltop you will see that a Hackley education is about going all-in.\n\nFrom Kindergarten all the way to Grade 12, students experience joy in the classroom and make life-long connections with each other and with our dedicated faculty. Robust extracurricular programming on our 285-acre campus and our 5-Day Boarding program create unique opportunities for each student to be challenged and supported to grow in character, scholarship, and accomplishment, well beyond the boundaries of the school day. Hackley graduates are empowered with the knowledge and confidence to pursue their passions and the drive to make a difference.\n\nCome see for yourself! Sign up for an event to learn more about Hackley and meet the people that make our community so special."
