        "text": "Whether you have taken AP Human Geography, been placed in his United States History class, attended a practice of Speech and Debate Club, or simply just walked by the history office, you’ve probably exchanged a smile or a friendly “hello” with Upper School (US) History Teacher Steele Sternberg. Mr. Sternberg will be leaving the\n\nUS in June to teach at the Noble and Greenough School.\n\nMr. Sternberg came tothe US from the Hackley School, a private school in upstate New York, to be closer to his\n\nnow wife, a librarian at Nobles. He joined the History Department during the 2020-21 school year.\n\nBeyond teaching, Mr. Sternberg has led a reaccreditation committee, served as an advisor to a group he will “really, really miss,” acted as a Senior Spring Project mentor, facilitated workshops on creating effective and\n\ninteresting field trips, and led the school’s debate team.\n\nThe students have made Mr. Sternberg’s time at the US rewarding, he said.\n\n“You, the students, you’re by far the hardest thing to leave. You guys are just interesting. You’re motivated. You\n\ncome from cool backgrounds. You aren’t the normal sort of private school kid. That is by far and away my favorite thing about this place.”\n\nHe said he has found a supportive environment of teachers and colleagues here.\n\n“There’s way fewer teachers here who phone it in than other schools. Everyone here really tries hard every dayto do a good job. In general, that has been very positive for my professional development.”\n\nThe best compliment Mr. Sternberg has ever received about his teaching came from a former student, he said. “Caroline White ’23 said, ‘You know, Mr. Sternberg, the thing that makes your classes so great isthat [they] end up feeling like a community.’ That felt very good.”\n\nMr. Sternberg will continue to teach U.S. History as well as a World History class similar to the US’s Case Studies course while at Nobles.\n\n“It’s hard to identify what memories are my favorites because I feel like I have so many different memories,” Ms. Selinger said. “I’ll take away, in terms of memories, moments where laughter and joy were present, moments of triumph big and small. Like an advisee, who reported to me that they spoke up in a class discussion where it was really scary, or somebody who got into a college, or who landed a role in the play, or who had a great summer job experience, or even graduates who report back that something amazing has happened, andthere’s a seed of something that we planted together. Those are the things that my memories have in common.”\n\n“A great thing about working at BB&N is that we’re on a team. I never feel alone like I’m trying to do anything by myself,” she said. “The fact that you can walk into a building and know that you have people on your side who will push you, listen to you, cheer for you, give you grief, and all those are wonderful things.”"
