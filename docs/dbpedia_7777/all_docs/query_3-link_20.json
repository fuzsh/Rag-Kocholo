        "text": "Many private day schools as well as boarding schools are reporting an increase in the number of applications. Our firm is also experiencing an increase in inquiries regarding our private school and boarding school admissions advisory services. In a recent conference, Rhode Island Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green indicated that approximately 80 percent of Rhode Island students in grades three through eight were not proficient in math and only a third were reading at grade level the during pandemic-interrupted 2020-2021 school year, according to standardized test scores released Thursday by the state. It was reported that Infante-Green said Rhode Island joins most states around the country – including Massachusetts and Connecticut – in seeing proficiency rates fall during the pandemic.\n\nPrivate schools have seen a flurry of new interest from families who view private schools as being better equipped to provide robust instruction, given their financial resources, space and nimbleness in adapting. As a result of this interest, the competition for coveted spots have increased.\n\nEarlier this year, many students who applied to top boarding schools, including Exeter, Andover, St. Paul’s and Choate were place on waitlists and were eventually notified that could not gain entrance this past fall. In a letter to families, one boarding school stated in April, 2021: “At this time, it is clear that we will be unable to admit students from our waiting list in the near future as we anticipate being overenrolled….followed by another note in August 2021: “…we remain fully enrolled and as such, will be unable to offer admission to any students from our waiting list. I am sorry not to have better news for you and on behalf of all of my colleagues here in the admission office”.\n\nPaul Reginald Lowe is the managing director and lead admissions expert at Pinnacle Educational Center Admissions Advisors Group’s Boarding School Admissions Consultants, an affiliate of Private School Admissions Advisors.

These are excellent reasons why international families seriously consider an American boarding school for their child.\n\nStudents who attend an American boarding school will obtain their F-1 student visa for school. When they graduate, schools will prepare the Form I-20 transfer documentation so there is little or no delay for them to start their college education in the United States if they so desire.\n\nEducation from a top boarding school will teach him or her the education and life skills he or she needs to succeed anywhere in the world.\n\nParents of international students choose boarding schools for their strong academics results and university prep programs that help students be accepted to top universities in the US. They also choose US boarding schools for the unique programs that cannot be found in high schools in their own country.\n\nAt Boarding School Admissions Consultants (BSAC), we provide admissions counseling and placement to assist students and their families prepare EXCLUSIVELY for admission to top U.S. boarding schools – including but not limited to Andover, Exeter, Choate, Loomis, Deerfield, Lawrenceville, St. Paul’s, Hotchkiss, Taft, etc. International parents who desire the best high school education for their children choose us.\n\nDr. Lowe and his team work with international students and from time to time will consult with immigration attorneys regarding their client’s immigration status and its relationship to their admissions process.

These schools have excellent college matriculation rates to top colleges and universities.\n\nHere is a list of the Top 10 Boarding Schools in Massachusetts.\n\nPhillips Academy\n\nGroton School\n\nNoble and Greenough School\n\nDeerfield Academy\n\nMilton Academy\n\nMiddlesex School\n\nNorthfield Mount Hermon School\n\nBerkshire School\n\nDana Hall School\n\nMiss Hall School\n\nBoarding schools that we have listed above have 5 Things in Common that all top boarding schools have including but not limited to, enviable college admissions placement, contemporary facilities, small classes and an inclusive culture. Year after year, we have placed students in these boarding schools and they have provided positive feedback about their experiences!\n\nIf your goal is for your child to attend a top boarding school, in order for you to achieve your preferred outcome, consider the admissions experts – Dr. Lowe and his team for successful admissions.\n\nSuccessful boarding school admissions requires expertise and experience to understand how to manage risks, navigate pitfalls, design the right admissions strategies, and most importantly understand the admissions policies and professionals who are making admissions decisions – in other words an admissions expert\n\nParents need a trusted resource to help them navigate the fast-paced, uncertain and highly-selective admissions process!\n\nDr. Paul Reginald Lowe is the managing director and lead admissions expert at Pinnacle Educational Center Admissions Advisors Group’s Boarding School Admissions Consultants, an affiliate of Private School Admissions Advisors. Dr. Lowe specializes in providing exclusive concierge-type admissions advisory services for U.S. and international students who are interested in applying to top U.S. boarding schools.

Dr. Lowe and his team of admissions advisors also visit prestigious and elite private schools, where they have the unique opportunity of interacting one-on-one with heads of schools, directors of admissions and senior admissions personnel.\n\nSince March 2nd, my firm has been inundated with continuous inquires (phone calls and emails) from stunned and stressed-out parents because their children are wait-listed. Many of the inquiries are from parents whose children have been wait-listed from ALL schools to which they applied!\n\nOne of the effects of COVID-19 on private school admissions is that more families are choosing private school for their children; thus, the competition has increased. Private schools that were competitive are now hyper-competitive and schools that were marginally competitive are now competitive. We have observed an increase in applications (and therefore waitlisted applicants) in schools in the tri-state area, especially the “Fairchester” area (Westchester and Fairfield Counties) and Northern New Jersey\n\nWAIT-LISTED means that “we love your child, but we don’t have spot available today, tomorrow or perhaps never”. Two factors are important to consider:\n\nSOMETHING WASN’T RIGHT in your child’s application process. Parents make a lot of mistakes on their child’s application.\n\nIn this hypercompetitive environment, in many cases, wait-listed may be “forever”. Top schools rarely “reject” students outright. The outcome, however, remains unchanged…a perpetually waitlisted student has not been accepted and will not have a place in their private school of choice.\n\nMany parents are mistakenly drawing from their skills as corporate executives, tiger moms, financiers, etc. rather than accepting the benefits of a consultant’s professional skills and years of experience in private admissions diplomacy. An understanding of real-time changes, as well as nuances particular to each school at a particular point in time are important for successful outcomes in private school admissions to top schools. Many parents also fail to fully appreciate and understand the human element of diplomacy in the selection process and decisions in private school admissions. As a result, after the waitlist, they reapply again only to be waitlisted AGAIN.\n\nWhen parents call our firm to inquire about our services, they engage us because they understand the importance of investing in their child’s educational future. The successful outcome is invaluable and preferable compared to the prospect of their child being waitlisted again and again and again.\n\nDr. Paul Reginald Lowe is the managing director and lead admissions expert at Pinnacle Educational Center Admissions Advisors Group’s Private School Admissions Advisors.

Welcome to Dr. Paul Lowe Admissions Expert Blog – 2021\n\nThe past year has been full of uncertainty. As a consequence of the myriad of transitions, changes, adjustments and adaptations, now there’s a whole new admissions world. Education has moved from in-person to online learning and there has been an increase in the number of applications to top private day and boarding schools, Ivy League and highly selective colleges and universities and BS/MD programs! The College Board recently announced that it is eliminating the SAT subject tests and optional essay-writing section!\n\nThe one constant we have observed last year and the beginning of this year, is that parents want the best education for their children whether it’s K-12, college or graduate school.\n\nAs families navigate through these extraordinary and unparalleled admissions times, having an expert who can help make objective decisions is invaluable. As experts, we understand the fluctuating landscape and degrees of complexity in the current admissions scenarios so that students can avoid mistakes, stay focused and attain successful admissions decisions. Our knowledge-intelligence that results in our admissions success involves our ability to plan, to know how to adjust and when to change effectively.\n\nFollowing last year’s admissions season, we heard from many parents and school counselors whose students applied ED to the Ivies and were rejected, yet we have clients who were accepted ED to Harvard, Yale, Brown, UPenn, Columbia and Cornell. And our Brown PLME acceptance rate was just amazing! Brown PLME: Early Decision Results\n\nYear after year, parents and fellow consultants ask us, what’s your secret?

As we enter the seventh month of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on secondary education, many of our clients, private as well as public school administrators and teachers are reporting to us their potential approaches to education in the current COVID-19 environment.\n\nSome parents are forming learning pods. Some parents are hiring tutors to supplement online learning at schools that are fully online. Some parents are forgoing traditional schools that will be open in favor of homeschooling. Some parents have elected to build on their lots to provide their own “private” schools with virtual classrooms\n\nWe are also seeing parents who have sent their children to suburban public schools switching to private day and boarding schools, many of which have spent the late spring and summer busily preparing new rules, procedures, and protocols, while improving HVAC systems and technology for the new term.\n\nMany elite private day and boarding schools, with their immense resources, have adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic with online classes, or for in-person schooling, using COVID-19 specific guidelines for social distance spacing, upgrading ventilation systems and adding antibacterial film on desks, handrails and doorknobs. Some have purchased new buildings or adapted old ones to accommodate spacing guidelines. As many are aware, private schools have seen a flurry of new interest from families who view private schools as being better equipped to provide robust instruction, given their financial resources, space and nimbleness in adapting.\n\nAccording to a recent survey of members by the National Association of Independent Schools, nationwide, 40% of independent schools planned to open fully in-person this fall, 19% fully online, and 41% in a hybrid model. By contrast, most of the country’s 20 largest public districts expect to start with only remote instruction.\n\nRegardless of the approach, as high school seniors and juniors are beginning to return to schools, it will be important for them to maintain their focus on their educational goals. When the dust settles and students are into their educational routines, high school seniors and juniors will need to consider how college admissions and their school counseling landscape has been disrupted and changed in this unfamiliar environment. Much has changed! It will be important to keep abreast of the changes and understand how this new environment and uncertainty applies to future educational goal.\n\n“Admissions is a competitive sport!
