        "text": "Just read this article today in \"The Boston Globe\" about children struggling to read in the \"best\" public school districts in the state. This is frightening, but not surprising, and it is sad. Reading skills are the basis for education. How can a student progress in school if they cannot read? As we work to prepare students for entrance exams for private middle, high school and college, we see the impact of poor reading skills on the ability to master these tests. The issue is not just poor reading instruction in the \"best\" public schools, it is the impact of pandemic learning loss in public school students, and the effects of too much screen time. I had a mother from one of the schools mentioned in the article tell me today that the reason her community has such good test scores is that many parents pay for private tutors for math, reading and writing. She is correct. We worked with a student this year (again from one of the school systems mentioned in this article). He was applying to elite private high schools. As part of the application process he needed to submit a graded writing sample. He was an 8th grader, and he did not have one graded writing assignment to submit by January of his 8th grade year. It was astounding to think that he had spent 4 months in school (in one of the \"best\" public school systems in the state) and he did not have any graded writing assignments to submit for his applications! Reading is not only an issue, but writing is as well! https://lnkd.in/eQWZ8ETu\n\nI think it's important to acknowledge that for various reasons there are many states that are dealing with educational structures is not managing to serve the needs of a significant portion of their students. Teacher shortages due to burnout, low pay, and frustration over the neverending cycle of curriculum changes, etc., often lead to overcrowded classrooms and limited special education services that are essential for helping students who not only struggle with language barriers, but also with underlying special education needs. It's unfortunate to be at this point because it's not really addressing the underlying issues of why students of color may be disadvantaged. Yes, the migrant crisis and influx of individuals with limited English (from many regions of the world, not just South America) means that many children will enter school already at the age when they should be close to graduating, but without the foundational English Language skills to do well. But there are also many American children who start to struggle especially around middle school because that's when class and school sizes tend to get larger... because the expectation is that students will be mature enough to handle being in a room with 30-plus other teens and not get distracted, not become a distraction, and not need as much support from the one teacher in the room. Right? Even in larger university classes where students are paying to attend it's challenging to have a room of 30-plus young adults and not have at least 1 person hell bent on being anything but an engaged learner I really think states need to embrace the idea of building more schools, or acquiring facilities that are already available and do everything to keep classroom sizes and students populations at a minimum. Speaking from experience as someone who attended a small elementary and high school, and a small undergrad institution I know how valuable that experience was. I've also taken courses at a large state undergrad university, and taught high school and university in both small and large setting. It really makes a difference as an educator and as a student. As a parent I do my best to make sacrifices to ensure that my child is receiving an education in a smaller environment now when he younger, so that hopefully as he gets older even if he's in a larger high school or university environment he will have the mindset of a person who is able to focus on learning and working towards his degree. But it's tough for parents and students who are limited in having to be in overcrowded classrooms with limited resources. https://lnkd.in/gMmvNNVb\n\n\"Great education systems create cultures of opportunity for all. They donâ€™t settle for no child left behind; they strive to help every child get ahead.\" So much of college and career readiness begins early in a child's educational journey. I can personally attest to the concept outlined in the article, that students benefit from having teachers two years in a row. In my junior and senior years of high school, I was fortunate to have the same teacher for English. My writing and exposition were exponentially stronger in my senior year as compared to my junior year. Not only did my grades improve but I was more confident in my writing and analysis of texts. I matriculated all the better prepared for college, even writing for my institution's alumni magazine as work-study. While my peers, no doubt, also grew in their own English classes with different teachers, I honed a style of writing that was carefully crafted and encouraged by one teacher. I adapted to my teacher's particular stresses on style and persuasion, not in one year but in two. As the reading material and essay assignments became more challenging, my writing developed in maturity. \"Most parents see the benefit of keeping their kids with the same coaches in sports and music for more than a year. Yet the American education system fails to do this with teachers, the most important coaches of all.\" Food for thought.

Frustrated math tutor quits tutoring for pay, discovers path to mutual growth through free lessons with those who choose to learn DAEGU-- Han Si-nae, 36, is no ordinary tutor. Her students, totaling 10 and ranging from primary to high school, come to her house after school for supplementary math lessons. After challenging their brains with math quizzes, the students fill their stomachs with an ample amount of snacks and dinner whipped up by Han. The best part? None of them pay a single penny. So, is Han an altruistic benefactor for future generations with deep pockets? Listening to her speak for a brief moment, it becomes obvious that this is unlikely. The free lessons are, in fact, a small social experiment driven by a disgruntled tutor determined to instill appreciation in return for her efforts.

There are amazing and passionate educators and builders of new learning solutions that are making a difference. Let's start talking about the solutions. Here's one of the best: https://lnkd.in/gRjyvyxg \"My students are obsessed with Shoelace games! I love being able to see how much students are engaged with the game at home and at school. Every day at least one student asks \"when we will be playing Dreamscape again?\" -- Megan Hodgson, Calgary Board of Education, Grades 3-8 \"My students let out a cheer when I say we're playing Dreamscape in the lab. Some even choose to play it for \"free time\". Amazing!\" -- Rebecca Marks, Grande Prairie Public Division, rades 3-5 \"Dreamscape has increased the engagement in my classroom with language arts. The students love that they get to play a game to practice their English Language Arts skills.\" -- Natalie Ewell, Brea Olinda Unified School District, Grades 3-5 \"Dreamscape has given me a way to reach the students who donâ€™t want to do traditional ELA practice. I have seen their vocabulary skills and writing skills grow in the short time we have be using this game. Seeing how invested each of the students is in working together and how engaged they are in this form of learning has been so much fun!\" -- Mariann Papadopoulos, The School of Arts and Enterprise, Grades 6-8 \"My students love playing the game to review our reading standards. The tailored practice to our state standards is perfect, and a great way to engage the kids in review of the standards.\" -- Jessica Janecek, Sandpiper Elementary, Grades 3-8 \"I used Dreamscape when teaching middle school last year and now 3rd grade this year. One of my middle school students had such an increase in his state test scores he was removed from reading resource. He was obsessed with Dreamscape!\" -- Cathleen Francis, Taylor Ranch Elementary, Grades 3-5 \"Even my reluctant readers are obsessed with Dreamscape! The program is gamification at its best. The content is rigorous and I greatly appreciate the placement tests' data and the program's intuitive ability to address deficient skills!\" -- Melanie Musolino, Sunrise Elementary, Grades 3-5 Shoelace has thousands of these testimonials but we need to reach more teachers and learners who can't be left behind. #RT Shoelace Learning (builders of Dreamscape) #readingmatters #ELA #backtoschool #readingisfundamental #readingcommunity #gamebasedlearning #teachers #literacy\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers including Eric Taylor from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, delved into the relationship between classroom practices and student performance in math and English subjects. The key takeaway from this research was the recognition of a significant difference in the most effective use of classroom time between these two disciplines.In the context of mathematics, the study found that students who spent more of their class time engaged in solving practice problems independently and participating in quizzes and tests tended to achieve higher scores. This suggests that in math education, an emphasis on individualized practice and regular assessments plays a pivotal role in improving students' performance. This aligns with the idea that mathematics often requires a strong foundation of problem-solving skills and continuous practice to master.In contrast, when it came to English classes, the study discovered a contrasting pattern. Teachers who allocated more classroom time to foster discussions and encourage group work had students who performed better in this subject. This intriguing finding suggests that collaborative activities and group discussions may enhance students' comprehension and performance in English, possibly by promoting critical thinking, communication skills, and a deeper understanding of literary concepts. Eric Taylor, one of the authors of the study, noted that this distinction in the best use of class time between math and English highlights the importance of tailoring teaching methods to the specific subject matter. What works optimally for one subject might not be as effective for another. Therefore, educators should consider the unique requirements of each subject and adapt their teaching strategies accordingly to maximize student learning and achievement. This research sheds light on the nuanced dynamics of effective teaching practices, offering valuable insights for educators and policymakers seeking to improve educational outcomes in both math and English classrooms."
