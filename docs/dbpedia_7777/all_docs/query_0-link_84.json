        "text": "The PreK-9 Model\n\nFact-based research and evidence confirm what weâ€™ve believed all along: Pre-K-9 is the independent school model that best supports the emotional, developmental, and academic needs of younger students before they begin high school.\n\nWe do not have a high school because we want to preserve an environment in which the needs of younger students remain paramount. With the Pre-K-9 model as a foundation, Tuxedo Park School students learn and grow in a nurturing atmosphere that provides time and guidance to explore identity, goals, and interests. By the time they reach eighth or ninth grade, they are fully prepared to choose the high school that best fits whom they have become, and they are fully prepared to be leaders in their new school community.\n\nThe Value of an Independent Education\n\nDefining what matters to you and your family will go a long way in helping you decide on the right school.\n\nTuxedo Park School offers a values-based education, high academic standards, excellent teachers who provide personal attention to each and every student, an inclusive community, and lifelong connections for families."
