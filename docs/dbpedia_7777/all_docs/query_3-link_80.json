        "text": "MUSKEGON, MI – Muskegon’s iconic Hackley Stadium has just about everything you could want in a high school football venue: Tucked into a residential area, ample seating, good sight lines, close to the action, a sturdy, classic design and dominant teams.\n\nNone of which will come into play when Muskegon High School opens its playoff run this weekend.\n\nDespite earning home-field advantage for the opener, Muskegon was forced to move its game to another field 20 minutes away because the grass playing surface at Hackley is in such poor shape after a season of play.\n\nThe situation has revived an ongoing debate over Hackley that pits tradition against practicality.\n\nBig Red Zone: For kids in the tough town of Muskegon, athletic success means the promise of a better life\n\nTraditionalists love the natural grass that has been a feature at Hackley for a century and say the cost of switching isn’t worth it.\n\nBut opponents of the grass say it’s time to replace it with a durable, synthetic playing surface that can withstand harsh Michigan weather conditions in the fall.\n\nTraditionalists, say synthetic supporters, aren’t the ones running on the field and slipping on it, risking injury and negating the Big Reds’ competitive advantage of speed, explosion and quick, sharp cuts.\n\nAs it has at times over the past decade, No. 18-nationally ranked Muskegon (9-0) opted to move its Division 3 first-round playoff game against Marquette (5-4) to Grand Haven High School’s Gene Rothi Field, which features an artificial surface. Kickoff is 1 p.m. Saturday.\n\nMoving home playoff games to Grand Haven or to other nearby venues with artificial turf, such as Holton, has been a common occurrence as far back as 2008, according to Muskegon football coach Shane Fairfield.\n\nFairfield and Muskegon athletic director Keith Guy would prefer to keep games at Hackley, but the grass field has not held up well this time of year despite efforts by the maintenance crew. It’s been especially rainy this fall, water levels are high in general and the surface does not drain particularly well. The field may look OK superficially, but just below the surface is mud.\n\nBut switching to artificial turf is a costly move that, even if the money is found, might not sit well with some in the community.\n\n“I think the reason is funding. We’re a financially strapped district and we have to prioritize where the funding goes first and there’s different philosophies across the district on where money should be spent,” Guy said. “I’m not saying anyone’s right and anyone’s wrong, but there’s different philosophies and I think it has to probably meet or rise up that priority list, so to speak.\n\n“But I think it’s definitely a money issue and hopefully at some point we can solve that and we’ll be able to get turf.”\n\nLocal historian Ron Pesch does not believe the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\n“My primary view on it is that it’s a very expensive solution to what I see is a relatively small window,” said Pesch. “(A grass field) has worked for 125 years and I certainly understand the advantage of a home-game crowd, but I think it’s an expense within this district that might be pretty hard to justify unless it were totally raised by donations.”\n\nGuy estimates that it would cost anywhere from $700,000 to $1 million to have artificial turf installed at Hackley. “Could be more or less,” he said.\n\nTony Williams, vice president of the Muskegon Big Red Athletic Foundation, emailed MLive a 2016 proposal from FieldTurf USA, Inc., that illustrated a total project estimation of $710,104.60 to install an artificial surface in Hackley Stadium.\n\nWilliams said that there has been a lot of discussion in the last 15 years for putting FieldTurf in Hackley, but no real action. He highlighted that the project would not be funded by school-district money. He said that strict guidelines of budget in the district will prevent a turf project from being approved by the public.\n\n“Administrators are afraid to back such a proposal in fear of the backlash from the public,” Williams said. “The only way this project will be completed is by private donors.”\n\nGuy and Fairfield are clear proponents of having artificial turf installed. Muskegon players have slipped on the field during non-contact drills or plays this fall, one even suffering a knee injury because of it.\n\nInjuries can happen any time in a football game, regardless of the playing surface, and Guy is cognizant of that. But with poor footing on a grass surface that turns to a mud pit, the chance for injury naturally increases.\n\nFairfield says that the argument of “both teams have to play in it” is a weak one.\n\n“It’s not even close because when Cameron (Martinez) or Japrie (Henderson) or any of those guys can come to the sideline, put their foot in the ground and make a dead stop and get a vertical cut, the (opponents) on these angles don’t have the advantage,” he said.\n\n“You don’t bring a drag strip (race car) to a mud run. And our kids have worked so hard to be strong, to be powerful, to be explosive, to get out of their stance, to start and stop on a dime. They worked all summer, all winter to do that, and when you put them out there (in the mud) you say, ‘Now you’re going to be half the athlete you were … .’”\n\nThe entire district would benefit from a synthetic surface at Hackley, according to Guy, and not just the high school football team. He said it would help the marching band, other sports teams like soccer, physical-education classes and lower levels of football.\n\nThe potential goes beyond those things, too.\n\n“Shane and I have talked about wanting to do a (statewide-type of football) showcase here for years, but we just can’t do it with the grass field because our field would take a beating at that point and wouldn’t last as long as it has already. That’s the main thing,” Guy said. “We want to do some of those type (of) events, we want to host some playoff games as well.”\n\nFurther reading:\n\nCameron Martinez to Earl Morrall: 25 greatest athletes in Muskegon High history\n\nChemistry, role players as crucial as top talent for Muskegon Big Reds\n\nMeet Damon Knox: A Muskegon High success whose story is still being written\n\nMuskegon High coach uses love and his own tough upbringing to steer players to success"
