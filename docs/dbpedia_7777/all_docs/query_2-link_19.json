However, the structure of the business school led to disappointment. The design of the curriculum demanded we undertake a multitude of courses outside our major before specializing, leading me to partake in classes in fields like philosophical logic and global health. While these courses were not my primary focus, they broadened my range of education and my intellectual curiosity.\n\nParallel to my academic journey, the city of Boston itself represented another aspect of my BU experience. Having become raised in the chaotic natures of global metropolises like New York, Shenzhen, and Taipei, Boston’s pace and quieter winters proved a challenging transition.\n\nThe early closing hours of shops and restaurants. Coupled with the city’s serene winters, proved a difficult transition for an individual like me!\n\nThe Talbot Building located on the medical campus houses the School of Public Health\n\nAmidst these challenges, BU has been a transformative force, profoundly shaping my personality and career aspirations. This institution introduced me to an extraordinary array of individuals – friends, mentors, and advisors who have become an integral part of my life. Their unwavering support and guidance have been instrumental in defining my outlook and preparing me for my professional career.\n\nIn retrospect, despite the rocky start and unexpected obstacles, my tenure at BU and life in Boston have been both enriching and rewarding. The downturns have been balanced by incredible relationships and personal growth. So, while my BU experience has indeed been a roller coaster ride, it’s been an exhilarating one that I would not trade for anything.\n\nBU, or Boston University, is a private research university located in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nLet’s discuss the academic prestige of BU. Moreover, the cost of living in Boston, STEM and liberal arts offerings. In addition, the history of the school.

I have been exposed to countless new cultures, religions, customs, and people from across the world. It is in stark contrast to the generally homogenous community of the public high school I attended before coming to Phillips Exeter!\n\nI can say with certainty that never before coming to Phillips Exeter did I sit around a Harkness table with people from up to four different continents at the same time. Furthermore, discuss the pressing issues that our society faces today.\n\nPhililips Exeter broadened my horizons greatly. In addition allowed for me to obtain a greater understanding of the world I live in.\n\nAs the math problems I faced in classes became increasingly difficult throughout my highschool years, I looked for help. I sought help from teachers, textbooks, online learning services, parents, as well as peers. Having a classmate or older student explain complex problems to me almost always yielded a stronger understanding than any of the other aforementioned methods.\n\nFor this reason, when I became given the opportunity to become a math peer tutor in my freshman year of high school. I graciously accepted. It began a bit rocky! As my level of understanding in certain areas was often less than or equal to the students who I was trying to help. However, this led me to seek a deeper understanding in all the topics I learned about. As a result, I was always able to assist those who came to me. It drove me to dig deeper. Furthermore, answer the “why” of every problem I encountered. Rather than just memorizing a method to get the right answer. This skill has served me well in many facets.\n\nHow hard is it to get into Phillips Exeter Academy?\n\nis Hackley a good school?\n\nPhillips Exeter Academy, located in Exeter, New Hampshire, is a prestigious, highly selective, co-educational independent boarding school.

While getting into Phillips Exeter Academy is challenging. It is also a highly rewarding experience for students who are seeking an academically rigorous and stimulating environment.\n\nHow hard is it to get into Phillips Exeter Academy?\n\nWhat does it mean to be an ‘Exonian’ or Phillips Exeter’s best students?\n\nWhat happened at Phillips Exeter?\n\nCulture is a complex anthropological concept. John Monaghan, in his book Social and Cultural Anthropology: a Very Short Introduction, writes that “there have probably been more anthropological definitions of ‘culture’ than there have been anthropologists.” From this, it is clear that even at the scholarly level, there is difficulty nailing down an all-encompassing definition for the term.\n\nEvidently, there will exist similarities between different definitions of culture, which can be used to generally characterize what is, and what is not culture. It is through these similarities that a working definition for culture will be synthesized, and used to analyze the origins of cultural identity at Phillips Exeter Academy.\n\nAlso in Social and Cultural Anthropology: a Very Short Introduction, Monaghan says that “however we define culture, most anthropologists agree that it has to do with those aspects of human cognition and activity that are derived from what we learn as members of society, keeping in mind that one learns a great deal that one is never explicitly taught.” Here, the insinuation is that culture is a summation of thoughts and actions learned over time, and also that it is learned indirectly, rather than taught in something akin to a classroom environment. The idea of learning culture is studied more in depth by Katherine Dettwyler in Cultural Anthropology and Human Experience: The Feast of Life. She says that culture can be simplified into three categories: what’s inside people’s heads, what people do, and what people make.\n\nWithin the first category, she emphasizes that culture is learned, shared, and patterned.\n\nMoreover, it becomes learned because culture isn’t steadfast, it is constantly changing. Culture is shared since individuals will have overlap in terms of the beliefs, knowledge, and attitudes which help them identify with a particular group. Culture is patterned because “we find organized systems of thought and belief, patterns of thinking and systems of knowledge, not just a random hodgepodge of factoids and unrelated ideas.” Specifically, it is this pattern of ideas and factoids that gives culture significance.\n\nComparing the two expanded definitions of culture from both Monaghan and Dettwyler, a few concepts are clear. Culture is not instantaneous.\n\nThat is to say, it takes time to develop. Also, there is no explicit teaching, but rather it is ingrained into the individual by the society in which they exist. Logically, the next question is how exactly culture becomes ‘ingrained’ into an individual.\n\nIn the book The Best of The Best, the author Ruben Gatzambe-Fernandez explores the development of cultural identities at “Weston”, a pseudonym for the elite boarding school Phillips Exeter Academy, or “Exeter”. He evaluates admissions, language, and framing, in his consideration of how a student comes to identify themselves with Exeter, which is most often through the use of the term “Exonian”.\n\nThe first step towards a student identifying themselves as an Exonian, and thus a member of the group of people which form the culture at Phillips Exeter, is the admissions process.\n\nStudents, not made aware of the explicit reason that they become admitted to Exeter when they receive notice of admission. The effects of this are twofold. One, it disbands the possibility of a student who did not become admitted comparing themselves to those who were with specific evidence as to why.\n\nSecondly, “it is the initial step toward internalizing the notion that, while ‘Weston is not for everybody,’ it is certainly for them.” The offer of admission confirms this notion in the student’s mind. It is a rite of passage. Meaning it represents a passing from one world to another, in this case, the transition into Exeter from a different school environment.\n\nWithin the broad category of rites of passage, there exists a subgroup of transition rites, exemplified by the likes of betrothal, or in this case, initiation.\n\nAfter students receive their admissions letter, students reflect on why they belong at Exeter. Jack Mitchell, one of Fernandez’ interviewees, attributes his acceptance to his willingness to have meaningful discussions. In his admissions interview, he recalls saying:\n\n“I feel that I always have things to say, and if I don’t have things to say, I’m interested in what someone else has to say.”\n\nAs Fernandez mentions often, discussion skills are crucial to becoming Exonian, and Jack is trying to show that he has what it takes.\n\nWhen Jack is explaining why he believes he belongs at Exeter, he is legitimizing his presence there.\n\nThe term Legitimation, as defined in Peter Berger’s The Social Construction of Reality is “this process of ‘explaining’ and justifying.” In this instance, legitimation takes the form of spoken language, and allows Jack to rationalize his place at Exeter. He reasons that because he is good at discussion, one of the key parts of becoming an Exonian according to many students interviewed by Fernandez, he deserves to be at Exeter.\n\nis Hackley a good school?\n\nis Hackley a good school?\n\nPost admission, and the legitimation of their own personal place in the ranks of Exeter students, individuals continue to construct their cultural identity through language. “Language might be called the domain of articulations … Language can also be compared with a sheet of paper: thought is the front and the sound the back; one cannot cut the front without cutting the back at the same time.”\n\nFurthermore, Language becomes connected to thoughts. Which are key to internalizing a particular cultural identity. The word that Fernandez found most intertwined to the cultural identity of Exeter students is “smart”. A good way to see this becomes through the constructing of boundaries between groups on campus. Who become considered “smart”, and those considered not. “Students use the category of PG as a way to distinguish and draw boundaries around themselves as Westonians who are smart and work hard.” The word smart becomes associated with exclusively students who are not of the PG category.\n\nSince most students view PGs as “Weston students who are not Westonians”. As a result, distinguishing themselves from PGs thus makes a student more “Westonian”.\n\nIn essence, language becomes used to reinforce their cultural identity as Westonian. As a result of separating themselves from the group considered not to be. In addition to language, there is another underlying anthropological concept in this method of cultural identification. It is framing. Frames “are mental structures that shape the way we see the world.” An example of a frame would be that Ethan is a PG, so Ethan is dumb. It allows individuals to reinforce their own ideas about culture.\n\nCulture has no unilateral definition.\n\nis Hackley a good school?\n\nHowever, the case study of Phillips Exeter provides great insight into what exactly culture has manifest itself into. Additionally how it becomes constructed. Furthermore, students at Exeter begin as outsiders. Thus, begin the creation of their cultural identity as Exonians upon acceptance to the institution. From there, they legitimize their presence.\n\nIn conclusion, language structures to separate themselves from those considered not Exonian. And thus, more closely associating themselves with the term. Furthermore, it is a process that takes time, as culture is not instantaneous. Lastly, through what they think, what they do, and what they make. Exeter students slowly come to associate themselves with the cultural identity of an Exeter student, being Exonian.\n\nis Hackley a good school?\n\nis Hackley a good school?\n\nPhillips Exeter Academy | Exeter\n\nhttps://www.solomonadmissions.com/phillips-exeter-academy-admissions\n\nHow to Get Into Phillips Exeter Academy – Test Innovators\n\nPhillips Exeter Academy – Acceptance Rate, Tuition, Ranking, and More – collegegazette.com\n\nMost Selective Boarding Schools in America (businessinsider.com)\n\nSmith College | Knowledge.
