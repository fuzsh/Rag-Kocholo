        "text": "E-Books | Feature\n\nNot-So-Extreme Makeover\n\nAs school libraries shift their reference materials from print to digital, educators are seeing the wisdom in the move.\n\nFor Hackley School in Tarrytown, NY, the decision to make the switch from print to digital library resources came in a flash. A ï¬‚ash of lightning, to be specific. In mid-2007, the school's 100-year-old library building burned to the ground after being struck by lightning. No one was injured in the early morning blaze, but the library's extensive reference collection wasn't so fortunate.\n\n\"There was nothing left but the walls,\" says Laura Pearle, head librarian for the private day and boarding school that serves about 850 K-12 students. The destruction left Pearle and the rest of the staff with the task of rebuilding the library's collection of books and reference materials. At the heart of the effort was one big question: Repurchase print materials lost in the fire, or replace them with online and digital resources?\n\nHackley's decision? Digital all the way--or at least wherever possible.\n\n\"We went to the different departments and said, 'This is your chance to create a perfect collection. You tell me what you think we need on our shelves,'\" Pearle says. \"When they said, 'We need these reference books,' I looked to see if we could purchase them digitally.\"\n\nBefore the fire, Hackley had subscribed to a number of databases, but they were underused, Pearle says. The school opted to convert to electronic resources wherever they were available, and to not purchase replacement print materials when there was a digital solution available-- a decision that wasn't popular with all its faculty members at first.\n\n\"It took them some time, but they came around,\" Pearle says. \"We stress to teachers that this will help students, and we show them the age of print materials versus the freshness of digital content. Now the majority of teachers feel that for reference, digital is absolutely the way to go.\"\n\nIn many ways, Hackley's rebuilding process was a dramatic and accelerated version of the shift school libraries around the country are going through as they work to equip students with the research tools and skills that will meet their 21st century needs.\n\nMeanwhile, reference book publishers like World Book, Scholastic, and Gale, whose names were once synonymous with the bulky print volumes of yesteryear, have reinvented themselves for a digital world. And they continue to adapt their online research tools to answer the changing demands of schools, as libraries move from being repositories of the printed word to campus media and technology hubs.\n\nREINVENTED Well known reference book publishers such as World Book have adapted to schools' changing needs by developing a wealth of digital resources.\n\n\"This isn't your mother's encyclopedia,\" says Gayle Geitgey, a former school librarian who is now the integration specialist at INFOhio, a statewide virtual K-12 library that provides online educational resources, including research databases, to schools and students in the state of Ohio. \"They're not just electronic resources any longer; they're 21st century resources.\"\n\nTake the case of Gale, which maintains more than 600 databases in various forms. In 2010, the publishing group reconfigured several of its databases on topics including science, history, and biography. The new database series, which is called In Context, includes audio, video, interactive maps, text-to-speech translation, and customizable reading levels. Gale recently launched an iPhone app called AccessMyLibrary, which makes available to students any of their school library's Gale resources.\n\n\"Rather than hiding assets behind tabs, it now has the look and feel of a website,\" says Peter Scott, school library publisher for Gale. \"We're making sure multimedia is front and center.\"\n\nOther educational publishers have taken a similar approach, enriching their content with podcasts, video, and audio components. World Book, whose World Book Web databases are available in three versions for varying grade levels, also offers translation into 30 languages. Scholastic's Grolier Online database, which provides a reading-level ranking for each entry, links to thousands of outside websites, all of which are reviewed by Scholastic's researchers for content and reading level.\n\n\"The most basic shift is that all of our material and the enterprise of learning are no longer location specific,\" says Paul Kobasa, World Book's editorial vice president and editor in chief, observing that students can tap into digital resources from anywhere they have internet access. \"That's having an impact on how teachers teach and how learners learn, and on us as providers of educational content.\"\n\nMaking information available to all students, regardless of location, is one of the goals of INFOhio. The organization, which is a project of the Ohio Department of Education, provides a statewide database featuring a core collection of about a dozen databases covering art, literature, science, reference, newspapers, and magazines. Any Ohio student can access the databases from school and public libraries, or at home through a login and password.\n\nBut it's not enough to just provide the databases. \"If we have these great resources, we want to make sure students are using them,\" says INFOhio Executive Director Terri Fredericka. \"If we say we want kids ready for college, we need to not just provide resources, but show them how to use them. We have to make sure they're embedded into the classroom.\"\n\nIntegrating digital resources into students' learning experiences is Keith Schroeder's ongoing mission. As the library media specialist at Bay Port High School in Green Bay, WI, he has stopped purchasing print-based reference materials.\n\n\"We had an awesome, extensive [print] reference collection,\" Schroeder says. \"My problem was that I very seldom saw reference books being used. They got moved to get dusted, and were put back.\"\n\nThe school's library still has shelves of reference volumes, but they're a dwindling species; as Schroeder acquires e-books and online databases, he discards other printed books. Now Bay Port students rely primarily on resources like Encyclopedia Britannica online, World Book, Gale Virtual Reference Library, and EBSCO History Reference Center. The Bay Port library is home to about 30 desktop computers, with 60 computers on wheels and computer labs throughout the school. Students can also access all school databases from home."
