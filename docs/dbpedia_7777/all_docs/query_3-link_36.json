        "text": "In Westchester, the class of '99 has many faces. Here is what some of its members had to say when interviewed by Elsa Brenner.\n\nLooking for a Role In Local Politics\n\nWHO -- Jeremy Weinberg, 17, New Rochelle High School.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS -- President of the school's chapter of the National Honor Society, member of high school's model congress, writer of poetry for the school literary publication Opus.\n\nAFTER GRADUATION -- ''I plan to enroll at Cornell University and major in policy analysis and management. I want to study government, economics and sociology with the goal of one day playing an active role in local politics.''\n\nTHE BEST -- ''The best part of high school was the kinship I developed with my classmates and, perhaps more important, my teachers. Shared interests and a collective desire to excel transformed many of my classrooms into settings that resembled a family home more than a place of learning. It was an amazing experience to learn and grow with a group of others.''\n\nTHE WORST -- ''The worst part of high school was having to see peers of mine who lacked the desire and motivation to care about what they were doing. It was difficult for me to accept that some people cannot be made to take pride in achieving in the classroom. I always hate to see people who have no passion for anything.''\n\nTHE UNEXPECTED -- ''What surprised me the most in my high school experience would probably have to be my school's reaction to the verdict in the O. J. Simpson trial. Many people expected that a school as ethnically diverse as New Rochelle High School would erupt at the climax of a racially charged event like that trial. However, there was a great amount of peace after the verdict was announced. It was quite a pleasant surprise.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
