        "text": "ALTHOUGH increasingly selective and expensive, private day schools in this area are becoming increasingly popular. Enrollment is rising even as the student population at both public and parochial schools in the county is declining, and despite an uncertain economy.\n\nWhile the county continues to attract young families drawn by the promise of good public schools, there is growing evidence that some families are choosing a community for its proximity to good private day schools.\n\nFigures released by the state's Department of Education show public school enrollment in the county is down 4.4 percent from last year, and parochial school enrollment dropped 3.4 percent. At the county's nonpublic schools, however, which include schools with some relgious affiliation and independent institutions, enrollments have increased by 8.8 percent this year. Measured in real numbers, the increase is small, representing an enrollment jump of 619 students. However, the trend has been steady for the last several years and was particularly evident this year.\n\nMost new private school students are being absorbed by a very small number of independent schools that have made a conscious decision to expand, such as the Hackley School in Tarrytown and the Harvey School in Katonah.\n\nMost well-established independent schools in the area say they are not expanding and their admissions directors describe the wave of new applicants as a ''crush'' or a ''deluge'' that is forcing these schools to be highly selective. Several have established earlier deadlines for accepting applications but still report applicant to acceptance ratios of 4 to 1.\n\nParents wait patiently for interviews, seeking what they believe will be more individualized attention, more options, more challenge and more structure for their children. They are willing to pay tuitions that in the next academic year will approach $6,000 for the upper grades in several area private schools.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
