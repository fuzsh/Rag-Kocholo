        "text": "There are a host of private schools in the area, from stalwarts like Bruswick School and Greenwich Academy, to newer institutions like Stanwich School. From Tarrytown to Greenwich, we have you covered\n\nBrunswick School\n\n100 Maher Avenue and 1252 King Street, Greenwich\n\n203-625-5800\n\nYear Founded: 1902\n\nHead of School: Thomas Philip\n\nGrades: Pre-K-12\n\nEnrollment: 940\n\nAverage Class Size: 15\n\nStudent/Teacher Ratio: 5 to 1\n\nTuition: $25,600-$33,300\n\nAP Courses: 33\n\nFirst Day of School: September 7\n\nBrunswick School, a college preparatory boys’ day school for grades pre-K through 12, believes in the potential of each and every student, and endeavors to teach them to lead their lives as men who practice the attributes of the school motto, “Courage, Honor, Truth.”\n\nOften referred to as “the best of both worlds,” Brunswick’s coordinate program with Greenwich Academy allows each school to take advantage of certain aspects of single-sex education, yet also offer coed classes in grades 9-12.\n\nAlong with a new era in science initiatives this fall, Brunswick continues to offer a wide variety of academic, athletic, and artistic programs, including 33 AP courses; 16 varsity and 18 sub-varsity sports; 36 extra-curricular opportunities; comprehensive visual, arts, drama and music programs; mandatory community service participation at all grade levels; and a language department that includes Arabic, French, Italian, Mandarin, and Spanish, along with a full Classics program in the study of Latin and Greek.\n\nIn Science, a rigorous curriculum is offered at every level. For Lower School students, the hands-on, inquiry-based program promotes curiosity. After-school clubs, including Lego Robotics, Young MDs, and Odyssey of the Mind, encourage participation in science competitions that often land students at the national level.\n\nIn Middle School, newly equipped lab facilities allow for advanced and interactive experiments in earth, life, and physical sciences. Upper School will launch an intensive advanced science research program available to 10th and 11th graders. The initiative will provide state-of-the art laboratories and analytical balances, along with science electives — primarily investigation-based — that include Molecular Genetics/Microbiology; Forensic Science; and Microbes, Plagues, and Human Diseases. Students will be encouraged to focus on completion of an original science project over the course of two years. By employing innovative laboratory techniques and learning the process of writing scientific papers for publication, the goal will be to participate in such prestigious pre-college science competitions as Intel Science Talent Search.\n\n“For over a century, Brunswick School has maintained its core mission: to educate the whole boy and to prepare him for a successful and meaningful life after graduation,” said Headmaster Thomas W. Philip. “We have successfully developed an educational experience that combines traditional learning, self-discipline, and character development. The launch of our new science research program will encourage students to be a part of our country’s future.”\n\nStanwich School\n\n257 Stanwich Road, Greenwich\n\n203-542-0055\n\nYear Founded: 1998\n\nHead of School: Patricia Young\n\nGrades: K-9\n\nEnrollment: 375\n\nStudent/Teacher Ratio: 7 to 1\n\nTuition: $21,950-$30,500\n\nFirst Day of School: September 6\n\nOn September 6, Stanwich will open its Senior House, welcoming tenth-grade students to the school. The Senior House is an innovative extension of the Lower School and Junior House programs, building upon the character development and academic preparation that have defined Stanwich School.\n\nThe focus on mind, body, and spirit guides both the curriculum and the daily life at the school, and promotes balance in students’ lives. Moving beyond the memorization of facts, the curriculum is designed to inspire students to think deeply and critically, working individually and collaboratively, to make connections between school and personal experiences, as well as across disciplines, cultures, and time. Stanwich maintains high academic standards and expectations to prepare graduates for college and beyond.\n\nNEW TEACHERS\n\nErin Dolan\n\nArt Teacher, Lower School\n\nMs. Dolan joins Stanwich from The Rock Renew Foundation, where she served as Art Director. She has also been an art teacher and chair of the Art Department at The Browning School in New York City. She holds an M.A. from New York University and a B.F.A. from Southern Methodist University.\n\nTom Faxon\n\nDirector of Admissions\n\nMr. Faxon worked previously at The Master’s School in Dobbs Ferry, where he served as Associate Director of Admission, Upper School. He holds an M.A. from Wesleyan University and a B.S. from Union College.\n\nPeter Katona\n\nHistory Teacher, Upper School\n\nMr. Katona joins Stanwich from City College of New York, where he served as adjunct professor.

She holds an M.A.T. from Tufts University, an M.A. from Tufts University, and a B.A. from Georgetown University.\n\nMark Milostan\n\nLatin Teacher, Upper School\n\nMr. Milostan has taught Latin I, II, and III at Wye River Upper School in Maryland, and also taught world history and mythology. He holds an M.A.L.A. from St. John’s College and a B.A. from College of the Holy Cross.\n\nKeith Radcliffe\n\nTeacher, Grade 1\n\nFor the past two years, Mr. Radcliffe worked at Stanwich as a full-time intern in the school’s Primary House. He holds an M.A.T. from Manhattanville College and a B.A. from Western New England College.\n\nBen Suro\n\nScience Teacher, Upper School\n\nMr. Suro joins Stanwich from Xavier High School in New York City, where he taught both biology and chemistry. He holds an M.S. from St. John’s University, a B.S. from Mercy College, and an A.A.S. from Genesee Community College.\n\nThe Masters School\n\n49 Clinton Avenue, Dobbs Ferry\n\n479-6420\n\nYear Founded: 1877\n\nHead of School: Maureen Fonseca\n\nGrades: 5-12\n\nEnrollment: 600\n\nStudent/Teacher Ratio: 8 to 1\n\nAverage Class Size: 14\n\nTuition: $32,710-$47,780\n\nFirst Day of School: September 8\n\nThe Masters School engages students in grades five through twelve in a rigorous academic experience. At this day and boarding school — with students from 22 countries and 16 states — students develop as flexible, creative and original thinkers who are collaborative learners and doers with keen self-knowledge and inner compass.\n\nA distinctive aspect of the Middle School is that boys and girls in grades six through eight are taught in single-gender classes. In the Upper School, all classes take place around oval tables, allowing for interactive, seminary-style participatory learning.\n\nStudents participate in a wide variety of extra-curricular programs, including visual and performing arts, athletics, and community services. The presence of boarding students and faculty who live on campus creates a rich and lively campus experience for all.\n\nThis year, Masters has added an additional turf field for soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse, as well as a competition-size track. With these new facilities, indoor and outdoor track teams will be introduced for the winter and spring seasons, respectively.\n\nIn addition, the Middle School language program has been expanded. All sixth graders will now study Latin, and seventh and eighth graders can elect to study Latin, Mandarin, French, or Spanish.\n\nA new ceramics studio will enhance the school’s offerings in this medium.\n\nThe Harvey School\n\n260 Jay Street, Katonah\n\n232-3161\n\nYear Founded: 1916\n\nHead of School: Barry Fenstermacher\n\nGrades: 6-12\n\nEnrollment: 340\n\nAverage Class Size: 11\n\nStudent/Teacher Ratio: 6 to 1\n\nTuition: $31,000-$31,950\n\nFirst Day of School: September 6\n\nAs Harvey prepares to open for its 95th year, they also celebrate the 25th year of Headmaster Barry Fenstermacher’s tenure. Mr. Fenstermacher came to Harvey in 1986 from the Masters School, where he served as Director of Admissions, and he is now one of the longest tenured school heads in the region.\n\nThe school begins the 2011-12 year with 101 new students, who come from over 75 different schools and communities. Harvey presently enrolls 340 students from ten counties in the tri-state region, including students from every zip code in Westchester County. Among the 340 students will be 28 five-day boarders, a new high for Harvey.\n\nIn addition to the new students, there is one new faculty member, Andrew Tyson, who comes to Harvey from Abu Dhabi, where he served as the lower school music teacher and band director of the GEMS American Academy. Mr. Tyson will teach instrumental music and direct the school ensembles in both the Middle and Upper schools.\n\nThe big news on campus is the much-anticipated opening of the new athletic center. The as-yet unnamed building will contain two full-size basketball courts, a fitness center, offices, and locker rooms, effectively tripling the capacity of the current gymnasium. Completion is scheduled for mid-winter, so the school is hopeful of making use of the new space this winter sports season. Harvey is also constructing four outdoor tennis courts, so both winter and spring athletes have something special to look forward to.\n\nWith new faces and a new structure taking shape on campus, the 2011-12 school year should be a memorable one for The Harvey School. n\n\nConvent of the Sacred Heart\n\n1177 King Street, Greenwich\n\n203-531-6500\n\nYear Founded: 1848\n\nHead of School: Pamela J Hayes\n\nGrades: Pre-K-12\n\nEnrollment: 777\n\nStudent/Teacher Ratio: 7 to 1\n\nAP Courses: 17\n\nTuition: $15,600-$33,300\n\nFirst Day of School: September 6\n\nConvent of the Sacred Heart, Greenwich is the only independent, Catholic day school for girls and young women, from preschool through grade 12, in New England. True to its international heritage, the school provides students with experiences in multi-cultural education and welcomes students of all races, socioeconomic backgrounds, and religious beliefs.\n\nThe school is committed to educate to a personal and active faith in God; a deep respect for intellectual values; a social awareness which impels to action; the building of community as a Christian value; and personal growth in an atmosphere of wise freedom.\n\nSacred Heart has brought new technologies to its curriculum and created academic programs that are timely and relevant, such as Broadcast Journalism, Lego Robotics, and Web Design. The modern campus has a comprehensive broadcast studio and editing facilities, classrooms equipped with ceiling-mounted multi-media projectors, digital document cameras, and interactive SmartBoards.\n\nThe library/media center has a collection of approximately 30,000 holdings, subscribes to approximately 60 different online reference and research databases, and has a growing compilation of more than 1,000 DVDs, videos, and electronic books for enhanced research capability. The school’s Cora E. McLaughlin, RSCJ Art Gallery attracts local and nationally acclaimed artists and also showcases the students’ and teachers’ talents. The school has a moveable dome observatory with a 16-inch telescope. In addition, there are ten 8-inch telescopes on an outdoor pad.\n\nContinuing a tradition of academic excellence, the 79 students in the Class of 2011 attend colleges and universities with strong national reputations. Among them are three National Merit Scholarship finalists, nine National Merit Commended Students, and one National Hispanic Scholar.\n\nThere are more than 30 student clubs at the school, many of which were initiated by the students themselves.\n\nSacred Heart sponsors 51 Upper and Middle School interscholastic teams in 14 sports, For the school’s aspiring photographers, artists, actresses, dancers and singers, there is a photography studio, several large art studios, a clay kiln, and a theater for plays, musicals, and choral performances.\n\nThe community service program provides opportunities for students to choose service sites where they will be in direct contact with the poor, the marginalized, the elderly, the sick, the disabled, or the homeless, to mention a few. This includes Sacred Heart’s commitment to a sister school in Uganda.”\n\nSacred Heart is distinguished by its faculty’s expertise, students’ successful college acceptances, and alumnae network. It is their hope that students will grow in compassion and have a deep sense of gratitude for the many blessings they have already experienced, which they express in service to others. Students leave Sacred Heart imbued with the values of Saint Madeleine Sophie Barat, founder of the Society of the Sacred Heart, who said, “Educate a woman and you educate a family. Educate a family and you educate a civilization.”\n\nGreenwich Academy\n\n200 North Maple Avenue, Greenwich\n\n203-625-8990\n\nYear Founded: 1827\n\nHead of School: Molly King\n\nGrades: Pre-K-12\n\nEnrollment: 800\n\nStudent/Teacher Ratio: 13 to 1\n\nAP Courses: 28\n\nTuition: $29,400-34,500\n\nFirst Day of School: September 7\n\nGreenwich Academy is an independent, college preparatory all-girls day school. The faculty consists of 140 members, 87 of whom have advanced degrees in their fields.\n\nUpper School classes, with the exception of freshman English and all levels of math, are co-ed with the neighboring all-boys school, Brunswick. This coordinate program offers an expansive curriculum, including 28 AP courses.\n\nThe Ridgeview Avenue Campus offers a premier learning environment for the Academy’s youngest students in Pre-Connecting and Connecting classes. The Upper School includes 20 classrooms, five science laboratories, a student center, a visual arts complex, and a 30,000-volume library/learning center with technology support. The Raether Athletic Center has five international squash courts and a double-court gymnasium. GA offers 15 varsity sports. The Wallace Performing Arts Center includes a 400-seat theater, choral rehearsal and practice rooms and visual arts galleries.\n\nThe Duff Center opened in fall 2009 to help students see the world as a campus. It focuses on fields traditionally underrepresented by women: STEM Initiatives (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math), Global Awareness and Service Learning, Environmental Stewardship and Financial Literacy. Greenwich Academy students in all three divisions compete in mathematics, robotics, and chess competitions and have placed nationally in the 10-and-under division of the National Chess Federation. This spring they won a teamwork award at the WORLDS Festival in St. Louis in the robotic competition.\n\nThe Independent Study Program was launched last fall. Working with faculty mentors, students propose independent projects that are reviewed by an Upper School academic advisory committee. Students receive credit for their projects, which can be last a semester or the entire school year. GA’s blossoming independent study program testifies to the student body’s growing interest in self-directed learning.\n\nGA students have pursued independent work inspired by their passions for art, science, literature, politics, journalism, and theater. They have conducted cancer research, written stories, examined voter turnout, studied marine ecosystems, deconstructed fashion magazines, and created artistic portfolios. They have written and directed documentary features, participated in gene-cloning research, and staged their own adaptations of Shakespeare.\n\nAt Greenwich Academy, academic excellence, love of learning, and commitment to community service align in supporting the school motto, “Toward the Building of Character”.\n\nHackley School\n\n293 Benedict Avenue, Tarrytown\n\n366-2642\n\nYear Founded: 1899\n\nHead of School: Walter Johnson\n\nGrades: K-12\n\nEnrollment:\n\nTuition: $30,900-$35,700\n\nFirst Day of School: September 6\n\nLocated on a 285-acre woodland campus, Hackley is a K-12 coeducational day and five-day boarding school. While visitors are drawn to the beauty of Hackley’s historic quad, many of the school’s facilities, such as the library and cross-country trails, opened within the last year. Recently added science and Lower and Middle Lower School facilities rival those of nationally-known boarding schools.\n\nFor 112 years, Hackley has welcomed students with the words carved over the entry: “Enter here to be and find a friend”. The warmth of the school community enables both challenge and nurture, giving students the means to set and attain high personal goals. Supporting student achievement in rigorous academics, arts, athletics, and community service, Hackley honors commitment and strength of character, with a mission statement that underscores the importance of these values: “Hackley challenges students to grow in character, scholarship, and accomplishment, to offer unreserved effort, and to learn from our community’s varying perspectives and backgrounds.”\n\nBy committing energy, time, and imagination to serving the needs of people beyond the school ground, students experience the satisfaction of helping others and gain appreciation for the complexity and concerns of the larger community. In this way, a Hackley education prepares students to think and act with care and effectiveness both in college and beyond.\n\nWhitby School\n\n969 Lake Avenue, Greenwich\n\n203-869-8464\n\nHead of School: Doug Fainelli\n\nYear Founded: 1958\n\nGrades: Pre-K-8\n\nEnrollment: 391\n\nStudent/Teacher Ratio: 6 to 1\n\nTuition: $23,300-$29,800\n\nFirst Day of School: September 6\n\nWhitby is the only school in the country accredited by both the American Montessori Society and the International Baccalaureate Organization (IB) for students 14 months through grade 8. Their approach to education recognizes children face a very different and challenging world in the coming years. As a result, Whitby strives to develop students who not only achieve academic success and acceptance at highly competitive secondary schools, but also have the knowledge, confidence, and skills to thrive.\n\nSince its founding in 1958, Whitby has continued to make professional development a priority. This summer, the school sent teachers for a variety of intensive Montessori and IB training. Additionally, with the assistance of nationally recognized consultants, Whitby revised its writing, mathematics, and science curricula to align with the new National Core Standards and the National Framework for Science Education. As result of the teacher dedication and hard work, Whitby is one of the first schools in the nation to meet the rigorous national core standards.\n\nWhitby will also be entering into cooperative partnerships for learning with institutions including the Guggenheim Museum of Art and the Connecticut Science Center. SoundWaters will assist in the instruction of Middle School students, including math and science lessons aboard the Schooner Soundwaters.\n\nThe new school year begins September 6 with an all-time high enrollment of 391 students. The school’s growth has led to the hiring of 14 experienced faculty members, many of whom have taught at IB or international schools."
