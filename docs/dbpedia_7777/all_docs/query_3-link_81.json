        "text": "Nelson Mandela said: \"Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.\"\n\nThe late Mandela was a South African lawyer, anti-apartheid activist, politician and statesman who spent 27 years in prison before becoming his country's first president from 1994 to 1999. He was an incredible world leader and credits education as the key to success.\n\nSome data is troubling: Benavente is lone vote against Fayetteville plan to place SROs.\n\nMost parents also aspire for their children to achieve great things in life, and for many, the success journey continues in a couple of weeks when the traditional school year begins. Some youngsters are still in K-12, and others will enter their first college years.\n\nParents: Go to parent-teacher conferences.\n\nWhat can parents do to support their children's success in education? For the K-12 group, several steps are necessary, starting with attending back-to-school nights and parent-teacher conferences. Over 40% of children failing in school have parents who are disengaged from their child's education and the school system.\n\nIn case you missed it: An elementary school-sized hole in Fayetteville, Cumberland schools resource officer plan\n\nPatricia Randall, a 30-year retired Cumberland County middle school teacher, encourages parents to help their children focus on returning to the learning environment. She also suggests that parents let their children know they will check on every aspect of their learning throughout the school year.\n\nCumberland students: Be determined\n\nWho's most likely to make it? According to some experts, it is not necessarily the smart ones.\n\n\"Some people succeed because they are destined, but the great majority succeed because they are determined,\" Dr. Lloyd Hackley, former chancellor of Fayetteville State University and A&T State University, said. \"When I meet people who have gained a high level of success. I give them the respect and admiration they deserve even though I have no idea how they got to the mountaintop.\n\n\"But when I learn something about their journey, what they had to overcome to become, the ones who fall into the determined category gain a bit more of my respect and admiration. I count myself among the determined.\"\n\nWhen students go off to college, bonds and boundaries matter\n\nWhen your child prepares for college, you will likely experience conflicting emotions. Hopefully, you have already forged a strong bond, because the boundaries are about to transform. Boundary issues may arise from social media connections, phone calls, texts or visitations.\n\nIf your child attends a school close to home, it could be a plus as you can see them more often. However, random unannounced visits might be too intrusive. If your child is attending college further away, try to visit them at least once a semester.\n\nA former college counselor from Fayetteville advised first-year students to attend all their classes; understand their syllabus; identify critical academic and student support services and locations; visit their professors during their office hours at least once a semester; and maintain a healthy balance of diet, rest, fun and studying.\n\nYou know your child better than any educator\n\nIt's a beautiful experience to witness your child walking across the stage at high school graduation and beyond. Not only did the student have to pass tests, but the support of family and other systems is crucial for success.\n\nYou know your child better than any educator when it comes to understanding their needs. It's important to recognize that their success depends on the collective efforts of everyone involved.\n\nTroy Williams is a member of The Fayetteville Observer Community Advisory Board.
