        "text": "Hackley is a school with access to resources, but it sometimes seems as though those resources are allocated to the wrong things. For example, the quality of the food is often questioned. The academics are solid, particularly in the humanities. There is a wide spectrum of kinds of students at Hackley: some students are wildly devoted to academics, while others seem less interested. One thing is for sure: graduating students frequently mention how well Hackley prepared them for their college experience.\n\nMost of the students Iâ€™ve talked to canâ€™t wait to leave. Iâ€™ve been at Hackley since second grade. Throughout this time, Iâ€™ve experienced many days where I couldnâ€™t handle it anymore and broke down in the bathroom. The amount of homework is unbelievably high and often you have to pick priority classes while suffer in the others. There are many teachers here who are blessings that I love, but there are also many who canâ€™t teach and want you to figure it out. There is a lack of vigor to the community here. Walking through the halls, noticing the stained rug embedded with dirt, the cheap plastic cups, plates, and bowls in the cafeteria, the funky smell of some hallways/classrooms, the lack of compassion the learning specialists/admissions have, the fixed tired expressions on all of my peers, the art teacherâ€™s destructive criticism and shaming of not only art, but people, and escaping through our phones. Ask yourself, am I in the right mental space to be there? ðŸš· children beware ðŸ†˜"
