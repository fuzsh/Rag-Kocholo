        "text": "[R75]: Of course, all students were required to attend chapel every day, including any that were Jewish. I remember, when we were all supposed to kneel, seeing them sitting where they were, upright, eyes open, presumably tolerant. There were only about 7 or 8 at any one time, in various forms. Apparently, the headmaster's blue blood New Englander first wife had a penchant for anti-Semitism. After she died, more were admitted, as well as the first black student, who was actually in my class.\n\n(What was funny was that the students rebelled against the system by carving all sorts of obscenities on the pews, which regularly had to be sanded off and refinished, especially before any official visits from outsiders.)\n\nThe experience of boarding school is indelible on my psyche. Though the academic education was excellent, the emotional support was virtually nil. You survived by developing a sort of posse of guys you hung out with: the jocks, the nerds, the theater types, the science geeks, the rebels. At one point, I remember standing in chapel, singing some hymn, and realizing that, though my fellows were gradually growing into the bodies of men, inside they were all the edgy, needy boys they were when they first came there. Myself included, of course.\n\nOn the other hand, when I attended college at B.U., though I spent most of my time acting in productions over at Harvard, I remained on Dean's List at B.U. Though I hardly ever attended classes, prep school had ground into me how to study for exams, and how to write essays. Q.E.D....\n\n[quote] I don't think Rye Country Day outranks Horace Mann. Or Dalton or Brearley. Maybe it's top ranked in Westchester.\n\nDo you mean socially or academically? Again, we are talking about two different things here, and Horace Mann is so different from Rye Country Day, Dalton and Brearley that comparing them is a case of apples and oranges.\n\nHorace Mann is one of the \"selective public\" schools in New York City: among the others are Stuyvesant, Bronx School of Science, and Hunter College High School. They have many of the smartest kids (and the best teachers) in NYC, but it is rare that wealthy kids attend them since they are not considered socially exclusive (any kid smart enough to get in can go for free): wealthy parents in NYC are much more likely to send their kids to private schools--either prep schools, or expensive private day schools like Dalton and Collegiate and Spence.\n\nAlso, as has been said many times, remember that the snootiest private schools are not always considered the best academically. For example, among girls' private schools in NYC, Spence and Chapin and Nightingale are considered the snootiest, but Brearley is usually considered to be better than them academically (it's also elite and expensive, but the emphasis there is really on academic achievement).\n\nI went to Madeira and was there during the Jean Harris murder scandal. It happened over our spring break and it was mind-blowing to see our tough but proper headmistress in handcuffs on the national evening news. (Just hearing Peter Jennings say her name was surreal. ABC reporter Lynn Sherr covered the story for months) The media kept saying what an exclusive school Madeira was and, yes, there were some extremely wealthy girls there but most were from upper middle class families (not billionaires) and several were on work - study scholarships. No different from a lot of private schools today. Some of the wealthiest girls dressed in old jeans and were very under the radar.\n\nIt certainly wasn't a finishing school environment. Quite the opposite. (One of the alums was Katherine Graham of The Washington Post family and she was a big proponent of women breaking the glass ceiling, ) To me there was a sort of \"Gloria Steinam\" ( Hillary) feel to the campus. We had some debutantes but more often than not most girls were the athletic or \"Hillary\" type. We didn't have classes on Weds and either interned at a local business ( or on Capital Hill for Jr year for a Congressman or Senator).\n\nThe murder of the girl in the woods on campus happened a few years before I got there. The rumor was that she was found tied to a tree. We had roll call at the start of every class and if someone wasn't there they would immediately go looking for you. In hindsight, what strikes me as so odd is that the dorm that I was in one year had no adult on site. They wd lock the dorms at night so we couldn't get out but we had no adult supervision in the dorm other than an 18 year old student Head of the dorm. (There was an adult on site for my other years at the school) We ha d lacrosse games with Sidw ell (where the Obama girls went) and Sat night dances with Episcopal and Woodberry. Seems like a million years ago. I don't have much to show for going there and live a quiet middle class life.\n\n[quote]National Cathedral School in DC has a reputation amongst the other all girl schools as being very snobby and there are plenty of very elite private schools in the DC area.\n\nA friend of mine and her older sister went to NCS. The youngest found the social scene so intense she transferred to a boarding school. Even though she was very popular. But there was a great deal of cruelty that was expected if you were top tier socially and my friend just hated it. I think it's a lot like Miss Porter's in that socially you have to be very tough and able to withstand and dish out a lot of bitchiness.\n\nAnyway, she transferred to a boarding school that had Contessas and Barons and other European royalty (can't remember the name) and she was happy as a clam. Which tells you something about the degree of snottiness at NCS.\n\nMy grandfather went to Mount Herman. He sent my father there, and my aunts to sister school Northfield. Then I went there, along with my cousins after the two schools merged and became coed. It was one of the largest prep schools until the Northfield campus was sold and the whole thing was consolidated at Mount Herman. I actually loved it and thrived there. It wasn't until years later, when I started thinking back on it, that the strangeness of the place began to sink in.\n\nNMH is definitely not in the top echelon of private boarding schools, but it still has a pretty amazing list of alumni. I think that's one of the distinctions about these places. Kids from all over the world are sent to these schools and there are a finite number of them. The parents of the full paying students are exceptional for one thing or another, and the scholarship students are usually exceptional for their own ability to swim in a new arena. DL faves Uma Thurman and Laura Linney both attended, as did Bette Davis!\n\nBut the really surreal part was the group of students from the real 1%. My family had money, but not anything like what I was exposed to when I attended NMH. I went from being the rich kid at home to the poor kid at prep school. And in retrospect that was probably a good thing.\n\nThe really rich kids, the ones from families of industrialists and DC politicos were often very fucked up. One girl was expelled -her father was the CEO of a Fortune 500 company - and she left the school by helicopter. It landed on a sports field, and before it took off she threw the contents of a couple of suitcases on field while screaming obscenities at onlookers. Another kid broke into the infirmary, stole a bottle of Demerol, and spent a Friday night getting his entire dorm high.\n\nThere were also the international students. They invariably broke every rule in the book, but were never punished. It was too complicated to enforce rules and expel kids back to Dubai. And they not only had money, but spent it there. They'd pay townspeople to keep their Mercedes convertibles in private garages and take off for Boston and NYC every weekend. I was the head of my dorm my senior year, and one of the international students had one of the big audio visual places from Boston come in a couple weeks before school started and outfit his room with every conceivable type of high end sound and video equipment. For one year. When he graduated he left it all behind.\n\nIt was definitely an interesting part of my growing up.\n\nAt Madeira our class sizes were small, no more than 20 people in the classroom. (And often around 15 people) That alone makes a huge difference in the quality of mentoring you can get. Instructors were solid in their backgrounds, some more than others There was a strong expectation that you would follow thru on homework assignments and do your best. it was expected that most students would be going to tier 1 or 2 schools. (Of course we had some students that went to state univ) We got a LOT of mentoring and attention. If you were struggling in any area your guidance counselor would be right on it and get you tutoring. Lots of PSAT and SAT prep. The college counselor was extremely thoughtful in helping me pick out colleges that would be a good fit for me and very invested in me personally as well.\n\nWe were exposed to so much (you could sign up for a field trip to the Kennedy Center to see Barishnikov dance or intern for a senator or at a place like NPR ). The social and professional connections were there for the ambitious students. You were 1 to 3 degrees away from someone who was tight with the Kennedys, or whose father was a high ranking exec at a Fortune 100 company or NBC, etc. A girl in your class could be the daughter of the head of Pepsi Cola, or from a publishing family that put out Nat Geographic, etc. We even had a couple of Rockefellers. But when you're with these people all day and live with them in a dorm on a small campus, they just become another classmate that you either become close with or at least establish a passing relationship. The alumnae could also be helpful in getting you closer access to people/internships/interviews.\n\nWhen they say \"youth is wasted on the young\" I have to painfully agree. I look back at all the advantages scholastically, socially and professionally that could have been seeded during that time that I wasted. So many girls went on to top schools (Ivy League, UVA, Dartmouth, Vandy, etc) and it was considered the norm. We were all ordinary people in a very advantageous environment but you don't always realize that until much later.\n\nOnce again DL's bizarre class obsession rears its head. Along with responses that were true 50 years ago when many DLers went to these schools.\n\nThe truth is that none of these schools are as you imagine them--filled with characters from Philadelphia Story, heirs and heiresses to vast fortunes.\n\nThe boarding schools are a mix.\n\nOne part upper middle class to wealthy kids who live in a part of the country where even the local day schools aren't that great. Beto -->Woodbury is a good example of this--his mom owned a successful retail store, his father was a politician, they were far from blue-blood heirs, but El Paso Country Day probably wasn't cutting it, so they sent him away for a year or two.\n\nOne part kids of divorced parents with high powered jobs who work/travel a lot -- sort of self-explanatory, again more upper middle class than \"blue blood\"\n\nOne part kids from families who have gone to Groton/Andover/Choate, etc. for generations. There are fewer and fewer of them these days and the parents, who are the age of most DLers, often don't want to send the kids away unless there's an underlying reason (divorce, kid is into drugs, etc.)\n\nOne part smart Jewish/Asian/South Asian kids whose parents think that it conveys some sort of WASPy social status (sort of like many DLers)\n\nOne part black and Latinx scholarship students--smart kids with involved parents who knew how to get them the scholarship, many are also athletes\n\nOne extra large part foreign students--Chinese and Middle Eastern in particular, who want their kids learning how to be \"American\" and also setting themselves up for easier admission to top US colleges.\n\nDay schools are mostly the upper middle class \"meritocracy\" families, a mix of kids who are second or third generation at the school and kids whose parents think sending them to Charlotte Country Day (I have no idea if there is such a thing) will make people forget they went to Appalachian State.\n\nTop prep schools in terms of name recognition are the usual New England and Virginia suspects.\n\nTop day schools are the usual NYC and DC suspects. Horace Mann (which someone upthread seems to have confused with Stuyvesant), Riverdale, Rye Country Day, Fieldston, Dalton, Trinity, Columbia Prep and Avenue are very Jewish. The girls schools more like 50/50 (Chapin/Brearly/Spence). The others are more mixed and obvs places like Sacred Heart and St. David's are mostly Catholic. And they're all a mix, some of the moms show up in Chanel, others in sweats and it's more about the personality than the bank account, all NYC privates are largely Wall Street money, even BK schools like St. Anns and Berkely Carroll. So rarely the \"blue bloods\" the OP was asking about.\n\nNo idea about DC schools, though Sidwell-Friends seems to attract more high profile liberal types--kind of like Brown U.--a few kids of big names and lots of regular people.\n\nThere are schools like Lakeside in Seattle that have reps outside their cities, but they're not as established as the East Coast schools and mostly new tech money, so a very different vibe than the East Coast schools.\n\n1/2\n\n[2/2] Suburbs are a weird mix--because East Coast burbs are tightly zoned, the local public is often highly desirable (e.g., Bronxville, Millburn, Rye, Jericho) and kids who \"fell in with the wrong crowd\" or \"need extra attention\" (e.g. dumb as a rock) get sent to private. Ditto families who choose to live in towns with big houses but bad schools (that part of Yonkers that's next to Scarsdale and Bronxville) and factor paying for private into the equation.\n\nBut in the South and Midwest it seems like far more UMC kids go to private school, that public options are good but not at the level of East Coast. (Mostly. There are exceptions, I am sure.)\n\nLA: Los Angeles is an outlier here. All of the private schools are relatively new. Pre-busing, kids on the West Side mostly went to the local public school (Uni, Pali, SaMo, BH) but post-busing, private schools started to take off. Harvard-Westlake has only been what it is in the last 15-20 years--it was a girl's school and a boy's military school as recently as the 80s. Mostly Hollywood families--the lawyers, producers and studio execs. Brentwood School, Crossroads and Windward are the other ones. It's the West Side, so those schools are also mostly Jewish, not \"blue blood\"-- if you want WASPs in LA, it's the Pasadena schools like Poly.\n\nSort of a novel, I know, but I grew up in that world and just reporting back.\n\n[quote] You tell someone that you went to Andover, Exeter, Miss Porter's, Deerfield, Woodberry, Madeira, EHS, etc.... you are automatically connected to a world of privilege, strong alumni networks, and worldwide connections. The doors automatically fly open.\n\nI think you've been watching too many episodes of \"Mad Men\" featuring Pete Campbell. That's really not the case so much anymore. I think it's more true with colleges--as I said upthread, I went to Yale, and I've certainly had a lot of benefits accrue to me from that connection. But I had friends in college who had gone to Andover and Exeter and Choate and Deerfield, and I don't think my friends who went to those schools got all that much more benefit from where they prepped compared to what they got from where they went to college, unless they went into investment banking.\n\nIt's just not the Fifties anymore. There are certainly a few places where the Eastern establishment really dominates (particularly in the judiciary and in Wall Street), but it's more about where you went to college and professional school nowadays than where you went to prep school.\n\n194 here and to R208, niece just graduated from a top tier University and the program book listed where everyone went to high school. Guess where most of them went...top tier prep schools..esp the ones who graduated cum laude or magna cum laude.\n\nOk enough with the Harvard Westlake. Do you work for the school? Seriously no one cares about that school except for you and maybe two others. We get it...YOU LOVE HARVARD WESTLAKE. But stick to the topic. No blue bloods go there. Just rich celebrity kids or entertainment execs.\n\nThe west coast is great. Beautiful weather and beautiful people. Can't that be enough for you? It's hardly a paragon of culture and intelligence. That's why all the best schools are on the east coast. There's no LA society! Just a bunch of entertainment folks. You have your academy awards. Enough already. Geez!\n\nThat was true in the 70s and 80s when a lot of DLers went to college, R211.\n\nNot really true now.\n\nAny top school trips all over itself to create the Most Diverse Class Ever Created and so they are particularly conscious of not taking too many kids from certain schools, prep schools in particular.\n\nAnd I'm seriously doubting your story about your niece, no matter how nicely it illustrates your point. No college would bother to put the high school anyone came from other than a recently recruited athlete. They'd put their hometown.\n\nAlso, neither R207 nor R208 mentioned Harvard-Westlake or any other school in Los Angeles. I did, but my take matches yours.\n\nI will never understand why so many gay men have an odd need to cling to the social mores of midcentury America, the same mores that kept them marginalized.\n\nCalifornia has never built up the same kind of boarding-school/summer camp network that's such a big part of the East Coast. Cate School is in the old boarding school prep-school model, but the other privates you hear about are day schools. So, they're not bastions of blue-blood snobbery in the same way the prep schools are, but there are some schools that pull their local elites--Harvard-Westlake in LA is considered the serious academic school of the privates down there. Castilleja is the elite private girl's school in Silicon Valley--it does work as a major funnel to Stanford and VCs and tech CEOs do send their daughters there. There isn't really a co-ed or male equivalent, though there are a lots of private schools.\n\nSome of the public high schools are very competitive and highly ranked. They send kids to Ivies and other top 20s. That said, when it comes to college apps, the privates do confer an advantage--not because the colleges are awed by them, but because the private college counselors work a lot harder to get kids into particular schools and tend to have tighter relationships with some of the colleges. The livelihood of a private school depends on that kind of results, whereas the public schools, even in the good areas, have other priorities.\n\nIt really kind of parallels the situation with colleges--the East has a bunch of well-established top-tier privates and average publics. California has a couple of top-tier privates (Stanford, CalTech and, arguably, USC and the Claremont colleges), but is just as known for having the top public university system in the country. Stanford's big rival is Berkeley, USC's is UCLA. Meanwhile, the Ivies play the Ivies and the public's are, literally, not in the same league.\n\nR212, perhaps you are out of touch bc I just attended the graduation ceremony and it, most certainly, listed their high schools. So you can doubt all you want.\n\nAs to your point as to why certain people cling to social mores of mid century America, I'm assuming the question is rhetorical. But it begs the question, why are you even on this thread if these \"social mores\" as you put it are so antiquated? Perhaps you should start a different thread about social justice and diversity.\n\nOne last thing regarding diversity at top prep schools...while they are more diverse than back in your generation, having attended quite a few in the last few years, it is still overwhelming white. So sorry to burst your bubble. When was the last time you attended a high school or college graduation?\n\nThis. ^^^^^. This is my first post in this thread btw. MillennialFriend, I enjoy your posts and want you to continue. But please know, yes things have changed, but you just might be too young to truly understand in the marrow of your bones (as some of us older members) that there is nothing new under the sun. The folks posting here who are older offer wonderful insight too, it’s just a different facet, though I understand you’re trying to present the most current trends, and I appreciate that. Multi-generational threads are my favorite, so let’s hear it all!\n\nWonderful fun reading this thread.\n\nMy only complaint, though it’s not technically the thread topic, is that this thread illustrates how much worse the divide is between the classes. As a married parent, we make a great living, and.......our family is bleeding us dry. We live in a upper middle class midwestern locale (quite close to New Trier), but the reality is that even with our terrific income, we could never afford to put multiple kids through private schooling AND elite college. It. Will. Not. Happen.\n\nI had a wonderful education. My kids are receiving a terrific public education. But there literally is no longer a path from upper middle class to the upper class. We’ve been cut off. Don’t cry for me Argentina, it’s fine. But if people like us are shut out, then lower middle class and the poor? They’re utterly locked out. The 1% have a lock down on ALL the power, ALL the money, ALL the prestige. Something is going to blow, the masses are tired of the rigged system. Operation Varsuty Blues my ass.\n\nThank you, now carry on!\n\nR219. Why are you posting here? Seriously. It's about private schools which maybe you attended or maybe you did not. You are correct. I did not attend but I also said I do quite well for myself so no anger here but I absolutely see the benefit bc I see it first hand which is why I posted here. So why are you here? You, however, seem to take offense that I referred to you as \"out of touch\" which you are. Something drew you to this post? Was it perhaps the same social mores that you referred to in the previous post? Or, ironically, is it to appear superior by implying you grew up in the environment but are above it all? Bottom line is this post has nothing to with whether you think private schools opens doors or not. It's about which are the most elite and blue blood. If you find the topic superficial and mundane, move on. But somehow I suspect you won't bc your intentions are quite transparent. Checkmate.\n\nUSC is not at the same level as Stanford, but it is, in terms of rankings, at the same level as Berkeley and UCLA. It's had well-ranked graduate and professional programs for years and, in part due to some generous merit aid, been climbing the undergraduate rungs. USNWR puts it at no. 22. Ratings are iffy things, but on some lists it's ahead of Brown and Vanderbilt.\n\nSo, not in the HPYSM or top 10, but in the top 25, whereas 25 years ago it was more like Pepperdine--rich kids party school, but with good sports and a terrific film department.\n\nAnd I still kind of hate the place.\n\nAnd, yeah, VC means venture capitalist. Steve Jobs sent his daughter to Castilleja. Thing is, at a certain point, some people are so rich, it doesn't matter whether the money's new or old, people want those connections. People don't spend a ton of time sniping about Jeff Bezos being nouveau riche--not when he can buy and sell entire countries.\n\nWith all due respect R227, I am 34 years old and not living in my parents basement, lol. Many of my friends are having kids and moving to the burbs or Brooklyn and so I am aware of where you're coming from. My point was that too many DLers forget that 1980 was 39 years ago and that the US and the American class system has changed dramatically since that time, including all of the schools mentioned in this list.\n\nAs for your other point--income inequality is a huge problem right now, but as several recent books have pointed out, it's less about the 1% versus everyone else, as it is the top 15% or 20% and everyone else. While the gradations in social class used to be much more shades-of-gray and people moved rapidly between them, there's kind of a stark drop-off now and the people on top are locking the gates and rolling up the ladders and doing everything in their power to make sure their kids stay there (which, in its most perverse form, becomes the Felicity Huffman scandal.)\n\nAs for USC, they're not the only school that figured that trick out. NYU, Boston U, University of Miami (off the top of my head) all did something similar, everything from building new dorms to create more of a campus feeling to offering lots of scholarship cash to smart kids from affluent families or instant admission to undergad+med school, which then created a buzz around the school in those towns which had a snowball effect, bottom line being they've all gone from being rich kid party schools to much more serious institutions. That said, they're nowhere near on par with Ivies/Standford or even that next tier (Duke, Georgetown, NWern, WashU, Vanderbilt, Chicago et al)\n\n[quote] The Hill has its own kinder/gentler culture, [R245], and while I like it a lot, it's out of sync with the rest of the planet (and certainly with the rest of DC) in many ways, it doesn't prepare its kids for \"real life.\" Hill kids tended to bloom at upper schools like Field and Edmund Burke.\n\nYes, I agree with all of this. What I remember about my Hill days was how small the school was, how excellent the teachers were, but also how babied we were. We were lectured constantly about the importance of maturity and applying ourselves, but with such a tiny school if a student is struggling with a subject the teacher isn't going to let them fail. No, you stay after class and get extra tutoring, all suggested, then arranged and given by the teacher. That's pretty exceptional and not at all like the real world.\n\n[quote]Gonzaga.....yikes.\n\n'Nuff said.\n\n[quote]USC is not at the same level as Stanford, but it is, in terms of rankings, at the same level as Berkeley and UCLA.\n\nUSC does well on lists like USNWR domestic universities, which incorporates a lot of soft “college experience” criteria. On lists that focus more on academics and research—Times Higher Ed global rankings, QS world rankings, ARWU, Round, and even USNWR’s *global* rankings, which use different criteria than the US only list—it is outranked not only by UCLA and Berkeley, but also by many other publics like Michigan and most of the rest of the UC campuses like Santa Barbara. Academically, USC simply does not rank.\n\nBut this is not about academic excellence, it’s about elitism. Traditionally, prep schools were places where WASPs would send their children for grooming and opportunity. They were not an academic meritocracy at all. They perpetuated a specific kind of social privilege for a particular demographic. And that’s what the Ivies were as well, at the university level. This has now changed, at least somewhat, with the push for diversity and equal access.\n\nFor those really interested in the way things used to work at prep schools, pick up The Preppy Handbook. It is marvelous, and its breezy tone belies a gimlet take on exactly this subject, circa the early 1980s.\n\nI went to an Ivy but come from a very humble background. So basically, I had to work my way in. Many students I knew were extremely wealthy, and still are. Though, other classmates who perhaps did not have as much family money but still pursued high-earning professions still don't seem to have as much money as those with family money. I know one student who went to Horace Mann and then my Ivy. Very wealthy. She is truly and utterly stupid. She went to some low-tier graduate school and became a marriage therapist. She lives in a 3 million dollar house in New Canaan and her kids attend 50k/year preschool. She has an office in Manhattan but I suspect she doesn't have any real clients, but just rents out the space. Another guy whose family was not as wealthy is an oncologist and lives in a 700k house in Virginia. Some of the kids I went to high school with in my very middle class, ethnic European neighborhood live in houses more expensive than that. So, I am not sure how much academic pedigree matters anymore. It just seems that if you come from wealth, you will stay at that level of wealth regardless, and if you build it for yourself, your gains will be modest.\n\nR237, I'm sure some wealthy kids go to Woodside Priory--it's in Portola Valley and the public high school in that area is no great shakes so people there and in nearby Atherton send their kids to private schools--but Woodside Priory doesn't have the snoot factor of Castilleja. It's Catholic, for one thing (the snootiest of the snootiest are mainline Protestant, particularly Episcopalian) and it's not that old (founded in 1957.) That said, Catholic schools tend to have more prestige in the Bay Area than New England (Italians, Irish, Portuguese, Mexicans have had a lot of cultural influence), but Woodside Priory isn't the top Catholic school either--Sacred Heart in Atherton is on the Peninsula, Bellarmine in San Jose, St. Ignatius and some others in San Francisco.\n\nR244, Yep, a bunch of mediocre universities in desirable places have leveraged their position to attract more desirable students--strangely enough, the show \"Felicity\" jumpstarted NYU's climb. Maybe you can tell me what's up with the University of Miami--didn't know it had become a thing until a friend's kid turned down Northwestern and chose U. of Miami instead. What's the draw?\n\nA friend of mine went to Georgetown for undergrad. She was interested in law and policy. She came from a poor family that didn’t offer much support, but she was very smart. It was rough for her. She was the poor one sailing on loans while her friends went to Europe holiday and had maids to come in to clean up.\n\nShe’s made a modest living as an attorney but has still struggled; the fabled connections that one makes at elite universities did not materialize for her. Part of advantage includes feeling entitled to it, without question, and she did not. Lacking that, or the charisma and drive to work your way into those enchanted circles, you may end up with as much advantage as you would at a state school, and much more debt to boot.\n\nThe Preppy Handbook is a marvel. Its success took everyone by surprise, most of all Lisa Birnbach. She acknowledges that she ended up diluting and irrevocably changing the culture it documented. The book is just a perfect balance of anthropology, humor, light parody and affection. It inspired many, especially those who did not read more deeply into the darker side of preppydom suggested by the book—conformity, emotional repression, etc.\n\nI was in elementary school in the ‘80s, and there were two cultural movements that shaped our lives then—valley girl and preppy. This was in a Midwest suburb, and I don’t think that any of us made the connection between the term “preppy” and wealthy east coast families or even prep school. It was a generic signifier for a particular style—Izods with popped collars, khakis and Weejuns—but even more so for a type: athletic, academically adequate to talented, good looking. Popular. Preppy was shorthand for successful, even in a middle class suburban Detroit public school. That’s how pervasive preppy influence was and how it became an aspirational, idealized image.\n\nI was in a school “for the gifted” for a couple of years, and we’d go to Cranbrook on field trips. It was beautiful. They had a big sand table for teaching archaeological digging, an art museum...I never thought to be envious, but the residents mist have pitied us poors!\n\nR260 That sucks and you know what's crazy - that the classmates with maids and jetting to Europe on the weekend were very likely no where near as smart or hard working as your friend, but they will end up wealthier doing half the work. If I hadn't lived and witness it myself, I don't know if I would have believed it, but it's the way it is.\n\nWith this whole college scandal, these parents are not worried that their kids won't do well in life or get the education they \"deserve,\" because they know they have tons money to give them....they are just worried that they can't keep up with their own friends and will face social embarrassment among their own peer group.\n\nMoney comes and goes. The post WII era in the U.S. was unprecedented in terms of social mobility and wealth. Thanks to the GI Bill and the expansion of the public college systems, college educations became available to anyone with brains and desire. You really could work your way through college. And, if you didn't, union jobs meant a damned good life. My parents grew up poor, but both were able to attend college and I grew up upper-middle class. But, more to the point, we had a housekeeper and she and her husband, a crossing guard, were able to buy their own home.\n\nA lot of people grew up with the idea that this is how things were, rather than a historical exception. If you were smart and worked hard, you'd do well and there would be opportunities. That's still true in some areas--i.e. Silicon Valley--but it's getting harder and harder and more and more exclusive. Rich people know this and so do the people who aren't rich, but are rich-adjacent--both physically and financially.\n\nAnd it plays out in the schools--wealthy people stick to private schools, even when the public schools are excellent, because private schools cater to them and make sure they keep up their connections with the elite private schools. Those college counselors will pick up the phone and plead for a particular kid at an admissions office. The wealthy-adjacent might go the public school route, but they'll spring for the private college counselor to help out their kid. They might not be able to do what the rich people are doing, but they're more likely to know about it.\n\nAnd everybody else can't figure out what's going on, but they know it used to be easier to get ahead and they're burning up with resentment about it.\n\n@R262 -- thank you\n\n@R259 -- Miami has some good programs-- their business school in particular. IIRC they do the \"we guarantee you a spot in our med school\" drill and, mostly, they were throwing serious cash at kids who, while they might not have needed it, were flattered to be offered a free ride or close to it . Plus the weather. Plus great internship possibilities in Miami, especially if you knew any Spanish. So all that.\n\n@R266 - that's funny. Did a little research, Birnbach was a Jewish girl from the UES who went to Riverdale (a very Jewish private school) and then Brown, so probably dated someone from that world and was able to have the outsider-on-the-inside perspective you needed to nail it so accurately. And I had read that too, about how the book, which was intended as satire for people in that world, sort of became a \"How-To\" book for people like R268--seems the US was coming out of 70s stoner culture to 80s yuppie culture and the timing was perfect.\n\n[quote] And it plays out in the schools--wealthy people stick to private schools, even when the public schools are excellent, because private schools cater to them and make sure they keep up their connections with the elite private schools. Those college counselors will pick up the phone and plead for a particular kid at an admissions office.\n\nYes and no R269. Depending on the town, some of those public high schools have serious connections to Ivy League admissions officers and the parents are all over that. Or to put it another way, I'd rather send my kid to a Scarsdale, Millburn or Palo Alto High School than a Country Day in a midwestern city.\n\nR270, I happen to know Paly really well. It's not the school connections that get kids into Stanford or the Ivies--it's the parental connections. While Stanford doesn't do a legacy bump, it does give a bump to faculty brats--guess where those kids go to school? The kids who get into the Ivies are legacies or sports recruits and the occasional bona-fide genius. California has a strong athletic culture (yay, good weather) and SV has athletes with parents who can afford Ivy prices. The thing that does work in favor of Paly (and Gunn, the other Palo Alto high school) is the school's reputation--it's seen, correctly, as a school of smart, affluent kids. Which does seem to help with the non-Ivies like University of Chicago or Grinnell.\n\nR273, Proposition 13. It killed public school funding. However, IF a district by a two-thirds majority decides to leverage a tax on itself to fund its schools, it can do so. And if it agrees to take a minimal amount from the state, it can fund up to any level it wants. These are called \"basic-aid\" districts--there are 80 of them out of 1,000 school districts in California. In those basic-aid districts, you will find some of the best public schools in the country and the highest housing prices--Palo Alto, Beverly Hills, --though also some small random districts are also basic aid.\n\nSo, there's a huge difference between a rich district and one that gets most of its money from the state.\n\nR271, Getting in mean passing an entrance exam and MONEY. Remember, no student loans and a small number of people rich enough to send their sons to a Ivy. That's another factor--the Ivies were men-only until the 60s (with the exception of grad schools). So, half the population not eligible and most of the rest unable to afford it in a country with a much smaller population--well, no, going to Harvard didn't take being astonishing.\n\nAlso--as a contrast to what R275 correctly explained about California, here's why East Coast states like New York and (especially) New Jersey have such good public schools:\n\nEach little town is its own school district and property taxes fund the school district.\n\nThe town boundaries are permanent which means that real estate prices go up accordingly, since the value of the house is tied to the value of the school district.\n\nWhich means that the residents are happy to pay for increases in property taxes to fund the schools, which have small private school sized enrollments because the town itself is small. Because paying $30K/year in property taxes is still cheaper than paying $60K/year in private school tuition.\n\nIt also means that those towns are very desirable places to live so that even dinky little houses will sell for big bucks (they'll often get torn down and fixed up) and that everyone in the town is upper middle class or higher and all fixated on the same goals (getting kids in to best colleges possible) which means the schools need to have as many AP classes as possible and serious college counseling departments and if they don't, you just raise property taxes again, it's still cheaper than private school.\n\nThe flip is you are probably paying $500K - $1M more for a house in one of those towns than you would in someplace with less intense schools, but the conventional wisdom is that the house will never lose value because people will always pay to live there for the school system.\n\nIn PA, we have local real estate funding for schools by town/district. It’s resulted in some of the best school districts in the country - and some of the worst. Real estate prices outside of the city are ALL about the school district.\n\nBut a side effect of that is the older good districts have HUGE pension and benefit obligations that are making taxes go up dramatically every year JUST to cover pension costs. They aren’t investing in current school needs. So people are moving to the exurbs where there aren’t old pension obligations and most of the money is going to the current school needs. Has resulted in insane real estate taxes in inner suburbs and lower taxes in exurbs that are filled with new families in McMansions who are paying half the taxes as inner suburbs."
