        "text": "“One of our goals was to make this a student center,” said Jason Edwards, Athletic Director of Hackley School. “We want students to enjoy themselves, but more importantly, the building says health and wellness and I think this fully encompasses that.”\n\nHackley worked with Advantage Sport & Fitness to design an impressive Precor-filled fitness center and a state-of-the-art strength and functional training room.\n\n“Advantage is the one that had the vision,” said Edwards. “They asked all the demographics of the school. They asked what we thought our needs were and they looked at our old facility. We just told them what we wanted and they created it.”\n\n“The layout here provides opportunities for students to workout and really enjoy themselves in this facility,” said Edwards.\n\nThe center also features an impressive strength and functional training room. Students from Hackley’s sports teams can often be seen here working to improve their athletic ability. The room features a custom turf track and a variety of Escape functional training tools including TIYRs, Bulgarian Bags, Corebags, and Plyosoft Boxes.\n\n“The workouts that we’re doing in here show us this turf was probably one of the best ideas Advantage came up with, because every kid is on it every day,” said Edwards.\n\nCustomized free-weights and lifting platforms add a dynamic of school spirit to the room.\n\n“Everything is color coordinated,” said Edwards. “We have our plates and dumbbells with our logo on them. Our plate weight has the split H. I don’t know of many weight rooms that have that.”\n\nAdvantage partnered with Hackley to design a solution that met the vision and goal of the entire Health & Wellness Center.\n\n“Now we have endless possibilities in regards to what we can do,” said Edwards. “You don’t see many colleges like this. We have a weight room and fitness center that accommodates every single need that you can think of for our students.”"
