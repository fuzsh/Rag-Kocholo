        "text": "MUSKEGON, Mich. -- A ribbon-cutting ceremony will christen the Muskegon Public Schools' new $35 million middle school on Thursday, May 2. It marks the district's first new school-building construction in 65 years.\n\nThe school sits on property formerly occupied by Mercy Hackley Hospital. Descendants of the renowned Hackley family will join M-P-S officials in formally opening the doors of Charles Hackley Middle School during a community celebration event that will run from 5:15 p.m. to 7 p.m. The ribbon-cutting will be at 5:30.\n\nOn Friday (April 26), the news media got a private tour of Charles Hackley Middle School and a chance to speak with district leaders. The three-story school building is at 1700 Clinton Street, which is near Laketon Avenue and Peck Street. The 133,000-square-foot school will open for classes next fall. It includes a three-story academic wing, a music wing, and a gymnasium, among other amenities.\n\nA $104-million bond passed by Muskegon voters in 2020 funded construction of the middle school. Mercy Health also donated some property for the project.\n\nHere is more information in a news release:\n\nThe hospital system gifted the property to the district in 2021 after it moved to its new campus on East Sherman Boulevard. The 45-classroom building can accommodate more than 900 sixth through eighth grade students when it opens in August for the 2024/2025 school year. The current Muskegon Middle School building will be closed and repurposed for future use.\n\nThe Christman Company served as general contractor and TowerPinsker led architectural and engineering efforts. Construction was funded as part of a $104m bond approved by voters in 2020 for the district. The former Mercy Health system donated the 15 acres. Crews started working on the property in May 2022 following the demolition of the former hospital in late 2021.\n\nAside from the many notable features of the new building, the MPS superintendent notes that the middle school's physical location will help change the community's perception of the district.\n\n“Charles Hackley Middle School symbolizes the tremendous support by our community to the district, and its central location will be a shining beacon of the innovative teaching methods and career-centered curriculum Muskegon Public Schools is offering,” said Matthew Cortez, superintendent of Muskegon Public Schools. “From state-of-the-art classrooms to modern architecture and functionality, this school represents the future of our district. The new school is about three blocks from Muskegon High School and is more centrally located, as requested by our community during the bond campaign.”\n\nWith hallways and winding corridors filled with natural light, the new school will provide plenty of room for up to 900 students to navigate. Key features include:\n\n45 academic classrooms\n\n6 science lab classrooms\n\nDedicated floors for each grade (Eighth grade on first, seventh on second, and sixth on third)\n\n2,076 SF media center\n\n6,175 SF cafeteria and dining area\n\n“Chill Zone” room for quiet learning and rest\n\nMusic wing with space for choir, band and orchestras\n\n11,000 SF gymnasium with indoor upper running track and bleacher seating for 700 that loads from the second floor.\n\nWeight room\n\nMultipurpose cardio room for yoga, dance and cardio fitness\n\n4 private stalled restroom systems.\n\nRegulation size athletic track and turf field capable of hosting football, soccer and lacrosse\n\nSTEAM lab with more than $250,000 of equipment\n\nNot as apparent to students and guests are the safety elements incorporated into the structure. From the shape of the building to blue light lockdown alarms and spectacular window designs, the new school is designed to provide the safest environment possible for students and facility visitors.\n\n“We have provided not only the most modern learning environment, but we’re also showcasing the district’s commitment to safety,” adds John Snyder, Director of Operations for the district. “The brightly lit environment provides our students a healthy and welcoming environment that helps them focus while keeping them safe. We feel this new building removes barriers while providing guardrails should we need them.”\n\nTeachers and staff from Muskegon Middle School will begin the process of moving into the facility as soon as the school year ends.\n\n“We are so excited to get into the new school and begin preparing for the 2024/2025 school year,” said LaKisha Loudermill, Charles Hackley Middle School Principal. “This new facility will expand the horizons of our students and staff in a way that just is not available in our current building. In doing so, we empower our educators and staff to explore new ways of teaching and connecting with our kids. We are so appreciative to the community for supporting this endeavor!”\n\nThe facility’s use of brick is a nod to the district's history and its brick-constructed schools. The school’s name is also an homage to Muskegon’s most notable family, the Hackleys.\n\n“The Hackley name is synonymous with Muskegon, and the family has been a wonderful friend to the district, so we felt naming the school after Charles Hackley would be a way to express our gratitude to their legacy,” Cortez adds. The great-great-grandson of famed lumber baron Charles Hackley is expected to participate in the May 2 grand opening festivities.\n\n# # #"
