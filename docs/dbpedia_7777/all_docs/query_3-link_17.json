The one who graduated got into 9/9 of his colleges, including his reaches. The school finds the best fit for your student and has many great connections at top universities. Colleges like Harvey students because they are kind, self-advocate, and contribute to the campus--all things that are promoted at Harvey. The school is about academics first and foremost but also focuses on joy and inclusion for all. It's truly a refreshing combination.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Parent\n\n5\n\nI have one child at Harvey and one who graduated.

It's truly a refreshing combination.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Alumni Parent\n\n5\n\nMy son started at The Harvey School in the Fall of 2020. In that time, I have seen him grow into a self-advocating, thoughtful, and bright student. My daughter just started high school there and after 2 weeks she is thriving - you are NEVER the new kid at The Harvey School. It's a welcoming community for parents as well with so many opportunities to be involved and get to know the caring faculty and staff. Enrolling my kids at The Harvey School was the best decision for our family.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Meredith H\n\n5\n\nThis is our daughter`s second year in middle school at Harvey, and her experience has been transformative. She`s become a happy, engaged student who truly enjoys her classes and doesn't want the school week to end! The small class sizes have been invaluable for her, and the attention, support, and encouragement she's received from teachers and peers have built her curiosity and confidence and helped her bloom into an articulate, self-possessed young person with strong critical thinking skills. Harvey offers a rare learning environment that's both caring and energizing. The class sizes are truly intimate so that teachers get to know each student well and can nurture their individual growth with focused attention, encouragement, and acknowledgment. Harvey has an atmosphere of warm congeniality without the burden of intense academic competition or social pressures. It feels like a happy, harmonious place where students can be themselves and explore their interests with authenticity. The scope of classwork is wide and deep enough to challenge our middle schoolers, and there`s a wide variety of appealing electives and after-school offerings, especially in the arts. We also appreciate the emphasis Harvey places on public speaking, with opportunities such as the school-wide speech competition and poetry recitation contest. These opportunities have helped our daughter learn to address others with confidence and poise-a valuable life skill. It`s a joy to watch her go off to school each morning with real excitement and to see her come home smiling.\n\n- Posted by Parent - LD\n\n5\n\nI have had 3 children attend Harvey for 3 different reasons and Harvey has been able to meet the needs of my children. Harvey's small class size, personal connection with teachers and staff, interactive and innovative programs each of my children thrived at Harvey. Harvey has a way of building self-esteem, giving the student confidence to try something they never would have tried elsewhere. My youngest started in 7th grade and his writing skills were strong and articulate. The curriculum and school community focuses on the development as a student as a whole. Teachers, staff, and administration I have found to be available to parent concerns in a timely manner. There are activities for a variety of interests and this is a place where the school athlete can also be the theater kid and on the robotics team. or clubs, and if it isn't there, your child can start it.... mine did :) Harvey strives for community. Harvey is definitely a Small School with Big Opportunities!!\n\n- Posted by Parent - class of '16,'18,'23\n\n5\n\nA Small School with Big Opportunities. Truer words could not be spoken when it comes to The Harvey School. Small class instruction allows for personalized attention, the ability for teachers to get to know each of their students on a personal level which allows for students strengths to be acknowledged and their weaknesses to be areas that they continue to work on, all the while building confidence and encouraging self avocation. A real community on so many levels, The Harvey School encourages students to try new things without the fear of making mistakes, fosters a real sense of inclusion in all areas whether academic, social, athletic, arts, etc., all levels of ability are celebrated. If you are looking for a small school with a warm, nurturing environment that pushes your child to understand that they posse the tools that they need to excel in academics and life beyond academia, The Harvey School is the place to make this happen.\n\n- Posted by Parent - LC\n\n5\n\nThe Harvey School has provided our son and family with an excellent academic and social experience. When considering middle school options for our son, we were looking for small class sizes that provided a dynamic learning environment and engaging community for students and parents. Harvey has exceeded our expectations and been a steady foundation for our family. The faculty and students were very welcoming and made our son feel like part of the community immediately upon enrolling as an 8th grader in Fall 2020, helping to build his social and academic confidence. The administration has effectively navigated the pandemic through transparent communication, constant vigilance, and agility to keep the community safe and maintain the in-person learning experience. The Parents` Association has been a wonderful outlet and opportunity for us to actively participate in our son's education, contribute to the school community, and has provided a built-in network of other parents to hear about different experiences. We consider ourselves fortunate to be part of such a wonderful community and look forward to our son's continued academic and social growth at The Harvey School.\n\n- Posted by Parent - proud mom\n\n5\n\nMy daughter is finishing 9th grade at Harvey and it's a testament to Harvey that she is both continuing to learn during this insane time (April 2020), and also that she misses school terribly. My husband and I have been impressed with Harvey during normal times; we are having trouble finding the words to express the extent of our gratitude and awe for the teachers during this unprecedented crucible.\n\n- Posted by Parent - DRU\n\n5\n\nThe Harvey School has exceeded my expectations on all levels. When we first enrolled our older son in eighth grade three years ago, we were looking for a smaller class sizes and an inclusive community. We found that and so much more. We found teachers going the extra mile academically and providing other kinds of support during and after school. We found students who welcome all, and advisors, teachers and administrators who reach out to check in. We found a warm community of parents-and we found lots of opportunities to have fun! Harvey is the real deal, and the school honors its mission statement of Rigor with Heart on every level. We now have two children at Harvey and couldn't be happier. As a footnote, the transition to e-learning has been seamless, and we are getting tons of support from the Parents' Association, teachers, and administrators. We even have after-school Zoom workouts, game afternoons and parent happy hours. We are so lucky to have found this gem of a school.\n\n- Posted by Parent - LB\n\n5\n\nHarvey is a terrific school for a kid who needs more support/attention than their local public school. My son didn't qualify for IEP or 504 but wasn't thriving. Harvey has been transformative. Also, the small size and enriched curriculum are amazing, he's been in a play, played a sport, and participated in robotics. He would not have done any of those at our public school.\n\n- Posted by Parent - kh\n\n5\n\nMy daughter came to Harvey from an area elementary school in 6th grade. She was not the most enthusiastic learner and often struggled to stay engaged and on task. Her teachers at Harvey immediately recognized not only her challenges but also her strengths. By getting to know her as a person and connecting with her on her interests, her teachers gained her trust and ignited her intellectual curiosity. The small class setting has made it easier for her to be comfortable asking questions and contributing to discussions which in turn helps to keep her focused. As she prepares to enter the Upper School, I am confident that she has the academic skills and confidence she needs to be successful.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Renee\n\n5\n\nHarvey is an incredible school! Students are able to dabble in a variety of activities from sports to the arts, an interesting array of course offerings and the attention of a very talented and devoted teaching and administrative staff. Parents are active and involved and the school has a number of family programs throughout the year. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Harvey is the ability of a student to be both a \"jock\" and a \"theater kid\" and be accepted on all levels.\n\n- Posted by Parent - grods\n\nEndorse The Harvey School.
