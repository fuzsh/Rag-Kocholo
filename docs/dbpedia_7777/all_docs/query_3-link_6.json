        "text": "Category: Private School Review\n\nDr. Paul Lowe: Why His Clients Love The Lawrenceville School\n\nLawrenceville is one of the Ten Schools and what makes it unique among other elite New England schools is that it is only one hour from Manhattan. Its enrollment is 818 students, but appears as a smaller school because of its unique house system. The Lawrenceville School sits on more than 700 beautiful acres in suburban New Jersey\n\nLawrenceville is one of the most prestigious, elite and highly selective boarding schools in the world. Its acceptance rate is 19%.\n\nWhat are Dr. Lowe’s clients saying about Lawrenceville?\n\n“I really enjoy the house system.” – Junior-student\n\n“My daughter transitioned from middle school to Lawrenceville. The Harkness method of teaching keeps classes small and interactive.” – Parent of a freshman\n\n“Dr. Lowe helped through the entire boarding school application process. My son was accepted Lawrenceville! He is now at Columbia.” – Parent of a graduate of Lawrenceville\n\nLawrenceville’s college matriculation rate to Ivy League and highly selective colleges and universities is high.

All the teachers we met were happy, enthusiastic and engaged. The school just bustles with multiculturalism and energy!\n\n“To be a student at Pingry is to live life fully, to experience it intensely, and to explore friendships and learning in ways that feel both uniquely independent and yet fully intertwined with the community.” – The Pingry School, Community Life.\n\nWhat are Dr. Lowe’s clients saying about Pingry?\n\n“Being on the Pingry Robotics was just an amazing experience!” – Pingry Upper School Junior\n\n“The teachers and leadership are highly dedicated to the scholastic and creative development of the children. Our daughter just loves Pingry.” – Parents of a first grader\n\n“We have two children at Pingry (Thank you, Dr. Lowe) — one in first grade and another in third grade — and we could not be more thankful for this very special place. This is more than a school — it is a family of students, teachers, staff and parents who truly care.” – Parent of Pingry students\n\nPingry’s college matriculation rate to Ivy League and highly selective colleges and universities is high. Here is a list of several colleges/universities attended: 2020-2023.\n\nHarvard (4)\n\nYale (7)\n\nUPenn (11)\n\nBrown (10)\n\nCornell (9)\n\nDarmouth (7)\n\nColumbia (12)\n\nStanford (5)\n\nNorthwestern (9)\n\nUniversity of Chicago (9)\n\nDuke (13)\n\nGeorgetown (15)\n\nColgate (12)\n\nFor Pingry’s Class of 2023, at least one student was accepted to each of the Ivy league schools!\n\nYear after year, Dr. Lowe works with clients are accepted to The Pingry School.\n\nDr. Paul Reginald Lowe is the managing director of Pinnacle Educational Center Admissions Advisors Group network.

By elite colleges, I am referring to colleges parents already know about: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, UPenn, Cornell, Dartmouth, Stanford, MIT, Duke, Johns Hopkins and BS/MD programs.\n\nTop 10 Private High Schools in New Jersey – 2024\n\nThe Lawrenceville School\n\nThe Pingry School\n\nDwight-Englewood School\n\nPrinceton Day School\n\nPeddie School\n\nThe Hun School\n\nRutgers Preparatory School\n\nDelbarton School\n\nKent Place School\n\nThe Montclair-Kimberly Academy\n\n“As an admissions expert, I am always cognizant of the unforeseen circumstances and unfavorable consequences that may adversely affect my clients’ positive outcomes.

Our firm is also experiencing an increase in inquiries regarding our private school and boarding school admissions advisory services. In a recent conference, Rhode Island Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green indicated that approximately 80 percent of Rhode Island students in grades three through eight were not proficient in math and only a third were reading at grade level the during pandemic-interrupted 2020-2021 school year, according to standardized test scores released Thursday by the state. It was reported that Infante-Green said Rhode Island joins most states around the country – including Massachusetts and Connecticut – in seeing proficiency rates fall during the pandemic.\n\nPrivate schools have seen a flurry of new interest from families who view private schools as being better equipped to provide robust instruction, given their financial resources, space and nimbleness in adapting. As a result of this interest, the competition for coveted spots have increased.\n\nEarlier this year, many students who applied to top boarding schools, including Exeter, Andover, St. Paul’s and Choate were place on waitlists and were eventually notified that could not gain entrance this past fall. In a letter to families, one boarding school stated in April, 2021: “At this time, it is clear that we will be unable to admit students from our waiting list in the near future as we anticipate being overenrolled….followed by another note in August 2021: “…we remain fully enrolled and as such, will be unable to offer admission to any students from our waiting list. I am sorry not to have better news for you and on behalf of all of my colleagues here in the admission office”.\n\nPaul Reginald Lowe is the managing director and lead admissions expert at Pinnacle Educational Center Admissions Advisors Group’s Boarding School Admissions Consultants, an affiliate of Private School Admissions Advisors.

They are independent schools which offer 9th grade and lower. Most junior boarding schools cover 6th grade through 9th grade. Many of our U.S. as well as international clients choose junior boarding schools.\n\nOur team, having visited many of these schools, including Rumsey Hall School and Cardigan Mountain, are aware of the benefits of U.S. junior boarding schools for both international and U.S. middle school-aged students. Junior boarding schools are global communities embracing international and diverse students and faculty. Most importantly, they offer an opportunity for international students to improve their English skills. They also help prepare students for school placement into top high school boarding schools through their secondary school placement departments.
