        "text": "The Muskegon (Michigan) district has unveiled its first new school building in over 60 years.\n\nWOOD-TV reports that the $35 million Charles Hackley Middle School will welcome students in grades six, seven and eight later this year.\n\n“It is tremendously exciting,\" said Superintendent Matthew Cortez. \"It’s hard to describe because we’re giving the students something they haven’t seen in 67 years.\"\n\nThe new facility will have capacity for more than 900 students and is replacing Muskegon Middle, which was built in the 1950s.\n\nThe building is outfitted with 45 classrooms, an 11,000-square-foot gymnasium, four private stalled restroom areas, a track and football field, and a science, technology, engineering, art and math (STEAM) lab.\n\nIt also has a number of enhanced safety or security features: a blue light system to inform students to seek shelter during an emergency, rooms with key card access and security cameras.\n\nFunding for the construction came from a $104 million bond approved by voters in 2020.\n\nThe school was built on the site of the former Mercy Hackley Hospital. The Mercy Health system donated 15 acres of land for construction.\n\nThe existing middle school will close down and be repurposed."
