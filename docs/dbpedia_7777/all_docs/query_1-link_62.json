        "text": "The primary goal of The Cathedral School’s high school counseling process is to help students and their families identify a secondary school where the student will continue to grow intellectually, experience new challenges, and pursue and discover new passions. To achieve this end, we work closely with students and their parents to ensure that their next school is the “right match.”\n\nThe high school counseling process parallels the personal and intellectual development that is so central to seventh and eighth grade. These years are both academically rigorous and personally dynamic. Students discover their strengths and their interests, and their journey of self-discovery helps them identify the most appropriate next step in their academic careers.\n\nThis process of self-discovery occurs while the student is also learning how to put his/her best foot forward in the application process. Our mission statement speaks of “confident, articulate students of the world.” The proof of this statement is exemplified by our eighth graders’ high school interviews and by their personal statements on their applications.\n\nBeginning in the spring of seventh grade and continuing through the fall and winter of eighth grade, I meet multiple times with each student and family to help define priorities in a high school program, decide on schools to which the child will apply, and guide the family through the application and selection process. Admissions directors across the country regularly tell me that our students are not just exceptionally well-prepared, they are also kind, compassionate, well-adjusted young men and women. Our graduates attend the most selective independent day and boarding, public, and parochial schools in the nation. See below for a full list of acceptances from the Class of 2024:\n\nOur students also go on to the world’s top colleges and universities:\n\nSpeak to any of our loyal alumni, and they will tell you that the foundation they received at Cathedral made all the difference."
