        "text": "Why is your local PGA professional a good teacher? Because he or she is also a good student. The PGA of America pros who give lessons at our local courses, driving ranges, and studios go to school, too—not to improve their golf, but to improve their ability to teach golf. Some 200 of them recently got together at the Met PGA Educational Forum to kick off the season with some serious studying.\n\nThe 53rd Annual edition of this event began with an intense session on biomechanics by Sasho MacKenzie, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Human Kinetics at St. Francis Xavier University. MacKenzie has conducted, presented, and published extensive research on putting, shaft dynamics, shoe fitting, and the role of center of pressure in the golf swing. His theme was how to use a scientific approach to analyze a player’s game and help them score better.\n\nAssociate Professor Sasho MacKenzie\n\nMacKenzie used putting as an example of how to apply his methods, and worked through two-dozen different factors that influence whether the ball goes in the hole. He followed a type of decision-tree approach (which space prohibits here) and reported that distance control is four times as important as the line of the putt. Also important: golfers who look at the hole instead of the ball when they stroke their putt (like Masters champion Jordan Spieth) get better results.\n\nChuck Cook, whose credentials include coaching three US Open champions (Payne Stewart, Tom Kite, and Corey Pavin), as well as Keegan Bradley, Jason Dufner, and Luke Donald, was also there. He explained teaching a proficient golf swing versus a picture-perfect one. In other words, how to teach what works, not what’s pretty (if you need any help, check out these 5 beautifully basic tips that can help improve your swing)\n\nThe Met PGA also used the occasion to honor recipients of three of its most prestigious awards.\n\nRodney Loesch, head pro of Connecticut Golf Club in Easton, received the 2014 Sam Snead Award, which is presented for contributions to golf, the PGA of America, and the Met PGA. Loesch has been active in growing the game in local schools, and was one of the founding board members of The First Tee Metropolitan NY. He’s served on the PGA of America board (two terms), plus several other national positions. He’s held every officer’s position in the Met Section, including president.\n\nGrant Sturgeon, assistant pro at Mamaroneck’s Winged Foot Golf Club, earned honors as the 2014 Player of the Year by compiling an outstanding competitive season. He won the Westchester PGA at Mount Kisco, then the Met Open at Trump Bedminster, the Met PGA Assistants’ Championship at Bethpage Red, and capped off his year with a victory in the National PGA Assistant Professional Championship in Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n\nDarrell Kestner, head pro of Deepdale Golf Club, won just about the only Met PGA title he hasn’t held: 2014 Professional of the Year. Kestner’s competitive wins includes three Met Open titles, five Met PGA championships, two MGA Senior Opens, and a Met PGA Senior title—among many, many more. He’s also known as one of the best teachers in the game, with students like Nick Watney, Nick Price, and Tom Kite, not to mention thousands of amateurs. Among his other accomplishments is mentoring professionals like Michael Breed.\n\nTired of music videos with artists pouring Cristal all over the place? Well, there was a time when that was a new way to market liquor. That was in 2002, when Yonkers’ Nick Storm was launching the premium vodka drink Hpnotiq with its creator Raphael Yakoby. Storm secured a placement for the beverage in a video by hip-hop artist Fabolous, and the blue liquor skyrocketed to the forefront of the urban liquor scene. A few years later, Sean Combs (who you may know as Puff, Puff Daddy, Puffy, or P. Diddy), recruited Storm to do the same thing for his vodka line, Ciroc. We caught up with Storm to find out how he managed such a feat and to get tips for those trying to emulate his success.\n\nYou originally started in the music business, right?\n\nI got my first internship with Sony Music in 1993. I got my big break after a year at Sony when I started working with Dave Hall, who produced Mariah Carey and Mary J. Bilge.\n\nAnd how did you cross over to the liquor business?\n\nIn 2000, I met [Raphael Yakoby] who said, ‘I know that you know a lot of artists…I’ve got a brand that I’d like to start promoting in the music space.’ Sony was having a party up in Bedford, at a big estate, and I ended up taking some of the cases of his blue liquor—Hpnotiq [then pronounced “hip-no-teek”]—and everybody in there was drinking it.\n\nI saw something. And I learned at a young age that if you really feel something in your gut, you have to take the chance and go for it. And I did it. I left Sony. For the first three months I couldn’t sell a bottle.\n\nWhen did Hpnotiq take off?\n\nOne day, Raphael and me were sitting at three o’clock in the morning trying to figure out ideas. And I said, ‘Maybe we could [pronounce] it ‘hypnotic?’ He was like ‘Try that name tomorrow.’ That day I ended up selling 17 bottles, and we changed [the pronunciation]. That was the golden moment. And in 2002, our biggest break came when I met Fabolous. We did a video placement with him for Hpnotiq.\n\nAt that time was it common practice to have liquor in music videos?\n\nNo, this was a whole new movement. That’s why a lot of people say that I changed the game. Now you see it all the time. When that video hit, we were getting calls from all over. Not only in New York, but in New Jersey to Delaware to DC, Hpnotiq blew up.\n\nWhy do they call you the “Million Case Man?”\n\nIn three years, from about 2001 to 2004, we took Hpnotiq from [selling] 1,000 cases to a million cases. That was the fastest-growing liquor in the spirits game. There are brands that have been out there for 10 years and wouldn’t hit a million cases.\n\nWhen did you start working with Puff on Cîroc?\n\nI got a call from his representative saying, ‘Puff is coming out with something. He wants to talk to you.’ The following week I show up to the office and [Puff] is like ‘Do you know what Cîroc is? I want you to come aboard on this.’ I ended up joining him in 2007. And from 2008 to 2011—ready for this—we sold a million cases of Cîroc.\n\nHow did you do it?\n\nA lot of my programs that I did with Hpnotiq, we transferred them right over to Cîroc. And we were able to pump some steroids into it because I had the No. 1 guy [Puff]. The other thing was Puff’s whole movement of ‘the party,’ and we sold the lifestyle along with it.\n\nSo what is your main marketing strategy to get your message across?\n\nSocial media. Everything is Instagram or Facebook. I also run an ambassador program. A brand ambassador is someone who lives the lifestyle in their market. If Big Sean is going to a party in Miami, I want to know about it, and we want the person who represents the brand there with him.\n\nWhat’s your advice for people starting out in the sales game?\n\nBelieve in yourself and believe in the brand. When you get people to believe in you, you can sell anything."
