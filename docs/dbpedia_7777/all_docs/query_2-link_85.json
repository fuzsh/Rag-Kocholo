        "text": "MUSKEGON, MI -- Dozens of residents gathered Wednesday to watch a 155-year-old Italianate mansion be wheeled through the streets of downtown Muskegon.\n\nThe mansion, known as the Nelson House, was first a private residence and later served as the rectory for the long-vacant St. Jean Baptiste Catholic Church. Purchased by Muskegon Public Schools, it was set to be demolished before the city of Muskegon expressed interest. City leaders just purchased it in June for a nominal fee of $100. The cost of the move and setting a new foundation is near $230,000.\n\nThe house was moved from its location at 1292 Jefferson St. to a vacant, city-owned lot at 382 W. Muskegon Avenue by Deitz House Moving Engineers of Fruitport.\n\n“As I look at this I think, ‘Wow, I can really see how this used to be a beautiful mansion,’” said resident Dave Duggan, who was taking pictures as the house rolled through the corner of Third Street and Webster Avenue.\n\nThe mansion was built in 1869 at what is now Hackley Park by Charles D. Nelson. It features a curved main staircase and intricately carved wood reliefs and wood paneled doors.\n\nNelson was in the lumber business and served the community in many ways: he was the first register of deeds for the county, supervisor of the Village of Muskegon from 1862-67, a city alderman for four terms and president of the board of education. He later served as a state senator, and the former Nelson School was named after him in 1926.\n\nThe house was first moved in 1891 from Hackley Park to the Jefferson address, said Jamie Pesch, city planner for Muskegon.\n\n“From what I understand, it was by a team of horses and it rolled on logs,” Pesch said.\n\nThe modern move on Wednesday saw workers attending to all sides of the house as it slowly creeped around the corner and down the street, tires pressing down from the weight.\n\nAt times, movers were completely underneath the home making adjustments, while others used machines to move large pieces of broken wood from the foundation.\n\nConsumers Energy and other energy and cable companies were on site moving cables so the building could pass through.\n\nAccording to the city, the Nelson mansion, now in the Houston Historic District, will be listed for sale in as-is condition to be renovated by a future private owner.\n\nDuggan said he hopes the home will be preserved and open for tours by the public, similar to Muskegon’s Hackley and Hume homes.\n\n“I hope it doesn’t just become a private residence where people can’t go in,” Duggan said. “This is another example of the history from back in the day when this was a booming lumber town.”\n\nPesch said while the city will require the private owner to make certain rehabilitative changes, because it will be “privately owned it wouldn’t be a publicly accessible structure unless the future owner wanted it to be that.”\n\nThe city planner requested any residents that have photos of the home to send them to his office to assist the future owner in proper preservation.\n\n“Anything that can help a future owner piece together how the house might have been laid out, whatever it might be, it’s always helpful to have ... to make sure they’re doing things historically appropriate for the house and giving them an idea of the changes that have occurred over time,” Pesch said."
