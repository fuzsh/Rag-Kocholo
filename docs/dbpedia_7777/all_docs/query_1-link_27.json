        "text": "Our founders believed that meeting different kinds of people creates more opportunities for understanding, inspiration, and wisdom. In that spirit, we seek students who will learn as much from one another’s families as they learn in class.\n\nAt Hackley, the need threshold begins with the first dollar of tuition that stretches a family’s finances beyond manageability; this means we provide tuition support across a wide spectrum of incomes. In 2024-2025, the median annual household income for financial aid recipients is $196,000 (please note that we assess need not just from income, but also from assets, household size, and other factors).\n\nInterested families must submit a financial aid application through Clarity no later than December 15, 2024. The application will ask for information about your household’s income, assets, and expenses. This information will be supported by tax documents, such as the 1040 and W2 and/or 1099.\n\nClarity allows families to apply to multiple independent schools for financial aid. Please note that Clarity assesses a $60 fee for a family with any number of children submitting information to any number of schools using the platform. Clarity will automatically waive the application fee for families with qualifying income.\n\nNeed-based financial aid is granted at the school’s discretion and takes into account each family’s unique financial situation as demonstrated through the Clarity application. The Financial Aid Committee will only review the file and finalize awards after the financial aid application, including all required documents, is completed and submitted. Financial aid grants are for one year. Families must submit current financial data each year to be considered for a renewal of their financial aid.
