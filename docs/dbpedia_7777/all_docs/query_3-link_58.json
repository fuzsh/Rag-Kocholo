        "text": "How Harmful are Cell Phones to Students? I have two children, who were born 12 years apart. My oldest son graduated from high school in 2009, right around the time the iPhone starting became popular. My youngest daughter was born in 2003, and she started begging for an iPhone in 6th grade. She was horrified when I bought her a flip phone, and by the time she entered 8th grade we gave in an bought her an iPhone, so that she could easily text her friends. Sometimes I think the worst thing I ever did as a parent was to buy my teenage daughter a smart phone. My son commented that if he had a smart phone in high school he does not think he would have made it through school. I have started reading \"The Anxious Generation\", by Jonathan Haidt, it is is eye opening, disturbing, and sad to read about the impact cell phones and social media have had on the mental and physical health of children. I came across the following article in \"The New York Times\" recently, about efforts across the country to ban cell phones in schools, and I hope these efforts are successful. Cell phones have altered the way children experience childhood, and it has negatively impacted their growth, development, and education. As a society we need to reexamine how our children use these devices, and for how many hours a day it is healthy for them to access them. As an educator for over 22 years, I have seen 3 generations (Millennials, Gen Z, and now Gen Alpha) growing, developing, and learning, and I see every day the lack of skills many students display in critical areas such as grammar, spelling, math facts, the ability to have a conversation with an adult, the ability to focus, and the ability to digest and analyze complex material. It is frightening what the future holds for some of these children. https://lnkd.in/eChF2934\n\nNearly 100,000 applicants, and less than a 7% acceptance rate - How Northeastern University became Elite! In the 1970s my uncle wanted to earn a teaching degree. Our family was not affluent, my grandparents did not own a home, or even a car. They were immigrants, with 4 children (including twins), living in a rented apartment in Cambridge. My grandfather was a chemical engineer, who worked at Polaroid his entire career, and he walked to and from work from his Central Square home. My grandmother was a homemaker. My uncle needed to work and go to school while he lived at home, so Northeastern was the perfect fit for him. He earned a teaching degree, and ended up running the housing department at NEU in the 1980s. Fast forward to 2014, and my son meets a young lady attending NEU from Russia. NEU has a HUGE (full pay and then some) international population. My daughter-in-law graduated from NEU 8 years ago, and she is from a very wealthy family in Russia. Her family paid over $500,000 for her 6-year NEU education (one year of English immersion, and 5 years in the business school, a co-op job at Amazon in Seattle, and a job offer back in Boston to work for Amazon). At her graduation at the Garden (the nursing, engineering, and business schools' graduation), international students were encouraged to bring the flags from their country of origin, and it looked like the United Nations on the floor of the Garden that day! The university received 98,373 applications for fall 2024, up from 96,631 in 2023, 91,000 in 2022, 75,244 in 2021 and 64,459 in 2020. That’s an increase of 33,914 applicants, or 53%, over five years. The incoming class will include about 2,600 students in Boston, as well as 475 at NEU's undergraduate campus in Oakland, California, and another 300 at the university’s undergraduate campus in London. NEU is a school in HUGE demand, and we routinely place students there, from all over the world! If NEU is on your junior's college list, reach out to us and see how we can help.\n\nAbsolutely disgusting behavior in a public school! I am still catching up on my summer reading on education issues impacting students, teachers and families, and I came across this article last month in \"The New York Times\". This disgusting behavior was perpetrated by students in a public school in PA. These poor teachers were harassed and targeted by their students, in the most vile ways possible. Seventh and eighth graders in Malvern, Pa., impersonating their teachers posted disparaging, lewd, racist and homophobic videos in the first known mass attack of its kind in the U.S. The sad thing is that the school could do very little to punish the students who engaged in this behavior. “We didn’t have to deal with teacher-targeting at this scale before,” said Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, the largest U.S. teachers’ union. “It’s not only demoralizing. It could push educators to question, ‘Why would I continue in this profession if students are doing this?’” “Move on. Learn to joke,” the other student said about a teacher. “I am 13 years old,” she added, using an expletive for emphasis, “and you’re like 40 going on 50.” “While we wish we could do more to hold students accountable, we are legally limited in what action we can take when students communicate off campus during nonschool hours on personal devices,” Daniel Goffredo, the district’s superintendent, said in a statement. If this kind of behavior occurred in the vast majority of private schools in the US, these children would be expelled! Many parents contact me to help them get out of public schools where bullying, harassment, and bad behavior occur daily, and nothing can be done to stop it. Parents want their children to learn in an environment that is respectful, safe, and free from these kinds of behaviors. https://lnkd.in/e5-NvTFu\n\nWhy Public Schools are Struggling in Massachusetts... I am catching up on some of my reading on education issues on a rainy Monday morning, and I came across this article by one of my favorite \"Boston Globe\" education writers - Jamie Vaznis. I have had many conversation with Jamie over the years about public education and the Boston exam schools, and he has always had a thoughtful perspective on the issues, even if we do not always agree. Jamie wrote an article in \"The Boston Globe\" earlier this month about why public schools in Massachusetts are struggling to pay for essential school services. The extra money allocated by the federal government to help public schools recover from Covid learning loss is rapidly nearing an end, and many public school students are still way behind, due to protracted periods of on-line learning during Covid. These students will fall even further behind, we see this every day in working with public school students (even those coming from the \"best\" public schools in MA). This is why we get so many calls, every week from frustrated parents in Newton, Weston, Wellesley, Needham, Dover, Acton, Lexington, etc., who want better than what the local public school can provide. It is sad reality that public schools in America, and in the \"best\" public school systems in Massachusetts are struggling to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse population. Advanced students are not being challenged, and special needs students and English Language Learners are not getting the help they need. Just another reason why private school applications are at an astronomical high in the Boston area, and in many parts of the country! https://lnkd.in/efDtH4Sw\n\nThe \"New\" Trick Families are Using to Lower College Tuition Bills is not so new! Jeffrey Selingo wrote a great article in \"New York Magazine\" about how merit aid increasingly favors middle and upper middle class families in America. We have seen this trend increasing over the last 20 years, in our work with students and families applying to college. Our students routinely are offered merit scholarships ranging from $25,000 to $35,000 a year off the full tuition price. My son was offered a $20,000 annual tuition discount at his intended school back in 2009, and he had a \"B\" GPA. The key was that he had very high SAT scores! High SAT scores (and yes, scores do matter again) = BIG merit scholarships at many schools, not every school, but many high quality, in demand schools. Our average SAT student sees a 200 point increase in their SAT scores, when following our program and process. Investing in SAT prep can reap huge financial rewards over the 4 years a student will be attending college. College admissions in America today is a very complicated process, and knowing how to effectively navigate this process is critical to having a good outcome (both in terms of finding a school that is a good fit for your child, and having them earn lucrative merit scholarships). Our work with the junior class of 2024/2025 is starting now for SAT prep and college admissions consulting. Spots are filling up quickly! https://lnkd.in/ejuAfydt\n\nDoes the College Make the Student? In my role as a college admissions consultant I do a lot of research and reading about higher education, to stay abreast of the ever changing landscape in college admissions, and last week I came across a great article in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" (see link below). https://lnkd.in/eaEycBgG Prashant Sehgal is a dad of a current college student and a rising high school junior. He moderates college admissions forums on Reddit and spend hours every day answering questions about the process. He is an independent film maker, and he has no interest in starting a college admissions consulting business. He is just an ordinary dad who is filling a huge need in helping parents and students navigate the complex and constantly evolving college admissions process in the United States (and he lives in India)! The following quote has stayed with me since I read the article, and it is an issue I discuss often with parents and students. “No school or its prestige is worth 300K unless your family has that kind of pocket change just lying around. It’s your work and your effort that makes you successful, not your college name,” he wrote in a reply to one recent forum user choosing between an in-state spot at the University of Iowa and the University of California at Los Angeles. In reply to a forum user who was disheartened by friends who called their chosen college “a ‘ivy reject’ school,” Sehgal wrote: “Your friends are idiots, so ignore them.” Mr. Seghal is 1000% correct! I just wish that I could create a poster with his words, and require all my clients to hang it in a prominent place in their home as they go through this process. Success is college is about what you put into the experience, not what name is on your diploma. I know Ivy League graduates who are living in their parents' basement and are unemployed. I know community college graduates who have started successful (and lucrative) businesses. We need to stop sending our children the message that if you do not go to a \"brand name\" college you are a failure! It is simply not true! I LOVE working with high school students and their families, helping them navigate this process, and finding a school where they will thrive, grow, and discover what they are passionate about. Life is too short to spend years trying to please someone else and being miserable in the process. Help your child to find their niche, and support them in navigating this process, while keeping your (and their) sanity intact! Don't let the \"brand names\" get in the way of a successful college search!\n\nCould you write 36 high quality essays in 90 days, while going to school full time, maintaining a high GPA, and juggling a busy scheduling of playing a JV sport and participating in clubs and volunteer activities? I bet the answer (if you are being honest) would be no. Then why would you expect your high school senior to be able to do this? Last season we worked with a high achieving student who was applying to 12 colleges. Her list was well balanced between reach, target and likely schools. She of course had to write her 650 word Common App essay, but she also had to write an average of 3 supplemental essays per school - 3 x 12 = 36. Most of these essays had word limits - some were 600 words - as large as another Common App essay, and some were as short as 150 words. It can often take more time to write a well-crafted, impactful 150 word essay than a 600 word essay, because you have so few words in which to get across your point. We know that in the absence of race based admissions, and with some schools still test optional (although that is rapidly changing), many schools have added more supplemental essays to gain a better understanding of who is applying. The Common App \"resets\" in early August, and supplemental essay topics change from year-to-year, so the earliest you can start working on these essays is in early August. Schools with early action (EA) and early decision (ED) options typically have November 1st deadlines. Many students apply EA and ED to increase their chances of admission. An increasing number of colleges are admitting a larger chunk of their freshman class through EA and ED admissions. So if you are a student who want to gain admission to a competitive school under ED or EA, and you have a balanced list of about a dozen schools, you will likely have to write somewhere in the neighborhood of 36 high quality essays in 90 days, while keeping up with everything else in your demanding schedule. We work with students to make this process MUCH less stressful, and we help them produce high quality, relevant, and impactful essays that get the attention of admissions officers as top colleges. Our high achieving student was admitted to the Dyson School of Business at Cornell in December, and she is thrilled. Cornell had a 2% acceptance rate for the business school last year. Good essays make a difference in college admissions - don't let this critical part of the process slip through the cracks!\n\nAnother reason why private school admissions are increasing at an astronomical rate in the Boston area! \"The Boston Globe\" had a very insightful article this week about the lack of talented and gifted programs in Massachusetts schools. It is astounding that a state that has the \"best\" public education system in America is so lacking in this area. While 60% of public schools systems in America offer these programs, only 4% of Massachusetts schools have a talented and gifted program. We hear from families every week with children who are bored in school and not challenged. These families are looking for private schools that will allow their children to develop to their fullest potential. The options are even more limited in Boston. As the article mentions, Boston Public Schools used to offer an Advanced Work Program that was very solid and challenged students in grades 4, 5 and 6. The AWC program was a feeder to the Boston Exam Schools, and AWC students were very well prepared for challenging work in middle and high school. BPS decided to eliminate this program several years ago, and it has lead to a steady decline in enrollment and quality in the system. An effort to provide equity has resulted in mediocrity for all. In conjunction with doing away with the AWC program, BPS watered down the criteria for admission to the Boston Exam Schools, and the results are starting to show. MCAS scores are dropping at the exam schools, and many families in Boston no longer see the exam schools as a quality option for their children. Many public school districts in Massachusetts are eliminating algebra I in 8th grade, because not enough minority students are enrolled in these classes. If students cannot master algebra I in middle school then lucrative careers in science, engineering, and computer science will be closed to them, as many competitive colleges require students to have completed calculus by the time they graduate. If a student takes algebra I in 9th grade, algebra II in 10th grade, geometry in 11th grade and precalculus in 12th grade, then they will not have the opportunity to complete a calculus course in high school. The answer to lifting up disadvantaged students is not to water down the curriculum so that no one excels! https://lnkd.in/evNpbVWU\n\nCongratulations to our students! This was by far the most competitive private middle/high school admissions season we have seen in the over 20 years we have worked in this business. Applicant pools were huge at every school, and wait lists were very long. We just wrapped up a very successful season with our 2023 applicants. Our students have been accepted to an impressive list of schools including: BB&N, BC High, Beaver Country Day, Boston Trinity Academy, Brimmer & May, BU Academy, Commonwealth, Dana Hall, Dexter, Fessenden, Fontbonne, Hackley School (New York), International School of Boston, Milton Academy, Montrose, Newman, Newton Country Day, Park School, Rivers, Roxbury Latin, St. Sebastian's, Thayer, Ursuline, and Xaverian Brothers We will be starting admissions consulting next month with our 2024 students, and we have a few opening remaining on our schedule. Our client testimonials illustrate what a big difference this work makes in the final outcome (see link below). https://lnkd.in/ewncFe7t It is such a pleasure and privilege to work with students and families to help them find a great fit for their child's next school. This work is deeply personal and very rewarding! #privateschool #privateschools #admissionconsulting"
