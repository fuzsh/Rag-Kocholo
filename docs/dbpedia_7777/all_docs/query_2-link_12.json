        "text": "The 550-seat auditorium and 100-seat black box theater will spotlight Hackleyâ€™s student actors, artists, musicians and technicians, and serve as a shared space across disciplines. Instructional spaces, rehearsal and practice rooms, scene shops, dressing rooms and control rooms will foster creativity in its many forms and elevate the visual and performing arts at Hackley. The Makerspace, studios and flexible computer science classrooms will create a learning environment for superior computer science instruction across disciplines.\n\nConstruction of the Center for the Creative Arts and Technology is being funded thanks to the generosity of the Hackley community through the Beyond Boundaries Campaign. For more information, please contact John Gannon, Director of Advancement, at (914) 366-2654 or jgannon@hackleyschool.org."
