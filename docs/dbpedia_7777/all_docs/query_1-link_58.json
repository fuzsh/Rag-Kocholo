        "text": "Round Square I-D-E-A-L-S\n\nThe IDEALS on which Round Square is based represent the theories of experiential educational philosopher Kurt Hahn, who believed that schools should have a greater purpose beyond preparing young people for college and university.\n\nDr. Hahn, who was also the founder of Outward Bound and of United World Colleges, believed that it was crucial for students to prepare for life by having them face it head on and experience it in ways that would demand courage, generosity, imagination, principle and resolution. As a result, he felt that young people would become empowered and develop the skills and abilities to be the leaders and guardians of tomorrow's world.\n\nDr. Hahn believed that \"There is more in you than you know.\" Students at Round Square schools make a commitment to addressing each of the six IDEALS through intellectual and cultural exchanges, service projects, and adventure activities.\n\nRound Square's overarching goal is to ensure the full and individual development of every student as a whole person through the simultaneous realization of academic, physical, cultural and spiritual aspirations."
