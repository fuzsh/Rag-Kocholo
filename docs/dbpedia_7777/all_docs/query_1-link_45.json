        "text": "Talent Citizen is delighted to announce that John Halpin will join Hackley School as Major Gift Officer effective January 31, 2022. In this role, John will play a critical part in the success of Hackley’s comprehensive campaign and will advance a culture of philanthropy that matches the strengths, authenticity, and generosity of the Hackley community itself. Working in partnership with Director of Advancement Teresa Weber and all members of the Advancement team, John will be responsible for building meaningful relationships across Hackley’s donor base, creating opportunities to marry the philanthropic interests of donors with the School’s institutional priorities.\n\nJohn previously served as the inaugural Associate Director of Development, the lead fundraising role, at The City, an independent nonprofit news organization serving New York City with a mission to address the growing deficit in civic information and accountability created by a shrinking local news landscape. Prior, John held fundraising positions at Columbia University’s Earth Institute and Mailman School of Public Health. John raised major gifts from individuals, corporations, and foundations while increasing the size of each School’s donor base through new prospect identification and engagement. At Mailman, John also oversaw stewardship and donor communications programs. John also previously served as a Senior Development Officer at Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, where he increased funds raised by all measures, maintaining and growing the organization’s strong relationships with long-term members of a tight-knit community.\n\nWith ten years of experience as a fundraiser, John brings deep commitment to building strong relationships founded on genuine trust and caring in service of advancing educational and equity-focused missions. John earned a Bachelor of Science in Social Work from Xavier University, a Master of Science in Traditional Oriental Medicine from Pacific College of Health and Science, and a Master of Public Administration from Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs.\n\nTalent Citizen President Tracy Welsh led this search with Senior Associate Rachel K. Partin.\n\nABOUT HACKLEY SCHOOL\n\nFounded on the values of intellectual questioning and inclusiveness, Hackley School is a private coeducational K-12 day school that re-imagines the traditional liberal arts education with a broader curriculum of competencies and experiences to meet the needs of tomorrow’s citizens. Hackley seeks to create a community that empowers students to rise to complex challenges and anticipate the needs of a constantly changing modern era, focused on inter-connectedness and shared accomplishment."
