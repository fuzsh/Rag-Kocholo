Another option is Snack Bar (the same building as Menza) - the meals cost about 3 euros and they are more or less the same every day (about 6 or seven options). There are also other canteens and buffets in the grounds of the school - you just have to try them all and get to know which one fits you. To eat in all of these, you need to have a student card of VSB and you have to charge it. You cannot pay cash. Therefore, if you arrive before the OD, you must be patient and try eating at other places because you cannot get your student card before the OD.
