The University has made significant qualitative progress in recent years. It has changed from a predominantly mining engineering university to a modern polytechnic university. VSB-TUO, as a research university, is focused on excellence in R&D and development of new technologies and aims to focus on high-quality internationally recognised technical and economic education, concentrating primarily on the industrial sector.\n\nInternationalisation is a complex horizontal activity that spans all areas of the University. It includes student and academic mobility, international cooperation, strategic partnerships as well as multicultural teaching, the international dimension of study programmes at the University, the presence of visiting professors and international students, and the support of international research teams.\n\nResearch and development are integral to the activities of VSB-TUO. There are a number of research centres at VSB-TUO that are engaged not only in the implementation of R&D activities in the field of basic and applied research, but also with the subsequent commercialisation of their results. The University’s science and research strategy is based on four fundamental pillars: energy and raw materials, computer science and cyber physical systems, engineering and technology, and economic and financial processes. There are two major research institutes at VSB-TUO, IT4Innovations National Supercomputing Center (IT4Innovations) and Centre for Energy and Environmental Technologies (CEET), that are engaged not only in the implementation of R&D activities in the field of basic and applied research, but also with the subsequent commercialisation of their results.\n\nVSB-TUO has one of the largest campuses in Central Europe. The main campus of VSB-TUO is situated in the very pleasant surroundings of Ostrava-Poruba which is linked by excellent public transport to other parts of Ostrava. It is being developed into a technologically advanced campus with a 5G network connecting key infrastructure, including our supercomputer centre, a smart factory, our e-health system, a centre for additive manufacturing with 3D printers, as well as a vast sensor network, covering almost 40ha, to create a Live Industry 4.0 Laboratory.\n\nOstrava is Czech Republic’s third largest city, a centre of industry and a university town in which students comprise approximately 14% of the population. It is a vibrant student city full of cultural and entertainment options. Ostrava is in an excellent location with superb public transport links meaning you can walk out of your door and travel to five European capitals within 4 hours for less than €20. Ostrava is also home to the Colours of Ostrava and Beats for Love music festivals, which host artists from around the world every summer.\n\nVSB-Technical University of Ostrava (VSB-TUO) is a public-funded university located in the north-eastern part of the Czech Republic and it is one of the pillars of technical and economic education, not only in the region but also in the whole country.
