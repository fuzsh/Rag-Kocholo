        "text": "After a six-year hiatus, the Academic European Table Tennis Championship is making its return to Olomouc. In 2017, the Academic European University Championship was held at the sports hall of Palacký University, but this year, the tournament will take place at Olomouc's Omega Centre for Sport and Health from July 3rd to July 10th.\n\nTable tennis players who are university students from all corners of Europe will once again gather in Olomouc. The participant list comprises eighteen men's teams and eleven women's teams from thirteen European countries. This year, the largest foreign teams will be from Great Britain and Germany, and we can also expect the presence of traditionally strong universities from Poland, where university sports, particularly table tennis, are highly popular. For instance, the Wrocław University of Economics will be represented by two renowned Polish players, sisters Anna and Katarzyna WEGRZIN. The British universities also boast some intriguing names on their rosters, such as WANG Jinghao, ZHAO Jiameng, and YU Tianyi, who are young Chinese table tennis players studying in Bristol and London, England.\n\nThe Czechia will be represented by table tennis players from two universities in Ostrava. Among them, Zdena BLAŠKOVÁ, who participated in the World Championships in Durban, South Africa, in May, will compete alongside defender Markéta ŠEVČÍKOVÁ and Jana VAŠENDOVÁ, all donning their uniforms.\n\nThe Academic European Table Tennis Championship is celebrating its 10th edition. After the inaugural tournament hosted by Ostrava in 2008, the battle for university medals in table tennis took place in Olomouc in 2017. This year, the academic championship returns to the Haná region. The Omega Centre for Sport and Health, where the ITTF World Series Table Tennis Tournament - Czechia Open - is held annually, will serve as the venue for this year's tournament.\n\nThe 10th AME in Olomouc will feature a total of six competitive disciplines. The first three days of the tournament will be dedicated to team competitions, while Saturday and Sunday will showcase individual competitions, including men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles. Once again, Vít Ratajský, chairman of the table tennis committee of the Czechia Association of University Sports (CAUS), will lead the organizing committee of the \"Olomouc\" Academic European Championships.\n\nFramework programme of the AME 2023 competitions in Olomouc\n\nWednesday 5 July at 9:30 am:\n\nOpening ceremony, opening of the team competitions\n\nThursday 6 July\n\nTeam competitions (continued)\n\nFriday 7 July\n\nTeam competitions (conclusion)\n\nSaturday 8 July\n\nindividual competitions\n\nSunday 9 July\n\nIndividual competitions (conclusion)\n\nclosing ceremony\n\nFor complete information about the 10th Academic European Table Tennis Championships in Olomouc, visit: https://tabletennis2023.eusa.eu/\n\nHere is an overview of the hosting countries for the AME in table tennis:\n\n2007 - Ostrava\n\n2008 - Latina (Italy)\n\n2009 - Niš (Serbia)\n\n2010 - Kazan (Russia)\n\n2011 - Madeira (Portugal)\n\n2013 - Zonguldak (Türkiye)\n\n2015 - Geneva (Switzerland)\n\n2017 - Olomouc\n\n2019 - Camerino (Italy)\n\n2023 – Olomouc"
