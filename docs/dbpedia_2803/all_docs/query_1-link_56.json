        "text": "Within the Mathematics study program, we aim at preparing you for the career of a scientist or an expert in many different spheres such as industry, banking or insurance services. Our basic goal is to provide you with the mathematical knowledge and deepen it. Also, our objective also is to develop your skills of independent logical thinking, abstracting and mathematizing real issues, solving the issues using mathematical methods and computer technology, and finally interpreting the results correctly. Having finished your studies, you will be ready to work independently as well as in a team and you will be capable of extending and completing your knowledge and skills.\n\nWhy study mathematics at the University of Ostrava?\n\nThe University of Ostrava is one of few Czech universities that offer the study of professional mathematics. Our Department of Mathematics cooperates with the Department of Informatics and Computers. Therefore, the study is unique as you can obtain an education in the field of both mathematics and partially informatics as well. At our department, you will be surrounded by a friendly, working and open atmosphere. During your studies, you will have the possibility to become a member of a research group. The department carries out science and research activities in the sphere of number theory, algebra, geometry, and mathematical physics. It also participates in the preparation of various scientific conferences (http://ntc.osu.cz/) and international competitions (http://vjimc.osu.cz/). If you participate, you will get a chance to gain further valuable experience. At the department, you will have access to a modern university library with more than 250,000 books.\n\nWhy is mathematics in Ostrava so specific/attractive? What distinguishes mathematics in Ostrava from other programs?\n\nThe University of Ostrava is a young university founded in 1991. As a modern university, we emphasize an individual approach to students. We have developed an excellent system of the study at partner foreign universities including internships. Education in mathematics in combination with computer science ensures high employment potential at the labor market. You, as our graduate, will be able to find a job in various companies and institutions as a specialist in analyses, modeling and problem solving using mathematical methods. Most frequent positions for you as a graduate student of the Bachelor's degree will be a data processing expert, a risk analyst, a market research analyst or a statistician in different sectors.\n\nYou can choose from two specializations – Mathematics and Fuzzy Mathematics. Within the common core of both of them, you will acquire advanced knowledge of mathematical analysis (functional and complex analysis, measure and integral), geometry and topology. You will learn to solve complex mathematical problems proposing an appropriate mathematical model, interpret obtained results and present them adequately.\n\nWithin the Mathematics specialization, you will further extend and deepen your knowledge of modern mathematical disciplines and links between them, as well as applications that will move you forward in understanding than the real world.\n\nWithin the Fuzzy Mathematics specialization, you will acquire deeper knowledge and a current overview of the development of common mathematical areas. Special attention will be paid to mathematical structures, models and methods that will enable you to work with various types of uncertainties.\n\nWithin both specializations, you will further shape your profile in different professional seminars in which you will deepen your knowledge in selected mathematical and application areas or obtain elementary training for scientific work.\n\nWhat sort of jobs will mathematics be relevant?\n\nThe skills you will acquire comprise independent logical thinking, abstracting and mathematizing real issues, solving the issues using mathematical methods as well as computer technology and interpreting the results correctly. Moreover, the skills will comprise working autonomously and/or in a team, extending and developing obtained knowledge and skills, and presenting them, and communicating in English. Such skills will further predetermine you - if you are a graduate of the follow-up Master´s degree in Mathematics - to work as an independent professional specialist (or a team/working group leader) on analysis, modeling and problem solving using mathematical methods. Graduates can most frequently achieve positions like a data processing specialist, senior analyst in various areas or a member of research teams working on data processing and evaluation.\n\nWhere can my degree take me? Career prospects\n\nWhile studying mathematics, you will develop your skills in logical thinking and creativity and get an insight into techniques that will enable you to understand, analyze and solve specific challenges. The internal elegance and beauty of mathematics will hardly cease to fascinate you. The logical and analytical skills developed through a degree in mathematics are highly valued by employers. Our graduates go on to work in careers in industry, government and education, as well as in business, law, accountancy, banking, and computing. Our Ph.D. programs further prepare students for research careers. Mathematics is a very flexible subject: studying mathematics doesn't necessarily mean that you have to become a mathematician, but it will provide you with valuable attributes that you can make use of in other employment. Graduates in mathematics are particularly adaptable when changing jobs and are able to be most useful in many different branches of science and technology.\n\nOur graduates have gone on to work for organizations including:\n\nU&Sluno, Science and Technology Center Ostrava, Česká pojišťovna, Innogy, Tieto, OSIsoft"
