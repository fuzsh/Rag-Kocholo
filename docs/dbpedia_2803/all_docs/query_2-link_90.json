        "text": "Ostrava, city, northeastern Czech Republic. It lies between the Ostravice and Oder rivers above their confluence at the southern edge of the Upper Silesian coalfield. It was founded about 1267 as a fortified town by Bruno, bishop of Olomouc, to protect the entry to Moravia from the north. Its castle was demolished in 1495. Historic buildings include the 13th-century St. Wenceslas’ Church and the Old Town Hall tower (1687). There are several theatres, including a fine opera house; a philharmonic orchestra; and an art gallery.\n\nOstrava is surrounded by a rich black-coal basin that has made it a centre of heavy industry, with a long tradition dating from 1830, when the first blast furnace was built at the Vítkovice ironworks. Some of the coal pits extend into the city limits, and their derricks are common features of the skyline.\n\nThe conurbation of Greater Ostrava receives a steady influx of workers, and many housing estates and new towns, such as Poruba and Havířov, have been built there. Most planned development is east of the Ostravice River, in Slezská (“Silesian”) Ostrava. Settlements west of the Ostravice are in Moravská (“Moravian”) Ostrava."
