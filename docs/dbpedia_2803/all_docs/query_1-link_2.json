        "text": "Public university in the Czech Republic\n\nThe University of Ostrava (Czech Ostravská univerzita) is a public university in the city of Ostrava, Moravian-Silesian Region, Czech Republic. Founded in 1991, it is the newest public university in Ostrava. It consists of six faculties and two institutes providing university education.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Ostrava was founded on 28 September 1991. Its origins can be traced back to 1953, when a training college for future primary school teachers was opened in the nearby town of Opava. In 1959, all teacher training within the region was streamlined into a single institution – the newly established Pedagogical Institute in Ostrava. Five years later, the institute was awarded university status and became an independent Faculty of Education, offering four-year degree courses to future primary school teachers. The range of degrees was later extended to include a five-year programme for future teachers of higher year groups.[2] Gradually, other faculties, departments and research centres joined the University of Ostrava, shifting the focus from teachers to research and innovation in general.\n\nFaculty of Medicine\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Faculty of Medicine was established in 2010. Its history is closely connected with the Medical-Social Faculty of the University of Ostrava, which was founded in 1993. In 2008 the Medical-Social Faculty was divided into two faculties: the Faculty of Social Studies and the Faculty of Health Studies. The Faculty of Health Studies was renamed as the Medical Faculty on 1 September 2010.[3][4]\n\nRectors\n\n[edit]\n\nrector's name term of office appointed by prof. PhDr. Jaroslav Hubáček, CSc. 1991–1995 Václav Havel[5] prof. RNDr. Jiří Močkoř, DrSc. 1995–2001 Václav Havel[5] doc. Ing. Petr Pánek, CSc. 2001–2004 Václav Havel[5] doc.

MUDr. Jan Lata, CSc. 2015 – till now Miloš Zeman\n\nRankings\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2017, Times Higher Education ranked the university in the 801-1000 band globally.[7]"
