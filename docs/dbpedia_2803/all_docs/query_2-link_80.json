        "text": "About the research institute\n\nERUNI Open Research is a workplace of the European Research University that focuses on excellence in research. Organizationally, it makes part of the Faculty of Doctoral Studies of the European Research University. This workplace is located in the Czech Republic, in the very center of the European Union, namely in Prague and Ostrava. Thematically, we focus on economics, economic policy, public administration, management, taxes, law, the social field, but also mathematics, informatics, pedagogy and other fields.\n\nERUNI Open Research Prague is located in beautiful historical premises in the center of Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. It is home to approximately 1.3 million inhabitants of many nationalities. It is accessible from all over the world via Václav Havel Prague International Airport. The ERUNI Open Research Prague building was designed by the famous architect Jan Kotěra. It is excellently accessible by metro and all other modes of transport, and in its immediate vicinity there is also the very famous Wenceslas Square or Charles Bridge. The lucrative location of the Prague research institute of our university offers not only high-quality conditions for research activities, but also a rich social and cultural life. Prague is among the ten best places in the world in terms of conditions for academic and research activities and is also the fifth most visited city in Europe. Communication at the ERUNI Open Research Prague research institute takes place in English.\n\nIn addition to Prague, the research institute of our university also operates in Ostrava. ERUNI Open Research Ostrava is located in Ostrava, Havířov and Hnojník. Ostrava is the third largest city in the Czech Republic and the wider agglomeration of the statutory city of Ostrava and nearby cities has around half a million inhabitants. The entire adjacent Moravian-Silesian Region has 1.2 million inhabitants. Nearby is the beautiful Beskydy mountain range, located on the border of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Beskydy Mountains, together with several important recreational water reservoirs, offer the possibility of many summer and winter activities. The institute is accessible via the international airport in Ostrava-Mošnov or the international airport in Katowice, Poland, which is an hour away, can be used. Communication takes place in English and Czech.\n\nCareer opportunities in research\n\nThe European Research University is open to cooperation with researchers from all over the world, as long as they share our values, vision, mission and respect our strategic goals. Cooperation is possible externally, but we prefer an internal employment relationship in our research institute either in Prague or Ostrava. We give opportunities not only to respected senior researchers, but also to postdocs with an interesting professional research history. We also accept Master’s degree graduates who can simultaneously study a full-time doctoral study programme in English or Czech.\n\nOur researchers can therefore choose Prague for their work – one of the most visited and most attractive European cities, where the first university north of the Alps and one of the oldest universities in the world was founded in the 14th century, and which is known for its friendly and favorable environment not just for the academic community. But also, if they prefer a less busy environment on the border of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia, i.e. the wider area of Ostrava and the quieter middle with nearby mountains and nature, then they can work directly at the ERUNI Open Research Ostrava. Prague and Ostrava are also very well connected by a direct express train line."
