        "text": "The University of Ostrava today is not only a landmark research and educational research center, but also an active participant in the social life of Ostrava, which helps transform the image of a once industrial city into a modern academic center.\n\nOstrava\n\nOfficial name:\n\nTechnická univerzita Ostrava\n\nWebsite: www.vsb.cz\n\nType of university: state\n\nLanguage of instruction: Czech\n\nFaculties: 7\n\nNumber of years of study: 3-7 years\n\nTraining program:\n\nbachelor's, master's, doctoral studies\n\nOne of the state universities of the Czech Republic, which grants the right to free education for foreign students, is the Ostrava Technical University. One of the oldest educational institutions in the country, which never tires of surprising with innovations and an innovative approach to learning. The Ostrava Technical University or Mining Institute, as the students themselves call it, was founded in the 19th century as a small school, and then moved to Ostrava and got a second life here.\n\nCurrently, 124 bachelor's, master's and doctoral degree programs are taught at the university at the following faculties:\n\nEconomic\n\nConstruction\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nElectrical Engineering and Computer Science\n\nMining and Geological\n\nMetallurgy and Materials Engineering\n\nSecurity Engineering\n\nAdditionally, two university-wide programs have been created:\n\nMechatronics\n\nNanotechnology\n\nTechnical University in Ostrava: how the university was created\n\nLike most popular universities in the Czech Republic today, the University of Ostrava was not created \"from scratch\". VŠB \"grew\" out of the mining school, founded by order of the emperor in 1849. The vocational school produced high-level miners, which contributed to the recovery of the economy. Until the middle of the last century, the educational institution was located in Pribram, but in 1945, after the end of the war, it was accredited, received the status of a university and \"moved\" to the industrial center of the republic — the Moravian-Silesian region, the city of Ostrava.\n\nIn terms of the number of students enrolled in various programs, the University of Ostrava ranks 4th in the Czech Republic. The Faculty of Economics of VŠB-TUO is particularly popular, which is second only to the Prague University of Economics in terms of quality of training. The transition to the Bologna system of education was made by the Ostrava University of Technology one of the first in Europe.\n\nThe diploma of this university is recognized in all EU countries. The University of Ostrava is a member of numerous international associations, in particular such as:\n\nIAU (International Association of Universities)\n\nIACEE (The International Association for Continuing Engineering Education)\n\nELLI (European Lifelong Learning Initiative)\n\nAUDEM (Alliance of Universities for Democracy), etc.\n\nAfter the Czech Republic joined the EU, the university began to pay special attention to European research programs, introduced the European ECTS credit system. Due to the orientation towards the training of mining specialists, the university is a member of the association \"Czech Mining Machinery\".\n\nOstrava Technical University today\n\nThe main specialization of VŠB is technical and economic, but partnership with international organizations allows graduates to provide jobs in companies engaged in various activities. Among the partners: both Czech enterprises — Moravian forestry and automobile companies — and well-known international corporations:\n\nAmerican Nano Society (USA);\n\nEuropean Association for Security in Krakow (Poland);\n\nInternational Association for Engineering Geology and Environment, International Association of Science and Technology for Development (branches worldwide);\n\nJSME – Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers (Japan);\n\nNordic Rheology Society (Norway).\n\nThe university is a full member of one of the associations engaged in the development of rocks and the organization of mining. Of course, this has a positive effect on the employment of graduates. The full list of partner organizations includes several dozen research and industrial enterprises. Perhaps that is why students of the Technical University in Ostrava are not afraid of unemployment. According to the information provided by the Czech Department of Employment, graduates of this university get a job in 97% of cases.\n\nWhat are the chances of admission to VŠB: competition for faculties\n\nA popular educational institution in the Czech Republic offers education in 124 curricula, half of which are taught only in Czech.

Due to the growth of the competition, a decision was made on a two-stage admission:\n\nForeigners who want to study for free must provide a certificate of category B2 (high level of proficiency in Czech) or pass an exam in this subject.

Before submitting documents, they must be nostrified — to confirm the compliance of the document on secondary or higher education received outside the Czech Republic. Remember that the nostrification takes from two weeks to two months, and the deadline for submitting documents is March 31.\n\nWith good grades and passing the certificate competition, the applicant is admitted to an interview in the chosen specialty and profile test. Most of the questions are in mathematics, there are blocks with tasks in chemistry, physics, biology. The applicant's task is to put \"ticks\" next to the correct answers.\n\nIf you are interested in studying at the Ostrava Technical University, use the Prague Education Center training program.
