        "text": "Pittsburgh Penguins president of hockey operations/general manager Kyle Dubas has been added to the front office staff of Team Canada ahead of the 2024 IIHF World Championship held in Prague and Ostrava, Czechia, from May 10-26.\n\nDubas is set to serve as an associate general manager for the Canadian men’s national team, marking the 38-year-old’s international management debut.\n\nRick Nash, director of player development for the Columbus Blue Jackets, was named general manager in March.\n\n“I am excited to welcome Kyle to our management group for this year’s world championship, and to have Jim, Jamie and Tim assist with our player selection process,” Nash said in a statement. “Kyle brings a wealth of professional experience, and we know he will be an invaluable member of our staff that will greatly benefit our team. As we continue preparations and begin selecting our coaching staff, support staff and roster, I know Kyle and our selection committee will play an integral role in ensuring we assemble a team that gives us the best chance to defend gold in Czechia.”\n\nAt least one familiar face may be on Dubas’ team roster in Penguins captain Sidney Crosby, who told reporters Thursday he is considering participating in the World Championship for the first time since 2015 and will soon give an answer to Team Canada.\n\nDubas recently completed his first year as general manager in Pittsburgh after serving in the same capacity with the Toronto Maple Leafs from 2018-23.\n\nCanada’s first game is against Great Britain on May 11. Preliminary round opponents include Denmark, Austria, Norway, Finland, Switzerland and Czechia before the medal games take place May 26."
