        "text": "29 universities from all over Europe participated in this year's GSPORT and the top 8 universities qualified for the offline final in Prague. The MUNI Devils were invited to the tournament as a last minute wild card, as the Ukrainian team NUPESU could not participate due to the political situation and the MUNI Devils were first below the line after the online part.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we had only 2 days to assemble the team and the roster was handed in at the last minute with complications and a weakened team. Despite these complications and inconveniences, we were determined to fight fiercely. However, the VŠB Wolves team was above our strengths, especially in the esport part,\" says the team captain Ondřej Mikuš. After winning the futsal event (8:1) and posting the best overall time on the obstacle course, the MUNI Devils narrowly lost the EA FC 24 match (composed of Martin Řehola and David Blanař 1:2, 1:4) and significantly in the Counter-Strike 2 game (3:13, 2:13), where the hastily assembled lineup had the most significant cracks (Ondřej Mikuš, Jakub Dvořák, Matěj Schwesig and Václav Piskač) and had to be supplemented with one player from EAFC 24 (David Blanař). The series was thus 2:2 and decided in a reactionary coordination game of Blaze Pods, where the preparation on this specific exercise proved crucial and VŠB took the victory on their side and subsequently defended their opening victory from last year in the other games.\n\nOverall, MUNI Devils took 5th place in the international tournament and 2nd place in the Czech Academic Games. \"It was a well-organized event, for which the organizers from GSPORT and FTVS of Charles University deserve a big thank you, and our whole team can't wait to take part in this event next year,\" adds Mikuš.\n\nTeams from the following universities participated in the finals: Masaryk University, VSB – Technical University of Ostrava, Silesian University in Opava, University of Pardubice, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, University of St. Cyril and Methodius in Trnava, Kajaani University of Applied Sciences (FIN), University of Agder (NOR)\n\nMUNI Devils team composition for the offline finals: Ondřej Mikuš (team captain), Jakub Dvořák, Václav Piskač, Matěj Schwesig, Martin Řehola (EA FC section captain), David Blanař, Andrea Karásková (photography/organisational support)"
