        "text": "Cougars standout Ryley Lindgren returned from Oakville, Ontario after being a member of the U SPORTS All-Star team that competed against Canada's National Junior team at the Sport Chek Selection camp Dec. to 9-12. They played two back-to-back games that showcased Canadian University talent and helped the World Junior prospects choose their official roster for the 2020 IIHF World Junior Hockey Championship being held in Ostrava and Trinec, Czech Republic from Dec. 26, 2019 to Jan. 5, 2020. This is the fifth year the U SPORTS All-Stars have faced off against Canada's World Juniors.\n\nLindgren has been a consistent point producer throughout his hockey career. In his second year of Midget AAA with the Winnipeg Thrashers he tallied 50 points in 42 games. He then went on to play for four years in the Western Hockey League. First for the Brandon Wheat Kings who drafted him in the fifth round of the 2011 WHL Bantam Draft, and then was traded to the Lethbridge Hurricanes. In his second season with the Hurricanes, Lindgren scored 27 goals and added 23 assists for a total of 50 points in 65 games played. The next year he would be traded to the Swift Current Broncos at the trade deadline and scored 27 goals and 47 assists for a grand total of 74 points in 72 games.\n\nThe East St. Paul, Manitoba native then set his sights on the university ranks and made an instant impact. He led MRU's 2018-19 team in goals (10) as a rookie. This season, the second year is leading the fourth ranked Cougars in a tight race for the Canada West title. Through the first 16 games of the season, he is currently fifth in the Canada West in points (16) and third in goals (9). This first half performance earned him a spot on the 2019 U SPORTS All-Star team.\n\n\"It's very exciting and an honour to be able to represent MRU and represent the Canada West.\" Lindgren said before flying out to Oakville. \"There are so many guys in this league that we could really make four or five teams. I am looking forward to the opportunity and will try and take advantage of it as much as I can.\"\n\nWhen asked about how he would fit in with the team he commented, \"I'll just try and bring my game when playing against theses talented world junior guys and do my best to contribute to help us win.\"\n\nThe modest forward did just that, scoring the first goal of the week 48 seconds into game #1. The U SPORTS team pulled ahead with a 2-0 lead in the first period, but the World Juniors came back to win the game 4-3. In the rematch the next day, the U SPORTS All-Stars responded by out playing Canada and finishing with a 2-1 win.\n\nGame 1 Stats\n\nGame 2 Stats\n\nMount Royal's Manager of Varsity Athletics, Rob Godfrey, joined the squad as the Team Leader. He was a key facilitator in the selection of the student-athletes, planning and organizing to make the event happen. When asked about Lindgren's play, he commented \"Ryley was hard on pucks, he kept a good pace and was a major factor on special teams. He was part of a penalty killing group that collectively didn't allow a single goal against all week\"\n\nThe event was an overall success for both teams winning a game, but this was much more than just playing hockey commented Godfrey. \"It was a great opportunity for our student-athletes and the rest of U SPORTS to get involved with Hockey Canada once again and showcase hockey in our country. We are excited about future collaborative opportunities that positively impact the hockey community.\"\n\nThe Team Canada World Juniors will finalize their team in the days ahead then travel to the Czech Republic to compete, while the U SPORTS student-athletes return home to finish their fall semester exams. Our Cougars kick off their second semester traveling to Manitoba to play the Bisons in a weekend series. They then return home to the Flames Community Arena to face off against the number one ranked Golden Bears Friday, January 10th at 7:00 PM MST"
