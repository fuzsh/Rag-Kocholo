        "text": "The Czech Republic’s FC Baník Ostrava has taken the first steps towards returning to a new stadium in Bazaly in Ostrava.\n\nTN CZ said the new stadium should have a capacity for at least 15,000 spectators with the possibility to upgrade to 20,000.\n\nThe club are in the Czech First League and currently play at the Městský Stadion in Vítkovice, which has a capacity of 15,275.\n\nThe news of a move to a new stadium was confirmed at a press conference by the Mayor of Ostrava, Jan Dohnal, who said a feasibility study had been carried out into the new venue.\n\nThe total costs would be around 1.5 billion crowns and the start of construction is planned for 2027.\n\nDonhal said, “We are embarking on the journey of the return of Baník to Bazaly. The study did not find anything that would prevent the intention to build a football stadium in Bazaly.\n\n“A capacity of 15,000 is the minimum required for the Czech national team to play regularly in Bazaly. As for the maximum, a stadium with more than 18,000-20,000 will most likely not fit in the area.”\n\nThe former Bazaly Stadium was the club’s home from 1953 to 2015 and had a capacity of around 17,500.\n\nThe Bazaly site is currently being transformed into a Youth Academy that will have five training fields.\n\nTN CZ further stated that in addition to the club itself, this is also great news for the fans, who have had to support their team in Vítkovice for 14 years.\n\nClub owner Václav Brabec said that the football infrastructure is constantly developing under his leadership.\n\nHe said, “The Baník road, and therefore my road, connects to the new Bazaly today. I want to thank the city for commissioning the feasibility study, and I am glad that the study showed that the construction of the stadium in Bazaly is possible.\n\n“I built six plus one football pitches in Ostrava, I invested around 120 million crowns in the construction of the complex on Vista, we built a pitch in Poruba on Šoupalka, we are building two new pitches in Radvanice.\n\n“And from the beginning, in connection with the construction of the new stadium in Bazaly, we are talking about the fact that Baník will participate financially in it, and that will be the case.”\n\nHow much money will be paid to the club will be decided only after the result of the architectural competition, which should be announced later this year. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2027.\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.
