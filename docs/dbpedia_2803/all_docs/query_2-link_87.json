        "text": "VSB – Technical University of Ostrava – is the fourth oldest institution of higher learning in the Czech Republic. Its predecessor was the Mining School in Příbram which came into existence by the emperor’s decree in 1849. In 1945, the Mining University moved to Ostrava and since than it has been paying a key role in the development and restructuring of Northern Moravia and Silesia.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century VSB-Technical University is undergoing dynamic development both in the process of education and in the research and development activities carried out in cooperation with the industrial and business sphere. Nowadays, with over 12,000 students studying bachelor, master and doctoral accredited programs at seven faculties, the school is the fourth largest university in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe entry of the Czech Republic into the European Union is closely connected with the harmonization of study programs within the European area of higher education and in the effort to participate in European research programs. The changes in the structured model of education at the University are carried out in accordance with the Bologna Declaration and the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) has been implemented, enabling the mobility of students and teaching staff in the broader terms of European education programs. The University awards the Diploma Supplement\n\nVSB – Technical University of Ostrava is a modern institution of higher learning offering university education in technical and economic branches of study based on creative inquiry. Nevertheless, also traditional branches of study survive, and thus their monopoly position in the Czech Republic is maintained. At the Faculty of Mining and Geology, the preparation of university educated professionals in the field of Mining Engineering is ensured, while at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering there are professionals in the field of Machines for Mining and Treating Commercial Raw Materials. At the Faculty of Civil Engineering, professionals are educated in the field of Mining and Underground Engineering. All these activities are carried out in close cooperation with mining companies, state administration mining bodies and the producers of mining equipment. The evidence of which is, among other things, also the fact that the University is a member of the association “Česká dobývací technika” (Czech Extraction and Mining Technology)."
