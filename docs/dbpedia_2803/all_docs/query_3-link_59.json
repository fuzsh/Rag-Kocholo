        "text": "ALISY Hrádek Bike & Run Team\n\nRunning - Cycling - Triathlon - Hrádek Nad Nisou\n\nWe are a team of amateur athletes focused on endurance sports, particularly cycling, running, and triathlon. The team was formed at the end of 2022 as a direct successor to Team KSM Hrádek, but we operate on somewhat different principles than our predecessor. Our main focus is on promoting the Alisy brand, which supports us with its clothing. In return, we test it, put it through its paces on the race tracks of our favorite sports, and get it muddy. Another important partner of the team is the town of Hrádek nad Nisou, which significantly supports our activities, and therefore our team proudly carries its name. The core of the team still mainly consists of Hrádek residents, but we have long since expanded beyond this area, and we have welcomed athletes from the wider region into our team.\n\nTogether, we organize races, take care of the local singletrack, and strive to contribute to the development of sports in our town and its surroundings.\n\nDavid Flak\n\nTriathlon - Prague\n\nI've been involved in sports my entire life, but I have been training competitively and systematically for about 13 years. I started with road cycling under the guidance of an excellent coach and cyclist, Jirka Sekera. However, the constant and long hours of training on the bike did not fully satisfy me, and I began to cut bike training short to run instead. Running was immensely enjoyable for me, and the results from running began to be much more interesting than those from cycling. Then I tried a small triathlon race in Počernice and realized that the versatility of triathlon was what I wanted. I have been competing in triathlons for about 6 years, both road and off-road. I participate in short and long distances, as well as the “experience” extreme ones like the Czech Winterman and Slovak Triathlon Attack. In spring and autumn, I primarily compete in running disciplines. I particularly enjoy trail running races over 15km with a lot of elevation gain, where I have achieved very respectable results. And swimming? – that's the hardest triathlon discipline for me. I dislike swimming, and since I'm not good at it, I prefer not to talk about swimming... Triathlon has taught me time management – to be able to precisely plan when, what, and how long. After reading a bedtime story to my daughter, I often fall asleep before 10 PM. Sometimes I need to start training as early as 5:00 AM, like taking a three-hour road bike ride and then being at work by 8:00 AM. I work close to home, at the Archdiocesan Charity in Prague, where I lead a center that focuses on development aid in Sub-Saharan Africa and India.\n\nEva Filipiová\n\nRunning - Šumperk\n\nI work as a physiotherapist and sport is an integral part of my life.\n\nBesides running, I play competitive floorball, and among other favorite sports, I would mention cycling, cross-country skiing, and volleyball.\n\nThis is my 8th season wearing the AK Olymp Brno jersey, where I transferred from my beloved TJ Šumperk for new experiences. To this day, I strive to achieve the best results on the track (3000m steeplechase) and on the road (especially half marathon, marathon), where I had a particularly successful season last year and won my first championship medals in these disciplines.\n\nHowever, sport should not be just about chasing medals; that is something we should all keep in mind :)\n\nJana Hakenová\n\nRunning - Liberec\n\nRunning has somehow become a part of my chaotic life... And because I'm quite competitive, I started racing in 2018, and I think my first race was the same year at the ALISY TROJZEMÍM run, where I also got their first gingerbread medal. So, I've run quite a bit since then, had a lot of fun, but also experienced some sports pain...\n\nBut what really sticks out in my memory is our annual race in Croatia.\n\nDuring our vacation, we also compete, and last year, after three editions, I finally managed to win the second-highest medal among the women.\n\nI wish everyone a lot of sports luck and heaps of health!!!\n\nJana Svatošová\n\nRunning - Liberec\n\nI have been involved in running since the fifth grade of elementary school. Initially, as a miler on the track in the AC Česká Lípa jersey, where we successfully fought with the women's team up to the national top-tier league. Gradually, this hobby transformed into biking and trail running, which has remained with me to this day, and I continue to achieve some success both at home and abroad.\n\nIn winter, I enjoy medal success in cross-country skiing and ski mountaineering.\n\nI am glad that I can combine my hobby with my profession as a physiotherapist, where I address the most common running issues. There's nothing like having a practical perspective.\n\nI am the proud mother of two wonderful teenage children, who are, of course, my biggest life challenge :-)\n\nAnd what do I expect from 2024? Mainly to undertake more running experiences in good health, here, in Austria, Slovakia, and beyond.\n\nJitka Špičáková\n\nRunning - Olomouc\n\nIn college, I needed a way to \"switch off\" from studying, so I started looking for different ways to unwind. I began running, first just a loop around the house, then two... until I was running for an hour and realized I couldn't be without it. Along the way, I tried a race. And voilà. Addiction :)\n\nI run for the great feeling, for the group of people I meet (who are equally \"afflicted\"), for the self-challenge, for fulfilling my dreams—I simply run for myself! It's a time when I am alone with my thoughts.\n\nI am a mother of 2 children, currently taking advantage of maternity leave—running with a stroller :-) I'm somewhat indefatigable, always needing to be on the move. Swimming, cycling, skiing... but mostly, running is my passion.\n\nKarel Jirák\n\nTriathlon - Stráž pod Ralskem\n\nI love being active in the fresh air. In my childhood, it was frolicking with friends and hiking with my parents, later on it evolved into recreational cycling and using it as a mode of transportation. I only started competitive sports after turning thirty, when I got hooked on inline skating and gradually progressed to the winner's podium at the Czech National Championships, and took second place in the duo category at the legendary 24-hour race in Le Mans. After ten racing seasons, I tried a new challenge—triathlon and duathlon—and found my niche. I prefer off-road, but I also compete in road events, and for even more variety, I try different courses from sprint to Ironman distances. In my age category, I have already won a total of 10 medals at the Czech Championships, including 4 golds. I hope that my health and love for sports will continue.\n\nKateřina Mlčochová\n\nTriathlon - Prague\n\nI only started getting serious about sports after the birth of my second daughter. I still remember my first running session, where I was immediately scolded for wearing a \"down jacket\" (a warm jacket) and holding a water bottle in my hand. As years passed, I have been running with my \"social-cultural-dining\" group every Thursday for nearly 12 years. Over time, I increased both the number of kilometers and the time I dedicated to running, which eventually led me to start racing. Every year, I try to beat my personal record in the marathon and half-marathon, and I also participate in smaller local races. In 2018, I added swimming and road cycling to my activities and stood at the start line of a half Ironman for the first time. After three years, I had the honor of becoming the Champion of the Czech Republic and Slovakia in my age category for long-distance triathlon. During the season, I aim for placement in the Czech Cup, but my ultimate motivation is obviously the highest goal... Hawaii. I can't even imagine my life without sports now; I draw energy from it to overcome everyday difficulties, and it's also a tremendous source of relaxation for me. One of the main benefits of sports, as I see it, is the amazing group of people I've met through triathlon.\n\nKatrin Sásová\n\nTriathlon - Šternberk\n\nI am 25 years old and come from the foothills of the Jeseníky Mountains. I have been involved in sports since I was a child, and it is my greatest passion. I started with athletics, which I competed in for 15 years. I always excelled as a sprinter. With the start of my job (as a Physical Education - Natural Sciences teacher), I stepped back from athletics because I wanted to try other sports. After six months of cycling and occasional swimming, I thought it would be fun to try a triathlon. I finished second in my first race. I didn't like that much because whenever I start something new, I want to get better and better. I was incredibly excited by triathlon and had to participate in every race in the area. My first triathlon season ended with a surprise, a 3rd place at the National Duathlon Championships (in my category).\n\nMy goals for the coming years are to continue improving, gain experience, and mainly keep the same desire to compete and win.\n\nThe last thing I would like to say is a line (borrowed from a song by Ben Cristovao), which I also follow: \"Do what you enjoy, with people you enjoy!\"\n\nLukáš Hradecký\n\nRunning - Teplice\n\nI enjoy active movement and sports in almost all their forms.\n\nFrom a young age, I've encouraged my children to be active, so we are constantly at some event, race, or outdoors in nature. However, I always strive to make sure that this active movement is also an interesting experience and discovery.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, I soon found out that RUNNING is better than insulin.\n\nI learned to work with it and completely fell in love with running. After a few races, I knew I could be good at running and started focusing on specific goals and challenges, which I manage to accomplish quite well.\n\nI'm an enthusiast and a bit of a fanatic in everything, so I'm incredibly grateful for my amazing wife, who always sensibly moderates my crazy ideas.\n\nLukáš Pulgret\n\nCycling - Tišnov\n\nThe bike is a passion, a form of freedom, and the best tool for stress relief.\n\nI discovered the beauty of cycling during my studies at high school, where I most enjoyed trails and downhill rides. Over time, I found the magic of mountain biking and competed in my first mountain bike races in 2012. Every year, I line up at the start of about fifteen races.\n\nYou can most often find me in the forests around Tišnov or Pardubice. I also enjoy heading to the Alps, the Dolomites, Spain, or the Jeseníky Mountains with friends.\n\nI have recently completed a cycling coach course. I continually like to push my limits and want to be a better version of myself, both in cycling and in personal life. So try it too!\n\nLukáš Trapp\n\nTriathlon - Karlovy Vary\n\nI am 34 years old (for now :)). Starting from the very beginning, I got involved in sports around the age of 6 when I joined a swimming club in Karlovy Vary, where I'm from and still live. I competed in swimming until I was 15, and since I was no Michael Phelps, it was necessary to look for something a bit different. I grew up in a sports-oriented family where all kinds of sports flourished, and I spent a lot of time cycling, so triathlon was a clear choice. Fortunately, at that time, Karlovy Vary had a large triathlon base, so my further sporting direction had a clear goal. I competed in triathlon up to university, participating in Czech cups in sprint triathlon and Xterra triathlon was also familiar to me. In university, I tried other sports and since I developed a degenerative joint disease during my studies, I had to stop active sports. This allowed me to finish my degree, pursue other interests, and travel. This sports break, where I moved sporadically and as I felt like it, lasted a whole 10 years. In 2022, I felt the need to start doing something systematically again, so I tried to return to triathlon. Although I have less time for training now, having two little whirlwinds at home, working as a teacher provides me space during teaching hours or in the mornings to fit in some training. And because I'm a bit of a spreadsheet type of person who has every minute of their day planned a week in advance, I had to also plan my training efforts. As a motivational goal for the 2024 season, I've set myself to compete in the Ironman 70.3 in Duisburg, Germany, with a goal to finish under 5:45. If my health continues to serve me well and family circumstances allow, I'd like to continue my training efforts in the coming years, perhaps even with higher goals. This year, you can also find me at running races in the Karlovy Vary Hopr league, the triathlon cup of the Karlovy Vary region, or perhaps at the Ledroman sprint triathlon at Italy's Lake Garda.\n\nMartin Turčan\n\nRunning - České Budějovice\n\nI am 44 years old and I love all kinds of sports. From the age of five to twenty, I played competitive football in my hometown of Tisovec. Essentially, since then, I have been running and I still find it enjoyable and fulfilling. The last 3 - 4 years have been even better, thanks to the support of my wonderful family.\n\nSeveral times a year, I participate in races here in České Budějovice and in Slovakia. I run for the joy of it, but of course, it pleases and motivates me when I occasionally win something. I enjoy surpassing myself. I believe that I will be able to continue enjoying sports in good health for many more years.\n\nWhat I like most is that running is a sport where no one loses - on the contrary, everyone who goes out, whether in training or a race, is a winner!\n\nMiroslav Balatka\n\nRunning - Rádlo\n\nI come from a skiing family. My aunt Helena Šikolová is an Olympic medalist from Sapporo. My father and uncle won several times at the Jizerská 50. For this reason, it's not too surprising that my first sport was cross-country skiing, which I started in the second grade of elementary school in a sports class in JBC. Despite winning several medals at the Czech Championships, I felt after a few years that cross-country skiing alone did not fully satisfy me. Therefore, when I started attending the Sports Gymnasium in Jablonec nad Nisou, it was with a focus on biathlon. In biathlon, I was a member of the junior national team along with future stars of the golden generation (Moravec, Šlesingr, Soukup). My greatest achievements include 5th and 6th places in the European Cup races, twice participating in the World Championships in Summer Biathlon (cross-country shooting) – best results being 15th in the mass start and 5th in the relay in Forni Avoltri. I also participated twice in the World Winter Universiade in Innsbruck and Turin. I have won the Czech Championship title in every age category, including adults. Besides sports, I studied at the Faculty of Mechatronics at TUL. I fell so in love with biathlon that I still compete in it. This year, I participated in the Winter World Master Games in Italy, where I won two silver medals in biathlon and added three more precious metals in cross-country skiing. And what is my relationship with running? It has always been part of my summer preparation for the winter. While I used to find road running unappealing, after the birth of my daughter, I started running a lot with a stroller on the road and gradually acquired a taste for it. Therefore, all my personal records were set after the age of thirty. Currently, they stand at: 10 km 34:16, half marathon 1:16:22, marathon 2:52:07. I believe that at least one personal best will improve this year. In conclusion, I would say that running is primarily a form of mental relaxation for me. I have several life mottos, but the main one is: \"Never give up!\"\n\nNatálie Trnková\n\nTriathlon - Roudnice nad Labem\n\nMy parents and grandparents introduced me to sports from a young age, and I tried a wide variety before becoming most captivated by competitive swimming at the age of ten, which I pursued until I was about eighteen. After a roughly two-year break from sports, I naturally started to miss the physical activity and eventually the competitive atmosphere. I tried a few running races and liked that, unlike swimming, you are outdoors. About four years ago, I somewhat accidentally ended up at a triathlon event - I borrowed a bike and decided to give it a try. Since then, I would say that my life has changed quite a bit. Training and combining three disciplines was suddenly something completely different, interesting, but very time-consuming. It absolutely captivated me. I'm not that great at cycling, but even so, I initially directed my first races towards off-road triathlon. Over time, I also moved to road triathlon and currently, I combine both.\n\nI enjoy variety, so besides triathlon, I like to play volleyball, go rock climbing, and in the winter, I do cross-country skiing and ski mountaineering.\n\nOndřej Hudec\n\nRunning - Jezeřany-Maršovice\n\nI live in a small wine-making village in the Znojmo region, I am a father of two, and someone who enjoys all kinds of physical activities. Besides running, which is my priority, I occasionally exercise, ride a bike, and enjoy walking in nature.\n\nYou'll most often find me at running races in South Moravia, primarily on tracks up to 10km, but for a change, I also like to try longer distances – up to a half marathon. In 2023, I managed to repeatedly place on the podium for these distances, which caught the attention of the company Alisy and I had the opportunity to become their ambassador, a role I value greatly and look forward to continuing this year.\n\nThis year, I would like to build on last year's success, improve my race times, and move up in the rankings to the highest places :) Wish me luck!\n\nTereza Kulštejnová\n\nCycling - Kunčice pod Ondřejníkem\n\nCycling has been my passion since I was 12 years old, when I received my long-desired mountain bike as a school report gift. My first rides were with my mom, but soon I began riding alone and used my bike extensively as a means of transportation everywhere. Even though I would ride about 8,000 km a season, it never occurred to me to race. Having two children didn't stop my cycling either; of course, they immediately got a bike trailer upon arrival, which significantly improved my fitness as I pulled them along. I live in the heart of the Beskydy Mountains, so if I want to ride downhill, I have to work hard to get up the hill first.\n\nI entered my first race more or less for fun five years ago, and it never crossed my mind that I would stand on the winners' podium. The feeling was simply indescribable. Two years ago, I bought a road bike, which completely captivated me. But I don't just cycle; in the winter, I run, and I've successfully completed the Czech Championship in the winter mountain marathon LH24 several times, I ski, and I also lead my two children in sports. For me, sports is simply a lifestyle and a form of relaxation, and I thank my husband for supporting me, doing support, servicing the bikes, and most importantly, looking after the kids.\n\nTomáš Smolicha\n\nRunning - Nový Malín\n\nI am 28 years old and I tried my first running race 18 years ago in Česká Třebová with my dad. Since then, I've been hooked. Running for me is not just a sport, it's my passion, my lifestyle. Running gives me energy and joy. Every kilometer, every step, is not just physical activity for me, but also a mental escape and a way to connect with nature.\n\nI run mainly for enjoyment and to improve my fitness. I love discussing training methods, new routes, and races. Running constantly inspires me to discover new challenges and opportunities. I work as a physical education teacher at an elementary school and try to be a role model for my students. I show them that sports and physical activity can be fun and bring not only joy but also health.\n\nWhen planning my free time and vacations, I always try to include some running activity in the program. For me, there is nothing better than waking up early in the morning and hitting a running trail to discover the beauty of new places. My running journeys are not just about races and performance. They are journeys to personal development and happiness. And I hope that by my example, I can inspire others to discover the beauty of running and its positive impact on life.\n\nTomáš Tvaroužek\n\nCycling - Nová Role\n\nSports have always been a part of my life. From a young age, I played hockey, then tennis, and also floorball, but I've been cycling and skiing for as long as I can remember. I started off-road where I tried my first races and also helped manage a cycling club. However, road cycling always fascinated me, and I looked forward to the Tour de France each year, which I faithfully followed. At eighteen, I fulfilled a dream and bought my first road bike, although I started very gradually.\n\nA significant change came during my studies when I needed some relief from studying. That's when I began running, but I also returned to cycling. In 2016, I entered my first local road race and immediately won a victory in the shorter distance. Since then, I've been on a roll. A bit more systematic training, group rides (more like small races), and regular participation in all road races in the Karlovy Vary region. Thanks to weaker competition in my category, there were plenty of podium finishes and some regional championship titles. So, I tried competing beyond the borders of the region in more populated contests, and it was never a big embarrassment. Over the last few years, I've completely fallen for it, ending each year with more than 12,000 kilometers under my belt.\n\nVladimír Kolář\n\nRunning - Hrádek nad Nisou\n\nUntil 2013, I was involved in martial arts, where I was quite successful. One of my biggest achievements was a second place at the European Championships in Germany, followed by many medal placements at the Czech Championships and numerous professional matches in Thai boxing. Until then, running was more of a supplementary activity for me. After 2013, I began to focus on running full-time. After several years of floundering and searching for the right training method, I teamed up with Vítek Pavlišta, and I have been under his guidance ever since. I never expected that despite getting older, a person can still speed up, and I often find myself at the top, even across different categories.\n\nVojtěch Bárta\n\nRunning - Ostrava\n\nI am 25 years old and have been running practically all my life. In my youth, I played football, but I was never very good at it, so my parents enrolled me in the athletic club SSK Vítkovice. For many years, I ran short distances on the track, but at the age of 18, my heart was won over by long road distances. 10 km, half marathon, and marathon. After school, I started working. Even though I work in a three-shift operation, which greatly limits my training, it doesn’t stop me from running about 500 km a month. I try to train according to a plan and prepare as best as I can for the main races of the season under the guidance of coach Pavel Novák. I believe that in the future I can make my way among the Czech running elite, where I will earn my honorable place.\n\nVojtěch Fryč\n\nRunning - Přerov\n\nI have been involved in sports for as long as I can remember. I started with football, then moved on to athletics, and eventually ended up playing cycle ball, which is essentially football on bikes. In high school, I got into floorball, which I continue to play recreationally. I truly fell into running with my dog, as I needed to tire him out. This led me to discover canicross, a sport I had no idea existed at the time. We ran for the joy of it and soon participated in our first races. We began to succeed, and I decided that I should dedicate myself fully to this sport. Now we travel to races all over the country, including the Czech Canicross Championships.\n\nCanicross has become a passion of mine. From a novice who knew nothing about the sport, I have become a coach, helping others discover the magic of running with a dog."
