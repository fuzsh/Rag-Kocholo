        "text": "OSTRAVA, Czech Republic â€“ University of Massachusetts hockey freshman defenseman Zac Jones has been named to the U.S. National Junior Team roster for the 2020 IIHF World Junior Championship, which will be held in Ostrava and Trinec, Czech Republic, Dec. 26, 2019-Jan. 5, 2020, USA Hockey announced on Monday. Jones is one of 23 players to make the final roster and is the first-ever Virginia native to be selected for the U.S. National Junior Team.\n\nJones, a 2019 New York Rangers' draft pick (3rd Rd, 68th overall), is the top scoring defenseman for the Minutemen through 17 games thus far this season as he has registered 12 points on three goals and nine assists with a +9 rating. He was selected as the Hockey East Rookie of the Week as well as one of the UMass Student-Athletes of the Week back on Oct. 21 following a big weekend against Union that saw him log five points on a goal and four assists and +4 over the three games in a 2-1-0 week, which included his second and third multi-point games of the season. Jones currently ranks sixth in Hockey East in defenseman scoring and tied for sixth in freshman scoring.\n\nTeam USA will open the World Junior Championship on Thursday, Dec. 26, when the squad will take on Canada in its first preliminary round game. USA will face Germany on Friday, Dec. 27, Russia on Sunday, Dec. 29, and will close out the preliminary competition on Monday, Dec. 30 against Czech Republic. All of Team USA's preliminary round games are set for 1 p.m. Eastern starts with all games being broadcast on NHL Network.\n\nWith Jones making the U.S. roster, it marks the third straight year that the Minutemen will be represented at the World Junior Championship. Current sophomore goaltender Filip Lindberg earned a Gold medal at the 2019 tournament with Finland and Cale Makar won Gold with Canada at the 2018 World Junior Championship. Other past WJC participants from UMass include William Lagesson (2016, Sweden) and Stephen Werner (2004, USA). Werner was a Gold medal winner, as well. Director of Equipment Operations Josh Penn earned a Bronze medal on staff with Team USA in 2018."
