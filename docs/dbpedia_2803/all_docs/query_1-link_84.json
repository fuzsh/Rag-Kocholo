        "text": "About\n\nHistory\n\nThe University of Ostrava was founded on 28 September 1991. In 1953, a training college for future primary school teachers was opened in the nearby town of Opava. In 1959, all teacher training within the region was streamlined into a single institution – thePedagogical Institute in Ostrava. Five years later, the institute was awarded university status and became an independent Faculty.\n\nEducation\n\nSince its foundation twenty years ago, the University has provided a much-needed focus for the study and research of humanities and social sciences, helping to redress a historic imbalance in a region traditionally dominated by heavy industry and technical studies. The University of Ostrava currently has six faculties: the Faculty of Social Studies, the Faculty of Fine Arts, the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Medicine, the Pedagogical Faculty, and the Faculty of Science.The University offers a wide spectrum of degrees at Bachelor’s, Master’s and doctoral levels, in addition to lifelong learning programmes.\n\nResearch\n\nThe University of Ostrava incorporates two independent research institutes. The Institute for Research and Application of Fuzzy Modeling develops specialist new mathematical methods, while the European Research Institute for Social Work supports the professional growth of young researchers in order to develop knowledge and skills among social work managers and practitioners across the continent.A cornerstone of research in Ostrava is the University Library, a public institution which holds specialist stocks and information resources on all key areas of teaching and research across the University.\n\nCareer\n\nThere are job vacancies on campus and the possibility of a Diploma Suplement. A DS is a document issued automatically and without charge to all graduating students after completion of first (Bachelor's), second (Master's) and third (Doctoral) cycle degree programmes at the University of Ostrava. This is a bilingual document that contains information on the completed study programme, together with a list of all exams passed and the grades achieved.\n\nServices\n\nStudent services\n\nYou can arrange a meeting at the International Department. After arrival, your first step is to go to your place of accommodation. The first working day after your arrival you will meet a member of staff from the International Department of the faculty, who will help you arrange all necessary documents for registration at the university (student identification card, university library and canteen registration, a password for access to the university internet network, and other requirements). Next you will meet a member of the staff from the department, where you will discuss details of your study plan.\n\nHousing services\n\nStudents can be housed in halls of residence in Ostrava, or can hire a private flat or room. The difference, of course, is in the price of accommodation. Prices range from a monthly payment of 1 835 Czech crowns for a room with three beds, 2 000 Czech crowns for a room with two beds and 2 290 Czech crowns for a room with one bed (the quoted prices include energy and services).The student halls of residence are located in two different districts of Ostrava - Vítkovice and Hladnov. The halls of residence in Hladnov are smaller, but have sports facilities attached to them, and there are plenty of shops in the surrounding area. The other halls of residence are in Vítkovice, and have no sports facilities.\n\nLibrary services\n\nYou can use the library services after you register. This is an essential first step, because the services of the University Library are only provided for registered users. The registration period lasts for 12 months and is free of charge for internal users and for persons with special needs.You can only request documents online, in advance, via the on-line catalogue.\n\nICT services\n\nThe University has a Centre for Information Technology.\n\nRoles of the CITTo carry out the analysis of information flows, structures and administrative activities and to coordinate and design information system projects for the UniversityTo provide technical and systems support for the running of the University's information systemsTo create a backbone computer network for the University\n\nMedical services\n\nStudents from the EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland are entitled to the provision of necessary and urgent health care free of charge. Students from non-EU countries should check, whether their country is on the list of countries that have concluded a bilateral agreement with the Czech Republic on mutual provision of necessary and urgent health care free of charge.\n\nStudent Life\n\nCampus life\n\nYou can find a detailed map of the University Premises.\n\nSports facilities\n\nThe University of Ostrava provides its students with the opportunity to work out and do some exercise. There is a programme ‘TEP’ thanks to which you can enjoy many sports and activities at a discounted price (from 20 to 50 percent discount). You can chose from: dance aerobic, dance aerobic, port de bras, port de bras, badminton, fit box, vinyasa yoga, bosu, bouldering.\n\nStudent clubs\n\nA network of European university students’ organisations established to promote and support student exchange, international and intercultural communication among students of various nationalities and cultures. The network is organised on the local, national and international levels.The branch members assist incoming international students from the very beginning, even before their arrival in Ostrava. They offer a buddy system, organise sporting and cultural activities, hold a range of special events, and involve foreign students in a variety of activities connected with Czech society and culture in order to familiarise them with the Czech way of life."
