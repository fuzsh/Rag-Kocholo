Sergey Gerasimov was one of the leading masters of Soviet art. His early paintings were similar to Sezannizm. In 1920s he created a series of peasant characters in drawing, lithograph and painting. He created monumental pictures about history of Revolution, in particular Front-line soldier (1926), Oath of Siberia partisans (1933). His works of 1920s — first half of 1930s were characterized by simple composition, monochrome coloring and expressive drawing.

In mid 1930s Gerasimov’s manner of painting changed. He began to follow the traditions of the Russian plain-air painting; in his scene paintings and landscapes he followed the style of K. A. Korovin and V. A. Serov. Landscapes by Gerasimov were characterized by poetical interpretation of nature, harmonic and fresh colors. He also worked a lot in watercolor (cycle Landscapes of Mozhaysk, 1954). The most significant artist’s paintings of 1940s — 1960s were Mother of partisan (1943, changed in 1949–1950) and For Soviet power (1957).

Works by Sergey Gerasimov are in many museum collections, including the State Tretyakov Gallery, the State Russian Museum, and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts. There is memorial House-Museum of S. V. Gerasimov in Mozhaysk.
