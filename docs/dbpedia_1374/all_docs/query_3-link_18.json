        "text": "Traditional twenty lots — is eleven paintings, nine of the original sheets and one — prints and two works made in mixed media\n\nNote: the fee from buyers is 18 %.\n\nCatalogue of the Auction № 239\n\nSelected lots of the Auction № 239\n\nwe Begin the story is not quite usual. So: collectors of the early works of the sixties are in for a pleasant surprise. We do not specifically collect them into a single directory, it turned out, but it is still interesting.\n\nOpens a directory string landscape, where the earliest time of creation — watercolor \"Summer landscape with trees\" (end of XIX century) Nikolai Nikolaevich Gritsenko. Along with seascapes and paintings on the theme of the Russian Navy, which in the first place a famous artist, in his work there are a number of watercolors, executed in different cities of Russia. The expert notes in watercolors Gritsenko \"rich, saturated color and precision in details\". Our light the light of work done in a wide range of green colors and shades, reveals the artist as a gifted colorist and master of chamber species and lyrical landscapes.\n\nIn 1915 created a wonderful canvas \"Landscape\" Fyodor Petrovich Riznichenko. It is known that Riznichenko worked primarily as a landscape painter, he participated in academic exhibitions and exhibitions TPHV. In 1911 at the Autumn exhibition in the halls of IAH held his solo exhibition.\n\nNatural oil \"Rocky shore. Ocean\" Konstantin Aleksandrovich Veselova written in 1930-й — the first half of the 1940s-х years, i.e. after the artist's departure from Russia. Sea surrounded by spectacular cliffs, — is one of the favorite subjects of the artist: started his artistic career with the genre and historical works, in the mid 1910-х, after trips to Greece and Italy, Veselov turned to the scenery, and since marine species, with a characteristic emphasis on the color of the water illuminated by the sun, made up a considerable part of his work. The expert writes that \"in this small landscape, feel the passion Veselova the picturesque discoveries of the French Impressionists, his ability to pass state and mood of the chosen motif\".\n\nNext time create — etude \"Kabardian horse\" (1941-1942) LeonidViktorovich Turzhansky. According to the memoirs of his daughter, in 1941, 66-летний the artist as part of a large group of Moscow masters of arts he moved with his family to evacuate to the North Caucasus, in the town of Dolinsk: \"Soon Turzhansky moved to Nalchik, where the Chairman of the Committee on Affairs of culture of the Kabardino-Балкарской ASSR X. S. Temirkhanov offered him a contract for the creation of the painting \"a Herd of Kabardian horses.\" <...> Received the order on “the Herd”, Turzhansky left to write horses in the mountain town of Kyz-Бурум.\n\nDespite his advanced age, his father took a job with amazing enthusiasm. The nature of the South that he had not loved, because I thought her beauty corny, it was suddenly as-то-новому seen in the North Caucasus.\n\nFrom a business trip he brought back many vivid sketches — were here and Kabardian horses, and oxen, and donkeys on the sun-drenched streets... <...>\n\nbased On the collected mountains of material father made a sketch, which depicted a herd of horses and trot in the cloak on the background of mountains and evening sky. To complete the picture, he succeeded only in Tbilisi, moved to Moscow masters of the art after the front close to Nalchik\".\n\nAnd even a small fragment from the memoirs of the artist's daughter: \"Turzhansky Loved to write also on thick or coated paper. Used to do it quite often leaves of the old technical books or journals, on which he \"pulled an impression from nature,\" seen from the window\".\n\nIn the work Alexander Mikhailovich Gerasimov watercolors occupy a special place. As the expert writes, \"in contrast to his formal paintings in watercolors it's surprisingly free. They are virtuosic, light, airy, colorful, impressionistic. A. M. Gerasimov interested in sophisticated and bold color relationships, play and interaction vivid colours\". Watercolor \"India. Village\" (1954), written during the creative trips to India, the artist sought to convey the immediate impression of a landscape.\n\nOne of the most beautiful works catalog — small early oil \"Submarine\" (1963) Andrei Borisovich Grositsky. The elongated shape of submarines in the background the North sea and the hills, near the town of Polar, written low-key, but the amazing diversity of colors palette.\n\nCompletes the landscape of string acrylic \"Tower\" (2012) Konstantin A. Batynkov — work is bright, colorful, very dynamic, multi-part, in a recognizable author's style.\n\nthe Following a small section — portraits. He opens his pastel \"the girl with the domra\" (1926-1927) Ivan G. Nikolaevaa.\n\nK \"the gallery male images that belong to the best creative achievements of the artist\" Sergei Vasilyevich Gerasimov, the expert will take a small oil \"Watchman\" (2-я third of the twentieth century), noting it is characteristic of the author's techniques.\n\nIn our time the interest in the personality of the famous in Soviet times, the healer (Yes-да, this is not a reservation) and astrologer juna Davitashvili growing, it removed the series, and in 1980-х almost since it began in the press (the Soviet press!) and in society (especially among intellectuals) massive interest in alternative medicine, healing, and all that is connected with them. Djuna producedan unusual impression; and it is obvious that only a personal acquaintance with her could inspire Anatoly T. Zverev to create a \"portrait of June\", written in 1983. The expert notes that \"by this time, the beast stopped writing experimental creative things and generally worked to order. Nevertheless, A. T. Zvereva survived a huge potential, incredible craftsmanship and a striking sense of color, ability avaricious graphic means to write the amazing tension and intensity of the expressive, psychological portraits. ...portrait ...despite the fact that this workshop, concise work that is deliberately made Zverev in dark and muted colors. The artist focuses the viewer's attention on a huge, \"burning\" the eyes of the mysterious woman, making this picture a tense, powerful\".\n\nstring adjacent To the portrait of two theatrical works, and one illustration.\n\nIn 1998 for a new production at the Bolshoi ballet theater R.N. Shchedrin's \"Skate-Горбунок\" Boris Messerer Asafovich created the sketch of a costume \"Medusa\". For this production, 1999, the composer made a new version of the ballet, turning it into a dazzling Russian spectacular, the first steps which Ivan falls to the bottom of the sea-океана to get the ring King-девицы. There he entertained seahorses, corals and jellyfish, one of which was created by our graceful sketch of a very interesting costume.\n\nAuthor's colored lithograph Mikhail Mikhailovich Shemyakin \"Heat-птица 2\" (1989) refers to a series of \"Stravinsky Ballet\". The work is accompanied by a Certificate of the Fund of the artist Mikhail Shemyakin (St.-Петербург), which is very important given the number of fakes, unfortunately, flooded the market this bright and unusual artist.\n\nfigure Boris Petrovich Sveshnikov \"fantastic characters\" filled in 1960-70-х. \"a Brilliant draftsman, during this period he was active and did a lot of illustration for a living, — experts says: — making great designs for books, especially fairy tales\".\n\nthe Genre of still life is represented in our current catalogue two works — bright, very colorful and fun canvas \"Chamomile\" (2004) Olga Nikolaevna Grechina and minimalist acrylic \"untitled (still life with white teapot)\" (2015) Ani Acorn.\n\nK \"typical, early, fantasy, romantic compositions\" Alexander V. Kharitonov is the drawing colored and graphite pencils \"Dance\" (1957). The expert said: \"figure executed masterfully, emotionally, concise and expressive\".\n\nSmall tempera Boris Pest \"Duesenberg\" (1987) refers to a series of original works on the car (we have in database even one plane, made in the same manner). The style of these Avto-портретов obviously close to the avant-garde 1920-х, but an artist by-своему transformerait techniques of the avant-garde — and appear extremely stylish and sometimes very funny things. Our work is elegant and restrained coloristic: the American company \"Duesenberg\" existed in the years 1913-1937, and releasing a very expensive luxury cars.\n\nthe Last section of the directory — abstraction.\n\nTwo works in it — works of the seventies. The first of them — hardboard VladimirN. Tryamkina \"untitled (Abstract composition)\" 1980 in original author's technique. \"Tryamkin covers all the pictures secret composition called \"ganozisa\", which he learned while studying in the Studio of T. V. Khvostenko, known for his research in the field of scenic technology, — is written on the website of the artist. — His unconventional approach can be seen in the choice of material. He loves and feels the material with which it works by using to create their creations unusual media: sand, dry plant, paint, dissolved in turpentine, various kinds of fabrics, metal, wood, plumbing and automotive parts\". Well, plumbing and automotive parts in this song there, but the intrigue as to the material and technology this strikingly powerful work of — indefinitely.\n\nSecond job — is quite large (64 × 61) and busy oil \"untitled (Abstract composition)\", 1975 Sergei Mikhailovich Bordachev.\n\nCompletes the catalog of almost a meter of the song \"Four aces\" Vladimir Nikolaevich Nemukhin — copyright 2006 version. The thing is that as-то all fits very well: a great collector's size that is important in the work of the author of the theme, recognizable style, canvas, author's technique — and this painting is quite beautiful!\n\nThose who are going first to buy a painting or drawing, would be helpful to know that no monitor ever authentic will not give works of art. Color, texture, not to mention the aura of a particular work, the impression from the meeting with her, the monitor is not subject. Good thing he can do at least wishy-washy, and not very good, on the contrary, to embellish (the last one we have, but it is fair to say it's worth). In addition, each person sees and feels by-своему. So come see all the work with my own eyes we have, Gorokhovsky, 7 (only need to call and make an appointment).\n\nwe Wish you all a good bargain and good shopping!\n\nthe Fair market price level on the works of the authors represented in the catalog of this auction can be identified in the information database of auction results ARTinvestment.RU.\n\nOn the auction AI continues to operate a virtual party \"Reserve price is not reached\". He appears in the final minutes of trading, so that customers have the option to kill the reserve price (for those items where it is). In other words, if you see party \"Reserve price is not reached,\" that is a reason to continue the fight — perhaps the victory is near.\n\nIf the latter rate appears accompanied litters \"Until reserve was 1 step\", it means that making the next bet, you win the auction — unless, of course, who-нибудь, inspired close luck not interrupt your last words. And always a shame when participants traded a few days and especially the last couple of hours excitedly before closing suddenly stop just one step from victory. If you feel that thing — is yours, so take this step!\n\nNote: the fee from the buyer is 18 % of the final price of the lot.\n\n***\n\nWe continue to make paintings and drawings (original and lottery) to our regularweekly auctions.
