        "text": "They are charged with ordering direct attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.\n\nThe ICC said in a statement that judges found \"real indications that the two suspects bear responsibility for missile attacks targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure between October 10, 2022, and March 9, 2023.\"\n\nShoigu and Gerasimov are accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, described by the court as \"inhumane acts,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn response, the Russian Security Council, quoted by the Reuters news agency, claimed that the warrants are part of a hybrid war against Russia.\n\nThe ICC relies on member countries to enforce arrest warrants, as it does not have its own police force.\n\nSince February 2022, the ICC has issued eight arrest warrants related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including those for Shoigu and Gerasimov.\n\nNotably, Russian President Vladimir Putin is also among those charged, accused of war crimes involving the unlawful deportation of children from occupied Ukrainian territories to Russia.\n\n(jh/gs)\n\nSource: PAP"
