        "text": "After Stalin consolidated the major animation studios and closed down smaller regional studios to create a single Moscow- based drawn and puppet animation studio, the animation studio Soyuzmultfilm became the largest animation studio in Eastern Europe. In the 1960s, Soviet Jewish animators focused on the theme of social geography and developed individual characters in relationship to social mapping. This essay analyses the enigmatic Cheburashka, the Soviet Mickey Mouse, whose popularity as a Communist ideal led to his starring role as Soyuzmultfilm's most enduring logo. It is particularly concerned with the development of the ethnically-unidentifiable Cheburashka against the history of the Moscow Zoo and its inter-species exhibitions.\n\nThis article provides a survey of Soviet animation and analyses the thematic and stylistic course of its development. The animated film of Soviet Union emerged and materialised in synch with, and was directly shaped by, the fluctuations of the region’s political climate. A number of tendencies and currents of Soviet animation also pertain to other Eastern European countries. After all, Eastern Europe constituted an integrated cultural space that functioned as a single market for the films produced across it by filmmakers who interacted in a regional professional network of film education, events, festivals, publications etc. Initially experimental, the post-revolutionary Russian animation soon fell under the sway of socialist realist discourse, together with the rest of the Soviet art field, and quickly crystallised as a didactic genre for children. Disney’s paradigm became its major source of inspiration both in terms of visual style and thematic scope despite the fact that Soviet Union was regarded as the ideological opposite of Western way of life and mindset. Soviet animation industry was spread across different studios and republics that adopted slightly varied production practices and tolerated different degrees of artistic freedom. Studios in smaller republics, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in particular stood out for making more ideologically complicated films than those produced in Moscow.\n\nThis article argues that a queer temporality emerged during the era of Soviet Stagnation: the Stalinist past was unspeakable and the future postponed or foreclosed. In response to the limited horizon of “developed socialism” – the loss of narrative coherence and futurity, the never‑to‑arrive communist promise – an expanded present rich in possibility and feeling was brought into being in animated films, providing a time and space where one could desire again. Iurii Norshtein’s Ëzhik v tumane (Hedgehog in the Fog, 1975), Fëdor Khitruk’s Vinni‑pukh films (1969‑72) and Bremenskie muzykanty (Bremen Musicians, 1969) activated desire and altered fantasy not, as one might expect, through a reestablishment of linear time, but a reimagining of stagnation as a domain of thrilling, non‑teleological explorations. Where the fog in Ëzhik v tumane precipitated a lack and set the libido in motion, Vinni‑pukh provided a partial solution to the Brezhnev‑era desire crisis by staging polymorphous perversity and an elastic “kitchen time”; and Bremenskie muzykanty further developed the new socialities, loves, and forms of enjoyment communicated by such queer temporality. Gaps, magically intimate spaces, queer embodiment, and disfigured time were performed within the diegetic frame as well as instantiated by the film‑as‑object, asking spectators to playfully examine the impasses of late socialism, and imagine a libidinally saturated life, abounding with potentiality.\n\nIn his text Semiotics of Cinema, Iurii Lotman, discusses the idea that “a film is part of the ideological struggles, culture and art of its era ... related to numerous aspects of life lying outside the text of the film.” In examining an array of Soviet animations, Lotman’s idea can be supported. In particular the series Nu, pogodi!, an extrapolation of its socialist, political time, captures the essence of the Soviet culture and the society in which it was produced. Through studying the characteristics embedded in Nu, pogodi! and other works, one not only gains an understanding of the practices of Soviet animation, but also the social and cultural position of Russia at the time each episode was released."
