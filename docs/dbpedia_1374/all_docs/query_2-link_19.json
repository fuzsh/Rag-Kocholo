        "text": "Traditional twenty lots — is eleven paintings, four sheets of an original and two — graphics and three works made in mixed media\n\nthe Catalogue of the Auction № 166.\n\nSelected lots of the Auction № 166\n\na Selection of landscapes begin with a surprisingly harmonious appearance of the famous Geneva attractions — pencil drawing of the late nineteenth century \"Island of Rousseau. Geneva\" hand brilliant painter and master of watercolors, one of the organizers of the Society of Russian watercolorists (1880) Ludwig Osipovich, Premazzi (Luigi Premazzi). Our work is a landscape sheet with field sketch of part of the Park on the river Rhone, named after philosopher Jean-Жака Russo.\n\na species of Gallery European landscapes continues watercolour \"Locronan\" (1957) Alexander Nikolayevich Benois, created one of the most beautiful villages of Brittany. \"The landscape can be traced steady lines of the natural style of late landscape artist with a particular density the application of watercolors, restrained color, special refinement which give a purplish shade and the use of drawing graphite pencil, both preliminary and lying on top of a layer of watercolor as a spectacular decorative sheet\" (E. A. Ilyukhina).\n\nFrom Europe to the glories of Central Asia draws the viewer small work oil on cardboard \"Asian street\" (the first half of 1940-х) brush Sergei Vasilyevich Gerasimov. Our study is likely to have been painted from life, in Uzbekistan, where Gerasimov was evacuated during the war. At work, you can see individual style features of the style of the artist beginning 1940-х — in particular, according to experts, a very typical main coloristic chord, built on the contrast of large areas of yellow-охристого, gray-лиловых shadows and little bright spots of pink-красного and black.\n\nExtends to our \"landscape geography\" picturesque, very atmospheric view \"In the Himalayas (From India)\" (1874-1876) Vasily Vasilyevich Vereshchagin — one of a series of field works by Vereshchagin in the journey to India in 1874-1876.\n\nIn comparison with the power of vereschaginskiy mountains, against which human figures do not look just staffage, and the small scattering of beads at the foot of the gigantic rocks, especially chamber looks like oil on cardboard \"On Sparrow hills\" (third quarter of the twentieth century) Boris Vladimirovich Ioganson. Unlike large software things of the artist, in which he follows the traditions of Russian painting of the XIX century (mainly the manner of I. E. Repin and V. I. Surikov), our work is written in a light, almost impressionistic manner, in line with Korovinskoe tradition, like many other artist's works that were created not by the order, and for himself.\n\n\"view on the Volga river\" (1930-е) Anatoly Adrianovich Lebedev-Шуйского written in a Mature manner of the artist: he seems to overlook the surroundings from the height of bird flight, and in the color scheme uses a combination of pink-охристой of the earth and greenery; the landscape has a subtle spatial sense, \"wide breath\", which distinguishes the best work of the artist.\n\nOil on cardboard \"dry trees\" (1956) Viktor Efimovich Popkov — work 24-летнего painter, student mgahi. VI Surikov (1952-1958). In 1956 Viktor Popkov traveled to the construction of the Irkutsk hydroelectric power station. There's probably in the vicinity of lake Baikal, and was written this scenic, full of sensations untouched by man, nature, the view of deadwood. Cardboard \"dry trees\" mentioned in the list of paintings by Viktor Popkov for 1956, published in the book V. S. Manin \"Viktor Efimovich Popkov (Slain artist Victor Popkov)\" in 2008.\n\nAnd another type of dry forest — dried autumn leaves and tree stump dotted with mushrooms, bathed in a colorful drawing with colored pencils \"Turgenev\" (1996) creative tandem Vladimir Dubossarsky and Alexander Vinogradov. Our little (27,5 x 18,5) not drawing easel graphics, and a sketch for the large (140 × 100) work oil on canvas \"Turgenev's \"notes of a hunter\"\" (1996) from the series \"Russian literature\" is stored in one of the Moscow private collections.\n\nWith Russian literature are directly connected and the following two works in our collection. Etching \"Night watchman under the lantern (Au Garde Le Réverbère)\" (1923-1927) Marc Chagall — is one of the 96 illustrations made by Marc Chagall in the years 1923-1927 and published in two volumes \"Dead souls\" in the publisher Tériade edition of 368 copies in 1948. The first edition of engravings was printed in 1927-м, and one instance of it, the artist was sent to Moscow, in Tretyakov gallery, accompanied by the inscription: \"Presented to the Tretyakov gallery with all my love Russian artist to his homeland the series of the 96 prints I made in 1923-25. to \"Dead souls\" by Gogol for the publisher Ambroise Vollard in Paris.\" However, Vollard to publish \"Dead souls\" did not have time. Book with illustrations by Chagall saw the light in Paris in 1948, after almost ten years after the death of Vollard. \"Dead souls\" was printed in two massive volumes and, like many other terazosin publications, was nabrasyvanii, original prints, artwork, Bindery folders and the General case, published in small editions intended for museums, libraries and collectors (source: marc-chagall.ru).\n\na unique illustration to the literary work can be considered impressive for its imagery, detailed draw sheet \"and Watch the owls (Monster)\" Lev Evgenievich Kropivnitsky based on the poem by V. Bryusov in 1976.\n\nAnd another memorable (almost a portrait!) image— expressive, free \"cat with fish\" (1989) Victor Semyonovich Kazarin.\n\n\"Man in glasses (Portrait of Viktor Mikhailov)\" (1980) Anatoly T. Zverev is an example of \"Zverev\" portrait of manners: the work is written by oil on a paper directly from the tube of paint without using brushes or other tools. But it is also an impressive monument of the era: the man depicted in the portrait, — close friend Zverev, Victor S. Mikhailov-Романов, artist and eccentric, the owner of the famous \"village of St. Michael\", the apartment, which was going almost the whole Moscow Bohemians 1960-70-х (source: messie-anatol.livejournal.com).\n\nGallery of female images reveals \"Girl\" (1980) Igor V. Voroshilov — recognizable and very characteristic example of the original author's style.\n\nis Highly conditional to the portrait genre can be attributed, and written in a modernist vein, \"the Cellist\" (1990-е) modern Tashkent artist Shakira Zakirova.\n\nAnd one that any genre, whether the portrait is clearly inspired by the literary (or song) sources — beautiful, stylish and sensual graphical composition \"Waiting Malbruk\" (1990) contemporary artist Vladimir Nikolayevich Petrov-Гладкого.\n\nstill life section begins with a refined, restrained and noble in color of the subject of the play \"fruit Basket\" (1954) a representative of the Russian Diaspora Nikolai Alexandrovich Isayev, relating to the Mature period of the artist. Game thin silver tones create the feeling of moonlight pouring through the window of the fruit basket and flowers.\n\nIn a completely different style, reminiscent of the quest of the artists of the first wave of the Russian avant-garde, made \"still life with bottle\" (1989) Valeria Paton of Tunica.\n\nAnd completes the section is bright, colorful, written in a free, pastose manner flower-фруктовый \"still life with green apples\" (2001) Aaron Froimovich Buch.\n\nIn the last part of the description of lots 166-го of the Auction we took a couple of abstractions.\n\nthe Song \"untitled\" Boris I. Zhutovski comes from the artist's Studio and bears the distinctive features of figurative language in the wizard.\n\n\"the Probability\" (1994) Vladimir Nikolaevich Nemukhin, made the difficult mixed media, is a right-таки the quintessence of the author's unique style: here and simplified geometric forms, and discreet, local flavor, and of course, the \"brand\" nemuhinskie card symbols.\n\nThose who are going first to buy a painting or drawing, would be helpful to know that no monitor ever authentic will not give works of art. Color, texture, not to mention the aura of a particular work, the impression from the meeting with her, the monitor is not subject. Good thing he can do at least wishy-washy, and not very good, on the contrary, to embellish (the last one we have, but it is fair to say it's worth). In addition, each person sees and feels by-своему. So come see all the work with my own eyes we have, Gorokhovsky, 7 (only need to call and make an appointment).\n\nwe Wish you all a good bargain and good shopping!\n\nFair market pricethe level works of the authors represented in the catalog of this auction can be identified in the information database of auction results ARTinvestment.RU.\n\nOn the auction AI continues to operate a virtual party \"Reserve price is not reached\". He appears in the final minutes of trading, so that customers have the option to kill the reserve price (for those items where it is). In other words, if you see party \"Reserve price is not reached,\" that is a reason to continue the fight — perhaps the victory is near.\n\nIf the latter rate appears accompanied litters \"Until reserve was 1 step\", it means that making the next bet, you win the auction — unless, of course, who-нибудь, inspired close luck not interrupt your last words. And always a shame when participants traded a few days and especially the last couple of hours excitedly before closing suddenly stop just one step from victory. If you feel that thing — is yours, so take this step!\n\nNote: the fee from the buyer 15% of the final price of the lot.\n\n***\n\nWe continue to make paintings and drawings (original and lottery) to our regular weekly auctions.

After these 30 minutes, if not received the new rate, Internet-аукцион will be closed — otherwise it will be extended for an additional 30 minutes.
