        "text": "author Evstratova Elena Nikolaevna\n\nSergei Vasilievich Ivanov (1864–1910) Shortly before his death, Ivanov again turned to the topic of the arrival of foreigners in Moscow. The painting \"German\" (1910) is made in a humorous manner: the townspeople, with a feeling of fright or outright ridicule, examine the guests dressed in ridiculous and strange\n\nFrom the author's book\n\nSergey Evdokimov S.I. Evdokimov I begin this story with special emotional excitement. Sergei Ivanovich Evdokimov is one of the most talented architects of the post-war period, dear to many who knew him. He has not been with us for more than 30 years, but the very name of the master gives rise to many\n\nFrom the author's book\n\nIvan Fomich Khrutsky 1810–1885 Khrutsky was born in the town of Ulla in the Lepel district of the Vitebsk region in the family of the Uniate (Greek Catholic) priest Foma Ivanovich Khrutsky. He graduated from the Polotsk Lyceum faculty \" liberal arts\"And left for St. Petersburg, where\n\nFrom the author's book\n\nLarionov Mikhail Fedorovich (1881-1964) Resting soldier Larionov connects style features folk primitive with the sophistication of the flavor of traditional French painting. A young soldier takes a break from the hardships of service: famously akimbo, he sprawled by the fence, smoking\n\nSergei Vasilievich Gerasimov (1885-1964) - an outstanding Russian and Soviet artist. In addition, he is known as the first secretary of the Board of the Union of Artists of the USSR, director of the Moscow State Art Institute. IN AND. Surikova and Doctor of Art History. His titles and regalia would be an honor to any other artist in our country. In 1947, Sergei Vasilyevich became an Academician of the Academy of Arts of the USSR, in 1958 - People's Artist of the USSR, and posthumously, in 1966 - a Lenin Prize Laureate. He illustrated the works of the great writers Gorky and Nekrasov. Gerasimov is considered a Russian impressionist and socialist realist.\n\nSergey Gerasimov was born in Mozhaisk in 1885, he studied painting at the Moscow Stroganov School of Industrial Art and at the School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. At the age of 30, the artist built himself a workshop in hometown... Sergey Vasilievich was anxious about native land and depicted him on his canvases.\n\nFor example, the painting \"Evening in Mozhaisk, 1959\" is worth noting. It is written in the clear traditions of post-impressionism (in some ways it even resembles canvases).\n\nWarm tones of the palette convey the charm of an evening in the provinces, pink airy clouds touch with their iridescence and calmness. In the picture, nature comes to the fore, luxurious green trees. The houses in the background are depicted extremely schematically, as if yielding all laurels to the beauty of nature. It would seem a rather schematic canvas, but how much atmosphere, mood and warmth there is!\n\nSinging the beauty of the homeland, Sergei Vasilievich continued the creative traditions of A.K. Savrasov,. Distinctive feature his paintings had lyricism. They say that they convey the breadth and kindness of the Russian soul.\n\nTwo of Sergei Vasilyevich's paintings are now in. These are \"Ice Gone, 1945\" and \"Peasant Holiday, 1937\".\n\n\"The Ice Has Gone\" is a 76 x 103.6 cm canvas, painted in oil on canvas and purchased from the author in 1947.\n\nThe plot of the picture is simple, it again depicts a small fragment of nature. The trunks of birches near the reservoir echo in colors with a gray-white sky, faded ocher tones in which the earth is depicted very clearly give us a feel for that very time of the year when the ice has already melted and spring has not come. The picture can be called cold and warm at the same time: the dullness and boredom of winter still sounds in it, but a small hope for spring is already heard. This work is especially valuable because Gerasimov succeeded in an extremely realistic way, despite the vague impressionist brushstroke “to make a photograph” of his native land.\n\nBy the way, Sergei Vasilievich has another picture on this topic, \"Spring, March\". It is also very interesting for its sketchiness.\n\nThe branches of the trees are painted with quick, clear strokes, as if they were drawn with a sharp needle. And the sky ... What a stunning spring-air sky on this canvas! Every resident of Russia, looking at this picture, will say that the artist was able to catch that very feeling of spring in March.\n\nBut back to the collection of the Tretyakov Gallery. The second picture, kept in the gallery, is \"Peasant Holiday, 1937\". The painting captures a moment in the life of the common people: a table with the letter \"G\" with pies and a bouquet of modest wild flowers on it, a box of wine and beautiful, strong people with open faces. The color palette, highlights and highlights on the canvas deserve special attention.\n\n\"Peasant holiday\" is considered a program soviet work, many artists in our country subsequently painted pictures on similar subjects.\n\nMany of the artist's canvases depict the revolution and the war, from which one can practically study both the history of our country and the life of the common people. For example, a picture on military theme \"Mother of the Partisan, 1943\". It depicts a woman whose son is being taken to be shot. A barefoot peasant woman fearlessly blocked the path of a German soldier. There is excruciating pain in her eyes, the mother realizes that her son will be killed. But she bravely meets grief and does not give way to the fascist. The picture symbolizes the inflexibility of the Russian spirit in the face of disaster.\n\nAnother picture on the theme of the struggle of the Russian people during the Civil War is called \"The Oath of the Siberian Partisans, 1933\". In the center of the picture is a red flag - the symbol of the \"red partisans\". This war (1917-1922) was one of the main themes of Soviet painters even after a decade. In the picture, Sergei Gerasimov painted a crowd of people with rifles and distorted faces, and a coffin with a red flag over it. The faces of people are again spelled out rather schematically, in the spirit of impressionism, but this schematic wonderful way conveys the emotions experienced by the heroes of the picture.\n\nSergey Vasilievich Gerasimov has received many awards. His paintings are now in the Tretyakov Gallery, the State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg, the Institute of Russian Realistic Art in Moscow, the Taganrog Art Museum, the Krasnoyarsk State Art Museum named after Surikov. Sergey Vasilievich was buried at Novodevichy cemetery in Moscow.\n\nCollection of works of a remarkable Russian artist, classic soviet art Sergei Vasilievich Gerasimov is distinguished by its monographic completeness and, thanks to its high artistic quality, enjoys a well-deserved prestige in our country and abroad. Various sides of Gerasimov's multifaceted talent are widely represented, and each stage creative development reflected by characteristic patterns. A number of works are proud national culture... Gerasimov's work of the Soviet period is rightfully considered programmatic, clearly expressing the most fruitful tendencies of socialist realism.\n\nAll of Gerasimov's works - whether it is a large-format plot-thematic painting or a small pictorial sketch, easel graphic composition or book illustration - are recognized immediately, at first sight, testifying to its artistic originality, to the uniqueness of what has been done in art. They express - and expressed talentedly - spiritual and aesthetic ideal the era in which the artist lived.\n\nThe collection of works by Gerasimov can tell about the artist's versatile interest in the world around him, about the transfer of both dramatic and harmonious sides of life. Gerasimov was distinguished by close attention to the life of people and nature, to the life of an individual and the phenomena of a wide public sound, to the \"small\" and significant.\n\nBecoming creative personality Gerasimov took place during the period of a kaleidoscopic change in various artistic trends, at a time of intense experimentation and intense ideological clashes of opposing groups, schools and ephemeral schools. The young artist was not carried away by the whirlpool of maximalist attitudes of numerous avant-garde movements. He remained faithful to the aesthetic precepts of the realistic school of Russian painting. This was facilitated by the lessons he received from S.V. Ivanova, K.A. Korovin, V.A. Serova, A.E. Arkhipova, L.O. Pasternak during his studies, first at the Stroganov Central School of Art and Industry (1901 - 1907), and then at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (1907-1911).\n\nThe Tretyakov Gallery has two paintings by the artist, executed in the pre-revolutionary period of creativity. The main array of his works of this time in the gallery is graphics. This imbalance is not due to a gap in the meeting, but rather the preference, which Gerasimov gave then to graphic techniques, or rather watercolors. He received the title of artist in 1912 for a watercolor sheet - “ Portrait of a man. Portrait of the book publisher and educator I.D. Sytin».\n\nThe young Gerasimov worked most intensively and effectively in 1905-1913. Watercolors of those years allow us to speak of his early creative maturity; even then he developed as an outstanding artist, found his own themes and his own special intonation in art. His work testifies to his keen observation, the ability to convey his impressions vividly and convincingly. In sheets such as \"\" (1906), \"\" (1909), \"\" (1913) and many others, Gerasimov completely mastered the art of \"erasing random features\" from the depicted motif and revealing the poetic essence in it.\n\nThe nature of the selection of vital material and the chamber nature of images in early works talk about the artist's gravitation towards lyric art. He purposefully developed his own type of soulful - mood landscape and interior, chamber scene of everyday life and intimate portrait. He was worried about the topic of the Russian provinces: the Russian province found in him a remarkably deep and thoughtful depictor - a poet. WITH special attention and with sensitivity he looked closely at the undemanding beauty of rural nature, inseparable from the life of the common people.\n\nIn those years, Gerasimov saw folk life by no means idyllic: he noticed contrasts in it, a complex interweaving of joyful and everyday life. This is how she looks in his works \" Recruiting\"(1911),\" \"(1911).\n\nIn the early works of Gerasimov, the precious property of his art was fully manifested: they are all surprisingly Russian, not only in themes, but also in their attitude. And one more important quality is inherent in them: the purity of the lyrical intonation. The attitude of the young artist to the reproduced phenomenon as to something highly dear, evoking a deep personal feeling, and at the same time as to something common, national - this attitude is expressed in them with naturalness and artistic ease.\n\nIn terms of the depth of lyrical experience, the image of Russian nature, created by Gerasimov in watercolor \"\", is akin to the \"wind\" landscape in the poetry of Alexander Blok. The main thing in it is not external details, but a strong feeling for the Motherland, thinking about its \"beauty, tear-stained and ancient.\" The national note is heard here clearly, but expressed without any ethnographic accents in the plot.\n\nThe content of this sheet is characterized by an internal wholeness achieved by the organic fusion of landscape and genre - everyday images; and mentally they are inseparable, equally subordinate to a common artistic idea.\n\nIn search of a form adequate to the ideological and lyrical tasks, the master developed individual stylistic techniques. He recreated a lively and changeable image of the world around him, as a rule, in an impulsive free manner. A dynamic watercolor (sometimes with an admixture of white) brushstroke, endowed with color-tonal richness, made it possible to convey the world in constant development and movement. This is a typically Gerasimov painting, capable of capturing instant changes in nature, its most fragile states. In each motive, the artist was interested not in a static moment, but in a state understood as a process, as a life that lasts and pulsates before the eyes of the viewer - be it the life of the human spirit or the surrounding nature. The genre scene in watercolors \"\" (1906) has no developed action, but the whole is permeated with a quivering mood. Poetic perception of an ordinary fragment of rural reality here is largely achieved by the subtlest harmony of warm and cold colors, the richness, at first glance, of a modest color palette, in which silvery-gray shades prevail, as if melting about places of contact and transitions. Gerasimov continued the traditions of the Russian lyrical landscape, the traditions of A.K. Savrasov, I.I. Levitan, V.A. Serov, K.A. Korovin.\n\nLearned from K.A. Korovin's impressionistic principle of the equal existence of each separate object in a light-air environment is masterfully embodied in such things by Gerasimov as “ Mozhaisk rows\"(1908),\" Bazaar in Mozhai\"(1908),\" Fair\"(1908).\n\nIn graphics, which was an independent area of \\u200b\\u200binterest for Gerasimov in the initial period of his work, he was looking for contemporary themes, which he then developed in painting. IN \" Portrait of A.G. Gerasimova, the artist's wife\"(1913) translated into the language of painting and watercolor techniques: improvised fill, plastic hints. Form is created to a much greater extent by color than academic chiaroscuro. The illusion of an airy environment around the female figure is achieved by color.\n\nThe sketchy character of the letter turned out to be equivalent to the living and immediate characterization of the model. This is a kind of portrait of the mood. For all the artist's enthusiasm for pictorial effects, the image of a person in a portrait is not reduced to a self-sufficient pictorial and plastic phenomenon. He attracts attention with a psychologically profound understanding of the inner state of the depicted person.\n\nMilitary service since 1914 causes a rather long break in the artist's work. Gerasimov returns to active creative activity only after the Great October Socialist Revolution. In the first years of Soviet power, radical changes took place in his art. If in the pre-revolutionary time, filled with the search for an individual creative handwriting, Gerasimov was restrained, avoided extremes and throwing, did not enter into an internal dispute with himself, worked smoothly, developing in a calm ascending to ever higher skill and professionalism, now he re-evaluates previously acquired values ... This relatively short segment of Gerasimov's creative biography was a kind of period of storm and onslaught.\n\nTo the events of the revolutionary era, which radically transformed the entire social and emotional atmosphere in the country, he responded by changing the style, updating the already approved artistic techniques and the principles of shaping. He was influenced by aesthetics and artistic practice constructivism: so, in some works of the first post-October years, he deliberately exposes the process of plastic composition. Among them there were also such works in which the influence of folk art, in particular artistic primitiveness, was traced. Passion for the primitive touched in those years not only Gerasimov. Traces of this influence, as well as the influence of general searches related to the problems of monumental art and artistic synthesis, can be seen in the sketch of the panel \"\" (1918). Working on a panel intended to decorate the building of the former Moscow City Duma, Gerasimov took part in the implementation of Lenin's plan of monumental propaganda.\n\nThe figurative plane of the sketch was taken by the figure of a peasant, whose large and confident step symbolized the movement of the Russian village towards a new life. At the heart of the image, conveyed in the language of \"naive\" folk art, the feeling of a real prototype is preserved. The sketch showed Gerasimov's desire to create a monumental style of the revolutionary era. Experience in the field of monumental art helped him to further create artistic images, epic in breadth of coverage.\n\nThe desire to express the heroic and dramatic collisions of the era with the appropriate visual means led to the appearance in Gerasimov's art of a monumental and expressive beginning. But in parallel with this stylistic line in his work, there is further development and the enrichment of lyrical motives, to which he returned after plastic experiments. The lyrical and optimistic aspects of realism received new colors and emotional shades from the artist.\n\nIn those same years, work on a new topic for him acquired a fundamental importance for Gerasimov - self-portrait... In the Tretyakov Gallery, there are two paintings of him, executed in 1923 and 1929.\n\nThe basis of their content is determined by the idea of \\u200b\\u200bresponsibility imposed on the artist by the era of grandiose social changes. The whole system of ideological - figurative characteristics in both works indicates a deep sense of the author's involvement in the new time. The power of expression of this feeling is brought in them to the degree of concentration at which the individual is organically transformed into the typical, and therefore the image of the person being portrayed is perceived as the personification of the artist of the Soviet era.\n\nIn the 1920s portrait genre Gerasimov has undergone a noticeable evolution: the intimate chamber portrait is replaced by a portrait - a type. It reveals the new character of the Soviet people and significantly enlarges the internal scale of the images. It is to the typical images of Russian peasants that Gerasimov owes his fame as the greatest Soviet portrait painter. The most significant of these works: \"\", \"\". They summarize the fate of people that took shape in new historical conditions.\n\nThe hero of the portrait \"\" (1926) is a peasant, still dressed in a soldier's overcoat, who has just returned to a peaceful life.\n\nNewspaper reports give him a difficult thought about the peasant share, about the need to break the old way of village life. The personal and the public are intertwined in these reflections of the farmer, his fate is commensurate with the fate of the multimillion peasant Russia, reared by the revolution. Preserving all the characteristic features of his model, Gerasimov transforms the impression of it into a holistic, pictorial in nature image, marked by signs of capacious artistic generalization.\n\nThe search for the heroic in the everyday life of the Soviet village led Gerasimov to create a classic work of the era - “ Collective farm watchman\"(1933). This portrait takes us to the memorable years of collectivization and introduces one of the ordinary heroes of collective farm construction.\n\nThe feelings, thoughts and deeds of the depicted collective farmer were enlarged by the epoch itself, born of the awareness of the need for his modest work, an understanding of the importance of his contribution to the common cause. The artist has succeeded in a typical image soviet manwhose spiritual appearance and moral beauty were forged in the crucible of a great turning point, in the conditions of a new social reality. The image of this energetic person is visually activated by the dynamic manner of painting, the confident movement of a wide brush on the canvas. Striving for generalization, Gerasimov does not depict everyday trifles and particulars, he shows the figure of a peasant in close-up, in strong movement.\n\nIn a number of paintings from the 1920s to the 1930s, Gerasimov created a kind of group portraits of rural workers. These works are also interesting as pages of the history of the Soviet country. In the picture \"\" (1927), the spectator faces a seething with passions, many-sided peasant Russia, entering the threshold of a new life. The proletarian-communist throws a revolutionary slogan into this socially heterogeneous crowd, passionately and convincingly calls for a conscious reorganization of the world. In the center artistic research Gerasimov - the problem of self-determination and moral formation of the Russian peasantry in the first decade of Soviet power. In the depicted scene, the artist's real impressions are condensed: in the depiction of each character, a lot of inessential is discarded and, on the contrary, attention is focused on revealing the socially typical. For the sake of this kind of expressiveness, Gerasimov deliberately uses some of the possibilities of grotesque imagery. Due to this, the expressiveness of the characteristics increases, and the meaning of the depicted scene is, as it were, exposed and becomes clearly visible.\n\nFists - rich men with gloomy faces and lead - heavy looks hide behind the backs of the middle peasants and the poor. Among the latter, there are manifestations of enthusiasm and awakened belief in the possibility of a better life. It is in the images of these peasants that Gerasimov notes the shoots of a new consciousness. The acuity of artistic vision, deep knowledge of folk psychology helped him to mold outstanding characters. The era of radical restructuring of the peasant worldview found in Gerasimov an intelligent, historically sagacious interpreter. Along with the colorfulness of the social type in creating a tense image of the picture big role belongs to the dynamic development of the plot and the expressive drama of compositional construction. As if restraining himself, the artist balances the expressiveness of creative expression by appealing to soft colors.\n\nClose attention to the fate of the people should have awakened Gerasimov's interest in historical picture... In the 1930s, his first works of the historical and revolutionary genre appeared. In the sketch for his famous painting \"\" (1932), the deep drama of the figurative solution to the plot has already appeared. Depicting the scene of the farewell of the Red partisans with their dead comrade in arms, Gerasimov gives it an epic meaning, permeates with the harsh and lofty \"music of the revolution.\"\n\nThere is no hopelessness in her tragedy: it is a heroic tragedy that conveys to the viewer the courageous truth about the historical inevitability of revolutionary victims. The scene does not overwhelm with its content, does not make a depressing impression. Private episode from times civil war grew into collective image revolutionary era. The image of the event is freed from the power of details and genre everyday life. Ideologically - artistic design The work successfully correlates the pathetic nature of the style, achieved by the increased emotional intensity of plastic means and compositional construction.\n\nThe historical and revolutionary theme in Gerasimov's work organically develops images and themes that form the basis of plot compositions from folk life and, of course, portraits - paintings like “ Collective farm watchman».\n\nOne of the most significant works in creative heritage Gerasimov - painting \"\" (1928 - 1930). In it, he achieved that figurative completeness that gives rise to a feeling of universality, universality of content: somehow you forget that, by its formal characteristics, the picture is a work of the genre of everyday life. Indeed, the massive boat seems to be a pedestal for a multi-figured monument to the people of labor, and the scene of the dinner of a fishing artel is perceived as some significant event, endowed with almost universal meaning. An ordinary everyday situation is important for an artist as a reason for thinking about the moral beauty of labor, which is asserted as the basis of a harmonious and sustainable social life. Gerasimov focused his attention on stumpy human figures, endowing the images of fishermen with epic power. The artel acts here as the guardian of the high moral standards of the people's life.\n\nIt can be said about each of the characters: a person is strong and beautiful only by work. In their manner of behaving - sedately, unabashedly, with a sense of their own dignity - Gerasimov emphasized those facets of the national character that were polished by the centuries-old experience of the Russian people. To match the people - an epic landscape with a wide breath of river space. The reproduced scene is devoid of idealization: the characters are emphatically rude, brutal. Boldly sacrificing details, skillfully using the imaginative possibilities of restrained color, the artist finds a laconic, plastically accurate, monumental form.\n\nThe most famous work Gerasimov - painting \"\" (1937). This work of his fully met the requirements of the great style of the socialist era. The canvas depicts both festive table, right in the field, collective farmers honor the heroine of rural labor. She, with an order on her chest, sits in the center next to an elderly peasant woman and the chairman of the collective farm, who enthusiastically delivers a welcoming speech. Since the appearance of the picture at the All-Union art exhibition The \"Industry of Socialism\" was accompanied by constant success.\n\nThe secret of this popularity, again, lies not in the amusement of the narrative, but in the accentuation of the most essential aspects of Soviet life. Not a sluggish statement of well-known facts, but a poetic statement of the collective farm novo sounds in the figurative structure of the work. I would like to believe that any kind of social demagogy and desire to embellish reality were completely alien to its author. He was truthful in conveying the main essence and historical subtext of the event depicted.\n\nInextricably linked with ideological content paintings are its stylistic features. In order for the viewer to be imbued with the major atmosphere of a rural holiday, Gerasimov turns to plein air painting, creatively translates the lessons of impressionistic decorativeness. Ringing colors, multi-colored reflexes on the clothes and faces of collective farmers, a whole colorful symphony of glare on the tablecloth and on every object that came into the artist's field of vision, subtle overflows of warm and cold reflections - all this creates a picture of amazing beauty and entertainment. But the artist needs the colorful radiance of the canvas and the entire light-color element of the picture not as such, but for the internal filling of the scene with a certain content, for conveying the emotional uplift and freshness of the feelings of Soviet people. IN \" Collective farm holiday\"There is that thoroughness in expressing a socially significant idea, which, as a rule, was excluded from the arsenal of tasks of classical impressionism, which sought to recreate instant visual impressions. Being a programmatic work of Soviet art, \"\" has become for many generations of our artists a school of painting skills, an example of an innovative solution to a modern theme.\n\nIt is easy to see that in Gerasimov's plot-thematic works, the landscape is important not as a background, but as an organic, inalienable environment from a person. It is impossible to achieve such an impression if you do not deal with a clean landscape. For Gerasimov, starting from the first steps in art, landscape has always been a large and independent theme. In the field of landscape genre, the artist created a lot of aesthetically valuable and significant.\n\nNature in the image of Gerasimov evokes a feeling of calm balance and harmony; her innermost rhythms are inextricably linked with the rhythms mental life person. This does not mean that the emotional palette of Gerasimov, the landscape painter, is monotonous. He did not confine himself to only one refined lyrics. Some of his landscapes are imbued with romantic uplift and tension. Nevertheless, Gerasimov preferred various gradations of poetic and fragile manifestations of her inner life to dramatic states in nature. The virtuoso skill with which he reveals the chaste beauty of the modest and ordinary in nature, gives charm and deep content to the unpretentious motives of his works. Everything in them breathes with naturalness and attracts with the spontaneity of transferring the measured existence of nature. Gerasimov's worldview is not characterized by pessimism. In his landscapes, the inexhaustible mental health of the Russian person is expressed.\n\nThe geography of Gerasimov's landscape motives is extremely wide, but Central Russian nature has invariably remained his favorite theme. The city where the artist returned constantly was Mozhaisk. Here, in his native places, with which the artist has firmly grown together the idea of \\u200b\\u200bthe Motherland, of Russia. Gerasimov created his best landscapes. Their distinctive feature is the organic interweaving of local and national - Russian flavor. In the historical and artistic lexicon, the concept “ landscape by Sergei Gerasimov».\n\nFor the best works of this kind, such as \"\" (1929), \"\" (1936), \"\" (1939). \" Evening in the city\"(1940),\" \"(1940) and others, it is impossible to just look: they require careful scrutiny, you need to get used to them and listen for a long time to an almost physically perceptible rich sound palette - from barely discernible voices and rustles to incessantly - loud noise falling from wooden water dam.\n\n”(1939) - one of the most poetic creations of the artist. The figurative content of this masterpiece of the Soviet landscape painting perceived through the prism \" Winter dreams\"P.I. Tchaikovsky, \" Winter morning\"A.S. Pushkin and others lyric works Russian art, recreating a picture of winter nature. In the context of these associations, the national character of the landscape created by Gerasimov is especially clearly visible.\n\nIn a modest motif of a snow-covered village outskirts, in a gray day, the pristine silence of which is broken by the creak of sled runners and the barking barking of a dog, the artist noticed and revealed the qualities of Russian nature that we experience as something enduring, corresponding to the age-old ideas of our people about beauty and we have a deep and precious feeling of love for our country.\n\nThe color range of Gerasimov's landscape works is sophisticatedly complex, built on pure watercolor shades and the most delicate reflexes. All this melodic \"color music\" sounds, as a rule, within the general (in \" Winter\"- silver) tonality. In constant changes in color qualities, in the vibration of shimmering colors - one of the explanations for the amazing vitality of the appearance of nature in Gerasimov's paintings. They allow one to feel the continuity of the processes taking place in it, to experience its inner spirituality and to feel that “there is a soul in it, there is a language in it”.\n\nTwice, in 1935 and 1939, Gerasimov visited the Caucasus and wrote a cycle there landscapes... The most famous are those created in Kislovodsk.\n\nLike no one else before him, Gerasimov felt and captured the atmosphere of the resort town and the surrounding mountain landscapes. The invariable \"hero\" of the works of this cycle is the southern sun, flooding the streets crowded with bright light and intensifying the black-and-white and color contrasts... Despite his attachment to the Central Russian landscape, Gerasimov perfectly, with the spontaneity and penetration inherent in his art, conveyed the original beauty of southern nature.\n\nIndustrial landscapes occupy an important place in Gerasimov's creative heritage - images of a landscape transformed by the creative energy of the Soviet people. They appeared, as a rule, as a result of the artist's creative business trips to various construction sites of the first five-year plans. The properties of this kind of landscapes can be judged by the painting “ White Sea - Baltic Canal. Nadvoitsky knot\"(1933). Russian writer Mikhail Mikhailovich Prishvin, having visited this place before the revolution, called it the land of fearless birds. Now a completely different land opened before the artist - unrecognizably transformed. Gerasimov remains a lyricist in the industrial landscape.\n\nPanoramic coverage of a huge space, it would seem, excluded any intimate picture. However, this landscape, like other works similar to it, is psychological. For the artist, he is a form of thinking about the \"steps of the fathoms\" of the Soviet country, about Soviet people who economically habituate nature, which, as the artist shows, remains close and proportionate to man, despite the enormity of industrial invasions into it.\n\nDuring the Great Patriotic War Gerasimov's brush effectively served his people: in this heroic and difficult time for the country, he created the canvas \"\" (1943). It is dedicated to the feat of a Russian peasant woman, whose son, a partisan, is taken to be shot. A simple Russian woman boldly throws angry words of curse in the face of the fascist punisher. Ideologically - moral significance depicted scene lies in the nature of the collision of its two main participants, personifying two different, irreconcilable ideologies. The moral superiority of the woman - the mother over the executioner is shown with a degree of clarity that makes one recall the poster form: the declarative expression in art met the needs of wartime. The psychological completeness of the conflict gives visual persuasiveness to the main idea of \\u200b\\u200bthe work, which has absorbed a historically capacious content.\n\nIn characterizing the heroine, the artist proceeds from those high moral criteria that were the only acceptable for Soviet people in the harsh years of military trials: from the entire possible spectrum of a woman's feelings, he accentuates her feelings of civic duty and hatred of the enemy. The same categorical nature of moral assessments is due to the pamphlet acuteness in the depiction of the image of the fascist rapist. The smoke of conflagrations and the corpses of executed people, as well as a huge dark shadow falling from him and as if trampling on the Russian land, complement his characterization.\n\nThe image of a peasant woman in \" Partisan mothers”Embodied that unprecedented and unexpected for the invaders rise of national consciousness, which caused the mass heroism of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War. With all its figurative structure, the picture inspired the idea of \\u200b\\u200bthe impending victory of the Soviet people in their righteous struggle against fascism.\n\nIn 1941-1943 Gerasimov worked in Samarkand. The amount he accomplished during this period is surprising. In addition to painting \"\" he writes landscapes, creates extensive graphic series.\n\nAfter returning to Moscow, the artist makes a trip to the Ukrainian front, visits the newly liberated Iskov and Novgorod. Depicting the cities and monuments of ancient Russian architecture destroyed by the invaders, he raises his voice every time to an angry protest against the barbarism and savagery of the conquerors. At the same time, Gerasimov begins work on a historical canvas dedicated to the Pugachev uprising. It is known that historical genre in the era of the Great Patriotic War, it experienced its heyday, and not only in the visual arts, but also in literature, cinema, theater. Artists used history to serve today... Their works told about the heroic events of the past in order to maintain a sense of pride in their contemporaries for their Motherland and its freedom-loving people. The image of Pugachev captured Gerasimov's imagination for a long time. The artist returned to work on it later, in the 1950s. With this image, he linked his ideas about the origins of the love of freedom, from time immemorial inherent in the Russian character - that love of freedom, the heroic examples of which he observed during the war years. Watercolor \"\" (1943) introduces the artist into the world of these ideas and historical analogies.\n\nThroughout the war years, Gerasimov did not leave work on the lyrical landscape. In his love for his native nature, he drew moral and mental strengththat helped to withstand the ordeals of wartime. These landscapes were inspired by a deep affection for the motherland - a feeling that was experienced then with particular intensity. In the canvas \"\" (1945), written at the very end of the war, Gerasimov expressed the mood of joyful hopes, a premonition of the long-awaited victory.\n\nThe theme of the eternal renewal of spring nature is perceived here as an artistic analogy to the victory of life over death. A similar comparison of moral forces with the inexhaustible forces of Russian nature can be found in B.L. Pasternak, who wrote in the same, 1945:\n\n.. Spring breath of the homeland\n\nWashes away the trail of winter from space\n\nAnd black from tears are circled\n\nFrom the tear-stained eyes of the Slavs.\n\nFor the artist and poet, the spring revival of nature is consonant with the renewal of the feelings and moods of the Soviet people.\n\nThe freshness of the discovery of beauty in simple and everyday landscapes, sincerity and deep penetration are characteristic of a whole group of landscapes, which are performed by the artist in post-war period... Gerasimov likes to depict panoramic broad views... And, even reproducing a closed space, he appreciates breakthroughs in it into an alluring distance - whether it is a piece of sky in the gap of branches or a forest road that draws the gaze into the depths, as, for example, in his landscapes \" First greens\"(1954) and\" \"(1955).\n\nIn all these works, visual reliability in the depiction of nature is complicated and spiritualized by the transfer of her rich inner life. A tremulous admiration for the discreet beauty of a fragrant garden washed with spring rain is expressed in the painting \"\" (1955). At the sight of a wildly blooming lilac bush and reflections of the sky on the window pane of a country house, at the sight of wet greenery and the sun's rays breaking through the foliage, the viewer is given to experience the fullness of life and comprehend the inner connection that unites nature and man. Gerasimov glorifies in such landscapes the morally cleansing power contained in nature.\n\nA significant role in the creative practice of Gerasimov was played by the traditional for Russian fine arts theme “ The foreign world through the eyes of a Russian artist\". The Tretyakov Gallery contains works depicting the views of cities in Austria, Greece, Italy, Turkey. England.\n\nEndowed with a subtle ability to capture the originality of new places, Gerasimov wrote not their detailed \" portraits”, And shared with the audience the poetic feelings that they aroused in him.\n\nLove for nature found expression in Gerasimov's appeal to the genre of still life. Still life in the understanding of Gerasimov is not a \"staging\", but an image of a part of life. The artist's credo is especially clearly expressed in “ Bells\"(1940 - 1945), where plucked meadow flowers and the landscape spreading outside the window are combined into a picturesque whole, subordinate to a single life rhythm.\n\nGerasimov's art is imbued with inner integrity and completeness and gives rise to the idea of \\u200b\\u200ba single, progressive creative path in its development. Marked by originality, high professional culture and unique intonation, his works are included in the golden fund of fine arts.\n\nGerasimov Sergey Vasilievich (26 (14) .09.1885-20.04.1964) 2A\n\nPainter and graphic artist, watercolorist, illustrator.

He became interested in landscape in the 1930s. Following the precepts of the teachers, he chooses the outwardly unassuming motives of Russian nature as the object of the image. S.V. Gerasimov - a born colorist, knows how to appreciate and sonorous color combinations... In \"The Oath of the Siberian Partisans\" (1933, RM) he mastered the principles of the revolutionary propaganda \"thematic picture\". If this image is remembered for its harsh severity, then the famous \"Kolkhoz Holiday\" (1937, State Tretyakov Gallery) looks like a colorful scenic extravaganza, woven from separate \"juicy\" pieces. For the painting \"Collective Farm Holiday\" (1937) he was awarded a silver medal at the International Exhibition \"Art and Technology in Modern Life\" in Paris and a second degree diploma at the exhibition \"Industry of Socialism\". One of the most famous paintings about the war was Gerasimov's Mother of the Partisan (1943-1950, State Tretyakov Gallery).\n\nReal impressions of post-revolutionary upheavals and troubles pass through all creativity - in the repeated motives of the Luzhetsky monastery adjacent to his house, destroyed and barbarously devastated after its closure in 1926. In simple, lyrically-soulful landscapes (Mozhaisk Landscapes series, 1954, Tretyakov Gallery) pictorial impressionism Gerasimova expressed himself most organically.

Catalog exhibition.M., 1946.\n\nToday, admiring the paintings of Soviet artists, it is difficult to pass by the paintings that belong to the brush of Sergei Vasilyevich Gerasimov: they are, in fact, beautiful and expressive.\n\nSpeaking about the biography of this famous artist, it is necessary, of course, to start with the date and place of his birth: and S.V. Gerasimov September 14, 1885 in the city of Mozhaisk, which is now in the Moscow region. From an early age, Sergei Vasilyevich was drawn to drawing and sought to capture the world he saw on sheets of paper.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1907 he studied at the Art and Industrial School named after. G. Stroganov in Moscow. Then he continued his education at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, which he successfully completed in 1912. And at that time he was taught by such eminent artists as S. V. Ivanov and K. A. Korovin.\n\nThe revolution Gerasimov received enthusiastically and immediately directed his artistic talent to strengthen the Soviet regime: he was engaged in the design of revolutionary festivals that were held at that time in Moscow. The artist's work of that period was mainly limited to writing plots that were simple in composition - oil paintings mainly reflected monochrome portraits of men and women and landscapes that were simple in terms of emotional message.\n\nHowever, against this background, the paintings of Sergei Vasilyevich Gerasimov stand out, painted already in the post-revolutionary years, which have become a real asset of the country's art. So, in 1924, the artist paints a beautiful female portrait \"Peasant Woman with a Rooster\", which is now in the Russian Museum. Also his outstanding work was a portrait of a man - \"Front-line soldier\": today thousands of people admire this canvas, visiting the Tretyakov Gallery.\n\nAnalyzing the period of Gerasimov's work in the post-revolutionary years, one can see that his painting of the Soviet period reflects many genre scenes, mainly depicting a rural landscape and the difficult process of the formation of the peasantry in new Russia... The artist also turned a lot to historical and revolutionary themes: at the same time, his socialist realism appears in a monumental and epic plane. An example of such a work is the painting \"The Oath of the Siberian Partisans\", written by him in 1933, which is currently in the Russian Museum.\n\nSoviet painting of the 30s by Gerasimov reflects the general emotional upsurge of the people: his paintings are becoming more pompous and jubilant. In order to be convinced of this, it is worth looking at his painting \"The collective farm holiday\" (1937, Tretyakov Gallery). In the landscape painting of the artist an important place is occupied by the traditions of Russian plein air art. Wherein soviet artists and critics of that time recognized Sergei Gerasimov as one of the best Soviet landscape painters. Until now, looking at his paintings, one is struck by their wonderful poetry, subtle sense of nature, freshness of color solutions.\n\nIt was at that time that he painted pictures that are now in the Tretyakov Gallery: \"Winter\" (1939), \"The Ice Has Gone\" (1945), the series \"Mozhaisk Landscapes\", \"Oats\" and \"At the Ferry\" (1954 g.). Also during the Great Patriotic War, the master creates a painting \"Mother of the Partisan\" (1943, Tretyakov Gallery) breathing with patriotic pathos.\n\nIn the post-war period, Gerasimov painted many thematic paintings, of which the most significant is the painting \"For the Power of the Soviets\", written in 1957 and also located today in the Tretyakov Gallery. In addition, at that time Sergei Vasilyevich drew illustrations for the books of A.M. Gorky, N.A.Nekrasov and others, was engaged in teaching activities. In 1958 Gerasimov becomes folk artist USSR, and in 1966 he posthumously received the Lenin Prize.\n\nApril 20, 1964 soviet painter Sergei Vasilievich Gerasimov died: he died in Moscow. However, his paintings survived the author and still delight people with their beauty and truthfulness.\n\nIrina Alekseeva\n\nFrom the site \"Soviet Painting\""
