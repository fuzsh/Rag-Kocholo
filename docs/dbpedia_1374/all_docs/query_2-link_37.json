This directory covers the thirteen countries in which the Communist party is in power--that is, the usual twelve of the Communist bloc plus Yugoslavia. The directory is arranged alphabetically by country and, under each country, the organizations appear in alphabetical sequence within three general cate- gories, as follows: nationally oriented roof organizations (such as the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries) are discussed first; regionally oriented organizations (such as the Armenian Society for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries or the Soviet Association of Friendship with the Peoples of Africa) are covered next; and nation-to-nation bilateral organizations (such as the USSR-Japan Society) appear last. Throughout the directory the most recent date of information appears in a parenthesis. Known members of the local Communist party are marked by an asterisk. Double asterisks indicate known members of the central committee of the Communist party or persons known to be members of an organ of the central committee.

So far, the chief of only one such section is known: Japan Seation Chief (1958) LIU Po-kang (0491/0130/0474) Provincial Branches The ACRFC maintains branches in each of the provinces. Branches are apparently also maintained in certain cities.

Publications: A Russian-language fortnightly journal titled Druzhba (Friendship) which was founded on 15 April 1955. Beginning with a circulation of 2,000, by 1956 this figure had reached 57,000 and it was planned that circulation would increase to 67,000 in May 1956. Recent information reflects that the publication was closed down as a result of the Sino-Soviet ideological altercations. In 1956 its chief editor was one MN Lang (2651/2728), Although the text for Druzhba was prepared in Peiping, the Russian-language edition was primarily circulated in the Soviet Ubion through the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Society which printed it in Moscow for the Chinese. Similarly a Chinese-language publication of the same name (?u-chung Yu-hao) was printed and distributed in China from a test prepared in Moscow. e. Remarks; China-Vietnam Friendship Association a.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA Czechoslovak Institute for Contacts with Abroad (Ceskoslovensky Ustav pro Styky se Zahranicim) a. Date established: Early 1959 b. Address: b. Officers: Director (Dr) Vladimir KAIGL* Foreign Schools The so-called foreign schools in Czechoslovakia for students from Africa and Asia (those not connected with the Czech Com- munist Party (KSC) or with the trade unions) are reported to be under the jurisdiction of the Institute for Contacts with Abroad. Special Department for Relations with Czech Citizens Living Abroad (Oddeleni pro Styky s Krajany a Krajanskymi Organiza- cemi v Zahranici) (otherwise known as the Czech Foreign Institute Address - Karmelitska 25, Prague. Chairman (196a Secy Gen (1960) Marie TROZANOVA Karel OLIVA, This department handles relations with Czech citizens who live abroad or with foreigners of Czech or Slovak descent, and maintains contacts with their national organizations. It was earlier believed that the Czech Foreign Institute had been completely submerged within the Institute for Contacts with Abroad. It appears now, however, that the CFI retains a degree of autonomy. It is still listed by name and address in the Prague telephone directory. The CFI's activities ' appear to be under the direction and guidance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Publications: Ceskoslovensko Svet (Czech World) This is a weekly newspaper which bears the legend \"Weekly of the Czechoslovak Foreign Institute\" and thus would seem to be directed primarily at Czechs living abroad. e. Remarks: The Institute for Contacts with Abroad is said to be directly under the control of the Foreign Department of the Central Committee of the KSC, and is also under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Trade which subsidize it. It has been reported that the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Interior is in close contact with the Institute and also has some control over its activi- ties. The Institute for Contacts with Abroad concerns itself with all international conferences and events which have no official or state character, but in which Czechoslovakia and especially the ESC have an interest. These (vents and confer- ences are those in which no official state organ or its missions abroad may become involved. The primary task of the Institute for Contacts with Abroad is the care of official or private persons (with the exception of those invited by the government) who have been asked to come to Chechoslovakia and in whom the Czechs have an interest. Czechoslovakia-China Friendship Association a. Date established: Sometime in 1953, all sinology students in Prague were informed that they were automatically members of the Czech-ChinOse Friendship Association, which was said to be connected with the Oriental Institute. Few of the students paid dues, however, and they did not know whether this asso- ciation really functioned or merely existed on paper. b. Address: Prague. c. Officers: d. Publications: e.

Date established: An association of Friends of the Soviet Union (Svaz pratel SSSR Uhion) was established by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1933. It was a small organization with a headquarters in Prague and a few branches in major cities. After almost six years of inactivity during World War II, the association was revived in 1945. At the same time a new organization, the Society for Cultural Cooperation with the Soviet Union (Spolecnost pro kulturni styky se SSSR) was established. The two organizations merged after February 1948 to create the present Society. b. Address: The headquarters of the Central Committee (Ustredni Vybor) of the SCSP is in a five-story building at Smetanovo nabrezi 18, Prague. A headquarters for Slovakia, Slovensky Vybor SCSP, is at Tolsteho ulice 3, Bratislava. Branches of the Society exist in every region (kraj) and district (okres). In addition to the headquarters of the society, Prague has a regional committee for the Prague Region and a city com- mittee for the city itself. Both of these cOmmittees have offices at Vaclavske namesti 36, Prague. Every district with- in the Prague Region has a committee, the addresses of which are listed in the Prague telephone book. The SCSP also has committees in industrial installations, commercial enterprises, government offices, schools, housing developments, etc. c. Officers: As of 1960 the SCSP was the second largest mass organization in Czechoslovakia with about 2,100,000 members, who made up 20 regional, 297 district, and about 22,000 local units. The society has two types of employees: a permanent staff of paid employees and unpaid workers.
