        "text": "THIS PAGE IS STILL VERY INCOMPLETE.\n\nIT WILL BE UPDATED, RE-STRUCTURED AND IMPROVED OVER TIME.\n\nNote: I realize this page describes many scientists also from the pre-revolutionary period. This is because progressive, revolutionary, democratic and materialist scientists from the pre-revolutionary period served as the inspiration and foundation for Soviet scientists. Countless great scientists worked in pre-revolutionary Russia, but they faced persecution or did not receive necessary support. Many great scientists such as K. A. Timiryazev became communists and others like I. P. Pavlov and V. I. Vernadsky supported the revolutionary democrats, and read their works. Still others did not delve into politics, but supported materialist views through their scientific work.\n\n“Only conscious organisation of social production, in which production and distribution are carried on in a planned way, can lift mankind above the rest of the animal world as regards the social aspect, in the same way that production in general has done this for men in their aspect as species. Historical evolution makes such an organisation daily more indispensable, but also with every day more possible. From it will date a new epoch of history, in which mankind itself, and with mankind all branches of its activity, and especially natural science, will experience an advance that will put everything preceding it in the deepest shade.” (Friedrich Engels, Dialectics of Nature)\n\n“no natural science and no materialism can hold its own in the struggle against the onslaught of bourgeois ideas and the restoration of the bourgeois world outlook unless it stands on solid philosophical ground. In order to hold his own in this struggle and carry it to a victorious finish, the natural scientist must be a modern materialist, a conscious adherent of the materialism represented by Marx, i.e., he must be a dialectical materialist.” (Lenin, On the Significance of Militant Materialism)\n\n“To expect science to be impartial in a wage-slave society is as foolishly naïve as to expect impartiality from manufacturers on the question of whether workers’ wages ought not to be increased by decreasing the profits of capital.” (Lenin, The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism)\n\n“Contrary to idealism, which denies the possibility of knowing the world and its laws, which does not believe in the authenticity of our knowledge, does not recognize objective truth, and holds that the world is full of “things-in-themselves” that can never be known to science, Marxist philosophical materialism holds that the world and its laws are fully knowable, that our knowledge of the laws of nature, tested by experiment and practice, is authentic knowledge having the validity of objective truth, and that there are no things in the world which are unknowable, but only things which are as yet not known, but which will be disclosed and made known by the efforts of science and practice.” (Stalin, Dialectical and historical materialism)\n\nSCIENCE OF THE SOVIET UNION\n\nSoviet science was rooted in the progressive materialist traditions of Russia and the world. Materialist philosophy and natural science in Russia begins in the 18th century with M. V. Lomonosov (1711-1765), the son of a peasant, who contributed to all fields of science and also to poetry and literature. The materialist trend in philosophy was continued by the writer A. N. Radischev (1749-1802), who brought it to the 19th century.\n\nIn the 19th century the great revolutionary democrats N. G. Chernyshevsky (1828-1889), V. G. Belinsky (1811-1848), A. I. Herzen (1812-1870) and others spread revolutionary socialism, materialist and dialectical philosophy in the Russian empire. They achieved the highest peak of philosophical development in the pre-marxist period, though not fully reaching scientific socialism or dialectical materialism. Many revolutionary democrats were philosophers and art critics, but N. A. Dobrolyubov (1836-1861) also contributed to the theory of pedagogy while D. I. Pisarev (1840-1868) can be credited with bringing darwinism to Russia.\n\nIn the 19th century progressive scientists in the Russian empire participated in the democratic revolutionary movement in the ranks of socialists (A. N. Bakh and others), condemned tsarism (I. P. Pavlov, V. I. Vernadsky, A. G. Stoletov and countless others), and others, without necessarily taking part in open politics, fought in favor of materialist philosophy and science despite persecution (I. M. Sechenov, I. I. Mechnikov, N. A. Umov, brothers A. O. and V. O. Kovalevsky etc.).\n\nIn biology the progressive trend was characterized by the darwinists. Contrary to many western bourgeois darwinists, progressive darwinists in the Russian empire condemned reactionary malthusianism (K. A. Timiryazev, D. I. Pisarev etc.) and later reactionary weismannism-mendelism (K. A. Timiryazev, I. V. Michurin, I. P. Pavlov etc.). In the Soviet period this developed to Soviet creative darwinism and Michurin agrobiology.\n\nRussia was the foremost country in soil-science. The pre-revolutionary materialist scientists V. V. Dokuchaev and P. A. Kostychev are the founders of modern soil-science. Their materialist theories inspired the great Soviet agricultural ecologist V. R. Williams, the great Soviet geo-bio-chemist V. I. Vernadsky and the great Soviet biologist T. D. Lysenko, laying the basis for the Lysenko-Williams doctrine and the Stalin plan for the transformation of nature.\n\nIn physiology and psychology, I. M. Sechenov (1829-1905) developed a materialist theory explaining the emergence of consciousness in his book “Reflexes of the Brain”. As a result he was prosecuted by the tsarist government. His work was further developed by the great physiologist I. P. Pavlov, who laid the basis for the dialectical-materialist understanding of physiology and psychology.\n\nThe pre-revolutionary chemist A. M. Butlerov (1828-1886) developed a materialist model of the structure of chemistry. D. I. Mendeleev (1834-1907) developed the periodic table of elements, demonstrating the transformation of quantity into quality in chemistry. His discovery was highly praised by Marx and Engels.\n\nA. G. Stoletov (1839-1896), P. N. Lebedev (1866-1912), N. A. Umov (1846-1915) and others pioneered a materialist model of physics.\n\nMaterialist epidemiology was pioneered by D. S. Samoilovich (1744-1805) despite receiving absolutely no support from the tsarist regime, which allowed his discoveries to fall into obscurity. N. I. Pirogov (1810-1881) developed materialism in medicine and supported democratic reforms. Nobel prize winner I. I. Mechnikov (1845-1916) discovered phagocytes. In the late 19th century G. N. Minkh, V. K. Vysokovich and others also worked on disease prevention. Their work was further continued by their colleagues, revolutionaries and Soviet scientists N. F. Gamaleya, who developed successful anti-cholera vaccines and D. K. Zabolotny who carried out expeditions to Asia discovering the sources of various global pandemics.\n\nThe first vaccine against the plague was developed by student of Mechnikov, Soviet scientist Vladimir Khavkin (1860-1930) and the first successful anti-plague vaccine applied on a vast scale was developed by Soviet scientist M. P. Pokrovskaya in (1934).\n\nIn the Russian empire there had been countless great scientists who made tremendous advances, despite getting no support from the government and being hindered by tsarism. N. I. Lobachevsky (1792-1856) discovered non-euclidian geometry, but his discovery was not appreciated at the time. A. S. Popov (1859-1906) invented the first radio simultaneously with the Italian Marconi. A. F. Mozhaisky (1825-1890) developed a working aircraft in the 1880s (the so-called “first airplane in the world” by the Wright brothers was built in 1903). N. A. Teleshov (1828-1895) invented one of the first jet aircrafts. P. N. Yablochkov (1847-1894) invented an early carbon arc lamp, but due to lack of customers in Russia he was forced to emigrate to France. A. N. Lodygin invented the light bulb before Thomas Edison, but due to persecution for his support of revolutionary socialism, he had to emigrate to the US in 1884.\n\nBecause of tsarism the discoveries of Russian scientists remained unknown, or were covered up by western imperialist propaganda and forgotten.\n\nDue to lack of funding in Russia I. I. Mechnikov and countless other scientific workers had to study abroad, usually in France. Mechnikov emigrated to France permanently. Women were not allowed into universities in the Russian empire. The outstanding mathematician, the first woman in the world to receive a scientific doctorate, S. V. Kovalevskaya (1850-1891) had to study in Germany and teach in Sweden, as she was explicitly forbidden to work in tsarist Russia by the government. One of the first female chemists in the world, Y. V. Lermontova (1846-1919) also had to study in Germany and despite receiving support from progressive Russian scientists (A. M. Butlerov, V. V. Markovnikov, I. M. Sechenov etc.) she retired from science once she returned to the Russian empire.\n\nIn the Soviet period all the neglected pre-revolutionary scientists began to receive tremendous government support. The outstanding biologists K. A. Timiryazev and I. V. Michurin praised the October Revolution. Despite his initial doubts, I. P. Pavlov also praised the Soviet government for its generous support for science and for its attempt to build a better society. The pioneer of rocketry K. E. Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935), who had received only neglect and repression from tsarism, also began receiving support from the Soviet government.\n\nSoviet science achieved the highest level in the world.\n\nModern geochemistry was founded by Soviet scientists Stalin Prize winner V. I. Vernadsky and A. Fersman. Based on the work of Dokuchaev and Kostychev, Vernadsky developed the concept of the biosphere, understanding it as a dialectically evolving whole. Soviet chemists rejected the agnostic and idealistic resonance theory and further developed the materialist understanding of A. M. Butlerov.\n\nSoviet physics was also the most advanced in the world. Order of Lenin recipient E. E. Fedorov developed the principles of complex meteorology in the 1920s. In the 1930s Stalin Prize winners K. A. Petrzhak and G. N. Flerov discovered nuclear fission in nature. The first nuclear power plant in the world was built in the USSR in 1951. The USSR had countless outstanding physicists: A. F. Ioffe, Y. I. Frenkel, V. A. Fok, L. I. Mandelstam, D. D. Ivanenko, D. V. Skobeltsyn, A. I. Leipunsky, N. S. Akulov and others, the participants of the nuclear weapons program, Stalin Prize and Nobel Prize winners I. Y. Tamm, P. A. Cherenkov, I. M. Frank and Stalin Prize winner I. V. Kurchatov.\n\nSoviet scientists rejected idealistic interpretations of Einstein’s theory of relativity and quantum physics. They developed dialectical materialist interpretations of these theories, and while they remain incomplete, they represent the highest stage that physics has ever achieved in this realm, as bourgeois physics has ended up in a total dead end.\n\nSoviet astronomers debunked all supernatural explanations for the creation of the world. The only scientific cosmogonic trend was created in the USSR. The great Soviet scientist explorer Otto Schmidt developed the first (though still somewhat limited) materialist theory of the origin of our planet. Stalin Prize winner V. A. Ambartsumyan developed the scientific theory about the origin of stars. Soviet astronomers rejected the bourgeois notion that new matter is created by an expanding universe, which violates the law of the conservation of energy. Soviet astronomers also rejected the pseudo-scientific notion of a heat-death and various theories about the end of the world, which all are mere attempts to demonstrate the divine creation of the world.\n\nThe Soviet Union was the leading power in space research. It achieved the world’s first space satellite (Sputnik-1 in 1957) and sent the first human into space (Yuri Gagarin in 1961). The basis for Soviet satellites and rocketry was created in the Stalin era by followers of Tsiolkovsky: V. P. Gluschko, S. P. Korolev, D. I. Blokhintsev and others. World class airplanes were developed by A. N. Tupolev (Tupolev planes), A. G. Brunov (Mig-15 etc.) and others.\n\nIn biology the most advanced Michurinist agrobiology and creative darwinism was developed, together with the ground-breaking new cell theory of Stalin Prize winner O. B. Lepeshinskaya, which demonstrated the origin of cells from simpler non-cellular living matter. Michurinist, Stalin Prize winner A. I. Oparin developed the materialist theory about the origin of life (“primordial soup”). Based on a truly materialist understanding of heredity, revolutionary agricultural methods and new superior varieties were developed by Stalin Prize winner T. D. Lysenko and his comrades. N. V. Tsitsin also received the Stalin Prize in 1943 for his creation of a drought resistant perennial wheat. Tremendous agrotechnical developments were made by Stalin Prize winner T. S. Maltsev and other innovators.\n\nIn Soviet physiology the only scientific trend, that of Pavlov, became dominant. In his life-time Pavlov received tremendous support from the Soviet government and his work was continued by K. M. Bykov, A. G. Ivanov-Smolensky and others. Pavlov’s ideas were also developed in medicine and biology together with Michurinism.\n\nThe basis of all scientific psychology is the research of materialist scientists, the writings of Marx and Lenin on consciousness. However, the writings of Engels on evolution, and those of Stalin on linguistics, together with Pavlov’s theory of the second signaling system, finally helped solve the remaining problems for the creation of a consistently scientific school of psychology in the early 1950s.\n\nThe Stalin-era USSR was also a leading world power in computer technology. The first electronic computer in Europe, the Soviet MESM, became operational in 1950. Its successor BESM-1 went into operation in 1952 and was the fastest computer in Europe.\n\nM. V. LOMONOSOV (1711-1765) (polymath, universal genius)\n\nMikhail Lomonosov lived long before the Soviet Union, but deserves mention because he was recognized as the greatest Russian scientist in history. Lomonosov was a universal genius, contributing to practically every field of science: chemistry, biology, physics, minerology, optics, astronomy, as well as history, art and linguistics. He founded modern geology and influenced the formation of the modern Russian written language. Among his discoveries were the atmosphere of Venus and the conservation of mass in chemical reactions. His work was profoundly materialistic. Lomonosov came from a peasant family and originated materialist philosophy in Russia. He was also the first significant Russian scientist. His scientific and philosophical ideas were not recognized in his own day.\n\nIn 1940 the Moscow State University (which Lomonosov had founded) was renamed to Lomonosov University.\n\nThe great Soviet geologist A. Fersman said about Lomonosov:\n\n“Dozens of books and hundreds of articles were written about Lomonosov; the most prominent investigators, scientists, writers and poets devoted their best pages to the analysis of this giant of Russian thought and it is still impossible to exhaust this subject, because the genius of Mikhail Lomonosov, this Arkhangelsk pomor was so great and profound…\n\nCourage, resolve and daring bordering on stormy fantasy, a thirst to know everything, down to the root of things and to the source of all sources, and a capacity for profound philosophical analysis in combination with a brilliant ability to conduct experiments, without which he could not think of science, were some of Lomonosov’s traits. And whereas seven cities of antiquity debated the honour of keeping Homer’s grave, more than a dozen different sciences and arts arc lighting for the main heritage’ of Lomonosov: physics and chemistry, mineralogy and crystallography, geochemistry and physical chemistry, geology and mining, geography and meteorology, astronomy and astrophysics, regional science and economics, history, literature, philology and engineering. To be sure, Lomonosov was, as Pushkin was wont to say: a “whole university’’ in himself.” (A. Fersman, Geochemistry for everyone, pp. 347-348)\n\n“Geochemistry for everyone” by A. Fersman contains information on Lomonosov’s work on chemistry, geology, minerology etc. especially the chapter “From the history of chemical ideas”.\n\n“Lomonosov, Mikhail Vasilyevich (1711-1765). Lomonosov was a great Russian scientist, poet, founder of materialistic philosophy and natural science in Russia. The son of a peasant-Pomor from the village of Denisovka, near Kholmogory, Arkhangelsk province. Lomonosov from an early age passionately strived for knowledge. In 1730 he left for Moscow and, having overcome many difficulties associated with his peasant origin, entered the Slavic-Greek-Latin Academy there. In 1735 he was sent to the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, and after a while abroad, from where he returned in 1741. The Academy of Sciences with its foreign dominance did not recognize Lomonosov as a scientist for a long time. Only in 1745 he was approved as professor of chemistry.\n\nThe materialist tradition in the development of advanced Russian philosophy and science originates from Lomonosov. Lomonosov’s scientific activity was distinguished by its versatility. Lomonosov’s achievements in the field of chemistry and physics are especially significant. Lomonosov’s great scientific feat is the discovery of the law of conservation of matter and motion as a universal natural law and its theoretical and experimental substantiation. Already in his first natural-scientific works, Lomonosov comes to the conclusion about the constancy of matter and motion. Lomonosov gave a detailed substantiation of the law he discovered in 1748: “All changes occurring in nature occur in such a way that as much as is added to what is added, the same amount is subtracted from the other. So, as much substance as is added to one body, the same amount is taken away from another … This law of nature is so universal that it also extends to the rules of motion.” Later, Lomonosov substantiated this law in the work “Discourse on the hardness and fluidity of bodies” and in other works. The law of conservation of matter is rightfully called the Lomonosov Law. Lomonosov proved this law experimentally by weighing substances before and after a chemical reaction. Lomonosov’s position on the conservation of motion was confirmed in the concrete form of the law of conservation of energy after almost a hundred years. Thus, Lomonosov has priority in discovering the universal law of conservation of matter and motion, which lies at the foundation of modern natural science, especially physics and chemistry. Justifying the proposition about the non-destructibility and non-creation of matter and motion, Lomonosov thereby defended the indissolubility of matter and motion. The law of conservation of matter and motion Lomonosov came to the motion of particles of matter.\n\nLomonosov is the founder of chemical atomistics, revealing the atomic-molecular structure of matter. He believed that “corpuscles” (molecules) are composed of the smallest particles – “elements” (atoms). “Corpuscles,” wrote Lomonosov, “are homogeneous if they consist of the same number of the same elements connected in the same way … dissimilar when their elements are different and connected in different ways or in different numbers; the infinite variety of bodies depends on it.” Lomonosov’s understanding of heat as a mechanical motion of “corpuscles” is based on the law of conservation of motion. In Reflections on the Elastic Force of Air, Lomonosov developed the theory of the structure of air on the basis of molecular-kinetic concepts that played a huge role in the further development of science. Lomonosov resolutely fought against anti-scientific views, which in the 18th century. dominated in natural science, for example, against the metaphysical concept of “caloric.”\n\nIn Reflections on the Cause of Heat and Cold, Lomonosov wrote that “there is a sufficient basis for heat in motion. And since motion cannot occur without matter, it is necessary that a sufficient basis for heat lies in the motion of some matter.” Lomonosov expresses ingenious ideas that various natural phenomena are caused by different forms of motion of matter. Lomonosov laid the foundation for a completely new science – physical chemistry, linking physical theories and research methods with the solution of chemical problems. Lomonosov paid considerable attention to the development of the mining and metallurgical business. In the field of geology, he first put forward the idea of development.\n\nHe investigated the wealth of the subsoil of Russia, found out the conditions of navigation along the Northern Sea Route. A supporter of the heliocentric theory in astronomy, the multitude of worlds and the infinity of the universe, Lomonosov was the first to discover the air atmosphere around Venus and, in opposition to the teachings of the church, admitted the possibility of life on other planets. He basically correctly explained the causes of climate change on earth, the presence in the North in the frozen layers of the earth of the remains of animals and plants that are not characteristic of the conditions of the North. Lomonosov predicted that at high air densities, deviations from the Boyle-Mariotte law should be found. Lomonosov was the first to introduce in chemistry the method of quantitative (weight) reception as a systematic method of research, and invented a number of instruments for use in navigation, meteorology, geodesy, physics, chemistry, etc.\n\nLomonosov solved the main question of philosophy materialistically. With his research, he made a breach in the metaphysical worldview that prevailed at the time; on a number of issues Lomonosov pursued the idea of development. At the same time, due to the limited knowledge of that time, he considered mainly mechanical laws and properties of nature. He considered the main properties of matter to be extension, force of inertia, impenetrability, mechanical motion. Lomonosov contrasted the materialistic view of atoms to the idealistic monadology of Leibniz, which he sharply criticized. Rejecting Leibniz’s spiritual monads, Lomonosov called corpuscles “physical monads.”\n\nLomonosov’s views contain elements of dialectics. He already considers the world around us as constantly changing and developing. In his work “On the Layers of the Earth,” he talks about the changes and evolutionary development of the plant and animal kingdoms, puts forward a bold theory about the plant origin of peat, coal, oil, amber, an evolutionary theory of the origin of soils. Lomonosov considered motion as “eternally” existing. In his work “On the heaviness of bodies and on the eternity of the primary movement,” he writes: “… the primary movement can never have a beginning, but must last forever.”\n\nLomonosov developed a materialistic theory of knowledge. He proceeded from the fact that the source of knowledge is the external world, which affects the human senses. He was a staunch opponent of the Cartesian idealist theory of “innate ideas” and Locke’s “inner experience.” Lomonosov spoke in favor of combining experimental data with theoretical conclusions. He condemned those who divorced cognition by reason from sensory perceptions, who metaphysically opposed synthesis to analysis. In the theory of knowledge, Lomonosov assigned a large place to experience, understanding the latter in a narrow sense, in the sense of a scientific experiment and sensory perception of objective reality. Lomonosov sharply criticized the idealist theory of the so-called “secondary qualities,” arguing that “secondary qualities” exist as objectively as primary ones.\n\n“With Lomonosov,” wrote Belinsky, “our literature begins.” Lomonosov was the founder of Russian grammar. Thanks to Lomonosov, a new grammar based on living Russian speech came to replace the dead, scholastic schemes of the old grammar. As a poet, Lomonosov performed primarily with poems in which he called for the development of the arts and sciences in Russia, for the spread of Enlightenment among the Russian people.\n\nFor a number of years, Lomonosov waged a stubborn struggle for the creation of domestic science, he did a lot for the development of natural science in Russia, for combining advanced science with practical tasks. Lomonosov was the first Russian scientist to receive the title of Academician. He was the founder of Moscow University (1755) and advocated the transformation of the Academy of Sciences. Lomonosov fought against the clergy, sharply castigating the ignorance of the priests. As a historian, as a patriot, he fought against the distortions of Russian history and against the dominance of the reactionary “German party” in the Academy of Sciences. Lomonosov loved his people dearly; he believed in the great future of the Russian people. The last edition of Selected Philosophical Works of M. V. Lomonosov was published in 1950.” (Pavel Yudin and Mark Rosenthal, Short Philosophical Dictionary, 5th ed., 1954)\n\nA. N. RADISHCHEV (1749-1802)\n\nAlexander Radishchev was a revolutionary democrat, materialist, writer. His most famous work is “Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow”.\n\n“Is a sense of national pride alien to us, Great-Russian class-conscious proletarians? Certainly not! We love our language and our country, and we are doing our very utmost to raise her toiling masses (i.e., nine-tenths of her population) to the level of a democratic and socialist consciousness. To us it is most painful to see and feel the outrages, the oppression and the humiliation our fair country suffers at the hands of the tsar’s butchers, the nobles and the capitalists. We take pride in the resistance to these outrages put up from our midst, from the Great Russians; in that midst having produced Radishchev, the Decembrists and the revolutionary commoners of the seventies; in the Great-Russian working class having created, in 1905, a mighty revolutionary party of the masses; and in the Great-Russian peasantry having begun to turn towards democracy and set about overthrowing the clergy and the landed proprietors.” (Lenin, On the National Pride of the Great Russians)\n\n“The initiator of the revolutionary-democratic trend in Russian social thought, A.N. Radishchev (1749-1802), was an outstanding economist of his time. Radishchev, resolutely attacking serfdom and defending the oppressed peasantry, made an annihilating criticism of the serf-owning system, exposed the exploiting nature of the wealth of the landlords and serf-owners, the owners of manufactories and traders and justified the right to ownership of land of those who worked it with their labour. Radishchev was firmly convinced that the autocracy and serfdom could be liquidated only by revolutionary means. He worked out a system of economic measures which were progressive for, his time, and the realisation of which would have secured Russia s advance to a bourgeois democratic system.” (POLITICAL ECONOMY A Textbook issued by the Economics Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R)\n\n“Radishchev, Aleksandr Nikolayevich (1749-1802). Radishchev was the founder of revolutionary emancipatory thought in Russia, the founder of Russian revolutionary literature. The development of revolutionary and emancipatory thought in Russia was closely connected with those heroic traditions that Radishchev laid the foundation for. Lenin highly appreciated the merits of Radishchev as a thinker and revolutionary leader, as a fighter against serfdom and Tsarist despotism.\n\nIn the era of Radishchev, serfdom in the most cruel forms raged in Russia. Having suppressed the Pugachev revolt, the frightened government of Catherine II fell upon the peasants with new punitive measures, new fierce decrees that intensified the already unbearable serfdom. The peasantry responded with new revolts. The question of the struggle against serfdom arose before the best, progressive people in all its acuteness. Radishchev did not remain a calm observer of this unbridled arbitrariness and violence against the people, he raised his voice of protest against serfdom and autocracy.\n\nA striking evidence of this is his famous book “Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow” (1790), published in Radishchev’s own printing house and published anonymously. For Russia at that time, the publication of the book “Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow” was like a thunderclap. Its creation and publication was a heroic deed of a revolutionary. In his book, Radishchev masterfully depicts the horrors of serfdom, the oppressed position of the Russian working people – the breadwinners of society, the producers of all the wealth of the country.\n\nIn condemning the flagrant arbitrariness of the serf-owners, Radishchev reaches deep political conclusions; he sees the root of evil not in individuals or violations of the law, but in the law itself, in the serf system, in the autocracy. Catherine II ordered the arrest of the author and a severe reprisal against him. He was sent to the prison of Ilimsk in Siberia “for ten years of hopeless stay.” But neither prison, nor the threat of execution, nor exile broke the freedom-loving spirit of Radishchev. In Siberia, Radishchev wrote the famous philosophical treatise “On Man, his Mortality and Immortality,” taking on the struggle of a materialist, resolutely opposing idealism and mysticism.\n\nAfter the death of Catherine II, Radishchev’s friends achieved his return from Siberia. They even managed to include him in the commission for drafting laws. But this did not change Radishchev’s attitude to serfdom and autocracy. He kept aloof, still sharply opposed arbitrariness and put forward projects for a radical change in the state system, thus inciting the serf-owners against him. He was threatened by a new arrest. Hounded by the Tsar’s servants, Radishchev committed suicide. Before his death, he said: “The offspring will avenge me.”\n\nThe first noble revolutionary Alexander Nikolaevich Radishchev was an outstanding thinker of his time, an artist of words, a philosopher and an economist. Together with Lomonosov he is rightfully considered the founder of Russian materialist philosophy. His materialism is remarkable for its revolutionary content, a protest against serfdom and Tsarism. Speaking out against the idealism and mysticism of the Masons, against their reactionary views, Radishchev argued the primacy of matter, arguing that the brain is a material organ of thought. In his views on matter, he as a whole did not go, and even could not at that time go beyond the metaphysical concepts of the 18th century.\n\nBut the idea of development is already noticeably making itself felt in his deep reasoning. He looked at motion as an inalienable property of matter. He criticizes the idealistic theory of preformism (Haller and Bonnet) as pseudo-scientific, as a product of idle fantasy, as well as the doctrine of “entelechy,” which was the source of vitalism. Radishchev approached the understanding of the influence of the environment on the development of organisms, to the idea of the inheritance of acquired traits. At the same time, Radishchev criticized the theory of vulgar materialists who equated thought with matter.\n\nIn matters of cognition, Radishchev also took materialistic positions, believing that thought has as its source the sensory perception of reality. Putting forward and substantiating the theory of natural equality of all people without distinction of class and race, Radishchev branded and exposed the oppression of some people by others. He criticized the racist theories of the “natural” division of society into slaves and slave-owners, condemned the savage arbitrariness of the autocracy and substantiated the right of the oppressed people to revolt and overthrow the rule of tyrants. He condemned the slavery that prevailed in America with shame. His accusatory words against American planters and slave traders have not lost their meaning today. Radishchev expressed ingenious – for the 18th century – thoughts on the role of agriculture, industry and technical inventions in the historical progress and in the mental development of a person.\n\nLinking the tasks of social education with the general tasks of the struggle against serfdom and autocracy, Radishchev also made a great contribution to the development of advanced Russian and world pedagogical science. M. I. Kalinin noted that Radishchev’s thoughts on education to this day can be considered progressive. Radishchev’s views were the highest achievement of social and political thought of his time. The significance and influence of his revolutionary ideas went far beyond the borders of Russia. But above all, Radishchev had a tremendous influence on the subsequent development of revolutionary thought in Russia itself. The Decembrists and the revolutionary democrats of the 1840s and 1860s learned from Radishchev, they were inspired by his selfless struggle against the autocracy.\n\nRadishchev devoted all his life to the struggle for the freedom and happiness of his people, his Motherland. He deeply believed in the mighty forces of the Russian people, in the great future of his native country. The main works of Radishchev are “A Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow,” “A Letter to a Friend Living in Tobolsk,” “The Life of Fyodor Vasilyevich Ushakov,” “On Man, His Mortality and Immortality,” an ode to “Freedom” and others. The selected philosophical and socio-political works of Radishchev were published in 1952.” (Pavel Yudin and Mark Rosenthal, Short Philosophical Dictionary, 5th ed., 1954)\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nA. A. KAVERZNEV (1748-1787, evolutionist, biologist)\n\nAfanasy Avvakumovich Kaverznev was a Russian pre-revolutionary biologist, who was among the first scientists to suggest that species have evolved.\n\n“long before Lamarck, the doctrine of the evolution and variability of species was systematically presented by the Russian scientist Afanasy Kaverznev. However, Kaverznev’s book Philosophical Discourse on the Rebirth of Animals was published during his stay in Leipzig in 1775 in a small edition in German, and the author considered it necessary to keep silent about it, knowing that its content would not meet with sympathy in reactionary circles in Russia. The book and its author were forgotten and remained unknown to this day.” (The article “Lamarck” in Pavel Yudin and Mark Rosenthal, Short Philosophical Dictionary, 5th ed., 1954)\n\nK. A. TIMIRYAZEV (1843-1920) (Botanist, Physiologist, Darwinist)\n\nTimiriazev was the biggest defender of Darwinism in Russia and was a true communist and a true scientist. As someone who deeply understood Darwinism, he was among the first to strongly criticize the reactionary Malthusian aspects in Darwinism. Timiryazev also was quick to recognize that the scientific merit of mendelism was extremely exaggerated, and that mendelism was used to attack Darwinism.\n\n“Kliment Arkadievich Timiryazev (1843 – 1920) – great Russian scientist, biologist, fighter for Darwinism, the founder of the modern doctrine of photosynthesis. Imbued in his youth with the revolutionary democratic ideas of the great Russian thinkers of the middle of the 19th century, Timiryazev devoted all his scientific and social activities to serving advanced science and the working people.\n\nFor his progressive convictions, Timiryazev was persecuted by the Tsarist government. Beginning in 1894, he was under constant surveillance by the secret police. Under the influence of revolutionary ideas and the ever-growing labor movement, Timiryazev, even under Tsarism, came close to the ideas of socialism. While he was never a member of any party, his reputation as a sympathizer with revolutionary ideas was such that in 1917 workers of the Moscow-Kursk railway elected the 75-year old Timiryazev as their deputy to the Moscow Soviet, and in 1918 fellow revolutionary-minded scientists made him a member of the Socialist Academy. The People’s Commissariat of Education appointed Timiryazev a member of the State Scientific Council.\n\nTimiryazev appeared in the press exposing the insolent slander of the Anglo-American imperialists against the Russian people, and exposed the imperialist, predatory goals of the campaign of “14 states” against the young Soviet Republic. On April 27, 1920, VI Lenin wrote to Timiryazev: “I was delighted to read your remarks against the bourgeoisie and for Soviet power.” Lenin had in mind Timiryazev’s book Science and Democracy, in which the scientist called people of science to unity with the working people. The last words of Timiryazev, uttered by him a few hours before his death, show that the great scientist had come to the conclusion that, of all sides fighting in the Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks were the only one with a definite program for the improvement of the lives of the Soviet peoples: “The Bolsheviks pursuing Leninism, I believe and am convinced, are working for the happiness of the people and will lead them to happiness … Convey to Vladimir Ilyich my admiration for his ingenious solution of world problems in theory and in practice. I consider it a pleasure to be a contemporary of his and a witness to his glorious work. I bow to him and want everyone to know about it.”\n\nIn his philosophical views, Timiryazev was a staunch materialist, waging an irreconcilable struggle against idealism. In his writings, he subjected to devastating criticism the line of idealism in philosophy, starting with Plato and ending with the philosophizing squires of imperialism (Bergson, Mach, James and others). In his research, Timiryazev was guided by the “historical method” containing a number of elements of materialist dialectics – the recognition of the universal connection and development of phenomena in nature, the struggle of opposites, causality, necessity, etc. Timiryazev was a remarkable popularizer of science. His books “Charles Darwin and His Teachings,” “Historical Method in Biology” and others are still the best presentation of Darwin’s theory. Timiryazev’s book “The Life of a Plant” is also very popular. Timiryazev made a significant step forward in comparison with Darwin with his truly materialistic interpretation of the development of the organic world.\n\nUnlike the so-called “orthodox” Darwinists, Timiryazev considered the most important factors of evolution not to be intraspecific struggle, but to the external environment, which changes the organism, heredity, which reinforces these changes, and selection, which gives the organisms an expedient form. The organism and the environment are considered by him in an indissoluble unity. In this regard, he highly appreciates the positive side of Lamarck’s teachings – about the dependence of organic forms on the environment. “Only the combination of this side of Lamarckism with Darwinism promises a complete solution of the biological problem,” Timiryazev wrote.\n\nHe recognized that the variability of organisms is due to their adaptation to environmental conditions. He was the first to put forward a provision on the body’s requirements for environmental conditions. By his indication of the alternation of stages of development in plants, Timiryazev emphasized the presence of qualitative transformations in the ontogenetic development of the organism. This position was subsequently developed by I.V. Michurin, who created the theory of staged development of plants. Timiryazev recognized the possibility of not only sexual, but also vegetative hybridization, and also pointed out the great importance of cross-pollination of plants. He sharply criticized Weissmannism and Mendelism for recognizing the existence of a special substance of heredity, allegedly not amenable to the influence of the environment. The works of Timiryazev in the field of the study of photosynthesis were of great importance for the development of biology.\n\nTimiryazev proved that this phenomenon, like the phenomena of inorganic nature, is subject to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, he dealt a crushing blow to the “vitalistic” doctrine of a special “vital force” allegedly inherent in animals and plants. Timiryazev does not limit the task of biology to the knowledge of the laws of development of animals and plants, but raises the question of a conscious change in organic forms. He argues that science should teach the farmer how to grow two ears where one used to grow. Timiryazev wrote the work “Agriculture and Plant Physiology,” in which important provisions of agronomic science were developed.\n\nBefore the Revolution, Timiryazev was able not only to defend the materialistic core of Darwinism, but also to develop it further, preparing a qualitatively new stage in the development of biology – the Michurin doctrine.\n\nThis is an outstanding achievement of the great Russian biologist and thinker. For many decades Timiryazev stood at the head of the advanced materialist biology in its struggle against the reactionary, idealistic direction represented by all kinds of anti-Darwinists, Weissmannists, vitalists and other “ists” and “logs,” as Timiryazev himself called them. Timiryazev sharply condemned the vulgar transfer of biological laws to the field of social phenomena. In 1937-1940. The Works of KA Timiryazev were published, vols. 1-10; in 1948-1949 Selected Works were published.” (Pavel Yudin and Mark Rosenthal, Short Philosophical Dictionary, 5th ed., 1954)\n\nThe Life Of The Plant by K.

Timiryazev, defended and developed Darwinism with all the passion of true scientists.” (The Situation in the Science of Biology,1948)\n\nV. O. KOVALEVSKY (1842-1883) (Paleontologist, Darwinist)\n\nVladimir Onufrievich Kovalevsky carried out important scientific work and translated many works of Darwin into Russian for the first time. His brother Alexander Kovalevsky, an embryologist, was also a significant materialist scientist.\n\nOn the Osteology of the Hyopotamidae by V. O. Kovalevsky\n\nA. O. KOVALEVSKY (1840-1901, embryologist, Darwinist)\n\nAlexander Onufrievich Kovalevsky was an important materialist scientist.\n\n“Alexander Kovalevsky, the famous embryologist… trained the students to have clear materialist ideas…” (A. Sharov, Life Triumphs, p. 74)\n\nI. I. MECHNIKOV (1845-1916) (Zoologist, Immunologist, Darwinist)\n\nIlya Ilyich Mechnikov was also deeply influenced by Darwin’s work and helped propagate it. He discovered phagocytes and received a Nobel prize in physiology in 1908 for his work on immunity.\n\n“Nikolai Umov, the physicist, and Alexander Kovalevsky, the famous embryologist… trained the students to have clear materialist ideas, taught them to seek in the external world for the causes of internal changes, as Sechenov had done when he proved that the external world determines the character of the higher nervous activity of animals and man, as Mechnikov and Pasteur had done when they explained the role of the external world in the origin and spread of diseases.\n\nThe higher course students remembered how Mechnikov had once begun one of his lectures with the words:\n\n“There is a disease which causes restriction in man’s field of vision. First he sees everything round him, then what might be called blinkers form round his eyes. Finally he can only distinguish one shining point in front of him.”\n\nMechnikov said no more for a moment but narrowly watched his audience. Then he concluded:\n\n“If some scientists voluntarily inflict this disease on themselves, by concerning themselves only with their own narrow speciality, their own subject of observation, one can definitely forecast that they will create nothing truly great or truly important for humanity.”” (A. Sharov, Life Triumphs, pp. 74-75)\n\n“Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (1845-1916) – an outstanding Russian biologist, one of the founders of microbiology, comparative embryology and pathology; the theorist of Darwinism, who creatively developed this doctrine. Mechnikov’s worldview was formed under the influence of revolutionary, anti-serfdom sentiments and advanced ideas of the great revolutionary democrats of the 1860s. Mechnikov was one of the progressive leaders of Russian materialistic science and a fighter against ideological reaction in science.\n\nHe made a huge contribution to the development of zoology, embryology, microbiology, pathology, anthropology, Darwinism, etc., in the field of zoology, he described new species of annelids and sucking ciliates, and also developed biological methods to combat insects harmful to agriculture (bread beetles), which was carried out by infecting their larvae with a fungus (green muscardine). Together with A.O. Kovalevsky, Mechnikov is the founder of evolutionary embryology.\n\nHe is the author of remarkable works on the study of the embryonic development of various groups of animals (sponges, hydromedusa), insects, etc. As a result of these studies, general patterns of embryonic development of various groups of animals were established, their genetic relationship and unity of origin were proved. Thus, a great contribution was made to the creative development of Darwin’s teachings. Mechnikov also creatively developed Darwin’s theory on the issue of inflammation and immunity. Based on twenty years of research, Xi created a coherent phagocytic theory of inflammation and immunity. Before Mechnikov, the phenomena of inflammation were explained through Virchow’s metaphysical theory of cellular pathology. Virchow was an enemy of Darwinism and fought against its spread in science.\n\nMechnikov, on the contrary, proved the fruitfulness of the ideas of Darwinism and its historical method in the development of problems of pathology. Ardently promoting and defending Darwinism, Mechnikov, however, did not approach it dogmatically. He criticized the reactionary Malthusian idea of overpopulation, adopted by Darwin to explain the reasons for the struggle for existence and selection. On questions of the theory of knowledge, Mechnikov opposed idealism and metaphysics. He rejected the religious-priestly teaching about the soul and its immortality. “Science,” he wrote, “cannot admit the immortality of the conscious soul, since consciousness is the result of the activity of the elements of our body that do not possess immortality.” Mechnikov criticized various forays of obscurantists in science: vitalists, spiritualists, teleo-iatics like Gustave Le Bon, Oliver Lodge and other mystics.\n\nHe passionately fought against the “fashionable” reactionary philosophers – James, Bergson, Hartmann, Nietzsche, considering them the most harmful ideologists of unscientific reaction. The difficult working conditions resulting from constant persecution by the ruling circles of Tsarist Russia forced Mechnikov to emigrate abroad. He lived in a foreign land for 28 years. However, living far from his homeland, he remained its ardent patriot and did not break close ties with his friends who were in Russia. He was an ardent champion of the emancipation of women, advocated for women’s education, for the social rights of women.\n\nMechnikov covered socio-political issues from the wrong positions. He mistakenly believed that only science is the decisive force for eliminating social evil and injustice. Fighting against political and ideological reaction, he did not see the real forces of social development and did not understand the laws of society. He approached the interpretation of social problems from idealistic and positivist positions. The main works of Mechnikov: “Studies on the nature of man” (1903), “Studies of optimism” (1907), “Forty years of searching for a rational worldview” (1912), the collection “On Darwinism.”” (Pavel Yudin and Mark Rosenthal, Short Philosophical Dictionary, 5th ed., 1954)\n\nWorks of Mechnikov:\n\nImmunity in infective diseases\n\nThe experimental prophylaxis of syphilis [with Maisonneuve & Roux]\n\nThe prolongation of life : optimistic studies\n\nThe new hygiene : three lectures on the prevention of infectious diseases\n\nThe nature of man : studies in optimistic philosophy\n\nOn the comparative pathology of inflammation (Lectures delivered at the Pasteur Institute in 1891)\n\nEmbryologische Studien an Medusen.

Kashchenko (1855-1935, zoologist, Darwinist)\n\nMykola (Nikolai in Russian) Feofanovich Kashchenko was a Soviet professor of zoology and comparative anatomy and rector of Tomsk University, academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR (1919). He was a student of Z. I. Stretsov, corresponded with I. V. Michurin.\n\n“I warmly welcome the regional meeting on fruit growing. I see the development of horticulture in Siberia in the breeding of my Siberian varieties from seeds using my methods. My wish is to widely use the experience of Siberian gardeners Kashchenko, Olonichenko, Krutovskyi, Lysavenko, and Lukashchev. I hope that Siberia will have its fruits and berries”. (I. V. Michurin’s letter to a Siberian fruit growing conference)\n\n“Along with Timiryazev, who at that time carried out the creative popularization and development of Darwin’s evolutionary theory in Moscow, Professor M. F. Kashchenko of Tomsk University also defended Darwinism in distant Siberia.\n\nIn lectures on the course of zoology, in public reports, in the press – wherever there was an opportunity for this, M. F. Kashchenko promoted the foundations of Darwin’s teachings.\n\nAmong the preserved archival materials and printed works of M. F. Kashchenko are his articles and the texts of reports devoted to Darwinism. In them, the author acts as a consistent defender of Darwin’s teachings, expresses deep faith in a great future and the flourishing of creative Darwinism.\n\nM.F. Kashchenko always emphasized the multifaceted nature of Darwin’s teaching, its importance for the flourishing of biological science. In his speech delivered at a solemn meeting at Tomsk University on 22.11.1909, M. F. Kashchenko said: “Charles Darwin devoted his entire life to the development and proof of his theory. At the same time, he developed many very important questions related to the idea of ​​natural selection, such as protective coloration, sexual selection, the origin of cultivated plants and domestic animals, and the origin of man. So, next to the main theory of natural selection, he created several additional theories, and therefore the whole set of his teachings is quite truthfully called Darwinism.”\n\nDeveloping certain propositions of Darwin, M.F. Kashchenko talks about the harmfulness of the dogmatization of this teaching, about the future development of its ideas. “It would, of course, be very naive to think,” writes M.F. Kashchenko – that Darwin revealed everything to us. On the contrary, very, very much of the development of the living world needs further study and clarification, and of course there will be many new theories that will open up new horizons for us.”\n\nMykola Feofanovych Kashchenko was a representative of creative Darwinism. He devoted his entire conscious life to the study of the animal and plant world, and especially to its change in accordance with the needs of society.” (Academician N. F. Kashchenko is an outstanding Michurinist biologist) (in Russian, but auto-translate works pretty well)\n\n“M.F. Kashchenko supported the views of Darwin, Timiryazev and Michurin about the possibility of vegetative hybridization. In this regard, speaking of the “breeding of new cultural breeds through hybridization,” he wrote in 1914: “I am trying to create large-fruited varieties of nightshade by simple sequential selection. But this does not prevent, of course, simultaneous breeding of new varieties from the same material in a different way, namely, through hybridization, which sometimes gives something completely new and original. I combined an ordinary black nightshade with a blue eggplant, and a yellow-fruited variation of a black nightshade with a red eggplant, and the second time the combination was carried out both sexually and by the so-called graft hybridization.”” (Academician N.

He still created countless new plant varieties and American corporations tried to hire him. However, he did not want to leave his homeland. After the revolution his scientific work began on a bigger scale. He developed a truly materialist concept of heredity and had a deep and creative understanding of Darwin’s discoveries. Afterwards he was attacked by the capitalists, aristocratic scientists and out-of-touch dogmatists.\n\n“Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin (1855-1935) – a great biologist who raised Darwinian scientific biology to a new, higher level. A new, higher stage in the development of the materialistic science of living nature is associated with the name of Michurin. Michurin’s life is divided into two sharply different periods – pre-revolutionary and Soviet.\n\nBefore the 1917 Revolution Michurin lived and worked, conducting all the experiments at his own expense, without any encouragement. His deeply popular business – the development of new varieties of plants – he spent on a tiny personal plot at his own risk and fear. His ingenious ideas were not recognized under Tsarism. American businessmen, having found out about the wonderful new varieties of fruit plants he had bred, offered him to move to America. But the great patriot refused this offer.\n\nThe Revolution gave him the opportunity to develop his scientific and practical work. Michurin’s site was transformed into a huge nursery. Scientific research institutes were created that developed and introduced Michurin’s ideas into agricultural practice. In 1934 Michurin wrote: “The dream of my whole life is coming true: the new valuable varieties of fruit plants that I have bred have moved from the experimental plots not to individual rich kulaks, but to the massifs of collective and state farm orchards, replacing low-yielding, bad, old varieties.”\n\nIf Darwin only explained the laws of the organic world, Michurin created a scientific theory about the ways of changing this living world. In his scientific work and worldview until 1917 Michurin directly developed the militant materialism and democracy of the great Russian scientists and revolutionary democrats of the mid-19th century. After 1917 he illuminated and solved the problems of agrobiology.\n\nMichurin said that the roots of natural science lie in nature, that natural science is spontaneously attracted to dialectics. In the preface to the third edition of the book “Principles and Methods of Work” Michurin wrote: “For dialectics there is nothing final, absolute, sacred once and for all. On everything and in everything it reveals the stamp of inevitable disappearance, and nothing can resist it, except for the Continuous process of becoming and destruction, endless ascent from the lowest to the highest.” This principle is always the basic principle in my work, passing like a red thread through all my numerous experiments, which I put in the improvement of existing and in the breeding of new varieties of fruit and berry plants.” Always and in everything Michurin was guided by the idea of development. Each individual, he wrote, develops to the fullness of its specific properties, and then gradually loses them, grows old and, finally, dies. The species changes in the same way as everything in nature – “everything flows, everything changes.”\n\nMichurin was convinced of the omnipotence of science and practice, of the possibility of knowing nature and mastering all the secrets of the formation of species. He constructed his theory as a consistently scientific theory, but reconciled with no concessions to idealism. Michurin considered the organism in close connection with the conditions of its existence, recognizing the decisive importance of the exchange of substances between the organism and nature. He contemptuously rejected the idealistic intricacies of the Weissmannists, Mendelists and Morganists with their unknowable “things in themselves,” with mysterious mystical genes, with the exaltation of randomness in science and practice, and with all his work he refuted these ideas. As a true revolutionary in science, he was not afraid to point out the weak and erroneous sides of Darwin’s teachings. Michurin creatively developed the biology of Darwinism.\n\nThe greatest experimenter, Michurin created and developed scientific methods for the conscious management of plant life and the practical transformation of living nature. The teaching created by Michurin includes:\n\n1) the theory and methods of artificial hybridization (sexual and vegetative, intraspecific and distant),\n\n2) the theory and methods of directed education of organisms,\n\n3) the theory and methods of artificial selection. All these three aspects of Michurin’s doctrine constitute an indissoluble unity and are an example of the creative application of dialectics to understanding the essence of heredity and the variability of organic forms, to the practice of breeding new varieties of plants in the interests of socialist society.\n\nMichurin devoted his whole life to the working people. He considered his nursery a workshop for the creation of new varieties that would more fully meet the “needs of the working people.” “My achievements are in a classless socialist society,” Michurin wrote in 1932. Our goal, he said, “is to alter the properties of plants in a direction desirable for working people.” Michurin formulated the task of biological science: “We cannot wait for favors from nature; it is our task to take them from her. “\n\nImplementing this revolutionary principle, Michurin devoted his entire life to reworking the nature of plants. The creation of new varieties cost Michurin decades of hard and systematic work. His main method, as he himself wrote, consisted in a constant “striving forward, in strict verification and restructuring of experiments.” More than 300 new varieties of fruit and berry plants were developed by the great scientist. But his most valuable legacy is his theory, Michurinist biology.\n\nHe was not a communist, yet he was grateful to the Soviets for the conditions they created for his work. He always wanted to see his work become accessible to the people, and since this happened only in his old age under the public education system established in the USSR, he thanked the Soviets for this. “The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government,” he wrote, “did everything for the prosperity of the work I had begun.”\n\nMichurin was a patriot of his homeland. Even before the revolution, he condemned those scientists and leaders who pinned all their hopes in improving Russian gardening with help from abroad. “It’s a shame,” he wrote, “to think that all the best can be obtained only from abroad.”” (Pavel Yudin and Mark Rosenthal, Short Philosophical Dictionary, 5th ed., 1954)\n\nMichurin (1948) A nice Soviet film about the life and career of I. V. Michurin. Click the CC button for subtitles.\n\nTrofim Lysenko developed many scientific theories and concepts which became highly useful. His early research on vernalization and the theory of phasic development were recognized by the scientific community. Lysenko developed and applied the discoveries of Michurin. He opposed all idealism, dogmatism and separation of theory from practice. For Lysenko, practice was always the criterion of truth.\n\nLysenko came into conflict with snob-scientists who did not want to focus on real life problems. Lysenko came into conflict with the supporters of mendelian genetics (so-called ‘orthodox genetics’ invented by the Augustinian monk Gregor Mendel). For this reason Lysenko is attacked today. His critics claim that “Lysenko did not believe in genes”. However, this is a falsehood. Lysenko disagreed with the mendelists’ idealist definition of genes. For the mendelists, heredity (genes) were totally separate and isolated from the organism, they could not be influenced or altered by changes to the organism or to its living conditions. The genes were conceptualized as indestructible – even immortal – by idols of the mendelists such as August Weismann. Lysenko could not agree with these idealist, metaphysical and mystical notions.\n\nFor Lysenko, heredity was a more complicated interaction between the chromosomes and the DNA, the entire organism, and its environment. The heredity of an organism cannot be reduced to isolated genes, and these genes cannot be seen as unchanging. Lysenko produced significant discoveries. He helped reduce effects of plant-disease, contributed significantly to preventing famine during WWII, demonstrated the harmful effects of inbreeding in agriculture and combated distortions of darwinism. Lysenko promoted the theoretical developments of Michurin, Timiryazev, V. R. Williams and others, and systematized them to what he called Michurinist Agrobiology, or Soviet Creative Darwinism. Lysenko and his colleagues invented new agricultural techniques, new plant varieties and considerably improved agricultural yields.\n\nLysenko disagreed with the idea that animals evolve purely individualistically. He said that mutual aid of animals of the same species living in the same group or herd, is just as important (if not more important) than competition. Lysenko’s view was shared by the great Darwinist Timiriazev, but it is considered heretical by western “neo-darwinists”.\n\nLysenko also disagreed with the notion invented by western mendelist Thomas Morgan, that evolution and heredity are completely random. Lysenko said there must be reasons and laws governing evolution, mainly environmental factors, and heredity must also be influenced by the environment. Lysenko said that if heredity was completely random, we could never breed any plants or animals. His opinion was shared by Michurin who famously said: “We cannot simply wait for favors from nature, we have to wrest them from her”. Michurin meant that agriculturists must use scientific methods to breed new plants, instead of merely waiting for results from the supposedly random processes. For all these reasons Lysenko was attacked by his opponents.\n\nLysenko strongly opposed using western inbred corn, because it was unsuitable to Soviet conditions, unsustainable and risky. He was proven correct when Khrushchev’s attempt to use western inbred corn in the USSR failed completely. Western farming methods have been shown to be risky, prone to pests without constant use of massive amounts of poisons, and ecologically unsustainable.\n\nLater I will write a full article about Lysenko (with sources) and debunk many of the myths about him.\n\nT.

N. BAKH (1857-1946, biochemist)\n\n“Bakh, Aleksei Nikolaevich. Born Mar. 5 (17), 1857, in Zolotonosha, Poltava Oblast; died May 13, 1946, in Moscow. Soviet scientist and revolutionary figure; academician of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (AN SSSR) (1929); Hero of Socialist Labor (1945). Founder of a school of Soviet biochemistry.\n\nBakh’s father was a technician. In 1875 Bakh entered the University of Kiev, from which he was expelled in 1878 for participation in student political activities. He was exiled to Belozersk for three years. When he returned to Kiev he entered the People’s Will organization. Beginning in 1883 he lived underground and did revolutionary work in Yaroslavl and Kazan. He gave lectures to the workers and popularized K. Marx’ economic teachings. On the basis of these lectures he wrote the book Hunger the Tsar (1883). After 1885 he lived as an émigré in France, the USA (1891–92), and Switzerland, and did scientific work. From 1905 to 1918, Bakh adhered to the Socialist Revolutionaries.\n\nIn 1917, Bakh returned to Russia. In 1918 he organized the Central Chemical Laboratory of the All-Russian Council of the National Economy of the RSFSR, which later became the L. Ia. Karpov Physicochemical Institute. Bakh was director of the institute until the end of his life. In 1920 he founded the Biochemical Institute of the People’s Commissariat of Health. In 1928 he became the head of the All-Union Association of Workers of Science and Engineering. In 1935, Bakh and A. I. Oparin organized the Institute of Biochemistry of the AN SSSR. Bakh was its director. (In 1944 the institute was named after him.) He was president of the D. I. Mendeleev All-Union Chemical Society (beginning in 1935). Between 1939 and 1945, Bakh was academician secretary of the Division of Chemical Sciences of the AN SSSR.\n\nAccording to Bakh, the uniqueness of the living world in a chemical sense lies not so much in the peculiarities of its composition as in the diverse chemical transformations that are continuously going on in living organisms. Bakh’s attention was drawn to three basic problems of biochemistry: the chemism of carbon assimilation by green plants, which is the basis of the formation of organic substances in nature; the problem of oxidation processes that take place in the living cell, particularly the chemism of respiration; and the study of enzymes (enzymology). In his work on the assimilation of carbon dioxide by green plants, Bakh gave a new explanation of the nature of the formation of sugar in the process of carbon dioxide assimilation. He viewed the assimilation of carbon as a combined oxidation-reduction reaction that occurs by means of components of water. Proceeding from this point of view, he showed that the source of the molecular oxygen that is given off during assimilation is not carbon dioxide, as was formerly believed, but water.\n\nStudying the role of peroxides that are formed during assimilation, Bakh arrived at a clarification of the nature of oxidation processes (1893–97). He gave final formulation to the peroxide theory of slow oxidation, according to which the energy necessary to activate molecular oxygen during spontaneous oxidation is supplied by the body being oxidized. These properties are possessed only by chemically unsaturated bodies that enter into interaction with the oxygen in the air and activate it. The activated oxygen interacts with the substance being oxidized and forms peroxide. The peroxide theory acquired special significance in the development of concepts on the chemism of respiration.\n\nBakh showed that oxidation is based on a series of enzyme oxidation and oxidation-reduction reactions that follow each other sequentially in a long chain of chemical transformations. He created new experimental methods for the investigation of enzymes. These methods are still used in both experimental and practical work at clinics, experimental stations, and factory laboratories. The results of Bakh’s work in enzymology are used in modern industrial biochemistry in the production of bread, beer, tea, and tobacco, in the retting of flax, in salting fish, and so forth.\n\nBakh was a deputy to the First Convocation of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. He won the Lenin Prize (1926) and the State Prize of the USSR (1941). Bakh was awarded four Orders of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor.\n\nWORKS:\n\nSbornik izbrannykh trudov.

In 1924 he presented the hypothesis that life has emerged through the chemical evolution of carbon based molecules in the so-called ‘primordial soup’. Throughout his career Oparin further developed this idea. He showed convincingly how life emerged naturally without the need for any kind of supernatural creator.

Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (1946; corresponding member, 1939). Hero of Socialist Labor (1969).\n\nOparin graduated from Moscow University in 1917 and subsequently worked in a number of institutions of higher learning and research institutes. From 1942 to 1960 he was head of the subdepartment of plant biochemistry at Moscow University. In 1935, together with A. N. Bakh, Oparin organized the Institute of Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He was deputy director of the institute until 1946, when he was made director. From 1948 to 1955 he was academician-secretary of the department of biology of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.\n\nOparin’s main works deal with biochemical principles of processing plant raw materials, enzyme activity in plants, and the origin of life on earth. He showed that biocatalysis is the basis of the production of a number of food products, and he developed the principles of Soviet technical biochemistry. Oparin’s first remarks on the origin of terrestrial life were made in 1922, and his book The Origin of Life was published in 1924. According to Oparin, life originated on earth as a result of the evolution of carbonaceous compounds.\n\nOparin became the president of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life in 1970, and he has been its honorary president since 1977; he also is an honorary member of the academies of sciences of Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, Cuba, Spain, and Italy. He is also a member of the Leopoldine German Academy of Researchers in the Natural Sciences. A recipient of the Lenin Prize (1974), the A. N. Bakh Prize, and the I. I.

Then, without leaving work at the zoo, he studied at the graduate school of the USSR Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn 1928, B. P. Tokin proposed the term “phytoncides” (from the merger of ancient Greek φυτόν (plant) and Latin caedo (kill)) for toxic volatile substances of some plants with antimicrobial properties (bactericides of plant origin). Later he would earn a Stalin Prize for this research.\n\nIn the 1930s Tokin opposed the theory of O. B. Lepeshinskaya and put forward his own theory of cell ontogeny as its development between two divisions. In the 1930s he was the director of the K. A. Timiryazev State Biological Institute. In June 1936, Tokin was appointed rector of Tomsk State University, but was fired in 1937, expelled from the CPSU (b) and arrested in February 1938.

In 1941, he initiated the creation of the Tomsk Committee of Scientists, which brought together university staff for scientific research to help the army. During the Great Patriotic War Tokin developed further ways of using plants for anti-microbial and medicinal purposes, to help alleviate the shortage of medicines.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1955 Tokin worked in the Institute of Experimental Medicine (VIEM) and was the professor and head of the department of embryology of the Leningrad State University. In 1950 he became a laureate of the Stalin Prize.\n\nTokin attacked reactionary mendelism-morganism. At the beginning of 1950, Tokin also sent a letter to the CC of the CPSU(b), where he reported that the secretary of the Jewish Masonic lodge, Professor D. N. Nasonov, professors P. G. Svetlov, A. A. Brown, A. D. Brown and certain others had formed a conspiratorial nationalist zionist group (see the section on Svetlov).\n\nIn 1966-1984 he was the president of the Leningrad Society of Naturalists (LOIP).\n\nHe earned the following awards:\n\n-Laureate of the Stalin Prize of the third degree (1950) for the scientific work “Phytoncides” (1948)\n\n-Order of the Red Banner of Labor (1957)\n\n-Honored Scientist of the RSFSR (1961)\n\n-Order of Lenin (1967)\n\n-Hero of Socialist Labor (1971)\n\n-Order of the October Revolution (1980)\n\n-Honorary citizen of the city of Volsk, Saratov region\n\n-Various medals\n\nP.

MESHCHERSKAYA (1909-1991, pharmacologist)\n\nKira Alexandrovna Meshcherskaya was a Soviet biologist and pharmacologist, doctor of medical sciences, professor. Her husband was the noted scientist, Order of Red Star winner, D. M. Steinberg.\n\nMeshcherskaya was born on June 10, 1909 into an aristocrat family in Smolensk province. Having received a home education, then a secondary education in a Soviet school, Kira Alexandrovna studied at the 2nd Leningrad Medical Institute from 1926 to 1931. After graduating from high school, Meshcherskaya was sent to work as a doctor at the health center of a mechanical plant in Kemerovo. Returning two years later to Leningrad, from 1933 to 1935 she worked as a junior researcher at the All-Union Institute of Experimental Medicine (VIEM). At this period she was fired from her job in connection with administrative actions against her aristocratic family. However, she was transferred to other work and demonstrated her loyalty to the Soviet power and communism. She worked for a year at the Kazakh Research Institute for the Protection of Motherhood and Childhood (Alma-Ata ), then for another year as a district pediatrician in Leningrad, without leaving scientific studies, which she devoted to her free time from her main work.\n\nAfter defending her Ph.D. thesis at Leningrad University (specialty: biology) in 1937, she was accepted as an assistant at the Department of Pharmacology of the Pediatric Medical Institute and began preparing her doctoral dissertation, which was interrupted by the Great Patriotic War. Meshcherskaya volunteered for the front.\n\nIn June 1941, she was drafted by the City Military Commissariat of Leningrad into the Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army. During the Great Patriotic War, she served as a battalion doctor, head of the sanitary service of a separate sanitary battalion, chief toxicologist of the 23rd Army (Leningrad Front). She used coniferous tincture in the army as an antiscorbutic agent. She proved that when using the mud solution of Gorky Lake on the 15th day of treatment, complete healing of wounds occurred. When this solution was used orally at a dose of 0.5 ml per 100 grams of water for 14 days, the ulcerative surfaces of the stomach healed. During the war, K. A. Meshcherskaya received four military ranks, was awarded orders and medals, and was demobilized with the rank of major in the medical service. She joined the CPSU(b) in 1943.\n\nAfter demobilization, Meshcherskaya returned to teaching at the pediatric institute. After defending her doctoral dissertation in pharmacology in 1947 on “Analysis of the toxic effect of potassium ions and its features in different periods of animal growth (On the problem of age-related physiology)”, she worked as a senior researcher at the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Leningrad). Then she headed the department of pharmacology of the Chelyabinsk (since 1949) and the departments of biology and pharmacology of the Blagoveshchensk (since 1952) medical institutes. In both universities she was vice-rector for academic and scientific work. From 1968 to 1986 she headed the Department of Pharmacology at the Vladivostok State Medical Institute.\n\nProfessor K. A.
