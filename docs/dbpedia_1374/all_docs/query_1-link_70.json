        "text": "“Art in Evacuation” demonstrates how, in an incredible way, Russia’s cultural heritage was preserved to the extent that wartime even enabled artistic life to flourish. Thousands of kilometers away from Moscow and the frontline great music was written, famous productions were staged, spectacular films were created and exhibitions of outstanding artists were organized. For many cultural figures, the war years were the time when they established their place in the artistic firmament. Any attempt to collect and display records and artefacts from this era of the country’s artistic life is a precious undertaking. It is important to remember that today, 70 years after the end of the war, the voice of that time sounds very different to us. Many things that were taken for granted then seem astonishing to us in their courage and apparent recklessness; other everyday circumstances provoke a certain scepticism today. Sometimes the voices of the individuals who were caught up in these events start to be filtered through a layer of cultural ideology while our contemporary ‘ear’ is also very different from the ear of society in past decades. Perm, Novosibirsk, Nalchik, Tbilisi, Tashkent, Alma-Ata… Neither this description, nor any space for an exhibition dedicated to the art that survived though the evacuation, could be big enough to recollect and reconsider these strange, frightening, yet still beautiful years. We can only hope that visitors who see this unique exhibits and records from that time will recognize them as more than silent objects from the past. They are gateways to cities whose names are no longer on the maps, or that are no longer part of this country, but where the traces of the artistic community during the wartime evacuation are still visible."
