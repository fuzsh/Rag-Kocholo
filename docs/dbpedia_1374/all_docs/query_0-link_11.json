Besides,\n\nthe IAF has a stable chain of command, management, and material support and a clear division of duties united\n\nby a common goal.\n\nThe following weapons are in service with the IAF: 5.45-mm Kalashnikov assault rifles (AK-74), 7.62-\n\nmm modernised Kalashnikov assault rifles (AKM), 9-mm Makarov pistols (PM), a 30-mm mounted automatic\n\ngrenade launcher (AGS-17), a portable anti-tank grenade launcher (RPG-7), rocket-propelled anti-tank\n\ngrenades (RPG-26), F-1 hand grenades, other explosive devices and explosives, as well as various small arms\n\nof foreign manufacture.\n\nOn 22 November 2015, to exert influence over the economic and political interests of the Russian\n\nFederation and to endanger its national security, unidentified members of the IAF led by L.E. Islyamov, using\n\nsuch weapons as explosive devices and explosives, damaged overhead power line VL-330 kW “Kakhovka–\n\nOstrovskoe” No. 140 and overhead power line VL-330 kW “Kakhovka–Dzhankoy” No. 161, situated in the\n\narea of the urban-type settlement of Chaplynka of the Kherson Region of Ukraine, by blowing them up and,\n\nbetween 22 November 2015 and 4 December 2015, prevented the repair of the above overhead power lines\n\nthat served as critical infrastructure facilities of the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol.\n\nAfter creating and heading the above illegal armed formation, between 26 December 2015 and January\n\n2016 inclusive, using the mass media and the Internet, L.E. Islyamov repeatedly and publicly called an\n\nunlimited number of people to join the illegal armed formation called “Noman Çelebicihan Crimean Tatar\n\nVolunteer Battalion” created by him (L.E.

As I approached the said group of people I saw that one person who was\n\nholding the flag sprayed gas at a man who was nearby and made a critical remark to them about\n\ngathering a rally by the monument, and then I heard that someone who was standing there with the\n\nflags began threatening everyone with the crackle of the electric shocker device. By “everyone” I\n\nmean the ordinary people who made critical remarks to the group of people with the flags in\n\nconnection with the rally. It was them who the group of people with the flag was scaring off with gas\n\nspray and electric shocker device. Then the group of people holding the flags got into two vehicles,\n\none of which was a grey S2000 Honda (cabriolet) with the license plate number SN5206 (I do not\n\nremember the last letters on the plate) and the other was a blue Fiat with the license plate number\n\nSN3614 (if I am not mistaken). I took a photo of that rally from a distance with my mobile phone. If\n\nneeded, I can provide the photograph. .\n\nI have read the above and it is an accurate account of my statement.\n\nA.S.
