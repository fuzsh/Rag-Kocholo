Impresa Pizzarotti was founded in 1910 as a sole proprietorship by Gino Pizzarotti. In 1945 it was transformed into a limited liability company and, in 1961, into a joint-stock company. The net worth, to date, is over 200 million euros.

The company handles the design and construction of large civil engineering works in Italy and abroad. Since the end of the 1950s, Impresa Pizzarotti has been experiencing a continuous evolution to become one of the most important Italian corporate groups in the construction sector. The company operates mainly as an EPC [Engineering, Procurement, Construction] Contractor, but is also active in concession and project financing. It builds prefabricated structures for residential and industrial construction and deals with real estate promotion in the Real Estate sector.

Our history continues thanks to four generations of the Pizzarotti family who, together with many collaborators, have invested in commitment and dedication to build not only buildings, roads and railways, but also to encourage individual and collective growth, improving working and living conditions. Below, we summarize the most significant stages from 1910 to today.
