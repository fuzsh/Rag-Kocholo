Impresa Pizzarotti, one of the leading Italian and international construction companies providing the design and construction services for major infrastructural projects, won a tender to build three sections of the S5 expressway in the kujawsko-pomorskie voivodship, and in 2017 the company won another “design and build” tender for a section of the S61 expressway in the podlaskie voivodship. As a result of the changing road construction market in Poland, in 2019 Impresa Pizzarotti initiated discussions with the General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways to modify the terms and conditions of the signed agreements.

Questia was asked to develop a strategy, develop materials and documentation for the media, as well as to run a press office for the client. The effects of Questia’s activities included numerous media reports presenting the position of Impresa Pizzarotti.
