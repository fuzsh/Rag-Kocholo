        "text": "Brescia, 10th June 2022.- The experimental Arena of the Future circuit, built on the A35 Brebemi highway to supply power to electric vehicles through a wireless inductive charging system, is already exploring the development of strategic infrastructure projects at the national and international level. This is a clear sign that the transition towards the decarbonization of the transport sector is generating significant advances for the benefit of mobility and the environment.\n\nToday, the Chairman of A35 Brebemi Francesco Bettoni together with all of the other project partners, and in the presence of the Minister of the Italian Republic Mariastella Gelmini, were in Chiari (Bs) to officially unveil the inductive recharging technology for electric vehicles known as DWPT (Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer), a system that has also been tested in different parts of the world.\n\nThe Italian pilot project coordinated by A35 Brebemi, a company owned by Aleatica – a global transport infrastructure operator that focuses on smart, safe, sustainable and innovative mobility solutions – is the most advanced of its kind. It involves organizations that are reference points in each sector of competence, including: ABB, Electreon, IVECO, IVECO BUS, Mapei, Pizzarotti, Politecnico di Milano, Prysmian, Stellantis, TIM, FIAMM Energy Technology, Università Roma Tre, Università di Parma, Vigili del Fuoco and Ministry of the Interior – Polizia Stradale.\n\nThis technology allows for EV (electric vehicles) to recharge their batteries while travelling in dedicated lanes. This innovative system of coils positioned under the asphalt transfers energy directly to the vehicles (cars, trucks and buses). A “zero emissions” mobility system, which includes different elements studied by the industrial experts involved, interacts with each other: asphalt, control units, cables, electric vehicles and 5G connectivity.\n\nRecently, experts from the Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable Mobility in Italy (MIMS) and STEMI (Structures for the ecological transition of mobility and infrastructure, presented a document entitled “Decarbonizing Transport: Scientific Evidence and Policy Proposals”. It recognizes that wireless charging technology is a possible solution that would help achieve pre-set objectives, particularly in light of current discussions related to the “Fit for 55 package” presented by the European Commission to implement the Green Deal strategy, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030.\n\nAs electric vehicles push the transportation sector towards decarbonization, despite critical issues related to battery lifespans and size, induction charging can contribute to a transition towards sustainable mobility models that further improve the user experience. The results of the testing that has been done and that is still underway as part of the Italian project “Arena del Futuro,” confirm that DWPT brings extraordinary advantages.\n\nFindings on the use of this induction charging technology demonstrate: greater energy efficiency of vehicles due to the ability to charge on roads; a reduction in vehicle battery volume without impacting the load capacity for people and goods; an increased average lifespan for batteries due to the fact that charging peaks can be avoided by charging during the day at regular intervals; and a better overall quality of travel that optimises time with the combination of different recharging systems.\n\nAll these goals are also achievable thanks to the innovative technologies offered by 5G and AI-based application solutions, which will facilitate the exchange of information between the vehicle and management platforms, increasing road safety and travel efficiency.\n\nDWPT technology, in its dynamic and static inductive versions, has already attracted potential interest for commercial development in Italy and abroad. Its versatility is one of the main reasons why it is so attractive, because in addition to being useful on roads and motorways, it is also suitable when combined with other infrastructure such as harbours, airports, and parking lots.\n\nThe “Arena del Futuro” project is a prime example of collaborative innovation for zero emission mobility for both people and goods.\n\nProfile of project partners\n\nA35 Brebemi-Aleatica motorway\n\nThe A35 Brebemi-Aleatica is the direct motorway link between Brescia and Milan, the fastest and safest route between the two cities. Active since 23 July 2014, the infrastructure extends 62.1 km to which the Castegnato toll booth and the ramps for interconnection with the A4 motorway have been added. The motorway can be reached from the city of Brescia via the A4 motorway (taking the exit ramp after Brescia Ovest in the direction of the A35 Milan-Linate), the Tangenziale Sud of Brescia and the SP19 or using the new A21 (Corda Molle). There are six toll booths on the motorway: Chiari Ovest, Calcio, Romano di Lombardia, Bariano, Caravaggio and Treviglio. After passing the last toll booth at Treviglio, you enter the A58 Tangenziale Est Esterna Milano (TEEM), which allows the A35 Brebemi to reach the A1 at Melegnano, the A4 at Agrate, Linate and the Milan Metropolitan Area via two junctions, on the right, Pozzuolo Martesana and on the left, Liscate, which exit respectively onto the SP103 Cassanese and the SP14 Rivoltana. A35 Brebemi has received important international awards, in the US and the UK, as the best infrastructure project financing and the best European project bond.\n\nAleatica is a leading global operator and developer of transportation assets headquartered in Madrid with annual revenues of c. €810m and ca 3,000 employees worldwide.
