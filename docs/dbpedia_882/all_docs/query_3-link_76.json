        "text": "Investment Treaty Arbitration\n\nLast verified on Monday 31st July 2023\n\nInvestment Treaty Arbitration: Italy\n\nand\n\nOverview of investment treaty programme\n\n1. What are the key features of the investment treaties to which this country is a party?\n\nItaly\n\nBIT Contracting\n\nParty or MIT Substantive protections Procedural rights Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) Expropriation Protection and Security Most-favoured-nation (MFN) Umbrella clause Cooling-off period Local courts Arbitration\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\nQualifying criteria – any unique or distinguishing features?\n\n2. What are the distinguishing features of the definition of “investor” in this country’s investment treaties?\n\nItaly\n\nIssue Distinguishing features in relation to the definition of “investor”\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n3. What are the distinguishing features of the definition of \"investment\" in this country’s investment treaties?\n\nItaly\n\nIssue Distinguishing features in relation to the concept of “investment”\n\nAssets that qualify for protection\n\nItalian BITs generally take a broad approach to the investments protected under the BIT using the expression \"every kind of asset”. This was the approach of the 2003 Italian Model BIT. Almost all of Italy’s BITs contain a non-exhaustive list of examples of assets that qualify as investments. The Chad and Uruguay BITs contain exhaustive lists.\n\nThe 2020 Model BIT maintains a similar broad approach, but further adds the characteristics of \"certain duration, the commitment of capital or other resources, the assumption of risk, or the expectation of gain or profit”. The 2020 Model BIT further provides that alterations of the form in which assets are invested or reinvested do not affect their qualification as investments.\n\nThe requirement of compliance of the investment with the host state’s legislation is a feature in many Italian BITs.\n\nIndirect control of assets\n\nThe Italy–Hong–Kong BIT expressly includes in the definition of investment assets held or invested directly or indirectly by a protected investor.\n\nThe 2020 Model BIT provides that a protected investment is owned or controlled directly or indirectly.\n\nConnected/related activities\n\nNineteen investment treaties extend their application to all activities connected with an investment (ie, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Croatia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Lebanon, Macedonia, Malawi, Moldova, Paraguay, Peru, Syria, Uganda and Uzbekistan BITs). Almost all of those treaties or the respective protocols contain a non-exhaustive list of such activities, which usually include, inter alia, the organisation, control, operation, maintenance and disposition of companies, agencies offices, the borrowing of funds, the purchase, issuance and sale of equity shares and other securities.\n\nExclusion of certain assets\n\nThe 2020 Model BIT excludes an order or judgment entered in a judicial or administrative action or an arbitral award from the definition of protected investment. It further provides that the term \"claims to money” does not include claims to money that arise solely from commercial transactions for the sale of goods or services by a natural person or an enterprise in the territory of a party to a natural person or an enterprise in the territory of the other party, or the extension of credit in relation to such transactions.\n\nCommencement of treaty protection\n\nIn line with the 2003 Model BIT, the 2020 Model BIT provides that a covered investment is an investment made before or after the date of entry into force of the BIT. Among other BITs, the BITs with Egypt, Jordan, Nicaragua, Panama and South Africa follow this approach.\n\nThe Italy–Pakistan BIT provides that a covered investment is one made after 1 September 1954. The Croatia–Italy BIT provides that investments made before 30 May 1990 are protected if they are existing and operative.\n\nThe Italy–Argentina BIT applies to investments made before the entry into force of the BIT, but it does not cover disputes already commenced or resolved before/claims pending before the entry into force of the BIT (a similar provision is also set out in the BITs concluded with Bosnia, Chile, Dominican Republic, Mexico and Paraguay).\n\nAdmission/approval of an investment\n\nThe Indonesia–Italy BIT only applies to:\n\nItalian investments that are approved in the Indonesian territory in accordance with Law No. 1/1967 concerning foreign investments; and\n\nIndonesian investments that have been recognised by the Italian authorities to be in conformity with the Italian laws.\n\nItalian investments made (i) before the entry in force of Law No. 1/1967; (ii) after the entry in force of such law but before the entry in force of the BIT; and (iii) not yet officially recognised, can be covered by the treaty protection only after their admission by the host state in conformity with the Law No. 1/1967.\n\nThe Protocol of the Italy–Philippines BIT provides that the treaty shall apply, with respect to the Republic of the Philippines, to investments, which are qualified for registration and duly registered with the Central Bank of the Republic of the Philippines and other appropriate government agencies.\n\nThe Italy–Iran BIT requires, with respect to the Islamic Republic of Iran, the prior approval by the Organisation for Investment Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran for any investment, reinvestment and their modification.\n\nThe 2020 Model BIT covers only post-establishment protection and does not cover the pre-establishment phase or matters of market access.\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\nSubstantive protections – any unique or distinguishing features?\n\n4. What are the distinguishing features of the fair and equitable treatment standard in this country’s investment treaties?\n\nItaly\n\nIssue Distinguishing features of the fair and equitable treatment standard\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n5. What are the distinguishing features of the protection against expropriation standard in this country’s investment treaties?\n\nItaly\n\nIssue Distinguishing features of the “expropriation” standard\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n6. What are the distinguishing features of the national treatment/most-favoured-nation treatment standard in this country’s investment treaties?\n\nItaly\n\nIssue Distinguishing features of the “national treatment” and/or “most favoured nation” standard\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n7. What are the distinguishing features of the obligation to provide protection and security to qualifying investments in this country’s investment treaties?\n\nItaly\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n8. What are the distinguishing features of the umbrella clauses contained within this country’s investment treaties?\n\nItaly\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n9. What are the other most important substantive rights provided to qualifying investors in this country?\n\nItaly\n\nIssue Other substantive protections\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n10. Do this country’s investment treaties exclude liability through carve-outs, non-precluded measures clauses, or denial of benefits clauses?\n\nItaly\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\nProcedural rights in this country’s investment treaties\n\n11. Are there any relevant issues related to procedural rights in this country’s investment treaties?\n\nItaly\n\nIssue Procedural rights\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n12. What is the approach taken in this country’s investment treaties to standing dispute resolution bodies, bilateral or multilateral?\n\nItaly\n\nThe 2020 Model BIT incorporates numerous provisions regarding arbitrators’ independence and arbitration proceedings. It does not include the resolution of ISDS disputes through a standing permanent dispute resolution body. The options available to claimant-investors are ad hoc arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules, arbitration under the ICC, LCIA or SCC arbitration rules, or arbitration under the arbitration rules of the ICSID Convention.\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n13. What is the status of this country’s investment treaties?\n\nItaly\n\nIn 2021, Italy published the new Italian Model BIT, which replaces the 2003 Italian Model BIT.[4] Regulation (EU) No. 1219/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 established transitional arrangements for BITs between EU member states and third countries. According to EU Regulation No. 1219/2012, Italy is under an obligation to notify all Italian investment treaties to the EU Commission and, subsequently, to eliminate all inconsistencies of the Italian investment protection regime with EU Law. Pursuant to EU Regulation No. 1219/2012, EU countries, including Italy, can negotiate BITs with third countries, provided that they are in compliance with EU law and the EU Commission authorises individual EU states to enter into negotiations with third countries.\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\nPracticalities of commencing an investment treaty claim against this country\n\n14. To which governmental entity should notice of a dispute against this country under an investment treaty be sent? Is there a particular person or office to whom a dispute notice against this country should be addressed?\n\nItaly\n\nGovernment entity to which claim notices are sent\n\nNotices of dispute are usually addressed to Avvocatura Generale dello Stato (ie, the office of the Attorney General), the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n15. Which government department or departments manage investment treaty arbitrations on behalf of this country?\n\nItaly\n\nGovernment department that manages investment treaty arbitrations\n\nAvvocatura Generale dello Stato manages investment treaty arbitrations and formally represents Italy pursuant to article 9 of Law 3 April 1979, No. 3 whereby the Office of the Attorney General represents and defends the State of Italy before, among others, international tribunals. Avvocatura Generale dello Stato collaborates with the Service for Law Affairs, Diplomatic Disputes and Treaties of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Italy with regard to international investment arbitration.\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n16. Are internal or external counsel used, or expected to be used, by the state in investment treaty arbitrations? If external counsel are used, does the state normally go through a formal public procurement process when hiring them?\n\nItaly\n\nInternal/external counsel\n\nItaly, through the office of Avvocatura Generale dello Stato, may instruct external counsel in investment treaty arbitrations, following a procurement process.\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\nPracticalities of enforcing an investment treaty claim against this country\n\n17. Has the country signed and ratified the Washington Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (1965)? Please identify any legislation implementing the Washington Convention.\n\nItaly\n\nWashington Convention implementing legislation\n\nYes, adopted by Law No. 1093 of 10 May 1970 \"Ratification and Execution of the Convention on the Settlement of Disputes on Investments Between States and Nationals of Other States, adopted in Washington on 18 March 1965\" (published in the Official Gazette No. 8 of 12 January 1971).\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n18. Has the country signed and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958) (the New York Convention)? Please identify any legislation implementing the New York Convention.\n\nItaly\n\nNew York Convention implementing legislation\n\nYes, adopted by Law No. 62 of 19 May 1958 \"Adhesion to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Awards, Adopted in New York on 10 June 1958 and its execution\" (Published in the Official Gazette No. 46 of 21 February 1968).\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n19. Does the country have legislation governing non-ICSID investment arbitrations seated within its territory?\n\nItaly\n\nLegislation governing non-ICSID arbitrations\n\nTItaly does not have a specific non-ICSID investment arbitration legislation. Articles 806-840 of the Code of Civil Procedure enacted by Royal Decree of 28 October 1940 No. 1443 regulate international arbitrations seated in Italy. In December 2021, the Italian Parliament passed a new bill (Law No. 206 of 26 November 2021) to delegate the government to update the rules on civil proceedings, including the provisions of the code of civil procedure on arbitration.\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n20. Does the state have a history of voluntary compliance with adverse investment treaty awards; or have additional proceedings been necessary to enforce these against the state?\n\nItaly\n\nCompliance with adverse awards\n\nItaly, as an ICSID State member, recognises an award rendered pursuant to article 54(1) of the Washington Convention. In 2019, Italy lost in two SCC cases, namely CEF Energia BV v Italian Republic and Greentech v Italy. Italy commenced proceedings before the Svea Court of Appeal to try to set aside both awards.[5]\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n21. Describe the national government’s attitude towards investment treaty arbitration.\n\nItaly\n\nAttitude of government towards investment treaty arbitration\n\nItaly’s generally favourable attitude towards investment treaty arbitration is reflected in the fact that it has signed more than 90 BITs. On 30 December 2014, Italy notified the government of the Portuguese Republic, the ECT depository pursuant to article 49 ECT, of its decision to withdraw from the ECT. Pursuant to article 47(3) of the ECT, Italy’s withdrawal took effect upon the expiry of one year after the date of notification, in January 2016. The provisions of the Treaty will continue to apply to investments made in Italy before such date for a further 20 years.\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\n22. To what extent have local courts been supportive and respectful of investment treaty arbitration, including the enforcement of awards?\n\nItaly\n\nAttitude of local courts towards investment treaty arbitration\n\nBased on publicly available information, to date there have been no investment treaty awards sought to be enforced against Italy in Italian local courts. In cases of investment treaty awards to be enforced in Italy, but not involving Italy as respondent state, Italian courts (in Rome and Milan) have demonstrated an arbitration-friendly approach.[1]\n\n[1] See eg, J Ballantyne, Italian court allows enforcement against Kazakhstan, Global Arbitration Review, 6 March 2019; C de Stefano, Il Primo lodo ICSID riconosciuto in Italia, Rivista dell'Arbitrato 3(2019), p. 540.\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\nNational legislation protecting inward investments\n\n23. Is there any national legislation that protects inward foreign investment enacted in this country? Describe the content.\n\nItaly\n\nItaly does not have a specific law providing for protection for foreign investments, as some national legislation does enact laws on foreign investment. There are, however, provisions on investment screening (golden power legislation) established by Law Decree No. 21 of 15 March 2012.\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\nNational legislation protecting outgoing foreign investment\n\n24. Does the country have an investment guarantee scheme or offer political risk insurance that protects local investors when investing abroad? If so, what are the qualifying criteria, substantive protections provided and the means by which an investor can invoke the protections?\n\nItaly\n\nRelevant guarantee scheme Qualifying criteria, substantive protections provided and practical considerations\n\nMultilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA Convention)\n\nUnder the MIGA Convention, investors are protected against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, breach of contract and not complying with financial obligations. Italy ratified the MIGA Convention in 1985.\n\nSACE\n\nSACE (standing for Special Section for the Insurance of Credit for Exports) was created in 1977 and is now part of the Cassa Deposito Prestiti Group. SACE provides Italian companies and their subsidiaries planning to make foreign direct investments with, among others, insurance packages by way of future dividends, revenues from the sale of the investment and interests on shareholder’s loans, as well as access to equity solutions and medium or long-term finance, and insurance against political risk.\n\nAnswer contributed by\n\nand\n\nAwards\n\n25.
