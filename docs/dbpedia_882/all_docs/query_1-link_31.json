Unethical behavior compromises the relationship of trust and can encourage hostile attitudes towards the company.\n\nWe have identified some reference values that guide the behavior of all the people who act on our behalf, in order to ensure correctness in the conduct of business and company activities.\n\nHonesty, correctness, integrity, transparency, impartiality, confidentiality, respect and protection of the environment, protection of health and safety in the workplace are the values that characterize our actions and are essential for the achievement of our economic, productive and social objectives.\n\nTo consistently put these values into practice, everyone shall provide a convinced cultural, technical, operational and ethical contribution, both in individual and collective behaviors.\n\nWe carry out all Groupâ€™s activities in compliance with International Conventions and in rigorous respect of human rights enshrined in the UN Universal Declaration.\n\nTo ensure the correctness and transparency of company operations, we have adopted an organization, management and control model in accordance with the provisions of Legislative Decree 231/01, as well as specific documents that allow you to direct behaviors oriented towards ethics and integrity, such as Ethical code and the Supplier Code of Conduct."
