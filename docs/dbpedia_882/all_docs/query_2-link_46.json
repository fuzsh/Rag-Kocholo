As a result of the changing road construction market in Poland, in 2019 Impresa Pizzarotti initiated discussions with the General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways to modify the terms and conditions of the signed agreements.\n\nQuestia was asked to develop a strategy, develop materials and documentation for the media, as well as to run a press office for the client. The effects of Questia’s activities included numerous media reports presenting the position of Impresa Pizzarotti."
