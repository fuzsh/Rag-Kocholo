        "text": "Brescia, May 2021 – Today the A35 Brebemi-Aleatica motorway, ABB, Electreon, FIAMM Energy Technology, IVECO, IVECO Bus, Mapei, Pizzarotti, Politecnico di Milano, Prysmian, Stellantis, TIM, Roma Tre University and the University of Parma announced the launch of a collaboration aimed at creating the conditions to develop an innovative zero-emission system for the mobility of people and goods along motorway transport corridors.\n\nThis consortium will work together over the coming months to demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of technologies to power electric cars, buses and commercial vehicles using contactless dynamic inductive charging.\n\nThe uniqueness of this revolutionary project lies in the fact that, for the first time in the world, a pool of important international industrial companies supported by prestigious universities and institutions will be collaborating with the aim of analysing all the data related to this futuristic technology that will emerge over the next few months of work and study.\n\nThe project includes, in particular:\n\nconstructing a 1,050-metre asphalt ring powered by 1MW of electrical power, called the ‘Arena del Futuro’, located in a private area of the A35 motorway near the Chiari Ovest exit\n\napplying ‘Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer’ technology to various ranges of electric vehicles in a static and dynamic environment\n\nadvanced connectivity through 5G and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies to ensure maximum road safety and optimize the productivity of commercial vehicles\n\noptimizing the road surface in order to make it more durable and not alter the efficiency of the inductive charge.\n\nProfile of project partners\n\nA35 Brebemi-Aleatica motorway\n\nThe A35 Brebemi-Aleatica is the direct motorway link between Brescia and Milan, the fastest and safest route between the two cities. Active since 23 July 2014, the infrastructure extends 62.1 km to which the Castegnato toll booth and the ramps for interconnection with the A4 motorway have been added. The motorway can be reached from the city of Brescia via the A4 motorway (taking the exit ramp after Brescia Ovest in the direction of the A35 Milan-Linate), the Tangenziale Sud of Brescia and the SP19 or using the new A21 (Corda Molle). There are six toll booths on the motorway: Chiari Ovest, Calcio, Romano di Lombardia, Bariano, Caravaggio and Treviglio. After passing the last toll booth at Treviglio, you enter the A58 Tangenziale Est Esterna Milano (TEEM), which allows the A35 Brebemi to reach the A1 at Melegnano, the A4 at Agrate, Linate and the Milan Metropolitan Area via two junctions, on the right, Pozzuolo Martesana and on the left, Liscate, which exit respectively onto the SP103 Cassanese and the SP14 Rivoltana. A35 Brebemi has received important international awards, in the US and the UK, as the best infrastructure project financing and the best European project bond.\n\nAleatica is a leading global operator and developer of transportation assets headquartered in Madrid with annual revenues of c. €570m and ca 2,200 employees worldwide.
