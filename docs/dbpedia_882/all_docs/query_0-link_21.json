In addition to M&A and corporate matters, the McDermott team also advised on matters regarding public law aspects of the transaction such as compliance with Italy’s public contract regulations as well as negotiations with the state owned road authority ANAS regarding the change of concessionaire.\n\nThe team also acted as a lender counsel to UBI><Banca, agent, financier and hedging provider, and BPER, financier and hedging provider in connection with drafting, negotiation and execution of the financial and security documentation with the new shareholder.\n\n“We are very pleased to contribute to the success of this interesting, complex and challenging transaction,” said Marco Cerritelli. “This appointment was a clear sign that the quality of our energy and infrastructure advice, coupled with our capacity to help private and public clients, has been noted and valued by the market. This transaction also confirms a growing interest of institutional investors in opportunities offered by the Italian secondary energy market.”\n\nBanca IMI acted as financial advisor to Pizzarotti while Crowe Horwath advised HFV."
