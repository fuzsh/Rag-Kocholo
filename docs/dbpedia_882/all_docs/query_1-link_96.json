        "text": "Consortium to build lot 1a Battipaglia-Romagnano of Salerno-Reggio Calabria High-Speed Rail and Lot 3 Lercara-Caltanissetta Xirby of Palermo-Catania High-Capacity Rail\n\nBoth contracts to add more than 3,500 jobs to 4,500-strong workforce on group’s ongoing projects in region\n\nWebuild reaches €13.7 bln in news orders acquired, being finalised this year, including €3.5 bln as best offer.\n\nWebuild leads with more than 3,800 businesses in southern Italy, technical and engineering excellence at the country’s service in front of new challenge\n\nWebuild and supply chain serve as strategic asset for Italy’s future and thousands of unemployed youth in southern Italy\n\nMILAN, May 12, 2023 – The Webuild Group and its consortium partners Ghella and Impresa Pizzarotti have won two contracts for a combined value of more than €3.7 billion for the further development of sustainable mobility in southern Italy. As leader of the consortium, the Group has won a contract worth more than €2.0 billion to build a section of a new high-speed railway along the Salerno-Reggio Calabria axis: Lot 1A between Battipaglia and Romagnano. The second contract worth €1.65 billion is for the construction of Lot 3 between Lercara and Caltanissetta Xirbi for the railway between Palermo and Catania.\n\nBoth contracts are commissioned by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) of the FS Italiane Group and financed by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR in Italian). Webuild will lead the consortium involved in the two contracts with a 60% stake, with Ghella having 20% and Impresa Pizzarotti 20%.\n\nWith these two contracts, Webuild reaches €13.7 billion in new orders that are acquired or in the phase of being finalised since the start of the year. The total includes €3.5 billion worth of projects for which the Group has been identified as having the best offer. Most of the orders are from low-risk markets, including Italy, Europe, Australia and the United States.\n\nThe contracts confirm the role played by Webuild and the supply chain for the development and growth of Italy, putting at the country’s service technical and engineering excellence focused on innovation and the application of advanced technology.\n\nThe contracts bring to 19 the number of projects on which the Group is working in southern Italy, involving more than 3,800 suppliers. The projects are strategic for sustainable mobility in Italy – also within the framework of energy transition – that will better connect the northern and southern regions of Italy. They will support the country’s development and growth, improving its competitiveness.\n\nLot 1A of the Salerno-Reggio Calabria axis involves the design and construction of 35 kilometres of rail, along which trains will travel at speeds of up to 300 kilometres per hour. It includes the construction of approximately 14 kilometres of tunnels to be excavated also by tunnel-boring machine (TBM), more than six kilometres of viaducts and nearly five kilometres of artificial tunnels. There will also be a juncture built at Romagnano to connect the new line with the existing one that runs from Battipaglia to Metaponto and Potenza. The contract is expected to create more than 2,000 jobs.\n\nLot 3 Lercara-Caltanissetta Xirbi in Sicily concerns the development of 47 kilometres of new rail, as well as the construction of more than 22 kilometres of tunnels including interconnections, excavated also by tunnel-boring machine. There will also be 11 kilometres of viaducts, 32 kilometres of roadwork and the renovation of the Vallelunga station. An estimated 1,500 jobs are to be created, directly and indirectly. The Group is working on five other lots along the new railway that will connect Palermo, Catania and Messina, involving more than 580 direct suppliers from the start of works to today, half of which are from the region. These lots are the Bicocca-Catenanuova, Nuova Enna-Dittaino and Caltanissetta Xirbi-Nuova Enna between Palermo and Catania; and the Taormina-Giampilieri and Fiumefreddo-Taormina/Letojanni between Catania and Messina."
