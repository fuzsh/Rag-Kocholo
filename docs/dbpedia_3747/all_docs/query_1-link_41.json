        "text": "This 20th anniversary reissue marks the first time Human Clay has been available since the original limited pressing in 1999. Though the Tallahassee, FL–based band had already found enormous success on the rock charts with their multiplatinum-selling 1997 debut, Human Clay would make them mainstream stars. Driven by the anthemic, first single “Higher,” Human Clay debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200, and Creed quickly became one of the biggest bands in the world. “Higher” spent a whopping 57 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at Number Seven. In July of the following year, the band scored their first Number One hit on the pop charts with the third single, “With Arms Wide Open.” The track—which frontman Scott Stapp wrote when he found out that he was going to be a father—earned the band a GRAMMY for Best Rock Song in 2001.\n\nTo-date, Human Clay has sold well over 11 million copies in the U.S., earning a rare Diamond certification from the RIAA, joining the ranks of the Beatles’ Abbey Road, Prince’s Purple Rain and Nirvana’s Nevermind. It remains one of the top-selling albums of all-time in the United States.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nA1. Are You Ready?\n\nA2. What If?\n\nA3. Beautiful\n\nB1. Say I\n\nB2. Wrong Way\n\nB3.
