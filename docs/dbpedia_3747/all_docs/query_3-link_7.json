        "text": "In Week 1, we presented the seven pieces of Primal Branding®, which we call the Primal Code® (creation story, creed, icons, rituals, lexicon, nonbelievers, and leader) and we talked about the first piece, the Creation Story. Once we know where you’re from, we want to know what you’re all about.\n\nIn Week 2 we’re here to reveal the second piece of Primal Code: the Creed. Why are you here?\n\nThere are at least 100,000 books that hope to explain how you can find your purpose in life. Google it. It’s presumptuous to suggest that 100,000 books can be boiled down into a few sentences, but it comes down to this:\n\nWhat do you believe in?\n\nSpecifically, What core beliefs or values drive you and your music? Why do you create music? Are you driven to make art, or driven to become successful? (The former works, the latter does not; both joined together become secret sauce.)\n\nMore specifically, What makes you different from everyone else?\n\nBe committed to something. Not only do we want to belong to something larger than ourselves, but in a world that becomes increasingly thinner, we need something to believe in.\n\nKeep your promises. It is amazing that most people don’t. So please do."
