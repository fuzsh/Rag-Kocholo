        "text": "While Creed is in the midst of a resurgence with a World Series anthem for the Texas Rangers and an extensive reunion tour plotted for this summer, Scott Stapp is unleashing his own set of new music. Higher Power, his fourth solo record and his second on metal-centric Napalm Records, doesn’t stray from the Creed sound. There are riff-heavy hard-rockers, stadium-ready anthems and some introspective balladry.\n\nVocally, his vocal timbre is strong; a deep growl that’s been a signature for decades. Time has added a smokey layer to Stapp’s voice that provides more depth, especially on the more vulnerable ballads. The 50-year-old sounds refreshed and reinvigorated throughout the 10-song set, which shows off his dynamic range in different ways.\n\nWith Creed, Scott Stapp plays off of guitar virtuoso Mark Tremonti, laying down memorable solos and fretboard-punishing guitar riffs. Here, he taps frequent collaborator and Greek guitar god Yiannis Papadopoulos to take on a similar role. Papadopoulos delivers the goods with blistering solos on brooding mid-tempo rocker “What I Deserve” and hard rocker “Quicksand.”\n\nAs the title suggests, the album has religious connotation and imagery, though in many cases there’s an ambiguity to the message that leaves songs open to interpretation.\n\n“Waiting for love to come and take my hand/ It’s over my head/ I’m sinking in quicksand/ Love come and take me to the promised land,” Stapp sings on “Quicksand.” His voice, hitting a low baritone, recalls that of Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder.\n\nThe title track, which opens the album, explodes right out of the gate. It takes the hard rock formula and pushes it a few steps into the heavier direction, with Stapp reaching a near scream leading into the track’s bridge.\n\n“Deadman’s Trigger” fuses that hard rock mindset with a bluesy stomp that digs deeper into the post-grunge aesthetic. At times, Higher Power sounds like it could have been released during the height of the post-grunge era of the early aughts. “When Love is Not Enough” is one of the most effective tracks on the record in mixing the heaviness and power with a sentiment and an impassioned delivery.\n\nParticularly poignant “If These Walls Could Talk,” with Dorothy Martin of rock group Dorothy, tackles addiction. That’s especially prescient, given the two singers’ personal struggles. The two powerhouse vocalists mesh well on the acoustic-laden track.\n\n“They’ve seen me pick the bottle up and put the Bible down/ They’ve heard me crying out more times than I can count,” they sing in harmony.\n\n“Black Butterfly” delivers not only heaviness and infectiousness, but mixes in interesting instrumentation, including what sounds like a sitar.\n\nThe record’s most interesting and most adventurous moments come in the closing trio of songs, offering up a fascinating softer side of Scott Stapp. “You’re Not Alone” is nearly all acoustic and has a swaying pub-like quality that has him pushing his voice to its limits. “Dancing In the Rain” is a lighters-in-the-air ballad with a rock and roll punch. Mid-tempo hard rock ballad “Weight of the World” concludes the album.\n\nBoth Creed and Stapp have long been staples within the rock world, but it’s unlikely that Higher Power will grab new listeners. Those who love the sound will eat it up."
