        "text": "Creed is an American post-grunge band that was active from 1993-2004 and reunited from 2009-2012. After disbanding in 2003, everyone except lead singer Scott Stapp forming Alter Bridge with Myles Kennedy on vocals. Creed has been negatively received by some critics and listeners; readers of Rolling Stone magazine ranked the band as \"the worst artist of the 1990s\".\n\nBand Members\n\nScott Stapp (vocals) (1994-2004 ; 2009-2012 ; 2023-)\n\nMark Tremonti (guitar) (1994-2004 ; 2009-2012 ; 2023-)\n\nBrian Marshall (bass) (1994-2000 ; 2009-2012 ; 2023-)\n\nScott Phillips (drums) (1994-2004 ; 2009-2012 ; 2023-)\n\nBad Qualities\n\nThey were called a rip-off of Pearl Jam due to their frontman, Scott Stapp, sounding like Eddie Vedder and his voice is very unintelligible, annoying, and just overall miserable to listen to.\n\nTremonti's, Philips', and Marshall's talents are completely wasted in the later records.\n\nDuring their 2009 reunion tour, ticket sales were so poor that they costed less than a dollar.\n\nCreed's music was criticized for trying to be Christian as their lyrics consists of overused and generic power-ballad lyrics and themes.\n\nOn December 29, 2002 while performing at Allstate Arena, Stapp was so inebriated to the point where he ACTUALLY passed out mid-performance and audience members threatened to sue the band.\n\nTheir original name was \"Naked Toddler\".\n\nTheir album covers are horrendous, especially for their albums Human Clay and Weathered.\n\nA lot of their songs sound the same.\n\nTheir production is generic, dull, and half the time boring.\n\nScott Stapp's behavior began to spiral out of control as he got into legal troubles over the years. Thankfully, he got help and is trying to move on.\n\nGood Qualities\n\nMark Tremonti is a talented guitarist.\n\nThe band's side project without Scott Stapp, Alter Bridge, is a major improvement.\n\nThey have some good songs like \"What If\", \"Are You Ready\", \"Never Die\", and \"Beautiful\".\n\nThey helped put their record label, Wind-Up Records, on the map.\n\nTheir music videos (while awful) are well shot.\n\nTheir first album, My Own Prison is considered to be their best by Rocked.\n\nTrivia\n\nTheir infamously terrible performance at The Allstate Stadium (now Allstate Arena) is considered\n\nDiscography"
