        "text": "Scott Stapp obviously thinks he deserves to be a rock god. The frontman for Creed, the Florida-based band that packed Madison Square Garden on Monday and plays a sold-out show tomorrow at Jones Beach, works to project the aura of a champion.\n\nAt the Garden, in a gleaming white shirt and leather hip-huggers that would have delighted his idol, Jim Morrison, Mr. Stapp made so many heroic moves, it seemed as if this was his qualifying routine for the frontman olympics. He pranced and crouched and swept his arms heavenward, straining his enormous baritone, a foghorn warning all contenders to watch out for his wake.\n\nThe Garden audience clearly supported his victory bid. Roaring along so enthusiastically that Mr. Stapp could regularly take microphone breaks and let them take over songs, Creed's fans reached their zenith on ''Higher,'' which rivals Santana's ''Smooth'' as the people's song of the moment. Audience members didn't just sing: they emoted, some nearly weeping, others raising their hands as if undergoing a conversion.\n\nMr. Stapp was raised in the Pentecostal faith, and although he says he is not a practicing Christian, his lyrics resound with a doubting Thomas's fear of God. ''Higher,'' which he says is about lucid dreaming, still has a decidedly biblical chorus about golden streets where blind men see. Such images are the meat of Christian popular culture and have contributed to the band's phenomenal success.\n\nThat success is evident in the numbers. Creed's two albums, ''My Own Prison'' (1998) and ''Human Clay'' (1999), have sold a total of nearly 10 million copies, each spending almost a year on the Billboard charts. ''Higher'' is still in the Top 20 singles after 44 weeks, despite having never been officially released in that form.\n\nThe sales are all the more notable because the band records for an independent label, Wind-Up, as do the much-touted teenage stars on Jive and the hip-hop artists on Cash Money and No Limit.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
