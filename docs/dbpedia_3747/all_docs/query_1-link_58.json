        "text": "One of the greatest rock bands of the 90s and early 2000s has just announced their return, and before everyone gets their tickets for Creed, I thought we would do something fun here.\n\nThe Texas Rangers have just won the World Series and it has been well publicized that the main motivation for their historic run was due to the sweet and smooth vocals of Scott Stapp, and more specifically, the official anthem of 1999, Creed’s hit song, “Higher.”\n\nThe Rangers aren’t the only team to take advantage of the spiritual cheat code that is Creed. The Minnesota Vikings also utilized a gem from the “Human Clay” album in, “With Arms Wide Open,” as quarterback Kirk Cousins mentioned this song as the main reason for their victory over the Chicago Bears.\n\nI want to find the best Creed song for every Big Ten team and with such a large, diverse, and just straight up historic catalog, it should be easy. Let’s have a little fun, shall we?"
