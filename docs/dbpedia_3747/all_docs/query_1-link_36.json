        "text": "\"The odds were against me all along, but I just wouldn't go away.\" All-American musician Creed Fisher is a storyteller, hard worker, and a rising Outlaw Country star. With around 100 million streams on Spotify and nearly 60 million views on YouTube, Fisher’s raw, unfiltered, and unique sound blends traditional country with some modern elements.\n\nAfter growing up in West Texas, he played professional football for around 9 years. When he retired from the game, Fisher used that passion and drive to fuel his music and convert his scars & pain into passion and determination. \"A big part of my music is patriotic and for the working class. I relate to my music because I lived it.\" Creed Fisher reminds fans to never lose sight of who you are, where you’re from, and never fear hard work. His patriotism and life experiences thread throughout his songs to create powerful music that speaks to all."
