        "text": "Game 3 of the Rangers-Orioles ALDS may sound like a Creed concert.\n\nBefore Texas took a 2-0 series lead over top-seeded Baltimore, Rangers pitcher Andrew Heaney revealed that the club started listening to the rock band Creed pregame in order to loosen things up amid an up-and-down second half of the regular season.\n\nThat pregame ritual continued as Texas secured its first postseason berth since 2016 before sweeping the Tampa Bay Rays for the franchise's first playoff series victory since 2011.\n\nNow, the Rangers are set to play their first home game of the 2023 playoffs, sitting just one win away from the ALCS. And Heaney is hoping to hear Creed's music, accompanied by Rangers fans singing along, at Globe Life Field this week (h/t Rangers play-by-play announcer Jared Sandler).\n\nSo any Rangers fans planning to attend Game 3 on Tuesday (or Game 4 on Wednesday if necessary) might want to brush up on Creed's discography.\n\nBelieve it or not, the Rangers aren't the first sports team to adopt Creed's music as their unofficial soundtrack.\n\nTexas Rangers - World Series Champions\n\nEx-NFL tight end Greg Olsen said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the 2015 NFC champion Carolina Panthers also listened to Creed, and lead singer Scott Stapp was even going to attend the team's afterparty had Carolina defeated the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50. Olsen called it one of his \"biggest regrets\" and wished the Rangers better luck.\n\nThe Rangers are surely hoping Creed's music can take them higher than just a World Series appearance."
