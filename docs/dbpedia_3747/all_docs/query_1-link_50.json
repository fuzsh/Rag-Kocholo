        "text": "Update (July 18): This article has been updated with Creed’s latest setlist.\n\nCreed are ready to take their setlist higher for the Summer of ’99 Tour, the alternative rock band’s triumphant return from a 12-year hiatus. After several sold-out shows on the Summer of ’99 cruise in April, the founding quartet of vocalist Scott Stapp, guitarist Mark Tremonti, bassist Brian Marshall and drummer Scott Phillips will reconvene for the Summer of ’99 Tour in July, followed by the group’s inaugural Summer Of ’99 And Beyond Festival in San Bernardino, California and the North American Are You Ready? Tour launching in November.\n\nIn a statement, Stapp shared his excitement, saying, “I feel like I’m as strong as I’ve ever been vocally, and looking forward to sharing the stage with the guys again. The fans have clearly let us know they feel it’s long overdue. I want to give them what they deserve. I’m ready to bring it.”\n\nThe Summer of ’99 Tour — which kicked off on July 17 in Green Bay, Wisconsin — takes the “One Last Breath” band down memory lane as they celebrate the summer of their 1999 breakout sophomore album Human Clay, which has since been certified 11-times platinum. Completing the nostalgia tour is a rotating support roster of rock contemporaries like 3 Doors Down, Daughtry, Finger Eleven and Switchfoot.\n\nFor fans looking to know what to expect from a Creed tour in 2024, including the average setlist, welcome to this place, we’ll show you everything below.\n\nCreed Tour Stats\n\nCurrent tour: Summer of ’99 Tour (2024)\n\nSet time: On their 2024 Summer of ’99 Tour, Creed has taken the stage at on stage around 9:10 p.m., though set times vary.\n\nLength of average Creed show: 1 hour, 45 minutes (at the Summer of ’99 Tour)\n\nPast tours:\n\n2 Nights Live (2012)\n\nCreed: Live on Tour (2012)\n\nThe 20-10 Tour (2010)\n\nFull Circle Tour (2009–2010)\n\nWeathered Tour (2002)\n\nHuman Clay Tour (1999–2001)\n\nMy Own Prison Tour (1997–1999)\n\nCreed Discography:\n\nMy Own Prison (1997)\n\nHuman Clay (1999)\n\nWeathered (2001)\n\nFull Circle (2009)\n\nCreed’s Popular Songs:\n\n“One Last Breath”\n\n“Higher”\n\n“My Sacrifice”\n\n“With Arms Wide Open”\n\n“My Own Prison”\n\nCreed – The Summer Of ’99 Tour\n\nCreed’s Recent Opening Acts:\n\nSwitchfoot\n\nFinger Eleven\n\n3 Doors Down\n\nDaughtry\n\nFuel\n\nVertical Horizon\n\nCreed Concert Setlist Info\n\nAfter nearly a decade away from the stage, Creed fans undoubtedly have high expectations for the setlist during the Summer of ’99 Tour.
