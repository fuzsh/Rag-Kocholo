        "text": "As one of the last bands standing after the grunge wave in the ‘90s, Creed’s unabashed rock sold millions of albums worldwide and solidified them as one of the decade’s most successful bands. In 1997, members Scott Stapp, Mark Tremonti, Brian Marshall, and Scott Phillips recorded their debut album My Own Prison beginning an epic string of albums earning Creed multiple spots on various Billboard charts, a Grammy for Best Rock Song (2001’s “With Arms Wide Open”) and the rare RIAA Diamond certification for selling 11 million albums of Human Clay. In 2004 the band went on an official hiatus with Stapp venturing into solo work while the remaining members formed Alter Bridge. They reunited in 2009 for a tour in support of their latest album, Full Circle."
