        "text": "The Overview:\n\nThe Texas Rangers' journey to their first World Series championship in 2023 was a narrative of monumental triumph against overwhelming odds, intertwined with the resurgence of rock band Creed and their iconic hit “Higher.” This convergence of sports and music not only crafted an unforgettable story but also highlighted the power of an underdog.\n\nEntering the season, the Rangers faced staggering preseason odds of +5000 to win the World Series, tying them for 17th according to SportsOddsHistory. Such odds marked them as one of the least likely teams to clinch the title, making their victory the most improbable since the 2003 Florida Marlins, who won with +7500 preseason odds. This context underscores the Rangers' extraordinary journey from long-shots to World Series champions.\n\nAmidst this backdrop of unlikely success, the Rangers' adoption of Creed’s “Higher” as their anthem became a symbol of their tenacity and unity. Beginning as a means to uplift spirits during a mid-season slump, the song evolved into a powerful team ritual. This practice, highlighted by pitcher Andrew Heaney, transcended the confines of the locker room to resonate with fans, particularly during home playoff games where a stadium-wide singalong turned the song into a shared anthem of hope and resilience.\n\nCreed's timely response to their music's impact was both strategic and heartfelt. Recognizing their role in this stirring sports narrative, the band appeared at the World Series and supported the team heavily across social media. In fact, they also released a ‘stadium anthems playlist’ with the Texas Rangers logo inspired cover art, smartly bridging their past hits with their newfound popularity in Texas.\n\nUnderstanding The Artist(s) Involved:\n\nCreed, a rock band originating from Tallahassee, Florida, skyrocketed to fame in the late '90s and early 2000s, reshaping the post-grunge music scene. Their ascent was fueled by multi-platinum albums such as \"My Own Prison\" (1997) and the diamond-certified \"Human Clay\" (1999). Known for anthemic hits like \"Higher\" and the Grammy-winning \"With Arms Wide Open,\" Creed quickly became synonymous with the era’s sound.\n\nTheir foray into the sports world began in 2010 when lead singer Scott Stapp contributed \"Marlins Will Soar\" for the Miami Marlins, demonstrating the band’s cultural versatility. After a hiatus and a 2009 reunion, Creed experienced a resurgence in 2023, fueled by the Texas Rangers' World Series run and their embrace of Creed's music.\n\nThis renewed popularity led to \"The Summer of '99 Tour,\" slated for 2024, which is set to be Creed's largest tour in over a decade. This tour, eagerly anticipated in both music and sports circles, highlights Creed’s sustained impact. The synergy of their music with sports underscores their lasting appeal and is a catalyst for the buzz surrounding the tour. Creed's upcoming tour in 2024, blending sports enthusiasm with musical legacy, stands as a testament to the unifying power of music and sports.\n\nOur Key Insights:\n\nUtilizing Chartmetric and Google Trends data the Beats + Bytes team discovered that since October 8th:\n\nMonthly Listeners on Spotify for Creed grew by 1.34%, resulting in a total gain of 84,108 new fans (see graph below).\n\nShazam tags for Creed's \"Higher\" increased by 1.41%, resulting in 20,212 new tags following the Texas Rangers endorsement of Creed (see graph below).\n\nThe Texas Rangers’ endorsement precipitated a staggering 477.8% increase in searches for ‘Higher’ on YouTube (see graph below)\n\nConcomitantly, there was a 422.2% escalation in web searches for 'Higher' by Creed (see graph below)\n\nCreed’s official band channel on Instagram witnessed a significant 90.39% uptick in followers, culminating in an addition of 94,958 new followers (see graph below)\n\nThe song ‘Higher’ experienced a 2.07% increase in streaming activity on Spotify, resulting in an accumulation of an additional 4,212,917 streams since October 8th (see graph below)\n\nCreed’s fandom in the state of Texas ballooned, with Creed’s Spotify monthly listeners growing in Dallas (+8.81%), San Antonio (+3.29%), and Houston (+4.10%). This was a big market gain, seeing that Creed is stopping in 3 separate cities in Texas during their 2024 reunion tour (see graph below).\n\nThe Takeaway:\n\nMusic's capacity to inspire, motivate, and build confidence is a powerful force, especially evident in sports. This impact was clearly demonstrated by the Texas Rangers' use of Creed’s “Higher” during their 2023 World Series run. Their choice of anthem showcased how music can rally and unite a team under immense pressure.\n\nSports psychology expert Costas Karageorghis highlights the importance of music's tempo in aligning with an athlete's heart rate, enhancing performance. His insight, \"Music can activate people in a way that other things cannot,\" emphasizes the unique role of music in athletic settings, a key factor in the Rangers' strategic selection of Creed's energizing song.\n\nThe Rangers' adoption of \"Higher\" illustrates how music transcends auditory pleasure, becoming integral to mental preparation and team cohesion. The symbiotic relationship between Creed and the Rangers – the team finding a unifying anthem and Creed experiencing a resurgence – demonstrates the mutual benefits of such collaborations. This partnership not only led to a sports triumph but also underscored the unifying and motivating capacity of music.\n\nFrom this inspiring collaboration, two key takeaways emerge for sports teams across leagues:\n\nIdentify an Anthem: Teams should consider choosing a song that resonates with their ethos and journey, fostering unity and purpose among their fanbase. Simply put, nothing brings fans, players, and an organization closer together than a powerful and purposeful sonic logo.\n\nHarness the Power of The Superfan: Aligning team activities with music that matches a moment can not only bring fans and players together, but it can encourage super fans of an artist to buy into a sports team they may have not been as familiar with before. We saw this at the most prominent level when Taylor Swift encouraging her Swiftie fanbase to adopt the NFL's Chiefs as their own.
