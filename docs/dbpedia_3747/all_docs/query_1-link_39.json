        "text": "The Texas Rangers have found their groove, and their theme music. The uplifting music from the band Creed has fueled them this postseason, and their recent listening habits are catching on with others.\n\nThe Rangers, which this week clinched their first American League Championship Series berth since 2011, have made the Scott Stapp-led band part of their best season in years. The band’s 1999 hit song “Higher” (one of the team’s favorites) has been blasted during games at Globe Life Field, while Creed itself has approved of the Rangers’ success catapulting their old catalog into relevance again.\n\nAlbum consumption for the band’s catalog is up 16% over the last four tracking weeks (Sept. 8-Oct. 5) in the Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth area. That’s according to Luminate, an insights company which tracks music and entertainment data. While there haven’t been significant streaming boosts nationally, “Higher” saw a jump in on-demand streams (+7) locally.\n\nRangers pitcher Andrew Heaney says the team started having more fun and playing Creed music, with fans echoing the lyrics, during the second half of the season. The more laid-back approach helped the team enter the postseason with newfound momentum.\n\n“When things are going good, you tend to stick with what works,” said Full Stop Management artist manager Adam Harrison, who represents several artists including Big Boi. “People are superstitious. If the song works when you win, you’re going to keep going. Sports and music are tied to each other.”\n\nAtlanta-based rapper and producer Big Boi’s song “All Night” became the unofficial theme song during the Tampa Bay Lightning’s championship run two years ago. Big Boi not only saw an increase in streams at the time but also was invited to return to Amalie Arena this week to headline a pregame party.\n\n“It’s beneficial to the artist when a sports team picks [their music] up as an anthem,” Harrison said. “We feel love when we come to that town and when we’re aligned with a certain team. There are ways to build upon those moments.”\n\nThe Rangers are the latest example of how the power of moments in sports can take mediocre or once-popular songs and spark passion for them. Another MLB team, the New York Mets, saw this firsthand with Timmy Trumpet’s “Narco” song, which closer Edwin Diaz trots out to during his pitching entrance. “Narco,” which became a viral hit, experienced a spike in streams last summer with help from social media.\n\nIt’s unclear how long the Rangers can keep climbing higher, as they’re set to face the defending champion Houston Astros, which are making their seventh straight trip to the ALCS. But backed by a productive pitching rotation and stars like Marcus Semien, the Rangers hope to reach their first World Series since 2011."
