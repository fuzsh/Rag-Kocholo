Bad Qualities

They were called a rip-off of Pearl Jam due to their frontman, Scott Stapp, sounding like Eddie Vedder and his voice is very unintelligible, annoying, and just overall miserable to listen to.

Tremonti's, Philips', and Marshall's talents are completely wasted in the later records.

During their 2009 reunion tour, ticket sales were so poor that they costed less than a dollar.

Creed's music was criticized for trying to be Christian as their lyrics consists of overused and generic power-ballad lyrics and themes.

On December 29, 2002 while performing at Allstate Arena, Stapp was so inebriated to the point where he ACTUALLY passed out mid-performance and audience members threatened to sue the band.

Their original name was "Naked Toddler".

Their album covers are horrendous, especially for their albums Human Clay and Weathered.

A lot of their songs sound the same.

Their production is generic, dull, and half the time boring.

Scott Stapp's behavior began to spiral out of control as he got into legal troubles over the years. Thankfully, he got help and is trying to move on.

Good Qualities

Mark Tremonti is a talented guitarist.

The band's side project without Scott Stapp, Alter Bridge, is a major improvement.

They have some good songs like "What If", "Are You Ready", "Never Die", and "Beautiful".

They helped put their record label, Wind-Up Records, on the map.

Their music videos (while awful) are well shot.

Their first album, My Own Prison is considered to be their best by Rocked.

Trivia

Their infamously terrible performance at The Allstate Stadium (now Allstate Arena) is considered
