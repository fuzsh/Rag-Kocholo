        "text": "Associations of ICOS and PD.1 Gene Variants with Colon Cancer Risk in The Iranian Population\n\nPubMed\n\nShamsdin, Seyedeh Azra; Karimi, Mohammad Hossein; Hosseini, Seyed Vahid; Geramizadeh, Bita; Fattahi, Mohamad Reza; Mehrabani, Davood; Moravej, Ali\n\n2018-03-27\n\nBackground: Positive and negative co-stimulatory molecules are important factors determining the outcome of immune responses to the presence of tumors. Since co-stimulatory molecule expression may be affected by gene polymorphisms, we aimed to investigate associations between variants of PD.1 and ICOS and susceptibility to colon cancer. Material and methods: ICOS (-693A/G), ICOS (+1720C/T) and PD.1 (-538G/A) gene polymorphisms were evaluated by the PCR-RFLP method in 76 colon cancer patients and 73 healthy controls. Results: The frequencies of the GG genotype and the G allele at position -693 of the ICOS gene were significantly higher in the patient group (P=0.014 and p=0.0002), while the AA genotype was significantly more common in controls (P=0.0016). At position -538 of PD.1, GG genotype and G allele frequencies were higher in the patient group (P<0.0001and P<0.0001). Again, AA and also AG genotypes significantly predominated in controls (P<0.0001 and P=0.012). Regarding genotypes and alleles of ICOS at position +1720. Frequencies of GCG and GTG haplotypes were higher in patients compared to those of controls (P=0.016 and P<0.0001), while, frequencies of GTA, ATA and ATG haplotypes were higher in controls (P=0.0017, P<0.0001 and P=0.015). GTG/GTG and GTG/GCG double haplotypes were more frequent in patients compared to controls (P=0.0147 and P=0.0071). Conclusion: Our study clarified that PD.1 (-538G/A) and ICOS (-693A/G) gene polymorphisms can be considered as genetic risk factors for the development of colon cancer among Iranian patients.

In this article, we report on two novel mouse anti-human ICOS-L monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) named as 11C4 and 12B11, whose specificities were verified by methods of flow cytometry, western blotting, and epitope competition assay. The two mAbs bound to distinct ICOS-L epitopes on B cells. Interestingly, mAb 11C4 could well recognize ICOS-L molecule on activated T cells and Jurkat cell lines, which is different from commercial anti-ICOS-L mAb (clone number MIH12) and the other mAb 12B11. In addition, we found that the expression of ICOS-L molecule was only detected on the surface of immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) and was sharply decreased after induction of mature Mo-DCs activated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha or CD40. Furthermore, we showed that 11C4 could effectively suppress the maturation of Mo-DCs in vitro as evidenced by the low expression of CD80, CD86, CD83, and human leukocyte antigen-DR, which suggested that ICOS-L may be involved in the maturation of Mo-DCs. Using immunohistochemistry staining with mAb 11C4, the expression of ICOS-L was found in B lymphoma tissues and thyroid tissues from the Grave's disease but not in thyroid adenoma and normal thyroid tissues.\n\nEDITORIAL: Selected papers from ICO XIX\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nConsortini, Anna; Righini, Giancarlo C.\n\n2003-09-01\n\nICO XIX was the 19th in a series of triennial congresses promoted by the International Commission for Optics (ICO) and held in conjunction with the general assembly of the organization. ICO is an affiliated commission of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and was created in 1947 with the object of contributing on an international basis to the progress and diffusion of knowledge in optics. ICO I, the first official congress held in Delft (The Netherlands) in July 1948, saw the participation of 44 delegates from 11 countries. ICO XIX, held in Florence (Italy) in August 2002, was attended by more than 400 participants from most of the 43 Territorial Committees which are current members of ICO. The triennial congress moves quite regularly from one continent to another; thus, the previous one (ICO XVIII) was held in San Francisco (USA) in 1999, and the next one (ICO XX) will be held in Changchun, a city in northern China, in 2005. Optics is growing up fast and healthily. To quote John N Howard, founding editor of Applied Optics, 'Optics is almost unique in being both a field of challenging scientific study and also an important tool that can be applied to many other fields of science and technology.' A confirmation of that comes from the results of a poll on the most beautiful physics experiment, published in Physics World in September 2002. The top place was awarded to the application of Young's double-slit experiment to the interference of single electrons (demonstrated by C Jonsson in 1961), while two 'pure' optical experiments ranked 4th and 5thârespectively, Newton's decomposition of sunlight with a prism (which dates back to around 1665) and Young's original light interference experiment (around 1801). Similarly, if we look to the years since the founding of the ICO, many of the Nobel Prizes in physics have been awarded for works in optics and spectroscopy, including, to mention just a few winners, Zernike and Gabor in image formation\n\nImproved Conceptual Models Methodology (ICoMM) for Validation of Non-Observable Systems\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-12-01\n\ndistribution is unlimited IMPROVED CONCEPTUAL MODELS METHODOLOGY (ICoMM) FOR VALIDATION OF NON-OBSERVABLE SYSTEMS by Sang M.

The chart of nuclides is a more descriptive version of the periodic table that can be used to visualize nuclear properties such as half-lives and mass. We have created ICoN (simply short for Interactive Chart of Nuclides), an API which can be used to visualize theoretical and experimental datasets. This visualization is achieved by using D3 (Data Driven Documents), HTML, and CSS3 to plot the elements and color them accordingly. ICoN features many customization options that users can access that are dynamically applied to the chart without reloading the page. Users can save the customized chart they create to various formats. We have constructed these features in order to provide a unique approach for researchers to interface with nuclear data. ICoN can also be used on all electronic devices without loss of support. We report on the current progress of this project and will present a working demo that highlights each aspect of the aforementioned features. This is the first time that all available technologies are put to use to make nuclear data more accessible than ever before. This is a first and we will make it available as open source ware.\n\nData policy for data sets from various sources: recent developments in the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVermeulen, A. T.; Kutsch, W. L.; Lavric, J. V.; Juurola, E.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFluxnet is facing a transition from single PI and project engagement to a cooperation of infrastructures such as ICOS, Ameriflux, NEON, Chinaflux or TERN. Each of these infrastructures has developed its own data life cycle, data license and data policy which will have implications on future cooperation within Fluxnet and other global data integration efforts such as e.g. SOCAt in the ocean community. This presentation will introduce into the recent developments of the ICOS data policy and show perspectives for future cooperation in global networks. The challenge in developing the ICOS data policy has been to find the best compromise between optimized access for users and sufficient visibility and acknowledgement of data providers. ICOS data will be provided under the Creative Commons 4.0 BY license. ICOS data will be provided through the ICOS Carbon Portal. Data usage will be absolutely unrestricted. Data have only to be attributed as ICOS data. With the attribution ICOS will provide a persistent identifier (pid, sometimes also nominated as digial object identifier, doi) that will direct to a landing page where data provider and if necessary also funding organisations are identified. In cooperation with other environmental research infrastructures in the framework of the European cluster project ENVRIplus and the Research Data Alliance (RDA) the ICOS Carbon Portal is currently developing a data citation system. This includes developing recommendations for data citation of integrated data sets from different sources.\n\nIntegrated Composite Stiffener Structure (ICoSS) Concept for Planetary Entry Vehicles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKellas, Sotiris\n\n2016-01-01\n\nResults from the design, manufacturing, and testing of a lightweight Integrated Composite Stiffened Structure (ICoSS) concept, intended for multi-mission planetary entry vehicles are presented. Tests from both component and full-scale tests for a typical Earth Entry Vehicle forward shell manufactured using the ICoSS concept are presented and advantages of the concept for the particular application of passive Earth Entry Vehicles over other structural concepts are discussed.\n\nB cells in T Follicular Helper Cell Development and Function: Separable Roles in Delivery of ICOS Ligand and Antigen\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWeinstein, Jason S.; Bertino, Sarah A.; Hernandez, Sairy G.; Poholek, Amanda C.; Teplitzky, Taylor B.; Nowyhed, Heba N.; Craft, Joe\n\n2014-01-01\n\nB cells are required for follicular helper T (Tfh) cell development, as is the ligand for ICOS (ICOS-L); however, the separable contributions of Ag and ICOS-L delivery by cognate B cells to Tfh-cell development and function are unknown. We find that Tfh-cell and germinal center differentiation are dependent upon cognate B-cell display of ICOS-L, but only when Ag presentation by the latter is limiting, with the requirement for B-cell expression of ICOS-L overcome by robust Ag delivery. These findings demonstrate that Ag-specific B cells provide different, yet compensatory signals for Tfh-cell differentiation, while reconciling conflicting data indicating a requirement for ICOS-L expression on cognate B cells for Tfh-cell development with those demonstrating this requirement could be bypassed in lieu of that tendered by non-cognate B cells. Our findings clarify the separable roles of delivery of Ag and ICOS-L by cognate B cells for Tfh-cell maturation and function, and have implications for using therapeutic ICOS blockade in settings of abundantly available Ag, such as in systemic autoimmunity.

In mammals, the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and deep tectal regions control the expression of TI as well as other defensive behaviors. In birds, little is known about the mesencephalic circuitry involved in the control of TI. Here, adult pigeons (both sex, nÂ =Â 4/group), randomly assigned to non-handled, handled or TI groups, were killed 90Â min after manipulations and the brains processed for detection of c-Fos immunoreactive cells (c-Fos-ir, marker for neural activity) in the mesencephalic central gray (GCt) and the adjacent nucleus intercollicularis (ICo). The NADPH-diaphorase staining delineated the boundaries of the sub nuclei in the ICo-GCt complex. Compared to non-handled, TI (but not handling) induced c-Fos-ir in NADPH-diaphorase-rich and -poor regions. After TI, the number of c-Fos-ir increased in the caudal and intermediate areas of the ICo (but not in the GCt), throughout the rostrocaudal axis of the dorsal stratum griseum periventriculare (SGPd) of the optic tectum and in the n. mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis (MLd), which is part of the ascending auditory pathway. These data suggest that inescapable threatening stimuli such as TI may recruit neurons in discrete areas of ICo-GCt complex, deep tectal layer and in ascending auditory circuits that may control the expression of defensive behaviors in pigeons. Additionally, data indicate that the contiguous deep tectal SCPd (but not GCt) in birds may be functionally comparable to the mammalian dorsal PAG.\n\nICOS regulates the pool of group 2 innate lymphoid cells under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nPaclik, Daniela; Stehle, Christina; Lahmann, Annette; Hutloff, Andreas; Romagnani, Chiara\n\n2015-10-01\n\nGroup 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are innate effectors playing an important role in the defense against helminthic infections and in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. Cytokines have been identified as the major stimuli driving ILC2 activation and expansion. Conversely, it is unclear whether costimulatory molecules contribute to regulation of ILC2 functions. ILC2s display high expression of inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS), which belongs to the CD28 superfamily, and which has been shown to control late effector T-cell functions, and is of utmost importance for the humoral immune response. However, the biological function of ICOS expression on ILC2s is unknown. Here, we show that ICOS signaling in mice regulates ILC2 homeostasis independently of T cells and B cells, by promoting proliferation and accumulation of mature ILC2s in lung and intestine. In a model of IL-33-induced airway inflammation, ICOS controls ILC2 activation and eosinophil infiltration in the lung. Our data identify a role of ICOS in innate immunity and indicate that not only cytokines, but also costimulatory pathways such as those involving ICOS, can contribute to regulate the ILC2 pool. Thus, ICOS costimulation blockade, which is currently under clinical evaluation for inhibiting the humoral immune response, could also target innate inflammatory circuits.

V.; Juurola, E.; Vermeulen, A. T.; Kutsch, W. L.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn a world that is undergoing climate change and is increasingly impacted by human influence, the need for globally integrated observations of greenhouse gases (GHG) and independent evaluation of their fluxes is becoming increasingly pressing. Since the 2015 COP21 meeting in Paris, such observation systems are also demanded by global stakeholders and policy makers. For successful monitoring and implementation of mitigation measures, the behavior of natural carbon pools must be well understood, the human carbon emission inventories better constrained, and the interaction between the two better studied. The Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS), currently comprising 12 member countries, is a European domain-overarching distributed research infrastructure dedicated to providing freely accessible long-term, high-quality data and data products on greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets and their evolution in terrestrial ecosystems, oceans and atmosphere. ICOS was built on the foundations of nationally-operated in-situ measurement facilities and modelling efforts. Today, it consists of National Networks, Central Facilities, and the European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ICOS ERIC), founded in November 2015. The long-term objective of ICOS is to remain independent, sustainable, on the forefront of scientific and technological development, and to find a good balance between scientific interests on one side and expectations of policy makers and society on the other. On the global scale, ICOS seeks to interlink with complementary research infrastructures (e.g. ACTRIS, IAGOS, etc.) to form partnerships that maximize the output and the effect of invested resources to the benefit of all stakeholders. A lot of attention will also be given to network design and attracting new partners from regions where such observations are still lacking in order to fill the gaps in the global observation network. In this presentation we present the latest developments concerning ICOS and its\n\nThe parsec-scale relationship between ICO and AV in local molecular clouds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, Cheoljong; Leroy, Adam K.; Bolatto, Alberto D.; Glover, Simon C. O.; Indebetouw, Remy; Sandstrom, Karin; Schruba, Andreas\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe measure the parsec-scale relationship between integrated CO intensity (ICO) and visual extinction (AV) in 24 local molecular clouds using maps of CO emission and dust optical depth from Planck. This relationship informs our understanding of CO emission across environments, but clean Milky Way measurements remain scarce. We find uniform ICO for a given AV, with the results bracketed by previous studies of the Pipe and Perseus clouds. Our measured ICO-AV relation broadly agrees with the standard Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor, the relation found for the Magellanic clouds at coarser resolution, and numerical simulations by Glover & Clark (2016). This supports the idea that CO emission primarily depends on shielding, which protects molecules from dissociating radiation. Evidence for CO saturation at high AV and a threshold for CO emission at low AV varies remains uncertain due to insufficient resolution and ambiguities in background subtraction. Resolution of order 0.1 pc may be required to measure these features. We use this ICO-AV relation to predict how the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (XCO) would change if the Solar Neighbourhood clouds had different dust-to-gas ratio (metallicity). The calculations highlight the need for improved observations of the CO emission threshold and H I shielding layer depth. They are also sensitive to the shape of the column density distribution. Because local clouds collectively show a self-similar distribution, we predict a shallow metallicity dependence for XCO down to a few tenths of solar metallicity. However, our calculations also imply dramatic variations in cloud-to-cloud XCO at subsolar metallicity.\n\nHigher Frequency of CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+PD1+ T Follicular Helper Cells in Patients With Infectious Mononucleosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiu, Jinlin; Zhou, Yonglie; Yu, Qinghua; Zhao, Zhao; Wang, Huan; Luo, Xiaoming; Chen, Yanxia; Zhu, Zhongliang; Chen, Guoqing; Wu, Mao; Qiu, Liannv\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are recognized as a distinct CD4+helper T cell subset, and mainly dysregulated in the autoimmune disease, whether it plays a role in the infectious mononucleosis (IM) diseases is unknown. In this study, we found that the CD4+CXCR5+ Tfh cells were not significantly changed, but the CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+ and CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+PD1+ Tfh subsets were significantly increased in the IM patients, and all these cells were significantly changed after antiviral therapy. Second, only the numbers of CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+PD1+ Tfh cells correlated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA load, negatively correlated with the numbers of naive B cells and amount of IL-21, and positively correlated with the numbers of plasma cells, memory B cells, and atypical lymphocytes. Third, the frequency of CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+PD1+ Tfh subset was significantly higher in lymphadenectasis or hepatosplenomegaly patients, and associated with the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). All together, our findings discovered this CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+PD1+ Tfh cell subset might play an important role in the pathogenesis of IM.

Amphotericin B (AmB) was prepared as a 5âmg/mL dispersion in a mixture of Peceol, Gelucire 44/14 and VitE-TPGS 2,3 (iCo-010). The formulation was protected from light and incubated in a sealed container at 43âÂ°C for 60 days. Mice infected with Candida albicans were treated with either iCo-010 formulation pre-incubated at 43âÂ°C for 60 days or freshly prepared iCo-010 formulation at doses of 5, 10 and 20âmg/kg once daily for five consecutive days. Single intravenous 5âmg/kg dose of AmBisomeÂ® was used as a positive control group. Seven days following the last dose, the kidney, liver, spleen, lung, heart and brain were removed and the number of colony forming units (CFUs) was determined as a measure of tissue fungal load. In addition, the concentration of AmB within each tissue was determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). There were no significant differences in the reduction of CFUs and the concentration of AmB recovered in all organs at all iCo-010 doses tested between the freshly prepared iCo-010 formulation compared to the formulation that was incubated at 43âÂ°C for 60 days. A novel oral AmB formulation, iCo-010, incubated at 43âÂ°C for 60 days to simulate the exposure of the formulation to tropical temperatures remained highly effective against murine systemic candidiasis.\n\nRetrogenic ICOS Expression Increases Differentiation of KLRG-1hiCD127loCD8+ T Cells during Listeria Infection and Diminishes Recall Responses.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Danya; Burd, Eileen M; Coopersmith, Craig M; Ford, Mandy L\n\n2016-02-01\n\nFollowing T cell encounter with Ag, multiple signals are integrated to collectively induce distinct differentiation programs within Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell populations. Several factors contribute to these cell fate decisions, including the amount and duration of Ag, exposure to inflammatory cytokines, and degree of ligation of cosignaling molecules. The ICOS is not expressed on resting T cells but is rapidly upregulated upon encounter with Ag. However, the impact of ICOS signaling on programmed differentiation is not well understood. In this study, we therefore sought to determine the role of ICOS signaling on CD8(+) T cell programmed differentiation. Through the creation of novel ICOS retrogenic Ag-specific TCR-transgenic CD8(+) T cells, we interrogated the phenotype, functionality, and recall potential of CD8(+) T cells that receive early and sustained ICOS signaling during Ag exposure. Our results reveal that these ICOS signals critically impacted cell fate decisions of Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells, resulting in increased frequencies of KLRG-1(hi)CD127(lo) cells, altered BLIMP-1, T-bet, and eomesodermin expression, and increased cytolytic capacity as compared with empty vector controls. Interestingly, however, ICOS retrogenic CD8(+) T cells also preferentially homed to nonlymphoid organs and exhibited reduced multicytokine functionality and reduced ability to mount secondary recall responses upon challenge in vivo. In sum, our results suggest that an altered differentiation program is induced following early and sustained ICOS expression, resulting in the generation of more cytolyticly potent, terminally differentiated effectors that possess limited capacity for recall response.

We adopt a combination approach of ICOS + Treg cells depletion with tumor cell vaccine to evaluate anti-tumor immunity in mouse prostate cancer model. Streptavidin (SA)-mGM-CSF surface-modified RM-1 cells were prepared as the vaccine and the mouse subcutaneous prostate tumor model was used to evaluate the immunity. Tumor growth, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to evaluate the therapeutic effects. Our results demonstrated that SA-mGM-CSF vaccine was prepared successfully and tumor growth was inhibited. The tumor size in the combination group was much smaller than that in the vaccine with IgG mAb group. The portions of dendritic cells, CD8 + and CD4 + T cells in the mice blood and tumor tissues were increased after treatment with vaccine. There were more immune-suppressing Tregs infiltrated into tumor after treatment with tumor cell vaccine, and ICOS blocking could deplete the infiltrated Tregs, and T lymphocytes increased more dramatically in the combination therapy group. The concentrations of interferon-Î³ were increased in all vaccine group, the concentrations of Interleukin-10 and Interleukin-4 were much lower in the combination group. Our study demonstrated that ICOS blocking could deplete the tumor-infiltrated ICOS + Treg cells. Combining GM-CSF surface-modified RM-1 cell vaccine with Anti-ICOS antibody could induce better antitumor immunity than a vaccine alone. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

T.; VÃ¡zquez-DorrÃ­o, J. B.; GuzmÃ¡n, Ã.; Arakawa, Y.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe 23rd Congress of the International Commission for Optics (ICO) was held in Santiago de Compostela (Spain) 26-29 August 2014, organized by the Universities of Vigo and Santiago de Compostela. Approximately 450 people attended the conference, sharing their knowledge in the cheerful, warm atmosphere of this lovely city. The conference was extremely successful in contributing to the mission of the ICO: to contribute worldwide, on an international basis, to the progress and diffusion of scientific and technological knowledge on optics and photonics. Optics and photonics have reached a critical level of importance for the development of our societies and are present in a great many aspects of our technological progress, from communication systems supporting the Internet to the most modern techniques in medicine. Consistent with the conference slogan Enlightening the Future, the meeting stressed the importance of optical science as a key to technological progress in the coming years. UNESCO's designation of 2015 as the International Year of Light and Light-Based Technologies (www.light2015.org) acknowledges the importance of raising global awareness of how light and light-based technologies are present in a large fraction of today's advances and how they can address challenges in important areas such as energy, education, agriculture, and health. The four-day conference highlighted eleven plenary talks by outstanding scientists working in important areas of optics and photonics. A. Aspect, T. Kippenberg (2013 ICO Prize awardee) and K. Razewski (2013 ICO Galileo Galilei Award) spoke on quantum optics; P. Russell and Yu. Kivshar lectured on topics related to optical processing devices as optical fibers and metamaterials for light shaping; N. X. Fang (2011 ICO Prize), U. Woggon, and A. AlÃº (2013 IUPAP Young Scientists Prize) discussed applications of optics to nanoscience; and K. Dholakia and J. Widjaja (2008 Galileo Galilei Award) presented in their plenaries\n\nDefects of mitogen-activated protein kinase in ICOS signaling pathway lead to CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell dysfunction in patients with active SLE.\n\nPubMed\n\nGang, Cai; Jiahui, Yang; Huaizhou, Wang; Qing, Cai; Dongbao, Zhao; Qian, Shen\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn this study, hypoproliferation and defects of effectors and cytokines in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells via ICOS costimulation were found in active SLE patients, relative to normal individuals and RA patient controls. Exogenous IL-2 can partially reverse those defects. In addition, low level of ERK phosphorylation in ICOS-mediated signaling pathway was discovered in lupus CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells. When blocked with ERK-specific chemical inhibitor PD98059, cell proliferation and IL-2 production via ICOS costimulation from both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells will be severely inhibited. These findings confirmed the dysfunction of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells after ICOS costimulation in lupus patients and most importantly pointed out that impairment of ERK activation might be one of the critical factors involved in ICOS-mediated IL-2 and T-cell hypoproliferation in active SLE.\n\nTransient blockade of the inducible costimulator pathway generates long-term tolerance to factor VIII after nonviral gene transfer into hemophilia A mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeng, Baowei; Ye, Peiqing; Blazar, Bruce R; Freeman, Gordon J; Rawlings, David J; Ochs, Hans D; Miao, Carol H\n\n2008-09-01\n\nFormation of inhibitory antibodies is a common problem encountered in clinical treatment for hemophilia. Human factor VIII (hFVIII) plasmid gene therapy in hemophilia A mice also leads to strong humoral responses. We demonstrate that short-term therapy with an anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody to transiently block the inducible costimulator/inducible costimulator ligand (ICOS/ICOSL) signaling pathway led to sustained tolerance to hFVIII in hFVIII plasmid-treated hemophilia A mice and allowed persistent, high-level FVIII functional activity (100%-300% of normal). Anti-ICOS treatment resulted in depletion of ICOS(+)CD4(+) T cells and activation of CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in the peripheral blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. CD4(+) T cells from anti-ICOS-treated mice did not proliferate in response to hFVIII stimulation and produced high levels of regulatory cytokines, including interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-beta. Moreover, CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs from tolerized mice adoptively transferred dominant tolerance in syngeneic hFVIII plasmid-treated hemophilia A mice and reduced the production of antibodies against FVIII. Anti-ICOS-treated mice tolerized to hFVIII generated normal primary and secondary antibody responses after immunization with the T-dependent antigen, bacteriophage Phix 174, indicating maintenance of immune competency. Our data indicate that transient anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody treatment represents a novel single-agent immunomodulatory strategy to overcome the immune responses against transgene product after gene therapy.\n\nPreliminary Study: Application of Off-Axis ICOS to Determine Stable Carbon Isotope in Dissolved Inorganic Carbon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Y. T.; Lee, J. M.; Hwang, J. H.; Piao, J.; Woo, N. C.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nCO2 is one of the major causes for global climate change. Because stable carbon isotope ratio is used to trace carbon source, several analytical techniques likes IRMS (Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry) and LAS (Laser Absorption Spectrometry) were extensively used. Off-axis ICOS, a kind of LAS, has merits on long-term stability and field application, therefore it is widely being used in CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) field. The aim of this study is to extend the application scope of OA-ICOS to determine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Because OA-ICOS showed dependence of Î´13C on CO2 concentration, data processing is required. We tested CO2 Carbon Isotope Analyzer (CCIA-36-EP, Los Gatos Research) with both reference gas (Î´13C= -28.28â°) and aqueous solutions prepared by dissolving sodium bicarbonate standards (Î´13C= -12.26â° and +3.96â°). The differences of Î´13C between reference and measurement values are plotted by CO2 concentrations, then compared. At first, we checked the similarity between our curve pattern for reference gas and Guillon's research (Î´13C= -43.99â°) by other Analyzer. To analyze aqueous samples, more errors can be caused than gas analysis. The carbon isotope fractionation occurs during dissolving standard reagents and extracting DIC as CO2 gas form. This effect is mixed with CO2 concentration dependence effect, therefore the curve patterns are different with that for reference gas. Our experiments are done for various Î´13C values. It could be an important point to use OA-ICOS to analyze DIC, too.\n\nCD3+ICOS+ T cells show differences in the synthesis of nitric oxide, IFN-Î³, and IL-10 in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or in healthy household contacts.\n\nPubMed\n\nLara-RodrÃ­guez, Carmen; Alvarado-VÃ¡squez, NoÃ©; Bernal, Demetrio; Gorocica, Patricia; Zenteno, Edgar; LascuraÃ­n, Ricardo\n\n2016-11-01\n\nEvidence indicates that more than 90Â % of infected individuals never develop active tuberculosis. This fact highlights the relevance of the immune response in tuberculosis control. The inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) is a regulator of the function, differentiation, proliferation, and activation of T cells. Moreover, T cells synthesise nitric oxide (NO), interferon gamma (IFN-Î³), and interleukin (IL)-10, which help regulate the immune response to tuberculosis. Therefore, we assessed the synthesis of NO, IFN-Î³, and IL-10 in CD3 + ICOS + T cells from healthy individuals, household contacts (HHC), and patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), previously stimulated with the antigen H37Rv. Our results indicated a significant increase in both the percentage of ICOS + cells and CD3 + ICOS + T cells producing NO, IFN-Î³, and IL-10 in cells obtained from patients with PTB (pÂ <Â 0.01). In addition, a high mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨ m ) in CD3 + ICOS + T cells was observed in the cells from HHC and from PTB patients, and is associated with the activation of T cells. In conclusion, results show that the CD3 + ICOS + T cells obtained from PTB patients are the main producers of NO, IFN-Î³, and IL-10. In addition, our results imply that NO is a modulator of ICOS expression of T cells from PTB patients.\n\nA novel ICOS-independent, but CD28- and SAP-dependent, pathway of T cell-dependent, polysaccharide-specific humoral immunity in response to intact Streptococcus pneumoniae versus pneumococcal conjugate vaccine\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Quanyi; Cannons, Jennifer L.; Paton, James C.; Akiba, Hisaya; Schwartzberg, Pamela L.; Snapper, Clifford M.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nPolysaccharide (PS)- and protein-specific murine IgG responses to intact Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pn) are both dependent upon CD4+ T cell help, B7-dependent costimulation, and CD40/CD40-ligand interactions. However, the primary PS-, relative to protein-specific, IgG response terminates more rapidly, requires a shorter period of T cell help and B7-dependent costimulation, and fails to generate memory. In light of the critical role for ICOS/ICOS-ligand interactions in sustaining T cell-dependent Ig responses and promoting germinal center reactions, we hypothesized that this interaction was non-essential for PS-specific IgG responses to Pn. We now demonstrate that ICOS-/-, relative to WT, mice elicit a normal PS-specific IgG isotype response to Pn, despite marked inhibition of both the primary and secondary IgG anti-protein (i.e. PspA, PspC, and PsaA) response. A blocking anti-ICOS-ligand mAb injected during primary Pn immunization inhibits both the primary anti-protein response and the generation of protein-specific memory, but has no effect when injected during secondary immunization. In contrast to Pn, both PS- and protein-specific IgG responses to a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine are inhibited in ICOS-/- mice. ICOS-/- mice immunized with intact Pn or conjugate exhibit nearly complete abrogation in germinal center formation. Finally, although mice that lack the adaptor molecule SAP resemble ICOS-/- mice (and can exhibit decreased ICOS expression), we observe that the PS-, as well as protein-specific IgG responses to both Pn and conjugate are markedly defective in SAP-/- mice. These data define a novel T cell-, SAP-, and B7-dependent, but ICOS-independent, extrafollicular pathway of Ig induction.

CAR combines the specificity of antibody and cytotoxicity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, enhancing T cellsâ ability to specifically target antigens and to effectively kill cancer cells. Recent efforts have been made to integrate the costimulatory signals in the CAR to improve the antitumor efficacy. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is an attractive therapeutic target as it frequently expresses in glioma and many other types of cancers. Our current study aimed to investigate the specific and efficient antitumor effect of T cells modified with CAR containing inducible costimulator (ICOS) signaling domain. Methods A second generation of EGFRvIII/CAR was generated and it contained the EGFRvIII single chain variable fragment, ICOS signaling domain and CD3Î¶ chain. Lentiviral EGFRvIII/CAR was prepared and human CD3+ T cells were infected by lentivirus encoding EGFRvIII/CAR. The expression of EGFRvIII/CAR on CD3+ T cells was confirmed by flow cytometry and Western blot. The functions of EGFRvIII/CAR+ T cells were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo methods including cytotoxicity assay, cytokine release assay and xenograft tumor mouse model. Results Chimeric EGFRvIIIscFv-ICOS-CD3Î¶ (EGFRvIII/CAR) was constructed and lentiviral EGFRvIII/CAR were made to titer of 106 TU/ml. The transduction efficiency of lentiviral EGFRvIII/CAR on T cells reached around 70% and expression of EGFRvIII/CAR protein was verified by immunoblotting as a band of about 57 kDa.

Characteristic of this region, with warm waters, the marine boundary layer is typically 2-layered with a surface mixed layer (SML) and a decoupled residual or convective layer (DRCL), above which is the free troposphere (Kunz et al. 2002). The PBL data have been analyzed using a newly developed Temporal Height-Tracking (THT) algorithm (Martucci et al., 2010) for automatic detection of the independent SML and DRCL tops. Daily and weekly averages of the PBL data have been performed to smooth out the short term variability and assess the dependence of the PBL depth on different air masses advected over the Mace Head station. Moreover, a qualitative comparison between the ceilometer and radiometer PBL top detected values has been done to assess their consistency.\n\n[Advances and strategies in gene doping detection].\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Jiangang; Liu, Zhen; Liu, Jing; Dou, Peng; Chen, Hong-Yuan\n\n2008-07-01\n\nThis review surveys the recent status of gene doping detection and the strategies for anti-gene doping. The main gene doping candidates for athletes are summarized, and the advances in the detection of the proteins expressed by these genes such as erythropoietin (EPO) and human growth hormone (hGH) are reviewed. The potential detection strategies for further gene doping analysis are also discussed.\n\nGene doping detection: evaluation of approach for direct detection of gene transfer using erythropoietin as a model system.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaoutina, A; Coldham, T; Bains, G S; Emslie, K R\n\n2010-08-01\n\nAs clinical gene therapy has progressed toward realizing its potential, concern over misuse of the technology to enhance performance in athletes is growing. Although 'gene doping' is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, its detection remains a major challenge. In this study, we developed a methodology for direct detection of the transferred genetic material and evaluated its feasibility for gene doping detection in blood samples from athletes. Using erythropoietin (EPO) as a model gene and a simple in vitro system, we developed real-time PCR assays that target sequences within the transgene complementary DNA corresponding to exon/exon junctions. As these junctions are absent in the endogenous gene due to their interruption by introns, the approach allows detection of trace amounts of a transgene in a large background of the endogenous gene. Two developed assays and one commercial gene expression assay for EPO were validated. On the basis of ability of these assays to selectively amplify transgenic DNA and analysis of literature on testing of gene transfer in preclinical and clinical gene therapy, it is concluded that the developed approach would potentially be suitable to detect gene doping through gene transfer by analysis of small volumes of blood using regular out-of-competition testing.\n\nDeveloping strategies for detection of gene doping.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaoutina, Anna; Alexander, Ian E; Rasko, John E J; Emslie, Kerry R\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIt is feared that the use of gene transfer technology to enhance athletic performance, the practice that has received the term 'gene doping', may soon become a real threat to the world of sport. As recognised by the anti-doping community, gene doping, like doping in any form, undermines principles of fair play in sport and most importantly, involves major health risks to athletes who partake in gene doping. One attraction of gene doping for such athletes and their entourage lies in the apparent difficulty of detecting its use. Since the realisation of the threat of gene doping to sport in 2001, the anti-doping community and scientists from different disciplines concerned with potential misuse of gene therapy technologies for performance enhancement have focused extensive efforts on developing robust methods for gene doping detection which could be used by the World Anti-Doping Agency to monitor athletes and would meet the requirements of a legally defensible test. Here we review the approaches and technologies which are being evaluated for the detection of gene doping, as well as for monitoring the efficacy of legitimate gene therapy, in relation to the detection target, the type of sample required for analysis and detection methods. We examine the accumulated knowledge on responses of the body, at both cellular and systemic levels, to gene transfer and evaluate strategies for gene doping detection based on current knowledge of gene technology, immunology, transcriptomics, proteomics, biochemistry and physiology.

There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that complex interactions are âthe normâ and, rather than amounting to a small perturbation to classical Mendelian genetics, interactions may be the predominant effect. Traditional statistical methods are not well suited for detecting such interactions, especially when the data are high dimensional (many attributes or independent variables) or when interactions occur between more than two polymorphisms. In this review, we discuss machine-learning models and algorithms for identifying and characterising susceptibility genes in common, complex, multifactorial human diseases. We focus on the following machine-learning methods that have been used to detect gene-gene interactions: neural networks, cellular automata, random forests, and multifactor dimensionality reduction. We conclude with some ideas about how these methods and others can be integrated into a comprehensive and flexible framework for data mining and knowledge discovery in human genetics.

History has shown that progress in medical research is likely to be abused in order to enhance human performance. In this review, we critically discuss the progress and the risks associated with the field of erythropoietin (EPO) gene therapy and its applicability to EPO gene doping. We present typical vector systems that are employed in ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy trials. Due to associated risks, gene doping is not a feasible alternative to conventional EPO or blood doping at this time. Nevertheless, it is well described that about half of the elite athlete population is in principle willing to risk its health to gain a competitive advantage. This includes the use of technologies that lack safety approval. Sophisticated detection approaches are a prerequisite for prevention of unapproved and uncontrolled use of gene therapy technology. In this review, we present current detection approaches for EPO gene doping, with a focus on blood-based direct and indirect approaches. Gene doping is detectable in principle, and recent DNA-based detection strategies enable long-term detection of transgenic DNA (tDNA) following in vivo gene transfer.

F.; Best, Shannon E.; Montes de Oca, Marcela; Amante, Fiona H.; Thomas, Bryce S.; Beattie, Lynette; Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes, Fernando; Smyth, Mark J.; Hertzog, Paul J.; Hill, Geoffrey R.; Engwerda, Christian R.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nParasite-specific antibodies protect against blood-stage Plasmodium infection. However, in malaria-endemic regions, it takes many months for naturally-exposed individuals to develop robust humoral immunity. Explanations for this have focused on antigenic variation by Plasmodium, but have considered less whether host production of parasite-specific antibody is sub-optimal. In particular, it is unclear whether host immune factors might limit antibody responses. Here, we explored the effect of Type I Interferon signalling via IFNAR1 on CD4+ T-cell and B-cell responses in two non-lethal murine models of malaria, P. chabaudi chabaudi AS (PcAS) and P. yoelii 17XNL (Py17XNL) infection. Firstly, we demonstrated that CD4+ T-cells and ICOS-signalling were crucial for generating germinal centre (GC) B-cells, plasmablasts and parasite-specific antibodies, and likewise that T follicular helper (Tfh) cell responses relied on B cells. Next, we found that IFNAR1-signalling impeded the resolution of non-lethal blood-stage infection, which was associated with impaired production of parasite-specific IgM and several IgG sub-classes. Consistent with this, GC B-cell formation, Ig-class switching, plasmablast and Tfh differentiation were all impaired by IFNAR1-signalling. IFNAR1-signalling proceeded via conventional dendritic cells, and acted early by limiting activation, proliferation and ICOS expression by CD4+ T-cells, by restricting the localization of activated CD4+ T-cells adjacent to and within B-cell areas of the spleen, and by simultaneously suppressing Th1 and Tfh responses. Finally, IFNAR1-deficiency accelerated humoral immune responses and parasite control by boosting ICOS-signalling. Thus, we provide evidence of a host innate cytokine response that impedes the onset of humoral immunity during experimental malaria. PMID:27812214\n\nCoordination.

Consequently, some athletes may seek new doping methods that they expect to be capable of circumventing detection. With advances in gene transfer vector design and therapeutic gene transfer, and demonstrations of safety and therapeutic benefit in humans, there is an increased probability of the pursuit of gene doping by athletes. In anticipation of the potential for gene doping, assays have been established to directly detect complementary DNA of genes that are top candidates for use in doping, as well as vector control elements. The development of molecular assays that are capable of exposing gene doping in sports can serve as a deterrent and may also identify athletes who have illicitly used gene transfer for performance enhancement. PCR-based methods to detect foreign DNA with high reliability, sensitivity, and specificity include TaqMan real-time PCR, nested PCR, and internal threshold control PCR.\n\nEfficacy of an oral and tropically stable lipid-based formulation of Amphotericin B (iCo-010) in an experimental mouse model of systemic candidiasis.\n\nPubMed\n\nIbrahim, Fady; Sivak, Olena; Wasan, Ellen K; Bartlett, Karen; Wasan, Kishor M\n\n2013-10-29\n\nAn oral lipid based formulation that exhibits tropical stability (iCo-010) was developed to enhance the absorption of orally administered amphotericin B (AmB). iCo-010 has previously shown high efficacy in an acute model of systemic candidiasis in rats, directing the focus of this study to be its efficacy in a chronic model of systemic candidiasis in mice. Mice were infected with 0.6 to 1Ã108 CFUs of Candida albicans ATCC 18804 strain by tail vein injection and were left for three days to develop the infection after which time treatment was initiated. The infected animals were assigned to the following treatment groups: no treatment (control) or iCo-010 at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg administered by oral gavage once daily (QD) for 5 consecutive days. The animals were sacrificed 7 days after the last dose and the concentration of AmB and the fungal burden were assessed within the liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, spleen and brain. Although the infection was relatively low (~ 60-100 CFUs/ 1 ml tissue homogenate) in the liver, lungs and heart, the infection level was very high (70 000 CFUs / 1 ml tissue homogenate) in the kidney tissues for the control group. The highest concentrations of AmB were recovered in the kidneys and the spleen. The fungal burden in the tissues was lowered by 69-96% in the treatment groups when compared to the control group. Oral iCo-010 is an effective treatment of systemic candidiasis in the mouse model.\n\nSpecial Populations. A Follow-up of 1987-1988 Suggestions and Recommendations.

Existing HGT detection algorithms rely on a strong phylogenetic signal distinguishing the transferred sequence from ancestral (vertically derived) genes in its recipient genome. Detecting HGT between closely related species or strains is challenging, as the phylogenetic signal is usually weak and the nucleotide composition is normally nearly identical. Nevertheless, there is a great importance in detecting HGT between congeneric species or strains, especially in clinical microbiology, where understanding the emergence of new virulent and drug-resistant strains is crucial, and often time-sensitive. We developed a novel, self-contained technique named Near HGT, based on the synteny index, to measure the divergence of a gene from its native genomic environment and used it to identify candidate HGT events between closely related strains. The method confirms candidate transferred genes based on the constant relative mutability (CRM). Using CRM, the algorithm assigns a confidence score based on âunusualâ sequence divergence. A gene exhibiting exceptional deviations according to both synteny and mutability criteria, is considered a validated HGT product. We first employed the technique to a set of three E. coli strains and detected several highly probable horizontally acquired genes. We then compared the method to existing HGT detection tools using a larger strain data set. When combined with additional approaches our new algorithm provides richer picture and brings us closer to the goal of detecting all newly acquired genes in a particular strain.

Alejandro\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract Gene fusions are known to play critical roles in tumor pathogenesis. Yet, sensitive and specific algorithms to detect gene fusions in cancer do not currently exist. In this paper, we present a new statistical algorithm, MACHETE (Mismatched Alignment CHimEra Tracking Engine), which achieves highly sensitive and specific detection of gene fusions from RNA-Seq data, including the highest Positive Predictive Value (PPV) compared to the current state-of-the-art, as assessed in simulated data. We show that the best performing published algorithms either find large numbers of fusions in negative control data or suffer from low sensitivity detecting known driving fusions in gold standard settings, such as EWSR1-FLI1. As proof of principle that MACHETE discovers novel gene fusions with high accuracy in vivo, we mined public data to discover and subsequently PCR validate novel gene fusions missed by other algorithms in the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3. These results highlight the gains in accuracy achieved by introducing statistical models into fusion detection, and pave the way for unbiased discovery of potentially driving and druggable gene fusions in primary tumors.

Despite considerable progresses in term of accuracy in computational gene prediction, the ability to reliably predict AS variants when there is local experimental evidence of it remains an open challenge for gene finders. We have used a new integrative approach that allows to incorporate AS detection into ab initio gene prediction. This method relies on the analysis of genomically aligned transcript sequences (ESTs and/or cDNAs), and has been implemented in the dynamic programming algorithm of the graph-based gene finder EuGENE. Given a genomic sequence and a set of aligned transcripts, this new version identifies the set of transcripts carrying evidence of alternative splicing events, and provides, in addition to the classical optimal gene prediction, alternative optimal predictions (among those which are consistent with the AS events detected). This allows for multiple annotations of a single gene in a way such that each predicted variant is supported by a transcript evidence (but not necessarily with a full-length coverage). This automatic combination of experimental data analysis and ab initio gene finding offers an ideal integration of alternatively spliced gene prediction inside a single annotation pipeline.\n\nA powerful score-based test statistic for detecting gene-gene co-association.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Jing; Yuan, Zhongshang; Ji, Jiadong; Zhang, Xiaoshuai; Li, Hongkai; Wu, Xuesen; Xue, Fuzhong; Liu, Yanxun\n\n2016-01-29\n\nThe genetic variants identified by Genome-wide association study (GWAS) can only account for a small proportion of the total heritability for complex disease. The existence of gene-gene joint effects which contains the main effects and their co-association is one of the possible explanations for the \"missing heritability\" problems. Gene-gene co-association refers to the extent to which the joint effects of two genes differ from the main effects, not only due to the traditional interaction under nearly independent condition but the correlation between genes. Generally, genes tend to work collaboratively within specific pathway or network contributing to the disease and the specific disease-associated locus will often be highly correlated (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium). Therefore, we proposed a novel score-based statistic (SBS) as a gene-based method for detecting gene-gene co-association. Various simulations illustrate that, under different sample sizes, marginal effects of causal SNPs and co-association levels, the proposed SBS has the better performance than other existed methods including single SNP-based and principle component analysis (PCA)-based logistic regression model, the statistics based on canonical correlations (CCU), kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCU), partial least squares path modeling (PLSPM) and delta-square (Î´ (2)) statistic. The real data analysis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) further confirmed its advantages in practice. SBS is a powerful and efficient gene-based method for detecting gene-gene co-association.\n\nDNA Microarray for Detection of Macrolide Resistance Genes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCassone, Marco; D'Andrea, Marco M.; Iannelli, Francesco; Oggioni, Marco R.; Rossolini, Gian Maria; Pozzi, Gianni\n\n2006-01-01\n\nA DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

Using MHCII tetramers, we show that Mtb-specific CD4 T cells are subject to ongoing antigenic stimulation. Despite this chronic stimulation, a subset of PD-1+ cells is maintained within the lung parenchyma during tuberculosis (TB). When transferred into uninfected animals, these cells persist, mount a robust recall response, and provide superior protection to Mtb rechallenge when compared to terminally differentiated Th1 cells that reside preferentially in the lung-associated vasculature. The PD-1+ cells share features with memory CD4 T cells in that their generation and maintenance requires intrinsic Bcl6 and intrinsic ICOS expression. Thus, the molecular pathways required to maintain Mtb-specific CD4 T cells during ongoing infection are similar to those that maintain memory CD4 T cells in scenarios of antigen deprivation. These results suggest that vaccination strategies targeting the ICOS and Bcl6 pathways in CD4 T cells may provide new avenues to prevent TB.

An animal model of human prolactin adenoma.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTrouillas, J.; Girod, C.; Claustrat, B.; CurÃ©, M.; Dubois, M. P.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nTwenty-three spontaneous pituitary tumors in 58 rats of Wistar/Furth/Ico strain were studied. The incidence is 38% in rats older than 10 months; it rises with age, with a maximum at 28-32 months (68.7%) and is higher in females (71.4%) than in males (35%) over 17 months. Light-microscopic and immunocytochemical studies revealed 20 prolactinomas in 19 rats (19/58, 32.7%) and 3 spongiocytic nonimmunostaining adenomas (3/58, 5.2%). The prolactinoma is often hemorrhagic. The cells, often arranged in sheets and agranular, are mostly positive with anti-rat prolactin (rPRL) serum. They have few polymorph granules and a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the spongiocytic adenoma, the cells are arranged in cords. Their cytoplasm is slightly vacuolated. In prolactinoma-bearing rats, the mean plasma PRL value was 213 +/- 72.5 microgram/1 (SEM) (N = 15 +/- 1.8 microgram/1 [SEM]). A linear correlation was found between the logarithm of the tumoral pituitary weight or of the tumor size and the logarithm of the prolactinemia. Because of the analogies between these rat prolactinomas and 57 human prolactinomas, the Wistar/Furth/Ico rat strain is considered as a good animal model.

Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) being the conventional method for stable isotopic measurements, has many limitations making it impossible for deploying them in remote areas for online or in-situ sampling. New laser based absorption spectroscopy approaches like Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) and Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (ICOS) have been developed for online measurements of stable isotopes at an expense of considerably less power requirement but with precision comparable to IRMS. In this research project, we introduce a new calibration system for an Off- Axis ICOS (Los Gatos Research CCIA-36d) for a wide range of varying concentrations of CO2 (800ppm - 25,000ppm), a typical CO2 flux range at the plant-soil continuum. The calibration compensates for the concentration dependency of Î´13C and Î´18O measurements, and was performed using various CO2 standards with known CO2 concentration and Î´C13 and Î´O18 values. A mathematical model was developed after the calibration procedure as a correction factor for the concentration dependency of Î´13C and Î´18O measurements. Temperature dependency of Î´13C and Î´18O measurements were investigated and no significant influence was found. Simultaneous calibration of Î´13C and Î´18O is achieved using this calibration system with an overall accuracy of (~ 0.75Â±0.24 â° for Î´13C, ~ 0.81 Â±0.26â° for Î´18O). This calibration procedure is found to be appropriate for making Off-Axis ICOS suitable for measuring CO2 concentration and Î´13C and Î´18O measurements at atmosphere-plant-soil continuum.\n\nIdentification of feces by detection of Bacteroides genes.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakanishi, Hiroaki; Shojo, Hideki; Ohmori, Takeshi; Hara, Masaaki; Takada, Aya; Adachi, Noboru; Saito, Kazuyuki\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn forensic science, the identification of feces is very important in a variety of crime investigations. However, no sensitive and simple fecal identification method using molecular biological techniques has been reported. Here, we focused on the fecal bacteria, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and developed a novel fecal identification method by detection of the gene sequences specific to these bacteria in various body (feces, blood, saliva, semen, urine, vaginal fluids and skin surfaces) and forensic (anal adhesions) specimens. Bacterial gene detection was performed by real-time PCR using a minor groove binding probe to amplify the RNA polymerase Î²-subunit gene of B. uniformis and B. vulgatus, and the Î±-1-6 mannanase gene of B. thetaiotaomicron. At least one of these bacteria was detected in the feces of 20 donors; the proportions of B. uniformis, B. vulgatus and B. thetaiotaomicron were 95, 85 and 60%, respectively. Bacteroides vulgatus was also detected in one of six vaginal fluid samples, but B. thetaiotaomicron and B. uniformis were not detected in body samples other than feces. Further, we applied this method to forensic specimens from 18 donors. Eighteen anal adhesions also contained at least one of three bacteria; B. uniformis, B. vulgatus and B. thetaiotaomicron were detected in 89, 78 and 56%, respectively, of the specimens. Thus, these bacteria were present at a high frequency in the fecal and forensic specimens, while either B. uniformis or B. vulgatus was detected in all samples. Therefore, B. uniformis and B. vulgatus represent more appropriate target species than B. thetaiotaomicron for the identification of fecal material. If B. vulgatus and/or B. uniformis are detected, it is likely that the sample contains feces. Taken together, our results suggest that the use of molecular biological techniques will aid the detection of feces in forensic practice, although it is possible that the samples contained\n\nEfficient strategy for detecting gene Ã gene joint action and its application in schizophrenia.\n\nPubMed\n\nWon, Sungho; Kwon, Min-Seok; Mattheisen, Manuel; Park, Suyeon; Park, Changsoon; Kihara, Daisuke; Cichon, Sven; Ophoff, Roel; NÃ¶then, Markus M; Rietschel, Marcella; Baur, Max; Uitterlinden, Andre G; Hofmann, A; Lange, Christoph\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe propose a new approach to detect gene Ã gene joint action in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for case-control designs. This approach offers an exhaustive search for all two-way joint action (including, as a special case, single gene action) that is computationally feasible at the genome-wide level and has reasonable statistical power under most genetic models. We found that the presence of any gene Ã gene joint action may imply differences in three types of genetic components: the minor allele frequencies and the amounts of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium may differ between cases and controls, and between the two genetic loci the degree of linkage disequilibrium may differ between cases and controls. Using Fisher's method, it is possible to combine the different sources of genetic information in an overall test for detecting gene Ã gene joint action. The proposed statistical analysis is efficient and its simplicity makes it applicable to GWASs. In the current study, we applied the proposed approach to a GWAS on schizophrenia and found several potential gene Ã gene interactions. Our application illustrates the practical advantage of the proposed method.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been successfully applied in fusion gene detection for the last several years, and a number of NGS-based tools have been developed for identifying fusion genes during this period. Most fusion gene detection tools based on RNA-seq data report a large number of candidates (mostly false positives), making it hard to prioritize candidates for experimental validation and further analysis. Selection of reliable fusion genes for downstream analysis becomes very important in cancer research. We therefore developed confFuse, a scoring algorithm to reliably select high-confidence fusion genes which are likely to be biologically relevant. Results: confFuse takes multiple parameters into account in order to assign each fusion candidate a confidence score, of which score â¥8 indicates high-confidence fusion gene predictions. These parameters were manually curated based on our experience and on certain structural motifs of fusion genes. Compared with alternative tools, based on 96 published RNA-seq samples from different tumor entities, our method can significantly reduce the number of fusion candidates (301 high-confidence from 8,083 total predicted fusion genes) and keep high detection accuracy (recovery rate 85.7%). Validation of 18 novel, high-confidence fusions detected in three breast tumor samples resulted in a 100% validation rate. Conclusions: confFuse is a novel downstream filtering method that allows selection of highly reliable fusion gene candidates for further downstream analysis and experimental validations. confFuse is available at https://github.com/Zhiqin-HUANG/confFuse.\n\nICO amplicon NGS data analysis: a Web tool for variant detection in common high-risk hereditary cancer genes analyzed by amplicon GS Junior next-generation sequencing.\n\nPubMed\n\nLopez-Doriga, Adriana; FeliubadalÃ³, LÃ­dia; MenÃ©ndez, Mireia; Lopez-Doriga, Sergio; MorÃ³n-Duran, Francisco D; del Valle, JesÃºs; Tornero, Eva; Montes, Eva; Cuesta, Raquel; Campos, Olga; GÃ³mez, Carolina; Pineda, Marta; GonzÃ¡lez, Sara; Moreno, Victor; CapellÃ¡, Gabriel; LÃ¡zaro, Conxi\n\n2014-03-01\n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized genomic research and is set to have a major impact on genetic diagnostics thanks to the advent of benchtop sequencers and flexible kits for targeted libraries. Among the main hurdles in NGS are the difficulty of performing bioinformatic analysis of the huge volume of data generated and the high number of false positive calls that could be obtained, depending on the NGS technology and the analysis pipeline. Here, we present the development of a free and user-friendly Web data analysis tool that detects and filters sequence variants, provides coverage information, and allows the user to customize some basic parameters. The tool has been developed to provide accurate genetic analysis of targeted sequencing of common high-risk hereditary cancer genes using amplicon libraries run in a GS Junior System. The Web resource is linked to our own mutation database, to assist in the clinical classification of identified variants. We believe that this tool will greatly facilitate the use of the NGS approach in routine laboratories.\n\nProposal to support the 4th international conference on nitrification and related processes (ICoN4)\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKlotz, Martin Gunter\n\nThe 4th International Conference on Nitrification and Related Processes (ICoN4) commencing between June 27 and July 1, 2015, at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada brings together an international collection of academic, government, and private sector researchers of the global biogeochemical nitrogen cycle to share their scientific discoveries, innovations and pertinent societal impacts. The classical understanding of ânitrificationâ describes the two-step transformation of ammonium to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate; however, we now know from the analysis genome sequences, the application of âomics technologies, microbial ecology, biogeochemistry, and microbial physiology that the transformation of ammonium is not performedmoreÂ Â» by a few particular groups of microorganisms nor is it confined to oxic environments. Past ICoN meetings have explored the interconnections between ammonium- and nitrite-consuming processes in all ecosystems, the emission of greenhouse gases by these processes and their control, and the intersection between intermediates of the nitrification process and other elemental cycles; this has generated tremendous progress in our understanding of the global nitrogen cycle and it has generated excitement in the next generation of N cycle researchers. Nitrification research has a long-standing connection to the Community Science Program of the DOE. Between 1999 and 2001, the JGI generated the first genome sequence of an ammonia-oxidizing bacterium, Nitrosomonas europaea ATCC 19718, and it has subsequently sequenced, or is in the process of sequencing over 50 additional genomes from ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, and ammonia-oxidizing archaea. Autotrophic ammonia- and nitrite-transforming microorganisms play also a critical role in carbon cycling and sequestration in nearly all ecosystems.

EGFR gene mutations at codons 746-753 promote constitutive EGFR activation and result in worst prognosis. However, these mutations augment the therapeutic effect of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Therefore, the detection of EGFR gene mutations is important for determining treatment planning. The aim of the study was to establish a method to detect EGFR gene mutations at codons 746-753. EGFR gene mutation at codons 746-753 in six cancer cell lines were investigated. A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based procedure was developed, that employed peptide nucleic acid to suppress amplification of the wild-type allele. This mutation-oriented LAMP can amplify the DNA fragment of the EGFR gene with codons 746-753 mutations within 30 min. Moreover, boiled cells can work as template resources. Mutation oriented-LAMP assay for EGFR gene mutation is sensitive on extracted DNA. This procedure would be capable of detecting EGFR gene mutation in sputum, pleural effusion, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid or trans-bronchial lung biopsy by chair side.

Placentas were collected from 13 normal pregnancies and 13 patients with preeclampsia. Gene expression was studied using DNA microarray. Among significantly expressed genes, we focused on genes associated with cytokines and oxidation, and the results were confirmed using quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). 415 genes out of 30,940 genes were altered by > or =2-fold in the microarray analysis. 121 up-regulated genes and 294 down-regulated genes were found to be in preeclamptic placenta. Six cytokine-related genes and 5 oxidation-related genes were found from among the 121 up-regulated genes. The cytokine-related genes studied included oncostatin M (OSM), fms-related tyrosine kinase (FLT1) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and the oxidation-related genes studied included spermine oxidase (SMOX), l cytochrome P450, family 26, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP26A1), acetate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). These six genes were also significantly higher in placentas from patients with preeclampsia than in those from women with normal pregnancies. The placental tissue of patients with preeclampsia showed significantly higher mRNA expression of these six genes than the normal group, using QRT-PCR. DNA microarray analysis is one of the great methods for simultaneously detecting the functionally associated genes of preeclampsia. The cytokine-related genes such as OSM, FLT1 and VEGFA, and the oxidation-related genes such as LDHA, CYP26A1 and SMOX might prove to be the starting point in the elucidation of the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.\n\nA Combinatorial Approach to Detecting Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions in Family Studies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLou, Xiang-Yang; Chen, Guo-Bo; Yan, Lei; Ma, Jennie Z.; Mangold, Jamie E.; Zhu, Jun; Elston, Robert C.; Li, Ming D.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWidespread multifactor interactions present a significant challenge in determining risk factors of complex diseases. Several combinatorial approaches, such as the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method, have emerged as a promising tool for better detecting gene-gene (G Ã G) and gene-environment (G Ã E) interactions. We recently developed a general combinatorial approach, namely the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method, which can entertain both qualitative and quantitative phenotypes and allows for both discrete and continuous covariates to detect G Ã G and G Ã E interactions in a sample of unrelated individuals. In this article, we report the development of an algorithm that can be used to study G Ã G and G Ã E interactions for family-based designs, called pedigree-based GMDR (PGMDR). Compared to the available method, our proposed method has several major improvements, including allowing for covariate adjustments and being applicable to arbitrary phenotypes, arbitrary pedigree structures, and arbitrary patterns of missing marker genotypes. Our Monte Carlo simulations provide evidence that the PGMDR method is superior in performance to identify epistatic loci compared to the MDR-pedigree disequilibrium test (PDT). Finally, we applied our proposed approach to a genetic data set on tobacco dependence and found a significant interaction between two taste receptor genes (i.e., TAS2R16 and TAS2R38) in affecting nicotine dependence.

Skeletal muscle is a prime target of gene therapy and we asked whether we can develop a test system to produce and detect gene doping. Towards this end, we introduced a plasmid (pCMV-FAK, 3.8 kb, 50 Î¼g) for constitutive expression of the chicken homologue for the regulator of muscle growth, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), via gene electro transfer in the anti-gravitational muscle, m. soleus, or gastrocnemius medialis of rats. Activation of hypertrophy signalling was monitored by assessing the ribosomal kinase p70S6K and muscle fibre cross section. Detectability of the introduced plasmid was monitored with polymerase chain reaction in deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) from transfected muscle and serum. Muscle transfection with pCMV-FAK elevated FAK expression 7- and 73-fold, respectively, and increased mean cross section by 52 and 16% in targeted muscle fibres of soleus and gastrocnemius muscle 7 days after gene electro transfer. Concomitantly p70S6K content was increased in transfected soleus muscle (+110%). Detection of the exogenous plasmid sequence was possible in DNA and cDNA of muscle until 7 days after transfection, but not in serum except close to the site of plasmid deposition, 1 h after injection and surgery. The findings suggest that the reliable detection of gene doping in the immoral athlete is not possible unless a change in the current practice of tissue sampling is applied involving the collection of muscle biopsy close to the site of gene injection.\n\nGeneBreak: detection of recurrent DNA copy number aberration-associated chromosomal breakpoints within genes.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan den Broek, Evert; van Lieshout, Stef; Rausch, Christian; Ylstra, Bauke; van de Wiel, Mark A; Meijer, Gerrit A; Fijneman, Remond J A; Abeln, Sanne\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDevelopment of cancer is driven by somatic alterations, including numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations. Currently, several computational methods are available and are widely applied to detect numerical copy number aberrations (CNAs) of chromosomal segments in tumor genomes. However, there is lack of computational methods that systematically detect structural chromosomal aberrations by virtue of the genomic location of CNA-associated chromosomal breaks and identify genes that appear non-randomly affected by chromosomal breakpoints across (large) series of tumor samples. 'GeneBreak' is developed to systematically identify genes recurrently affected by the genomic location of chromosomal CNA-associated breaks by a genome-wide approach, which can be applied to DNA copy number data obtained by array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) or by (low-pass) whole genome sequencing (WGS). First, 'GeneBreak' collects the genomic locations of chromosomal CNA-associated breaks that were previously pinpointed by the segmentation algorithm that was applied to obtain CNA profiles. Next, a tailored annotation approach for breakpoint-to-gene mapping is implemented. Finally, dedicated cohort-based statistics is incorporated with correction for covariates that influence the probability to be a breakpoint gene. In addition, multiple testing correction is integrated to reveal recurrent breakpoint events. This easy-to-use algorithm, 'GeneBreak', is implemented in R ( www.cran.r-project.org ) and is available from Bioconductor ( www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GeneBreak.html ).\n\nApplicability of the chymopapain gene used as endogenous reference gene for transgenic huanong no. 1 papaya detection.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuo, Jinchao; Yang, Litao; Liu, Xin; Zhang, Haibo; Qian, Bingjun; Zhang, Dabing\n\n2009-08-12\n\nThe virus-resistant papaya (Carica papaya L.), Huanong no. 1, was the genetically modified (GM) fruit approved for growing in China in 2006. To implement the labeling regulation of GM papaya and its derivates, the development of papaya endogenous reference gene is very necessary for GM papaya detection. Herein, we reported one papaya specific gene, Chymopapain (CHY), as one suitable endogenous reference gene, used for GM papaya identification. Thereafter, we established the conventional and real-time quantitative PCR assays of the CHY gene. In the CHY conventional PCR assay, the limit of detection (LOD) was 25 copies of haploid papaya genome. In the CHY real-time quantitative PCR assay, both the LOD and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were as low as 12.5 copies of haploid papaya genome. Furthermore, we revealed the construct-specific sequence of Chinese GM papaya Huanong no. 1 and developed its conventional and quantitative PCR systems employing the CHY gene as endogenous reference gene. This work is useful for papaya specific identification and GM papaya detection.\n\nGenomic Data Quality Impacts Automated Detection of Lateral Gene Transfer in Fungi\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDupont, Pierre-Yves; Cox, Murray P.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nLateral gene transfer (LGT, also known as horizontal gene transfer), an atypical mechanism of transferring genes between species, has almost become the default explanation for genes that display an unexpected composition or phylogeny. Numerous methods of detecting LGT events all rely on two fundamental strategies: primary structure composition or gene tree/species tree comparisons. Discouragingly, the results of these different approaches rarely coincide. With the wealth of genome data now available, detection of laterally transferred genes is increasingly being attempted in large uncurated eukaryotic datasets. However, detection methods depend greatly on the quality of the underlying genomic data, which are typically complex for eukaryotes. Furthermore, given the automated nature of genomic data collection, it is typically impractical to manually verify all protein or gene models, orthology predictions, and multiple sequence alignments, requiring researchers to accept a substantial margin of error in their datasets. Using a test case comprising plant-associated genomes across the fungal kingdom, this study reveals that composition- and phylogeny-based methods have little statistical power to detect laterally transferred genes. In particular, phylogenetic methods reveal extreme levels of topological variation in fungal gene trees, the vast majority of which show departures from the canonical species tree. Therefore, it is inherently challenging to detect LGT events in typical eukaryotic genomes. This finding is in striking contrast to the large number of claims for laterally transferred genes in eukaryotic species that routinely appear in the literature, and questions how many of these proposed examples are statistically well supported.

However, there is sparse literature on effective integrated care interventions that specifically target these high-risk individuals. The Integrated Community of Care (ICoC) is a novel care model that integrates hospital-based transitional care with health and social care in the community for high-risk individuals living in socially deprived communities. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the ICoC in reducing acute hospital use and investigate the implementation process and its effects on clinical outcomes using a mixed-methods participatory action research (PAR) approach. This is a single-centre prospective, controlled, observational study performed in the SingHealth Regional Health System. A total of 250 eligible patients from an urbanised low-income community in Singapore will be enrolled during their index hospitalisation. Our PAR model combines two research components: quantitative and qualitative, at different phases of the intervention. Outcomes of acute hospital use and health-related quality of life are compared with controls, at 30 days and 1âyear. The qualitative study aims at developing a more context-specific social ecological model of health behaviour. This model will identify how influences within one's social environment: individual, interpersonal, organisational, community and policy factors affect people's experiences and behaviours during care transitions from hospital to home. Knowledge on the operational aspects of ICoC will enrich our evidence-based strategies to understand the impa"
