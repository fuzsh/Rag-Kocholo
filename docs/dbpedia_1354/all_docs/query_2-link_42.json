Why did they refer to themselves as Native Americans? This essay shows how this identification did not materialize overnight and was instead the outcome of a longer process. During the Sixties, the counterculture movements looked at Native Americans as a model of an alternative way of life. Cinema, literature and the alternative press spread this view outside the USA. Since the beginning of the Seventies, Italian far-left groups represented Native Americans as a people not only closer to nature but also as victims of the capitalist system. Native Americans thus became a symbol that in some ways obfuscated the real people that had inspired the symbol. This essay studies this process through the analyses of films, magazines and newspapers. It also shows how Native American histories, images, and mythologies were twisted to suit a variety of different social and political needs, in tune with the Italian historical and cultural contexts of the times.\n\nThe course is a journey through 250 years of Italian history, from the French revolution to the current pontificate of Pope Francis.

The aim is to capture fundamental moments and issues in the religious life of the Italian people. While focusing mainly on Italy, the course will also take into account questions and events that relate to the broader history of Western societies. The primary type of documents that will be examined are the papal encyclicals (official letters authored by the popes). The course will study the theological and political content of the encyclicals, as well as their linguistic and stylistic strategies. While focusing primarily on pontificates and their intellectual production, the course will pay attention also to the religious life of the people and the documents that reveal their devotion and beliefs. In this regard, the class will shed light on the historic tensions and conflicts in Catholic history between the religious canon (that is the set of laws and norms produced by the Holy See across the centuries), and the actual practices and beliefs of the people.\n\nThe course will be delivered in a seminar mode and host contributions from notable external scholars. Students will be invited to give presentations, comment on the readings, and be actively engaged all the time. Attention will be paid to the original Italian documents or their translation. Students with no knowledge of the Italian language are welcome to join.\n\nThe essay presents several ideas regarding the management of the «Adriatic Question» in the period following World War II, focusing particular attention on the strategies of the political centre-left, of «Moroteism» and of «border... more\n\nThe essay presents several ideas regarding the management of the «Adriatic Question» in the period following World War II, focusing particular attention on the strategies of the political centre-left, of «Moroteism» and of «border Catholicism» aimed at getting beyond the legacy of the conflict and achieving a normalisation of Italo-Yugoslav relations after the return of Trieste to Italy in 1954. The analysis reconstructs the conciliatory path of two bordering states, formerly divided by a heated national, political and ideological rivalry. Drawing a parallel between the choices made centrally and those made locally, the work furthermore examines the connection between Aldo Moro’s Ostpolitik and the line taken by Trieste’s Christian Democrats, both of which aimed to put an end to controversy on the eastern front – the «Adriatic normalisation», following the «defence of Italianness» – in a situation characterised by a lowering of tensions between the blocks, by the reorganisation of international Communism and by the multilateralism of the Helsinki Conference. The aim of this paper is therefore to shed light upon how and with what consequences Moro’s «Peace in the Security» and Triestine Moroteism’s «bridge border» strategy – leading principle of the Giulian Christian Democrats throughout the Sixties and Seventies – established on the one hand a relationship of collaboration with Tito’s Yugoslavia (culminating in the Treaty of Osimo in 1975) and on the other designed a new political, economic and national function for the eccentric region of Venezia Giulia, whose sovereignty had been long contested and had been severely penalised in the wake of the second world war.\n\nThe paper will be based on new documentation from: Archivio Democrazia cristiana di Trieste, Fondo segreteria Democrazia cristiana nazionale, Fondo Giulio Andreotti, Fondo Aldo Moro, Fondo Sergio Coloni, Christian Democrats newspapers.\n\nFrom the valley of Adige, the massif of Monte Baldo is first rising with steep walls, and only above them the characteristic eastern terrace of Monte Baldo stretches.

In 1898 it was rebuilt, but the biggest reconstruction started in 1975.\n\nThe church was demolished and rebuilt to the dimensions, which can be seen nowadays. The church was consecrated in 1978 and in 1988 also the Pope visited the place.\n\nOnce the place was hardly reachable. Only a narrow and exposed passage was leading to the buildings.\n\nThe Sanctuarium and the Shrine of the Corona is a place of silence and meditation, extended between heaven and earth, hidden in the heart of the Baldo rocks. Medieval documents testify that hermits linked to the Abbey of St Zeno in Verona lived in the Baldo area already around the year 1000 and that at least from the second half of the 13th century there was a monastery with a chapel dedicated to St Mary of Montebaldo. This was only accessible by a dangerous narrow path in the rock. A holy tradition dates the birth of the Shrine of Our Lady of the Corona to 1522, the year when the sculpture venerated hen was miraculously transported through angelic intervention from the island of Rhodes, when the island was invaded by the Muslim army of Suliman II. This date is however contested by the existence, in the recesses of the modern shrine, of a fourteenth century painting of the Our Lady and the Child Jesus. This was the first image venerated in the original chapel, which took its name from it. Between 1434 and 1437 St Mary of Montebaldo passed under the ownership of the Knights of St John, or of the Holy Sepulchre, present in Verona since 1362 as the Commenda di San Vitale e Sepolcro, who remained owners of the Shrine until the dissolving under the Napoleonic provision of 1806. It would seem that the group in stone of the Pietà later venerated as Our Lady of the Corona dates to this period. The statue, that is 70 centimetres high, 56 wide and 25 in depth, is made from local stone and painted. It stands on a pedestal that bears the legend “HOC OPUS FECIT FIERI LODOVICUS D CASTROBARCO D 1432”, traditionally considered proof that the statue was made and given to the Corona in 1432 by Lodovico Castelbarco, of a noble family of Rovereto. During its four centuries of operation, the Commenda radically transformed Our Lady of the Corona, turning it into a real spacious and accessible Shrine thanks to the building of a wooden access bridge in the valley (1458) and the construction of a new church measuring 18 metres by 7 over the old chapel (1490-1521).\n\nThe sixteenth century saw the creation of two sets of access steps that can still be seen: a wider one, composed of 556 steps which from the spring of Spiazzi, later called “Spring of Independence” went down to the Bridge “del Tiglio”, and a narrower one, 234 steps, cut from the rock along the original very narrow path that went from the bridge to the church."
