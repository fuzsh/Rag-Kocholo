This document summarizes a Supreme Court case from the Philippines regarding the removal of Aquilino T. Larin from his position as Assistant Commissioner of the Excise Tax Service of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. It describes how Larin was convicted of crimes related to his position but the conviction was later set aside. It also discusses the administrative investigation into Larin's conduct and his eventual dismissal by the President. Larin challenged his removal, arguing that the President did not have authority to remove him and that the administrative investigation violated his due process rights. The document provides background on the legal issues regarding Larin's removal that were considered by the Supreme Court.",
