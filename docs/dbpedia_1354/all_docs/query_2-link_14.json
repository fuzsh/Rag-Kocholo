        "text": "Edaravone Reduces Hyperperfusion-Related Neurological Deficits in Adult Moyamoya Disease: Historical Control Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nUchino, Haruto; Nakayama, Naoki; Kazumata, Ken; Kuroda, Satoshi; Houkin, Kiyohiro\n\n2016-07-01\n\nPostoperative hyperperfusion-related transient neurological deficits (TNDs) are frequently observed in adult patients with moyamoya disease who undergo direct bypass procedures. The present study evaluated the effect of the free radical scavenger edaravone on postoperative hyperperfusion in adult moyamoya disease. This study included 92 hemispheres in 72 adult patients who underwent direct bypass for moyamoya disease. Serial measurements of cerebral blood flow were conducted immediately after surgery and on postoperative days 2 and 7. In 40 hemispheres for 36 patients, edaravone (60 mg/d) was administered from the day of surgery to postsurgical day 7. The incidence of postoperative hyperperfusion and associated TNDs were compared with a control group that included 52 hemispheres in 36 patients. Radiological hyperperfusion was observed in 28 of 40 (70.0%) and 39 of 52 (75.0%) hemispheres in the edaravone and control groups, respectively (P=0.30). Hyperperfusion-related TND incidences were significantly lower in the edaravone group compared with the control group (12.5% versus 32.7%; P=0.024). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that edaravone administration (P=0.009) and left-sided surgery (P=0.037) were significantly correlated with hyperperfusion-related TNDs (odds ratios, 0.3 and 4.2, respectively). Perioperative administration of edaravone reduced the incidence of hyperperfusion-related TNDs after direct bypass procedures in adult patients with moyamoya disease.

These reports have been limited to pediatric patients presenting with recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or headaches. Management has primarily been pharmacologic, with only one prior report of surgical revascularization to our knowledge. We report four cases of Noonan syndrome patients presenting with headaches and/or sensorimotor strokes in childhood that caused unilateral sensorimotor impairment. Cerebral angiography and MRI revealed bilateral moyamoya syndrome. All patients underwent successful bilateral extracranial-to-intracranial revascularization. The first patient was a 10-year-old girl who presented following a hemorrhagic stroke and recovered well after indirect bypass. The second patient was an adult with a history of childhood stroke whose symptoms progressed in adulthood. She underwent a direct bypass and improved, but continued to experience TIA at her 4 year follow-up. The third patient was a 7-year-old girl with headaches and a new onset TIA who failed pharmacological therapy and subsequently underwent bilateral indirect bypass. The fourth patient was a 24-year-old woman with worsening headaches and an occluded left middle cerebral artery from unilateral moyamoya syndrome. A left sided direct bypass was completed given delayed MRI perfusion with poor augmentation. To our knowledge these are the first reported surgical cases of combined Noonan and moyamoya syndrome. These cases highlight the need to recognize moyamoya syndrome in patients with Noonan syndrome. Early surgical revascularization should be pursued in order to prevent symptom progression.

Moyamoya syndrome is associated with meningitis, tuberculosis, syphilis, head trauma, head irradiation, brain tumor, von Recklinghausen's disease, tuberous sclerosis, Marfan syndrome, sickle cell anemia, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, and oral contraceptive use. To our knowledge, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as a cause of moyamoya syndrome has not been reported in an adult population. We report a case of moyamoya syndrome in a patient with AIDS and without other conditions associated with occlusion of the circle of Willis and formation of collateral network at the base of the brain and basal ganglia. We present a case report. A 29-year-old woman with an 8-year history of AIDS on multiple antiretroviral medications presented with recurrent tingling of the left extremities which 1 month later progressed to mild hemiparesis and dysarthria. During the next few months the patient developed progressive cognitive decline and on-and-off fluctuations in the degree of hemiparesis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple small subcortical infarct's in both parietal lobes. Magnetic resonance angiography showed occlusion of middle cerebral arteries distal internal carotid arteries, with prominent collateral network. Cerebral angiography confirmed moyamoya pattern. Lumbar puncture showed: white blood cell count 1, red blood cell count 418, protein 56, glucose 53, negative bacterial and acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, negative VDRL test, India ink, cryptococcal antigen, cytology and negative polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, and herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2. Electroencephalography showed diffuse background slowing. We hypothesize that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) caused central nervous system vasculitis, which eventually\n\nRuptured posterior ethmoidal artery aneurysm and Moyamoya disease in an adult patient. Case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nMÃ©lot, A; Chazot, J-V; Troude, L; De la Rosa, S; Brunel, H; Roche, P-H\n\n2016-06-01\n\nThe association between Moyamoya disease and intracranial aneurysms is well described. In our case, we describe a unique aneurismal location and its management. We report the case of a 74-year-old woman affected by a Moyamoya disease who displayed a frontal lobe hematoma. The origin of the bleeding came from the rupture of a posterior ethmoidal artery aneurysm that was treated surgically with favourable outcome. This case of a ruptured posterior ethmoidal artery aneurysm in a Moyamoya patient illustrates the polymorphism of the vascular complications encountered in this disease. It stresses the need to obtain information from an angiographic investigation in order to select the best therapeutic option and to reduce procedural complications.

This study aimed to analyze the literature about whether different bypass methods affect differently outcome results of adult moyamoya patients with symptoms or hemodynamic instability. A systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases was performedÂ for articles published between 1990 and 2015. Comparative studies about the effect of direct or combined bypass (direct bypass group) and indirect bypassÂ (indirect bypass group) in patients with moyamoyaÂ angiopathy at 18 years of age or older were selected. For stroke incidence at the end of the follow-up period, the degree of angiographic revascularization, hemodynamic improvement, and perioperative complication rates within 30 days, pooled relative risks were calculated between the 2 groups with a 95% confidence interval. A total of 8 articles (including 536 patients and 732 treated hemispheres) were included in the meta-analysis. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups when we compared the overall stroke rate, the hemodynamic improvement rate, or the perioperative complication rate at the end of the follow-up period. The direct bypass group, however, had a lower risk than the indirect bypass group for obtaining a poor angiographic revascularization rate (risk ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.84; PÂ = 0.02). The current meta-analysis suggests that the direct or combined bypass surgical method is better for angiographic revascularization in adult moyamoya patients with symptoms or hemodynamic instability. Future studies may be necessary to confirm these findings. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS This case-control study compared the data set of the Japan Adult Moyamoya (JAM) Trial with the angiographic data of adult patients with ischemic-onset MMD. The authors analyzed angiograms obtained at onset, classifying the collaterals into 3 subtypes: lenticulostriate anastomosis, thalamic anastomosis, and choroidal anastomosis. They then compared the extent of these collaterals, as indicated by the collateral development grade from 0 to 2 in each subtype, between the JAM Trial group and the ischemic-onset group. They also compared the involvement of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and Suzuki's angiographic staging between each group. RESULTS Among 89 ischemic-onset patients, 103 symptomatic hemispheres in 80 patients were analyzed and compared with 75 hemorrhagic hemispheres from the JAM Trial. The hemorrhagic-onset patients showed a significantly higher proportion of thalamic anastomosis (p = 0.043) and choroidal anastomosis (< 0.001), as indicated by grade 2 in each subtype, compared with ischemic-onset patients. Suzuki's angiographic staging was significantly higher in the hemorrhagic group (< 0.038). There was no difference in the extent of lenticulostriate anastomosis and PCA involvement between the groups. CONCLUSIONS In adult MMD, the characteristic pattern of the abnormal vascular networks at the base of the brain is different between each onset type. In light of the more prominent development of thalamic and choroidal anastomosis in the JAM Trial group in the present study, development of these collaterals, especially the choroidal collateral extending beyond the lateral ventricle, may play a critical role in hemorrhagic presentation in MMD.

Although relationships between Graves' disease and cerebrovascular accidents in Moyamoya disease are obscure, the coexistence of the two diseases is noteworthy. Moyamoya disease has been rarely reported in adolescent patients with thyrotoxicosis. Recently, we encountered two adolescent Korean patients with Moyamoya disease associated with Graves' disease who presented with episodic right-sided hemiparesis and syncope. These two girls who had Graves' disease had no history of other diseases or head trauma. A thyroid function test revealed a euthyroid state and a high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibody titer at that time. The patients were diagnosed with Moyamoya disease based on brain magnetic resonance angiography and cerebral four-vessel angiography. The patients underwent cranial revascularization by encephalo-duroarterio-synangiosis as soon as a diagnosis was made, which resulted in successful symptom resolution. They fared well and had no additional neurological symptoms as of their last follow-up visits. Here, we report these two cases of confirmed Moyamoya disease complicated by Graves' disease with a review of the literature, and discuss the possible association between the two diseases. To our knowledge, this is the first report in South Korea on Moyamoya disease associated with Graves' disease in adolescents with a euthyroid.\n\nMoyamoya vasculopathy - Patient demographics and characteristics in the Finnish population.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaarela, Marika; Mustanoja, Satu; Pekkola, Johanna; Tyni, Tiina; Hernesniemi, Juha; Kivipelto, Leena; Tatlisumak, Turgut\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground and purpose Moyamoya vasculopathy, a rare steno-occlusive progressive cerebrovascular disorder, has not been thoroughly studied in Caucasian populations. We established a registry of Finnish patients treated at the Helsinki University Hospital, to collect and report demographic and clinical data. Methods We collected data both retrospectively and prospectively from all the patients with a moyamoya vasculopathy referred to our hospital between January 1987 and December 2014. All patients underwent a neurological outpatient clinic visit. Results We diagnosed 61 patients (50 females, 10 children) with moyamoya vasculopathy. The mean age at the disease-onset was 31.5âÂ±â17.9 years. The two most common presenting symptoms were ischemic stroke (nâ=â31) and hemorrhage (nâ=â8). Forty-four percent underwent revascularization surgery, and 70% were prescribed antithrombotic treatment. Conclusions The results support in part the Western phenotype of the disease considering the later presentation and larger female predominance compared to the Asian moyamoya vasculopathy reports. However, the proportion of ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes is closer to Japanese population than German population. The absence of familial cases points to a different genetic profile in the Finnish patients.\n\nRadiation-induced moyamoya syndrome\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDesai, Snehal S.; Paulino, Arnold C.; Mai, Wei Y.\n\n2006-07-15\n\nPurpose: The moyamoya syndrome is an uncommon late complication after radiotherapy (RT). Methods and Materials: A PubMed search of English-language articles, with radiation, radiotherapy, and moyamoya syndrome used as search key words, yielded 33 articles from 1967 to 2002. Results: The series included 54 patients with a median age at initial RT of 3.8 years (range, 0.4 to 47). Age at RT was less than 5 years in 56.3%, 5 to 10 years in 22.9%, 11 to 20 years in 8.3%, 21 to 30 years in 6.3%, 31 to 40 years in 2.1%, and 41 to 50 years in 4.2%.moreÂ Â» Fourteen of 54 patients (25.9%) were diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). The most common tumor treated with RT was low-grade glioma in 37 tumors (68.5%) of which 29 were optic-pathway glioma. The average RT dose was 46.5 Gy (range, 22-120 Gy). For NF-1-positive patients, the average RT dose was 46.5 Gy, and for NF-1-negative patients, it was 58.1 Gy. The median latent period for development of moyamoya syndrome was 40 months after RT (range, 4-240). Radiation-induced moyamoya syndrome occurred in 27.7% of patients by 2 years, 53.2% of patients by 4 years, 74.5% of patients by 6 years, and 95.7% of patients by 12 years after RT. Conclusions: Patients who received RT to the parasellar region at a young age (<5 years) are the most susceptible to moyamoya syndrome. The incidence for moyamoya syndrome continues to increase with time, with half of cases occurring within 4 years of RT and 95% of cases occurring within 12 years. Patients with NF-1 have a lower radiation-dose threshold for development of moyamoya syndrome.Â«Â less\n\nRNF213 Rare Variants in Slovakian and Czech Moyamoya Disease Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nKobayashi, Hatasu; Brozman, Miroslav; KyselovÃ¡, KateÅina; ViszlayovÃ¡, DaÅ¡a; Morimoto, Takaaki; Roubec, Martin; Å koloudÃ­k, David; PetroviÄovÃ¡, Andrea; JuskaniÄ, Dominik; Strauss, Jozef; Halaj, MariÃ¡n; Kurray, Peter; Hranai, MariÃ¡n; Harada, Kouji H; Inoue, Sumiko; Yoshida, Yukako; Habu, Toshiyuki; Herzig, Roman; Youssefian, Shohab; Koizumi, Akio\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRNF213/Mysterin has been identified as a susceptibility gene for moyamoya disease, a cerebrovascular disease characterized by occlusive lesions in the circle of Willis. The p.R4810K (rs112735431) variant is a founder polymorphism that is strongly associated with moyamoya disease in East Asia. Many non-p.R4810K rare variants of RNF213 have been identified in white moyamoya disease patients, although the ethnic mutations have not been investigated in this population. In the present study, we screened for RNF213 variants in 19 Slovakian and Czech moyamoya disease patients. A total of 69 RNF213 coding exons were directly sequenced in 18 probands and one relative who suffered from moyamoya disease in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. We previously reported one proband harboring RNF213 p.D4013N. Results from the present study identified four rare variants other than p.D4013N (p.R4019C, p.E4042K, p.V4146A, and p.W4677L) in four of the patients. P.V4146A was determined to be a novel de novo mutation, and p.R4019C and p.E4042K were identified as double mutations inherited on the same allele. P.W4677L, found in two moyamoya disease patients and an unaffected subject in the same pedigree, was a rare single nucleotide polymorphism. Functional analysis showed that RNF213 p.D4013N, p.R4019C and p.V4146A-transfected human umbilical vein endothelial cells displayed significant lowered migration, and RNF213 p.V4146A significantly reduced tube formation, indicating that these are disease-causing mutations. Results from the present study identified RNF213 rare variants in 22.2% (4/18 probands) of Slovakian and Czech moyamoya disease patients, confirming that RNF213 may also be a major causative gene in a relative large population of white patients.\n\nRNF213 Rare Variants in Slovakian and Czech Moyamoya Disease Patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKyselovÃ¡, KateÅina; ViszlayovÃ¡, DaÅ¡a; Morimoto, Takaaki; Roubec, Martin; Å koloudÃ­k, David; PetroviÄovÃ¡, Andrea; JuskaniÄ, Dominik; Strauss, Jozef; Halaj, MariÃ¡n; Kurray, Peter; Hranai, MariÃ¡n; Harada, Kouji H.; Inoue, Sumiko; Yoshida, Yukako; Habu, Toshiyuki; Herzig, Roman; Youssefian, Shohab; Koizumi, Akio\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRNF213/Mysterin has been identified as a susceptibility gene for moyamoya disease, a cerebrovascular disease characterized by occlusive lesions in the circle of Willis.

Moyamoya syndrome, indistinguishable from moyamoya disease at presentation, is associated with multiple clinical conditions including neurofibromatosis type 1, autoimmune disease, prior radiation therapy, Down syndrome, and Turner syndrome. We present the first reported case of an adult patient with previously unrecognized mosaic Turner syndrome with acute subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage as the initial manifestation of moyamoya syndrome. A 52-year-old woman was admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage with associated flame-shaped intracerebral hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe. Physical examination revealed short stature, pectus excavatum, small fingers, micrognathia, and mild facial dysmorphism. Cerebral angiography showed features consistent with bilateral moyamoya disease, aberrant intrathoracic vessels, and an unruptured 4-mm right superior hypophyseal aneurysm. Genetic analysis confirmed a diagnosis of mosaic Turner syndrome. Our case report is the first documented presentation of adult moyamoya syndrome with subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage as the initial presentation of mosaic Turner syndrome. It illustrates the utility of genetic evaluation in patients with cerebrovascular disease and dysmorphism. Copyright Â© 2014 National Stroke Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to clarify the risk factors associated with postoperative ischemic complications and to discuss the appropriate perioperative management. Fifty-eight revascularization operations were performed in 37 children with moyamoya disease. Patients with moyamoya syndrome were excluded from this study. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed within 7 days after surgery. Postoperative cerebral infarction was defined as a diffusion-weighted imaging high-intensity lesion with or without symptoms. We usually use fentanyl and dexmedetomidine as postoperative analgesic and sedative drugs for patients with moyamoya disease. We used barbiturate coma therapy for pediatric patients with moyamoya disease who have all postoperative cerebral infarction risk factors. Postoperative ischemic complications were observed in 10.3% of the children with moyamoya disease (6Â of 58). Preoperative cerebral infarctions (PÂ = 0.0005), younger age (PÂ = 0.038), higher Suzuki grade (PÂ = 0.003), and posterior cerebral artery stenosis/occlusion (PÂ =Â 0.003) were related to postoperative ischemic complications. Postoperative cerebral infarction occurred all pediatric patients using barbiturate coma therapy. The risk factors associated with postoperative ischemic complications for children with moyamoya disease are preoperative infarction, younger age, higher Suzuki grade, and posterior cerebral artery stenosis/occlusion. Barbiturate coma therapy for pediatric patients with moyamoya disease who have the previous risk factors is insufficient for prevention of postoperative cerebral infarction. More studies are needed to identify the appropriate perioperative management. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

But their side effects and invasiveness make discomfort to patients. We evaluated the ivy sign on MR fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images in adult patients with moyamoya disease and compared it with result of SPECT and MR perfusion images. We enrolled twelve patients (thirteen cases) who were diagnosed with moyamoya disease and underwent STA-MCA anastomosis at our medical institution during a period ranging from September of 2010 to December of 2012. The presence of the ivy sign on MR FLAIR images was classified as Negative (0), Minimal (1), and Positive (2). Regions were classified into four territories: the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), the anterior MCA, the posterior MCA and the posterior cerebral artery. Ivy signs on preoperative and postoperative MR FLAIR were improved (8 and 4 in the ACA regions, 13 and 4 in the anterior MCA regions and 19 and 9 in the posterior MCA regions). Like this result, the cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) on SPECT was significantly increased in the sum of CVR in same regions after STA-MCA anastomosis. After STA-MCA anastomosis, ivy signs were decreased in the cerebral hemisphere. As compared with conventional diagnostic modalities such as SPECT and MR perfusion images, the ivy sign on MR FLAIR is considered as a useful indicator in detecting brain hemodynamic changes between preoperatively and postoperatively in adult moyamoya patients.\n\nThe Usefulness of the Ivy Sign on Fluid-Attenuated Intensity Recovery Images in Improved Brain Hemodynamic Changes after Superficial Temporal Artery-Middle Cerebral Artery Anastomosis in Adult Patients with Moyamoya Disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Jung Keun; Yoon, Byul Hee; Park, Moon Sun; Kim, Seong Min; Lee, Do Sung\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjective MR perfusion and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) are well known imaging studies to evaluate hemodynamic change between prior to and following superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomosis in moyamoya disease.

Among the 64 surgical patients, we evaluated collateral vessel formation after 2 years and divided patients into good (collateral grade A) or poor (collateral grade B and C) groups. The frequencies and distributions of four VEGF (â2578, â1154, â634, and 936) and KDR (â604, 1192, and 1719) polymorphisms were assessed from patients with moyamoya disease and compared to the control group. No differences were observed in VEGF â2578, â1154, â634, and 936 or KDR â604, 1192, and 1719 polymorphisms between the control group and moyamoya disease group. However, we found the â634CC genotype occurred less frequently in the pediatric moyamoya group (pâ=â0.040) whereas the KDR â604C/1192A/1719T haplotype increased the risk of pediatric moyamoya (pâ=â0.024). Patients with the CC genotype of VEGF â634 had better collateral vessel formation after surgery. Our results suggest that the VEGF â634G allele is associated with pediatric moyamoya disease and poor collateral vessel formation.

Occurring in 1 in 10,000 children without sex preference, it is the most common primordial microcephalic osteodysplastic dwarfism and has been associated with a variety of congenital brain malformations and intracranial aneurysms. Moyamoya syndrome is an idiopathic, chronic, progressive cerebrovascular disorder marked by stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid arteries and concurrent development of hypertrophied collateral vessels. These tortuous arterial collaterals appear radiographically as \"puffs of smoke,\" giving the syndrome its name. In this report, the authors describe the case of a 16-year-old girl with coincident Seckel and moyamoya syndromes. To their knowledge, this is the first reported case of such an association being treated with surgical revascularization. The patient presented with persistent headaches and a 2-year history of progressive hand, arm, and face numbness. Imaging studies revealed multiple completed cerebral infarcts, global ischemic changes, and vascular anatomy consistent with moyamoya syndrome. Bilateral pial synangioses successfully revascularized each hemisphere with resolution of the patient's symptoms. The patient died 1 year later of complications related to treatment of a rapidly progressing intracranial aneurysm. This report documents the first case associating moyamoya and Seckel syndromes. In addition, the report reveals the rapid development of an intracranial aneurysm in a patient with this syndrome. When coupled with previous reports of other types of cerebrovascular disease in patients with Seckel syndrome or other primordial dwarfisms, the authors' findings are important because they suggest that physicians treating patients with dwarfism should consider the diagnosis of\n\nEffect of Aspirin in Postoperative Management of Adult Ischemic Moyamoya Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Yahui; Zhang, Qian; Zhang, Dong; Zhao, Yuanli\n\n2017-09-01\n\nAspirin has been implicated in the postoperative management of moyamoya disease (MMD) in order to avoid bypass failure and decrease the incidence of subsequent stroke. However, its effect has not been completely determined yet. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed data of 184 adult patients (197 hemispheres) presented with ischemic-onset MMD who had undergone direct or combined revascularization in our hospital, to clarify the effect of postoperative aspirin therapy in the management of moyamoya disease. Fifty-nine hemispheres that had been administered with aspirin (100 mg/day) after bypass surgery were defined as the \"aspirin group,\" whereas 138 that hadn't been given aspirin postoperatively were defined as the \"control group\". Among 197 hemispheres, the mortality rate was 0. The incidence of postoperative newly developed infarction, transient ischemic attack, and hemorrhage were not significantly different between the aspirin and control groups. The patency rate of bypass graft was not significantly different between the groups, either. Notably, more patients experienced major stroke in the control group (9/138) than the aspirin group (1/59), but no statistical difference was found (P > 0.05). In the aspirin group, more patients had improved outcome than the control group (PÂ =Â 0.04). Our findings showed that aspirin might not decrease the incidence of postoperative ischemic stroke or increase patency rate of bypass graft, but it does not increase the risk of hemorrhages, either. Also, postoperative aspirin therapy might improve outcome. More studies are needed to provide evidence for postoperative antiplatelet therapy in MMD management. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A 22-year-old Japanese woman had left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarction complicated with Graves' disease. She had right-sided hemiparesis that deteriorated on day 8 with the infarct growth and thyrotoxicosis. On angiogram, the left MCA was occluded at the origin without moyamoya vessels. Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed misery-perfusion phenomenon in the left MCA territory. After initiation of the antithyroid therapy, her hemiparesis became milder. Seventeen months later, her thyroid function was normalized and net-like collateral moyamoya vessels proliferated in the left MCA territory. Misery-perfusion phenomenon persisted on PET. This report is unique in the pointÂ of neurologic recovery of the moyamoya patient right after initiation of antithyroid medication without radiological improvement.

To review 1 institution's surgical experience with both direct and indirect bypass (encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis) in adult and pediatric groups. A retrospective review was conducted of a consecutive series of patients treated for moyamoya angiopathy between 1995 and 2009. Thirty-nine adult patients underwent indirect bypass as their initial therapy; 29 adult patients underwent direct bypass. Twenty-four pediatric patients included 20 indirect bypasses and 4 direct bypasses. Overall, 140 hemispheres were treated; 48 patients received revascularization of both hemispheres. There were 14 additional revascularization procedures (10% per hemisphere) performed over a site of continued hypoperfusion postoperatively. Fourteen postoperative ischemic strokes occurred during the entire follow-up (10% per hemisphere), and the Kaplan-Meier analysis was not significantly different between groups (P = .59). Four grafts (9.09%) had failed at radiographic follow-up of the 44 direct bypasses performed. Before the initial surgery, the modified Rankin Scale score was 1.58 Â± 0.93, 1.48 Â± 0.74, and 1.8 Â± 1.1 in the pediatric, adult direct, and adult indirect groups (P = .39). At last follow-up, it was 1.29 Â± 1.31, 1.09 Â± 0.90, and 1.94 Â± 1.51 (P = .04) in the pediatric, adult direct, and adult indirect groups. This series demonstrates that both direct and indirect bypasses can be equally effective in preventing stroke. However, in adult patients, direct bypass patients had significantly greater improvement in symptoms, as seen in modified Rankin Scale scores. Pediatric patients, despite undergoing predominantly indirect bypasses, fared roughly the same as the adults in the direct bypass group.\n\n\"Ocular moyamoya\" syndrome in a patient with features of microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II.\n\nPubMed\n\nBang, Genie M; Kirmani, Salman; Patton, Alice; Pulido, Jose S; Brodsky, Michael C\n\n2013-02-01\n\nPrimordial dwarfism refers to severely impaired growth beginning early in fetal life. There are many genetic causes of primordial dwarfism, including disorders classified as microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism. Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II is an autosomal-recessive disease characterized by small stature, bone and dental anomalies, and characteristic facies. Affected patients have a high risk of stroke secondary to progressive cerebral vascular anomalies, which often are classified as moyamoya disease. We present the case of a boy with features suggestive of MOPD II with unilateral moyamoya cerebrovascular changes and correlative moyamoya collaterals involving the iris of the ipsilateral eye.

The disease has a particularly aggressive course in very young patients, and early surgical intervention is often necessary to prevent permanent neurological damage. MMD patients have an increased risk of stroke development, which may be provoked by pain or anxiety. Currently, no reports of pediatric patients with MMD exist in the dental literature. The purpose of this paper was to discuss the dental management of a two-year-old with moyamoya disease who presented with early childhood caries and dental fear, offering recommendations for dental providers with emphasis on stroke prevention, collaboration with the medical team, anesthesia considerations for patients with increased stroke risk, and the challenges to maintain the oral health of a patient undergoing complex medical treatment.\n\nLongitudinal anterior-to-posterior shift of collateral channels in patients with moyamoya disease: an implication for its hemorrhagic onset.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamamoto, Shusuke; Hori, Satoshi; Kashiwazaki, Daina; Akioka, Naoki; Kuwayama, Naoya; Kuroda, Satoshi\n\n2018-03-23\n\nOBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess longitudinal changes in the collateral channels originating from the lenticulostriate artery (LSA), posterior communicating artery (PCoA), and anterior and posterior choroidal arteries (AChA and PChA, respectively) during disease progression and/or aging. The impact of collateral channels on onset type was also examined. METHODS This study included 71 involved hemispheres in 41 patients with moyamoya disease. The disease was categorized into 6 stages according to Suzuki's angiographic staging system. The degree of development of each moyamoya vessel was categorized into 3 grades. RESULTS The LSA started to dilate in stage 2, showed the most prominent development in stage 3, and decreased in more advanced stages (p < 0.001). The AChA most notably developed in stage 3 and gradually shrank (p = 0.04). The PCoA started to dilate in stage 3 and showed the most prominent development in stage 4 (p = 0.03). The PChA started to dilate in stage 3 and showed the most prominent development in stages 4 to 5 (p < 0.001). Patient age was negatively related to LSA development (p = 0.01, R = 0.30) and was positively associated with the abnormal dilation and extension of the PCoA (p = 0.02, R = 0.28) and PChA (p < 0.001, R = 0.45). The PCoA, AChA, and PChA more distinctly developed in hemispheres with intracerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage than in hemispheres with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (p < 0.001, p = 0.03, and p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that the collateral channels through moyamoya vessels longitudinally shift from the anterior to posterior component during disease progression and aging, which may be closely related to the onset of hemorrhagic stroke in adult moyamoya disease.\n\nFeasibility of Multiple Burr Hole With Erythropoietin in Acute Moyamoya Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nHong, Ji Man; Lee, Seong-Joon; Lee, Jin Soo; Choi, Mun Hee; Lee, Sung Eun; Choi, Jin Wook; Lim, Yong Cheol\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIn patients with acute symptomatic moyamoya (<2 weeks), the feasibility of a combination therapy of multiple burr hole procedure under local anesthesia and intravenous erythropoietin pretreatment was assessed. We also identified the factors associated with transdural revascularization. In this prospective single-arm study, perfusion-impaired patients presenting with transient ischemic attack or acute cerebral infarction were assessed. Combination therapy was performed to patients lacking transdural collaterals. Primary outcomes were evaluated clinically with modified Rankin Scale scores and radiologically with revascularization success (transhemispheric, trans-burr hole, and sufficient revascularizations [filling â¥33% of ipsilateral supratentorium]) at 6 months. Treatment-related adverse events were analyzed in 3 phases: pre burr hole, post burr hole, and after-discharge as secondary outcome. Factors associated with sufficient revascularization were investigated. Fifty hemispheres from 37 patients were included. Compared with discharge, modified Rankin Scale score at 6 months significantly improved (2.0 [0.0-5.0] versus 1.0 [0.0-4.0]; P <0.001). Majority had successful revascularization: trans-burr hole arteriogenesis (89.5%), transhemispheric arteriogenesis (98.0%), and sufficient revascularization (52.0%). There was no significant pre burr hole or post burr hole complication. Two (5.4%) transient ischemic attack and 1 (2.7%) cerebral infarction occurred after discharge. Presentation with acute infarction (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-21.4), ipsilateral basal moyamoya vessels (odds ratio, 13.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-144.2), and delayed mean transit time (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-12.2) predicted sufficient revascularization. Combination therapy allows safe and effective revascularization in moyamoya patients with acute ischemic presentation. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT03162588.

Although sharing the same ischemic stimulus with atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, Moyamoya disease is characterized by a highly instable cerebrovascular system which is prone to rupture due to pathological neovascularization. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this instability, angiopoietin-2 gene expression was analyzed in middle cerebral artery lesions obtained from Moyamoya disease and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease patients. Angiopoietin-2 was significantly up-regulated in Moyamoya vessels, while serum concentrations of soluble angiopoietins were not changed. For further evaluations, cerebral endothelial cells incubated with serum from these patients inÂ vitro were applied. In contrast to atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease serum, Moyamoya disease serum induced an angiopoietin-2 overexpression and secretion, accompanied by loss of endothelial integrity. These effects were absent or inverse in endothelial cells of non-brain origin suggesting brain endothelium specificity. The destabilizing effects on brain endothelial cells to Moyamoya disease serum were partially suppressed by the inhibition of angiopoietin-2. Our findings define brain endothelial cells as the potential source of vessel-destabilizing factors inducing the high plasticity state and disintegration in Moyamoya disease in an autocrine manner. We also provide new insights into Moyamoya disease pathophysiology that may be helpful for preventive treatment strategies in future.

To evaluate hemodynamic changes in MCAt and ACAt after bypass surgery in adult moyamoya disease. Combined bypass surgery was performed on 140 hemispheres in 126 patients with MCAt symptoms. Among them, 87 hemispheres (62.1%) accompanied preoperative ACAt symptoms. Clinical, hemodynamic, and angiographic states were evaluated preoperatively and approximately 6Â months after surgery. Preoperative symptoms resolved in 127 MCAt (90.7%) and 82 ACAt (94.3%). Hemodynamic analysis of total patients showed a significant improvement in MCAt basal perfusion and reservoir capacity ( P < .001 and P = .002, respectively) and ACAt basal perfusion ( P = .001). In a subgroup analysis, 82 hemispheres that completely recovered from preoperative ACAt symptoms showed a significant improvement in MCAt basal perfusion and reservoir capacity ( P < .001 and P = .05, respectively) and ACAt basal perfusion ( P = .04). Meanwhile, 53 hemispheres that had never experienced ACAt symptoms significantly improved MCAt basal perfusion and reservoir capacity ( P < .001 and P = .05, respectively); however, no ACAt changes were observed. A qualitative angiographic analysis demonstrated a higher trend of leptomeningeal formation from MCAt to ACAt in the former subgroup ( P = .05). During follow-up, no ACAt infarctions were observed. Combined bypass surgery at MCAt resulted in hemodynamic improvements in ACAt and MCAt, especially in patients with preoperative ACAt symptoms.

Maintaining blood pressure within the range of functional cerebrovascular blood pressure autoregulation might reduce the risk of perioperative neurologic injury. We tested whether blood pressure autoregulation is associated with postoperative transient ischemic attack in a study of patients with pediatric moyamoya vasculopathy. We conducted an observational study of 15 pediatric patients undergoing surgical revascularization with pial synangiosis. Nine patients had bilateral moyamoya and 6 had unilateral moyamoya. We measured autoregulatory vasoreactivity intraoperatively and during the first postoperative night with the hemoglobin volume index, a value derived from near-infrared spectroscopy. We also identified the optimal mean arterial blood pressure at which autoregulation was most robust in each patient. Of the 15 children monitored, 3 with bilateral moyamoya and one with unilateral moyamoya experienced a transient ischemic attack. Poorer autoregulation during surgery was associated with postoperative transient ischemic attack among those with bilateral vasculopathy (P = .048, difference in hemoglobin volume index medians: 0.023, 95% confidence interval: 0.003-0.071). This relationship was not observed with postoperative autoregulation. The optimal mean arterial blood pressure was identifiable during surgery in all monitored patients, varied among patients, and often differed between the intraoperative and postoperative periods. Dysfunctional intraoperative autoregulation may increase the risk of TIA in patients with pediatric moyamoya vasculopathy. The blood pressure range that supports autoregulation appears to vary among patients. Using autoregulation monitoring to guide individualized blood pressure goals should be studied as a potential method to reduce perioperative neurologic morbidity in pediatric patients with moyamoya.

The institutional review board approved this prospective study, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. A prospective study was conducted in 78 subjects with moyamoya disease (of whom 31 underwent unilateral direct arterial anastomosis). The concordance between the cerebrovascular reactivity index values from arterial spin labeling and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was assessed by using Bland-Altman analysis, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of arterial spin labeling to depict impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (in which the cerebrovascular reactivity index value is less than 0% on SPECT images). The cerebrovascular reactivity index from arterial spin labeling had a lower value than that from SPECT (mean difference, -4.2%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for arterial spin labeling in the detection of impaired cerebrovascular reactivity was at least 0.85. On the anastomotic side, a significant increase was found between the cerebrovascular reactivity index values on arterial spin labeling images obtained preoperatively and those obtained 6 months after surgery, as well as on SPECT images (mean Â± standard deviation values of cerebrovascular reactivity index increased by 5.9% Â± 10.9 and 3.0% Â± 6.3 for arterial spin labeling and SPECT, respectively). Arterial spin labeling has excellent performance in the identification of impaired cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with moyamoya disease, and it has the potential to serve as a noninvasive imaging tool to monitor cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with moyamoya disease.

The incidence of moyamoya disease in Europe is lower than in Asia and its clinical course in European population is probably different from Asiatic (older age of onset and rare incidence of hemorrhagic strokes). Two young patients were diagnosed as moyamoya disease on the basis of clinical symptoms (ischaemic stroke) and results of brain vessels' angiography, which documented an occlusion of both internal carotid arteries above branching-off the ocular arteries in the first patient and stenosis of distal internal carotid arteries and proximal medial and anterior cerebral arteries in the second one. Both patients are under control of the Neurological Outpatient Department and their neurological state is stable. Despite that moyamoya disease is a rare cause of ischaemic stroke, it should be always considered as one of etiologic factors, especially in young patients.\n\nRevascularization experience and results in ischaemic cerebrovascular disease: Moyamoya disease and carotid occlusion.\n\nPubMed\n\nArikan, Fuat; Rubiera, Marta; Serena, JoaquÃ­n; RodrÃ­guez-HernÃ¡ndez, Ana; GÃ¡ndara, DarÃ­o; Lorenzo-Bosquet, Carles; Tomasello, Alejandro; ChocrÃ³n, Ivette; Quintana-Corvalan, Maximiliano; Sahuquillo, Juan\n\n2018-03-14\n\nCerebral revascularization techniques are an indispensable tool in the current armamentarium of vascular neurosurgeons. We present revascularization surgery experience and results in both moyamoya disease and occlusive cerebral ischaemia. Patients with ischaemic occlusive disease and moyamoya disease who underwent microsurgical revascularization between October 2014 and September 2017 were analysed. In the study period, 23 patients with occlusive ischaemic disease underwent microsurgical revascularization. Three patients presented with serious postoperative complications (2 intraparenchymal haemorrhages in the immediate postoperative period and one thrombosis of the femoral artery). All patients, except one, achieved normalization of the cerebral hemodynamic reserve (CHR) in the SPECT study. Twenty patients had a good neurological result, with no ischaemic recurrence of the revascularized territory. Among patients with moyamoya, 20 had moyamoya disease and 5 had moyamoya syndrome with unilateral involvement. Five patients were treated at paediatric age. Haemorrhagic onset occurred in 2 patients. The CHR study showed hemodynamic compromise in all patients. Cerebral SPECT at one year showed resolution of the hemodynamic failure in all patients. There have been 4 postoperative complications (acute subdural hematoma, two subdural collections and one dehiscence of the surgical wound). No patient presented with neurological worsening at 6 and 12months of follow-up. Cerebral revascularization through end-to-side anastomosis between the superficial temporal artery and a cortical branch of the middle cerebral artery is an indisputable technique in the treatment of moyamoya disease and possibly in a subgroup of patients with symptomatic occlusive ischaemic cerebrovascular disease.

Whereas direct bypass offers immediate revascularization, indirect bypass can effectively induce collaterals over time. Using angiography and quantitative magnetic resonance angiography, we examined the relative contributions of direct and indirect bypass in moyamoya patients after combined direct superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass and indirect encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS). A retrospective review of moyamoya patients undergoing combined STA-MCA bypass and EDAS was conducted, excluding pediatric patients and hemorrhagic presentation. Patients with quantitative magnetic resonance angiography measurements of the direct bypass immediately and > 6 months postoperatively were included. Angiographic follow-up, when available, was used to assess EDAS collaterals at similar time intervals. Of 16 hemispheres in 13 patients, 11 (69%) demonstrated a significant (> 50%) decline in direct bypass flow at > 6 months compared with baseline, averaging a drop from 99 Â± 35 to 12 Â± 7 mL/min. Conversely, angiography in these hemispheres demonstrated prominent indirect collaterals, in concert with shrinkage of the STA graft. Decline in flow was apparent at a median of 9 months but was evident as early as 2 to 3 months. In this small cohort, a reciprocal relationship between direct STA bypass flow and indirect EDAS collaterals frequently occurred. This substantiates the notion that combined direct/indirect bypass can provide temporally complementary revascularization.\n\nThyroid Autoantibodies and the Clinical Presentation of Moyamoya Disease: A Prospective Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLanterna, Luigi A; Galliani, Silvia; Zangari, Rosalia; Conti, Luciano; Brembilla, Carlo; Gritti, Paolo; Colleoni, Maria Luisa; Bernucci, Claudio\n\n2018-05-01\n\nMoyamoya is a rare cerebrovascular disease characterized by the progressive occlusion of the intracranial carotid artery. Thyroid autoantibodies have been found to be associated with the disease, but their clinical significance has never been studied. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between thyroid autoantibodies and the clinical presentation of moyamoya. This is a prospective study including 37 patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) or unilateral moyamoya (uMM). Thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies (e.g., antithyroperoxidase and antithyroglobulin) were investigated. We studied the effect of gender, age, type of moyamoya (uMM versus MMD), and thyroid autoantibodies on the clinical presentation, dichotomized into aggressive (hemorrhage, major stroke, or frequent transient ischemic attack [TIA]) and nonaggressive presentation (headache, rare TIAs, and incidental diagnosis) according to the criteria of the Research Committee on Spontaneous Occlusion of the Circle of Willis. Of the 37 patients included in the study, the autoantibodies were elevated in 9 (24.3%). An aggressive presentation occurred in 21 patients (hemorrhage in 11, major stroke in 9, frequent TIAs in 1). The autoantibodies were elevated in 8 of the 21 patients (38.09%) with an aggressive presentation and in 1 of those presenting with minor symptoms (6.2%). The presence of elevated autoantibodies was the only variable associated with an aggressive presentation in the multivariate logistic analysis (Pâ=â.048). When the serum concentration of the thyroid autoantibodies is increased, the patients have a higher risk of an aggressive presentation. Our results support the hypothesis that activation of immune-mediated processes affects the moyamoya physiopathology. Copyright Â© 2018 National Stroke Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Design Retrospective, multicentre, non-randomised, observational study. Setting Nationwide registry data in Japan. Participants A total of 1925 patients with non-haemorrhagic moyamoya disease admitted between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2014 in Japan. Main outcome measure We performed propensity score-matched analysis to examine the association between prehospital antiplatelet use and no significant disability on hospital admission, as defined by a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1. Results Propensity-matched patients who received prehospital antiplatelet drugs were associated with a good outcome on hospital admission (OR adjusted for all covariates, 3.82; 95% CI 1.22 to 11.99) compared with those who did not receive antiplatelet drugs prior to hospital admission. Conclusions Prehospital antiplatelet use was significantly associated with good functional status on hospital admission among patients with non-haemorrhagic moyamoya disease in Japan. Our results suggest that prehospital antiplatelet use should be considered when evaluating outcomes of patients with non-haemorrhagic moyamoya disease.

We previously discovered elevated levels of m/z 4588 and m/z 4473 peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with MMD. This study examined the amino acid sequences of these peptides and quantified in specimens. The m/z 4588 and m/z 4473 peptides in CSF from patients with MMD were purified and concentrated by high-performance liquid chromatography and ultrafiltration. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed to identify the amino acid sequences of these peptides. We quantified these peptides in samples using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and concentrations in CSF were compared between MMD (nÂ = 40, 19 male; median age, 37 years) and non-MMD intracranial disease (nÂ = 40, 19 male; median age, 39 years) as controls. These peptides were identified as proenkephalin 143-183 (PENK 143-183). The concentration of PENK 143-183 was significantly greater in patients with MMD (median, 8,270 pmol/L) than control patients (median, 3,760 pmol/L; P < 0.001) and decreased in an age-dependent manner in MMD (rÂ =Â -0.57; P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in children (age <18 years) was 0.885 (95% confidence interval 0.741-1). The correlation between proenkephalin concentration and temporal changes in moyamoya vessels was suggested. Proenkephalin 143-183 in CSF may offer a helpful diagnostic biomarker in pediatric MMD. The effect of enkephalin peptides through opioid growth factor receptor or delta opioid receptor might be associated with the pathophysiology of MMD. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Leigh syndrome is a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy that occurs due to \"cytochrome c oxidase deficiency\" characterized by psychomotor retardation, difficulty in eating, seizures, hypotonia, respiratory disorders and high lactate levels. Many diseases and syndromes have been defined that are associated with Moyamoya disease. To the best of our knowledge, the association of moyamoya disease with Leigh syndrome has not been defined as yet. In this study, the clinical and imaging results of a 3-year-old male child displaying the association of Moyamoya disease and Leigh syndrome are presented.\n\nMoyamoya syndrome in a patient with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, Jin-Ho; Oh, Moon-Yeon; Yum, Mi-Sun; Lee, Beom Hee; Kim, Gu-Hwan; Yoo, Han-Wook\n\n2015-03-01\n\nNoonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair is one of the RASopathies characterized by Noonan syndrome-like features with unique ectodermal abnormalities. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the SHOC2 gene. We encountered a patient with moyamoya syndrome associated with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair presenting with transient ischemic attacks. A 6-year-old girl was diagnosed with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair because of profound short stature and ectodermal anomalies such as sparse and easily pluckable hair. A heterozygous mutation of c.4A>G (p.S2G) in the SHOC2 gene was identified, and recombinant human growth hormone therapy was initiated at 8 years of age. At age 10, she manifested recurrent left hemiplegia. Moreover, cerebrovascular imaging revealed occlusion or narrowing of both internal carotid arteries and both middle cerebral arteries with distal moyamoya-like vessels. She is treated with aspirin and calcium channel blocker. We describe the first case of Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair associated with moyamoya syndrome, although it has been reported to be associated with a few cases of other RASopathies, including Noonan, cardiofaciocutaneous, and Costello syndromes. This report emphasizes the associations between cerebrovascular anomalies and Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

When the standard superficial temporal artery (STA) cannot be used for a graft, the posterior auricular artery (PAA) can be a potential surrogate graft. In this article, the authors reported a 34-year-old female patient suffering from ischemic moyamoya disease. To widely revascularize the anterior half of the hemisphere, direct double EC-IC bypass was considered beneficial; however, she had only a single-branched STA but had a prominent branch of the PAA. After discussion, a direct double surgical revascularization was successfully performed using a combination of the STA-middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the PAA-MCA bypass. The authors herein reported the detailed surgical technique of the PAA-MCA bypass with an informative video of the actual procedure. To clearly define the feasibility of PAA-MCA bypass, the authors also conducted a literature review, yielding 3 previous articles describing the bypass. In conclusion, the PAA becomes a potential donor for EC-IC bypass as long as its diameter is approximately 1.0 mm. Even though the PAA-MCA bypass is not primarily considered in the initial revascularization, it can be useful as a combination bypass with other grafts or as a rescue for recurrent ischemia.

The purpose of this study was to delineate the efficacy of this surgical method in the treatment of hemorrhagic MMD. Between January 2007 and August 2011, a consecutive cohort of 113 patients with hemorrhagic MMD was enrolled into this prospective single-center cohort study. The surgical method was combined direct and indirect bypass. The cumulative probability of the primary end point (all stroke and deaths from surgery through 30 days after surgery and ipsilateral recurrent hemorrhage afterward) was analyzed. The angiographic outcome was measured by the following parameters: bypass patency, reduction of basal MMD vessels, improved degree of dilation, and branch extension of the anterior choroidal and posterior communicating arteries (AChA-PCoA). Of the 113 enrolled cases, CT scans revealed pure intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in 63 cases (55.7%), pure intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in 14 cases (12.4%), and ICH with IVH in 36 cases (31.9%). In 74 of 113 hemorrhagic hemispheres (65.5%), the AChA-PCoA was extremely dilated with extensive branches beyond the choroidal fissure. A total of 114 surgeries were performed. No patient suffered ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke through 30 days after surgery. Ipsilateral rebleeding occurred in 5 patients, 4 of whom died of the rebleeding event. The cumulative probability of the primary end point was 0% at 1 year and 1.9% at 2 years. The annual rebleeding rate was 1.87%/person/year. The improvement in AChA-PCoA extension was observed in 75 of 107 operated hemispheres (70.1%), which was higher than that in 7 of 105 unoperated hemispheres (35.2%). Revascularization may provide a benefit over conservative therapy for hemorrhagic MMD patients. The improvement of dilation and branch extension of AChA-PCoA might be correlated with the low rebleeding rate.\n\nEfficacy of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery double anastomoses in a patient with rapidly progressive moyamoya disease: case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nYokosawa, Michiko; Hayashi, Toshiaki; Shirane, Reizo; Tominaga, Teiji\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMoyamoya disease can be associated with a rapidly progressive course in young patients. This report describes a patient with moyamoya disease who experienced rapid disease progression, resulting in cerebral infarction and a wide area of diminished cerebral perfusion. Double superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomoses were utilized to immediately increase cerebral perfusion in the affected area. This case involved a 5-year-old girl who had been diagnosed with moyamoya disease and had undergone STA-MCA anastomosis with indirect bypass in the right hemisphere at the age of 3. At the time of presentation, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed cerebral infarction at the left frontal lobe, and MR angiography showed rapidly progressive narrowing of the left MCA that had not been present 3 months prior. N-isopropyl-p-[I123] iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography (IMP-SPECT) showed markedly decreased uptake in the left hemisphere. She underwent emergent STA-MCA double anastomoses with indirect bypass on the left side. IMP-SPECT showed marked increase in uptake in the left hemisphere. The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory adjacent to the cerebral infarction also showed increased uptake on the SPECT. Postoperatively, there were no clinical or radiographic indications of ischemic or hemorrhagic complications. Double anastomoses are effective in quickly and significantly increasing blood flow. The postoperative course in this case was uneventful. Double anastomoses are a surgical option for patients with moyamoya disease who show rapid disease progression, even in those in the acute phase of cerebral infarction.\n\nEfficacy of Superficial Temporal Artery-Middle Cerebral Artery Double Anastomoses in a Patient with Rapidly Progressive Moyamoya Disease: Case Report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYOKOSAWA, Michiko; HAYASHI, Toshiaki; SHIRANE, Reizo; TOMINAGA, Teiji\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMoyamoya disease can be associated with a rapidly progressive course in young patients.

To evaluate the longitudinal changes associated with combined procedures while following up pediatric and adult patients long term and to assess whether any other clinical factors or hemodynamic parameters affected these changes to determine an optimal surgical strategy. We studied 58 hemispheres in 43 adults and 39 hemispheres in 26 children who underwent combined revascularization for moyamoya disease. To evaluate bypass development, we assessed the sizes of the superficial temporal artery and middle meningeal artery using magnetic resonance angiography. Multivariate analysis determined the effects of multiple variables on bypass development. Indirect bypass (middle meningeal artery) development occurred in 95% and 78% of the pediatric and adult hemispheres, respectively. Of these, dual development of direct and indirect bypasses occurred in 54% of the pediatric hemispheres and in 47% of the adult hemispheres. Reciprocal superficial temporal artery regression occurred in 28% of the hemispheres during the transition from the postoperative acute phase to the chronic phase during indirect bypass development. Good indirect bypass development was associated with adult hemispheres at Suzuki stage 4 or greater (odds ratio, 7.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-39.4; P = .02). Disease onset type and preoperative hemodynamic parameters were not considered predictors for the development of surgical revascularization. Simultaneous direct and indirect bypass development was most frequently observed, regardless of patient age and hemodynamic status. Applying indirect bypass as an adjunct to direct bypass could maximize revascularization in adults and children.\n\nPosterior Circulation Moyamoya Disease versus Primitive Vertebral-Basilar Artery System Moyamoya Disease: New Classification of Moyamoya Disease from the Perspective of Embryology.\n\nPubMed\n\nTan, Cunxin; Duan, Ran; Ye, Xun; Zhang, Dong; Wang, Rong\n\n2016-12-01\n\nMoyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic cerebrovascular disorder with little known etiology. We aim to propose a new classification system for MMD from the perspective of embryology. MMD patients' digital subtraction angiograms were retrospectively analyzed. Every angiogram was analyzed to find the abnormal vessels and from which part of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) the lesions begin. In 262 MMD cases, 32 pediatric patients had PCA involvement, of which 17 were male and 15 were female; 68 adults had PCA involvement, of which 33 were male and 35 were female. The initially affected part of the PCA was compared between sexes and between pediatric and adult patients, and the findings are not statistically significant (PÂ = 0.233, PÂ = 0.855, PÂ = 0.343, respectively). However, of the 100 cases with PCA involvement, only 4 had the lesions begin from the first part of the PCA, and all of the 4 cases had the basilar artery lesions. All the other 96 cases had the lesions begin from the second part of the PCA or from the posterior communication artery, which is derived from the caudal ramus of the primitive intracarotid artery, leaving the first part of the PCA and basilar artery excluded from affection. MMD should be classified into primitive intracarotid artery system-involved type and primitive vertebral basilar artery system-involved type. The reason that the vertebral basilar artery is so rarely involved in MMD might be because of its late development in the brain. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Thyroid storm may cause cerebral ischemia in Moyamoya disease, which can coexist in patients with Graves' disease. A 16-year-old girl complaining of dizziness and palpitations visited the emergency department and was diagnosed with DKA combined with hyperthyroidism. A thyroid storm occurred 6 h after the start of DKA management. Her Burch and Wartofsky score was 65 points. Right hemiplegia developed during the thyroid storm, and brain magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted images revealed multiple acute infarcts in both hemispheres. MR angiography showed stenosis of both distal internal carotid arteries and both M1 portions of the middle cerebral arteries, consistent with Moyamoya disease. After acute management for the thyroid storm with methimazole, Lugol solution and hydrocortisone, the patient's neurological symptoms completely resolved within 1 month, and free T4 level normalized within 2 months. Thyroid storm may trigger cerebral ischemia in Moyamoya disease and lead to rapid progression of cerebrovascular occlusive disease. As a simultaneous occurrence of DKA, thyroid storm and cerebrovascular accident in Moyamoya disease highly elevates morbidity and mortality, prompt recognition and management are critical to save the patient's life.\n\nMoyamoya disease in two patients with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair.\n\nPubMed\n\nLo, Fu-Sung; Wang, Chao-Jan; Wong, Mun-Ching; Lee, Ni-Chung\n\n2015-06-01\n\nMoyamoya disease is a unique chronic cerebrovascular condition caused by progressive stenosis of the arteries around the circle of Willis with prominent arterial collateral circulation. Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NSLH) is characterized by short stature, characteristic facial phenotype, darkly pigmented and hairless skin, mild psychomotor delay with attention deficit disorder, and easily pluckable, sparse, thin, slow growing hair. Mutations in SHOC2 have been reported to underlie NSLH. In this paper, we describe two individuals with NSLH who also have moyamoya disease and in whom heterozygous germline mutation in SHOC2 was found.

PHACE arteriopathies may be progressive and recently have been categorized based on the risk of acute ischemic stroke, increasing attention to the potentially devastating consequences of cerebrovascular complications in this syndrome. In contrast, the natural history of arteriopathy in PHACE syndrome remains poorly understood. At the moment, there are no established surgical guidelines for high-risk vasculopathies, including quasi-moyamoya, in this syndrome. We described the clinicoradiologic features of a small series of 6 patients with PHACE syndrome and quasi-moyamoya (5 female, age range 4 months to 12 years), focusing on the clinical course and surgical outcome of 3 children who were treated with encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis and encephalomyosynangiosis. In addition, we reviewed the radiologic, clinical, and surgical aspects of moyamoya vasculopathy in PHACE syndrome, providing information on 15 additional published cases. Although the natural history of arteriopathy in PHACE syndrome is poorly understood, patients with high-risk vasculopathies, such as quasi-moyamoya disease, may benefit of revascularization by using encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis and encephalomyosynangiosis.

There is an association between moyamoya vasculopathy and Graves disease, primarily in Asian populations. Here, we present the largest series of non-Asian, predominantly Latino patients with moyamoya vasculopathy in the setting of Graves thyrotoxicosis, as well as the largest review of the literature to date. We retrospectively analyzed patients presenting with stroke in the setting of clinical Graves disease to our institution from 2004 to 2014. Moyamoya vasculopathy was diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography in all patients. Eight patients with Graves disease thyrotoxicosis and moyamoya vasculopathy were identified. Six patients were effectively managed with aggressive medical management using antithyroid and antiplatelet medications. No recurrent strokes were noted once thyrotoxicosis was controlled. Intracranial bypass was necessary in 2 patients who failed medical management. Seventy-nine additional cases were reported from the literature. There was no significant difference in clinical improvement between medical therapy alone and medical therapy with neurosurgical prophylaxis (87.0% vs. 88.0%, respectively; PÂ = 0.94). Moyamoya vasculopathy associated with Graves disease thyrotoxicosis in non-Asian women may be more common than previously thought. In addition, our series suggests that thyrotoxicosis promotes the progression of vasculopathy. Based on our review, there is no significant difference in clinical improvement between proper medical and surgical therapies. Aggressive medical therapy should be considered first-line treatment for moyamoya vasculopathy with Graves thyrotoxicosis, with neurosurgical rescue reserved for medically refractory cases.

This study aimed to evaluate morphologic patterns and the delineation of deeply seated collateral networks using ultra-high-field MRA in comparison with conventional DSA. Fifteen white patients with Moyamoya angiopathy were investigated in this prospective trial. Sequences acquired at 7T were TOF-MRA with 0.22 Ã 0.22 Ã 0.41 mm 3 resolution and MPRAGE with 0.7 Ã 0.7 Ã 0.7 mm 3 resolution. Four raters evaluated the presence of deeply seated collateral networks and image quality in a consensus reading of DSA, TOF-MRA, and MPRAGE using a 5-point scale in axial source images and maximum intensity projections. Delineation of deeply seated collateral networks by different imaging modalities was compared by means of the McNemar test, whereas image quality was compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The relevant deeply seated collateral networks were classified into 2 categories and 6 pathways. A total of 100 collateral networks were detected on DSA; 106, on TOF-MRA; and 73, on MPRAGE. Delineation of deeply seated collateral networks was comparable between TOF-MRA and DSA ( P = .25); however, both were better than MPRAGE ( P < .001). This study demonstrates excellent delineation of 6 distinct deeply seated collateral network pathways in Moyamoya angiopathy in white adults using 7T TOF-MRA, comparable to DSA.

However, the clinical significance of the champagne bottle neck sign is unclear. We investigated the relationship between the champagne bottle neck sign and the clinical and hemodynamic stages of Moyamoya disease. We analyzed 14 patients with Moyamoya disease before revascularization (5 men, 9 women; age, 43.2 Â± 19.3 years). The ratio of the extracranial ICA and common carotid artery diameters was determined using carotid ultrasonography or cerebral angiography; a ratio of < 0.5 was considered champagne bottle neck sign-positive. The clinical disease stage was determined using the Suzuki angiographic grading system. CBF and cerebral vasoreactivity also were measured. The ICA/common carotid artery ratio (expressed as median [interquartile range]) decreased as the clinical stage advanced (stages I-II, 0.71 [0.60-0.77]; stages III-IV, 0.49 [0.45-0.57]; stages V-VI, 0.38 [0.34-0.47]; P < .001). Lower ICA/common carotid artery ratio tended to occur in symptomatic versus asymptomatic arteries (0.47 [0.40-0.53] versus 0.57 [0.40-0.66], respectively; P = .06). Although the ICA/common carotid artery ratio was not related to cerebral perfusion, it decreased as cerebral vasoreactivity decreased (P < .01). All champagne bottle neck sign-positive arteries were classified as Suzuki stage â¥III, 73% were symptomatic, and 89% exhibited reduced cerebral vasoreactivity. In contrast, all champagne bottle neck sign-negative arteries were Suzuki stage â¤III, 67% were asymptomatic, and all showed preserved cerebral vasoreactivity. The champagne bottle neck sign was related to advanced clinical stage, clinical symptoms, and impaired cerebral vasoreactivity. Thus, detection of the champagne bottle neck sign might be useful in determining the clinical and hemodynamic stages of Moyamoya disease.

We present a patient with JMML who developed moyamoya disease and neovascular glaucoma. Our patient exhibited a Noonan syndrome-like phenotype. Genetic analysis revealed acquired isodisomy and a germline heterozygous mutation in CBL. This is a rare case of CBL mutation associated with moyamoya disease.

Similar surgical principles are employed in adult cases, often performed because of lack of an adequate donor vessel. Standardized protocols, including preadmission for preoperative intravenous hydration and aspirin administration, as well as intraoperative electroencephalography, are routinely employed to minimize operative risk. Perioperative heparinization is not required. The patient is positioned supine, without skull fixation, and the parietal branch of the superficial temporal artery is mapped with Doppler ultrasonography. The artery is microscopically dissected from distal to proximal, leaving a cuff of tissue around the vessel and elevated from the temporalis. The microscope is then removed, the temporalis is opened in a cruciate fashion, and a generous craniotomy is performed, with care to drill away from the exposed artery. The dura is then opened widely (preserving dural collateral vessels), followed by microscopic opening of the arachnoid in as many areas as possible. The donor vessel is then sutured to the pia with 10-0 nylons. The dural leaflets are laid on the brain (without suturing). Closure is completed with saline-soaked gelfoam, with fixation of the bone flap, and muscle reapproximation in the horizontal plane. The galea is closed, followed by the use of resorbable skin suture in pediatric patients. If indicated, the second hemisphere may be performed under the same anesthetic, reducing anesthetic risks and avoiding delayed revascularization. Postoperatively, the patient is awakened and transferred to the intensive care unit.\n\nHow to minimize ischemic complication related to swollen temporalis muscle following indirect revascularization surgery in moyamoya disease: a technical report.\n\nPubMed\n\nJoo, Sung Pil; Kim, Tae Sun; Moon, Hyung Sik\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThere are several reports in the literature of postoperative ischemic events due to swelling of the temporalis muscle after indirect revascularization surgery. Here, we report our surgical technique for preventing ischemic events during the acute postoperative recovery period in moyamoya patients. We used various types of titanium mesh to cover the bony defect area in 8 patients (10 operations) with moyamoya disease. The mesh was cut and manipulated according to the shape of the bony defect. Surgical results were favorable, with no newly developed ischemic event or infarction in the acute recovery period. The mesh formed an outer table of skull, so there was no compressive effect on the temporalis muscle and no cosmetic defects. The titanium mesh appears to be effective and useful for prevention of ischemic insult in the treatment of moyamoya disease. The choice of this procedure depends on both the operative findings of temporalis muscle thickness and the status of ischemic vulnerability of moyamoya brain.

To date, the pathogenesis of Moyamoya is unknown. Improved understanding of the changes to vascular geometry and fluid mechanics of the carotid siphon during disease may improve understanding of the pathogenesis, prognosis techniques and disease management. A retrospective analysis of Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) images was performed for Moyamoya pediatric patients (MMD) (nÂ =Â 23) and control (Ctrl) pediatric patients (nÂ =Â 20). The Ctrl group was composed of patients who complained of headache and had normal MRA. We performed segmentation of MRA images to quantify geometric parameters of the artery. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was performed to quantify the hemodynamic parameters. MMD internal carotid and carotid siphons were smaller in cross-sectional areas, and shorter in curved vascular length. Vascular curvature remained constant over age and vascular size and did not change between Ctrl and MMD, but MMD carotid siphon had lower tortuosity in the posterior bend, and higher torsion in the anterior bend. Wall shear stress and secondary flows were significantly lower in MMD, but the ratio of secondary flow kinetic energy to primary flow kinetic energy were similar between MMD and Ctrl. There were alterations to both the geometry and the flow mechanics of the carotid siphons of Moyamoya patients but it is unclear whether hemodynamics is the cause or the effect of morphological changes observed.\n\nDevelopment of atherosclerotic-moyamoya syndrome with genetic variant of RNF213 p.R4810K and p.T1727M: A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Ying; Wu, Xueying; Fan, Zhaoyang; Cheng, Jingdan; Zhong, Lele; Lin, Yongzhong; Qu, Xiaofeng\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe report a rare case of atherosclerotic-moyamoya syndrome (A-MMS) in an adult female with genetic variant of both ring finger 213 (RNF213) p.R4810K and p.T1727M. A 46-year-old previously healthy, right-handed woman displayed transient slurred speech, which started to worsen four years ago. Initial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed stenosis in left middle cerebral artery (MCA), bilateral anterior cerebral artery (ACA), and left posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The patient subsequently underwent catheter angiography, which confirmed the formation of moyamoya vessels, with Suzuki's angiographic staging of grade-3 on the left side. Although the patient had been on both anti-platelet and statin therapy at the time, a follow-up examination showed further exacerbation of left MCA stenosis, along with enhanced moyamoya vessel formation. On black-blood imaging using DANTE-SPACE, there were eccentric, evolving lesions in the left MCA. We next screened for potential genetic variants, using genomic DNA samples isolated from both the patient and her immediate family members. The results showed that the patient, along with her mother, sister, and brother, possessed the heterozygous variant of the RNF213 gene, including c.14429Gâ¯>â¯A (p.R4810K) and c.5180Câ¯>â¯T (p.T1727M). The patient's daughter did not have the variant. Collectively, we present a unique case of A-MMS with geneti"
