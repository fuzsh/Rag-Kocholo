        "text": "IN 1920, Charles Edouard Guillaume (Figi) received a Nobel prize in physics for work he had done in the late nineteenth century - the discovery of an iron - nickel alloy that does not expand upon heating. He named it Invar, short for 'invariable'. The discovery was immediately put to use for many kinds of precision instruments. To this day, this is the only Nobel prize awarded for a metallurgical contribution. The discovery was made at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures) in SÃ¨vres near Paris.\n\nGuillaume was born at Fleurier in the SwissJura. After graduating from the Technical University in Zurich he served briefly in the military before joining the Bureau in 1883. His tasks included finding better ways to increase the precision of standard measurements. He searched for inexpensive materials to make standards of length and mass. In use at that time was a platinum-iridium alloy which was very expensive but useful because it did not corrode and had a low coefficient of thermal expansion.\n\nIn his search he made a remarkable discovery in 1898, that nickel-iron containing about 30% nickel had a very low expansion coefficient (Fig 2), in..."
