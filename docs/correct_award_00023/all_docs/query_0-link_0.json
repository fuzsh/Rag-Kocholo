        "text": "Charles Edouard Guillaume\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1920\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), Sèvres, France\n\nPrize motivation: “in recognition of the service he has rendered to precision measurements in Physics by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys”\n\nPrize share: 1/1\n\nWork\n\nPrecise measurement plays an important role in science. To provide a basis for precise measurements, the metric system and a German legal meter were instituted to define lengths. However, different materials expand differently when temperatures change, which limits the ability to make very precise measurements. In 1896 Charles-Edouard Guillaume succeeded in finding an alloy of nickel and steel that registered almost no change in length and volume as a result of temperature changes. The invar nickel-steel alloy had a significant effect on scientific instruments and incandescent light bulbs."
