        "text": "Charles Edouard Guillaume was a physicist born in 1861 in Fleurier, Switzerland and died in 1835 in Sèvres, France. In 1920 he received the Nobel Prize in Physics. He advanced the science in particular in the field of alloys with very low dilatation. One of these alloys, invar, is used for the most sophisticated balance with thermal compensation called “Guillaume balance” in honor of the physicist."
