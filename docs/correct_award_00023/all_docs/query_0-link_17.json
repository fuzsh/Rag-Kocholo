To establish exact international standards it was necessary to send meter-length bars to agencies in every civilized nation, but due to the expansion and contraction of metals in heat or cold, the same meter-bars would be of different lengths in warmer nations than in cooler nations. In studying the way numerous metals expand and contract, Guillaume developed a new nickel-steel alloy in 1896, which was named invar for its invariability under extremes of heat or cold — its coefficient of expansion is 15 times lower than that of steel. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1920.\n\nIn 1922 he developed a second valuable alloy, called elinvar (for elasticity invariable), with even less thermoelasticity, and less affected by magnetism and oxidation. Invar and elinvar are still used in the design of watches, precision scientific instruments, and devices subject to great heat or cold, including toasters and freezers. Guillaume also studied the physics and chemistry of mercury thermometers, and corrected the precise measurement of the volume of the liter. He frequently used a shortened version of his name, Ch-Ed Guillaume, in authoring his many papers and books.\n\nFather: Édouard Guillaume (clockmaker)\n\nMother: Marianne Emilie Lebet.\n\nWife: Emilie Marie Anne Taufflieb (m. 1888, three children)\n\nHigh School: Neuchâtel Gymnasium, Neuchâtel, Switzerland (1878)\n\nUniversity: DSc Physics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (1882)\n\nNobel Prize for Physics 1920\n\nFrench Legion of Honor Grand Officer\n\nFrench Physical Society\n\nInternational Bureau of Weights and Measures Thermometry research (1883-1902)\n\nInternational Bureau of Weights and Measures Associate Director (1902-15)\n\nInternational Bureau of Weights and Measures Director (1915-36)\n\nRussian Academy of Sciences Foreign Member\n\nLunar Crater Guillaume (45.4° N, 173.4° W , 57 km. diameter)\n\nFrench Ancestry\n\nSwiss Ancestry\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nÉtudes Thermométriques (Studies on Thermometry) (1886, non-fiction)\n\nTraité de Thermométrie (Treatise on Thermometry) (1889, non-fiction)\n\nUnités et Étalons (Units and Standards) (1894, non-fiction)\n\nLes Rayons X (X-Rays) (1896, non-fiction)\n\nRecherches sur le Nickel et ses Alliages (Investigations on Nickel and its Alloys) (1898, non-fiction)\n\nLa Vie de la Matière (The Life of Matter) (1899, non-fiction)\n\nLa Convention du Mètre et le Bureau international des Poids et Mesures (Metrical Convention and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures) (1902, non-fiction)\n\nLes Applications des Aciers au Nickel (Applications of Nickel-Steels) (1904, non-fiction)\n\nDes États de la Matière (States of Matter) (1907, non-fiction)\n\nLes Récent Progrès du Système Métrique (Recent progress in the Metric System) (1907, non-fiction)\n\nInitiation à la Mécanique (Introduction to Mechanics) (1912, non-fiction)\n\nLa Crèation du Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (Creation of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures) (1927, non-fiction)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Charles Édouard Guillaume\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
