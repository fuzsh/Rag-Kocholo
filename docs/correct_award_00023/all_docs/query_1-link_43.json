        "text": "Scarce, early work about Röntgen’s recent discovery, the X-rays.\n\nThe volume is an early review of Röntgen’s discovery of the X-rays, written by Guillaume Charles Édouard. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1920 in recognition of the service he had rendered to precision measurements in physics by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys.\n\nWilhelm Conrad Röntgen (1845–1923) was a German physicist who produced and detected electromagnetic radiation in a wavelenght range in 1895, known as X-rays. This achievement earned him the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901.\n\n."
