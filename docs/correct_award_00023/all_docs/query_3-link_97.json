        "text": "Invar is the popular name given to a binary (two metal) alloy of iron with 36 wt% nickel. It is one a family of alloys of iron and nickel which have very low coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE). It is this low CTE which gives Invar its name—it refers to its ‘invariable’ length. One of the things common to all pure metals, and the majority of alloys, are their moderate values of CTE. The majority have a value of 10–30 × 10-6 K-1. This means that a one metre length of a typical metal, heated up by 100 K (which is 100°C or 180°F), will increase its length by 1–3 mm. The CTE can often be a problem in diverse applications due to the resulting stress build-up if a metal is constrained. Most famously with train track (rail roads) buckling in hot weather. It is also a challenge when precision of geometry is required in components used in measuring devices. It is this problem that Invar was developed to address. A Swiss physicist, Charles Édouard Guillaume, received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1920 for its discovery, which he had made more than twenty years earlier. The award of the Noble Prize acknowledged the unique science behind the low CTE of Invar as well as its commercial value for the improvement of scientific instruments.\n\nInvar is a solid solution like other alloys we have already met on our A–Z journey. It has a face-centered cubic crystal (fcc) structure like the aluminium, copper and gold we have already encountered. In effect the nickel ‘persuades’ the iron to adopt a different crystal structure—pure iron being fcc only at temperature greater than 910°C. It is informative to compare the CTE of Invar with the two metals from which it is made:\n\nCTE of Fe is 12 × 10-6 K-1 (this implies a 0.12% increase in length over 100°C)\n\nCTE of Ni is 13 × 10-6 K-1\n\nCTE of Invar is 1.2 × 10-6 K-1\n\n[these values are approximate values for the temperature range 0°C to 100°C.]\n\nThis shows that Invar has around a 90% lower CTE than nickel and iron. With a combination of small additions of cobalt and careful control of impurities it is possible to lower the CTE still further, or to make it slightly negative. The alloy known as Inovco, which is iron-based with 33 wt% nickel and 4–5 wt% cobalt has a CTE of 0.6 × 10-6 K-1."
