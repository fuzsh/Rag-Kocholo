Guillaume received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1920 for the discovery and development of a pair of alloys that had characteristics invariant with temperature: one had constant length near ambient temperature, the other had constant Young's modulus. A recent analysis expresses retrospective surprise at this award: the objective of this short paper is to justify the award retrospectively, in terms of the continuing and impressive consequences of Guillaume's discoveries.",

        "text": "The first Elinvar alloy, FeNiCr, which has invariant elastic modulus over a wide temperature range, was discovered almost 100 years ago by Guillaume. The physical origin of such an anomaly has been attributed to the magnetic phase transition taking place in the system. However, the recent discovery of non-magnetic Elinvar such as multi-functional Î²-type Ti alloys has imposed a new challenge to the existing theories. In this study we show that random field from stress-carrying defects could suppress the sharp first-order martensitic transformation into a continuous strain glass transition, leading to continued formation and confined growth of nano-domains of martensite in a broad temperature range. Accompanying such a unique transition, there is a gradual softening of the elastic modulus over a wide temperature range, which compensates the normal modulus hardening due to anharmonic atomic vibration, resulting in a low and temperature-independent elastic modulus. The abundance of austenite/martensite interfaces are found responsible for the low elastic modulus."
