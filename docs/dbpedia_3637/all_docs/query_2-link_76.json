Are you doing a study on the Kingdom Of Jerusalem, or are you claiming descent.?\n\nI was under the impression that the Kingdom Of Jerusalem became extinct at the end of the Thirteenth century>Please excuse my ignorance. Do you think you could do a dumbed down version of the point you're trying to make? I'm fascinated by the Crusades ,but have only really had a look at the history of the Second Crusades, and that was a few years ago. ..\n\nThe point of this thread is to list all the persons who might be considered the heirs of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nIf you use the search function here in Historum and search for \"Heirs of\" in titles you will find a bunch of threads that I have started about the heirs of various thrones. And you will note that because of various political and military events there are about a dozen different lines of heirs leading to about a dozen different present day persons for each kingdom listed.\n\nAs for purpose, I guess you could read \"The Exiles Club\" by Lord Dunsany online, here Tales of Wonder: The Exiles Club for example. I guess one purpose of these threads is to create a similar club, or at least identify who would be the waiters.\n\nProblems with the Brienne Claim to Jerusalem.\n\nPost # 1 and post # 2 give the Brienne claim to the kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nAn important ancestor who transmitted the Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem to her heirs was Anne of Laval (1505-1554) who married Francoise de la Tremoille (1504/05-1541) viscount of Thouars, Prince of Talmond. Family tree of Anne de Laval - MAINE - NOBILITY\n\nBut Anne of Laval had a sister Catherine who married. Medieval Lands only says that Catherine died in 1526 and Anne died in 1554 but the data on Anne of Laval in Geneanet says that Catharine was born in 1504 and Anne was born in 1505. If that is correct it would make the descendants of Catherine of Laval the rightful heirs until and unless they died out.\n\na. Catherine of Laval, the possibly older sister, married Claude de Rieux, Count of Harcourt (1497-1532. MAINE - NOBILITY Mother of:\n\nb. Renee de Rieux, Countess of Laval & Harcourt (1524-1567) married Louis de Sainte-Maure, Maquis of Nesle. No Children. Family tree of Guyonne XVIII Sister of:\n\nc.

Guy XX of Coligny, Count of Laval (1585-1605) No Children. And he may have been the last surviving descendant of Catherine of Laval, whic would make Henry de La Tremoille, (1598-1674) Third Duke of Thouars the heir to the Brienne claim to Jerusalem in 1672 when John II Casimir Vasa (1609-1672), King of Poland, died.\n\nThen a few generations earlier Isabella of Cleremont (c. 1424-1465) who married King Ferdinand/Ferrrente of Naples was the heiress of the Brienne claim to Jerusalem. Or was she? She had two sisters who married, and after their brother Raymond de Clermont died childless in 1434/35 whichever sister was the oldest would be the heir. Genealogics states tahat Sanchia was the older sister, born about 1416, while Isabella was born about 1424, but I don't know how accurate that is. Tristan di Chiaramonte, Conte di Copertino : Genealogics\n\na. Sancie de Clermont possibly the older sister, married Francesco de Balzo Duke of Adnria (1410-1482) TOULOUSE NOBILITY Mother of:\n\nb.

Doña Victoria de Medina y Conradi, 10.Duquesa de Santisteban del Puerto : Genealogics She might possibly be the rightful heir of Sancie de Clermont who might possibly have been the older sister of Isabella de Clermont and the heiress of the Brienne claim to Jerusalem.\n\nAnd there are other problems with the Brienne claim to Jerusalem.\n\nWhy is \"rudolphe\" not capitalized in the last name on your list? Is that merely a typo?\n\nAlso, it's interesting that the House of La Tremoille inherited this claim and also that the last male agnate of this House died in 1933.\n\nWhy is \"rudolphe\" not capitalized in the last name on your list? Is that merely a typo?\n\nAlso, it's interesting that the House of La Tremoille inherited this claim and also that the last male agnate of this House died in 1933.\n\nYes \"rudolphe\" is a typo, one of many. If it was the only typo I failed to notice and correct in time I was doing well on that post.\n\nOf course the extinction of the male line of the Tremoille's isn't very important since their claim to Jerusalem came to them though nine females if I count correctly, so there is plenty of precedent for the de la Tremoille claim to pass to Charles-Antoine Lamoral de Ligne de La Tremoille (b. 1946), the current heir, through his grandmother.\n\nIs it true that \"the House of La Tremoille inherited this claim\"? Post # 5 traces the heirs of Sancie of Cleremont, the allegedly older sister of number 29 Isabella of Cleremont, down to Dona Victoria de Medina y Conradi (b. 4 October 1986) 10th Duchess of Santisteban del Puerto. And there are other problems with this claim that will be discussed in later posts.\n\nBut Charles-Antoine Lamoral de Ligne de La Tremoille (b. 1946) shouldn't be too sad about that, since the de la Tremoille Dukes of Thours were also the heirs of the Savoy claim to the Kingdoms of Jerusalem, Cyprus, and (Lesser) Armenia and were also claimants to be the heirs of the Aragonese kings of Naples from 1458 to 1501, who also used the title of King of Jerusalem.\n\nIn my tree, I have Louis d'Acre de Brienne, Viscount de Beaumont, born 1223 in Acre, Levant to 1297 in Maine, France. He had a daughter Jeanne de Brienne de Beaumont, born 1263 in Beaumont, Maine, France to 1310 either in Bedfordshire or France. But I haven't paid attention to this twig for quite a while. She married as her second husband Norville Norton Sr., born in Sharpenhoe, Bedfordshire. This began a long Norton line in England.\n\nYou have to remember that noble families tend to branch out and have several cousins of the same family alive at any one time. Many of the families famous in the history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem like Lusignan, Montferrat, Ibelin, etc., had different branches active in the east who were not all descended from each other from father to son.\n\nIn the case of the Brienne family you will note that John of Brienne (1170/75-1237) married Maria of Jerusalem (1192-1212) and their daughter Isabelle/Yolanda Queen of Jerusalem (1211-1228) married Emperor Frederick II (1294-1250). And you will note that the first Brienne claimant to Jerusalem, Hugues of Brienne (d.1296) was the son of of Walter IV (1205-1244/47), Count of Brienne, Count of Jaffa, son of Walter III of Brienne (d. 1205), son of Erard II of Brienne (d. 1190/91), son of Walter III of Brienne (d. before 1161) who could not possibly be the son of John of Brienne (1170/75-1237) King of Jerusalem.\n\nYour Louis of Brienne (1223-1297) was the son of John of Brienne (1170/75-1237) King of Jerusalem, Latin Emperor of constantinople, and his third wife Infanta Berenguela of Castile & Leon. John of Brienne (1170/75-1237) was a younger son of Erard II of Brienne (d. 1190/91. CHAMPAGNE - BRIENNE\n\nDo you think they'll get it back? I tend to think not\n\nSee post number 4 above.\n\nIn post numbers 1 & 2 of this thread I traced the heirs of the Kingdom of Jerusalem down to Charles-Antoine Lamoral de Ligne de La Tremoille (b. 1946), who is considered the heir to the Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nAnd in post # 5 I pointed out a problem with that line of heirs, since number 29, Isabella of Cleremont (c. 1424-1465) wife of King Ferdinand/Ferrente of Naples, had a possibly older sister, Sancie of Clermont, whose heirs were traced down to the present.\n\nThe claim of Sancie and Isabella of Clemont to Jerusalem was through their mother Catarina Orsini de Balzo (Baux) (died before 1431), daughter of Raymond Orsini de Balzo (1361?-1406) Prince of Taranto and his wife Marie of Enghien Countess of Lecce (1367-1446).\n\nRaymond Orsini de Balso (1361?-1406) Prince of Taranto and his wife Marie of Enghien Countess of Lecce (1367-1446) had two sons including # 28 in post number one above, \"Giantonio of Balzo (1386-1463) Prince of Taranto. Childless.\" The genealogics site states he did have children, but they were illegitimate. But he did have a brother, Gabriel Orsini de Balzo, 1st Duke of Venosa. Since the descendants of brothers have superior claims than those of sisters, the line of heirs would be:\n\n28. Giantonio Orsini de Balzo (1386-1463) Prince of Taranto. No legitimate children. Giovannantonio Orsini, Principe di Taranto : Genealogics Brother of:\n\na. Gabriel Orsini de Balzo, 1st Duke of Venosa, (d. 1543, Constantinople, in battle).

He seems to have been the last descendnat of # 36. Donna Isabella Gonzaga (1565-1637) Duchess of Traetto, and her father # 35, and his father b, Lodovico Rodomonte Gonzaga, Lord of Sabioneta. So the succession should then be the same as in post # 5 down to:\n\n49. Dona Victoria de Medina y Conradi (b. 4 October 1986) 10th Duchess of Santisteban del Puerto. Doña Victoria de Medina y Conradi, 10.Duquesa de Santisteban del Puerto : Genealogics As post number 5 says, she might possibly be the rightful heir of Sancie de Clermont who might possibly have been the older sister of Isabella de Clermont and the heiress of the Brienne claim to Jerusalem. And as this post shows she seems to be the heir by male preference primogeniture of Raymond Orsini de Balso (1361?-1406) Prince of Taranto and his wife Marie of Enghien Countess of Lecce (1367-1446), the grandparents of Sancie and Isabelle de Clermont. So Dona Victoria de Medina y Conradi (b. 4 October 1986) 10th Duchess of Santisteban del Puerto seems to be the heir of Marie of Enghien's claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nHeirs of the Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem Again.\n\nIn post numbers 1 & 2 of this thread I traced the heirs of the Kingdom of Jerusalem down to Charles-Antoine Lamoral de Ligne de La Tremoille (b. 1946), who is considered the heir to the Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nAnd in post # 5 I pointed out a problem with that line of heirs, since number 29, Isabella of Cleremont (c. 1424-1465) wife of King Ferdinand/Ferrente of Naples, had a possibly older sister, Sancie of Clermont, whose heirs were traced down to the present.\n\nAnd post number 11 in this thread traced the heirs by male preference primogeniture of Raymond Orsini de Balso (1361?-1406) Prince of Taranto and his wife Marie of Enghien Countess of Lecce (1367-1446), the grandparents of Sancie and Isabelle de Clermont, down to the present.\n\nBut there is a problem with that descent. Gabriel Orsini de Balzo, 1st Duke of Venosa, (d. 1543, Constantinople, in battle) is listed as having three daughters. Maria Donata Orsini de Balzo, seems to be the oldest daughter, since she became the decond Duchess of Venosa. But since she is the only daughter whose birth year is given, it is possible that one of her sisters was the oldest sister. Her sister Raimondina Orsini was married. So the heirs of Raimondina Orsini should be traced.\n\n28. Giantonio Orsini de Balzo (1386-1463) Prince of Taranto. No legitimate children. Giovannantonio Orsini, Principe di Taranto : Genealogics Brother of:\n\na. Gabriel Orsini de Balzo, 1st Duke of Venosa, (d. 1543, Constantinople, in battle). Gabriele Orsini del Balzo, 1.Duca di Venosa : Genealogics Died before his brother. Father of:\n\n29. Raimondina Orisini, possibly the oldest daughter, married Roberto Sanserverino 1st Prince of Salerno,11th Count of Marsico (d. 1474). Raimondina Orsini del Balzo: Genealogics Mother of:\n\n30. Antonello Sanseverino, 2nd Prince of Salerno (1458-1499). Antonello Sanseverino, 2.Principe di Salerno : Genealogics Father of:\n\n31.

Ferdinando Sanserverino, 4th Prince of Salerno (1507-1572) Ferdinando Sanseverino, 4.Principe di Salerno : Genealogics No children listed. Ferdinando Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno - Wikipedia\n\nSo the descendants of Raimondina Orsini seem to have ended in 1572. And her sister Girolama Orsini has no descendants listed. Descendancy for Girolama Orsini, Nobile Romana : Genealogics - CENTRAL ITALY. This makes Dona Victoria de Medina y Conradi (b. 4 October 1986) 10th Duchess of Santisteban del Puerto the heiress by male Preference Primogenture of Raymond Orsini de Balso (1361?-1406) Prince of Taranto and his wife Marie of Enghien Countess of Lecce (1367-1446), and thus makes her instead of Charles-Antoine Lamoral de Ligne de La Tremoille (b. 1946) the heir by male preference primogeniture of the Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

But that claim only goes back to King Baldwin II of Jerusalem, who was a unspecified relative of Godfrey of Boullon and his brother King Baldwin I of Jerusalem. With the relationship unspecified, there is no way to know how close it was, but it seems very probable that Baldwin II was not as closely related to Godfrey of Boullon and his brother King Baldwin I of Jerusalem as their closest known relatives were. And so Baldwin II must have been selected as the heir to Jerusalem because he was conveniently there in Outremer instead of thousands of miles away in Europe and/or for other political reasons.\n\nSo here is the line of heirs from the closest known relatives of the first two Frankish rulers of Jerusalem.\n\nCount Eustache II of Boulogne (c. 1015/20-1087) Married Godgifu of England (d. before 1049), daughter of Aethelred II, and had three sons.
