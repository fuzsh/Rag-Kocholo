        "text": "A rather entertaining article about a fight between the Duke of San Clemente and the singer Sting.\n\nSting has bought a wine property in the nineties from the dukes father, Duke Simone Vincenzo Velluti Zati di San Clemente.\n\nSting claims in the Corriere della Sera that the duke gave him wine to taste that was not from his property, while pretending that it was. The singer claims that thus he was tricked into buying the wine property.\n\nThe late dukes son took offense and defended the late duke in the same newspaper, calling the story “false, poisonous slander”.\n\nAnd:\n\n“Apart from the fact that an internationally experienced gentleman like Sting (he was 46 years old at the time) should not confuse Barolo with Chianti, Nebbiolo with Sangiovese, nothing could be more alien to my father’s character, habits, behavior, in one word, to his spirit, than to behave like a swindling innkeeper.”\n\nHe went on, “My father lived until 2012, so Sting had time to allow him to personally retort to his suspicions, but the statement was not only in bad faith, but also so absurd as to sound like a boomerang. Instead, Sting decided to do it ‘a babbo morto‘ as they say in Tuscany, when the father has died.”\n\nNot holding back, he went on to blast Sting’s renovation of the property, which includes installing a large pool, gym and yoga studio: “Today the comparison between the Palagio of the past and the one today re-fashioned by Sting today is deplorable. The Palagio is now a Palm Beach-style resort.”\n\nFriends of the duke also praised the man and attacked the singer for making up a story. And they also compare the re-vamped estate to a Palm Beach resort -the ultimate insult it seems- rather than a Tuscan Fattoria.\n\nRead the entire story here.\n\nInteresting article about Orsini family and other noble families around Europe, such as Anhalt, Orsini-Rosenberg, Rosenberg from Bohemia, Ursini von Blagay, Dukes of Holstein etc. that tried to claim kinship to them:\n\nhttps://www.oeaw.ac.at/fileadmin/Institute/INZ/img/menschen/Mata/The_false_Orsini.pdf\n\nI just started reading and I’m somewhat shocked. When did the Hohenzollerns ever claim to descend from the Colonnas? I’ve only ever heard of the Stolberg claims, but the Hohenzollerns, never heard of any claiming to descend from the Colonnas. I have also heard of the Orsini und Rosenbergs claiming to be descendants of the Orsini family, but that’s of course not true."
