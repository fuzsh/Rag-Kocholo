Maria Princess of Cisterna\n\nEmanuele Filiberto 2nd Duke of Aosta+\n\nVittorio Emanuele Prince of Savoy, Count of Turin\n\nLuigi Prince of Savoy, Duke of Abruzzi\n\nAmedeo I King of Spain 1702\n\nBorn: 30 May 1845, Torino, Piemonte, Italy 1709\n\nMarriage (1): Marie Bonaparte-Moncalieri Princess on 11 Sep 1888 1708\n\nMarriage (2): Maria Princess of Cisterna on 30 May 1867 in Torino, Piemonte, Italy 1709\n\nDied: 18 Jan 1890, Torino, Piemonte, Italy at age 44 1709\n\nAnother name for Amedeo was Amadeo Fernando Maria.1708\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nAmadeo I (sometimes Latinized as Amadeus) (May 30, 1845 - January 18, 1890), 1st Duke of Aosta and King of Spain, was born in Turin, Italy. He was the second son of Victor Emmanuel II (King of Piedmont, Savoy, Sardinia and, later, first King of Italy) and Mary Adelaide of Austria.\n\nIn 1867, he married Maria Victoria al Pozzo della Cisterna (b. August 1847, d. November 1876) and they had three children, Emanuele Filiberto, 2nd Duke of Aosta, Vittorio Emanuele, Count of Turin, and Luigi, Duke of Abruzzi. One year later, after the Spanish revolution deposed Isabella II, the new Cortes decided to reinstate a monarchy. Amadeus I was elected King on November 16, 1870. He swore to uphold the constitution in Madrid on January 2, 1871.\n\nThe election of the new King coincided with the assassination of General Juan Prim, his main backer. After that, Amadeo had to deal with difficult situations, with unstable Spanish politics, republican conspiracies, Carlist uprisings, separatism in Cuba, same-party disputes, fugitive governments and assassination attempts.\n\nHe could only count on the support of the progressive party, whose leaders were trading off in the government thanks to parliamentary majority and electoral fraud. The progressives divided into monarchists and constitutionalists, which made the instability worse, and in 1872 a violent outburst of interparty conflicts hit a peak. There was a Carlist uprising in the Basque and Catalan regions, and after that, republican uprisings happened in various cities dispersed across the country. The artillery corps of the army went on strike, and the government instructed the King to discipline them.\n\nWith the possibility of reigning with no popular support, Amadeus issued an order against the artillery corps and then immediately abdicated from the Spanish throne on February 11, 1873. At ten o'clock that same night, Spain was proclaimed a republic, at which time Amadeo made an appearance before the Cortes, proclaiming the Spanish people ungovernable.\n\nCompletely disgusted, the ex-monarch left Spain to go back to Italy, where he took over the title of Duke of Aosta.\n\nHe married French Princess Marie Laetitia Napoleon (20 November 1866 - 25 October 1926), after the death of his first wife. They had one child, Umberto.\n\nAmadeo remained in Turin, Italy until he died on 18 January 1890.\n\nThe first Spanish Republic lasted less than one year, and in 1875 Alfonso XII, the son of Isabella II, was proclaimed king, with Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, Spanish prime minister from 1873 until his assassination in 1893, briefly regent.\n\nSeventy years later, in 1941, Amadeo's grandson, Aimone, 4th Duke of Aosta was proclaimed king of the Independent State of Croatia as Tomislav II. He never actually reigned and only lasted 29 months before abdicating. 1702\n\nLife Events:\n\n1.
