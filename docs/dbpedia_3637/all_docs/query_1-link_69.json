        "text": "So who should be the monarch of Navarre, a kingdom that usually corresponded roughly to the lands of the Basque people, assuming that Navarre hypothetically becomes a kingdom again and that the monarch of Navarre should be a different person than the monarchs or pretenders (claimants) to the thrones of France and Spain?\n\nLouis XVI was king of France and Navarre from 10 May 1774 to 4 September 1991, when his title was changed to King of the French during the French Revolution. The French revolutionary government annexed Navarre to France, which is a strong reason why a hypothetical future Kingdom of Navarre wouldn't want their monarch to be the same person as the monarch or pretender of France or Spain.\n\nLouis XVI was dethroned on 21 September 1792, and guillotined 21 January 1793.\n\nThe Royalists in exile proclaimed his (second but oldest surviving) son King Louis XVII, but he died in prison 8 June 1795. Louis XVI's daughter Marie Therese Charlotte (19 December 1778-19 October 1851) who became the rightful queen of Navarre but not France on 8 June 1795. Marie Therese Charlotte married her first cousin Louis Antoine (1775-1844) the eldest son of King Charles X of France and Navarre, but didn't have any children.\n\nThe next heirs were the descendants of the siblings of Luis XVI. All of the children of his father, the Dauphin Louis (1729-1765), either died as children or married but were childless, except that Louis XVI had four children who died childless and King Charles X (1757-1836) had four children.\n\nKing Charles X (1757-1836) had two sons who married and two daughters who died young. Louis Antoine (1775-1844) was childless, but Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry (1778-1820) had a posthumous son, Henry, Duke of Bordeaux and Count of Chambord (1820-1883).\n\nWhen the Count of Chambord died childless, the claim to the throne of France passed to his closest male relative of legitimate birth, King Alfonso XII of Spain, whose ancestors had renounced their claim to France however, or to Prince Phillipe, Count of Paris, of the Orleans branch of the family. Today the pretenders to the French throne are their descendants, Louis, Duke of Anjou, and Henri, Count of Paris.\n\nThe French throne passes by male only, or agnatic, primogeniture. But the Bourbons inherited the throne of Navarre through male preference primogeniture which allows inheritance by and through females. The Count of Chambord had a married sister.\n\nThus the succession would be:\n\n1) Louis XVI, King Louis V of Navarre.\n\n2) Louis XVII (1785-1795), son, King Louis VI of Navarre. Childless.\n\n3) Marie Therese Charlotte (1778-1851) sister, married but childless.\n\n4) Henry Count of Chambord (1820-1883), first cousin, childless. Claimant of the throne of France.\n\n[Louise Marie Therese d'Artois (1819-1864), sister. Married Duke Charles III of Parma]\n\n5) Robert I (1848-1907) Duke of Parma 1854-1859, son, nephew of number 4.\n\n6) Henry (1873-1939), oldest son, pretender to the throne of Parma, childless.\n\n7) Joseph (1875-1950), brother, pretender to the throne of Parma, childless.\n\n8) Elias (1880-1959), brother, pretender to the throne of Parma.\n\n9) Robert Hugo (1909-1974), only surviving son, childless. After his death the claim to the throne of Parma passed to his uncle Xavier (1889-1977), but the claim to Navarre passed to his sisters.\n\n10) Princess Elizabeth (1904-1983), oldest sister. Unmarried.\n\n11) Princess Maria Francesca (1906-1994), oldest surviving sister. Unmarried.\n\n12) Princess Alicia (30 November 1917-3 February 2017), oldest surviving sister. Married Alfonso, Duke of Calabria (1901-1964).\n\n[Carlos, Duke of Calabria (1938-2015), son. Claimant of the Two Sicilies.]\n\n13) Pedro, Duke of Calbria (born 1968), son, grandson of number 12. claimant of the Two Sicilies. One of the co-heirs of King John Balliol, and thus of the early kings of Scotland and the Anglo-Saxon kings of England.\n\nAs said above, Dauphin Louis of France (1729-1765) had 13 children, but only two, Louis XVI and Charles X, had children.\n\nDauphin Louis's father, King Louis XV of France (1710-1774), had ten children, but only Dauphin Louis and his oldest sister Louise Elizabeth (1727-1759) had children. Perhaps some persons might want to consider her descendants alternate claimants to the throne of Navarre.\n\n1) Louise Elizabeth (1727-1759) married Philip Duke of Parma.\n\n2) Ferdinand (1751-1802), son, Duke of Parma 1765-1801.\n\n3) Louis I (1773-1803), King of Etruria 1801-1803, Son.\n\n4) Charles Louis (1799-1803), son. King Louis II of Etruria 1803-1807, Duke Charles I of Lucca 1824-1847, Duke Charles II of Parma 1847-1849.\n\n5) Charles III (1823-1854), son, Duke of Parma 1849-1854. Married Louise Marie Therese d'Artois (1819-1864).\n\n6) Duke Robert I (1848-1907), son Duke of Parma 1854-1859. number 5 in the previous list.\n\n7) Henry (1873-1939), oldest son, pretender to the throne of Parma, childless.\n\n8) Joseph (1875-1950), brother, pretender to the throne of Parma, childless.\n\n9) Elias (1880-1959), brother, pretender to the throne of Parma.\n\n10) Robert Hugo (1909-1974), only surviving son, childless. After his death the claim to the throne of Parma passed to his uncle Xavier (1889-1977), but the claim to Navarre passed to his sisters.\n\n11) Princess Elizabeth (1904-1983), oldest sister. Unmarried.\n\n12) Princess Maria Francesca (1906-1994), oldest surviving sister. Unmarried.\n\n13) Princess Alicia (30 November 1917-3 February 2017), oldest surviving sister. Married Alfonso, Duke of Calabria (1901-1964).\n\n[Carlos, Duke of Calabria (1938-2015), son. Claimant of the Two Sicilies.]\n\n14) Pedro, Duke of Calbria (born 1968), son, grandson of number 12. claimant of the Two Sicilies. One of the co-heirs of King John Balliol, and thus of the early kings of Scotland and the Anglo-Saxon kings of England.\n\nLouis XV's father, Louis Duke of burgundy and Dauphin (1682-1712) had three children and only Louis XV had children.\n\nLouis the Duke of Burgundy's father, Louis Dauphin of France (1661-1711) had three children and two of his sons had children. The genealogical heir of the younger son, King Philip V of Spain, is louis, Duke of Anjou, legitiimist pretender to the throne of France.\n\nThe father of Louis Dauphin of France (1661-1711), King Louis XIV (1638-1715), had only one legitimate child who had children, Louis Dauphin of France.\n\nThe father of King Louis XIV (1638-1715), King Louis XIII (1601-1643), had only two legitimate children, both sons, who had children. Although I have said that the French revolution merged Navarre into France, some sources say that King Louis XIII's government merged Navarre into France in 1620, thus making Navarre a merely titular kingdom from then on. Thus some people might claim that no descendant of Louis XIII could be the rightful king of Navarre. The heir general of the younger son Philippe I, Duke of Orleans (1640-1701), is Duke Franz of Bavaria, the Jacobite pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland, Ireland, and France.\n\nThe father of King Louis XIII (1601-1643) was Henry of Bourbon (1553-1610), King Henry III of Navarre from 1572 to 1610, and King Henry IV of France from 1589 to 1610. Henry had two sons.\n\nThe younger son, Gaston Duke of Orleans (1608-1660) had daughters who married but their descendants died out in a few generations.\n\nGaston's eldest daughter Anne Marie Louise d'Orleans (1627-1693), Duchess of Montpensier, never married.\n\nThe next daughter, Margaret Louise (1645-1721) married Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Her three children married but had no children. Her daughter Anna Marria Louisa (1667-1743) was the last descendant of Gaston of Orleans.\n\nThe Next daughter, Elisabeth Marguerite (1646-1696) married the Duke of Guise and had a son who died in 1675 age 5.\n\nThe next daughter, Francois Madeline (1648-1664) married but died childless.\n\nOther possible claimants of Navarre will be considered in another post.\n\nYour post is only looking at modern history. The kingdom of Navarra (Pamplona) had it's hey day under Sancho III El Mayor just after the milennium. At the time Navarra was the most powerful of the Christian states, not that such a thing was much to write home about in 1004. Also holding sway over Gascony.\n\nSancho's heirs heave the rights surely? Good look with HIS family tree!\n\nWell, I'll work on something a little easier before going back that far.\n\nQueen Joan I (1273-1305) of Navarre married King Philip IV (1268-1314) of France. By 1314 the leading members of the younger generation of the French-Navarrese royal family included Philip's three sons, Louis (1289-1316), Philip (1292/93-1322), and Charles (1294-1328), and their first cousin Philip of Valois (1293-1350), Philip IV's nephew. Those four young men were married to two pairs of sisters.\n\nLouis's wife was Margaret (1290-1315), daughter of Duke Robert II of Burgundy, Philip's wife was Joan (1292/98-1330), Countess of Burgundy, Charles's wife was Blanche (1296/97-1325/26), sister of Countess Joan of burgundy, and Philip of Valois's wife was Joan (1293-1348), daughter of Robert of Burgundy and sister of Margaret.\n\nIn the Tour de Nesle affair of 1314, Queen Isabel, sister of Louis, Philip, and Charles, and wife of King Edward II of England, accused Margaret, Blanche, and maybe Joan of adultery. Margaret and Blanche were sentenced to life imprisonment, and Margaret was probably murdered so Louis could marry again. Joan was eventually found innocent, but doubts lingered about the legitimacy of her children also.\n\nKing Louis X died in 1316, his posthumous son John I lived only 5 days, Philip became King Philip V but died having only daughters in 1322, Charles became King Charles IV and died having only daughters in 1328, and Philip of Valois became King Philip VI of France in 1328.\n\nThose successions established the precedent that the French throne could pass only through males and only to males. The throne of Navarre could pass to and through females, so Joan (1312-1349), daughter of Louis X and Margaret, became Queen Joan II of Navarre, despite the doubts about her paternity and thus descent from previous rulers of Navarre.\n\nSo at this time there were five families that could make claims to the thrones of France and/or Navarre.\n\n1) Joan II (1312-1349), eventual Queen of Navarre, daughter of King Louis X of France and Navarre (died 1316), claim by seniority in male preference primogeniture but marred by suspicions she was the child of adultery.\n\n2) Joan of France (1308-1349), Countess of Burgundy and Artois in her own right, wife of Duke Odo IV of Burgundy, and her children and her sisters and their children, daughters of King Philip V. Their claim to Navarre was as the senior heirs by male preference primogeniture who were not suspected of illegitimacy as much as Joan II since their mother Joan of Burgundy had been acquitted of adultery but marred by still being suspected since their mother had been accused of adultery. Their father Philip V claimed on 2 February 1317 that women (and .....) could not inherit the throne of France. His only son Philip promptly died on 24 February 1317. Joan of France and her sisters and their descendants were thus disinherited in the eyes of those who accepted their father's claim of male only succession.\n\n3) Jeanne (May 1326 – January 1327), Marie (1327 – 6 October 1341) and Blanche (1 April 1328 – 8 February 1382), daughters of King Charles IV of France and Navarre by his third wife Jeanne d'Evreux. Their claim to Navarre would be that although their older half siblings (who died before their father anyway) had been suspected of being illegitimate, they were the senior line by male preference primogeniture that was not suspected of being illegitimate. Blanche married the Duke of Orleans but had no children.\n\n4) Isabella (1295-1358) daughter of King Philip IV, sister of Kings Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV, Queen of England, and her older son King Edward III of England (1312-1377). After the death of John I in 1316, only her brothers Philip V (died 1322) and Charles IV (died 1328) stood ahead of her as heirs of unchallenged legitimacy and paternity to Navarre until Charles IV finally had children of unchallenged legitimacy and patrnity in 1326. Isabella could still have claimed the throne of Navarre for her son Edward III on the grounds that the kingship could be inherited through a female of unchallenged legitimacy but not by a female, a claim valid until any of the daughters of Charles IV had sons.\n\nOf course if doubts about the legitimacy and paternity of the daughters of Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV were not considered sufficient to disbar them from the throne of Navarre, there would have been more lives between Isabella and the throne of Navarre.\n\nAnd there was a fifth family with claims to the throne of France, but not to the throne of Navarre.\n\nPhilip VI (1293-1350), son of Count Charles \"of the Hat\" of Valois (1270-1325). Charles got his nickname because of his unsuccessful attempts to gain crowns. Philip may have inherited that desire for kingdoms.\n\nThe heirs of family # 1:\n\n1) Joan II (1312-1349) and King Philip III (1306-1343) Count of Evreux, her husband.\n\n2) Charles II (1332-1387) the Bad.

Since Philip VI gained the throne of France through male only, or agnatic, primogeniture, the list of his heirs was basically the following kings of France until the end of the monarchy.\n\nAt the present time the pretenders (claimants) to the French throne are Louis, Duke of Anjou (legitimist), and Henry, Count of Paris (Orleanist).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_pretenders#Europe\n\nAnd just for fun I will note that Philip VI's heir general is Prince Charles-Antoine Lamoral of Ligne-La Tremoille (born 1946). See post # 19 here:\n\nhttp://historum.com/newreply.php?do=newreply&p=2610031\n\nNext I will search for possible alternate successions between Joan II of Navarre and King Louis XIV of France."
