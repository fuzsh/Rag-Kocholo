        "text": "Marie Feodorovna, Dowager Empress of Russia, photographed in Copenhagen in 1924 (Wikimedia Commons)\n\n“Europe Harbors Hapless Queens”\n\n(originally appeared in the Louisville Courier-Journal, 3 Oct 1927)\n\nVienna, Oct. 2 — Dispersed over Europe like the scattered jewels of their shattered crowns, five throne-less queens are living on the slender charity of relatives and friends.\n\nOnce the proud owners of millions of acres of land, the rulers of greater millions of people, and the possessors of untold millions of wealth, Dowager Empress Marie of Russia, Empress Zita of Austria, Queen Sophie of Greece, Queen Amelie of Portugal, and young Queen Elizabeth of Greece are today without a roof or a bed they can call their own. Their return to their own homes would be sufficient to start an immediate revolution.\n\nIvan Kramskoi’s 1882 portrait of Empress Marie Feodorovna of Russia (Grand Ladies Site)\n\nSaddest and loneliest of all five fugitive queens is Empress Dowager Marie of Russia [1], mother of the murdered Czar Nicholas, who, broken in body and mind over the successive tragedies she has borne, beginning with the assassination of her father-in-law, Emperor Alexander II, and culminating in the brutal murder of her son and his entire family, is spending the remnant of her tragic life in Copenhagen. She recently was reported to be dying.\n\nWhile the rest of the world has given up her son and family as irrefutably dead, the venerable empress insists they are still alive. At her window in Copenhagen she still burns a small lamp so that, as she says, “Nicky will know I’m still awaiting his return.”\n\nGeorgios Iakovidis’s 1915 portrait of Queen Sophie of Greece(Grand Ladies Site)\n\nAnother woman sovereign whose cup of sorrow has overflowed is former Queen Sophie of Greece [2], who in her time witnessed the assassination of her father-in-law, King George I of Greece; the death by a monkey bite of her eldest son, former King Alexander of Greece; the overthrow, humiliation, and exile of her brother, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany; the double expulsion and exile of her husband, the late King Constantine of Greece; the dethronement of her second son, George, as King of the Hellenes; and more recently, the death of her brother-in-law, King Ferdinand of Romania [3].\n\nCrushed by the adversity and anguish that the world visits even on queens, Sophie now goes despondently about Europe, laying her head wherever she is offered a friendly pillow by relatives or friends. She spends much of her time in prayer and meditation in Florence, Italy, where her beloved “Tino” is buried.\n\nOccasionally, she goes unobserved to Doorn, Holland, to commiserate with her brother Wilhelm. On other occasions she slips down to Bucharest to break bread with her throneless son George, and his consort, former Queen Elizabeth. Most of these trips are financed by relatives or by American dollars acquired by Sophie’s brother-in-law, Prince Christopher [4], on the death of his wife, Mrs. William Leeds of Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nTheodor Mayerhöfer’s 1917 portrait of Empress Zita of Austria (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nFar removed from the scene of her former power and glory, and supported by contributions from her adherents in Hungary, Empress Zita of Austria [5] is living in exile with her eight children in the village of Lequieto, Spain, in a house donated by the King of Spain [6], who is related to the Habsburgs. Undaunted by reports that there is little chance of Hungary returning to a monarchy, Zita personally is tutoring and training her eldest son, Otto, for the duties and responsibilities of a king.\n\nZita, too, has tasted tragedy. After two dramatic and unsuccessful attempts to regain the Hungarian throne, her husband, Emperor Karl, was deported to Madeira, where he died of physical exhaustion and a broken heart. Widowed and penniless, Zita lived a beggarly existence until the King of Spain came to her rescue.\n\nVittorio Matteo Corcos’s 1905 portrait of Queen Amelie of Portugal (Grand Ladies Site)\n\nAnother crownless, countryless queen living the life of a refugee is Queen Amelie of Portugal [7], who witnessed the assassination of her husband, King Carlos, in 1908, and who two years later was forced to flee for her own life with her son, King Manuel, on the eventful day Portugal was proclaimed a republic. Queen Amelie is now living quietly at Versailles, supported largely by family relatives and friends.\n\nPostcard portrait of Queen Elisabeth of Greece, ca. 1920s\n\nYoungest and least experienced of all former occupants of queenly thrones is the once Queen Elizabeth of Greece [8], daughter of Queen Marie of Romania, who, with her consort, George, forfeited the crown of Greece when that troubled country became a republic three years ago.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. Empress Marie Feodorovna of Russia (1847-1928), born Princess Dagmar of Denmark, married the future Emperor Alexander III of Russia in 1866. She had previously been engaged to Alexander’s elder brother, Nicholas, but after Nicholas’s sudden death in 1865, she accepted Alexander’s offer of marriage. They reigned as emperor and empress of Russia from 1881 until his death in 1894; their son, also named Nicholas, succeeded his father. Marie Feodorovna survived the bloodbath that claimed her son, daughter-in-law, grandchildren, and so many other Romanovs during the 1917 revolution, and she lived out the rest of her life in her native Denmark. She died a year after this article was published, in October 1928.\n\n2. Queen Sophie of the Hellenes (1870-1932), born Princess Sophie of Prussia. She was the daughter of Emperor Friedrich III of Germany and Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom; Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany was her brother. Sophie married her third cousin, Crown Prince Constantine of Greece, in 1889. They had six children, including three Greek kings (George II, Alexander, and Paul). Her husband served two stints as King of the Hellenes, but in 1923, following his second exile from the country, he died in Italy. Sophie lived another decade, dying in her native Germany in January 1932.\n\n3. King Ferdinand of Romania (1865-1927), born Prince Ferdinand of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, reigned as Romania’s king from 1914 until his death in the summer of 1927. He and Queen Sophie were not siblings-in-law, as this article suggests, but they were connected by two recent family marriages. Sophie’s son, King George II of the Hellenes, married Ferdinand’s daughter, Princess Elisabeth of Romania, in 1921. The same year, Ferdinand’s son, Crown Prince Carol of Romania, married Sophie’s daughter, Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark. Both marriages ended in divorce.\n\n4. Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark (1888-1940) was the youngest child of King George I and Queen Olga of the Hellenes. His eldest brother, King Constantine I, was married to Queen Sophie. Prince Christopher married twice. His first wife, Princess Anastasia, was the wealthy heiress Nancy Leeds before their marriage. After her death in 1923, Christopher married Princess Françoise of Orleans; they were the parents of Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark.\n\n5. Empress Zita of Austria (1892-1989), born Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma, was the last Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary through her marriage to Emperor Carl I. Carl and Zita reigned for only two years before their titles were abolished after World War I. In 1922, Carl’s death made her a widow at the age of 29. She raised their eight children in exile throughout Europe and America, eventually settling in Switzerland, where she died in March 1989.\n\n6. King Alfonso XIII of Spain (1886-1941) reigned from the time of his birth in 1886 until his exile in the 1930s and eventual abdication shortly before his death. His mother, the influential Queen Maria Christina, was born an Austrian archduchess; she lived until 1929. Alfonso provided a home for Empress Zita and her children, the Palacio Uribarren at Lekeitio, until Zita decided to relocate to Belgium in 1929.\n\n7. Queen Amelie of Portugal (1865-1951), born Princess Marie Amelie of Orleans. Born into the former royal family of France, Amelie married Prince Carlos, the eldest son of the King of Portugal, in 1886. They reigned from 1889 until 1908, when Carlos was murdered in Lisbon in Amelie’s presence. Their son, King Manuel II, was deposed in 1910, and Amelie lived for four decades in exile until her death in France in 1951.\n\n8. Queen Elisabeth of the Hellenes (1894-1956), born Princess Elisabeth of Romania, was Greece’s queen consort from 1922 until her husband, King George II, was deposed in 1924. George and Elisabeth had no children, and their marriage was remarkably unhappy. They divorced in 1935. Elisabeth lived in her native Romania from the time of her Greek exile until the Romanian monarchy was abolished in 1947. She died in France nearly a decade later.\n\nPrince George and Princess Marina, Duke and Duchess of Kent (Wikimedia Commons)\n\n“Princess Marina’s Ring”\n\n(originally appeared in the Guardian, 13 Sep 1934)\n\nPrince George [1] left London by train for Balmoral last night, where he is to join the King [2] and Queen [3]. He travelled alone. Yesterday morning he returned to England from his holiday in Yugoslavia, during which he has become engaged to Princess Marina of Greece [4]. The Princess is at present in Paris.\n\nPrince George greets Princess Marina, her parents, and her sister, Princess Olga, at the docks in Dover\n\nSoon after arriving in London, Prince George went to buy an engagement ring; he will give it to the Princess when he meets her on Sunday on her arrival in England with her parents, Prince [5] and Princess [6] Nicholas of Greece.\n\nThe stone which Prince George chose is a beautiful square-cut Kashmir sapphire set in platinum with a baton diamond — an oblong square-cut diamond — on either side. Its technical description is “a square emerald cut Kashmir sapphire,” and it comes from the famous sapphire mines in Kashmir, where, according to a jewellery expert, the best gems in the world are found.\n\nGeorge and Marina pose for newsreel cameras on the grounds of Balmoral Castle\n\n“This is a particularly fine specimen,” the expert told a reporter, “and is cut in the modern square shape.” Sapphires, according to one in close touch with Prince George, are the favourite stone of Princess Marina. The weight and value of the stone is being kept secret.\n\nThe purchase was made at Messrs. Cartier, the famous jewellers, in Albemarle Street, and work on the ring began within a few moments of Prince George’s departure. A member of Messrs. Cartiers’ said: “Prince George has displayed the most modern taste in his choice both of the ring and of the setting. His selection will undoubtedly make sapphires the most popular ring for engagements this year.”\n\nMarina and George pose for cameras at Marlborough House in London\n\nNOTES\n\n1. Prince George, Duke of Kent (1902-1942) was the fourth son of King George V and Queen Mary of the United Kingdom. He served in the military and worked as a diplomat, but he was also known for his hedonistic personal life. Although he reportedly had numerous relationships with both women and men, he married his second cousin, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, in 1934. They had three children before George’s tragic death in a plane crash in Scotland during World War II.\n\n2. King George V of the United Kingdom (1865-1936), who reigned from 1910 until his death in 1936, was Prince George’s father.\n\n3. Queen Mary of the United Kingdom (1867-1953), born Princess Mary of Teck, was the consort of King George V and Prince George’s mother.\n\n4. Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent (1906-1968), born Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, was the last foreign princess to marry a member of the British royal family. She was the youngest daughter of Prince and Princess Nicholas of Greece and Denmark; her paternal grandparents were King George I and Queen Olga of the Hellenes, and her maternal grandparents were Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia. She married Prince George, Duke of Kent (her second cousin) in 1934. (Her mother-in-law, Mary of Teck, was also one of her godparents.) George and Marina had three children — Prince Edward (now Duke of Kent), Princess Alexandra, and Prince Michael. Only weeks after Michael’s birth, George died in a plane crash in Scotland. Marina remained a vital, visible member of the royal family after her husband’s death. She also became an international fashion icon.\n\n5. Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark (1872-1938), Princess Marina’s father, was the third son of King George I of the Hellenes and his Russian-born queen, Olga Constantinovna. Nicholas married his second cousin, Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, in 1902; they had three daughters. He died only four years after Marina married Prince George.\n\n6. Princess Nicholas of Greece and Denmark (1882-1957), born Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, was Princess Marina’s mother. She was the only daughter of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia. She married her second cousin, Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, in 1902. They had three daughters: Princess Olga of Yugoslavia; Princess Elizabeth, Countess of Toerring-Jettenbach; and Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent.\n\nPrincess Mafalda of Savoy, wearing the Hesse family’s ears of wheat wedding tiara, with Prince Philipp of Hesse on their wedding day, 1925 (Wikimedia Commons)\n\n“Italian Princess Weds Royal Lover”\n\n(originally published 25 Sep 1925 in the Winnipeg Journal)\n\nRacconigi, Italy, Sept. 23 — Princess Mafalda [1], second daughter of King Victor Emmanuel [2], was married here today to Prince Philip of Hesse [3] with ceremonies impressive in the simplicity which marked the union of two ancient royal families in an old-fashioned love match.\n\nMafalda, proud daughter of the House of Savoy, renounced ambition when she united her destiny to that of a German prince whose principality was swept away in the upheaval which cost his Hohenzollern uncle [4] the throne of the German Empire.\n\nA group photo taken during Mafalda and Philipp’s wedding celebrations. Some notable royal jewels are visible here; the Duchess of Aosta (behind the bride) wears her Stars and Knots Tiara, while Queen Elena (beside the groom’s father) wears the pearl and diamond loop tiara. Queen Margherita, standing between the groom and the bride’s father, appears to be wearing her diamond floral tiara.\n\nThe famous old Racconigi Castle was the scene of today’s nuptials. There were two ceremonies, the civil and the religious — the one performed by Premier Mussolini [5] as head of the government, the other by a venerable old priest who baptized Mafalda and her brother and sisters [6] — who has, in fact, baptized and married and buried a generation of scions of the House of Savoy.\n\nPromptly at ten o’clock, King Victor Emmanuel, in the uniform of a marshal of the army, appeared at the door of his private apartments, followed by Queen Mother Margherita [7], who was gowned in silver brocade and wore her famous pearl necklace. Queen Elena [8], resplendent in gold brocade, followed with King George of Greece [9].\n\nA full-length view of Mafalda’s wedding ensemble; she isn’t wearing the necklace described in this article. Perhaps the attire described here is from the civil ceremony, not the religious wedding?\n\nMafalda herself, on the arm of the Crown Prince of Romania [10], then appeared. Her wedding gown was of finely-embroidered white silk over which flowed a priceless veil, inlaid and edged with ancient handmade lace. The royal bride-to-be was wearing the necklace of 300 pearls presented by her brother, Crown Prince Umberto [11]. Premier Mussolini and Signor Tittoni [12] brought up the rear, following the princes of the House of Savoy.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. Princess Mafalda of Hesse (1902-1944), born Princess Mafalda of Savoy, was the second child of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Princess Elena of Montenegro. Mafalda’s marriage to Prince Philipp of Hesse in 1925 ultimately sealed her fate. Philipp later became a member of the Nazi party, and Mafalda was often in close proximity to high-ranking German officials. Both Hitler and Goebbels suspected that Mafalda was working against them during World War II. After her father had Mussolini arrested, she became an even greater object of scrutiny; she was subsequently arrested by the Gestapo and sent to the concentration camp at Buchenwald. She died in Buchenwald in 1944 after suffering injuries during a bombing raid. Her four children — Moritz, Heinrich, Otto, and Elisabeth — were raised by their father after the war.\n\n2. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy (1869-1947) reigned from 1900 until his abdication in 1946. His reign spanned two world wars; although Italy began World War II on the side of the Axis Powers, Victor Emmanuel’s arrest of Mussolini began a shift that led to an armistice with the Allies. His unpopularity led to a referendum on the monarchy in 1946; hoping it would help shift public opinion in favor of continued Savoy rule, he abdicated a month before the vote in favor of his son, Crown Prince Umberto. Italy voted in favor of a republic anyway, and Victor Emmanuel died the following year in exile in Egypt.\n\n3. Prince Philipp of Hesse (1896-1980) was the head of the House of Hesse from 1940 until his death in 1980. He was the third son of Prince Friedrich Karl of Hesse and Princess Margarete of Prussia (who was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria); he had a younger twin brother, Prince Wolfgang. (This Philipp was also the namesake of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.) Philipp’s two elder brothers both died in World War I, leaving him as heir to the headship of the former royal house. While working as an interior designer in Rome, he met Princess Mafalda of Savoy, daughter of the King of Italy, and the two were married in 1925. Five years later, Philipp joined the Nazi party, and his status as a former German prince launched him into the upper ranks of the party. After he was named governor of Hesse-Nassau, Philipp was personally implicated in horrific acts, including the murder of thousands of people suffering from mental illnesses. He reportedly also often served as a go-between for Hitler and Mussolini. During World War II, however, his relationship with higher-ranking Nazis soured, in part because of Philipp’s father-in-law’s arrest of Mussolini. Philipp was incarcerated in three different concentration camps until the end of the war, when he was arrested by Allied troops and charged for various crimes; those charges were later dropped. After his release in 1947, he was reunited with his children. In 1968, on the death of his cousin, Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine, Philipp succeeded to the headship of the cadet branch of the family, reuniting all branches of the Hesse family for the first time since the sixteenth century. He died in Rome in 1980.\n\n4. Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany (1859-1941) was a maternal uncle of Philipp of Hesse; Wilhelm and Philipp’s mother, Margarete, were siblings.\n\n5. Benito Mussolini (1883-1945), the founder of the Italian Fascist Party, was Italy’s prime minister at the time of this wedding. On Christmas Eve in 1925, he officially became “head of the government” — a dictator who answered only to the king. He ran Italy as a police state, creating an extravagant system of propaganda that helped him establish a cult of personality. He entered World War II as a German ally, but in 1943, he was ousted by King Victor Emmanuel and arrested. He continued to fight on the side of the Germans until he was killed in April 1945.\n\n6. Princess Mafalda had four siblings: Princess Yolanda, Countess of Bergolo; King Umberto II of Italy; Tsaritsa Giovanna of Bulgaria; and Princess Maria Francesca of Bourbon-Parma.\n\n7. Princess Margherita of Savoy (1851-1926) was Queen of Italy from 1878-1900, through her marriage to her first cousin, King Umberto I. She was the only daughter of Prince Ferdinand of Savoy, Duke of Genoa and Princess Elisabeth of Saxony. Her marriage was primarily one of political convenience, and she became an important influence on her son, King Victor Emmanuel III. She died a few months after this wedding.\n\n8. Princess Elena of Montenegro (1871-1952) was the daughter of King Nicholas I of Montenegro and the wife of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. She was noted for her charity work, which was recognized in 1937 when she was presented with a Golden Rose by Pope Pius XII. She followed her husband into exile in Egypt in 1946 after his abdication. She died in France in 1952.\n\n9. King George II of the Hellenes (1890-1947) was in between his two reigns as Greece’s monarch at the time of this wedding. He had reigned from 1922 until March of 1924, when a Greek republic was proclaimed; after a controversial plebiscite in 1935, he was restored to the throne, reigning until his death in April 1947.\n\n10. Crown Prince Carol of Romania (1893-1953), later King Carol II, was heir to the Romanian throne and husband to Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark at the time of this wedding. He had also recently embarked on an extramarital affair with Magda Lupescu, a relationship that would last for the rest of his life. In December 1925, after being photographed with Lupescu in Milan, Carol was compelled to renounce his rights to the throne in favor of his young son, Michael. He and Helen officially divorced in 1928, and two years later, he was back in Romania to reclaim the throne. He reigned from 1930 until 1940, when he was forced to abdicate. He died in exile in Portugal in 1953. (I’m still not sure why he walked Mafalda down the aisle at her wedding — feel free to chime in below if you know!)\n\n11. Crown Prince Umberto of Italy (1904-1983), later King Umberto II, was Princess Mafalda’s younger brother and heir to the Italian throne. He married Princess Marie Jose of Belgium in 1930. After Mussolini was ousted in 1943, King Victor Emmanuel transferred most of his powers to Umberto; in 1946, with a referendum on the monarchy looming, he abdicated in Umberto’s favor. King Umberto II of Italy reigned for only 34 days. His brief springtime reign earned him the nickname of “the May King.” He and Queen Marie Jose separated in exile in Portugal, and he died in Geneva in 1983.\n\n12. Tommaso Tittoni (1855-1931), a former Italian prime minister, was serving as President of the Italian Senate at the time of this wedding. A supporter of Mussolini even after he became dictator, Tittoni died in Rome in 1931."
