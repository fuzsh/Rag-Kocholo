        "text": "The next country I want to examine is Britain. However, before I do, in yesterday’s blog entry King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy is another example of kings not changing their ordinal number after they received a new title.\n\nIn 1849 Prince Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy became King Vittorio Emanuele II of Sardinia-Piedmont when his father abdicated the throne, after being defeated by the Austrians at the Battle of Novara.\n\nHe subsequently met Giuseppe Garibaldi at Teano, receiving from him the control of southern Italy and becoming the first King of Italy on March 17, 1861.\n\nDespite becoming a King of an entirely new state, a united Kingdom of Italy, King Vittorio Emanuele kept the ordinal number of “II” that he had as King of Sardinia-Piedmont instead of beginning a new numbering system.\n\nIn fact the rulers of the House of Savoy maintained the same numbering system as Counts of Savoy, Dukes of Savoy, Kings of Sardinia-Piedmont and finally as Kings of Italy.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBy the 11th century, London was clearly the largest town in England. Winchester had been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: “It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.”\n\nWhether Winchester or London there had been a monarch reigning for centuries and the ordinal number of the monarch remained constant no matter the name of the state.\n\nIn England from the rise of seven petty kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England known as “The Heptarchy” till when these entities were consolidated in the 8th century into the four kingdoms of East Anglia, Mercia, Northumbria, and Wessex.\n\nThen Wessex absorbed these kingdoms to become the Kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons, then the Kingdom of the English, and the Kingdom of the English starting with the reign of King John.\n\nThe Kingdom of England would last until 1707 when it was united with the Kingdom of Scotland. From 1603 England and Scotland were in personal union with the monarch. After the unification the realm was known as the Kingdom of Great Britain until 1800 when the Irish Parliament was joined with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nFrom the personal union of England and Scotland the ordinal numbers of the individual monarch remained separate. It isn’t until England and Scotland are united does a problem with ordinal numbers begin to appear. In 1603 Queen Elizabeth I of England died without issue and was succeeded by James VI, King of Scots. Since he was the first king of England by that name he became known as King James I of England.\n\nAlthough England and Scotland shared a monarch they remained separate countries and retained their separate governments as well as ordinals for their monarchs accordingly. During this time period there were monarchs that had dual ordinals and some that did not.\n\nFor example, Charles I and Charles II were the first two of that name in either England or Scotland so that did not present a problem. Charles II’s successor was his brother James who was known as King James II of England and King James VII of Scotland. King William III of England was also King William II of Scotland and these are two examples of monarchs that technically had dual ordinals, although you may not often see them regarded in that fashion.\n\nIn 1707 during the reign of Queen Anne (1702-1714) the Parliaments of England and Scotland were finally united creating the kingdom of Great Britain. When Ireland joined in 1801 the nation became the United Kingdom of Great Britain. This meant the separate titles of King or Queen of England and Scotland ceased to exist.\n\nThere was also no need for two separate ordinals for the monarchs. This did not matter for the first four successors to Queen Anne, all named George, because there had never been a King George in either England or Scotland until that time.\n\nAfter the reign of King George IV, who died in 1830, it seemed that the ordinal numbers used in Scotland were to be ignored and those that had been used in England would take precedence. This is demonstrated by the fact that in 1830 with the accession of the Duke of Clarence as King William IV he was not called William III in Scotland and no one seemed to mind. He could have been called King William of the United Kingdom to reflect the new nation-state but I find no evidence if that option was ever considered.\n\nA little trouble was stirred up in 1901 with the accession of King Edward VII (1901-1910). Some theorized that since the United Kingdom was a new nation Edward VII and Edward VIII should or could have been called Edward I and Edward II.\n\nThe problem really reared its head in Scotland with the accession of Elizabeth II. Elizabeth I was queen of England only and the Scots never had a queen named Elizabeth reigning over them. An example of one of the objections made at the time of her accession was the use of the Royal Cypher “EIIR” anywhere in Scotland.\n\nThe use of that particular cypher even instated violence. Today the cypher that is used in Scotland on all government and Crown property has no lettering and displays an artistic rendering of the Crown of Scotland from the Honors of Scotland.\n\nIn order to prevent any further problems with the numbering of the monarchs in the United Kingdom Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested that in the future the monarch should use the higher of the two numerals from the English and Scottish sequences. Therefore if there is another King James he will not be James III but James VIII. If there is a King Robert he will be Robert IV since there were three kings of Scotland by that name.\n\nThis demonstrates that the English manner of numbering monarchs took precedence over the Scottish numbering system. So until Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested that in the future the monarch should use the higher of the two numerals from the English and Scottish sequences, the English numbering system was retained despite the change in the name of the State.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: I wanted to post this yesterday on the proper date but unfortunately I needed a break as other things were acquiring my attention.\n\nVittorio Emanuele II (March 14, 1820 – January 9, 1878) was King of Sardinia (also known as Sardinia-Piedmont) from March 23, 1849 until March 17, 1861, when he assumed the title of King of Italy and became the first king of an independent, united Italy since the 6th century, a title he held until his death in 1878. Borrowing from the old Latin title Pater Patriae of the Roman emperors, the Italians gave him the epithet of Father of the Fatherland.\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy was born as the eldest son of King Carlo Alberto of Sardinia-Piedmont and Archduchess Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Tuscany a daughter of Grand Duke Ferdinand III, of Tuscany and Luisa of Naples and Sicily. She was named after her great-grandmother Empress Maria Theresa.\n\nVittorio Emanuele’s father succeeded a distant cousin as King of Sardinia-Piedmont in 1831. Prince Vittorio Emanuele lived for some years of his youth in Florence and showed an early interest in politics, the military, and sports. He was styled as the Duke of Savoy prior to becoming King of Sardinia.\n\nIn 1842, he married his first cousin, Archduchess Adelaide of Austria. She was born at the Royal Palace of Milan to Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria and his wife Princess Elisabeth of Savoy. Named Adelaide, or known as Adele in the family, she held the title of Archduchess of Austria. Her father was the Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia.\n\nArchduchess Adelaide of Austria’s mother, Princess Elisabeth of Savoy, was born in Paris to Prince Carlo Emanuele of Savoy, Prince of Carignano (1770–1800), and Princess Maria Cristina of Saxony (1770–1851). Princess Elisabeth of Savoy’s elder brother was King Carlo Alberto of Sardinia-Piedmont.\n\nHe became King Vittorio Emanuele II of Sardinia-Piedmont in 1849 when his father abdicated the throne, after being defeated by the Austrians at the Battle of Novara.\n\nKing Vittorio Emanuele II was immediately able to obtain a rather favourable armistice at Vignale by the Austrian imperial army commander, Radetzky. The treaty, however, was not ratified by the Piedmontese lower parliamentary house, the Chamber of Deputies, and King Vittorio Emanuele retaliated by firing his Prime Minister, Claudio Gabriele de Launay, replacing him with Massimo D’Azeglio. After new elections, the peace with Austria was accepted by the new Chamber of Deputies.\n\nHe appointed Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, as his Prime Minister, and he consolidated his position by suppressing the republican left. In 1855, he sent an expeditionary corps to side with French and British forces during the Crimean War; the deployment of Italian troops to the Crimea, and the gallantry shown by them in the Battle of the Chernaya (August 16, 1855) and in the siege of Sevastopol led the Kingdom of Sardinia to be among the participants at the peace conference at the end of the war, where it could address the issue of the Italian unification to other European powers.\n\nThis allowed King Vittorio Emanuele II to ally himself with Napoleon III, Emperor of France. France had supported Sardinia in the Second Italian War of Independence, resulting in liberating Lombardy from Austrian rule.\n\nKing Vittorio Emanuele II supported the Expedition of the Thousand (1860–1861) led by Giuseppe Garibaldi, which resulted in the rapid fall of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in southern Italy. However, King Vittorio Emanuele II halted Garibaldi when he appeared ready to attack Rome, still under the Papal States, as it was under French protection.\n\nIn 1860, Tuscany, Modena, Parma and Romagna decided to side with Sardinia, and King Vittorio Emanuele II then marched victoriously in the Marche and Umbria after the victorious Battle of Castelfidardo over the Papal forces. This led to his excommunication from the Catholic Church until 1878, just before his death in the same year. He subsequently met Garibaldi at Teano, receiving from him the control of southern Italy and becoming the first King of Italy on March 17, 1861.\n\nIn 1866, the Third Italian War of Independence allowed Italy to annex Veneto. In 1870, King Vittorio Emanuele II also took advantage of the Prussian victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War to conquer the Papal States after the French withdrew. He entered Rome on September 20, 1870 and set up the new capital there on July 2, 1871. King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy died in Rome on January 9, 1878, and was buried in the Pantheon.\n\nThe Italian national King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy Monument in Rome, containing the Altare della Patria, was built in his honour.\n\nElisabeth of Savoy (April 13, 1800 – December 25, 1856) was the Vicereine of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia by marriage to Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria. She was the aunt and mother-in-law of Vittorio Emanuele II, the first king of a united Italy. By birth, she was a member of the House of Savoy-Carignano.\n\nEarly life\n\nMaria Francesca Elisabetta Carlotta Giuseppina was born in Paris to Carlo Emmanuel, Prince of Carignano (1770–1800), and Princess Maria Cristina of Saxony (1770–1851).\n\nHer mother, Maria Christina of Saxony, was the only surviving child of Prince Charles of Saxony, Duke of Courland, himself son of King Augustus III of Poland and his wife, Countess Franciszka Krasińska. Her parents married secretly in Warsaw in 1760. The marriage was considered morganatic in Saxony. Her mother was created Princess Franziska Krasińska Wettin in her own right due to her marriage, only after the intervention of Emperor Joseph II.\n\nKing Augustus III of Poland was also known as Elector Friedrich August II of Saxony in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nPrincess Elisabeth of Savoy also had an elder brother, Carlo Alberto, future King of Sardinia.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn May 28, 1820 she was married in Prague to Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria, a son of Emperor Leopold II and Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain.\n\nHis mother, Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain, was born the fifth daughter, and second surviving child, of Carlos, King of Naples and Sicily, and Maria Amalia of Saxony.\n\nHer father, the future Carlos III of Spain, had become King of Naples and Sicily in 1735 after its occupation by the Spanish in the War of Polish Succession. After her father became King of Spain at the death of her half-uncle, Fernando VI of Spain, in 1759, she became known as Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain, and she moved with her family to Spain.\n\nArchduke Rainer Joseph and was a younger brother of Franz II, Holy Roman Emperor, first Emperor of Austria.\n\nAlthough Rainer Joseph suffered from a mild form of epilepsy, this did not visibly interfere with his military career.\n\nArchduke Rainer Joseph served as Viceroy of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia from 1818 to 1848.\n\nThe Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia was a constituent land (crown land) of the Austrian Empire from 1815 to 1866. It was created in 1815 by resolution of the Congress of Vienna in recognition of the Austrian House of Habsburg-Lorraine’s rights to the former Duchy of Milan and the former Republic of Venice after the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, proclaimed in 1805, had collapsed.\n\nThe position as Viceroy for the Emperor made Rainer Joseph and his wife the head of the Austrian court at Milan. Rainer Joseph’s politics were increasingly unpopular, the Italians resented him for their lack of political freedom and for collecting revenues with so little benefit to them.\n\nIssue\n\nWith Archduke Rainer Joseph she had eight children, among them,\n\nArchduchess Adelaide (June 3, 1822 – January 20, 1855), who became the wife of her first cousin Vittorio Emanuele II, King of Sardinia, from 1849 to 1861 and subsequently King of a united Italy.\n\nVittorio Emanuele II, King of Sardinia was born as the eldest son of King Carlo Alberto of Sardinia, and Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, daughter of Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Luisa of Naples and Sicily.\n\nAs mentioned above King Carlo Alberto of Sardinia was the elder brother of Princess (Archduchess) Elisabeth of Savoy.\n\nDeath\n\nArchduchess Elisabeth died of tuberculosis in Bolzano on Christmas Day, 1856.\n\nOtto, the Kingdom of Italy and Becoming Emperor\n\nUnder Charlemagne, who deposed the Italian king, took up the title “king of the Lombards”. After the death of Charles the Fat in 887, Italy fell into instability and a number of kings attempted to establish themselves as independent Italian monarchs. During this period, known as the Feudal Anarchy (888–962) the title Rex Italicorum (“King of the Italians”) was introduced replacing the title King of the Lombards.\n\nBerengar I of Italy (the last of the Carolingians to claim the Imperial title) fought against Rudolf II of Burgundy, a member of the Elder House of Welf, to control northern Italy and this conflict ended with Berengar’s death, and Rudolf could claim the Italian throne. However, the inhabitants of Lombardy weren’t happy with this decision and called for the help of another ally, Hugh of Provence, who considered Rudolf an enemy for a long time.\n\nAlthough Hugh challenged Rudolf for the Burgundian throne, he only succeeded when Rudolf II died in 937, and in order to be able to control Upper Burgundy Hugh decided to marry his son Lothair with Adelaide, the daughter of Rudolf II of Burgundy, and Bertha of Swabia who was 15 years old. The marriage produced a daughter, Emma of Italy, born about 948. Emma became Queen of West Francia by marrying King Lothair II of West Francia, the eldest son of King Louis IV of West Francia and Gerberga of Saxony.\n\nThe next threat to the Italian throne came from Berengar of Ivrea who was a son of Margrave Adalbert I of Ivrea and his wife Gisela of Friuli, daughter of Berengar I of Italy, his grandfather who he was named after. Berengar succeeded his father as margrave about 923 and married Willa, daughter of the Bosonid, margrave of Tuscany and niece of Hugh of Provence, King of Italy. In 940 Berengar led a revolt of Italian nobles against the rule of his uncle by marriage, Hugh of Provence.\n\nTo evade an assault by Hugh’s liensmen, Berengar, forewarned by the king’s young son Lothair, had to flee to the court of King Otto I of East Francia. Otto avoided taking sides; nevertheless, in 945 Berengar was able to return to Italy with hired troops, welcomed by the local nobility.\n\nHugh was defeated and retired to Arles, and he was nominally succeeded by his son who briefly became King Lothair II of Italy. From the time of Berengar’s successful uprising, all real power and patronage in the Kingdom of Italy was concentrated in his hands, with Hugh’s son Lothair as titular king only. Lothair’s brief reign ended upon his early death in 950, presumably poisoned.\n\nBerengar of Ivrea now assumed the royal title and became Berengar II of Italy with his son Adalbert as co-ruler. He attempted to legitimize his kingship by forcing Lothair’s widow Adelaide, into marriage with Adalbert. Adelaide fiercely refused, whereafter Berengar had her imprisoned at Garda Castle, allegedly mistreated by Berengar’s wife Willa. With the help of Count Adalbert Atto of Canossa, Adelaide managed to flee and entreated the protection of King Otto of East Francia. Otto, himself a widower since 946, married Adelaide himself, and assumed the title of King of the Lombards, and received the homage of the Italian nobility.\n\nIn 960, the former King Berengar II of Italy once again invaded the Papal States under the rule of Pope John XII, who appealed to King Otto to battle against Berengar II. It wasn’t until after the Pope agreed to crown him as Emperor, did Otto assemble his army to march upon Italy. In preparation for his second Italian campaign and the imperial coronation, Otto planned his kingdom’s future. At the Imperial Diet at Worms in May 961, Otto named his six-year-old son Otto II as heir apparent and co-ruler, and had him crowned at Aachen Cathedral on May 26, 961.\n\nOtto II was anointed by the Archbishops Bruno I of Cologne, William of Mainz, and Henry I of Trier. The King instituted a separate chancery to issue diplomas in his heir’s name, and appointed his brother Bruno and illegitimate son Wilhelm as Otto II’s co-regents in Germany.\n\nOtto’s army descended into northern Italy in August of 961 through the Brenner Pass at Trento. The German king moved towards Pavia, the former Lombard capital of Italy, where he celebrated Christmas and now assumed the title King of Italy for himself. Berengar II’s armies retreated to their strongholds in order to avoid battle with Otto, allowing him to advance southward unopposed.\n\nOtto reached Rome on January 31, 962; three days later, February 2, Otto was crowned Emperor by Pope John XII at Old St. Peter’s Basilica. The Pope also anointed Otto’s wife Adelaide who had accompanied him on his Italian campaign, as empress. With Otto’s coronation as emperor, the Kingdom of Germany and the Kingdom of Italy were unified into a common realm, later called the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: March 14 is the birthdate of two Italian Kings, Vittorio Emanuele II and his son Umberto I. I’d like to give a short synopsis of both kings.\n\nVittorio Emanuele II, King of Sardinia-Piedmont & King of Italy\n\nVittorio Emanuele II (Vittorio Emanuele Maria Alberto Eugenio Ferdinando Tommaso di Savoia; March 14, 1820 – January 18, 1878) was King of Sardinia-Piedmont from 1849 until 17 March 1861, when he assumed the title of King of Italy and became the first king of a united Italy a title he held until his death in 1878.\n\nBorn in Turin as the eldest son of Carlo Alberto King of Sardinia-Piedmont and Maria Theresa of Austria, Princess of Tuscany, a daughter of Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Luisa of Naples and Sicily. Vittorio Emanuele fought in the First Italian War of Independence (1848-49) before being made King of Sardinia-Piedmont following his father’s abdication.\n\nArchduchess Adelaide of Austria\n\nIn 1842 Vittorio Emanuele married his first cousin once removed Archduchess Adelaide of Austria (1822–1855). She was born at the Royal Palace of Milan to Archduke Rainer of Austria and his wife Princess Elisabeth of Savoy, daughter of Carlo Emanuele, Prince of Carignano (1770–1800),and Maria Cristina of Saxony (1770–1851). She had an elder brother of Carlo Alberto future King of Sardinia. By her he had eight children.\n\nVittorio Emanuele II supported the Expedition of the Thousand (1860–1861) led by Giuseppe Garibaldi, which resulted in the rapid fall of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in southern Italy. However, Vittorio Emanuele II halted Garibaldi when he appeared ready to attack Rome, still under the Papal States, as it was under French protection. In 1860, Tuscany, Modena, Parma and Romagna decided to side with Sardinia-Piedmont, and Victor Emmanuel then marched victoriously in the Marche and Umbria after the victorious battle of Castelfidardo over the Papal forces. He subsequently met Garibaldi at Teano, receiving from him the control of southern Italy and becoming the first King of Italy on March 17, 1861.\n\nThe rest of Vittorio Emanuele II’s reign was much quieter. After the Kingdom of Italy was established he decided to continue on as King Vittorio Emanuele II instead of Victor Emmanuel I of Italy. This was a terrible move as far as public relations went as it was not indicative of the fresh start that the Italian people wanted and suggested that Sardinia-Piedmont had taken over the Italian Peninsula, rather than unifying it. Despite this mishap, the remainder of Vittorio Emanuele II’s reign was consumed by wrapping up loose ends and dealing with economic and cultural issues.\n\nVittorio Emanuele died in Rome in 1878, after meeting with Pope Pius IX’s envoys, who had reversed the excommunication, and received last rites. He was buried in the Pantheon. His successor was his son Umberto I.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUmberto I, King of Italy\n\nUmberto I (Umberto Rainerio Carlo Emanuele Giovanni Maria Ferdinando Eugenio di Savoia; March 14, 1844 – July 29, 1900), nicknamed the Good, was the King of Italy from January 8, 1878 until his assassination on July 29, 1900.\n\nThe son of Vittorio Emanuele II and Archduchess Adelaide of Austria, Umberto was born in Turin, which was then capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia, on his father’s 24th birthday. As Crown Prince, Umberto was distrusted by his father, who gave him no training in politics or constitutional government, and he was brought up with no affection or love. Instead, Umberto was taught to be obedient and loyal; had to stand at attention whenever his father entered the room; and when speaking to his father had to get down on his knees to kiss his hand first. The fact that Umberto had to kiss his father’s hand before allowed to speak to him both in public and in private right up to his father’s death contributed much to the tension between the two.\n\nAt first, Umberto was to marry Archduchess Mathilde of Austria, the second daughter of Archduke Albert, Duke of Teschen and Princess Hildegard of Bavaria; however, she died as the result of an accident at the age of 18.# On April 21, 1868, Umberto then married his first cousin Margherita of Savoy, daughter of born to Prince Ferdinand of Savoy, Duke of Genoa and Princess Elisabeth of Saxony. Their only son was Victor Emmanuel, prince of Naples., later King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy.\n\nMargherita of Savoy\n\nUmberto kept many mistresses on the side, and his favorite mistress, Eugenia, the wife of Duke Litta Visconti-Arese, lived with him at his court as his common-law wife as he forced Queen Margherita to accept her as a lady-in-waiting.\n\nWhile Umberto was to be described by a modern historian as “a colorless and physically unimpressive man, of limited intellect” Margherita’s appearance, cultural interests and strong personality were to enhance the popularity of the monarchy.\n\nAscending the throne on the death of his father (January 9, 1878), Umberto adopted the title “Umberto I of Italy” rather than “Umberto IV” (of Savoy), in direct contrast to his father who retained his regnal number as King of Sardinia-Piedmont and consented that the remains of his father should be interred at Rome in the Pantheon, rather than the royal mausoleum of Basilica of Superga.\n\nUmberto’s reign saw Italy attempt colonial expansion into the Horn of Africa, successfully gaining Eritrea and Somalia despite being defeated by Abyssinia at the Battle of Adwa in 1896. In 1882, he approved the Triple Alliance with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary.\n\nUmberto I, later in life.\n\nHe was deeply loathed in leftist circles because of his conservatism and support of the Bava-Beccaris massacre in Milan. He was especially hated by anarchists, who attempted to assassinate him during the first year of his reign.\n\nOn the evening of July 29, 1900, Umberto was assassinated in Monza. The king was shot four times by the Italian-American anarchist Gaetano Bresci. Bresci claimed he wanted to avenge the people killed in Milan during the suppression of the riots of May 1898.\n\n# I will be posting on the tragic life of Archduchess Mathilda of Austria later today.\n\nAfter the death of Charles the Fat in 888, the briefly reunited Carolingian Empire broke apart, and was never restored. According to Regino of Prüm, the parts of the realm “spewed forth kinglets”, and each part elected a kinglet “from its own bowels”. After the death of Charles the Fat, those crowned emperor by the pope controlled only territories in Italy. The last such emperor was Berengar I of Italy, who died in 924.\n\nBerengar I (c. 845 – April 7, 924) was the king of Italy from 887. He was the Roman Emperor between 915 and his death in 924. He is usually known as Berengar of Friuli, since he ruled the March of Friuli from 874 until at least 890, but he had lost control of the region by 896.\n\nBerengar rose to become one of the most influential laymen in the empire of Charles the Fat, and he was elected to replace Charles in Italy after the latter’s deposition in November 887. His long reign of 36 years saw him opposed by no less than seven other claimants to the Italian throne. His reign is usually characterised as “troubled” because of the many competitors for the crown and because of the arrival of Magyar raiders in Western Europe. He was the last emperor before Otto the Great was crowned in 962, after a 38-year interregnum.\n\nOtto I (November 23, 912 – May 7, 973), traditionally known as Otto the Great, was German king from 936 and Holy Roman Emperor from 962 until his death in 973. He was the oldest son of Heinric I the Fowler and Matilda of Ringelheim, the daughter of the local count Dietrich and his wife Reinhild, a noblewoman of Danish and Frisian descent.\n\nOtto inherited the Duchy of Saxony and the kingship of the Germans upon his father’s death in 936. He continued his father’s work of unifying all German tribes into a single kingdom and greatly expanded the king’s powers at the expense of the aristocracy. Through strategic marriages and personal appointments, Otto installed members of his family in the kingdom’s most important duchies. This reduced the various dukes, who had previously been co-equals with the king, to royal subjects under his authority. Otto transformed the Roman Catholic Church in Germany to strengthen royal authority and subjected its clergy to his personal control.\n\nThe Hungarians (Magyars) invaded Otto’s domain as part of the larger Hungarian invasions of Europe and ravaged much of Southern Germany. Though Otto had installed the Margraves Hermann Billung and Gero on his kingdom’s northern and northeastern borders, the Principality of Hungary to the southeast was a permanent threat to German security. The Hungarians took advantage of the kingdom’s civil war and invaded the Duchy of Bavaria in spring 954. Though Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, and Conrad, Duke of Lorraine, had successfully prevented the Hungarians from invading their own territories in the west, the invaders managed to reach the Rhine River, sacking much of Bavaria and Franconia in the process.\n\nThe Hungarians, encouraged by their successful raids, began another invasion into Germany in the spring of 955. Otto’s army, now unhindered by civil war, was able to defeat the invasion, and soon the Hungarians sent an ambassador to seek peace with Otto. The ambassador proved to be a decoy: Otto’s brother Henry I, Duke of Bavaria, sent word to Otto that the Hungarians had crossed into his territory from the southeast. The main Hungarian army had camped along the Lech River and besieged Augsburg. While the city was defended by Bishop Ulrich of Augsburg, Otto assembled his army and marched south to face the Hungarians.\n\nOtto and his army fought the Hungarian force on August 10, 955 at the Battle of Lechfeld. Under Otto’s command were Burchard III, Duke of Swabia and Bohemian troops of Duke Boleslaus I. Though outnumbered nearly two to one, Otto was determined to push the Hungarian forces out of his territory. According to Widukind of Corvey, Otto “pitched his camp in the territory of the city of Augsburg and joined there the forces of Henry I, Duke of Bavaria, who was himself lying mortally ill nearby, and by Duke Conrad with a large following of Franconian knights. Conrad’s unexpected arrival encouraged the warriors so much that they wished to attack the enemy immediately.”\n\nWhile Otto was fighting the Hungarians with his main army deployed in Southern Germany, the Obotrite Slavs in the north were in a state of insurrection. Count Wichmann the Younger, still Otto’s opponent over the King’s refusal to grant Wichmann the title of Margrave in 936, marauded through the lands of the Obotrites in the Billung March, causing the followers of Slavic Prince Nako to revolt. The Obotrites invaded Saxony in the fall of 955, killing the men of arms-bearing age and carrying off the women and children into slavery. In the aftermath of the Battle of Lechfeld, Otto rushed to the north and pressed far into their territory. A Slav embassy offered to pay annual tribute in return for being allowed self-government under German overlordship instead of direct German rule.[80]Otto refused, and the two sides met on October 16, at the Battle of Recknitz. Otto’s forces gained a decisive victory; after the battle, hundreds of captured Slavs were executed.\n\nCelebrations for Otto’s victory over the pagan Hungarians and Slavs were held in churches across the kingdom, with bishops attributing the victory to divine intervention and as proof of Otto’s “divine right” to rule. The battles of Lechfeld and Recknitz mark a turning point in Otto’s reign. The victories over Hungarians and Slavs sealed his hold on power over Germany, with the duchies firmly under royal authority. From 955 on, Otto would not experience another rebellion against his rule and as a result was able to further consolidate his position throughout Central Europe.\n\nLiudolf’s death in the fall of 957 deprived Otto of both an heir and a commander of his expedition against King Berengar II of Italy. Beginning with the unfavorable peace treaty signed in 952 in which he became Otto’s vassal, Berengar II had always been a rebellious subordinate. With the death of Liudolf and Henry I, Duke of Bavaria, and with Otto campaigning in northern Germany, Berengar II attacked the March of Verona in 958, which Otto had stripped from his control under the 952 treaty, and besieged Count Adalbert Atto of Canossa there. Berengar II’s forces also attacked the Papal States and the city of Rome under Pope John XII. In autumn 960, with Italy in political turmoil, the Pope sent word to Otto seeking his aid against Berengar II. Several other influential Italian leaders arrived at Otto’s court with similar appeals, including the Archbishop of Milan, the bishops of Como and Novara, and Margrave Otbert of Milan.\n\nAfter the Pope agreed to crown him as Emperor, Otto assembled his army to march upon Italy. In preparation for his second Italian campaign and the imperial coronation, Otto planned his kingdom’s future. At the Imperial Diet at Worms in May 961, Otto named his six-year-old son Otto II as heir apparent and co-ruler, and had him crowned at Aachen Cathedral on 26 May 961. Otto II was anointed by the Archbishops Bruno I of Cologne, William of Mainz, and Henry I of Trier. The King instituted a separate chancery to issue diplomas in his heir’s name, and appointed his brother Bruno and illegitimate son William as Otto II’s co-regents in Germany.\n\nOtto’s army descended into northern Italy in August 961 through the Brenner Pass at Trento. The German king moved towards Pavia, the former Lombard capital of Italy, where he celebrated Christmas and assumed the title King of Italy for himself. Berengar II’s armies retreated to their strongholds in order to avoid battle with Otto, allowing him to advance southward unopposed. Otto reached Rome on January 31, 962; three days later, he was crowned Emperor by Pope John XII at Old St. Peter’s Basilica. The Pope also anointed Otto’s wife Adelaide of Italy, who had accompanied Otto on his Italian campaign, as empress. With Otto’s coronation as emperor, the Kingdom of Germany and the Kingdom of Italy were unified into a common realm, later called the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe kingdom/Empire had no permanent capital city. Kings traveled between residences (called Kaiserpfalz) to discharge affairs. However, each king preferred certain places; in Otto’s case, this was the city of Magdeburg. Kingship continued to be transferred by election, but Kings often ensured their own sons were elected during their lifetimes, enabling them to keep the crown for their families. This only changed after the end of the Salian dynasty in the 12th century.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire became eventually composed of four kingdoms. The kingdoms were:\n\n* Kingdom of Germany (part of the empire since 962),\n\n* Kingdom of Italy (from 962 until 1648),\n\n* Kingdom of Bohemia (since 1002 as the Duchy of Bohemia and raised to a kingdom in 1198),\n\n* Kingdom of Burgundy (from 1032 to 1378)."
