        "text": "The legitimacy of government institutions in modern democratic states is derived from the will of citizens expressed in the procedure of democratic elections based on universal and equal active and passive voting rights – as generally accepted democratic standards. However, the electoral system of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose content and quality are crucially determined by imposed constitutional arrangements, is based on the combination of ethnic representation of constituent peoples, territorial representation of entities, and representation of citizens in the institutions of BH. This publication can thematically be divided into four parts. The first part generally considers theoretical principles regarding legality and legitimacy of the government’s institutions in a democratic society in a general sense. The second part considers principles of civic, ethnic, and entity/territorial representation in the BH institutions. The third part contains an analysis of the election procedures stipulated by the Constitution and the BH Election Act of Law related to the BH state institutions. The fourth part gives an analysis of the existing electoral system in BH from the standpoint of democratic standards and practices of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. This section also contains considerations concerning the role of institutions in non-implementation of democratic standards within the BH electoral system."
