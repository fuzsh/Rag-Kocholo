        "text": "At what level do laws exist in Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n\nLaws at the state level of Bosnia and Herzegovina, then entity laws, namely: laws of the Federation of BiH, laws of the Republic of Srpska, laws of the Brcko District of BiH, laws at the cantonal level.\n\nHow is a law adopted at the level of Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n\nA draft law can be submitted by any representative/delegate, commissions of parliaments, joint commissions of both parliaments, parliaments, as well as the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, within their competences. The draft law is submitted to the chairman of the parliament, who immediately submits it to the collegium of the parliament. The collegium submits the draft law to the constitutional-legal commission for the purpose of giving an opinion on the law, and after deciding which commission is competent, to the competent commission, too. Then follows the first commission phase, first reading, second commission phase, second reading, harmonization of the law.\n\nWhat is the procedure for passing laws at the level of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n\nIn the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the legislative power is exercised by the FBiH Parliament, which consists of the House of Representatives and the House of Peoples. The executive power is exercised by the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina president (and two vice-presidents) and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Government. The legislative procedure can be divided into two phases: the phase before entity governments and the phase before entity parliaments. The functions of the entity governments are to take care of the functions of the executive power in the territory of the entity within their competence. We must not forget that there are also lower levels of government in the entities that also exercise power. So in Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina we have cantons, towns and municipalities. At the head of entity governments are prime ministers, who have been nominated for that position by the president of the entity, and who have been elected to that position by the entity parliaments.\n\nHow are laws made in Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n\nAll legislation requires the approval of both chambers. All decisions in both chambers shall be by majority of those present and voting. Best efforts shall be made to include at least one-third of the votes of delegates or members from each territory or entity, cf. the Constitution Article IV, 3 (d)."
